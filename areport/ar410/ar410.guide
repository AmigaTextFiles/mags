Finally, it's (almost) all over (again).

By the time you read this, a long day of meetings at VIScorp will have
ended, meetings between corporate officers and bankers, all working out the
terms of the Amiga purchase.

It will soon be time to close the book on another brief chapter in Amiga
history and start working to make sure that the next 12 months are entirely
unlike the last 12.

In the meantime, life goes on.  Katherine Nelson and I will be at Amiga
Convention '96 in Montreal next weekend--I hope to see as many of you
there.  AWeb II has finally been released commercially, and I'm hearing
tales of IBrowse's release as well.

Perhaps the best news in a long time is that since the release of the Amiga
Developer CD last month, over 2,000 have been sold.  To me, that says there
are at least 2,000 people who are incredibly anxious to develop better
software for the Amiga.  Laid end to end, those people would stretch over 2
miles.  More importantly, their efforts will give us all something new to
do for quite a long time to come.

I hope everybody still has their seatbelt on from last year.  Things are
only going to get more interesting, I think.  Sure, things aren't perfect.
I wish I had the answers to all of the policy questions we all want to hear
addressed.  After talking with Don Gilbreath and Raquel Velasco of VIScorp
today, a few more things are falling into place.

So sit back and enjoy.

Jason

Date: 08 Jul 96 10:31:40 -500
From: bka@idirect.com (Brad Avery)
Subject: Reader mail

Jason,

 After reading a letter, by Nigel Milnes, in issue 4.09 of the 30th
of June 1996, I finally broke down & decided it was time to write in.

 In the letter Nigel claimed that he bought a 12MHz 68000 chip & put
it in his A500 resulting in faster system performance as well as MMU
support. This is simply not possible.

 The 12MHz rating on the chip Nigel bought means it is capable of running
at 12MHz & the 8MHz rating on the standard C= one means it is capable
of running at 8MHz. Just because a cpu is capable of running at a certain
speed, does not mean it will run at that speed automatically. A cpu only
runs as fast as the crystal clocking it. In the case of the A500 C= used
a 7.14MHz cpu clock. They used the 8MHz version cpu because it was rated
high enough to handle their 7.14MHz clock. By Nigel putting a 12MHz cpu
in his system, it acheives no speed increase (as verified by his SysInfo
test) because the cpu is still being clocked at 7.14MHz. The only way to
speed up the system would be to alter the clock signal - to a maximum of
12MHz in his current situation. This however, if possible, would throw
the systems timing off, since one clock is dependent on another in the
A500, and would most likely render the system unusable.

 The MMU capability he speaks of, doesn't seem right either. The 68000
had no internal MMU, it used the 68451 external MMU. The 68020 used the
68851 (I believe) & the > 68020 cpu's (non EC version) have one built in.
Not being too familiar with ImageFX, I'd have to wonder if it used non
MMU based virtual memory like Image Studio does.

 I hope nobody ran out & wasted their money buying a 12MHz 68000 chip,
because the A500 doesn't use an independent cpu crystal & therefore
cannot be changed to properly clock a higher rated cpu.

Subject: The Winning EDGE ONLINE

Hello Jason,

I read the letter from Michael Ingleby in AR4.09. It struck me that while a
MIDI interface built into the NEXT GENERATION AMIGA is a good idea, it is
less than a winning strategy for the future. The great majority of the
public "don't know from Midi and could care less".  What the Amiga has
needed for a long time is built in connectivity (read networking) but that
is not a killer either. Most Amigas will live far from one another.

There is a technology coming on line that could be the next killer
application, CABLE MODEMs. Motorola (among others) has started producing
new modems to connect over cable television. Each manufacturer has his own
take on what they are but there seems to be some common specs. Fiber optic
cable will carry the information from system to system,and into the
Internet, but coax cable will carry television and digital information from
the system headend to the home.  Coax has a theoretical bandwidth of 30
megabits per second (30Mbps), but actual throughput will be lower because
the bandwidth is shared among the cable subscribers.  The Motorola
Cybersurfer cable modems have the ability to download from the cable
headend at 10 Mbps and to upload from your computer at 768 kilobits per
second (768 Kbps). This compares to 33.6 Kbps for the current fastest
analog telephone modems, and 128 Kbps for ISDN.

Television cable systems will have to rebuild their systems to allow
bi-directional amplification and communication, and many are making plans
to do that. Then each system will need to choose the modem technology that
they will use. TCI, the largest cable company in the world is getting ready
to launch the @HOME network. It seems to be supporting several
modems,including the Motorola.

The articles and advertisements that I have seen do not list how these
cable modems will connect to the computer. So in search of more info, I got
onto the @HOME webpage (www.home.net).  The specs listed there call for a
minimum system (PEE CEE of course) that includes a 10 base Ethernet
networking card.  For those who don't know,10 Base is 10 Mbps. Sound
familiar?  So it appears that the cable modem connection is going to be via
ethernet interface. If this is the case, and since the Amiga could use good
networking in professional arenas, a built in 10base ethernet on the low
end machines would position them for the new high speed connections into
the Internet via cable modem and on University and College networks. For
the highend machines it would be nice to have the interface easily
upgradable to the newer 100 base ethernet.

A MIDI interface would be nice but since the cable modem would allow a
permanent connection into the internet it will touch many more needs in the
future.  Of course both would be even better.

Subject: ImageFX upgrades

Jason,

I'd like to publicly say thanks to Nova Design Inc for a great product
(ImageFX) and even better support.

A few weeks ago, I purchased ImageFX 2.1a from a local Amiga dealer for the
full price of $400AU.  After reading AR408, I learned that version 2.6 was
available and that ver2.1's price had been reduced.

I wrote a letter to Nova Design enquiring about the upgrade deal, and from
'outta the blue' I promptly received a free upgrade to version 2.6

Its service like this that makes me proud to own an Amiga...
Keep up the good work,

Regards,
George.

Subject: Reader Mail

I just read the article 'EZ135 Follow up' in AR4.09.

I thought Paul's review the first time was based on greed.  More speed and
megs...  But, you have to give someplace for that extra speed.  In this
case, as poor Paul found out, was quality.  It sounds like he's bent his
drive head out of alienment.  A Syquest repair.  He should ship the drive
to them demanding it to be repaired...  He claims the Zip to be 'Dog Slow'
and is too light.  (That I agree on.  You cannot use it in the upright
position because it will fall over.   ((I use Both cable ports))) To fix
this problem, you can buy a LEAD strip and attach it to the back/side of
the drive if you feel it's that needed.  But 'Dog Slow'?  Not quite!

The Zip drive runs at about 940k on my A3000 (sysinfo) and does have a
access time of about 29ms.   IF you optimize the disk it runs much quicker
since it's the search time that slows down the drive and not the actual
Data Transfer rate.

I've owned my Zip: Drive since DEC.  '95 and have 7 disks currently.  I
have it chained to 4 other devices in my external SCSI case.  (easy to
make!) With No problems in Set up/formating/conflicts.

I have dropped 3 of my Zip: Disks about 4 feet onto tile with NO DATA loss.
This proved my choice was the right one. 

Spin up and loading/unloading are a dream. 4 seconds until I can use it.

Paul also said that the ZIP was the way to go in the end, I'm glad he's
seen the light, but with more and more Amiga users hailing the JAZ drive
now, with it's fast speed and 1 gig space...  I do hope people listen and
not buy the Syquest rip off coming out...

Thanks

Subject: Reader Mail

Hi Jason -- this for either the "Reader Mail" or the "Opinion" section of
AR, whatever you think best.

These are just some thoughts I had seeing Robert Davis' article on being
on the internet in AR409.

I think that many people, Amiga users in particular, underestimate the
value of a Unix shell internet account.  There are three primary
advantages to such an account.  (1) It's easy to set up.  (2) It's fast.
(3) It's available from anywhere you have a computer with a modem and any
plotz terminal program.  Sure, it's limited, and sure, it doesn't cost
that much more to have a PPP account nowadays.  However, there is much to
be said for it, and you can do _most_ of what you end up really wanting to
be able to do with an internet account anyway.

As regards the first point.  On a local BBS I call, every so often somebody
will log on and post how they are having a terrible time getting AmiTCP to
work.  Invariably, the sysop or somebody else suggests that I might be able
to help, since I'm a bit of an AmiTCP junkie.  (Not only did I write a few
small pieces of Napsaterm, but I've got AmiTCP running both on an A3000 with
an ethernet card (tmnwh.caltech.edu) and over a PPP account.)  And,
invariably, I fail to get the poor chap going.  Always, I know going into
it, that the only way for me to really help would be to go to his computer,
sit down, and futz around until I got things working.

With a shell account, you run your terminal program.  Lots of people know
how to run terminal programs.  It's trivial in comparison to getting
AmiTCP running.  You log on, and things work.  Sure, Unix isn't intuitive,
but if you are an Amiga shell user, you won't find Unix that prohibitive.
And it has perfectly usable E-mail programs (I recommend Pine) along with
a host of other utilities.

The second point, speed.  This is the most significant one.  When people
discuss the internet account they're trying to get, I suggest perhaps a
shell account.  They always say, oh, no, you can't do the internet without
graphics nowadays.  Well, sure, there're a lot of graphics out there.  But
IMHO the most important part of the internet is E-mail -- which is text,
text, text.  Even cruising the web, sure, the graphics are pretty, but most
of the _information_ you're actually after is text based.  Now, here's the
rub.  If you're using a 14.4K modem, or even a 28.8K modem, a web page with
big graphics -- the sort of page which inspired you to get a graphical
internet connection in the first place -- will take bloody _forever_ to
load.  When I use AWeb or another Amiga browser from home, I generally turn
off automatic image loading and only load a few of the images I think I want
to see.

With a Unix shell account, you can run lynx, which is a perfectly effective
world wide web browser.  No graphics, but all the text.  And, it's faster!
On two or three fronts.  One, you don't wait for the graphics to load.  Two,
rendering the plain ASCII text is faster for lynx than rendering the fonts
is for graphical browsers (this is a minor effect).  Three -- and I doubt
most people fully appreciate this -- if you visit a long document, the whole
document doesn't have to go through the 14.4Kbaud or 28.8Kbaud bottleneck
that is your modem.  You visit a 100Kbyte text document, being interested in
only a small piece of it.  If you are running the browser on your computer
over a PPP connection, the full 100K has to be sent over the modem to your
computer.  If you're running Lynx on a Unix shell account, the server you
have your shell account on gets the 100K document, and all that gets sent
over the modem is the text that's visible on your screen.

The third point, availability.  Once you've finally got your Amiga set up to
run your PPP account, you can probably fairly easily access it -- from
_that_ Amiga.  A Unix shell account, you can access from pretty much any
terminal.  You can even telnet into it, generally, from another account
(e.g. a friend's)!  If your Amiga has a hard drive crash, you don't have to
be disconnected from your E-mail when all you can do is borrow your friend's
PC.

So, this has become long and rambling.  But, to summarize my point, yes,
there are things a PPP account has to offer, and advantages to having your
Amiga fully "on the internet."  On the other hand, for most of what most
people do on the internet, a text-based shell account is a perfectly fine
solution -- and it's easier, often somewhat cheaper, and faster than a PPP
account.  If what you want is to be able to cruise the web to look for
textual information there, and to receive and send E-mail, don't a priori
eschew a Unix shell account because it's not "the hot thing."

Subject: I think I know what the problem is with the EZ135 or AR Mail
Date: Thu, 04 Jul 1996 16:34:17 GMT

I own several computers, and while I haven't encountered any problems using
the EZ on my A2000 yet, I expect I will.  I hope to make this story as
short as possible, but I must say that it is complicated.  In fact, reading
this from bottom to top may be a good idea...

My troubles all started when I decided to re-tool my substandard 486DX2/66.
I bought a SCSI controller, a replacement EIDE controller, and the EZ.  I
installed the SCSI card, its drivers and the EZ, and its drivers first... 
Surprisingly, there were no headaches involved in this process.  So I
thought to myself, "Great, my luck must have changed, usually this requires
hours of tinkering because of IRQ conflict this, EMM386 that, and HDD
failure 'what?'"

Well, the EIDE controller fix that notion right quick.  After installation
everything seems fine.  Until the SQDRIVER.SYS line in my CONFIG.SYS, then
my machine hangs...  Well after a long exchange of email with EIDE card's
tech support people, we came to the conclusion that it was fault in the
motherboard (it's motherboard from hell BTW).  I also called Syquest around
this time and was told to try using the software supplied with my SCSI
card.  Things were fine and I was told that there shouldn't be a problem
using the SCSI card's software.

Now here's the bit that will be of interest to AMIGA users with EZ135
drives.

Recently, cartridges formatted after I began using the generic driver have
become grossly unreliable.  I became very concerned and started by
contacting Syquest.  I asked them if it could be electromagnetic
interference affecting the drive or the SCSI cable, I asked if it were
possible brownouts were the cause, I also asked if it were because I was
using generic drivers and disk utility software.  All the tech support
representative I sent email to could come up with was "You could get the
cartridges replaced by calling ourcustomer [sic] service @ 1 800 245-2278."

That didn't tell me if there might be a fault in my EZ Drive, or the
cartridges, the SCSI cable, the placement of the drive (relative to other
equipment), or the software I was using.  So I started to re-evaluate the
situation, and I stumbled onto what I think is the answer.

I started trying to recover the data on the cartridges before I reformatted
them to see if the problem was consistent.  And then I noticed it.  A
consistency between all the cartridges with errors.  They all had roughly
50MB of space remaining.  Then it struck me.  When I was using the Syquest
software, the drive didn't seem to actually get formatted.  Instead it
seems as if the software altered the file structure.  After all, how can
you have IBM software "hidden" on a Macintosh formatted cartridge.  When I
used the generic software, it too seemed not to physically format the
drive, it only partitioned it (I'm assuming that's what it did).  This
leads me to believe (and reading the little insert that comes with each
cartridge supports) is that that portion of the cartridge containing the
Mac/DOS/Windows software still exists and this is what causes the problem.

I can't say if a low level format will solve the problem, or if it will
simply cause more problems.  What I think the AMIGA community needs to do
is let the folks at Syquest know they are not amused.  And see if whoever
developed the Zip tools for the Iomega Zip drive can create similar
software for the EZ135 Drive.

I've tried sent email to Syquest and to Adaptec (the makers of my SCSI
card) but have yet to receive a reply.  So if I find out anything new, I'll
let you know.

===========================================================================

NFTF 7/96

So I'm all freeze-frame, snapshot, bound-up in limbo-like nowheresville.  I
feel like a passenger during a Transporter malfunction.  You know, dust all
over the place, but going nowhere at the speed of light.  This is the
emotional condition of Amiganauts everywhere.  As I talk to fellow club
members and Amiga users around the world via the internet newsgroups, I
find a general ennui, a malaise vaguely reminiscent of post-traumatic
stress disorder.  In fact, I'd probably call it that except the trauma is
far from "post", and way the hell past "pre".  We're definitely adrift in
the middle of a huge sea of trauma, latitude 0, longitude 0 (isn't
zero-zero island supposed to be around here somewhere:^).

Anyway, a good number of Amiganauts seem rather despondent at the
Viscorp-Escom receedings (as opposed to PROceedings).  What with AT and
Viscorp both spewing uncertain directions, vague promises, and NDA excuses,
and Amigans riding roller-coaster rumors and swinging on vines of hope
(what do you think would have happened to Tarzan if his vines were made of
hope?), there are a hell of a lot of desertions to the PC and Mac
platforms.  Desertions by still loyal Amigans who look back with longing at
the tombstones of dead girlfriends, knowing full well that they're settling
for security and stability and mediocrity, and that the wilder, more
passionate ride is over.  They're doing a dead man's float in their
individual pools of grief and anger and loss.  Yup, this is the climate of
the Amiga frontier.

And, I say, to hell with it all.  

I'm tired of watching legal, and corporate and technical developments like
an entymologist studying his bugs.  Bugs disgust me and so do the latest
"press releases," the hyper-hopeful-hype, and the killer app vaporware that
has been the Amiganaut's steady diet for the last three years!  I'm tired
of being asked to visualize the large, juicy steak I'll be getting from the
bone fragment I'm tossed.

Now don't get me wrong.  I've nothing but praise for the likes of the loyal
companies that put their money where their mouth is.  Hooray and extremely
high kudos for Nova Design, and Stylus, Inc., and Wonder, and Safe Harbor
and Software Hut, and Paxtron and Pios and Phase 5 and Oregon Research, and
Chaocity and Quikpak and Softwood, and Softlogic, and Digita and Cloanto
and Almathera and, yes, even NewTek and Scala,Inc.,(boy, I'm starting to
feel better as I type this list:^).  Well done, people.  And Because you
stuck with us thru thin (was there ever "thick"?), I'm sticking with you.

That's right.  I'm not jumping ship.  I'm not deserting.  Oh, sure, I use
Mac's and PC's at work, but that's because I have to.  I realize that
though the press hype is all about those platforms "catching up" to the
Amiga's capabilities, the fact - yes, fact - is that they are not there
yet! 

Understand? NOT THERE YET!

Win95's interface is still in your face, and Macintosh still makes me feel
like I'm in a bicycle race with my training wheels on.  No, it's only the
Amiga that causes me to choose to be at the computer instead of having to
be.  With all the above metioned companies, I have software that I'll be
using for years to come to produce what I both need and want to produce.
But the big difference is that I'll enjoy doing it on the Amiga! 

The above lament was simply a plea to Viscorp or AT or Escom or whoever the
hell owns our beloved technology, that time is getting to be more and more
a commodity we have less and less of.  We just don't have the time (or the
inclination) to read or listen to your bullshit anymore.  What set-top box?
The idea of browsing Internet Web Pages on my TV set may give my
Optamologist wet dreams, but not me!  Who do you think is going to read
text on TV's - especially text that's been created for SVGA output?  Who do
you think is going to RENT pieces of software for their everyday needs at
what will no doubt be usurious prices?

Perhaps you believe that marketing (a synonym for hype and lying) will
create a demand for these useless products and methods.  After all, look
how Wild Bill Gates managed to convince the sheep that Wintel is the cat's
meow.  How Apple convinced the Graphic Arts industry's lambs that their
overpriced, overprotective, memory-gluttonous hardware and software should
be the industry standard.  ("Hey, I'll just pass the cost on to the client,
heh..heh..").  Well, I've said this before but it bears repeating:

"Amiga users are not sheep, they're wolves." Remember that as you pick up
your shepherd's staff. 

Now, Viscorp, or At, or Escom, if my "take" on this is ill-informed, or
uninformed, or misinformed then please understand it is because I've been
informed by you.

Ciao for now...

Amiga in general.  In some areas, it is even difficult to find an Amiga
magazine. 

What The Informer does is supply you with information about the Amiga in a
concise, capsuled format.  We'll help you get in touch with dealers and
developers, provide you with info on development projects, and help you
come to grips with the internet.  You'll read about useful programs and how
to get them.  We provide Email ad- dress, BBS listings, Web page URL's,
phone numbers, and other means to communicate with Amiga companies and
people.  In addi- tion, you'll get the latest news about the Amiga computer
and the Amiga community at large.  And to top it off, everything from start
to finish is produced using only Amiga computers, proving the versatility
of this wonderful machine.

together from all across the world to show its support for the 
Amiga!  We hope to make this show an event in the long fight to 
make the Amiga a well known computer in North America again.  

WHY: We are putting on the Amiga Convention '96 to support our favorite
computer, the Amiga!  We feel that for too long, the Amiga has been
ignored, and now that the Amiga is owned by people who actually will
support it well, we want to help them out in any way we can.   We also want
to get a lot of people together to have a really cool time!

to show and sell your wares to a crowd of Amiga owners, all of whom have
money to spend and are influenced by how big a prescence you have at the
show.

WHY PEOPLE SHOULD COME: We will have stands from many major dealers and
developers.  It will also have a lot of friendly Amiga owners there, plus a
booming sound system and TV setup that will show crazy demos and products.
It will be a wild good time for all!  BRING YOUR AMIGA AND HAVE A BALL

Escom Lays Off Employees
As Stock Investigation Begins

A WALL STREET JOURNAL News Roundup

Escom AG, the giant German computer retailer that filed for protection from
creditors last week, said it plans to lay off 1,900 of its 4,440 European
employees and close an undisclosed number of stores.

Meanwhile, Germany's Securities Trading Supervisory Office confirmed Friday
that it is investigating alleged insider trading in Escom shares.  The
regulator said it had noticed a suspicious surge in the number of Escom
shares traded, and a plunge in the stock's price, in the weeks preceding
the company's announcement last Wednesday.

"The turnover seen was very suspicious in comparison with previous levels,"
Anke Reeh-Schild, a spokeswoman for the office, said in response to an
inquiry from Reuter News Service.

Volume Jumps Ninefold

She said that in the three weeks before Escom's announcement, volume in its
shares had risen eight or ninefold from previous average levels.

"The probe could take a few months," Ms.  Reeh-Schild said.  "At the moment
it is a routine investigation against persons unknown." Escom could not be
reached for comment.

Separately, an Escom spokeswoman told the Associated Press that Chairman
Helmut Jost is planning on a 1997 payroll of 2,500 European employees, 43%
less than current staffing.

In Germany, as many as a dozen of Escom's 130 stores could be closed, said
Marc Ullrich, head of the Escom Computervertriebs-GmbH subsidiary.  Escom
has more than 450 stores across Europe and earlier this month announced it
was closing 65 of its 235 U.K.  branches.

The company, Europe's second-largest computer retailer, with an estimated
2.35 billion marks ($1.55 billion) in sales last year, filed for creditor
protection to save it from bankruptcy after a new estimate put its 1995
losses at 180 million marks, up from a March forecast of 125 million marks.

Ms.  Reeh-Schild said the insider-trading investigation would first center
on electronically analyzing transaction volumes and price movements.  Then
banks would be asked for the names and addresses of customers on whose
behalf the shares had been traded.

Generally Illiquid

Between June 3 and July 2, the day before Escom made its announcement, the
company's share price slumped 49% to 4.63 marks from 9.15 marks.  It ended
trading Friday at 2.85 marks.

A total of 105,128 Escom shares were traded on June 3, and in the following
weeks volumes in the generally illiquid share surged, reaching more than
one million shares on several days.

Insider dealing was outlawed in Germany in 1994 as part of a drive to make
the German financial center more attractive to investors and traders.  The
maximum punishment is five years in jail, but so far prosecutors have
resorted to fines, with four sentences passed to date.

The highest fine was imposed on the son of an owner of beverage machinery
manufacturer Krones, who was ordered to pay 600,000 marks last year and
risk paying an additional 1.8 million marks if he breaks any laws within
the following two years.

DESCRIPTION

     DiskProtection encrypts data totally invisible for the user while
     writing to disk. All blocks are encrypted, so the directories are
     protected, too. DiskProtection supports all exec devices, i.e.
     harddrive partititions, floppy disks, but not the RAM-disk. Any
     filesystem can be used.

     It features:
      - encryption with IDEA, FEAL, DES, SCRM and custom algorithms
      - (XPK-)interface for additional algorithms
      - configurable with easy to use preferences program
      - encryption can be changed anytime
      - resident passwords (for use with mailboxes)
      - access protection
      - builtin screenblanker
      - GUI driven, localized
      - German and English documentation (ASCII, DVI, AmigaGuide)
      - context sensitive online help
      - ...

      New Features:
      - fast, but unsafe encryption algorithm
      - DPInit, a tool to start DiskProtection without mounting anything
      - example source code for your own encryption libraries
      Bug Fixes:
      - "Hide in File" was somehow buggy
      - sorting order of XPK libraries was reversed

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     DiskProtection requires OS2.0 and Triton-Library 1.4 A minimum

     rename, discard a file, as well as hide it from your list.

     You'll have at your disposal two nice routines, "FitDisk"
     and "SingleFit", which will allow you to optimize your
     collection of files to fit in the least possible number of
     disks.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     McFiler requires OS 2.0+ (v37+) and "reqtools.library" v38+

Permission Granted to Distribute without Alteration

VIScorp Proceeds with Amiga Acquisition

On Thursday, the 18th of July, 1996, the final contract of purchase was
signed between the bankruptcy trustee solicitor, Bernhard Hembach, and the
president and CEO of VIScorp, William Buck, with approval of the 'pool of
banks' for the entire remaining inventory and intellectural property.

Until the 18th of August, 1996, VIScorp has time to establish the necessary
companies to carry on with its current business.  In the meantime, the
business will be run with the approval of the bankruptcy trustee Hembach
under the name AMICA Technologies GmbH i.K.  From the 19th of August, 1996,
the business will finally be run under the name, control and ownership of
VIScorp.

VIScorp Message: July 24, 1996
Chicago, IL
July 24, 1996

An Open Message to the Amiga Community
from Bill Buck, CEO, VIScorp:

1.  Escom AG and Amiga Technologies GmbH are in bankruptcy and will cease
to exist as corporate entities.  VIScorp has reached an agreement with the
Trustee for the liquidation of these companies and with the creditors of
these companies for the purchase of "Amiga." There were at least eleven
different banks or companies that had claims to be "owners" of the
technology and/or the inventory.  Escom had liabilities of over $250
million.  Imagine the confusion...

2.  The steps that we had to follow through the last three months were
painstaking.  As the situation at Escom deteriorated, we had to continually
re-negotiate our purchase contract.  We could not speed-up the process.
Many things we wanted to begin immediately we have had to delay.  The
situation at Amiga and Escom were extremely troubled.  This was in part
because of the difficult financial and management situations at Amiga and
Escom, but also because of how poorly organized the intellectual property
had been under Commodore.  In the course of the Commodore bankruptcy many
problems developed that were never repaired.

3.  The final (and last of three) purchase contract was signed on Friday,
19 July.  It cannot be changed; it has been executed.  The intellectual
property of the former Commodore and the inventory of the former Amiga
Technologies will be owned finally by VIScorp.  The final paperwork will be
completed in the next 30 days.  During this month, VIScorp GmbH will be
registered and Amiga Technologies will continue to operate temporarily in
bankruptcy for VIScorp.

 4.  Petro Tyschtschenko and his staff will continue to operate from
Germany.  Raquel Velasco and Petro Tyschtschenko will be the new General
Managers of Amiga, to be known as VIScorp GmbH.  Al Duncan, a former
General Manager of Commodore will join VIScorp to manage the sales and
distribution of VIScorp and Amiga products in North America.   Petro will
continue to operate from Germany and manage the existing business.  Raquel
is looking for someone from the community to manage the re-organization of
the sales and distribution in Europe.   Please contact <A
HREF="mailto:raquel@vistv.com">Raquel</A> if you are the right person for
this job.

5.  The engineering efforts of the former Amiga Technologies and the
on-going engineering of VIScorp will be combined and professionally
managed.  We intend to begin to implement the plans we outlined in Toulouse
very shortly.

6.  Please excuse our lack of communication with the community over the
last months.  We were severely restricted from communicating our
activities.  Please resend your emails to any of the VIScorp staff if they
have not been answered by this letter.  We simply could not answer all the
emails. 

7.  Do not expect miracles from VIScorp, expect slow, but steady progress.

Thank you for your continued support.

Bill Buck

040-ERC Boards

With the beginning of July 1996, phase 5 digital products will release the
Blizzard 1240 T/ERC, a low cost 68040 based accelerator board especially
for tower housed Amiga 1200 main boards.  Due to the mechanical dimensions
and the high power consumption together with the heat emission of the 68040
processor and the therefor needed active cooling cap the board will not fit
into standard A1200.  The abbreviation ERC stands for EcoReCycling meaning
the processors used on this board are recycled and tested 68040 processors
operating at 40MHz with MMU/FPU.  By using these processors a very
competitive pricing of DM549,- for the Blizzard 1240 T/ERC is possible.
The board is axpandable to a total amount of 128 MB of RAM by standard 72
pin SIMM.  All other specifications are the same as those for the well
known BLIZZARD 1260; so later upgrades to the 68060 processor can be easily
done.  Like it's Big Sister the, Blizzard 1240 T/ERC can be expanded by the
SCSI Kit IV.

Also good news for all A2000 users.  A Blizzard 2040 ERC will be available
equipped with the same recycled and tested 68040 CPU eith MMU/FPU running
at 40 MHz clock frequency.  All other specifications are exactly the same
as for the BLIZZARD 2060.   The Blizzard 2040 ERC will be sold for DM
699,-- and like the Blizzard 1240 T/ERC upgradeable to the 68060 processor.

Last not least with release date in September the ERC version of the
Cyberstorm MKII board will be available.  The Cyberstorm MKII 040/40ERC
will have the same specifications as the 68060 version.  This turbo board
can be used in all A3000, A3000T, A4000 and A4000T and can hold up to 128
MB local Fast RAM.  Off cours this board can also easily upgraded to the
68060.  The pricing for the 68040 version with MMU/FPU running at 40 MHz
will be DM 749,--.

Oberursel, July 96:

With the beginning of August 1996, phase 5 digital products will release a
new generation graphics board, the CyberVision64/3D at a very competitive
pricing.  Designed for use as either a Zorro-II or Zorro-III board it will
work in all Amiga 2000, 3000 and 4000(T) series models as well as with
tower modifications of Amiga 1200 series models equipped with Zorro-II
backplanes.  CyberVision64/3D's modular design allow low entry prices at
high end perfomance and optimal expandibility.

Core of the new board will be the new graphics chip Virge with 3D
capabilities produced by the well known manufacturer S3.  The chip is able
to do complex 3D functions in hardware, like shaded and textured surfaces
with trilinear filtering as well as shading and fogging for very realistic
real tome 3D rendering.  In conjunction with the new CyberGraphX 3D library
CyberVision64/3D is offering a wide range of complex 3D functions for
software developers reducing development time and expense for developers
supporting the new CGX3D standard.

In addition to those features, a MPEG decoder can be added to the feature
connector allowing real time MPEG audio and video decoding at full size
custom screens or in workbench windows, allowing high quality display by
using the 16 and 24 bit modes of the workbench provided by CyberGraphX.
For stereo audio output a dedicated line output jack is provided.

The second optional expansion will be a monitor switcher with integrated
scan line doubler designed to fit into the Amiga's slot providing automatic
switch over from the Amiga's original Signal to the CyberVision64/3D's
output.  Mechanical dimensions of the switcher and the CyberVision64/3D
allow the use of both cards in th lower slot of A3000 / A4000 models
keeping 3 Zorro-III slots free for other expansion boards.

With all these features the CyberVision will be available in Germany at
suggested retail prices of DM 449,- with 2 MB and DM 599,- with 4 MB video
RAM.  The MPEG module expected to be released at the same time will be
available at DM 349,- and the scan doubler / monitor switcher is will cost
DM 149,-.  Developers registered in the PowerUP program can purchase the
CyberVision64/3D at a special developers price.

A very special offer will be available for users of the CyberVision64. 
There will be no MPEG modul available for the predecessor, since the add on
bus of the Trio64 used on the CyberVision64 is no longer supported by S3
and other manufacturers.  Due to the immense development required for the
implementation of that add on bus a MPEG module would have to be sold for
more than DM 500,-.  Because of this, CyberVision64 users who wish to use
MPEG can purchase the CyberVision64/3D together with the MPEG module for DM
499,- from phase 5 digital products.

===========================================================================
                             Amigas At Disney
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

On our (Amiga Report Assistant Editor Katherine Nelson and I) recent
vacation to Orlando, Florida and the Disney World theme parks, about the
LAST thing I expected to see was an Amiga.  I always HOPE to see one, but
honestly, I wasn't hoping too hard.  After all, it's not every day someone
will leave one sitting out as obviously as the 1084S at the Ontario Science
Center (last winter) or in the recent movie Brain Candy (also a 1084S)...

But I was wrong.  We were watching the Indiana Jones Stunt Show, roughly in
the center of the audience area seating, when Katie leaned over to me,
pointed at the show control area in the front aisles of the seating and
said, "Hey, is that a 1084?"  Intrigued, I looked down there.  I spotted a
14-inchish monitor, beige in color, but with a blue screen and some sort of
white text on it.  We couldn't make anything out from the distance, and
while at first I thought it might indeed have been a 1084, I decided it was
probably just a VGA monitor on a PC.  It sorta looked like they were just
running a DOS application in a white-on-blue text mode.

But after the show was over, we had to know for sure.  So we made our way
down close enough...and sure enough, there was a 1084.  Under it was a
dirty, beat-up, but still functional Amiga 2000 (with a keyboard whose
spill-guard skin was so old it was brown).  In the center of the equipment
(lots of switches and knobs, of course) was another 2000.  There was a tech
still at the first 2000's chair.

"Do you mind me asking what you're using your Amigas for?" I asked him,
hoping that our amazing recognizance of the machines would put a smile on
his face.

Well, it didn't.  It turns out that our new friend wasn't exactly an Amiga
person himself, just one of the guys who runs the show.  But he was at
least familiar with what he was working on.  The first machine we spotted,
the one with the blue and white display, was running a
microphone-monitoring program.  Basically, it kept track of the activity
and level of all of the cast and crew microphones for the show.  The
software, so we learned, was designed by Sennheiser.  While I didn't press
him to let me play with the machine, it looked rather 1.3ish.

The other system, he explained, was using a setup designed by Richmond
Sound and was in effect the control center for the entire show, accepting
relay triggers from the various cues and touchplates on the stunt show
stage and handling them in the proper manner with the rest of the
equipment.  Quite a job, if you ask me.

We never quite figured out if there was a third system up and running.

Our friend told us that the systems had been in place for a good 7 or 8
years and that the original crew who had them installed were all long
gone--which might explain why I had a really tough time getting him to give
me the name of a person I could talk to discuss the quite impressive fact
that Disney/MGM Studios puts one of their biggest draws in the hands of a
computer that far too few people own.

By one of the most interesting coincidences I've seen in quite some time,
Richmond Sound of Canada just put a Web site online.  In an interesting
move, Richmond has chosen the URL http://www.show-control.com/ as their
own.  (Pretty clever, if you ask me.)  The site profiles their three major
product lines for show and effect control--all of which are Amiga based, a
fact RSD states quite proudly.

The site also lists some of Richmond's clients--quite an impressive resume,
for both Richmond and the Amiga.  If you need a reason to feel a bit better
about the impact Amigas have made on technology in real life, pop by and
take a look.

I've gotta tell you, sometimes when I see or hear of an old A2000 at a
company, I wonder if it's really in use, if it might be able to find a
better home.  But the folks at Disney/MGM, courtesy of Richmond Sound, seem
to be putting theirs to pretty good use.  If you're at Disney/MGM in the
future, do me a favor and do as I did, pop down and just mention to the
techs there that you noticed their Amigas.  Who knows?  They just might
figure it out. :)

                              rich924@aol.com
===========================================================================

In this day we are changing computers quicker than minds.  I donated my
C-64 away, since I did not need it to prop open my window because of my new
air-conditioner.  =) (Please no flames, I really love and miss my C-64).  I
have a bunch of old computers around, the PC's become outdated so quickly,
you can't find uses for them because they will not do anything
sophisticated like the Amiga.

For a while I was running my A-500 para-netted to my A-3000.  The A-500 had
1 meg internal, a high-density drive internal with an external low-density
drive.  It has a GVP-A500+ attached to its side with 100 meg scsi hard
drive and 4 megs of ram.  I could not see abandoning the platform, but the
68030 at 30 mhz with 10 megs was too good.  I started using the A-500 less
and less. 

I then formed the idea of having ARexx controlled software playing iff
samples for the birds.  I found DeliTacker from Peter Kunath and Frank
Riffel.  It was very configurable and had ARexx controls!  Only my PC had
an audio digitizer so I needed SoundZap on the Amiga to convert the .WAV to
a .IFF.

The A-500 has been playing 4 iff samples, three times a day, repeating the
sample for 4 mintues.  This gives the birds a 16 minute lesson 3 times a
day.  The software actually rotates through a list of 5 iff files, and only
plays 4 in one lesson.  I have had the A-500 running like this for a year
now.  Oh yeah, the A-500 was doing all this with out the GVP-A500+ HD!  It
has been running everything with just 1 meg of ram and 2 floppies!

My birds have a vocabulary of 30+ words, and I keep hearing people talk
about how smart they are (birds in general).  I now have a box with two
buttons on it that they can press and play an iff file.  The box has a
Basic Stamp2 microcontroller in it, which has a serial port on it.  The
Basic Stamp2 is a 24 pin SMT dip!  It is over-kill, but I had one around. 
I programmed it to monitor the buttons and send a "1" or a "2" down the
serial line at 9600,N,8,1 .  The serial port on the Amiga is set to the
same spec using prefs.   ARexx is monitoring the serial port, and will play
the respective file associated with the "1" or "2".  In my case "1" is
Laura (my girlfriend) saying "I love you" and "2" is me saying "Hello".
Being that I just rigged the buttons to the cage an hour ago the birds are
a little scared of it and have not tested it yet.  I will be posting
information on my web page about the experiment, the address is
http://members.aol.com/rich924, my E-mail address is rich924@aol.com.

Future modifications may be to have more buttons or keep the two and have
one select the IFF and the other play the IFF

                        Review: AGA Experience 2 CD
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

The AGA Experience is back, with another ton of (almost) entirely AGA
software and graphics for Amiga users.

Quite a bit, to my mind, makes this CD even better than its precursor.  Of
course I'm pleased that they've renewed their Amiga Report license, but
that's the least of my concerns.

The much-hyped HTML information pages, with an early version of AWeb, are
fine but nothing to get over-excited about.  Of more interest to me is the
wealth of genuinely good stuff on here for AGA computers.

In order:

Animations--There's actually not much here, but just about everything is of
at least "good" quality.

Demos--While not pretending to be a comprehensive collection, there are
really an awful lot (well over 100 megs) here, AND Sadeness has taken the
trouble to screen them for you for compatibility.  When you click on a
demo, you'll be told if it works with your machine, if it will exit back to
Workbench when it's done, and you're given the final option to run it or
not.  A necessity, and a very nice touch.

Games--A quite good collection of mostly AGA-only games and a few assorted
utilities, HD installers, and cheats.  Enough to keep you busy for quite
some time unless you've already played everything on Aminet twice.

Pictures--Some really beautiful JPEGs in here.  Everything is click and go.

Slideshows--Take them or leave them.

Exclusive--A nice collection in here.  Previews of Capital Punishment
(almost works on my 4000T/040), Gloom Deluxe, Pinball Prelude, and others.

Utilities--A good starter collection for all occasions.  Includes a number
of good PD utilities as well as previews and demos of Cinema4D, StormC, and
others.  Of particular interest--at least to me--is the collection of
emulators.  They must have been reading my mind. :)

Diskmags--As I mentioned, a licensed collection of recent Amiga Reports is
here.  As well, there's quite a few of the best Amiga online and disk
magazines, including RAW, AmigaPD, and others.

Sound--A small collection of decent quality mods, ready to run from the
disk.  As well, there's a few trackers and sound utilities.  Not bad.

Icons+--The sort of thing that makes WB-tweakers go wild.  Lots and lots
and lots of new icons (and Newicons) to make your system look that much
better.

And yes, these all seem to fit together quite well.  As a sampler CD, it's
tough to get much better than this.  I'd recommend it highly as a part of
any "hey, the Amiga really is cool" live demonstration.

The directory takes just about zero time to get up and running.  Nice work.

Complaints?  Well, the screen mode it tries to put you in (if you take
advantage of all of the preference-setup icons offered) is Pal High Res
Laced.  Need I point out how painful this is to look at, particularly with
the color choices they've made?  It's just bad news.

The CD is available at a reasonable price and is a great catchall
collection.  Highly recommended.

                Review: Amiga CD Sensation: Demos R 4-Ever
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Not to be confused with the "<blank> Sensations CD" line from Epic
Marketing, this title comes from Stefan Ossowski's Schatztruhe but the name
tells it all.  This CD is demos, demos, demos.  Over 2,000 of them, in
fact, making this a huge collection of the collective wisdom and experience
of demo coders on the Amiga.

The organization on the CD is structured but not as helpful as I would have
liked.  AGA-only demos are separated into their own directory of
ready-to-run files and the rest of the ready-to-run demos are alphabetized
in "Big Bunch", over 200 megs of demos.  Ouch.  DMS-compressed demos or
those requiring special disk consideration are in the Diskstuff directory,
which is further divided up by category, including AGA-only.

Special types of demos, intros and "minis" (those under 50k, but not
necessarily 40k or 4k competition demos because those are elsewhere) are
partitioned off as well.  Demos entered at party competitions have their
own storage space as well.

The CD has three quick setup icons, which configure your assigns (to use
the on-disc utilities such as DMS), colors, and workbench screen to what is
ostensibly the optimal configuration for viewing demos.  What that means,
of course, is PAL.

Rounding out the set is a music directory with a few treats, and a handful
of slideshows, as well as a collection of Degrader-type tools to make
navigating the CD's contents on anything but stock A500 and A1200s
possible.

As a collection, I'd have to rate this quite highly.  I'm always a sucker
for creative work preserved indefinitely for low cost.  The actual use of
the CD could have been so much better, though.  While each demo comes with
a readme file to indicate what degrader measures must be taken to get the
demo to work, it does not make any effort to do them for you.  Having just
reviewed AGA Experience 2, which does go that extra mile, I can't speak so
glowingly about this collection.  Also, while the Diskstuff directory does
separate out a few choice demos for those looking for a good demo in a
hurry, the rest of the demos are not at all ranked by quality.  A few more
highlights would have been appreciated.

The packaging is certainly memorable.  Rather than coming as a boring jewel
box, they've tried to make it look like a covermounted CD on a magazine.
Actually, it's just a piece of cardboard that's roughly magazine sized,
with the CD's information on the back, but it's the thought that counts.
This has the downside that all you get is a sealed plastic sleeve with your
CD instead of a full jewel box.  Hope you have one handy, or are a big fan
of CD wallets.

If you need a demo CD and haven't already picked up Euroscene 2 or the
Aminet collections, give this some consideration.  It's more comprehensive
than AGA Experience 2, but unfortunately not as easy to use.

                         Review: Spherical Worlds
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

While Ken Anderson takes a quick break, it's my turn to review some games
again.  Enter Spherical Worlds, from the 4Matted development team,
produced by NEO of Austria.

I suppose the quickest way to describe Spherical Worlds is as a roughly
Alien Breed (I, II, and Tower Assault) genre of game.  You control a
player, in this case a spherical battle droid, and steer it around in a
top-down world, shooting bad guys, avoiding traps and collecting money and
keys so you can open doors and buy items.

This, in a nutshell, is the game.  But if you insist on the plot, I'll fill
you in.  Basically, it's you against an unknown alien force on a planet
which sounds a lot like the planet from Alien.  That's about all you need
to know.

You'll be going up against the terrain as well as the bad guys, as there
are plenty of opportunities to fall down holes and your droid does NOT
maneuver very well.  It takes a while to get it going, and seemingly even
longer to slow it down.  As such, you'll take lots of headers off the
screen until you get the hang of the game, and even though there is the
option to continue, you don't always get to start back on the same level.

You are initially armed with an unlimited-ammo (but limited auto) machine
gun of some power and a small supply of homing rockets that can fire over
walls and doors to hit individual targets.  You can buy more goods as the
game progresses.

And the best part is, you can figure all of this out without documentation.
I did, because my documentation came only in German.  Oops.

Graphically, the game is not a stunning tour-de-force but the action is at
least very crisp.  Music and sound is acceptable.  The game is not
AGA-enhanced but at the very least seems to be compatible on just about any
configuration you can throw at it (no problems whatsoever installing to
hard drive and playing off of 040 machines).  It even works on the
Cyberstorm 1260, providing you disable the special 060 caches.

One of the standouts of Spherical Worlds is the rather nice rendered intro
that accompanies the game, as well as the (Alien Breed inspired, perhaps?)
pretty level-transition pictures shown as you await your next challenge in
the game.

Spherical Worlds isn't the 3D-pounding intensity that a lot of software
developers have been trying to pump out lately.  In fact, it's a nice
breather.  While I wouldn't say the game is a sleeper, you definitely have
time, at least early on, to plan out your strategy.  When you get sloppy,
that's when you start plummeting to your death, or forgetting that the
floor panel you're crossing is so unstable you need to speed up or else...

My only complaints are few.  The control system may be clumsy for a reason,
but it makes getting started very difficult.  Having only three lives is
pretty harsh considering you can easily lose them all before reaching the
third level, just by falling to your death around various corners.  But
Spherical Worlds is a job well done.

      Review: Bandits On the Information Superhighway by Dan Barrett
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Ok, we'd better get this out of the way.  I know it was my first question
about the book and I'm sure a lot of other people feel the same way, so
here goes.

No, BLAZEMONGER is not listed in the index of the book, but yes, it is
mentioned.

There.  Now that's out of the way...

Dan Barrett undertook a fairly major task that any normal mortal would have
most likely screwed up.  That is, in 200 pages or so, tackle a serious
issue of modern society without confusing the novice audience or insulting
the experienced audience, explaining enough basics to keep novices in line
and, above all else, not turning the book into a reference for those who
seek to constrict access on the net.

It all works out.  Dan takes readers through the net and the possible
pitfalls and scams users can wind up getting caught in--including some of
the more exaggerated fallacies of the net.  Little time is wasted throwing
out just some of the potential sources of trouble for net users, such as
the general lack of privacy for most data transmission.  Also discussed
early on is the distinct possibility that just about anything you read
online has a measurable probability of being a complete fabrication done
for amusement or for illicit profit.  That out of the way, Dan moves into
more specific areas of danger, such as how to keep information secure (or
at least to understand the potential risks of allowing it to be public),
how to (somewhat) safely make purchases on the net, and how to eyeball
potential scams and fake messages.  (Of particular note is the spoofed Bill
Gates announcement of the cancellation of Word.)

A lot of what Dan says here you could easily have learned somewhere else
under a different name, or under different circumstances.  (Pyramid schemes
are bad.  Be extremely careful when 1-900 numbers get involved.  Don't give
away your password to anybody ever never ever.)  But Dan gives other
valuable information, such as a lengthy discourse on spamming vs.
crossposting (and how the latter, while it can be annoying to some, is not
a bandwidth or drive-space hog).  And, although many of us already realize
that you can't get a virus or format your hard drive just by reading a
piece of E-mail, Dan states in black and red that no, there is no such
thing as a Good Times virus.

When Dan tackles the more personal side of the net--actually meeting,
befriending, and possibly even romancing people online--things do get a bit
dicey, because he's dealing with people who have actually been very hurt
and violated through such experiences but at the same time doesn't want to
scare anybody away or turn them into paranoid maniacs.  You wind up doing a
lot of emotional bouncing in that section of the book.

The book gets into methods for users to help themselves if they've been
scammed, and wraps up with a (somewhat self-serving, I feel, for the
panelists involved) panel discussion section discussing the future of the
net and the security and safety of it.

Interspersed through the entire book are both real-life and concocted
examples of what to look for (and what to avoid), as well as quotes from
various knowledgeable people and actual anecdotal experiences, which all
give the book a very nice touch.  On the whole, while the book didn't tell
me volumes that I hadn't learned from being on the net for a few years, it
does have a lot of useful reference material.  For beginners, or for those
who are misinformed about the real risks of the net (and by that, I mean
those who think it's a den of iniquity for nobody but crooks and scam
artists all out to steal your soul), I'd say it's a required read.

(Oh, yes.  While the book is hardly Amiga-specific, we do get the
occasional mention in a friendly, contextual way.)

===========================================================================
                 Review: Video Backup System 3.2 from LSP
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Ask me--or just about anyone else--what the most important thing you can do
with your hard drive is, and they'll tell you it's to make frequent
backups.

And what's the thing that so few people actually do?  Yes, the same.  Let's
face it...making backups is a pain.  You can back up to a big old stack of
floppies...but this is very tedious for any sizable amount of data.  You
can back up to a tape drive or removable media drive like a Zip...which
isn't quite as bad, but that's an extra hardware cost for a lot of people.

Enter the concept of Video Backup.  Lots of us computer enthusiasts have
purchased a VCR at SOME point in our lives.  And videotapes are
significantly less expensive than a Zip cartridge.  So, even though they're
a bit bulky, why not put them to good use?

The VBS comes as three components.  The sole floppy disk contains the VBS
software for both 68000 and 68020+ Amigas.  A standard double-male RCA
cable is included for connecting your Amiga's composite video output
(standard on some machines, or requiring an A520 adapter on others) to your
VCR, and a special serial port device with two male RCA leads connects to
both a video monitor and your VCR's video out.  (Neat, huh?)

VBS' interface is easy enough to use on a high res (non-laced) video
screen, although the 1702 I was forced to use made it just a tad blurrier
than I would have liked.  (It was also a bit too low on the screen.)  The
short of it is that you can select to back up any number of files from the
hard drive partition of your choice onto video cassette.  The software
visually represents the programs (which looks quite interesting on your
monitor) and the display is recorded by the VCR.  The tape can be stored
more or less indefinitely, and can be restored to any other partition or
device you choose at a later date.

VBS will help you keep track of your backups by creating log and report
files recording the files stored on video.  You can use counter references
to find the correct area of your tape for each backup (the program puts a
short title before the actual program code so you can scan through the tape
visually if necessary.

The process of making a backup does take a little getting used to.  Since
VBS cannot actually control your VCR, you have to hit record on your VCR
and then commit to the backup by clicking the mouse, after VBS goes through
its preparatory steps for creating backups.  With just a bit of practice,
you'll be able to use VBS to backup at any time by using its timer feature
in conjunction with the one on your VCR.  Obviously, this is useful if you
can't watch the Amiga all day.

Restoring backups is a bit more confusing.  VBS stores the directory tree
data at the start of the recording.  VBS reads this information off of the
tape when you want to restore it, but because of the way the video monitor
is set up, VBS can't actually TELL you when it has all of the info it
needs.  (The documentation leads me to believe that you can, but I'm not
clear on it.)  So after a few seconds of playback, you need to stop the
tape and return to the VBS screen to select the files for recovery.  After
rewinding the tape a bit (just to be sure, in case you overshot the mark),
you can commence the restoration.

Floppy backups are possible--VBS will even store them track-by-track, so
presumably you could store your demo collection on VHS.  (Of course, you
may get better mileage just recording your demos...)

On a 68020, you can compress data and get on average 85 megs per hour of
videotape.  (While I've heard of using the tapes in LP mode, I chose to go
with SP for my review.)  This puts a $2 VHS tape at about 170 megs of
storage--better than a ZIP or EZ135 disk that costs several times more and
holds less.  On the other hand, these drives communicate with your Amiga in
hundreds of k per seconds.  At 85 megs per hour, the VBS is significantly
slower.  Cost versus convenience, isn't that always the way?

In my tests of VBS, involving backing up both binary and text files from
one drive and restoring on another, I had absolutely zero hitches, in both
Fast and Compressed mode.  If anything is going to convince me to do
backups, this will.

Speed aside, the only minus to the VBS is the length of the two cables on
the serial device.  You need to have your computer, monitor, and VCR all
VERY close to each other.  My Toshiba TIMM was absolutely useless for this
package, it was just too big to get the cables around.  (They're roughly 3
feet in length)  Of course, the same goes for a Zip or EZ135, but they're
smaller.

The provided manual is sufficient, but if I ran the world I would have laid
it out a bit differently, categorizing by "Backup" and "Restore", rather
than by "Disk" (floppy) and "File".  It's usable.

LSP's Video Backup System is about the cheapest way I can think of to
reliably back up your hard drives--and it really does work.  Physically,
it's a bit of a pain, and it will require you to have some sort of
composite-out capabilities (For 3000 users, a special video board is
available) as well as to boot your machine in a video configuration.  I
strongly recommend you consider this an alternative to removable media if
backups are your priority.

                        Amiga Report Mailing List
===========================================================================

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to majordomo@amigalib.com

Your subject header will be ignored.  In the body of the message, enter

subscribe areport

The system will automatically pull your e-mail address from the message
header.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!             **

                          UUDecoding Amiga Report
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

===========================================================================
                      Amiga Report Writing Guidelines
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

     4.  Please send us your article in ASCII format.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.

Please stipulate as well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to
the editor.

                  Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users
===========================================================================

                The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
                  "Not just another UNIX Shell account!"

          -------------------------------------------------------

Portal is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-service online SIG
(Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users.  We promise, and WE
DELIVER ongoing & aggressive Amiga support!  Now, more than ever, with so
many Amiga magazines gone or shrunken, you need a viable,
professionally-maintained resource for information, software, and a link to
the world-wide Amiga community.

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in many ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA high-speed modems (you pay for the phone call
if it's not local), or though any SprintNet or Compuserve indial anywhere
(with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell service!  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help, and you can easily customize
it for your favorite terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1100 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files or
      100 email letters at once, of any size, with one command.
 * Amiga vendor areas with many companies participating.
 * So many incoming lines you'll probably NEVER get a busy signal
 * 40 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 12,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.
 * Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
      related and get quick replies from the experts.
 * Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, AMosaic, LightWave, ImageFX,
      Picasso II & others feed right into the Zone message bases.  Read
      months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with them.
 * FREE unlimited Internet Email with 5 meg of free storage.
      Your email is private, secure, and never censored or monitored.
 * A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.
      You can run AMosaic and other Browses via your shell and explore the
      vast World Wide Web!  Intermediate to advanced users can use
      any standard UNIX mail and news utilities, compilers, and other
      tools.  Ask for your free UNIX book when you sign up.
 * A home for your own Web page!  Your UNIX Shell on Portal is linked
      to Portal's Web Server. Create your own WWW pages for the whole
      world to access. No extra charges!
 * Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which you can read
      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine. Newsgroups are not censored!
 * Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
      never worry "Ooops... Am I paying more for this area?" again!
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS wrapped into user-friendly
      menus.  And you get FREE unlimited usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
      email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
 * Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
      at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
