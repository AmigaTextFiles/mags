<p><b>REVIEW</b>

<p>CED is one of the oldest Editors still available for Amiga.  To celebrate
the 10th anniversary new version of CygnusEd was released.  The original
author Bruce Dawson gave the sources to Olaf Barthel to continue the
development what can easily be called one of the best editors there is and
ever will be.  I personally remember using CED back in the 80's when it was
one of the pioneering editors and at that time it was by far the best.  The
development was discontinued 1994 because of piracy but now it is time to
try again.

<p>The program has stayed pretty much the same.  It is as good as it was
before and then some.  It is mentioned in the documentation that developers
wanted to release the new version as soon as possible withouth further
delays which would have been required for major redesign.  So everything
that was there before is still there.  The GUI has been rewritten to
accommodate modern day design specifications.  This ofcourse doesnt include
the main text edit view since there is only just that, edit view.
Search/replace windows have been redesigned so they look a bit more modern.
Menus and everything else are now font sensitive.  Propably biggest single
change is that CED now requires OS 2.04 or newer.  On the other hand it
still works even with 68000 with 512k memory, which is quite remarkable
nowadays for a professional program.  One really good thing to come out of
the changes mentioned below is that the main view is AppWindow.  You can
just drag and drop documents on to it.

<p>There are numerous smaller changes and fixes all over the code.  Only some
new additions have been made, although I think the best must be the great
online documentation describing everything you need, although I find CED to
be extremely selfevident not needing lenghty consultations to the manual. 
Other additions include better and clearer Arexx support, code
optimizations (still possible?), already mentioned AppWindow and AppIcon,
memory pools..  lots of them but nevertheless quite small overall.

<p>One of the changes I personally would have wanted was little less exentric
menu tree.  I've always found the menu a bit odd, with settings where you
would expect editing commands and stuff like this.  I guess this is all
just heritage from the 80's.  As the amount and scale of the changes
reflect you can expect more updates in the future.  As already mentioned
this new version was pushed out as quickly as possible and updates are
promised in the form of patch files.

<p>Being what it is CED has contributed to a many MANY software projects
during its 10 year lifespan and it is only appropriate to add some of the
programs to the CD.  You can find many programs which have been written
partly or fully using CED in one drawer on the CD.  This is kind of nice
touch to celebrate the anniversary of the program.  I just hope people
won't kill the program again by not buying it.  Make yourself a favour and
buy the software its worth it.

<p><b>DOCUMENTATION</b>

<p>Provided as extensive on-line amigaguide help.

<p><b>LIKES</b>

<p>Fastest editor there is. Great online documentation.

<p><b>DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS</b>

<p>The same menu structure as in the previous version.  I really dont see the
logic behind it, but since this is the first update, maybe there will be
different one someday.

<p><b>BUGS</b>

<p>None found.

<p><b>CONCLUSION</b>

<p>VERY fast and does exactly what it is supposed to do: Edit text.  More
changes would have been nice, but they are coming in the future.
