<p>Following the success of the debut volume of the Catalyzer for ImageFX
tutorial series, Legacy Maker, Inc. of Chicago, IL is pleased to announce
Volume 2 of Catalyzer for ImageFX, its latest videotape product for Amiga
computers.

<p><font size=+3>ImageFX is the engine.</font>
<br><font size=+2>Your Amiga's tank is full of gas.</font>
<br><font size=+1>This video is the Catalyzer.</font>

<p>Learn about the power and secrets of ImageFX from one of its most
reknowned experts.  <b>Bohus Blahut</b>, whose ImageFX knowledge is so extensive
Nova Design entrusted him with the creation of their latest ImageFX demo
tape, guides you through various compositing projects on this one hour
videotape.

<p><font size=+1><b>Catalyzer 2: Compositing</b></font> explores ImageFX through project-based tutorials,
beginning with an introduction to getting great results using simple brush
cut-and-paste operations.  The tape progresses to more advanced topics to
help you generate stunning effects: complex merges, alpha channel effects,
bluescreening and even rotoscoping to allow you to pull a subject out of
any background!  By the time the credits roll, you'll be ready to go to
work.

<p>Catalyzer 2: Compositing covers techniques for ImageFX 2 and 3.0, including
a special look at 3.0's advanced CineMatte engine.

<p>Kermit Woodall, VP of Nova Design, says Catalyzer is <i>"An amazing tutorial
video for ImageFX!  It taught me things I didn't know about our own
software!"</i>

<p>Catalyzer 2 For ImageFX includes a support floppy disk with all the
material you'll need to follow along with the videotape, including example
images, ARexx scripts, even the same font.
