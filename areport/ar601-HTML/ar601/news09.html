<p><b>About Aural Synthetica:</b>

<p>Aural Synthetica is a software sound creation program based around the
modular synthesizers popular in the 1960's.  A modular synthesizer works in
any way you want it to, it is limited only by your imagination.

<p>Aural Synthetica being based in software brings the benefits of digital
technology without losing the analogue functions you would expect.  You can
create your own waveforms and morph between them if you wish, you can also
make use of logic functions and bandwidth controls.  Best of all Aural
Synthetica does not go out of tune - unless that is you want it to.  Aural
Synthetica can do one thing that was impossible on modular systems - you
can save your setup and reload it at any time.

<p>Aural Synthetica is a very complex program but to make life easier there
are preset "Basic Synthesizer" setups built into the program, these are
comprised of a number of pre-connected modules and you are free to change
the settings as much as you wish.

<p>Aural Synthetica renders samples at CD quality and these can then be saved
in the following formats: IFF, AIFF, WAV, MAUD and SAFF.
