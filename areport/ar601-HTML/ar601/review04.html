<p><b>What is a Video Turtle?</b>

<p>The Video Turtle from Turtle Enterprises is a device that allows you to
view the AGA/ECS NTSC modes of your Amiga on an S-Video capable television
set.  Oh, I know what you're thinking, "ah, another A520-type device", but
that would be dead wrong.  The Video Turtle has little in common with the
old A520, especially when it comes to picture quality.  The Video Turtle
consists of a small box that has a 9-pin RGB input and a 9v DC power supply
connection on one end, and an S-Video port on the other.  The power for the
unit is supplied by the Amiga's video port, so there's no need for a
separate power supply.  Installation of the Video Turtle is simply a matter
of hooking up the cable (a wide variety of cables are available) to your
Amiga's 23-pin video port and then plugging the other end into the Turtle's
RGB input and power supply ports.  The S-Video cable is plugged into the
other end of the Turtle and to your television's S-Video port.  No
additional software or drivers are needed.

<p><b>What the heck is S-Video?</b> 

<p>S-Video is an enhancement to the normal NTSC television picture we've all
become accustomed to.  S-Video provides vast improvements in the number of
lines of resolution, as well as better clarity and color in the viewable
picture.  Of course, the newer the television set, the higher the
resolution and clarity should be.  You also get a larger viewing area by
using an S-Video television and the Video Turtle, compared to a monitor.

<p><b>How does it look -- bottom line?</b>

<p>Let's sum up how the output looks from the Video Turtle in a single word:
outstanding!  I honestly wasn't expecting as much as I got from the Turtle.

<p>I ran everything from my Workbench screen to Scala and Pac Man on my RCA
27" television.  The overall picture quality was very good, as was the
sharpness and detail.  The only adjustment that I had to make was in the
television's contrast.  Lowering the contrast actually made the output look
better, at least to my eyes.

<p>Running the Scala demos on the 27" screen really was impressive.  The
colors were sharp and distinct.  Workbench looked great too -- well, as
good as it can look in NTSC Hi-Res Laced with 16 colors.  Playing that old
classic Pac Man on my big screen made it seem almost new.

<p><b>Is the Video Turtle for real?</b>

<p>Yes, the Video Turtle is for real.  Anyone who has a need for displaying
NTSC screenmodes on a larger screen would be well advised to seriously look
into the Video Turtle.  If you are looking to replace your old 1084 monitor
then you should consider the Turtle and an S-Video television as a viable
alternative to purchasing another cheap monitor.

<p>Anyone who is into doing video presentations will love this device.  In
about 30 seconds you can have the Turtle hooked up and stun your audience
with a great looking large-screen display of your work.

<p>The Video Turtle isn't limited to just Amiga use.  You can hook virtually
any device that outputs a 15.75 kHz.  signal to the Turtle.   Any video
game console that doesn't already have an S-Video output should be
compatible.  Forget about all that RF interference from those junky
modulators that come with most game consoles -- the Turtle will totally
eliminate it.

<p>The Video Turtle is priced at $149.95 and comes with a 30-day 
money back guarantee. This is a lot of money, and I hope that the
price will come down in the future. If you already own an S-Video
capable television, then there wouldn't be any additional cost
incurred. The other alternatives to the Video Turtle are the A520, and
flicker fixers. The A520 goes for about $15, and you definitely get
what you pay for with this option -- not much.  A flicker fixer would
probably be a good choice if you wanted to take advantage of all the
cheap VGA monitors that are so abundant in the clone world.  A flicker
fixer would set you back about $125-$225 (new, depending on brand and
features), and there is even a unit available that will output to S-Video
too.
