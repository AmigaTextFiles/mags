<p>Langen/Oberursel, Germany, March 9th, 1998 - AMIGA International, Inc.  and
phase 5 digital products today announced that they have signed a license
agreement for the AMIGA OS 3.1 which will allow phase 5 to use AMIGA OS 3.1
in future products.

<p>"We are glad to see that with phase 5 digital products another important
developer and manufacturer in the AMIGA market shows his commitment towards
the AMIGA OS 3.1", says Petro Tyschtschenko of AMIGA International, Inc.
"As phase 5 has led the development of PowerPC products for the AMIGA, this
is an important agreement which will give a momentum to the future
development of AMIGA and AMIGA-compatible systems, an expectation which is
also supported by the cooperation of the different licensees of our AMIGA
technology", he adds.

<p>The license agreement will allow phase 5 digital products to use AMIGA OS
3.1 in future products and thus expand the PowerUP product line by
stand-alone systems; as a logical step, the company has immediately
announced the development of such an independent computer system.  "We are
very glad that we have been able to negotiate an agreement which allows us
to spend significant efforts into this new project, and we appreciate the
support of AMIGA International, Inc.  and especially Petro Tyschtschenko
for our project", said Wolf Dietrich, General Manager of phase 5 digital
products."This partnership shows the committment to the AMIGA and is an
important signal for the future of the system.
