<p>The Amiga RC5 Team effort is proud to announce the availability of the
PowerPC version of the RC5-64 client, which boosts performance by a
magnitude compared to the conventional 68k client available hitherto.  This
also signals a new era as Amiga PowerPC software is emerging to show the
way to the future of alternative computing.

<p>The Amiga RC5 Team effort seeks to harness the enthusiasm of the Amiga
community and thus bring exposure to the platform and its re-emergence in
the hands of Gateway 2000 by competing in the RSA Secret Key Challenge
contest: to break the RC5-64 key..  The team is currently ranked 7th
overall out of over 12000 teams, thereby showing the vitality of the
community.

<p>If you haven't heard of the effort, are interested in encryption and
safety, would like to utilize your computing power to its fullest, or
simply want to help the Amiga, you are more than welcome to visit the
effort homepage at below address.

<p>The Amiga RC5 Team effort is also providing a mailinglist as a forum for
the discussion on above topics and the effort in general.

<p>For additional info on how to participate and more in depth explanation,
