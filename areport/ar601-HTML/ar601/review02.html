<p>When I first reviewed Uropa2 almost a year ago, it was a just another
shareware title on Aminet.  However, I raved about it, and everyone else
raved about it too.  Now Vulcan have signed up Austex and taken on Uropa2
as the second title in their "Megaseries", and it's better than ever.

<p>The game is a slightly odd combination of isometric arcade-adventure and 3D
vector shoot'em'up.  Cast as a floating dustbin (apparently a robot, but
I'm not qualified in these things), ten separate missions are waiting to be
completed; complicated missions at that, usually involving at least three
separate tasks.  These tasks are set in space bases, the interiors of which
are presented in the isometric (corner-on) graphics, whilst travelling
between bases is carried out the vector graphic representation.

<p>When inside, you roam about alongside colonists and other robots, searching
the surroundings for trivia and objects vital to your mission.  Engaging in
fights with other robots offers the reward of data if you win, which can
then be sold on.  Computers are available to be accessed, extra weapons can
be bought and there's a lot to be seen and done.  Colonists can be bossed
around by shouting orders at them; luckily, one of the options is a request
that they "get out of here!", as they tend to get in your way when you're
being chased by a mental rival dustbin.  Despite all this aggression, the
pace inside the bases is sedate, with no real test of reflexes or
co-ordination, other than the slightly stodgy controls.

<p>Once outside, you're thrown into arcade mode, which brings the game into
real arcade mode.  Roaming around the surface, shooting things and getting
lost isn't nearly as taxing on the grey matter as the interior scenes, but
it's much more fun, if a tad limited.  There's also the now-obligatory
two-player linkup option for private battles.

<p>Refreshingly these days, the space and freedom that CD-ROM brings has been
used to brilliant and productive effect.  All of the computer screens are
accompanied by a sample voice narrating the text for you (the computer
voice is Vulcan Software's Lisa Tunnah).  Most of the information and
communication that can be read is also available in aural format; Vulcan's
Paul Carrington doing a fine job in this capacity, injecting character and
often humour into the text.

<p>There's a couple of niggles which could do with being tidied up: the
default location for saved games is on the CD, and you cannot load a saved
game from the main game menu - a new game must be started and then the
saved game reloaded.  There's been more than one occasion where the left
mouse button recognition has stopped working.

<p>Uropa2 is a brave mix of genres; the two different paces of gameplay carry
the risk of clashing with each other and alienate (sic) a player who enjoys
one type of game but not the other.  However, Uropa2 carries it off
brilliantly.  The plot development is intriguing, the action is paced
finely, and the atmosphere that the use of speech creates is enveloping. 
Unless you really hate isometric or vector games, I'd recommend this superb
blend of both, and set aside some spare time to be entranced.

<p><font color="0000ff"><b>Pros:</b></font> Lovely depth of play and character.  The graphics and sound inject
superb atmosphere (the latter especially so).  Lots to do and see; very
good value for money.

<p><font color="ff0000"><b>Cons:</b></font> Could be a bit cerebral for some, and many will become hopelessly
stuck very quickly.  Controls take some getting used to, and there's the
odd glitch that could do with being patched.

<p>Uropa2 is priced at 29.99UKP, and can be ordered from:
