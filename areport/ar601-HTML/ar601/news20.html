<p><font size=+1><b>Siamese Systems ltd launch budget Siamese RTG package on CD-ROM from April.</b></font>

<p>Due to requests from many potential customers who want to see what the
Siamese system v2.5 can do before parting with their money, we have decided
to launch the new "Siamese Remote Amiga v2.1" package for only ( UK 29.95
pounds, Germany 79.95dm, USA $49.95 ).  This can be used as a full Serial
based system in its own right, or evaluated and then part exchanged for the
full "Siamese V2.5 Pro" package, by paying the diference.

<p>This software is based on the Siamese v2.5 software but without the TCP/IP
( Internet / Ethernet ) capabilities, and uses a normal null modem serial
cable (not supplied) for connection.  The software supports serial speeds
up to 115,200 bps on a standard AGA Amiga serial connection.  This version
of the Siamese system also supports Cybergraphics screen modes but please
remember when using 16bit graphics over a serial line it is not as quick as
the Ethernet version which is up to 50 times faster.

<p>Main features of "Siamese Remote Amiga v2.1" CD-ROM.

<br>1.  Supports all serial speeds available to both the Amiga and PC,
standard maximum is 115200 bps.
<br>2.  Supports third party Amiga and PC high speed serial cards.
<br>3.  Remote control Amiga from PC, most RTG friendly Amiga screens appear
in a Window on Win95/NT4.
<br>4.  Single Keyboard and Mouse control for both Amiga and PC.
<br>5.  Works on Intel and Alpha processors. ( Alpha needs FX32! )
<br>6.  PC drives are accessible from standard AGA Amiga with up to 13kbytes
per second.
<br>7.  Supports SCSI networking to speed up file transfer ( 1mb/sec ) with
suitable controllers on the PC and Amiga.
<br>8.  Emulates Cybergraphics screen modes, remember bitmaps will transfer
at serial speed.
<br>9.  Can be part exchanged for Siamese v2.5 Professional, (TCP/IP
Ethernet version 99.95 pounds.)
<br>10.  Special WinUAE set up files to transfer your WB3 to a WinUAE
environment by using Sisys MountPC.
<br>11.  Will create ideal "Real Amiga" and "WinUAE Amiga" giving the best
of both worlds.
<br>12.  Great for creating the Amiga floppy disk files for WinUAE

<hr><br>

<p>Many people who have shown interest in the Siamese v4 PCI Amiga have asked
if the deposit scheme could be made part of the Siamese v2.5 package.

pounds sterling plus P&P direct from Siamese systems ltd before April 30th
and we will put 50.00 pounds towards your deposit on the Siamese v4 system.
