<p>Everybody loves a good Amiga show.

<p>On March 13-15, Amigan St. Louis held the Amiga '98 convention at the
Harley Hotel.  The venue was the same as last year, as were the people
running the show--Bob and Diana Scharp, who recently took over the show
from the St. Louis user group in order to run it as a private organization,
giving them better control over the weekend.  It paid off, as this year's
event felt better organized.

<p>I came down to the show with Legacy Maker, Inc. to hawk our wares, but of
course I was there as a reporter, trying to keep up with everyone and
everything present.  That's impossible, and I will, as always, forget
someone I really wanted to mention.

<p>The first day of the show was intended for seminars, intended largely for
developers.  I missed this--our schedule didn't allow us to make it before
Friday night.  We expected to go through the usual ritual--find out which
of our friends have arrived, what plans they had, and try to find something
fun to do Friday night.  Last year, that was the Waffle House, so this year
we made a pact not to repeat that experience.  Ever.

<p>Luckily, Amiga Inc. came to our rescue.  In perhaps the single best (and
perhaps single, period) PR move they've made, they held a buffet for show
exhibitors and VIPs.  The entertainment consisted of an open bar and a
passable Blues Brothers lip sync act, and it's too bad people didn't get
into it as much as they should have.  But the crowd wasn't much for
dancing...

<p>While I wouldn't describe the show as "routine" it was roughly par for the
course as far as content of an American Amiga show: a mixture of
high-influence developers, new companies with potential, a few big
retailers and an assortment of small dealers and swap tables where you can
find that particular old game or gadget you won't find anywhere else.

<p>In no particular order, and again allowing for the inevitable omissions I
always make, with no promise of completeness, at the show you could find
people like...

<p><b>Paul Nolan and Siamese Systems:</b> Paul gets mentioned first because I forgot
about him entirely in my last show report.  Paul wasn't very happy about
this and rubbed it in a great deal over the course of the weekend.  Paul is
a young, vindictive man.

<p>He's also pretty brilliant, and his revisions of the Siamese PC/Amiga
hybrid software are getting better and better.  His demo of Photogenics Ng
(name still subject to change) was quite impressive.  It's going to be a
very fast, very fun paint-effects program.  Paul figured out that nobody
else in the computer industry at large can make a very good paint-effects
program.  "The Photoshop people have it all wrong" he said, or words to
that effect.  We shall see.  Hanging around Paul Nolan was Bill
Panagouleas, who was instrumental in getting Pyromania, a CD series full of
explosion animations (good for low-budget special effects) converted to an
Amiga-friendly format.

<p><i>[ At one point we thought Paul was going to sell us his
socks, but no such luck...  -- Katie ]</i>

<p><b>Amiga Inc.:</b> There were two things you could do at Amiga Inc.'s area.
<br>1. Admire Joe Torre's levitating boing ball device.
<br>2. Yell at Amiga, Inc.

<p><b>Newtek:</b> An uncharacteristically low-key presence by anyone's standards.
Newtek had a table or two with monitors running pretty "Made with
Toaster/Flyer and/or Lightwave Systems" demos, and a few people who
generally talked up the Amiga in a way last year's crew (who had a nicer
looking but more Lightwave-on-Alpha focused booth) didn't.  They gave away
something like 100 copies of Lightwave 5 for the Toaster, which won them a
lot of bonus points.

<p><b>Amazing Computing:</b> Don Hicks and his flashing Christmas mini-lights were
back in St. Louis for the fun.  Don's a very hands-on editor when it comes
to dealing with the people, which he'd have to be since Amazing is such an
institution.

<p><b>The Informer:</b> Less of an institution with only a baker's dozen issues in
print, but still influential, editor Fletcher Haug and the journeyman
Informer magazine were very politically situated across the hall.  

<p><b>Dan's Deals:</b> Dan Greathouse is a wonderful guy.  He's Legacy Magazine's
number 1 fan, no question about it, and all of us at Legacy Maker tried to
thank him for it.

<p><b>Digital Quill:</b> Not the text editor published by Finale, but Chris Holt's
Amiga-gear business.  Amiga-badged clothing and goodies are a big business
now, and Chris is cashing in, with racing shirts, ties, mugs, and a lot of
other stuff.  He was quite busy...

<p>...as was the distinctive <b>Robert Hamilton</b>, with his collection of Amiga
wear, ranging from the on-the-edge "claw-boing" shirt of legend to more
conventional shirts and sweatshirts.  Soccer shorts coming soon.

<p><b>Gamasoft:</b> Representing Finale Development at the show.  Unable to answer
the question "Where's Finale Web Cruiser?"

<p><b>Nordic Global:</b> I know he put a lot of work into Miami, but it was enough to
make anyone green with envy to see people just walking up to Holger Kruse
fighting to hand over however much money he wanted.  I did it too. :)

<p><b>SoftLogik:</b> Mostly there to sell the latest version of PageStream, it's not
too far of a trip for the SoftLogik folks to get to the St. Louis show.
Had there been a prize for the biggest credit card-taking equipment,
SoftLogik would have won hands down with their 20+ year old card
imprinter/adding machine.

<p><b>Wonder Computers:</b> Wonder packed as many employees and merchandise as would
fit into a big Cadillac and drove down from Ottawa to attend the event.
You'd be surprised how much can fit in a big Cadillac.

<p><b>National Amiga:</b> National didn't drive a Caddy but they brought even more
stuff.  More importantly, they sold most of it, evident by the glee they
took in their very short cleanup after the show.

<p><b>Nova Sector Engineering:</b> The company promising a lot in the Amiga clone
department but presently only delivering rebuilt A4000T motherboards.  I
still want to see more.

<p><b>WeemsWare:</b> They had probably the best kick in my malaise I've seen.  Called
Lips, it's a program that animates mouth movement along with input piped
through the narrator.device.  Why?  Well, first off for fun, but more
practically so you can dub over the Amiga with your own speech, leaving the
mouth making the proper motions.  Very, very cute.

<p><b>Haage and Partner:</b> Not represented by a table, but director Markus Nerding
was making the rounds with great vigor.

<p><b>MagicBox:</b> Powering the show's projected event-updating system (which, BTW,
could use some revamping for next year, it was a bit tough to see over all
the people crowding around the stage), MagicBox is still doing a good
business with their flagship product of the same name, based around A1200
systems for use by cable and closed-circuit TV systems for infochannel
purposes.

<p><b>Legacy Maker:</b> And then there was us, Legacy Maker Inc.  We launched
Catalyzer Vol. 2 for ImageFX at the show to a very receptive audience, if I
do say so myself.

<p>A more complete (although not error-free) list is available on the official
show site, <a href="http://www.amiga-stl.com">http://www.amiga-stl.com</a>.

<p>The show was an interesting experience.  I've seen a range of emotions at
Amiga shows over the past few years, ranging from happiness to despair.
What I've never seen this much of was outright anger.  People were mad at
Amiga Inc.  For nearly a year of not much productive work.

<p>You'd think that would put them in a bad mood about other stuff, too, but
the sales didn't reflect it.  Most everyone I talked to (including Legacy
Maker) did substantially better at this show than at recent Amiga events.
People came mad, but they came to buy, too.

<p>It's never a good Amiga show without an adventure or escapade.  Ours came
Saturday night when the Legacy Maker folks and the Wonder folks decided to
see a little bit of St. Louis.  That was the theory, anyway.  After a nice
dinner in a small restaurant, we wanted to find something which we never
did specify--there was talk of finding a magic shop or something like that.
So we piled into the aforementioned Wonder Cadillac

<p>At any rate, while on the highway we saw a massive traffic jam in the city
below and more than one person remarked "Boy, we'd better stay away from
that."  It was around a stadium--a hockey game was letting out.

<p>Of course, we wound up right in the middle of the traffic jam.  It took
about 45 minutes to travel 4 blocks.  After that, we took the nice, scenic
route through St. Louis to get back to the hotel.

<p>Amiga '98 was quite a good show.  Next year will bring a better hotel (the
Harley Hotel in St. Louis has perhaps the slowest restaurant in the
Midwest), and presumably another enjoyable experience.
