<p><font size=+1><b>16.01.1998   TWinIFF: New Conversion Tool for PC AND Amiga from PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX</b></font>

<p>From time to time Amiga newsgroups are frequented by former Amiga users -
where the number seems to increase since the invention of UAE - as well as
people who have to deal with PCs and Amigas at work and at home, or maybe
sometimes people who accidentally have been confronted with amiga-specific
data or program CD-ROMs.

<p>A common problem of these people seems to be:

<p>How do I get these IFF-ILBM files into common PC programs ?

<p>Well, there ARE some solutions available in the PC sector.

<p>But most don't follow the IFF specifications in all parts (done differently
than e.g.  an Amiga programmer would do it ;-) or lack the ability of
handling uncompressed IFF graphics, 24 bit IFF-ILBMs or HAM6/HAM8.

<p>So I've written a small tool for the Win95/NT/Win32s characater mode (DOS
box), which allows to do all these conversions for you, resulting in a 1,
4, 8 or 24 bit Windows Bitmap (BMP) file - HAM graphics BTW will result in
a 24 bit graphics always.

<p>So, next time when you're going to send your rendered 24 bit IFF-ILBMs to
someone in the PC world you're able to supply the appropriate tool to
handle these, too...

<p>As a real multi-platform "twin", the program archive also includes a CLI
version compiled for Amigas (OS 2.04 or greater), so that you can utilize
the program from any of both platforms.

<p>That's why this SHAREWARE tool is called (T)WinIFF - you can use the same
keyfile for both platforms, then.

<p>It should be available on Aminet as soon as it goes online again - until
then, you may download it from my homepage:

<p>...and don't forget to visit the homepage itself under

<p><a href="http://home.t-online.de/home/Andreas_Kleinert/">http://home.t-online.de/home/Andreas_Kleinert/</a>

<p>Maybe this tools helps a little bit to again improve data interchange
ability between these two systems - remember:

<p>HAM8 is not "exotic", instead it's just "nearly 24 bit" :-)
