videotape product for Amiga computers.

<p>ImageFX is the engine.  Your Amiga's tank is full of gas.  This video is
the Catalyzer.  Learn about the power and secrets of ImageFX from one of
its most reknown experts.  Bohus Blahut, whose ImageFX knowledge is so
extensive Nova Design entrusted him with the creation of their latest
ImageFX demo tape, guides you through four projects on this one hour
videotape.

<p><b>Catalyzer explores ImageFX through four project-based tutorials.</b>

<p>* Stunning Region Handling
<br>* Powerful Text Effects
<br>* Warp and Swirl Animations
<br>* The secret of animating ImageFX's famous Lightning effect

<p>Catalyzer demystifies ImageFX's batch processors, AutoFX and IMP.

<p>Even Kermit Woodall, VP of Nova Design, says Catalyzer is "An amazing
tutorial video for ImageFX!  It taught me things I didn't know about our
own software!"

you'll need to follow along with the videotape.
