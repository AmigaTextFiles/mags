<p>In light of Gateway's purchase and the subsequent rekindling of the Amiga
fire in the public consciousness, OS News recently published an article
about the Amiga.  OS News will continue to cover happenings in the Amiga
world.  also new: the launch of a regular column on Linux.  This week, an
introduction to Linux and its adherents. Also, check out our daily news
for all the happenings on the OS front.  Power PC fans might also be
interested in several articles from last month's focus on Rhapsody,
Apple's UNIX-based next generation OS.

<p>OS News is an online magazine dedicated to alternative operating systems
and computing environments, and the technology driven by them.  Other
major high tech news sources are constrained by the mainstream, and can
give only scanty coverage to the most exciting aspect of computing:  the
leading edge, but OS News explores the future of computing, and since the
future is ours to create, we want our readers, the architects of that
future, to take part in the editorial process.

<p>Recently OS News has been covering Rhapsody, Java, both as a language and
an OS, the Be OS, Newton, UNIX and Linux, Lucent's Inferno, Network
Computers, information appliances, even OS/2 and DOS.  We also cover
emerging technologies and do hardware and software reviews.
