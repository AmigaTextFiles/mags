<p><font size=+1><b>Press release, MakeCD 3.1</b></font>

<p>MakeCD 3.1 is available now.  It now offers an additional Disc-At-Once
option which is available for most CD writers on the market.  Currently,
MakeCD supports DAO for Philips, Yamaha and Ricoh CD writers.  Furthermore,
all CD writers that implement the new MMC standard are supported in DAO
writing mode.  There's no DAO support for JVC, TEAC and Sony CD writers at
the moment.

<p>Customers who want to use the new Disc-At-Once feature, have to pay the
upgrade fee of 45 DM (outside Europe: 50 DM) including shipping costs.  If
they do not need the Disc-At-Once feature, the update is free and can be
downloaded from the internet.

<p>Further new features of MakeCD 3.1 are:

<br>- Completely reworked user interface
<br>- AHI support
<br>- Copy CD window
<br>- Index support on music CDs (read and write)
<br>- More powerful functions to erase CD-RWs
<br>- Support of ATAPI CD writers
<br>- Support of Panasonic CW7502

<p>At the moment, MakeCD supports about 90 different CD writers, which is
almost every model on the market.  In order to use ATAPI CD writers, an
additional ATAPI driver - e.g IDEfix97 - is required.  However, IDE/ATAPI
is way slower than SCSI and so it might well happen that the Amiga is only
able to burn in single speed when using an ATAPI CD writer.

<p>There's a slightly limited, freely distributable version of MakeCD in
internet on the MakeCD home page:
