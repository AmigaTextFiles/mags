<p><font size=+1><b>Asimware Innovations Inc. Releases MasterISO v2.0</b></font>
<br>February 27th, 1998

<p>Asimware is proud to announce today's release of MasterISO v2.0; our next
generation CD-R/RW writing software program.

<p>Building upon our years of experience in CD-ROM and CD-R software with
AsimCDFS and MasterISO v1, we have re-designed MasterISO v2.0 from the
ground up to provide an extremely stable CD-R/RW writing program. 
MasterISO v2.0 represents the input of hundreds of our users in both the
design and testing phases.  MasterISO v2.0 includes the features users have
requested, organized in a logical and easy-to-use fashion.

<p>New features in MasterISO include:
<br>* Disc-At-Once writing;
<br>* CD to CD-R/RW copying;
<br>* Full File Manager for editing directory structures;
<br>* On-the-fly writing from hard drive to CD-R/RW;
<br>* Rock Ridge and Joliet file system support;
<br>* Incremental multisession;
<br>* Jukebox support for the Elms DVL (optional);
<br>* Firmware update functionality for selected CD-R/RW drives.

<p>MasterISO v2.0 comes with a comprehensive 228 page printed manual.  This
provides an invaluable reference and guide for both the novice and expert
user alike.

<p>MasterISO's graphical user interface is completely font-sensitive, supports
Amiga screen modes and utilizes alternate language translations.  German
and Italian language files are standard.

<p>Along with the features and power of MasterISO, we are equally pleased to
announce our new suggested retail price of $89.00 (US$), or $119.00
(Canadian$).  MasterISO is an affordable addition to your CD-R/RW drive.

<p>We believe that MasterISO represents the future of CD-R/RW mastering
software for the Amiga platform.  But don't take our word for it - download
our demonstration version, from either Aminet or our WWW site, and give it
a try yourself.
