<p>It seems like the computer industry just isn't happy unless they come up
with some catchy name for some new feature every few days.  Suddenly a new
word is used and overused so much, some people seem to forget that most
people never heard of the word, or know what it means.  This happened to me
the other day when Amitrix Development announced it's AWeb v3.1 web
browser.  It had support for "JavaScript".  My first responce was "Good for
them, we definitely need one of those." My second responce was "Um, what is
JavaScript exactly?" Well, it's not like you can open the Meriam Websters
dictionary and look it up.  But I did some searching and found an online
service called the Free Online Dictionary of Computing.  It helped me know
just what it was Amitrix was trying to sell me.  So for all you people who
have been reading this paragraph waiting to here what JavaScript is
exactly, here is their definition.

<p><font size=+1>JavaScript</font>

<p>&lt;language&gt; (Formerly LiveScript) Netscape's simple, cross-platform,
World-Wide Web scripting language, only very vaguely related to Java. 
JavaScript is intimately tied to the World-Wide Web, and currently runs in
only three environments - as a server-side scripting language, as an
embedded language in server-parsed HTML, and as an embedded language run in
browsers.

<p>JavaScript may end up being more popular and entrenched than Java, due to
the current (May 1997) prevalence of its primary platform (see below), and
its ease of learning.  It has a simplified C-like syntax.  Its
functionality is currently limited, being aimed primarily at enhanced
forms, simple web database front-ends and navigation enhancements.

<p>JavaScript originated from Netscape, and for a time, only Netscape products
supported it.  Microsoft now supports it, but as a "work-a-like" called
JScript.  The resulting inconsistencies make it difficult to write
JavaScript that behaves the same in both Netscape Navigator and Microsoft
Internet Explorer.  This could be attributed to the slow progress of
JavaScript through the standards bodies.

<p>JavaScript runs "100x" slower than C, as it is purely interpreted (Java
runs "10x" slower than C code).  Netscape and allies say JavaScript is an
"open standard" in an effort to keep Microsoft from monopolising web
software as they have desktop software.  Netscape and Sun have co-operated
to enable Java and JavaScript to exchange messages and data.

<p>JavaScript should not be confused with Java, and is a Netscape, not
Sun trademark.

<p>The Free Online Dictionary of Computing can be found at
<a href="http://wfn-show.princeton.edu/foldoc/">http://wfn-show.princeton.edu/foldoc/</a>
and is one of the most extensive online dictionaries of computing I've ever seen.
