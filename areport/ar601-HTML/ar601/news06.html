<p><b>VERSION</b>

<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b>

<p>QMaster is an ARexx host which offers commands that can be accessed from
ARexx scripts.  QMaster provides commands to handle every aspect of Studio
16's cuelist files giving the ARexx programmer full control and making life
much easier for the user.

<p>The commands allow you to alter cuelist entries, tracks, preferences,
remove, add, adjust, swap, copy entries and tracks, convert files to and
from other formats, and in conjunction with other ARexx hosts you can do
automated processes, on-air organizing, connect with other programs such as
video and music editing software, databases, networks, multimedia packages
and so on, to influence the cuelist files and more.

<p>You don't have to be familar with ARexx programming to take advantage of
what QMaster can offer.  QMaster comes with several ARexx scripts that you
can use just by double clicking their icons or by starting them from
CLI/shell.  More scripts will come in the future.

<p><b>FEATURES</b>

<p>QMaster provide more than 40 commands to handle cuelists, convert times,
provide requesters, information, resource tracking and more.

<p>With QMaster you can:

<br> - create cuelist files from scratch
<br> - read/edit existing cuelist files
<br> - read/add/remove/cut/swap and alter tracks (Audio/ARexx)
<br> - read/add/remove and alter entries (Audio/ARexx)
<br> - read/alter and set preferences
<br> - load (add) and save track (TRAX) files
<br> - copy and paste tracks

<br> - add progress bars to your scripts
<br> - add informal requesters to your scripts
<br> - add file and directory requesters to your scripts
<br> - add string requesters to your scripts

<br> - get online help
<br> - invoke RESOURCE TRACKING if needed at any time

<p>and more...

<p>QMaster is written in assembler to achieve optimal speed in processing
comands and content.  QMaster has been through several weeks of
beta-testing and proves to be stable.

<p>The archive comes with several public domain ARexx scripts which you can
run from Workbench as well as from CLI:

<p>AllToAny- sets all play/rec channels to "Any"
<br>AppendCuelists - merges two cuelist files horizontally w/ grouping
<br>CMXtoCUE- converts CMX EDL to cuelist format opt. database
<br>CountCuelist   - statistic info
<br>DumpCue - dumps info about all tracks/entries in cuelist
<br>FindEntry  - search for an entry by keyword
<br>FixPaths- fixes entry paths if samples are moved on HD
<br>GroupEvents- search for keyword in events and group them
<br>ListEntries- dumps different entries used (one of each)
<br>MergeCuelists  - same as Studio 16's built-in function with extras
<br>NameToCue  - for fun, converts a string to cuelist 'letters'
<br>ReplaceEntries - search by keyword and select new from requester
<br>SampleTime - shows SMPTE time in PAL/NTSC (AUTO) for a sample
<br>StereoJukebox  - puts samples in a dir after one each other on cue
<br>StripEmpty - removes empty tracks from a cuelist file
<br>TestVideo  - test script to auto detect video system

<p>You can also find tutorial scripts that show how to use some of the comands
in QMaster.
