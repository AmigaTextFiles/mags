<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b>

<p>UltraAccounts is a home accounts program which has been designed to make
things as simple and easy to use as possible - so that even people who
don't know anything at all about keeping accounts (or using computers)
should be able to use UltraAccounts without any problems at all.

<p>Features include:

<p>- Supplied in 6 languages: English, Frangais, Deutsch, Nederlands, Italiano
& Polski.

<p>- Easy-to-use user interface.  All windows are font sensitive and fully
resizable, and all windows are multitasking (you can open and use several
windows at the same time).

<p>- Supports up to 50 seperate accounts, each with its own opening balance
and minimum & maximum amounts.  Money can be easily transferred from one
account to another.

<p>- Create up to 50 transaction tags, for grouping your transactions into
categories.  Each tag can have its own budget settings.

<p>- Full payslip support, including multiple wage configurations.  Find out
how much tax has been deducted from your wages at the touch of a button!

<p>- Standing orders and timed transfers are automatically entered into your
accounts for you.  Supports debit & credit standing orders.  Transactions
entered from these timed events can be edited or erased *without* duplicate
entries being created.

<p>- Easily pre-define the details of commonly-used transactions and
transfers, such as doing the shopping or paying the gas bill.  You no
longer have to keep re-typing all the details whenever you enter one of
these transactions.

<p>- Full graph facilities.  Produce pie, bar or line graphs, with optional
future projections.  Very useful for seeing trends, or looking for odd
peaks of income/expenditure.

<p>- Reminders.  Make sure you don't miss important events, such as
birthdays/anniversaries or bills that need paying.

<p>- Full printout facilities.  Accounts & transactions lists can be easily
printed, or saved as an ASCII file.  Graphs can also be printed.

<p>- Flexible search facilities, to help you find those elusive transactions!

<p>- Check VAT registration codes (UK only), to make sure that the people
charging you VAT are genuinely registered to charge it.

<p>- All data files are encrypted and optionally password protected, to
protect your data.

<p>- Fully configurable export formats.
