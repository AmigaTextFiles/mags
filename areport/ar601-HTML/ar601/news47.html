<p>If your Amiga has a hard-drive, and chances are that it does, then you may
be interested to know that a new version of ABackup is available.  The
author of this powerful and full-featured backup utility has informed us
that release 5.20 of the program has been uploaded to Aminet, on
Valentine's Day.  It has also been made available from the programmer's
homepage, the URL of which is
<a href="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/denis.gounelle/index_e.html">http://perso.wanadoo.fr/denis.gounelle/index_e.html</a>.

<p>This new version offers full support for removable disk systems, like
SyQuest, ZIP and Jaz units.  In these times when hard-drives are becoming
larger and larger, this lets you use such systems as large floppy disks,
So, your backup will only require a few removable disks instead of a huge
pile of floppies.  Of course, it will also be much faster.  Before using
them with ABackup, you will have to partition your removable disks with
HDToolBox (in order to create the disk's RigidDiskBlock) but this is the
only thing that may disturb ZIP and Jaz owners.

<p>May we remind you that ABackup has a very clean interface, which doesn't
require any additional library or graphical system like MUI.  It also
supports SCSI tape drives, as well as XPK libraries for optimal data
compression.  These are only a few features of ABackup : just take a look
at the program, if you want to see how much it has to offer."

<p>ABACKUP coming soon (Aminet) with an english doc in amigaguide.of course :-)
