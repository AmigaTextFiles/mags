<p>Announcement:  To All Amiga Users in the 
               
<p>Alamogordo, New Mexico
<br>Las Cruces, New Mexico
<br>El Paso, Texas

<p>areas.  

<p>If you are interested in keeping abreast of the latest Amiga developments,
increasing the utility you get out of your own system, sharing Amiga hints,
tips, and technical advice or just talking with some fellow Amiga users then 
please send the following information:

<p>Name
<br>Phone (evening or weekend preferred)
<br>E-mail address
<br>Address (if you are uncomfortable with this then your general
locale at least)

<p>To:

<p>John Scotto
<br>1-505-479-0871
<br><a href="mailto:jscotto@wazoo.com">jscotto@wazoo.com</a>
<br>Holloman AFB, NM

<p>I would like to start a southern New Mexico/El Paso area user group and
believe that is the most auspicious time to do so.  Please feel free to
print out and post this in local University Bulletin Boards, computer
shops, and etc.  What's my motivation?  I am sick of having to write back
to my old Las Vegas user group for support (as much as I miss them). 
Please take the time to answer if you feel a group like this would be of
any benefit to you or other Amiga users.

<p>Sincerely,

<p>John Scotto
