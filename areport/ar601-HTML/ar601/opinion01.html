<p><font size=+1><b>Suggestions for an Open System Culture</b></font>

<p>Like a junkie, once an Amigan, always an Amigan.  Attached to this almost
metaphysical platform, like to a mind drug.  Crying out for a Unifying
Amiga Field Theory which will make us win the Computing Super Bowl in the
not too distant future.  A bunch of talented players, but without a
manager, a stadium, a uniform or even....a ball!

<p>Who has the ball, can pay the players, build the stadium, and make the fans
come?  Who?

<p>AMIGA Inc of course.  The OS is the ball, so they have the ball.  Do they
want to join the NCL?  Do they believe in the Amiga team?  Do they think it
can win?  Can they build the stadium, attract the fans?  Be parents,
guardians, protectors to this quirky, eccentric, yet determined,
super-talented lot?  And get their money back and then some? 

<p>There are always risks in life.  Cross the road and be run over, or leaving
the house in the morning, a brick falls on your head.  Nothing could be
more of a risk to middle-of-the-road mentalities than the ribald, way out,
off-the-wall nature of this mysteriously seductive, ahead of its time
collection of chips, screws, transistors, mad-cap designers and bratty,
cheeky users.  But, eh, it's also "a competitive advantage" as they say. 
There just isn't anything like it around anywhere, at least right now.  To
quote, one Jason Compton (Amiga Report#315- August 1995):

<p>"Nowhere else in the world is there anything quite like the Amiga, a
machine and a culture that has literally stood on the cutting
edge-and-the-brink since its existance, able to change so many minds yet be
dismissed out of hand by so many others.  But the ride, for those who stay
and work with it, is unparallelled."

<p>Culture: The totality of socially transmitted behavior patterns, arts,
beliefs, institutions, and all other products of human work and thought,
considered as the expression of a particular period, class, community, or
population.

<p>Our "behavior pattern", beliefs and thoughts are out there, have been since
Jay Miner's days.  There is a tradition, a culture.  And our voices still
resound all over this planet, they just won't die although fewer make up
the choir.  Every blasted day our views are expressed on mailing lists,
IRC, articles, whathaveyou.  No mystery there.  Orphaned more times we care
to remember, we are still here and we are still looking for a parent.

<p>Do Amiga Inc (and granpa Gateway) wanna be these benevolent parents Amigans
so badly need?  Give us the ball, let us play, show the world?  Is our
"culture" anything of value, to them, does it contain as yet unattained
potentials, does it allow for new heights of excellence, adventure,
profits, monetary and social?

<p>To get out of the present marasm, let's think "culture", let's think
"business" or "corporate culture" if you like.  Let's have a peep at what's
going on, who out there in ComputerLand is putting out new ideas, covering
new ground?  Quite a few. 

<p>Take PeopleSoft.  Put on your safety belts.  A 10 bil/year company.
Product: applications to automate processes such as payroll, manufacturing
and order fulfillment, (Enterprise Resource Planning software, ERP) Clients
AT&T, Boeing, Toyota, etc., The fully featured version of their flagship
ware comes with 20,000 pages of technical documentation.  Mission-critical
product of awesome complexity.  Employees 4,000, clients.  2,000.  Eh?

<p>Recent dilemma: Having achieved its remarkable success by "doing whatever
it took to make customers happy", it transpired that their customers,
literally addicted to PS product, decalared that they would be very happy
indeed if they could to lay their hands on an upgrade not on schedule as
planned (hard enough for even the best-managed software company to deliver)
but 3 months ahead of time!! 

<p>You don't make a decision like this lightly but PS decided to do it.  Phil
Cullen, 36, Vice President of quality, concluded that the best way to
explore whether the company could speed up delivery of PeopleSoft 7, was to
take advantage of one of the company's "special skills": turning its
expertise inwards.  His team used web-based tools and databases that
automated the exploration process.  The system included a checklist of
"universal criteria" that 50 different departments could use to forecast
the impact of an early release, to spot the risks and benefits, and to flag
potential "showstoppers "-- problems that could bring the project to its
knees.

<p>Now, lots of companies compete by selling cutting-edge technology.  And
lots of companies use cutting-edge technology to make the products they
sell.  But few companies have pushed as hard as PS has to devise new ideas
for competing, new models of working, and new ways of using cutting-edge
technology to turn those ideas and models into reality.  Steve Zarat, PS
chief information officer: "We're creating an organization that exists, not
in a specific place, but wherever its people are.  We're on the leading
edge of what will become commonplace." How did that work?  Simple, think
globally; they gave everybody working on the project a backpack with
laptop, pager, cell-phone, PDA, satellite modems, etc.  Powerful tools.
Zarat: "If you have power, you also have responsibilities.  If you have
responsibilities, you need tools to get things done.  We provided those
tools."

<p>New models of working?  It appears that one of the most important,
"serious" cultural values of PS is having...fun!.  People think of
themselves there as "the luckiest people in the world!" Hey, Dave Haynie
are you listening, they even have a houseband, The Raving Daves, fronted by
guitarist Dave Duffield, PeopleSoft's president, chairman and CEO.

<p>OK, how does this apply to Amiga?  Right now there isn't much one can do
directed at the outside world.  This is a research and development phase? 
Fine, so lets take advantage of this lull in outgoing operations and do a
bit of R&D on and with the community too.  In the Amiga's case, "turning
our expertise inwards" could mean weaving and strenghtening a system of
community communications which includes everybody part of it.  This would
seem to be a good start.  INCLUSION, IMHO, is the future of any business
community culture or the culture of any future business community!  Let's
try to practice it and see.

<p>Researching these matters, there is more.  In all these "avantgarde"
companies, there is a definite distaste for hierarchy, bureocracy and
bull-shit.  "When you get rid of the BS, it's amazing how much work you can
get done", says Duffield.  We are not immune to it so let's go to war with
our own BS too.

<p>"Everyone should know everything" is another big "cultural" point these
days.  Fun, egalitarianism, agility.  Ah, this is a big program and
requires great open-mindedness.  OPEN....here goes that word.  People
should have access to everything, good AND bad, news, problems, solutions,
difficulties, victories.  Innovations will appear where old methods are
failing.  The vertical, rigid, hierarchical one has had it, it's old,
tired, confrontational and no fun.  Duffield: "The challenge isn't to keep
an eye on competitors.  It's to pay attention to the innovators..."

<p>Question for us: How open a "infomocracy" system can one create in
AmigaLand?  A huge one, IMHO.  And without giving away so-called secrets. 
Look again at NDAs, rethink them, create discretionary niches of
information, even if it just talks about what happened in the office or on
a "private" mailing list like ICOA that week.  Who respresented what
argument, position.  Humanize the entire process.

<p>If you can't give hard-fact-news, give human ones.  Our community very
badly needs INCLUSION, the one most important psychological factor in
establishing trust and freeing energies.  We've never had it, not with C=,
not with Escom, not with VisCORP. 

<p>OK, this is a transition period and Amiga Inc (son of Gateway Culture)
doesn't like to make "announcements".  To which one could answer: Amiga
ain't GW but if you can't challenge the wisdom of that policy, by all means
don't make "announcements".  Tell stories instead.  Above all don't stay
silent.  Silence may be golden but it's deadly too.  Anyway, what can
anyone pinch that isn't out there somewhere?  Custom chips?  I'd like to
hear more recent views on this NDA mania!  But never mind, I'm sure some
special AmigaSpeak coding could be invented so as to preserve REAL stuff to
reach the competition (which one?)!

<p>I think we must be careful not to split the community in too many SIGs
pursuing their own agendas.  If we are to invent a new-fangled computer-
community and give ourselves a competitive advantage in the big wide world
out there, we must practice a "culture" that keeps the "Big Picture" of the
community well in focus.  That means INCLUSION.

<p>"Group Intelligence" is a formidable weapon.  Spread what you can spread. 
Overcome doubt and suspicion and frustration in the community by offering
an banquet of information if necessary.  If you can't give it out, seek it,
bring it in.  Ask the community to tell you what's happening in their part
of the world.  Flux and reflux.  Give them tasks.  ICOA are having THEIR
"inside track" fun everyday.  Few others are, this is why Amigans have
become commentators and speculators instead of doers.  In AmigaLand there
are artists, musicians, animators, writers.  Keep 'em busy.  Run a few
competitions, give away a few prizes - a week in South Dakota!  Two weeks
in South Dakota.  Start an Amiga University.  Collect every bit of info on
this anecdote-rich platform/community.  Sponsor logo design, theme music,
whatever.  Waiting for the big "revelations", keep the remaining community
busy, create some fun, INCLUDE THEM!  In a million years you won't find
better proselytizers, even salesmen, than Amiga owners.  I don't know,
invest a bit of money in buying and updating some "classical" Amiga
software and speeding up Internet connectability.  Give away 2.04 or even
3.1 to those still labouring with 1.3 (Can't believe only 20% of Amigans
are connected).  Jeezes, start a program to find out once and for all how
many practicing Amigans there still are out there and, why not, how many
there were (Commodore Registrations must still be around somewhere).  Found
scholarships...Invent "working groups", put together some cool archives of
Amiga stuff, no start a virtual Amiga Museum...Think how usergroups could
become "regional resource centers".  Start Radio Amiga International...And
it could go on and on and needn't cost a fortune!

<p>Losing the remaining user-base, however, would not just be a mistake, it
would be a crime! 

<p>But hurry, the journalists Ben Vost and Thomas Svenson, are right.  Time is
running out. 

<p>Rethinking "corporate" (Amiga) culture.  New models of operating,
co-operating within a really alive community.  Rethink everything,
including PR and Marketing concepts.  Throw out old musty, dead customs and
mindframes.  Rethink capitalism.  Socialize business.  Perhaps even figure
out how to offer some kind of shares to users, let them contribute,
participate.  Ideas are afoot in the big wide world in this area also.

<p>Example: Ray Anderson, his company Interface, makes carpets out of
petroleum wastes!  Figure that one out.  He's holding that "Sustainability
has become as important a consideration in every business decision as
profitability".  Interface doesn't just sell carpets, it leases, installs
and maintains them, takes 'em back and recycles them.  Wow!  He says: "For
its first century, industrial caitalism has been obviusly, relentlessly
linear: raw materials, energy, product, packaging, marketing, distributing,
waste.  In the century to come business will evolve to the next level:
cyclic capitalism.  Among other things, companies will consume their own
waste.  In nature there is no garbage; everyone's waste becomes someone's
food..."

<p>Amiga Inc: Think of recycling old machines, give' em away to schools in
Africa, South America.  In a few years those people will be fully-fledged
Amigans.  A man from a small town in Canada went on Safari to Kenya, came
to a small village, found out the people had no water.  He decided to buy
them a pump, went back to Canada, convinced the people of his town to get
involved in this pump caper.  Now there are 50 more villages in Africa with
water pumps...and growing their own tomatoes!

<p>OK, you wanna talk about PR?  Big changes happening there too.  Used to be
you had to dine and wine important writers and seduce them into writing
about your product.  Now the focus is on the client and "personalizing"
what his "values" are.  What "persona" can the company project, where and
how is the company spending its advertising and PR money.  What is its
relationship with its customers, its employess, the community.  PR,
according to Anne Cunningham, (Cunningham Partners), "Is to tell a
company's management what its many constituencies are thinking.  The PR
person needs to out-report the best reporters -- to talk to journalists,
analysts, stockholders and customers in order to understand the marketplace
better than any of those audiences can.  The payoff comes when the PR
person can convey the constituents' messages to executives at the highest
level of the company -- and then demonstrate to those constituents how
their input has helped inform top management decisions.  You can get all of
these constituents to participate in your success -- but most companies
don't involve them and that's a mistake."

<p>Or another concept, this one from NRG, Chicago-based PR company: "Branding
is dead.  Long live sustainable identity!  When everyone is applying
brand-marketing, it doesn't work anymore.  Now the mind-space is getting
crowded.  Companies will have to do more -- or do something different -- to
stand out."

<p>What could Amiga Inc do that would stand out?  When the time comes, push
their users forward, send them out on adverts and commercials, honestly,
simply.  Much cheaper than hiring actors and models!!  Put them out there,
let people see and hear them, no stupid scripts.  Gateway says, defining
themselves: "You have a friend" AmigaInc should say nothing, let the users
do the talking.  They call that THE POWER OF THIRD PARTY ENDORSEMENTS.
What better if the credibility of your company doesn't come from your own
statements, pronouncements and hype but from being "endorsed" by your
customers? 

<p>So, gather your users around you Amiga Inc and start now, so when you are
ready to go everybody will know what to do!

<p>In the meantime, to pick up on yet another "modern contemporary" PR idea ,
what about this:

<p>Create an event that evangelizes your vision and that of your users. 
Establish venues, real or virtual.  where you can bring together customers
and key industry people (AmigaInc/GW/ICOA/etc,).   And use your Web
presence to share what you know.  The Internet has introduced a whole new
group of players (sorry Thom and Ben that's the truth!) into the
"influencer" chain that PR people MUST connect to.  What is the object of
PR in this fast-changing environment?  NRG think: To establish a
"sustainable identity" for your company.  A sustainable identity doesn't
mean a fixed one, it means an active one!  (A really cool Amiga Festival in
the hills of The Little Bighorn on Summer Solstice?)

<p>Finally, a quick look at Marketing.  Marketing is a contest for people's
attention.  

<p>Follow this: Seth Godin (Yoyodyne Ent.), Internet marketing pioneer, holds
the following, stark and radical, argument: "Advertising just doesn't work
as well as it used to -- in part because there's so much of it, in part
because people have learned to ignore it, in part because the rise of the
Net means that companies can go beyond it.  We are entering an era that's
going to change the way almost everything is marketed to almost everybody."

<p>He sees the biggest problem with mass-marketing advertising as the fight
for people's attention by INTERRUPTING them.  A 30-second spot interrupts a
Seinfeld episode.  A telemarketing call interrupts a family dinner.  A
print ad interrupts an article.  "The interruption model is extremely
effective when there's not an overflow of interruptions.  But there's too
much going on in our lives for us to enjoy being interrupted anymore."

<p>The new model (another time "model" is being used!), he says, is build
around PERMISSION.  The challenge for marketers is to persuade consumers to
volunteer attention -- to "raise their hands" (one of Godin's favorite
phrases) -- to agree to learn more about a company and its products. 
"Permission marketing turns strangers into friends and friends into loyal
customers", he says, "It's not just about entertainment -- it's about
education."

<p>Yet again, this seems a perfect answer for the Amiga and the idea of
compiling its "culture" and employing the users" to spread the word.  Ok,
this might not work -- yet I'm not sure -- on the level of selling
corporations a zillion machines.  But it certainly would work on the level
of the "informed" computer user.  Word Of Mouth, very effective.  And then
again, corporations have individual "people" manning the workstations.
Even if it takes a bit of an effort, a convinced -- and convincing --
Amigan, could bring his machine to work and demostrate it during a lunch
break.  Provided the platform has real performance advantages, even in a
rather specialized field like graphics, video or multimedia (a growing
industry!) -- it could well turn a few heads.  If a solid customer-support
system, a la Gateway and more, (Usergroups involvemnt) backs that up, a new
Amiga, would have a fair chance of making some impact on the scene.  I'm
not saying it would ever outdo PC's, not as we are seeing the situation
now, but who knows what changes of attitude might occur.  Strangely, big
companies, so sure of their turf, are slower than upstarts and not so
agile.  With an agile OS, and an informed and an informed, well-cared for
userbase, who knows what could happen.

<p>Conclusion: Whichever way one looks at these most recent developments in
the fields of PR, Advertising and Marketing, it seems to me the perfect
opportunity for the Amiga Gestalt (developers, users and parent company) to
create an entirely new "model" of integration and operation.

<p>INCLUSION is very much the KEY word.  I know this all implies a very shrewd
understanding of the new forces at work in society and marketing, and a
considerable imagination on the part of "corporate" thinkers to see further
than their noses and show innovative and original enterpreunership.  
Difficult times need intelligent, well-informed, courageous and dynamic
leadership.  The AMIGA community is crying out for such a lead.  ICOA has
clearly demonstarted there is plenty of leadership ability, talent and
serious dedication in our community.  The trick is to unleash it and
co-ordinate it.  This is something Amiga Inc has to do if it wishes to
stake a claim in the future of computing.
