<p>Legacy Maker, Inc.  of Chicago, IL is proud to announce the commercial
release of <b>PanCanvas</b>, the Motion Control plugin for ImageFX 2.6 and above.

<p>PanCanvas, by Ola Olsson, is a powerful tool to turn ImageFX into a
professional-quality motion control station.  Put simply, motion control
involves "panning" across a still image to create the illusion of
animation.  This technique is used liberally in documentaries and news
profiles, to bring photographs and documents to life on the screen.

<p>Just draw a frame over where you want your animation to start, and where
you want your animation to end, and PanCanvas will smoothly crop your
original image into an animated sequence.  It's even easy for your virtual
camera to zoom, follow curves and ease in and out of stops.
 
<p>PanCanvas outputs a sequence of frames (IFF or JPEG) which can be used to
generate Flyer clips, Amiga ANIMs, MPEGs, and more.  It's easy to
incorporate PanCanvas into your video editing suite.

<p>PanCanvas includes PanPost, a post-processing engine to enhance your
output.
