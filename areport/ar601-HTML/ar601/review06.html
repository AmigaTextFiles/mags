<p><b>REVIEW</b>

<p>Being a user of TurboCalc since version 2 the usage is as straightforward
as can be imagined.  The same look and feel as in the previous v4.  But
lets go back to the basics for the readers who haven't used TC before.

<p>TurboCalc is a professional spreadsheet program which doesnt have be shamed
of its major counterpart in PCs namely Excel.  TC is formed of a sheets
(there can be several of these in one folder).  In fact you could say that
TC goes from simple 2D (rows and columns) to third dimension that of
sheets.  In one sheet you indeed have conventional rows and columns.  To
these columns and rows you can enter values and formulas how to count the
values.  This is the same as in every spreadsheet program out there.  From
the one sheet concept spreadsheet programs started to move on to third
dimension which added several sheets to use from.  The multi-sheet feature
is infact quite handy since you can place lots of data like macros, seldom
used data and graphs to a different sheets away from the actual 'user
interface' sheet which is mostly visible to the user.

<p>TC features all the basic features of spreadsheet program for editing:
Copying, pasting, clearing.  All the usual attributes like fonts, colors,
frames and stuff.  To support these basic attributes TC also includes
context menus which popup from for example when you select a whole row,
column or a single cell.  This speeds up editing a lot removing the
necessity to jump to normal menus everytime you need some basic option.
TCs sheet has a toolbar for speedy access to different functions.  You can
freely edit the toolbar to suite your particular needs of functions.  You
easily remove and add buttons to the toolbar from list of available
functions.

<p>For the modern touch the HTML export was added to the TCs v5.  You can save
the sheet to a HTML file which contains a TABLEs to reflect the row/col
nature of spreadsheet.  Only thing I missed was the ability to save as HTML
only the selected portion of sheet.  Now it saves the whole sheet.
Ofcourse this can easily be circumvented by copying a portion of sheet and
pasting it to another one and then exporting that as HTML.  You can also
import from Excel's 5 and 7 version sheets.  I didn't test this one, so I
cant say how it works.  Apparently imported sheet's original outlook may
change if some exotic features of Excel has been used on the original.

<p>TC can also be used as simple database program with its database commands.
You can search and filter data on given parameters quite easily.  For
simple use like keeping address registry of business partners or something
like that this might become very handy.

<p>If you need graphical presentation of your data just select from loads of
different graphs which are quite common to all spreadsheet programs.  Pies,
bars, lines and areas and ofcourse 3D versions of these are readily
available.  I liked the feature being able to create graphs to seperate
windows or to be able to place them on the actual sheet.  Both methods are
usefull, placing graphs to a datasheet gives you some cool presentation
sheets and on the other hand keeping graphs on their own windows gives you
more space to work with.  Ofcourse you can also save the graphs to IFF
files to export to other programs and maybe to a WWW page too.
