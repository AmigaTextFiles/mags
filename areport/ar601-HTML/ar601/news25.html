<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b>

<p>`phonebill' is, simply said, a log file analyzer.  What it basically does
is scan log file(s) generated by a terminal program or a mailer, extract
all information about calls you have made by using your modem, and store
this in its own (short) format.  After extracting the calls `phonebill' can
generate various reports in which you can find information on duration and
costs of the calls.

<p>Here is a small list of the main features:

<br>* Very flexible user-configurable rates, supporting exceptions for
  certain days and dates.

<p>* User-configurable log scanners: `phonebill' by default supports
  various log files, but for any log file that is not supported the
  user is able to create a scanner. The following is a list of log
  files that are already supported:
