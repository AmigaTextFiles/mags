<p>Dear Amiga User,

<p>This message is to inform you of some changes at Cronus (formerly Amiga
Library Services).

<p>In early 1986 I founded Amiga Library Services to distribute Amiga software
on floppy disk (AKA "Fish Disks") and then many years later began producing
CD-ROM distributions of Amiga software.  At the time of Commodore's
bankruptcy, Amiga Library Services was a small but growing company that not
only produced our own products, but imported many products from overseas
and resold them to both end users and dealers.

<p>Of course many things have happened since then, and we recently find
ourselves in the position of not having sufficient ongoing sales to really
justify remaining in the Amiga marketplace at this time.  So a couple
months ago, we made the rather painful decision that Cronus would stop
reselling Amiga products, and with the exception of future AmigaOS versions
of Geek Gadgets, stop producing our own Amiga products.  Of course this is
not an irreversible decision.  If for some reason in the future it makes
sense to reenter the marketplace we will certainly do so.  This is not a
loss of faith in the Amiga itself, but purely a business decision based on
the "bottom line".
