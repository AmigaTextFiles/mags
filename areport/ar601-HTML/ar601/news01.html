<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b>

<p>As you may know the A3000 and the Tower make use of ZIP-type Memory which
was inexpensive in the past but now is highly overpriced.

<p>Simmfonie simply implements the SIMM sockets in the A3000.  Ofcourse you
could still pay somewhere between $10 to $15 USD per meg for SC ZIP Ram.
The ZIP Ram only provides a slight speed advantage, about 15%.  That is
hardly worth paying the extra money.

<p>Simmfonie can use EDO ram but there are no speed benefits.  This is a
limitation of the chipset used in the A3000(T) not Simmfonie.

<p>Faster SIMMs are recommended because there is hardly any price difference
at all.  As well, faster SIMMs would be more usefull when upgrading to a
CPU board that has on board SIMM sockets.  You could use 4MB or 8MB
modules.  The 8MB module is recommended because there are only two SIMM
slots available on the SIMMfonie for a maximum of 16MB fast ram.

<p>Simmfonie uses an industrial HQ board and golden steel connectors which are
placed in the ZIP sockets on the mainboard of the A3000(T).

<p><b>INSTALLATION</b>

<p>The installation is more difficult than it is for a Zorro board.  If you
follow the step by step instructions outlined in the manual it is no
problem.  None of the Simmfonie adaptors have been returned due to a defect
in the product.  No machine or memory problems have been reported after
installation.

<p><b>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</b>

<p>Make sure to request the proper model of Simmfonie.  There is a different
version for the A3000T.  It's not possible to use the adapter together with
a CPU board, but since most have on-board sockets, this doesn't really
matter.

<p><b>AVAILABILITY</b>

<p>- Immediately in Europe
<br>- November 1, 1997 in North America

<p><b>PRICE</b>

<p>Simmfonie for Amiga 3000 Desktop $80 CAD about $60 USD
