<p>Where were you when Phase5 announced they would be releasing a PowerPC
accelerator board for the Amiga?

<p>Regardless of where you were, you were there some time ago.  But just
before 1997 closed, Phase5 made good on their commitment to ship PPC cards
for Amiga computers.  Sure, the original premise of a PPC-only approach,
much like the Macintosh, was scrapped in favor of the less elegant 060 (or
040) plus PPC combination.  And no, your existing applications won't be
sped up by the presence of the PowerPC.

<p>But--and this is the important part--the boards are in fact out.  And they
do in fact have software that supports them.  Admittedly, not a whole lot,
but the cards have introduced a totally new wrinkle into Amiga software
development, so it's only to be expected that it will take some time to
-really- catch on.

<p>I'm happy enough with what I'm playing around with these days--but I'm
getting ahead of myself.

<p><b>Installation</b>

<p>The Phase5 CyberStorm PPC cards are laden with components.  There are two
areas of interest: the 0x0 socket and the SIMM slots.

<p>At this point I'd like to remind everyone of something which seems so
common-sensical yet is terribly easy to forget: be very, very careful
whenever you poke around with new hardware and your Amiga.  During the
installation process, because of my impatience, I caused damage to the PPC
board AND my 4000T, which required both to get professional service.  (More
on how, exactly, I did that later.)

<p>If you are installing your own 040 or 060 chip, be sure it is oriented
correctly (check the instructions if you're unsure) and be careful when
pushing the chip down into the socket.  Because of the board's design it
may be difficult to get good leverage.  Part of the initial problem I had
was that it didn't seem that the chip was seated far enough down in the
socket.  If you are unsure, it's best to test the board, rather than
-really- whale away at the card and cause damage (which was part of what I
did).

<p>RAM is easier to install physically, but there's something you should know
about.  When Phase5 put out their Cyberstorm Mark II 060 card, it was a
real breakthrough for RAM installation: you could mix and match any size
SIMMs and the card would configure it into a single contiguous block.
Because of the bus design on the PPC card, this is no longer possible.  You
must add SIMMs of the same size and speed in pairs, and preferably from the
same manufacturer.  I was unable to use the original pair of 16 meg SIMMs
from my Mark II board: I had to swap a 16 meg SIMM from elsewhere to get
the board to work.  If this has happened to you, you'll notice that only
part of the RAM you installed is configured and you will be unable to run
PPC software (it won't be able to open the ppc.library).  Just be patient
and try different SIMMs.

<p>(For the curious, the other half of the damage incurred while installing
the PPC board came on my 4000T, where it is necessary to remove two ribbon
cables from the I/O daughtercard before you can get at the accelerator
slot.  I accidentally replaced them on the opposite headers, which fried
one of the cables and made it impossible to use the mouse or keyboard.  Of
course, I didn't -know- I'd fried just the cable, I thought I'd killed the
CIAs.  Six weeks at the shop later, they figured out it was just the
cable.)

<p><b>Using the Board: Existing Applications</b>

<p>Well, there's not a whole lot to say.  This board brings an 060/50 to the
table (or an 040 if you're thrifty).  As well, you get a fast SCSI
interface with a high-density 68 pin connector.  This connector isn't
-custom-, but it is -unusual-, and not the sort of thing you're likely to
find cheap cables for--as well, it requires something other than "connect A
to B" interface-to-drive hookup.  All of this is well detailed in the
manual, but the bottom line is that to get cables and terminators and so
forth will likely cost upwards of US$60.  I have not yet taken this plunge
as I am still reasonably pleased with the performance of my 4000T SCSI.

<p>My previous card was a Cyber Mark II 060, so I noticed no real change.
The memory system is alleged to be somewhat faster on the PPC boards, but
various benchmark reports indicate that this card is anywhere from the same
speed to 10% faster in most tests.  Certainly nothing to write home about,
but on the other hand, any improvement is always welcome.

<p>Your existing applications will be blissfully unaware of the introduction
of the PPC board to the system.  I have yet to encounter anything which
does not function as it should under my new setup.

<p>(Note: The CyberStorm Mark III Phase5 is selling is essentially just a PPC
board with all of the PPC components missing.  It is not upgradable.)

<p><b>Using the Board: PPC</b>

<p>Now, this is the interesting stuff.  Under a heat sink and a fan, next to a
bunch of components, is a little chip that can: in my case, a PPC 604e/150.

<p>To activate it requires the ppc.library.  The boards ship with floppies and
a CD-ROM containing installation software to get the necessary 060 and PPC
libraries installed on your system.

<p>The CD-ROM PPC software is essentially of two sorts: developer material
(the GNU C compiler, PPC aware) and a handful of PPC apps, mostly of the
eyecandy variety.  A couple of rudimentary diagnostic applications round
out the set.

<p>Of the demo software, I enjoyed Mountains the most.  Since I loved playing
with Scenery Generator years ago (and enjoying the increase in detail and
speed I could get as I moved from an A500 to an 020 2000 to a 3000), I felt
right at home.  Of course, the 16 bit CyberGraphX display is a far cry from
the low-res 16 color display SG was better suited to.

<p>Running PPC software will require you to learn a few new tricks.  A full
discussion of exactly how a PPC Amiga program is constructed isn't
necessary, but suffice it to say that they typically come in one of two
forms:

<p>1. A two-file executable.  You launch the first in the customary Amiga
fashion (from CLI or Workbench), and the first calls the second.  (The
second file is usually, but not always, suffixed with "<tt>.elf</tt>")

<p>2. A single-file, "<tt>.elf</tt>" file.  I have seen a LoadSeg patch which
developers have to allow you to run these directly (much like the XLoadSeg
program which let you run XPK packed files directly).  If you can't get
your hands on that, you'll have to run a program like RunElf, which you can
find on the CD and in other PPC archives.

<p>Getting used to launching the <tt>.elf</tt> files with an external program like
RunElf takes a little getting used to, especially for programs like gzip or
unlzx which you'd like to put in your C: path.

<p>Unfortunately, the hard and fast truth is that as of this writing there
just isn't a lot of serious, top-quality software available for the PPC.
Personal Paint takes advantage of it, Wildfire is very PPC aware, and some
resourceful programmers have ported a number of programs, both useful and
novelty, to the card.  You can play Doom on the PPC card (although I was
quite comfortable with the speed the 060 offered).

<p>I don't mean to diminish their efforts, but it makes it very difficult to
identify a PPC killer app because at present there just isn't quite one.  I
know what makes the PPC a killer for -me-, but it's not quite the same.

<p>Some of what I -have- enjoyed about the PPC follows...

<p><b>MAME (Multi Arcade Machine Emulator):</b> You just knew it would have to be an
emulator, didn't you?  If nothing else it proves that time may change
everything but my love of emulation remains.  Mats Eirik Hansen's port of
MAME to the 060 was a godsend but a terrible tease: many games could be
played at a decent speed, but you had to sacrifice audio to get an
acceptible framerate.  But he got hold of a PPC board and did a port, and
"wow!" is all I can say.  On my system, some games run at 60 fps with full
audio, with double buffering.  Others can dip just below so it's more
comfortable to run at 30 fps.  I imagine that the faster PPC boards will
offer more 60 fps action, but I'm extremely happy with these results.
Frankly, the PPC opens up a lot of possibilities for emulation and I think
we've seen the surface just barely scratched.

<p><b>Andreas Kleinert's many PPC ported programs:</b> The man behind the AK
datatypes has ported those as well as a whole set of other useful and
notable programs over to the Phase5 ppc.library.  UU-coders, unlzx, DMS, as
well as a BASIC interpreter (!), and other interesting bits.  Kleinert
attempted a Zip/Unzip port but I found a serious bug (the reasons for it
involve the original Amiga port, I forget the exact details) and the
project is on hold.  Still, his home page at
<a href="http://home.t-online.de/home/Andreas_Kleinert/support.htm">http://home.t-online.de/home/Andreas_Kleinert/support.htm</a> is worth raiding.

<p><b>UAE PPC:</b> The Unix (or the U word of your choice) Amiga Emulator was ported
to the 68K Amiga, but was so miserably slow it wasn't worth running.  The
good news is that it's faster on the PPC.  The bad news is that on my
system it's still pretty slow.  I wasn't able to get anywhere near a
reasonable framerate.  I shouldn't feel too bad since the PC guys have some
trouble with it too (although they keep getting great gimmicks to make it
faster).  I'm not sure how much I trust the framerate calculator on the UAE
ARexx interface, but with the sound off I'm able to get something which
approximates a tolerable attempt at A500 speed.  A faster PPC board (Phase5
has been shipping 604e/233s) would undoubtedly be more impressive.  Some
optimization would be nice to see but I may be wishing for a bit too much.

<p><b>VGB PPC:</b> The Virtual Gameboy (yes, another emulator) got a PPC port which
needs a speed control since it's a bit too big.  You slow it down by making
the window bigger, which isn't exactly the most efficient way to do it.
Sound would be nice, but if I want >100% speed out of a Gameboy emulator
without worrying about it refusing to work (Wzonkalad) or randomly crashing
my machine (AmiGameBoy) I'll turn to this emulator.

<p>ADoom PPC:</b> I had trouble getting the other two PPC Doom clones working, so
I was encouraged when ADoom PPC (converted to PPC by Joe Fenton of
Emplant/Fusion fame) got up and running with little trouble.  The best part
about this port is the guide to getting good performance in high resolution
screenmodes--for example, 640x480 is actually a very -poor- choice (but
resolutions so near they may as well be 640x480 are -good- choices--it's
got something to do with caches, leave it at that), so you can get very
crisp displays at good speed if you're patient with the manual.  Like I
said earlier I was happy enough with the 060 speed, but more is, well,
better.

<p>There's a competing standard for PPC software on Phase5 boards known as
WarpOS.  I have not yet installed WarpOS and attempted to use this
software.  As far as I can tell it is fairly firmly in the
minority--probably owing to Phase5's standard used by GCC (the populist,
low-budget compiler) and SAS/C (the high-end software used by most
commercial developers today).  WarpOS, by Haage and Partner, revolves
around StormC.

<p><b>The Future of PPC</b>

<p>There are other programs out there, and many manufacturers of commercial
software have committed to converting their programs to PPC.  The
conversion of SAS/C to support the PPC was a huge step forward.

<p>These conversions have not quite flown into the market.  Sales of PPC
boards are ongoing, and more announcements of real dates are expected, but
we have only their words to go on at this point.

<p>The bottom line is that PPC technology has finally arrived for the Amiga.
Maybe it's not exactly what you expected, and maybe there's not 2,000
programs out that take advantage of it just yet.  But new PPC software is
released every week, and it is the cutting edge of Amiga hardware.  If you
are interested in being a part of that, now is a very good time to buy a
PPC card.
