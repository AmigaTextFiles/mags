<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b>

<p>MonthNavigator is a Custom Class of the Magic User Interface (c) by Stefan
Stuntz.  It is a subclass of group-class.

<p>The idea of this class was born during developing my Gregor application.

<p>It's a MUI public custom class showing a field with the days of a specified
month in a specified year.  The user decides if the names of the weekdays
and the week numbers will be shown.  Also it is possible for the user to
set which weekday should be the day on which a week was started - the
language for the weekday names can also be chosen.  A special feature of
this class is, that it correctly handles October 1582.  In this month the
days 5-14 didn't exist, because they were removed by the Gregorian calendar
reform.  This calendar reform happens in different years for different
countries, so the user can set his country with the user preferences.

<p>Users can change the display of MonthNavigator with the following
features:
<br>- Show/Hide names of the weekdays
<br>- Select name of weekday with which a week starts
<br>- Select the language to use for the names of weekdays (out of 21)
<br>- Show/Hide week numbers
<br>- Select the country for the Gregorian calendar reform (unusable as
long as the date.library has not fully implemented this feature)
<br>- Set the distance between the day-field and the
names of weekdays/week numbers
<br>- Use frames for day-fields
<br>- Show/Hide unused day-fields
<br>- Display the last/first days of the previous/next month within the
unused day-fields
<br>- Define how days of the previous/next month should be highlighted
<br>- Define how the internal 'mark today' hook should highlight today

<p>MonthNavigator supports also the following features which might be
of interest for developers:
<br>- Based on Date.mcc
<br>- Dropping a date-object onto a MonthNavigator will set this date
as the actual one
<br>- Objects can be dropped onto the days
<br>- Days can be dragged around
<br>- Days can be marked by changing the following attributes:
<br>* MUIA_Text_PreParse
<br>* MUIA_Background
<br>* MUI_ShortHelp
<br>* MUIA_Disabled
<br>- Supporting MUIM_Import and MUIM_Export
<br>- Dates can be correctly selected from 0008-01-01 to 8000-12-31
by using the DateLib (TM)

<p>The MonthNavigator also supports three input modes: read-only, relverify
and the immediate mode.
