<p><b>TITLE</b>

<p>Games Master System
<br>(GMS) 

<p><b>VERSION</b>

<p>0.9B (Released December 1997) 

<p><b>AUTHOR</b>

<p>Paul Manias (<a href="mailto:paul@ethos.co.nz">paul@ethos.co.nz</a>) 

<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b>

<p>The Games Master System is a developers kit that is aimed at enhancing the
functionality of the Amiga OS, with emphasis on games programming.  It is
based on the Amiga shared library standard, so will work with any
programming language such as C, Assembler, E, Basic etc. 

<p>The system can be ported across to other platforms besides the Amiga, and
in future GMS programs could be run on other platforms without
recompilation (CPU's must match or they have to be emulated). 

<p>Here are just a few of the features: 

<br>- Object Oriented kernel design. 
<br>- Fast blitter functions, including CPU assisted blitting. 
<br>- In-built proportional fading functions. 
<br>- Sound support, includes intelligent channel play-back. 
<br>- Support for raster/copperlists with built-in special FX. 
<br>- External structure and object pre-processing, allows user
   editing of program data. 
<br>- Dynamic resource allocation. 
<br>- Support for all kinds of input devices (joysticks, joypads etc) 
<br>- An official system debugger is provided. 
<br>- A preference program that allows editing of things such as
   default screen dimensions, resolutions, mode promotion etc. 
<br>- Multi-tasking and screen-switching is supported. 

<p>The system has a very modern design and includes full resource tracking and
safe task destruction features.  A debugger has been included which GMS
functions co-operate with, so there is no need for special patches or
debugging tools.  Functions are written with garbage protection features
and where possible, software based memory protection.  GMS can recover from
many programming errors that usually result in software failures. 

<p>Full documentation and 320k of example source in C, Assembler and E is
included within the developer archive. 

<p><b>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</b>

<p>GMS will take up 1.6 megs of space on your hard-drive and runs in less than
100k of memory.  There are no must-have requirements, but an AGA Amiga is
necessary for about 5% of the demos.  KingCON or any other enhanced shell
with a scroll back buffer is desirable for running IceBreaker. 

<p><b>AVAILABILITY</b>

<p>GMS is available on all up to date Aminet sites, for example: 

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/gms_dev.lha">ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/gms_dev.lha</a> (450k) 
<br><a href="ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/gms_user.lha">ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/gms_user.lha</a> (230k) 

<p>Developers will need both archives, Users will only need the second
archive.
