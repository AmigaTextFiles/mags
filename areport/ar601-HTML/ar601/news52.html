<p><font size=+1><b>Team AMIGA Release</b></font>

<p>We are pleased to announce that with the assistance of Ultima Thule
Software (<a href="http://www.thule.no">http://www.thule.no</a>), Team
*AMIGA* now has a mailing list in operation.

<p>We envision this list to be a low traffic mailing list where Amiga users
can get the latest news as it happens, get help with software and hardware
problems, and have general discussions about Team *AMIGA* and the Amiga
computer.  Thru this list we will also allow hardware and software vendors,
both commercial and shareware to offer our members specials discounts and
incentives!

<p>Team *AMIGA* asks anyone who joins this mailing list to also provide
special news and bulletins that are posted to any and all other nets and
bbs's that you may visit so that all our members can take advantage of the
vast resources of Team *AMIGA*.

<p>To join the Team *AMIGA* mailing list simply send an email to:

<a href="mailto:teamamiga@thule.no">teamamiga@thule.no</a>

<p>And in the BODY of the message type "SUBSCRIBE TEAMAMIGA" without the quote
marks.

<p>Please remember to visit Ultima Thule Software and help those who are
helping Team *AMIGA*!

<p>Sincerely,

<p><hr>
