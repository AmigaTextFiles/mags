Termite V1.10 Upgrade<br>
Press Release<p>

July 27, 1995<p>

Oregon Research is proud to announce a major upgrade to Termite, a modern
Telecommunications package for the Amiga.  Some of the new features in
version 1.10 include:<p>
<ul>
	<li>Built in ZMODEM protocol hand-optimized in assembly language for speed.

	<li>Improved internal emulation.  The new internal ANSI emulator is
	optimized, robust, and has been extensively tested with the most complex
	ANSI screens we could find.  The new VT102 emulator is highly optimized
	and is ideal for use with UNIX or VMS dialup accounts.  Both of the
	built-in emulations have mouse-based cut-and-paste functionality.

	<li>Jump scrolling.  Instead of scrolling the screen one line at a time,
	Termite monitors incoming serial data and scrolls up multiple lines at a
	time, for a huge speed increase.

	<li>Multitasking review buffer.  The terminal and review buffer can be used
	simultaneously!

	<li>Enhanced chat window.  The chat window now maintains a resizable
	"history" which keeps track of the text you have sent.  A single click on
	a line in the history brings it up for editing.  A double click on a
	history line instantly resends it.

	<li>Predefined palettes.  The screen settings requester now provides buttons
	which allow you to switch between ANSI, RIP, and Termite default color
	palettes with the click of a button.

	<li>Review buffer filter.  Optional filtering of ANSI codes out of the review
	buffer.

	<li>New ARexx macro capabilities and button bar functions.

	<li>New manual and quick reference card.
</ul>
Termite works on all Amiga systems with 1Mb or more of memory and WorkBench
2.0 or higher.  Termite 1.10 retails for $49.95 and is available now.<p>

Upgrades for registered users to Termite 1.10 is US $10.00 for a new disk
and the quick reference card, or US $15.00 for a new disk, the quick
reference card, and second edition manual.  There is a $2 shipping charge
on upgrades to covre materials and postage.  (Please Note: Some copies of
Termite 1.00 already have the second edition manual.  Check the copyright
page of your manual to make sure.)<p>
