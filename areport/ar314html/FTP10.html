<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
<ul>
	An universal picture viewer (incl. PhotoCD) and converter
	for all Amigas and esp. for Cybergraphic users.<p>

	This program can display pictures in many file formats (see
	below) directly in windows on the Workbench (default public
	screen) or in a window on a separate screen. If you have
	a suitable graphic board with Cybergraphic WB emulation
	installed you can even watch the pictures in full color
	quality (HiColor/TrueColor) on your Workbench. Without
	Cybergraphics the normal color restrictions (2 to 256
	colors) will lead to a reduced quality, but smart pen
	allocation during displaying will still give surprisingly
	high quality with 256 colors.<p>

	You can switch forward and backward between images and
	scroll images in their resizable windows. An automatic
	preloading feature will reduce waiting time to a minimum.
	While you watch one picture (and maybe scroll it around),
	the next picture will already be loaded, so that it will
	be there if you decide to switch... You can select down-
	scaled loading for viewing in reduced size. Unlike many
	other viewers, this viewer reduces most pictures during
	loading and will thus be faster for reduced size loading.<p>

	Additional features include conversion to some 24Bit formats
	(incl. JPeg, IFF-ILBM24, Targa) and fast direct transfer
	to famous image processing and painting programs (ImageFX,
	XiPaint, ArtEffect/PicoPainter).<p>

	Internally supported formats for loading:
	<ol>
		<li>IFF-ILBM (1 to 24Bit incl. HAM6/HAM8)
		<li>PhotoCD (Base format 768x512 or 512x768 (portrait))
		<li>JPeg (color and greyscale)
		<li>PPM/PGM/PBM (P1&P4 b&w, P5 grey, P6 color)
		<li>QRT (also known as dump format by PD raytracers as POV-Ray)
		<li>Targa
		<li>PCX
		<li>BMP (uncompressed)
		<li>TIF (packbit-compr./uncompr.)
		<li>EGS7.x window icons
		<li>DEEP
		<li>YUV
		<li>VLAB raw
		<li>RGB
		<li>HHsYUVSq sequence format
		<li>IFF-PBM (DPII)
		<li>ACBM
		<li>FBM
		<li>Sun raster (uncompressed)
		<li>MacPaint (b&w compressed 1Bit format; datafork only)
		<li>HHsXRL formats
	</ol>
	The additional DataType support extends this list by many
	formats; DataTypes can e.g. be found on Aminet in util/DType.
	The DataType support is very fast, so that you can also view
	pictures in GIF or other formats quite fast for which Datatypes exist.
