A new Logo for the Amiga.<p>

The Amiga had its official rebirth on the 30th of May at the press
conference held in Frankfurt by Amiga Technologies and ESCOM.  Projects for
the future concerning company identity and new casing designs were
presented to the attendance.  The logo from Frogdesign has finally been
chosen.  It is a simple and elegant symbol that will from now on accompany
the Amiga and its fans.  Frogdesign states about the brand : "The Amiga
Wordmark evokes both a classic and elegant feel as well as modern look.
Bodoni, the font selected to build upon is a classic font.  Further
refinements involving the manipulation and substraction of serifs and the
addition of the red square create a progressive, yet elegant logo.  the red
square represents technology and adds energy to the logo by implying a
sense of motion."<p>
