<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
<ul>
	PoolWatch is a debug tool for OS 3.0 and higher designed to watch
	and correct illegal allocation and freeing of memory that use the
	pool-functions provided in OS 3.0 and upwards.  PoolWatch is
	necessary since Mungwall do not catch any illegal memory handling
	concerning pool-allocations.<p>

	PoolWatch is especially useful in combination with Enforcer,
	Mungwall (which will watch normal allocations that use
	AllocMem/FreeMem), SegTracker and FindHit (included in the
	Enforcer archive).<p>

	If SegTracker is running in the system when PoolWatch is started,
	PoolWatch will use the public SegTracker seglist tracking for
	identifying the hunk and offset into the executable doing illegal
	allocations.<p>

	PoolWatch will patch CreatePool(), DeletePool(), AllocPooled(),
	and FreePooled() in exec.library.  PoolWatch will use these
	functions but will add extra security on top of all
	pool-allocations.  In most cases of illegal allocation/freeing,
	PoolWatch will report the error to the user and correct the
	problem (if possible).  Please note that PoolWatch does not offer
	any memory protection if a task writes to a random addresse in
	memory, but will take care of most problems associated with pool
	allocations.
</ul>
<b>NEW FEATURES</b>
<ul>
	Version 1.02 fixed two small bugs, and introduced three new
	options; NOSTACK, NOREGS and STDIO (output to stdio instead of to
	the serial port).  Version 1.03 fixes an address error (occurred
	on 68000 machines), and introduces the options UPDATE and DOILLEGAL.
