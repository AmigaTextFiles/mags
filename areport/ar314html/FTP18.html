<b>TITLE</b>
<h1>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)</h1>
<b>VERSION</b>
<ul>
	<h3>Version 2.6.2 (USA and Canada version)</h3>
</ul>
<b>AUTHOR</b>
<ul>
	Original version written by Philip Zimmermann, Colin Plumb,
	Staale Schumacher and various contributors. Amiga port and
	enhancements by Peter Simons and Robert Knop.
</ul>
<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
<ul>
	Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), from Phil's Pretty Good Software, is
	a high security cryptographic software application for MSDOS, Unix,
	VAX/VMS, Amiga and other computers. PGP allows people to exchange
	files or messages with privacy, authentication, and convenience.
	Privacy means that only those intended to receive a message can
	read it. Authentication means that messages that appear to be from
	a particular person can only have originated from that person.
	Convenience means that privacy and authentication are provided
	without the hassles of managing keys associated with conventional
	cryptographic software. No secure channels are needed to exchange
	keys between users, which makes PGP much easier to use. This is
	because PGP is based on a powerful new technology called "public
	key" cryptography. And PGP performs the public-key functions faster
	than most other software implementations. PGP is public key
	cryptography for the masses.
</ul>
<b>CHANGES</b>
<ul>
	Please check the included README.1ST and ReadMe.amiga file for a
	detailed list of modifications.
</ul>
<b>NOTES</b>
<ul>
	This version of PGP is for use in the USA and Canada only.  Users
	outside these two countries should instead use PGP 2.6.2i, which was
	announced earlier on comp.sys.amiga.announce.<p>

	This vesrion is based on the same source tree as PGP 2.6.2i.
	However, it was compiled with the RSAREF library to make it completely
	legal to use in the USA.  The USA and international versions are
	functionally equivalent.<p>

	A mailing list concerning PGPAmiga has been created on
	peti.rhein.de. To subscribe, send e-mail to <a href="mailto:PGPAmiga@peti.rhein.de">PGPAmiga@peti.rhein.de</a>
	"ADD your_address" (without quotes) in the message body.
</ul>
<b>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</b>
<ul>
	PGP 2.6.2 works completely with Kickstart 2.0 and above.  It mostly
	works with Kickstart 1.3, but the key generation still does not
	function under 1.3.  (We are working on that, however.)
</ul>
<b>LEGALITY</b>
<ul>
	This version of PGP is perfectly legal for non-commercial purposes
	inside the United States of America and Canada.  However, before you get
	it, you have to agree not to export it out of these two countries.
	International users should use PGP 2.6.2i, released by Peter Simons
	(<a href="mailto:simons@peti.rhein.de">simons@peti.rhein.de</a>).
</ul>
<b>HOST NAME</b>
<ul>
	<samp>ftp.csn.net</samp>
</ul>
<b>DIRECTORY</b>
<ul>
	<tt>/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/pgp/amiga</tt><p>

	NOTICE -- this directory is a little tricky to get into because of
	the export controls.  To get into it, first go to directory /mpj
	and get the file README.MPJ.  If you agree to all the terms in this
	file, it will tell you the name of the directory which is listed as
	a bunch of ?'s above.  This name changes frequently, so read
	README.MPJ right before you are planning on downloading files from the
	site.
</ul>
<b>FILE NAMES</b>
<ul>
<pre><samp>     pgp262-amiga020.lha    68020 executables and full docs
     pgp262-amiga000.lha    68000 executables and full docs
     PGP-2.6.2i.lha         PGP 2.6.2i source tree
     rsaref-amiga.lha       RSAREF 1.0 library w/ Amiga files added</samp></pre>

	Users only need to get one of the first two files.  If you have a
	68020 or better, the 68020 version of PGP will be significantly
	faster than the other version on your machine.  The last two files
	together comprise the source code necessary to build your own version
	of a USA and Canada legal PGP 2.6.2.
</ul>
<b>DISTRIBUTABILITY</b>
<ul>
	PGPAmiga is freeware.
