<b>TITLE</b>
<h2>Xv for Amiga - Image display and manipulation program</h2>
<b>VERSION</b>
<ul>
	<h3>2.18 (X11 v.3.10a)</h3>
</ul>
<b>AUTHOR</b>
<ul>
	John Bradley

	Terje Pedersen (<a href="mailto:terjepe@hstud6.cs.uit.no">terjepe@hstud6.cs.uit.no</a>) ported it to Amiga.
	(Oterveien 55/9017 Tromsoe/Norway)
</ul>
<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
<ul>
	This is an Amiga port of the X11 program Xv by John Bradley.<p>

	The xv program displays images in the GIF, JPEG, TIFF, PBM, PGM, PPM,
	X11 bitmap, Utah Raster Toolkit RLE, PDS/VICAR, Sun Rasterfile, BMP,
	PCX, IRIS RGB, XPM, Targa, PhotoCD, XWD, possibly PostScript, and PM
	formats on workstations and terminals running the X11 Window System.
	The documentation for XV is now distributed only as a PostScript file,
	as it has gotten enormous, and is no longer very well suited to the
	'man' page format.  Print a copy of the (100-ish page) manual found in
	docs/xvdocs.ps.  If you are unable to get the manual to print on your
	printer, you may purchase a printed copy of the XV manual.  Click on
	'About XV' in the program to get further information.
</ul>
<b>NEW FEATURES</b>
<ul>
	Added PNG support and a truckload of more fixes.
</ul>
<b>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</b>
<ul>
	Amigas with 68020+ and MUI 2.0+ preferably with 6mb+. Manipulation
	on 24bit images will require a lot more memory.<br>
	A big Workbench may also be useful. (640x400 is a minimum)
</ul>
<b>AVAILABILITY</b>
<ul>
	An X11 version in source form is available on public.x.org and
	other X11 sites.<p>

	emulation (libX11) and my efforts at porting the program.
