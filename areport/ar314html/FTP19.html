<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
<ul>
	Yak stands for "Yet Another Kommodity" (never was any good at
	spelling), and is a mouse/window manipulation program along the
	same lines as MCP, MagicCX and lets you activating screens 
	and windows, inserting localized date.

<b>FEATURES</b>
<ul>
	A lot! Among them : AutoActivation of windows, extensible hotkey 
	system (like FKey's) with a lot of different actions
</ul>
<b>NEW FEATURES</b>
<ul>
	This is a major release of Yak, it introduces a lot of changes since Yak
	1.60. Yak 2.0 main goal was to provide more flexibility, this has been
	achieved by a new way to handle options for hotkey actions and by adding
	configurability to mouse cycling. Due to this, GUI code has expanded quite
	a lot, so now GUI is separated from the main commodity.
	Beside these major changes, there were also some less important ones among
	which: 
	<ul>
		<li>New option 'Activate only' for 'Cycle Windows' action. 

		<li>New toggle in 'miscellaneous' window : 'Full Workbench'.

		<li>KeyActivate is now disabled while a mouse button is pressed.

		<li>Added a 'Clear' gadget to the keydef window.

		<li>New toggle in 'miscellaneous' window : 'UNIX Dirs' 

		<li>New option for CycleWindows action, you can now specify a pattern
		on the name of the task which handle some windows. 
		
		<li>A new tooltype for the prefs program to let you choose your own
		font for Yak GUI independently from the screen font.
	</ul>
	There are also other changes not listed here, browse the doc and
	the GUI to find them.
