<b>TITLE</b>
<h1>"The Music Web"</h1>
<b>VERSION DATE</b>
<ul>
	<h3>Second Edition -- June 1995</h3>
</ul>
<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
<ul>
	The Music Web is an extensible, interactive, graphic-diagram platform
	on which you can build `webs' of elements that manipulate MIDI event
	streams.  Modules with specific functions can be `plugged together' by
	placing icons in a diagram and linking them to form a network; these
	two-dimensional, interlinked chains of elements give your creativity
	full rein to explore new effects.  [Caveat: the name has nothing to do
	with the World Wide Web! It was unfortunately chosen before the latter
	became well-known.]<p>

	Element modules in this edition include note filters and modifiers,
	an `Instrument' that plays 8SVX sample files, recording and playback,
	and a MIDI file player.  Full documentation is included in the archive.<p>

	You will probably be able to take best advantage of this package if
	you have some kind of multitimbral, multichannel MIDI setup, but it
	should be useful for even the simplest.  In fact the supplied initial
	demo will play standard MIDI files through the Amiga's (four) internal
	sound channels, witout any attached MIDI interface at all!  With more
	modules to come, I hope it can become one of the most flexible music
	environments around.<p>

	Many of the current functions:
	<ul>
		<li>MIDI IN and MIDI OUT (of course!)
		<li>Loudness (reduce velocity value of a note event)
		<li>Transpose (up or down by octaves and semitones)
		<li>Key Filter (block or divert specified notes of the scale)
		<li>Key Range (pass a specified range of notes)
		<li>Msg Filter (block or divert specified types of MIDI messages)
		<li>Channel Filter (block or divert specified MIDI channels)
		<li>Splitter (where events are actually diverted to another path)
		<li>Set Channel (of events on the path)
		<li>Delay (make delayed copies of note (and other) events)
		<li>Instrument (uses 8SVX IFF samples to play notes)
		<li>Note Off (generates a note-off for each note-on (use with Delay))
		<li>One Note (converts all notes to the same pitch (for sound FX))
		<li>Record/Playback
		<li>Read MIDI File (feeds record/playback element)
		<li>Monitor (events on the MIDI stream)
	</ul>
</ul>
<b>NEW FEATURES</b>
<ul>
	<li>Distinctive (icon) images for the various elements

	<li>Record/Playback

	<li>MIDI File playing

	<li>Other added modules
</ul>
<b>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</b>
<ul>
	The Music Web needs the 2.04 or later operating system; it should run
	in a 1MB machine.  It really needs something faster than a 68000 to
	be useful (though it will run on one).<p>

	Of course an essential requirement for most uses is a MIDI interface
	on the Amiga serial port.<p>

	Documentation is in AmigaGuide form, so you should really have this
	on your system (although you *can* read it without if you have to).
