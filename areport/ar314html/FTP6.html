<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
<ul>
	Knowledge-Based Systems encapsulate human knowledge to 
	perform tasks such as diagnosis, prediction and selection.  
	They are particularly appropriate for handling complexity 
	and uncertainty.  KBTools is a toolkit which supports the 
	construction and maintenance of Knowledge-Based Systems.<p>

	KBTools allows for full forward-chaining and 
	backward-chaining, uncertainty, probabilistic and bayesian 
	reasoning and provides a comprehensive set of inference 
	procedures. The emphasis is on ease of building Knowledge 
	Bases as Boxes and Arrows diagrams.  A flexible GUI 
	provides the interface between the Knowledge Engineer and 
	the Boxes and Arrows representation of the Knowledge Base.  
	The interface between the system and the end user is 
	configurable by the knowledge engineer.<p>

	We hope to bring this product to full commercial status; 
	the software released is a prototype version only.  We 
	are placing it in the public domain for the following 
	reasons:
	<ol>
		<li>To elicit any comments, suggestions and criticisms
		regarding the prototype software.

		<li>To allow people to develop and contribute knowledge 
		bases or ideas for knowledge bases. 

		<li>To contact people interested in registering as 
		developers. 
	</ol>
