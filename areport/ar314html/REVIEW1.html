<h2>Review: Aminet 6 CD-ROM</h2>
<h3>By:  <a href="JASON.html">Jason Compton</a><hr></h3>

With the recent decision to move the Aminet CDs to a bimonthly (rather than
quarterly) format, it's going to be difficult to keep up.  Apparently,
they're really doing that well, and Aminet's usage is at its highest.
Great, I say.<p>

Aminet 6's "headline" items include the entire collection of demos (many,
surprisingly enough, will run straight from CD, although you know those
wacky demo programmers, you may not be able to exit, or if you can, you may
wish you hadn't as a guru sneaks up on you and mightily crashes your system
when you least expect it), 520 megs of new material, and an authorized
collection of the entire Amiga Report archives up to and including AR 3.08
and the Auction issue.<p>

The familiar AmigaGuide interface is back (where would it possibly go?),
again, as always, in English and German, with a quick search utility and
the ability to run and view most items directly from CD with your favorite
utility using the prefs feature of the CD.  (Obviously, the prefs aren't
saved directly to the CD, but you can save them for future reference.)<p>

The collection of mods on this CD is enough to keep you busy enough, and
the "shuffle" button is a nice touch.  Pity it doesn't continually shuffle,
though.  A word of advice-Ignore Urban's ratings of the mods.  While I
usually don't disagree with his choices for terrible ratings (which are
fairly rare), he gives some high marks to some mediocre tunes.  To each his
own...<p>

The Amiga Report collection comes with something even I didn't have before
this-an article search utility, which lets you search all AmigaGuide issues
(1.14 onward) for a text string.  I LOVE this.  I'm constantly checking
back issues to help people with questions I KNOW I saw answered last
summer, or to find a phone number from a company I KNOW was in one of the
first issues this year, or...etc.  Sorry about not being able to search the
earliest issues.  I'm not even sure what the reasons were that made this
impossible, but it's not like you're missing too much.  They're nice to
have around, though, if for no other reason than to see how Amiga Report
has evolved.<p>

Aminet still holds a price of 25 DM, but authors of software that appears
on Aminet can contact Urban Mueller for a free CD.  Subscription deals are
also available from Aminet CD distributors.<p>

What else can be said?  Aminet continues to be the premier source for
redistributable software.  While nothing beats the speed of your local
mirror site, it's sometimes nice to have the goods available at your
convenience, limited only by the speed of your CD-ROM drive.<p>
