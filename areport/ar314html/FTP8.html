<b>TITLE</b>
<h1>InfraRexx</h1>
<h3>(and InfraJoy hardware design)</h3>
<b>VERSION</b>
<ul>
	<h3>1.6a<br></h3>
	(and InfraJoy version 4.0)
</ul>
<b>RELEASE DATE</b>

<b>AUTHORS</b>
<ul>
	Leon Woestenberg (<a href="mailto:leon@stack.urc.tue.nl">leon@stack.urc.tue.nl</a>)<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
<ul>
	The InfraRexx software along with the InfraJoy hardware serve as
	an ARexx-Infrared interface, that adds the function of an infrared
	remote controller to your Amiga, and more.<p>

	With this software and hardware you can:
<ul>
<li>Control external audio/video devices via ARexx commands.
<li>Control Amiga programs via a common remote control unit.
<li>Learn and edit new remote control infrared commands.
</ul>
	For example you can control a moduleplayer via your compact
	disc player remote control unit. Or, control your video tape
	recorder via a graphic user interface or an ARexx script.<p>

	The main features are:
	<ul>
		<li>Seperate editor (with learner) and ARexx host commodity.
		<li>Multitasking-friendly infrared sampling monitor, with very
		low system overhead during monitoring; can also be disabled.
		<li>Font-sensitive, style-compliant graphic user interface.
		<li>Supports localization under Workbench 2.1 (or better).
		<li>Uses AmigaOS 3.x functions and gadtools features if present.
		<li>Modular lowcost hardware for joystickport, with throughput.
		<li>Uses the Amiga Installer Utility to install onto (hard)disk.
	</ul>
</ul>
<b>CHANGES</b>
<ul>
	<li>Release 1.6a differs from 1.6 by a bugfix in the schematics.
	<li>Building plans and documentation for new v4.0 hardware.
	<li>Added support for new hardware's multifrequency feature.
	<li>Added german and norwegian language catalog translations.
	<li>Improved RexxEvent; now handles multiple events in one call.
	<li>Optional MagicWB icons installable via the Installer utility.
</ul>
<b>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</b>
<ul>
	InfraRexx needs at least AmigaOS version 2.04, and the commodity
	needs RexxMast to be running in order to be useful. The software
	is useless without the small InfraJoy hardware add-on, off which
	the design and full building instructions are included. The
	hardware can also be ordered from one of the authors.
