<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
<ul>
	QuickText is an interactive desktop video program designed to
	easily develop and display almost any type of graphic screen, 
	including titles and credits, pictures, and even animations.  
	Other features include full ARexx support, automatic screen 
	sequencing, on-screen timer, text and numeric variables, a 
	recordable & replayable "doodler", and an easy-to-use point-and-
	click interface.<p>

	A pre-commercial version of QuickText has been used for 6 
	years in a high-school "down-stream" computer with a simple 
	genlock in a daily, live newscast and in taping sports events for
	local TV cable.<p>

	It can be used in presentations, reader-boards, kiosks, and
	silent pager.<p>

	Supports both PAL and NTSC video modes.<p>

	Soon to be released, QuickText PRO will feature remote-control
	via modem, time-of-day slots, and tiled backdrops.
