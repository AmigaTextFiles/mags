Zipperware is pleased to announce that as of July 1, 1995, Zipperware is
expanding by a friendly takeover of Northwest Public Domain (NPD).  We will
continue providing the excellent support and service you've been getting
from NPD.  We would like to wish John McNab, owner of NPD, success with his
new ventures now and in the future.  Thank you all for your continued
support of the Amiga, NPD, and Zipperware!<p>

Christopher Maland, Owner<p>
