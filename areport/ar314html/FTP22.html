DISTRIBUTABILITY
<ul>
	The archive may be spread through BBS, Internet, AmiNet and on Public
	Domain disks as long as the archive is not modified in any way. This
	means that you can copy it freely as long as you don't ask for a more than
	nominal copying fee. This fee must not be more than US $5 or 5 DM. It
	would be much appreciated if magazines notified me through e-mail or
	ordinary mail if they include Recall on a cover-disk.<p>

	If you wish to include Recall on a magazine cover disk, you may do so as
	long as you send a complimentary copy of the magazine issue in which it
	appears to my home address. The entire package must be included on the
	disk, not just the executable. Please contact me in advance to ensure you
	have the latest version.<p>

	If you wish to supply Recall as part of a CD-ROM compilation of freeware,
	you may do so as long as the disc contains at least 20 Mb of other
	freeware. Otherwise, contact me first please. Explicit permission is
	granted to distribute Recall on any CD-ROM produced by Fred Fish / Amiga
	Library Services, and on any officially supported Aminet compilation CD-
	ROM.
