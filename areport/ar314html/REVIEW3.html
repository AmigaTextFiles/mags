PRICE:  I paid US$75.95, this includes $6 S&H.<p>

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The Advanced Amiga Analyzer will work on any Amiga
model.<p>

SYSTEM TESTED ON:  <br>
Amiga 2000 (Rev 4.4), ECS chip set, GForce '030 accelerator @ 50 MHz., 2 MB
CHIP + 8 MB FAST memory, Quantum LPS270S hard drive with Trumpcard
Professional controller, Picasso II RTG board, ioExtender, Workbench 3.1<p>

PACKAGING: The hardware, 8 page dittoed manual, and floppy disk of software
all came in a bubble wrap envelope.<p>

INSTALLATION: The Analyzer hardware consists of a plastic box
(5"x2.5"x1.5") with four port dongles, a joystick port pass-through and
eight LEDs (parallel, video, serial and mouse).  To conduct the preliminary
hardware test you must first power-down your computer and attach the
serial, parallel, video, and joystick port dongles (A1000 requires gender
changers.) Turn the computer back on and check that all the LEDs are lit. 
If one or more did not light up then this indicates a problem with the
corresponding port(s).  If all of the LEDs lit then power-down the computer
and remove the mouse and video port dongles.  Reattach your mouse and
monitor and power-up the computer with the supplied disk in the drive.<p>

TESTING: The Analyzer's software boots up into the Gameport tester screen.
From this screen you can see a graphical representation of your mouse and
joystick ports.  By moving your mouse in all directions and pressing any
single or combination of mouse buttons, you will see a light appear in the
corresponding pin position(s).  The mouse X and Y coordinates are also
displayed on this screen.  The same happens when moving your joystick in
all directions and pressing the fire button(s).  If any of the
corresponding lights do not light then this indicates a problem with that
specific pin on the port.  By clicking on any of the graphical
representations of the port pins a text box will appear indicating what
this particular pin controls and what hardware to check on the Amiga for
possible causes of the problem.<p>

It should be noted that the diagnostic information comes from the A2000
schematics.  While other models vary, the general chips should be similar
enough to allow you to troubleshoot any model Amiga.<p>

There are a series of buttons at the bottom of the main screen.  By
clicking on any one of these you will be taken to that testing or
information screen.<p>

PARALLEL: This screen contains a graphical representation of the parallel
port's 25 pins.  Each pin may be clicked on to see what it controls and
what hardware to check in case of malfunction.  A parallel port test is
also included.  By clicking on the Run Test button you will initiate a
parallel port test using the hardware and software of the Analyzer.  The
test is ended by clicking on the End Test button.  Any errors that may have
occurred will appear in a window with the complete explanation for what
hardware to check.  If the test was passed then the window will indicate
this.<p>

SERIAL: This screen contains a graphical representation of the serial
port's 25 pins.  Each pin may be clicked on to see what it controls and
what hardware to check in case of malfunction.  A serial port test is also
included.  By clicking on the Run Test button you will initiate a serial
port test using the hardware and software of the Analyzer.  The test is
ended by clicking on the End Test button.  Any errors that may have
occurred will appear in a window with the complete explanation for what
hardware to check.  If the test was passed then the window will indicate
this.<p>

MEMORY: This screen contains two windows.  One window displays all CHIP,
FAST and other expansion memory that is installed on your computer.  The
other window displays any errors that may have occurred during testing. 
When you click on the Run Test button, a memory test is done on all
installed memory.  A display at the top of the screen shows which pass
number the test is on, as well as the address block and current address of
the test in progress.  The test is ended by clicking on the End Test
button.  If no errors were found then a Test Passed requestor will appear;
otherwise, the lower window will display the errors that were encountered.<p>

DISK: This screen allows you to test any of up to four floppy drives that
are connected to the computer.  You can initiate either a READ ONLY or a
READ/WRITE test on any of the floppy drives. <p>

The READ ONLY test will only test for read errors on the inserted floppy
disk(s) in the drive(s) to be tested.  As each track is read from, a green
box will appear with the error number encountered, if any.  This test will
continue until you click on the End Test button.<p>

The READ/WRITE test will check for read and write errors on the inserted
floppy disk(s) in the drive(s) to be tested.  Each track is tested by
performing two write and read tests, and as each track is read from a green
box will appear with the error number encountered, if any.  This test will
continue until you click on the End Test button.<p>

If you encountered any errors while testing the floppy drives then you can
click on the ERRS button to see a list of seventeen possible errors.<p>

You may also check the drive alignment for any floppy drive by using the
READ/WRITE test on a known good floppy drive and disk.  Take the good
floppy disk and insert it into the suspect drive and then run a READ ONLY
test on this drive.  If you encounter any errors then this drive's
alignment is questionable.<p>

VIDEO: This screen contains a graphical representation of the video port's
23 pins.  Each pin may be clicked on to see what it controls and what
hardware to check in case of malfunction.  A video port test is not
available.  The hardware of the Analyzer will only test the integrity of
the three power pins on the video port.<p>

CONFIG: This screen will display the following information about the system
being tested:<p>
<ul>
<li>ROM version
<li>Agnus version
<li>Denise version
<li>CPU
<li>FPU
<li>Display (NTSC or PAL)
<li>Any expansion boards installed
<li>All memory installed
</ul>
AUDIO: This screen displays four boxes on the screen (one for each of the
four Amiga audio channels) which contain a musical scale.  When you click
on the Run Test button a scale of notes will be played through each of the
four sound channels one at a time.  This test will continue until you click
on the End Test button.  If, during the test, you don't hear some or any of
the notes being played then this could indicate a problem with the
hardware.<p>

MORE TO COME: This is the most annoying button on the screen!  The author
tells you how he's constantly trying to upgrade the hard/software.  This is
all well and good, but he asks that you contact him with any ideas or
comments you may have -- he also neglects to give you any contact
information In four different locations throughout the manual, software,
and readme file.  This makes it quite difficult to do.<p>

HELP: This button appears on each of the above testing and information
screens.  When you click on this button a window will appear which explains
the current screen's testing procedure.<p>

DISLIKES: The cables that lead to the various ports could stand to be a bit
longer.  It is usable now, but 6 more inches of cable wouldn't hurt.  The
dongles for the ports could use better screws.  The ones included need a
flat blade screwdriver -- using the thumb screw approach would be much
better (the type found on most modern cables.) I would also like to see the
inclusion of an Email and/or snail mail contact address for the author.  He
goes out of his way in asking for suggestions and comments, but doesn't
supply the needed information for submitting these suggestions and
comments.<p>

SUMMARY: All in all the Advanced Amiga Analyzer is a useful tool.  It can
be used to analyze your current Amigas or possible purchases of used
equipment.  It saves you the trouble of opening up the computer to see what
boards and chips are installed, as well as eliminating the fear of buying
defective, used equipment.  The Analyzer can track down 90% of Amiga
hardware failures and suggests some very good leads on what parts of the
hardware to check.  If the Analyzer saves you from making one service visit
or from buying one defective, used Amiga, then it's more than paid for
itself.
