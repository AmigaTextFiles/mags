<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
<ul>
	fMSX Amiga emulates an MSX computer on an Amiga. In its current
	state it will run cartridge based games (not included but
	available through FTP and WWW) and allow you to play around
	with MSX BASIC.<p>

	Action speaks louder than words, and most of the action can
	be found in games, so I'll just list some of the available
	software titles:
	<pre><samp>    Loderunner               Raid on Bungeling Bay    Zaxxon
    Bosconian (1)            Falcon (2)               Eggerland Mystery
    Grog's revenge           Guardic                  Knightlore
    Knightmare               Oil's Well               Payload
    QBert                    Tank Battalion           Thexder (3)
    Twinbee                  Zanac                    Digdug</samp></pre>

	(1) With speech!<br>
	(2) You read that right, and it is the original version.<br>
	(3) And it runs faster than the Amiga version - the mind boggles.<p>

	Of course fMSX Amiga is fully multitasking, runs in an intuition
	screen, and has a font-sensitive user interface.
</ul>
<b>NEW FEATURES</b>
<ul>
	Speed! fMSX Amiga now has two ways of redrawing the screen,
	OS-friendly and highspeed.<p>

	The OS-friendly mode, which was also available in the previous
	version, should work with everything from OCS to graphics cards.
	This mode is slightly faster than before.<p>

	Highspeed mode takes over the screen, and uses the coprocessors
	for updating the screen, resulting in a massive speed boost.
	In this mode multitasking is still left enabled, but the copper,
	blitter, and screen are constantly in use by the emulation.
	This mode is obviously not compatible with graphics cards.<p>

	It is at all times possible to toggle between the two modes with
	a simple keypress.<p>

	Other features include greatly enhanced sound, support for joysticks
	with two buttons, and lots of bugfixes.
</ul>
<b>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</b>
<ul>
	Required are:
	<ul>
		<li>Amiga OS 3.0
		<li>68020 processor
		<li>400 kilobytes chip ram
		<li>700 kilobytes other ram
	</ul>
	Recommended:
	<ul>
		<li>68030 processor, at least 25MHz
		<li>Those 700 kilobytes of 'other' ram had better be fast ram!
	</ul>
	Note that fMSX Amiga does *not* require the AGA chipset. In fact,
	it should run on any chipset upto and including graphics cards,
	although this has not been tested.
</ul>
