<h1><hr>Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users<hr></h1>
<h2>The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone</h2>
<h3>The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information</h3>
Portal is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-service online SIG
(Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users. We promise, and
WE DELIVER ongoing & aggressive Amiga support!<p>
You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in many ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA high-speed modems (you pay for the phone call
if it's not local), or though any SprintNet or Compu$erve indial anywhere
(with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).<p>
Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.<p>
Portal is NOT just another shell service!  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help, and you can easily customize
it for your favorite terminal program and screen size.<p>
Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:<p>
<ul>
<li>2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
online, we've lost count!
<li>The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
online.  ALL 1000 disks!
<li>Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
once, of any size, with one command.
<li>Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, Elastic
Reality (ASDG), Soft-Logik, Apex Publishing, and others.
<li>40 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 10,000 files.  Hot new stuff
arrives daily.
<li>No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
<li>Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
any other online service.
<li>Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
related and get quick replies from the experts.
<li>Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, AMosaic, LightWave, EGS,
OpalVision & others feed right into the Zone message bases.  Read
months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with them.
<li>FREE unlimited Internet Email with 5 meg of free storage.
<li>A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.
You can run Amiga Mosaic through your shell and explore the
vast World Wide Web!
<li>Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which you can read
and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
imagine.
<li>Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
never worry "Ooops... Am I paying for this area?" again!
<li>Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  And you get FREE unlimited
usage of all of them.
<li>Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
Workbench 2.04 or higher)
<li>Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
