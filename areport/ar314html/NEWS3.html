Subject: Attn: New address/email for Silicon Prairie (HyperCache)<p>

Since it seems the "number has changed" message has expired on the old
phone number, you might want to make note of the new address for Silicon
Prairie Software (makers of HyperCache Pro):<p>

(We've been here almost two years, but still a lot of mail goes to our old
address.  So, here's the "new" one)<p>

Silicon Prairie Software<br>
N202-4771 148th Ave NE<br>
Bellevue, WA 98007<br>
(206) 556-0618<p>

email support: <a href="mailto:hyper@iceonline.com">hyper@iceonline.com</a><p>

In response to a few questions of late:<p>

Yes, we are still alive!<br>
Yes, we are still producing and supporting HyperCache.<br>
Yes, it really should be built into the operating system :-)<p>
