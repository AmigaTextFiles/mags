Brrrr.

The February chill descends upon us.  Retail sales traditionally are
poorest this month, so try to keep your favorite commercial developer in
good spirits.

The rest of the market plods on.  Cheaper RAM is the biggest substantial
news in the pipelines, a lot of the rest of it is the same old posturing.

The Amiga hurtles towards its first anniversary with Escom, and Commodore's
second "deathday."

Even as we speak, independent engineering firms are at work on the Amiga,
re-engineering the chipset and trying to come up with a new "stopgap"
machine to show off at Cebit in March.

AT won't talk much about this machine except to say it will be AGA and will
have Zorro slots.  The "A1200+" will not be built, however.

The A1200 Surfer pack is being test-marketed in Germany, and we're looking
forward to receiving our own to review in the near future.  AT may just
have put together a price/performance package that can sell in appreciable
numbers.

But for now it's a waiting game.  If you like, say a few words of
remembrance for the soon to be devoured Atari Corp, which, like Commodore,
pioneered so much but in the end will wind up just like Commodore--a brand
name for a mainstream PC company. 

So enjoy what you have.  The upcoming CeBit and World of Amiga UK shows
should prove quite telling.  No more "we're just getting started" excuses
for AT.  It'll be cards-on-the-table time for them and for the industry,
and we're all waiting to see the ace the AT boys have been, hopefully,
working on for a while.

Jason

P.S.  On a completely unrelated note, I've been lucky enough to have a
chance to sit down at the keyboard of a Draco recently.  The incredible
speed of this thing has to be seen to be believed.  It really makes you
appreciate the fact that the 060 is indeed available and that, with any
luck, we'll be seeing PowerPC availability for the Amiga in due time.  The
Draco certainly isn't priced for everyone, but is a pretty righteous Amiga
software performer if you throw the right tasks at it.

From: Michael Wilkins (michaelb@mbox.kyoto-inet.or.jp)
Subject: Hi from an Amigan in Kyoto, Japan

Hello

I'm an Aussie married to a Japanese (2 kids) living here in chilly Kyoto.

I bought a CSA Derringer 030 25mhz, 882 50 mhz + 16 meg this year.  It uses
some CSA osftware "D3" in the user startup to promote speed enhancing
modes, one of which (D3 -res) maps the kickstart image into a special area
that will survive a warm re-boot and also further enhance speed.  After
installing OS3.1, I lost the warm re-boot facility and thus accordingly
some speed.

I have only a tech contact telephone number for CSA, which is a recorded
message and despite leaving messages with appeals for email contact,
nothing.

Is CSA still in business?  Do you have a number or email address for them?

Does anyone know of any way to cure this warm re-boot problem?

I do not have news "Posting" ability yet so I'm hoping you might kindly ask
some knowledgeable soul to help out a very isolated Amiga fanatic.

I'm interested in hearing from any CSA Derringer owners.


     Unfortunately, I don't have any contact information for CSA.  Perhaps
     someone out there can give him a hand?  -Jason

[Honestly, I'm not trying to hearken back to the Atari-slanted Amiga Report
days of old.  But the 90's do seem to be the decade of collapse for the
pioneers in the personal computing industry, and it's worth noting that
Commodore is not alone.  -Jason]

DOW JONES NEWS 02-13-96  10:09 AM
Sunnyvale, Calif.  (Dow Jones) -- Atari Corp. (ATC) and JTS Corp.
agreed to merge.

August Liguori, chief financial officer of Atari, said the transaction is a
stock swap for about 40 million Atari common shares, valued at about $80
million.

Liguori said Atari will continue to support its Jaguar video-game system
through 1996, despite heavy competition from Sony Corp.'s (SNE) Playstation
and Sega Enterprises Ltd.'s Saturn systems.

JTS Corp., of San Jose, Calif., is a privately held maker of computer disk
drives.

Atari said in a press release that under the agreement the merged company
will operate under the name of JTS Corp.  and the current officers of JTS
Corp.  will become the officers of the merged company.  The Atari
entertainment business and the JTS disk drive business will operate as
separate divisions of the merged company.

The boards of Atari and JTS approved a definitive agreement for the merger.
Closing, set for the end of the second calendar quarter, is subject to some
shareholder and regulatory approvals and other conditions.

After the merger, Atari shareholders will own about 60% of the outstanding
shares of the new company.  The transaction is structured as a tax-free
reorganization and will be accounted for as a purchase.

Atari also said it extended a $25 million bridge loan to JTS Corp.  and if
the merger is not consummated, the loan will be convertible into JTS series
A preferred shares at the option of Atari or JTS and subject to some
conditions.

We're pleased to 'officially' announce the going-live of our Website for
support, information and sales of all Almathera's products, including
Photogenics, Video Creator and our CD-ROM range.  [We're currently doing
specials on all our products to free up some space around here, including
CDs from UKP3.99, Video Creator for UKP10 and Photogenics for UKP45, a
saving of UKP15 on the RRP]

Point your browser at http://www.compulink.co.uk/~almathera/ - currently
it's big on text and small on graphics, but it'll be expanding [links,
info, forms, imaps, more downloadables] soon.  Suggestions, crosslinks,
gripes, feedback, orders [!], all are welcome.

In case you missed the Aminet upload listings, Photogenics is now at
release 1.2a, which is a patch application for 1.2 HD users and can be
found in biz/patch/pgs12-12a.lha on your local Aminet site - unfortunately
for floppy-only users, the disk structure between 1.2 and 1.2a changed
radically and a patch is impractical, however if you return your disks to
Almathera and cover return post, we'll remaster free of charge.

And the EuroScene 2 CD-ROM is out - the best of the demo-scene's releases
during '95.  Reviews soon, and more information available via the website.

PRESS RELEASE *** FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE *** PRESS RELEASE

Team AMIGA - JOIN TODAY!

What is Team AMIGA?  Team AMIGA started life as a tongue-in-cheek joke in
the FidoNet AMIGA (international) echo conference, by my signing my
messages as:

Ricardo.Amiga
Charter Member, Team AMIGA

It was just a fun poke in the ribs at the "other" team we all know and love
for our rival platform, the PC.  I was wondering how long it would take for
someone to get a boot out of it.

Instead, all I got was inquiries like "Hey, this sounds like a great idea!
What _is_ Team AMIGA and how can I join?"

After getting tired of explaining that it was just a joke, I stepped back
and took a look at the concept.  I talked it over with a few of the more
well known denizens of the AMIGA echo, and decided maybe it was a good idea
after all and not just a joke.

With almost three hundred members as of today, from Russia to Australia,
Spain to the United States and Canada, Team AMIGA is growing daily, so fast
that I have a hard time keeping up with entries to the database in my free
time.

There are no dues, there are no real "rules" (of course, it goes without
saying that software pirates and known crackers/phreakers, etc.  are not
members...).  There are no officers (well maybe except myself, but all I am
doing is trying to co-ordinate efforts and communicate with Amiga
Technologies, GmbH.  ATG is reportedly looking very seriously at the
activities of Team AMIGA and we hope to attain a good working relationship
with them.  Until these negotiations are final, we are holding off on doing
some things we really want to get busy on, like having a contest to design
a team logo, T-shirts, bumperstickers and other paraphernalia with the
logo, membership cards that we would be working with vendors to give
discounts to Team AMIGA members, etc.

Basically, Team AMIGA exists to show _our_ committment to the Amiga, as
ATGmbH has shown us.  We want both to continue and thrive.

Team AMIGA is also very much _un_like another "union" that (I'm not sure
even still exists), is very demanding and makes threats to ATG saying
essentially, "You do what we want or else." Team AMIGA exists solely to
_support_ the efforts of Amiga Technologies in whatever way we can, not
bite the hand that feeds by making demands.

Below is the template that is posted in the AMIGA FidoNet echo conference,
as well as cross posted in many other networks, as well as many Internet
NewsGroups.

We hope _you_ will take the time to fill out the application and get it to
Team AMIGA!

[BEGINNING OF TEXT INSERT]

This is a regular posting in the international AMIGA echo for prospective
Team AMIGA members.  Please use the template below to send in your request
to join.

Feel free to cross-post the below to other networks and services liberally!

8<---cross post beginning--cut here---8<---

In the FidoNet AMIGA echo, we've started our own "kick in the pants"
response to the PC's TEAM OS/2.  It's taking off like wildfire!  We'd like
to extend the invite to every Amiga devotee, everywhere!  We have hundreds
of members from several countries and from Fido, Internet and on-line
services.

It's free.  There are no dues.  There are no rules.  There are no officers.
There are no idiots with a sense of pretentiousness (like CCISU or whatever
the name of that "club" for Amiga Sysops was...  ;).

To join, all you have to do is:

1) Swear that you are an Amiga enthusiast who extols the virtues of the
Amiga to anyone and everyone you meet who is interested in computers
(ESPECIALLY the PC crowd!  ;) and now that the Amiga's future is looking
up, you'll continue to do so even more fervently than before.

2) If you decide to join, fill out the application below and send it to me
to be added to the list, so if there are any billion dollar sweepstakes
prizes or warehouses of Amigas to be awarded (WINK WINK, GRIN GRIN ;) ,
we'll know how to contact you.  Seriously, a database is being kept and
will be forwarded to AT/Escom, should they decide to pick up the ball and
run.

(Footnote: Since this all started, we do know that Amiga Technologies is
observing Team AMIGA activities closely and has expressed interest in the
near future of "officially recognizing" us.

One objective of Team AMIGA of course, was to get as many Amiga enthusiasts
worldwide to make a statement of support, but another objective, is to show
AT/Escom how much of a mistake it would be to not adequately support other
continents, like North America and Australia)

3) Always acknowledge that I am the one who started all this (hey, I want
SOME credit!  (It's a JOKE, people, a JOKE!  ;)

4) Know and understand that your stats will be in a database kept by me
(Rick Lembree) and _not_ released to _anyone_.  If it comes to the point
that AT/Escom wants to take the ball on this, they are the _only_ ones I
will release the database to, and I will at that time ask that if they
release the database to other companies, that they be released only to
AMIGA oriented ones.

The only other thing we ask of you, is if you use the name in your on-line
signature, that you type it exactly as shown below:

                               Team AMIGA

The reason is for consistency, and for recognition.  If everyone types it a
different way, it appears that we don't "have our act together".

If you agree to all the above, just send in the following information:

(Important!  Please use this template as is and with ALL necessary info
requested to facilitate database entry, ok?  If replying from a Fido node,
don't assume that I will have your Fido address when doing the database! 
INCLUDE IT in the template!  Thanks.  :)

@toc NEWS

[While past the deadline stated in this news item, I felt it was worth
reprinting.  Originally from various Usenet groups.]

Hello all,

This may not be the appropriate venue to make this offer however due to the
time contraints involved the Internet seemed the best way to put this
information out.  Please read all the way through this message and I hope
you will not be dissappointed.

Silent Paw Productions, the makers of the PAWS - Portable Amiga Workstation
and the Gecko, are currently seeking investors who believe in the Amiga.
This is mainly due to a recent situation where a distributor, that was to
provide needed capital, had to bail out at the last minute to deal with
reorganization issues within their own company.

What we are currently offering is the following :

* With the purchase of 20 shares from Silent Paw you may choose to recieve
one of our products free.  This free product will be delievered within 3
months of the beginning of production.  For each addition 20 shares you may
choose another free product.

An example would be, I purchased 40 shares of Silent Paw stock and with
that purchase I selected to recieve free one PAWS 1200 and one Gecko.

The maximum amount of shares that can be purchased is 400.  Any share
purchase beyond 100 will gain you certain other benifits.

The minumum purchase is 20 shares ( $5,000 ).  I realize that this is alot
of money, for most of you, but the nature of our development has us heavily
invested in the company as well.

All share purchases will recieve a stock certificate, share holders
agreement, and a yearly company performance report and benifit from yearly
dividends.

Other options :

* Short term investments with Silent Paw.  Short term loans to our company
are being paid back at very attractive rates.  6 months = 17% and 1 year =
25%.

Minumum for short term investment is $10,000.

An example would be : I give Silent Paw $10,000 for a 6 month loan.  After
that 6 months I am paid back $11,700.  If it was for one year I would be
paid back $12,500.

These offers are good until Feb 5th.  This is a short time to respond
however,due to the very rapidly changing situation with investors, this is
necessary for Silent Paw to keep on track with production schedules.

Buy a piece of a cutting edge Amiga development company and be part of the
next generation of Amiga products.  Invest in Silent Paw Productions, Inc.

Please feel free to call me at any of the numbers below or send
E-Mail to Silent Paws address.

Thanks all,

   AMIGA SET TO RETURN TO CENTRE STAGE WITH MAJOR NEW NATIONAL SHOWCASE

The Amiga is set to return to centre stage on the UK computer scene with a
major new showcase event to be held in APRIL.

Sponsered by Amiga Technologies GmbH, the German based subsidiary of Escom,
the show is being developed to effectively relaunch the Amiga following the
rescue of the machine from the ruins of Commodore.

World of Amiga '96 has been designed as a major public platform to
rehabilitate the Amiga in the eyes of the existing user base - as well as a
potential new generation of Amigoids - and to provide the Amiga business
sector with a significant source of revenue.

All the top Amiga companies are expected to attend the event - to be held
on Saturday and Sunday, April 13 / 14 at the Novatel, Hammersmith.

Supported by all the major Amiga titles, the show line up will include;

- Amiga Technologies GmbH which will use the event to unveil all the latest
  development for the Amiga.  (though yet to be confirmed, it is expected
  that the new Amiga 1200+ will have its first public showing in the uk at
  the event.)

[As the A1200+ has been cancelled, this is not going to happen.  However,
AT has indicated that its replacement will hopefully be on display in some
form or other by CeBIT. -Jason]

- Key software developers, many of whom have been holding Amiga packages on
  the backburner in the light of recent problems, but are now rushing to
  complete them in time to use the event as a launch pad.

- Add on developers whose interest in the Amiga has been stimulated once
  again.

- Amiga distributors.

- Amiga dealers from throughout the UK.

SHOW FEATURES ;

- A Games Arcade

- High End Applications

- Retailers

- Technical Advice Centre ( Being Manned by ICPUG )

World of Amiga organisers PBA Events has retained the services of one of
the most experienced show promotion agenciesin this sector, Cape Cowley
Associates, to ensure a well attended event.  CCA has previously been
responsible for the launch of ECTS, Computer Shopper and the Future
Entertainment Show.

"All the components are inplace for an AMIGA event, like of which we have
not seen since the hey day of the machine," says Peter Brameld of PBA
Events.

"We have a new and well financed manufacturer behind both the machine and
the event, all the Amiga mags have promised active support, all third
parties are eager to make money - and there is still a substantial user
base out there."

"Just how substantial can be seen by the fact on leading games house
recently sold 50,000 units of an Amiga version of one of its blockbuster
titles.  Now if that doesn't prove there is still life in this sector, I
don't know what does."

"World of Amiga '96 will provide the catalyst for the rebirth of the Amiga.
So let the good times roll again......"

DESCRIPTION

RevUp manages version strings following the Amiga standard for including in
own programs, e.g.  '$VER: YourTool 2.4 (11.9.95)'.

It's a must for every serious C, Oberon or Assembler programmer, so have a
look at it!  Your makefiles together with RevUp will do all the work for
you.

RevUp <version> <projectname> {<dependency>} [REV <revision>]
      [BETA] [C] [ASM] [OBERON] [LOG] [EXTRA] [ENVVAR] [TINY]

Required:
 VERSION     : Version number.
 PROJECTNAME : Basename to use for all RevUp files.
 DEPENDENCIES: Files which dates are checked.

Optional:
 REV   : Explicit revision number.
 BETA  : Generate beta information.
 C     : Generate C headerfile (default).
 ASM   : Generate Assembly includefile.
 OBERON: Generate Oberon definition module.
 LOG   : Interactively add history info to logfile.
 EXTRA : Generate extra information.
 ENVVAR: Set envvar for archive naming.
 TINY  : Don't print credits.

EXAMPLE

> RevUp 1 SuperTool EXTRA

generates SuperTool_rev.h:

/* C headerfile generated by RevUp 1.3 */

#define VERSION     1
#define REVISION    1
#define DATE        12.7.95"
#define VERS        "SuperTool 1.1"
#define VSTRING     "SuperTool 1.1 (12.7.95)\\r\\n"
#define VERSTAG     "\\0$VER: SuperTool 1.1 (12.7.95)"
#define TIME        "14:57:51"
#define PRGNAME     "SuperTool"
#define BASENAME    "SUPERTOOL"
#define VSTR        "SuperTool 1.1 (12.7.95)"
#define USER        "boris"
#define HOST        "prox"

User and Host are imported from environment variables.

FEATURES

o RevUp generates and maintains include and header files with revision
  information.

o Basically RevUp is similar to the developer tool BumpRev, but it offers a
  lot of additional features.

o ANSI-C, Oberon and Assembly language supported.

o Multiple dependency files.

o Beta count management for beta versions included.

o Interactive logfile generation.

CHANGES SINCE 1.3 (17.11.95)

FIX: RevUp no longer displays an error message, if file to overwrite didn't
already exist.
NEW: UserName is now always appended to the log file, even if HostName is
not set.
NEW: TIME to logfile.  VERSTAG to stdout.  Empty log messages are now
possible.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

   Kickstart 2.04
   Workbench 2.0

   Workbench 2.1 for localized DOS error messages.

@toc NEWS

The Latest News from XTR........

None of the following is definite in any way so don`t come knocking on my
door if they never appear!!  However, there shouldn`t be any problems.

XTR CDROM - due to a problem with delayed/lost email some files went
missing.  A gold disc is being done next week and if that goes ok then
expect the game to be available by the end of the month.  The CDROM will
run on a CD32 and can also be partially or fully installed onto HD.  The
partial install is very small, and saves are made to the install directory.

XTR Editor - just got a couple of bugs to remove and much of the On-Line
manual to write (yuck!).  Goes into Beta-Testing in 7-10 days time.  The
editor resembles a Doom editor more than a track editor.  It is quite
complex since it is effectively one of our in-house utils, but if we can
use it, you can!  It features :

Fully OS3 compliant - yes, you can multitask and use it on gfx boards and
set the number of colours to use etc.

Friendly and Intuitive to use - standard Amiga menus with keyboard
shortcuts.  Full set of preferences.

Include your own tile sets and objects - example palettes to be included in
the distribution.

Track layout is done by placing tiles upon a simple grid.

Layout all the track boundaries, computer car routes, drop down points,
surfaces (inc.  jumps, water, etc), secret paths, etc.

That gives you some idea of how powerful it is.  But it will take a few
hours to learn to use purely because its not a simple thing to do.  A quick
step guide is included via a window that you can have on the screen at all
times - you can scroll through this window to see what you should do at
each step.

XTR Extra Tracks - 5 completely new tilesets and objects sets.  Sillier
than before, and more objects than before (just for those of us with faster
machines!).

Updated Frontend and Race executables - time and disc space allowing there
maybe updated versions on the extra tracks discs.  The main aim is to have
each player able to select an Easy driving mode which doesn`t slide around
- boring but easy.  And also I may adapt the computer cars to slow down if
you are doing badly, so you don`t get left behind too quickly.

4 player joystick adapter support - its coded in but not tested yet!  The
coder has been busy buying and playing with a yucky P120 sysytem.

Warp Engine bug - We have found someone who has a problem on his machine
that is similar to this bug.  We know where the problem is now but not
quite what the cause is.  This is being looked over this very minute.  
Fingers crossed.

The Editor/Extra tracks/New Execs will hopefully be released early April,
maybe for a certain Amiga show if we can nab a space on a stand somewhere
:) They will be part of one package and will require the original XTR to
run.  Since there is quite a lot there including effectively a new version
of XTR that takes into account what critics haven`t liked (its too
difficult for them!!!) the price will probably be around 19.99 UKP.

Best Lap Times - we are just writing a couple of quick utils to enable you
display all your best lap times from any track (including add-ons) quickly,
and also another program to go through several lap time files find the best
lap times.  There will be included in the aminet patch to be uploaded in
the next 14 days (delayed slightly, many apologies)

XTR Web Site - I looked at some html on Friday and decided it was a price
of piss, so I am doing some proper Web pages.  These will include any news
about XTR, ordering information, screenshots of XTR, its editor, and the
extra tracks, a best lap time table, some hints about secret paths etc.,
and anything else you feel should be on there.  If there is enough disk
space it will also include the patches, some extra tracks, and so on.
Otherwise it should point to somewhere on aminet where the should be
stored.

I have had a couple of kind offers of web sites but if anyone (esp.  in the
UK on a fast site) has 2-3megs+ of space then please can they contact me. 
Very little work would need doing on the pages by anyone other than myself.
Eventually I will extend this site to include any other projects of ours,
although we may find our own site at that point.   Anyone know good places
to get cheap fast web sites?

published by : Andreas Neumann
Email:  <neumanna@stud-mailer.uni-marburg.de>

DESCRIPTION

The AmigaGadget is a freely distributable magazine.   Most of its articles
are in German language, only a few ones are written in English.  The
subjects covered range from news about the Amiga to jokes and stories (if
there still is any kind of difference..?) :

    - "Aktuell"    (= News)
    - "Forum"      (= Discussion, interviews, letters to 
                      the editor, ...)
    - "Tests"      (= Reviews of hardware, software, 
                      CD-ROMs, ...)
    - "Grundlagen" (= Basic informations of a certain 
                      topic)
    - "Programmieren" (= News, Hints and Workshops for 
                         programmers)
    - "Politik"    (= Politics)
    - "Lifestyle"  (= Reviews of new CDs, books, movies, etc.)
    - "Jokes & Stories"

Most articles are written especially for the AmigaGadget, but there are
also a few texts which were taken out of the net - representing some sort
of "Best of the Net".

Issue 23 of the AmigaGadget contains e.g.  an interview with Angela
"Meeting Pearls" Schmidt, an introduction to "Scheme", a lot of record and
movie reviews and the "Mumpitz"-corner which reports the latest news from
the world of the old but not forgotten home-computers. 

FEATURES

  Frodo

VERSION

  2.1

AUTHOR

  Christian Bauer

  EMail: bauec002@goofy.zdv.uni-mainz.de
  SMail: Christian Bauer, Max-Planck-Str.60, 55124 Mainz, Germany

DESCRIPTION

Frodo is a multitasking freeware C64 emulator for the Amiga.

This emulator focuses on the exact reproduction of special graphical
effects possible on the 64, and has therefore relatively high system
requirements.  Using a 68060-50 and a CyberVision card gives about 140-160%
of the original C64 speed in standard text mode in the emulation's most
precise mode and about 700% in its fastest mode.

Using a line-based VIC model, Frodo is capable of running most games and
demos correctly, even those with FLI, FLD, DYCP, open top/bottom borders,
multiplexed sprites etc.  A single-cycle version of the emulator, "Frodo
SC", is included that runs even those programs that fail on the line-based
emulation.

A graphics card (any one whose modes are selectable with a screenmode
requester will do) is strongly recommended for faster display as the
emulator's routines have been designed for a chunky display memory.

Some small demo programs and the full source code in C and assembly
language are included in the archive.

Changes from V2.0:
 - The C64 character ROM is now included in the archive
 - Fixed write errors in 1541 "Dir" mode
 - 1 bit Amiga mode fixed
 - SID type gadget is localized
 - Reset6526 stops timer B counting underflows of timer A
 - Sprite display can be turned off
 - Corrected VIC interrupt handling, raster interrupts can be triggered by
   writing to $d01a
 - CIA interrupts cannot be cleared by writing to the ICR
 - Better CIA 1 PRA/PRB emulation (keyboard/joysticks)
 - Corrected SAM CIA timer output mode display
 - SAM can be invoked from the "Illegal Opcode" requester
 - 6510 registers can be modified from within SAM
 - The file name for the "o" command in SAM must now be surrounded with
   quotation marks (")
 - Added load and save commands to SAM
 - Frodo SC: SAM "vv" command works
 - Frodo SC: Implemented 3-cycle-delay when starting timers
 - Frodo SC: LPY register reported wrong values
 - Frodo SC: Implemented simple sprite display (no collisions, no
   priorities, sprites are drawn over the border)
 - Frodo SC: Corrected display of background color in left/right border

CyberShow Professional

VERSION

6.0

AUTHOR

Helmut Hoffmann
Rubensstrasse 4
41063 Moenchengladbach
Germany

EMail: hhoff@pool.informatik.rwth-aachen.de

DESCRIPTION

A slideshow presentation program (including transition effects) and
universal picture viewer (incl.  PhotoCD support) and converter for all
Amigas (and Draco) and esp.  for CyberGraphX users (also usable without
CyberGraphX).

This program can display pictures in many file formats (see below) directly
in windows on the Workbench (default public screen), in windows on public
screens or on it's own screen.  It also offers (borderless) viewing as
slideshow.  Optional transition effects can be used to make viewing
multiple files more interesting.  You can even zoom into pictures to
magnify parts or zoom out to get even large pictures fully on screen very
quickly.  An automatic presentation mode (configurable delay time) incl.
optional loop mode is also implemented.

If you have a suitable graphic board with CyberGraphX WB emulation
installed you can even watch the pictures in full color quality
(HiColor/TrueColor) on your Workbench.  Without CyberGraphX the normal
color restrictions (2 to 256 colors) will lead to a reduced quality, but
smart pen allocation during displaying will still give surprisingly high
quality with 256 colors.

You can switch forward and backward between images and scroll images in
their resizable windows.  An automatic preloading feature will reduce
waiting time to a minimum.  While you watch one picture (and maybe scroll
it around), the next picture will already be loaded, so that it will be
there if you decide to switch...  You can select down- scaled loading for
viewing in reduced size.  Unlike many viewers, this viewer reduces most
pictures during loading and will thus be faster for reduced size loading.

Additional features include conversion to some 24Bit formats (incl.  JPeg,
IFF-ILBM24, Targa), fast direct transfer to famous image processing and
painting programs (ImageFX, XiPaint, ArtEffect/PicoPainter) and deleting of
pictures.

Internally supported formats for loading:

1) IFF-ILBM (1 to 24Bit incl. HAM6/HAM8)
2) PhotoCD (Base format 768x512 or 512x768 (portrait))
3) JPeg (color and greyscale)
4) PPM/PGM/PBM (P1&P4 b&w, P5 grey, P6 color)
5) QRT (also known as dump format by PD raytracers as POV-Ray)
6) Targa
7) PCX
8) BMP
9) TIF (packbit-compr./uncompr.)
10) EGS7.x window icons
11) DEEP
12) YUV
13) VLAB raw
14) RGB
15) HHsYUVSq sequence format
16) IFF-PBM (DPII)
17) ACBM
18) FBM
19) Sun raster (uncompressed)
20) MacPaint (b&w compressed 1Bit format; datafork only)
21) HHsXRL formats
22) binary-EPS bitmaps (RGB and CMYK)
23) TBCPlus frames/fields

The additional DataType support extends this list by many formats;
DataTypes can e.g.  be found on Aminet in util/DType.  The DataType support
is very fast, so that you can also view pictures in GIF or other formats
quite fast for which Datatypes exist.

NEW FEATURES

New in V6.0: + BestMode option for automatic selection of suitable screenmode
             + Width and Height options to select screenmode just by size
New in V5.6: + Delete function to get rid of unwanted pictures
             + Immediate scrolling during use of scrollbars
             + Random option to display pictures in random order
             + Extended information requester (e.g. number of pictures)
New in V5.5: + Additional menu functions for settings
New in V5.4: + Automatic "downscaling to screensize" option
New in V5.3: + Extended TIF support for "Intel" byte order formats
             + AppWindow (drop your pictures/drawers/disks into the window)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

OS3.0 or higher required
4MBytes FastRAM recommended

Optional for TrueColor/HighColor viewing:
  cybergraphics.library V40 or higher and a suitable graphic board or
  Draco.
  The CyberGraphX emulation is compatible with many graphic boards
  (e.g. CyberVision, Piccolo, SD64, Spectrum, Picasso2, Retina-Z3,
        Domino and Draco/Altais)

DESCRIPTION

 * New and Improved Formula. Now with WYSIWYG Preview option. *

HTML-Heaven is a suite of _four_ programs intended to make the creation and
maintenance of WWW (HTML) pages easy.  The programs in the suite interface
with your favorite editor (providing it supports text insertion via ARexx)
to provide you with a very comfortable environment.  Now inserting HTML
commands is as simple as point and click.  This is the upgrade from version
1.2 with a host of exciting new features.

NEW FEATURES

Version 1.3 has all the features of version 1.2. Plus:
* AutoView option allows automatic WYSIWYG preview of HTML documents using
  your Amiga WWW browser after each change you make. 
* Support for some more editors, like Write, Final Writer and BEd (Black's
  Editor)
                
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

HTML-Heaven requires:
* Workbench 2.04 or above.
* ARexx (bundled with Workbench 2.04 and above.)
* Around 1MB of free memory.

  and docs.)
* A supported editor.
* A supported WWW browser for use with the AutoView feature.

OTHER

To encourage users to register, (I'd like to get some return for all this
effort I have put into creating the suite.) the freely distributable
versions does not support ToolTypes/parameters and will not supply on-line
help.  Furthermore a 'reminder' requester appears on exiting any of the
four programs comprising the suite.  The unregistered versions will also
not allow more than 5 ARexx commands per session.  They'll keep
functioning, but ignore any further ARexx commands given by the user as it
has unloaded it's ARexx Host.

Macro68, version 3.175

UPDATE NOTICE

Apparently, lots of people have moved without informing The Puzzle Factory
-- when update notices were mailed out recently, many of them were returned
by the post office.  Users of Macro68 who have not received an update
notice and who want to get the updated version should get in touch with The
Puzzle Factory at the address below.

NEW FEATURES

68060 support added.  Many bugs fixed, most of them minor.

DESCRIPTION

Macro68 is an assembler that supports the entire Motorola family including
the MC68060, MC68882/030/040 FPU, and MC68851/030/040 MMU.  Additional
capability includes the Amiga Copper.

The new Motorola syntax for 030 or later CPUs is supported, and Macro68
includes a utility to convert old-style syntax painlessly.  Old syntax is
also supported.

A unique feature of Macro68 is the use of a shared library, which is always
resident, and allows the use of preassembled resident include files for
incredibly fast assemblies.  These may be standard Amiga files, or any
header files may be used.  Additionally, a configuration file may be
defined that will set up a particular environment, or insert specific code
in all assemblies.

Most features limited only by available memory.  Directives include
Structure Offset for compatibility with the Amiga's interface conventions,
and Frame Offset for easy stack frames.  Full listing control and
cross-referencing.  Ability to customize directives and run-time messages.

Macro68 is fully re-entrant, and may be made resident.  An AREXX(tm)
interface provides "real-time" communication with the editor of your
choice.  A number of directives enable Macro68 to communicate with
AmigaDos(tm).  External programs may be invoked on either pass, and the
results interpreted.

Macro68 is compatible with the directives used by most popular assemblers.
Output file formats include executable object, linkable object, binary
image, pre-assembled symbol tables, and Motorola S records.

There's a review of Macro68 v 3.165 on Aminet, for example:

===========================================================================

[Perhaps some of you remember Mr. Tsang from his tongue-in-cheek yet
practical series on having fun with old Bridgeboards.  We're fortunate to
have him back, with a tongue-in-cheek yet practical look at making use of
the Amigas of yesteryear...-Jason]

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
With all the recent introductions of new A1200's and A4000's from
Escom/Amiga Technologies, many people are buying new Amigas, or even older
ones with souped up expansion options.  Maybe you were using an A500 with
one floppy before you got your riproaring A4000T60, or perhaps you were a
pioneer with your Amiga 1000, but have steadily progressed to each new
model revision.  Whatever your current machine, many Amiga users have older
systems now relegated to a closet or sitting unused on a desk somewhere. 

I'm one of those people who hate to see computers wasted, especially
capable ones like the Amiga.  Even when it's as old as a Commodore PET or
Apple II, there's plenty of life still left in most of the personal
computers we've worked with in the last twenty years.  While I don't
actively use a PET or a II, nor do I recommend anyone to buy one at this
stage, there are certainly many uses for them.  Maybe you have an old Amiga
lying around, and will get an idea from this article.

Let's first look at some ideas for old Amigas, then examine where to find
hardware for your used Amiga setup.  No matter what you choose to do, the
first place you should stop is your local Amiga user group.  This is often
the best source of tips, advice and deals that you can find.  Also,
remember to read Comp.sys.amiga.hardware for problem solving and
troubleshooting information and other similar Internet resources.  Finally,
usergroups and libraries often have back issues of old, yet useful,
magazines like AmigaWorld and Transactor for Amiga.

These are just a few ideas I have, but I'm sure there are more!  By the
way, I'm an avid fan of the Secret Life of Machines, so some of the later
suggestions get kinda odd.

Idea 1: Using the Amiga as a Simple Home/First Computer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Believe it or not, home computing often doesn't require a Pentium 75 with
16MB of RAM and a quadspeed CDRom drive.  A lot of simple tasks found in an
average household don't require multimedia features.  For instance, writing
school reports and business correspondence or dialing up to a internet
service provider to check for email from relatives are not Windows95
exclusive tasks.  Wordprocessing and terminal emulation are relatively
simple applications.

This use is well suited towards expanded A500's and A2000's, with 2MB or
more, and a small hard disk.  Some of the latest software, like
FinalWriter, still runs on these machines, albeit slower.  If you have a
non expanded A500, a 1MB system with two floppies is adequate, perhaps for
something less intensive, like an older version of FinalCopy.  I'd say,
unless you have small children, a 1084 or similar RGB 15 Khz monitor is a
must.  Otherwise, you'll be stuck using a TV, which is neither easy to read
nor a friendly option with TV watching siblings.

It's an attractive solution to families with small budgets.  I know that
not many households can afford a $3500 computer but computer literacy is
becoming more and more a must for children.  An older Amiga maybe enough to
bridge that gap temporarily, and put in some basic computing skills like
keyboarding.  Other folks that could benefit, could be younger children and
seniors, who are often new to computers and can easily benefit from the
skills found in even simple applications.

Don't forget your local elementary school-sometimes computers get lost in
the funding shuffle, and donating a low end Amiga could mean a welcome
class room addition-not for playing games, but for example, for grade 1
students to use DeluxePaint to draw pictures, or for grade 4's to write
short stories.  Not everyone needs 24 bit truecolour or CGfonts-the simple
block letters of some early Amiga wordprocessors would work great here, and
the older Star 9pin colour dot matrix printers would be a cheap alternative
to say, expensive colour inkjet supplies.  One word of advice-stay away
from floppies in this situation-a hard disk is a better choice, because
floppies tend to get corrupted in the dusty environment of a school, plus
kids and teachers don't like waiting around for slow drives.

This is NOT an alternative to a PC if you're aiming to run incredible
multimedia software like Encarta, unfortunately, the Amiga hasn't
progressed to that point.  But again, for simple tasks, that's not a
problem. 

Idea 2: Using the Amiga as a Basic Video CG / SEG / Edit Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Many school boards want to integrate video into school curriculums, but
have no idea to do it.  When it's done right, it can really enhance the
educational process.  I've seen examples of video use from rapping teachers
to in house television studios.  Schools often spend lots of money on
expensive equipment, on some sort of contract buy for the entire board. 
They get mediocre hardware with little idea on how to use it.  Why not put
an Amiga to work in a journalism classroom, or as an after school video
club?  Not just a geeky AV Squad, but a hip, cool, radical activity for
people interested in making television, be it rock videos, interviews,
documentaries or strange art films.

A good choice would be an A2000, with hard disk, and a genlock.  The
benefit of the A2000 is that it has a large industrial style case, which
can either fit in a rackmount edit bay, or be easily mounted onto a rolling
cabinet-it can take a pounding.  Stuff goes inside, where it isn't easily
stolen.  A major attraction of this machine is the video slot, which can
handle a cheap little genlock like a Commodore A2300, or a full fledged
switcher/SEG like Toaster.  Who cares about broadcast quality?  An A2300 is
adequate for VHS and SVHS output, and there are similar boards/external
modules like it.  A setup like this is more flexible and of a higher
quality than say, one of those trashy Videonics products.  Wire this system
to the school edit suite and you're "Doing Video Just Like the Pros".
Remember that video is kind of fuzzy anyways at VHS/SVHS level, so top
resolution and colour depth isn't that big a deal.

Software-wise, a paint program can get you started, but you should check
out the discount bin at your local Amiga dealer-perhaps an old copy of
DeluxeVideo, or some titler software.  It doesn't have to be state of the
art.  Go online and download a pile of fonts, and away you go!  You see,
video (and everything else creative) isn't held back by the tools, but how
much imagination you have.  You can do wonders with just a genlock- you
don't need digital nonlinear or even a switcher.  3D work isn't that far
away either, but you'll absolutely need an accelerator board.  Again, the
A2000 can house cheap accelerators, like the A2620 Commodore 14 Mhz 020
with 4MBytes RAM.  If you want to splurge, you could go for a GVP GForce or
even an 040/060 later.  Output of 3D animation is difficult, but you could
use 3D stills for CG backgrounds, or alternatively, try using a DCTV or
similar device to get 15-20 fps anims out to tape.

Other effects outside of simple CG can be achieved using used Amiga video
peripherals.  A chromakey from yesteryear, or perhaps a framegrabber can
add odd and amusing elements to videos.  Don't forget editing
controllers-old Gold Disk VideoDirectors were sold in Toronto for $25. 
This was a LANCS Sony Control L and IR control cable with some simple edit
software which worked on a basic EDL setup.  You cataloged your tapes with
the LANCS control going into your 8mm Camcorder, and then set up for
assemble edits via the IR control cable pointed at your VCR for recording.

Idea 3: Using the Amiga as a Slide Projector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sure, some might convince you that you need Macromind Director or even
Scala MM300, but even the smallest Amiga can be used as a slide projector!
This can be used for doing school presentations where you attach the Amiga
to a large colour TV or videoprojector.  Any Amiga can be used to do this,
even an A500 with a single floppy.  You'll need a Commodore 520 or similar
composite adapter to hook up, but some Amigas already have the hardware-an
A600 or A1000 have built in composite colour out.

Simply prepare some slides using a paint program, restricting yourself to
NTSC mode non interlace modes, and copy them into a "Boot and show" disk. 
This floppy should include a simple script to show all the images on boot,
pausing for a keypress or mouseclick.  When you do your talk or
presentation, just click or press for each slide, instead of fussing with
overhead transparencies.  It may take a while to load each frame, so you'll
want to experiment with using a RAM disk or hard disk to buffer frames. 
You could also get creative and set yourself up for paging forward and
backwards.  One negative aspect is that you can't write on the screen the
way you can with transparencies. 

Animations and other visual elements could be used in
educational/instructional settings too. 

This idea can be extended further into presentation or electronic signpost
systems.  For instance, say your community center has an old closed circuit
TV system.  Don't laugh, I've seen this before-someone writes messages up
on scraps of paper, and puts them under a camera, which is displayed around
the building.  Why not put an Amiga there?  You could use an A500 to
display upcoming events, maps, and logos.  That's all done via a paint
program like DeluxePaint and a "show" script.  You can get more complex, by
adding an onscreen clock, scheduling, showing digitized photos, etc.

I recently saw a university system which used a pair of A4000's for
something much like this.  Their setup cost $60,000, and used 25 colour TVs
and an SVHS edit suite, but with some used televisions and spare wiring,
you can setup a simple system much like it.

Idea 4: Bring Your Amiga to a Rave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Okay, truthfully, I have never been to a rave, and promise myself not to do
such a thing, so I can't say I know too much about this subject.  However,
you could try using the Amiga as a sound generator and hook it up to a
spare input on the production mixer.  Play around with samples, MODs, live
distortion effects etc. 

A while ago, I brought a pair of Amigas to a high school dance and wired up
to a LCD colour projector through a cheap genlock.  My friend and I ran
animations, copperdemos, textures and all sorts of visual imagery projected
onto a 40 ft wide white wall through the crowd.  We even at one point
accidentally opened a Workbench screen, and typed stuff in open Shell
windows.  We wired my A3000 and my A600 to the inputs on the projector. 
The A600 was configured to show background animations, which could run
while we were drawing up new images on the A3000 for display.  We also used
a VHS VCR and played back old commercials and cartoons, both direct and
through the genlock.  So, while I'm sure some rave productions are quite
professional, there's always room to try out something at a high school or
college pub or dance, provided you don't look too stupid or nerdy and
refuse to answer the question "Is that Windows95?"

As a side note, a lot of Amiga users are artists and they produce fine work
on a variety of media, from print output to video animations.  Some even
combine Amiga output with traditional art tools or produce their pieces on
large sized murals.  However, you can also use the Amiga in installation
art and the like, putting the system directly into the display. 

Idea 5: The Amiga as a Sample Player
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
School plays and college productions often use sounds to enhance a scene. 
Traditionally, they played it off of tape or CD, cued by the sound board
operator.  Recently, I saw a production using a Macintosh Classic II to
play back sound cues.  The fellow who set it up did a really good job-he
even wrote a HyperCard application which arranged sounds by scene, and had
the lines/text surrounding the actual sound cue.  When the proper time
came, the sound operator just clicked on an onscreen gadget/button to set
off the sound.  No screwups, flubs, mistakes, etc. 

An Amiga can do this job too, and may even do it better in some ways.  For
one, Amigas have good sample editors and multimedia sequencer programs, so
you don't have to learn HyperCard.  Second, we have DMA bandwidth, so we
don't get bogged down loading samples direct from hard disk.  Sure wish we
had CD quality output though.

Idea 6: Using the Amiga to Control the World!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Amiga applications don't stop at video and sound.  You can also interface
the machine to a variety of different devices to control your home, office
or even...the WORLD!  Mwahahaahah!  The X10 System, a collection of modules
for turning on and off appliances via radio and AC waves, had some
shareware Amiga software, and there are similar devices both in shareware
kit form and commercially.  You could use an A500 set up on your TV to save
energy by starting up lighting and powering down devices at preset times. 

If you're really technically oriented, you can try using the Amiga as a
robotics controller.  Building small robots to be controlled via a
colourful Amiga screen would be great fun for small children, and you can
integrate them into school projects as well.  There's lots of information
about Lego robots and simple robot controllers on the Internet, around
MIT's Miniboard design.  This can be used with the Amiga via a serial
cable.

The Amiga can integrated into realworld hardware for measuring and sensing
things.  With electronics design experience, you could build exhibits for
science museums and the like.  For example, you could build a temperature
sensor and with approrpriate electronics, feed the data into an Amiga to
show on a visually attractive or interactive display.  It's cheaper than
using a Mac or PC with expensive video output boards, especially when you
need to use a video projector or wide television.

Idea 7: An Amiga Fax Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Instead of controlling the world, you can SAVE the planet, by using an
Amiga with a fax modem as a fax server, receiving inbound faxes and storing
them to floppy.  Then, when you come home, power up the monitor, and delete
junk faxes, printing or saving only the important ones, instead of having a
pile of unrecyclable fax paper trailing out of your normal fax machine. 
Amigas can be used as voicemail systems and outbound fax services, which
means you can CONFUSE the planet too.  Wouldn't it be cool to have people
call up your home, even if it's a bachelor's apartment, and get voicemail
boxes for you and your dog?

Hardware
~~~~~~~~
Hardware will always define what kind of applications you can run, because
software always drives the development of new processors and technologies.
To begin, examine what original model of the Amiga you have.  If it's an
A3000 or A2500, that's adequate to handle most current Amiga software!  You
should be USING this machine primarily!  :) However, if it's an A500, 1000,
or 2000, you'll probably want to look at adding some more hardware to it to
enhance your options.  Used hardware is easily found at user group swap
meets, local Amiga dealers, and through private individuals.  You can find
out about these through local Amiga BBSes, and user groups.  Actually, a
user group should often be the first stop for learning about old Amigas and
their uses: almost every user group has someone who loves to tinker.

Be careful not to pay too much, because this isn't your primary system.
Sometimes people post prices that are too high, and it's customary to
bargain down, unless they've noted they are firm.  Don't bother them then
with requests for lower prices, and in general, don't pester people with
stupid offers like $5 for a A2000 or whatever.

Floppies.

A second floppy drive, for single floppy systems, is certainly a must if
you're not going with a hard disk.  Single floppies like the A1010/1011 or
the multitude of clone external floppies are cheap and easy to find.
Expect to pay $10-50 for one.  However, a better alternative is to go
directly for a hard disk, it'll save you frustation and agony, and let you
run a lot of newer software.

Hard Disks.

Hard disks used to be really expensive for the Amiga, but now are really
cheap, because subsequent models integrated the controller onto the
motherboard.  For an A500, a hard disk consists of the controller and a
"shoebox" which slips on the side of the machine.  These often include
extra RAM and an external SCSI port for chaining more disks outside.  An
A2000 hard disk solution is much cheaper, where you can get an old A2090 or
A2091 board for $50 or less (sometimes A2090 owners even PAY YOU to take
the thing away!  :) You couple this with a small SCSI disk like a 20MB
Miniscribe or 40MB Quantum, or perhaps a ST506 like a Rodime 40 or Seagate.
Hard disks make the Amiga much more usable, and they're preferred for large
applications or situations where waiting is unacceptable.

RAM.

Amigas really like more memory, and expanding them isn't too hard.  A500's
can be upgrade to a full megabyte via their A501 trapdoor, and anyone
considering using an A500 should automatically do this.  A501's and their
clones are cheap and plentiful.  A quick way to kill two birds with one
stone is to get a shoebox expander like a GVP Impact A500 or SupraDrive
500XP.  16bit RAM boards for the A2000 are similarily inexpensive, and you
can often find old RAM for it, making population of the board easy (and
often free).  I like the SupraRAM 2000, for five years, it's never failed
me.  However, there's always the Commodore 2052/2058 boards, and you can
always put 2MB on the A2091 hard disk controller, which has ran nicely on
my A2000 too.

Monitors.

Monitors are difficult to find for the Amiga.  In your application, you may
just want a TV, say, if you're using it for a slideshow.  However, if
you're using it in a video suite, or at home, a good monitor is a must. 
The older Commodore 15 Khz monitors, like the A1084S, C2002, and 1080 are
great, and don't cost a lot.  Hooking up SVGAs and the like is hard, you'll
need a flickerfixer, which is pretty expensive.

In presentation situations, you can also use higher quality inputs for your
Amiga.  I have my CDTV, which has a special SVHS output, connected to our
Sony TV, which has SVHS in, and the picture is fantastic!  Older,
expensive, models of Sony's Trinitron line, and their professional monitor
range, have RGB inputs and you can build a special cable for them.

[Much has been made of Toshiba's TIMM, a 20" monitor/TV that does 15-40khz,
in other words, the entire Amiga range.  Perhaps a review will be
forthcoming... -Jason]

Printers.

Printers aren't hard to find, and most models work easily with the Amiga,
since we have pretty decent official and public domain driver support.  Aim
to get a parallel port printer, which simplifies connection.  School kids
can try a colour dotmatrix, while a low end inkjet is quite nice for home
use.  You'll want an inkjet for reports, seeing dotmatrix print is pretty
tacky these days, but they're not at all expensive.  You can even find new
ones at bargain basement discount from large electronics superstore chains.
One model I always see being sold at ridiculously low prices is the Canon
Bubblejet BJ5 or 10ex model.  And remember that you can always bring this
to a new PC, so your investment of $150 isn't lost on just an Amiga.  No
one can tell if you used FinalWriter on a 68000 3MB A2000, or MSWord 16 MB
Pentium 133-the output is the same.

Other Neat Stuff.

There's always some wacky devices and software made for the Amiga and you
can often find them in discount bins or at user group swap meets.  Who
can't resist an old Sunrize PerfectVision framegrabber?  Or a DigiView
slowscan digitizer?  An Easyl drawing pad?  An Okidata Okimate 20 colour
thermal printer?  A trackball?  You can find cool uses for these, like
say...a "take a picture of you and alter the colours of the image" kiosk,
for instance, or added fun to an old Marble Madness game.

  Adam Hough                                            adamh@spots.ab.ca
===========================================================================

This is not really connected to this area, but...

This little tirade is based on my recent job hunting experiences in both
Ottawa and Calgary, considered to be the best places to search for IT
related jobs in Canada.

For years, the computer industry has been crying out for computer
knowledgeable university graduates.  So they got them.  Then they felt that
what they really needed was to have computer people who could communicate
effectively and efficiently.

So, with this knowledge in hand, I've pursued that particular profile.

And what's the result?  "We want three to five years experience."; "Do you
know IEF/ABF/SNA/ADS/SYBASE"; and so on.  And that's if you get as far as
an interview or an open house.  Most of the time, the closest you get is a
"Dear John" reply to your resume, seemingly from the same source as all
those office faxes since the wording remains identical no matter what the
source -- "We currently have no openings for your skills at this moment.
We will keep your resume on file for 6 months..."

What I'm really getting at is questioning how the computer industry expects
to recruit the next generation of professionals if it's not willing to
either train them or, heck, even give them a chance.  No institutions I've
seen handle anything more sophisticated than programming languages and
assorted theory -- definitely nothing like Cognicase or the other million
pieces of slightly obscure mainframe related software.

Much as I would like to be able to say I know this, that and the other, I
cannot afford to buy every single package out there and learn it -- and
even that does count.  One company I went to an open house to recently only
wanted to see knowledge gained through work, academic and personal
experience wasn't admissible; that resulted in a fairly empty sheet of
paper.

Is it TRUE that the only jobs out there are for people who happen to know
those in the know?  Is the computer industry needlessly rejecting thousands
of capable people they need because they are not willing to take on the
cost of letting them learn on the job?  What makes it so ironic is that
while at one open house, I talked to a team leader talking about a project
that he'd just completed.  That job required a substantial amount of work
to be done in Visual Basic -- in his words his team "couldn't even spell
Visual when they started on the project".  So wherein lies the difference
other than those people are already employed?  Is the IT industry being too
fussy and leaving jobs unfilled or is there a huge pool of people who just
happen to have that few years of experience in hand that makes them
employable?

In the meanwhile I'm sitting on a collection of useful and relevant skills
that are slowly becoming less valuable as new software is introduced and as
I become more rusty while looking around for a chance to hone them.  I'm
not trying to set my sights too high by being unreasonable in job
expectations or salary; I'm not unemployable through being socially
incompetent or indeed any of the other shortcomings of many other
technically skilled computer people.  So why the problem?  I wish I knew.

Thoughts, people?

@node REVIEW1 "MetaTool 40.4"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                           Review: MetaTool 40.4
  Roberto Agria                                         flash@pn.itnet.it
===========================================================================

These days most Amiga people have access to the Net, giving everybody a
vital opportunity to talk to each other (if they know the E-Mail address!),
and widely available e-mail is probably one of the main reasons the Amiga
was able to survive two years in the wilderness. 

There are now several mail programs available, most of them Shareware but
openly available on Aminet, including Elm, Thor, Voodoo (now included in
the AmigaSurfer pack) and MetaTool, which is freeware.  Of course, it's
also possible to write a message with any Text editor and then invoke the
appropriate sendmail-like program to send the mail to the destination
address.  However, unless you are a Net-expert or at least, a
Dos&parameters expert (and for the sake of your sanity) you choose a mail
program, that will do everything automagically (more or less). 

I will not write here about programs other than Metatool, because I don't
know their capabilities well, and because after I took a look at their
Gui's, I'm no longer interested in those programs.  Let's come to MetaTool
then !

Most of you know (I suppose) what the Mime format is.  But I'll explain for
those of you who don't know !  Standard e-mail can only send plain ASCII
characters because the mail gateways only handle 7-bit data, and also have
a fixed line length (usually around 70 characters).  The Mime format
(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) gets around this by encoding 8-bit
data into a 7-bit representation.  This is just like uuencoding then?
Well, not quite because Mime also wraps the data with a header to identify
the type of data in the message so enabling the receipient's software to
display it in an appropriate form.  Mime also allows multipart messages
containing lots of different pieces of data to be sent and supports
splitting and merging of huge messages to allow them to be sent over
networks which limit the size of individual messages. 

As you guess, MetaTool is able to use the Mime format, and obviously the
normal plain-text mail format (rfc 822).

MetaTool's Gui is easy to understand and to use: the main window is the
Mailboxes window, where you choose a mailbox file to open from a list of
several MetaTool knows about.  You can also select a mailbox file created
by other programs and show them.  In fact, in the settings window, there's
a parameter called Message Boundary, that can be set to Compatible or
Custom.  In Compatible mode, i've been able to open Mailfiles created by
Elm with no problems.  I don't know about files created by Thor or Voodoo
(I suppose there will not be problem with those files also). 

When you choose a Mailbox, another window will popup with the list of
messages, their dates, the name of who sent it to you, the title of the
mex, and it's size in Kbytes.  Multiple mailbox windows can be open at the
same time and messages can be transferred between them.

Double-clicking on a message opens a Display window which shows the
message's parts, the header, that contains information on the writer
address, the destination address and other stuff, and the Mime type of the
part.  MetaTool uses a mailcap file (of the same format as Mosaic and the
metamail Mime package) to choose an appropriate viewer for the parts.

Examples:

audio/x-voc; play16 %s;label="A VOC Sample" (to listen audio samples)
image/jpeg; CyberView %s (should i explain ? ;-> )
video/x-anim; xanim %s; label="An IFF ANIM Animation"; edit=3D"DPaint"
application/x-lzx; Copy %s DOWNLOADS: ; label="An lzx Archive"

Choosing Reply or New, brings up the Compose window.  MetaTool has a
built-in Address Book that can contain the names of people that you write
often to (there's a menu option to automatically add addresses from
currently viewed or selected messages), you can use this to quickly fill in
the To: , CC: (carbon copy) and BCC: (blind carbon copy) addresses, or fill
them in by hand (Reply fills in the To: address for you). 

Adding the message contents is where the fun starts!  Any type of file can
be added to the message either by choosing it from a file requester or
dragging it's icon onto the Compose window; MetaTool automatically detects
the type of the data in the part using a combination of datatypes and the
file extension, and sets the Mime type for you (you can also do this by
hand if you so wish).  New text parts can also be added and edited, and
MetaTool will include and quote text parts in a reply and append a
signature (which could be a picture :*)) if enabled.

MetaTool uses Mui, a well known programmers tool, that give MetaTool a nice
Graphics Interface.  The nice Gui, added to the easy of use, makes of
MetaTool a powerful tool between Mailing Programs. 

You can find MetaTool version 40.4 on Aminet, under
comm/mail/MetaTool.lha. The author, Ellis Protchard, is reachable at
this address: efp90@nuke.dircon.co.uk (home) or
ellis@cam-ani.co.uk (work).

                          Review: XTReme Racing
  Ralph Debusmann                                     rade@coli.uni-sb.de
===========================================================================

For a quite desperate Amiga user like I am it's nice to see there are still
some signs of action in the Amiga market - even when it comes to games.
Recently, we have been delighted with quality-games like Worms, AB3D from
Team17 and Gloom (Deluxe) by Black Magic.  And even though all major
companies have left the Amiga (even Team17 doesn't seem to further support
our beloved machine) I am still not forced to buy a PC-clone.

My faith in Amiga games has also been replenished by XTreme Racing (XTR)
from Silltunna Software (distributed by Black Magic), the best clone of the
SNES-game "Super Mario Kart" I can think of.

As I said the idea behind XTR is neither new nor too original - it's the
old story of racing around several different racing venues and be the first
after a couple of laps.  Of course there are lots of weapons, turbos and
alike scattered about the track to add more variety to the gameplay.  So
what's giving XTR it's distinctive quality over games like ATR (great one
from Team17) or RoadKill I hear you ask?

It's the graphics and the new feeling which those graphics put into the
game.  This is the first Amiga racing game with fast, fully textured
3D-graphics.  And those graphics really are fast and look quite cool.  On
my standard-A4000/030 (EC030, 25MHz) I get a fluid 2*1 full screen
resolution.  With a 50Mhz 030 you can easily get 1*1 full screen.  And for
people with non-accelerated A1200s (that's the minimum requirement hence
XTR is AGA only) the game can be adjusted to run in 2*2 three fourth screen
or so and still is big fun.  You can even choose between a Blittermode and
the (better) Chunky-2-Planar-conversion and it is possible to put cameras
anywhere on the track.

But not only the graphics are great - head programmer Alex Amsel said on
IRC that he has spent most of the development time on gameplay issues - a
fact which you are soon forced to believe.  It just plays good and is fun
from the beginning on.

XTR provides you with four different modes, ranging from "Single Race",
over "Cup" and "Season" to the (2+ player only) "Death Match"-mode.

In "Single Race" you can choose any of the 12 tracks and practice it
against a modifyable number of concurrent cars.  These cars can be entirely
controlled by the Amiga but - theoretically - it is also possible to play
against 7 human controlled cars (!).  4 players can share the same (split-)
screen and XTR additionally gives you the opportunity to connect to another
Amiga via Null-Modem-cable or via a real Modem.  Unfortunately I haven't
tested the (Null-) Modem-option yet so that I can't give any statements on
this.

In "Cup"-mode you attempt to finish three distinctive tracks in the top
three (of eight cars).  Like in "Single Race" and all other modes it is
crucial for you to learn the track and know exactly where you are going. 
It is for example crucial to use as many of the "Turbo-pads" as possible. 
These let you run quite fast for a short amount of time.  It is a must to
learn the tracks because XTR doesn't seem know the word "mercy" at all.  If
you've hit one of the couple of barrels on track (which let you turn around
- mostly you then look in the wrong direction) or if you've fallen off
track into some ugly liquid or into space - only one "error" can be fatal.
XTR's computer controlled cars won't hesitate to overtake you and be far
ahead soon.  This is one mayor gripe I have about the game - it's too hard.
I for myself take this as a challenge but not too experienced players will
surely find this very annoying.

The third mode "Season" confronts you with all 12 tracks in a row.  Here
you need to collect points to be the first after you've gone through all
the tracks and money to improve your car - and it is crucial to improve
your car because the default "Season"-car is much slower and less
maneuverable than the "Single Race" or the "Cup"-car.  In "Season" you need
the first 4 races just to improve the car while finishing 7th or 8th.  Then
again, after you actually have improved the car over the computer
controlled cars the game becomes a bit too easy.  Alex should have a look
on this mode again IMHO because it doesn't seem to be as well thought out
as the rest of the game.

The fourth mode ("Death Match") also is the mode which is the most fun. 
Here you race around a track (no fixed course) not to finish it but to kill
your up to 7 (human) opponents.  The "killing" is done either by kicking a
car into water or by shooting it with any of the possible weapons.  These
range from a simple missile over homing missiles, mines, bombs to sheep
(!).  Weapons are collected by running over a questionmark and then waiting
what cute weapon the random generator gives you.  Of course (nearly) all
these weapons are available in all other modes either (e.g.  you can shoot
an opponent with a missile when he reaches the finish-line in "Single
Race").  The "Death Match" is over when one player has accomplished a
distinctive number of kills.  Besides I should mention that the "cracked"
version of XTR lacks this mode - sorry, bad luck Pirates :)

Honest purchasers will get a really nice game.  I liked it from the minute
on I got the demo from Aminet.  I like the speedy and good looking
3D-graphics, the good playability, the wide range of weapons and the
variety of modes.  I also like the huge amount of options as well as the
possibility to play against up to 7 opponents via Modem.  The sound is
fairly good as well, although the ingame-musics are pretty poor (you can
turn them off luckily).  It should be noted that XTR also is quite
system-friendly in that it quits without touching the Workbench and is
easily HD-installable.  Furthermore there is NO copy-protection at all. 
What a breeze after having quite much trouble with the latest Team17
"black-on-black" protection schemes.

What I don't like about XTR is it's extreme difficulty level (hence the
name).  I dislike that you have to learn the courses so very very well to
be able beat the computer.  I also think that the "Season"-mode should be
looked upon again by the programmer.  The "Death-Match"-mode has potential
to get better either, although it already is big fun in this stage.  My
last gripe is that although XTR lets you choose from 8 different looking
cars the cars don't bear unique qualities like e.g.  in Super Mario Kart -
they seem to behave all the same.

I give XTR a rating 4 out of 5 stars, the fifth star could be achieved by
working a bit on several details and by decreasing the difficulty level.

I've sent Alex a list of suggestions and I hope he'll incorporate a few of
them in future versions of XTR.  In comp.sys.amiga.games Alex has recently
promised to lower the difficulty level, to bring out new tracks and publish
a full-blown Track editor.  So please support him by buying XTR if you like
it.

You can get a demo of XTR on Aminet in game/demo/xtrndemo.lha.  Also
available on Aminet is a Laptime-viewer and a FAQ.  Again, if you like the
game, please purchase a copy (directly from Silltunna would be the best
way).  I got my copy from Silltunna one week after I had sent them the
money from Germany :)

                               Review: Worms
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Wayyy back, it must have been a year now, Team17 sent me a preview package
with some preliminary press releases and screen shots for upcoming titles.
Of the 3 or 4 in there, only one came to fruition, and it contained screen
shots labeled "Total Wormage", a cute pun on .  It was these little things
shooting at each other, as far as I could tell.

Now, as the Team17 hype puts it, "The Worms have turned."  Worms, perhaps
the best thing to happen to the old artillery game, is out.

The Artillery game dates back a loooong time.  My first run in with it was
on the Apple II, where friends and I would hold Artillery tournaments in
programming class.  (I was a second-rate programmer but a first-rate
Artillery player.) Two castles were set up on a random landscape, and by
setting angle and direction against a random wind, they took potshots at
each other.

Worms turbocharges this concept.  A team of four little pink (well, they're
usually pink) worms fight against 1, 2, or 3 other teams of worms on a
randomly generated landscape, with an impressive battery of weapons
ranging from the default bazooka to Uzis, homing missiles, mines, and even
exploding sheep.  Each worm has a set number of "hit points", and each
weapon does varying damage.  The goal is to either damage the enemy worms
so they all die, or to blast them off the screen or into the water, both of
which mean instant death.  The landscape is fairly large and scrolled about
using the mouse, so that's not always so easy to do, particularly when the
enemy gets "entrenched."

You see, Team17 introduced Artillery to Lemmings, so in addition to the
tons of weapons, you get a big toolkit, including a drill, blowtorch, and
"ninja rope", which can be used to hurl your worm around the screen, either
into a strategically superior position or off the screen, into a pile of
mines, etc., depending on the skill of the operator.  In addition, random
airdrops of new weapons fall from the sky, and are the property of
whichever team gets to them first.  These include extra issues of the
rationed weaponry (Dynamite, Cluster Bombs, Air Strikes) and enhanced
versions of certain weapons (The absolutely nasty Banana Bomb, the rather
silly and aforementioned Exploding Sheep, and the reportedly
unintentionally underpowered but still impressive-sounding Minigun)

As previously mentioned, the playfield is a large scrolling world.  By
default, the game will randomly generate a landscape of one of several
different types (Forest, jungle, alien, mars, Hell, etc.) with a long
numerical code which can be recorded for future use.  Some of the levels
are interesting, some treacherous, some bland, and some so sparse the game
will reject it and create a new one.  In addition to the (reportedly) >4
billion possibilities, Team17 provides the specifications to create an IFF
file to be used as the playfield.  This has spawned a sizable trade in
Worms worlds (the best so far, incidentally, is a city scape complete with
subway tunnel and office building.  Highly recommended.)

One of the really memorable elements of Worms is the Worms' commentary,
complaints, cries of pain, etc.  The high-pitched (because they're small
worms, get it?) Wormspeak can be altered (In case you've heard "Oy,
nutter!" or "I'll get you!" too many times) by replacing Team17's samples
with your own.  Because the game loads all of the samples into chip ram and
keeps them there, however, you have to budget your samples carefully.

Control of the game is handled with keyboard (for moving your worms,
aiming, and firing) and mouse (for scrolling the view and setting targets,
such as for the Homing Missile and devastating Air Strike).  The controls
are basically as straightforward as they can be.

As mentioned, up to 4 teams can play, so theoretically 16 of your friends
can gather 'round the 1084 or 1950 or 1438, etc. for a round or two of
Worms.  However, controlling one Worm could be disappointing as the
turn-based system (Worm from one team goes, worm from the next team goes,
worm from the next team, etc. etc.) means it's quite possible your worm
will be dead by the time you get to your turn.  If you don't have any
friends handy, the computer will be happy to square off against you, and 10
levels of computer opponents are provided, from the stupid (The team of
Lemmings) to the absolutely impossibly deadeye (British royalty).  While I
find that a good round of 4-team Worms against the 3 highest levels of
computer opponent can be a lot of fun, the computer team AI has a few
flaws.  It is possible for one of their Worms to get stuck in place, and
while HRH (the royalty team) has good enough aim to calculate a bazooka
shot that will actually travel over a hill, then be taken by the wind and
head down a tunnel to hit its target, none of the teams are clever enough
to use the Ninja Rope or Teleport.  But I guess you can't have everything,
and if you want that level of strategy you'll need to go out and find it.

Simply put, the game is a ton of fun.  I'm always skeptical of wildly
popular things (I am still an Amiga user, after all), but a few rounds of
the Worms demo and I was sold.  Having the configurability of the game be
so flexible (you can forbid the use of certain weapons or limit their use,
if you find as I do that, for example, Dynamite is too devastating of a
weapon to just give away at the outset) is a major plus, although I did
find that the game didn't take your configuration into as much
consideration as I'd hoped.  If you make the use of an item that is by
default limited available infinitely, it will still show up in airdrops.
(For instance, I think cluster bombs should be available without end.  But
the airdrops will provide me with even more.  Kinda pointless.)

(On the subject of "pointless", Worms features the incredibly evil "Black
type on black paper" document protection.  My cries of agony over the past
year on this subject have still gone unheard by Team17.  It remains a very
overdone and nasty solution to the piracy problem.  Yes, I'd rather they
made it tough to read than banged away at the floppy drive, but not by
much.  Legible type, please.)

But Worms is a real blast to play with friends.  It has a very comic (and
comical) quality that makes the ridiculousness of militant worms that much
more appealing.  The play options are just about limitless, and the
potential for a full-blown Worms tournament at my next party is growing.
Worms will even track league scores for you, total kills, and award "Worm
of the Match" honors.

Yes, Worms really deserves to have sold as many copies as it has.  It is
being ported into basically every conceivable game format (even Gameboy.
I've gotta see that one) now that Team17 has distribution through Ocean. 
Despite its apparent omnipresence in the UK on the Amiga and PC, a random
test of a few game shops in the US confirmed my suspicion that Ocean US
hadn't exactly been hyping the PC version to stores.  However, wherever you
are as an Amiga user, you should seriously consider picking the Worms demo
up for yourself (available from Team17's FTP site on ftp.team17.com or
through Aminet) and seeing if amusing mass destruction is for you.  It's
good stuff.

Even if you're not totally sold on Worms as it stands, or if you're a
player hoping for more, fear not.  Team17 is working on a Worms Plus
upgrade, slated to be UKP10, and featuring AGA color support, more flexible
sample loading (as it stands, you need 2 megs of chip ram to hear the good
samples.  1 meg machines get diminished quality and selection), and a host
of other goodies, including some sort of networking.  (The pressure is on
to support TCP/IP).

Worms ships on three floppies, is hard drive installable, and will run on
basically any Amiga which can switch to PAL.  However, 2 megs of chip RAM
are highly recommended.

                           Review: XTReme Racing
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

For a while this autumn, it seemed racing games were all the rage.  First
came Virtual Karting from OTM and published by Guildhall, which was tepidly
reviewed in AR recently.  Then came XTReme Racing, from Silltunna and
published by Guildhall (I see a pattern here...).

XTR's tradition goes back to Pole Position.  You race a car over various
tracks, with a camera view that defaults to just behind your vehicle.
There are a number of other cars on the track and, of course, you want to
beat them.

The camera angle and horizon can be altered at will.  Ok, so now we've
moved to Virtual Karting status.  Now it's time to talk about the stuff
that's much better than any racing game I've seen on the Amiga so far.

If you're a masochist, you can use a nasty black dithered screen with which
to view the road.  This is aimed at un- or minimally-expanded A1200 users.
(However, the masochist comment still applies.)  Thankfully, you can also
adjust pixel width and height (1x1, 2x1, 1x2, 2x2) and turn that godawful
dithering OFF.  Yes, real, honest 1x1 full screen display is possible.
Tack on the capability to add different camera views (either for more
players than just yourself, or to track a different car or area), and
you're talking about something significantly improved from Virtual Karting,
and which doesn't bear much resemblance at all to Pole Position.

The XTR courses also offer some very unconventional (and unrealistic, but
hey, this is a game) features, such as random power-ups (including
missiles!), turbo acceleration pads, and people and Lemming-like creatures
to run over.  You can also drive on such courses as floating cities,
meaning that plummeting to your doom is a very real possibility.
Fortunately, your car reappears shortly after any demises you may incur,
but this tends to set your chances of winning the race pretty much out of
the question.

You have your choice of several different "characters" with different cars
to drive (shades of Power Drift here), and can race in a cup, league, or
single events.  There are also three levels of difficulty, but...

...man, is this game hard.  I mean, it's not impossible, but you'll need
some serious learning time to get the hang of driving an XTR car.  Since
the best pre-race idea you can get of the track is a very simplistic look
at its layout (No Virtual Karting helicopter flyby or Roadkill practice
lap), you may want to race, say, with minimal computer competition on a
track a few times before competing for real, because the tracks can be
confusing and treacherous.

The levels themselves range from fairly pedestrian to rather neat, in
particular the beach and floating city tracks.  The beach graphics are very
nicely done, and the floating city is fun to look at.  It does look pretty
strange when your car falls, though...it looks like it's shrinking, not
falling.

The game features a small selection of music tracks for your listening and
racing enjoyment.  Take them or leave them, they're decent intense driving
music without a ton of complexity.  They're pretty annoying when you're in
8th place, though.

The game allows you to play with up to 4 people on the same machine, but
the screen gets pretty crowded beyond two different views.  An option is to
use the serial link (null modem cable or real live modem, 19200 baud
suggested), which spreads out the processing demands, joystick
availability, and monitor real estate.

If racing isn't your thing, you can race in Deathmatch mode (networked or
no), where the object is just to blow up the other players more times than
they get you.  This makes the power-up missiles a lot more satisfying to
use...

As those familiar with AR may be aware, our standard AGA test machine is an
A4000 040/25 and we make no apologies for using a machine closer to the
high than the low end.  Other than the necessary switch to PAL, the game
runs without complaint or incident.  XTR runs like a charm in 1x1
fullscreen.  CyberGraphX support is reportedly not forthcoming.

The documentation for the game is a bit thin, they don't even describe all
of the powerups (intentionally, they say, but I suspect it might have
something to do with printing deadlines...).  Functional, yes, and the game
is fairly self-explanatory, but still...

The game suffered some compatibility problems, but most of these have been
remedied by a free patch.  (There are reportedly still some problems with
Warp Engine 040s)  A future upgrade promises a track editor, more tracks,
support for 4-joystick adapters, and other in-game features.

Those of you lucky enough to have an Amiga store nearby that carries XTR
will notice a quote on the back from yours truly.  That rather glowing
quote was based on a pre-release version of XTR I played, and I do stand by
what I said.  XTR is a good blend of arcade action and driving realism
(except the missiles, sheep, floating cities, etc) and really is a quality
game.

XTR is hard drive installable (Extremely highly recommended), takes
advantage of accelerated machines (again, highly recommended) and is AGA
only.

                            Review: Breathless
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Doom, doom, doom.

There's no denying it.  The focus of the game development in 1995 was on
Doom-ish games, whether or not a whole lot actually made it to the market.

Around the time everyone was getting excited about Alien Breed 3D, from out
of nowhere a demo started making its way around the net.  The game was
Breathless, so we were told, and the demo was an old one of the game's
texturemapping 3D engine.

The developers, Fields of Vision, quickly found a publisher in Power
Computing of the UK.  It comes in a purplish box, with your typical
mega-suited up gun-slinging texturemapping game hero and some screenshots
on the back.

That's the preliminaries.  But the storyline, background, etc. of these
games are always pretty unimportant when they first arrive.  So a quick
hard drive installation later, Breathless is up and running.

So, how does it play?  Well, the engine is a rather flexible one, allowing
control over screen resolution ranging from
teeny-tiny-you've-gotta-be-kidding up to 320x200 (out of x256, this is of
course PAL we're talking about here), with available pixel widths of 1x1,
2x1, 1x2, and 2x2.  The bottom of the screen is taken up with your score,
health, shield, weapon energy, and weaponry/key indicators.

So, how does the game LOOK?  Had you caught me with the stock Breathless
release, I would have shrugged.  The game was playable in reduced
resolutions on a stock A4000/040, but certainly nothing exciting in a high
resolution with a high pixel clarity.  The control felt sterile, the
configurability was only acceptable.

Fortunately for this review's outcome, FOV released a Breathless V1.1 patch
to Aminet.  This has increased the output of the engine, added inertia to
the player's movements (the lack of which caused the aforementioned sterile
feeling), and in general made the game more configurable.

So, how is it to play?  Well, your job is to blast away at bad guys with a
selection of increasingly nasty weaponry.  You upgrade said weapons and buy
new ones by collecting credit globes that happen to be lying around the
levels you chug through.  There are computer terminals throughout the
levels ready to vend you these weapons, health, even keys if you can't find
them.  (Perhaps the evil bad guys should remove these conveniences, they'd
have an easier time defeating you.)  There are a dozen different aliens to
blast, and after a short while you'll be sick of killing "Cyborg 1"s.

Automapping is provided, as is a sight in the middle of the screen which
may be turned off.  It comes in handy when shooting up or down (you look up
or down using the numeric keypad.  The movement in this respect is
considerably improved from the original Breathless in the 1.1 patch.)  I
was a bit disappointed in the number of times the shots seemed not to reach
their target even when they were standing dead in my sights, though.  The
math on the "look up/look down" routines may not quite be perfect yet.

Breathless' engine supports varying light, which at times can put you in
rather dark and grey looking corridors.  They also tried to support a bit
of realistic detail in the form of floor-to-ceiling pipes, but again, the
calculations fell a bit short, as the pipes look two-dimensional as they
meet the floor.  Weaponry could have been a bit more "realistic" as well.
Errant shots simply disappear as they hit the wall, and the Cyborg 1 units
seem to have silencers on their plasma guns.

But those complaints don't detract from the fact that Breathless is a fast
world to whip around in, providing your Amiga is equipped for the task.
While 320x200 1x1 pixel depth is too much for the stock 040/25 to give a
reasonable frame rate on, kicking the resolution down a notch or switching
to 2x1 or 1x2 (my preferred of the two, although things can look a bit
fringed at times) helps considerably.  There have been reports that
Breathless is stunningly slow (slower than an 030/50) on an 060, but as we
haven't received any 060 accelerators yet, we can't verify this.

I do enjoy running around the Breathless world, blasting away at the
baddies.  I find the speed tolerable, the background music (with
configurable volume) appropriate, and the goal of getting to one more level
enough to keep me coming back for a while.  And of course, it's encouraging
to see that the game continues to be developed and supported by FOV.

What Breathless really needs, though, is a bit more atmosphere.  Yes, it's
a vague complaint, but right down to the stainless steel walls, Breathless
is missing the spark that even AB3D's 2x2 chunky display had.  I'm not sure
I really CARE about this guy's struggle, particularly when all he needs to
do is break open the gun vending machine to really wreak some havok.
Improved sound effects (and more of them) would work wonders.

Copy protection is a bit weird.  It's red writing on orange paper, not easy
to read.  It's on a small card, which is another problem...and it's in
runes!  Numerical or letter protection is difficult enough, but tiny runes
are another thing altogether.  The game IS hard drive installable, but you
have to fight with a teeny little card to get to your game.

If you're toting an accelerated AGA Amiga and want to get a lot of shooting
done, Breathless is a good investment.  It's missing networking, which is a
real loss because some levels would make for good deathmathches.  It's
missing that sense of style mentioned above.  But it does have a very good,
and growing, TMap engine that I would be pleased to see in other
implementations.

Breathless also was good for a couple of chuckles, but not for the game
itself.  The manual speaks of the planet "C64-6510", an obvious reference.
The registration card lists "Magazine Review" in the "Where did you get
this game?" list.  I guess the publishers want us to register more often.

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to majordomo@amigalib.com.

Your subject header will be ignored.  In the body of the message, enter

subscribe areport

The system will automatically pull your e-mail address from the message
header.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **

                          UUDecoding Amiga Report
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

                      Amiga Report Writing Guidelines
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

     4.  Please send us your article in ASCII format.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.

Please stipulate as well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to
the editor.

                  Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users
===========================================================================

                The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information

                  "Not just another UNIX Shell account!"

          -------------------------------------------------------

Portal is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-service online SIG
(Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users.  We promise, and WE
DELIVER ongoing & aggressive Amiga support!  Now, more than ever, with so
many Amiga magazines gone or shrunken, you need a viable,
professionally-maintained resource for information, software, and a link to
the world-wide Amiga community.

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in many ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA high-speed modems (you pay for the phone call
if it's not local), or though any SprintNet or Compuserve indial anywhere
(with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell service!  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help, and you can easily customize
it for your favorite terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1100 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files or
      100 email letters at once, of any size, with one command.
 * Amiga vendor areas with many companies participating.
 * So many incoming lines you'll probably NEVER get a busy signal
 * 40 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 12,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.
 * Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
      related and get quick replies from the experts.
 * Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, AMosaic, LightWave, ImageFX,
      Picasso II & others feed right into the Zone message bases.  Read
      months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with them.
 * FREE unlimited Internet Email with 5 meg of free storage.
      Your email is private, secure, and never censored or monitored.
 * A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.
      You can run AMosaic and other Browses via your shell and explore the
      vast World Wide Web!  Intermediate to advanced users can use
      any standard UNIX mail and news utilities, compilers, and other
      tools.  Ask for your free UNIX book when you sign up.
 * A home for your own Web page!  Your UNIX Shell on Portal is linked
      to Portal's Web Server. Create your own WWW pages for the whole
      world to access. No extra charges!
 * Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which you can read
      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine. Newsgroups are not censored!
 * Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
      never worry "Ooops... Am I paying more for this area?" again!
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS wrapped into user-friendly
      menus.  And you get FREE unlimited usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
      email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
 * Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
      at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
