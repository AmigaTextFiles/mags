All right!  Just days away from the Commodore International Liquidation
Failsafe date!

Any objection to the Commodore asset sale process has to be filed by this
Thursday at 5:00 PM EST.  As I write this, that's less than 72 hours away.

In theory, after that, there is nothing short of abject and total disaster 
that could delay the April 20th auction.

Unbelievable.

I will endeavor to put out a special edition after the US court delivers
its decision.  AR 3.09 will probably be delayed until after the Bahamas
court decides, unless I decide that's just taking too long.

In other news...officially, Amiga Report has started taking advertising.
Sound Concepts breaks the ground this issue.  I strongly encourage readers
to at least give reading them a chance.  It's gotten to the point where
it's not fun operating in a debt.  At the same time, with Amiga resources
dwindling (Amiga World has died, Amiga Pro has gone the same way), it's
becoming harder for vendors to reach their customers.  Amiga Report, with
worldwide distribution, seems a logical choice to fill in the void.

Late breaking stories that there are no press releases at present for
include-

NewTek's new product, a SCSI-II box designed to house a new Toaster card
and a Flyer for connection to an Amiga or PC.  Price: $8,000 ($3,000
without the Flyer).  Two drive bays (no drives supplied), can run in the
field on a lead-acid battery.  A computer with a 5 inch LCD screen is
available to do some field effects for $2000 extra.

SoftWood, Inc.  (makers of the Final Writer, Data, and Calc products) has
apparently signed on as North American distributors for Phase 5/AS&S
products, including the CyberStorm and CyberVision 64 cards.

So...don't book the band for the post-buyout party just yet, but stay
hopeful.

Jason

P.S.  Thanks to the kind souls who have offered to get off of the mailing
list.  We've started up a special "notification list" so that readers who
get AR through FTP or WWW will know when a new issue is out.  If you want
to switch, just let me know.  (anybody who offers to get off of the main
list will be automatically placed on the notification list)

From: DH.FELDBRUEGGE@uwmsg.hosp.wisc.edu (Donald H. Feldbruegge)
Subject: Latest_Issue_AR

Well, I just got ar306 last Friday.  The news isn't good is it.  I was
disappointed to read that Amiga World has ceased publication.  It isn't so
much (or only) that I have over a year remaining on my subscription.  The
more important aspect is that one more source of information has been lost.
I know that I have Amiga Report for news and reviews -- AND I THANK YOU FOR
THAT.  What I don't have is the tutorials and hints that a hard copy
magazine does so much better.  Ideas for the best way to create things with
"Helm", or to use some of the DTP features of FinalWriter.  I also had
always looked forward to some of the regular columns and to some of the
reader feedback and questions.  I can only hope that Amazing Computing
sticks it out.  They have always had some of the better tutorials, at any
rate.

The good news is that you are starting a new AR Tech magazine.  Thank you,
thank you, thank you.  I am not sure how much of it will be useful to me,
but I guess that I am going to rapidly learn to become more self sufficient
these days.  If AR Tech is nearly as good as AR, I am certain that I will
enjoy it and use it.  This does bring up a question.  Are all of you guys
(no gender implied) just doing this out of a love for the Amiga and the
Amigaphile community out here?  How can we (I) help to support you?  It
just doesn't seem fair to see all the work that you are putting into AR,
with no reward that I am aware of.  Well, if nothing else, I surely do want
to say how much I appreciate it.

I haven't made up my mind if I am happy or sad about the new information
about the liquidation proceedings.  I'm happy to hear that they really have
decided to have a sale (however, I'll believe it when it happens).  I'm
saddened to read that it is STILL several weeks off.  Good Lord, it is
rapidly approaching a year now.  The suppporters are dropping like flies,
eg Amiga World.  What will there be left to sell?  It seems to me that the
only thing there was 6 months ago were a lot of dedicated users,
developers, and sales/service people.  This has eroded rapidly, and every
week sees less developers and service people.  Trying to look at this
objectively, I am surprised to see that anybody is still even willing to
bid.  By the way, who (or what) is Escom?  What are their plans for the
Amiga?  Does anybody know anything?

I have a (another) question.  Has anybody looked at or reviewed or said
anything at all about this A2200A that "Computer Answers" in Canada is
selling?  My old A2000 is getting old (hmm, I think that was a double
negative or something) and it does get a lot of use.  I don't know how much
longer it (and especially the 1084S) can last, and repair service has
become a pretty scarce item around here.  I am starting to doubt that there
ever will be a new owner, and so beginning to think of ways to keep going
for as long as possible.  If the A2200A were to be a good alternative, I
might start getting my $$ together to purchase it.  If that A2200A isn't
any good, what is a good way to have a 1084S repaired and/or is there a
good way to use a different monitor?  Are there still any flicker fixers
still out there for sale?  Sure wish now that I'd bought a 1942 when they
first came out.

Well, I believe that I have said/asked enough, so will close.  Again, a
great big thank you for AR and for the upcoming AR Tech.  It is truly a big
service to all of the Amiga community.

Yours,
Don Feldbruegge
dh.feldbruegge@hosp.wis.edu

  -Just as an aside, a Usenetter claims he has a letter from Computer
  Answer's bankruptcy lawyers...so the A2200 may be a dead issue.

Subject: AR is great

Just a small note to thank you for the great Amiga Report.  It is refeshing
to get information on the current situation of Commodore, plus news and
reveiws from around the globe.  Keep it up.  Being stuck down the bottom
end of the world (OZ), we hardly get to know what is happening up there.

Is there any more likelyhood of a quick return of the Amiga?  What is it
like in the USA, Amiga wise.  Are many people still supporting it, or are
you worse than us?

Thanks for the time.  Keep up the great magazine.

   -Hmmm.  Hard to say.  It's not exactly a fun time in the US, but
   mail-order support is enough to get by on, and there are still some
   significantly large dealers (thankfully, one in my area).  But we'll
   need an event fairly soon to keep interest up.

INTERACTIVE IMAGINATIONS LAUNCHES RIDDLER(tm)
World Wide Web Gaming Environment Offers Cash Prizes

NEW YORK, April 5 -- Interactive Imaginations Inc., the New York-based
interactive entertainment company, today launched Riddler, the first
interactive gaming environment on the Internet to offer cash prizes to
players.  Riddler can be accessed on the World Wide Web at
http://www.riddler.com.

Riddler combines elements of trivia, scavenger hunts and an online road
rallye through the Web to present an interactive gaming format unique to
the medium.  Each game begins with the posting of a riddle and a prize of
$500 for the first to solve it.  Although players may attempt to solve the
riddle immediately, it is likely that they will need the additional clues
that they can earn -- by playing trivia and finding secret keywords hidden
on other Web pages -- as they progress through the game.

The Riddler Home Page also provides players with the opportunity to compete
for cash prizes in two additional contests.  Crispy Challenge™ is a daily
puzzle with a $100 prize.  The Tortoise and the Hare is an ongoing contest,
offering a $1,000 prize to the first player to accumulate 25,000 points.
Points are awarded both for winning games and for progress through Riddler.


Although players must fill out a registration form and verify that they are
18 years old, Riddler is sponsor-supported and there are no registration,
membership or hourly charges.

Announcing the launch, Interactive Imaginations president Michael Paolucci,
said, "Our vision is to become the preeminent entertainment company
programming for the World Wide Web.  That means providing the consumer with
more than just an entertaining page, and a lot more than the vicarious
involvement they have with game show contestants on television.

"Riddler is fun, challenging and very much in tune with the culture and
ethic of the Web.  And, every player has a real chance to win considerable
prize money."

Riddler's $500 opening prize is increased by $100 every day for the next
five days that the riddle remains unsolved.  On the seventh day, the prize
is increased by an additional $500, for a total of $1,500.  If the riddle
remains unsolved after a week, a new riddle is posted and the unclaimed
prize money rolls over to become the opening prize in the new game.

Players seeking clues to help them solve Riddler select a trivia category
-- such as music, movies, science or famous ad slogans -- which links them
to a sponsor's web page where a Riddler icon is located.  Clicking on the
icon takes the player to a round of four trivia questions in the selected
category.  For each correct answer, the player will receive a hint that
points to a page out on the Web where a keyword is hidden.  Keywords can be
exchanged for clues to the riddle.  There are four rounds of successively
more difficult trivia questions -- and four keywords hidden out on the Web
-- in each game of Riddler.

"Feedback from our recent beta tests," said Paolucci, "told us that players
not only enjoyed the challenge, but really liked the fact that the game
plays out on a variety of Web sites -- it gave them the opportunity to
explore the Web and search out new and interesting sites as they attempted
to solve the riddles."

If Riddler is solved within a week, the game continues for another 24-hours
so that players can continue to amass points towards the 25,000 point goal
of The Tortoise and the Hare.

"With the convergence of entertainment technologies and the rapid
development of increasingly sophisticated interactive multimedia
capabilities on the Internet," said Paolucci, "we believe that the personal
computer can emerge as the hardware choice for consumer entertainment.  The
determining factor will be entertainment programming.  Interactive
Imaginations' goal is to create the kind of unique programming on the Web
that has real entertainment value for the consumer."

@node NEWS5 "Best of the Amiga Scene Audio CD"
@toc NEWS

From the Executive Producer, Fredrik Elmqvist...

The Best of the Amiga Scene Audio CD

The CD was an old dream of mine.  I've caried it for 4 years after a
telphone chat with a former member of my gruop (X-TRADE).  We talked about
making a CD for privat use with onlu Amiga Music.  Anyway the time went on
and suddenly after a new telephone chat with a Friend of mine we got the
idea again.  This was the Autumn of 94 the idea came up again.  Well he
promised to check around for the prices of making CD's and even to make a
pre-view of a sleeve picture.  My own work with this CD began with sending
out a message through the swedish part of FIDONET (R20_AMIGASVMUSIK).  The
sugestions of songs litterary stormed into my mailbox in SPOT.  So I
thought this would be a good thing to work on.   Time went and in mid
NOVEMBER we thought we got a good collection of modules to record. 

14:th November 1994 we were at the KANAL GÖTEBORG STUDIOS in Gothenburg -
Sweden and used their Proffessional sound equipment and their AMIGA
4000/040 to record the CD.  We took away moslty of the AMIGA's uggly
4-channel stereo sound (which makes my ears to cry when listening at
modules through Headphones) and subsituted it with a better soundpicture
were the sound was more harmonic for our ears.  We did put everything at
DAT and in the begining of December i went up to Stockholm (Capital of
Sweden) and we started to put it down to Harddisk instead (through a
SUNRISE 16 SAMPLER card).  The sound files were together about 600Mb BIG.
I also got a first previev of the Sleeve picture and got realy amazed of
it.  The THREE biggest Amiga items were represented (JUGGLER, CHECKMARK
and the BOING!).  We first had our thoughts of releasing this CD at the
PARTY IV held in HERNING / DENMARK but we didn't manage to get the record
ready until then and we had to wait until the next party which were the
VIRTUAL CONSPIRACY held in NYKOPING / SWEDEN.  During this time the sleeve
got improved and we managed to find a better CD factory and best of ALL
they could handle IFF24BIT pictures without problems (The picture used at
the sleeve was traced in 3000*3000*24bits so it was delivered at 19 PC
FORMATED HD DISC's (splitted with ADPRO's SPLITS) but we had to convert it
into TIFF :-(. 

So MONDAY the 20st MARCH we entered the CD factory and left over a CD-R
image of the CD plus the discs.  They told us that they were unsure if
they could be ready with the CD until the party (2 weeks) but they should
give it a try...  Friday 30:st April we stood there and were REALY NERVOUS
the first reports from the CD factory was that the records was NOT ready
but we should call them apx 14:00 and check..  So we did and the record
was not ready so we had to wait to wait until today monday but after half
n our they called us at my GSM phone and told me that the records were
ready to be picked up...  YEEEEAH!...  we were like kids when the records
arrived from the factory.  Like children at chrismas day we teared up the
boxes eager to check them out.  And the result..  Check and JUDGE!!!!  :-)

got delayed with it).  So as i SAID..  This is not a good way of making
money but it is was realy funny to produce it and see the resaults of our
efforts with it.

@node NEWS6 "Elastic Reality (ASDG) Merged..."
@toc NEWS

TEWKSBURY, MASSACHUSETTS, U.S.A., 1995 MAR 31 (NB) -- In a deal
valued at $45 million, Avid Technology, a major player in digital
video hardware and software, has acquired two software companies:
Elastic Reality, a developer of software for film restoration, and
"morphing" and other special effects, and The Parallax Software
Group, a specialist in paint and compositing technology.

The acquisitions support Avid's "cross-platform strategy," as well
as adding to the high-end and corporate levels of Avid's three-tiered
product line-up, said Bob Sullivan, vice president of business
development and marketing, in an interview with Newsbytes.

Under terms of the two merger agreements, Avid has issued in
aggregate approximately 1.5 million shares of Avid common stock,
according to Sullivan.

Sullivan told Newsbytes that the acquisition of London, England-
based Parallax will allow Avid to provide "within the frame" as
well as "frame-to-frame" digital video editing tools to its high-
end customers, who are involved with professional production and
post-productions on TV shows, commercials, and feature films.

Madison, Wisconsin-based Elastic Reality will add image
manipulation technologies that can be used by these high-end
customers, in addition to corporate users and "independent
multimedia types," who typically work on PCs or Macs, he reported.

Avid's third target market, "broadcast news," consists of national
and local TV news programs, which demand tightly integrated
digital video production systems for the "mission-critical" task of
generating TV news, Sullivan said.

Products from Parallax and Elastic Reality are widely employed
in Hollywood production studios, according to the Avid exec.
Technology from Elastic Reality was used, for example, in
producing both "Forrest Gump" and "Death Becomes Her."

Parallax software operates on Silicon Graphics (SGI) workstations,
and Elastic Reality's products run on Macs and PCs as well as SGI
machines, he told Newsbytes.

Avid's products are also available for SGI, Macs, and PCs, Sullivan
pointed out. "This shows our commitment to multiple platforms," the
VP added.

@node FEATURE1 "Latest Liquidation Lowdown"
@toc FEATURE

===========================================================================
                        LATEST LIQUIDATION LOWDOWN
                           By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

The sale of assets, legal code, and asset lists are now available to
interested buyers and parties in the Commodore liquidation.

There is some great stuff in there.  But first, here are the essential,
critical facts:

The opening bid for Commodore's assets (in fact, the one that has been
signed to by all necessary parties) is $5 million dollars, submitted by
Escom and accepted by Commodore.  For a bid to be submitted to challenge
Escom, it must be for at least $7.3 million: $1 million more than Escom's
bid, plus $1.3 million to buy the German Commodore trademarks from Escom.

After that initial $7.3 million bid, bids must be in minimum increments of
$50,000.

After the highest bid has been determined in this fashion (i.e.  from all
parties interested in buying ALL of Commodore's assets) the assets will be
offered piecemeal.  The combined piecemeal bids must be larger than the
largest "total-package" bid.  Then, the largest "total-package" bidder and
the combined piecemeal bidders bid off against each other until the
liquidatior chooses a bid that is "highest or best".

The deal must be approved at the US Bankruptcy court on a date immediately
following the auction (in this case, April 21st, 1995).  The legal code
agreed to by all parties calls on the Bahamas Supreme Court to rubber-stamp
the decision Judge Garrity of the US Bankrupcy Court makes.

The deal must be closed (i.e.  paid in full) within 11-20 days of the
acceptance of the bid.

Assets are purchased "as-is, where-is"...meaning if you live in the
Philippines, you'll be able to get work for a few weeks or months moving
inventory out of that warehouse.

Any objections to this bid process or legal code must be made by 5:00 PM
EST, April 13th, 1995.

With luck, the Buyout Issue will come before the April 29, 1995 one-year
anniversary of the liquidation.  We can only hope.

And now, on the lighter side of the news...

Liquidation Fun Facts (tm)

Did You Know...

The creditor that launched this debacle is Banque Nationale de Paris, which
on April 25, 1994 "made a formal demand upon CIL (Commodore International,
Ltd.) for payment of its debt."

Commodore owns many trademarks, patents, and licenses.  Almost all of these
are for sale, but not all.  On the 2 page listing of those NOT for sale,
you will find such delights as-

   - Commodore UK's trademark on "Maggot Mania"
   - Commodore France's patent on a "device for controlling the opening and
     closing of fluidtight doors"
   - Commodore's one-time patents on their digital thermometer and
     thermostat.

Commodore's intellectual property and CDTV/CD32 software licenses are
valued at $12,000.

According to CD32 software license records, at least two licenses were
granted to developers AFTER Commodore entered liquidation.

Hughes Aircraft (A CDTV software licensee) has a standing legal suit
against CIL and Commodore US.

Commodore has the name "CDTV" trademarked 5 times in Japan.

The only listed inventory of completed machines is roughly 3,300 CD32s
(1400 PAL, 1900 NTSC), valued at $22.50 each.

Commodore's Philippines assets are book-valued at $14.5 million.  CEI
estimates claim that $2 million of that is Akiko chips at a cost of $15
each, or over 130,000 units.

Commodore's Norristown assets are book-valued at $4.7 million worth of CSG
chips, which would include virtually all chips necessary to the
construction of AGA Amigas.  Furthermore, CEI claims that roughly 200,000
Lisas have been constructed and are being held (unpaid) by Hewlett Packard,
their manufacturer.

A warehouse in the UK is holding over $1.2 million in Commodore assets (for
sale) consisting of "CEL Spare parts", CEL being Commodore Electronics,
Ltd.  What those spare parts are remains to be seen.

CSG (Commodore Semiconductor Group) has been taken over by GMT
Microelectronics Corporation (GMT was formed by CSG management), for a sum
of $4.3 million dollars to the liquidators of CSG plus a $1 million dollar
payment to the EPA on a standing lien for pollution.

Commodore-Amiga, Inc., Commodore Business Machines US, and Commodore
International Services Corporation are all still operational in some way,
as they have to sign the Commodore sale contracts.  All three are run by
Thomas Matsen, who once hung up on me when I called him for liquidation
information.

Some of the surprising places Commodore has registered its patents:
  - Israel (Actually registered by Amiga Corp., the pre-Commodore entity)
  - India
  - PCT (would someone like to explain where and what "PCT" is?  My only
    guess is that it's Pacific Coast Trading, Irving Gould's company.)

Psygnosis has made claims to compensation from Commodore for assistance in
the design of the CD32.

All in all, keep hoping we clear the 13th without an objection.  It should
be a very interesting auction.

[The IRC conference with Almathera accidentally lost one of Robert
Reiswig's questions...here it is, again...-Jason]

> 
> "Do you see CyberGraphics as being the RTG system of the Amiga's future?"

Yes. Cybergraphics is not only a card-independent system (allowing
one product to work on a variety of different graphics cards) but it
is actually faster (significantly in many cases) than the hardware
specific drivers provided with most cards. Cybergraphics is what
EGS should have been - a FAST and simple extension to the standard
Amiga libraries to allow programs to be converted simply to take
advantage of 24-bit graphics, and still maintain standard system
compatibility with the same executable code.

From: Miss J G Brandon <csc157@cent1.lancs.ac.uk>

Where, in the UK, can one get a simple three button Amiga mouse?  I've
been hunting for AGES (many months) but the only choice I have is
apparently a 3 button optical mouse from golden imagine (featuring the
extra expense due to the optical mechanism.)

I have a nasty little microswitch hacked onto my normal Amiga mouse, and
am running MMBShift, so that I can do multiple selections on workbench
without playing with the keyboard.

In dedicated computer shops, the shop-owners refuse to believe that
Amiga's can use a 3rd button, and tell me that 3-button Amiga mice do not
exist - which is why they don't stock such things, the same men [yes,
invariably the shop 'experts' who talk down to me as if I didn't have a
clue tend to be men] often accuse me of talking complete rubbish!

Dear Jason,

Was saddened to hear of the demise of AmigaWorld.  Living in the Virgin
Islands there are no local help sources on running the Amiga and all it's
capabilities.  Everything I learn is through reading and experimenting.

For example....  It took me a while to configure my SCSI system before I
was satisfied with its compatability with my new sw/hw set-up.  I have a
new (used) Amiga 2000HD which had a 2091 controller that would not accept
a CD Rom drive (NEC CDR-210) and really balked at my old Syquest 44.  The
Syquest ran ok on my A500 with an IVS Trumcard (GrandSlam).  I also had a
40M Quantum in the Trumcard.  They ran quite well together even using a
trial version of SID2 to do my serious directory work.

When I upgraded to the A2000 I also purchased a registered version of
SID2.  I really wish I had kept a log of the various configurations I
tried.  The system would not work with the Commodore 2091 controller as I
mentioned before.  So I took the GrandSlam out of the A500 loaded it up
with 8MB of ram and replaced the 2091 with it.  I put the CDRom in the
internal 5 1/4 slot, a Seagate 341M on a hard card that I jury rigged and
attached to the back of the controller.  I took the 52M Quantum that came
with the 200HD off the 2091 and put it on the 3 1/2 shelf next to DF0. 
Next I found a 4 slot SCSI cable and got everthing connected.  The Syquest
I am running externally off one of the controller card jacks.  The only
problem I still have is that the SCSI system sometimes "locks up".  The
drive lights on all units light and I have to "cold re-boot" to get
working again.  It seems that, but I am not sure yet, that opening a drive
when the IVS card is checking for disk changes, it gets confused and does
its "thing".  This also sometimes happens when I "snapshot" a window.

I installed a CSA Derringer 030/25/6882/25/4m and so far have had no
problems.  AIBB says my system compares to a 3000, which was about what I
expected.  I am contemplating upgrading to 2 meg of chip ram and maybe a
30 mhz Derringer board.

Anyone wanting to compare notes on Syquest scsi configuration especially
using IVS Trumcard devices...  please feel free to to contact me at my
internet address below.  I feel satisfied with how my SID2 works with both
Syquest & CDRoms.

Thanks,

Carl Butler

                   REVIEW: ALL TERRAIN RACING BY TEAM17
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

I'm a sucker for top-down racing games.  There, I've got that out of the
way.

All Terrain Racing (ATR) is in this vein.  A PAL-only, ECS concoction, it
takes a well-thought out, fast-paced, close-up approach to the age old
question: How can you round that curve on ice in your Formula racer without
getting nailed by a missle from the guy behind you?

Well, in case it hasn't occurred to you before, it will if you play it. 
The general idea is that you race, either against a group of human or
computer opponents, in one of three vehicles on one of three terrain-types
through a bunch of tracks.  Of course, powerups are available as you race
(the requirement of any arcade game is the existance of powerups), and as
you progress you can purchase upgrades for your car.  Since racing in a
league is possible, you can develop quite a roadmonster.

Alternately, you can compete head-to-head with a friend for points (points
occurring if you complete a lap first, race your opponent off the screen
causing him/her to be "warped" to catch up to you, or hitting them with a
missile).  I personally prefer this game to the rest...you don't have to
worry about the computer beating you and can yell back and forth at your
human opponent.

And the computer is quite a formidable opponent, at least in sheer numbers,
since up to four can race against you...

The game is supposed to be fun, and it is.  You get your choice of realms
to compete in (and the tracks are beautifully constructed), and the 21
different tracks should keep you occupied for a time.  One complaint about
the construction of the racing system is that the dimension of height is
handled rather poorly, it usually takes a lap or two to get the hang of it.
For that matter, the tracks are often fairly complicated, and in the Forest
setting, it's difficult to tell where you're supposed to go.

The obligatory Team17 plugs abound...my favorite is the polygon Team17
skyscraper on the sport track.

The action moves very fluidly, and the game is cooperative with a variety
of configurations, provided you put it in PAL.

The game is fun.  It's supposed to be.  I think Team17 is a bit obsessive
with the Trinity here (three cars, three landscapes, three game modes) and
more is always better.  But as a kick-back-and-enjoy game, it scores.

List Price:
$59.95 USD

Requirements:
AmigaOS 2.04+
1 megabyte RAM (ordering information lists 512k as required)
300k megabytes hard drive space on at least 1 machine
Sana-II network drivers 
Network Hardware (Ethernet, Arcnet, AmigaLink) 
    (from cursory examination, it should be possible to use Parnet or
    Sernet with a Sana-II driver, but the manual discourages such use)

Tested Setup:
3000T-040, 10M RAM
    Commodore 2065 Ethernet Board
3000-16, 2M RAM
    ASDG Lan Rover Ethernet Board
10 base 2 (Thinnet, Cheapernet, Co-ax) connection between the two

Summary:
I like Envoy.  A lot.  I recommend it to anyone with multiple Amigas
wishing to network them.  With Arcnet boards now around $60 or so, you can
build a quite usable network for not much money.

Envoy is simple to use, easy to install, and easy to use and maintain.

The only real problems lie in the lack of documentation, especially when a
problem occurs.  Envoy's requestors or error messages are usually vague as
to what the problem is, and do not help track it down.

[IAM does provide unlimited e-mail and fax technical support. -Jason]

I spent 30 minutes installing it - about 25 of those tracking down getting
the ASDG card to work.  After I got the proper SANA-II driver installed, it
installed on both machines in about 3 minutes each.

Its one of the nicest peer to peer networks I've used.

Review:
Envoy 2.0 is the new release of Envoy, Commodore's peer to peer networking
package.

It uses TCP/IP packets as its networking protocol, and allows for remote
volumes to be mounted and remote printers used (not tested, as my printers
are currently out of order)

It is a very simple product to install and use.  In fact, the only problems
I have with it result from its simplicity.

The install of Envoy takes almost no time.  Installation, using the
Commodore Installer, walks the user through the choices that the user must
make, and the possible values.  I did have the install halt on me several
times when set on "intermediate" level of complexity, it complained of not
being able to find a file or directory.  I did not have this problem on
"expert" level.

The install asks whether you want a simple or a complex network set up. 
Since Envoy uses TCP/IP, special steps have to be taken if the machine is
hooked into the Internet.  Also, if the installation is part of a large
Local Area Network, or a Wide Area Network, other information needs to be
known.  But in such cases, there should be people available with that
information, if they are not doing the installations themselves.  I would
predict that most users will use the simple network setting, and just use
it for a small LAN.

You have to give each machine a unique ID on the network, (Envoy does not
check possible values of machines already installed).  After the install is
completed, users and exports must be set up on each machine.

Users on each machine must be set up, with passwords if desired, and they
can be assigned into groups.  These groups can then be assigned security
and other privileges as a whole. 

The directories that are desired to be shared must be "exported" on each
machine. 

Once all the users have been set up, assigned into groups if desired,
volumes or directories have been exported, and users security set to allow
them access or deny them, the Install is completed.

The tools to do this are again, very simple and basic.  These can be
changed at about any time (although the manual suggest a reboot after
configuration information is changed, just to be on the safe side), but I
had no problem adding and removing volumes and directories from the export
list.

When I rebooted each machine when the other was connected - the volumes
that had been exported re-connected with no problem.  When one machine was
turned off, and one of the volumes on the machine that was off was
accessed, it took about 5 minutes before Envoy finally decided the host was
unreachable.  It did not check the other volumes on that host, or dismount
the one that couldn't be used.

I would prefer to see that be a little more intelligent - give the user the
choice of waiting (in case they know that server will be back) or
disconnect from that totally, and not have Envoy wait for so long trying
for a connection.

I did experience a few problems.  My 3000-16 with 2 megs of RAM, ran out of
memory on several occasions when used as a server.  The manual states that
1 meg is required, but with this SuperKickstarted 3000 - a little over 1
free was not enough once several of its volumes were mounted.  The answer
to this is of course, more memory, but Envoy did not give a useful warning
or failure message.  On the other machine, it just told me the connection
had failed - and no description of why. 

This should not be a problem in most cases - the server should be equipped
with plenty of memory, but if it is being used for some programs, and
memory runs low - Envoy does not seem to warn the user of possible
problems.  A warning message to the effect that "Not enough memory on
server to export volume" would have saved me a lot of trouble, trying to
find why that volume wouldn't export.

Envoy's diagnostic tools are non-existent.  One may want to install AmiTCP
just to have the ping utility handy to test connections.  This was a
problem with a friend who called me unable to get Envoy to work.  It turned
out one of his 2065's was jumpered to use 10baseT, but we spend a long time
checking out Envoy installation, the cabling, etc.

But, my complaints are minor, especially with the ease at which you can
network your Amigas together now.  If development of Envoy continues, I see
no reason why it could not become a excellent peer to peer example for
other platforms to envy. 

(try running Windows for Workgroups in 1 meg on a 386sx16) :)

PRODUCT NAME

 Squirrel SCSI Interface

BRIEF DESCRIPTION

 The Squirrel is a SCSI host adapter for the A600 and A1200 that uses the
PCMCIA (credit card) slot.

LIST PRICE

 69 UK Pounds, my friend paid 249 Dutch guilders.

SPECIAL HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 An A600 or A1200.

MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

 A1200 with MTEC 68030/28 MHz board with 4 MB Fast RAM, internal 545 MB
Seagate 3,5" HD, Goliath power supply.

 SCSI devices tested with the Squirrel: Quantum LPS 52 and Quantum
Lightning 540 hard disks, Archive DAT tape streamer, NEC CDR-25 CD-ROM
reader.

INSTALLATION

 The Squirrel needs to be inserted in the PCMCIA slot on the right of the
computer.  This should be easy but it wasn't on the one I tried because
part of the glued on lid stuck out just a little bit, preventing it from
sliding in properly.  When pressing the lid while inserting, the Squirrel
could be inserted quite easily.  The manual warns about not using too much
force because of the delicateness of the pins on the PCMCIA port.  The
Squirrel may be inserted and removed from the computer even when it is
switched on.  PCMCIA was designed for this and it can be very handy if you
need to use other PCMCIA peripherals, such as a modem, without having to
switch the computer off.  The squirrelscsi.device is automatically
dismounted when the Squirrel is removed.

 Next, the software has to be installed.  This is done using the standard
Commodore installer and is very easy.  The squirrelscsi.device is installed
and the User-Startup is modified to include a SCSIMounter command for each
SCSI address since the Squirrel is not automounting.  The user can also
choose to install the CD32 emulator or make a boot disk for the Squirrel or
for the CD32 emulator.

REVIEW

 When Commodore (RIP) first introduced the PCMCIA port on the A600 they
told us that this industry standard interface would mean the possibility to
add all kinds of devices from memory expansion to modems and network
adapters.  It has been slow to arrive, but now more and more peripherals
for the Amiga use the credit card slot.  At first, only memory cards could
be used, but now there is an external IDE controller (Overdrive), CD-ROM
adapters (Overdrive and Tandem) and modems can now also be used (using Erik
Quackenbush's pcmcom.device).

 The Squirrel is the first PCMCIA SCSI adapter designed specifically for
the Amiga.  It can't be used on a notebook PC because of physical
limitations (it's thicker than PCMCIA 2.0 specifications allow) and also
there is currently no software driver available for PCs.

 The Squirrel is a small black plastic box about the size of a credit card
but much thicker (about one centimetre).  It has an (ugly) yellow sticker
on top.  The cable is fixed to the casing and has a standard 50 pin
centronics style connector on the end.  It's about 40 cm long, which is
quite short.

 The Squirrel device driver is fully compatible with Commodore's standards
for SCSI host adapters.  It uses RDB (Ridged Disk Block) and you can use
HDToolBox to partition hard disks.

 The Squirrel comes with three disks of software.  The first one contains
the software needed to operate the interface (the device driver, HDToolBox,
SCSIMounter, Installer and the CD32 emulator).  The other two disks contain
useful stuff from the Aminet in LhA archived form.  The software version
included was 1.06.

 All SCSI devices that I had available (Quantum LPS 52 and Quantum
Lightning 540 hard disks, Archive DAT tape streamer, NEC CDR-25 CD-ROM
reader) worked fine with the Squirrel.  The hard disks obtained the same
speed as on an A3000, the DAT tape streamer was tested with AmiBack and the
TapeWorm filesystem, the CD-ROM reader was tested with Commodore's
CDFileSystem that is part of Workbench 3.1.

 I also tried to format a hard disk partition with Professional Filing
System by Michiel Pelt, but SCSIMounter doesn't seem to work with PFS
partitions.  I didn't succeed in making a mount file for it, which should
be possible.

 I wasn't able to test the CD32 emulator software that is part of the
Squirrel package because of the lack of CD32 titles on my part.

PERFORMANCE

 I've tested the Squirrel using DiskSpeed 4.1 with a Quantum Lightning 540S
which is normally used in my A3000.  These are the results.

  Read from file:   1223768 bytes/sec  |  CPU Available: 0%

  Average CPU Available: 0%  |  CPU Availability index: 0

 The results are roughly the same as on my A3000, in some cases even
slightly faster.  As you can see the Squirrel achieved about 1,2 MB/sec
when reading from a file.  According to HiSoft the Squirrel can
theoretically obtain 3 MB/sec data transfers on an accelerated A1200.

 The big difference with the A3000 is that the Squirrel leaves 0% CPU
available, effectively blocking multitasking during SCSI transfers, while
the A3000 leaves 46% free on average (77% during reads).

DOCUMENTATION

 The documentation is very good.  It looks very professional and explains
all the technical details you might want to know.  I do miss a
troubleshooting chapter with simple 'what to do if...' questions and
answers.

LIKES

 Good value for money.  It works as expected.  Good performance, nice
documentation and good support.

DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

 The casing could be better, especially the lid that stuck out preventing
the Squirrel from being inserted.  The cable is a little bit on the short
side.  It doesn't have automounting or autobooting capabilities, so you
must have an internal hard disk or use a boot disk.  The driver leaves 0%
CPU available during SCSI transfers, which is not a nice thing on a
multitasking computer.  I hope HiSoft can fix this in a future update of
the driver software.

COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

 There are other SCSI host adapters for the PCMCIA port, but they can only
be used on PCs since there aren't any Amiga drivers available for them
(yet?).  The cheapest one I've seen for the PC was almost twice as
expensive as the Squirrel, so PC owners: eat your heart out!

 Another possibility would be to use a SCSI adapter that connects to the
trapdoor expansion slot of the A1200.  I've personally only seen the GVP in
action which is also a fine product.

BUGS

 None that I have encountered.

VENDOR SUPPORT

 The Squirrel SCSI Interface comes with 30 days free technical support,
which is available by telephone, letter or fax.  I've also seen employees
of HiSoft present on the Internet and the update to version 1.05 of the
software (1.06 is the current version) was placed on the Aminet.

 At extra cost it's also possible to get extended support called Silver and
Gold Support which give you lifetime support, access to a support
conference on CIX and to their own BBS and free software updates.  These
extended support schemes seem a bit expensive to me.

CONCLUSIONS

 I can recommend the Squirrel to anyone who wants to add a CD-ROM or other
SCSI devices to his/her A1200.  If only HiSoft could manage to change the
driver so that it doesn't totally block multitasking during SCSI transfers,
then things would be even better.

                      EMULATION RAMBLER: PC-TASK 3.1
                           By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Ah, back in the emulation saddle once more!  Before I plunge in to PC-Task
3.1, some late-breaking emulation news-

ShapeShifter has been unleashed.  In theory, it is a shareware color
multitasking Macintosh emulator.  In practice, at present it is a fairly
difficult piece of software to run, that seems to exist best with a
graphics card (although AGA and ECS support is included).  Right now,
people are having difficulty getting it to work in many more colors than
16.  It requires a 512k or 1 meg Mac ROM (not included, obviously.)
It's available in Aminet, misc/emu.  Give it a shot.  I've offered the
author a review in exchange for a version I can use (so far, no luck here
at all).  No response yet.

The program is somewhat crippled (it supports hardfiles, but not logical
devices, as hard drives), but only $35.  This certainly marks the end of
the Mac emulation monopoly Utilities Unlimited has held ever since
ReadySoft gave up on A-Max IV.

Now, on with the show...

PC-Task 3.1
-----------

Last issue, guest Rambler Antony Karantze gave a good overview of PC-Task
3.0, the new 286-level software-based emulator.  In that time, the free
3.1 upgrade has been released.

You heard all about how it can REALLY, TRULY run Windows 3.1, how DOS
performance is pretty good...

But let's get down to some nitty-gritty.  How about some GAMES?

Ah, yes, games.  Justin Deeley, head of Quasar (PC-T 3's publisher) has
made it pretty clear you shouldn't really buy PC-Task 3 if your only
thought is gameplay.  After all, the 286 emulation prevents Doom or any
other new 386+ app from running, and Wolfenstein 3D is quite unbearable
even on a 4000/040 (25mhz stock) and AGA.  (Yes, it DOES run, but the
frame rate is unacceptably slow even in the smallest view mode.)  But,
hey, games were written before 1993, before 1990, even, when EGA was a
more viable way of reaching a large audience and VGA was a luxury.

Yeah, that's the ticket.  You may not want to play Wing Commander 1 on
your 3000 (030/25), but Wasteland, Interplay's post-holocaust RPG from
1988, is an absolute joy...well, ok, it's EGA and still won't set
landspeed records, but I find it playable-certainly faster overall than it
was on the 64, since after all you don't have to deal with floppies.

In fact, if you're looking for some cheap kicks on PC-T 3, I'd highly
recommend Interplay's 10th Anniversary CD...between Wasteland, Bard's Tale
1, and Tass Times in Tonetown, you'll have hours of fun in EGA and CGA
(Tass Times).

Another bonus you'll pick up in 3.1 is fixed PC Speaker support!  Now you
too can enjoy the classic rendered tunes in games like, oh, Tass Times in
Tonetown!  I can't tell the difference between it and the real thing, but
it is better than the genuine article in two ways...you can always turn
down the volume...or disable it altogether!

3.1 has also cleaned up some of the problems experienced with VGA and
above video modes.

EGA has also been vastly improved, thanks to fixing the "Wasteland Bug".
The graphics modes are by no means perfect...a new one that I'll dub the
"Dragon Wars Bug" finds the mouse pointer actually warping the VGA screen
as you move it...not too much at first, but the problem increases if the
screen doesn't get updated for a time.  Still, it's enjoyable.

With that, I would strongly recommend against prolonged VGA work under
anything short of an 040.  You'll not like yourself.

Next time, I'll tackle some serious applications on the PC side, and
everyone's favorite, benchmarks.  Until now, I leave you with this
thought...anything that allows you to play Tass Times in Tonetown on a
Wokrbench window can't be bad.

                           REVIEW: AMINET CD 5
                           By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

It is somewhat ironic, and in other ways a sign of the times.

Aminet, the worldwide repository of freely distributable Amiga software,
continues to grow-in fact, its pace is ever increasing.

For a "dead" machine, that's interesting.  On the one hand, it goes
against what should be the logical flow-with a stagnant market, software
circulation and development should decrease.  Of course, on the other
hand, it reflects a shift in Amiga business-as-usual: now that full-blown
companies find it difficult to justify financial investment in the Amiga,
it falls to the developers to distribute the product as they see fit, and
say what you will about shareware, but at least you don't have to pay to
have boxes made and manuals printed.

Anyway, the point of all this is that the Aminet CD-ROM series has done
well enough that it's become a quarterly phenomenon and been turned into a
comprehensive (at the time of the capture, anyway) four-disc Aminet Set
#1.

Aminet CD 5 just continues the fine tradition.  Nothing major has
changed-the intuitive AmigaGuide interface is still present to guide you
through the contents.  The theme of this disc is games, and roughly 1000
are present.

Over 400 megs on this CD are new since the release of Aminet CD 4, and
over 200 from the release of Aminet Set 1.  So, unless you've got a large
hard drive and lots of time to FTP, this is the most efficient way to get
a hold of all of it.

The only major change this disc represents is the end of the "Share" vs.
"Gold" concept.  Chalk it up as an experiment that resulted in failure, as
only a tiny portion of the Share buyers sent in the recommended
contribution (or any contribution, for that matter.)  So this and future
CDs until further notice will be priced at 25 DM (approx. US$19).  Not bad
at all.

Aminet and the CD series have established themselves as the clear #1
source of freely redistributable software, and show no signs of slowing-in
fact, Urban Mueller, the chief Aminet administrator, has indicated that
serious consideration is being given to making the series bimonthly,
rather than the 3-4 month intervals being observed presently.

Sadly, Aminet 5 still does not contain the entire Amiga Report archive.
However, I'm told Aminet 6 will.  Stay tuned...

                           By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Ah, fractals.  To some, fascinating mathematical phenomena.  To others,
pretty pictures.  To still others, bizarre looking items that aren't
really deserving of their own dedicated CD.

I'm somewhere between two and three, personally.  But Uwe Kruger and Heinz
Wolf are strong blends of one and two.  They've compiled a CD-ROM full of
507 fractals from the Mandelbrot set, complete with the formula used for
each.  Every fractal is rendered in three resolutions (640x400, 1024x768,
and 1140x890), all 256 color GIFs.  In addition, 20 of their favorites are
packaged as 24-bit TIFFs.

The CD comes with considerable background information on fractals,
including the theory behind their existance and the method used to
generate them, not to mention the triple-platform viewers on the disc.

So, you're certainly not left in the dark as to why they're there or what
you should do with them-view them, silly!  And I must admit, quite a few
of them are neat.

Still, it's going to take a certain kind of person to WANT a disc full of
507 fractals.  The price won't make you run in terror (29.8 DM or US$23)
but...it's just going to be a matter of whether or not you think 507
fractals will look good in your CD rack.

An excellent investment and compilation, for the sort of people who's
boats will be floated.

                        REVIEW: THE LIGHT WORKS CD
                           By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

In the wake of the Light-ROM CD and the impending Light-ROM 2 CD comes The
Light Works, a compilation of those things rendered and renderable.

More specifically, the collection is primarily the work of Tobias Richter,
famous for his Star Trek renders and his highly playable Shareware Star
Trek game.

The disc is comprised of a great number of prerendered scenes and
animations, as well as objects in Cinema4D, Reflections, and Imagine
(sorry, Lightwave users.)  To facilitate dabblers, demo versions of
Cinema4D and Reflections are included.

The collection is almost exclusively Science Fiction-oriented, which is
one of the things that sets it apart from Light-ROM.  The organization
seems to be a bit better, designed to make the animations and pictures
clearly defined away from the objects themselves.  The mere inclusion of
the animations also distinguishes it...and let me tell you, even the HAM-6
animations are gorgeous.

For a renderfiend who's looking for good source material, this could be an
excellent choice.  As an artistic collection, I'd suggest a second thought
or two, since the disc is priced at 79 DM (US$61)...this surprised me, as
Stefan Ossowski's Schatztruhe has established itself in my mind as a
source for very low-priced CDs (the Meeting Pearls and original Aminet
Share CDs were brought in at 19 DM, or about US$13-admittedly, they
reflected no profit for the authors, but still...)  Either the Schatztruhe
believes that Richter's work is worth a pretty penny, or Richter himself
does.

I don't think you'd be disappointed with the content.  But with Light-ROM
a notch or two cheaper, you may want to think twice if your needs are not
exclusively sci-fi.

                  REVIEW: THE BEST OF THE AMIGA SCENE CD
                           By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
==========================================================================

Just released, the Best of the Amiga Scene CD provides a way for Amiga
users to "take the music with them"...18 quality MODs placed on audio CD.

Rather well done, too-the production was done almost entirely with Amiga
equipment (including a 3000/040 with 110 megs of RAM.  Why don't magazines
have machines like that?), including piping through a Sunrise 16 card to
reduce some of the limitations of the 8-bit MOD format.

The cover was rendered on an Amiga as well...you know, the Juggler, a few
Boing balls, and the like.  Nice job.

But, what's the selection like, you ask?

Pretty good, overall.  The inside jacket expresses their regret over not
being able to include a larger selection of artists...which I would feel
ok about, if they didn't give a few artists double-coverage.  That DOES
tend to reduce the amount you can cover...

They run the gamut from fast to slow, although none of them fall into the
"heavy techno" quality.  One sounds a bit like it was taken from 64 music
(or was written for easy portability to the 64, since I know I've heard it
before), but I can't complain too much.

Reknown artists such as 4-Mat and Joegir Liljedahl grace the contents...to
my knowledge, all of the artists were either contacted for permission or
do not have restrictions on their music's use.  At least, I hope so, for
the producer's sake.

If I had put together this CD, I would have of course done it differently.
But at a price of about US$14, for 74 minutes of play, it's a good value.
And it's dedicated to Jay Miner...how can you go wrong?

@node REVIEW9 "3.1, 3.0, 2.1..."
@toc REVIEW

==========================================================================
                             3.1, 3.0, 2.1...
                           By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
==========================================================================

I took the plunge from my trusty 3000, which had served me well for some
time with AmigaOS 2.1, into 3.1.

I was skeptical, to say the least.  After all, anything that requires
taking out the drive bay of a 3000 had damn well be special, because it is
NOT the easiest job in the world.  (Actually, it wasn't such a bad thing,
the machine certainly needed a dusting.)

After a few weeks of playing around, getting a feel for the new 3.1 OS,
and watching where software is going, I came to this conclusion-

While 3.1 isn't for everyone, and may well be difficult to justify right
now for 3.0 users, it's going to be more and more important.

The immediate improvements were clear.  Better boot-menu.  (Still not as
good as a whack with Degrader, but if you need a PAL-switch or
cache-disable in a hurry, it'll do the trick.  Faster Intuition responses
to commands.  CD-ROM filesystem support (yeah, it's not perfect, but it
works.)  New manuals with funky stone texture pictures (but no handy dandy
shelving unit as with 2.1.  Pity.  At least they fit in the 2.1 manuals'
places well.)  Commas in the Workbench memory indicators.

Seriously, though, system operation as a whole is improved.  But faster
window-renders and a few new devices may not be enough to motivate people
to shell out the kind of money that's being asked.

What SHOULD motivate the consumer, though, is the direction software is
moving in.  Already, the writing on the wall is there for those interested
in graphics work-3.x is the way to go.  The release of Photogenics, as an
"AGA or 3.1 plus graphics card" piece of software could be motivation
enough for some.  Actually, that's not exactly true, as Photogenics seems
to work just fine in 3.1 under ECS 16-color operation, but it's tough to
appreciate 24-bit manipulation in 16 color greyscale.

The next good reason is CyberGraphics, the new graphics-card system that
is rapidly being ported to most, if not all, available cards for the
Amiga and picking up the slack left by a Viona (developers of EGS) which
has become a bit disillusioned by the current state of the Amiga market.
CyberGraphics requires 3.0 or better, and developers like Almathera
(makers of Photogenics) are incredibly enthusiastic, fortelling it as what
RTG can and should be on the Amiga.

Networking software is also leaning in the 3.0 direction.  Programs like
AMosaic and Grapevine IRC are considerably more stable under a 3.x
environment.

You also get datatypes (which, if nothing else, are a convenience to make
life more straightforward and simple).  AmigaGuide is enhanced (you know,
one of these days, we're going to take advantage of it...AmigaGuide under
3.1 adds the backslash as an identifier, which is why you 3.1 users see
the title screens as garbled.  We'll have to make a decision one of these
days...)  One-stop JPEG and GIF viewing is at hand.  Some Workbench
conveniences like picture backdrops can be attained without semi-hacks
like NickPrefs.

You do wind up giving up things like NickPrefs and ARQ (losing the latter
does bother me a bit), as they don't agree well with the 3.1 environment.

However, the bottom line is that support for ECS machines has not been at
the top of the list for any of the Amiga buyer candidates, and while I'm
all for supporting whoever winds up making new Amigas by buying new
machines, there's still a good deal of life left in ECS machines
(particularly 2000s and 3000s, which by virtue of being slot-boxes can
expand considerably to keep up)...and 3.1 is a step in catching up.

   From version 2.0 to 2.4:
   Martin Gierich  (uj3w@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de)

DESCRIPTION

   Features:
   * Usage is similar (or better) to the standard AmigaDOS shell.
   * Supports the standard housekeeping commands which are builtin,
     so no disk access is necessary.
     eg. list, dir, cd, assign, delete, copy, move, path, info, type
   * A total of 65 built-in commands.
   * About 30K small (pure assembler code, source included).
   * Starting from Workbench (!) or CLI. No installation needed.
   * File name completion by simply pressing TAB; shows all matches.
   * Review-buffer to see again what scrolled out of the window.
   * Some commands and debugging features for programmers.
   * Command line editing better than OS2.0 Shell.
   * Support of OS2.0+ and OS3.0+ specific features.
   * DIR and LIST both sort (by default) and show file sizes.
   * Wild cards and recursive processing.
   * Makes itself resident for quicker starting and memory saving.
   * Real (!) RUN and NEWCLI command that reenters ZShell quickly.
   * Application-Window/-Icon.
   * Simple 'MORE' type text viewer.
   * Online Help function and AmigaGuide documentation with examples.
   * Can create and show Hard- and Softlinks.

   ZShell is a small (30K), fast and powerful Shell with many (65)
   built-in commands. So it replaces most of the commands in the C:
   directory (like LIST, COPY etc.) which saves disk space
   and reduces disk accesses. There is no way around ZShell for
   those who do not have a hard disk or still have Kickstart 1.2/1.3.

   It is useful for those with a better Kickstart and/or
   hard disk, too, because (for example) it has powerful editing &
   history, file name completion, review buffer, some Kickstart
   2.0/3.0 specific features and a lovely LIST command.

   ZShell is inteded for shell users who do not need a script
   file execution which is as complex as a programming language
   (simple script execution with IF, ASK, SKIP etc. is supported).
   I tried to make usage nearly like the AmigaDOS Shell with some
   features known from UN*X Shells but without a confusing variety
   of options ("LIST -R" and "LIST ALL" both work).

   For programmers ZShell has things like showing EXEC-lists and
   the task list, memory dumping and execution checking.

   You can switch off the internal command-line-editor to use
   ZShell with console handlers like KingCON.

NEW FEATURES SINCE V2.2

   Support of OS2.0+ specific stuff (MALELINK, MAKEICON,
   ASSIGN ADD, Application-Window etc.).
   Totally rewrote PATH, COPY, DELETE, PROTECT, MOVE and JOIN.
   Bugfixes.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

   None.
   (Works with every Kickstart and does not use
   disk-based libraries.)

DESCRIPTION

     AmigaElm is an "Electronic Mail Reader" which allows you to read and
     write mail. Normally you'd need a properly installed UUCP or IP
     package (eg, AmigaUUCP, Feulner-UUCP, Dillon-UUCP, wUUCP or AmiTCP
     plus InetUtils) to receive and send mail, but AmigaElm is highly
     configurable so that you can take a mail-folder from a UNIX box,
     answer the mail and bring the answers back to the UNIX box.

     AmigaElm is easy to install and to use. The user interface is very
     intuitive and similar to the well-known UNIX "elm". Beginners can
     control all basic functions with menus and some nice GadTools
     requesters. Advanced users can use aliases, prioritized message tagging,
     various filename-offers when saving messages and lots of options to
     configure AmigaElm to fit your needs. In a system with multiple users,
     AmigaElm allows separate configuration files for each user.

     AmigaElm can be invoked in a special "terminal mode" (all input/output
     from/to console). This is useful for running AmigaElm in the current
     shell window or over a serial line (eg, with AUX-Handler).

     AmigaElm offers basic internal MIME (multimedia mail) functionality
     (eg, sending 8-bit-text and binaries over 7-bit-lines) and supports
     "MetaMail" (a full-featured package for handling all kinds of MIME
     messages -- also available on AmiNet, see section "AVAILABILITY") and
     "ReqTools" library 2.x (reqtools.library is included).

     AmigaElm has built-in support for cryptographic applications (eg, PGP).
     Encryption and decryption of messages is user-configurable.

NEW FEATURES

     Changes since version 4:  (summary)
      - Now when launching programs, AmigaElm checks return code.
      - New script "DecodeNeXTmail" decodes NeXTmail.
      - Some experimental RFC1522 handling for incoming and outgoing mail
        to use special chars (eg, Umlaute, 8-bit-chars) within header.
      - Improved ^L (formfeed, ctrl-l) handling.
      - Title bar displays current page number and total number of pages.
      - Improved handling of lines beginning with "From " and ">From "
        (useful for some mailing list software).
      - Keeping of old UID/GID of folder had never worked. Works now!
      - Fixed bug: "Send-off Window" didn't always open on same screen
        as Elm's main window (but on default screen).

     (see file "History.Txt" for complete list of changes)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     AmigaOS 2.0 (or higher)

     And for normal usage: a properly installed UUCP or IP package.
     But can be configured to run without a UUCP or IP package for
     processing ready-made mail-folders (eg, from your work or
     university).

   Amiga 4000 Hardware Guide

VERSION

   Version 2.0 (03/95)

AUTHOR

   The Guide is edited and compiled by:
   Warren Block  (wblock@silver.sdsmt.edu)
   See the file itself for the long list of people who have contributed.

DESCRIPTION

   The Amiga 4000 Hardware Guide is an Amigaguide document that describes
   many types of technical details about the Amiga 4000, common problems and

   and hardware patches also apply to other Amiga computers and peripherals
   (especially monitors).

NEW FEATURES

   * New user interface, including cross-referencing and a complete index.

DESCRIPTION

   Many A1200 owners asked for a document like the A4000 Hardware Guide, only
   specifically for the A1200. This isn't it! But it is a simple text
   document that attempts to answer most of the commonly-asked questions
   relating to A1200 hardware.

NEW FEATURES

   * It exists! (Apparently, there wasn't one before.)

   * New and improved! (See above.)

     ChaosPro

VERSION

     V1.0.180

AUTHOR

     Martin Pfingstl
     EMail: pfingstl@informatik.tu-muenchen.de

DESCRIPTION

     ChaosPro is a fractal generating and exploring program.

     - It is able to transform the 2D images into the third dimension
       to get nice looking fractal mountains or valleys.

     - The fractal pictures can be saved in 24 bit. If you choose the
       right parameters, you get stunning pictures with lots of
       colors.

     - Animations can be created, such as a 3D fly into the M-Set.
       The animations are saved in AnimOpt5 format, and can therefore
       be played with your favorite anim program.

     Of course the program has:
     - ...an Arexx Port

     - ...contexts ensitive Online Help

     - ...is font sensitive

     - ...multi-level-undo/redo for the various parameters,

     - ...several fractal types such as Julia set, Mandelbrot set,
       Bifurcation diagrams, Brownian Motion, Lyapunov Space, Dynamic
       Systems and a formula editor for creating your own Julia- and
       Mandelbrot sets.

     ChaosPro should run on all graphics cards with an intuition
     emulator; it doesn't use hacks (as far as I know).

     What makes it different from the competitors?

     There are many other fractal programs out there, like FractInt
     and Mand2000: ChaosPro is ment to combine the power of FractInt
     with the well known features of Mand2000 like Multiwindowing
     (several fractals can be calculated at the same time in
     different windows) and this 'Click and Zoom' (just double click
     onto an interesting point of the fractal and the program will
     zoom in...)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     - Amiga OS2.0

     - FPU (68881/68882/68040)

     - 1 MB RAM just to run.
       If you want to calculate and save, say, a 640x480 fractal in
       24 bit, then you will need more RAM (1.2 MB just for the
       buffer!)

     - Harddisk not required.

     - reqtools.library (included in the archive),

     - Installer from Commodore (not included) 

     - amigaguide.library from Commodore (not included).

             Deluxe MIDI Converter by Nick Didkovsky
                 (C) 1995 Didkovsky/NerveWare


      Create a MIDI file from any Deluxe Music 2.0 score

* Deluxe MIDI Converter translates your DMusic2 scores to MIDI files.

* The MIDI file is meticulously crafted, properly translating all 
  durations, tuplets, dynamic markings, ties, instrument changes, and 
  play styles.

* Export your Deluxe Music compositions to high end sequencers like 
  "Bars and Pipes Pro" and "KCS" on the Amiga.  

* Cross platforms: Deluxe MIDI Converter has allowed our users to 
  easily transport their compositions over to Cakewalk, Metro, and 
  Vision.  Any sequencer on any platform that can read "Type 1" MIDI 
  files will work.

* Export your Deluxe Music 2.0 compositions to high end music 
  publishing software.  Our users have successfully transported their 
  Deluxe Music scores to serious publishing software like Finale 
  (Mac), and SCORE (IBM family).  Deluxe MIDI Converter makes it 
  possible.

* The MIDI file contains an extra "conductor track" which contains 
  tempo changes and time signature changes for smooth and accurate 
  translation.
  

         About Deluxe Music 2.0 and Deluxe MIDI Converter

     A MIDI file is a music file written in a standard format recognized by
hundreds of music programs on a wide variety of computers.  Any program
that knows how to import a MIDI file (most do) doesn't care whether it came
from a MAC, an Amiga, and Atari, or an IBM.  It is a file format that is
the key to transporting musical work across computer systems and programs.

     Deluxe MIDI Converter reads in your entire Deluxe Music score via
ARexx.  It then automatically converts the score to a meticulously crafted
MIDI file.

     No ARexx programming required.

     You will be able to play back your score with Amiga sequencers such as
Dr.  T's "KCS" or Blue Ribbon Soundworks' "Bars and Pipes".   Other
programs on other platforms, like Cakewalk for the IBM family of computers,
will be able to play and edit it, too. 

     If professional scoring is your interest, you should know that high
end music publishing software such as Finale on the Mac, and SCORE for IBM
compatibles import MIDI files, offering you the possibility of producing
professional, publishable scores.

                         System Requirements

To use Deluxe MIDI Converter, you need:

* An Amiga with at least 1.5 megs ram, running WorkBench 1.3 or higher
* Deluxe Music 2.0
* ARexx running on your Amiga

     Fourth Dimension Software

     (204) 275-1149

AUTHOR

     Brian D. King
     umking21@cc.umanitoba.ca

DESCRIPTION

     This software provides a useful and usable front-end for
     Stephan Boberg's LHA software.  Since LHA is CLI-based,
     the beginning user is often intimidated by the program's
     interface.  By providing a useful, yet simple, graphical
     user interface (GUI) to the LHA software, this application
     makes the use of LHA much simpler for the average user.

     ** NOTE **  This software does not provide the transparent
     use of LHA archives as directories or volumes on the Amiga.

     Some of the key features of LhA-GUI are:
     - Amiga User Interface Style-Guide compliant
     - Font and screen adaptive without using any external
       libraries.  No MUI, Triton, BGUI, etc. is needed.
     - Hierarchial (directory tree) listing of an archive's
       contents.
     - Drag and drop support (AppWindows and AppIcons).  Simply
       drop an LHA archive's icon onto the LhA-GUI interface,
       and the archives contents are displayed.
     - Iconification support.
     - Notification support.  If the user changes their Workbench
       settings (screen-mode, font, overscan), LhA-GUI knows it,
       and re-adjusts accordingly.
     - Viewing support (including MultiView under OS-3.x).  You
       can simply double-click on an an entry in an archive, and
       it will automagically be extracted to a temporary location,
       and viewed using MultiView.  Thus, you can read/view part
       of an archive, without extracting the complete thing.
     - Preferences settings for LHA options, default directory,
       etc.
     - Under 50K in size.

CHANGES

     New in this version (1.12) are the following bug-fixes and
     features:
     - Online AmigaGuide-based help (OS 3.x only, for now).
     - Eliminated Enforcer hits.
     - Fixed iconification, notification, and archive extraction
       bugs.
     - Enhanced AmigaGuide documentation.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     AmigaOS 2.1 or higher, PIPE: device mounted, LHA executable
     in your path (registered or unregistered will work).

===============================

So what's on these disks?  Since this contains some of the best of the
AMUC Express (AMIGA ONLY) BBS you can expect to find a huge number
of IFF and JPEG pictures, animations sounds, mods, 3D objects,
clipart, fonts (bitmap and structured), text files, programs and
demos from all over the world.  The files are primarily stored as
LZH, LHA or DMS files.

There are FILES.BBS and 00_INDEX.TXT files in all the directories,
as well as long descriptions of most files stored in a separate
description file tree.

The directory names are a maximum of 8 characters with 3 character
extensions, so it is usable on most PC based systems (there are file
names that are longer than 8+3 characters, so how these will appear on
your PC system will depend on the CDROM driver you have). The disk is
an ISO9660 format disk.

The AMUC2/3 set also includes two searching utilities along with
the databases for AMUC1, AMUC2 and AMUC3.  These allow you to search
for files by name (including with AmigaDOS wildcards) and by content.
The contents of all the files have been scanned and the keywords
from them have been placed into a large database for fast approximate
searches.

AMUC is a non-profit organization dedicated to the support of Amiga
Users and the promotion of the Amiga computer.  Purchasers of either
the AMUC1 CDROM or the AMUC2/3 set are eligable for a $10.00 discount
on an AMUC mail-out membership.

Conversion 0.9beta

        Conversion is a commodity that converts Metric units to English
units or vice versa.  Being a commodity, it is especially useful because
you just pop it up when you need it and hide it when you are done.

        I thought up the idea because a lot of times I'm talking to other
people in different parts of the world, and they will tell me something
like "I'm 1.8 Meters tall", and I will tell them "I'm 6 feet tall", leaving
us both slightly baffled, until we look it up in a book or something...
You may find your own use for the program.  If you do, and you have
suggestions on how the program might better serve you, let me know.

REQUIREMENTS

  *  Any Amiga computer with KS2.04 or above.

EXTRA FEATURES

         Conversion gives you the ability to cut the values you calculate
into the clipboard.

WHERE TO FIND 

         Conversion can be found on any Aminet site (ie..  ftp.wustl.edu)
ie..:

ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/cdity/Conversion0.9b.lha

        Conversion is shareware so if you like it, I would ask that you
register it by sending me $5 US or the equivalent in you own currency.  If
you register it you will get your very own registered copy of Conversion,
along with some cool printed out documentation.  Also you will receive any
updates I might make.  For $15 dollars I will make a customized program
that does whatever you need it to do...

TITLE

    ADtoHT, Release 2

VERSION

    2.0

AUTHOR

    Christian Stieber
        (Stieber@Informatik.TU-Muenchen.de)
        (Stieber@LEO.org)

DESCRIPTION

    This program is only useful for developers. If you don't write
    programs, there is no need for you to read on.

    This program converts autodocs and C header files to amigaguide,
    creating links. It is targeted at the system online docs; the
    include file parser is rather sketchy and will only handle
    a limited subset of ANSI/ISO C correctly.

    Compared to the Commodore utility AD2HT, ADtoHT has the
    following advantages (this list is not necessarily complete):
      - it converts both autodocs AND include files
      - it is smarter
      - the output looks better (IMHO)
      - I'm alive, Commodore is dead

    In addition to the converted files, a global table of contents and
        an AmigaGuide crossreference file can be created.

NEW FEATURES

    This is a completely new program that contains no code from
    the 1.3 release. You should delete ADtoHT 1.3 since it has
    many disadvantages and even some serious bugs.

    Release 2 is much better and has no (known) bugs. It is probably
    slower than release 1.3, though.

REQUIREMENTS

    AmigaOS 2.04 (V37) or later is of course required.
    AmigaOS 3.1  (V40) or later is strongly recommended, since it
      will speed up reading/writing considerably.

    You also need some autodocs and C header files -:)

@toc FTP

NAME
    KingFisher

VERSION
    2.8

SYNOPSIS
    An update to the PREMIER "Fish Disk" & CD-ROM software catalog
    maintenance and search tool available to all Amigas with KS2.04 or
    later.   See PURPOSE section below for more details.

    NOTE: This is a *MAJOR* release!  Many, many problems fixed.

NEW FEATURES
    ----- KingFisher 2.8 ------------------------------------------
    Many problems fixed     - index, add/append fish, expressions
    Non-mounted volumes     - Now handled gracefully with requester
    Reindexing database     - Operation sped up significantly
    Search Expressions      - Now supports DOS patterns
    QuickIndex              - Now sortable by .version field
    Clipboard               - Now clip search result to clipboard
    Install database...     - Easy adding of databases from CD-ROM
    Delete fish...          - Actually truncates involved files

    ----- KFServer 2.8 --------------------------------------------
    Many problems fixed     - sanity check added, speed increased
    Many small enhancements - Connect/uptime status, SETTINGS param

    ----- RexxFisher 2.8 ------------------------------------------
    Search Expressions      - Now supports DOS patterns
    New command             - SELECTFISH fishnumber (see the docs!)
    New demo program        - Versions.kfrx traverses VersionLinks

PURPOSE
    KingFisher is a tool specifically designed to maintain and search one
    or more databases for software.  The program permits manual browsing,
    but offers a powerful expression parser through which you can explain
    to KingFisher exactly what you are looking for.

    The layout of database records for display is programmable, as is the
    format used for printing and that for writing records to a file.  This
    permits complete customization, separately for each database.

    KingFisher uses a resizable GadTools window on the default public
    screen or on a custom screen, offers the choice of both smart and
    simple refresh windows, and supports proportional fonts (including
    scalable fonts) of nearly any size.

    KingFisher supports more than one database, and databases that are
    larger than a single disk volume, which are spread over any number of
    disks to be mounted on request.

    Using advanced Client-Server Technology, KingFisher supports multiple
    simultaneous users with a minimum of memory overhead (as little as 30K)
    for each user (an ARexx-based interface named RexxFisher provides a BBS
    with the means to serve many databases to many users!) KingFisher's
    multi-user support in NO WAY hinders its value in a single-user
    environment!

    KingFisher is localized.  Catalogs are supplied for Dansk, Deutsch,
    Espanol, Nederlands, Suomi, and Svenska.  More are expected as
    translators are found (hint, hint!)

    Fully integrated AmigaGuide help provides context sensitive assistance
    and information on menu items and gadgets under the mouse pointer. 
    Hundreds of links cross-reference over 150K of documentation.

    KingFisher comes with a complete, read-to-use database of descriptions
    for Fred's "Fish Disks" 1-1000!  A new command, "Install database..."
    helps adding existing databases from CD-ROM.

REQUIREMENTS
    With Fish Disk Database (1.5MB), approximately 2.2MB of harddisk space
    is needed.  The program requires about 300K of memory to run, depending
    on the size of the database index files and some other factors.
    Kickstart V37 (2.04) is required; V38 (2.1) is required for localization.

COMPATIBILITY
    Tested with 68000 through 68040 CPUs, V37, V38, V39, and V40 system
    software, Picasso II graphics board, EGS Spectrum, and CyberGraphics
    (on Picasso.) Enforcer and Mungwall used during testing.

PRICE
    Shareware registration fee is $20(US) or DM30.  A registration site in
    Germany is available for European users.

                The NETHERLANDS

DESCRIPTION

        HTML-Heaven is a suite of _four_ programs intended to make the
        creation and maintenance of WWW (HTML) pages easy. The programs
        in the suite interface with your favorite editor (providing it
        supports text insertion via ARexx) to provide you with a very
        comfortable environment. Now inserting HTML commands is as simple
        as point and click. This is the upgrade from version 1.01 with a
        host of exciting new features.

NEW FEATURES

        Version 1.1 has all the features of version 1.01. Plus:

        * A new, very powerful ARexx script for TurboText 2.0. Thanks
          to Cletus Baker who wrote this gem.

        * An info requester giving the ARexx Hostname, the window's x and
          y position as well as width and height. Very useful in setting
          up your HTML-Heaven environment. (tooltypes etc.)

        * HTML-Wizard, This new addition to the suite is functionally
          the same as HTML-Genie, but it uses cycle gadgets instead of
          listview ones.

        * All four programs now have an ARexx host built-in.
          Many thanks to Michael Sinz for his SimpleRexx package that made
          adding the Arexx host to the suite indeed a far less intimidating
          task.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        HTML-Heaven requires:
        * Workbench 2.04 or above.
        * ARexx (bundled with Workbench 2.04 and above.)
        * Around 1MB of free memory.
        * About 300KB of floppy or harddisk space. (installing the entire
          suite and docs.)

        The registered version and it's special keyfile are *NOT* freely
        distributable.

        This suite of programs is copyright 1994 by Paul Kolenbrander.

OTHER

        To encourage users to register, (I'd like to get some return for
        all this effort I have put into creating the suite.) the freely
        distributable versions does not support ToolTypes/parameters and
        will not supply on-line help. Furthermore a 'reminder' requester
        appears on exiting any of the four programs comprising the suite.
        The unregistered versions will also not allow more than 5 ARexx
        commands per session.

TITLE

     InfraRexx
     (and InfraJoy hardware design)

VERSION

     1.5
     (InfraJoy version 3.1)

RELEASE DATE

     27-Mar-95

AUTHOR

     Leon Woestenberg (leon@stack.urc.tue.nl)
     Jeroen Steenblik (jeroens@stack.urc.tue.nl)

DESCRIPTION

     The InfraRexx software along with the InfraJoy hardware serve as
     an ARexx-Infrared interface, that adds the function of an infrared
     remote controller to your Amiga, and more.

     With this software and hardware you can:

       o Control external audio/video devices via ARexx commands.
       o Control Amiga programs via a common remote control unit.
       o Learn and edit new remote control infrared commands.

     For example you can control a moduleplayer via your compact
     disc player remote control unit. Or, control your video tape
     recorder via a graphic user interface or an ARexx script.

     The main features are:

       o Seperate editor (with learner) and ARexx host commodity.
       o Multitasking-friendly infrared sampling monitor, with very
         low system overhead during monitoring; can also be disabled.
       o Font-sensitive, style-compliant graphic user interface.
       o Supports localization under Workbench 2.1 (or better).
       o Uses 3.x functions and gadtools features if present.
       o Lowcost hardware for joystickport, with optional throughput.
       o Uses the Amiga Installer Utility to install onto (hard)disk.

NEW FEATURES

       o Added some user requested features. Removed reported bugs.
       o Swedish language catalog included.
       o Completer codesets. Added JVC codeset.
       o Included RexxEvent; links ARexx commands to input events.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

       InfraRexx needs at least AmigaOS version 2.04, and the commodity
       needs RexxMast to be running in order to be useful. The software
       is useless without the small InfraJoy hardware add-on, off which
       the design and full building instructions are included. The
       hardware can also be ordered from one of the authors.

AVAILABILITY

       ftp://ftp.doc.ic.ac.uk/pub/aminet/util/rexx/InfraRexx1_5.lha (119727)

PRICE

       Free. The optional registration fee is USD 10. The minimal required
       hardware costs about USD 8 if self-built, but can also be ordered
       for the amount of USD 17, which provides free registration and
       one free update.

TITLE

Final Writer Section Script

VERSION

1.1

AUTHOR

Jernej Pecjak
E-Mail: ffpecjak@uni-lj.si

DESCRIPTION

Note: Every version of this script has more and more options, not all
related to sections. After version 1.20 this script will change it's
name to Final Writer Professional Script 1.30. Just thought you should
know.

Adding new sections and deleting old ones in Final Writer does
unfortnately not work as I expected. When you add new section between
existing ones, all the graphics is moved to wrong sections. What this
script does is:

1. Implement a TRUE Add and Delete of sections
2. Implement a "copy"and "move" for sections from one place to another
3. Swap two sections in a document

NEW FEATURES

Changes since version 1.00:

NEW FEATURE! Added commands for working with master pages:

! Copy from left -> right or right -> left master page
! Move from left -> right or right -> left master page
! Copy between master pages of two sections
! Move between master pages of two sections
! Option to delete the destination master page when copying or moving
! Swap left and right master page (used to correct the `master page
  bug')

NEW FEATURE! Added a security requester for saving document before
making changes (this was already done in the evaluation version, but
not in the registered one)

BUG FIX! There was a nasty bug when adding and removing sections! All
the imported graphics was changed to SAVE GRAPHICS, even if you had
SAVE LINK enabled. On large documents this increased the document size
very much if you used the option SAVE LINK (most of us do). This is
now corrected

BUG FIX! Another bug when adding sections. If you used more than one
word or a word with special characters (., etc.), new section wasn't
created and the graphics were made wrong

IMPROVED FEATURE! Made corrections to this manual. I hope all of the
typing errors are also corrected by now :-)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

You must have Final Writer 1, 2 or 3

AVAILABILITY

     APlayer

VERSION

     1.21 ("APlayer works on OS2.0 again"-version :)

AUTHOR

     Thomas Neumann

DESCRIPTION

     The AccessiblePlayer is our contribution to the Amiga market of music
     players.  We thought that our favourite player (Smartplay) just wasn't
     good enough anymore, and since neither D.A.S.  Modplayer nor the
     Delitracker fulfilled our needs we decide to write our own player.

     We hope we have reached our goal by making a small, fast and user-
     friendly player, the AccessiblePlayer.

NEW FEATURES

     - Now works with OS2.0 again! There was some mistakes in version 1.20
       of APlayer. Delete that archive and use this version!

     - The  name of the active module is printed in the main windows
       titlebar if you zip the window.
     - Besides that only some minor bug fixes.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     AmigaOS 2.0 (or higher)

    GroupEditor

VERSION

    Version 1.01

AUTHOR

    Ben Vost.  email me at: Ben@subway.demon.co.uk

DESCRIPTION

    GroupEditor is a tool which uses any NNTP grouplist as a basis on which
    to create a new uulib:newsgroups list.  Simple, button-based and, most
    importantly, there is no typing needed.  GroupEditor also lets you set
    the number of days articles should be kept before being subjected to
    TrimNews.  You can also edit newsgroups lists apart from
    uulib:newsgroups (for AmiTCPHelper support).

NEW FEATURES

    New to version 1.01 are the following features:

     Multiple source and destination documents, general tidying up.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    None (apart from an Internet account :) ).  This tool is designed to
    allow the user to edit a local NNTP group list for use with offline
    news reading such as TIN.

AVAILABILITY

    GroupEditor is available on the Aminet in two versions.  One version is
    for people who don't have CanDo.library v 3.6 the other is for people
    who do have it:

PRICE

    GroupEditor is nominally shareware, although nothing has been disabled
    and there are no annoying requesters.  The fee is 10 UK Pounds.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

    GroupEditor is copyright Ben Vost 1995.  Its shareware fee is 10

DESCRIPTION

    AmigaBase is a powerful programmable database with its own graphical
    user interface.

    AmigaBase is not a relational database with SQL interface or something
    like this.  Nevertheless, or just because, AmigaBase is ideal for
    managing music cassettes, videos, addresses, etc.  Complex applications
    like a finance manager with automatic printing of transfer forms and
    writing client accounts is no problem for AmigaBase, too.

    AmigaBase knows of the following data types: BOOLEAN (boolean values),
    CHOICE (one item out of many items), INTEGER (integer values), REAL
    (floating point values), STRING (any text), DATE (date values), TIME
    (time values), and MEMO (unlimited multi line text).

    For more information see the ReadMe file in the archive.

NEW FEATURES

      o  Danish and French catalog file.
      o  New programming functions: Filename, Changes, ARexxPort,
         ChooseString, Now, StrCmp and ChoiceLabels.
      o  Improvements for file requesters.
      o  Many bug fixes and other improvements.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENYS

    1 MByte RAM, more recommended. 

AVAILABILITY

    AmigaBase V2.1 can be found on any aminet site, e.g.

TITLE

    AmiTCPHelper

VERSION

    Version 1.09

AUTHOR

    Ben Vost. email me at: Ben@subway.demon.co.uk

DESCRIPTION

    AmiTCPHelper is a button-based front end for Internet operations.  You
    can use it to link up, link down, read and send mail, FTP, browse the
    Web and use Gopher.  In addition to these features, you can also use
    Ping and Finger and synchronise your computer's clock to another
    machine.  AmiTCPHelper also lets you select between different
    newsgroups and also lets you edit important files without you having to
    go looking for them (ie.  your dialscript, datestamp, newsgroups,
    aliases, etc.).  AmiTCPHelper is very configurable letting you set its
    window position and what programs you want to use for all its features.

NEW FEATURES

    New to version 1.09 are the following features:

    Added startnet script editing in the Edit menu.  Added IRC and Prefs
    buttons to the interface which has been jiggled to fit the new buttons
    in without requiring more space.  The Prefs button doesn't work at the
    mo, but will eventually let you edit TCP-related ENV variables and the
    co-ordinates and size of the windows that AmiTCPHelper opens amongst
    other things.

    The Get News button now works!  Hurrah!

    Multiple mail folders.  If you have more than one mail folder,
    AmiTCPHelper asks which one you wish to enter.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    The only special requirement I can think of is the fact that you really
    need AmiTCP to use this tool, but just so you know, it has been tested
    on a PAL Amiga 3000T which PicassoII, 2MB Chip, 16MB Fast, blah, blah...

AVAILABILITY

    AmiTCPHelper is available on the Aminet in two versions.  One version
    is for people who don't have CanDo.library v 3.6 the other is for
    people who do have it (if you already have the library, then you can
    get the NoLb version):

PRICE

    AmiTCPHelper is nominally shareware, although nothing has been disabled

DISTRIBUTABILITY

    AmiTCPHelper is copyright Ben Vost 1995.  It's shareware fee is 10 UK

OTHER

    AmiTCPHelper was written (using CanDo) for use with Demon Internet
    Services dialup account facility but with a bit of tweaking it should
    work with any account provider.  Please send me details if you want
    AmiTCPHelper to work with a different account provider's setup.

DESCRIPTION

     MagicCX is the definite commodity/system enhancer for
     any Amiga running OS 2.x or better. It is a very
     powerful and flexible system. MagicCX is a multifunctional
     commodity/tool collection which is somehow unique as it does
     not contain all the functions offered, but has the main
     functions/features built into external modules, so that users
     may configure MagicCX to their needs. MagicCX is the successor
     of KCommodity, which was a multifunctional commodity/tool, too.
     The program offers a lot more functions than KCommodity. All
     of the functions known from KCommodity were put into MagicCX
     and were enhanced, of course.

     Some of the main features the program offers are:
     CycleToMenu, PhoneBill (Modem conntect monitoring with cost
     calculation), Screen/Window Grabber, AnalogClock, Calendar,
     Window manipulation functions of all sort (like cycling, activating,
     hunting for windows), Screen Blanker with Blanker/Dimmer and
     several external blanker modules, Mouse blanker, Screen Selector
     type facilities, ToolAlias, ARexx control, Titlebar clock, Function
     keys, Exploding Windows, Keystroke clicker, WBGauge, system wide
     String gadget enhancements, and much, much more.

             *** MagicCX is an SASG product ***

     - It incorporates many, many features known from
       other commodities/tools, while offering new, unseen
       features

     - External preferences program allows full control
       over MagicCX and all the functions.

     - It offers a special module design, known from
       Workbench. You may install/use modules/functions
       by simply dragging them to a Modules directory, if
       not used, move them to a storage directory.

     - Localized under OS 2.1 and up. English, German, French,
       Danish, and Swedish translations available

     - Compact system installation. Only a few files
       will be spread around your system. All others
       are kept in a single directory (Configurable)

     - Only basic functions (window activation and such)
       are built into the main program. The remaining
       features were put into external modules

     - MagicCX comes with 21 (for now) different modules
       you may choose from.

     - Flexible blanker system with two internal blankers
       and 20 (for now) external blanker modules

     - Utilizes powerful gadget layout library (gtlayout.library)

     - ...and much, much more

NEW FEATURES

     - 3 new powerful modules

     - 13 new blanker modules

     - plenty of fixes, enhancements, improvements

     - Actually too much to mention here, take a look at the
       history file, which is approximately 21KB in size, just
       mentioning changes from 1.0 to 1.1

     - MagicCX may be installed in "spread" mode now, so that
       you may specify suited locations for all the files

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     OS 2.x and up (Harddisk recommended but not needed)

DESCRIPTION

  PC-Task 3 is the first and only software 80286 emulator for the Amiga
  range of computers, allowing you to run MS-DOS sofftware, incuding MS
  Windows 3.11 (see below).

  The following features are included in this release:

  - Switchable 8086/80286 emulation
  - Support for up to 16MB RAM (15MB extended) of PC memory
  - Up to 2 floppy drives and 2 hard drives supported

  - Compatible with graphic boards (eg. EGS Spectrum, Picasso)
  - Parallel, Serial and PC speaker emulation
  - Mouse support, including Serial Mouse emulation
  - Run multiple PC-Task processes on the same machine
  - Run MS-DOS applications in a window on a public screen (eg. Workbench)
  - Transfer files between your Amiga and MS-DOS
  - Support for David Salamon's GoldenGate bridge cards
  - Compatible with MS Windows 3.0 - 3.11 *

  * MS Windows 3.1 requires 1.5 MB contiguous RAM and sufficient hard disk 
    space (around 10MB)

  NOTE:  Neither MS-DOS or MS Windows are included.

 About this Demo
 ---------------
  This  demo  has  been  released  to give you some idea of the speed and
  functionality  of  the  PC-Task  package.   You will not be able to run
  software that needs to write to disk (such as MS Windows, FDisk, Format
  etc.).   This  demonstration  version  is  a  generic  680x0 version of
  PC-Task  and  is  considerably  slower  than the full 68020_60 specific
  version.   We  estimate  that the demo is 25% slower on a 68020/30, 20%
  slower on a 68040 and very much slower on a 68060 (due to the 68060 not
  having one often used instruction inbuilt anymore).

  The  full  package  contains  the  following  features  which have been
  removed from this demo:

  - A comprehensive user reference manual
  - Writing to Floppy/HardDiskPartition/HardDiskFile enabled.
  - Parallel port emulation enabled.
  - Optimized version for 68020 and higher processors
  - Turbo Version (requires 4x RAM for speed increase)
  - The hardfile.device so you can use a Filesystem to access your PC-Task 
    or Bridgeboard HardDiskFile from AmigaDOS.
  - An MS-DOS program to copy files from AmigaDOS to PC-Task
  - An MS-DOS program to copy files from PC-Task to AmigaDOS
  - An MS-DOS program to show AmigaDOS directories under PC-Task
  - An MS-DOS program to quit PC-Task
  - An MS-DOS program to start the mouse driver
  - A CD-ROM driver allowing access to CD-ROMs under PC-Task's emulation

===========================================================================

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to jcompton@bbs.xnet.com and in the body of the
message ask nicely to be added to the list.

ie: Please add me to the mailing list for Amiga Report magazine.  My
     addresss is <your net address>.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!             **


          *** The following is only for Australian readers!  ***

To circumvent the new pay-per-megabyte system for Australian Internet
communication, Paul Reece has been kind enough to set up an AUSTRALIAN-ONLY
mailing list, to save his fellow countrymen some money.

You can join the list by sending mail to:   majordomo@info.tas.gov.au

with the single line (in body of message):

Amiga Report will then be bounced to you.

==                        UUDecoding Amiga Report                        ==
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

                The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
          -------------------------------------------------------

Portal is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-service online SIG
(Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users. We promise, and
WE DELIVER ongoing & aggressive Amiga support!

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in many ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA high-speed modems (you pay for the phone call
if it's not local), or though any SprintNet or Compu$erve indial anywhere
(with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell service!  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help, and you can easily customize
it for your favorite terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1000 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
      once, of any size, with one command.
 * Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, Elastic
      Reality (ASDG), Soft-Logik, Apex Publishing, and others.
 * 40 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 10,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.
 * Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
      related and get quick replies from the experts.
 * Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, AMosaic, LightWave, EGS,
      OpalVision & others feed right into the Zone message bases.  Read
      months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with them.
 * FREE unlimited Internet Email with 5 meg of free storage.
 * A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.
      You can run Amiga Mosaic through your shell and explore the
      vast World Wide Web!

      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine.
 * Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
      never worry "Ooops... Am I paying for this area?" again!
 * The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)  An 
      entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  And you get FREE unlimited
      usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
      email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
 * Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
      at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
