Notes From the Editor
By:  Jason Compton (jcompton@bbs.xnet.com)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We're back again!  The Coverdisk is still running, although I must admit
that interest seems to have tapered off a bit from the initial surge.
What did I do wrong?

At any rate, unless the masses start telling me I'm doing a rotten job of
providing some free software to readers of a free magazine, I'm going to
keep doing it.  Finally, this month, I've got the A64 demo.  It works 100%
but not for long (time-limit demo.)  Another item worth checking out is
UUxT, an incredibly good package for uuencoding/decoding, and the one I
use for AR and the disk.

There really isn't much news to report...a new flurry of rumors is
circulating, but since CEI's bid is being finalized TODAY and they don't
expect a decision for 4-6 weeks...things are likely not over yet.

Keep some faith.  It's better than losing control.

@node P2-1 "A64 Package V3.0 demo"

Feature:  A64 Package V3.0 demo by Questronix
---------------------------------------------

A fully-functional but time-limited version of the best 64 emulator on the
Amiga.  Definitely worth a shot, as it's considerably better than its
predecessors.

@endnode
@node P2-2 "GuidePrefs 1.0"
@toc "menu"

1.  AmigaGuide Writer 1.02 by David McPaul
------------------------------------------

Not a "writer" in the true sense of the word, but a utility that allows
text files to be Amiga-Guided with ease and/or power (depending on the
way you like to do this sort of thing.)

@endnode
@node P2-3 "ITF V1.55"
@toc "menu"

2.  ITF V1.55 by InfoTaskForce and David Kinder
-----------------------------------------------

An incredibly great program if you like Infocom games.  This interpreter
will allow you to play any Infocom game written in version 1-5 of the
Z-Code format (including everything but the graphic games, such as Arthur
or Shogun.  Beyond Zork DOES work, however).  There are even new games
being written for this format.  One game, the original Adventure, is
included.  Bear in mind that this program effectively allows Amiga users
access to the entire (budget-compiled) Infocom collection.  Volume 2
was never released for Amigans, but since this program reads the data
files, as long as you have CrossDOS, you can have the games.

@endnode
@node P2-4 "UUxT 3.0"
@toc "menu"

3. UUxT 3.0 by Asher Feldman
----------------------------

Feldman knows uuencoding and decoding.  This is a package with both
CLI and GUI versions, allowing easy translation of uu format files.
The encoder of choice for Amiga Report.

@endnode
@node P2-5 "NoReboot"
@toc "menu"

4.  NoReboot CD32 by Stuart MacKinnon
-------------------------------------

A short, simple program (with short, simple source) that allows a CD32
lid to be opened without resetting the machine.  Invaluable for anybody
using a CD32 as more than a game console.

@endnode
@node P4 "...in closing..."
@toc "menu"

                           ...in closing...

In closing, all I want you to do is have fun with the software and get
it out to other people who will have fun as well.  That's really what
this computer thing is all about, isn't it?

Another AR disk will be forthcoming.  Submissions and suggestions are
always welcome.
