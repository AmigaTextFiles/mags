> From the Editor's Desk                          "Saying it like it is!"
  ======================


The first point of business this evening is to once again remind people 
that there will be NO issue next week.  There WILL be one the following
week, though -- June 18th.  And two weeks after that, etc.  If you don't
like the fact that we're going ever other week, send me Email and tell me.
If you DO like it, send me Email and tell me.  I will weigh the number of
responses for each side and make a determination.  We may very well return
to a weekly state once Summer is over, but that remains to be seen.

Ever since GEnie announced its new pricing structure beginning July 1, there
has been a LOT of fuss.  People tell me they've been receiving unsolicited
Email on GEnie from angry users with a petition to attempt to make GEnie
change it's mind.  RELAX.  It won't work.  GEnie made this decision because
too many people were abusing the flat rate areas.  I don't mean the people
that necessarily read a lot of the GEnie*Basic bulletin boards, but rather
the people that LIVE there.  The people that make multiple passes each
night.  The people that hold conversations with dozens of people via Email,
to avoid the charges of attending one of the Value Services areas.  The
people that use Email to exchange files through UUENCODING.  These actions
are what is causing GEnie to slow to a crawl, and causing so many people
to complain.  The elimination of the flat rate entirely and adopting a
cheaper hourly rate will force this to stop.  If you manage your time wisely,
your bill should not change that much.  You don't have to read the former
GEnie*Basic BB's EVERY night.  Alternate nights, do it two or three times
a week.  Remember that the original goal of GEnie was to create a place for
users of similar computers to exchange information.  It was only after it
had grown that these new areas were opened.  One of the Amiga RT sysops
noted, "Something that gets me is how people over in the GEnius RT say,
'why should we be forced to subsidize the computer RT users??'"  It's
laughable.

If you're still convinced that GEnie has stabbed you in the back, there are
OTHER online services to consider:  Delphi and Portal just to name two.  I
think GEnie will become a much better place come July 1st.

TWO HACKERS GET SIX MONTHS IN JAIL IN UK

LONDON, ENGLAND -- Computer crime officers were quietly celebrating a
guilty conviction against two self-confessed hackers late last week,
as the pair were led down to the cells to begin their six month prison
sentences.

Neil Woods, 24, a computer science graduate and later computer salesman,
as well as University researcher Karl Strickland, 22, had pleaded guilty
to the charges and so became the first hackers to be jailed under the
Computer Misuse Act, 1990, in the UK.

Ironically, the pair were accused as part of the same investigation that
netted Paul Bedworth a few years ago. Bedworth, who pleased innocent on the
charges laid against him, went through a jury trial earlier this year that
ended up acquitting him. Woods and Strickland, however, because they had
pleaded guilty, were sentenced as a matter of course.

During a brief trial, the court heard how the pair caused an estimated
UKP123,000-worth of chaos while breaking into an estimated 10,000 on-line
systems around the world. The list of hacked system reads like a who's who
in the on-line world, ranging from NASA through to a European cancer research
organization.

No country was safe from the hackers' exploits. Systems in France, Germany,
Italy, and Sweden were hacked in Europe, along with systems in the US and
Canada, not to mention Russia, India, Singapore and Australia. The
prosecution said in court that the list read like an atlas, rather than a
list of offenses.

Woods and Strickland, who corresponded with other hackers, never met until
they were arrested. They were charged with conspiring to obtain telephone
services dishonestly over a two-year period, as well as publishing that
information on bulletin boards for other like-minded individuals to read.

Presiding over the case, Judge Michael Harris said that, while he accepted
their activities were not designed to cause damage, it was absolutely
essential that computer systems, which he described as playing an essential
role in 20th century life, be protected.

"If your passion had been cars rather than computers we would have called
your conduct delinquent, and I don't shrink from the analogy of describing
what you were doing as intellectual joyriding," he said.

"Computers now form a central role in our lives, containing personal details,
financial details, confidential matters of companies and government
departments and many business organizations. Some, providing emergency
services, depend on their computers to deliver those services," he added.

While Woods and Strickland pleaded guilty, Paul Bedworth, who was arrested
two years ago, did not. After pleading innocent on the grounds of computer
addiction, he was acquitted of the charges earlier this year.

Woods and Strickland are known to be members of a gang of four computer 
hackers known as the "eight-legged groove machine."  Two other people who
comprise the team are still at large, their identity not having been
discovered by Scotland Yard's computer crime division.

During the course of their exploits, the pair are known to have accessed a
variety of networks over BT's packet data networks, as well as the Joint
Academic Network (JANET). In court, the prosecution accessed European
Commission (EC) computers which led them into the accounts division of the
EC. One particular session led to the disruption of the main switching
computers on the Swedish telephone network in 1990.

To assist them in their exploits, the pair harnessed the power of mainframe
computers to make thousands of calls an hour on their behalf, repeatedly
battering login programs on other computers with tens of thousands of
passwords. This "blitz krieg" approach was necessary to gain access and
destroy security files before the system operators got back in the morning.

As a result of these efforts, the European Organization for the Research and
Treatment of Cancer received a UKP9,000 phone bill for around 50,000 calls
made by the scanner program.

Other networks accessed by the pair included classified military networks,
several banks, including Warburgs and Lloyds, as well as the Financial Times
Profile on-line service.

COMDEX:  DEC UNVEILS ALPHA AT LONG LAST

ATLANTA, GEORGIA -- After months of extensive previews -- and broad hints
on product pricing and positioning -- DEC finally announced here Tuesday
details of its plan to take the PC world by storm with its new range of
powerful personal computers based around the company's high-performance
Alpha 64-bit processor.

Pricing on the new range -- known as the DECpc AXP 150 -- starts at $6795 for
a "base" level machine that includes Windows NT 3.1, 16 megabytes (MB) of
RAM, a 14-inch SVGA color display, a 245 MB SCSI hard disk, the Alpha AXP
processor running at 150 megahertz (MHz) -- as well as the usual collection
of serial, mouse, parallel and keyboard interfaces.

While this price is a little more expensive than some analysts had predicted,
the machine looks to be far more compatible with PC standards than you would
expect from a non-Intel platform. It comes, for example, with a six-slot,
extended industry standard architecture (EISA) bus and a 3.5 inch floppy
disk drive -- so that you might not even know there was an Alpha processor
in the machine until after you switched it on.

The bad news is that DEC will not start shipping this machine until a final,
shrink-wrapped version of Windows NT is ready for the Alpha platform --
something that the industry should not expect until at least the end of 
August.

In the meantime, those really keen to get started using a Alpha system with
NT can buy the developer's configuration of the DECpc AXP 150, which includes
everything offered in the base level system, but adds an extra 16 Mb of 
memory, almost 200 Mb of hard disk space, a CD-ROM drive, a 16-inch 
(rather than 14-inch) display, an Ethernet adaptor card and a copy of Windows
NT Beta 2.0. This system is available immediately, sells for $9,995 and 
includes an automatic upgrade to the production version of Windows NT for
Alpha when it is ready.


                      ------------------------------


COMDEX:  ALPHA'S UNUSUAL FEATURES

ATLANTA, GEORGIA -- Digital Equipment Corporation's DECpc AXP/150, a
personal computer using the company's 64-bit Alpha AXP microprocessor,
and shipping to developers with a beta version of Windows NT as its
operating system, is an interesting machine, owing to its unusual
features.

The Alpha AXP/150 is unusual in three particulars. The first is its
microprocessor, a 64-bit Alpha AXP running at a screaming 150 megahertz
(MHz).

This is more than double the 66MHz top speed of competing microprocessors.
The Alpha chip is not Intel-compatible. The second unusual aspect is the
clock speed. The system bus runs at full speed, 150MHz. In fact, the system
clock is 300MHz, which is cut in half to pro vide timing for the micro-
processor and system bus. The fast bus speed should provide very fast access
to memory. Other peripherals will be accessed through extended industry
standard architecture (EISA) slots at 33MHz.

The third major differentiator is the operating system. The AXP/150 ships
with a beta version of Windows NT. It cannot run Windows or DOS directly,
though 16-bit DOS and Windows applications run under NT through an emulator.
The only 32-bit applications that will run are NT applications that have
been recompiled specifically for Alpha.

With these major exceptions, the AXP/150 is a regular high-end tower PC,
greatly resembling Intel-based PCs sold by DEC. It can support 16 to 128
megabytes (MB) of RAM, sports 512K of secondary cache, has a built-in SCSI
controller, and can support a hard drive up to 1G in size. Compaq QVision
SVGA graphics are standard, and four open EISA slots and three unused storage
bays are available.

Two serial ports, one parallel port, a keyboard, and a mouse are included. A
fully-configured developer version of the Alpha AXP running a beta version
of Windows NT as its operating system is available immediately for $9,995.

Purchasers will receive a free upgrade to the shipping version of NT when it
becomes available. A non-developer configuration will ship with the upcoming
release of Windows NT 3.1. This version will include 16M of RAM, a 14" SVGA
color monitor, and a 245M SCSI disk drive, and the operating system. This 
version will cost $6,795 from DEC Direct.

JAPAN - MITSUBISHI DEVELOPS 4-MEGABIT FLASH MEMORY

TOKYO, JAPAN, -- Mitsubishi Electric claims it has developed a powerful
and efficient 4-megabit flash memory, that is not only faster, but consumes
less electricity. The company is planning on applying this technology to
16-megabit flash memory.

Mitsubishi's latest flash memory operates at three-volts, and reads out data
at 50 nanoseconds. This is claimed to be considerably faster than existing
flash memory. Mitsubishi's flash memory is called DI-NOR-type, which is the
original chip of the firm.

The device takes advantage of two existing types of flash memories: NAND
(Not AND)-type and NOR (Not OR)-type.  NAND-type consumes less electricity
but it takes time to read out data. NOR-type can read out data faster but
it consumes more electricity.

Mitsubishi's DI-NOR-type consumes less electricity and can read out data 
quickly. The major reason for the improvements is that the device uses a
tunnel effect to deliver electrons to the cell when it reads and writes data.

Mitsubishi wants to test this 4-megabit flash memory further in order to
establish a quantity production method. Also, the firm intends to apply the
technology to 16-megabit and 64-megabit flash memory.

Flash memories can keep data even when switch is turned off. The device is
smaller than that of a DRAM. Also, it can read and write data, as well as
store a large amount of data. As a result, some analysts expect the
technology to replace hard disks in the future.

JAPAN - MATSUSHITA & HITACHI DEVELOP NEW CHIPS

TOKYO, JAPAN, -- Matsushita Electric has developed a digital neuro LSI
chip, which it claims will be able to handle text and pictorial data at
very high speeds. Meanwhile, Hitachi has developed a TRON-based 32-bit
microprocessor. TRON is considered by many as the national operating
system in Japan.

Matsushita Electric's digital neuro LSI is still a prototype, but it is
claimed to be capable of recognizing text data and graphic data with high
precision. This chip is based on Matsushita's original neuro model. It has
a learning feature and neural network capabilities.  The chip measures only
11 by 11 millimeters.

According to Matsushita's tests, the device can recognize hand-written
letters at a speed 10 time faster than existing chips. It can recognize
figures - both Kanji and alphabets. As far as alphabetical letters are
concerned, it is claimed that the system can recognize 1,600 letters per
second - almost 20 times faster than current chips.

Meanwhile, Hitachi has developed a TRON-based 32-bit microprocessor. It is
the high-end version of the firm's G-MICRO family, called the G-MICRO
H32/500. There two versions - one with a clock speed of 50 megahertz (MHz)
and the other with a clock speed of 66 MHz. The 66-MHz version consumes
only nine watts of electricity, but it can process data at 130 MIPS (million
instructions per second).

The release of the 50-MHz version is planned for this October, with the
66-MHz version planned for early 1994.

             COMMODORE LOSES $177.6 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER

NEW YORK (MAY 28) PR NEWSWIRE - Commodore International Limited (NYSE: CBU)
today reported a net loss of $177.6 million, or $5.37 per share on sales of
$120.9 million for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 1993. 

   This compares with earnings of $4.1 million, or $.12 per share on sales of
$194.6 million in the year-ago quarter. 

   For the nine months ended March 31, 1993 the net loss was $273.6 million,
or $8.27 per share compared with net income of $49.5 million, or $1.47 per
share in the same period of the prior year. Sales for the nine months were
$517.2 million compared with $770.3 million in the year-ago period. 

   Overall the sales decline of almost 40 percent for the quarter was
primarily due to prevailing economic softness in all of the Company's major
markets, especially Germany.  There was also significant pricing erosion for
the Company's older Amiga models and PC products.  Unit volume of Amiga
products declined 25 percent while Amiga revenues declined over 45 percent. 
PC unit volume increased 30 percent, but revenues increased only slightly
from the prior year.  C64 computer sales were nominal in the quarter. 

   The unit sales decline and severe pricing erosion during the quarter,
primarily in the month of March, had a substantial adverse effect on
profitability for the March quarter.  In light of this significantly changed
business environment, the Company reevaluated projected inventory values and
determined that writedowns of $65 million were required to reduce inventory,
including the older Amiga products, to current estimated net realizable value.
In addition, the Company made a provision of $70 million for special pricing
and promotional allowances, additional restructuring costs, and asset
writedowns. 

   Irving Gould, chairman and chief executive officer, stated:  "We are
extremely disappointed with our results for the first nine months of this
fiscal year.  We believe that Commodore's technology, brand name and
distribution network continue to have significant value and we are exerting
all of our efforts to restructure the company to take advantage of these
values during this period of severe difficulty." 

   Commodore International Limited through its subsidiaries around the world
is a manufacturer and marketer of computer-based products for professionals
and consumers.  The company's major product group is Amiga multimedia
computers.  In addition, the company has a range of PC compatible computers
and the entry level Commodore 64.

MICROBOTICS ANNOUNCES TRADE-UP PROGRAM FOR MBX1200 OWNERS

MicroBotics has announced a trade-up program for owners of its MBX1200 and
MBX1200z memory expansion boards for the Amiga 1200.  Under this program,
users may trade in their memory expansion boards for a discount on the new
1230XA 68030 accelerator.

Users are asked to call Darrin at MicroBotics if you have an MBX1200 that you
want to trade in.  You will get the registered user price PLUS an additional
$50 credit towards the XA purchase. We'll take your board and install your
existing math chip and RAM on the XA, thoroughly test it and ship the 1230XA
to you.

There  will be a detailed mailing on this to all registered USA and Canadian
owners. It is a little difficult to arrange to do this to Europe so at this
time the offer is limited to North America mostly because of customs barriers
and shipping costs.

MEMBLOCKER V1.1 AVAILABLE FOR FTP


NAME

  MemBlocker Version 1.1

INTRODUCTION

  MemBlocker blocks memory. You are able to allocate memory blocks of a
  specified size and release them later. This may be done from Workbench or
  CLI, Kick 37.175 (OS2.04) or greater is needed anyway.

WHY BLOCK MEMORY?

  Blocking memory is usefull for all those with different types of FAST-RAM,
  this is 32-bit and 16-bit ram. Many owners of accelerator cards and some
  other expansion memory have both of these types in their system. When you
  boot your system, the software or hardware of the accelerator assign the
  32-bit ram to the highest memory-priority. So nearly all of this 'fastest'
  RAM is used before the 16-bit ram is touched. When there is no more 32-bit
  RAM left you suddenly see a significant slowdown after starting a program
  in 16-bit ram. So one would like to save as much as possible of the 32-bit
  RAM for those programs that need 'fastest' memory.

  One the other hand, there are many programs that don't need 'fastest' RAM.
  Comodities, other utilities, diskcaches, buffers and more. Many of these are
  started in the startup-sequence, user-startup or wbstartup-drawer. This is
  where MemBlocker comes in: You block your precious 'fastest' 32-bit ram
  before launching those applications and release it afterwards. So the
  applications are forced to use the slower 16-bit RAM.

  But be careful what programs you force into slower RAM: devices, handlers,
  simply everything where speed is needed should get 'fastest' RAM.
  Another usage might be to shrink your availible memory for test purposes.

DISTRIBUTION

 MemBlocker may be freely distributed, as long as no charge is made other
 than to cover time and copying costs. The package must be distributed as
 the original archive. If you want to include MemBlocker as part of a 
 commercial package, contact the author listed below. Fred Fish is 
 specifically given permission to include MemBlocker in his fine disk 
 library. It is also allowed to put MemBlocker on free accessible BBS's
 or Internet sites.

MULTIPRINT V2.0 AVAILABLE FOR FTP


[ I've been thinking of renaming this newsgroup to ]
[ comp.sys.amiga.multiprint.          -Dan         ]

TITLE

     MultiPrint

VERSION

     2.00 27-May-1993

     This is an update to version 1.12 released on the
     13th of May 1993.

      Internet : tribble@gphs.vuw.ac.nz
         ( Irregular Monitoring )

DESCRIPTION

     MultiPrint is a program initially designed to print
     document files, and other text files, to as few sheets
     of paper as possible. It has since had other features
     such as bold/italic/font support, Compugraphic support,
     paragraph reformating and full justification added
     for improved flexability and readability.
     
     MultiPrint prints text files to multiple columns, on
     both sides of the sheet automatically, with no need
     to shuffle the pages.
     
     Pages are printed with a footer, with margins, page
     numbers, and with a gutter to allow easy stapling,
     or hole punching.

NEW FEATURES

     Version 2.00 fixes a few bugs that were found in the last
     released version, and adds a few significant features.

2.00 May 27, 1993
    Bugs Fixed :
      1. Big bug fixed for those out there using most printers other than
         Hewlett Packard compatible printers. Now, shouldn't print blank
         lines where bits of text should be.
      2. Fixed some small formatting problems.
      3. Fixed some other things, but I've forgotten what they were.
         Had had no serious messages about them though :-)
      4. Jumped version numbers, and changed to a trailing 0, to provide
         consistent numbering.
    Added Features :
      1. Modified Centering, so \C - returns you to the previous mode of
         justification. It is no longer necessary to remember when
         adding the codes to the files.
      2. Added 'This page intentionally left blank' :-)
      3. Added command line switches to turn off in-file formatting
         commands.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     MultiPrint requires 2.04 or higher.
     
     MultiPrint works best with page oriented printers, such
     as lasers and HP deskjets. A fast printer helps.

     MultiPrint provides better output with the use of
     Scalable fonts, and better italics/bold if you have a
     complete family (or more) of Scalable fonts.


HOST NAME

     This version can be found as MultiPrint18.lha on
     amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80), where I uploaded
     it in the new directory.
     
     You could also try wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4).
     
     In New Zealand, you can try kauri.vuw.ac.nz.


DIRECTORY

     Should end up in /pub/aminet/text/print, where the last
     version was put.

FILE NAMES

     MultiPrint200.lha, MultiPrint200.readme

PRICE

     MultiPrint is shareware, basically. If you find the
     program useful, or need anything added, and want to
     encourage me, a donation is welcome, but not
     essential.
     
     I would like to make enough money from MultiPrint to
     replace the Ink Cartridge I used most of in testing
     MultiPrint.
     
     Suggestion, US$20 or equivalent, NZ$ if you can get them.
     Any amount is fine though.
     
     Hey, here's ambition ... maybe I could make enough
     to buy a laser printer! :-)


DISTRIBUTABILITY

     Shareware. Distribute to whoever, but if you plan
     to include it in a magazine's cover disk, or anything
     like that - let me know first.
     
     No matter what, leave the documentation intact.

ARMYMINER V1.2 AVAILABLE FOR FTP

[ On the other hand, comp.sys.amiga.armyminer wouldn't ]
[ be bad, either....                                   ]
[                                     -Dan             ]

  Description:

    ArmyMiner is a logic board game where some of the squares
do contain bombs. When clicked, the bomb-free squares display
the number of bombs in their neighbourhood. The objective of
the game is for the user to mark all the squares having bombs
in a minimum of time. The game requires good concentration
and offers a very interesting mental challenge.

    There are many instances of that game on different
platforms (Minesweeper on IBM-compatible, XMines on XWindows,
etc). ArmyMiner integrates all of the good aspects I've
seen on all the versions of that game available on 
personal computers. Its options include:

  - Automatically mark or clean the neighbours of a square
  - Safe start (no explosion at first click)
  - Safe click (gadget-like behavior for squares)
  - Question marks (for configuration analysis)

  You can also specify your own custom board settings.
The game has a very useful pause option, sound effects,
high-score tables and a very nice interface. It works
on either OS v1.3 or 2.0, under NTSC or PAL.

  ArmyMiner is freeware, binary only. You are free
to use it as long as you leave my copyright notice intact.
You can distribute that program as long as you don't ask any
more money for it than a nominal fee for copying, and if you
keep the "ArmyMiner.doc" file with it. If you want to include
this program in a commercial package, you need my written
permission.

  "Copyright 1993 Alain Laferriere, All rights reserved"

  About release 1.2:

    This version of ArmyMiner is not executable-compressed.
This should please all the users that complained about it.
A bug has also been fixed with system fonts different than
"topaz 8". Also, you can now turn the pause on, by pressing
the 'p' key on the keyboard.

  ArmyMiner is currently available on the following FTP sites:

  Switz.  amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80)  pub/aminet/game/think
  Scand.  ftp.luth.se           (130.240.18.3)  pub/aminet/game/think

                     ANNOUNCING A MAILING LIST FOR
                    The AmigaE Programming Language

For the users of Wouter van Oortmerssen's AmigaE programming language,
and for those interested in this language, a mailing list is forming.

Topics of discussion will cover the full range of Amiga programming using
E, such as graphics, file handling, compiler questions, and more. This
is also the place to keep up on the latest AmigaE information, get news
about AmigaE releases, and find others who share your enthusiasm for
this wonderful new programming environment! And with Wouter van 
Oortmerssen as a member of this list, it's definitely the place to be
if you use AmigaE!

This list is managed by a person (me), not a listserv, so please keep
that in mind when addressing list administration problems. Also, for
now, I would like to ask all participants to resist the temptation to
post large uuencoded binaries to this list. We really must be considerate
of those down the line who may not have the disk space for such posts.

To join the AmigaE mailing list, send an e-mail message to
amigae-request@bkhouse.cts.com. Remember, this request is read by
a person, so you may ask other questions about the list, or ask to
be subscribed at an address differing from where you sent the 
message. I will read each of these, and I'll do my best to answer

From Denny Atkin (DENNYA) on PC upgradability...
 
JRS,

You only have one choice for a processor upgrade in most 486 machines: the
P24T "Pentium Jr.," which will (1) only have a 32-bit data path, compared to
the 64-bit path on the real Pentium, and (2) run at half-speed externally so
that it can function on a 33MHz motherboard.

Compare this to the Amiga's brilliant processor slot scheme (available on ALL
slotted Amigas, and retrofittable to all other Amigas except the A600), which
lets you use ANY processor.

You can upgrade your video, but not your video bus, in a PC. Big difference.
Current owners will be hosed as ISA-only owners are now once PCI takes over
from VESA as the standard late this year.

As for upgrading your Amiga video, you can purchase a number of high-res
graphics cards such as the Retina. You need drivers for higher resolutions,
but you do on the PC too.

A reply to Denny from C.FRANCESCHI...

 
DENNYA

>P24T "Pentium Jr

For the 486 Pentium upgrade whats the price???

The Compaq's Pentium is only $9000.00 list and has a 64bit motherboard kicks
out around 20mflops and 120 mips, sporting a "State of the Art Windows based
32bit OS (NExT Step) which can run MS Windows or DOS in a window with its
PCSoft." NOT VAPORWARE

NEC's Pentium uses a tandem cpu setup with 128-bit data paths showing around
220 mips of muscle and 40-something MFlops.  And can use the same 32-bit OS.
NOT VAPORWARE.

The new Mac supposedly better than twice the power of the Quadra 950 may
possibly be called the "Cyclone" is due mid July.

I've got a 3000T with an PP&S 35mhz Mercury and a ProRam3000 sporting 66 megs
of RAM.  A Firecracker24, ImageMaster9.52 and ADPro2.3. I'm having a hard time
keeping up with my competition in commercial image processing.
(ie.Quadra 950s with hardware cache and SGI indigo)

I've just returned my A4000 due to no significant improvement over my existing
setup.

I'm having a dificult time deciding whether to spend $5000.00 on a Visiona
135mhz graphics card, or a just couple thousand more for a Compaq Pentium.

Anyone that not living soley off thier computer, make at least $50,000.00 a
year from thier Image Processing skills, drive a decent car, and own thier
home need not reply.

More from Ty Liotta (T.LIOTTA) about the Toaster 4000...
 
Ok I have some more Toaster 4000 news. I have been running some speed tests
on the new Lightwave and there is something very wrong going on. Either the
Amiga 4000's 68040 is very slow, or something is going on with the new
Lightwave software. I am using as my benchmark, the "texture examples" scene
which comes with Lightwave. I am not saving the frame to disk, and am
rendering it in hi-res mode. On my system at home, I am running a beta version
of the new lightwave which is optimized for the 68040 and contains some of the
features as lightwave on the Toaster 4000. My home system is an amiga 2000 w/
a progressive zeus 68040 going 28mhz. Here's the deal. My home system renders
the image in 4 minutes 10 seconds. The A4000 with the 4000 Toaster renders it
in about 12 minutes!!!! Like I said there is something very wrong going on. We
are talking 3 times slower here! I don't know what this is due to, but would
really like to find out. Any ideas?

To other matters... I don't think the 3.0 software running in an Amiga
2000 will be able to do everything the 4000 Toaster is capable of doing in an
A4000. It is technically impossible. The new effects take heavy advantage of
the higher amount of colors on the A4000 to do much nicer wipes with 256
levels of transparency. The CG might be able to run the same on the A2000, but
this is debatable. You will certainly not be able to play back any Lightwave
animations in real time either because of no AGA chipset. These are all very
nice features, but it depends on how you use your Toaster to determine if they
are worthwile to plunk down a large chunk of change to completly redo your
system.


                      ------------------------------



From Robin Evans (R.EVANS6) about typical PC upgrade problems...

 
A company I used to work for bought hundreds of AST 286 machines at about the
same time I bought the accelerated 2000 that's humming beside me right now. I
talked to a tech who still works there the other day. He told me that they are
giving away those 286's right now because they've found they are worthless for
what they are planning to do with the new network at the firm.

Those machines will not run the current operating system standard, which --
for better or worse -- is Windows.

They can't replace the mother board -- not for a reasonable cost at least. And
they can't upgrade the machines with new processors. AST came out with a
machine which had a 'replaceable processor' slot, but did it just after all
those machines up there were installed. AST isn't offering them any sort of
discount or 'upgrade path' for buying newer machines.

This 2000 that I have is a much better computer today than those 286's which
were the standard back when I bought it. I could upgrade and tweak this thing
in ways that are unheard of for 286 owners.

Compared to Apple and the clone-makers, Commodore has done a better job of
making computers which have a long and useful life.

Subj: 4000/EC30 rumors

Hello Scott,

You opined :

SM> 1) Slow Expansion BUSSitus.  A programmed I/O 16 bit bus can only do so
much, and provides the CPU with a high load when running a lot of  data. Makes
for poor performance on things like video from a HD. 2)

There are faster and slower busses, not all equal, but in general yes.

SM> No Co-Processor to make a list of things to do, freeing the CPU to  just
do its job.  The Amiga, and most main-frames and minis have  this feature. It
makes multi-tasking a much more reasonable job.  3) A Processor that needs an
AS instruction for every register it  wants to save, and uses about 5 times
the number of cycles as a  68030/040 to task switch cannot hope to do
pre-emptive multi-tasking  at any reasonable rate.

Again I agree in general terms. I am a computer field engineer for the
last 23  years and have been ML programmning main/mini and PC chips for
most of  it so I am aware of the shortcomings of the Intel architectures.
I hated the 80XX on first exposure and still do. The register based I/O,
the need to  transfer blocks of data "in you pockets" from high memory,
the constant pushing of all the registers onto the stack and popping them
off to task  switch....a bummer for DEC or RCA1802 or 68000 users who are
used to  memory mapped I/O and table pointers and MMU's. It never fails to
astonish me when I reflect on the success of this Model-T architecture.

SM> My point is that no matter how good NT gets, the PC architecture is  too
limiting right now to allow faster operation of the important  things, like
I/O.  Even MC or EISA machines are no match for Zorro II  or III, and that
makes a big difference when running 4 or 5 serial  ports, or a fast hard drive
controller, or just playing a tune in the  background.

NT will be a Pentium counterpart. Also, MicroSoft wants to make versions of 
NT for even palmtop and laptops, obviously then they plan to make very
cut-down versions for slow machines as well as the topend version that runs
16mb mem and 100mb harddisk. Never underestimate your enemy if you want  to
win the war.

 SM>  TJ> The day of the proprietary O/S and proprietary hardware are
 SM>  TJ> coming to a close in the near future, and whether we love it or
 SM>  TJ> not the Amiga is both. 
 SM>
 SM> I think that proprietary OSes will soon be as insiginfigant as  different
layouts for remote controls on VCRs.  As long as two  machines can talk to
each other, and read each others DATA FORMATs,  no one will care too much
whether it runs the same OS.

But they do care, a lot. That is the reason Open Systems Foundation and many
other such groups keep getting formed. Unless they command so big a share of
their market that their proprietary O/S is a defacto standard (a feat even 
Big Blue is having trouble pulling off more and more these days) most companys
are giving at least lip service to open systems architectures and Unix.  They
hate it in their hearts because they make less money and can't lock the user
into paying for their software, but they have to laugh when the boss laughs
anyway and the boss is their customers.

I don't think data interchange is the only answer either. We already have lots
of cross-platform translation programs to let Amigas read PC or MAC data files
and some programs that can sort of read 1-2-3 files and DBIII files and
WordPerfect files. Most of them are always at least one revision behind the
current standard rev on the PC or MAC and require a lot of work to reinsert
the formating that got left behind etc. I don't think there are *any* programs
on the other two that will read any format created by Amiga specific programs
however, with the exception of IFF to GIF. It  will always be that way, a one
way street, unless you run the same O/S.

Who says NT has to be Intel based only, by the way? Why can't you believe that
Commodore would pay Microsoft to run an optimized 68060 version for Amiga
users? I guess that is pretty hard to believe actually. ;-)

Anyway that is how I see it.

Subj: A1200 Hack


                        The Amiga A1200: Inside & Out
                  Part 6   More Drive Stuff    May 21st 1993
             (C)1993 Silicon Synapse Electronics  & John Kamchen
    Stalker's Guild BBS (204)257-3751 23hrs DHST Wpg, Canada Fido 1:348/706

               Insert 'Not My Fault If It Goes KaBOOM' clause here.
  
                                 ---------

     Another one SO SOON?  Ok, here's the scoop.  Finally got rid of that
Toshiba 2.5" drive..  for $350, and got myself a 212mb Western Digital Caviar
(fish eggs?).  Man, is it FAST!  SysInfo reports 1,490,000 bytes a second
(compared to my 650,000 with the 2.5").

  When doing this hack, there are some real problems to consider.  I came
across these ones:


 1.  The mounting holes on the HD didn't QUITE line up with the holes in the
computer.  If I put the drive in like it should be (with the LED towards the
floppy slot) it sat about 4mm to far to the side (the fancy molding of the
drive slot got in the way).  By using the next mounting possibility (the drive
faced the same way, but was an inch or so closer to the middle of the
computer)
and that seemed OK, but is wasn't sitting at the correct angle.  Best thing is
to drill new holes in the plastic OR tape the sucker in place.

 2.  What to do with the floppy.  Best I can suggest is to buy a defective
A1010 (the Amiga external floppy).  Take the dead drive out, put your new one
in.  Assign DF0: to DF1: and hope for the best.  Can it be done?  maybe.
Another way to do this is remove the round cable from the external floppy
case,
and run DF0:'s ribbon cable inside.  Run the cable out of the rear hatch.

                               The (gulp) CABLE!

     I won't say its the worst soldering job I've had , but thank god I'm used
to this sort of thing.  I had a standard 'single' IDE cable, and 44pin 2.5"
IDE
cable.  Adding them together took a while.  You will need:
A fine tip soldering iron (NOT A WELLER 140W PIPE WELDER!)
Solder (duhh)
1 & 1/2  feet of small diameter heat shrink tubing, cut into 40  1cm lengths.

     On each cable, take off one end (watch pin 1 on that 2.5" cable).
On the 40 pin cable, pull a wire down one inch.  Take off 1/4in insulation.
On the 44 pin cable, pull a wire down 3/4 inch.  Strip the last 1/4in.
Place one tube of heat shrink on the 40 pin cable.
Twist the two wires together (make sure not to twist the insulation).
Place joint in the 'helping hands'.  Make sure shink tube isn't near joint.
Apply a small amount of solder to the twist.
Cut tip off twist joint, and fold back into 44pin cable side.
Slide shrink tubing over joint.  Friction should hold it there.
Procceed to next wire.

REPEAT 39 MORE TIMES

     Once your done, solder in the required power cable for your HD onto
the floppy's power cable.  (I made a whole new cable.  Remember, don't destroy
any original parts.

     When your done soldering, take a hair dryer to all your shink tubing
untill she be shrunked.

     You have an option at this point.  You can take those connectors you
pulled off before, and re-attach them to the morphed cable.  I don't see much
use adding the 2.5" connector, but the 3.5" might come in handy for a Slave
drive in the future.  Yer call.

     One thing to remember, that 90-ish degree angle bracket that was on the
floppy must be put back in place.. at the right angle.

     If I can borrow some kinda video sampler in the next while, I'll add some
pictures of this hack in the next installment.

NEXT TIME:  Who knows?  Adding a high density drive? (if I can afford one)

Subj: 1,638,400 color ECS?

I recently left a message asking about the possibilty of NEW
display modes (MEGA-MODES) on ALL amigas.

Example: There's a program available for the Atari ST/STE that
offers 6 new modes including 48 colors per scan line out of
4096 and even 19,200 colors out of 32,768! All on a stock 
Atari. Remember the ST/STE are limited to 4096 colors just
like the Amiga. So How was this 32,768 color pallette
achieved?

Shouldn't it be possible to have the following modes on ANY
AMIGA in 320x400 low-resolution?

Mega-32 - 32 "different" colors per scan line - simulating 12,800
Mega-64 - 64 "different" colors per scan line - simulating 24,600
Mega-HAM - 4096 "different" colors per scan line - simulating 1,638,400

With dyna-hires, the copper displays 16 different colors
per scan line. It's similar to having 400 16 color hi-res
pics opened on a single screen and each only occupying a
single scan line. 

I really don't know why this can't be done with 32 or 64
colors in Low-Res, perhaps EXTENDING the pallette beyond
4096!

What about Mega-Ham?
What about a seperate HAM pallette per scan line? As an
example, Imagine 400 different ham screens, each existing 
on a single scan line. Wouldn't this give you a simulated
1,638,400 colors? 

I may not be correct, But If A stock ST/STE's pallette
can be extended to 32,768 with software only, the Amiga
should be able to do better! 

Any responses to this or my other message would be
appreciated! ALL YOU TECH-WIZ's....... RESPOND!!!!

Subj: Amiga laptops

    Supposedly Commodore wants eventually to manufacture their own laptops
eventually.  But they have a couple of problems.  One is the current expense
of active matrix screens.  That is expected to improve over the next year or
so.  The second is the chip set which draws a lot of power, and does not do
well with current battery technology.  They apparently will have to redesign
the chips to improve the current usage, before they can manufacture a laptop. 
Anyone have any other info on this?  I am not sure what happened to the third
party laptop that was being advertised a year ago, but apparently C= pulled
the rug out from under them.  And as far as Commodore and it's technology and
trademarks - well we used to have a store here in San Antonio called Amiga
Video Plus.  It was a computer store that sold only Amiga products, and
specialized in video work, Toaster products, etc.  Commodore informed them
that Amiga was C='s trademark, and that they could not use it in their name. 
They changed the name to Amigo Video Plus.  But that is like a local car
retailer not being able to call itself Ancira Chevrolet, or something.  The
store eventually closed down - a loss to San Antonio.  Why does Commodore
shoot itself in the foot (and it's supporters through the heart)?

Subj: Re: 198,400 color ECS!

First off, low-res has only 320 pixels so you can't get 4096 colors per line,
second you couldn't do it anyway. Next you can't get a 198,000 mdoe eother as
the ECS has only 4096 shades!  At best you could continuously reload colors
throught the screen. The copper can only reset the color by every 4 pixels
within the line and about 32 before each line begins in lores. HAM would most
likely look better.
Espc. dynamic HAM at 320x400.
   On the AGA, an interesring thing might be to reload all 256 color registers
each line and then display 256x400 pictures, if the copper can handle
reloading 256 per line (which it might since the higher # colrrs wouldn't be
needed until aater along the scanline, you could get a true 24bit mode at
256x400. I'm not sure if AGA is fast enough and heard some odd thing about the
16.8 mil palette not setting in until the end of the line after a copper
command though

  Well, dont be too conserned about Motorola droping the 680x0 line.  Those
chips are used in a LOT more than Mac's and Amiga's.  And yea, it would be
damn stupid for Apple to stop making 680x0 macs cuz not only is the Power
PC chips slower than a 68060.  It also has to EMULATE a 680x0 to run Mac
software which will present an even biger slow down.  Anyway, from what I
have read, Motorola plans to keep building on the 680x0 line for a long
time.  Now then, on to Alphas.  Welll, I saw an Alpha workstation not to
long ago and it was decently impressive but I was FAR more impressed with
the SGI Crimson + Reality Engine.  Thats a bit of an unfair comparison tho
cuz the Reality Engine has 18 Intel I860's on it and the Alpha work station
was runing a single Alpha chip.
  Official word from C= is that they do have someone (it was either 1 or 2
hard ware engineers out of their 200 total) that is working on RISC based
Amigas.  But for the moment I think they are going to use the 68060 in the
high end 3rd generation machines.

> The Most Sincere Form Of Flattery:  Emulators of All Types
  ==========================================================
  By Robert Niles


The Amiga is quite a fantastic computer. Great graphics, stereo sound,
multitasking capabilites and such. But one thing that it can do and that most
people don't give a lot of thought to, is that it can emulate other
operating systems reasonably well.

As most of you know, Commodore sells various MS-DOS bridge boards. But I
wanted to take a look and see what other systems the Amiga is capable of
emulating, and what is required to do so. Here is a listing of all of the
platforms that I have found the Amiga capable of emulating and the name of
the hardware and or software needed to do so....from MS-DOS systems to the
GameBoy. The common names of all archive that are freely distributable 
are given within parenthesis, and are located at most ftp sites catering
to the Amiga, Delphi, and my BBS.

Niether Amiga Report, nor myself endorse in ANY way piracy of ANY kind.
In other words, if it is not in the Public Domain, purchase it! Some of 
these programs listed here may require all or part of a operating system

 The file I've found is called GAMEBOY.LHA and it looks like the GameBoy made
 by NinTenDo, except this has an interface to load games. Tetris comes with
 it. And the source to Tetris is available. Possibly giving one the chance
 to make more games.


While this listing is no where complete (especially in the MS-DOS section)
it should give you an idea of other systems in which you may be compatable
with. If you know of an operating system not listed here, let me know,
I will most certainly add it to a future edition of Amiga Report.

> Usenet Review:  QuickWrite v1.1
  ===============================
  By Mike Meyer
  (mvm@contessa.palo-alto.ca.us)


PRODUCT NAME

        QuickWrite version 1.1


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

        QuickWrite is an entry-level word processor.  It uses the Preferences
printer as an output device, limiting itself to the capabilities of that
output device.


COMPANY INFORMATION

        Name:           New Horizons Software
        Address:        206 Wild Basin Road, Suite 109
                        Austin, TX  78747
                        USA
        Telephone:      (512) 328-6650


LIST PRICE

        $75.00 (US).  Street price should be around $50.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE

                While a printer isn't required, the program has little use
                without it; one is "recommended".  Other than that, you need
                an Amiga with 512K of ram.  A second disk drive is
                recommended.  The software should work fine with all CPUs and
                graphics chip sets.

        SOFTWARE

                You must be running at least AmigaDOS 1.2, and it works fine
                with AmigaDOS through 3.0.


COPY PROTECTION

        None.  Installs on a hard disk.  The provided program disk is
bootable as a Workbench disk.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        I used QuickWrite regularly on an Amiga 3000 with 2 meg of Chip RAM
and 8 or 16 meg of Fast RAM, running various versions of AmigaDOS.


REVIEW

        If you have a printer that does acceptable character printing with
multiple type styles and lousy graphics -- or even no graphics -- you have
only a limited number of options to take advantage of that printer.  If you
have some graphics, you can use a DTP package, and get results that are
probably unacceptable.  You can use an editor that lets you insert binary
text, and put in the Preferences (or your printers) control codes to switch
type styles by hand.  This requires estimating formatting, and can make using
other tools difficult.  Finally, you can use QuickWrite.

        QuickWrite ("QW") is a "word processor" in the original sense of the
phrase.  It does not have desktop publishing functionality, multiple font
support, nor even proportional font support.  What it provides is convenient
access to many of the character features of the Preferences printer.  For
people who have a printer that has a number of such features, but doesn't
have the graphics support required for a true DTP package (this describes
pretty much any dot-matrix printer), QuickWrite is an excellent investment.

        You can start QW from either the CLI or the WorkBench, and it can
run on either the Workbench screen or a custom screen of the user's
choosing.  After being started, QW opens a window that will be familiar to
the users of most Amiga DTP or word processing packages.  Inside the standard
Intuition window borders you find a ruler with movable triangles that
control text wrapping, a tool bar for setting various options, and a couple
of scroll bars and arrows for moving around the document.

        The ruler gadgets control the left margin for the first line of a
paragraph, the left margin for the other lines in a paragraph, and the right
margin.  You also click on the ruler gadget to set tab stops.

        The tool bar has controls for setting the tab type (left, centered,
right or decimal-aligned), paragraph justification (left, center, right or
fully justified), line spacing (single or double), and optionally setting
paragraph spacing to include a line before or after each paragraph, or both.

        In addition, double-clicking on the ruler makes the tool bar vanish
or appear, and clicking on the tool bar outside the gadgets causes it to
vanish.

        In addition, there are three gadgets to the left of the horizontal
scroll bar at the bottom of the window.  Two are arrows that scroll through
the document page by page.  The third is a text button displaying the current
page.  Selecting it brings up the "Go To Page" requester.

        The Project menu is much as one would expect from an Amiga word
processing package, with commands to Save project, Save As, Open projects,
create a New project, Page Setup, Printing with and without a Merge, and
saving settings.  The entries that open file requesters open either a custom
requester that may include extra buttons, or under 2.0 or later, an ASL
requester that won't have the extra buttons.  A handy shortcut in the Print
options is Print One, which prints a single copy of the current document
using the current page setup.

        The Edit menu has the usual set of options ones expects in an Amiga
editor -- Cut, Copy, Paste and Erase.  After that comes a submenu allowing a
selection to be changed to UPPER, lower or Mixed case.  Another submenu
allows the insertion of non-text items of various kinds -- the Date or Time,
a Page Break or Page Number, or a non-breaking Space.  The Date or Time can
be either the current date or time, or the date or time when you print the
document.  You control the format of these items with the requester brought
up by the next entry.  There is also an entry for selecting all text in the
document, and entries that bring up requesters for editing preferences and
screen colors.

        The Search menu is fairly standard -- Find, Find Next, Change, Goto
Page, and a useful entry that takes you back to the current selection or
entry point.  The Format menu provides an alternative access to the
paragraph options available from the tool bar, the ability to set text style
(Plain, Underline, Bold, and combinations) and color.

        The Document menu controls some of what you see and edit.  You can
use it to edit the header and footer of the current document, or to show the
header and footer in the Document window.  The Layout entry brings up a
requester that allows you to specify the margins, for all pages or for the
title page.  This menu also holds the entry for manipulating the spelling
checker and gathering the usual document statistics: counts of various
things, average lengths of words and sentences, and a readability level.

        The View menu holds, for some reason, the About entry.  It also
allows you toggle the entire Ruler into and out of existence, and control
what units of measurement it uses.  You can also enable or disable the
showing of page guides and "invisible" characters.  Enabling this last
option causes whitespace characters to have unique non-character glyphs
displayed for each type of whitespace:  a feature I found very useful and
miss in other word processing packages.  At the bottom there is a selection
list of all open documents, allowing you to choose the active one from that
list.  Since there is a limit of 10 open documents, this menu will always
fit on the screen.

        Finally, there is the Macro menu, used for invoking REXX macros.
There are spaces for 10 macros, a requester that allows you to select ones
that are not on the menu, and an entry for customizing the entries.  It's as
flexible as most Amiga programs, and more so than some.

        QW takes better advantage of 2.0 features than other programs do.
For instance, it opens a public screen, making it easy to start other
applications on that screen.  KeyShow is a favorite of mine for accessing
characters via the ALT key.  Heavy WorkBench users may find the Application
Icon even more useful, as it lets you open projects by dropping their icons
onto it.

        The user interface is largely Amiga User Interface Style Guide
compliant.  Not completely -- some menu entries are in strange places, and
some shortcuts are rather odd.  For the most part, I found the interface
comfortable and easy to use.  The one problem is that redrawing the windows
-- especially on an 8-color screen -- was slow even on an A3000.  Turning on
the ruler and tool bar made it awful.  The rest of the program seems
reasonably snappy, though.

        As a word processor, QuickWrite does what it claims to do.  It
lets you format documents using a set of constant-width type styles as
supported by the Preferences printer driver.  It doesn't let you mix
type sizes -- going from condensed to elite, for instance -- in a
single document.  It is an entry-level package.  It gives you WYSIWYG
control of text, but you have to set it all yourself.  You can't define
a text style, nor change attributes of all text of one "style" with a
single command.   As such, it's perfectly adequate for letters or short
papers, but I'd hate to try doing anything very long with it.  It's
probably perfect for undergraduate use, but people doing a thesis or
dissertation will want something more powerful.

        If you decide you've outgrown this package, you can buy an
inexpensive upgrade to New Horizon's ProWrite DTP package.


DOCUMENTATION

        QuickWrite comes with a softbound, 76-page User's Manual.  It also
includes a 12-page pamphlet covering the differences between 1.0 and 1.1.
The documentation is for beginners and follows the process of creating and
printing a document, with the more esoteric features (ARexx, AmigaDOS 2.0
features) left for last.  It includes an acceptable index, and appendices
cover error messages and trouble shooting.  It's adequate, which is better
than much of the documentation one sees.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

        The ability to put meaningful names in the Rexx Macro menu is nice.
It would be nicer if that text weren't the name of the macro you're
running.  Date and time stamps that are the time of printing are very nice;
other packages should include this feature.  The time spent redrawing a
window -- even for an activation -- is inordinately long.  Support for
changing between the Preferences fonts in a single document would be nice,
but I can understand that this is a non-trivial undertaking.  Adding more
real DTP functionality -- style sheets, etc.  -- would also be nice, but is
also probably beyond the scope of this product.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        As far as I can tell, there really aren't any similar products
available.  There are some "text editors" that include part of this
functionality, and at least one module of a modular DTP package might be
considered similar.  Entry level DTP packages such as FinalCopy are
sometimes billed as word processors, but they include more functionality,
and require a better printer.  What QuickWrite reminds me of more than
anything else is the word processors -- WordStar, Magic Wand, etc.  -- that
were available a decade ago.  There is now a GUI, and it really is WYSIWYG,
but it provides much the same functionality.


BUGS

        While I found no bugs, I had a number of problems with third-party
printer drivers.  QuickWrite expects a lot from a printer driver; many
printer drivers don't deliver.  SuperDJC2, a PD Brother HR printer driver,
and the GPFax printer driver all failed in one way or another.

        Also, the product doesn't work with SoftWood's Proper Grammar,
neither I nor II.


VENDOR SUPPORT

        In chasing down the problems with the printer driver, I talked with
the tech support group.  They were knowledgeable, courteous, and provided
quick and accurate responses to my questions.


CONCLUSIONS

        I'd say the product is excellent for what it is intended to do.  It
isn't a DTP package; it's a small word processor for use with character
printers.  I'd recommend it without qualms to anyone looking for a program
for doing short documents on a printer with poor or non-existent graphics
capabilities.

> What is JPEG Compression?  AR InfoFile
  ======================================


   EVERYTHING YOU NEVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT JPEG AND THEREFORE DIDN'T ASK
  


Who are those      JPEG stands for the "Joint Photographic Experts Group."
JPEG guys?         This is a group of experts who defined a standard
                   compression scheme for still images, commonly called JPEG
                   Compression.

Overview           JPEG Compression consists of a series of reasonably complex
                   mathematical operations.  These include:  color space con-
                   version, discrete cosine transforms, quantization, and
                   entropy coding.  After these steps you end up with an image
                   which takes fewer bits to store than you started out with.

                   However, when you decompress a JPEG compressed image, you
                   end up with an image that is not quite the same as the
                   original  (which is why JPEG Compression is referred to as
                   "lossy").

 Is lossy          You might well ask why anyone would want to compress an
 compression bad?  image using a lossy technique.  Compression ratios for
                   lossy compression are much better than for lossless com-
                   ression and the loss is generally very small.  And, in
                   fact, every operation of converting an image is lossy (the
                   original photographic or electronic process which captured
                   the image was lossy, scanning or digitizing the image was
                   lossy, displaying the image on a monitor is lossy, and
                   printing the image is lossy).


Details            JPEG compression involves the following steps:

           Step 1  The image is converted to a color space with separate lum-
                   inance and chrominance channels.  This is done because the
                   human eye is far more sensitive to the luminance in-
                   formation (Y) than it is to the chrominance information (Cb
                   and Cr); by separating them, it's possible to compress the
                   chrominance information more than the luminance before the
                   perceived image quality suffers.

                   This step isn't specified in the JPEG draft (it doesn't
                   discuss color space at all), but is standard practice.

           Step 2  The luminance and chrominance information are separately
                   transformed to the frequency domain using a discrete cosine
                   transform acting on 8x8 pixel blocks.

                   To reduce the amount of data which needs to be compressed
                   the chrominance information may be sub-sampled first.

           Step 3  The transformed data is quantized (so some information is
                   thrown away).  The samples representing higher frequencies
                   are generally quantized using larger steps than those rep-
                   esenting low frequencies.

                   The quality level you specify is used to scale a set of
                   quantization values which have been found to cause the
                   quantized data to all have approximately equal importance
                   visually.  A lower quality number will cause larger quan-
                   tization steps to be used, and hence increase the com-
                   pression ratio and decrease the image quality.

           Step 4  The quantized data is compressed using an entropy coder.
                   Huffman and Arithmetic coding are allowed by the draft JPEG
                   standard; only Huffman coding is allowed by the JFIF
                   standard.  Huffman coding can either be done with a set of
                   fixed tables or custom tables can be generated for an
                   image.

JPEG Interchange   This data corresponds to the JPEG Interchange Format and is
Format             ready to be stored in a file.  Unfortunately the JPEG
                   Interchange Format does not include enough information to
                   actually be able to convert the file back to an image.
                   Specifically, the color space used and the aspect ratio or
                   resolution of the image are not included.  Until recently
                   there was no standard way of putting this information in a
                   JPEG file.

JFIF               On March 1, 1991 representatives of several JPEG hardware
                   and software developers (including C-Cube, Radius, NeXT,
                   Storm Tech, the PD JPEG group, and Sun) met at C-Cube and
                   established the JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF).

> Another Moronic, Inane and Gratuitous Article
  =============================================
  by Chad Freeman
  (cjfst4+@pitt.edu or cjfst4@cislabs.pitt.edu -- Internet)
  (cfreeman -- BIX)


First off this week I'd like to let everyone know about an exciting new
product coming in the next few months for the Amiga.  Its the Hair Toaster
4000 by BubbaDrec.  Just look at these exciting features!

    o Have a haircut just like the Prez!

    o Tie up airport runways for hours on end!

    o Have YOUR personal life exploited, distorted and yes, even extorted by 
      the media!

    o Have political wanna-be's who look like that guy from Tyson Chicken
      talk about how much less they paid for their haircut (and doesn't he
      have about $190 less hair, anyway)!

    o All this for only $200! (Styling unit extra)

I have been beta-testing this unit for a few weeks now, and it's amazing! 
While the first few versions did some pretty strange things to my hair (one
version shaved 'Limbaugh for Chief of Sanitation' in my head), I'm now 
sporting a du like the prez (well, maybe not; well, maybe; well, maybe not).  
Watch for it and for BubbaDrec's next amazing project, the Bikini Line Juicer 
(BubbaDrec wants you to know they're looking for alpha-testers, and a special 
arrangement with LLoyds of London for certain delicate parts is included).

But on to other things.  I've heard through the rumor mill that Mr. Dionne
(currently in the revolving president's chair at Commodore, for those of you
who haven't checked in the past couple of days) is actually attempting to take
his job seriously.  He even suggested hocking that gold C-64 they have up 
there in West Chester for some spending capital in the advertising budget. 
And speaking of advertising (for those of you who missed it, a subtle segue
has just occured), I'd like to share with you, my adoring public, my own
personal (and really nifty, if you ask me)...

    TOP 5 IDEAS FOR COMMODORE'S AMIGA AD CAMPAIGNS
    (hey, this ain't no big-budget show, y'know)

    # 5:  Buy an Amiga now, and you get to squish that annoying Amigaman
          with your foot!

    # 4:  Amiga:  We can make it look like it fills your minority quotas!

    # 3:  Now a free toy suprise inside of every Amiga box!

    # 2:  Amiga, cause who wants a computer that nerdy Bill Gates guy likes?

    And my number one idea is...

    # 1:  Amiga, our ads suck because we're too busy making great computers!

'Well well,' you might be saying to yourself, 'aren't we being a little
Barrett-like in these columns, Mr. Freeman?'  Well, you're quite right,
although I can be quite sarcastic, sardonic, and somewhat supercilious
sometimes.  I hereby devote the next paragraph of this article to praising
Commodore for what I think is the best piece of equipment they ever came out
with.

When I first saw the Commodore joystick, I thought 'this sure don't look
like an Atari joystick!'  And indeed it doesn't!  It was white and black (to
match the VIC-20 color scheme, I suppose), shaped like a rectangle held
longwise with a downward slope at the top, that sloped bit containing
a big red cheap plastic oval of a button, right in the middle so it
could be used lefty and righty (I always thought it was too bad I had
grown up using an Atari stick and thus doomed myself forever to righty
sticking, even though I've had now two things (joystick and Lynx) that
are ambidextrous).  The stick itself wasn't a circular cylinder like
Atari's, but a triangular one, and it had that black rubber stuff that
was just soft enough you couldn't resist chewing on the top while
playing great games like Gateway to Apshai.  It had a 'short throw,'
and it once you hooked that baby in the crook of your thumb, you just
didn't let go.  These things lasted forever; certainly much longer
than any Atari stick I knew of.  I have to give my highest rating, 5
feet above sea level, to this mechanical marvel (no longer in production) 
from Commodore Business Machines International Incorporated Limited TM BM
SM M&M, partners in law.
                                                        
Well, lets see, we've done two lists, two reviews, got in some barbs at Jim
Dionne and Commodore, and at least five jabs at various political figures.  
Well, I'm all tuckered out, how about you folks?  But before we go, the joke 
of the week!

    Q. How many Commodore advertising people does it take to screw in a
       lightbulb?

    A. None; they sit in the dark until someone from engineering does it! 

So, adieu and adios (the author says, trying to inject class into a very tacky 
article), and I'll see you next biweek with another exciting installment of 
A.M.I.G.A: The second most widely read column in my house (the horoscope won 
again!).

> About the Internet
  ==================
  By Robert Niles


As everyone is reading about, or learning about the InterNet, getting access
to it sometimes is difficult, or at times kind of expensive. While there are
quite a few places where you can log onto the internet, these places are quite
busy, or hard to manuever in. Especially when all you want to do is send an
Email message through the InterNet.

More and more people are on the InterNet nowadays, and email addresses are
listed in magazines, documents for ShareWare and Public Domain programs, and
personal InterNet addresses are often displayed in the FidoNet echos.

Not so well known is the fact that if you have access to a BBS that is
connected to FidoNet and makes available to their users NetMail, you also have
the ability to send and receive InterNet email. The ability to send NetMail
messages is the most important point here. Many SysOps don't give their users
this capability, some may charge a small fee for it, as a NetMail message MOST
of the time costs the SysOp of that BBS a little extra money. But for those
who do, sending and receiving InterNet mail through FidoNet is quite easy.

First of all you need to know the address in which to send the message to.
NetMail needs a FidoNet address in which to send the message to. And to send a
message from FidoNet to someone on the InterNet you must know of a place in
which acts as a "gateway" between the two networks.

FidoNet has a listing of all the BBSs within a file called the NODELIST, and
each BBS has certain "flags" that describe what that system can do. A
FidoNet/InterNet "gateway" is marked by the flag of "GUUCP" (Ask your SysOp
for more information on which systems carry a "GUUCP" flag). All you have to
do is send your NetMail message there using a little different format than
usual. One such system that acts as a "gateway" is 'Bink of an Eye'. His
FidoNet address being 1:105/42.

Now with sending a message to someone on the InterNet. Say for example you
know the address of a programmer, and his address is "nuthead@gorki.com"
(this is just an example, do not try to send anything there). Send a message
to him by doing the following (all prompts displayed by a BBS will be in
brackets, these will not always look the same for every BBS, but will be quite
similar):

[Address:] 1:105/42
[To:] UUCP
[Subject:] Anything you want here.

-------------------
To: nuthead@gorki.com

The message you want to enter goes here...type whatever you want.

-------------------

When the BBS asks you for the FidoNet address, just enter 1:105/42 (or
whatever address you prefer and carries the "GUUCP" flag).

Where it asks you who you want the message to go to type "UUCP" this lets the 
system know that the message is to be sent out to the InterNet.

On the subject line, just type whatever you want, just like you normally would
with any message.

Now this is important...one the first line where you would normally start
typing in your message you need to tell them to whom and where the message is
going to. Just enter "To:", a space and then the name/address combination (ie: 
nuthead@gorki.com).

Make sure there is at least ONE blank line between the InterNet address and
the message that you are actually sending. 


Anyone who can receive NetMail, can also receive messages from anyone on the
InterNet. Your InterNet address is based on the name you are using on the BBS
receiving the message, and the receiving BBS's FidoNet address. My FidoNet
address is 1:3407/104 and my name I use on my BBS is "Robert Niles". 

The "1" in the FidoNet address is the zone in which the BBS is in.
The "3407" is the net that the BBS is in, and
the "104" is the node.

Your InterNet is just a combination of the two added together and a postfix
so that the InterNet sends this to a FidoNet "gateway". For example:

firstname.lastname@F[node].N[net].Z[zone].fidonet.org

This is all case insensitive. The "node", "net", and "zone" that are in
brackets are to be replaced by your FidoNet address. My InterNet address
would be based on the FidoNet address of "1:3407/104" and come out as:

robert.niles@f104.n3407.z1.fidonet.org

Notice, the zone, net, node is backwards in the InterNet address as opposed to
the FidoNet address, and remember, your name listed in your Internet address
MUST be the same as what the BBS you plan on receiving this message on has you
listed.

OK...now you're ready to send and receive messages through the InterNet. Talk
with your SysOp if you don't have NetMail access, I'm sure he'll work
something out with you somehow. This system is a bit slower than having true
InterNet mail access, but for those who, for some reason or another, don't
have InterNet access, this should give you another alternative to getting
your message out.

> Fred Fish Announces More Disks!  AR InfoFile
  ============================================
  (Reprinted from Comp.Sys.Amiga.Announce)


Disks 841-860 have been available for some time, but I was lazy and never
got around to posting the announcement.  :-)

Disks 861-870 are now available.  Shipping to all those who have preordered
disks should be complete by 24-May-93.

Note that you can get a copy of the catalog (2 disks) of the complete library
contents by sending $3 for disks, postage, and mailer to:

        Fred Fish
        Catalog Disk Requests
        1835 East Belmont Drive
        Tempe, Arizona  85284
        USA

Thanks to all who submitted new and interesting material.  If you submitted
something in the past and it has not yet appeared in the library, please
feel free to resubmit it, particularly if it was several months ago.  I
sometimes hesitate to include material submitted more than about six
months ago because of some vague feeling that as soon as I include version
1.01 submitted many months ago, I'll see version 5.23 posted on usenet.

For those wishing to submit material for possible inclusion in the library,
here are a few simple guidelines that will make my job of organizing the
material MUCH easier and GREATLY increase your chances of having the material
accepted for inclusion:

1.      Don't submit bootable disks or disks with any other sort of
        proprietary material included, since I then have to go examine
        each file to decide if it is distributable or not, and if not,
        what effect removing it might have.  Unless the material is
        particularly interesting, I frequently just toss such disks
        into the recycling bin.

2.      Organize the distribution in a manner similar to my disks.  I.E,
        place all files related to a particular submission under a single
        directory on the disk.  If there is more than one submission per
        disk, place each submission in its own directory.

3.      Try to write a simple entry for my "Contents" listing that
        summarizes your submission.  It should be about 3-10 lines, and
        include the current version number, the version and disk number
        of the most recent version (if any) that was last included in the
        library, whether or not source is included, and an "Author" list.

4.      Ensure that your submission will run correctly from its sub-
        directory and if necessary, supply a script runnable from workbench
        (via :c/xicon or c:iconx) that makes all necessary assigns, copies
        fonts and libraries, etc.

5.      Send your submission in a sturdy envelope with sufficient padding.

                                   Thanks!!!

UDraw           A drafting tool that is bitmap oriented rather than object
                oriented.  The original intent with UDraw was to provide 
                a mechanism for the rapid drawing of schematic diagrams.
                However, UDraw has applications beyond this original intent.
                Makes heavy use of "clip boards", files which contain clips
                of various items that are displayed simultaneously but behind
                the work area, parts of which can be lifted off and pasted to
                the working screen.  Version 1.0, binary only.

                number of "cruncher" types.  CFX can also give in-depth dis-
                assemblies of crunched files, including most address crunched
                files, relocator crunched files, and some major archive crun-

PC-TaskDemo     PC-Task is a software IBM-PC emulator.  It allows you to run
                the majority of IBM-PC software on your amiga with no
                additional hardware.  Runs just like a normal application
                allowing multitasking to continue.  The program has a
                graphical user interface and no additional filesystem/device
                mounting is required.  A few clicks with the mouse and it is
                operational.  VGA, EGA, CGA, MDA, Serial, Parallel, Mouse,
                2 Floppy drives and 2 Hard drives are emulated.  The hard
                drives can be partitions or hard drive files like the

Xerox4045       A printer driver for printers supporting the Xerox 2700
                command set.  The 4045 (a hulking 8 PPM laser unit), is
                probably the most popular member of this family, so it got
                the name.  The focus of this version was to get the dot
                graphic functions working.  This appears to be working
                correctly as printing from Professional Page V2.1 and Tax
                Break have been successful in 300X300 graphics mode.

                is to let the user choose a task, swap it to disk so that its
                occupied memory is released, and do other things.  Later on,
                he could swap the program back to main memory and let it
                continue from the point it was interrupted.  Includes source
                in C and assembly.

> Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users
  ======================================



                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA or through Tymnet from anywhere in
North America.  If you have an account on another Internet-connected system, 
you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet programs, from anywhere 
in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users can now Telnet into
Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 - Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files, online, 24 hours a day.
   Portal has dedicated a 2.5 GIGabyte disk drive to the Amiga Zone.
   We have virtually unlimited space for files and new uploads. 

 - The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable
   software, online.  All of it.  Every disk.  Well-organized so
   it's easy to find exactly what you're after.

 - Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

 - Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES,
   and many others including Compute's Amiga Resource with over
   4 Megabytes of exclusive Compute magazine disk stuff you won't find
   elsewhere.

 - 35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.  Since Portal has FTP connections we can get
   new freely-distributable software online within MINUTES of its 
   being announced on Usenet.

 - No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.  Start downloading
   files with your first session on Portal. 

 - Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.
   Instead of stumbling around in frustration you can talk to the
   people who design your hardware, who write your software.

 - Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

 - Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

 - FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
 - Portal has the Usenet.  Tthousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  Usenet feeds into Portal many times each hour.
   There are 14 Amiga-specific Usenet newsgroups with hundreds of
   articles posted every day, including postings by Commodore 
   personnel.  Since Usenet is distributed worldwide, your questions
   and answers can be seen by literally hundreds of thousands of
   people the same day you post them.  

 - Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

 - The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
 - Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
 - All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

 - Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
   automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

 - And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well.. it's true.

  UNIX "telnet" program from an account you may already
  have on an Internet-connected system.

# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Tymnet 9600bps services is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.

representative, "The Amiga Zone sent me!"
