Where to begin?

Remember all the talk about "The Chinese" and the "Chinese Amiga rights"?
It's back again.

Lotus Pacific announced that it had purchased the Sino-Chinese Amiga rights
from Rightiming, who apparently bought those rights from Escom.  The
development of the WonderTV Amiga-based computer was announced.

But Gateway now disputes Lotus Pacific's ability to buy or Rightiming's
ability to sell that license.  They claim that they hold the worldwide
rights to the Amiga.

And for the public, that's about all we know.  Both the purported Chinese
deal and Gateway's purchase of the Amiga were closed transactions, meaning
we have nothing to go on but this "he-said-she-said" argument.  We cannot
check into the durability of Rightiming's claim on the rights, nor on
Gateway's claim that their purchase extends throughout the globe.

So it shall be, it seems, until one of them says something else.

There's an extra wrinkle here in that shortly after the Lotus
Pacific/Rightiming announcement, some of my colleagues did some research
and have a pretty good indication that LP and Rightiming are for all
intents and purposes the same company.  So this may be a very paper move
indeed.

Remember that promised HTML issue?  Sorry, but it's been pushed back one
more month.  Just to show that we haven't COMPLETELY forgotten about it, a
very bare prototype of the upcoming HTML title page has been included.  I'm
leaving for a trip today so waiting on the release of the issue would have
taken up more time than I'm comfortable with.  Again, sorry for the delay.

The next few months should be interesting ones, as we enter the autumn
Amiga expo season.  Some companies have some interesting promises coming
up.  A French company, Ateo, claims to have a new custom-busboard with a
graphics card forthcoming for the A1200.  We'll see what the future brings.

We're hoping to have a good stock of software and hardware lined up for
review next issue, so stay tuned.

Jason

PS: Be sure to check out the @{"Reader Mail" link MAIL} section this issue.  Lots of good
stuff in there, including a letter from one of AR's founders!

The Amiga Informer is about to release our biggest and best issue to 
date. Due out approximately June 18, you will find issue 8 crammed 
with important and detailed articles, information and reviews. All the 
Informer's staff and writers are passionate Amiga users. We use only 
Amigas to create The Informer and we use them to fill all our 
computing needs, providing us with a true insight to the platform.

The Amiga Informer is currently a mail order, subscription based 
publication. You will not find us at your local newsstand. However, 
this fact allows us to keep our prices down for both our readers and 
advertisers. This also allows us to give our subscribers personal 
attention when in comes to processing subscriptions and answering 
questions.

>From time to time you may find a sample issue of The Informer 
enclosed with one of your Amiga purchases or see a copy at your 
user group meeting. While we do send out some complimentary 
issues, they do not provide you with all the benefits that a 
subscription would bring.

As a subscriber, you can place free classified ads for your used 
Amiga products in each issue. This offers a good way to directly 
reach thousands of Amiga users who want that item you just aren't 
using anymore. Perhaps you are looking to find an elusive Amiga 
product. Placing a wanted to buy ad in The Informer just might find it 
for you. It is difficult at best to sell a used Amiga product in your local 
newspaper­and it costs you money. In The Informer, your items are 
seen by an Amiga-specific audience. Therefore, you can sell them 
quickly, and probably pay for your subscription in the process.

If you are a subscriber with an email address, you will automatically 
receive the Amiga Update Newsletter direct to your email box. Amiga 
Update is produced by Brad Webb. Through a special arrangement 
with The Informer, you will get all the latest announcements, press 
reports, rumors and news at least twice a month with Amiga Update. 
This info is fresh and direct from the horse's mouth. No need to hunt 
or wait for the latest info­it's sent directly to you with Amiga Update. 

Subscribers also receive discounts from Liage International. Through 
an arrangement with Liage, we are able to offer our subscribers a 
10% discount on all orders. While some might think Liage is just a 
game reseller, the facts are different. They carry not only a full line of 
popular games, but many educational and instructional titles, as well 
as a full line of CD-ROM titles.

And if that isn't plenty already, The Informer is also working hard to 
bring you more benefits. We expect to soon have an arrangement 
worked out with a well know authorized Amiga repair company that 
will give our subscribers discounts on selected repairs. Likewise, we 
will periodically be able to offer our subscribers special limited time 
discounts on popular software titles. These discounts are made 
possible by software developers or distributors who sometimes offer 
promotional deals on their products, and we want our subscribers to 
have a chance at these special savings.

If you would like to become a subscriber to The Amiga Informer, now 
is the perfect time. We offer a No Risk, No Obligation Guarantee to 
try us out. You will receive a bill with your first issue, but if you're not 
completely satisfied, just write CANCEL on the bill and return it. If 
you decide not to subscribe, the first issue is yours to keep and you 
will owe us nothing.

Simply call (914) 566-4665 to subscribe by VISA or MC. If you want
to test us out first, call and request to be billed with your first
issue. Or if you prefer, you can visit our website at
www.amigainformer.com to fill out the On-line Subscription
Form to take advantage of the No Risk Guarantee offer.

The Informer is devoted to bringing you an accurate and reliable 
resource of Amiga information. So if you're still not convinced, 
request that we send you a bill with our No Risk, No Obligation
Guarantee, and find out for yourself.

From: Micah Thompson (micah@kxan.com)

Hello!

Just though I'd drop you a line to say "How's it going?"

You don't know me, but Rob Glover, and myself, created Amiga Report
magazine years ago, when he was my roomate! 

I didn't even know it still existed, so you can understand my surprise when
I was surfing the web and found it! 

Unfortunately, we both have strayed from the Amiga due to business
requirements, but we both still harbor a deep love for the machine, and
miss it terribly. 

Anyway, just wanted to say "Hi" and keep it going!

Micah Thompson, former Technical Editor of AR

From: Richard Dickinson (sparky@icrossroads.com) 

First I'd like to say thanks for AR, which I enjoyed reading on my A2000
which has since died.  I was forced to buy a "PC" and have cursed that day
ever since.  I've recently got on your mailing list and was wondering if
you know of a reader for *.guide format files on a PC?

I hope to get myself another Amiga soon as I'm overjoyed to see Amy making
a comeback!

  Rejoicing,
              Rick D.

I create Animations for TV commercials and cartoons.  This is a serious

Hello, fist off, TNX for all your work on AR, it's realy cool.

I would like to point out that it would be nice if you could do an article
on CNet Amiga BBS, Ray has busted his butt on coding, he is money in the
hole and needs new sysops, the program (IMHO) is FAR ahead of ANY BBS
program for ANY micro.  They REALY need to get the word out about it.

TNX

-    You're right.  I've actually been in touch with those guys for
     some time now, and it's about time I did a serious article on C-Net
     and its role in this Internet age.

                            --- --- --- --- ---

From: Jason Edmonds (jedmonds@ici.net) 

I would like to speak in favor of Village Tronic for their standpoint on
the Picasso IV/CyberGraphX problem.  I own both the Picasso IV and a
Picasso II+ cards, using Picasso96 as the driver software.  The only real
problems I've had are with running Phase 5's MPeg player program (I believe
it is called Isis or Osiris - something Egyptian!) and of course the
CyberGL stuff (of which there is little or nothing yet).  All CybergraphX
v.2.0 seems to work fine in both my A4000/040/PIV and A3000/030/PII+
Amigas.  In fact, the Picasso96 is so stable I find little desire to even
desire the so-called real product (i.e.  CyberGraphX).

I might add that Picasso96 is free and the older CyberGraphX v.2.0 will run
you about $40.00 U.S.  to purchase.  The promise of CyberGraphX v.3.0 for
all of the v.2.0 cards is as yet unrealized.  That is not to mention that
the Picasso96 supports many cards that CybergraphX does not (such as the
Merlin card), and promises to support the much maligned but common Retina
Z2.  If CyberGraphX started the RTG revolution, which few will deny, why
can't it become a truly open standard?  What is wrong with a
CyberGraphX-compatible clone with better stability and more support?  I put
the question to Phase 5, who seem intent on stifling Picasso96 by making
programs which don't even conform to the original CyberGraphX
specifications.  Perhaps Wolf Dietrich et al.  will see the light and
cooperate with Village Tronic.  And please, buy the Picasso IV board, I did
and you will not regret it.  - Jason Edmonds, Boylston, MA, USA


-    The Phase5 MPEG players are called both Osiris AND Isis, the former
     for CGX 2 and 3 while Isis is CGX 3-specific.  But that's not the main
     issue here.

     As it stands today, CyberGraphX 3 is free for most of the boards which
     are CGX-supported--namely, the CyberVision cards, the
     Spectrum/Piccolo, Picasso II and II+, and Piccolo SD64.  So P96 does
     not have an overwhelming advantage in being free any longer.  The
     issues in supporting the Retina Z2 (and 2410 card) are difficult ones,
     which is why both the CGX and P96 guys have had a hard time getting
     around to implementing them.  (CGX 2's 2410 driver was done by
     someone else).  -Jason

comments: I am writing because I have a MS2400 Migraph Flatbed Scanner and
recently had a reason to scan slides.  When I purchased the scanner Migraph
had an attachement that allowed the scanning of transparencies.

My question is does Migraph still exist?  There phone has
been disconnected and I can't get a new listing from 
directory assistance.

Do you have any idea where I might find one of these attachments?

I would just like to say that I am getting excited about the Amiga again. 
I have had an A500+ for 5 years and a Pentium PC for 1.  I used to not shut
up about the Amiga and how good it was, constantly quoting specs and the
like at my mother.  She was happy with my last year's silence until I saw
the computers section of the Sydney Morning Herald (australia) last tuesday
and the lead article "The Computer That Would Not Die".  I am now beginning
to tell her all about it again, and cannot wait for a new amiga.  If it's
PPC or able to be, I will be buying one.  The love affair is about to start
all over again!  Thanks for listening.

The AR100 - The Top 100 Amiga Games of All Time

Amiga Report is launching a major new survey, aiming to determine the best
Amiga games of the past 12 years.  The Amiga Report 100 will be a reference
for games players past and present, and will be repeated every 6 months to
reflect the constantly changing Amiga games market.

What we want you to do is let us know your own personal "top ten" games -
the ten titles you've enjoyed playing more than any others on your Amiga. 
You can vote for any Amiga game - public domain, shareware or commercial. 
There's no discrimination between game genres - at the end of the day,
number 1 in the AR100 will the be game which YOU have voted the best Amiga
game ever.

Voting is easy. We allow you to vote in 3 different ways ...

By E-Mail:  send your vote to kend@dhp.com.  Include your full name,
            e-mail address, and your top ten favourite games of all time.

On the web: Point that browser at http://www.dhp.com/~kend/ar100.html and
            fill in the form.

By Fax:     Send a fax to Amiga Report on +44 131 226 6996, with your full
            name and top ten.

Of course, there are rules.  We only allow one vote per reader, so please
don't send 15 e-mails voting for the same games.  If we suspect that anyone
has voted more than once, all their votes will be disregarded.  Please give
the full name of the game - a vote for "Tetris" doesn't tell us much; tell
us which version.  All votes must be in by 31st August 1997, and to keep
things consistant, you can only vote on games released on or before 31st
June 1997.  The results will be announced in the first September issue of
Amiga Report.  Above all else, the editors' decision is final.

May the best game win!

CallMan 1.1

AUTHOR

Alexander 'Sascha' Fichtner
Vulpiusstr. 99
81739 Muenchen
Germany

fichtner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de

DESCRIPTION

CallMan is an integrated phone dialer, logfile analyzer, and cost
calculator.

CallMan uses MUI.

CallMan saves you the time looking for your address book.  CallMan allows
you to save the essential informations (incl.  phone number) on your
friends/relatives/etc.  in a (quite primitive) database.  Using a modem
connected to your Amiga you can now let CallMan dial up any of these
persons.  As soon as dialing has been completed the phone call will be
passed on to your telephone.  The most important informations on each phone
call (date, time, duration, conversation partner) will be saved to a
logfile.

CallMan can later analyze this logfile.  You can view a list of all phone
calls, the total time of all calls, and their total costs.  You can
restrict the analysis to a certain timespan and to a certain conversation
partner.

Furthermore CallMan can switch to "TelephoneBill" mode, calculating the
total costs of your phone calls within regular (free adjustable) intervals.
As a bonus CallMan can analyze the ASCII logfiles of the TCP/IP stack
Miami, the terminal programs NComm, Term, the fax software MultiFax, and
the BTX software MultiTerm/Kit.  Their costs will be added to your total
costs.

NEW FEATURES

- device name, unit and serial speed are now configurable

- supports "OwnDevUnit.library"

- user now can specify an (almost) unlimited number of modem
  logfiles to be scanned; their individual costs will be summed
  up to the total modem costs

- new logfile scanners: NComm/Term, Multifax

- rates files now support additional costs for e.g. Internet
  charges

- several bug fixes

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

- Requires: AmigaOS 3.0, MUI 3.3+, 1 MByte RAM, a Hayes-
  compatible modem and a telephone hooked to the same phone
  line.

- Recommended: AmigaOS 3.1, hard drive, additional memory, and
  an accelerator.

@node NEWS5 "Smaky 400"
@toc NEWS

We have developed a PCI board with a 68040, 68360 and PCI bridge, running
at 33 MHz and supporting from 1MB to 32MB of DRAM (single SIMM).

It has originally been developed in order to run the proprietary Smaky OS
(PSI-OS) on PCs, thus allowing an easy migration to former Smaky users.

This PCI board (Smaky 400) could be used with other operating systems.
Since the Amiga community is quite an active one, I thought that some of
you might be interested in porting the OS to this board and use it in your
PCs.

Tests have shown the Smaky 400 to be about 10 times faster than UAE (a
great Amiga Emulator) running on a Pentium Pro 200.

If the emulation is too slow, why not plug real hardware into your PC - the
68040 CPU will turn your PC into a real computer ;-)

Interested?  Visit the Smaky 400 home page for more technical details and
don't hesitate to contact me.

From Ray Burt-Frost, publisher of OctaMed SoundStudio:

As Teijo is now busy doing the new PC version and we had a lot of gripes
from the few hundred honest Amiga owners about no more new versions for
that platform, we decided that even though all the Amiga versions we have
released previously have been pirated in the thousands, thus making the
years work a total waste of time, we will take a chance just one more time
to see if some honesty will prevail.

So we are in the middle of arranging to have a new version for the Amiga
written.

It will be a long time off though and we can only suggest that you keep any
eye on our web site pages from around mid August for more details on this.


> So , what will be the new features of Octamed soundstudio?
> AHI? Any volume on 16bit samples?

Yes and yes

> Any others?

lots!!

connected and informed.

Issue 9 has lots of news.  We don't just reprint internet press releases,
but investigate the stories and give you a commentary voice.  You'll find
our lead story covers Amiga licencing and the many new clones becoming
available.  We have an exclusive discussion with Petro Tyschtschenko and a
synapsis of what it all might mean.  There's also an inside story on the
Lotus Pacific licencing flap with Gateway 2000.  In addition, we keep you
up to date on the success of the Industry Council of the Open Amiga and the
newly elected steering committee that is working with Gateway.  Finishing
up the news is an on-hand accounting of the new Siamese System, an in-depth
report on Aurora Development, the open house at National Amiga and a whole
bunch of informative news bytes.

Our regular writers once again bring you their insightful columns.  Brad
Webb goes in-depth on using WBStartup+ to get your system in shape.  Davis
Sprague guides you through "Talk", the real-time terminal to terminal
protocol.  Davis also cuts through the confusion of the many available
compression routines and provides a useful cheat sheet on how to make them
all work.  Oleg Moskalensky, aka Dr.  Amiga, answers several vexing
questions in his new Question and Answer column that will appear in every
future issue.

We've really gone full speed ahead with the reviews too.  You'll find ten
reviews, five summaries and one preview in this issue, including a new Game
Zone section.  Among the products reviewed are PC Task v4.20, Pagemonster,
Electrics, MRBackup and Nemac IV: The Directors Cut.  Our reviews are done
by independent free-lance writers who evaluate and grade products without
interference from The Informer's editors, so you get fair appraisals of all
tested products.

In addition to our numerous product announcements, you'll find a
company profile of DKB, information about ShadowWorks Software,
several handy tips, and numerous listings of dealers, user groups and
dynamite Amiga web sites. In the Action section, you'll find contact
information on Amiga International and NewTek and how you can contact
them and help the Amiga cause. To top it all off, you can find great deals
on used Amiga products in our Marketplace section.

There are several ways you can get your hands on Issue 9 of The Amiga
Informer. You can purchase it at the cover price from one of our many
retailers, hope to get lucky and receive an issue when you buy a product
from one of our few distributors, or you can subscribe. If you choose the
later, you can call toll free 1-888-88-AMIGA to subscribe by Visa or
Mastercard. If you prefer, you can fill out the on-line, no-risk no-obligation
"bill me" form at www.amigainformer.com/subscribe.cgi and we'll send you
an issue.

Either way, you'll find The Informer to be a great source of useful
information and insights. We've been producing issues for over 18 months
and plan to continue doing so well into the future. I hope you'll give us a try.

@node NEWS10 "OloFight"
@toc NEWS

OloFight is a beat'em up sporting many innovations, when compared to similar
existing products in the Amiga market:

- more than 3000 colours on screen at once (there should be 4500 of them in
  the final release), made possible on an Amiga 1200 by a new routine that
  exploits the Copper to the most

- power-ups to strenghten fighters by adding new moves (special moves will
  be easier to control than those of similar games)

- objects moving on different parallax layers, behind or in front of
  fighters

- animated backgrounds

- 3D-perspective floor motion

- background music adapting itself to the game events: it gets quiet and
  gloomy if the player is losing or triumphal if the player is winning

- high quality (100% rendered) graphics

- support for at least 4 languages (Italian, English, French, German) for
  both the manual and the game

- realistic shadow effect reflecting fighters' movements: not just a dark
  spot on the floor, but a semi-transparent outline shaped like the
  character

- works are in progress to add a daylight or darkness effect

We plan to include an intro similar (read well: similar) to those of
Playstation games like Soul Blade, thanks to a fast and effective
compression method.

The game will run with no problems at 25fps on a basic A1200 (it's a tough
challenge).

The game will be distributed on floppy disks (probably eight or more) with
a HD installation program.  We might eventually release a CD version.  A
playable demo will be ready in September, while the final product will
probably be available in December.

such companies as Nova Design, Silent Paw Productions, and Wonder
Computers, many Amiga user groups also attended and rented table space to
showcase their talents.  This year we expect close to 1000 people to attend
the event and many more vendors.  We, at AmiCON, would welcome your
attendance at our show this year and sincerely hope that you can fit this
event into your schedule.  Please let us know if you plan to attend as soon
as possible so that we can plan our floor layout or any
training/demonstrations you may be interested in doing.

Thank you for your continued support of the Amiga community.

Sincerely,

TRAINING/DEMONSTRATION SESSIONS:
AmiCON feels that showing new products to potential users is of utmost
importance to the Amiga community.  Therefore we have provided a platform

established a few guidelines:

thereafter), is available if the Vendor/Dealer provides show attendees with
a training session in one of our several training areas set up for the
event.  The training demonstration will be no less than 20 minutes in
length and must have prior approval by AmiCON.  To qualify as a valid
session, Vendors/Dealers must provide a format that informs users about new
products and/or provides a step-by-step tutorial about the operation of a
product.  The session must be staffed with presenter, who would be able to
answer questions from the audience about the product.  Slide shows and
video taped demonstrations are welcome, but the session cannot consist of
these items only.

Mr.  Hardware Computers Announces Special Video Escort v2.5 Promotion Sale.

For Immediate Release

Friday, July 11th 1997

Contact:    Joe Rothman
            Mr. Hardware Computers
            59 Storey Ave.
            Central Islip, NY 11722-2332 USA
            516-234-8110 Voice or Fax
            Email: hardware@li.net
            Web: www.li.net/~hardware

Central Islip, NY - Friday, July 11th 1997 Mr.  Hardware Computers
announced today that they are having a very special promotional sale on
their Video Escort business management program for videographers.  "We are
out to prove that the Amiga is better at running business software," said
Joe Rothman, Co-Owner of Mr.  Hardware Computers.  "Our Video Escort
product has been called the best videographers management program on any
platform by many of our users.  Yet sales have not been what they should
be.  We have concluded that only Video Escort's high price was holding it
back.  In an effort to test the waters, and increase our user base, we have
decided to have a sale."

Our vision of what business management software should do is simple.  The
management tools you use should be as intuitive and easy to use as
possible.  Software should make your life as the owner/manager easy.  You
make the decisions, but the software should do the work.  Knowing where
your business stands should be just a report or two away.  With these
thoughts in mind we present you with Video Escort v2.5.

From now until August 31st 1997, the price for Video Escort is $100.00 US.

This price includes a registered copy of SBase4Pro-RT.  This is a
significant savings over the cost of either SBase4Pro or Video Escort which
each have a $300.00 US list price.  Our regular bundled price for both
products combined is $400.00 US.

This is a particularly attractive offer because the Video Escort and
SBase4Pro-RT registrations entitle the buyer to participate in all future
upgrade offers for both SBase4Pro and Video Escort.

The Video Escort v2.5 demo is available for download on our web site at
www.li.net/~hardware or from Aminet under the name biz/dbase/ve25demo.lha.
Search for ve25demo.lha to locate it.

Video Escort is Mr.  Hardware's complete business management software for
any videography business with:

Accounts Receivable, Tons of Business Reports, Customer Memos, Easy
Contracts, Appointment Tracking, Mailing List Importing, Videotape and
Mailing Label Printing, Directions Database, Videotape, Music, and Graphics
Libraries, Job Price Quotes, Unlimited Customizable Packages and Option
Sets, plus a whole lot more.

Mr.  Hardware Computers is 100% Amiga and 100% committed to the further
development of SBase4, SBase4Pro, The Escort Series, and other fine Amiga
software.  We have worked long and hard to bring the Amiga professional
business management software.  We invite you to help prove the Amiga is
better at running business software, and therefore better for running a
business, than any other computer.

===========================================================================
                  Australian Amiga Gathering 1997 Report:
  By Guy Nathan                                        cyberwlf@wr.com.au
===========================================================================

Welcome to a report of the Australian Amiga Gathering 1997, organised and
Co-Ordinated by Australian Amiga Gazette and held between the days of the
28th of June and 29th of June this year.  The first day went from 10am till
5pm, and the second day from 10am till 4pm.  It was held in a building
within Sydney's Sydney Showground, which in the past has been most noted
for hosting The Royal Easter Show.

The turnout at the show on the first day was extremely good and outdid the
expectations of most who had stands there, and for this supposedly 'dead'
platform in Australia the place was packed almost all day on the 28th
(Saturday).  Although Sunday was rather quieter, there was still a good
amount of people who showed up and even those who attended the show for two
of the days agreed the turn out was great overall.  (923 turned out)

Although I am a freelance writer who has written for numerous publications
including Australian Amiga Gazette my actual job at the show primarily was
to represent the ICOAi (Industrial Council and Open Amiga Initiative).  But
I also assisted with duties such as ticket handling at the entrance to the
show as well as token help at the Australian Amiga Gazette/Shareware booth
stand.


The Companies:

At the show there was a good turn out of Amiga companies who brought along
their product lines and all the stock they could carry.  The general
feedback from alot of companies seemed to be that they didn't expect there
to be that many people, so some companies may have been understocked with
some products in some cases.

The companies which came along were:

* Amadeus Computers
* G Soft
* Software Buyers Service
* GP Software
* Power Computing UK
* Australian Amiga Gazette/Shareware Booth
* Computa Magic
* TechMedia
* Resource Management Force
* Unitech Electronics
* Amiga Genius
* Unicorn Solutions

As well as the organisations:

* Sydney's Commodore Hornsby User Group (CHUG),
* Melbourne's North West User Group (NWUG)
* And also St. Johns Park High School (sponsered by Unitech)

As well as this there was a representative for Amiga International, Basil
from TAEN (The Amiga Education Network), and two ICOAi Representatives,
myself and Paul Morabito.  By no means, for an Australian Amiga show, could
this considered to be a small show.

Some companies who did not show include the likes of Megatron, a company
wishing to be the Official Australian Amiga Distributors.  Alot of other
companies who didn't show, did this due to being unable to afford the
flight to Sydney with themselves and all their stock.


The Product Lines:

All the companies who went along, as well as displaying all the products
they usually retail, they also displayed the products they are distributor
for.

Amadeus Computers:

They are the distributors for Digita and Cloanto, and had their products
there.  As well as a variety of other games and hardware and a huge variety
of CD-ROMs going at cheaper than normal prices.  They also had deals such
as AFS User version going for $25 (all prices in Australian dollars) and
SAS C going for $99.  As well as a range of BSB Books going for $25 or so
and covered the topics of Amiga C and Assembly programming, Introduction to
Workbench, Introduction to the Amiga and more.

G Soft/Software Buyers Service:

G Soft were the representatives for Phase 5, unfortunately upon asking
about the PowerUp boards being available for display I was told although
the board was requested it was never sent to them in time for the show.
Besides this these two companies combined their stands and were selling a
huge range of Amiga hardware and software including Studio (Printer
Software) of which G Soft are distributors for, as well as being an
organisation in which one could officially register Miami.  Software Buyers
Service were distributors for AWeb 3.0 and Village Tronic, and Warp Engine
products, so products such as the PicassoIV and AWeb 3.0 could be bought
here.  Alot of good deals could be found on this stand between the two
businesses which occupied it.  The Infinitiv Micronik tower was also on
display at this stand.

GP Software:

At this stand the infamous Greg Perry and Jonathon Potter could be found,
authors of much notable Amiga software including Directory Opus 5.6 (aka. 
DOpus Magellan).  Here you could buy their t-shirts, play around with
DOpus, or talk to DOpus's authors, or even purchase something from the GP
Software range if you so chose to.

Power Computing UK:

At this stand the head of Power Computing UK could be found as well as two
locals.  All the goods for this stand for the show were brought over with
its' owner from the UK.  Available at the stand was some Phase5 goods (such
as accelerators and the Cybervision64/3d), and even some PicassoIV boards,
but most notable was PowerComputing UK's game Big Red Adventure which was
for sale there for only $60, not bad for an AGA Multitasking Amiga CD-ROM
game.  This game is available no where else in Australia.  It was great to
see an organisation from overseas to have come to such a show.

Australian Amiga Gazette/Shareware Booth:

At this stand was the Shareware booth where one could register on the spot
Dust, Wildfire, Delitracker2, NewYork, Shapeshifter, ST Fax, and more.  You
could also on the same stand renew or subscribe to Australian Amiga Gazette
or talk to the staff of the magazine.  You could also buy an 'Introduction
to the A1200 Basic Tutorial Volume 1' Video, or an 'Introduction to the
A1200 - A Deeper Look Volume 2 Video, going for $15 each at the show.  As
well as this, the stand held host to the ICOAi Representatives, of which we
are most appreciative of.

Computa Magic:

This stand had some amazing deals to be had on CD-ROMs.  Sensible Soccer
CD32, Chaos Engine CD32, Netnews Offline CD and other CDs were going for $5
each, They are also the distributors for ProDAD, DKB Peripherals, Golden
Image, Migraph, and Roctek, so all the products they could bring along from
these companies were there to be had.  On asking about p-OS, I was told due
to it currently being in pre-release form and only in german they did not
have it for sale there, but when it is completed, a period of 4-5 weeks
later one can expect an English version to be released, and at that point
they shall sell it.  In my opinion even a demo of it in German would have
been preferable to not even showing it at all.  They also had a huge
variety of cheap mice going for around $10 to $15.  They were also selling
clickBOOMs' Capital Punishment, most of the Vulcan range of games, and
numerous other Amiga titles, as well as a whole host of old Amiga games.

Techmedia:

At this stand there was a constant running demo of the MacroSytem's
Casablanca, a Digital Video Editing suite, which was running a pre-edited
video done using that suite which was being spooled off the harddrive.
Another Amiga there was using Scala and an MPEG Playback unit to display a
full screen bit of footage the whole time.  As well was MacroSystem's DraCo
in operation also constantly being used to display things (although mostly
left on the Movieshop screen whenever i went by).  Also for sale here was
MacroSystem's VLab Motion card and ArtEffect.  Brochures for the DraCo were
also available.  This stand attracted alot of attention, but I am unsure as
to how many sales were made.

Resource Management Force:

I didn't get much of a chance to see much at this stand, and from what I
already knew about them, they are the distributors and producers of
QuickNet Networking system in Australia, so they had that on display there,
they also appeared to have advertisments for AIC there, (Australian
Internet Company), a Sydney Internet Service provider which offers Amiga
support.

Unitech Electronics:

This stand had alot of small parts sitting around the stand on sale as well
as other Amiga products.  As they are the distributors for Competition Pro
Joypads, Kickboard Plus, Poswiz, and numerous Amiga cables they had all of
these on show.  As well they had other Amiga Software and Hardware for
sale.  You could also buy A1200's and A4000 Towers here.  A product near
completion, which they have been developing, which they planned to have at
the show, but didn't get to, was a Tower expansion for the A1200, but due
to a missing part, this missed out on being demonstrated at the show.

Amiga Genius:

This stand was next to the Australian Amiga Gazette stand, which was near
the entrance so often had alot of people checking out the stand.  Most
notably this stand distributes the Amiga Siamese system and had this on
display at the show.  They also had a variety of chips and cheap (old)
software on sale there as well.  They were also selling the Amiga Graffiti
cards, a card which has similar purpose to that of a graphic card, but has
to have software that is specifically written for it in order to use it
with it, these units also plug into small and big box Amigas.  They were
also selling the AQCVid software which people can use with the product
QuickCam digital camera which captures images, and ideal for Internet
users.  They also distributed The GoldenGate 2 Bus+, which allows the plug
in of PC peripherals such as networking cards into big box Amigas with
Amiga software support.

Unicorn Solutions:

This stand played host to showing the capability of networking Amigas
together from anything from an Amiga 600 upto an Amiga 4000 with 060, and
even linking via a PCMCIA Ethernet card on the A600/A1200 to a Win95 PC.
Most things which happened here were discussions of Amiga Networking
Solutions within Amiga Networks, or Amigas in PC Ethernet networks.  As
well as using the A4000/060 a demo of a new and upcoming Amiga game which
had a graphics engine which looked similar to Quake (albeit not another
Doom-game) from the demo coder Accolyte in Cydonia, an Australian Amiga
Demo group, this game is not yet complete, but it was never the less an
amazing demonstration.


The Other Organisations:

Sydney's Commodore Hornsby User Group (CHUG):

This stand didn't really have much to it, and could be probably most noted
for one of the members of the group sitting there the whole time playing
Megaball.  They also seemed to be helping out those who came to them for
information whether it be regarding the group or about the Amiga in
general.

Melbourne's North West User Group (NWUG):

This stand had about on average four guys sitting around it answering the
questions of people who came up to the stand and asked them both about the
group and/or Amigas.  They had a newsletter available the group publishes
for those who were intrested.  They also succesfully helped to finish off
the last part at converting an IBM user to buy an Amiga (so a great
commendation for that alone should go here).  They were also selling off
second hand parts from the guys computers who came up.

St. Johns Park High School:

This stand un-like any other had nothing to do specifically with any Amiga
organisation, but was sponsered by Unitech Electronics.  About 10 or so
school children attended this stand with their teacher in which they were
designing new graphics in DPaint on the spot and demonstrating via the
means of a slideshow and a very impressive video tape the art work and
video work they had created using Amigas.  The video work was of near
professional quality, an amazing achievement for people that age.  This
stand also represents an example of TAEN, The Amiga Education Network, the
stand where the Amiga International Representative was from.


The Speeches:

There were two speeches made at this show, the one made by me on the
Saturday morning, and the one by the Amiga International Representative on
Saturday afternoon.

The ICOAi Speech:

The outline of this speech basically says that the ICOAi, or the Industrial
Council and Open Amiga Iniative is an organisation with over 1000
supporters already, and is hoping to get approval from Amiga International
to help form a body in which they can set the standards for future Amiga
hardware and software.  They also have a goal towards OASYS, Open Amiga
operationg SYStem, a process of making the AmigaOS no longer hardware
bound.  A copy of the speech is available on this page:

http://www.ozemail.com.au/~cyberwlf/CyberAm_News.html

Paul Morabito and myself were the Australian ICOAi people at the show.

The Amiga International Speech:

Held by the man from TAEN, Basil, he acted as Petro's representative in
Australia, as Petro was unable to in the end attend the show.  Using a
pre-written speech faxed into the country only that day, he read it out to
all who listened.  The outcomes of the speech are as follows:

- They will:
* Support the existing Amiga User base
* Work with developers to further develop the Amiga
* Encourage broad licensing of the Amiga Hardware/Software

- They are working with Phase 5 in R&D
- They are actively looking for Australian partners
- Acknowledged the lack of recognition of Australian market
- Aimed to ensure local market much better cared for
- Talked of the licensing of the first official Amiga clone

Although the first three points have been heard alot of times before, it
did suprise me the points mentioned below it as some details are more
detailed and more local than any other speech I have ever read before.

The actual TAEN/AI Representative also proceeded to go around to every
stand talking to the people working at them as well as meeting with and
talking with many Amiga owners there, a truly dedicated Amigan, and one of
the people who started up one of the Amigas first ever Amiga user groups in
Australia.


The Seminars:

Besides the speeches certain seminars went on.  On the first day there was
demonstrations of the Siamese System by Amiga Genius, Networking Amigas by
Unicorn Solutions, Amiga Sale of the Century (ten rather easy questions
asked to three contestants in a Sale of the Century style manner, and in
which the participants could all win prizes), Directory Opus demonstration
by Greg Perry from GP Software, and Amiga Ethernet card and Casablanca
demonstration by TechMedia.

Besides the above presentations, on the Sunday the place in which the
demonstrations were held also held host to the Amiga User Groups
Conference, and also a WildBench (Workbench Comparison) Competition.  The
outcomes of the Amiga User Group Conference was a very productice
conference with many Amiga User Groups from many states in Attendance.


Overall:

In conclusion, this would have to be an excellent Amiga show, and when one
takes into consideration the current situation with the Amiga in Australia,
and the fact it has been since 1993 we have had such a show in Australia, I
believe it went extremely well.  If there are any future shows, which if
judging the success of this there should, I'd like to see those who didn't
show, show up this time.

===========================================================================
                 A Guide To The Ubiquitous Amiga Emulator
  Paul Liss                                   paul@armstrong.son.wisc.edu
===========================================================================

I have been following the development of UAE (initially, it stood for the
Useless Amiga Emulator, then it became the Un*x Amiga Emulator, and now it
seems to go by the Ubiquitous Amiga Emulator) since the early days when it
was black and white and couldn't boot from a floppy image.  It has come a
long way since then.

This review is primarily directed at those Amiga users who also have a PC,
or, those Amiga users who are thinking about jumping ship to the PC, but
want to know if they'll be able to take their software with them.  This
review is not a tutorial on how to use UAE, however I will include links to
that information on the WWW.  This review focuses on using UAE to play
games and look at demos.  I will write another article on more advanced
issues at a later date.
 
Introduction to UAE:
 
UAE is an emulator that allows you to run Amiga software on whatever
platform you can find a port for.  Versions exist for Win32/Direct X
(Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0), DOS, OS/2, PowerMAC, BeBox, Linux, UNIX,
Next, Acorn RISC, and the Amiga (I'll explain this one in greater detail
later).
 
So, exactly, what does it emulate?
 
(from the readme in UAE version 0.6.9)
 
This version of UAE emulates:
 
- An Amiga 500 Computer, with 68000 or 68020 CPU (68020 includes 68881 FPU)
- OCS Graphics Chipset, plus big blits from the ECS Chipset
- Up to 2MB Chip RAM
- Up to 8MB Fast RAM
- Up to 1MB Slow RAM, for extended compatibility with problem software
- 4 x 3.5" floppy disk drives (DF0:, DF1:, DF2: and DF3:)
- Hard-disk emulation
- Joystick support (with option of mapping joystick to numeric keypad)
- Mouse support
- Ability to run in various screen modes (for better display quality or
  better speed)
- Full sound support, consisting of 4 x 8bit channels (mixed into one, so
  output is mono for now).
- Beta parallel port support
- some other things which don't work well enough to mention them here...
 
Not emulated:
- Sprite to playfield collisions (sprite to sprite collisions work)
- An MMU (part of 68030/040 CPUs except those that Commodore used).  This
  means you can't use virtual memory systems or real operating systems like
  Linux or BSD.
- The AGA chipset (A4000/A1200).  This chipset has enhanced capabilites for
  up to 256 colors in all resolutions.
- Serial port emulation exists but doesn't work too well.
 
I maintain a web page with links to all of the UAE versions for various
platforms that I know of at:
 
http://www.son.wisc.edu/~paul/uae.html
 
UAE was written by Bernd Schmidt, and was developed on an Intel based Linux
machine.  It was designed with portability in mind (i.e.  written in C),
but some speed critical parts are written in assembly (Intel versions
only).  Bernd has made the source code available as well.  The UAE home
page (hosted by Stefan Reinauer) has the source, plus binary versions for
Intel Linux at:
 
http://www.schokola.de/~stepan/uae/
 
Which version of UAE should you get?
 
If you have a PC, and you have Windows 95 or NT 4.0, get the Win 32 version
(ported by Mathias Ortmann).  It has some advantages over the DOS and Linux
versions: it supports all of the sound and video cards supported by Windows
95 or NT 4.0, it takes advantage of Direct X (which makes it faster than
the DOS version under certain conditions), and it supports some features
that neither the DOS or Linux version do.  (Stereo support, for one).
 
http://www.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~ortmann/uae/
http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/1570/ (USA mirror)
 
If you have a Soundblaster 16, VESA 2.0 support for your video card, and
would prefer not to use Windows, you can try the DOS version (ported by
Gustavo Geodert).
 
http://www.netrunner.com.br/dosuae/index.html
 
There is a version of UAE for the Amiga, available from my UAE page:
 
http://www.son.wisc.edu/~paul/uae.html
 
I'll discuss UAE on the Amiga later on in this article.
 
When you unpack the UAE archive, make sure to look at the documentation
found in the docs directory of the archive.  Further, there may be
additional documentation found in the root directory of the archive.  It
might seem like a lot to read, but read everything specific to your
configuration that you can find (especially the faq in docs/faq, and the
readme in docs/readme).  UAE is not a user-friendly program.  It is very
difficult for a novice computer user to set it up.  Fortunately, there are
some pages on the WWW where help can be found.
 
I recommend that every UAE user check out the UAE discussion board at:
 
http://www.netrunner.com.br/dosuae/uaeboard/
 
There is a very good online faq at:
 
http://www.netrunner.com.br/dosuae/uaeboard/uaefaq2.html
 
There is a very good, step by step guide to setting up hard drive support on UAE at:
 
http://app.nexus-online.com/lazarus/harddrive.html
 
How fast is it?
 
That really depends.  It depends on how fast your machine is, and it
depends on what you're trying to run.  If you have less than 16 MB of RAM
on the DOS and Linux versions, or 32MB of RAM for the Win32 version, the
emulator will be constantly using virtual memory, and therefore slow.  Do
you want to run something that uses the copper, blitter, all 4 sound
channels, and has tons of sprites on screen plus horizontal or vertical
scrolling (think Turrican)?  You need the fastest machine you can find. 
(Pentium II at 300 Mhz., perhaps, or maybe it's time to put that SGI in
your closet to good use).  Do you want to play games without a great deal
of action on the screen?  (Think Bard's Tale or Monkey Island) You can do
that on a Pentium 133.  Do you want to mess around with the Workbench?  You
need even less CPU horsepower.  Games seem to vary so much that you really
need to try it yourself and see how it goes.  The typical case you'll
discover is that the graphics will look fine, but the sound will be
distorted or out of sync.  This means that your computer isn't fast enough
to let UAE emulate a PAL Amiga 500 at 50 fps for the particular program you
are trying to run.
 
You can tune things to some degree to get more speed.  UAE can skip the
display of some frames, or allocate more of the host's CPU time to hardware
emulation as opposed to 68000/020 emulation.  If you use the Linux version,
you can compile a version of UAE without sound support, which will give you
about 10% extra performance.  You can even turn off screen updates entirely
if all you want to do is hear UAE play mods or other music.
 
Compatibility:
 
UAE does a very, very good job of maintaining compatibility with a PAL
Amiga 500.  Read the docs/compatibility file for starters.  This file is a
woefully incomplete list of programs that are known to work with UAE.  If
you downloaded the Win32/Direct X version, there is a file called
compatibility.txt which contains some more compatibility information.  A
much more complete list can be found at the UnOfficial UAE Compatibility
Table at:
 
http://www.alpes-net.fr/~flynn/amiga.htm
 
UAE has, in general, become more and more compatible with a real Amiga 500
over time.  However, there are still problems with sprites (specifically,
sprite to playfield collisions).  For example, the Pinball Fantasies demo
from Aminet http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/~aminet/dirs/game_demo.html
eventually crashes UAE after you get to watch the pinball sprite go through
the bottom of the screen, then appear at the top, then get pulled down etc.
However, that same game demo works 100% on version 0.6.3 of UAE.
 
Careful readers will have noticed by now that, just like on a real Amiga,
you'll need Kickstart 1.3 to play some games, and later Kickstart versions
for others. 
 
Getting Disk and ROM Images:
 
First off, you need a working Amiga to transfer ROM and disk images.  It
may be possible someday to use the Catweasel controller to read Amiga disks
on a PC, but for now, UAE does not directly support such hardware.  You
will need a way to transfer data between a PC and an Amiga.  Several
suggestions are given in the docs.
 
UAE includes two programs for that purpose; transdisk and transrom.  (Found
in the amiga directory of the UAE distribution).  The operation of both
programs is well documented in docs/readme.  One pitfall is that transdisk
cannot copy copy-protected disks.  This presents a problem for those of us
who aren't pirates.  Like the C64 emulation scene, it is best to have
"cracked" copies of games.  Fortunately, Tony Bybell has put his Lockpick
program (which can remove the copy protection of many popular games)
available for download on the web at:
 
http://www.cse.psu.edu/~bybell/lockpick.html
 
Another place to visit for help is The Amiga Ultimate Patch & HD Installers
Page:
 
http://www.ensica.fr/~jffabre/patches.html
 
How to get those old Amiga games working is a great web page with even more
information on which programs need various Kickstart versions, 1/2 or 1 MB
of chip ram, etc.:
 
http://web.ukonline.co.uk/Members/gc.yuen/gamesfixes/
 
And, finally, don't forget Aminet.  Look in the game/patch directory for
some more useful programs.
 
Managing UAE:
 
Some clever programmers have come up with front-ends for UAE that take much
of the drudgery out of running several different games.  For example,
Bard's Tale requires Kickstart 1.3, and some older games require kickstart
1.1 or 1.2.  I used to have dozens of batch files that took care of
starting UAE with different settings, but now I use a front-end program to
take care of that for me.  I seriously recommend looking at one of the
front-ends available for download from these pages:
 
http://www.eastwind.com.au/homepages/timgunn/uae/
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bay/3211/
 
What was that about an Amiga version of UAE?
 
Samuel Devulder has ported UAE to the Amiga.  He has made a lot of tweaks
to slim down UAE's memory requirements and get as much speed as possible. 
Despite that, it's very slow.  Sam recommends a machine 20 times faster
than an A4000 (which doesn't yet exist).  With a 060, a decent Zorro III
graphics card with CyberGFX support, no sound, and a frame rate of 1/5,
games like Bard's Tale are playable under UAE.  As Sam points, out, Amigas
using the PowerPC chip will eventually be fast enough to run UAE at usable
speeds.
 
Some unique features about Sam's Amiga port are the ability to make
animations from UAE (read readme.amiga in the UAE distribution), and the
ability to dump the sound to a file.  (so you could ultimately make an MP3
of the music from your favorite demos, with the use of some other programs
of course - I'm going to make one of the Obliterator music from the
RasterMagic demo).
 
Another neat thing is that it is possible to run UAE for Amiga under UAE. 
Remember that patience is a virtue, if you want to try this.
 
Final thoughts:
 
UAE is an incredible piece of software.  It does what was supposed to be
impossible: Emulate an Amiga in software.  It really works!  You can play
just about any ECS game you can make an appropriate image for.  Even games
like Shadow of the Beast, Turrican, and the like work under UAE. 
 
Unfortunately, on today's PCs, it isn't that fast.  In a CPU generation or
two, running an Amiga emulator won't be a problem, much like running a C64
emulator on a Pentium.
 
If you want to play action games and look at demos, make sure you have a
Pentium II / Pentium Pro class machine.  Alternatively, you might wish to
try out Fellow, a less-compatible but faster Amiga emulator for MSDOS only.
You can find Fellow at:
 
http://www.ifi.uio.no/~pettersc/fellow/fellow.html
 
If you want to play adventure/role playing games without with less screen
activity, you can run UAE on a speedy Pentium class machine.  In fact, I
finally solved the Amiga version of Bard's Tale II, after meaning to do so
for about 8 years, using UAE.
 
Make sure to invest the time in looking at the docs, and to get comfortable
with one of the front-end programs.
 
The Future of UAE:
 
Recently, it has been announced on the Amiga newsgroups that there will be
a Picasso 96 driver for UAE.  Once that's out, I'm going to do another
review of UAE, focusing on Workbench performance and applications
performance.  Further, I think some attention needs to be paid to using the
serial and parallel port emulation of UAE, and I'll give a review of the
dynamic recompilation options available in Linux and older versions of
DOSUAE.

@node REVIEW1 "Review: Directory Opus 5.6 Magellan"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                    Review: Directory Opus 5.6 Magellan
                             By @{" William Near " link WILLIAM}
===========================================================================

Magellan, back in orbit!

The latest version of Directory Opus is 5.6 Magellan.  This is much more
than a simple bug-fix and superficial rework.  Many of DOpus' features have
been enhanced to allow easier access, configurability, and power.  There is
an abundance of new features too.

Considering the Amiga's situation over the past three years, it's
refreshing to see that some companies are continuing to update their
products.  GPSoftware has been with us through thick and thin -- let's hope
they continue to do so in the future.


What's new?

Icons:

Magellan now comes with built-in support for NewIcons.  You can enable
NewIcons' support with a click of a mouse button, or discourage the use of
NewIcons if you come across any and you don't currently use them on your
machine.  There are also options to dither the images down to the number of
colors you are currently using and the pen precision can be selected too. 
There is support for using NewIcons' images for all system images and in
your button banks as well.

You can turn off icon borders on a global or individual basis, the
accidental movement of an icon's position while double-clicking it has been
remedied, and the ability to split long icon names into two lines has also
been added.  An area of the Desktop can even be defined to designate where
newly appearing icons will be placed, and with what priority.

Magellan offers a new icon information requester with pulldown menus for:
icon border (on or off), icon label (on or off), display NewIcon image,
display original icon image, strip NewIcon image, and strip original icon
image from the current icon.  The icon's complete path is also shown within
a window in the information requester.

A new Command Icon option has been implemented.  You can define a command
and have an icon assigned to the command and left-out on your Desktop.  By
clicking on this command icon, the assigned command will be executed. 


Environment:

The Environment GUI has been enhanced to allow greater control over DOpus'
configuration.

DOpus now has the ability to display any image as the Desktop backdrop, in
Lister and Group windows, and in Requesters, as long as you have the
appropriate Data Type for the selected file type. 

The Hidden Drives list has been revamped so that when you enter the
Environment GUI a device's entry will not be deleted upon resetting, even
if that device is not always present on your system.

The setting of a Lister's default size and position, colors, fonts, and
status bar text have all been moved to a separate Environment area. 

There are two great new features available in Listers that you may find
quite useful.  The first feature is in-line editing of a file's name,
comment, date, and protection bits, from a name-mode Lister.  To accomplish
this, all you need to do is click the mouse button(s) that you specify and
a cursor will appear on the line of the selected file.  Moving the cursor
with the cursor keys allows you to directly edit any of the aforementioned
attributes without pulling up a single requester!  Hitting the Return key
will immediately execute the changes you've made.  The second feature is a
Free Space Gauge option, similar to the old Workbench type, that adds a
fuel-gauge to Listers.  The fuel-gauge shows the free space available in
relation to the used space on the specified device.  The color of the gauge
can also be adjusted. 


Desktop Folder:

Magellan introduces a new turn on the old left-out icon routine.   Instead
of just placing a reference to the file or drawer on the Workbench, as the
original Workbench does, Magellan takes this a step further by actually
leaving the real file or drawer's icon out on the Desktop.  However, you
must exercise caution when deleting a file or drawer from the Desktop
Folder because the actual file or drawer will be completely erased from
your hard drive or other device.

There are two ways to move files or drawers to the Desktop Folder.  The
first is to right-click on the file or drawer's icon to activate the pop-up
menu and then select the Copy/To Desktop option.  The second is to drag 'n'
drop a file or drawer's icon to the Desktop, which causes a pop-up menu to
appear (if enabled.) The pop-up menu gives you four options: make the icon
a normal left-out, copy the icon to the Desktop (leaving a copy in the
original location too), move the icon to the Desktop (this will physically
move the icon to the Desktop, and is the option that requires the most care
when deleting), or Cancel.

The default action for a Desktop Folder operation (Create Left-Out, Copy to
Desktop, Move to Desktop, or None) can be defined from the Environment
requester.  The default action will automatically occur whenever you drag
an icon to the Desktop, or you can enable the pop-up menu so that it
appears every time to ask you what you'd like to do with the icon in
question.


FTP from the Desktop!

The FTP module has undergone quite a bit of reworking.  More efficient
memory usage by the module has resulted in faster remote directory listings
and transfers that are up to five times faster than before. 

You can even do direct transfers between remote sites, so you can copy or
drag 'n' drop files between remote machines. 

The FTP Address Book has been updated so that double-clicking on an entry
will connect to that site, or you can single-click on an entry and then
delete or edit it. 

A NOP function has been added to help keep sites active with an idle timer
mechanism.  This will allow you to stay connected without actually doing
anything at the site; thus eliminating time-outs. 


Let's get Started.

Start menus were included in DOpus 5.5, but they weren't exactly jumping
out at you -- they are now a full-featured addition to Magellan.

Start menus appear as a single button on the Desktop and have pop-up menus
attached to them.  A Start menu can be created by drag 'n' dropping a
directory onto the Start menu editor.  This will create a pop-up menu
containing all of the items within that directory.  Drag 'n' dropping files
onto a Start button will add them to the existing pop-up menu.  You can
also create a Start menu the old fashioned way -- by manually editing the
menu items from the requester.  Images can be added to any of the Start
menu's items, and submenus are also available.


Workbench can be replaced!

Using Magellan in Workbench Replacement mode is like having a new version
of Workbench installed, your productivity and ease-of-use will at least
triple.  Just being able to do more than one Workbench operation at a time
is well worth the price of admission.   The ability to copy files from one
device to another, launch your favorite application(s), and scan a
directory all at the same time is quite a departure from the normal
Workbench's modus operandi -- no more waiting for a busy pointer to return
before being able to do anything else.

I would not recommend using Workbench Replacement mode if you have a slow
Amiga, or if you're short on RAM.  If you have at least an '030 and an
extra 2 MBs of RAM to spare, then you should be all set to go.

You can always boot your computer back to the normal Workbench mode by
holding down the shift key as it reboots.  This will execute your standard
loadwb command, instead of the DOpus Workbench Replacement mode's loadwb
command. 


Extra bits and pieces

Directory Opus Magellan includes several other features and additions.
Here are a few of them:

Improved CyberGraphX support will be a welcomed addition for all you
graphics card owners out there.  The CyberGraphX enhancements include:
faster icon dragging and display speed routines (even with 24-bit
backdrops), a rewritten Text viewer that allows faster access to your data
and better scrolling on CyberGraphX screens.

The Magellan version of Directory Opus has greatly improved compatibility
with MUI, MCP, and Datatypes.

There is full NewIcon image support for Buttons and Images, plus better
animation file support for DPaint IV and PPaint AnimBrushes.


Final thoughts

I am impressed with the latest version of Directory Opus and I wouldn't
want to compute without it -- using it in Workbench Replacement mode is
truly amazing.

As a longtime supporter of Directory Opus, I can only say that 
each new release never ceases to amaze me with its new features 
and configurability.

@node REVIEW2 "Review: Damage"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                              Review: Damage
                             By: @{" Ken Anderson " link KEN}
===========================================================================

Firstly, a warning: don't let children read this review.  In fact, don't
let kids, your mother, right-wing politicians or anyone else remotely
sensitive anywhere near Damage.

Damage is sick, twisted, violent, and inevitably great fun.  For reasons
not explained (or required), Micheal Modelcitizen turns into Mr Damage,
hell bent on ...  well, being anything but a model citizen.  This generally
means shooting things, stealing things, and injecting things into other
things.  Shooting things requires bullets and a weapon; to acquire this
you'll either have to steal it or buy it.  To buy it, you'll need to steal
money.  To steal it, you have to hit people.  You get the idea - there's no
working for a living in this game.

To kickstart the whole process, you're initially equipped with a baseball
bat.  With a nicely realistic thump, you can club down the first old lady
who totters past.  Her walking stick flies into the air, the blood starts
gushing, and the first kill has been notched up.  Soon after, the police
arrive and start fighting back.

It's all presented as a side-on, flick screen game.  The graphics are very
small but well detailed and animated - a shot fired produces a believable
amount of recoil, and a baseball bat to the back of a policeman's head
gives a nice stunned reaction before he collapses.  Coupled with the sound
effects splattering and booming in all the right places, Damage is an
enjoyable experience, especially after returning home from crowded shopping
centres.

Just to spice things up, there's various different narcotics you can pump
into your veins to speed things up, slow them down or temporarily paint
them a different colour.  There's even a suicide needle if things get too
much.

The controls are a bit on the sluggish side, meaning under heavy fire it
can be frustrating trying to escape up a side street.  There are times when
the drugs and violence go just a bit too far - fair enough, it's only a
game, but necrophilia?

There's not much more to Damage, but isn't cheap and twisted violence
enough for you?  It's certainly the first game in a while to have the score
measured by the number of people killed.  Cheaper than a Swedish blond
masseur, it's the next best thing for stress relief after a long day
conforming.

Pros: Wonderful carefree realistic violence.  Small but well animated
graphics and satisfying effects.  Perfect for fans of "Falling Down".

Cons: Good God it's sick - Damage will have even the hardest
pint-swallowing nutter exclaiming "euurr" after a while.  There's only so
much to be offended by - plodding around killing things can get boring ...
sometimes ...

INSTALLATION

The CyberSCSI Mk II (from hereon designated as the CyberSCSI- or
SCSI-module) is an additional module for any Cyberstorm Mk II CPU card.
The latter features a connector on which the SCSI-module is placed.  It is
simply impossible to connect the two in a wrong way (especially with a
68040-based Cyberstorm: the cooling fin on this CPU forms a large
blockage).  Of course, if you are not comfortable opening the computer by
yourself, have your dealer or a qualified engineer do the job for you.
However, no matter who's performing the installation, there are a few `ifs
and buts' which complicate the procedure.

Amiga 3000(T) users are informed that their computer may not work reliably
with Zorro III DMA-capable hardware in their system; this affects the
CyberSCSI-module as well.  However, I have been informed that this problem
is solved by switching to the latest revisions of the Buster and Gayle (or
was it Gary?) custom chips.  Keep in mind that this is pure hear-say; so
please check thouroughly with your dealer or someone with a good knowledge
of the 3000-hardware.

Additionally, some soldering on the mainboard of all 3000-models is always
required if you wish to install the SCSI-module: it requires a signal which
is not provided by the CPU slot of said computers.  Please note that this
is NOT necessary if you install the module in a 4000.

Regardless of the type of Amiga, READ THE MANUAL FIRST.  The firmware of
your Cyberstorm MUST be updated BEFORE you install the SCSI-module.  The
manual explains how to do this quite elaborately, but also informs you that
the updating procedure may cripple your CPU-module beyond repair.  These
kind of warnings give me the creeps.  It really takes a mental push (read:
a few gulps of whisky or vodka) to start the updating procedure after
reading about the possible consequences.  No programs are available to
restore your Cyberstorm to its original state; instead, you are advised to
contact the support department.  And then what??  Good going, guys!

Two remarks here.  By chance I spotted a question in the
comp.sys.amiga.hardware newsgroup about unsuccesful updates; after a week
there were still no responses.  I therefore conclude (with the necessary
precautions) that a failure is rare.  The second remark concerns the
manual: it says that a rainbow pattern should appear early in the
bootprocess to signify the Cyberstorm's presence; this did not occur with
my module (strange), despite the fact that the updating procedure completed
successfully (*relieved sigh*).

The second problem you run into is the amount of space you have to position
all cables.  The SCSI-module itself is not equipped with termination
resistors; they are placed on a separate PCB which houses the external
SCSI-connector.  The two are connected with a short (but very broad
50-wire) ribbon cable which passes squarely over the Amiga's internal IDE
and floppy drive connectors.  The effect of this new cable is that you have
to reroute the ribbons of said connectors in a way which would have Houdini
think for a while.  And then you still have to connect the internal
SCSI-cable (with connectors for 2 SCSI-devices and the controller)...  In
one word: messy.  I strongly suggest you test everything before you close
up the Amiga while you still have easy access to all hardware.

And just when you think you've got it all covered: updating the firmware,
setting the termination resistors and miscellaneous jumpers, connecting all
cables, and so on...  you come to the conclusion that the (large) power
cables of the devices in the upper front drive bay and lower rear drive bay
meet head-on before everything is in place...  This is without a doubt
strongly dependent on the type of equipment you are using, but since a
warned person counts for two...

Strangely enough, the informative manual makes no mention what to do with
the connector for the activity LED.  Since I intended to remove all IDE
drives from my system, I simply used the system's LED.  However, I have
seen various documents on how to install a two-colour LED; check out the
Aminet for a copy.  Keep in mind this requires you to solder a small
circuit, so have a experienced or qualified person do this for you in case
you can't do this by yourself.

The above process is clearly described in the manual, but it will take you
a lot longer to _do_ than to _read_ it.  Keep your cool and you'll do fine.

Last but not least, I wish to point out that SCSI-devices in general are
affected by the quality of your cables like no other equipment in your
computer.  A full explanantion goes beyond this review, but I recommend the
SCSI-FAQ (ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet-by-group/comp.periphs.scsi/) for a
full explanation.  You may be interested to know that in a random sampling
of cables which were supposed to adhere to the SCSI-2 standard, only half
actually did.

REVIEW

Hardware
~~~~~~~~
If you are not familiar with the SCSI-jargon, I recommend you read the
SCSI-FAQ of which I gave the address above.

This piece of hardware equips your Amiga with an autobooting,
RDB-supporting SCSI-2 controller.  With this hardware, you can connect up
to 7 SCSI-devices to your Amiga.  This includes hard drives, CD-ROMs,
magneto-optical devices, scanners, tapestreamers, and so on.  If it has a
SCSI-interface, you can use it on the Amiga.  (Of course you need some
software as well, but there are no problems concerning the hardware.)
Needless to say, this expands the capabilities of your computer
considerably.

The most important thing you have to care about are the termination
resistors.  Without these, the backbone cable remains `open' at some end,
leading to malfunctions.  Since it is easy to forget to place or remove a
resistor, phase 5 have equipped the SCSI-module with an automatic resistor.
This clever circuit finds out on its own whether it is the last piece of
equipment on the backbone and switches itself on if this is indeed the
case.  One exception exists, but this is clearly documented in the manual.
You can of course also switch the resistor to manual or simply to off.

Since this resistor is located on a separate PCB and the controller insists
on being at the end of a cable if you are just using internal SCSI-devices,
it follows you always have to install this PCB -- and thus run into the
already mentiond cable routing problem.  (If the latter requirement was
dropped, you could make a device-controller-device connection, and have the
termination resistors reside on both devices, thus eliminating the need for
the second PCB.  Perhaps it is possible, but since the documentation does
not mention it, I decided not to try.)

The main controller PCB has three extra jumpers which aid in setting up
your system.  You can extend the waiting period at startup (useful for old
SCSI-devices which are slow starters), put the controller into `slow cable
mode' (if you have very long cables), and have the controller automatically
operate any device using FastSCSI-2 mode.  Of course the device has to be
able to handle this.

The external port is a SCSI-2 50-pins connector.  In other words, if you
are going to use equipment which uses the more common 25-pins or Centronics
50-pins connector, you will need an adaptor plug (which are not exactly
cheap).

Finally, the hardware itself looks well made.  However, the design is still
something which makes me wonder if it could not have been done in a smarter
way.  All the equipment is now stuffed in a small amount of space, yet
there is a huge amount of room left above the rest of the CPU-module, over
the SIMM modules.

Software
~~~~~~~~
All software is delivered on one disk bearing the name `SCSI Tool Disk'.
When you reach the point that you can start using the SCSI-devices, you
will aready have used it: it also contains the updating program.  It is
quite interesting to see that the disk contains directories for all
products by phase 5 which can be extended with a SCSI-module; this includes
hardware such as the Fastlane and the Blizzard 1230 Mk IV.  (The only
difference as far as I could tell were the icons' tooltypes.)

After installing the software (which consists of a SCSI-bus control
program, a HDToolbox-like program, the AmiCDFS 2.38 filing system, an
audio-CD player, DynamiCache and lots of documentation) using the normal
Installer, you are in business.

The SCSI-bus control program (UnitControl2) allows you to change various
low-level options of the SCSI-devices and the controller.  This includes
parameters like reselection, bus time outs, and probing of LUNs during
start-up.  It is especially useful if you are optimizing the performance of
your storage media.  The on-disk manual is quite clear about all options
and you should read it carefully.  This is because some gadgets carry
rather misleading names which might cause data loss if they are operated in
the wrong way.

SCSIControl3 is phase 5's replacement for the HDToolbox program.  It works
in a similar way and gives you the same options, save for a few.  For
example, it lacks a verify option, which can present a problem if you end
up with a `disk not validated'-error.  For this reason and the fact that
the graphical display of your partitions leads to a better overview, I
still prefer Commodore's program.  There is enough room for improvement,
and I therefore hope that phase 5 will do so.  In practice it gets the job
of partitioning done without problems.  However, I did find an annoying
bug: in order to access the information about the partition itself (size,
location, type of filing system, etc.), you have to double-click on the
name of the partition.  However, this will not work if the 'Del Partition'
gadget is active.  You have to deactivate this one first.

The AmiCDFS filing system allows you to access CD-ROMs.  It can handle
quite an amount of formats: ISO-9660, HFS, RockRidge, PhotoCD and CDDA are
present and accounted for.  Not only is it quite extensive, it is fast as
well.  AmiCDFS is a shareware program, and I was amazed to find out that
phase 5 don't give us the full version.  This makes phase 5 look a bit
stingy to me; especially in conjunction with the disclaimer that programs
may be withdrawn from the disk at any moment if the author of the program
wishes it so.

Both AmiCDFS and the audio CD-player program (MCDPlayer 1.01) work as they
should.  However, since I have never used a CD-ROM in any computer until
now, I have no experience with other programs.  MCDPlayer is quite crude,
and I'm sure better alternatives are easily found.  (I happened to see a
picture of a rather nice one in the April or May issue of Amiga Computing,
but I forgot its name.)

The documentation is quite interesting for programmers, since it contains
(amongst other things) a complete list of all SCSI-2 commands, the source
to a low-level SCSI-bus program (not UnitControl2, unfortunately :)) and
some tips on how to get MS-DOS partitions on your mass data storage
devices.

Real World Experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing all hard- and software and copying my data from the old IDE
drives to the Fireball proved not be the quick easy task I had envisaged it
would be, but within two hours I could remove the IDE drives and start the
first SCSI-only boot.  With IDE drives attached, nothing out of the
ordinary happened; without them no problems whatsoever occurred as well.

Well, _any_ problems is perhaps too grand a word.  One small, but _very_
useful utility decided to call it quits: undel by Martin Mares.  This
undelete program insists on using the standard scsi.device to perform its
magic.  And the CyberSCSI-module is operated with the cybscsi.device, so...
In general, if the program allows to choose your own .device and unit
number, you can use it without problems.  A small number of people may ask
whether you can use the CyberSCSI-module with NetBSD.  At the moment of
writing (April 1997) the best answer I can give is `maybe'.  A
developmental module exists for this controller, but from what I read, it
still works rather unreliably.  In my opinion, you are better off switching
to Linux/m68k (yes, Linux/m68k!), which _does_ support this controller.

It is a trifle pointless to present DiskSpeed data here, since they are
highly dependent on the hardware employed.  However, I can say that a
fragmented hard disk is a sure speed killer :).  However, that's no problem
ReOrg can't handle.  I am a little concerned with the amount of CPU-time
the DMA-controller demands, though.  Or better put (since DMA takes no
CPU-time at all) the time required by the programs before the
DMA-controller can be put to work.  Unfortunately, this is mostly OS-stuff
and therefore cannot be changed easily.  On the other hand, at least the
module at least leaves some time free in comparison to the 4000's internal
IDE interface!

Even under heavy multitasking loads with lots of different programs
fighting for control of the hard disk and the CD-ROM, the module performs
without a glitch.  No compatibility problems could be established
(admittedly, my list of tested devices is small).  All in all, I am very
pleased with the module.

DOCUMENTATION

The 42-page bilingual (German and English) A6-booklet provides detailed
information about your new toy.  The installation procedure is clearly
described and includes a few small photographs.  SCSI in general,
termination resistors, jumper settings and common errors are devoted a few
pages each.  Sometimes I read a section in German, because in my opinion
that still describes everything best, but I am convinced you will have
little trouble with the English text, despite numerous spelling errors.  As
a special extra, a pin layouts of the SCSI-2 and Centronics 50-pins
connectors are given.

LIKES

Speed, reliability, the manual and good software.

DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

Difficult installation (possibility of damaging the Cyberstorm, strange
location of the controller PCB, two-PCB design, cable rerouting problem)
and the shareware edition of the AmiCDFS filing system.

I know that in order to keep the price of the Cyberstorm down, phase 5 have
decided to provide the SCSI-controller as a separately available option. 
There is nothing wrong with such a design, but more thought should have
gone to the problem of installation.  I sincerely hope a Mk III will take
care of this.

A registered version (or at least a discount) for the AmiCDFS filing system
should be included as a standard.

The SCSIControl3 program (partitioning) can do with a more user-friendly
user interface and a verify option.  A selector for #?scsi.devices and a
RDB-backup option could make interesting additions.

COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

Since I don't have extensive experience with SCSI-2 controllers, and tests
in magazines were done with different setups (notably different hard
disks), I cannot present an objective opinion.  Sorry!

BUGS

Various typos in the manual, plus one small bug in the partitioning
program.

VENDOR SUPPORT

phase 5 is not exactly fast when it comes to handling email.  I suggest you
phone or fax the company if you want a quick(-ish?) answer.

WARRANTY

phase 5 have devoted quite a lot of text to the issue of warranty.  I will
summarize the text in this document, but please refer to the original in
case this becomes a necessity.  I accept no responsibility when this
summary and the original text differ!

You get a 6 month guarantee, during which phase 5 will replace or repair
your module free of cost if the card was broken due to material or
production faults.  Excluded are faults caused by `outside interference':
improper usage, unauthorized repair or modifications and addition of new
hardware and software.  This includes SCSI-devices, but upgrades of the
_system_ hard- and software as well!  AmiCDFS and the supplied other
programs form no exception.

phase 5 takes no warranty what so ever about the applicability of the
CyberSCSI Mk II; the company also does not hold itself responsible in case
of data loss, even when it has been warned about the possibility in
advance.

In case of problems you are instructed to turn to your dealer for
assistance first.  phase 5 will only accept returns when they have been
assigned a so-called RMA-number; this number is given to you when the
support department sees justifiable cause for you to return the module to
phase 5.

CONCLUSIONS

The moment you've all been waiting for.  The Note.  I Have Decided (c'mon,
allow a guy his moment of glory for once :)) on 4.5 out of 5.  The
installation is a bitch, and not without risk to other hardware, but once
everything is in place, the module performs as any piece of hardware
should: reliably and speedy.  The manual is clear and packed with useful
information.  A very good addition to any Cyberstorm Mk II.

   (both are IDE)
Cybervision 64 (4 MB video memory, CyberGFX v40.64)
GVP I/O Extender (v1.8)

INSTALLATION

Installing a new CPU module in a 4000 is tricky, because you'll have to
remove quite a bit of hardware in order to have easy access to the CPU
slot.  I have no clue as to how the situation is with the other computers,
but have your dealer or a qualified engineer install the board for you in
case you're not comfortable about opening up the Amiga by yourself.

The Mk II module differs substantially from its predecessor.  The Mk I was
made up of at least three PCBs: a carrier board, a CPU board and a memory
board.  The fourth board, containing the SCSI option, could be added
separately.  The carrier board featured a second-level cache of 512 KB.
All of this made for a rather difficult install: all of the reviews I read
mention the author rasping his knuckles or transfixing his fingers.

The Mk II design is far simpler.  In its basic configuration, the module
consists of just one PCB, which houses both CPU and memory slots.  The
second level cache has vanished, since it was hardly ever used anyway.
Only the separate SCSI module has remained, which will be dealt with in a
separate review.

Before you open up your Amiga, check if you have a 68040.library installed
in your LIBS: directory.  You can find one on any original 2.04 or higher
Workbench disk set.  (Since Kickstart 1.3- do not support the 68040,
anything might happen if you try to use these versions of the OS.  Be
careful.)

The installation process indeed looks simple too: only three pages of text
and photographs are devoted to installing your new gadget in your computer.
The process is only described for a 4000, so you are on your own when it
comes to the 3000(T).  However, as an addtional step I would recommend
removing the front drive bay, since it facilitates access to the CPU-slot
considerably, especially if you have big hands.

There are a few things worth mentioning.  According to the manual, a
ventilator is included with the card; this is not the case anymore.  The
68040 now only bears a cooling fin [heat sink].  This fin gets quite hot
during operation; take care that no plastic cables touch it!  Second, a
leaflet has been provided stating that reliable operation of Zorro III
DMA-devices in all 3000 models is not possible due to a flaw of the
mainboard, and that DMA-capable additions to the Cyberstorm (in other
words, the CyberSCSI Mk II module) will be affected by this problem as
well.  However, I have heard that you can solve this by upgrading the
custom chips Buster and Gayle (or Gary?), but please check this out with
your dealer or someone who knows the hardware of a 3000.

In any case, I strongly recommend you read the manual thouroughly before
opening up the Amiga.

REVIEW

The Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let me start off by answering a few questions which have surely risen by
now.

The 'ERC' means 'Eco Recycling' -- basically this means the processor on
the board has been used before.  Not only does this help the environment by
keeping an otherwise prefectly functional 68040 from going to the garbage
dump, it also keeps the price of the chip down (and thus the price of the
entire module).  Of course, every chip is thoroughly tested by phase 5
before it is sold.  It should be born in mind that 'ERC' has nothing to do
with the familiar 'EC' and 'LC' abbreviations often found with Motorola
CPUs.

While on the subject, the CPU found on the Mk II module is a full 68040.
That means that both the floating point unit (FPU) and the memory
management unit (MMU) are present and functional.  (The LC version omits
the FPU, the EC version both FPU and MMU.) This means you can run programs
like Enforcer and GigaMem or even the Unix clones NetBSD and Linux/m68k,
which all require an MMU.

With everyone turning to the 68060, you may wonder why I decided on a
68040.  Simply put, I do not run the software which requires a 68060, like
rendering or image processing programs.  I program a lot, but I found that
I spend far more time editing (and crashing) than compiling.  And no 68060
will aid in speeding _me_ up.  I can make quite an extensive list of what I
do with my Amiga, but the bottom line remains that I was happy with the
speed which the 68EC030 offered, 20% of the time it being too slow.  In my
opinion, buying a 68060 in this case is expensive overkill.  Plus it helps
the environment a little bit, but that of course does not take the power
consumption of the 68040 into account...  :-).

After installation, I switched on the computer and waited.  I could
establish some speedup while the Amiga booted, but it was not a `WOW'
experience.  Various system information programs (SysInfo, AIBB 6.5,
ShowConfig) showed the presence of a full 68040.  Since the presence of an
FPU could be established, I had to have a full MMU as well; this was
confirmed by Lawbreaker.  (Lawbreaker is a utilility to see if your Amiga
is capable of running Enforcer.  If you have an MMU, Lawbreaker generates 4
Enforcer hits, if not, less.)

Memory Upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I will deal with the software side of memory in the next section, but you
should be aware of the fact that the SIMM slots might not be able to take
any kind of double-sided SIMM.  I was rather unpleasantly surprised when I
found out the double-sided 8 MB SIMMs I borrowed from my mothers PC would
not fit: the memory chips met the rim of the slot before the `click
mechanism' could get a grip on the module.  I did not have other SIMMs to
see whether this problem would always occur, but I recommend to use 4 or 16
MB sizes when in doubt: they are populated at one side of the PCB only.

Another point you should be aware of is that memory slot 4 is located under
the front drive bay, and is completely inaccessible.  In other words: if
you want to populate this slot, you'll have to remove the drive bay (or the
Cyberstorm).  In my opinion, this is totally unnecessary, since there is
plenty of space to move the four slots so that they take the room of three.

AIBB Speed Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because I had forgotten to test the speed of my machine before I installed
the Cyberstorm, I have no hard data relating to the old situation to
present here.  I dislike moving hardware around more than strictly
necessary, and considering the rather tight fit of the card (it really
snaps into place) I decided to leave it where it was.  I did have a few
AIBB modules of the A3000 (68030 at 25 MHz) and a Cyberstorm Mk I (68040 at
40 MHz) available, so I decided to use these.  The A3000 is equivalent to
the 4000/030, but tends to be a bit (usually about 5%) faster when access
to memory is concerned.  And it is of course slower in the graphics tests.

Ok, let's discuss these (inherently questionable) values.  The differences
between the Mk I and II are in most cases completely irrelevant.  I doubt
that you will notice them in practice.  That is not the case for
memory-intensive jobs, however.  According to these data, the speed at
which the Mk II accesses its memory is decidedly lower than that of the Mk
I.  Since a lot of the work I do is memory-intensive I found these results
to be rather disappointing.  (The 'low' speed was confirmed by another
program called Bustest, which measures the transfer speed to all types of
memory, using byte, word and longword accesses.  I have used both Bustest
and AIBB on various systems, and their results are always close to
eachother.)

The ensuing discussion on Usenet showed that phase 5 always operate the
SIMMs at 70 ns, regardless of the type installed.  So I could in fact be
measuring the difference between 60 and 70 ns memory here.  However, since
most SIMMs are 60 ns these days, I find it hard to accept that a company
like phase 5 does not make use of this fact.

A second reason the speeds differ so much could be due to the Mk I module
using its second-level cache; AIBB does not store this information in its
files.  Whatever the reason, the Mk II definitely has a slower design,
which is a shame.

Despite this flaw, the other results are impressive.  Of course, the
increased clock speed and the CopyBack cache help to boost performance as
well, but it's the result that counts.  The integer speed has on average
increased by a factor four.  One can clearly notice this: the response of
the Amiga is snappier and during CPU-intensive tasks a lot of the usual
jerkiness (unfortunately still present on a 68030) has vanished.

Another interesting fact is the floating point speed.  A 68882 is not
exactly slow, yet it is beaten time and time again by the 68040's internal
FPU and the software emulation of unimplemented instructions.  I therefore
expect a `noticeable' speedup in floating point intensive programs.

Real World Impressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first application I tried is notorious for its demand for speed:
Metafont.  Metafont is a program which transforms a program-like
description of a glyph (any character you see in print or on-screen) into a
bitmap, so it can be printed.  On average, a font (i.e., a complete set of
glyphs) took about 90 seconds on my 68030.  My new system requires about 30
seconds for the same font.  Additionally, I expect the situation to improve
a little when I switch to a SCSI-2 based filing system; Metafont requires a
lot of file access and IDE can slow things down considerably.

TeX was of course next.  TeX is a typesetting program: it transforms plain
ASCII text containing control sequences into typeset text.  It's like a
WYSIWIG word processor, but then with you _writing_ what the text should
look like.  I ran my Masters thesis (90 pages) through this program.  Pages
were generated at a `chee, this goes fast' rate.  I got the feeling the
computer was actually doing something; the 68030 definitely required more
time to build a page.  Pages containing lots of formulas still have a small
pause, but this is hardly noticeable.

The next program I tried was Ghostscript.  Ghostscript is a screen-based
PostScript-interpreter, meaning it shows your PostScript file on screen
instead of on paper.  Ghostscript requires a lot of calculations to build
the display.  The speed at which this now occurs was cause for the first
`WOW'.  Text-based PostScript files are built up faster than the eye can
follow; graphics appear with a slight pause (the famous Tiger takes about 4
seconds on my Cybervision), but nevertheless at a very workable rate.

At this point I decided to switch from OS-friendly to not-so OS-friendly
programs.  I unleashed my (small) collection of demos and games onto the
Cyberstorm.  As I expected, some of the demos crashed in record time; these
included Origins Motion and Complex, Kefrens Desert Dream and Silents Demon
Download (oldies, I know :)).  Others kind-of worked (Faculty's Lethal Dose
2, Silents Ice, Andromeda's Nexus 7).  And the few that did work did not
contain many of my favourites.  I was a bit disappointed at the modern
stuff; are there really that little 68040's in Demoland?

My games collection was already diminished to almost nothing after I bought
my A4000/030; therefore I expected little problems.  Populous 2,
Rock`n'Roll, Civilization and Frontier (to name a few) worked ok.  At this
point I would like to point out that not all _old_ stuff fails to run:
games like Defender of the Crown, Power Drift and Impact ran without even
touching the caches.  The rule here seems to be that if it can run on a
68030 (if necessary without caches) it will probably run on a 68040 as
well.  However, be prepared to reduce your (illegal??!) collection even
further.  (I wish to mention one strange exception here: Power Drift.  On
my 68030, I needed to Kickback into 1.3 to get this game working, with the
68040, it functions flawlessly under 3.0 -- it even has become much harder
to play!)

I already mentioned that Kickstart 1.3- and the 68040 do not like each
other.  I never got round to testing this, because none of the available
softkickers and degrading tools succeeded in starting up the Amiga with
1.3.  In other words: if the startup control screen fails, you can kiss the
program goodbye.

Next were the C-compilers I normally use: SAS/C 6.50 and gcc 2.7.2.1.
(Compiling C is a process which is highly dependent on the speed of your
hard disk as well, so the times presented are not solely the effect of the
Cyberstorm.) SAS/C is a speedy compiler, but with a 68040 under the hood it
really screams through sources.  130 KB of complex C-code (interpret.c from
the MudOS v22b24 sources, ftp://ftp.imaginary.com/pub/LPC/driver/beta) was
compiled in just under 20 seconds.  It required 90 seconds on my 68030.
With the relatively small programs (<50 KB of source) I normally write, the
compile time is therefore reduced to almost nothing.

gcc of course requires more time.  The aforementioned MudOS sources
compiled in 75 minutes on my 68030; the Cyberstorm system requires 35
minutes.  When optimization is turned off, the required amount of time is
reduced to 28 minutes.  A lot of time is wasted because the compiler and
the appropriate include files need to be reloaded time and time again.  The
compiler is also much slower than SAS/C: the interpret.c file requires 45
seconds without and 2 minutes and 15 seconds with optimisation to compile!

At this time I decided it was time to test the GVP I/O Extender.  The first
connections with my provider (Term 4.7a 020+ and AmiTCP 4.0 demo) worked
ok.  There were a few errors during a ZModem download, but I contributed
those to wrong buffersizes.  However, I quickly changed my opinion when I
found out that a direct 115k2 connection with my mothers PC lead to
complete serial garbage and huge amounts of transfer errors when I tried to
get something _to_ the Amiga.  I spent hours trying to discover the cause
of the problem, and eventually managed to track down the culprit: the good
ole' CopyBack cache of the 68040.  (This on-chip cache buffers writes to
memory, as to speed up the processor.  However, if a program requires that
data and looks at the memory to find it, it will use _old_ data and thus go
completely wrong.) When I turned off the cache, the problem vanished.  This
is not mentioned by either phase 5 or the manual of Term.  After the cache
problem had been solved, I could use the I/O Extender without further
problems.

Then it was time for some old-fashioned image processing using Photogenics
Lite.  This presented an unexpected problem.  I never used the program
because my 68030/68882 combination was far too slow for this type of work.
(Hence the fact that I can't present data on other programs -- I don't have
them :-)).  The speed of the Cyberstorm proved to be adequate, but during
the session I found out that image processing can be very fun.  The
hitherto impressive speed of the 68040 became a kind-of annoying pain, and
for the first time I wished I had bought a 68060 or a (yet to be released)
PowerPC.  Serious image processing requires huge amounts of raw computing
power, and in my opinion, the more the better.  If your main application is
image processing, the Cyberstorm 040 is _not_ your ideal purchase.

I could go on and on about the various programs I tried, but I think I have
written enough for now.  The main conclusions which can be drawn from these
tests is that the Cyberstorm gives your Amiga a solid and very noticeable
performance boost.  Software compatibility is very good if you stick to
OS-legal stuff, and not so good if you don't.  In some cases, other
hardware may become the bottleneck, and it would be wise if you spent your
money to remove these before buying more CPU power.

DOCUMENTATION

The documentation is good, if a bit short.  There are several errors in the
English text which are a little annoying considering the total amount of
documentation.  The documentation was written with the 68060 in mind and
therefore some of the steps can be skipped: phase 5 indicate this on a
separate leaflet which could have contained more information on the 68040
as well.

The disk which is distributed with the 68060-version is not present.  This
is a bit annoying, since it contains a number of interesting utilities.
phase 5 will give you a copy if you upgrade to a 68060, though.

LIKES

Speed, transparent presence, reliability, recycling of a 68040, simplicity
of the module in comparison with its predecessor, price.

DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

Slow memory interface, trouble with double-sided SIMMs, position of the
fourth SIMM slot, lack of a CPU-cooler, short documentation, lack of disk.

I didn't notice the `slow' memory interface in practice, because the speed
of the card is still far above what I was used to.  However, it is simply a
shame to waste computing cycles in order to save a few bucks.

I have one suggestion: get rid of these flaws!

COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

I have never used other 68040-based cards, so a comparison based on
experience is not possible.  However, if I compare the literature with what
I have seen and experienced so far, and neglect the SCSI-2 options found on
all cards, the Mk II does not make it to the top three.  Alas!  This is
simply because other cards (for example the Warp Engine, the Cyberstorm Mk
I and the Apollo) have faster memory interfaces, which basically determine
the maximum speed at which the CPU can process instructions.

Only when used in combination with the accompanying SCSI-2 module does the
Cyberstorm Mk II start to shine.  Also, please note that the Mk I and the
Warp Engine are not available any more.

BUGS

None found.  Or perhaps one, but I cannot be sure.  After a _real_ long day
of hard work, my Amiga all of a sudden locked up when I wanted to redo an
image in Photogenics Lite.  I attribute this to a heat problem, though: it
had been awfully warm in my room and my computer had been working at huge
loads for the entire day.

VENDOR SUPPORT

Well, as we all know, phase 5 are not famous for their responsiveness
concerning e-mail.  During the test, I have sent the company several
messages, all of which remained unanswered after two weeks.  My advice
would be to phone or fax them, but I have not tried this.

WARRANTY

phase 5 have devoted quite a lot of text to the issue of warranty.  I will
summarize the text in this document, but please refer to the original in
case this becomes a necessity.  I accept no responsibility when this
summary and the original text differ!

You get a 6 month guarantee, during which phase 5 will replace or repair
your module free of cost if the card was broken due to material or
production faults.  Excluded are faults caused by `outside interference':
improper usage, unauthorized repair or modifications and addition of new
hardware and software.  This includes upgrades of the _system_ hard- and
software!

phase 5 takes no warranty what so ever about the applicability of the
Cyberstorm Mk II; the company also does not hold itself responsible in case
of data loss, even when it has been warned about the possibility in
advance.

In case of problems you are instructed to turn to your dealer for
assistance first.  phase 5 will only accept returns when they have been
assigned a so-called RMA-number; this number is given to you when the
support department sees justifiable cause for you to return the module to
phase 5.

CONCLUSIONS

The moment you've all been waiting for: the note.  After a bit of thought I
settled on 4 out of 5.  The card itself is well-made and works as it should
(and quite fast at that), but in my opinion there are too many small flaws
in this design which could easily have been avoided.  The card is not the
ideal purchase for image processing freaks, but if you are looking for
reliability and reasonable power at an affordable (even cheap-ish) price,
this card is the one for you.

===========================================================================
              Review: Civilization CD from Guildhall Leisure
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Civilization was one of the first major computer gaming hits of the 90s.
Like many of Microprose's games, it's a rather broad undertaking.
Microprose has attempted to make a number of "true to life" simulations of
war machines, but in this game it's an attempt to simulate the formation
and development of a civilization.  Obviously, they cut a few corners here
and there.

Guildhall Leisure has a license to republish virtually all of Microprose's
catalog of Amiga games on their Acid Software label.  Civilization is their
first attempt to publish a CD-ROM on the Amiga as well.  The particulars of
this re-release will be addressed at the end of the review.

For those of you who haven't played it in the 5 years since its release,
Civilization puts you in the role of a small group of settlers whose first
task it is to found a capital city for your civilization.  From that city,
you grow food, build military units and important buildings, feed your
people so they can have children and make your empire bigger, and go on to
start more cities.  Meanwhile, a number of computer opponents are doing the
same thing.  

(The game is single-player although I've played it with other people and
it's quite fun.  The new FreeCiv which can be played over the net can help
you if you're looking for a multiplayer game like Civilization.)

Civilization takes a long time to play and is pretty addictive.  There are
a number of different difficulty levels as well as a number of different
strategies you can try to use.  For example, you will inevitably encounter
rival civilizations who have the same goal as you--being the world's best
civilization.  You can take a very militant and aggressive position with
them, or attack only out of self-defense.  It is very possible to take over
other civilizations' cities, but the game is more challenging if you don't.

The level of complexity in Civilization is just about right.  One of my
gripes with world-simulations (or park simulations, see Theme Park) is that
you sometimes have to do so much micro-managing, particularly after your
city/empire/park starts growing, that the game is no longer any fun.
Civilization is pretty good about that sort of thing.  You make work
assignments to your citizens by assigning them to work on plots of land
around your cities (which reap different rewards, depending on the terrain
and how much you've developed it), and by assigning settler units to
develop and improve the land around your cities.  It's enough to keep you
interested throughout the entire game, but not so bad that you're killing
yourself trying to keep up with every little person there is.

One of the most rewarding parts of Civilization is research.  Your
civilization starts with only the most basic of skills and abilities--it
is, after all, only 4000 BC.  But you can assign your wise men to work on
new technologies, and as they discover their secrets you can build more and
better buildings and military units.  You can also trade (or demand, or be
shaken down for) technology with other civilizations, and early in the game
you might discover a "scroll of ancient wisdom" which immediately bestows a
technology on you.  The only down side is that the technologies available
in the game only stretch into the present day and a bit beyond (to
technologies it seems reasonable that humans will master in the not too
distant future.)  If you're a very good Civilization player, you'll expend
these technologies and be stuck researching "Future Tech", which earns you
Civilization Points but nothing new in the game.

The ultimate goal of civilization is to colonize another planet.  You never
do this directly, but late in the game you'll be able to start building
components for a vast interstellar spacecraft which can carry your people
to the stars.  Wiping out the other civilizations is another possible goal.

Civilization is a lot of fun.  There, that's clear.

Guildhall has placed both the ECS and AGA versions of Civilization on the
CD-ROM, and they can be run directly.  (In fact, there's no HD install
option, although it would be pretty easy to do it yourself by just
modifying their startup script.)  The AGA version is the prettier, and
implements more of the animation found on the PC version.  Unfortunately,
because the game seems to insist on running on a DBLNTSC 256 color screen,
it's quite slow, even on our test 040/40 machine.  I tried a number of
methods to persuade the game to run in a different mode but they failed.
Part of the delay is in the relative slowness of a 256 color DBL screen,
another part is in the excessively long screen fades the game uses.  If
you're an experienced Civ player or don't care much about pretty graphics,
I strongly recommend using the ECS version--it's much, much faster.

Guildhall hasn't made any real marked improvement to the game short of
making it playable from CD.  The extremely uncomfortable save-game scheme
is still there (you can save the game, but only to the root directory on a
device or partition, and if your partition list is too long the game gets
confused).

What is nice (and was part of Guildhall's license agreement with
Microprose) is that there's still a full printed manual and a color box.
The manual is not notably different from Microprose's old manual (except
the cover is white, not black, with black type instead of gold).  This is
nice in general, and important since Civilization has documentation
protection.  Call me a hypocrite seeing that I'm an online magazine editor,
but having printed documentation is tough to beat.

Civilization is a modern classic, and plays quite well on the Amiga.  It
predates the popularity of RTG so you're pretty much stuck with your Amiga
chipset, but for UKP15 (around US$24, but the pound keeps getting stronger
against most other currencies) it's still a good value.  I hope to see more
CD products from Guildhall--perhaps next time around they'll consider a
multi-game disc.

           The Emulation Rambler: Fallout from PCx vs.  PC-Task
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Very rarely does an article in AR generate so much instant feedback from
readers...here's a sampling of the important or interesting notes gleaned
from last issue's review.  I've included comments and replies where
appropriate.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

From David P. Crandall, dpc@crl.com

THANK YOU!

I've been longing for a decent comparative review of these two products for
a long time!  I wonder about its accuracy though.  The current PCx demo
version is 2.1 - your review is of PCx 1.1.  I don't know if this would
make a difference, or if there were any significant changes to PCx, but one
would think that the newer version would be better.

I would greatly appreciate an updated review.

Furthermore, your conclusions suggest that PC-Task can operate at speeds
approximating half that of a real Pentium 100 (on a sufficiently beefed up
machine - as mine is - see my signature for details).  If this is true,
then it should have little trouble handling Windows 95 (although it may be
a little slow).  Have you tried Windows 95 on PC-Task? 

I ask because there are a couple small utility programs (WIN95 only) which
I need to run at home for my work.  I would rather spend some money on
adding 32 Megs or ram, CrossDOS 6, and PC-Task 4.2 to my Amiga than buying
another whole computer, but I wonder if this solution is feasible.  Any
thoughts?


My reply:

-    PCx's demo versions are numbered along a totally different scheme than
     the PCx release version.  So at the time I did the review (and still
     today) PCx 1.1 is the most up to date version there is.

     The benchmarks in the review should not be misinterpreted to suggest
     that either emulator can approach half of a P100's speed in real world
     applications.  And furthermore, neither emulator can run Win95.  I
     should have made this more clear, my apologies.  -Jason

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Emmanuel Latour, emmanuel.latour@geac.com 

In your AR506 issue which reviews both of these emulators, you don't
mention that PCx cannot run Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode, which I believe
PC-Task 4.x can.

Also, you might want to take a closer look at serial emulation, it simply
does not work and I have gotten Jim Drew to admit to it.  He claimed that
the same is true for PC-Task 4.x and that this will be fixed in the
upcoming 2.0 version.

I tried both the PCx 1.1 and PC-Task 4.x demos and eventually bought PCx
many months ago.  The new PCx 4.2 demo now hangs on both my 4000T even with
a clean boot (no startup-sequence).

Although I agree that PCx is faster, its lack of full support for GFX
boards, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode or communications programs, has become
a major annoynance for me.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Jim Drew, msdei@ctaz.com (author of PCx)

Hi, just read your review of PCx vs.  PC-Task, and I must correct some
mistakes and ask some questions:

-------------

"Hardfiles are inefficient but useful-in-a-pinch ways to set up hard drive
compatibility--they're large AmigaDOS files which the program treats as a
physical device.  PC-Task and PCx also support real, dedicated partitions,
a much better choice.  Unfortunately, they do not share formats, and PCx's
is a custom filesystem, as opposed to a CrossDOS filesystem as PC-Task
uses."

Not true.  PCx uses MS-DOS format.  CrossDOS uses its own custom format,
which is not completely compatible with MS-DOS.  However, PCx *can* use
PC-Task hardfiles if you make DOS Drivers for them.

--------------

"The CD-ROM compatibilities are not equal.  PC-Task has a decided edge.  
Very often, a CD would be recognized perfectly by the AmigaOS and by
PC-Task but PCx would refuse to read it.  This frustration is compounded by
another advantage PC-Task has over PCx: the ability to copy between PC and
Amiga drives at the PC prompt using special tools included with the
emulator.  That means if you can't read a CD on the PCx side, you're stuck
using clunky floppies to transfer data across."

Egads!  Not true!  We support the mounting of any PCx hardfile or partition
as an AmigaDOS (CrossDOS) device, and even provide the ability to create
the DOS Driver.  People are just using DOpus or the CLI to copy files just
fine.

Also, the CD-ROM problems you apparently experience have never been
reported by *any* customers, so I am not sure what we can do about this
problem...  I went out and bought the programs you had problems with and
they worked fine.  :-\

--------------

"Both offer sound emulation of the PC speaker.  PCx goes further to
implement a partial SoundBlaster emulation.  It's an improvement, and will
be nicer when it's complete."

Huh?  The SoundBlaster emulation is complete.  It is just v1.0
SoundBlaster, which did not have the FM Synth mode, and was mono only.  We
will have SoundBlaster Pro 16 support (via AHI) in v2.0.

---------------

"In terms of compatibility, the major differences in compatibility come in
identifying their graphical capabilities to programs.  Modern PC programs
should have no trouble, but older programs which hit hardware may get
confused.  The King's Quest games are not fully compatible on either
emulator, for example.  But on the processor level, both emulators are very
well set up for what they're doing."

Please explain the problem with King's Quest!  You sent that to me and it
works *exactly* the same under PCx as it does my Gateway 2000 and IBM
ThinkPad!  What more do you want!?  ;-)

---------------

"PCx is somewhat cheaper than PC-Task--about US$20.  And you do get a lot
of emulator.  On the other hand, PC-Task 4.2 has the look and feel of a
more complete product.  The CyberGraphX support is wholehearted, the CD-ROM
driver works better, and the hard drive integration with the Amiga is much
better."

[Jim expresses a complaint about my evaluation of the competing prices
here, which I'll explain in my reply.]

Please explain the 'hard drive integration' comment!

I am sure glad the general public doesn't feel the same way about PCx.
:-)


My Reply:

-    First off, I have to admit the fact that I made a straightforward
     error in my comment on price.  At the time the article was written
     the price difference was actually substantially more than US$20
     through most PC-Task dealers.  However, the price of PC-Task 4.2 has
     actually fallen notably since then.  Software Hut now sells it for $95
     (a $35 difference in price, more than the $20 gap I mistakenly
     reported), but Visionsoft is advertising PC-Task 4.2 for $70.  So
     while I was indeed very wrong when the article was written, the market
     seems to be shifting to accomodate my error.  :)

     Jim challenges a number of my assertions about PCx's partition
     handling.  But in my e-mail exchanges with him where I asked him
     directly to point me to the sections of the manual which outline
     doing what he suggests (sharing partitions with PC-Task, reading
     PCx partitions from AmigaDOS), he neglected on more than one
     occasion to show me.

     Oh, and the newest PCx video drivers purport to fix the King's Quest
     bug (although it was a two-step process, a very interesting bug showed
     up once Jim fixed the video display issue).  Chalk another one up for
     PCx, then.  :)

@node REVIEW7 "Silent Service II"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
             Review: Silent Service II from Guildhall Leisure
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

I'm certainly not what you'd call a "war movie buff."  But for some reason,
I enjoy a good submarine movie.  Sure, I know that in real life they're
cramped, smoky, and stinky, but for some reason it seems to be difficult to
do a bad submarine movie.

So I was somewhat enthusiastic when I opened the long-awaited box of
goodies from Guildhall Leisure, to mark the first bundle of their
Microprose re-releases I'd been sent, and found Silent Service II, a game
of submarine warfare in the Pacific during World War II.

Silent Service II dates back to 1990, and is itself a rework and updating
of the original, from the 8-bit era, back when Sid Meier really DID write
all of Microprose's software.

SSII puts you at the helm of an American submarine.  Your goal is to sink
as many Japanese vessels as you can and get home alive.  It doesn't exactly
sound easy and it's made worse by the fact that submarines are not the most
maneuverable ships in the ocean.  You have stealth on your side, but once
your cover is blown the Japanese navy has pretty good odds of blowing you
out of the water.

The game takes place in one of three modes.  In the most basic, you command
a submarine for a single battle, either taken from a historical pool or
generated at random.  The battle ends when either you or the Japanese
convoy you're attacking have been destroyed, or one side has successfully
fled the combat zone.

A bigger commitment is a single patrol, where you take a submarine from a
US port into an assigned zone of Japanese-controlled waters, searching and
waiting for contacts to pursue.  And even more demanding is a "war career",
where you begin the war at the date of your choosing (starting with the
bombing of Pearl Harbor) and end either when Japan surrenders or you are
lost at sea.

As you might expect, making all this visually appealing is a bit of a
challenge.  After all, when you're submerged you only have a periscope, and
when you're on the surface, well, submarines don't like to spend lots of
combat time on the surface.  So in the game, you rely quite a bit on a
chart which represents your position and the position and movement of other
vessels as lines on a grid.  The game tries to be authentic, but not TOO
authentic--the chart is updated in real time, not by a pencil or
marker-wielding crewman.

Microprose always aimed for authenticity in their simulations, and the game
adheres to the history of the war, making only certain boats or torpedo
model choices available when they are appropriate to the real course of
events.  You can only have radar, for example, when the US Navy started
installing it in submarines--and the Japanese only have it when they
started installing it reliably.

When you're not looking at the charts, you'll probably want to look out
your periscope.  Why?  To lock on to targets and shoot torpedoes at them,
of course!  The enemy vessel graphics are actually digitized shots of a war
historian's painstakingly recreated models of the ships Japan used during
the war.  But seeing as how this is an ECS game, the digitized shots are
greyscale, and all too often turn out to be all-alike looking grey blobs,
which is what usually happened when game designers used digitized shots on
16-color screens.

I found the action in the game to be sufficiently edifying if I was in the
right state of mind.  Mood lighting might be appropriate here--if you've
got some blue or red cellophane lying around, try putting it in front of a
lone light bulb.  (I haven't tried that yet, but it sounds like a good
idea.)

The game play is interrupted by tedious cut-scenes of torpedo launches or
depth charge explosions, which you can and should shut off.

There's a lot of strategy and patience required to really play this game
well.  If you just waltz up to a convoy of 8 Japanese vessels and shoot off
a few torpedoes, you'll find fast patrol boats overhead blowing you up in
no time.  Thankfully, there are accelerate-time options to make plotting an
ambush a little more bearable.

SS II is not the instant gratification of a SubWar, it strives to be much
closer to the real thing.  I found it pretty good fun.  I was also
substantially impressed that the game worked without problems on my
060-equipped 4000T, although I couldn't get the hard drive installer to
work to save my life.  SS II only requires that you make copies of the main
2 disks before playing, and once you're in the heat of battle there's no
loading (except cutscenes which as I said you should shut off.)  A full
printed manual and a flimsy keyboard cutout are provided, but after a few
hours of playing you should have the hang of the controls well enough to
set it aside.

For UKP15 (about $24) I could probably recommend one or two better games
for casual playing, but SS II is pretty good fun.  A bit limited after a
while since in the long run it's the same sequence of events over and over,
but there are enough really big fish in the sea to provide a challenge, if
you decide you're man enough to take on an aircraft carrier.

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in

the list, send Email to majordomo@ninemoons.com

Your subject header will be ignored.  In the body of the message, enter

The system will automatically pull your e-mail address from the message
header.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **

                          UUDecoding Amiga Report
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

     4.  Please send us your article in ASCII format.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.

Please stipulate as well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to
the editor.

AMIGA ZONE MOVES TO CALWEB!

THE AMIGA ZONE MOVES FROM PORTAL TO CALWEB INTERNET SERVICES

For over ten years the Amiga Zone has been an online resource, home,
community, oasis, for Amiga owners.

For over ten years I've made my living running the Zone and supporting Amiga
users all over the USA, Canada, and the world.

Five years ago when American People/Link pulled their own plug, we had to
find the Zone a new home and we found a good one on the Portal Online
System. 

Well, it's happened again.. Portal has informed all of its customers that
its ten year history as an online service and Internet provider is coming to
an end on Sept. 30, 1996.  This is very sad, it's short-notice, and the
decision is completely out of my control, but it's also irreversible.  

Portal is changing its entire business plan from being an ISP to selling an
accounting system to other online services.  

So be it. It's sad, but like I said, the Zone went through this before and
now we'll go through it again, and come out the other side better and wiser.

THE AMIGA ZONE IS MOVING TO CALWEB INTERNET SERVICES.

CalWeb (http://www.calweb.com) is a two year old Internet provider located
in Sacramento, CA.  It has a good sized customer base, and very
knowledgeable support staff. 

It's also run by a long time Amiga owner who has been a friend of mine for
many years.

The world of modeming has changed much in the last ten years.  In 1985 you
had very few choices and you had 1200 baud.  These days, everyone and his
dog has an ISP running and a web page

But the vast majority of those providers don't know an Amiga from a hole in
the ground, and could care less about Amiga owners.  Say "AWeb" or
"IBrowse" to them and they'll say "Omega?  Amoeba?  What?  Huh?  They still
make those things?"

CalWeb is different because it's the new home of the Amiga Zone.

In October 1996, a new custom front-end menued system will be added to
CalWeb to host the Zone.  It'll have features for Zone users that neither
Plink nor Portal ever had nor were they willing to add.

The tradition of a friendly online Amiga community, run by long time Amiga
owners, users and lovers will continue. 

Message bases, huge file libraries (we plan to move over the 20,000+ files
we have on the Zone on Portal to CalWeb, MANY of which you'll never see on
Aminet or anywhere else), live nightly chats, vendor support and our famous
prize contests will continue.

We've given away tens of thousands of dollars worth of Amiga prizes in the
last ten years.  No one else even comes close. 

I urge any and all of you who were on Plink, or who are now on Portal or
who may have left Portal..  or even if you were never on either but used or
still use another online service to join CalWeb for the Amiga Zone.  I
personally promise you the best online Amiga community we can possibly
build.  You will not be disappointed.


CalWeb has arranged a special signup offer for you!

Call:
 1-800-509-9322
  or
 1-916-641-9320
  or telnet to calweb.com, login as "guest", and follow the prompts. 

You can join CalWeb for US$19.95 flat, a month.

CalWeb takes major credit cards or you can establish a monthly invoiced
account if you don't have plastic.

The signup is FREE.

To get this deal you must say "THE AMIGA ZONE SENT ME" when you call or
signup online. 

I hope to see lots of you join CalWeb.  You can telnet into it from
anywhere for no hourly charges at all.  Your $19.95/mo fee covers
everything and also gets you ten meg of storage which includes hosting your
own personal web page.  Naturally, when the Zone opens there, you'll have
unlimited use of all of its features and areas.  Never a "money meter"
clock to worry about.

Your personal or business CalWeb Web pages are maintained by you via FTP. 
It's pretty slick.  You can make a net connection to the server with any
Amiga FTP client, put your files onto it, the permissions are automatically
set (no "chmod-ing" required!) and flip to your running browser and see the
changes instantly.

The Amiga Zone's new home is already up at:

         http://www.amigazone.com

running on CalWeb's server.  Ckeck it out!

Please feel free to write to me at harv@amigazone.com or harv@cup.portal.com
if you want more information.

Remember to say "THE AMIGA ZONE SENT ME!" when you join.

A splendid time is guaranteed for all.  

Please plan to join us in the Amiga Zone on CalWeb!
