No news is [???] news!!!

You insert whatever you want in the brackets :)

Commodore is being pretty quiet about all this. I tried to get ahold 
of Hock Tan there at C= to no avail. The person I talked to stated
that he would be back next tuesday or wednesday.

The rumors are flying though!! Everything from HP is going to buy
Commodore to entertaining news that C= has dropped the Amiga line
and now makes microwave ovens.

Well if the last is true, I'm sure we'll be seeing some new products
from NewTek :)

Well, I'm going to pop some pizza in my Amiga and let you get on with
your reading! 

Take care!

AR Mailing List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No Official Amiga Report Distribution Site in your local calling area? Are
you tired of waiting for your local BBS or online service to get Amiga
Report each week?  If so, have we got a deal for you!

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report
in UUENCODED form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put
on the list, send Email to rniles@hebron.connected.com.  Your
account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact copy.
For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.

Many thanks to PORTAL Communications for setting this service up for us!

P.S.:  Please be sure to include your Email address in the text of your
request message, it makes adding it to the list much easier.  Thanks!

** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!

                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bridal Reflections Framestore 3D Image Processing Volume I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AUTHORS

    Michael Jaycox, JPV
    David Tiberio, Area52


        Bridal Reflections, Volume I, allows wedding videographers to
    create an openning and recap from saved Framestores. Using custom
    software, the original Framestores are converted into either the
    openning or recap, along with titles and a professional background.
    The videographer merely stores the desired Framestore, and our
    image processing software does the rest! In a few minutes, depending
    on the speed rating of your computer, the finished images will be
    done. The videographer may then use standard Toaster effects to
    perform transitions between the newly created Framestores. A free
    demo is available which requires Scala multimedia software, although
    256 color images are also included.

        More modules, featuring other themes, will be available in the
    future.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        This software requires the Video Toaster, and has been tested
    with Toaster 2.0 and 3.0.

PRICE

        The Bridal Reflections module and Framestore generator retails for
    $275. To order, send a check or money order for $275.00 + $2 shipping
    and handling to Area52, 6 Lodge Lane, East Setauket NY 11733.

AVAILABILITY

        Bridal Reflections will be shipping in March, 1994. Future modules
    will be announced as they become available. A demo will be made
    available on Aminet.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

        Bridal Reflections may be purchased from your local Video Toaster
    dealer. You may also order direct from Area52. Please send all
    correspondance to Area52, 6 Lodge Lane, East Setauket NY 11733.

SPACEBALLS and REALITY present SOMEWHERE IN HOLLAND II/AMICON '94
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
INTRODUCTION
------------
 
After the success of the Somewhere in Holland party, a sequel was
inevitable... and this time it's BIGGER and BETTER. From the 9th until
the 11th of July the SIH II - AmiCon 94 will take place in a hall the
size of a planet, with more features than you can shake a stick at!
Competitions, demos, graphics, music and more! For more information,
just read on...
 
 
THE MAIN HALL
-------------
 
We've got a great hall. With a size of 1800 m2 it will fit a thousand
freaks easily. Tina Turner once gave a concert there! Powerfailures
are a thing of the past, we have enough power to illuminate the entire
city of 's-Hertogenbosch. We will have a huge screen (6 x 4.5 metres)
and a very high quality LCD-projector for crystal-clear projection
of all demos, pictures, movies and more! And ofcourse we didn't forget
the sound.. 1600 Watts of music power to blow everybody's ears off!
 
 
SLEEPING HALL
-------------
 
You can get some rest in the sleeping hall, and there's showers and
other sanitary facilities for those who like to keep themselves fresh
& clean all the time... The sleeping hall measures about 500 m2
 
 
COMPETITIONS
------------
 
There will be 7 main competitions, each with a first, second and third
prize. The prizes are stated in Dutch Guilders and their approximate
equivalent in US Dollars.

(each category must have at least 6 entries. Only the first 30 entries
 in each category can compete. All entries must be solely made by the
 competitors. The Organisation retains its rights to refuse an entry,
 or check its origin. The Organisation retains the right to add
 further rules.)
 
Voting will be done using disks that are handed out at the entrance
(when you pay your entrance fee) so the results can be shown on the
big screen while we are counting the votes (just like they did at
The Party III in Herning, Denmark last december!)
 
 
INFLATABLE CASTLE!
------------------
 
Yes, there's even going to be an inflatable castle! You know, those
big and colorful castles where you have to take off your shoes (hint!)
and an airpressure pump irritates the hair off your scalp because it
keeps running day and night, and you can jump around with your newly
found scene-friends, and it gets really colorful because it already
was, and we might even set up a pair of speakers next to it and play
music to make people jump in sync.
 
 
WHERE IS IT?
------------
 
The partyplace is called "Sportcentrum Maaspoort" and is located in
the north of the city of 's-Hertogenbosch ('Den Bosch').
's-Hertogenbosch is in the south half of The Netherlands, and is quite
a large city, so you shouldn't have any problems getting there.
"Sportcentrum Maaspoort" is located where the A2 (an extension of the
E25) and the A59 meet. The route is clearly indicated after the exit
's-Hertogenbosch/Waalwijk. Its address is Burg. GodschalxStraat 63.
 
A non-stop bus will drive from the party to the railway station in 
the center of the city and back!
 
 
WHEN'S WHAT?
------------
 
The party is held at the 9th, 10th and 11th of July 1994. To keep it short,

Some more words from the organisation..
 
- There's 800 parking places for the party only!! So don't worry,
  you'll get your car parked :)
 
- The entrance fee will be Hfl30 for 3 days of great fun! That's
  not expensive is it? What have you got to lose? 
 
- The things said in this text are only those that are 99.9999% sure.
  This means there will be more fun things that the organisation is
  now busy organising, but we won't tell yet.. come and see !! :)
 
 
FOR MORE INFORMATION...
-----------------------
 
There's an invitation-intro on its way which will feature detailed
information about the party and how to get there. Try to get that
if you want to know more..
 
There also is a paper invitation and a smaller leaflet, but I used
the text of those to make this invitation, so you won't find many
new things in there (except... pictures! :)

With the flood of 24-bit video boards of all shapes, sizes, capabilities and
compatibilities, I decided someone needed to sort through the options and
present our readers with a clear, comprehensive picture of the strengths and
weaknesses of every board we could get our hands on.

The problem was, I didn't know exactly what sort of clear, comprehensive
view people were looking for.  I'm sure there are a LOT of questions, and
while it won't be much trouble for me to answer certain ones by my own
motivation (you can rest assured I'll put them through thorough Emplant and
A-Max IV paces), I can't read everyone's mind.

Here's the idea: send suggestions, questions, facts, or anything dealing with
Amiga video enhancer boards to me for the upcoming review series.  I, along
with video guy Mike Hoffman, will do our best to address the issues raised,
answer the asked questions, etc.  YOUR chance to find out the answer to YOUR
questions.

It's not that hard.  My net address appears all over the magazine.  But, if
you don't have access to anything that'll do Internetish mail, I can always be
reached at-
1203 Alexander Ave.
Streamwood, IL 60107-3003

So far, I have contacted GVP, MacroSystems US, DKB, and Expert Services.
Of these, only Expert Services has replied, with a one-month pledge of a
Picasso II board.  That leaves GVP's EGS Spectrum, MacroSystems Retina series,

Okay, so I've been asked to write a column for Amiga Report.

At first, I thought: "What about? I'm no writer - I'm not even an Amiga
expert in any sense of the word."

Then, as I began to think more and more seriously about it, I thought,
"Why not? Look at what's going on here: this is a magazine by, about, 
and for the Amiga community! What a great idea - a magazine without 
paper, distributed freely among the residents of a great community, 
within which live the very authors of the magazine itself." I was 
recruited by one of its insiders, practically a nieghbor of mine, on 
a local BBS. It doesn't get much better than that... so, I thought about
it, and here I am writing.

My handle probably influenced the request: I'm known in most places as
Videot, a name which gets as many confused questions as it does positive
responses, which shocks me somewhat, considering that many Amigoids are 
well aware of the video capabilities of their machines. I'm often referred
to simply as "video," as though I added the "t" to avoid duplicating 
someone else's handle. Such is not the case: I am VIDEOT - all the letters
belong there. It's pronounced VID - EE - UT, *not* "Video Tee"! It denotes
someone who is very much "into" video in all aspects: I have a laserdisc 
collection, several VCRs, a number of televisions of varying sizes, and a
good number of camcorders has passed in and out of my possession in the 
past eight years (from linear stereo VHS to VHS-C to S-VHS to my current 
baby: a Sony V-5000 Hi-8 camera and its companion GV-300 pseudo-Hi-8 Video
Walkman. I produce, with a partner, four cable-TV series that add up to 
five and a half hours of original programming each month in the Chicago 
area. The shows range from hour-long blocks of videos (supplied by record
companies) with in-studio host wraparounds to "unplugged"-style acoustic 
performances by Chicago bands to interviews with celebrity musicians from
all over the world.

All of this costs me very little (except for whatever equipment I choose
to purchase for personal reasons - I could sign out everything I need from
the studio, but I prefer to own my own equipment) and makes me nothing. I'm
not in it for the money, or even for the chance to meet celebrities. I'm in
it for the love of what I do - I'm carrying my "videot" label to the
extreme: no longer satisfied merely watching television (and, with what's 
on these days, who could be?), I need to create my own programming in order 
to feel good about myself.

Unfortunately, the studio where we produce our shows only has a very
weakly-endowed Video Toaster, so it serves very little use on our shows. 
It has the bare minimum RAM, HD space, and processor speed. It can only 
store five or six framestores and takes several minutes just to load one 
into ToasterPaint.

At home, however, I have MONSTER TOASTER, at least as 2000s go: I'm sure
I'll get a lot of flames for this, because I personally know people with
better systems than mine, but I'm happy knowing how well this one runs as
opposed to the one at the studio, and even the one at work (where we had 
the best setup I'd ever seen until I bought my own!)

  I was introduced to someone who was selling his Toaster 2000 system in
order to move up to the 4000, and bought a nice little system which, after
a few upgrades of my own, now stands as follows:

  A 33-mhz 68030-based A2000, 20 meg RAM + 2 meg Chip RAM; 46-meg HD (for
booting), a 1.2-gig HD (for Toaster & serious apps/storage), four floppy
drives (2 internal, and a dual-floppy external left over from my A-500
days), and a CD-ROM drive.

  I won't try to kid anyone: I'm not a gold-plated hacker. I didn't even
create my own sig block - I had a sysop on one of my BBSs create one for 
me. I do, however, know enough about computers to know what it takes to 
make one work well, and I have enough common sense to take advantage of 
"for sale" signs wherever possible. So, to those of you who are chip-heads
out there, I can only say "more power to you." I respect people who can 
dream of circuits and sawtooth waves, and who get as much out of watching 
an oscilloscope as I do watching Ren & Stimpy or Rocko's Modern World. But
I will say this much for myself: I don't take my handle for granted. I 
worked hard to be known as Videot, and would dare say I can out-edit any
MMU-designer or out-produce any wedding videographer this side of Silicon
Valley. I've paid me dues. I've shot dozens of weddings, retirement 
parties, and Bar Mitzvahs. I've interviewed bands both famous and 
infamous, and I've got the scarred XLR cables and the dents in my tripod 
to show for it. And I love it all... the smell of the oxide, the whiff of 
ozone from the fried sound board, the stinging pain of grabbing the 
business end of a quartz-halogen spotlight too soon after turning it off.
I've even had one explode in my hand. It wasn't pretty.

But all this really has very little to do with the Amiga, does it?

Well, okay, you've got me there. As I said before, I had no idea what to
write about. Sure, I've had my minor triumphs with the Video Toaster. I've
read the ads for the non-linear, tape-free editing systems, and - like the
other videots out there (sorry about the non-capitalization there, I like 
to reserve that for myself) I would love to take one of them for a test
drive. I'm looking forward to the Video Toaster Flyer and hope it doesn't 
become another Real-Soon-Now product like OpalVision's video add-ons.
  Other things I'd like to see are the video-card expansion systems I keep
seeing in those Amiga World ads - I think the worst two words in the human
language are "Coming Soon." Like the new Star Wars trilogy: Coming Soon 
has such a painful connotation! I want it *now*!

I was reluctant to write about what I already know because chances are you
know it, too. I could write one of those "auxilliary articles" about the
merits of using the right microphone type and placement, or about
three-point lighting, or the evils of backlighting, and I will if it is
what you want. I know there's always a need for that type of thing - I 
work at a high school as the AudioVisual Technical Assistant, and not a 
week goes by when a teacher asks me a question about video and I wonder 
how they ever were allowed to buy a camcorder in the first place. If 
you'd like, I could discuss the rule of thirds or the benefits of proper 
headroom, or the merits of a good tripod. You tell me.

But my suggestion is that I would like an opportunity to tell you about
things you might not know - why non-linear editing is such a great 
concept, why letterboxed pictures actually give you *more* picture and 
not less, what is Video Toaster 3.1 really like, what can the *average* 
user do with the Toaster or another 24-bit card... things you might not 
have had a chance to discover for yourself.

As I said before, I'm no writer. I'm not a journalism graduate, or even a
journalism *student* for that matter. My larval stage in computers came
around the same time it did for my video desires: in high school. I got a
Vic-20 at age 13, and was hooked ever since. Commodore computers came and
went for me, and in 1986 I got my Amiga and realized that computers were
great for video, and - as I simultaneously discovered my aptitudes for 
video editing and effects, I worked on learning all the Amiga had to offer
and how to incorporate it into my video "work." I got into cable 
production right out of high school, where I'd already spent all my free 
time in the school TV station - I was station manager as a senior. I got 
a job in data processing and spent all my free time working on programming
at the studio. My college was the school of hard knocks, and my diploma 
airs all over Chicagoland in the form of those music shows I mentioned 
earlier. Production values are king with me, and I love working on these 
programs more than anything else. And the more I can do with my computer, 
the better, although opportunities to put it to use there are limited. I'm
working on getting a grant to put a Toaster-based editing suite in the 
building. The one episode I edited using my own Toaster as the switcher/CG
was among the best work I've done, and - if the promise of the Flyer is 
fulfilled sometime soon, I can see a day when the show will be edited 
right here in my bedroom/office. That would be only fitting, since the 
Amiga answers the phone & fax for me already (PhonePak).

Wow, for a non-writer, I sure can pound it out, can't I?

Now that you know all about me, I'd like to know more about you: what do
you want me to write about? I'd be just as happy doing editorials as
reviews - and I'm equally inexperienced at writing tutorials and essays on
good vs. bad production values, so what the heck? Take your chances and
start throwing topics at me and I'll see what I can come up with.
  I want to be an honest and impartial writer, so the best way to start (I
suppose) is to write about what the readers want to read about, not what I
want to write about. So hit me with your best shot & let's see if I'm 
really worth reading!


FIRST GLANCE: Toaster 3.1

Well, fellow videots, I have *finally* received my Toaster 3.1 upgrade 
and installed it, to find that while its size (a mere six discs) is 
comfortable, its benefits are of equally small stature (for the most 
part).

Don't get me wrong - I am certainly not flaming 3.1! The CG upgrade alone
is well worth the effor of installing it (more on that later) but there 
are a few things I, personally, would love to have seen. Here is what I 
have discovered in a day's playing:

I'll steer clear of that which I don't know, and 3D is still very much
within that category. The ample paper support for this upgrade (NewTek 
must be spending a small fortune on printing and postage costs for this 
one, folks) includes an entirely new tutorial on the modeler software, 
so those of you who have what it takes to venture into that area will be 
pleased to know that they have a new teacher.

For what it's worth, I believe NewTek ought to include a bigger binder 
with the next upgrade. Mine's full!

The documentation screams about new effects - May's "Amiga World" says
there are "several new effects in the switcher." Really? They're certainly
not in the 3.0 bank! I should have taken a picture of my old switcher, but
the only changes I'd be willing to testify to are the restoration of a few
of 2.0's cooler effects (the split-globe fly-in and the "Death Star"
destruction, among others, with new and improved Croutons) and the overall
restructuring of the 2.0 bank: it's loaded with the best 2.0 effects and 
most of the best 3.0 effects, making project "Sys2.0.New" a very nice 
selection of effects, laid out much better than the 3.0 bank.

Other documented improvements are the shortening of framestore-to-disk
write time (now promised under 10 seconds) and less screen-flashing.

But my favorite improvements are in the CG.

Some fonts have been repaired, the manual update now spells out the
character sets for the two object fonts (Symbola 40 & 80), and there are 
new color fonts: "Sans Marble," which is a salmon-and-black-colored 
texture font which even looks pretty nice on the CG editing screen (but
might suffer from unreadability when rendered against dark backgrounds -
and, for some reason, seems to look terminally transparent when keyed), 
and "City," a nicely-colored (blue with pink diagonal, er, plaid?) font 
which - unfortunately - bears a vague resemblance to the old "Wedge" font.
It would never *pass* for Wedge, but it immediately brought to mind the 
ugly, blocky, serif look of the Toaster 1.0-circa font.

But speaking of color, my favorite attribute to CG 3.1 is the fact that
the user can now assign a gradient color to non-ColorFonts. The face color
and border color, top and bottom for each character, can now be adjusted. 
For example, if you like a letter to start as hot pink at the top but 
gradiates to dull gray along with a border that gradiates from neon green 
to royal blue, go for it! You can even do one character at a time within a
word, whole words, lines, or sentences. This also applies to boxes (which,
while I'm on the subject, can now be added to rolling screens). Oddly 
enough, this new coloring ability *also* applies to the borders of 
ColorFonts! 

Finally, can someone tell me if this next part has always been the case? I
noticed that when I have the color control portion of the CG active (where
one adjusts the face, border, and shadow color & alpha channel) I was 
still able to mouse down to the text area of the screen and select the
character/word/line on which I want to work. I don't seem to recall being
able to do that before, or maybe I just never tried.

What this all adds up to is that now, *every* font can be a color font.
Granted, no texture - but think about how easy it would be to make gold- 
or chrome-chiseled fonts! A light-over-dark yellow or gray with the 
opposite arrangement (dark-over-light) border - wham! Instant class. I 
am really happy with this addition.

On the down side, real ColorFonts are still not allowed in roll or crawl
pages, and although boxes *are* permitted (on rolls but not on crawls), 
boxes *cannot* share a line with text. So what's the point? I thought 
boxes are for putting text in! At the very least, though, a very skinny 
box can act as a line (a feature which was last available on v. 2.0). 
Brushes are still not allowed on either roll or crawl pages.

I'll readily admit that I haven't even touched on LightWave 3.1's new
features. I do know that quite a few nice features have been added there,
not the least of which is a set of new objects and, I believe, some new 
fonts and the ability to stop LightWave from rendering to the frame buffer
while it works (saving a second or three per frame but obviously a ton of 
time if you're rendering enough frames to fill, say,  a TV show).

It also can render text (including a message of up to 20 user-defined
characters) into an animation (in low or medium res) so you can be like 
VH-1 and have your name in the corner - say, for demo reels or to prevent
illegal use ("MMMK Video Prod.," or something like that.) Considering the
fact that this type of text is used for piracy control, it is a 
proportionately ugly font - it looks like Topaz 24 to me.


My biggest disappointment: there has been *no* substantial change made to
ToasterPaint since, well, 1986! (Remember DigiPaint?)

Seriously, though, when are we going to get a real paint program here?
Toaster paint, at best, is "functional" and yes, it does have a lot of 
nice features, if you want to learn the keyboard controls & the finger
aerobics necessary to obtain them. Personally, I don't like jumping 
through hoops to find a great feature. A nice little menu system or a 
better user interface would be enough, really! It's silly to say, but I 
doubt there is even a need for many new features: just make the ones we 
have more obvious! I've learned a lot of great shortcuts just from 
watching people who have experimented (or - shriek! - read the manual) 
than I've ever discovered on my own. Sure, I like playing with texture 
mapping, but even a simple set of pull-down menus with keyboard 
equivalents would be enough to teach me what is available and get me 
started on the road to keyboad-induced ToasterPaint nirvana.

So, if you want a functional upgrade with some very nice new functions and
a few minor new bells and whistles, dive into 3.1. It's free, so you quite
literally have nothing to lose except a few minutes' installation time. 
The letter attached to the manual addendum hints of big things to come 
from NewTek - I certainly hope that a substantial ToasterPaint upgrade is
one of them (and the NAB-touted "Toaster Flyer" is the other!), but for 
now we'll just have to wait and see.

The Amiga Report Installer script is now finished and ready for use.
Hopefully this will make AmigaReport easier to use. And before you read
further, keep in mind that there are many reasons why you should use the
included installer script as opposed to merely copying the files or
extracting them.

One major advantage is that the Amiga Report Installer is capable of
detecting which AmigaGuide reader you have installed. For example, if
you have MultiView, AR will try to use it. The same is true for picture
viewers, in the event that any pictures are included. For those of you
who keep your Amiga Reports for a few weeks, each will be placed in the
same directory on your hard drive (or floppy for that matter).

To begin, double click on the Install-AR icon. This will open a
window asking if you wish to perform a Novice, Intermediate, or Expert
install. The Novice install will perform all operations without user
intervention.

The Intermediate install first asks whether you wish to install the
software or just test it out. By selecting "Pretend to Install", it will
go through the procedure without transferring any files. You may also
create a file log as a file or to your printer to show what was done, if
desired.

Next is a warning for XPK users. AmigaGuide does not always recognise
files that have been compressed with XPK. This should not be a problem
for Amiga Report readers unless you access Amiga Report from another
AmigaGuide document.

After proceeding, a file requester asks you to select where the guide
should be stored. The default is the SYS: partition, and an AmigaReport
directory will be created there. The files will then be copied over.

The Expert install offers more options. At first it may seem to be
identical to the Intermediate install, but once a destination device has
been selected, new options are available. The Installer will search your
SYS:Utilities/ drawer to see if MultiView is present. If not, it will
look for AmigaGuide. If neither are found, it will check to see if
AmigaGuide is included with the current version of Amiga Report, and copy
it over if found. The icon ToolType will be modified to the first reader
found. Workbench 3.0 users will most likely be using MultiView, while
other users will most likely be using AmigaGuide.

Next, the picture display driver is created, in case pictures are
included with the current Amiga Report. This will first look for 
MultiView, for Workbench 3.0 users, and then for WDisplay or Display. If
WDisplay is included in the current version of Amiga Report, then it is 
copied over and used.

Next, all files are copied over to the destination directory.

If all goes well, the Installer will display a message saying that
the installation is complete, and it will list the location that the Amiga
Report was stored in. At this point, it is ready to read!

In the future, I would like to add support for other AmigaGuide
readers and picture viewers. In order to qualify for inclusion, the
picture viewer must be located in a rather consistent location on
everyone's Amiga, and it must use a consistent filename. While it is
possible to search for variations on filenames and locations, it is not
always possible if these are non-standard.

If anyone has any comments or problems, please feel free to email me.

The Amiga Report contest is still going on, and it is not too
late to enter. This ongoing monthly contest allows Amiga Report
readers a chance to win software by either solving a puzzle or by
entering a random drawing. The prize this month is the Amiga/Toaster
Reference Manual v2.221, from Area52. This is a 1,000 page help
system for the Amiga and Video Toaster, covering the Workbench,
AmigaDOS, Lightwave, and more ($34.95 value).  Runner up prizes
are also available. All monthly contests end on the morning of the
first of the following month. Any entries beyond this date will be
entered into the next contest.


To enter the random drawing, select a number from 1 to 262,144
and send it to me at one of my addresses listed below, either by
the postal service or email through the Internet.

Also, you may enter by solving the following puzzle. The winner
of this puzzle will be decided within the same time frame as the
random prize, to allow the contest information to filter through the
networks, and to allow your letters and postcards to come in.

        The ASCII table contains the alphabetic characters from A
    to Z, in sorted order. This character set is the basis for many
    languages, and should be common knowledge to anyone reading this.
    However, there exists a commonly used set of 26 characters, using
    these letters, in non-sorted order. Each character appears once
    and only once. In this non-sorted set, some of the characters do
    appear in alphabetic order, however there exist two characters
    which appear in reverse-sorted order. Where is this set found,
    and what are the two characters?


To enter, simply let your fingers do the talking and type up an
email and send it to dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu, or send a post
card or letter to:

             Solution to the First Amiga Report Contest Puzzle
                             by David Tiberio


Here is the first puzzle used in the first Amiga Report contest.
Along with it you will find one possible solution and the first
winner!


    THE PUZZLE:

         Recently I purchased a MasterLock combination lock. The
     numbers on the lock are marked from 0 - 35. To open the lock,
     it must be turned to the first number, the second number, and
     then a third number. How many combinations are possible? Keep
     in mind that this is a trick question. Please provide the
     answer along with the formula used to derive the answer.


    THE WRONG ANSWERS:

         There are NOT 36*36*36 possibilities or 36 possibilities
     or infinite possibilities.


    THE WINNING ANSWER:

     The first prize winner is Martin Allred, of Flanders, New Jersey.

         "Well, the combination lock problem is interesting.  Since
     there are 36 numbers, one would assume that you could have
     36*36*36 combinations. However, since the actual mechanics of
     the lock will not allow one number to be within, say, 4 digits
     of the numbers before and/or after it, that cuts it down to
     32*32*32.  So, I'll go ahead and say 32,768 possible combinations.
     In practice, lock manufacturers don't put consecutive numbers
     within about +/-10 of each other, which really cuts the number
     down to 16*16*16 (4096 combinations).  Since the books that list
     all the combinations by serial aren't all that thick, that
     would bear out the lower number."


    THE BREAKDOWN:

         - Recently I purchased a MasterLock combination lock.

             A true story.


         - The numbers on the lock are marked from 0 - 35.

             Irrelevant. If you scratch off all the numbers, the lock
             still operates in the same way.

         - To open the lock, it must be turned to the first number,
         the second number, and then a third number.

             The combination has 3 numbers.

         - How many combinations are possible?

             The mechanics of the lock allow for 12, and not 36,
             combinations. In other words, the numbers 0, 1, and 2
             all open the first location, etc, until there are
             12 locations. The padlock companies mark the locks
             as though there are 36 locations, but in fact there
             are only 12.


    THE DISCLAIMER:

     DISCLAIMER: This contest is being provided as a service to the
     Amiga community and all persons involved in running this contest
     cannot be held liable for anything that costs you money or
     lifetime pain and anguish. Rules are subject to change. All entries
     must be received by April 30th, 1994. Any entries beyond this date
     will be entered into the next contest, if any.


    THE APOLOGY:

     In the original puzzle, I offered the prize to the first one to
 reply with the correct answer. I determined that this is unfair, since
 many entries may come by mail from non-Internet readers. Also, to
 keep Urban D Mueller from getting that unfair edge that he had in the
 first contest. :) All future winners will be announced only in Amiga
 Report, and various other software packages will be available as
 prizes (if anyone wants to donate, feel free to email me).

%% CeBIT '94                                       by Dr. Peter Kittel %%
%%                                   peterk@CBMGER.DE.SO.COMMODORE.COM %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Here the CeBIT 94 as I experienced it. Forgive me when others already
reported the same, but I'm many many hundred articles behind in the net,
because I had no time for it for nearly the last two weeks during CeBIT. 
On our own booth we only had two (or even one) really new devices: the
A4000T and the CD1200, the latter still a handmade prototype. 
The CD1200 is the CD32 add-on for the A1200. I could not look at its
internals, so that I couldn't verify the existence of those SIMM Fast 
RAM sockets. An interface board is plugged into the trapdoor expansion 
slot and a cable leads from there through that breakthrough at the right 
back to the drive which looks like a white, half CD32. This cable means 
no standard drive interface, but something custom, faster. As the 
expansion slot is already occupied, no turbo boards or other expansions 
are possible. For space reasons, there's "yet" no MPEG part attachable. 
(This "yet" means that perhaps in some years the MPEG circuitry can be 
made so small that it fits into this space. If the A1200 will have a 
comparably long product life as the A500, there should be a chance.) But 
there were again incompatibility problems of the nasty hardware coder 
kind: They had provided some Fast RAM expansion for this A1200 via a 
PCMCIA card. This was enough to let some *new* CD32 games crash! 
(Without the card they were said to run.) This makes me rethink my 
aversion against death penalty...

The A4000T came already with OS 3.1 installed. It was a newer version than
we knew before. In the A4000T user's manual, still OS 3.0 is mentioned.
There's yet no concrete date available for the release of OS 3.1. 
The Dutch company Eureka showed their "Communicator", a hardware and
software solution to network a CD32 and any Amiga, so that the CD32
becomes usable as a CD-ROM for this Amiga. Still a bit expensive, but it
works. I'm just waiting for hardware companies coming out with such
solutions that use the CD32 expansion port, making it considerably faster.
There seems to be something in the pipeline.

A German company, P&K from Wolfenbuettel, showed us their expansion box to
bring the CD32 to a full A1200, including all interfaces, IDE drive and
floppy drive. They plan a price of 650,- DM.

Generally, the CD32 and especially the MPEG add-on gained big interest. My
big positive experience of CeBIT 94 was the fact that lots of multi- media
software houses approached us, claiming high interest in CD32 (and mostly
directly coupled with its MPEG add-on) to use it in kiosk applications.
One company was concretely involved in a project where they have to place
60-80 kiosks in a whole town, which also have to communicate. Until now
this is projected with Apple hardware at costs of ca. 20,000 DM for each
kiosk. They interviewed me, whether every needed feature was makeable on
the CD32. I didn't need to pass in a single item :-). So he can easily
save money by a factor of 10 to 20. For one or two installations this all
wouldn't have been an issue, but for 60 to 80...
As I said, of this caliber there were many. What made me so happy with
that was that the message obviously already *had* been around in the
market, that CD32 and Amiga are able to do such things efficiently. Our
marketing can't be that bad...
But what frightened me with several of these "Multimedia Software Houses",
was that they (several, not all) don't program at all in the common sense.
That wouldn't be so critical, as there exist some wonderful authoring
systems. But our all-time experience is that you sometimes have to dig a
bit deeper (by using C, not necessarily Assembler). And for such cases,
these companies don't even have one single programmer at hand! A very
frightening scenario for me. It's my strong opinion that you only can do
"good" applications when you know enough the SW *and* HW internals of your
system, so that you can judge what's an easy task for the sytem and what
puts more load on it.

Especially for CD32 we had arranged a comparison of the game Microcosm on
a Commodore PC 486/33, a CD32 and a Sega MegaCD. On the CD32, the picture
and animation was definitely looking best, the PC version coming very
close. The Sega version lacked extremely in the direct comparison, only 64
colors or some such. It was plain obvious. Pitily, they stole the Sega CD
on the third day and we couldn't get a new one fast enough. 
Else we had a number of working places with A1200's and A4000(T). The
accent lay intentionally on video. I could send people asking me about
this field there, being sure they would get a good answer from the experts
demoing their stuff there. Forgive me when I can't give more details about
this area, because it was the far corner of the booth from my place, and I
had very little time to look around there.

Several people spontaneously broke into "back to the roots", when they
recognized typewriters and telephones at our booth. A German company has
licensed our name for these products of them, else it's no Commodore
product at all.

We have a new, informative brochure, its title being translated "What you
always wanted to know about the Amiga". The text was developed by me and
many contributions from the German net and some from the English
developers community. I hope that I can convince my English/US colleagues
to start a similar project. On the fair, the resonance was very positive.

At the Commodore press conference, our General Manager, Alwin Stumpf, said
that he wants to announce new stuff only when he'll be able to ship it
days after the event. Saying this, he didn't want to give information
about new Amigas or the AAA chipset or a coming RISC processor. But he
added that he wants to announce some new devices this year, and other nice
dates for this like the CeBIT could be the WoC in Koeln later in the
year.


What about the competition?

I saw a Power Mac. It seemed to be faster. It opened windows already
nearly as fast as an A500. I was not impressed.

After the last year's rumours about IBM, OS/2, and Amiga/Scala, I went
there. On a big booth they were promoting OS/2. On several big projection
screens they were doing practical demos of how to work with OS/2, but
besides this there was also a small Vidi-Wall and some single monitors,
running a sort of demo. And that was definitely Amiga and Scala: diverse
wipes and text animations only known from Scala, and when one run was
over, the screen was dark for ca. a minute, showing only a typical Amiga
OS 2/3 mouse arrow. I'm sure you don't find this mouse arrow on other
systems. I didn't ask anybody there and also had no chance to look behind
the screen, where I perhaps only would have seen a VCR or a Laserdisc
player.

The 3DO was on show at the Panasonic booth. Really nice, but you obviously
have to have the right applications that make it look good. The best one
was some space shoot-em-up, where you fly arround in corridors of a space
station. This showed the nice 3D texture mapping feature. All the other
stuff didn't impress me too much. It was always very obvious, that they
use only 320 pixels resolution, where the CD32 can do over 1300, when it
needs it. The low res was so obvious, perhaps they had too good
monitors... They also had MPEG, also via an add-on module, but it did not
go inside the case as with the CD32, but did plug to the side,
A500-style.

I just got off the phone with Mike Levin of the Commodore ShareHolders
Movement!!  Don't go throwing out those Amiga Computers yet!! 

Mike said to let you all know that there is hope!!  On Monday (4-4-94), 
the CSM will be going to a meeting with the major creditors.  These 
creditors are either going to liquidate Commodore or restructure it and 
take over management to make it a "going" concern.  If they dump 
everything, then the money they have invested is basicly lost....the 
company is not worth that much on the auction block!  But if they go 
ahead and restructure...then the debts can not only be paid off...but 
money can be made!!  So the decision...while not made yet...is fairly 
clear. Cut your loses now and lose what you've got invested, or take a 
chance and start with a fresh look in charge!  What would you do??  Since
we are talking millions of dollars lost...I think they'll take the second
option!

One of the reasons that CSM has been called in is that they have a person 
that is not only ABLE to take the reins of day to day operations....but is 
WILLING!!  He is wiling to put his own reputation on the line to do what 
needs to be done to make C= the money making company that we all know it 
can be!  His resume has been sitting on Gould's desk for quite a while now
and there has been no real objection to his qualifacation.  The major
stumbling block to date has been that the position that he needs to fill 
is ALREADY filled!  With a restructuring...that position will be filled 
by a person of the creditors choice!  When this happens, the lines of
communication between C= and the Commodore ShareHolders Movement are
already in place.  This person has the ability to move C= into the
mainstream by doing the things that we, as users, already know need to be
done.  Mainly Marketing, Production, Research and Developement!  Doing the
first to first...Marketing to let people know that there is a great 
product to be had...and Production to make sure that the product is there
when they want to bt...allows that last...R&D...to take place at a clip 
that is consistant with the pace of todays users.  

One of the first thing that will be done is a......

Amiga Developers Summit meeting!!

This will be a meeting with the "big boys" of the Amiga....NewTek...GVP...
go ahead, name some more....they're all invited!!  This meeting will be 
the turning point in the focus of the company!  Discussions which will 
point the way to the future with the support of the companies that are
firmly behind the Amiga and her many users!

Mike also want to apologise to those that have had trouble reaching him 
in the past few weeks.  He's started a new job and has been absorbed in 
it. The CSM has not lost it's appeal to him...it's just that his InterNet
Account is in Philadelphia and his "home base" is now in Virginia.  This
makes the "casual" conversation via E-Mail a costly proposition.  More
infomation will be forthcoming as soon as possible.  

Stay Tuned, Boys and Girls....Round 2 is just beginning!!!

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

  UNIX "telnet" program from an account you may already
  have on an Internet-connected system. 
% 9600 bps Sprintnet in over 300 cities areas
+ $10 rate prevails at smaller US Cities
# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

/// BIX - Byte Information Exchange             Lots of information!
    -------------------------------



BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and enthusiasts.
While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is the place for 
knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  You're likely 
to find many others in similar situations who can offer advice, give 
technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.


                       *** FULL INTERNET ACCESS! ***

BIX features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription. 


                      ==============================
                      Rates and Connect Information:
                      ==============================


BIX membership costs $13 per month, plus connect time.  There are several 
different ways to connect:

SprintNet*              $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet:**               $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
(SprintNet and Tyment rates shown are for 48 contiguous US states only.)
                                                        
Tymnet Canada:          $4/hr eves/wkends           $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet Hawaii:          $10/hr eves/wkends          $20/hour weekdays   
Telnet(via Internet):   $1/hour, round the clock
Direct dial (Boston):   $2/hour, round the clock (up to 9600 bps)
 
 * SprintNet daytime hours are from 6am to 7pm, M-F, ET.
** Tymnet daytime hours are from 7am to 6pm, M-F, ET.

                20/20 PLAN OPTION (for USA-48 users only):

Volume users can choose the 20/20 Advantage Plan, which is $20 per month
and includes the first 20 hours of access by any combination of methods 
from the contiguous United States.  Additional use is $1.80 per hour 
(additional use for telnet access is $1 an hour).  The 20/20 Plan's cost is 
in addition to the $13 monthly fee.  


                           INTERNATIONAL USERS:

If you wish to connect internationally through Tymnet or SprintNet, 
please contact your local PTT.  BIX accepts prepaid international calls,
direct dial, or telnet connections.  In order to make a "collect" (not 
prepaid) call to BIX, your account must be verified before the charges 
are accepted.  When you complete the registration, we'll mail you a BIX
Membership Agreement by regular US Mail.  Whe you receive it, sign it 
and return it to us by mail.  When we receive it here, we'll authorize
your account to make reverse charged calls.

If you want to access BIX right away, contact your local PTT to set up a 
prepaid account.  You'll pay your local carrier for your calls to BIX in
advance, so there's no waiting period or verfication needed. Or, connect 
at BIX via telnet to x25.bix.com.

SprintNet international calls from most locations are $24 an hour.
Tymnet international charges vary, but are generally between $20-$30 an hour.


                           ====================
                           Billing Information: 
                           ====================

You can charge your monthly BIX membership fees to your Visa, 
Mastercard, Discover, or American Express card.

You may have your company invoiced for one or more BIX memberships with 
a BIX Corporate Account.

                            ===================
                            To Sign Up For BIX:
                            ===================

   Dial by modem 1-800-695-4882 or 617-491-5410 * 
   (use 8 data bits, no parity, full duplex)

   Press a few carriage returns until you see the Login:(enter "bix") 
   prompt, then type  bix

   At the Name? prompt, type bix.amrpt

* Users already on the internet can telnet to x25.bix.com instead.
  At the USERNAME: prompt enter bix, then bix.net at the Name? prompt.
  Once your account is registered, you can connect the same way, except
  at the Name? prompt you'll enter your BIXname and then your password.


Using the above procedure will allow users in the 48 contiguous United 
States to take advantage of our special "5 for $5" offer.  This offer 
lets you use up to 5 hours of evening/weekend time on BIX during the 
current calender month (whatever month you sign up in), for $5.  
Additional time is $1.80 per hour ($1 per hour for telnet).  At the end 
of the calender month, you will be placed into our standard rate plan, 
at $13 monthly plus connect charges.  You may also join the 20/20 Plan

TITLE

     ForceIcon

VERSION

     1.4

COMPANY

     None

DESCRIPTION

     ForceIcon is an utility mainly for users of CDRom drives
     or users of networking software capable of sharing devices
     and icons. Since one can not snapshot the position of a
     volume`s icon (on read only media), nor replace it by a
     user-defined one, I wrote this utility. ForceIcon allows
     you to set the position of a disk`s icon and/or replace
     it by a different image/icon which doesn`t have to be a
     disk.info file. All types of ".info" files may be selected.
     Special features include inheritance of device specific
     settings, specifying the root drawer`s size/position
     and display flags/modes.

NEW FEATURES

     - Added Server/Prefs concept. The main program comes
       with no GUI. It is controlled through an external
       Prefs editor.

     - Prefs Editor rewritten to use MUI (version 7)

     - Inheritance added. Volume entries may inherit settings
       from the corresponding device entry now.

     - Better code for scanning the DOS-List entries

     - Online Help

     - Diskchanges will be sent to all known volumes/devices
       on startup, now. This way you might be able to start
       ForceIcon from within SYS:WBStartUp

     - Added memory pool support

     - Edit entry will cause a diskchange to the volume/device
       so that you may see the changes you`ve made

     - More and better cloning of window flags

     - Added pattern support

     - Some bugfixes



SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Only OS 2.x and up
     MUI (MagicUserInterface) version 7 (MUI 2.0)
