Grrr.  Everybody hates waiting.  In fact, I don't think there's much you
can tell me about the subject that I don't already know.

You hate waiting for the deal to be done.  I hate waiting for the deal to
be done.  I hate waiting until I have enough spare time to do Amiga Report.
You hate waiting for Amiga Report.  It's a cruel world we live in.

But, a couple of weeks late, I've finally forced myself to sit down and get
this issue out.

August 19th came and went.  VIScorp needed, and got, a 30 day extension to
the terms of the purchase contract from VIScorp, in order to secure
financing from an organization that needed more documentation.  In the
meantime, Amiga shows have been happening and a new batch is coming up for
the fall and early winter.  It's going to be an interesting close to 1996,
I can tell.

More to tell?  I only wish.

                THEY say: "Amiga games suck"
                THEY say: "Developers are gone"
                THEY say: "No more good games"
                THEY say: "Amiga is dead"




                ...well, WE say:



                              F*@% THEM !!! 
                              -------------




          We are clickBOOM - the angriest team in cyberspace



          We have developed an amazing combat epic for Amiga 
                        called Capital Punishment



                      It is what players asked for:

                                 playable
                                  fluid
                                   fast
                                realistic...



                         And what they hoped for:

                                 violent
                                  wild
                                engrossing
                           adrenaline-pumping...



               And it's coming soon to blow your Amiga away!



      You'll engage in battle against warriors, ninjas, aliens, and 
   an assortment of other fearsome opponents in some of the goriest 
   fighting scenes ever seen in a video game.



Amiga Computing - "Capital Punishment could take fighting games 
                   into the next millennium"

Amiga Format    - "Capital Punishment has been proclaimed as 
                   the ultimate video game".

Amiga Report    - "Capital Punishment is a very smooth and engrossing game"

CU Amiga        - "Frame rate is higher than any fighting game I've seen"

Subject: amigas in the news

Hi.

I have some info you might/might not be interested in:

#1--In the June 24, 1996 issue of "MicroTimes: Northern California's
Computer Magazine", on p.264, there is, in the section devoted to
"Multimedia and Beyond", an article entitled: "Using Amigas On The Tonight
Show: An Interview With Mac McAlpin." The article was written by Douglas J.
Nakakihara.

#2--In the August 19, 1996 issue of "Electronic Engineering Times", on p.1,
there is an article entitled: "Hola, Amiga: rebirth of a platform --
Set-top maker buys rights to PC world's grande dame." The article was
written by Craig Matsumoto.  Interestingly, since the article is continued
on p.146, there is a second title/headline on p.146 which reads: "Amiga
platform gets a shot at revival -- Viscorp plans a future for the computer
that won't die."


Just thought I'd share what I'd read.  BTW, both articles were sent to me
by family members who at first thought I was extremely flaky because I own
2 A500s, but who are slowly learning about and becoming interested in the
Amiga.

Dear Jason,

First of all, like many Amiga owners, I appreciate the news and updates I
find in Amiga Report.

I'm writing today because I purchased a floptical drive a few years ago
from Todd Butson of TTR.  As you probably know, he gave up his business a
couple of years ago.  He was located in Madison, WI as I recall.

I have an A 3000 and hope to upgrade from 2.0 to 3.1 soon, but wonder if in
doing so a small program Todd wrote called "ttrsense" will be compatible. 
I have a large number of files on floptical and don't want to lose the
compatibility!

Do you have a recent address and/or phone number for him.  It's likely he
has an upgrade for "ttrsense" if I can just find him?  If you don't know,
would you please post this in Amiga Report in hopes that someone can help.

Thanks.

tboland@premier1.net

PS.  I'd also like to know about compatibility of WordPerfect 4.1.12
(Wordperfect's last Amiga release) with 3.1 OS, not only to read/write
files but also to print them.  Any help greatly appreciated!

Subject: No Amiga Computers at Disney

Dear Jason,

My name is Jude Anthony.  I became an Amiga owner when I bought my A3000,
and later started working for an Amiga store in Orlando, FL.  The store
went under due to the mail-order mentality of most of Orlando's Amiga
users, but that's not why I'm writing to you.

I've known about Disney's use of Amigas for a while, and tried to tell
people about it.  I've seen the ones at MGM's Indiana Jones Stunt
Spectacular, and I know they are in use at other attractions.  I was
working at the store when Universal Studios ordered an A2000 and the
Richmond control system for their Rocky & Bullwinkle show.  I had always
wondered why no one would talk to me about the Amigas at attractions, and I
was soon to find out.

When I rang up the sale, I had to bill the Amiga as a "control device."
Disney and other attractions have exclusive contracts with Big Blue to use
only IBM computers.  I can only hope that the Amiga becomes as impressive
as it used to be before the contracts are ready for review; perhaps VisCorp
could steal the exclusive away!

I just thought you might like to know that Amigas Are Out There.  The
companies that use them just have to Deny Everything. 

Keep up the good work with AR.  

Later,
Jude Anthony

Subject:    Amiga Report Letter to the Editor

If anyone asks, the Amiga computer is dead.  I sincerely doubt that VIScorp
will be able to offer a competitively priced, modern desktop Amiga.  
VIScorp should concentrate their efforts on producing their set-top box.  
(You know, the one that 's *not* first to market and probably won't be a
market success.  Wow!  Emerson...  that name sure evokes quality.)

I've been a loyal Amiga user and have held numerous offices in more than
one Amiga users group since I bought my first Amiga, an A1000, shortly
after it was introduced.  I later bought an A2000 shortly after its
introduction.  I didn't buy an A3000 or an A4000 because the "improvements"
did not represent a significant value to me, especially at those prices.  I
have two A2000s now.  They're both aging, and all the add-ons (A2630,
RapidFire SCSI, EMPLANT, Spectrum EGS Video, Cybergraphix, MagicWB,
AmigaDOS 3.1) I've bought over the years to try to keep them up to date
just aren't reliable.  I'm going to buy a new computer in the next 12
months and I can guarantee that it won't be an A4000T.  Like the majority
of [former] Amiga users, I'm looking at Macintosh and "WINTEL" PCs.  The
Macs are most appealing to me, of course.  In the price range of the A4000T
is a brand new computer from Apple, the Macintosh Performa 6400/200.  It
looks like an excellent value.  It's a tower case model with a 200 MHz 603e
PowerPC processor, 40MHz 64-bit bus, and lots of features (28.8 FAX/MODEM,
8X CD-ROM, 16MB RAM, 2.4GB HD, 800x600 16-bit color, SCSI, 16-bit stereo,
surround sound, sub-woofer, and a great bundle of pre-loaded software) .  
If VIScorp were to introduce an Amiga with the same hardware, I might be
willing to pay a $300-500 premium for the Amiga's co-processing and
multi-tasking advantages.  I really don't think the now obsolete AmigaDOS
3.1 and co-processor features increase the intrinsic value of the A4000 to
the level of modern PowerPC and Pentium powered machines.  They don't have
co-processors, but they have nearly enough muscle to be considered similar
performing machines.  My A1000 could multitask in 256K, but memory isn't
expensive anymore.  [When's the last time you priced a 16 or 32MB SIMM?]
The Amiga's co-processing advantage is very quickly being narrowed.

Given what ESCOM and VIScorp have said in the past, I sincerely doubt if
VIScorp, or anyone else for that matter, could sell an Amiga desktop
computer with modern hardware at a competitive price in the near future.  
It is time to close the curtain on the Amiga desktop computer and move on.

30 More Days

VIScorp, Chicago, IL - August 20, 1996

On 20th August 1996, the trustee for the bankruptcy of ESCOM AG and AMIGA
Technologies GmbH, Bernhard Hembach, extended the closing date for
VIScorp's purchase of AMIGA for 30 days with the support of ESCOM
creditors.

While the agreement is firm, one of the financial institutions supporting
VIScorp in the transaction required more documentation to authorize their
portion of the funding.  Satisfied that VIScorp would meet these
requirements, the closing date was extended.

The closing will not be extended past this date.

@toc NEWS

Many years ago, 1991, my club flew Jay Miner to one of our annual big shows
we held.  Jay gave a fairly long talk on the Amiga and its history and his
personal work on it.  During this we had a professional video tape camera
setup on the scene taping every word and scene.  Oddly enough the tape was
mostly forgotten till a few months ago.  The creator of this tape, asked if
anyone was interested in getting a copy.  The response has been incredible
here.  I thought that everyone interested in the Amiga and Jay Miner would
love to have a copy.  We decided to offer it everywhere we could.  We are
offering the tape with shipping for only $15!  Mail your orders to:

   MCCC
   P.O. Box 813
   Bedford, Texas 76095

We can't take credit card orders, but if you want to talk to our club
treasurer, his name is John Malmstrom.  His number is (817)282-6158.
Checks or Money Orders should be made out to the Metroplex Commodore
Computer Club. 

Anyone interested in coming to our annual show this year it will be Sept. 
28th at the Arlington Convention Center.  E-Mail me for more details...

@node NEWS4 "The Informer"
@toc NEWS

Dear Amiga Dealer/Developer:

Would you like to find a way for your Amiga products to get more expo-
sure? Would you like thousands of devoted Amiga users to know what you 
produce and how your products can be found?  If so, then let me introduce
you to The Informer, a newsletter that caters directly to the Amiga com-
munity. 

As you know, the best way to serve the Amiga platform and ensure its
growth is to provide information directly to the user. Through The Informer
Newsletter we can offer you the opportunity to do just that.

What Is The Informer?
The Informer Newsletter (ISSN 1089-4616) is a concise encapsulated re-
source of Amiga information and contacts which helps readers stay con-
nected with new Amiga developments, products and the latest news. The 
Informer provides readers with Email addresses, BBS listings, Web Page 
URL's, phone and FAX numbers and other means for readers to communi-
cating with dealers, developers and Amiga services. The Informer's staff 
are all committed and passionate Amiga users, and are proud to produce 
the entire newsletter using only Amiga computers. 

Who Reads The Informer?
Currently there are over 3000 printed copies of The Informer distributed
bimonthly. Each issue is distributed to our growing subscriber base, which
includes over 125 users groups, and through many various dealers, includ-
ing: Anti Gravity, Safe Harbor, Zipperware, IAM, Legendary Designs, Won-
der and others. These dealers enclose issues of The Informer with all their
Amiga orders. We provide free copies to anyone (in North America) who 
requests them and actively promote this policy on many Amiga internet 
newsgroups including CompuServe and Genie. Also, we announce this 
offer in  Amiga Report on-line magazine and are included with Turtle Light-
ning Software's disk catalog and print mailings, which reach over 3400 in-
dividual Amiga owners. In addition, each issue of The Informer is submit-
ted to the newsletter review magazine, Factsheet 5, where a review of The 
Informer is printed in their monthly magazine. The Informer will also be 
published to our web page, where viewers can page through selected past 
and present articles. 

Our subscriber base is rapidly growing due, in part, to some of the ex-
citing benefits we offer. Not only do subscribers get free classified ad 
space to sell their used Amiga products, but they are also automatically 
entered in a bimonthly prize drawing. In each issue we will be awarding an
Amiga product to a random subscriber. 

Services Offered By The Informer.
The informer also offers dealers, developers and distributors other ser-
vices as well. We will meet all requests or submissions on a first come
first served basis. Please contact us by Email or voice for confirmation
prior to any submissions.

Commercial Reviews:  Starting with Issue 4 (in which we review Aweb II), 
each issue of The Informer will feature a review of a commercial software 
product. If you would like to have a review of your product printed in a 
future issue, send us a review copy of your software.

Commercial Announcements: The Informer will print any developer 
announcement about new products or upgrades. 

Shareware Reviews:  Shareware authors who wish to have the registered 
version of their product reviewed may submit them for printed review.

Shareware Announcements:  We will print shareware announcements and 
upgrades as space permits. Submit a brief "Readme" file with product 
information including Author, means of contact, brief description, 
requirements and availability.

Free Ads: Any company that donates an Amiga product (software, 
Hardware, books, etc.) for the bimonthly Informer giveaway, will receive 
1 free block of ad space.

Developer Write-ups: Any Developer who wishes to have their company
spotlighted it the "Developments" section of The Informer, should make 
an Email request for the Developer Questionnaire. By answering the 
questions on the questionnaire, a write-up of your company and products 
will be compiled.

Distribution: In an effort to get The Informer out to as many Amigans 
as possible, we are seeking companies who are willing to include our 
Newsletter with all their Amiga orders. In return for this service, we 
will mention your company in a special section in The Informer.

Amiga Listings: If you would like your Amiga specific user group, BBS 
or Web Page listed in The Informer, send it to us and we'll print it in the
"Contacts" section.
...........................................................................

Advertising:  What The Informer Offers 
One of the greatest problems with the Amiga market today is lack of confi-
dence from consumers. People are not sure if they should spend money 
on an Amiga product. What they need is for developers, dealers and dis-
tributors to reassure them of their commitment to the products they pro-
duce and sell. Recognizing this, the Informer offers a variety of ways for
advertisers to connect with the Amiga community. 

Since the Informer is distributed solely to people who order Amiga
products or those that request a free issue, you can be assured your ad 
will be seen only by devoted users who actively use their Amigas.

In addition, anyone who advertises in the print addition of The Informer
will also receive an advertisement link to their pertinent company or prod-
uct information on our Web Page, increasing exposure even more.

If you are interested in finding out more about advertising in The In-
former, please request our Advertising Information Sheet via one of the 
methods listed bellow. In addition, you may also request a free issue of 
The Informer for your inspection. Please include your mailing address with 
any correspondence. Sorry, requests outside The US or Canada must include
$1 US to cover mailing expenses.

@toc NEWS

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Directory Opus 5.5 is now available! 

GPSoftware demonstrates its continuing support for the Amiga with the
release of the new version the Amiga world's most popular directory and
file management utility.  After more than 12 months of extra development,
Directory Opus 5.5 is more of a new version than just a simple update and
contains many changes and enhancements over the original product.

After receiving many comments and useful suggestions from Opus users,
almost every facet of the new program has been examined and subjected to
user scrutiny, backed up by extensive field testing from very persistent
Beta testers.  This release extends the original Opus 5 concepts and
provides many significant improvements in both operational power and
usability.  From the feedback we have received so far we are confident that
you will enjoy this new product more than ever! 

Take a look at the following enhancements to see why an upgrade is a must!


  . A new Icon Action Mode gives all the power of name mode Listers but
  with icons. 

  . Button banks and Listers need no longer be activated first in order to
  see right and middle mouse button clicks. 

  . WorkBench Replacement Mode has been enhanced.  Use Opus 5.5 with
  complete confidence to replace the standard Workbench.

  . An integrated OpusFTP capability lets you access remote Internet sites
  directly from standard Opus Listers.

  . Button banks can now be borderless with a sleek minimal dragbar
  instead of a full window border.

  . New Filetype-specific pop-up menus allow special menus for icons and
  files.  Use Filetypes to add custom menus for different types of files
  and icons. 

  . Custom buttons have a pop-up menu giving access to an extended
  selection of commands.

  . New independent HotKeys are now supported.

  . New Scripts system allows functions to be executed upon most system
  events.

  . Custom menus have been improved with multiple user menus with sub
  items.

  . New Automatic Filetype Creator allows you to create and test Filetypes
  with ease.

  . A font viewer is now included.  Just double-click on a font to view
  it.

  . Listers now have field titles, single-click re-sorting by fields, plus
  a new version field which reads the internal version information from
  each file.

  . New colour remapping of button and icon images with support for 'Magic
  Workbench' and similar systems.

  . Cybergraphics RTG now supported.

  . You can now selectively hide unwanted drive icons from the Opus main
  window.

  . Enhanced clipboard support provides full cut, copy and paste in
  gadgets and file Listers. 

  . Listers are no longer blocked while busy - you can now resize,
  iconify, and scroll busy Listers.

  . Icon and Lister snapshots are now stored separately from Workbench.

  . Listers can now display a background picture or pattern.

  . A new internal Opus CLI allows you quickly test commands and Arexx
  scripts.

  . Several new internal commands and many new ARexx commands have been
  added or extended with new features.  You can now even add you own
  internal commands with ARexx.

Bograts Preview
Vulcan Software

Vulcan Software, respected publishers of well-known Amiga titles such as
TimeKeepers and the infamous Valhalla series, have announced another title
in their mid-price "Mini Series" range.

"Bograts - The Puzzling Misadventure" is a side-viewer platform puzzler,
very much in the Vulcan software style of cute graphics and brow-furrowing
action.  In each of the 60 levels, your role as Mummy/Daddy Bograt is to
guide your two baby Bogs through each level without getting them - or
yourself - burnt, eaten, squashed or otherwise mangled.  Although the main
emphasis is on the problem-solving, platform elements such as Sonic-style
springs and shovers appear.

Bograts is shaping up into an very promising and addictive brain-teaser. 
The full game is due to be released on September 1st 1996; look out for the
full review in Amiga Report soon.

ANNOUNCE: Release of DrawStudio illustration package information
FROM: Graham Dean and Andy Dean
EMAIL: andy@ajdean.demon.co.uk
WWW: http://www.ajdean.demon.co.uk/
DATE: 7 August 1996

Graham and Andy Dean are proud to announce the imminent release of
"DrawStudio" - their new drawing, illustration and presentation program for
the Amiga.  The program contains many professional features which are not
found in any other Amiga programs and are usually associated with high
priced packages on other platforms. 

Working from a clear and standard Amiga interface, DrawStudio contains all
the tools required to create illustrations on the Amiga, whether they be
for technical diagrams or for artistic presentation material.  The ability
to convert objects to bitmaps makes DrawStudio an ideal tool for creating
graphics for World Wide Web pages or for use with other Amiga programs.

For a full list of features, please visit our WWW pages given at the top of
this announcement, however the following are a small list of the features
available:

o Full 24bit colour support.
o ARexx interface.
o Multiple projects, pages and layers.
o Powerful gradient fills.
o Transparency, including gradient transparencies.
o Bitmap and pattern fills.
o An object's pen and fill may be filled independently.
o Skew, perspective, wave, wedge, bulge, and freeform
  object and text warping.
o Powerful object snapping, including snapping to grid and
  other objects.
o Bezier curve editing, including cutting, joining, adding and
  deleting points.

A firm release date is not given as we are currently in discussions with
distributors, however we hope that the Web pages will give a good taster of
the program's abilities.

AUTHOR

   Helmut Hoffmann
   Rubensstrasse 4
   41063 Moenchengladbach
   Germany

   EMail: hhoff@pool.informatik.rwth-aachen.de

DESCRIPTION

   A picture management software for all Amigas (and Draco) feat.
   TrueColor support (thumbnails and picture windows) under
   CyberGraphX or reduced color output on AGA Amigas.

   This program supports many picture formats, allows combinable
   subtitles under thumbnails, can open multiple picture windows
   (incl. scrolling and zooming functions) etc.

   If you have a suitable graphic board with CyberGraphX WB
   emulation installed you can watch the pictures and thumbnails in full
   color quality (HiColor/TrueColor) on your Workbench or a
   private screen. Without CyberGraphX the normal color restrictions
   (2 to 256 colors) will lead to a reduced quality.

   Additional features include conversion to some 24Bit formats
   (incl. JPeg, IFF-ILBM24, Targa), picture deletion etc.

   Internally supported formats for loading:

   1) IFF-ILBM (1 to 24Bit incl. HAM6/HAM8)
   2) PhotoCD (Base format 768x512 or 512x768 (portrait))
   3) JPeg (color and greyscale)
   4) PPM/PGM/PBM (P1&P4 b&w, P5 grey, P6 color)
   5) QRT (also known as dump format by PD raytracers as POV-Ray)
   6) Targa
   7) PCX
   8) BMP
   9) TIF (packbit-compr./uncompr.)
   10) DEEP
   11) YUV
   12) VLAB raw
   13) RGB
   14) HHsYUVSq sequence format
   15) IFF-PBM (DPII)
   16) ACBM
   17) FBM
   18) Sun raster (uncompressed)
   19) MacPaint (b&w compressed 1Bit format; datafork only)
   20) HHsXRL formats
   21) binary-EPS bitmaps (RGB and CMYK)
   22) TBCPlus frames/fields

   The additional DataType support extends this list by many
   formats; DataTypes can e.g. be found on Aminet in util/DType.
   The DataType support is very fast, so that you can also view
   pictures in GIF or other formats quite fast for which Datatypes exist.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

   OS3.0 or higher required
   4MBytes FastRAM at least recommended

   Optional for TrueColor/HighColor viewing:

DESCRIPTION

   This is a standard Amiga printer driver with an additional
   printing program for the Stylus Color inkjet printers from Epson,
   including the II, IIs, and Pro. The printer features resolutions
   from 180x180 dpi to 720x720 dpi, with optional MicroWeave printing
   (an Epson feature that uses overlapping passes to reduce banding),
   Optimized Black Mode (on the Stylus II model only), and Small Dot
   mode (for the II, IIs and Pro models). The driver also implements
   horizontal and vertical whitespace stripping, as well as Epson
   compression mode 2 ("TIFF v4.0 packbits mode") to minimize the amount
   of data that must be sent to the printer and improve printing speed.

   EnPrint 2.x is based on a totally new portable 24 bit printing
   engine developed by Endicor instead of the standard Amiga 12 bit
   printing engine. This allows advanced user-accessible controls for
   gamma, intensity range, color correction, a wide selection of
   dithering options, color-to-grey conversion formula, and much more.

   The preferences driver has been updated to use this engine,
   providing all of these capabilities to all applications. Also
   included is a printing program that uses the printing engine
   directly, providing full 24 bit printing capability even to users who
   do not have other software that supports 24 bit printing. The
   printing program also features reduced memory usage, allowing large,
   high-resolution prints even on systems with very little memory.
   Note that printing time depends greatly on the application used,
   processing speed of the computer, and amount of data in a given
   output.

FEATURES

   Built in calibration utility.

   User adjustable Time-Out control.

   Full 24 bit printing support.

   Completely user-controllable gamma and range adjustments for full
   control over brightness and contrast.

   Three modes of color correction: adjustable in terms of RGB, CMY,
   or Y in M/M in C. The latter produces the best results as it most
   closely models the inaccuracies of printing inks. These modes are
   also completely adjustable.

   In greyscale mode, complete user control over the color-to-grey
   conversion process, plus three convenient preset configurations for
   the NTSC, HDTV, and equal-parts formulas.

   In B&W (thresholding) mode, the threshold is fully adjustable
   over an 8-bit intensity range, rather than Preference's 4 bit range.

   Sixty Five dither modes. Sixty Two are matrix dithers (many
   sizes and varieties of ordered, halftone, bricks, diamonds, etc.,
   providing a lot of "special effect" options), plus Random Threshold
   and two Floyd-Steinberg algorithmic dithers.

   Flexible configuration scheme: The system works in terms of
   configurations. A configuration consists of settings for resolution,
   dither, mode (MicroWeave, Optimized Black, Small Dot, etc.), color
   correction, gamma, etc. The Preferences editor allows for seven
   configurations corresponding to the 7 density options. Thus any
   density can be chosen to be any configuration of resolution, mode,
   dither, and corrections that the user wants. Additional
   configurations can be loaded and saved . The printing program also
   keeps a separate configuration. Configurations are edited with a
   friendly GUI configuration editor.

   Preferences driver supports printing HAM-8 and 7/8 bit modes on
   AGA machines in all their glory, plus 12 bit single-CLUT style like
   FinalWriter(TM) and others use.

   Preferences driver is smart about the true paper dimensions. It
   should handle all of the standard paper sizes correctly, plus if
   given enough maneuvering room, it will truly center the image on the
   paper, rather than centering within the printable area like the
   previous version and other standard Workbench drivers.

   Context-sensitive online AmigaGuide help. All documentation can
   also be brought up from within the program itself.

   Printing Program: Allows users to load pictures in IFF format
   (supports HAM-8, EHB, 24 bit, even Dynamic-HAM and Dynamic-HiRes),
   operate on them (rotate/flip, invert, etc.), size and position them,
   and print them. Any picture (even 24 bit) can be printed on any
   Amiga. There is no conversion to HAM or HAM-8 to cause loss of
   quality -- it's 24 bit all the way through when using the printing
   program.

   The printing program also includes a module that can generate
   pictures in 10 different modes, as an alternative to loading IFFs.
   Modes include things like user-selectable solid colors, color
   gradients, two kinds of color bars, and a hue/saturation "wheel".
   These modes are useful for calibrating color correction,
   gamma/lo/high, and for examining the effect of different dithers
   over ranges of intensity/color. An additional mode is a Workbench
   screen capture.

   There is support for output spooling and multiple print copies.

   A hard disk is required with a minimum space free of about 2
   meg. More is required for using the printing program on large
   pictures, and lots when using output buffering or multicopy support
   because it must store the complete printer output generated. This can
   be up to 20 megs a page at 720dpi full color, though the compression
   usually keeps it to about 12-16 megs or so. Only enough storage for
   one page at a time is needed, however. Using this method, a minimum
   amount of RAM required at the expense of the higher disk space
   requirements.

UPDATES

   EnPrint 2.1 is a free update for registered owners of EnPrint v2.0
   or Epson Stylus Color Printer Driver version 1.2, 1.1 or 1.0.  You

The Champaign-Urbana Commodore Users Group
P.O. Box 716

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Contact: cucug@cucug.org

CUCUG Announces its Fourth WWW Mirror Site

August 18, 1996 - The Champaign-Urbana Commodore Users Group (CUCUG)
announced today that Inter-Spider, an Internet Service Provider located in
Cracow, Poland, would be hosting its popular World Wide Web site.  A
process known as "mirroring" makes a nearly identical copy of a Web site
available to users closer to their own connection on the Internet.  This
usually results in more reliable connects and faster response.

CUCUG's webmaster, Kevin Hisel stated, "Users in Eastern Europe have been
asking us to set up a mirror there for quite some time.  We are grateful to
Inter-Spider for finally making it possible."

Zbigniew Baniewski, proprietor of Inter-Spider added, "There is a need to
establish an easy-to-connect site with news from Commodore world for many
polish Amiga users." He went on to say that, "there was also a sentimental
reason--my first computer was a Commodore VIC-20!"

According to Hisel, this is CUCUG's fourth mirror.  Other mirrors are
currently located in Australia, Italy and the United Kingdom.  The primary
CUCUG site is maintained at Champaign, Illinois in the United States.

CUCUG maintains the award-winning Amiga Web Directory and Agnes, an
advanced Amiga WWW search utility.  Both have become very popular with
Amiga users throughout the world.

The address for the new CUCUG mirror site in Cracow is:
http://www.ispid.com.pl/mirrors/cucug/

CUCUG Announces the Ultimate Amiga WWW Search Tool

August 4, 1996 - The Champaign-Urbana Commodore Users Group (CUCUG)
announced today the debut of its new Amiga Internet searching tool dubbed
"Agnes" available in conjunction with its popular "Amiga Web Directory"
World Wide Web site at http://www.cucug.org/amiga.html.  Agnes allows users
to search for over one thousand Amiga-oriented Web sites and more using
flexible keyword matching.

According to CUCUG, one of the many major improvements over other Web
searching utilities is that the description data contained CUCUG's database
of Web sites is written by humans, not just sampled from the first few
lines of the site's text.  This reduces the number of false "hits" and
increases the accuracy of searching according to Kevin Hisel, CUCUG's Amiga
webmaster.  Search results are also much easier to understand and displayed
more quickly than other search tools.

>From one page, Amiga WWW surfers can call on Agnes to:

* Search for more than 1,000 Amiga Web sites using data which is far
  more accurate than "crawler" type search tools. Sites are
  regularly checked and updated meaning less "404 Not Found" errors
  and new sites are added daily.

* Search CUCUG's full-text database of Amiga News including press
  releases, product announcements, news items, show reports and
  other Amiga developments.

* Search the entire, full-text archives of all Amiga Report Magazine
  issues released since January of 1995.

* Search the full-text archives of Amiga Product Reviews posted in
  the comp.sys.amiga.reviews Usenet news group. More than 400
  product reviews are housed in CUCUG's huge archive.

* Search all issues of CUCUG's own Status Register user-group
  newsletter which contains news, computer hints and tips, how-tos
  and information about CUCUG.

* As a last resort, there is an option to query all of the above
  areas in one massive search operation. Users should allow extra
  time for this monster search to complete.

"We've put together the world's most effective Web search mechanism for
Amiga fans.  If it's Amiga and it's on the Web, we're pretty confident that
Agnes can find it," Hisel said, referring to the all-encompassing
capabilities of the new service.

If you are familiar with the Internet Link Exchange, then you already
should have an idea of how AWN works.  You will be given an account where
we will keep track of the number of times your banner is displayed, the
number of people that click on the banner and visit your site, and the
number of credits you have.  For each credit, you will receive a certain
amount of banner displays on the AWN.  For example, if you have 3 credits,
we will display your banner and link to your site 2 times.  Likewise, if
you had 30 credits, your banner will be displayed 20 times.  Currently,
people have been earning hundreds of credits per day for free.  We even
have one site that earns over 1,000 credits per day.

Since the AWN is free, you are probably wondering how you earn credit.
There are a few different ways.  The first way to do so is to display ad
banners for other people's web sites.  For each display, you will earn 1
credit.  This is the method most people will use.  Second, we do issue a
free number of credits to get you started.  Third, the AWN will issue bonus
credits for each referal (successfull hit) from a unique IP.

Subject ........: A3000 SCSI Controller ChipAugust 16, 1996~

Gateway Amiga Club

RE: WD33C93A-PL 00-08 SCSI controller chip upgrade

  As you may know, there are several problems that can occur when adding
additional SCSI devices to the SCSI bus on the A3000.  Most common are
random SCSI bus lockups, especially with CD-ROMS and tape drives, and
random checksum errors when copying large files between devices.  These
problems can, in most cases, be attributed to the WD33C93A SCSI controller
chip in the A3000.  Most, if not all, A3000's shipped with the WD33C93A-PL
00-04 chip revision.  This chip had known bugs when multiple devices were
present on the SCSI bus.  With a single device, problems rarely occurred. 
As soon as the user started to add devices to the bus, the problems
mentioned above would start to appear.  The WD33C93A-PL 00-08 chip revision
addresses and fixes the above problems.  I would like your user group to
know that I am a source for this upgrade chip.

  Current asking price is $22.50 (US) per chip but I am reducing that price
to $20.00 (US) per chip for user groups.  An additional 5% discount is
available if 11 or more chips are purchased which would bring the price to
$18.00 (US) per chip.  This price DOES include shipping to anyplace on the
planet.  Cash, check (drawn on a U.S.  bank), or money order (converted to
U.S.  funds) are all acceptable forms of payment.

  Although I have referred to the A3000, this chip also works in the A2091
SCSI controller card, GVP SCSI controller card and any other SCSI
controller card that uses the WD33C93A SCSI controller chip.  Also, I have
recently been informed by Western Digital that they are no longer in the
chip production business.  Fortunately, AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)
manufactures a clone chip which performs as well or slightly better than
the Western Digital chip.  While I am currently unable to obtain any more
of the WD chips, I do have the AMD clone chip.

  On a personal note, before I upgraded my chip, I was unable to complete a
tape backup on my A3000 without a SCSI bus lockup.  Since I upgraded, I've
had zero lockups and have added a CD-ROM and another hard drive.

  If you or any other members of your user group are interested in
upgrading this chip, or if you have any additional questions, I can be
contacted at the following places:

New Product announcements from PIOS Computer AG has been eagerly awaited by
both the visitors to our Web-Page (over 46000 since May '96) and the
marketplace throughout Europe and the USA.

Unfortunately this delay has been caused by the inability to secure a

licenses.

Despite repeated efforts by PIOS managent Viscorp have discontinued
discussion, without giving any reasons or otherwise.  This is despite
initial talks and drawing up an agreements early June of this year.

In order for PIOS to meets its business goals of providing RISC products
for both the AMIGA community and other computer users, we feel that the
time has now come to provide an new impetus into the marketplace.  We can
no longer accept the Viscorp vision for AMIGA as being based on reality and

@node FEATURE1 "Different Input"

===========================================================================
              Using Different Input Controllers on the Amiga
  Calum Tsang                                               tsangc@io.org
===========================================================================

Are you sick of using your stock Amiga "wedgy" mouse?  Or is your current
mouse dying a slow and painful death with broken rollers and buttons?
Perhaps it's time to look for a new mouse for your system.  But wait, who
makes Amiga mice anymore?

You could go and seek out some high priced Amiga specific mouse, which may
be imported from who knows where, which isn't ergonomic or particularily
high resolution.  You might also consider hacking up an old PC bus mouse
from 1987.  But why not use a serial mouse made for the IBM PC?  Yes, it's
very possible to hook one up.  There are a few tradeoffs, as it'll connect
to the serial port, and not the internal mouse port, and it won't be
particularily compatible with games, but if you're using mostly Workbench
run applications, a PC mouse might be your best option!

PC mice come in a variety of different sizes and shapes.  At the low end,
you can find the horribly light yet ridiculously cheap OEM mice.  Made by
companies like Dexxa (which happens to be a subsidiary of Logitech), these
mice cost less than $10, but are reasonably durable.  At the high end, you
can get the Microsoft Mouse 2.0, an ergonomically contoured J shape.  Or
perhaps a Logitech Mouseman with it's three buttons.  The higher priced
models are usually better designed in form and function.  There are also
trackballs and other oddities, like the absolutely adorable Logitech Kidz
Mouse, which looks like a mouse.  You'll probably want something you're
comfortable with, that fits your hand size.  I know people with small hands
which can't stand large mice, and large handed people who say the already
large Microsoft Mouse is too small!  Many stores offer all the mice out on
shelves to be examined, so take advantage of this and experiment.

When you're buying the mouse, you'll want to know how it interfaces.
Almost all modern PC mice connect to a computer via a serial port.  This is
usually in the form of a DB9 pin connector.  To use your Amiga's serial
port, which is a DB25, you'll need an adapter, but most mice packages will
actually come with one.  Some mice use a special MiniDIN plug, or PS/2
style mouse port.  These are still serial, but just have a different
connector.  You could cut the end off and resolder a DB25, but it's easier
to get a PS/2 mouse adapter for DB25.  Or perhaps a PS/2 to DB9, then the
DB9 to DB25.  :)

Another major concern is the protocol of the interface.  Again, the PC
industry is relatively standard and a PC mouse will most likely be Logitech
Mouseman or Microsoft protocol.  (oddly, some Logitech mice use Microsoft
protocols) The Logitech protocols need an external serial board on the
Amiga.  Why?  The Logitech uses 7N1 encoding, which the Amiga serial port
does not support in hardware, while the system software drives do allow
for.  As a result, the Logitech mice need a board like the excellent GVP
ioExtender or the MultiFace.  This will probably limit most people to using
Microsoft protocol mice.  Don't worry, most of them are anyways.

A quick note about where to buy: I personally like buying hardware from
large retailers like ComputerCity, Future Shop, and Costco.  These places,
while having probably the worst sales people, also have the lowest prices.
As you're an Amiga user, you probably don't care anyways, as they most
likely won't know about Amiga systems.  These stores also have good return
policies, and aren't as stingy in this regard.  This may come in handy if
the mouse doesn't work properly, such as a protocol or interface problem.

Once you've purchased the mouse, plug it in!  Using your adapters, plug
into the DB25 Serial port on your Amiga.  You'll then need to set up a
serial mouse driver.  Two excellent drivers exist on Aminet, LogiMouse
1.053 by Simon Richardson, and SerMouse 2.21 by K.P.  vanBeem.  LogiMouse
is for Logitech mice, and SerMouse is for Microsoft mice.   SerMouse also
supports 5BYTE encoding for MouseSystems mice, which are an older and less
popular variant. 

SerMouse's configuration is done all through the Workbench Information menu
for it's icon.  For a Microsoft compatible mouse, set it for 3BYTES
encoding, and let it use it's default serial port configuration.  
serial.device, unit 0, is the Amiga's internal serial port.  If you have an
IO board, use your corresponding device driver name and the unit number the
mouse resides on.  Doubleclick the icon, and you should be able to move the
pointer around with your new mouse!  If not, don't touch the PC mouse and
use your Amiga mouse to doubleclick the icon again, disabling the driver. 
Then modify the tooltypes to get the settings right.  You'll want to add
the Tooltype DONOTWAIT into SerMouse's icon so it'll run without messages.
Once you're satisfied, drag the SerMouse icon into the WBStartup drawer and
it'll load the device driver everytime you boot. 

LogiMouse is a bit more complicated, but gives you quite a few more
options.  It also has versions optimized for different processors.  First,
place the appropriate LogiMouse program into your C: or similar "bin" like
directory.  LogiMouse is called from the user-startup sequence in your S:
directory.  Use a text editor to put in a line saying:

   c:logimouse -d whatever.device -u 0

whatever.device should be your serial board, as LogiMouse can't work with
the incompatible Amiga internal port.  The -u option LogiMouse what unit to
use. 

This barebones configuration should activate the serial mouse.  You can
test it by rebooting, or just trying out the command on the Shell.  If you
got a Logitech two button, you're done.  But, if you bought a three button
Logitech, like the Mouseman, you'll want to use the middle button for
another function.  LogiMouse shines in allowing you to redefine the center
button as the SHIFT key for instance.  While holding down the middle
button, you can now select multiple icons with left button without reaching
for your keyboard.  When I use my Logitech Mouseman, I use:

   c:logimouse -d gvpser.device -u 0 -mLSHIFT

Of course, you'll want your serial board driver in place of my
gvpser.device, and correpsonding unit number.  LogiMouse also allows for
many other functions for buttons, and even button swapping!  With the left
handed version of the Mouseman, you could even make a completely
symmetrical reverse of a normal mouse. 

Both drivers work very well, and are in general compatible with programs
run from Workbench.  There are many more functions in both, but they
pertain to more arcane configuration details or customization.  The
documentation for each explains them.  You'll notice a bit of jerkiness in
paint software, like a jagged response, but that's due to the limitations
of serial mice, not the driver.  Programs that have custom startup, like
games, will obviously not work.  That's acceptable if you're like me: you
use your Amiga for mostly productivity applications.  Also, if your machine
crashes and you get a Software Error or Alert, the serial mouse won't let
you click it away.  That's not so much a problem with Kickstart 3.1, which
cancels the Alert after a few seconds.  One way is to keep the old Amiga
mouse plugged in, to tap the button for reboots, and perhaps to play a game
or two. 

Both authors have made their drivers freeware, but Simon Richardson asks
for an email if you liked his LogiMouse.  Their drivers certainly make my
life easier!  Thanks guys!

AB3D II is a cool game - but some things are missing.  It has no
CyberGraphX Support, no ECS Support, no Modem (only nullmodem) Support, no
TCP/IP Support.

If you want to change this, fill in this Survey.  I will send the results

but at least they know then...

I will add together most answers (those without emails and addresses given)
to some fine numbers, so that it is more easier for Team 17 to read.

Email your Survey entries to Survey@Birdland.es.bawue.de

Please spread this Survey as wide as possible !!!

-----

Question 1 :

Did you buy Alien Breed 3D II or plan to buy it in the near future ?

[ ] Yes
[ ] No, because i do not have an AGA system.
[ ] No, because i do not buy games that do not run on GFX Boards.
[ ] No, because _______________________________________________

Question 2 :

a) If you already bought AB3DII :

If a CyberGraphX Version would be released, it

[ ] had to be for free (on Aminet).
[ ] I would pay an upgrade fee of _______ to ________
[ ] I would pay full price for a CyberGraphX version,
    even if i already have bought the AGA version.

[ ] A CyberGraphX Version of AB3D II would be very fine for me.
[ ] A (much later released) update that features the Texturemapping
    features of the S3 Virge chip of the Cybervision 3D Board
    would be fine for me, as i will buy this board.
[ ] The processor of my Amiga is a __________________
    and my GFX Board (if existing) is a ________________.

b) If you gave a "No" in Question 1 :

[ ] I need an ECS Version, as i have a ECS system with
    a _________ processor, that is powerful enough for AB3D II.

[ ] I need a CyberGraphX version.
[ ] A (much later released) update that features the Texturemapping
    features of the S3 Virge chip of the Cybervision 3D Board
    would be fine for me, as i will buy this board.
[ ] The processor of my Amiga is a __________________
    and my GFX Board (if existing) is a ________________.

Question 3 : If the CyberGraphX Version would be for free :

[ ] It has to be tested at Team 17 before being put on Aminet.
[ ] It can be provided "as if", if it runs or not is up to the user.

Question 4 : How could you help Team 17 ?

[ ] I could lend them my Computer with installed GFX Board for
    testing of a CyberGraphX version. My email, snail mail and
    phone number are found at the end of this entry.

[ ] I could lend my GFX Board to Team 17. Address see below.

[ ] I could lend my Computer without installed GFX Board to
    Team 17, if they get a GFX Board from somewhere else.

[ ] As soon as the Cybervision 3D comes out, i can sell them
    my GFX Board quite cheap, as i am then getting a Cybervision 3D
    then, instead of the board i up to now use.

[ ] I could do Beta testing of the GFX Board version. I have bought
    AB3D II. So they only had to mail me the main executable.

[ ] I am a programmer who is quite familiar with CyberGraphX programming.
    I could help them with the coding part.
    My email is ___________________________________________

[ ] I am a programmer quite familiar with c2p algorithms. I could do
    a c2p for ECS machines for Team 17.
    My email is __________________________________________

[ ] I am a programmer quite familiar with TCP/IP coding. I could help
    them there.

In AR410, you report about Amigas used at Disney's.  Below you'll find a

that my posting is already FIVE years old (this is 5 centuries in computer

A2000's.  In the text you find some more enlightening details for this very
issue.  And in the text, they say it was even already 4 or 5 years old in

Please note also that this use of Amigas is listed since years in the

You should ask the people at Disney Studios: "We have shows here that
run 40 times a day since 2 years and are controlled by Amiga computers.
NOT ONE SINGLE show was abandoned due to a computer error. 20,000 shows
without a crash justify Disney's choice and this computer concept."

This was in a computer show in German TV (BR-III, Computer-Treff,
13.7.91, 17.05). They reported about all the computer controlling
at Disney in Florida, at Disney/MGM-Studios, at Epcot and in Disney
World (or is it DisneyLand?). Here some more scenes from that show:

Indiana Jones show
Moderator: "Which costly computer system is used here to control all
   those sound effects?"
Disney speaker: "Normal Amigas. We chose them for their multitasking
   capability. That was 4 or 5 years ago. At that time it was the
   only computer with which you could do this. In the meantime there
   were many computers announced that are able to do the same, but
   they are still much more expensive. We could today place a $10,000
   computer here that can do the same, but it makes no sense, for the
   Amigas are working wonderfully. ... We only have problems with the
   environment, humidity and dust. (Action scene shown with fire and
   smoke, Amiga directly besides this, then they show heavy rain in
   Florida.) Real mud gets onto the computer boards. But the computers
   do stand this, you just have to open them every few months, clean
   them and perhaps change boards, then they work reliably."
Moderator: "This is the most important in the film studios where
   George Lucas was among to define the concept: The same procedure
   has to run without problems, dozens of times a day, year for year."

Disney studios, 3D MuppetVision
Moderator: "Also this show would be unthinkable without computer:
   3D characters (Mickey Mouse) on the movie screen interact with
   live actors (Kermit) on the stage. Light, sound and Special Effects
   are controlled and synchronized by an Amiga. (Follows the above
   mentioned 20,000 show statement.)"

Disney World, fireworks in the evening
Moderator: "You may have a nice fireworks, as it lights the sky
   every evening. And guess who stands behind that colorful magic?"
Disney Speaker: "During this fireworks we control all 3 parts of the
   show with the Amiga:
   1. Sound. The computer takes the input signal, music from a digital
      audio tape. Special software processes it in the computer to
      prepare it for different hardware configurations outside, levels
      are adjusted, and the result is fed to 4 or 5 separated loudspeaker
      towers that are distributed in the park. ... Only with the computer
      we can divide the main signal from tape into the correct sub-signals
      and synchroneously send it to the right places.
   2. We also control the pyrotechnics that is established on the roofs.
      We have 6 locations from where we start fireworks. ... During this
      we absolutely need perfect timing, as the fireworks is very tightly
      choreographed with the music of the show, and we want to provide
      the same result every evening. A precise result can only be
      achieved with the Amiga control computer.
   3. The 3rd system controlled by the computer is the light. It consists
      of six 5 kW spots that are controlled individually in their
      precise intensity."

So far excerpts from this TV show. Please apologize my English, I only
hope I didn't lose an important fact or misunderstood one.
It was amazing. They very often not only talked about "computer". No,
they explicitly said "Amiga computer" again and again.
We must address that TV station to get a good tape from it :-).
It's heartwarming.

===========================================================================
  Amiga Convention '96 Montreal and the Atlanta Amiga Portable Unveiling
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

It feels like I've been all over the place in the past month, which hasn't
helped me sit down and work on Amiga Report.  But here I am, with a few
hours to spare until my set deadline for the issue, and I'd like to at
least try to do SOME justice to the events I attended.

Amiga Convention '96 in Montreal was held in early August at the downtown
Howard Johnson Hotel.  The weekend got off to a good start in our "all we
have left but it's pretty cheap, all things considered" hotel suite.
Friday night was filled with the usual meeting up with people, catching up
on personal business, and going out to dinner multiple times.  Among
others, I was finally able to meet Commodore legend Jim Butterfield.
Particularly if the Amiga is not your first Commodore computer, you should
either be familiar with Jim's name, or be ashamed of yourself.

Saturday morning, the show kicked off.  Unlike last year's AC and most
conventional trade shows, AC was not held in a huge room but instead in a
series of large meeting rooms.  There was a lot of hanging out in stairways
and hallways as a result--not a bad thing, since much of the point of a
trade show is to socialize.  Exhibitor turnout was substantial, but there
was a notable lack of strong presence by hardware developers.  Left to
represent that aspect of Amiga business on their own was Silent Paw, makers
of the PAWS 1200 portable.  Software manufacturers were reasonably well
represented by the wit and charm of Dale Larson and his IAM crew, Syzygy
and their Digital Universe-churning demo unit, Bob Fischer and his ImageFX
and Aladdin 4D promotion, and Moebius Technology, whose spreadsheet program
is in developmental stages.  Rounding off the software developers was
clickBOOM, creators and publishers of the upcoming Capital Punishment for
the Amiga.  Retailers on the scene included National Amiga, Valleysoft,
Wonder Computers, and The Computer and You.

Not too much in the way of new product was available.  IAM launched their
new MRBackup software, and clickBOOM was showing yet another Capital
Punishment demo, this one 060 compatible.

National Amiga had a lot of last-chance items, including a stack of CDTVs
and A600s.  If you shopped in another room, you would have seen dozens of
A3000s on sale for ridiculously low prices.  About 40 were sold at the
event.

The show featured a keynote by VIScorp VP of Business Development David
Rosen, as well as demonstrations and programs throughout the two-day
session.  Final attendance was estimated at something under 400 people.
Not stellar, which was surprising given the amount there really was to see
and do, but not bad, either.

Of course, the real fun is the night life.  Saturday night consisted of
Vietnamese food and Laser Quest, a game where you don a big plastic vest
and gun and run around a blacklit maze shooting at each other.  Since I was
dressed in a white t-shirt, I was a great target and got shot an awful lot.

Sunday, there was a panel discussion with myself, David Rosen, and Dale
Larson of IAM.  Lots of questions came from the audience, worried about
future Amiga direction and cooperation with other companies.

Sunday night was the really neat one.  The local Virtual World franchise
helped sponsor the event and put on a demonstration.  There were also free
passes for all the event staff and VIPs, so we played a few rounds of
Battletech.  Within our group of 6 players (Myself, Katherine Nelson, Dale
Larson, Robert Hardy, Adam The IAM Intern, and Al Mackey), I managed to win
all three matches. :)

In Atlanta, the tone was considerably different.  VIScorp had committed,
months ago, to sending a rep to Atlanta in August.  When it finally came
time to really send someone, I was asked to attend.  Luckily, QuikPak came
to my rescue and gave me something real to talk about.  They are developing
a new motherboard to be placed in an industry-standard OEM portable
computer case, which will put a portable A4000-class machine on the market.

The new computer will have a color LCD capable of Amiga video modes.  In
addition, the new motherboard will have 040 and 060 design and up to 128
megs of memory directly.  There will be Zorro and video slots, allowing for
a fully portable video editing station based on Amiga technology.
Estimated retail cost is around $3000, and count on it being six months
away.  The unit will be AC power only, and is not the same design Silent
Paw has been working on.

The Atlanta group turnout was decent, and I fielded questions for what
roughly seemed like forever.  Thankfully, it's all on video so I can keep
straight in my head what exactly happened. :)

Coming up for the rest of the year, it looks like there may well be two
Toronto Amiga shows.  Amazing Computers is planning a November show with
Comspec and Randomize, and Wonder Computers is planning a second showing of
their World of Amiga show in December.  Of course, the other big upcoming
shows will be the Cologne Computer '96 and the Video Toaster Expo.  I hope
to see you there!

@node REVIEW1 "Review: MIAMI vs. AMITCP"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                         Review: MIAMI vs.  AMITCP
  Robert Davis                                             rdavis@nyx.net
===========================================================================

Here is a comparison of the performance of MIAMI as compared to AMITCP.  In
July, 1996, Holger Kruse released the beta and then demo versions of his
new TCP/IP stack for the Amiga, named MIAMI.

The primary advantages to MIAMI over the older AMITCP are:
1. MIAMI is *much* easier to install, often taking
   fewer than 10 minutes from start to on-line.
2. MIAMI is less expensive to register, costing $35 (US)
   while the commercial version of AMITCP/IP is around
   $95 (US) from retail sources.

The tests I have run show disagreements with the prevailing wisdom as seen
in Usenet newsgroups and on Internet Relay Chat channels.

The buzz seemed to be that MIAMI was simply faster with its Internet
connections than was AmiTCP, and that MIAMI used less memory than AmiTCP.

Neither is true.

Anyone can do these tests, all it takes is a bit of effort and some time. 
I would like to see someone come up with different results, using a test
procedure which I (or anyone) could duplicate.

Still, differences are slight, and the two advantages for MIAMI listed
above are very important.  Having a choice in TCP/IP implementations is
also important.

Here are the results of my comparitive tests of MIAMI and AmiTCP, starting
with an examination of memory used.

Procedure followed: Reboot the Amiga 3000, take note of free memory, start
the TCP/IP stack, start IBrowse, close unnecessary windows.  Note free
memory, subtract from original free memory to determine actual usage.

Software versions used were MIAMI 1.0 demo and AmiTCP/IP 4.0 demo, and
IBrowse R8a demo.

IBrowse is loaded because it uses MUI, and forces similar memory
allocations in both MIAMI (which uses MUI at startup) and AMITCP (which
does not use MUI).

case 1   MIAMI + IBROWSE
    memory used   chip 226976  other 1696896  total 1,923,872

case 2   AMITCP + IBROWSE
    memory used   chip 216128  other 1544048  total 1,760,176

case 3   MIAMI + IBROWSE
    memory used   chip 226976  other 1697088  total 1,924,064

case 4   AMITCP + IBROWSE
    memory used   chip 216128  other 1544048  total 1,760,176

Conclusion, once MUI is forced, AMITCP uses about 163-thousand bytes less
than does MIAMI.

====================================================================

The results of three speed comparisons between MIAMI (the new Amiga TCP/IP
system for modem use) and AMITCP/IP

22 July 1996

Speed of FTP file transfer ...  AmiTCP loaded, amiftp started, connected to
ftp.amigalib.com, received file INDEX.Z 941966 bytes.  the reboot loaded
MIAMI, and receive the same file from the same ftp site.  Then repeat.

attempt 1   AmiTCP  1365 bytes/second
attempt 2   MIAMI   2616 bytes/second
attempt 3   AmiTCP  2898 bytes/second
attempt 4   MIAMI   2366 bytes/second
attempt 5   AmiTCP  2943 bytes/second
attempt 6   MIAMI (transfer stopped at 95232 bytes)
attempt 7   MIAMI   2660 bytes/second

Interesting.  The very slowest and the very fastest ftp transfers were
while using AmiTCP.

I suspect that conditions on the Internet have a lot more to do with data
transfer speed than does which TCP stack you are running.

Note that attempt 6, using MIAMI, errored and failed.

====================================================================
02 August 1996

Some results from limited comparisons between MIAMI (demo version 1.0) and
AmiTCP (4.0 demo)

Speed of FTP file transfer ...  reboot the A3000, Load MIAMI, start amiftp,
connect to ftp.amigalib.com, receive file INDEX.Z 953269 bytes.  Reboot the
A3000, load AMITCP, and receive the same file from the same ftp site.  Then
repeat.

attempt 1   MIAMI   2633 bytes/second
attempt 2   AmiTCP  2868 bytes/second
attempt 3   MIAMI   2862 bytes/second
attempt 4   AmiTCP (transfer aborted at 670720 bytes)
attempt 5   AmiTCP  2812 bytes/second
attempt 6   MIAMI   2862 bytes/second
attempt 7   AmiTCP  2597 bytes/second

Interesting.  For the second time, the very slowest and the very fastest
ftp transfers were while using AmiTCP.  But MIAMI is very close ...  I
conclude there is no significant difference in the speed of data transfer
using MIAMI or AmiTCP.

I still suspect that conditions on the Internet have a lot more to do with
data transfer speed than does which TCP stack you are running.

This time attempt 4, using AMITCP/IP, errored and eventually failed.

====================================================================
05 August 1996

Again using MIAMI 1.0 demo and AMITCP 4.0 demo, here are the results of a
third speed test.

Slightly changed conditions for the third speed test involve putting
INDEX.Z (954859 bytes) on the local Internet Service Provider.  That LINUX
system is about one mile from my home.

The same procedure, reboot, load a TCP/IP stack, receive the file, then do
it all again, gave the following results:

attempt 1  MIAMI  3281 bytes/second
attempt 2  AMITCP 3304 bytes/second
attempt 3  MIAMI  3236 bytes/second
attempt 4  AMITCP 3304 bytes/second
attempt 5  MIAMI  3304 bytes/second
attempt 6  AMITCP 3304 bytes/second

Certainly, neither MIAMI nor AMITCP/IP has a significant speed advantage. 
Speed variations here might be attributed to load differences on the remote
computer.

@node REVIEW2 "Review: Alien Breed 3D II - The Killing Grounds"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                  Alien Breed 3D II - The Killing Grounds
                            By: @{" Ken Anderson " link KEN}
===========================================================================

At last - Yes, it's here.  The wordily-named "Alien Breed 3D II - The
Killing Grounds" (hereafter TKG), the most eagerly awaited game for the
Amiga since the last Alien Breed 3D, slipped into the shops on the 24th
July, after what seems like years of waiting.

The first thing to point out is that TKG loves power.  Nay, it demands it.
Playing this game on a stock A1200 is like having sex with 3 condoms on -
better than nothing, but it's slower, more difficult and generally not as
good as the real thing.  The game is shipped with both 2 and 4 megabyte
version - the former runs in 2x2 mode, meaning every block on the main
playing screen is made up of a square, 2 pixels wide.  It gives you enough
detail to see what's going on, but you can't appreciate the true hard work
that has gone into TKG.  Showing this mode to a PC owner will result in
minus several thousand street cred points, so don't do it.

Feed TKG to anything better than an 68030/25-equipped Amiga, and you start
to see things a little more clearly.  Coupled with 4Mb of memory, the extra
power will allow the 1x1 mode, where the screen is made up of individual
pixels.  Robots that were a mass of blocks in chunky old 2x2 mode show up
as lean, mechanical killers in 1x1.  The ankle-biting aliens that
previously looked as if they were being viewed through your bathroom window
now look fearsome, deadly, and to be avoided.

The second thing to point out is that TKG is very, very tough.  It took me
3 days of on-off playing to get past the second level, and that was only by
the skin of my teeth.  Ammo, in the initial levels at least, is scarce,
forcing you to make every shot count.  The aliens attack in ferocious
waves, enducing panic-filled spinning around, desperately trying to
orientate yourself enough to get a clear shot.  The levels are
well-designed, with secret passages, hiding holes and even the odd
ventilation system for you to crawl around in, Bruce Willis style.

Of course, you are not alone in this playground - the Alien Breed of the
title are out for you.  In the first game, they weren't such a clever
bunch.  You could rely on them to follow certain patterns, and take
advantage of such rigid artificial intelligence.  In TKG, no more - those
damn aliens are smart (except for the stupid ones, of course).  Even though
they can't see you, most can hear you - a missed potshot at a dozing robot
will result in the thing chasing after you.  This can also work to your
advantage, of course - no better way to lure the scum out that to loose off
a few rounds outside their hiding place.

The game engine has been improved almost beyond recognition, so you can now
look up and down - especially useful in some levels for peering down over a
ledge to blast an unsuspecting beastie.  Every level is now lightsourced -
blasts from guns will temporarily light up dark caverns, and aliens and
objects are silhouetted by explosions beyond them.

The light effects, and in particular the sound effects, give the game a
very strong atmosphere - play the game with the lights off and the speakers
turned up, and I guarantee you'll jump backwards when that walker appears
around the corner, headlights - and laser cannon - blazing.  The pounding,
almost subliminal, sound effects grow steadily quieter and louder as the
game and the pace vary.

In fact, technical issues aside, it is the atmosphere generated by TKG that
sets it apart from the rest of the croud.  You ARE the lone fighter, stuck
in a room with a family of blood-sucking mutants after you.  Your task
isn't simply to get from the start to the end of the level; it's to blow up
X, find out more about Y whilst crawling around Z.

Once every last bit of playability has been exhausted from the game, you
can resign just about all of the game with the supplied game editors.  The
level design, alien intelligence, objects and most other game elements can
be customised, enabling the player to create their own little world in
which to kill things.  PC fans will know that there is a wealth of
user-created Doom levels on the Internet, and I expect this will become the
case with TKG too.  Sadly, a vital file required for the running of the
level editor was missed in the final distribution of TKG.  Team 17 should
have the file ready for release by the time you read this.

In summary, TKG is the finest Amiga "Doom-clone" ever written, and can hold
it's head up against other platforms too.  It combines atmosphere,
technical genius and sound gameplay design to produce an instant Amiga
classic.  This is the standard on which others will be judged.

---
Team 17, once the darlings of the Amiga games scene, have been publicly
pessimistic about the Amiga's future.  It is only the instinct that has
been bred into them and the sheer skill of TKG's programmer, Andy
Clithereo, that has brought TKG into existence.  Do not let their skill and
trust go unrewarded.  If you like what you have read here, buy the game.
This time, the Amiga's future really IS in your hands.

There are also reported problems running TKG from a hard drive.  Exactly
what causes the problem is unclear at the time of writing, but various
suggestions have been put forward in comp.sys.amiga.games.  Anyone having
trouble with the game would be best advised to keep an eye on c.s.a.g and
Team 17's Web Site (http://www.team17.com).

Pros: Unsurpassed atmosphere, and probably the most technically advanced
game ever written for the Amiga.  Enough challenge and levels to keep you
at it for a long time to come, and when you've finally beaten it, there's
the level editor to keep you going.  Oh, and one more go, please.

Cons: Incredibly tough, which creates frustration.  Needs a pretty porky
Amiga to get the best from it.

PRODUCT NAME

  Reccoon BBS v0.67 (registered)

BRIEF DESCRIPTION

  A integrated BBS system with support for Fidonet echos, as well as
fileechos.  Good MSGID/REPLY linking, and support for long file desc.

AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

  Name: Henric Andersson (1996-), Niclas Emdelius (1991-95)
  Address: Smedjegatan 10, S-260 60 KVIDINGE, SWEDEN
  Telephone: N/A
  E-mail: edc@klippan.se
  Fidonet: Henric Andersson, 2:200/236 (+46-435-25251) (24h)
  World Wide Web: N/A

LIST PRICE

  700 SEK (~US$ 100) This includes free updates and a keyfile.  You can
send the payment either via PostGiro 5010164316 (Scandinavians only, mark
with "Reccoon / Andersson") or via direct bank transfer to Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken (SE Banken), Clearingnr 5620, Account 56200005109.

DEMO VERSION

  Demo version is available on Aminet, e.g.  in /pub/aminet/comm/bbs at
ftp.luth.se as Reccoon-Eval.lha or via Fidonet filerequest of "rcn067.lha"
from 2:200/236.

  The demo version can only run with a locale node, but you can get the
feel of the BBS system anyway.  You can still import msgs, upload files
etc.  When you register you'll get a keyfile, and will also be able to
download your personal executables directly online from Henrics BBS.  I've
mailed Henric about getting the updated personal executables via EMail, but
I haven't got any answer yet.  That would make it cheaper for people in
other parts of the world.

SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

 HARDWARE

  x 1 MB RAM required, but more is prefered.

  x Installable on disc, but HD is prefered if you want to run the
    registered version.

  x The program runs on any 680x0 processor, but the faster the better.. :)

 SOFTWARE

  x AmigaOS 2.04+ is requiered.

  x Working just fine on AmigaOS 3.1.

  x If you want to run as a Fidonet node you'll need a Fidonet compatible
    mailer like TrapDoor.  A tosser is included, as well as programs to
    handle fileechos.

COPY PROTECTION

  There is no visible copy protection, but you get your personal keyfile
and will also need to download your personal executables before you get the
fully working version.  I guess you could get the executables Email:ed to
you from the author as well.

  It can be installed on a hard drive (prefered).

  No need for any original disk.

MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

  Amiga 3000 25 MHz
  Workbench 3.1 (40.42), Kickstart 3.1 (40.68)
  One internal 1.76 HD diskdrive and one external DD diskdrive

  Fujutsi 1.05 GB, 100 MB Quantum HD
  NEC 2x CDROM
  SupraFAXmodem 28k8 V.FC/V.34

INSTALLATION

  The product has an easy to use Installer script, but in earlier versions
there's been some trouble with the installation failing.  This is not the
case in the current 0.67 version.  It's easy to update from an earlier
version, since the script does all the necessary changes.  There's also
dozens of doors specially wrote for Rcn, and they are easily installed in
the DOORS: directory.  =20

REVIEW

  The BBS packages comes with all the utils you need, like Front, which is
a frontend if you do not have any real mailer.  A tosser is included to
handle msg import/exporting and there's both a STDIO and a GUI config
program as well as user editor.  It's easy to create your own menus, and
the system supports configurable number of menus (you can have e.g.
ANSI/non-ANSI menus with swedish or english text).  All strings in the BBS
program can also be translated if you want to.  If your a new user and
haven't programmed C before, then there might be some problems to get
started with the FPL programming, but since there's a lot of people to ask
in the Fidonet echos, or the author, that won't be that big a problem.
There's also a lot of examples in the fileechos, and a good online manual
for FPL.  You don't need to know FPL to create your own menus, even though
you can write your menus directly in FPL.

  The configuration is quite easily made.  All you have to do is start the
config program.  If you want to install Fidonet stuff, then some Fidonet
basic will be good to have.  Setting up msg areas and file areas isn't hard
at all, just press the Create area button and fill in what you need.

  I only run my BBS as a one line BBS, but there is some people running
multi-line BBS:s, and they say it works perfectly fine.  There's also some
chat doors to enable chat between two lines, as well as between more than
two people.

  The BBS system can handle DOS doors, the old Paragon style doors as well
as the new Rcn doors.  Most doors I've installed works with some of those
configs, which gives us a lot of doors.  There is currently not as many
doors as Xenolink or AmiExpress have, but work is under way.

  New doors and utils will be uploaded to Aminet in comm/bbs, and will
begin with 'rcn' to make it easier to locate the special doors/utils
(according to the author).

  The BBS system does also support XEM libraries, which means you can get
RIP support by just adding the xemrip.library to your system.  There's also
support for ANSI mouse.

DOCUMENTATION

  The documentation is all in AmigaGuide format, and it includes
documentation for the system, as well as docs about special escape codes,
and a separate doc file for FPL (Frexx Programming Language, which is a C
like language), which is used for writing the menus, as well as other stuff
that you want to change in the BBS system.  The upcoming v14 of FPL will
also include a compiler to speed up the execution of FPL programs.

  The documentation is easy to read, and explains all the functions of the
BBS system, new features, updates etc.  There's also autodocs for the
reccoon.library, and some example templates for writing your own doors.
The include files is only C versions, but there is work on E modules and
asm/E door templates.

  The autodocs could be better, as some functions is missing a description.

  You can still code your own doors without too much hassle, and you can
always mail Henric, or ask a question in any of the Fidonet support echos.


  I've always got fast replies from Henric concerning questions on how to
code certain stuff, and there's also a bunch of other Rcn sysops to ask
questions to, or talk with.

LIKES

  The best thing of this BBS system is that it uses FPL for scripts (ARexx
can be used if you want), which makes it very configurable.  There's also
both STDIO and GUI versions of the Config and UserEd programs (even though
the GUI versions has to be updated to include the new stuff).  The msg part
is also good, as it supports MSGID/REPLY linking.  The filebase has also
been improved to allow long filenames as well as long (more than two rows)
descriptions.  There's also going to be support for File_ID.DIZ in the
future.  I'm also running Enforcer to check all new programs that I
install, and I'm glad to say that Rcn hasn't given me any hits with this
version.

DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

  I would like to see some support for REPLY-ADDR kludges, as well as
To:/From: fields to enable good support for gated Internet EMail/News.

  The tosser is also a little bit slow, and it doesn't come with a GUI
config program, which would be much better, as it makes it easier to config
nodes/echos.  There isn't any good way to delete a msg area or a file area,
so you have to set the access to a high number to exclude it for users.

  I've talked to the author and he said it will be fixed in a later
version.

  One quirk with the system is the special version of FSED that comes with
the system.  This is the full screen editor that is used when writing msgs.
It's a bit old, and has some really annoying features, like when I press
=F6= (a swedish char) and the cursor goes down one line instead of printing
an =F6...  :(

COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

  I've only tested TransAmiga a little before I tested Rcn and registered.
As Rcn is a swedish product, and I live in Sweden, that made me chose Rcn,
as I could get fast support.  In comparision to TA I would say that Rcn is
easier to install and configure.  It has also got better Fidonet support in
the msg base.

BUGS

  There has been some bugs in earlier versions, but they're fixed in this
version.  I've had no problems at all since I installed 0.67.

VENDOR SUPPORT

  You can contact the author via Email at edc@klippan.se or through Fidonet
ar 2:200/236.  For his full address, see the beginning of this review.
There's also a couple of Fidonet msg echos and file echos where the author
and other Rcn sysops can exchange sources, help, suggestions etc.  These
Fidonet echos are exported to the UK as well, so if you want support in the
UK, then please contact Richard Bell at 2:251/31.

  I've written some doors for Rcn and I'm currently working on a new online
editor for Rcn, with support for signatures, headers, ANSI colours and a
lot of other stuff.  This editor is a port from OS/2, where it was
originally written by Bj=F6rn Stenberg (2:201/328 or bjst@sth.frontec.se).
I've added a lot of stuff since the original port, and also removed some
bugs.  The reason I ported it was that there was no support for FSED any
more (there is a special version of FSED for Rcn included in the archive)
so I thought I should fix a better editor.  Beta testing is currently under
way, and a full release will be included in the next release of Rcn.

WARRANTY

  The author doesn't take any responsibility if anything goes wrong.  You
use the program on your own risk.

CONCLUSIONS

  The conclusion will be that this is a great BBS packages, with a few
glitches like no News/Email support and no File_ID.DIZ support (yet!).

  The tosser is a little bit slow, and doesn't have all those fancy things
I wanted, so I run another tosser for the main tossing and only use
ReccProc to import/export msgs to the BBS.  It do contain a msg filter
though, so you can add your own robots, like Areafix/Raid programs.  The
Fidonet msg system is also very good.

  I give it four out of five stars.  The product gives a good first
impression, and the easy installation makes it even more positive in the
first impression.  When you get the feel of the system I'm sure you're
gonna like it even more, at least I did.

  The easy way to create doors and add scripts makes the system very
configurable, and you can add almost anything to your personal setup.  With
both ARexx and FPL supported, you can easily add customized menus, add
extra menus to the GUI, and a lot of other stuff.

===========================================================================

Two years ago during the computer show here in cologne, the original Chinon
drives were dumped out for a price lower than 100DM ($66 I guess) but I
didn't buy one.  A few weeks later I heard that Chinon kicked these drives
out of their product family.  That's life...

Time goes by and I reached a point where a HD-drive became very important
for me (PC-Task, Shapeshifter).  But there are no drives on the market.

This spring I saw an advertisment of the German firm "Amtrade".  They
offered the drive I was searching for.  One day later I ordered an internal
one for my A2000 (running in a PC-Bigtower).  It took about four weeks for
delivery.

This drive is a TEAC one with a little hardware plugged on the floppy
connector.  The whole magic does a PAL and a little modification on the
floppy-board.  The way of connection is like the normal drives.

After inserting and connecting the drive, I started my test.  This software
works fine with the drive:

- PC-Task
- Shapeshifter
- CrossDos
- CrossMac
- SuperDuper

From my point of view this drive is 99.99% compatible with all system
friendly programms.

The internal A1200-version includes the floppy-fix for the newer
A1200-models.  External drives are availiable too.  I don't know if there
is a version for the A3000 (it seems to be question of the right
eject-button).

                           Review: Aminet Set 3
                            By: @{"Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Aminet Set 1 was stunning in scope.  Aminet Set 2, a year later, was a
welcome update.  But Aminet Set 3, coming about six months later, is a big
surprise.

If you're unfamiliar with Aminet, you're missing out on a global
phenomenon.  Now recognized as the largest archive of freely
redistributable software not just for the Amiga but for ANY platform,
Aminet is THE place to get non-commercial Amiga programs, tools, music,
pictures, you name it.  A few years back, Aminet CDs began to surface,
gaining popularity and acceptance as 3 month, then two month installments
under publisher Schatztruhe.  The Set was a way to compile the entire
Aminet, and later its updates, into small, portable 4-disc sets.

Aminet Set 3 is the wealth of files accumulated since Aminet Set 2, and
also includes new material compiled after the release of the 12th Aminet
CD.  Some of the massive gain in a short time has been accomplished through
integrating other sources of data (in other words, it wasn't all just
spontaneously uploaded by enthusiastic masses), but it is there and it is
new to Aminet all the same.

Seen one, you've seen them all, more or less.  The ever-present AmigaGuide
interface is back, allowing you to uncompress and run software directly off
the CDs, search for titles, configure your own viewing software, and more.
What might make Aminet Set 3 more attractive to you, if you're still
reeling from the data overload of owning the Set 1 or perhaps a
subscription, is the commercial goodies on the Set.

Recent Aminet CDs have been publishing specially licensed commercial
software, and a number of the offerings have been quite attractive.  On the
Set 3, you will find a few games (still not very good), OctaMED 5 (well
worth a look), XiPaint 3.2 (the very capable 24-bit paint package) and
Imagine 4, which to my mind is the biggest goodie since, well, since
Imagine 3 was released on CU Amiga's coverdisk last winter.

What's more, there's a brochure included that offers special upgrade prices
to XiPaint 4 for under US$50, Imagine 5 for US$125, a special Imagine 3D
object CD for US$20, and OctaMED Sound Studio 1 for under US$40.  It's a
lot of savings.

Do you NEED Aminet Set 3?  Well, while there is overlap between Aminets
since the Set 2 and this one, the commercial software is quite a bargain.
All of the completely new files are categorized separately in the
AmigaGuide index, so you can easily get to what you don't already have on
file.  But as to whether or not you NEED the set versus just being content
to access Aminet via FTP or the Web, that's always a personal decision.

To my mind, it's staggering to think that Aminet now sprawls over 24 CDs
and for that reason alone, it's worth considering being a part of that
history.  I think this set categorizes directories a bit better over the 4
discs, making things more reasonable to find.  Give it some serious
thinking, particularly if graphics or music are on your mind.

===========================================================================
        Review: How to Buy a Computer (Australian) by John Pospisil
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Published in May of this year, the book How To Buy a Computer was written
by John Pospisil, Amiga enthusiast.  John and I have been in touch for over
a year now, talking about the Amiga and its role in the Australian
marketplace.  That role can be seen, somewhat, through his book, published
by the Australian Consumers' Association, roughly analagous to the
organization behind the American Consumer Reports magazine.

John's book is for regular people who think they might want to buy a
computer.  The book is cleanly laid out into sections, which take you
through the questions "Do I really need and want a computer?", "What IS a
computer, anyway?", "What can I do with a computer?" and then gets into
Internet discussions and learning how to use a computer.  Finally, it gets
down to "Which computer should I buy?"

John had to fight to get what Amiga references he did into the book.  I
will say this for him: he, along with Storm Front Studios (former
publishers of Australia's last Amiga publication) got a lot of Amiga
screenshots into the book.  The problem is that John rarely gets them
credited to the Amiga, so they're just faceless screenshots of Term and
Imagine et al--enough so that WE realize what they are, but not enough so
that the unsuspecting reader actually gets the message.

When it boils down to the "what to buy" section, the Amiga is left out of
the hard-core comparison between the PC and Mac.  We get two pages,
complete with a mini-history lesson on the Amiga, overview of the OS and
Amiga advantages, and mini-reviews on the A1200 and A4000T.  The verdict on
the 1200 is that it's a good home machine, and the 4000T is blasted for its
price.  Its future prospects are given as nebulous...which I suppose means
John knows about as much as the rest of us. :)

While the book will be of little interest to Amiga users--even if you're
considering switching platforms, John's book is aimed at the first-time
buyer so you'll have the answers to most of his questions already, if not
all of them--it's good to see the Amiga get some mainstream recognition.
If I was the editor, I would of course have put a whole lot more Amiga
information in there.  On the other hand, the number of writers and editors
that wouldn't have seen clear to giving the Amiga as much exposure as this
book does is far greater, so I can't complain.  From a totally objective
standpoint, I think John did a competent job of really explaining the basic
differences between the platforms and allowing people to make their own
decisions--there is no "Windows 95 is the wave of the future, catch it now
or drown" rhetoric that's become so popular over the past year.

===========================================================================
                        Review: DblScan 4000 by PLP
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Back in the old days, people tried all sorts of things to get rid of
high-res flicker, because it looked really nasty on a 1084 monitor.
Turning down the contrast was just annoying, so most who were serious about
the problem would buy devices like Commodore and Microway flickerfixers,
Flicker Free Videos, and would install these in their machines.  They let
you put a VGA monitor on your system so that high-res screens wouldn't have
nasty interlace jitters.

Then, the wonderful minds at Commodore put a flicker-fixer in the A3000.
And it worked, overall, wonderfully.  But when AGA machines came around,
there was little relief in sight.  The only good option was to get a nice
multisync monitor and pretend the interlace wasn't there.

But the problem THEN became that good multisync monitors (those that can
handle the Amiga's 15khz modes) became very hard to find--and those you
COULD find were rather expensive.  So Petsoff Limited Partnership has come
up with a solution.  For about $200, you can put your A4000's built-in
video on a standard VGA 15-pin socket, with all of your 15khz screens
bumped up to a nice steady 31khz display.

Which is exactly what it does, for most people.  The DblScan 4000 is a tiny
card that fits in the video slot (or one of your video slots, if you have a
4000T) and promotes the built-in AGA display modes to 31khz where
applicable.  (DBL modes, which are at 27 khz, are not affected.)  Less than
a dozen chips are on the card, and installation is brutally easy.  No
software drivers, it just works.

That is, unless you have one of the makes of power supply that the DblScan
4000 is unhappy with.  Even after PLP sent a replacement board with a
better capacitor, to try to get around the power supply glitches, our
desktop A4000 was not happy with the DblScan 4000.  The display would lose
all cohesion within 15 minutes, which was a shame.  On most Commodore 4000
desktops, and all those with beefier power supplies, this is not a problem.

My German (Eagle-built) A4000T performs wonderfully with the DblScan
installed.  Occasionally, there are a few seconds of "fuzzy" display soon
after powering on, but the problem quickly clears up.

So, what's the point of owning one?  Even if you're a self-proclaimed power
applications user and have no truck with games, you still need a 15khz
display to view certain key screens, such as the Early Startup Screen and
gurus.  A standard VGA monitor will not give you these.  Some older
software just refuses to promote properly, and requires a 15khz display.

Multisync monitors continue to be pretty pricey for Amiga users.  While the
1764 is a great product, it is not available globally.  The 20" TIMM
supports 15khz modes but is too blurry for some.  This card allows you to
put the finest Iiyama SVGA monitor on your system and use it like a champ.

The only competing product I've seen mention of is sold by Power Computing
of the UK.  While reviews were favorable, the card is roughly 3X the price
of the DblScan.  Compatibility with other Amiga hardware and software is
impeccable--basically, not a whole lot can go wrong.

If you need a video display solution on a standard VGA monitor that keeps
compatibility with 15khz modes for games and other projects, the DblScan is
a great choice.

@node REVIEW9 "Review: Apollo 1240/40 Accelerator"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                Review: Apollo 1240/40 Accelerator, Part 1
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

I remember when an 020/14 seemed really, really fast.  Unfortunately, to
most people, it doesn't seem that way anymore.  But the A1200 ships that
way, so you'll have to take matters into your own hands to cram some speed
into that little case.

The Apollo 1240/40 card aims to do just that.  Armed with a Motorola 68040
processor at 40mhz, fully equipped with FPU and MMU, your A1200 will get
quite a speed increase.

Installation is thankfully much easier than with the first 040 accelerator
we reviewed, the Falcon 040/25.  The Apollo is self-contained, with a
smaller 040 package than the Falcon's.  The chip, a small heat sink and a
fan are all mounted on the side of the board that faces up into the
computer, the underside contains all the support logic, SIMM slot, and the
SCSI module header.  (The SCSI module is sold separately and unfortunately
was not provided for review.)

Pop in a SIMM up to 32 megabytes and set the RAM jumper to on.  The board
takes care of the rest.  The only other jumper is the SCSI option jumper,
which you activate when you install the SCSI card.

Open up your A1200's trapdoor case (you may actually find it helpful to
just open the case outright, it makes putting these cards in a lot easier),
slide it in, and you're ready to go.  There is no necessary support
software, the 040 will configure automatically and you're off and running.
Unlike the Falcon, the card is not so huge that you'll never be able to get
it out--it's large enough to fit snugly in the trapdoor, but can be
manipulated in and out easily.

A stronger power supply is recommended by the card manufacturer but I have
noticed no ill effects on the A1200 with hard drive we used for testing.
It is worth noting that the chip, despite its heat sink and fan does get
mighty warm.

The operating manual is all of two A4-sized pieces of paper, which cover
the bare essentials of the accelerator's function.  For troubleshooting,
you're on your own.

We'll wait for benchmarks until AR 4.12, when we will compare the Falcon,
the Apollo 1240/40 and the Phase5 Blizzard 1260.  But here are some
real-world impressions of the 1240/40 card:

Functionally, the card is quite satisfying.  Just as it should, the system
is significantly sped up, even over the performance we got with the Falcon.
However, under CPU-intensive operations I noticed a tendency for the mouse
pointer to freeze up intermittently, in a way I've never seen before under
normal operation of other computer and accelerator configurations.

Speed is indeed faster than stock 040/25 configurations for both 3640 cards
(as found in 4000s and 4000Ts) and the Falcon.

To my mind, the Apollo supplants the Falcon in price and functionality, and
is the only marketed 040 solution that even approaches usability from a
heat and size perspective.  (Now that there's a Falcon alternative, I can't
recommend it in good conscience.  Phase5's upcoming 040 A1200 board is
intended for tower configurations only.)  Stay tuned for benchmarks, and
give the Apollo 1240/40 some serious thought if you're looking to get some
extra juice out of your A1200 without taking the 060 plunge.

                          Review: Mods Anthology
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Now that Mods Anthology is out, I don't want anybody to ever ask me again
if I know where they can find any mods.  The fact that this is billed as
"Volume 1" positively frightens me.

Uncompressed on 4 CD-ROMs, Mods Anthology 1 represents over two gigabytes
of MOD songs.  If you figure the average mod is 140k and lasts 4 minutes
(completely arbitrary figures), this means you're buying 61,371 minutes of
music.  That's 2557 days.  That's 7 years.

Now, granted, a whole lot of MODs are just awful.  And a lot of others
sound suspiciously similar.  (Yes, I understand the concept of a remix, but
that's not what I mean.)  But the fact remains that there are so many MODs
here that you've GOTTA find something you like.

Nicolas Franck, himself an Amiga composer and programmer, has been
collecting MODs for years.  And this is the motherlode.  Organized on 4
CD-ROMs by author (alphabetically spread out over CDs) with the fourth CD
dedicated to synth tunes, miscellaneous music, and "exotic formats",
there's a ridiculous number of MODs here.  Included is a version of
DeliTracker, one of the most versatile MOD players out there.  (Personally,
I find the Genie system it uses to be a bit overwhelming at times, but they
do allow the program to be very modular and powerful.)

There is an informative AmigaGuide readme file included and a search
facility.  Unfortunately, the search script does not seem to work
completely on my system: it will locate strings in song titles on all four
CDs, but will not interactively load them.

There are a great number of old favorites and modern classics on here, as
well as just about every MOD author on record.  Franck made every attempt
to contact all of the authors and gain their permission, which basically
just means that U4ia wouldn't allow for his MODs to be on the CD.  No news
here.

Each disc has a "click me first" icon, which brings up DeliTracker and a
few dozen of the best mods on each disc.  It's a good starting point,
although your taste may vary wildly from his.

Call me nutty, but one of my favorite parts of the collection is the
"PlaySID" collection on disc 4, which is a whole lot of C-64 SID tunes,
playable through DeliTracker.  You haven't lived until you've heard JCH's
West End Girls. :)

Despite the problems with the search engine, Mods Anthology 1 is just
that: an anthology, a tome, a massive collection of tunes.  If your
"music/mods" directory is boring you, pick up the Anthology.  Enjoy!

                        Amiga Report Mailing List
===========================================================================

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to majordomo@amigalib.com

Your subject header will be ignored.  In the body of the message, enter

subscribe areport

The system will automatically pull your e-mail address from the message
header.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!             **

                          UUDecoding Amiga Report
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

===========================================================================
                      Amiga Report Writing Guidelines
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

     4.  Please send us your article in ASCII format.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.

Please stipulate as well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to
the editor.

                  Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users
===========================================================================

                The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
                  "Not just another UNIX Shell account!"

          -------------------------------------------------------

Portal is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-service online SIG
(Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users.  We promise, and WE
DELIVER ongoing & aggressive Amiga support!  Now, more than ever, with so
many Amiga magazines gone or shrunken, you need a viable,
professionally-maintained resource for information, software, and a link to
the world-wide Amiga community.

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in many ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA high-speed modems (you pay for the phone call
if it's not local), or though any SprintNet or Compuserve indial anywhere
(with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell service!  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help, and you can easily customize
it for your favorite terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1100 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files or
      100 email letters at once, of any size, with one command.
 * Amiga vendor areas with many companies participating.
 * So many incoming lines you'll probably NEVER get a busy signal
 * 40 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 12,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.
 * Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
      related and get quick replies from the experts.
 * Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, AMosaic, LightWave, ImageFX,
      Picasso II & others feed right into the Zone message bases.  Read
      months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with them.
 * FREE unlimited Internet Email with 5 meg of free storage.
      Your email is private, secure, and never censored or monitored.
 * A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.
      You can run AMosaic and other Browses via your shell and explore the
      vast World Wide Web!  Intermediate to advanced users can use
      any standard UNIX mail and news utilities, compilers, and other
      tools.  Ask for your free UNIX book when you sign up.
 * A home for your own Web page!  Your UNIX Shell on Portal is linked
      to Portal's Web Server. Create your own WWW pages for the whole
      world to access. No extra charges!
 * Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which you can read
      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine. Newsgroups are not censored!
 * Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
      never worry "Ooops... Am I paying more for this area?" again!
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS wrapped into user-friendly
      menus.  And you get FREE unlimited usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
      email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
 * Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
      at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
