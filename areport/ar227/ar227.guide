AR Mailing List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report
in UUENCODED form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put
on the list, send Email to listserv@bbs.xnet.com and in the body of
the message put:

ADD <mailaddress> armag

ie: ADD rniles@goofy.com armag

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an
intact copy. For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming
messages.

Joining the Amiga Report Coverdisk list is just as easy, but REQUIRES
that your mail site be able to handle messages in excess of 600k.
Place the following in the body of a message to listserv@bbs.xnet.com:

ADD <mailaddress> ardisk

ie: ADD rniles@goofy.com ardisk

Many thanks to X-Net Information Systems for setting this service up
for us!

** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!

                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
World Wide Web
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AR can also be read with Mosaic (in either AmigaGuide or html form).
Reading AmigaReport with Mosaic removes the necessity to download it.
It can also be read using programs found in UNIX sites such as LYNX.

Simply tell Mosaic to open the following URL:
http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/People/mjw/Computer/Amiga/AR/MainPage.html

Mosaic for the Amiga can be found on Aminet in directory comm/net, or
(using anonymous ftp) on max.physics.sunysb.edu

Mosaic for X, Macintosh(tm) and Microsoft Windows(tm) can be found on
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu


                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Aminet
~~~~~~
To get Amiga Report from Aminet, simply FTP to any Aminet site, CD
to docs/mags. All the back issues are located there as well.
(ftp.cdrom.com or ftp.wustl.edu are two sites)

UUEncoding/Decoding (thanks to Bob Tomasevich for the quick tutorial)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is uuencoding and uudecoding?
----------------------------------
uuencoding is converting a binary file into text (ASCII) which can be
sent through mail or Usenet.  uudecoding is reversing the process
(e.g. converting the file back to binary).


Why would I want to do this?
----------------------------
You have to send a binary file to a user who does not have
FTP access, or the user is too lazy to FTP the file.


What is the normal procedure?
-----------------------------
1. Convert the binary file into ASCII, using uuencode.
2. Send the file, through email, to the user.
3. The person on the receiving end gets the email, which may
   be split into parts.  If the email is split into parts, the
   parts must be combined, in the order received, into one file.
4. Receiving person converts the file back into binary, using uudecode.


What does a uuencoded file look like?
-------------------------------------
The start always has:

    begin 644 <encoded file's name>

So, for the file happy-happy-joy-joy.txt, it would look like:

    begin 644 happy-happy-joy-joy.txt

The encoded file begins right after:

M1TE&.#=A@`+@`9<````$`*QB15=2.+&/@R(Y)XM8.=J]H+*%7BL6#8]F6EP_]
M*$=E5"L?L-Z8A-:#60\@$,9P27-4-YB#;4HY)U!L9KZNE\O"O["#;8]82SDF>
M&[%J4FI',.&:E`48#="4@SE41M61<R`@%R$\,9:.?&!Z=NWM_\V';H-D1TI`=

.. more lines like the above ..

M>(`)N(`-^(`1.($5>($9N($=^($A.((E>((IN((M^((Q.(,U>(,YN(,]^(-!+
&V"\"`@`[&
``
end              <-- the end of the encoded file
size 151341      <-- size of the original file


So, how would I do this on the Amiga?
-------------------------------------
There are many uuencode/decode variants out there, but most usually
have kept the old UNIX command line, which can be confusing to novices,
or, require you to remove all mail headers and other, non-uuencoded text.

Luckily, Asher Feldman took the time to write UUxt.


What is UUxT?
-------------
It is a program which performs both the uuencode/decode operations in
one executable, AND, can also pack/unpack LhA archives.


Tell me more.
-------------
The UUxT archive contains UUxT, the CLI version, and UUxtGUI, the
Workbench interface.  I will give a short summary of how to use
both.  Detailed instructions are included in the UUxT archive.

  CLI Version:
  ------------

  Running UUxT without any options gives the following:

     UUxT Version 2.1a Copyright (c)1993 Asher Feldman
     USAGE: UUxT [option] [archive name] <LhA archive name> <file(s)>
     options: a - encode           l - LhAencode
              x - decode           u - LhAdecode

  showing the format of the command line and the valid options.


  Some example command lines:

  1. Normal encoding - UUxt a filename.uue filename-to-archive

  2. Normal decoding - UUxt x filename.uue

  3. LhA archiving and encoding -

            UUxT l filename.uue filename.lha file1 file2 ...

  4. Decoding and LhA unarchiving - UUxT u filename.uue

  For LhA encoding and decoding, you will need LhA by Stefan Boberg.


  Workbench (GUI) Version:
  ------------------------

  (1) Clicking on this brings up a requester to select the file you want
      to perform the operation shown in gadget (5).

  (2) You can manually type here the filename of the file affected by the
      operation indicated in gadget (5).

  (3) Used only for encoding, brings up a requester to select where the
      encoded file should go.  Selecting an existing file will cause the
      existing file to be replaced by the encoded file.  You can also use
      this requester to create directories.

  (4) You can manually type the filename of the file to be the encoded file.

  (5) The operation to perform on file shown in (2).  The operations are
      the four provided by UUxT (uuencode/uudecode/LhAEncode/LhADecode).

  (6) The name of the archive created with the LhAEncode option.  Ignored
      when any other operation is selected.

  (7) Does the encode/decode/LhAEncode/LhADecode and pops up a requester
      indicating if the operation was successful or not.


I need this!  Where can I get it?
---------------------------------
If you use the Internet from a local BBS, you may find it there.  If not
you can FTP it from wuarchive.wustl.edu, in the directory

                          pub/aminet/arc/UUxT.lha

It should also be on the Aminet mirrors.


Thanks for the explanation!  How can I reach you if I have questions?

Unfortunately, I once again have to report that there really isn't much
of anything to report.  Business is going at its normal pace as of late:
slowly.  New products continue to be put out, but the entire market seems
to be in a state of suspended animation...waiting...waiting...

Amiga Report is committed to being one of the first, if not THE first
Amiga publication to announce the conclusion to this nonsense.  Of
course, we'll try to be damned sure that our source is accurate before we
go announcing it like fools...basically, if I receive a call from a
Commodore branch or a Commodore bidder, I'll print a rush-issue.  But
that isn't likely to happen just yet.

Interesting letters keep popping up, so quite a few grace this issue.

Incidentally, we DO now have detailed instructions for uudecoding, in
case there are readers who need a quick course.  Select the "Internet"
option from the bottom of the magazine's main menu.

For readers interested in contacting me directly: Amiga Report's main
office has moved.  My information-button (located above) reflects the
magazine's new address and voice number.  My E-Mail account remains
the same.  Because of the move, I haven't had a chance to set up any
provisions for fax, but I'll take care of that.  Hopefully.

Here's to hoping for a concrete solution in the near future...

A recent rumor prompted me to call Alex Amor at CEI.  While I didn't
believe the rumor itself, per se, it was more detailed than most and
allowed me to put certain questions directly to him and have them
answered.  The rumor revolved around a completed C= UK buyout, and gave
information about pending creditor meetings and the like.  The buyout
itself proved to be false, as I suspected.

However, as I talked to him, the liquidators called him.  We hung up,
but I called him again the next day.  His voice mail message told me that
he would be traveling that day and the next (Thursday and Friday),
which puzzled me since he hadn't mentioned any trips.  I thought perhaps
his departure had to do with the rumor I handed him.

Finally, Tuesday, I got a hold of him again.  He had returned and was
leaving again the next day for New York.  I prodded around to find out
why he had left, and when I asked him, "Was it something drastic?" he
said, "Yes, something drastic has happened, but I can't go into detail."
He was about to start a meeting with his bankers to, as he put it, "talk
about what it is we need to do."  End of conversation, he said he would
get back to me when he was back in his office.

Hmmmm.

[As an aside: I recently reported on Usenet that Amor would be gone until
December 12th.  There was a miscommunication and I apologize.]

Subject: Reader response regarding GVP 040 Combo review/AR226

In response to the Comprehensive GVP Combo '040 accelerator test in AR226:

Maxwell Daymon has made a very thorough job on the test, and we thank him for
that, but there are some both minor and major fact errors in the review, which
I'd like to point out, as not to confuse others.

First, Maxwell claims that DMA host adaptors as a rule are subject to serial
port hardware overruns. While this isn't false in some cases (mainly GVP has
problems), it certainly isn't true in most. Commodore DMA host adaptors
generally behave very nicely, and the A3000 H/A is a very serial-friendly
dude, since it hardly uses up any bus time at all during transfers. due to
it's 32-bit wide, 25MHz high bandwidth architecture. A normal harddisk running
at the top of it's lungs will generally only require a few percent of the
A3000's bus, and even with the SCSI bus fully saturated, about 75% bus time
should be available for the serial.device interupt server.

And one should realize: having a CPU-polled H/A is no guarrantee against
overruns, they rear their ugly head even in that camp. The benefit in this
case of having a DMA H/A, is that not all CPU-time is consumed during harddisk
transfers.

The thing that causes these serial overruns in the first case is the size of
the DMA packets being sent out on the SCSI bus. GVP adaptors use very large
packets (probably to squeeze out some extra performance), while most other DMA
adaptors use more moderate sizes. This can be adjusted with the MAXTRANSFER
parameter. Toying with it will *not* destroy anything, altough it's a good
idea to keep note of the original value, since increasing it might cause
undesirable system operation (serial overruns, glitches in module replayers
etc) while the harddisks are working. Decreasing it on the other hand, might
reduce file transfer performance. GVPPatch reduces the maxtransfer only while
the internal serial port is open; and sets it to 512 bytes. That's why your
harddisks will reach almost floppydisk performance during file transfers. As a
general rule: if it ain't broke, don't fix it! That means: fiddle only with
the maxtransfer values if you have serial overrun problems, and try first to
use GVPPatch (if you have a GVP H/A, that is).

It might also be a good idea to switch serial.device for BaudBandit.device
(v1.4c is the most recent, to my knowledge). This is a stripped-down serial
handler (only RTS/CTS handshake and 8N1 serial parameters), but it's blazingly
fast, and uses substantially less CPU time than Commodore's device. Even up to
57kbps could be possible on an unaccelerated machine. Unfortunately, it
doesn't work very well in some systems, however. Try it out, if it gurus,
throw it out. 8^)

Maxwell also says that the A3000 is SCSI1, while the GVP card is SCSI2. That
is incorrect, both host adaptors utilizes the SCSI2 command set, in a beta
version. This is due to the fact that they both use the same Western Digital
SCSI bus controller chip, one that is known as the "00-04 PROTO" chip. This
version uses a version of SCSI2 that isn't finalized, and this causes
incompatibility, mainly with certain tape and CDROM drives, but also with some
harddisks. This chip can in the A3000 be replaced with the "00-08" (or
sometimes also called "00-08 PROTO") chip, which contains true SCSI2. This
will also give the benefit of improved performance in some setups! GVP users
have a harder time, since GVP saw fit to surface mount the SCSI chip, and it
will require either a very skilled hand or special equipment to replace it.

Maxwell's problems with a SCSI2 drive might in this case lie more in the
specific SCSI implementation, either in software or hardware, in the A3000,
rather than depend on wether the H/A is SCSI1 or SCSI2. Replacing the SCSI
chip in the A3000 with the "00-08" version should cure all his problems. Also
worth mentioning: SCSI2 is fully downwards compatible with SCSI1, so nobody
don't worry about not being able to use new drives on old controllers.

Maxwell also has major gripes about ExpertPrep, and I understand him fully as
an Series2 A500-HD+ owner. I use Commodore's HDToolBox software instead of
GVPs unstable junk. It might not be able to set every parameter there is, but
in it's latest incarnations, it supports the most useful stuff, and it's
stable as a rock. HDToolBox has *never* screwed up on me, during my five years
as an Amiga harddisk owner. It will always warn you if you risk destroying any
data, so it's not neccessary to backup before changing basic stuff like
harddisk buffers, mask value or maxtransfer.

And by the way:  to use HDToolBox with any of GVP's Series2 host adaptors, you
need to add the following tool type to HDTB's icon:

SCSI_DEVICE_NAME=gvpscsi.device

And that's it!

Finally, regarding the "to be or not to be" of an MMU in 'EC030 processors:

Yes, there *is* an MMU in many chips. However, it's often not working at all,
and will be disabled. But in fact, some batches of 'EC030 CPUs has been
delivered with fully working MMUs, because of short supply of "real" 'EC030
chips, some 'RC030 processors have been labelled as 'EC030. It should be
pointed out though, that it will be just by pure, dumb luck to have one of
these, fully functional MMU chips in your accelerator/A4000-030, do not count
on it!

Then again, many an happy 'EC030 owner has found out to have a partly working
MMU, that will in fact be able to catch some Enforcer hits, but not all, and
not able to run VMEM utilities, like GigaMEM. It's worth trying out with
Enforcer if you have an (albeit partly) working MMU, nothing will be destroyed
if you try. 8^) There's example programs that generates various types of hits,
and you'll be able to see which ones of them your MMU catches.

Now, do not take this as I think that everything Maxwell Daymon said in his
review is all crap and lies; that's not true. He did a really good job in his
test, and it's hard to write something as big as his review without making a
few mistakes. I have probably goofed myself somewhere above on these lines. If
that proves to be the case, feel free to tell me so!

Last, and not least: Thank You All at Amiga Report for devoting your time for
making this wonderful, wonderful magazine! It's always nice to snuggle up in
front of the screen with warm tea, chocolate chip cookies and a fresh issue of
AR! May the Haynie be with you forever, and never stop making AR! 8^)

-   Thank you for the reply.  I'd never envisioned a reader snuggling with
    AR before.  And considering that AR has survived into 3 editors now,
    I think it has some staying power...

Hi Jason !
First, I would like to comment on your leader about C= (AR#2.25).

I can understand why people worry if a new U.K "Commodore" wouldn't
give a damn about the USA, but remember... it's business.
Let's say Pleasance gets the Amiga, he must show his creditors that
he can make a profit on the Amiga, or they will dump it.
Why produce NTSC Amigas+US marketing when there's no Amiga friendly
_market_ over there, while back in the UK the Amiga is the leading
platform. (atleast for homecomputing and games)

Sure, it would be nice if they could, but it's probably to expensive.
So, I do really hope that CEI will get the license to produce the Amiga
in the US+Canada, so that the UK team can provide Europe with what we need.
I believe this is something YOU americans should push and really struggle
for (not only Americans of course), take contact with both CEI and the
UK team, make it happen...

Take care,
Fredrik

-   Well, nothing is finalized yet...and, of course, there's always the
    argument about whether or not there's an Amiga market.  It's there, it
    just doesn't realize it yet.  If Commodore, inept thought it was,
    could produce machines for the world before, it's bound to be able to,
    eventually, again.

 Jason,
 I have a problem with my CDTV.  I attempted to upgrade my CDTV to 2.1 os
 by installing developer roms(eproms) and a 2.04 rom. Well it didn't work-
 I got nothing but a dark gray screen. if there was no CD in the machine
 I wou;ld still get the CDTV logo but inserting any CD freezes the unit.
 What can be up? BTW I have reinstalled the original eproms, rom and I still
 have the no-op condition.
 Any help *will* be appreciated.

Subject: submission

[This is a bit of a retrospective by Roy, but it's more of a testimonial
than anything, so this seemed a good enough place for it...-Ed]

Not too long ago it was said around my house that I had simply gone
mad - tipped over the edge by some simple complication that had
happened to me one day for no simple reason.  I would shuffle around
the house muttering to myself and occasionally make a lunge for the
telephone to make a call to who-knows-where, followed by another
phone call to somewhere else, and finally settle back in my chair
and mope for a few hours before falling into a blue funk over . . .
well, nobody could understand unless they had a similar problem -
or a similar fate.  I was an orphan, or so I felt.  And I was the
darndest, most unlucky orphan I knew of.  Mine was the fate of
being left behind in an industry which seemingly didn't care for
the unlucky end-user who happened to love their products.

I was on the verge of upgrading my Amiga 2500 to the much-needed Dos2.1
level, having forever been told that I should do so, because 1.3 was
just not that good anymore ...  So, not wanting to invest in another
computer system just yet, (mind you, it would have to have been
another Amiga.  I get enough of Pee-Cees in my electrical enginnering
department at the school I attend) I decided that upgrading my existing
computer was the most logical step to take.  My A2500 was worth more
sitting on my desk than it would be getting sold to somebody else.

So gradually I had purchased the ECS chipset and installed everything
except for the 2.x rom.  My problems started when I obtained that
rom.  After that point, it was one swap after another (mostly
concerning my A2630 accelerator not being compatible with the 2.x
upgrade, and having to find a working set of eproms for that.)  To
make an extremely long story very tight and tidy, I spend 5 months
of hair-pulling, long distance phone calls, talking to every
dealer I could find, sending my accelerator to various places,
and finally got it to work.  To this day, nobody can give me the
correct story, but essentially it boils down to that particular
product (the A2630) not being supported by its parent company (C=)
anymore.  Well, many changes have happened since I got the support
I needed (by Kasara Microsystems by the way), both to C= and to
my computer system.

I've purchased a Picasso II graphics board, a high-speed Zoom modem,
another hard disk, a nice 17" monitor, and AmigaDOS3.1.  And it's
all plugged into my humble little A2500.  I can't begin to describe
how much use I've gotten out of this system.  Mostly it has to do with
the wonderful support I get over Internet.  People, if you haven't
explored the Amiga areas in Internet, get a move on!  Most of
my current setup, as far as software is concerned, has originated
from Internet downloads.  To name a few, avm&Fax (a Great little
voice mail and fax package!!!), new Picasso drivers (which seem
to come out fairly regularly from Expert Services), On The Ball
(a calendar, scheduler, alarm clock, etc), numerous commodities
such as Yak, PowerSnap, MagicMenus.  Also, one of the most obvious
additions to my system is Magic Workbench, a collection of icons
and backgrounds for the Workbench.  <<May I put in a plug here for
supporting your Amiga developers if you are able.  They have to
eat too, and I'd say that the $50 I paid Al Villarica for avm&Fax
is well-worth it.  His technical support has been next-to-none,
and he's even made custom changes and bug-fixes for me, a day
after I talk to him about it.>>

I'm glad I stuck with my computer system through thick and thin.
The thin wasn't my computer's fault, nor do I wish to place blame
on anyone.  These are simply hard times we're living in.  But I'm
really happy with my Amiga system, and when I can afford it, I'll
probably upgrade to an A4000, or better, but for now I'll stick
with it.  <<The only thing I need now is more memory (don't we all...)
You ever tried to do HUGE raytraces at the same time you're trying
to do a lot of other things?  Memory tends to get eaten up rather
fast that way.  A small commercial here:  I've been hunting for a
DKB2632 expansion board for quite a while.  That's the simm memory
board that fits piggy-back on the A2630 accellerator.  They don't
appear to be making them anymore at DKB (maybe the plan on it in
the future, I don't know), and nobody wants to let go of them used,
so what's the deal here?  :)  Anyone want to sell me yours?  Sorry,
I just had to do that.>>

So anyway, everyone has a story, and I'm sure everyone would like
to hear yours as well.

Subject: Amiga-Report


Dear Mr Compton & all the AR staff:

  I just wanted to send a brief note to let you know that I enjoy Amiga
Report, ie that you do have a reader out here.  I think that you are
doing a *great* job of keeping us Amigans informed about events and
happenings in our part of the world.

  I first discovered AR about 6 months ago when I first got access, at
work, to the big world of the InterNet.  After downloading AR the first
time, I found that it was very worthwhile and up-to-date; now I have to
check for AR the first thing on my weekly trips to the InterNet.  I guess
that AR has become an even more important source of information with the
Commodore situation.

  My uses of the Amiga are pretty tame, compared to many of you, so I'm
afraid that I truly don't have anything useful to contribute to AR or to
the Amiga community as a whole.  I use my A2000 very much as home
computer.  Word processing, a small PD spreadsheet, a small PD database,
my geanealogy program, and a bunch of games.  I'm not especially good at
art/graphics or at music, and just don't have a lot of interest in Video,
so that makes me sort of a different Amiga user, I guess.  I have had
experience with IBM and MAC at work, and I consider the Amiga *far*
superior to either of them.  It is very powerful, and still remains easy
to use.

  Again, thank you for AR.  I like it and find it very useful.  Now to
see if I can actually get this sent to you.  I will have to copy this
note to an IBM-formatted disk using PC-task, then translate to the MAC I
use at work, before I can send it via an e-mail that I don't understand
very well at all.  Best wishes to you and all the AR staff.  Keep it up.

Don Feldbruegge  (dh.feldbruegge@hosp.wisc.edu)

-    No problem.  AR is, more and more, becoming an important part of the
     Amiga community, and it pleases me to no end to see that.

     Incidentally, there's no reason for anyone to be ashamed of not
     being an Amiga power-user...I certainly don't push my 3000 to render,
     spindle, and mangle graphics or blast out powerful original tunes...
     AR pushes it to the limit and that's enough.

News Media "Wake-Up" Call - An Amiga Letter-Writing Campaign

Despite the fact I am a loyal Amiga user,  it is no secret the platform
must have a bigger share of the computer marketplace, if it is to
survive....let alone grow.  Right now, due to the liquidation precedings,
the Amiga market is in disarray.  What's needed is a letter-writing
campaign directed at the network news media.  The purpose of the campaign
is to get the network news media to investigate the Commodore situation.
Personally, I think Irving Gould and Medhi Ali profited from Commodore at
the expense of employees, end users and shareholders.  I can't prove that.
I do, however, believe it to be the truth.

As you know, when prodded properly, the network news media has proven it
can get innocent people out of jail.  Perhaps, it can also  help put the
guilty behind bars as well.  Amigans, let's ask for network news media help
- to showcase the Amiga and expose Commodore corruption at the same time.
Yes, this situation has all the "charm" of a network news story.  So, let's
get the show on the road.  What follows are various contacts:

Remember, you cannot make a positive difference in the future of anything

Please get involved.  Express your feelings and concerns via letter, fax
and e-mail to the parties previously listed.  But, that's not all. Help
spread news of this campaign to Amigans all over the world via Internet,
Usenet groups and commercial online services.  Your positive efforts
combined with those of others throughout the world  will help change the
future of the Amiga platform for the better.


P.S. It doesn't hurt to be clever when sending your messages of concern.
Afterall, you are competing with many other "messages of concern."  It is
easy to be overlooked.  That is why after sending letters and faxes to ABC
News and not getting any feedback, I decided to do something quite
out-of-the-ordinary. I decided to send flowers to Deborah Amos of ABC News
"Turning Point."  This time I got feedback in the form of a personal phone
call from Deborah Amos.  But, that's not all. She also gave me the
opportunity to plead my case for a news investigation of Commodore.  So, if
by chance, you don't get any feedback from your messages, try sending
flowers.  The results may surprise you.

%% Review: HyperCache Professional v2.0                By: William Near %%
%% An inexpensive disk cache solution             W.NEAR@genie.geis.com %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Description:  HyperCache Professional is a device caching program. It can
be used to speed up data access by as much as 3000% on devices such
as: SCSI & IDE hard drives, CD-ROM drives and floppy drives.

Price:  I paid 19.95 + $3.00 S&H as an upgrade from v1.01b direct from
Silicon Prairie.

System Requirements:  512K RAM, Workbench 2.04 or higher, hard drive
recommended

System tested on: Amiga 2000, Workbench 3.1, GForce '030 accelerator
@ 50MHz., 1MB CHIP + 6MB FAST memory, 2 standard floppy drives,
Quantum LP270S hard drive with Trumpcard Professional controller.


PACKAGING

HyperCache Professional v2.0 (HCP) came with a 19 page manual, one
disk, a registration card and a letter containing an addendum to the
installation instructions contained in the manual all shrink wrapped
together.


INSTALLATION

HCP uses the standard Commodore Installer program which makes the
program easy to set up on your hard drive. HCP will create its own drawer
in the directory or partition that you specify during installation. The installer
places a library (rexxhost.library) in your LIBS directory, well sort of.
It also places HyperCachePrefs, HyperCache.guide, HyperCacheStats, and an
ARexx drawer inside its drawer.

The included addendum letter states the following: "We have learned that
in certain system configurations where multiple partitions are available to
install to, the HyperCache installation program is unable to locate a
required library. If you receive such an error message while installing,
re-start the installation, select Intermediate or Expert installation, and
install to the SYS: partition. We have been unable to reproduce this problem
in-house, and it has proven to be quite rare, but the above steps have
always cured it."

Well, I experienced this "rare" problem during the installation of HCP. I
followed the addendum instructions, but this didn't cure the problem either.
I called Silicon Prairie's tech support number and the representative told
me to re-install the program to my SYS: partition. He also stated that they
had traced the problem to an error in their installation script. The third
try at installing HCP was unsuccessful, so I resorted to manually copying the
"missing" library to the LIBS directory on my SYS: partition and running the
installation program one more time. This time it worked flawlessly, but it
was somewhat of a hassle because of the script error by Silicon Prairie -
nothing major, just annoying.

At the end of the installation process you are asked if you want HCP to
automatically run upon booting up your system. If you answer yes the
Installer will add a line to your S:User-Startup file. I chose not to have
the Installer add the line to my User-Startup and instead placed the HCP
program in my WBStartup drawer. Finally, the installation process ends by
asking what type CPU you are using, either 68000 or 68020 and then it
starts the HyperCachePrefs program.

If you want to cache more than one device then you must create multiple
copies of the HCP icon and rename them appropriately. I have three icons
in my WBStartup drawer:  HyperCacheHD, HyperCacheDF0, and
HyperCacheDF1. The Tooltypes were modified for each of the three icons
to correspond with the type of device being cached. It is not necessary to
cache each partition of a device such as a hard drive. When you cache a
hard drive HCP caches the entire device, creating multiple caches for the
same device would waste memory and would not improve performance.
The same caching setup could have been accomplished by adding the
appropriate lines to my S:User-Startup script, but I found it much more
convenient to just put the icons in my WBStartup drawer where they can be
easily modified using the Icon/Information menu choice from Workbench.


HyperCachePrefs

HCP's GUI, known as HyperCachePrefs, opens a small window in the
center of your Workbench screen which contains various areas for
adjusting parameters for the operation of the disk caching. You may access
the interface at any time by selecting the HyperCachePrefs icon contained
in the drawer you specified at installation. The interface consists of:
Available Storage Volumes List, Device Driver, Unit Number, Cache Size,
Number of Lines, Line Size, Write Rentention Time, Quiet Write Time, and
finally, Save, Use and Cancel buttons.

* Available Storage Volumes List - Displays all available devices for
possible caching.

* Device Driver - Displays the device driver for the selected device i.e.
scsi.device, trackdisk.device, etc. The Device Driver is automatically
updated when a device is selected from the Available Storage Volumes
List.

* Unit Number - Displays the selected device's unit number. The Unit
Number is automatically updated when a device is selected from the
Available Storage Volumes List.

* Cache Size - Displays the size of the current cache according to the
Number of Lines setting.

* Number of Lines - This parameter is the primary setting for determining
the size of the selected device's cache. Increasing the Number of Lines will
make the cache larger; conversely, decreasing the Number of Lines will
make the cache smaller (256 lines = 512K cache, 512 lines = 1024K
cache, etc.)

* Line Size - This parameter controls how far HCP reads ahead (known as
prefetching) in the data from your device and the amount of data that is
moved to and from the cache at any one time. 4K is the default setting
which is recommended by Silicon Prairie for most devices. If your device is
very fragmented then they suggest that you try an 8K Line Size. The Line
Size must be changed in powers of 2 i.e. 4K, 8K, 16K, etc. If you double
the Line Size it will, in turn, double the size of the cache. You can maintain
the same size cache by cutting the Number of Lines in half for each
doubling of the Line Size.

If your device is very fragmented, characterized by a slowing of read
speeds, then I would suggest using ReOrg (PD) to defragment your device
rather than trying to make up for it by adjusting the Line Size. You'll
gain much more performance from reorganizing your device than by using HCP
for this purpose.

* Write Retention Time - This parameter determines the length of time that
data will be kept in the cache before being written to the device. The
default setting is 5 minutes (setting is displayed in seconds.) This setting
can be disabled by setting the Write Retention Time to 0. The data in the
cache will be written to the device after the amount of time set in the Quiet
Write Time parameter has passed. The Write Retention Time setting is only
useful when your CPU will have no idle time.

* Quiet Write Time - This parameter controls the amount of time that HCP
will wait, after the CPU goes idle, before any writes are made from the
cache to the device. The default setting is 1 second, but you can add an
extra margin of safety by setting the Quiet Write Time to 0 -- this will
cause any writes to occur as soon as any spare I/O cycles are available.

* Save - Selecting the Save button will cause any changes to HCP's
operation to be permanently saved.

* Use - Selecting the Use button will cause any changes to HCP's
operation to be immediately activated, but these changes will not be
permanently saved.

* Cancel - Selecting the Cancel button will cause any changes to HCP's
operation to be aborted.


HyperCache.guide

This is the Amigaguide hypertext on-line help document for HCP.
This text includes:  Late Breaking News, Parameters, ARexx,
HyperCacheStats, and an Index.

* Late Breaking News - This section contains any last minute information
that was not included in the written manual.

* Parameters - This section covers every aspect of setting the parameters
for HCP.

* ARexx - This section gives information about the supported ARexx
commands (5) for HCP. By using ARexx commands you can control every
aspect of HCP's operation, including statistics on the program's operation.

* HyperCacheStats - This section gives information on the use of the
HyperCacheStats program.

* Index - A complete index to the Amigaguide hypertext document.


HyperCacheStats

This program opens a window on your Workbench which contains several
areas of information pertinent to the device you are caching. The
HyperCacheStats (Stats) program will only give information for the device
which is being cached, if you have more than one device cached then you
must use multiple copies of the Stats program with the appropriate
Tooltype defined in each icon. I used HCP to cache my hard drive, DF0,
and DF1. If I wanted to view the statistics for each of these devices I would
make three copies of the Stats program and use the following Tooltypes:

PORT=HyperCache.IVS_SCSIpro.device (for my hard drive using the
Trumpcard Pro controller)

PORT=HyperCache.trackdisk.device UNIT=0 (for floppy drive DF0:)

PORT=HyperCache.trackdisk.device UNIT=1 (for floppy drive DF1:)

The Stats program only compiles the information while it is activated. There
is no way to save the statistics for future reference. This program is mainly
intended to help determine the appropriate cache size for a certain device
and for purely informative use.

The Stats program consists of two separate areas, Averaged Statistics and
Instantaneous Statistics.

Averaged statistics:  Total Read Hits, Total Read Misses, Total Read
Samples and the same three categories for Writes.

* Total Read hits - This represents the total number of reads from the
cache as opposed to reading the data from the device.

* Total Read Misses - This represents the total number of reads that had to
be made from the device because the needed data was not available from
the cache.

* Total Read Samples - This represents the total number of times the Stats
program has requested information from the cache.

To the right of these lines are the complementary values for Writes. The
above definitions are identical, except that they show statistics for Writes
instead of Reads.

Instantaneous statistics:  Read Hits, Read Misses, Read Hit Ratio and the
same three categories for Writes.

* Read hits - Displays the number of reads from the cache over the past
second.

* Read Misses - Displays the number of reads from the device due to the
needed information being unavailable in the cache over the last second.

* Read Hit Ratio - Displays the total number of reads from the cache
divided by the number of read hits then multiplied by 100. This represents
the percentage of reads that were successful from the cache as opposed to
having to read the data from the device.

Just below these lines are the complementary values for Writes. The above
definitions are identical, except that they show statistics for Writes
instead of Reads. Also, to the right of this area are the averages for these
categories.

The manual states that the running of HyperCacheStats can slightly
hamper the performance of the cache. They do not recommend running the
Stats program during system performance tests i.e. A.I.B.B., SysInfo, etc.
as it may effect the outcome.

ARexx drawer

The ARexx drawer contains five example ARexx scripts that require the
user to modify the code with the appropriate device port. The scripts
included are:  Suspend, Activate, Alternate, Stats, and Flush.

* Suspend - This script will stop HCP from running on the specified device
port.

* Activate - This script will start HCP running on the specified device port.

* Alternate - This script will alternate between starting and stopping HCP's
operation on the specified device port depending on HCP's current status.

* Stats - This script will activate the Stats program for the specified device
port.

* Flush - This script forces HCP to immediately write any information
currently waiting to be written from the cache.

The included scripts are fully documented by the programmers and are a
nice addition to the HCP package.


LIKES:  I liked the easy installation of HCP, except for the missing library
problem, using the standard Commodore installer program. The program
only takes a few minutes to install once you manually copy the included
library, if necessary, to your LIBS directory.

HCP adds a great amount of speed to several aspects of everyday
operations, such as:  reopening windows, reloading programs, rereading
data in a data base or spreadsheet, reopening documents in a word
processor or desktop publishing program, working on pictures or
animations in paint and animation/rendering programs, etc.

The HyperCacheStats program is a nice way of verifying HCP's operation
and determining the appropriate cache size for each device.

The included ARexx scripts are helpful in controlling HCP at this level.

The manual is well written and precise, for the most part.

The Amigaguide on-line help document is a very nice feature.

The GUI is a big improvement over earlier releases of HCP. It makes the
adjustment of HCP's features very easy to do (see dislikes.)


DISLIKES:  HCP's GUI will load under WB 3.1, but it freezes up after that.
The computer is still functional, but the GUI remains on the Workbench and
won't go away unless you reboot. I contacted Silicon Prairie about this and
the representative said that they had done limited testing under WB 3.1. I
used the Tooltypes to adjust the parameters for all my devices' HCP icons.
This wasn't that big of a deal, but it would have been much nicer if the GUI
would have worked under WB 3.1.

The manual could have given some suggestions as to the recommended
size of caches used by certain devices. The old manual (v1.01b) gave
suggested settings for hard drives and floppy drives. I used a 512K cache
for my hard drive and a 100K cache for each of the floppy drives. Through
trial and error you can arrive at a good cache size based on your usage of
the particular device and the information provided by the Stats program.

Prettier icons should have been included for all of the supplied files. The
included icons are rather dull as compared to a MagicWorkbench type
scheme.


SUMMARY:  I highly recommend HyperCache Professional v2.0 to
everyone. If you do a lot of everyday work with directories, databases,
spreadsheets, word processors and the like, then you'll appreciate the
benefits that HCP has to offer.

It's nice to load a program such as DirectoryOpus or DPaint IV and then if
you quit from it and try to reload it a few minutes later the program loads
in a matter of a few seconds, instead of the usual several seconds on my
machine. Also, when working with large databases in SuperBase IV it's
nice to read through the data from beginning to end once from the hard
drive and then have all subsequent reads made from the much faster
cache.

Buy this program!

%%  Full Motion Games and the Amiga                  By: Rowan Crawford %%
%%  An essay of analysis                  dljar1@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


    Full Motion Video (FMV) seems to be the big catch phrase at
the moment, but a lot of people are skeptical about it's worth
in video games.

    Psygnosis certainly feel it's a viable gaming option, and
they (along with several other large companies) have put their
cash behind it. Mircocosm, and it's sequel, Scavenger 4, represent
their first attempts at FMV games, and although both were games
were mildly successful in combining FMV with an actual game,
they were still far from what people expect from interactive
entertainment.

[Scavenger 4 is rumored to have become "Novastorm". -Ed]

    Virgin had a big hit on their hands with 7th Guest, but that
had even less interactivity than the Pygnosis efforts. It was a
success because it looked good, and was something new. Nothing more.
    But it's not just Virgin who have taken advantage of FMV
and the gullible PC games buying public. In fact, these "vaguely"
interactive games are quite common on the PC (even the 3D0 has
had it's unfair share), and there looks to be even more on the
way. Which reminds me of a joke:

Q:  How many PC owners does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
A:  None, they just declare darkness as a new standard.

    So what can we, Amiga users, expect now that FMV is available
on the CD32? And what does it mean for the future of computer
gaming? Will everything eventually become more like a film than
a game, or are there other uses for FMV?

    I think it has huge potential myself. The thing to realise
is that it can't, and therefore won't, suddenly make games any
better, or any more original. What it can do is make exhisting
game styles more interesting, and also it can draw you into the
game itself.

    Then again, someone might actually create a new genre of
-interactive- game using on FMV. It's possible, if unlikey.

    Mircocosm was quite a large step from previous uses of FMV
(even if it wasn't strictly using FMV, the basic result is the
same). Psygnosis realised that FMV wasn't something that you
should base a game on, but instead is something that you can use
to make your game look and feel better.
    Although the shoot-em-up behind Microcosm wasn't the best game
ever, the basic principle was right. With Scavenger 4 (when will
there be a CD32 version!?), they kept the same idea, but worked on
improving the game part to the extent that the craft could now
interact with the background.
    It is design features like this which will allow FMV to be a
bonus to game design rather than a hindrance to gameplay. FMV in
this fashion could work with other game genres too, such as adventure
games and maybe even playform games (with some careful design).

    The other use for FMV is for animations. Not only intro/end
game animations, but for little animations throughout the game.
    Not necessarily just between levels either, access to the CD
is fast enough that it could happen mid-game. For example, you're
running along in a platform game, you put an object in the right
place, and suddenly the whole screen morphs into something different.
    So many possibilities, and yet still they continue to produce so
many interactivity-impaired games. It's just not right.

    I think what FMV is ideal for, is to help draw the player
into the game. A nice scene setting intro animation, occational
"joyride" levels, bonus set-pieces and a few small plot enhancing
animations will all contribute to the feel of the game.

    Something to think about anyway.

With games like Wolfenstein and Doom out for the PC, debate has raged over
the Amiga's capability to pull off such graphics and effects, spawning
loads of texture-mapping demos.  Someone put the "No Amiga Doom" question
directly to ID and got an answer that has made many people unhappy...

From George Sanderson's letter on comp.sys.amiga.misc:


#22901 comp.sys.amiga.misc 4k
From: aissande@kraken.itc.gu.edu.au (George Sanderson)
Subject: Id Software (Doom) responds!
Date: 4 Sep 1994 19:27:31 +1000
Organization: Groom Lake Testing Facility

Yo...  I wrote a plea letter to Id software for them to port Doom to
Amiga and got the usual "can't be done" response.

I would appreciate people out there who have coded anything texture
mapped and/or chunky2planar routines (or even copper screens) to convince
them otherwise...  Their main concern is the speed of the game (they
say the 68040 is just enough) and that the c2p process would totally
kill that anyway.

The porting doesn't seem to be a problem ( 99% of Doom is written in C )
as they recently did a port to the SGI (Silicon Graphics) machine
(the market there isn't that great), and Doom was developed on the
NeXT...  (btw, contrary to popular belief, Doom is still playable on a
40MHz 386 - not exactly a speed demon).

It would be good if your responses were mailed to me - i'd like to mail
as many responses to Id as possible in one hit, but if you decide to
mail Id software directly, be polite and explain your point of view
thoughtfully.  The last thing we need is some Amiga fanatics abusing Id.

Anyway, below is my original letter to Id, and after that is their response.

----

[original letter to Id Software]

Hi.  I would appreciate an answer to this letter from you or someone
who is able to do so...  I noticed that you have recently released a
version of Doom for SGI, meaning that porting isn't a difficult task.
Perhaps a port of Doom for Amiga would also be a good idea ?  I
realize that the Amiga lacks a chunky graphics mode and it is a
relatively limited market compared to IBM clones, but the game market
for Amiga is quite large.  The lack of the chunky graphics mode has
been solved via fast conversion routines (which can be found in
ftp.wustl.edu:/pub/aminet or any other Aminet mirror) or as in the
case for Amiga CD32, the conversion routine is provided in hardware.
There are numerous texture mapping demos available showing that a
Doom-type game is possible on the Amiga.  The market for Doom on Amiga
is also fairly large.  The Amiga CD32, which is basically a games
console with a CD drive built in, together with the SX-1 expansion
unit could provide sufficient memory and speed requirements.  Many
owners of Amiga 1200 have upgraded their systems with high speed
accelerators, bringing their machines performance similar to the
A4000, which has more than enough horse power to handle Doom.  These
machines mentioned are the ones equipped with the AGA chipset, and by
including the old generation, (but still fast) A3000, the market is
large enough for a port of Doom to take place.

If you have any further specific questions, I would be happy to answer
them.

The amiga is not powerfull enough to run DOOM.  It takes the full
speed of a 68040 to play the game properly even if you have a chunky
pixel mode in hardware.  Having to convert to bit planes would kill
it even on the fastest amiga hardware, not to mention the effect it
would have on the majority of the amiga base.

PRODUCT NAME

        Warp Engine 4040


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

        The Warp Engine 4040 is an accelerator, RAM expansion, and SCSI-2
card for the Amiga 4000.


COMPANY INFORMATION

        Name:           MacroSystem Development
        Address:        24282 Lynwood, Suite 201
                        Novi, MI  48374
                        USA

        Phone:          (810) 347-3332
        Fax:            (810) 347-6643


LIST PRICE

        $1695.00 (US).   Street price is about $1450.00.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE

                An Amiga 4000 or A4000T.

                [MODERATOR'S NOTE:  A previous reviewer stated that the
                board works on the A3000T as well.  - Dan]

        SOFTWARE

                AmigaDOS 2.1 or higher.


COPY PROTECTION

        None.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        Amiga 4000 Tower, 2 MB Chip RAM, 16 MB Fast RAM (60ns).
        Workbench 3.1.
        Quantum 1800S 1.8GB SCSI-2 Hard Drive.
        NEC 3xi Internal Triple-Speed CD-ROM (with ASIM CDFS v2)
        Emplant Deluxe with version 4.7 of the emulation software.
        Multiface III I/O card.


INSTALLATION

        [MODERATOR'S NOTE:  If you are not comfortable opening up your
        Amiga, then you should have the work done by an authorized Amiga
        service center.  Opening your Amiga yourself may void your warranty,
        and careless work may even damage the machine.  - Dan]

        Installation of the Warp Engine involves removing the Commodore
supplied 68040 processor card and replacing it with the Warp Engine.  Note
that the Warp Engine does not occupy a Zorro slot.  The 4040 model comes
with its own CPU, so you can sell your old processor card to an Amiga 3000
owner.  A heat sink and fan (one unit) is provided with the 4040 though
there is no mention of it in the documentation.  You must peel off the
sticker and stick it on top of the 68040.  Placing the Warp Engine in the
CPU slot of the 4000 can be tricky.  The plastic standoffs are rigid and I
had a tough time getting them to snap into the holes on the Warp Engine
board.  The documentation states that it might be easier if you place the
standoffs on the 4000's motherboard first and then put the Warp Engine in.
I found, however, that it was easier the other way around.

        If you want to connect your internal hard drive to the Warp Engine,
a cable is provided.  There is no SCSI activity LED connector on the Warp
Engine card, however.  You must connect your computer's hard drive activity
LED directly to the hard drive.  There is also no way to connect external
SCSI devices to the Warp Engine.  The manual states that an external
connector is available from MacroSystems, should you want one.

        Next, there is a series of jumpers that must be configured for your
system.  You must tell the Warp Engine whether or not to AutoBoot off of the
integrated SCSI-2 controller.  The behaviour of the controller must also be
set (you can make it slower or faster depending on your hard drive),
including whether or not to support LUNs.  You must also tell the Warp
Engine what kind of memory you have installed on it.  You must set jumpers
for the size of the biggest SIMM module, and whether or not you have any
double-sided SIMMs installed.  Double-sided 16MB SIMMs take a lot of power
and are not recommended by MacroSystems.

        A disk comes with the Warp Engine that contains various utilities.
There is no Installer script.  Just drag the drawer labeled "Warp Software"
onto your hard drive.


REVIEW

        I can sum up this entire review with one word: AWESOME!!  The 4000
Tower used for this review virtually hovers off the floor!  I am indeed
greatly impressed with this unit.

        The Warp Engine comes in an unassuming, white box with the same kind
of cover as the advertisement in AmigaWorld Magazine.  The box contains the
Warp Engine, a heat sink & fan, plastic standoffs, a thin, spiral-bound book,
and a disk.

        If you have any Fast RAM on the motherboard of your 4000, you can
move it onto the Warp Engine for increased performance.  The Warp Engine
has 4 SIMM slots (which accept industry standard 72-pin SIMMs) that can hold
4, 8, 16, or 32 MB SIMMs in any configuration.  Very flexible.  60ns SIMMs
are recommended to achieve the best performance.

        For all of you who think benchmarks are important, here they are
(courtesy of AIBB v6.1 - compared to stock Amiga 4000/040):

EmuTest 1.88    Writepixel     1.47    Sieve         2.87    Dhrystone  1.61
Sort    1.76    EllipseTest    1.12    Matrix        2.25    IMath      1.61
MemTest 4.61    TGTest         1.15    LineTest      1.02    Savage     1.63
FMath   1.61    FMatrix        2.80    Beachball     1.71    InstTest   2.41
Flops   1.60    TranTest       2.22    FTrace        1.69    CplxTest   1.71

Sysinfo (version 3.23) reports 29.89 MIPS and 7.58 MFlops.

        Most startling in the above benchmarks is the memory speed of the
Warp Engine.  With the 60ns 16MB SIMM module, the Warp Engine's RAM speed is
over 4.5 times faster than a stock 4000!!  Ssssssssmmmmokin'!!

        With a Quantum 1800S 1.8GB SCSI-2 hard drive, SysInfo reports a read
speed of over 3 MB per second.  DiskSpeed 3.1 reports a slightly more
conservative speed of 2.5 MB per second.  While the Quantum 1800S is no
Seagate Barracuda, this is still very fast.

        Real world performance is the only benchmark in my book, however.  I
am running a 16 colour Workbench that feels like a 4 colour Workbench.
Icons and windows just fly onto the screen.  Response from the Amiga is
instantaneous.  Click on the close gadget of a window, and it's gone before
you can blink.  Screens open faster and programs load much quicker.  Boot-up
time was reduced by almost 10 seconds over a stock 4000 with an IDE hard
drive.  I can run the Emplant Macintosh emulator in 256 colours with
absolutely no slowdown.  PageStream 2.2 screen updates are so much faster
with the Warp Engine 4040, it's a dream to use.

        The included software consists of SCSI hard drive partitioning and
formatting software, a modified HDToolBox icon to work with the Warp Engine,
a device driver, a SCSI handler (if do not set the Warp Engine SCSI
controller to autoboot), and a CLI command to map Kickstart into Fast RAM.
The lack of an Installer script is disappointing, but then there's not much
to install.  In fact, the Warp Engine will work fine without any of its
supplied software installed.  The included SCSI drive partitioning software
is not as good as HDToolBox, in my opinion.  It does not tell you how big
your drive is in megabytes, only in blocks.


DOCUMENTATION

        The small manual is clear and concise.  It contains detailed
technical information on how the Warp Engine works, which is great for all
you techno-nuts out there.  The installation instructions are well laid out
in a step-by-step fashion.  The only thing missing was an explanation of the
heat sink.  Although I knew how to install the heat sink and fan unit, I
think MacroSystems should have at least mentioned it.


LIKES

        This board is fast!  MacroSystems did not cut corners at all on this
card.  It has a fast SCSI-2 controller and easy memory expansion.  Its
performance with Emplant is most impressive.  The integration of
accelerator, SCSI-2 controller, and RAM expansion on one card is a definite
plus.  And no precious Zorro slot is taken.


DISLIKES

        The Warp Engine is rather expensive.  Certainly not in everyone's
budget, at $1500 (US) it's a bit steep.  Installation of the 4040 in a 4000
Tower presents a problem, as well.  With the fan on the CPU and/or SIMMs
installed on the board, the drive bracket can no longer be installed.  You
must use a hack-saw to cut out areas for the fan and SIMMs to poke through.
Luckily, it's not that difficult.

        Lastly, the lack of a SCSI activity LED connector on the Warp Engine
is a bit of a let-down.  If you have more that one hard drive, you can only
connect your computer's LED to one of them.  On a board that it so well
designed, this oversight is inexcusable.  The lack of an external SCSI
connector is also a mark against the Warp Engine.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        The only other product that compares to the Warp Engine is GVP's
G-Force 040.  I have never used the G-Force, so I don't know how its speed
compares.  However, the G-Force uses GVP's custom SIMM modules, which are
much more expensive than the industry standard SIMMs the Warp Engine uses.
And the G-Force does not come standard with a SCSI-2 controller - it's an
option.


BUGS

        None found.


VENDOR SUPPORT

        I've had no reason to call MacroSystems, so I have no idea how well
they support their products.  I did call their support BBS, however, and the
technicians appear to answer all questions.


WARRANTY

        Because the unit is not mine (I am a dealer configuring this for a
client), I was interested in the warranty of the Warp Engine.  So I started
to read the legalese on the first page.  About 3/4 of the way through the
disclaimer, there is a sentence that says, "If you have read all of this,
your brain, herein, will be turned into mush."  I heartily agree with that
sentence as I can never figure out what exactly the warranty covers.  As it
turns out, the last page of the manual states that the Warp Engine is
warranted against manufacturing defects for 2 years.


CONCLUSIONS

        If you can afford it, buy this card.  If you can't afford it, sell
your grandmother.  You will not regret it.

My reason for playing games is specifically to find out what happens once
it's completed. The satisfaction gained after finally beating a game is
often lost when all you see is, "Well Done".

    Unfortunately, it's an all too common sight in a lot of Amiga games,
but there are exceptions. Yes, there are games around which give you
the type of gratification you want after completing a game, but the
problem is that that there is no way of telling which games these are.
    Until now anyway. Here is a compilation of all the endings posted
to UseNet (c.s.a.games) recently, so finally you can see which games
are actually worth playing.

    If you know the endings to *any* other games not on this list,
or can give better discriptions of what is here, please mail them
to me at: dljar1@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au . I'll include them in the
next list (if I receive enough). Even just "I think I liked it" will
suffice. Now to the list...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Alien Breed:    You are picked up by a huge space ship (which is drawn
                really well), then there's there's a heap of explosions.
                Short, but rather nice.
Another World:  The absolute final animation is short, but the whole
                ending, including the final level, is excellent. Ends
                with your character flying off on a dragon.
Armourgeddon:   Great outro animation (not confirmed).
Awesome:        Great outro animation (not confirmed).
Black Crypt:    Good ending.
Cannon Fodder:  Digitised picture of the SensiSoft team, and the original
                music played again. Lame!
Cruise For A Corpse:
                Excellent film-like ending sequence.
Chaos Strikes Back:
                "You Win" text plus cheesy animation.
Deluxe Galaga:  You get a picture plus some text stating that you've
                repelled the alien invasion. Then the text goes red,
                and you're informed that they are attacking again. Yep,
                back to level one except harder.
Deuteros:       "You Win" text.
DisposableHero: Strange. You get an animation which starts with your craft
                landing. There's people all around cheering. Then the pilot
                jumps out, runs to a sports car and drives off. Then one of
                the people watching gets out a missile launcher and proceeds
                to blow up the car.
Dungeon Master: "You Win" text.
EOB I:          It shows a 5 minute animated outro. It shows the party
                walking into the city hall and dropping off the eye of the
                beholder in front of the council. The council are initially
                angry when you disturb them, but are joyful once they hear
                about their story. The text says "Thus Begins A legend",
                which then fades out.
EOB II:         Good ending.
First Samurai:  TEXT! Thats it ("You have completed.. etc").
Flood:          After all his adventures, the little critter finally
                excapes the sewer, jumps up out of the manhole and is
                immediately flattened by a truck. Absolutely hilarious.
Hired Guns:     It's nothing impressive, but it actually has something to do
                with the story in the manual, for once!
Killing Game Show:
                Great outro animation (not confirmed).
Leisure Suit Larry II:
                MEGA LONG ending sequence.
Lemmings:       DMA digitised cheering and clapping after a screen of text.
Lionheart:      A BRILLIANT animated sequence with some superb gfx/sound.
                Parallax backgrounds to the max. Actually has "two" endings -
                you get the extended version if you track down the amulet.
Lotus I:        Just text, just a line, just a word!
Lotus II:       "Well Done" type message plus pictures of the programmers.
Microcosm:      Having finished Microcosm, I was ABSOLUTELY AMAZED by the
                end-sequence (bigger and better than the intro in some
                cases!!). But after the strange "endro", if you leave it
                running through the credits, a strange event occurs:
                Suddenly you are seeing a looped animation of a very
                roughly rendered SPACE-SCENE!! Is this a preview of
                "Scavenger 4"?????
Millenium 2.2:  Just "GAME OVER" text!!! You aren't even told that
                you won the game. It just says:
                Game:100%       Score:xxx       Bla:blabla
Might&MagicIII: Good ending.
MonkeyIsland2:  I woke up, and it was all a dream (perhaps leading into
                Monkey Island 3). Still pretty lame though.
Myth:           Stone Henge in vector format spins around, ending in the
                center looking at the main character kneeling down in
                front of you. Then there's a huge explosion. Very short,
                but very very VERY atmospheric.
OverDrive:      Not worth the (limited) effort.
Personal Nightmare:
                Disappointing ending compared to that great adventure.
RainbowIslands: Completed without collecting the seven gems: the players
                run towards a huge pile of gems, but the gem pile falls
                down, and the music goes sad. Then you''re told that you
                haven't really finished the game.
                Completed with the 7 gems: the players are being tossed into
                the air by Rainbow Island inhabitants, under a big rainbow.
Rodland:        Lame ending.
Shadow Of The Beast I/II/III:
                Text & modified title picture & no new music.
Shanghai:       Apparently a very shocking/startling ending.
Silkworm:       "You Win" text.
Starglider II:  Almost NOTHING happens!
StarTrek 25th:  You go through the firefight at the end, and you just get
                the logo and the theme.
StarWoids:      Hah haa, you'll have to pay the ShareWare fee to find out :).
SuperCars I/II: Just text, just a line, just a word!
Superfrog:      A funny Eric Swartz anim, but it wasn't really as good
                as the intro anim.
Super Space Invaders:
                Neat little animation of mothership plowing into a Burger
                World, alien out of hatch, goes "ooOOOOOhhhh!", and passes
                out. Cute.
Supremacy:      Nice sequences for each opponent.
Syndicate:      "The End" - thats it!
Turrican II:    A short, but good, animation showing Turrican flying out
                of a huge complex towards (and past) the camera. Then the
                complex explodes. Finally it has scrolling text credits
                over the picture. Very good all up.
Ultima 5:       Good ending (?).
Ultima 6:       Lame ending.
Xenon II:       Another joke ending. When you finally beat the last bad guy,
                the screen goes blank except for a dot in the center of the
                screen (accompanied by a high pitch whine). A few seconds
                later, the screen fills with interference. It's supposed
                to look like you turned off the computer.

        AmigaOS:  Is it worth it?
        -------------------------

  Many  people  say that AmigaOS has fallen way behind, and that it would
require  to  much time and work to get it up to speed with other "modern"
OS's.  I think they're wrong and here's why.

  Commodore  computers have historicly done well as home computers.  They
are  inexpensive  and  powerful.   Therefore, the OS can lack some of the
high  end  features  --  in exchange for being a small, efficient OS that
runs well on a home computer.

  Other competing OS's have their share of faults as well.


        The "competition"
        -----------------


Well lets look at Ms-Windows, shall we?

  It  still does not have pre-emptive multitasking, though version 4.0 is
supposed to have it (but it's not out yet).

  It does not have memory protection.

  It  still  uses  that  rediculous  MS-DOS format for their drives, even
though  it lets you use names greater than 8 characters it must cram them
into the old format.  Quite a hack.

  It is slow and memory hungry.

How about the Mac's system 7.whatever?

  It  also  still  does  not have pre-emptive multitasking, and who knows
when it will get it.  A massive rewrite will be required to add it.

  It also does not have MP.

  It's also slow and memory hungry.

Of  course I'm being very brief here, but I'm just illustrating that they
lack some important features too.

How about AmigaOS itself?

  We have pre-emptive multitasking.

  We  also  don't  have  MP.  While it would be nice to have, it would be
very  hard  to  add.   Probably  as hard as it will be to add pre-emptive
multitasking to System 7.

  We're very small and very fast.

  We don't have virtual memory standard, but can add it.

  We don't have RTG or DIG standard, but can add it.

OK so we have some problems.  But I don't think they are insurmountable.


        AmigaOS's market
        ----------------


Consider the market for the Amiga.  It consists of:

  Home computer users.

  Game players.

  Specialty   applications:    Kiosks,   "set  top"  devices,  and  other
applications requireing an inexpensive multimedia delivery platform.

  Developers for all of the above.

  Video and multimedia.

  AmigaOS  as  it is right now is plenty sufficient for most of the above
applications.   It's  perfect in fact, because it is small and efficient.
I  hear Scala is trying to port their wares to the PC, and in order to do
so they are writting an AmigaOS-like custom OS for the PC.  Gee, what was
that  about  their  OS's  being better than ours?  Not for everything, it
seems.

  For  the  rest,  there  are many things that can and should be added to
AmigaOS.  So here goes.


        What to do with AmigaOS
        -----------------------

Several virtual memory programs have already been developed.  Simply pick
the best one, and integrate it into AmigaOS.  VM problem solved.

Look  into the many RTG systems in use by graphics cards.  If these small
companies can do it, the new Commodore should have no problem doing it as
a  standard part of AmigaOS.  Possibly parts of a current system could be
adopted.

Make  the  "post.library"  a  standard system library.  Make a Postscript
font  engine.  Make a Postscript printer driver than can print Postscript
to ANY printer (pass through for those that know PS).

Get  all the datatypes drivers that have been written.  Clean them up and
include  them.   Write  an  MPEG  datatype that can use the MPEG hardware
(CD32,  Zorro  card)  or  software.  How about some datatypes for all the
music   formats?   Some  more  text  Datatypes  would  be  awesome  (RTF,
Wordperfect,  etc).   And  a  Postscript Datatype.  And get developers to
support them.

Implement  something  like,  or get the rights to, Hotlinks.  How about a
Hotlinks  Datatype?  Would this not give us the equivalent to DDE and OLE
in Windows?

Create and publish more standards.  We could use some more standarization
of ARexx commands.  For instance, there could be a standard basic command
set  for  a  wordprocessor,  or  a terminal program, etc.  We need a good
standard for animation with sound/music.  People need to support DR2D (or
we  need  to create a better standard if necessary), and a formatted text
standard, through the clipboard.

We  need  more  robustness  in  the  GUI.   We  need  a standard for font
sensitive,  inteligent  GUI's.  Something both FAST and small and easy to
use  (which  effectively  eliminates  every  third  party solution I have
seen).

How  about getting in on the ANSI standards commitee that is hamering out
a  standard  for REXX?  After all, REXX on the Amiga is probably the most
popular  (or at least 2'nd behind OS/2) version in wide use.  Get William
Hawes   to   do   a   new  release  of  ARexx.   Put  in  those  proposed
object-oriented  extensions  I  read  about  in  the  REXX magazine (yup,
there's a REXX mag, it seems to only recognize the OS/2 REXX though).

Rewrite workbench, please.

Envoy should be part of the OS as standard.

I'm  sure  you  can think of a dozen things to add as well.  With all the
talent  out there, I think we could add a ton of features to AmigaOS very
quickly to get us up to speed.

-----

  The question is, is it too late for the Amiga?  Is there any life left?
Can  the  Amiga  be  saved  even by a company that knows what it's doing?
Ever  the  optomist,  I  think  it  can  be  saved.  I still think AAA is
something special, even though it has been delayed significantly.

So, how to do it.  I'm sure everyone has their own ideas about "the plan"
to save the Amiga.  I do too.  And here it is.


Step one:

  Restart  production  of  the A1200, A4000, A4000T and CD32 immediately.
Deliver  them  in  abundance  to  everyone.   I  hear there is a Canadian
company  that wouldn't mind buying 200,000 CD32's if Commodore could make
them.   Think of what that will do for the price of the CD32?  (for those
who  don't  understand  mass  marketing, it would reduce the price of the
CD32).

  Ensure dealers, suppliers and end-users that the Amiga is not dead, and
that  they are being manufactured to meet demand.  Let everyone know that
this isn't the old Commodore anymore, and that the new Amiga is not going
to just play around anymore.

  Help  developers make the decision whether or not to leave the Amiga --
give them every incentive to STAY.  Actively "court" new developers.

Slash  prices.

Ship all machines with 3.1, of course.

  Amiga model                   Competitor-target

  CD32  - $250-$300             Sega CD (haha), Jaguar, CD-I (HA!), 3DO.

  A1200 - $250-$300             Low end clones?

  A4000/030     - $800          \
  A4000/LC040   - $1000          - Clones, Mac Quadras.
  A4000/040     - $1200         /
  A4000T/040    - $1500         Quadra tower?

Restart development of AAA and next generation Amiga, DSP card, etc.

Begin advertising CD32 in game mags and during children's prime time TV.

Advertise Amiga's as multimedia computers.


Step two:

(time frame: late 1994)

  Push  the price of the CD32 as low as possible.  Get CD32 displays into
stores,  to show off the games and the MPEG video (fight the CD-I head to
head  I  say!) Be sure to supply good quantities for X-Mas!  CD32 may not
be as powerfull as the 3DO, but it's half the price and has more games.

Get those A1200 and A4000 CD32 upgrade cards out!

  Get  software developers to support 3.1 features (because of course, by
now,  tons  of  people  should  have the cheap 3.1 upgrade kits, right?).
Write  an  MPEG  datatype that uses the CD32 MPEG card if you have it.  I
want  to see multimedia software running in a window on my workbench with
real  smooth video in it!  I want to be able to cut and paste any kind of
data from any application to any other!

  Bundle!   Pick  a  good  gfx  card and bundle it with "hi-end" A4000's.
Pick  a  good  040  accelerator  (and  060 when available) and bundle it.
Bundle  GigaMem.  Bundle Ethernet cards and Envoy.  There's lots of third
party  stuff  that  is  good,  why  not support them (just stay away from
GVP!).

  The  bundling  could be handled by distributors; cooperate with them by
unbundling Amiga's (sell them motherboards and other parts, separate from
each  other  so  they can put together custom systems cheaply).  I'm sure
CEI and Creative Computers as well as individual dealers would love this.

  Amiga model                   Competitor-target

  A4500/040-40  - $2000         Quadra 650, 800.
    (40Mhz 040, gfx card)
  A4500T/040-40 - $2300         Quadra 950
  A4500/060     - $2500         PowerMac 7100
    (66Mhz 060)

More  advertising:   multimedia!  Imagine for example the following print
ad:

  "Multimedia does not live by CD-ROM and cute speakers alone.."

  Many people would have you believe that you can do Multimedia by simply
  adding  a  CD-ROM and a sound card.  Well, Multimedia is much more than
  that.   Multimedia means fast animation, great sound, video, hypertext,
  and  interactivity.  In order to do all these things, you need a system
  designed from the ground up for Multimedia.

  The Amiga is simply the best Multimedia platform.  From the inexpensive
  CD32  unit (perfect for Kiosks and consumer use), which costs thousands
  less  than  other solutions, to the Amiga 4000, the Amiga can't be beat
  for  the  price.   With  the  Amiga line, you can reach anybody in your
  target market.

  Not  only is it a great delivery platform, it's also a great Multimedia
  development  system.   With  advanced,  award winning products like the
  Video Toaster (3D animation, video processing, and more) you can create
  spectacular Multimedia presentations.

--

You get the idea.

Hopefully, X-Mas '94 will be profitable, with very little investment.

Step three:

(time frame:  early '95)

Work closely with Amiga developers to produce products for the Amiga.

Crank  out  as many CD32's, A1200's and A4000's as will sell (worldwide).
Get CD32 into toy and department stores, and A1200+CD32 expansion bundles
into the higher-profile places.

Release the DSP card (Zorro III).

Release  a  revised A4000:  better memory system, supports more than 16MB
RAM,  SCSI-II,  DSP  in  "DSP  slot".   Compact case, full size and tower
versions,  replace  all  previous  A4000's.   "The A4000 that should have
been".  "Multimedia workstation".

Release revised A1200:  fast RAM SIMM socket, math co socket, clock built
in,  Akiko  (CD32  chip),  28Mhz EC030.  $350-$400.  Add CD-ROM for $150.
Might  as  well  do  a  CD32  with the same processor..  "multimedia on a
shoestring", "Advanced gaming pleasure!".

  Amiga model                   Competitor-target

  CD32          - $200
  CD32-II       - $300          3DO, Jaguar-CD

  A1400         - $400          Low end clones?
  A1400CD       - $550          3DO?  Jaguar-CD?  :)

  A4200C        - $1000         Quadra 605/650
    (33Mhz 040. DSP optional)
  A4200/040-33  - $1200         Quadra 660AV
    (DSP)
  A4200T/040-40 - $1500         Quadra 840AV
    (DSP)

Step four:

(time frame: mid 95)

Aggressively   market   the  Amiga:   Multimedia  and  Games.   A4000  is
multimedia,  CD32 is games, A1200 is the cross-over machine.  Keep prices
low!   Get  people  to  use  Amigas.   Get people to sell them.  Get more
developers.

Aggressively develop AAA and new Amiga:  Pheonix 5000.

Aggressively develop AmigaOS 4.0 (see my other article about AmigaOS)

Make some profit?

Step five:

(time frame: late 95, BUT BEFORE XMAS!)

Rollout  Amiga  Phoenix  5000 series.  Work with NewTek to simultaneously
release an AAA based Video Toaster/Flyer(!!).  "Toaster 5000"?

* AAA chipset (see my previous article about AAA)

  Briefly:

  1280  x  1024  max  viewable  display (non interlaced; at least 8 bits,
    maybe 16 max).
  Very fast blitter, can do mathematical operations (image processing?)
  32/64 bit DRAM or VRAM depending on configuration.
  upto 16MB chip ram.
  Planar (1-16) or chunky (2,4,8) pixels, 24 bit modes, compressed mode.
  8 channels of 16 bit audio.

  Now  I've  heard  people  whine  that  "1280  x  1024 sucks, it MUST do
better!".   Well, have you checked out the prices of 21" or larger colour
monitors?   They  ain't  cheap.   If you can afford one of those, you can
afford  to  get a fancy (expensive) graphics card that can do better than
1280 x 1024 if you really need it.  The standard graphics aren't going to
be able to cover ALL cases of what people need.
  The  Amigas'  niche  is  video,  for better or worse, and AAA is plenty
sufficient  for  video  in  the conceivable future (it shouldn't have any
problem even with HDTV resolutions -- something that other graphics cards
WILL have a problem with).

* DSP (possible multiple units)

* 40Mhz 040, 50/66Mhz 060 (with 64 bit localbus)

* SCSI-II

*  PCI  only  on  "low  end"  systems, with additional Zorro III slots on
mid-high end (ZIII slots would be faster than A4000's).

*  No CPU slot -- CPU uses PCI slot.  In theory, you could have more than
one CPU card.

*  Aggregate  system bandwidth of 400-600MB/sec (compared to around 35-48
for an AGA machine).

*  AmigaOS  3.5  (will  probably  be  preliminary,  a  bit buggy, and not
available  for  older  Amiga's  till  4.0  in  '96).  Software to use DSP
(VCOS).  Networking, Multimedia extensions (Envoy, CD32 software).

  Amiga model                   Competitor-target

  A5000-060     - $?            PowerMac 8100 (or whatever comes next)
    (8MB fast, 2MB chip)

Continue  with aggressive multimedia marketing, with the same theme (that
CD-ROM  isn't  all you need for multimedia!).  The P5000 should be pushed
as simply the ultimate multimedia computer.

--

OK,  so  maybe  this is overly optimistic.  It may take a bit longer than
what  I outlined above.  But I still think the Amiga has a chance.  We're
just farther behind than we should be.  It still might be a bright future
ahead.

-----

[To preserve Mr. Caley's opinions and feelings, I have left this article
largely untouched.  However, it is worth reminding that no purchase of
Commodore has been completed and that the architecture possibilities of
future machines vary, depending on who you talk to.  AAA may not be
a viable future option-instead, another chipset may take its place. -Ed]

%% AmItalia: An assesment of the scene in Italy    By: Gabriele Peterle %%
%%                                                ray@maya.dei.unipd.it %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is a little report about how _I_ see the Amiga's situation in Italy.
I have no official sources or data, so these can be considered only my
personal opinions, closes or far the reality.

I am an italian boy, 23 years old and studing informatic engineering at the
Padova university.
I have owned an Amiga 500 since 1988.
It was expanded with 68030/882 33MHz accelerating board, 1 Mb chip ram,
2 Mb 32 bit fast ram, second floppy drive and KS 2.04 .
This kind of system is not always enough to run today's software (in parti-
cular with an hard disk the life would be easier) but it still allows me to
have a lot of fun.

As it was released, I've considered to buy a 4000/040, but it was not full
satisfying; the problems with the memory access, IDE, AGA only half step
enhancement over ECS (still 8 bit sound and no full 24 bit graphic) and last
the rumors around the AAA chipset, with its fabulous specs and performance,
make me (and I mean many others) wait.

Now is nearly 2 years I'm waiting!  :(

My opinion is that, if/when a new generation of Amiga will be released, we
will see here a strong demand, expecially for the high end models (surely I
will buy a 060 or RISC / AAA / SCSI 2 system).

The demand of high end Amigas can be explained this way:

Everybody know, Italy is a country of artists. In this particular case of
computer artists; a couple of these are Antonio Di Lorenzo and Eva Cortese.
Maybe they are'nt well know out of Italy (an animation by Eva Cortese called
"Bye bye blue" was on Aminet or Funet a year ago, but I can't found it now)
but here they have followers like Allen Hastings in USA.
All the italian Amiga magazines have more than half of the pages dedicated to
reviews, hints, tutorials, news about this argument.
Every year in Riccione (town near Rimini, famous for its beach), during the
Easter's holidays (end March-begin of April), there is an almost important
international festival of computer art called Bit.Movie, which has thousands
of visitors and hundreds artists (note that 90% of the works made with personal
computers are developed on Amiga !!).
So, what I need for computer graphic ? The italians answer:
    "An Amiga faster, bigger, more!"


Finally a overview at the general computer world in Italy.
The average italian computer user buys "MC microcomputer", a magazine with
80% PC, 10% Mac, 7% Amiga and 3% others coverage (I think that in reality the
percentages are 70%, 7%, 20 % and 3% respectively).
Also note that even here half of the (few) Amiga's pages are about computer
graphic.
The sad reality is that this magazine makes disinformation about the Amiga and
consequentially the italians don't know this (awesome and better :) platform
(and Commodore Italy do nothing of course ).
As example, in an article of a 6 months ago issue, about the upcoming CD-ROM
and films-on-CD market, was made the names of CD-i (ok,but less than 1000 sold
in Italy), 3DO (ok, but less than _10_ in Italy, all imported from USA) and
finally (CD32 you say? NO!!!!) **Jaguar** (what??!!?? no CD-ROM, no MPEG, less
than _5_ in Italy coming from USA !!).

They did not mention the CD32 which uses CD-ROM, supports MPEG and is largely
available !!

Now I'm hoping in the resurrection of the Amiga to shut up those people !

Until that time the soul of Amiga will survive in me (and in all us, I mean).
(How a mystic phrase ! Maybe tomorrow I will create a new religion ! :)

If you have questions or comments (or you want to join my new religion :), send
me e-mail (or write an article for AR!).

Ciao.

%% Review: Perihelion by Psygnosis               By: @{" Jason Compton " link P8-1}    %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Perihelion rounds out the pack of games I while back from Psygnosis for
review.  It took me a while to get to it...mainly because the intro had me
worried that the RPG would disappoint me.

Why?  Well, simply put, because the intro to Perihelion is the best game
intro I've ever seen, save Microcosm.  It's not so much the graphics
(which are good for ECS: excellent use of shading) that make it so great.
The sound is superb, and the text is incredibly atmospheric.  Even the
"Switch disk" request has a chilling pounding and banging to it.  The
start of the intro suggests the monitor and room condition you should
have, and I strongly recommend you listen to them.  You won't be sorry.

Perihelion, the game, is a very complex idea.  To sum up, a powerful,
extremely "negative" (evil!) godlike creature is pouring entropy onto
a planet.  Literally, everything is breaking down in disorder...including
genes.  But, luckily for civilization, 6 entropy-resistant beings were
created for such an eventuality.  You control these six, and off to
battle you go.  (Don't bother wondering how one resists entropy: you just
do.)

The control of this RPG is very modular.  The "base" screen is where you
grab character information from...race, physical statistics and abilities,
and the like.  From there, you may go to specific inventory screens,
combat screens, computer terminals, area maps or localized, 3-d maps.

The system is reasonable enough...although the fact that the use of many
computer functions (like reading mail and getting directories in many
places) cost money is a bit irritating.  Smacks of true life, though.

Generally, the layout is great.  Not immediately intuitive, but great.
All of the screens are drawn beautifully...even if they are always
rather orange, they look highly detailed.

You use the area map to get where you want to be: this involves a
scrolling relief map of a large section of your surroundings.  Your
party is represented by a ball that rolls to specific points based
on which direction you tell them to go...at points of interest, you
stop and are given a description.  The concept is neat, and simplifies
long travel for the impatient.  Once you reach a point of interest like
a town, you may choose to enter, in which case you go to a 3-d view,
much like in the Bard's Tale series or comparable.

Big mistake.  This is where the game gets ugly, which is really too bad
because things were going so well...the window in which your view is
displayed is rather large, and as such the resolution of what you see is
rather poor.  And orange.  Very, very orange.  The variance of terrain
is pitiful...I was literally becoming dizzy watching the sameness fly
by me.  Occasionally, you encounter a person.  Then, you must use your
computer terminal interface to talk with them, using a rather lousy parser
and long waits for the effects to go off.

On top of this, the manual is horrible.  The layout is bad, with words
trailing off and starting on different margins, and there are a number
of details in the game simply not explained.  Like, for instance, the vast
majority of physical characteristics.  The functional and game-related
difference between a Knight and a Mercenary.  The functional and game-
related advantage and disadvantage to using a human-feline cross-breed.
Things like this that are so vital to understanding your purpose.

Considering the richness of the intro and the obvious effort put into
crafting an alien world, Perihelion could have had real marketing
potential.  Perihelion books, a movie...it really would have worked.
Unfortunately, the game doesn't play well enough when it counts to make
pursuing it intensely worthwhile.  If you're a patient mapper, you may
very well enjoy Perihelion.  But if you're easily bored by a street
full of prefabricated houses or apartment buildings, you'd better steer
clear.

While the Emplant natives got some sort of appeasance by finally getting
Emplant Mac 4.7, a large amount of them continue to be restless about the
refusal of the PC emulation to surface.  In the meantime, color shots of
BIOS screens continue to be advertised in the back inside cover of Amiga

I spoke recently with Richard Mataka of GMR Productions, US distributor of
Vortex Golden Gate boards.  He had two main messages:

1.  Sigma Design's WinStorm card is becoming increasingly difficult to
find.  He still has some, but since Sigma no longer makes it, the life
is limited.  (The WinStorm is the single IDE card with SCSI, VGA, and
16-bit sound+joystick port for bridgeboard-type emulators like the
Golden Gate.)

2.  While supplies last, he will sell double-speed internal SCSI CD-ROM
drives to Amiga Report readers for US$175.  Just ask for him and mention
this article to get more details.  (Note: Amiga Report is in no way
involved with this offer.  In fact, I didn't even ask, he just told me
he wanted to do it.)

I also spoke with a company interested in assisting the Amiga emulation
market.  For customers interested in more than one item, this company will
seek out ANY IBM or Mac product (hardware), locate the lowest cost
available to them, and sell it to the end user at a 15% flat markup.

The company wishes to remain nameless at this time, but I was asked to
collect responses.  If you've got an opinion, let me know.

News about EMC (the company which bought up a bunch of Commodore 2386
emulator boards and began selling some as upgraded 486/33s a while back)
has been hitting Usenet...apparently, an order upwards of $1000 has not
been acted upon in quite some time.  The customer tried contacting EMC
by phone.  He first got disconnection messages, then heard an answering
machine message from David Cinege (apparently in charge of, or
essentially totally, EMC) saying that he had been in a car accident and
was unable to work for some time, but would be taking care of orders
soon.

Mr. Cinege personally told this customer the same thing by E-mail.

I have mailed Cinege, but have not received a response.  If the situation
changes, I'll report it.

I just got back from my second day in West Chester for the auction.
I'm exhausted.

I talked to Alex Amor and Dave D. from CEI, Ed Goff (attorney and
former(?) board member of Commodore), and other people who know what is
going on.  Some (limited) discussion of the liquidation occured, and I
didn't find out anything new or suprising.  I still suspect it is not
going to happen within the next two weeks, and I wouldn't be suprised to
see it stretched out.

The furniture went for outrageous prices, but then, it does new, too.
Some of the nastiest most useless cubicles sold for hundreds of dollars
(for a one or two workstation setup).  The nicest cubes sold for thousands
of dollars per few workstations.

The test equipment went for outrageous prices.  Several of us (former
engineers) sat together.  The chip guys were laughing hilariously at some
things which sold for more than they would pay for new.

Some piles of Amiga stuff which would have required a semi to move, but
which were probably 10% good stuff, sold for a few thousand.  These piles
cost more to move than to buy, or they would have been good deals.  Among
some of that stuff were an A3000+, several pilot-production build A4000s
(with A3400 black faceplates), some A3000Ts, lots of A2000s, etc.

I didn't end up buying any Amiga stuff.

I suspect an easy $500,000 was raised.  There were many lots which went
for more than $25,000 (like test equipment) and there were 588 lots.  It
seems like the median was probably about $500.

Lew is a pretty reasonable guy.  He started off on the wrong foot, but he
was willing to learn and, given the constraints of the environment, he did
a pretty good job.  You've got to remember, though, that the real job of a
VP of engineering is more managerial than technical, and should be more a
matter of vision than of specification.

Entirely independent of the above, though, anyone speculating on Lew's
involvement in the future of the Amiga is probably overestimating it, for
reasons I can't go into.

The following is the text of a fax sent to various folks by Electronic
Design (would someone like to enlighten me and tell me who Electronic
Design is?).  The emphasis is with the Euro market as the personalities
involved with this fax are European.

This fax summarizes a meeting which took place on Sept 5, 1994, one day
before David Pleasance gave his interview to John and Janet Bickerstaff
(the article based upon that interview was posted in the message base
yesterday).

--start Fax transcript--

Don't worry, be happy ...

Summary of meeting with Commodore UK, David Peasance and John Smith,
London 05-09-1994.

First of all: still no official decision on the new owner of Commodore.
However, no need to give up, since the following reasons for the
lengthening process of the Commodore purchase are clear and therefore
give hope.


The Situation
-------------
As already indicated a few weeks ago, Commodore UK has submitted a plan to
the liquidator of how to finance Commodore and to run the business.  This
draft plan was combined with a purchasing offer valid 10 working days
only.

Commodore UK is the only bidder for the 'unconditional' purchase 'of
the whole of Commodore', which comprises the right to manufacture, sell
and market all present Commodore products and those in development. It
also includes the purchase of the assets of Commodore Canada and Commodore
UK.


The Problem
-----------
The plan submitted to the liquidator was based on the condition that all
stock in the Philippines would be available immediately after the purchase
of Commodore which would have meant quick availability of the Amiga again.

However, due to open bills for rent and other things, the Phillipine
government and other creditors have closed the whole building and watch
it with guards so the stock cannot be touched.


The Changes
-----------
Due to this unexpected problem, the whole plan had to be reworked. The new
plan was presented to the investors' lawyers on Monday, 050994 who
promised to approve the plan and immediately pass it on to the liquidator
in the US the same day. This new plan is again combined with an
'unconditional' bid valid for 10 working days, i.e. until 20th September.
A decision will be made - definitive.

Other bids like e.g. from Samsung only refer to certain parts of Commodore
like chipset, etc. for their own purposes.  This means that in case
Commodore UK will not be the new owner of Commodore, the Amiga will not
survive in it's present form and market position.

According to David Pleasance's -and our- opinion, the chances of Commodore
UK being the new owner are at 99.9%.

As soon as a decision in Commodore UK's favor has been made production in
Scotland will immediately be started, and as David's plans, from November,
A4000s, A1200s and CD32s, Full-Motion-Video will be available again. Just
for A1200s and CD32s there might be slight shortages before Christmas.


What plans does Commodore UK have ?
-----------------------------------
First of all: David Pleasance has a very good knowledge of the market,
a realistic view of the position of the Amiga in the market and has
both his feet tight on the ground.

In the first time Commodore UK will primarily focus on maintaining and
increasing the British market.  However David is also well aware of the
importance of the European and Australian markets.

Since for the next 12 months no subsidiaries are planned in the different
countries, David will appoint one or more distributors in each country,
making sure that no dumping prices, price wars or grey imports will be
possible.

David Pleasance will concentrate on establishing a dealer network of
competent, reliable and independant dealers.  The name for this system is
'ACE' - Amiga Center of Excellence.  In tight cooperation with hard and
software manufacturers, David plans to realize advertising and marketing
campaigns, to establish franchise dealers to build a tight and functioning
dealer network.


How about the future?
---------------------
Most important: There will be a future.

The R&D team in Norristown does still exist and will be increased 3-4
times after the takeover to take up again the further development of
existing and future products.

The contact to the developers will be intensified, as well as the
cooperation with other manufacturers like Scala, Newtek, HP, Samsung etc.
by giving out sublicences, for example. David wants to be close to the
market basis to only produce what the market needs and wants.

Developer Conferences (DevCons) are planned to take place in the UK in
London and Software Developers will be on a hotline in the UK to give
support to all developers.

All this means that the Amiga Market will live once Commodore UK has
got the final decision!

/********************************************************************
Oxxi Takes Center Stage with VideoStage Pro
By Douglas J. Nakakihara

    Oxxi has released a powerful new multimedia authoring program
called VideoStage Pro.  It's impressive text animation capabilities
also make it an amazing video titling tool when used with a
genlock.  There is built-in control for ECS chipset genlocks, GVP's
G-Lock, and Digital Creations' SuperGen.

The Storyboard

    The main screen holds the "Storyboard" that displays thumbnail
representations of 15 "slides." A scrollbar lets you scan through
longer "shows." A small icon indicates the transition used for each
slide, with timing information also shown.  Timing can be set in
increments of one video field (1/60 of a second for NTSC).
Transitions can be selected from a user-definable tray or a
requestor is available to select from the full assortment of over
60 wipes, fades, and scrolls.  Each slide also has a user-definable
name and two separate shows can be in memory simultaneously.

    The slide creation buttons are arranged vertically on the right
side of the screen.  You can drag one onto the Storyboard to
replace an existing slide or insert it into the show, or just click
and release to add it to the end.  Slides can be quickly moved or
copied using the mouse.  The "gallery" provides a handy temporary
parking place for one or more slides.

    One type of slide is a blank black slide and another is a color
bar image for color adjustment use.  A slide can also represent an
ARexx script or an audio event (8SVX samples and tracker mod files
are supported).

The Graphic Slide

    The graphic slide is the one you'll use most often.  Graphic
slides are comprised of two parts: the background and things placed
on the background.  VSP comes with several background images
designed to provide non-distracting backdrops for text.
Alternatively, a small IFF brush pattern can be loaded and
automatically tiled to fill the screen.  A number of pre-made
patterns are supplied and you can create your own with any paint
program.  ProFills by JEK is a good commercial source for more
patterns.

    VSP can also generate customizable gradient backgrounds.  These
are not only beautiful, but they also require virtually no storage
space, which could be important if you will be distributing the
show on floppy disk.

    Animations (ANIM5 format only) are also loaded into graphic
slides.  Total control over speed, looping, and time is featured.
(Note: VSP expects anims to be looping.)

Color Palettes

    Before we get into what you can place on a background, we need
to talk about color palettes.  VSP divides color palettes into
"fixed" and "assignable" ranges.  Fixed colors are adjustable by
the user for text and object coloring, including outline and
shadows.  Assignable colors are dynamically allocated by the
program and used for backgrounds, gradients, brushes, antialiasing,
etc.  Generally, VSP automatically sets up half the palette as
fixed, up to 32 fixed colors, but this can be set manually.  The
depth (which determines the number of colors), as well as the
screen mode and resolution, for each slide is adjustable.

    There are two ways to load a graphic: as a "picture" or a
"pattern." (You'll see later that the term "pattern" is somewhat of
a misnomer.) When you load a graphic as a picture, the slide
assumes the graphic's screenmode, resolution, and depth, and the
entire palette becomes fixed.  This is OK unless you are going to
add titling because normally, a graphic's color palette won't
contain the contrasting colors needed to make text stand out.  So
you'll have to do some color palette manipulations beforehand.
Plus VSP won't have any assignable colors for antialiasing, etc.
(There is an exception if the loaded graphic uses fewer than the
maximum possible bitplanes--8 for AGA, 4 for non-AGA.  In this
case, one bitplane is added and you may or may not end up with
assignable colors.)

    Well, of course, there is an easier way to maintain assignable
colors.  The trick is to load as a "pattern," a background picture
whose number of colors is less than the number of assignable
colors.  For example, with a 16-color slide (eight fixed and eight
assignable), you can load a four-color background.  Loading an
eight-color background would cause all 16 colors to become fixed.
The pattern tiling feature is irrelevant if the loaded background
has the same resolution (i.e., height and width) as the slide.

    The built-in palette editor features 24-bit RGB sliders,
spread, copy, and switch functions, with the ability to load and
save palette files.  Palette colors can optionally be selected from
a 24-bit color spectrum--even on non-AGA Amigas!  (Actual displayed
colors will be limited by hardware, however.)

    Scala backgrounds, which are 16-color HiRes files, can be
easily reduced to eight-colors using ADPro or DPaint, since the
images only actually use at most eight colors.  These work well if
you manually set the fixed color bitplanes to 2 (i.e., four
colors).  Incidentally, outstanding backgrounds can be made using
as little as four colors!

Adding Text

    For titling, VSP can use any Amiga bitmapped or CG font,
including color fonts.  Large fonts work best for presentations and
several are included with the program.  Adding text to a slide is
as easy as typing it on a page.  Text can use gradient fills and be
styled with bold, italic, underline, outline, and drop and cast
shadows.  Each line can be automatically justified and multi-level
antialiasing is available.  Also, outline width, line spacing,
kerning, and shadow attributes are all adjustable.

    An ASCII file can be imported with the ability to control
fonts, etc.  using special embedded commands.  This is great for
scrolling credits.

Brushes

    You can also add IFF brushes to a slide.  If a color used in a
brush doesn't already exist in the assignable palette, VSP will
attempt to load that color into an unused assignable spot.  Excess
colors will use the closest available color in the palette.  Also,
a library of 20 brushes can be set up for quick access to
frequently used brushes.  Warning: If a brush uses a fixed color
and you change that color, VSP may select a different fixed color
later on.

Objects

    VSP also features nine different objects like hearts, stars,
boxes, ellipses, and arrows that can be added to a slide.  These
can be rotated, re-sized, and distorted at will.  Multi-level
antialiasing minimizes jaggies.  Attribute control is similar to
text, but objects can also be embossed, and color and shadows have
a transparency setting.

    Interactive buttons can be easily placed on a screen.  A button
can be a rectangle, brush, and/or text.  Buttons can trigger ARexx
scripts, sound, and transfer control to another slide.

    Text, brushes, and objects can be positioned by hand or using
several automated tools.  The ordering of these items can also be
set, which can affect the sequence of their appearance.

Actors

    Lines of text, brushes, and objects can be animated onto a page
as "actors." You can also group things together so they are treated
as a single actor.  All of the common "fly in" effects are
included, but VSP features some interesting "overshoot" effects,
where actors move past the intended stop point and then return as
if they were connected to a rubberband.  This really gives actors a
life of their own and you'll have to try real hard not to overuse
this in your work.

    Another unique feature is the "piecemeal" option.  This makes a
text-actor fly in one letter at a time.  Normally, this would make
the effect take too long, so you also have the ability to overlap
the animated pieces.  This can be adjusted anywhere from one piece
at a time to the entire actor at once.  Using the piecemeal option
with an overshoot effect is very cool!  An alternative to piecemeal
is the grid option.  Actors are internally divided into a
user-defined grid of rows and columns.  Actors then fly in as
pieces.  Piecemeal and grid pieces can optionally appear to grow as
they fly in!

    After you preview a slide with actors, a replay screen appears
that lets you review the animation with total control.  You can
step through it frame by frame, replay it, etc.  You then can
return to the actor screen and adjust effects, timing, delays, etc.
This is an incredible help in getting a slide to play exactly
right.

Titling

    A titling slide is essentially a graphic slide with a solid
background using color 0.  This is designed to hold text and
objects that will be overlaid on top of video using a genlock.

    Titling can also scroll over the preceding slide, if both
slides have the same depth.  They should also use the same screen
mode, although they don't have to have the same resolution.  An
additional constraint is that the total depth of both slides cannot
exceed the maximum for your Amiga.  So an AGA machine can have two
four-bitplane slides and a non-AGA is limited to two two-bitplane
slides.  (I was unable to get this to work on my A3000, but it
worked fine on my A4000.  Oxxi has been alerted to the problem.)

Flow Control

    Generally slides are executed in linear fashion; however, there
are playback control icons that provide a way to direct the flow of
a show.  Also, there is a handy feature that lets you set the
timing of slides by clicking the mouse as you play a show.  This is
great for syncing a show to music.

Time Line

    A time line is also available to graphically adjust time
parameters for slides and rearrange the play order.  Since
different types of slides may run in parallel (e.g., graphics and
music), there are separate tracks for each type.  For precise
editing, zooming capabilities are provided.  Most of the editing
functions available on the Storyboard can be used here.  Overhead
time requirements are also shown for file loading time, object
movement preparation, etc.

Helpful Hand

    VSP includes many helpful features, like context-sensitive
on-line help.  The animated transitions examples are invaluable.
The custom file requestor displays useful information on graphics
and audio files and has the ability to preview them.  VSP will also
let you know when colors are being used that are too "hot" for
video.

    To create portable presentations, the show file and all
subordinate files, including fonts, can be saved in one location
like on a floppy disk.

How Does It Stack Up

    For anyone that does Amiga presentations, the first question in
your mind is probably how does VSP compare to Scala MM300.  Well
overall I'd say Scala is a much more refined product and has a more
powerful ARexx implementation, cleaner page transitions when
pushing hardware limitations, the ability to play anims from disk,
support for more anim formats, a more straight-forward interface,
more built-in control of external devices, and text wipe-off
effects--to name just a few advantages.  Of course, a lot of VSP's
features, described above, don't exist in Scala either.

    However, Scala is hampered by a joystick-port dongle, which
even the player utility program requires.  If you're developing a
presentation on one machine to be played on another, the dongle can
quickly become a real pain.  VSP on the other hand, has no copy
protection and the player program is freely distributable.  VSP is
also less than half the price of Scala.

What's Missing

    There are a few things I'd like to see in VSP, like automatic
text wrapping, actor wipe-offs, and animbrush support.  Another
shortcoming is you can't automatically backup through a show using
the mouse, without creating specific hot buttons.  This is a vital
feature for live presentations.

    I'd also like to see text, brushes, and objects treated as one
thing.  I want to be able to add an outline and shadow to a brush,
like can be done with text; I'd like the ability to make text
shadows partially transparent, like objects can have; etc.  etc.
I'm sure things like this will be addressed in future releases.

    Kudos to programmer Gary Bonham on a superb initial release.
Oxxi has a real winner on its hands.  The power-to-price ratio is
extraordinary.  A hard disk, 1MB Chip and 2MB of Fast RAM, and
AmigaDOS 2.0 or greater is required.  Look for an upcoming version
called VSP+, which will include remote updating and scheduling
capabilities (ala Scala InfoChannel, $2,500), encapsulated
Postscript support, and more.

PRODUCT NAME

        CD32 S-Port


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

        Connects the CD32 to a 25 pin serial port via the keyboard port.

LIST PRICE

        I paid #24.68 wich comes out to be about $38 US.  I guess it
depends on the exchange rate.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE

               Probably should have a CD32 on one end.  On the other end of
               the cable, you need the standard 25 pin RS-232 port.
               Technicaly, that means you could hook it up to an clone I
               guess, but you would need software for it.

        SOFTWARE

                It comes with every thing you need to get the two computers
                talking to each other.


COPY PROTECTION

                The software that is supplied is public domain.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

                A1200
                MBX 1200
                  4 Megs
                  882 Math-Co
                IDE Hard Drive


INSTALLATION

        Installing the S-Port is very simple.  It only requires you to
connect the cable into the keyboard port on the CD32 (there is a pass
through) on one end, and plug the other end into the serial port.


REVIEW

        What I wanted, was a way of using all of those Aminet, clip art,
etc... types of CD-ROMs.  I didn't need to add memory, another drive, math
co-processors, or anything like that.  I just wanted a way to get data off
of a CD and into my hard drive.  The S-Port does this.

        When you receive the package, you get three things.  The first is a
simple cable that hooks the two computers together.  The cable has two
key board connectors on one end and an RS-232 on the other.  One keyboard
connector plugs into the CD32 while the other acts as a pass through so
that you can still connect a key board.  Since I don't have a keyboard for
it, I don't know how well it works.  I am curious to know what happens if
you type while the two machines are connected.

        The other two parts to the package are the CD and disk.  The CD
will get the CD32 booted in workbench (Kickstart 40.60/Workbench 39.29 on
my machine).  It also has the feature where you can insert another CD
without it re-booting.  This will allow you to use the Fish disks and stuff
like that.  The floppy disk is for the Non-CD Amiga.  It has all of the
software needed to get the connection made between the two as well an
installer script for hard drive installation.

        Actually getting the two machines talking is very simple.  Since I
have a hard drive, I installed the program, and ran it from the there.
The program they give you is S/DNet.  To run it you simply click on its
icon on the "computer" side.  Once running, you select START DNET from the
menu.  Then, you must run SNET-START on the CD.  At this point I should
mention that I know of no way to do this WITHOUT a mouse connected to the
CD32.  Since I have several mice, it was no problem for me.  Anyway...

        Both computers whirled and clicked for a second and then indicated
that they were both talking to each other (Actualy, it didn't happen that
easy.  I had a problem with my preference setting not being set to 19.2K
baud.  Once fixed, it worked well).  You can use any number of ways of
getting data across.  But there is one large hassle that I will explain
later.  I also tried running programs from my A1200 that existed on the CD.
Although it took a little while to transfer over, it did work.


DOCUMENTATION

        There is not much to the paper documentation.  It is about the size
of a large greeting card.  However, I don't know that it needs to have
more in it.  They explain what each of the three parts are, and how to get
started.

        Also, on the disks are all the documentation for the S/DNET
programs.  However, this is only supplied by Marpet, it was written by The
Software Distillery.

LIKES

        It is inexpensive, and allows me to transfer/run files off of
CD-ROM.  Because it is nothing extreamly complicated, I believe that it
will be very reliable.  I should also mention that the cable is very well
made and looks sturdy.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

        I guess I wish that it could transfer files faster.  If they could
come up with a cable that connected to the expansion port on the CD32 and
the Amiga's parallel port, I would buy it.  Of course, I would want the
price to be about the same.

COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        The only other product that I have heard of is the Communicator II.
I have not seen it work, but it sounds very interesting.  It's only down
fall was that I was paying big bucks on long distance calls to England, and
bought the first product that the guy new of.  Unfortunately, he hadn't
heard of the Communicator.


BUGS

        For some reason, when I run SNET off of the hard drive, intuition
will not keep track of where it is in the path.  For example...

I type into a shell:

        SNET:CDPD <return>

My prompt comes back with the appropriat:

        SNET:CDPD>

Now, if I ask for a directory (using "dir", "list", "NewList") it tells me
that it can't find any information on  .  Note the spaces before the
period.  For some reason, it is not getting the proper information.  But,
if I type:

        dir SNET:CDPD

Then I get the appropriat response.  The same holds true for commands such
as "copy", but not exicutables.  For example, if I want to copy a file from
the CD to the A1200, I must give the complete path name, regardless of what
my current directory is.  But, if I want to execute that file (assuming it
can be), then all I have to do is type in it's name, and it works.  This
has me puzzled.

I have tried playing some of the mods that are supplied on the CD using my
own program (not the one on the CD), and use MFR to sellect the files.
This seems to work just fine.

All of that said, I should point out that this is not a problem with the
cable made by Marpet.  It is a problem with S/DNET:  So, if you get another
CD with a better program that uses the serial port, it should work.  Also,
I should mention that when I boot with Marpet's disk, the problem goes
away.  This suggests to me that maybe there is a compatability problem with
versions of my operating system.  I don't know, but it does NOT keep me
from using the set up.


VENDOR SUPPORT

        Because they are across the pond, I have not attempted to ask
them about the "bug".  They do provide a product registration card and a
full address, phone number, and fax number.


WARRANTY

        There is a two year warranty.

CONCLUSIONS

        This is what I wanted.  I can get all of the PD files, demos,
etc... and it didn't cost an arm and a leg.  I just wish that I could have
bought it in the US.  Not that I had any problems with the mailorder company
that sold it to me.  In fact, they were extremely helpful.  But, I had to
spend major bucks on shipping and phone calls.  But hey... I am still glad I
got it.

    - THE PRIZE FOR NEXT MONTH -

CONTEST BEGINS: 9-13-94
CONTEST ENDS: 10-13-94

The Amiga Report contest is still going on, and it is not too
late to enter. This ongoing monthly contest allows Amiga Report
readers a chance to win software by either solving a puzzle or by
entering a random drawing.

The prize this month is the Amiga/Toaster Reference Manual v2.221,
from Area52. This is a 1,000 page help system for the Amiga and Video
Toaster, covering the Workbench, AmigaDOS, Lightwave, and more ($34.95).

The second prize choice is the FutureShock audio CDROM,  which was
produced using Amiga computers by SideWinder. There are some Sidewinder
music modules on Aminet that you may want to look at for a sample of
the audio CD ($12.95).

Another possible prize is SubVersion, a strategy submarine hunt
game by Point of View Computing. Both a Mac and IBM version is included
along with the Amiga version.

FOCUS GbR has made available graphicRECALL, its interactive multimedia
database. Designed for catagorizing and accessing large databases of
images, texture maps, anims, and audio.

Walnut Creek has also dontated 5 copies of the AMINET CD-ROM, which
contains approximately 4000 files from the AMINET FTP sites.

Previously we have offered the ARexx Reference Disk by Merrill
Callaway, which was awarded to a previous winner. Contact Whitestone
for more information (505) 268-0678. More prizes will be announced
as they become available.

All monthly contests end on the dates listed above. Any entries beyond
this date will be entered into the next contest. In the event that you
were announced as a winner and did not receive your prize, please contact
me by email.


- THE MONTHLY DRAWING -

To enter the random drawing, select a number from 1 to 262,144
and send it to me at one of my addresses listed below, either by
the postal service or email through the Internet.
Also, you may enter by solving the following puzzle. The winner
of this puzzle will be decided within the same time frame as the
random prize, to allow the contest information to filter through the
networks, and to allow your letters and postcards to come in.


- THE PUZZLE -

Two cars are racing on a race track. Each car is traveling in an
opposite direction (they aren't too bright). The cars eventually
collide with each other. One suffers damage to the windshield as
it gets hit. The other driver flies out the side openning on his
car because the netting was damaged.

The first car, a Formula 1 racer, has its windshield replaced. The
second car has its netting replaced. What kind of car is the second
car, and why?


- TO ENTER -

To enter, simply let your fingers do the talking and write an
email and send it to dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu. You MUST put
the word CONTEST in the subject line of the email header! Otherwise
you run the risk of having your email deleted (don't ask, it is a
long story!) or send a post card or letter to:

Amiga Report Contest
c/o David Tiberio
6 Lodge Lane
East Setauket, NY 11733

Is it possible to win via snail mail? You might think that your
chances of winning are better by entering in email (much faster of
course), but last month's winner send in a letter that arrived the
day before his winning number was drawn!

In your letter or email, please provide the following:

Your full name and address. Please keep in mind that many of
you may have addresses that I am not accustomed to, so please include
your country or any other information that I would need in case you
win. An email address should also be included, if possible.

You must also include a brief one sentence overview of the editorial
in this issue of AMiga Report. Just to make sure you are reading it. :)
You must also include the issue number. For example, if you read this in
AR213, then include that in your correspondance. Also, a prize winner
will be determined by a random number generator. Choose a number from
1 to 262,144. The closest winner or winners to the randomly generated
number will receive the prize in the mail. Anyone who does not provide
a number will have one assigned to him randomly.

All prizes will be mailed within one week after I get my hands on
the published version of AmigaReport. I am doing this for a few reasons.
First, every winner so far has given the correct puzzle solution before
I have received the editon of AmigaReport that announced it. :)
Second, I don't like to go to the post office every day if I can avoid
it. Third, you never know when someone's power supply might blow up
(right Mr. Editor?!).


- RULES AND REGULATIONS -

1. In the evnt that the editor's power supply fries, the contest for
   that month will have its deadline postponed to a later date, to be
   announced. Any contest entries for the random drawing will be added
   to the next month's drawing, to be held once per month near the
   beginning of the month.

2. All prizes are donated. I cannot be held responsible for any damage
   caused by a prize. For example, if you leave your prize on the
   stairs and your grandmother slips on it, I will not pay her medical
   bills.

3. We are not doing this for any profit, and cannot be held responsible
   if we go out of business or are otherwise financially unable to give
   you anything! We are actively looking for submissions from other
   software authors.

4. Good things come to those who read the rules and regulations! Here
   is a tip to help you win: every problem is a trick problem, or gives
   you clues that are not part of the problem itself. Read the whole
   entire contest entry looking for clues. And read my other articles
   for more clues. I give some very obvious clues :).

5. If for any circumstance you are awarded a prize but do not receive
   it, contact me at (516) 476-1615. I will promptly attend to any
   mistakes that have been made.

6. These rules are subject to change at any time without warning!

7. The company that publishes Art Department skipped the key information.

THIS MONTH'S WINNERS:

    Tim Berry, nimbus@shell.portal.com,

    and Pat Larkin, of Louisville, Kentucky!

Recently my email account was suspended for my yearly renewal, which is
required every year at the end of August. I have had one winner who also
changed mailing address, so if there are any other persons who were
announced winners publically or privately please contact me with your new
address (there are 2 of you!).


THE PUZZLE:

There are two matrices, A and B. Each matrix will have a
value applied to it, and you must determine the answer. The
value is specified by x, and the answers you must provide are
Ax = ?, and Bx = ?.

x = (151647 - 61615)

    [ 7 8 9 ]       [ 1 2 3 ]
A = [ 4 5 6 ]   B = [ 4 5 6 ]
    [ 1 2 3 ]       [ 7 8 9 ]
    [ 0 0 0 ]       [ 0 0 0 ]

What does Ax equal, and what does Bx get you? Also provide
your method of obtaining the answer. I understand that there
may be cultural differences for this problem... not all math is
the same (you should see how my mother does long division!). So
just make a good guess ::heh heh::. With a little research, you
can determine the answers. You may want to look for information
on matrix multiplication.
As a special bonus, the first person to successfully supply the
correct answer will automatically win. If you feel that you
definitely have the answer, get in touch with me with what you have
learned. If you do everything correctly, I will answer to let
you know :).

As an additional clue, the x value has a special code in it that has
to do with area.


THE WRONG ANSWERS:

Anything that assigned A, B, or x to a numerical value is considered
a wrong answer.


THE WINNING ANSWER:

Pat Larkin of Lousiville Kentucky was the first to answer the
problem correctly in the manner described.


THE BREAKDOWN:

There are two matrices, A and B. Each matrix will have a
value applied to it, and you must determine the answer. The
value is specified by x, and the answers you must provide are
Ax = ?, and Bx = ?.

x = (151647 - 61615)

    Notice the value of x... it is not meant to be performed as an
operation. In fact, the two numbers are part of a hidden code. If you
take those two numbers and write them a little differently, such as:

    1516 - 4761615, or 1516 - 476 - 1615, or 1 - 516 - 476 - 1615,
you might figure out exactly what it was. :) The number is in fact a
phone number, and mine at that!

    [ 7 8 9 ]       [ 1 2 3 ]
A = [ 4 5 6 ]   B = [ 4 5 6 ]
    [ 1 2 3 ]       [ 7 8 9 ]
    [ 0 0 0 ]       [ 0 0 0 ]

    Matrix A is the layout of a calculator or the numeric keypad on
a keyboard. Matrix B is the layout of a telephone keypad.

What does Ax equal, and what does Bx get you? Also provide

    Ax gets you some numeric operation, while Bx gets you *ME*, since
it was my phone number provided.

your method of obtaining the answer. I understand that there
may be cultural differences for this problem... not all math is
the same (you should see how my mother does long division!). So

    Actually I wanted to say that not all phone service is the same,
and that is the cultural difference I really meant.

just make a good guess ::heh heh::. With a little research, you
can determine the answers. You may want to look for information
on matrix multiplication.

As a special bonus, the first person to successfully supply the
correct answer will automatically win. If you feel that you

    After the last issue that the puzzle was posted in, I received
a phone call from a member of CompuServe with the correct answer.

definitely have the answer, get in touch with me with what you have
learned. If you do everything correctly, I will answer to let
you know :).

    When he called, he got in touch with me, and I answered the phone. :)

As an additional clue, the x value has a special code in it that has
to do with area.

    The x value contained my area code.


    If you read my PhonePak review, you would have seen this paragraph:

The number of extensions is almost limitless. Each one has its own
extension number and parent mail box. You could also design extension
based upon employee names. I like to use my area code (516) as an
extension because it helps people remember it when they call. Also,

    Here I gave the number 516 so that people would see my area code,
although my phone number is also listed elsewhere in Amiga Report.

I could program it to use the initials of our employees or their first
names. For example, using the initials of Bob xanth, a person would
hit 29 on the phone keypad. Most words are hard to spell out using
numbers, but it can be done. I have too many 0's in my office phone
number, so I can't make up a sensible word. My grandmother though
has a good one; her number (different area code though) spells out
NAB-FOOD, which is what I usually do when I visit her. :) But of
course she doesn't have a clue on how computers and codes work
(apparantly like most of our contest readers... heh). :)

    And the last line was a hint mentioning our monthly contest,
which was discussing at this particular time about using the PhonePak's
dial extensions, and tricks using phone keypads. :)

    In my review of graphicRECALL, I made the following statements:

Maybe I can convince him to donate a copy for the Amiga Report
contest, and give one of our readers a chance to win another unique
package, but I won't know for sure until I pick up the phone and call him.
I'll clue you in on what happens, in one way or another. :)

    And there is the clue, picking up the phone and calling.

    From my review of the EGS Spectrum board, I allude to the calculator
keypad:

EGS also includes some tools, such as a nice screenblanker and a calculator
program that draws algebraic functions in 3D. I just had to mention it for
those of you who are into sine waves, matrices, etc. Eh? :)

THE APOLOGY:

Sorry that they were so hard, and that a few issues of AmigaReport did
not make it out due to computer and network failures (phone company)!
But the phone company will be able to make up for it in the current
contest. :)

As Edward Cayce might say, that is all for the present...

TITLE:
    DoAllData

VERSION:
    1.01

AUTHOR:
    Sven Dickert (s_dickert@ira.uka.de)

DESCRIPTION:
    DoAllData (short DAD) will give you comfortable handling with all sort
    of data. It establishes an AppIcon on the Workbench. Any icon that you
    will put in (drag-and-drop) will force the start of the viewing-,
    playing-, unpackingprogram or any other application that can process
    the icon's data type.
    With version 1.01 you can define a logfile that you may use as
    standalone-skript. DAD runs executables without suffixes.

FUTURE:
    none, if noone pays the sharewarefee.

    * comfortable way to set the icon's position on WB
    * DAD will work with magicnumbers instead of suffixes,
      so DAD will cover more datatypes.
    * launching skriptfiles
    * own editor for the tooltypes, so DAD will run with 2.04
      in a better way

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
    * at least Kick & WB 2.04, it works best with 3.0 up cause
      there it runs with locale and WBInfo().

              The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-
service online SIG (Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users.

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in various ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA area banks of high-speed modems (you pay for the
phone call if it's not local), or though any SprintNet indial anywhere
in the USA, (with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet
"telnet" program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell account.  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help and you can easily
customize it for your terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

  2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga
   Stuff online, we've lost count!

  The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
  online.  ALL 1000 disks!

  Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command.

  Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, Elastic
   Reality (ASDG), Soft-Logik, Apex Publishing, and others.

  38 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 10,000 files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

  No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

  Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   We've given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more
   than any other online service.

  Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

  Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, EGS,
   Picasso, OpalVision & others feed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with
   them.

  FREE unlimited Internet Email with 5 meg of free storage.

  A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.

  Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.

  Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more. ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.
   You never worry "Ooops.. Am I paying for this area?" again!

  The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.

  Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of
   Internet features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.
   And you get FREE unlimited usage of all of them.

  Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

  Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low
   price.

To join Portal or for more information call:

   or 1-408-973-9111.
