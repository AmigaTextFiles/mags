Break the barrier
-----------------

It's no mystic anymore, the SCSI version of iomegas ZIP-Drive is running fine
with Amiga computers equiped with a SCSI-hostadapter. But a new aspect for a
ZIP-Drive is the feature to exchange Data on PC-formatted medias. What
advantages brings it for you?

Now you can swap a large amount of data (like mods, pics, 3d-objects etc.)
without carrying a large container of floppy disks or moving your baby to the
next PC.

How does it works?

Quite simple. You habe to create a working mountfile using Cross-Dos. This
mountfile is listed below and the only thing you have to do, is to fix it for
your hostadapter. Okay here comes the file:

----- 8< ------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* Mountfile for MS-DOS formatted ZIP-Media
 *
 * Creation-Date: 21-Nov-95 22:52:21
 */

/* Device driver parameters.*/
  Device = <name of your device-driver>
  Unit   = <5 or 6 - changeable via switch on the backside of the drive>
  Flags  = 0x00000000

/* Disk size parameters.*/
  Surfaces       = 1
  BlocksPerTrack = 1
  Lowcyl         = 0
  Highcyl        = 196607
  BufMemType     = 0
  Blocksize      = 512

/* File system parameters.*/
  Mask        = 0x7FFFFFFC
  Maxtransfer = 0x0001FE00
  Reserved    = 6
  Filesystem  = L:CrossDOSFileSystem
  Stacksize   = 2000
  Priority    = 5
  Bootpri     = -20
  Globvec     = -1
  Buffers     = 128
  Dostype     = 0x4d534800
  Mount       = 1
#

----------------------------------------------------------------------- >8 -----

A copy of this file can be found in the ZIP-directory included with this report.
The only thing you have to do, is to drag the "PCZIP"-icon and put it into the
"storage/dosdrivers" directory of your boot-partition. Now load your favourite
editor and perform the fixes I'm discribing now. First move the cursor into the
line starting with "device =". Exchange the following text with the name of your
hostadapters device-driver name. It you don't know exactly the name, please
check it out in the hostadapters manual. For example a A2091-user has to change
the line in "device = scsi.device".

The second step is to choose the right unit-number. Please move the cursor one
line down starting with "unit =". You can find the unit-switch on the back-side
of the drive. If the switch is pointing to number five for example, you have to
put in the following line "unit = 5". Now save the mountfile. That's all.

After mounting the file, you can put in a PC-formatted media und handle it like
any other device.
