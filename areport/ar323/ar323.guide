What a year, eh?  Where are we after all 365 days of 1995, which will be
remembered by us as the Great Buyout but will sadly probably not receive
the same treatment in the next Microsoft Encarta CD?

12 months ago I was hoping that someone would buy the Amiga before it was
too late.  6 months ago, I was hoping Amiga Technologies would build some
machines before it was too late.  Now, I'm hoping Amiga Tech gets some
serious R&D done before it's too late.

It's been nothing but deadlines and time pressure, it seems, and the worst
part is there hasn't even been anything I can do about it.

But hey, we've made it this far with less to go on.  The Amiga isn't quite
out of the pit of obscurity in North America, but showings in Europe have
been strong.  Amiga Technologies didn't miss Christmas, but the 4000T sure
seems slow to surface, as do A1200s in Australia, North America, and let's
face it, any country other than one in Europe.

So, taking stock--yeah, things certainly could have been better.  We could
be waiting for the millionth Amiga Tech machine, rather than the 100,000th.
We could be placing down-payments on PowerPC machines rather than waiting
another year for their unveiling.  But it could be a hell of a lot worse,
too.

It's been a tough year, keeping up with the dizzying months leading up to
the auction, then anxiously awaiting the plans of Amiga Technologies, who
we still hope will lead us to new heights for the platform.  It's also been
a tiring year, for users, developers, and Amiga Tech staffers alike.  Right
now, I'm paying for it with a big headache that's keeping me from finishing
the big stack of reviews here.  Sorry, but the likes of Aminet 9, Meeting
Pearls III, TurboCalc 3.5 vs. Final Calc, Distant Suns 5.0 vs. Digital
Universe, and a slew of miscellaneous software and hardware reviews are
going to have to wait for year 4.

As the Amiga heads into its second decade, it's certainly doing a lot
better than most computer platforms its age.  At the same time, Amiga
Report heads into its fourth year of publication, a lot better off than the
number of print magazines which have sadly folded over the past few years.

How can you celebrate something like that?  Well, the obvious but somewhat
unexciting thing to do is say "Happy 4, AR" and re-dedicate ourselves to
putting together one of the world's most read online publications.  We're
kicking around a lot of ideas for new features and possibilities for the
magazine, some of which will show up as soon as the rather
intimidating-sounding AR 4.01 surfaces next month.

A lot of legends have been written in the past 20 months since the collapse
of Commodore.  And at this rate, many more are to come.

Just a brief message of thanks for your tireless effort throughout the year.
You have certainly encouraged me to remain with the Amiga despite the
uncertainly within the community.

I would also like to commend you and your staff for the very high quality
of news that you have presented.  It remains one of my most valuable sources
of information about what is happening in the U.S. and Europe, and living
in Australia, that is very needed.

That's about all, but please, keep AR going - it is fantastic...

Since most of us consider Amiga Report to be a reliable and quite
outstanding source of Amiga related information, I have a question for the
staff:

 What has happend to Alex "Mr. CEI" Amor?

After the ESCOM purchase of CBM, rumors said CEI would develop Amiga
clones, CEI engineers would cooperate with AT developers and a zillion
other cool things that would take the Amiga into the next century.  Right
now, the R & D boys at AT seem to do fine on their own (With eg.  the
PowerAmiga in mind) but I'm just curious what Alex is up to now?  What is
the current status of CEI?

Uhm, guess that's it for now.  Oh yeah - I would like to take the
opportunity to wish everyone a merry christmas and a happy new '96 -
especially Jason for doing an excellent job with Amiga Report, the Aminet
staff (which we all owe big time) and the AT executives for believing in
the Amiga.  Thanks guys!

Take care kids -- Peter Eriksson, Sweden

--    Funny you should ask.  When SMG was selected as North American
      distributor, Alex specifically told me he wouldn't be buying any
      machines from them.  However, CEI recently surfaced on the SMG Dealer
      List and Alex now tells me they will, indeed, buy Amiga product
      through SMG and sell it both directly and through their dealer
      network.  --Jason

                        The Amiga Internet Terminal
  Tim M. Fries                                   fries@injersey.com
===========================================================================

Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, IBM's Lou Gerstner, and folks from Sun
Microsystems have all been making speeches about the future of computing. 
Their collective vision: $500 "Internet terminals" replacing today's PCs. 
They each share a network-centric view of the future, noting the explosive
growth of the internet in business and home use.  The vision is focused on
networking with a deemphasis on storage and computing muscle at the user
end.  Software applications will be dealt from remote servers, rather than
local harddrives.  User operating systems will be graphically rich, yet
small and efficient.  They each conclude that the building block to
tomorrow's computing model will be an inexpensive and easy to use Internet
delivery platform. 

Earlier this month, Ellison detailed the hardware requirements for his $500
Internet appliance: an inexpensive ($50) microprocessor, 4MB of RAM, video
output to TV and RGB monitor, printer port, multimedia capabilities, PCMCIA
for modem option, network interface, and flash memory or low-cost hard disk
storage option.  He decribes the OS as needing to be small and efficient,
while graphical and easy to use.  Oracle, while still hunting for an OS for
the device, has been in talks with Apple Computer over licensing the Newton
OS.  No agreements have yet been reached.  IBM and Sun have been less
forthcoming in detailing their own Internet terminal specifications, but
both have suggested being in the planning stage. 

Reviewing Ellison's requirements, it is clear to me that the internet
terminal already exists.  It is the Amiga 1200.  The A1200's proven
hardware design and mature, robust OS make it the ideal candidate.  
Ironically, as the industry heavy-weights preach the need for such a
machine, Amiga Technologies (AT) president, Petro Tyschtschenko, sees no
market for the A1200 in the United States.  AT should realize the advantage
of the A1200 as an internet tool and quickly release it with an internet
software bundle to the US.  This package should be marketed towards
business and home users alike. 

AT needs to reestablish the Amiga brand name in the US computer
marketplace.  Being the first with an internet terminal would certainly put
them back in the game.  If they lack the resources to do it alone, they
need to foster business partnerships to make it happen.  In today's
climate, finding a business partner to help launch the Amiga Internet
Terminal should be easy.  They need look no further than Oracle, IBM, and
Sun. 

I would appreciate any feedback.

TITLE

Macro68, version 3.175

UPDATE NOTICE

Apparently, lots of people have moved without informing The Puzzle Factory
-- when update notices were mailed out recently, many of them were returned
by the post office.  Users of Macro68 who have not received an update
notice and who want to get the updated version should get in touch with The
Puzzle Factory at the address below.

  USA                      Internet: jlavin@efn.org

NEW FEATURES

  68060 support added.  Many bugs fixed, most of them minor.

DESCRIPTION

Macro68 is an assembler that supports the entire Motorola family including
the MC68060, MC68882/030/040 FPU, and MC68851/030/040 MMU.  Additional
capability includes the Amiga Copper.

The new Motorola syntax for 030 or later CPUs is supported, and Macro68
includes a utility to convert old-style syntax painlessly.  Old syntax is
also supported.

A unique feature of Macro68 is the use of a shared library, which is always
resident, and allows the use of preassembled resident include files for
incredibly fast assemblies.  These may be standard Amiga files, or any
header files may be used.  Additionally, a configuration file may be
defined that will set up a particular environment, or insert specific code
in all assemblies.

Most features limited only by available memory.  Directives include
Structure Offset for compatibility with the Amiga's interface conventions,
and Frame Offset for easy stack frames.  Full listing control and
cross-referencing.  Ability to customize directives and run-time messages.

Macro68 is fully re-entrant, and may be made resident.  An AREXX(tm)
interface provides "real-time" communication with the editor of your
choice.  A number of directives enable Macro68 to communicate with
AmigaDos(tm).  External programs may be invoked on either pass, and the
results interpreted.

Macro68 is compatible with the directives used by most popular assemblers.
Output file formats include executable object, linkable object, binary
image, pre-assembled symbol tables, and Motorola S records.

REVIEWS

There's a review of Macro68 v 3.165 on Aminet, for example:

INTRODUCING A.N.G.L.E. (Amiga Net Games for Light Entertainment)

A.N.G.L.E. is a brand new, non-profit team comprised by a bunch of Amiga
devotees that don't expect to make money out of this venture. 

Our focus is more on providing games for an area that has not been explored
very well on the Amiga and our intention is to provide the first few
efforts as a "gift" to game players.

A.N.G.L.E.'s MAIN GOAL

Produce multi-player games to be played over the Internet rather than
across a serial link.  To proceed at a reasonable pace, we need more
programmers, gfx artists, muscians and designers -- any takers? 

A.N.G.L.E.'s RELATED GOALS

Help other individuals and teams writing their own TCP/IP based software,
whether games or "serious" applications.

Help end-users struggling with AmiTCP/IP, SLIP/CSLIP/PPP and the likes to
get on-line *properly* with the minimum of fuss.

A.N.G.L.E.'s WEB SITE

Detailed info, including a little questionnaire to help us shaping up our
first game, are available at:

http://www.iper.net/angle

...and before you ask, it's actually "iper", not "hyper"! :)

A.N.G.L.E.'s EMAIL CONTACT

Plain e-mail works as well:

ANGLE-admin@karunko.nervous.com

Thank you for your time and patience!

Sincerely,

Werther 'Mircko' Pirani

                  ReMaP -- Resource Manager Project
                        The Project Proposal

  0. Prologue
  -----------

With the advent of graphical-based user interfaces (GUI), almost each
computer niche created it's own way of handling the user interface.

For personal computers, one of the first system to appear was the
Macintosh's.  Most of its concepts were result of pioneer work at Xerox.
This system is considered the paradigm of user interfaces.  The 'resource'
idea used in the Mac will serve as main inspiration for this project.
Another breakthrough in GUI was the X-windows system.  This system was
developed in MIT and is extremely flexible.  X-windows is one of the few
(if not the only one) to provide full-transparency over network.  If the
client (main application) and the server (low-level GUI handler) are
running on the same machine, this is purely coincidental.  Interfaces can
be spread over different machines, from different architectures and even
from different operating systems.  This client-server paradigm will also be
used is this project.

The Amiga GUI system is quite lighter in complexity than the two previously
mentioned, although it is consensual that is fast, flexible, intuitive and
has (hardware based) features (like screens) that allow small systems to
have a high-performance graphical interface.  At last, Microsoft Windows
bring about almost nothing new in GUI (just old Mac ideas) balanced with a
heavy-weight marketing operation.  This feature associated with the
low-price and very abundant PC's, allowed Windows to obtain virtually the
monopoly of the computer market.

However there are some resistant survivors (like me) to this mainstream.
What is the problem with Amiga ?  Quite simple : it has just stopped.
There are two major releases of the Amiga OS : 1.3 and 2.0.  The Release
3.0 is almost just a refinement of 2.0, with very little new.  Comparing
the advance of the Amiga GUI with Windows, there is an enormous difference.
In addition to this fact, the Mac technology uses resources from a long
time, while there is nothing (to my knowledge) done in that area in the
Amiga.  NOTE: Do not make confusion between the 'resource's I'm talking
about with the low-level resources on Amiga, used for low-level hardware
arbitration.

  1. Objectives
  ---------------

The Resource Manager Project (ReMaP for short) has the purpose
to implement high-level software layer over an existing GUI system
(MUI, BOOPSI or even plain intuition). The main objectives of this
project are :

a) To reduce the development effort on GUI to the minimum.  A couple of
lines would be enough to trigger an arbitrary complex interface.

b) To make user interfaces as robust as possible.  With X-windows, you can
just 'kill' a process, and the whole interface vanishes.  No hang-up
windows, no dead memory, just simple and clean.

c) To allow the interface to be spread over a network.  The client-server
paradigm is desired here.  No pointer, no shared memory, again simple and
clean.

I think that the implementation of these three ideas could both offer
robustness to the user and flexibility to the developer.  I propose the
creation of a group of Amiga developers and enthusiasts to achieve the
mentioned goals by implementing it in a freeware basis software.

Finally I'd like to stress that the most appropriated approach would the
object oriented one and that the base system should be as language
independent as possible.  (Base system means ReMaP plus the lower layers
until the hardware).

  1.1. The developer's viewpoint
  ------------------------------

The main idea is to turn the building of user interfaces as easy as
possible.  To achieve this goal I propose that the interface creation and
function should be as automatic as possible.  The great majority of
programs _use_ a GUI as a tool, not as an objective.  This concept
justifies that the internal working of the GUI should not be of the concern
of the developer.  It doesn't make much sense to spend hours building and
fine-tuning an interface (in that usual, tedious and slow loop:
edit-compile-run) if there are ways of performing this job aside from
compilation/linkage issues.

To achieve this goal I propose the use of the 'resource' paradigm.  A (very
simple) language must be designed in order to be interpreted in real-time,
building this way the whole interface.  Obviously, the more high-level this
language is, more slower the system will be.  There could be a set of
language levels, where a developer can step to lower ones by the use of
mini-compilers or cpp-like programs.  This way the interface structure and
the object's parameters are embedded in these 'scripts'.  Note that this
feature is totally language independent.  I think that this is the first
time that I refer to 'objects'.  In order to have flexibility and data
abstraction, it seems to me that every interface element should be
abstracted as an object.
 
This approach virtually eliminates all concerns that a developer could have
concerning data structures (or objects) related with interface.  The
application itself must have the most abstract view of the interface.

  1.2. The user's viewpoint
  -------------------------

The kind of abstraction involved here that was outlined in the previous
section allows the system to be quite robust.  All that coding involving
error-checking and handling of the unexpected can be moved from the
application to the base system.  When a user wants to kill an application,
the system must assure that (at least) the interface vanishes, just like
xkill (from X-windows).  With this approach, the system has total control
over the details of the interface allowing it to delete the interface as
easily as it was created.  There is nothing more frustrating than a buggy
interface.  The end user should have bug free interface.  Let the bugs stay
with the main application.  Anytime the core code of an application
crashes, the system should be robust enough to free the user from a 'dead
interface'.

  1.3. The system's viewpoint
  ---------------------------

It was said before that ReMaP should use client-server paradigm.  This
architecture insulates the client from the server in terms of 'dangerous'
things like pointers, shared memory, etc.  The cost to pay is a loss in
speed.  However I believe that high level of communication between the
client and the server, lightens the communication overhead.  The benefits
justify the approach.

The server is just a program running in an arbitrary machine.  Unlike
X-windows, the appearance of the interface will be dependent of the way the
server is related to the rest of the underneath system.  Since the server's
connection to the client is pipe-like, all memory management is up to the
server, avoiding this way memory allocation problems and increasing the
robustness of the system.

All application desiring to use ReMaP must establish a connection (either
local or remote, over a network) with a server.  The resources handling
(script interpretation) are handled by the client.  The client has
references (ID integers) to every object allocated by the client.  The
server has knowledge of which object were allocated by each client.  (The
word 'allocated' is used in a broad meaning, like NewObject(),
OpenWindow(), AllocMem(), etc.).  This way, it is possible to flush a whole
interface tree without fearing for dead memory accesses (mungwall hits).

  2. Project organization
  -----------------------

I'd like to contact everyone interested in working or contributing to this
project.  I'd like to discuss extensively the points outlined above.  I
think that the project must be designed top-bottom, starting with way
resources are specified, followed by the server, continuing to the server
design and ending with server's contact to the underneath system.  Many
parts of the project may be implemented in parallel.

I'll try to create a mailing list for the exclusive use of the project, in
order to maintain a close contact with everyone involved in the project.

Finally I'd like to stress that this project seems quite new in Amiga
development area.  I have no knowledge of a similar project to the moment
of this writing.

I hope that this project contributes anyway to the development of Amiga
software technology.  Even in these troublesome days of Amiga history, I
still hope that Amiga will have a relevant role in computer scene.

AmigaNCP - Amiga to Psion S3/S3a link package

VERSION

1.8

AUTHOR

Oliver Wagner

e-mail: owagner@lsd.wupper.de

DESCRIPTION

Psion's fine palmtop computer series, namely the S3 and S3a, contain an
even finer operating system, whose neat features cover a full fledged
peer-to-peer networking software using a protocol called NCP.  Using NCP,
you can link together two Psion computers or a Psion and a different,
perhaps stationary machine and happily exchange data on your behalf.  NCP
services include, but are not limited to, accessing files on the remote
machines as if they were on yours, in both directions. 

AmigaNCP features a full NCP implementation including a remote file server
to access Amiga files from your Psion and a file system to access Psion
files from your Amiga.  The package also offers an API to allow custom
applications to directly access network services at the NCP level.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

Requires AmigaOS 2.04 and the PC version of the S3-Link serial connector.

The optional development toolkit has been designed for SAS/C 6.x, but might
be usable with different compilers.

Mesa-Amiwin

VERSION

1.2.5

AUTHOR

Original Author: Brian Paul, brianp@ssec.wisc.edu
Amiga Port: Victor Ng-Thow-Hing, victorng@dgp.toronto.edu

DESCRIPTION

Mesa is a software emulation of the popular OpenGL application programmer's
interface for 3D computer graphics.  It can handle gouraud shading, NURBS,
polygons, Z-buffer, and other graphic goodies.

I have included the original Mesa distribution, with special instructions
for the Amiwin (X11R6 on the Amiga) version.  There is also a quick port of
MesaGLUT.lib, the GLUT toolkit (windows and events), provided (but it is
still very buggy). 

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

I have provided static link libraries for a 68040/68882 and 68000/nofpu
equipped Amiga.  However, if you have SAS/C, you can edit the Smakefile and
recompile to whatever cpu configuration you have.

You will need the REGISTERED version of Amiwin to link in the X libraries
(another reason to register!).  Get the development kit for Amiwin at your
local aminet site.  Some examples will require unix-ish type header files
such as in <sys/time.h>, <sys/types.h> and function calls like sleep().
This will require an emulation library like net.lib provided in the
software development kit for AmiTCP4.0.

Extended functions exist for loading, analysing and printing texts, e.g.
scanning of directories with wildcards, print with page title and page
number, a 'smart_print' mode, word statistics and count of strings/chars. 
Search routines are very fast and display all occurrences at once on
screen.  Patterns can be used.  Search can also be started by klicking on a
string.  NEXT has been tested under OS 1.2 and 3.0.

Other features:

    o can be made resident
    o decrunches powerpacked files without powerpacker.library

[To a great deal of public horror, Microsoft recently purchased Blue Ribbon
Soundworks, one of the first companies to pledge continuing support to the
Amiga when Commodore collapsed.  This letter has been making the rounds and
explains the "so long, see you on Windows95" policy implemented for Amiga
products.  -Jason]

Sb: #Blue Ribbon Amiga News!
Fm: Dominick J. Fontana 74766,2154
To: ALL

                       *** TO ALL AMIGA USERS ***

I have spoken to Melissa Jordan Grey, Todor Fay, and Brian Thomas from Blue
Ribbon.  They all asked me to send their regards and to wish everyone a
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

In case you were unaware, Blue Ribbon was purchased by Microsoft.  As such,
Microsoft is now technically in charge of all Blue Ribbon products and
makes all decisions concerning future software support.  Microsoft has
indicated that they will provide tech support for the Blue Ribbon Windows
products and they will continue to make such products.  I believe that the
Windows tech support may eventually be moved to the Microsoft Forum.
However, they are not providing tech support for the Amiga products, nor
will they continue to make Amiga products.  But, the Blue Ribbon section in
the MIDI C Vendor Forum (GO MIDICVEN) will remain open so that both Amiga
users and Windows users can congregate and support one another.

In order to thank all the Amiga users for their past support, and as a
parting good will gesture to the Amiga community, Blue Ribbon/Microsoft
have decided to make most of Blue Ribbon's Amiga software available to all
CompuServe members FREE OF CHARGE!

Following is a message directly from Brian Thomas, which he asked me to
post for him.  Brian was the online tech support representative in MIDI C
VENDOR Forum for Blue Ribbon for the last year and a half.

 =====================

Dear Amigans,

Hi.  My name is Brian Thomas, the person that has answered many of your
technical and product questions over the last year.  It has been fun
working with all of you.

As many of you may know, Microsoft has purchased Blue Ribbon in hopes of
letting us bring interactive music to the masses of the world.  All of the
Blue Ribbonites are very excited about being given this opportunity.

As a result of the change, I am not able to monitor this CompuServe forum,
and that is one of the reasons recent questions to me have not been
answered.  It is my fault that I did not find a way to check on this, or at
least find someone else to answer the questions in my absence.

The current plans do not include producing any new products for the Amiga,
but something unexpected (and good) happened.  Microsoft decided to allow
us to upload most of the Blue Ribbon Amiga products to be available for
free to CompuServe members.

This will occur soon: Early 1996 (by mid-January, most likely), these
products will be uploaded to CompuServe in the Microsoft forum.  There will
be a message [in MIDI C VENDOR] that lets you know exactly where to go to
get the products.

However, there are some important things to keep in mind.  Not all our
Amiga products are going to be uploaded, and none of the Windows, OS/2, or
Indigo products will be uploaded.  This is not a mistake, and you are not
allowed to upload these products.

Also, you will not be allowed to repost the products to other on-line
services, or Internet sites.  This benefit of free products is initially
going to be allowed only to CompuServe customers.

Finally, none of the programs are shareware or public domain.  You will
have to agree to an end user license agreement to be allowed to download
the products from CompuServe.

The products that will initially be uploaded will be Bars&Pipes
Professional v2.5, SuperJAM!  Amiga v1.1, Pro Studio Tools Kit, Creativity
Tools Kit, Internal Sounds Kit, and Rules for Tools.  These products are
not crippled in any way!  They are FULL products.  Soon to follow will be
PatchMeister.

Accompanying these programs will be an official statement from Melissa
Jordan Grey.

In addition, you'll be given the opportunity to purchase a manual for
SuperJAM!  or Bars&Pipes, and details on how to do that will be posted at
the same time the products are uploaded.

It is highly encouraged that you provide support for each other either on
CompuServe, or other on-line services.  Since the products are going to be
available free, Microsoft won't be able to provide any tech support for the
Amiga products.

That's the best update I can give right now.  If more news arrives, I will
provide it for you.

Feel free to repost this message to other online forums, whether they be
CompuServe or otherwise, as long as you keep the body of this message
intact.

Again, thank you for your support, and enjoy the products!

          X Patch preview
  -------------------------------
  "Intuition windows with X look"

  Author: Kenneth C. Nilsen / kenneth@norconnect.no

This patch is written to give all the intuition windows a X-window look. 
It does not emulate a X11 terminal or similar.  There is already great
software on the AmiNet which will do that.

This patch will draw new borders, titlebar, depth-, close- and zip-gadgets
to all windows so it will look like a "Motive X" window.

The patch offer options which enable you to configure it to look as your
taste require.

  ---------
  "OPTIONS"
  ---------

 Active                    - enables the patch
 Pop front when activated  - make window the frontmost when activated
 Jump back when inactive   - when inactive, jump to back
 Inner frame               - draws a inner frame along the borders
 Pre-set window            - preplace window before it opens
 Option menu in window     - make a project menu in the window
 Minimize gadget           - for future use (emulates the ->AppIcon)
 Bone mark in broder       - makes a little bonemark in the borders
 Title left                - align text to left (default in the middle)
 Title right               - align text from right

 Force clean up - This special function will parse the task list when
                  hitting the "Cleanup" button.  The task name for the
                  window is stored in an internal structure and if the task
                  is not found the window will be closed.  This can be
                  ignored with special treatment.

 Colors   - select colors for borders, fill, title etc.
 Sizes    - width/height of borders, size gadgets etc.
 Font     - font for title
 Cleanup  - check for leftover windows
 Test     - tests your current options

 Special treatment:

This listview contain windows that shall be treated with special options. 
A window can be ignored by the patch if the window refuse to get patched,
or you can set private options for each window.

Some windows will may crash when using the patch.  If so, add it to the
list and set ignore.  Most window will work though if they follow the
guidelines.

The patch will add a few pixels in width and height and force the drawing
plane to be inside the borders (which the intuition doesn't).  The border
width and height fields are set so the host programs can easily adjust
their gadgets and graphics to fit within the window borders.

Note: Some programs will handle their own windows in their own way, add
gadgets etc.  like the MUI windows.  These windows can be ignored by this
patch if wanted.

  ------------
  "THE SERVER"
  ------------

The "brain" is a server which controls window moving, activation and the
gadgets.  To graphically patch a window causes many difficult tasks.  It
have to "emulate" the intuiton gadgets and the active/inactive modes to
update the borders correctly and to let the programs know when the eg.
closegadget is hit.

The patch will not use any BOOPSI class, so the server will send input
events to the active window port by the input.device.

When you move a window the server has to emulate the move too.  This can
have advantages such as eg.  moving the whole contents of a window, or to
make a nicer grid when moving it.  These functions are not yet implemented,
but the possibilities are there (opaque window).

Sizing the window will be a pleasure.  You can size it from any corner as
long as the size option is enabled by the host program.

As I mentioned, you can pre-place the window.  This means you'll get a
frame of the window in its actual size as it will be when opened.  You can
now move the frame anywhere and press the left mouse button, and the window
will appear at this place.  This will of course override the tag settings.
If the tags will not allow a dragbar, this option will be ignored.

  ----------
  "RELEASES"
  ----------

Currently you can only get a demo version of the patch on AmiNet in
util/wb/XwinDemo.lha.  This demo only opens a window with the x-window
look.  The only gadget which is working is the close gadget.  If you have
the XSize commodity installed you can resize it too.

I will try to get finished a beta release in February next year (1996).  At
the moment I have a lot to do so I have not much time to work on the patch,
but I will try to get it done as soon as possible.

If you have suggestions, ideas, comments or critism, just e-mail me: Note
that things previewed here are subjects to change.

SMG North American Dealer List

[We don't plan to make a habit of this, as it's a rather large list.
However, running the SMG North American dealer list from time to time may
at least encourage other distributors to do the same.  It's also
interesting to see the appearance of CEI as well as the apparent expansion
of SMG into Japan.  -Jason]

DESCRIPTION

Xoper is a system monitor to display various system lists.  For example, it
can show all running tasks with their cpu usage.  Xoper not only displays a
list of all tasks but it can show other system lists from Exec, DOS or
Intuition as well.  Some examples are the port list, available windows and
screens, and DOS-devices.

NEW FEATURES

This release is mainly to fix bugs (for a complete list consult the guide).

One important change affects the CLI start.  Xoper now uses a new technique
to detach itself from the CLI that is officially supported by the system. 
For those who do not like detaching, Xoper offers a new option `KEEPIO' to
disable that feature.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

The program requires at least version 1.2 (V33) of the operating system.

DESCRIPTION

Oberon System V4 for Amiga (O4A) is a full implementation of ETH Zurich's
Oberon System V4.

Oberon is both a programming language and an operating system developed by
Prof.  N.  Wirth and Prof.  J.  Gutknecht.

The Oberon System in key words:
 - Single-process multitasking
 - Garbage collector - memory will be released automatically if
   not needed anymore
 - Commandos: procedures that can be called like programs
 - Dynamic loading: modules are loaded and linked to the system
   during run-time (if necessary)
 - Text as a built-in abstract data type (for example a
   Minesweeper game as a letter (like OLE and OpenDOC))
 - Graphical user interface

A special advantage is the very high compatibility of the systems between
implementations on different computers.  System V4 implementations exist
for Amiga, Mac, Power Mac, Windows (NT), Linux, IBM-RS6000, Sun-Sparc,
HP-Workstations, NeXt, ...  You can use a program written on one
implementation on any other without change.

O4A is a full implementation of the Oberon System V4 with all usual
programs.  The system runs in its own task and therefore you can use O4A
and the Amiga OS at the same time.  Specific features of the Amiga
implementation are its incremental heap allocation, support of the Amiga
clipboard and the capability of accessing IFF files.

The O4A package contains:
 - A full Oberon-2 compiler
 - Development tools (Browser, Analyzer, Disassembler)
 - XE, a comfortable 'editor' with layout functions
 - Kepler, an object-oriented 2D vector drawing program
 - Paint, a simple pixel-oriented paint program
 - A lot of additional tools (Draw, RX, AsciiCoder, ...)
 - Various text elements
 - Games: Tetris and Minesweeper (with source)
 - Example sources and online documentation

To get more information about the programming language and operating system
Oberon have a look at the "Oberon and Amiga" WWW page:
http://sun1.rrzn.uni-hannover.de/~nhbidegn/oa-e.html There you will find
links to other Oberon information resources.
 
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

- Amiga with OS2.0 or higher
- at least an MC68020
- a minimum of 1.5 MB free memory (2.5 MB recommended)
- about 3 MB disk space
- FPU for floating point calculations
  (without FPU Oberon-NonFPU.lha is required)

AVAILABILITY

The Home of Oberon is the ETH Zurich.  There you can find many Oberon
System implementations, especially the Amiga version:

ftp://ftp.inf.ethz.ch/pub/Oberon/Amiga/V1.0/

Oberon.lha (1.1 MB)        - main archive
Oberon-NonFPU.lha (100 KB) - to use O4A without FPU
Oberon-Src.lha (600 KB)    - the full source of O4A

It is available in the Aminet directory dev/obero, too.

@toc NEWS

NAME

KingFisher

VERSION

2.20

SYNOPSIS

A major update to the PREMIER "Fish Disk" & CD-ROM software catalog
maintenance and search tool available to all Amigas w/ KS2.04 or later.
See PURPOSE section below for more details.

NEW FEATURES

----- KingFisher 2.20 -----------------------------------------
Hotlinked Product-Info    - View live Product-Info while you edit
Product-Info files        - More robust, flexible, compatible
Paint your own buttons    - Replace any of 28 gadgets (KS39+)
Default Database          - If missing, KingFisher won't panic
Improved documentation    - *Major* rework, better organization
Keyfile                   - No more huge, ugly patches(*)
Numerous minor improvments in various areas.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Adding Fish               - Major bug fixed (froze)
Numerous misfeatures and minor bugs fixed.
---------------------------------------------------------------
(*)Registered users may receive their keyfiles by email or via
   upgrades as described in the documentation.

PURPOSE

KingFisher is a tool specifically designed to maintain and search one or
more databases for software.  The program permits manual browsing, but
offers a powerful expression parser through which you can explain to
KingFisher exactly what you are looking for.

The layout of database records for display is programmable, as is the
format used for printing and that for writing records to a file.  This
permits complete customization, separately for each database.

Allowing you to view a "live" Product-Info file now enables you to have
KingFisher instantly demonstrate the effect of an edit.  Produce
Product-Info files for your software more easily than ever!

KingFisher uses a resizable GadTools window on the default public screen or
on a custom screen, offers the choice of both smart and simple refresh
windows, and supports proportional fonts (including scalable fonts) of
nearly any size.

KingFisher supports more than one database, and databases that are larger
than a single disk volume, which are spread over any number of disks to be
mounted on request.

Using advanced Client-Server Technology, KingFisher supports multiple
simultaneous users with a minimum of memory overhead (as little as 35K) for
each user (an ARexx-based interface named RexxFisher provides a BBS with
the means to serve many databases to many users!) KingFisher's multi-user
support in NO WAY hinders its value in a single-user environment!

KingFisher is localized.  Catalogs are supplied for Dansk, Deutsch,
Espanol, Nederlands, Suomi, and Svenska.  More are expected as translators
are found (hint, hint!)

Fully integrated AmigaGuide help provides context sensitive assistance and
information on menu items and gadgets under the mouse pointer.  Hundreds of
links cross-reference over 200K of redesigned documentation.

KingFisher comes with a complete, read-to-use database of descriptions for
Fred's "Fish Disks" 1-1000!  The command "Install database..." helps adding
existing databases from CD-ROM.

REQUIREMENTS

With Fish Disk Database (1.5MB), approximately 2.2MB of harddisk space is
needed.  The program requires about 300K of memory to run, depending on the
size of the database index files and some other factors.  Kickstart V37
(2.04) is required; V38 (2.1) is required for localization.

COMPATIBILITY
O/S:      Minimum KS V37 (2.04); V38 recommended; V39/V40 best!
CPU:      68000 through 68040.  Untested on 68060.
Display:  Picasso II, EGS Spectrum, CyberGraphics.

Enforcer and Mungwall used during testing.

PRICE
Shareware registration fee is $20(US) or DM30.  A registration site in
Germany is available for European users.

---------------------------------------------------------------
USERS GROUPS and their members are eligible for a 20% discount!
You must provide name and mailing address for your users group
to be eligible for the discount price: $16(US) or DM24.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Fun, Fame & Furious
===================

Tired of the usuall dull and boring technical information found on most
Amiga webpages?  Tired of pages that never updates or get refreshed?
Looking for something to waste some time on?  Well then, read on!

This is the annoncement of the first 'infotainment' webpage dedicated to
the Amiga only.  You might have read about it back in AmigaReport 3.19, but
until now, I have been busy figuring out how to organize, design and set up
the service.

The object of the webpage is to create a place that everyone can stop for a
few minutes and enjoy themselves.  All (or most) text is dedicated directly
to the computer we all love - the Amiga.  Anecdotes, stories, tricks, how
someone has used his or her Amiga in a specially clever or different way,
people on other platforms stupidity, amazing hardware and software, records
of computerkind, etc., etc.  To simply put it: as long as it either fun or
interesting, and involves the Amiga in some way, it qualifies for the page!

Currently only a few articles have been added, but already the page is
shaping up.  However, it's now we are coming to the main point: how much I
ever want, I can't collect and supply information in the amount needed!  I
need help to make this happen!

This is not my page!  This is OUR page!  If you like it, and want it to
survive, YOU must contribute!  If you don't like the appearance, atleast
tell me!  If I get many diffrent suggestions, I'll arrange a voting!  But
without feedback it's impossible to know what to do.

So, how is this page maintained?  Well, the main reason why most homepages
never or seldom gets updated, is that the person responsible for it either
works in an alien and/or unfriendly environment, ie.  Unix and PC, or that
the process for uploading the information to the www directory (usually the
homedirectory) involves so many cumbersome steps that only the thought of
doing it, discourages even the most determinded writer.

I soon realised this and developed an arexx script that automatically
checks if there is files to upload or directories to make, and
simultaenously maintaines the files, inserts datestrings etc.  In the
development is also a routine that creates and maintaince a history index,
which contains links to each article that have been uploaded.  This makes
it easier (not to say possible!) to resume reading from the previous
location.  Ok, if you have a giant setting for your global history file in
your web browser, you may maybe succed in remembering which articles you
have read but I doubt it.  The history index file will contain links in
historical order (hence the name :) and an user can jump in reading from
the date of the latest visit.

What is now the name of this amazing page?  Well, actually it has no real
name sofar, only a work name: 'Funny Stories', which I after long
discussions have determinded to discard.  If you have a suggestion, please
tell me.

Check out the page at:

 http://artworks.apana.org.au/~johan/iasf

Although this URL is subject to change, it will be valid for the
predictable future.  Contributions, questions, suggestions, etc.  can be
sent to:

DESCRIPTION

MagicCX is the definite commodity/system enhancer for any Amiga running OS
2.x or better.  It is a very powerful and flexible system.  MagicCX is a
multifunctional commodity/tool collection which is somehow unique as it
does not contain all the functions offered, but has the main
functions/features built into external modules, so that users may configure
MagicCX to their needs.  MagicCX is the successor of KCommodity, which was
a multifunctional commodity/tool, too.  The program offers a lot more
functions than KCommodity.  All of the functions known from KCommodity were
put into MagicCX and were enhanced, of course.

Some of the main features the program offers are: CycleToMenu, PhoneBill
(Modem conntect monitoring with cost calculation), Screen/Window Grabber,
AnalogClock, Calendar, Window manipulation functions of all sort (like
cycling, activating, hunting for windows), Screen Blanker with
Blanker/Dimmer and several external blanker modules, Mouse blanker, Screen
Selector type facilities, ToolAlias, ARexx control, Titlebar clock,
Function keys, Exploding Windows, Keystroke clicker, WBGauge, system wide
String gadget enhancements, and much, much more.

  *** MagicCX is an SASG product ***

- It incorporates many, many features known from
  other commodities/tools, while offering new, unseen
  features

- External preferences program allows full control
  over MagicCX and all the functions.

- It offers a special module design, known from
  Workbench. You may install/use modules/functions
  by simply dragging them to a Modules directory, if
  not used, move them to a storage directory.

- Localized under OS 2.1 and up. English, German, French,
  Danish, and Swedish translations available

- Compact system installation. Only a few files
  will be spread around your system. All others
  are kept in a single directory (Configurable)

- Only basic functions (window activation and such)
  are built into the main program. The remaining
  features were put into external modules

- MagicCX comes with 28 (for now) different modules
  you may choose from.

- Flexible blanker system with two internal blankers
  and 25 (for now) external blanker modules

- Utilizes powerful gadget layout library (gtlayout.library)

- ...and much, much more

NEW FEATURES

- 7 new powerful modules

- 5 new blanker modules

- plenty of fixes, enhancements, improvements

- Actually too much to mention here, take a look at the
  history file, which is approximately 27KB in size, just
  mentioning changes from 1.1 to 1.2

@node FEATURE1 "WORMS Tips"
@toc FEATURE

[Funny how we haven't had a chance to review it yet, but hey, here's an
article of tips on the game Worms by the author himself. -Jason]

===========================================================================
   EVERYTHING YOU WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT WORMS, BUT WERE TOO AFRAID TO ASK
                         BY ANDY "WORMS" DAVIDSON
===========================================================================

First of all, thanks to everyone who has bought the game - here's all the
hidden stuff I put in Amiga WORMS, and a lot more besides ...

* ONE MAN AND HIS SHEEP

Need more sheep?  Get depressed when you pick up every weapon crate, only
to end up with 9 teleports and 7 cluster bombs?

Type in TOTAL WORMAGE (with the space) on the title screen for "SHEEP
MODE".  If you're using a joypad press GREEN, UP, PAUSE, PAUSE, YELLOW
(which spells GUPPY - a tribute to the late Bananafish)

This gives you 3 sheep, 1 banana bomb and a minigun straight away (go into
Weapon Options if you need an UNLIMITED SUPPLY of sheep)

For all those who were offended at the thought of sheep being kept in small
wooden crates, sheep mode lets you shoot ANY weapon crate to FREE THE
SHEEP!  Killing your opponent with a liberated sheep is a very satisfying
way to win and well worth activating smug mode for.

* A FAMOUS LEGEND

The "legendary prod move" is a not available in any shops, you can only buy
by doing this combination of moves (in the best Mortal Kombat tradition)
...

Get next to your victim and press AWAY, AWAY, TOWARDS, TOWARDS (in other
words, if your worm is facing right press left, left, right, right)

* CUSTOMISING THAT WORM BUT MORE SO

The custom level option is EVEN MORE EXCITING than you thought - you can
set the gravity, friction, sky and water colours for your levels ...

Instead of saving your level as FISHCAKE.WRM, save it as FISHCAKE.????.WRM
the 4 question marks being 4 numbers ...

The first number is gravity and can be between 1 and 5 (1=very low,
3=normal 5=very high).  Mars and alien levels have a gravity of 2.

The second number is friction and can be between 1 and 5 (1=very low,
3=normal, 5=very high).  Arctic and alien levels have a friction of 2.

The third and forth numbers are the sky and water colours and can be
between and 9 - fans of green water can now have a matching green sky.

You can also make your own message appear, when your level is chosen, by
giving your level file a comment.  Do this by clicking on the level icon
and choosing "Information" from the Workbench menus (the icon menu on 2.0+)

If you want to share your level with the rest of the world, then upload it
to ftp.team17.com in the directory /pub/incoming

* MAKING IT OFFICIAL

When playing with 4 people it is normal either for 3 people to gang up on 1
(fox and rabbit type thing) or for 2 to join forces to get rid of the other
2 who have resorted to the EVIL use of the blow torch (star wars type
thing) You can now recreate the Darth Vader/Luke Skywalker thing (and shout
"you're not my father" alot) with the OFFICAL TWO AGAINST TWO MODE!

At team select after you have clicked on 4 teams, click on 2 again - the
stars will change to circles (a symbolic type thing).

* LOTS OF WORMS IN A LIST

The Wormlist lets you keep a record of loads of people's worms.  You just
have to type their name at Team Entry, click on List and all their worms
will be listed.  However, before this is possible you will have to get rid
of all the default ownerless worms.  These were put in for those people who
panic when asked to name their worms and resort to the EVIL 1,2,3+4 team.

To kill a load of innocent worms, go to records and choose View Wormlist. 
Highlight a worm that isn't one of yours or the computers and press the
right mouse button.  After you have assasinated all the unwanted worms,
click on ok and go to Save Wormlist.

* EVEN MORE KEYS

If you don't know people well enough to keep reaching across them, you have
another set of keys to control your worm on the left of the keyboard ...

z=left, c=right, x=down, d=up, ctrl=jump, tab=toggle names, '=centre on worm

You can use two mouses as well by selecting two controllers in Options.

* WHAT THE ....?

If you feel a word is missing from this sample then change it to something
more appropriate for a highly dangerous explosive device landing next to a
small pink invertebrate (?!)

All the samples on disks 2+3 in the TWEnglish/TWFrench/TWGerman drawers are
IFF - just replace them with your own but don't exceed the size of the
original samples or WORMS will crash violently at Game Start.  Also, don't
change the names of the samples.  BUT USE BACKUPS!  =)

Don't forget, if you make a good sample set then upload it to
ftp.team17.com in the directory /pub/incoming.

* FOUR BILLION?  BUT WHICH ONES?

If you find a particularly good level in Amiga WORMS make sure you tell
everyone, especially if you find one of the weird levels (you'll know them
when you see them!), or a level that looks like an animal!

These are the best levels I've found so far ...

1803921718 - weirdful scrapyard level (best level so far)
3549908729 - jungle level with crashed helicopter on island
252101829  - another one of the weird levels, a perfectly curved island
345076839  - bridge over troubled island
1706205299 - arctic caves
THORAHIRD  - explore her hidden depths

And from the animal collection (only some people can see them!) ...

954338916  - sneezing alien elephant
2810298544 - horse sticking head out of water
3376459905 - a bit of a triceratops

* A LONG TIME AGO ...

WORMS started life 4 years ago as a simple tank game called ARTILLERY.
It's aim was to keep us conscious during A-Level Art.  But tanks weren't
interest enough, and they were soon replaced with soldiers in ARTILLERY 2.
As A-Level Art got more boring, more stuff such as teams of soldiers and
dynamite was added resulting in ***ARTILLERY.  Having survived A-Level Art,
it eventually became clear that soldiers weren't interesting enough either
- a replacement had to be found for "the things that walk and jump".

Worms were decided on, as back in August '93, none of them had ever been
called Jim.  A complete rewrite started under the name Total Wormage, or TW
as everyone playtesting it had to call it.  Alot of sleepless nights later,
September '94, I took it to the ECTS and showed Martyn Brown at Team 17. 
After 5 minutes he said "Do you want it published?"

Total Wormage became WORMS and came out in November '95.  So the moral of
this tale is if you want to get a game published, take A-Level Art.

ARTILLERY - 1991
ARTILLERY 2 - 1991
***ARTILLERY - 1991-1993
TOTAL WORMAGE - 1993-1994
WORMS - 1994-1995

* ABOUT THAT CONCRETE DONKEY

The garden should be a happy place, but if there is a large concrete donkey
standing in it, it puts a bit of a downer on things.  As a child I was very
disturbed by it - I was convinced that my parents had concreted over a real
donkey and just left it there (what happened to Bananafish also got me
suspicious).  I can remember chipping away at its tail with a stone, to see
if there was fur under there.

Today, the donkey has taken on a religious significance resulting in the
"Cult of the Concrete Donkey".  Sacrifical gifts are regularly laid between
its ears, the most recent being a small can of Heinz Baked Beans
(unopened).

This practice of concreting over donkeys may be more widespread as there
have recently been sightings of other concrete donkeys - most disturbing of
all was that one of them was a baby donkey.

* DONKEY WATCH

"Donkey Watch" was started to see exactly how many donkeys have ended up as
nothing more than garden "ornaments".  If you see one, make sure you report
it.

* ABOUT BANANAFISH

Bananafish was a white and yellow goldfish, and was pretty clever as
goldfish go - he could play dead, and roll over on command.  Sadly,
Bananafish came to a nasty end when the pond was filled with concrete.
There have been various sightings of Bananafish over the years, but none of
them have been confirmed

* AN APOLOGY ...

I promised a load of people on IRC channel #Amiga their own worms in Amiga
WORMS, and then proceeded to lose the piece of paper I wrote them down on!
to all the people I discussed Concrete Donkeys with - StoneD, RMerlin,
MrDaniel and everyone else - sorry =(

* WORMS -> ?

I was adding stuff to Amiga Worms right up until its release, and I'm doing
a patch disk at the moment to fix any bugs in it.  This disk will also add
all the things that I didn't have time for.

If there's anything you want to say about WORMS - I'd like to know.

Keep on worming ...

                     The Commodore Postscript Project

===========================================================================

December 1995 (C) Laurence Vanhelsuw

---

Hello all you Commodore watchers...  here's a real story you didn't know or
read about so far.

It's about 3 Commodore software engineers, a Postscript laser printer, and
Life's ups and downs.

For myself, one of the engineers (Laurence Vanhelsuw), it all began one
cold day in January 1991.

A small, insignificant job ad peered back at me from the pages of
"Computing", a British weekly I.T.  industry journal which devotes half its
pages to job advertisements.  The ad mentioned our beloved Amiga, a rare
thing to mention in these types of "serious" magazines.

As if my years of Amiga experience weren't enough inducement to immediately
launch an enticing CV printed on highest quality paper, the ad also
mentioned Postscript, a language I knew and liked a lot.  Clearly the ad
had potential and, sure enough, I didn't have to twiddle my thumbs for too
long before I was invited for an interview...

My eyes expanded to cover half my face when I learned that this mystery
progressive company (who dared using Amigas !) was in fact...  Commodore
itself.

Commodore ?!  But I thought Commodore's only U.K.  presence was in the
south of England (with their Maidenhead box-shifting centre).  And this
interview would be in Hull: the antithesis of an attractive city; a city
without an ounce of enviable cultural or architectural heritage.

But Hull it was.  Life's so strange sometimes :-)
(My apologies to any inhabitants of Hull I've offended, but hey: it's a
real dump isn't it ?!)

More surprises were to follow though.  My interview was to be held at the
premises of the recruiting company that originally advertised the position.
That company had offices - of sorts - in a bland, old, half-deserted
terraced house in a plain old residential area.  Commodore officials would
interview me there, the recruitment company had told me.

As I approached the front door I fully expected an ugly housewife in
slippers to open the door and tell me to go sell my vacuum cleaners
somewhere else (she would have had to be quite drunk since my black attach
case didn't look anything like a vacuum cleaner).

But no, as the buzzing lock opened the door, I was simply greeted by a
simplistic arrow sign pointing to the first floor.  I had played adventure
games before, but this was ridiculous...

On the first floor I was finally greeted with the recruiting lady I had
exchanged letters and messages with (but no bodily fluids - shame).  She
simply welcomed me and told me she would inform the Commodore interviewer
of my arrival.  Minutes later he materialized out of nowhere and took me
into a small interviewing room.

The usual interviewing exchanges took place: he asked me to summarize my
life - something which had already become embarrassingly complex by that
time - and then proceeded to explain what the job would consist of.  In
this case nothing less than the full implementation of a Postscript
interpreter, from scratch, and for the Amiga.  Other tasty carrots were
dangled in front of my (starving) face; the most interesting one being the
programming of the next generation graphics.library with added support for
the AA graphics chipset.

I must have radiated a lot of enthusiasm as the interviewer, Steve Beats,
wanted to show me the actual premises.  I was about to see Commodore's
secretive R&D inner sanctum.  I prepared myself for a short trip in a car,
or something along those lines...  instead all that happened was a short
walk down the stairs to the ground floor level and going through another
door !

   What ?!

Commodore was located on the floor beneath the recruiting company?

If the "offices" of the recruiting company above our heads were sparse, to
say the least, then "Commodore's" offices were proportionately primitive,
chaotic and dirty to boot.

Yes, the thoroughly uncelebrated "Hull branch" of Commodore International
was in fact one single large room in an old, half-empty terraced house. 
Glitter and glamour.  Not a hint.  I was disappointed.

No secretaries, no managers, no testing department, no hardware people, no
cleaning ladies, no bosses.  Nothing !

When we walked through the door, one young programmer got up and greeted
me.  Yep, "they" were TWO, an Apple- or Microsoft-crushing TWO.  Most
amputees from the world's timber industries could count them: one...  TWO!

..and I was supposed to become number three.

Of course, without a job at the time, and with this very exciting software
project on the table (Postscript from scratch), I effortlessly managed to
blot out the surrealist working environment and eagerly accepted the job.

I moved from Leicester to Hull, and for the first week or so stayed in a
hotel close by, while I sorted out some more permanent accommodation.

Work, on the other hand, was quicker in coming.  The goal was simple:
Postscript on the Amiga.  We had a real Postscript laser printer in the
room and all the official Addison-Wesley Adobe manuals (the red, green and
blue books).  Enough reference material to get going immediately.

Steve Beats, who will go down the Amiga Hall of Fame for his involvement
with the Fast File System and the scsi.device, charged me with leading the
project due to Commodore West Chester's incessant calls on him.  The new
filing system and SCSI code needed bugs ironing out, plus there were at
that time also some difficult decisions to be made regarding (the by now
infamous) Retargetable Graphics (RTG) issue.

After some 6 years of relying on the quickly obsolete becoming Amiga
graphics architecture, everyone agreed that the OS itself had to somehow
pull itself free from this damaging embrace with its underlying hardware
that had once put it so much in the spotlights.

Postscript was put forward by some people (but none of us three) as the
solution.  After all, didn't Steve Jobs' Next's reliance on Postscript give
it some tremendous advantages over lesser machines ?  True, but we weren't
convinced for the Amiga.  My personal view was that we needed to design a
graphics hardware-independent API (an E.G.S.  or a CyberGraphX) so that
third-party graphics cards could be supported, as was standard in the PC
world.  Graphics cards were extremely expensive for the Amiga at that time,
and official software support could bring those prices down, benefitting
everyone involved.

Bill Gates' Windows kludge was gaining popularity at a fierce pace and even
that lowly piece of spaghetti code had card-independence.  For the Amiga to
loose a battle on graphics, its forte for years, was unacceptable !

While the knot (Postscript vs.  an RTG API) hadn't yet been fully cut, we
had to keep ourselves busy with researching Postscript-technology in
preparation for the full, bright, green light, whatever direction it would
launch us in.

About a month after I started.  Steve even went to the States to take part
in an important graphics meeting.  RTG Would be discussed, and Postscript.
But Postscript won over an in-house designed API.

All brakes were released and from then on we were eating, breathing and
dreaming about Postscript.

Steve's FFS and SCSI problems meant he only got involved from time to time
during the initial stages of the project.

The junior team member, Paul Jones, who had joined Steve about a month
before me joining, and I, started the ball rolling.

Paul custom-wrote the syntactical scanner module.  No use of lex/yacc
technology was made...  no doubt because none of us were raised on UNIX
(none of us had any engineering diplomas either, but that didn't stop us).
In retrospect this was just as well, as the performance hit incurred due to
using such generic tools would have slowed down the interpreter even more.

After Paul and I were confident enough about our own understanding of
Postscript (gained through simple self-inflicted crash-courses!) I tasked
myself to categorize all Postscript language operators (analogous to
commands in other languages) so we could draw up an implementing schedule
for each.

Building block operators would have to be implemented first, easy or not. 
Then as many easy operators as possible, since they would give our
subconscious minds some time to chew on the much more complex issues to
tackle later on in the project.

Postscript isn't a collection of operators, of course.  The operators are
the flesh that hangs from a very well designed skeleton of core systems and
data structures.

Anyone who's had a look at Postscript knows it's a stack-based language. 
Postscript in fact uses several programmer-visible stacks: one for
operands, one for "dictionaries", one as the "execution stack" and another
for the graphic contexts.  The way any Postscript interpreter aspiring to
be fully Adobe compatible has to be designed is to rely on these
user-visible stacks internally too.  And heavily so.

All three of us combined minds and quickly figured out the non-trivial
inter-relationships between Postscript's memory management, string and file
handling, stack architecture and a host of other features.  Lots of
detective work on the laser printer gave us the invaluable insights
necessary to start picturing a model of the software structure of any
Postscript engine.

Our initial goal was to have a skeleton system produce, without any
kludges, the answer "4" to the simple input

   PS> 2 2 add =

And sure enough, that goal was quickly reached, within 2 months of starting
the project.  By that time most of the underlying structure was already in
place and this allowed me to start implementing the main language operators
at a furious pace, following my schedule planned weeks earlier.

Paul concentrated on string and file handling since this had some complex
interactions with his syntax scanning module.

In parallel I implemented almost all the attribute, array, control,
boolean, math and operand stack operators.

At this time Steve Beats still hadn't been able to join us full-time due to
his ongoing maintenance jobs.  His presence was again needed in the States.
As he flew off (business class of course) Paul and I could only dream of
the "real" Commodore across the pond, the place where all the real action
was going on...

Maybe we would, in time, also become famous Amiga engineers with our
Postscript, we thought.

Instead, next on my menu were dictionaries: a major feature of Postscript
and a performance critical one.  Since we allocated ourselves on a
first-come-first-serve basis (for subtasks with non-specific needs), I
began work on this since Paul was still busy doing the file operators. 
Soon dictionaries too were part of our Amiga Postscript.

Things were falling into place like perfectly matched jigsaw pieces.

Around that time Steve was finally relieved of all further work on FFS and
his SCSI driver.  He started work on the all-important graphics aspects of
Postscript.

Up till then we had been -quite rightly- concentrating on the non-graphical
aspects of Postscript.  The language core if you wish, since all the
graphics-related stuff builds on and uses the more primitive operators to
achieve its power.

Paul attacked Bezier curves, since he wasn't afraid of some math, and also
took it upon himself to design and implement the 'image' family of
operators.

Since the Postscript fonts rely very heavily on Postscript dictionaries, I
was the logical choice to tackle that can of worms.

Soon enough all three would have to start synchronizing our work since to
have one single character rendered "a la Postscript", you need line and
curve segments, rendered using true polygon fills and all this supervised
and managed by a system relying on dictionaries and Postscript procedures.

If by that time we could still have been unsure as to whether Postscript
was the answer for the Amiga's graphics architecture or not, our first
rendered characters gave us the resounding answer: "NO".

Not only was the whole system infinitely too slow (compared to the average
native speed of Text() ), but the characters exhibited graphical
inconsistencies due to the nature of the device independent calculation
pipeline inside Postscript.

In Postscript, graphical entities (curves, paths, images, fonts) are
manipulated in mathematical space until the very last moment when they are
mapped to device coordinates and rendered.  Therefore, interactions between
a device's grid coordinates and the user's floating point world coordinates
often create visually spoiling artifacts.

Adobe Postscript invests a large amount of computing resources to eliminate
these glitches in fonts through the use of "character hints" and other
increasingly obscure and secret technologies (that's how they make a
fortune selling Postscript licenses, which Commodore wanted to avoid
paying).

Of course not every character on a Postscript-rendered page is drawn the
hard way.  The font sub-system has a font cache which stores recently drawn
characters for subsequent recall, if needed.  But even with this cache, it
was clear that Text() would never, in its deepest self, use a Postscript
engine to put characters on Amiga screens.  Still, we proceeded as demanded
from us.

With the end in sight for our Level 1 Postscript system, and in the middle
of writing a dot matrix driver (instead of a screen driver), which would
have given all Amiga owners true Postscript-quality output on plain old
matrix printers, Steve relayed us rumours that our project was going to be
cancelled.  Only Steve had full access to internal R&D E-Mail.

This immediately forced a rift down the middle of our 3-man team: Steve
Beats, who had previously been based in West Chester, USA, for a number of
years had always and meticulously maintained his contacts and links with
his U.S.  colleagues.

Ever since day one he had promised Paul and I that he would arrange for us
to have our own E-Mail accounts, like any other Commodore engineer.  This
way, we too could have first-hand access to the life and energy of
Commodore R&D head quarters in West Chester.  And fully participate in the
creative processes which made the Amiga what it is.

As the months went past it slowly became clear that Steve was skillfully
managing to avoid this promise and in so doing, completely and deliberately
isolate us from West Chester HQ.  We were never allowed to phone across the
Atlantic to talk directly with management or senior engineers there.  Yet
he spent thousands of dollars on daytime cross-Atlantic direct dial-ins to
the Commodore VAX mainframe to read his private E-Mail.  Slowly, he would
start to use this planned isolation to his selfish advantage.

No one seemed to know Paul or I even existed except for a handful of
managers who had authorized our hiring.

When the rumours of a project abort persisted, Steve initially tried to
convince Commodore that we should all at least complete the project, as we
were so close to finishing.

Ned McCook, a West Chester manager flew over and had a meeting with Steve
in London.  Steve refused to have us present at that meeting, going flat
against my explicit request.  Yet again he was blocking us from any say or,
at least as importantly, any first-hand information.  I knew what I would
have tried to convince Ned of (the need for all team members to retain
their jobs and even relocation to the States), but was afraid Steve would
have a very different agenda.

On Steve's return from London I knew I had been right: the "surprise"
outcome of the meeting being that Steve would be keeping his job as
engineer while Paul and I would lose ours.

There was something seriously rotten in the Commodore Postscript "team". 
What had previously been a genuinely friendly and open gang of 3, turned
into one hypocritical cast of 2 against 1.  Steve Beats was screwing his
two junior team-members, big time, and we knew it.  Yet we couldn't vent
any anger or opinions.  We were three in a room, 5 days a week, with our
backs towards each other - luckily.

Morale in the project plummeted.  Even Steve's.  Officially we were to
simply "clean up the code", and close down the shop.  The last 2 months
were pretty sad.  We didn't do any work, and I took all my entitled
holidays to go to Nepal for 3 weeks.  Going to the office to do nothing
wasn't my idea of a productive human life.

Months earlier engineers in West Chester had received raises.  They were
fairly liberally distributed and didn't seem very performance related, so
Paul and I were eager to get ours too, before we would be kicked out of the
company.  If anyone was entitled to a raise, we had to be at the head of
the queue: up to the point where the rumours had started, we were doing a
first-class job.

As ever before, we had to try and get these things sorted out _via_ Steve
Beats.  We had no direct contact with any departments in the U.S.  or with
Commodore U.K.  in Maidenhead; the people who, ironically, did pay us our
salaries.

At this point maybe I should paste one of the letters I managed to find on
Steve's computer all those years ago...  here it is for all you to see:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Ned,

I figured it would be best to give you this list of things via EMail rather
than trying to do it all over the phone since I'd probably forget things.

I've spoken with Lipstone's lawyers (the people we I lease the office from)
and they are not at all interested in trading office furniture for early
lease termination.  The best I've been able to do is get them down to one
years rent.  They initially wanted the remainder of the lease but I don't
believe they really expected to get it.  Anyway, one year of rent works out
to 2860 pounds.  Since I have just paid this quarters rent which starts on
December 1st I can probably get that included as part of the one year
payment (providing I'm out before the next quarter is due in March).  Is
this OK?  I guess we could sic the CBM Maidenhead lawyers on them and try
to get the amount down some more but a friend of mine who's a commercial
lawyer says that I've got "a pretty good deal" as it is.

This now means I've got the furniture, phone/fax etc to deal with too.  I
got the impression when we met in Heathrow that you really didn't want to
deal with it or care about it.  The fact that all expenses had gone down as
"stamps" implied that everything had already been depreciated down to zero
value.  Maybe I read you wrong on this.  What should I do ?  I can sell the
furniture to a second hand dealer (though you won't get much money from
them) or I can get the Maidenhead folks to pick it up along with all the
computers and stuff.  I'm going to steal a couple of hard drives and tapes
etc.  for my own Amiga system but there is going to be a hell of a lot of
240 volt equipment laying around here.  Shall I just call someone in
Maidenhead and tell them to send a truck and pick it all up?  They are
likely to bill you for this of course.  Alternatively, I can sell the
computers through a local computer store (second hand stuff) and let you
guys have the cash.  The folks at the local store would be willing to take
everything and sell it for a "nominal" commision.  This would certainly be
the easiest solution.

Can Laurence and Paul keep the systems they have at home ?  They each have
an A3000 and monitor.

My pay raise came through OK and I should be getting it in my Christmas
paycheck, thanks.  However, I remember that you said Paul and Larry would
still be getting thier pay raises (also backdated to August) and you would
be sending me the forms to do thier reviews.  I suspect it's a bit late to
do this now since they are both going to be leaving next month.  I did tell
them they would be getting thier raises but have started to back-pedal on
that.  I think this will be OK providing they are paid the month-in-hand
that they worked when they started here.  I spoke with Geraldine Meyer
regarding this (and whether it would be paid) and she indicated that
payment of this month in hand is discretionary !?!?  I was really surprised
but it appears that she is told by TPTB whether it should be paid or not. 
Anyway, Geraldine will require instructions from you to terminate Paul and
Larrys employment and I guess you also dictate the terms of termination. 
Larry is taking all of his vacation starting on December 20th (he booked
this several months ago) but Paul is saving his vacation and wants to be
paid for it when he leaves instead.  Is this possible?

I'm afraid the PostScript project isn't going very well at all.  It's
mostly a motivation thing but we are having to fix up some mistakes and
alter some code.  I'm just trying to make sure we have a maintainable
system at the moment (ensuring I can maintain Paul and Larry's stuff that
is) and I keep finding bad bits.  I'll be giving a detailed report on this
to Allen, he can fill you in on this.

                     --stuff snipped--

That's all I can think of for now.  Looking forward to your reply.

    Steve
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apart from the snipped text, which contained things irrelevant to this
article, this is a byte-perfect copy of his letter he E-Mailed to Ned
McCook, the manager he convinced to let him keep his job but ditch mine and
Paul's.

The datestamp on this file is :

    Ned     5818 ----rwed 12-Dec-91 16:43:04 

The letter clearly shows Steve Beats LIED to everyone under the sun:

 a) his team (Paul and I)
 b) his own manager

He lied to us about the raises we were promised, but never got in the end
(unlike his, our Christmas was a very bitter one).  He lied to us about
some worthless equipment Paul and I had hoped to share among all (if
Commodore would have agreed): a dusty CDTV, dirty 3000s, loose hard disks,
a tape streamer, that kind of stuff.  Instead he grabbed it for himself.

He dirtied our names and lied about our first-rate work we had done.  There
were no problems with the code.  ("fix up some mistakes", "ensuring I can
maintain Paul and Larry's stuff that is" - all lies).

The letter also highlights some other interesting things...  like the
funding for the project under the heading of "stamps".  It would be
hilarious if it wasn't for the fact it's probably the truth.

Regarding equipment, it was standard practice within Commodore that
software engineers received a (top of the range) Amiga "just like that",
very soon after starting.  The Amiga 3000 I'm writing this article on is
that same machine...  (the only Amiga I ever bought is the first A1000 to
enter Belgium in 1986).

Well, as Steve mentioned in the letter, he asked Ned whether Paul and I
"could keep" our machines and monitors.  I never managed to spy the answer
to this letter but anyway: nearly a week before the final day "at work",
Steve told Paul and I to return our home machines because Commodore was
"recalling" them.  By that time Paul and I knew that Steve (and Commodore)
were completely untrustworthy, so we just acted upset but as if we were
going to comply.

Instead, that evening we put a plan into action that was going to reverse
the tables on Steve.  Late at night we entered the office and removed all
expensive machines: the laser printer, the network server and our two
working Amigas.  We stored everything in the basement, so that if things
got out of hand and the police was called in, we could not be accused of
actually stealing anything since nothing was removed from the premises....

The next day Steve came in and we confronted him with his months of secret
back-stabbing.

Now, anyone who knows Steve Beats knows he's a muscular guy, short but very
muscular.  Since the pecking order between Paul and I meant I had lead the
accusations, Steve suddenly and violently knocked me against a wall and
demanded the equipment back or threatened to knock me out.  I had to be
careful how I would phrase my next sentence.  I didn't want to end up in
hospital.  Afraid but not feeling defeated I demanded in return that he
guarantees that we could keep our home machines.  Furiously he backed off
and reluctantly agreed.  Only then did we tell him, with a sense of
victory, where the equipment was hidden.  Paul and I left the room while
Steve Beats went down to the basement to find all the stuff packed and
hidden.  We never heard anything more from him, from Commodore, or
..Postscript on the Amiga.

Paul and I are still good friends, despite subsequently having gone
different ways.

                           Break the ZIP Barrier
  Frank Zndorff                        F.Zuendorff@ernie.mi.uni-koeln.de
===========================================================================

It's no mystery anymore, the SCSI version of iomegas ZIP-Drive is running
fine with Amiga computers equiped with a SCSI-hostadapter.  But a new
aspect for a ZIP-Drive is the feature to exchange Data on PC-formatted
medias.  What advantages brings it for you?

Now you can swap a large amount of data (like mods, pics, 3d-objects etc.)
without carrying a large container of floppy disks or moving your baby to
the next PC.

How does it works?

Quite simple.  You habe to create a working mountfile using Cross-Dos.
This mountfile is listed below and the only thing you have to do, is to fix
it for your hostadapter.  Okay here comes the file:

----- 8< ------------------------------------------------------------------

/* Mountfile for MS-DOS formatted ZIP-Media

--------------------------------------------------------------------- >8 --

A copy of this file can be found in the ZIP-directory included with this
report.  The only thing you have to do, is to drag the "PCZIP"-icon and put
it into the "storage/dosdrivers" directory of your boot-partition.  Now
load your favourite editor and perform the fixes I'm discribing now.  First
move the cursor into the line starting with "device =".  Exchange the
following text with the name of your hostadapters device-driver name.  It
you don't know exactly the name, please check it out in the hostadapters
manual.  For example a A2091-user has to change the line in "device =
scsi.device".

The second step is to choose the right unit-number.  Please move the cursor
one line down starting with "unit =".  You can find the unit-switch on the
back-side of the drive.  If the switch is pointing to number five for
example, you have to put in the following line "unit = 5".  Now save the
mountfile.  That's all.

After mounting the file, you can put in a PC-formatted media und handle it
like any other device.

                     Super Skidmarks Review Correction
===========================================================================

[Looks like we made a mistake on the Super Skidmarks review.  Steven
Pearson (Steven.Pearson@p12.f563.n250.z2.fidonet.org) writes:]

Hi Jason,

I've just been reading your review of Super Skidmarks in AR3.22

You mentioned that the Hard Drive Installer never surfaced.

I registered SkidMarks2 with Acid, and in August I recieved the first ssue
of Skidmarks racer magazine.  On the disk Were some files for making cars
in Imagine.  Some new tracks they wanted colouring in and a New HD aware
version of the Game Plus Track Disk Installer.

It does exist!

[So, I should clarify.  There IS a hard-drive installer, but it's not
shipped with the software. -Jason]

  Paul Idol                                     76375.1776@compuserve.com
===========================================================================

I'm sick and tired of floppies.  I have a couple hundred of them, probably
not as many as plenty of other people, but enough to drive me nuts.  
They're always developing read-write errors, getting crushed by
steam-rollers, or accidentally being used by well-meaning fools as cold
drink coasters.  I have no idea how much data I've lost over the years to
floppy disks, but it's a lot.

So the desire was growing in me to buy a removable hard drive, or maybe an
optical drive, or something, anyway.  (It's always something, isn't it?)
But they were always too expensive and too slow for me to justify buying
one to myself.  Until recently.

Iomega, and then shortly thereafter, Syquest, both released cheap new
removable drives this year--and I mean cheap!  They're less than twice as
expensive as floppy drives!  It seemed that salvation was at hand.
However, trying to find hard information on which to base a purchasing
decision proved to be difficult.  Mac people apparently almost
overwhelmingly prefer the Zip, but they weren't much help at explaining
why.  (Maybe that's reason enough to stay away from the Zip...  <G>) Even
Amigans seemed to prefer the Zip, though by a more slender margin.  And the
magazines were rather ambiguous, praising both drives, though they too
favored the Zip.

I, on the other hand, fusty curmudgeon that I am, was rather skeptical.  
On paper, it seems that the EZ135 wins in most categories: it's about twice
as fast (in fact, at almost 2MB/sec, it's the fastest removable media hard
drive ever), its cartridges offer 32MB more formatted space each, the drive
can be set to any SCSI ID (unlike the Zip, which can only be set to 5 or
6), and it has standard centronics connectors on the back instead of db25
connectors that require hard-to-find adaptor cables and make it a PITA to
add or remove devices from your SCSI chain.

So what, if anything, is better about the Zip?  Well, it looks cooler, it
has a nicer load/eject mechanism, and the media are a little smaller--and a
little more durable, or so I'm told.  The other oft-cited advantage of the
Zip, that it's lighter, is of dubious value in my opinion.  The Zip, at
about 1 pound, just feels flimsy to me, like I could accidentally crush it
with my hand while picking it up.  The EZ135, at about 2 pounds, isn't all
that earth-shakingly heavy, and it feels much more solid.  It's not
anything like twice as big as the Zip, either--more like 20% larger, at a
guess.  But don't take my word on durability.  I just made some totally
unscientific palm-of-the-hand tests.

In my opinion, the one really annoying thing about the EZ135 is its
brain-dead archaic load/eject mechanism.  In that respect, the Zip works
just like a floppy drive: you push in a disk, it appears in a few seconds;
you hit the eject button, it pops out.  To load an EZ135, you have to push
the cartridge all the way in, then slide a lever all the way over to the
right and wait up to 10 seconds while the drive spins up.  Not as nice as
the Zip, but hardly the end of the world.  To eject, however, you have to
hit a button on the front of the drive, wait for the cartridge to spin down
and the lever to pop back a bit, and then move the lever back to the left.
There is no mechanical assistance, so the last quarter of the lever's
travel is quite difficult, and I was initially afraid that I was going to
break something.  But finally, reluctantly, the cartridge slides out just
far enough to grab and pull out the rest of the way.

So, which to choose...  To make a long story short, I bought the EZ135, as
you may have guessed.  :) So far, I'm quite happy with it.  I transferred
my collection of archives onto a cartridge--or rather that part of the
collection which hadn't been lost to read/write errors and the like.   I
made an emergency boot/recovery cartridge with Diavolo all set up and ready
to go.  And I'm slowly copying all my original program disks over to
another cartridge.  After all, how much point is there really to making
floppy copies of those disks when the copies are probably more likely to
fail than the originals!?

PROBLEMS

I've noticed one vaguely annoying quirk about the drive.  Periodically, for
no apparent reason, it churns for a couple seconds as though something is
accessing it.  I ran VirusChecker...  no viruses.  I guess it's just some
SCSI thing.

And I've had one genuine problem.  I can't seem to get AFS to work with the
drive.  I can't prepare an AFS cartridge from scratch, and any AFS
cartridge that I make with ffs2afs disappears after I reboot.  I don't know
where the problem lies.  If anyone has any ideas, please email me!  FLD,
perhaps because of the holidays, hasn't gotten back to me.  :(

HARDWARE AND INSTALLATION

Well, down to the nitty-gritty.  My system is as follows: an A3000 desktop
with OS3.1 in ROM, a WarpEngine 3040, 16MB of fast RAM, a RetinaZ3 running
CyberGraphX, and AFS Pro 2.2.  I installed the EZ135 simply by attaching it
to my external tape drive, which is hooked up to the A3000's native SCSI
controller, with a standard centronics-centronics SCSI cable.   Then I used
HDToolBox to prepare and format a cartridge, SCSIMounter to mount it, and I
was off!

CONCLUSION

The EZ135 is available for about $229 versus the Zip's $199 (both models
appear to be coming out in cheaper internal versions, but you lose drive
portability) but I think the extra $30 is worth it.  And prices are always
falling.  Cartridges, just like Zip disks, cost $20 singly.

In the end, I guess the best argument in favor of the Zip is that more
people have it.  It came out sooner and looks cooler, so you'll be able to
swap disks with more people.  But to that argument I say, "Come on, you're
using an Amiga!"

In conclusion, all I can really say is that my 525MB tape drive is starting
to look mighty small...

                          UUDecoding Amiga Report
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

     4.  Please send us your article in ASCII format.

                  Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users
===========================================================================

                The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
          -------------------------------------------------------

Portal is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-service online SIG
(Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users. We promise, and
WE DELIVER ongoing & aggressive Amiga support!

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in many ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA high-speed modems (you pay for the phone call
if it's not local), or though any SprintNet or Compu$erve indial anywhere
(with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell service!  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help, and you can easily customize
it for your favorite terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1000 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
      once, of any size, with one command.
 * Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, Elastic
      Reality (ASDG), Soft-Logik, Apex Publishing, and others.
 * 40 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 10,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.
 * Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
      related and get quick replies from the experts.
 * Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, AMosaic, LightWave, EGS,
      OpalVision & others feed right into the Zone message bases.  Read
      months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with them.
 * FREE unlimited Internet Email with 5 meg of free storage.
 * A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.
      You can run Amiga Mosaic through your shell and explore the
      vast World Wide Web!
 * Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which you can read
      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine.
 * Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
      never worry "Ooops... Am I paying for this area?" again!
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  And you get FREE unlimited
      usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
      email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
 * Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
      at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
