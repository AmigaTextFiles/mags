Hey!  Guess what!

No, I don't have a new 4000T on my desk just yet.  But I DO have a paying
job in the Amiga field.  Actually, two of them.

This summer I spent a couple of weekends in Canada (as those of you who
have read my show reports will know.)  Wonder Computers figured pretty
prominently at those shows, and along the course of the shows, I found that
I was being offered a job as Promotional Director for Wonder Computers,
Incorporated.  I could work at home as a sort of consultant, set my own
hours, keep doing just what I'm doing for Amiga Report, and help an
expanding Amiga company.

It sounded pretty good to me.  So I took the job.  So, here I am, Editor in
Chief of Amiga Report who also happens to be Promotional Director of Wonder
Computers, Inc.  And an assistant conference moderator on BIX.  (I could
have mentioned that a few months ago when I got the job, but it never
seemed relevant.  But while I'm on this kick, I may as well lay everything
out on the table.)

Mark Habinski, CEO of Wonder, and I made Amiga Report's relationship to
Wonder pretty clear.  In short, there is none.  Yes, that's right, Amiga
Report and my employers have nothing to do with each other.  And there's a
good reason for that.

When Mark (and Joanne Dow, head moderator of the Amiga Exchange on BIX)
approached me, it was my work on AR that brought them to me in the first
place.  They must have liked something, and I'd like to think it was my
ability to be very open and honest, and keep it that way.  And I have, and
will continue, to keep it that way.

In short, the only noticable effect on AR will be the fact that, since more
Wonder Computers press releases are being written, they'll be showing up
here, as do any industry press releases I get my hands on.  It's just that
in this case I'll be writing a lot of them.  Just in case anybody might get
the wrong idea, I won't be reviewing any WCi-released software.  I would
personally feel comfortable doing it, but wouldn't want to generate any
suspicion.  It will be passed along to reviewers who know better than to
temper their judgement. :)

Wonder felt that they would be well served having me onboard for this very,
uh, interesting time in the Amiga market.  I thought it would be
interesting being onboard.  Similarly, Joanne thought I would be
interesting to have around BIX, and I'm interested in hanging around.  My
first love, as it were, is Amiga Report, and doing the job I've been doing
HERE for the past 2 years.  I have only my record, and my promise, to
convince you that a little prosperity (we're not talking about full-time
jobs here) does not breed evil.

<sigh> That was refreshing.  Now, to business!

"Better late than never" seems to be the theme recently.  All of a sudden,
the floodgates of news from Amiga Technologies have been opened a bit.  We
have news and interviews coming from the UK, Switzerland, and Italy.  North
America actually has a distributor, but our Australian cousins are still
shut out.

When I called Ed Goff's office to discuss the North American distribution
situation, I didn't make it past his secretary (he asked her to talk with
me.) Essentially, I know just as much as they do right now, as both they
and SMG, the North American distributor, are waiting on official
announcement of the distribution situation from the home office in
Bensheim.  And so we wait...

Read on, and you'll see that AT has quite a travel agenda planned.  A pity
it's all in Europe, but at least it's a press conference.

Enjoy.

Jason:

Concerning your report on the Amiga Convention 95 in Montreal.  Valley Soft
gave out over 100 catalogues at this show.  We had another 100 available
for anyone who requested them as well as business cards.  We were invited
back to future shows so we hope to meet you again.  You were at our booth I
believe and we did offer a catalogue to you.  We were located just to the
left of Obys Computers and had our table piled high with software.  We,
like the other dealers that were there were there for the explosure as well
as to show Amiga owners that there is still support for their systems.

We have been Amiga users since the first A500's arrived in Canada and
dealers since 1992.  We would appreciate being added to your list of
dealers as we do ship all over North America and have over 500 different
Amiga game titles IN STOCK!  Our address is:

Subject: The future of the Amiga

At last I got to reading AR316.  In the reader mail deparment, Joe Brewin
wrote:

  I'm afraid ESCOM's only interest is squeezing the technology for all they
  can get from it and then tossing the rind in the garbage to be hauled away
  to the nearest landfill.

I hope he is wrong, and it seems to me that he is.  Of course, ESCOM is
interested in getting all they can from the Amiga, but they're doing it
with good intentions.  They won't try to shove a dead animal at people, but
if people do buy the Amiga, Escom seems to be willing to continue its
development.  They have some plans for simple enhancements, and are talking
about a future RISC Amiga, which seems encouraging.

And Escom does seem to try to make the Amiga a better choice for people
looking for a computer.  I was annoyed with the high price, initially, but
after reading in AR what will be bundled with the Amiga, I understand where
this price comes from.  It's the first time that the Amiga is bundled with
a full productivity suite, and this should certainly show it in a new way.
Together with the bundled multimedia software and games, you certainly get
a comprehensive software bundle with the Amiga.

With a little (or, hopefully, a lot of) marketing, and the help of Amiga
enthusiasts, maybe people will actually get the idea that everything you
want done by a home computer can be done by the Amiga.  At the very least,
I hope that there are a lot of people who still want to buy an Amiga,
enough of them to convince Escom that working on more advanced Amigas is
worth while.

From: RJMARIER@STTHOMAS.EDU
Subject: Hello, howdie, and all that good stuff

Yes, I did buy my Amiga new.  However before I could send in my
registration cards, Commodore went out of business.  I had only had my
compputer a month at most, but I'm sure it was less.

The problems I'm haveing are in several areas:

[ I ]

Video Problems:  
- RF and Composite send no signal at all.
- The main RGB video works, but has several problems.  After haveing my
Amiga on, say an hour, I start getting lines that flicker on the screen.
They are random spots on the screen, but usually there will always be some
up by the title bar area of the screen and when you use the menus.  When I
pull down a menu the selections usually have lines flickering through the
selections and extend out of the menu.   When this flickering problem
becomes more numerous on the menus, it is possible to see a "reflection" of
a menu choice to the right of the menu.  What I mean is say on the main
workbench screen, I hold the right mouse button down and got up to the menu
that says TOOLS.  Well, then it displays the menu selections, in this case
it is ResetWB.  The ResetWB will have lines flickering through it and out
onto the main part of the screen.  ON that main part of the screen next to
the menu selection, you can see ResetWB being reflected.  I've tried
programs like GrabIFF and QuickGrab to take a Snapshot of the screen,
however when I display the snapshot, it looks perfectly normal.

[ II ]

Video/Memory ?
- There is also another problems with random lines on my screen.   These
are little black lines scattered in differant places across the screen.
Some are actual lines, dots, and dashes When I've used screen grabbing
programs like above, I do capture these lines in the picture.  Therefore,
this might be a memory mapping problem.

[ III ]

Serial Problems:
- Basically, when I try to Download/Upload (with my fast memory turned on)
I get a lon of errors.  They come one right after another.  This problem
happens 70 to 90 % of the time however, it doesn't always happen.  When I
deactivate the fast ram, that will sometimes fix the problem, but again not
always.

I've taken my Amiga to an Amiga store, where I've swapped differant
accelerator cards, SIMMS, deleted and reinstalled software, tried differant
cables, and everything else.  However, nothing ever seems to work.

My setup is: An Amiga 1200, with a Microbotics 50 Mhz '030, and a 4 meg
SIMM.  I usually run my screen display in DBLNTSC mode.  I've got a 200
watt power supply.

I've tried my best so far to figure out what is wrong with this thing, but
myself and the people I've had check this thing out can not figure it out
either. 

Thanks much,

A patient (but frustrated) Amiga Owner,

               Robert Marier

you want the WBStartup-drawer, the User-Startup script or both to be
disabled.

This means, you can bootup a "clean" Workbench, without any programs in
WBStartup or User-Startup executed!  And also a new shell-window can be
opened for changing things befor executing the startup-sequence. 
(Sourcecode is included.)

NEW FEATURES
    Before any key checks are performed ShadowStart checks if the
    SYS: partition is currently being validated.
    If yes, Shadowstart waits 3 seconds and checks the disk
    state again.
    When the validation is finished, ShadowStart automatically
    continues with its normal execution.
    The main effect of this feature is that startup execution will
    be delayed until the SYS: partition is validated
    (no more disk-trashing on startup).
    The validation check is always performed, if the activation-key
    is pressed or not.

FUTURE
    Ideas and suggestions are always welcome!

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
    Two version of ShadowStart are included,
    one for Kick/WB 3.1 and one for Kick/WB 2.0+.

DESCRIPTION

    HTML-Heaven is a suite of _four_ programs intended to make the
    creation and maintenance of WWW (HTML) pages easy. The programs
    in the suite interface with your favorite editor (providing it 
    supports text insertion via ARexx) to provide you with a very
    comfortable environment. Now inserting HTML commands is as simple
    as point and click. This is the upgrade from version 1.1 with a
    host of exiting new features.

NEW FEATURES

    Version 1.2 has all the features of version 1.1. Plus:
    * Support for five new editors. MEmacs (thanks to Ellis Pritchard)
      AME, PolyEd, SkoEd and EdWord v5.(Thanks to Martin Reddy)
    * Improved scripts for a number of editors now support blocks the
      same way that the TTX script does. (Yes, CygnusEd as well)
      Just mark a block and hit eg. the <B></B> gadget in HTML-Heaven.  
    * Support for character entities so you can now embed special 
      characters like ®, æ and þ for example.
    * The brunt of the new NetScape extensions to the HTML language.
      Including the BackGround= tag.
    * Optional Edit Tag requester allows you to edit outgoing tag before
      it is sent to the editor. Useful for entering URL's etc. in tags.  
    * The documentation is now also available in HTML format. And can be 
      viewed online via WWW on http://www.iaehv.nl/users/paul/index.html. 
    * iso2html (simply convert ISO Latin-1 characters to HTML entities)
      tool by Christian Ruetgers is now included in the distribution. 

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    HTML-Heaven requires:
    * Workbench 2.04 or above.
    * ARexx (bundled with Workbench 2.04 and above.)
    * Around 1MB of free memory.
    * About 300KB of floppy or harddisk space. (installing the entire
      suite and docs.)

DISTRIBUTABILITY

    The unregistered version is freely distributable if done in a non-
    commercial way.
    The registered version and it's personal keyfile are *NOT* freely
    distributable.

    This suite of programs is copyright 1994, 95 by Paul Kolenbrander.

OTHER

    To encourage users to register, (I'd like to get some return for
    all this effort I have put into creating the suite.) the freely
    distributable versions does not support ToolTypes/parameters and
    will not supply on-line help. Furthermore a 'reminder' requester
    appears on exiting any of the four programs comprising the suite.
    The unregistered versions will also not allow more than 5 ARexx
    commands per session. They'll keep functioning, but ignore any
    further ARexx commands given by the user as it has unloaded it's
    ARexx Host.

According to Gilles Bourdin of Amiga Technologies, Service Management
Group, the company that provided warranty service for Amigas in the US,
will have non-exclusive North American distribution for the remainder of
1995.

Maxximum Video Creations, a US dealer, has begun advertising Amiga 4000Ts
for mid-October delivery, at a price of $2700, with the full Amiga 1200
software pack (including Scala MM300, per the 1200 HD bundle), a one year
SMG warranty, a 1 gig SCSI hard drive, and a double-density floppy.
Apparently, Amiga Technologies was unable to secure high-density floppy
drives for this release of the machine.

PRESS RELEASE

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    September 8, 1995

PRESS CONTACT: Ellen Kazmaier

tel: 314-256-9595; fax: 314-256-9595


SOFT-LOGIK 10th ANNIVERSARY:

(St.  Louis) Soft-Logik Publishing(tm) will celebrate its tenth anniversary
on September 11th.  In an industry where companies appear and disappear
seemingly overnight, Soft-Logik products have become fixtures on the
shelves of Amiga and Atari computer owners.

Soft-Logik introduced Publishing Partner for Atari in 1986, and it was
hailed as the most powerful desktop publishing program of its time.  The
industry's leading magazine called it a "knockout program".  Publishing
Partner grew into PageStream and was released for Amiga in 1989.  It soon
became the number one selling DTP program for both Amiga and Atari
computers.

In 1994, Soft-Logik released PageStream 3.0 for Amiga, a completely new
program which set a new standard for features and value.  Version 3.1 is
scheduled for release later this year and will be a free update for owners
of PageStream 3.0.

Today, Soft-Logik sells a wide range of Amiga software, including
PageStream and TypeSmith.  Soft-Logik is the exclusive North American
publisher of Digita's Wordworth, Organizer and Datastore.

THE DECADE AHEAD:

New versions of PageStream for Macintosh and Windows are in development.
The Macintosh and PowerMacintosh versions will be released later this year,
and the Windows95 and WindowsNT version is scheduled for the second quarter
of next year.  A new Amiga version is also planned for next year.

Soft-Logik president Deron Kazmaier said "PageStream has become the #1
Amiga and Atari DTP program by being the best program available.  The
Macintosh and Windows markets have entrenched market leaders, but our
extensive experience as a pioneer in the DTP field will help us succeed
where recent Mac DTP newcomers have failed."


PAGESTREAM3 AMIGA: NEW PRICE

Soft-Logik Publishing is pleased to announce that it has lowered the
upgrade price for PageStream3.  The standard upgrade price from previous
versions has been changed from $135 to $95.  A new $60 option is being
added for those on a budget.

The $60 version does not include a printed manual or Pantone(R) color
libraries, both of which are included with the standard $95 version.
PageStream3 includes the most comprehensive AmigaGuide help system of any
Amiga program, so it's easy to use even without a printed manual.  Printed
startup instructions are included.

This price change will help increase PageStream3's user-base so that
Soft-Logik can continue development of this important Amiga program.  A
continuous stream of new users is essential, and the new upgrade price will
allow more people than before to use the latest version.

Owners of PageStream 1.0 to 2.2 Amiga, excluding the new SE version, are
eligible for the new upgrade price.

Purchasers of PageStream 3.0 will receive a free upgrade to 3.1 when it is
released later this year.


PAGESTREAM 2.2 RETURNS:

To celebrate its 10th anniversary, Soft-Logik is re-releasing PageStream
2.2, the best-selling desktop publishing program for Amiga and Atari
computers.  Bundled with a new 90 page manual, PageStream 2.2 SE will
probably top the sales charts again at its incredible new price.
PageStream 2.2, which originally had a suggested retail price of $299.95
will now sell for just $39.  The new lower price will help bring desktop
publishing to people who couldn't previously afford a professional quality
DTP program.

Readers of Britain's "CU Amiga" magazine will receive a free copy of
PageStream 2.2 with their October issue cover disk.  They can purchase the
full program disk set with all of its fonts and the manual for 24.95 pounds
Sterling.

PageStream 2.2 SE is the perfect choice for owners of older Amiga and Atari
computers.  Its minimum system requirements are 1.5MB of RAM, 1 floppy
drive (2 for Atari), and AmigaDOS 1.3 or any version of TOS.

Purchasers of PageStream 2.2 SE Amiga who wish to upgrade in the future can
apply the entire purchase price towards the purchase of PageStream3.

PageStream 2.2 SE for Amiga and Atari will be available in late October.
Orders are being accepted now.


WORDWORTH: MORE AFFORDABLE THAN EVER

Digita is working on an exciting new version of Wordworth that will include
style tags, ARexx, true footnotes, improved tables, faster editing and
more.

There's no reason to wait for the next version because Soft-Logik has
lowered the North American price of the current version.  The Soft-Logik
direct price for owners of other Soft-Logik programs has been lowered from
$120 to $99.  The new price at which anybody can order direct, and the
suggested street price, has been lowered from $135 to $110.  This is a
limited time price!

WORDWORTH 3.1 SE: NEW PRODUCT

Not everybody needs all the features of Wordworth 3.1, that's why Digita
created Wordworth SE.  Amiga Format gave it their Gold Award and said it
has "all the best bits of 3.1 at a bargain price." The SE version has been
optimized to run on a 2MB Amiga with AmigaDOS 2.04 or better, with or
without a hard drive.

Wordworth 3.1 SE will be available in North America in October at the
incredibly low price of just $49.  This rock-bottom price will help
everybody afford this popular word processor.  Owners of 3.1 SE can upgrade
to the full version of 3.1 for just $59.  Orders for SE are being accepted
now.

THE SE BUNDLE!

Now Amiga owners can get the best desktop publisher and the best word
processor for the price of a new game!  For just $69, Amiga owners can get
PageStream 2.2 SE and Wordworth 3.1 SE together.  This is the best Amiga
software value today, and is sure to be a popular combination in the months
ahead.  Orders for the SE bundle are being accepted now.


ORGANIZER: NEW PRICE

Soft-Logik has also decreased the North American price of Organizer. 
Organizer has been one of Soft-Logik's top-selling programs since its
introduction in the spring of this year.  Owners of other Soft-Logik
applications can order it directly from Soft-Logik for just $75, while
other customers can order it for $85.


EVANGELIZE!

Wordworth owners can save money by getting friends to purchase Wordworth
3.1.  If your friends mention you when ordering, they will pay our best
price which we normally reserve for owners of Soft-Logik programs.  In
return, we'll give you $20 off your next Soft-Logik application purchase.

PageStream3 owners can save money by getting friends to upgrade to
PageStream3, or to purchase PageStream3.  If your friends mention you when
ordering, they will pay our best price which we normally reserve for owners
of Soft-Logik programs.  In return, we'll give you $25 off your next
Soft-Logik application purchase.

I would like to take this oppurtunity to introduce Native_Network, the
Native North American news and Information network.  Native_Network is a
computer network dedicated to news, issues and cultural information
regarding North America's Indigenous populations.  This network is geared
toward any Native American/Canadian with access to a modem.

Although Native_Network was designated for and by Native-Americans,
non-natives with genuine concerns and interests in Native affairs are
welcomed to join in the numerous areas which most bulletin boards (BBS)
carry.  (see ad above)

Native_Network provides a wide range of topics and areas of interest.   For
the serious minded, you can find out the latest in Native legal affairs on
Nations battling the dominant society over concerns such as treaty rights,
land rights and international law or find out about current conditions on
reservatons and historical perspectives.

If you find the Net lacks something, please inform the local Sysop (system
operator of the bulletin board/BBS) you're calling.  Also call back from
time to time, as new things are added quite often.

For those looking for cultural material, Native_Network offers discussions
and information sharing/relating to tribal language(s), native stories,
poetry and legends.  You can also hookup and find out about upcoming
pow-wows, celebrations and gatherings and conferences.

Looking for resources!  Native_Network can help!  From education and grant
oppurtunities to listings and business development, Native_Network provides
direct links to trading, bartering and programs being developed to help
tribes help each other while becoming self-sufficient and increasing
self-pride.

Naturally, there are Conferences covering everything from Arts & Crafts to
political exchanges and cultural beliefs.  Informaton is available on
issues from the U.S., Canada, South America, Australia, Africa, and Europe.
Engage in intelligent and educational conversations with knowlegeable
people who not only know Native affairs, but also live them every day.

Native_Network is also a wonderful choice for schools, universities and the
media.  The current news and information is a welcomed addition to Native
studies because it provides an up-to-date of current affairs and what is
happening in Indian Country.  Outdated school books and primers can't
compare to today's news...today.

Native_Network DEPENDS ON YOU!  NATIVE-NET is also looking for new
informationfrom Indian Nations not currently using our network.  The more
informationand nations that utilize this network, the more productive and
informed our Native peoples can be.  Sharing information, relating to
cultural, legal matters, education, etc., will help to unite Native people
and provide a wider base of information to draw from.  Any ideas or
suggestions on this matter are greatly appreciated.

The Native_Network network is growing all the time and more and more
information is coming over the echos.  From Alaska to Florida, California
to New Jersey, Natives news is happening all the time.  For other BBS
around the country, see our Native BBS Phone Listing.  We have hopes of it
to double in the next six months with the help of the users.

If you are interested in hooking up with Native_Network, call our BBS (see
our ad above). 

ou will need a computer and modem of 1200 to 14,400 baud to call in.   Any
Amiga, IBM compatible PC or MacIntosh computers are accepted.

NATIVE-NETETWORK is coming in from Kanahwake Native Net Computer Systems
located in Kanahwake Mohawk Territory (Frosty Deere is the SysOp at this
Location).

NOTE: Native_Network is NOT an INTERNET based network.  IT is it's own
network corelating the reserves and other communities around the world.

@node NEWS7 "IPISA '95"
@toc NEWS

The Italian Amiga community will meet on November 18th, 1995, at the fifth
annual IPISA conference. IPISA stands for "Incontro dei Programmatori
Italiani per lo Sviluppo su Amiga" (Italian Programmers' Meeting for
Amiga Development).

IPISA is an open meeting (advance registration is required for a small
fee) focussing on non-commercial products, projects and ideas, and on the
distribution of high-quality information and advanced software tools.

It is also a chance for (usually isolated) novice users to talk each other
and to consult qualified and experienced Amiga users. IPISA is (and has
been) a valuable occasion for small Italian enterprises working with the
Amiga to do some head-hunting and to arrange professional talks with
usually unreachable people, such as magazines chief editors and
journalists, freelance programmers, etc.

In the past, IPISA was an opportunity for Commodore Italia to introduce
new products and to answer questions on its policies. Commodore Italia has
always supported the IPISA conference by helping in the organization
phase, by lending computers and sample products, and by participating in
the conference through its representatives.

Amiga Technologies GmbH has been contacted but they were unable to confirm
or deny their presence.

About past IPISA conferences

As we said, this is the fifth conference; the first and second ones were
held in Modena and were organized by three former Amiga developers. Even
without press coverage, the conferences attracted 90 participants.

Since 1993 the organization was taken over by a large group of developers
and users living in Milan. The '93 edition was attended by more than 150
people, grown up to 220 in 1994.


About this year's conference

IPISA'95 will be held Saturday November 18, 1995, in the Conference Hall
of the Centro Universitario ISU (via Valvassori Peroni 21 Milano).

Here is a tentative list of the talks and papers (unless otherwise
specified both are in Italian).

Manuel Lemos - Upper Design (Madrid, Spain)

Chris's Button Strip V1.5 : HTML Editing For Final Writer 


I don't know how many people out there use Final Writer extensively,
but I have developed an HTML "editor" for use with it, using the user
menu, button strips, Arexx scripts and text clips.

I use it to produce HTML for Web authoring, aswell as converting
ascii text into html.

The system works by taking whatever has been selected by the mouse, 
and placing html code either side of the selection.

If nothing is selected, then the html code appears, and the cursor is 
placed *within* the code, to allow you to type.

All html code appears in a different color (red), and text is justified
and highlighted depending on what you've done to it. (eg, clicking on the
'italic' button will add the <i> and </i> to the text, and also turn the
text between the code to an italic font.

The macros are packaged on my web site. The application is 'ChocWare' -
if you like it, send me some chocolate, and I'll send you the latest
version.

You can get to it directly via:-

http://www.icbl.hw.ac.uk/~cjs/cbs/index.html

If anyone wants the archive but has no web access (can't think why you'd 
want it then..? ), I can email the uue file (100k with pictures).

Enjoy !

And thanks to Woody for continuing to support us.. !

@node NEWS11 "Termite 1.10"
@toc NEWS

                            TERMITE 1.10 NOW AVAILABLE!
                            ===========================

Some of the NEW features in 1.10:

* Built in ZMODEM protocol

    The XPR ZMODEM library is no longer required for ZMODEM transfers.  
    The functionality of the XPR ZMODEM library has been written into
    Termite, with portions hand-optimized in assembly language for speed.

    The built-in ZMODEM code also takes special measures to avoid dumping
    binary "garbage" characters on your terminal, in the event of an
    aborted transfer.

* Improved emulation

    Termite now offers two built-in emulations: ANSI & VT102.  The new
    ANSI emulator is much more complete and robust, and has been
    extensively tested with the most complex ANSI screens we could
    find.

    The VT102 emulator is ideal for use with UNIX or VMS dialup
    accounts, and can completely replace the XEM VT340 library for most
    users purposes.  Both of the built-in emulations have mouse-based 
    cut-and-paste functionality.

* Jump scrolling

    Both of the built-in emulations offer the ability to "jump scroll".
    Instead of scrolling the screen one line at a time, Termite 
    monitors incoming serial data and scrolls up multiple lines at
    a time, for a huge speed increase.

* Multitasking review buffer

    You can now use the terminal and review buffer simultaneously!

* Enhanced chat window

    The chat window now maintainss a resizable "history", which keeps 
    track of the text you have sent.  A single click on a line in the 
    history brings it up for editing.  A double click on a history 
    line instantly resends it.

* New dialer

    The dialer has been almost completely rewritten, although it 
    still visually appears the same.  The "Cancel" button is now
    available at virtually any point during the dialing process.
    Dial monitoring can be toggled for each individual phonebook
    entry.

* Predefined palettes

    The screen settings requester now provides buttons which allow 
    you to switch between ANSI, RIP, and Termite default color palettes 
    with the click of a button.  

* Review buffer filter

    Optional filtering of ANSI codes out of the review buffer.

* New macro capability

    You can now launch an ARexx script via a macro.

* New button bar icons

    Sporting a cleaner default palette, Termite 1.10 offers a
    revised selection of button bar images, which occupy less than half 
    the disk space of the previous images.

* New button bar functions

    Settings requesters can now be accessed from the button bar.

* Compatibility with previous configuration files

    Termite 1.10 will read your old 1.00 prefs and phonebook files without 
    any sort of conversion program, although you'll probably want to 
    browse through the settings menus anyway, to make sure you're getting 
    the most out of Termite's new features.

* Ignore file overwrite warnings

    "This file exists, overwrite it?" warning messages can be optionally 
    turned off, for the benefit of expert users.

* Ignore serial errors

    Optionally disable reporting of serial errors.  Termite will just 
    drop the offending data bytes instead.

* New and revised ARexx commands

    "SerExpand" is now "Send".  New commands, including "AppendCapture".

* New manual

* New quick reference card

    Quick reference card that explains the suggested usage of the default
    button bar images.

* Recoverable alerts fixed

    All known instances of recoverable alerts have been fixed.

* Much more...

    Many many little tweaks and improvements, for a leaner, 
    meaner Termite!

The price for registered users to upgrade is:

    US$10.00 for a new disk and the quick reference card, or
    US$15.00 for a new disk, the quick reference card, and second edition 
                   manual.

    There is also a US$2.00 shipping/handling fee.

(Note: Some copies of Termite 1.00 already have the second edition manual.

Sigh.

There has been a very slight ripple in the force about 10 days ago.  I
received my latest accounting sheet from my publisher, Virtual Reality
Labs, and it was the first time NO Distant Suns/Amiga were sold.  Zilch,
NULL, nada.  .  .

Sniff.

VRLI no longer plans any further support for Distant Suns, although a
smaller company, Chaocity, has picked up the Amiga line of products and
have my source code for possible future versions.

I want to thank all of you fine folks out there, customers, friends, fans
of AmigaTrek, etc.  As even the diehards start to wistfully consider the
possiblity of moving over to PCs I might suggest that you consider the
Distant Suns legacy.  Two months ago the third generation of Distant Suns
was released, called First Light.  This is currently a windows product
only, but I think it's a damn good one.

Thanks guys and gals, it's been fun.

VERSION

  5.0

AUTHOR

  Torsten Hiddessen

  Email: math@sun.rz.tu-clausthal.de
  URL:   html://www.rz.tu-clausthal.de/~math

DESCRIPTION

  This package contains 13 new Hight-Quality Magic-Backgrounds for
  use with Martin  Huttenloher's MagicWB. I created 40 backgrounds
  before - this is the fifth release.

  I always tried to create patterns wish have no visible borders and
  can be repeated without looking trivial. I didn't want to be one of
  the authors wo put a dozen copies of the same pattern into an
  archive - just with different colors or with serveral figures drawn
  on it. I think thats not worth downloading...

  This time all backgrounds were taken from several photos. I
  processed the raw-material with ADPro 2.5.0 and finished it with
  DPaint 4.5, pixel by pixel - serveral days of work.

  Result: the best backgrounds available (IMHO)! 
  Additionaly I have included two classic Boot-Pictures and two
  older backgrounds which fit very well into this package ;-)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  In order to use this collection you will need:

  * An AMIGA ;-) with at least Kick 2.0+ (3.0 recommended)

  * A properly installed MagicWB of Martin Huttenloher
    or (under WB 2.0/2.1) NickPrefs

  * If you want to use a boot picture, you need a program like
    PicBoot V2.7

  * Internet access - so you can send me e-mail to REGISTER!

AVAILABILITY

  Magic-Backgrounds are available on any Aminet mirror in 'pix/mwb'
    ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/pix/mwb/MagicBGs5.lha
  or on my WWW-page
    http://www.rz.tu-clausthal.de/~math/AMIGA.html

  My previous releases were freeware - I just asked to send me comments
  by e-mail. So far, only a few nice guys (around 12) send me mail.
  BUT: I know that very much people use my backgrounds everywhere:
  on their Workbench, with MUI, inside DEMOS, on WWW-pages,...

  Therfore I decided to publish seven of 13 backdrops crippled:
  they are marked with a cross. You will receive a peronalised
  package if you register.

WONDER COMPUTERS INCORPORATED EXPANDS SCOPE AND OPERATIONS

Ottawa, Ontario, Canada
September 12, 1995

One of North America's largest Amiga-only companies just got bigger.  
Wonder Computers, Inc.  not only expanded their corporate headquarters and
added a new multimedia dealership to their arsenal, but has formed Lazarus
Engineering, a development arm dedicated to the creation and refinement of
Amiga products.

WCi's new headquarters keep the company based in Ottawa, but creates 3,000
extra square feet for the expanding administrative office needs of the
company.  The former HQ will continue to be used as a retail outlet, with
larger floor space, more storage, and a full-time Amiga lab for classroom
activities run by WCi's Information Technologies division.

Coming off the heels of a successful showing at AmiJAM '95 in Western 
Canada, Wonder Computer has opened its fifth Amiga dealership in 
Vancouver, British Columbia.  Tim McGuire, formerly manager of Wonder's
Montreal store, has relocated to manage the new operation.  With the
addition of the Vancouver store, Wonder Computers occupies 13,000 square
feet of Amiga-only business nationwide.

In order to meet the demands of the global Amiga marketplace, Wonder 
Computers decided to add a new product development division to the team.  
Dubbed Lazarus Engineering, and lead by industry veteran Steve Cockwell, 
the division will bring the talents of such well-known developers as 
Steve Tibbett to the Amiga consumer.  In addition to original, in-house
projects, Lazarus is hard at work revamping and improving the product 
line WCi purchased from New Horizons Software last spring.  Popular 
packages such as Flow, QuickWrite, and DesignWorks are being brought 
up to the standards of the latest Amiga operating system as well as 
improved to compete in today's marketplace.

Under the ministrations of Amiga Technologies, the Amiga marketplace has 
a changing face.  Wonder Computers, Inc. is taking the steps necessary to 
ensure that Amiga users worldwide are prepared for the future and 
are supported in their needs today.

Wonder Computers, Inc. is a privately held corporation.

@node FEATURE1 "News from Amiga Technologies UK"

===========================================================================
                      NEWS FROM AMIGA TECHNOLOGIES UK
  Steve Crietzman                               steve@parabbs.demon.co.uk
===========================================================================

In early September, Steve had a 20 minute conversation with Sajjad Majid,
Head of Developer Support UK.

These are the points that came out of the conversation, reported by Steve.

-Developer Support is still incomplete - (yep, I was told to fax Dr Peter
 Kittel -- I'd hate(/love :) to have his job at a time like this..)

-Escom AG has evidentally not given AT the kind of money they need.
 However, after sales between now and Christmas, they hope to launch an
 agressive marketing campaign (referring to M$ and IBM as examples of such,
 convincing users Win95 was the best and only multitasking OSs, even though
 it isn't..)

-AT plan possibility of marketting the fact that the Aniga can happily
 multitask within 2 Meg of memory, compared to Win95's 8Mb minimum, 16Meg
 recommended.

-The image of the Amiga in the UK they aim to change from a games machine
 into a serious, low-cost multimedia platform.  (Not necessarily the cost
 of the machine, but the cost of maintaining a comfortable one.  Eg Win95
 may set you back hundreds on upgrading your memory, as an example.
 More and more apps on the PC requiring Win95 thus memory, plus a Pentium,
 and the high cost of PC apps alone).

-The A1300 is still in the production stage (naturally, but at least this
 confirms it).  An 030-equipped Amiga with 4Mb of RAM seems the current
 specification, plus RISC-based and CDROM-equipped Amigas under
 consideration.

-Developer Support looks likely to exist in two forms - one for
 PD/Shareware, where you pay 50 and receive includes, support utilities,
 help etc all on one CD-ROM.  This is in contrast to C='s policy of
 charging 75+ for registration, 25 for the includes, and extras for their
 individual CDROM title with all this already on it, etc.

-The other, for commercial developers, which includes full technical support.

-A MORE OPEN APPROACH TO AMIGA USERS!  AT-UK will not close their telephone
 lines to Amiga users any longer as C= did.  They welcome feedback and
 suggestions from the users.

-This also means users can give suggestions to AT for future machines, not
 just developers.  Rather than C='s style "This is what you want, go and
 buy it" (the CDTV is a deadly example), AT will take more of a
 questionaire-style approach and _ask_ Amiga users what they would like to
 see.

-A1200 pack to include no games (not suicide, but rather an attempt to push
 the serious multimedia-multitasking ability of the Amiga to the user, plus
 giving them applications to get them started straight away.  I've been
 waiting for a serious full-hearted attempt to do this from C= UK for
 years, but their holding on to the games packs obviously show they were
 not willing to take the plunge).

-400UKP price tag (approx.  US$640 at current exchange rate) is realistic,
 and will gain support of dealers looking to increase their profits (last
 part taken from an earlier Usenet posting, not actually mentioned by
 Sajid).  Due to high initial costs of choosing a new production plant, new
 headquarters, employment and wages of new engineers, support people,
 managers etc, holding press conferences/press releases, etc, this IS
 realistic.  Profits will be spent on marketing/advertising when the money
 is availible.

This is from "the horse's mouth" as it were.  Statements are those of Amiga
Technologies' Sajid Majid, not my own (except for comments and critisms
that follow).

Make of it what you will, it could all be bull or there could be more truth
in there.  As it appears to make sense, I tend to believe a lot of work is
going on behind the scenes, for the benefit of the Amiga.  Here's hoping
I'm right..

                       INTERVIEW WITH GILES BOURDIN
                 C 1995 by Markus Bieler and Claude Müller
              Members of AUGS (Amiga User Group Switzerland)
===========================================================================

The Amiga User Group Switzerland had the possibility to interview Gilles
Bourdin (Public Relations) of Amiga Technologies.  Gilles was at the boot
of Promigos, one of the two Swiss Amiga- distributors (the other is B&S
Digitronic), at the ORBIT computer fair in Basle, Switzerland.  "Orbit" is
the largest computer-fair in Switzerland. 

We, (Markus Bieler and Claude Müller) asked Gilles Bourdin questions on
several topics.  The questions were based on the IRC-Conference that he had
attended a few days before.  Here are some hot infos you might find
interesting.  AmigaReport-readers get it first ! 

- On September 11th, the first Amiga 1200 were produced and tested 
  in Bordeaux (France). As a result, about 8000 A1200 per week 
  will be manufactured. The first A1200 will have arrived in 
  Germany by the end of this week. 

- The Amiga4000T with MC68060 should be available from Nov./Dec. They 
  are still discussing whether they will produce an own card or 
  if they will license it from a third-party manufacturer. They 
  are talking with several companies about that. 

- A future model, an improved A1200 will be also available with a 
  CDROM. Also, MPEG will be possible. It's important for them that 
  existing, correctly programmed CD32-software, will run on this 
  CDROM, too. The A1200 CDROM will be based on the CD1200 which 
  has never been delivered. 

- Amiga Technologies supports development of Software for Amiga 
  on CDROM and in general. 

- He didn't give us many informations about the company ISE because 
  this is still "secret". Amiga Technologies will give ISE a time-limit 
  for development of a product. ISE then has to decide themselves how 
  many people they will use for that job. Developments will be made 
  by Amiga Technologies itself and by ISE. 

- Development of a RISC-Amiga is surely a priority. Until the first 
  RISC-Amiga, MC68060 based Amigas are a good compensation. 

- Amiga Technologies has good contacts with the industry which will 
  help and give advice in moving to RISC. This switch will be 
  made in any case, be it "with or without ISE". 

- They are still discussing where development will be made. Germany 
  is preferred, they are looking for the best solution. Some developers 
  from the USA are willing to move to Germany. It's no problem to find 
  capable people Germany/Europe that are able of doing Amiga-development. 
  There are many excellent developers, as an example we should look 
  at all the shareware-programmers. Amiga Technologies considers the 
  large shareware-and PD market on the Amiga an important strength 
  of the Amiga. 

- Development depends on the success of the sale of Amigas now. But 
  we shouldn't worry about that, says G.Bourdin, since the "new" 
  Amigas "gehen weg wie frische Brötchen" (oops, no intelligent 
  translation available here, in other words: The demand is VERY high). 
  100'000 A1200 and 20'000 A4000T are practically sold. They expect to 
  reach the break-even point in February. Because Amiga Technologies is 
  a 100% daughter-company of ESCOM it is important to work in the 
  direction of profit and have a good organization of the company. 

- To the question if AT thinks that it can compete with the fast 
  development of the computer-world Gilles Bourdin responds with 
  a clear "yes". There already is a demand now. The Amiga has many 
  strengths in Video, Multimedia and most important the OS. One 
  important strength of the Amiga OS is the low HW-performance it 
  needs, but that doesn't mean that AT doesn't wants to develop better 
  hardware. There are solutions that are not possible with a pc-clone, 
  for example a cheap settop-box. Amiga Technologies has "good chances". 

- The fact that ESCOM doesn't have any experience in development 
  doesn't lead to a negative influence on Amiga Technologies. "Mr. 
  Schmitt knows what's up.", says Gilles Bourdin. For example, 
  Schmitt has done the talks with SCALA that have lead to a good 
  cooperation with SCALA on a software-basis. 

- The company SMG is a non-exclusive Amiga-distributor for America (others 
  will follow). They are responsible for marketing and distribution. 
  The contract is valid until the end of this year. 

- The Amiga 4000T is that expensive because it is a "new product" which 
  has high costs to get into production. Also it needs expensive parts 
  which can't be manufactured in very large numbers and are therefore 
  more expensive than mass-production-parts. 

- Gilles Bourdin wants to underline that the construction of a company, 
  including the start of the complete production within three months 
  is a very good performance that can't be done that well by many ! 
  In general, Amiga Technologies is a company that can make decisions 
  very fast. 

- Marketing for this year is concentrated on PR (public relations): 
  Press-conferences, attending shows/fairs, supporting distributors 
  (e.g. attending "Orbit"), making contacts with the press. There 
  will be press-conferences at the following places (this year): 

  Milan (Italy), Madrid (Spain), Lisbon (Portugal), Bordeaux (France, 
  with local French press and the intl. Amiga-press), Bradford (UK, 
  together with Microvitec and the local UK press), Prague (11.+12. 
  Oct., perhaps attending the INVEX-fair), Paris (5th of October), 
  Cologne (Germany, World of Amiga). 

  Advertising will be made in Amiga-magazines first, later also in 
  some pc-magazines. Marketing depends on the country. In some, the 
  Amiga-distributors will be part-responsible for marketing. 

- An Amiga internet bundle for A1200 and A4000T is planned. This must 
  run from one disk, on an A1200, connected to a TV. 

- AT doesn't work together with the AOS replacement team, but they 
  have "a good view of the market" and know "who's sitting at which 
  place". Ideas of other people are discussed at AT. 

- One important goal in development of the OS is RTG. It is not planned 
  to use pd-extensions like MUI for the OS because this isn't everyone's 
  taste. 

- On the question which programming language / compiler will be used 
  for OS-development he names SAS C. AT is in talks with SAS. Also there 
  is another project from another company which is still secret. 

- Communication between Amiga Technologies and the ESCOM country- 
  subsidiaries is excellent. 

- They are having Meetings with NewTek. 

- Talks about "Amiga in China" are still in progress. The market is 
  a "gigantic chance". It is very likely that the Amigas that would 
  be sold in China would be the same models used in the other markets. 

- The company Innelec is Amiga-distributor for France. They and AT will 
  hold a press-conference together on Oct. 5th in Paris. 

- Macrosystem has licensed the Amiga-technology. Many companies are 
  negotiating with Amiga Technologies concerning licensing parts of 
  the Amiga-technology to realize their own projects. 

- Concerning the software-bundle, Gilles Bourdin said that it is the 
  same in all countries. SCALA MM300 comes only in combination with 
  a hd-drive. 

- Support (ADSP = Amiga Developer Support Program) is planned with 
  WWW and FTP-servers. At the moment, ADSP can be reached at: 
  adsp@amiga-tech.de 
  Support on BIX is in discussion. 

- Important: All Amiga (incl. A1000 !!!) replacement parts will be 
  available from Amiga Technologies Braunschweig.

===========================================================================
  AMIGA TECHNOLOGIES & GIUNTI MULTIMEDIA  WELCOME BACK THE AMIGA IN ITALY
  Marco Dufour                                        marduf@galactica.it
===========================================================================

           Press Conference - Milano  (SMAU) - 21/9/95

           report from Marco Dufour - Computer Gazette

Today (21/9/95) at 11:30 AM, in the C Conference hall of the SMAU computer
fair in Milano (Italy), Amiga Technologies and Giunti Multimedia revealed
their strategies for the future of the Amiga in Italy and the rest of the
world.

There were more than 30 journalists from various magazines (Amiga Magazine,
Enigma Amiga Run, Amiga Byte, Computer Gazette, PC Magazine, MicroComputer
etc.); they all waited for the good news: THE AMIGA IS BACK!

Ok, who is Giunti Multimedia?
Giunti is one of the oldest Editorial group here in Italy.  Three years ago
Giunti and Albino Bertoletti (Ex CEO of Commodore Italiana) founded Giunti
Multimedia.  Since then they published more than 42 CD titles for CDTV,
CD32, CDI, CD-Rom.

During the first week of September Giunti Multimedia agreed to be the
exclusive italian distributor for the Amiga range products.  They also
distribute the spectacular I-glasses, the new Virtual Reality experience by
Escom.

The meeting was a success and everybody seemed satisfied (...  the
prices...  a bit too high ...)

Amiga in Italy:

Obviously this was the most important subject of the meeting.

The production is on the way and we should see the "new" Amiga 1200 and
A4000 Tower very soon.  Petro Tyschtschenko confirmed that on the 11th of
september the first NEW Amiga was born in Bordeaux.  That's a good news
because it means they found all the pieces to make it, and be sure it
hasn't been a simple task!  By the way this means that the product will be
on the shelves in the very near future (firt week of october, they say).

The "new" Amiga 1200 has the same specs of the old one produced by
Commodore.  They had to do that because they wanted to get the Christmas
sales.  The good news is that it will have a serious Bundle wiht Wordworth
4, Personal Paint, Scala MM 300 and other good stuff.  The bad news is that
it will have a mere two MB of memory.  Well, you can buy the new Blizzard
1260 (Phase 5) and have a truly workstation for less than 3000 Dmarks!

 The A1200 + kit costs 1.150.000 Lires VAT incl.
 The A1200 + kit + 170 HD costs 1.450.000 Lires VAT incl.
 The new A4000 Tower costs 5.890.000 Lires VAT incl.  (68040/25MHz, 6 MB of
ram and 1 giga HD - SCSI II)

Amiga Technologies also showed the new Multisynch monitor.  It's the
Microvitec, a good monitor compatible with 15 KHz and 31 KHz frequences.  
This means it's compatible with A500 and A1200 too.  The price of the
monitor is set to 750.000 Lires VAT incl.

I-glasses!

During the meeting were introduced in Italy the fantastic I-glasses!  The
speaker, Denis Premiski, told that there are planned 25.000 units for
Europe.  He claimed it's the Virtual Reality tool for the masses.  There
will be a special Amiga bundle with specific Amiga drivers.

NEWS:

NewTek is back on the Amiga!  They were undecided where to produce only the
PC version of the Video Toaster and LightWave but then Amiga Technologies
convinced them to continue supporting the Amiga.  That's good, expecially
for american users

The new monitor from Amiga Tech.  is the old but good MicroVitec.  On
october the 10th, Amiga Technology will have a party to welcome the new
Amigas on the market.  It will take place in Bordeaux, France.  There will
be an Internet Package, with Modem and programs.  More news about that in
the near future.

The next generation Amigas (faster processor and better graphics) will be
introduced at CeBit (Hannover fair, March 1996).

Comment:

Like in Frankfurt, last May, I felt Escom and Amiga Technologies are doing
the best they can to bring back the Amiga.  We, as users and fan of the
Amiga, should let them know our support and our thinking of what future
Amigas and current should be.

Why not, for example, put an High Density drive inside the A1200?  It's not
a technical problem and the advantages are great!

In my humble opinion I can't tell what's right and what's wrong, expecially
before I see the final product (weren't we expecting a greeny Tower?). 
Let's hope all the promises will be mantained and the prices lowered.

===========================================================================
                                 I-GLASSES
  Dr. Peter Kittel                               peterk@combo.ganesha.com
===========================================================================

Perhaps some people already have heard about this new, fancy product.  
i-glasses!  by company Virtual I-O in Seattle are a new and affordable way
into 3d, or Cyberspace, if you want.  For Europe, we have set up a sister
company named Virtual Products, residing together with Amiga Technologies
under the same roof in Bensheim.

There are two parts: The main one are the glasses themselves, a color LCD
for every eye, independent ones.  Provided with the right signals, you will
see real 3D effects.  - The other part is called Head Tracker and is a
position (or better angular) detector for your head to enable real-time
looking around in space or do cursor-like movements by head movements.  -
Also mounted to the glasses are stereo headphones.

To provide the right signals for the glasses is nearly trivial.  They take
a fully standard composite video signal (one wire, plus two others for
stereo sound) as input.  Thus there are PAL and NTSC versions of the
glasses.  The NTSC versions already exist, the PAL versions are also now
shipping.  As the video signal is standard, it is always interlaced.  And
then the even lines (or one half field) go to the right LCD and the odd
lines (the other field) to the left (or the other way round, you can choose
with a switch a the set, so you don't have to worry during programming). 
This way of coding is also called "field sequential".

When I had the first PAL glasses in my hand and tried my first own
software, my experience was: You have to make the effect much more drastic
than I thought.  For the nearest point to the face I chose on a HiRes
screen 15 pixels horizontal spacing.  This is far too little I learnt: If a
pixel is infinitely far away, its two field pixels should be a quarter
screen apart horizontally, when the pixels gets nearer, the field pixels
get nearer to each other and cross finally.  Assume that the view angle is
only ca.  40 degrees.

Another hint for programming:
The resolution is rather low, something like 268 x 230 (don't have more
concrete figures, sorry).

The head tracker part is a bit more complicated, I'll quote below the data
provided to me by Virtual I-O.

I tried to format the text the way it is in the developer's kit, but my
mail program created a mess of it.  The fax line has been busy, so
hopefully this e-mail will work.

  Sample Code Notes:

Introduction The i-glasses!  Tracker, available exclusively from Virtual
i-0 Corporation, sends yaw, pitch, and roll information to a host computer.
This information is then available to application software for creating
immersive, head-tracking, real-time stereoscopic 3D simulations called
virtual reality.

Basic Tracker orientation

All orientation descriptions are from the perspective of someone actually
wearing the Tracker: Positive yaw is defined as a left head rotation.  
Positive pitch is an upward head tilt.  Positive roll is a left head tilt.

The coordinate system used is +Y up, +Z out, and +X right (The positive
axes can be formed with the right-hand index, middle finger, and thumb: a
right-handed coordinate system.  See Computer Graphics, principles and
practice, by Foley et al for more inf ormation on coordinate systems). 
creating immersive, head-tracking, real-t ime stereoscopic 3D simulations

descriptions are from the perspective of someone actually wearing the

is an upward head tilt.  Positive roll is a left head tilt.  The coordinate

with the right-hand index, middle finger, and thumb: a right-handed
coordinate system.  See Computer Graphics, principles and practice, by
Foley et al for more inf ormation on coordinate systems). 

Communicating with the host computer The Tracker communicates with the host
computer via an RS-232C 3-wire serial interface (TXD, RXD, GND).  The
Tracker can run at 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, and 19200 bps.  The Tracker can
be queried and tested using a standard ASCII terminal program.  All
commands are printable ASCII strings, and provide feedback to tell the
application if a command was successfully processed.  All commands (except
'S') begin with a '!' (Attention) and end with a carriage return (Hex D). 
The Tracker responds with an ' O' for OK or an 'E' for an Error.  The 'S'
(Send data) command requests the Tracker to send data to the host.  In this
case, only the requested data is returned, and a time-out check must be
used to determine if an error occurred.  Protected mode applications will
need a bi-modal serial handler.  A bi-modal serial handler for Watcom C/C++
is provided on the developer kit disk.  Using the i-glasses!  Tracker The
Tracker must be initialized to a known state before an application can
begin using the Tracker.  Since the Tracker may be in a continuous
streaming mode and at any of six supported bps rates, the host must send a
reset command until successful.  This will give the Tracker time to stop
sending data and to change its communications rate if necessary.  After the
Tracker has been successfully reset, the host must put the Tracker into the
appropriate mode for the application (polled, streaming, ASCII, bina ry,
etc.).  For emulation purposes, the Tracker retains its last operating
modes (data mode, send mode, and send format) when it was powered off.  All
applications that directly support the Tracker must set and verify the
operating modes on initial startu p. 

The i-glasses!  Tracker command set All commands to the Tracker are
printable ASCII characters.  Each command (except 'S') is terminated with a
carriage return (Hex D).  Result codes, 'O' and 'E' are ASCII 'O' and 'E'.
Tracker orientation data is sent to the host in either ASCII or binary. 

The serial protocol is one start bit, 8 data bits, no parity, and one stop
bit.  Command Description !R Resets the Tracker to the default state:
cooked, polled, binary mode.  All applications should put the Tracker into
Cooked, Euler, or an emulation mode before requesting orientation data.  !V
Get the Tracker revision string.  This allows future revisions of the
protocol to work as applications will know what version of the hardware
they are talking to.  The string format is: M<16 chars>P<16 chars>T<8
chars>Hxxx.xxxFxxx.xxx where M is for Manufacturer followed by a 16
character ID string, P is for Product code followed by a 16 character
product code or serial number, T defines product Type, H is for Hardware
revision followed by a C format "%07.3f" revision string, and F is for
Firmware revision with the same C format string.  An 'O' or an 'E' is
appended to the end of the returned string to indicate whether an internal
self test has passed or failed.  !M<data mode>,<send mode>,<send
format>[,<magnetic filter>,<tilt filter>][,<Mouse sensitivity>,<Mouse
threshold>]<CR> Tells the Tracker to change data mode, send mode, send
format, and filter modes, and is terminated with a carriage return (Hex D).
Data modes are '0'-'4'.  Send modes are 'P' for polled, 'C' for Continuous,
and '0'-'1' in mouse mode.  Send formats are 'A' for ASCII and 'B' for
Binary.  Filter ranges are '0' for none, and '7' for maximum.  These
parameters must be sent all at once, separated by commas, and in the
defined order.  Filter modes and mouse parameters are the only optional
commands and shouldn't be set by the application, but rather by the Tracker
manager software.  If they are set by the application, the user must be
able to change them.  If the optional mouse parameters are set, the filter
parameters must also be specified.  The mouse sensitivity and threshold
settings are fully described in the mouse emulation section.  Only Tracker
manager software should set mouse settings.  S Tells the Tracker to send a
packet of orientation data.  In continuous modes, 'S' starts the stream.
When a '!' is sent, the stream stops and the command is processed.  '!'
followed by a carriage return can be used to stop the stream. 

Virtual i-O Tracker Modes Mode 0: raw data mode The Tracker sends raw data
readings from the sensors.  The numeric format is 12 bits unsigned
(0..4095) stored in 16-bits for all values.  This mode is most useful for
debugging the hardware.  Data packet format for mode 0 (binary) The total
packet size is 12 bytes.  The byte format is:

   Byte    Description
   0  Header (always 255)
   1  X-axis high byte
   2  X-axis low byte
   3  Y-axis high byte
   4  Y-axis low byte
   5  Z-axis high byte
   6  Z-axis low byte
   7  Pitch high byte
   8  Pitch low byte
   9  Roll high byte
   10 Roll low byte
   11 Arithmetic checksum (Bytes 0-10 added together) 

Data packet format for mode 0 (ASCII) The data is transmitted in the
preceding form in ASCII hex with spaces separating each two byte ASCII hex
value.  This is for debugging only.  Send mode for data mode 0 The send
modes for data mode 0 are 'P' for Polled and 'C' for Continuous.  In
continuous mode, a '!'<CR> command stops the stream and the 'S' command
restarts it.  To read data in continuous mode, the application searches for
a start header (255).  Once f ound, the rest of the packet must be read in,
the checksum computed and compared to the packet's checksum.  If the
checksums don't match, the application must reread the data one byte beyond
where it last found a 255 and start the process over again.  Alternatively,
the application can stop the stream with a '!'<CR>, pause a few character
send times, flush its read buffers, then send an 'S' and begin reading the
stream.  All raw modes should not be used for commercial applications.
They are for factory debugging only. 

Mode 1: Cooked data mode The Tracker scales the magnetic vector, centering
it about the zero, and linearizes the tilt sensor readings based on
internal factory calibration constants.  This is the mode to use when
performing the angle computation on the host.  The data format is s igned
16-bit words.  The x, y, and z magnetometer readings are approximately +/-
16384 (This varies with the Earth's magnetic field).  The pitch and roll
readings are converted to linear values where +16384 = 180 degrees and
-16384 = - 180 degrees.  To convert to floating point: degrees =
(float)reading/16384.0*180.0.  A provided C library routine converts the
cooked data values into yaw, pitch, and roll. 

Data packet format for mode 1 (Binary) 
The total packet size is 12 bytes.  
The byte format is:
   Byte  Description
   0  Header (always 255)
   1  X-axis high byte
   2  X-axis low byte
   3  Y-axis high byte
   4  Y-axis low byte
   5  Z-axis high byte
   6  Z-axis low byte
   7  Pitch high byte
   8  Pitch low byte
   9  Roll high byte
   10 Roll low byte
   11 Arithmetic checksum (Bytes 0-10 added together) 
Data packet format for mode 1 (ASCII) 

The data is transmitted in the preceding form in ASCII hex with spaces
separating each two byte ASCII hex value.  This is for debugging only.
Send mode for data mode 1 The send modes for data mode 1 are 'P' for Polled
and 'C' for Continuous.  In continuous mode, a '!'<CR> command stops the
stream and the 'S' command restarts it.  To read data in continuous mode,
the application searches for a start header (255).  Once f ound, the rest
of the packet must be read in, the checksum computed and compared to the
packet's checksum.  If the checksums don't match, the application must
reread the data one byte beyond where it last found a 255 and start the
process over again.  Alt ernatively, the application can stop the stream
with a '!'<CR>, pause a few character send times, flush its read buffers,
then send an 'S' and begin reading the stream.  Continuous mode is not
recommended for commercial applications (error recovery is dif ficult and
serial interrupts and CPU cycles are wasted). 

Mode 2: Euler angles mode The Tracker sends yaw, pitch, and roll angles.  
The data format for yaw, pitch, and roll is a signed 16-bit word, where
+16384 = 180 degrees, and -16384 = -180 degrees.  Data packet format for
mode 2 (Binary) The total packet size is 8 bytes.  The byte format is:

   Byte  Description
   0  Header (always 255)
   1  Yaw high byte
   2  Yaw low byte
   3  Pitch high byte
   4  Pitch low byte
   5  Roll high byte
   6  Roll low byte
   7 Arithmetic checksum (Bytes 0-6 added together) 
Data packet format for mode 2 (ASCII)
 
The data is transmitted in the preceding form in ASCII hex with spaces
separating each two byte ASCII hex value.  This is for debugging only.
Send mode for data mode 2 The send modes for data mode 2 are 'P' for Polled
and 'C' for Continuous.  In continuous mode, a '!' command stops the stream
and 'S' command restarts it.  To read data in continuous mode, the
application searches for a start header (255).  Once found, th e rest of
the packet must be read in, the checksum computed and compared to the
packet's checksum.  If the checksums don't match, the application must
reread the data one byte beyond where it last found a 255 and start the
process over again.  Alternative ly, the application can stop the stream
with a '!'<CR>, pause a few character send times, flush its read buffers,
then send an 'S' and begin reading the stream.   Continuous mode is not
recommended for commercial applications (error recovery is difficult a nd
serial interrupts and CPU cycles are wasted). 

Emulation Modes Mode 3: Microsoft mouse emulation mode When in binary mode
and communicating with a mouse device driver, this mode operates at 1200
bps and simulates a 7 bit data byte (with 1 stop and 1 start) by always
sending the last data bit as a simulated stop bit.  The output format is
defined by the Mic rosoft mouse data format (3 byte format).  While
operating in mouse mode, X is determined by a scaled yaw angle calculation.
Y is determined by a scaled pitch angle sensing.  Send mode 0 for mouse
mode

This mode sends values like a mouse.  Delta values are sent as long as the
Tracker moves.  The size of the deltas depends on how far the Tracker has
moved.  Send mode 1 for mouse mode

When the Tracker is first initialized into this mode, a reference position
is taken.  Any movement away from this reference position results in deltas
being continuously sent until the Tracker is moved back to within the
threshold near the reference posit ion.  The size of the deltas depends on
how far away the Tracker is moved from the reference position.  Sensitivity
and mouse mode mickey values

   One X mickey is 1/4 degree change in yaw and
   one Y mickey is 1 degree change in pitch

for a sensitivity of 1.  As sensitivity increases, the change per degree
increases.  Thus, a sensitivity of 2 represents 1/2 degree change in yaw,
etc.  A sensitivity of 0 can be used to disable X or Y mickeys.  For
example, DOOM works best with the Y axi s disabled, where yaw causes the
head to turn and pitch has no effect.  The range for sensitivity is 0-9. 


Mouse threshold settings

The threshold settings determine how far the Tracker has to move before a
packet is sent.  If the threshold is low, a movement in the Tracker will
result in packets being sent frequently (small mickey counts sent
frequently).  If the threshold is high, th e Tracker must move farther
before a packet is sent (large mickey counts sent infrequently).  The
threshold is related to sensitivity in that the movement values are first
adjusted by sensitivity before being compared to the threshold settings.  
The thres hold range is 0-9. 

Mode 4: CyberMaxx emulation mode [Not yet implemented]

Examples
Modes for terminal debugging
!M0,P,A,0,0 Raw polled mode, ASCII, no filtering.
!M0,C,A,0,0 Raw continuous mode, ASCII, no filtering.
Modes useful for applications
!M1,P,B  Cooked polled mode, binary, filtering not changed.
!M1,P,B,0,0 Cooked polled mode, binary, no filtering.
!M1,P,B,3,3 Cooked polled mode, binary, medium filtering.
!M1,P,B,7,7 Cooked polled mode, binary, full filtering.
!M2,P,B,3,3 Euler polled mode, binary, medium filtering.
Emulation modes
Mouse mode
!M3,P,A,0,0 Mouse mode, polled, ASCII, no filtering.  This is for debugging only.
!M3,C,A,0,0 Mouse mode, continuous, ASCII, no filtering.  Transmits only
when the mouse moves.  For debugging only.
!M3,C,B,3,3 Mouse mode, continuous (whenever the mouse moves), binary,
medium filtering.  For true mouse emulation, this command must be sent at
1200 bps to put the Tracker into 1200 bps mode.

The details about tracker programming are an excerpt of the i-glasses! 
Developers Kit.  This kit consists of a PC version of the glasses, docs,
and a CD with examples and costs $1000.  There will be also a version of
the kit with the developer material only for ca.  $50 (Also the PC version
of the kit comes with a CD with 10 games.) You can purchase this kit
directly from Virtual-io in Seattle (address next time).  You also can get
such material from their ftp site: ftp.vio.com, look into outgoing/docs and
especially the file webdev.doc there.

To give you an idea what the glasses products are aside from the Amiga:
There is a VCR version which is made for a WalkMan-like VCR and is just the
glasses connected to this VCR.  The second product is the "PC" version. 
It's much more expensive, because it also contains a VGA-to-composite
conversion box, and the Head Tracker.  The Amiga version of this product is
not yet defined precisely.  This is because it depends on which Amiga you
use, for the A1200 you need only the glasses and the Head Tracker without
that conversion box of the PC version.  For the A4000, you would need some
Composite modulator or similar, perhaps we have to produce again something
like the A520, this is not yet clear, sorry.  But anyway, for the Amiga,
the kit will probably contain the glasses and the Head Tracker, which
connects directly to the serial Amiga interface.  So you don't need that
VGA-to-composite conversion so that the Amiga version should become
significantly cheaper than the PC version and end up somewhere in the
middle between the Video and the PC version (rough guess currently, no
guarantee).

===========================================================================
                       IRC CONFERENCE: GILES BOURDIN
===========================================================================

[This first conference was held without notice on IRC EFNet.  Not all
questions were answered, but this represents the transcript in reasonably
clean form.  Thanks to Robert Reiswig and Niteflite for providing logs.]


        gbo | let me tell a few things here AT exists now for three months
        when we set up the thing, we set one top priority: bringing Amigas
        back to the market ASAP this ment : no enhancements to current
        models.  we had to be quick because there is a big demand for
        current models.  we know that we HAVE to enhance the technology
        otherwise we are dead in less than one year but there are very
        important strategic decisions to be made and these decisions have
        to be taken carefully because they will set the direction of RD for
        the coming years.  these processes of decision just can't be made
        public until they are completed we want our company to be
        profitable in three months of existence, ESCOM has spent tremendous
        amounts of money to set up operations, and production many times
        the initial investment of the buyout.

       RobR | When AT was formed there was some info about a HomePage.... 
       is the Up yet?  Something would be better then nothing...  i think
       this would be a good way to inform us all...

        gbo | yes, we are making our homepage

       RobR | What is the time frame ?

        gbo | actually, the servers are running already
        gbo | we have following domains :
        gbo | Amiga-tech.de
        gbo | amiga.de
        gbo | and Amiga.com soon
        gbo | there will also be an ftp server accesible for the press,
              developers and users
        gbo | the homepage will be updated dayly

  NiteFlite | what can you comment on the US disrtibution?  Whats the delay
              in namimg someone.

       Jkay | ok .. looks like a "no comment" .. Frotz?
      Frotz | I understand your startup problems, but don't you think that
      "hype" is important to this machine?  The current lack of information
      is equal to death in most consumer's eyes...  after 3 months the
      "we're new at this" thing isnt working, you have had time to hire
      experienced people...

[Bourdin announced here that the North American distributor was Service
Management Group, SMG, contracted until the end of 1995.]

        gbo | ps: the distribution contract is not exclusive
        gbo | these were not problems.
        gbo | but difficult tasks to achieve.
        gbo | when I joined the company, we were 3-4 people
        gbo | it was not easy to do what we did but we did it.
        gbo | now, new people come every day and thaings are really
        becoming a lot easier
        gbo | but we are still a small team
        gbo | and the IFA fair in Berlin for instance took lots of time and
        ressources.
        gbo | that's why we have been silent for almost three weeks
        gbo | at least i have been silent because I was realoly busy.

    Phalanx | When can we see OS upgrades and will it be more vigorous than
    when C=3D went from 1.3 to 2.0 (length of time), also will the OS be
    ported to a more common hardware platform?

    Babbage | ok a couple of things......
    Babbage | a) why does the price of the amigas when they come back out
    unchanged seem so high?  with no excuses of production runs etc.
    especiall the 4000/60, there way higher than they should be, especially
    competing against lower price higher spec pcs '.  and you say there are
    so many people wanting amigas, you should easily recoupe any costs
    selling them at more competitive prices

        gbo | these prices are to be seen as introductory prices

    Babbage | b) do you see yourself aiming newly specced amiga hardware at
    todays specced similar machines, or way ahead to try and win back more
    people

    Babbage | re b) i know many people who wont give things a second look
    at those prices :(

        gbo | the a4000T is actually a new product, since it hasn't been
        released by Commodore on the mass market.
        gbo | there have only been 200 pieces manufactured
        gbo | starting up a production like this is very expensive.
    Babbage | c) will you be talking to non developer users as well, eg.
    demo / pd game writers when designing new hardware as well for ideas

        gbo | we didn't take over any production facilities from Commodore
        there are first professional users such as companies who need
        Towers like SCALA for instance, who bought a big bunch of them.
        and also TV channels for their production needs.  The problem with
        production costs is extreme for DRAMS.  without ESCOM and their
        connections, nothing would have been = possible at all.

        gbo | we know that the price is high but that's life, we are
        starting with 20000 units of A4000T and the bill of material is high

        gbo | b) we want to RISC and enhanve the custom hardware

    Babbage | re b) do you want to meet other platforms or beat other
    platforms though

        gbo | c) we are listening to everyones suggestions

        Tau | one important question: what is the word for developers?
        Tau | when can we expect a working developer support program?
        gbo | tau: we are going to support developers of course
        gbo | ADSP is being currently build up
        gbo | we are talking to SAS for having a supported C system
        gbo | we also are talking to a german company that has finished
        development of an object oriented C++ system on the Amiga

    Babbage | gbo: know if escom are gunna setup their own software in-house?
    Babbage | that would help!

        Tau | I believe I'm talking for all remaining Amiga shareware
        developers when I say that the future still remains very unclear to
        us.  In fact, for many people the present is unclear

        gbo | tau: we are all amiga fans here, we really do all our best to
        succed in bringing it back to the market

        Tau | I for one hope to see developer support information on your
        www server RSN

    Babbage | gbo: be cool to see a place set up where all www, ftp, irc,
    etc.etc.  is all run on an amiga :)

  NiteFlite | gbo: One would hope so given the money Escom put in, also si=
  nce the Amiga is a passion you should expect this irateness from us.  :>
                        --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

[This second conference was an extension of sorts, two days later, of the
first.]

        Tau | gbo, could you start by giving us a quick overview of the
        near future plans of Amiga Technologies?  When will we actually see
        machines on sale, and where will we see them?

        gbo | please be aware that
        gbo | i am a PR guy, not an engineer
        gbo | actually today was a historical day for us
        gbo | the first 1200 board came out of the line
        gbo | it has been tested and was good.
        gbo | so we can now go into mass production.
        gbo | the A4000T should be delayed a few more days that means that
        the machines should hit the shelves on schedule.  now that
        production runs, we can concentrate one other things
        gbo | like what we want to do for next year.
        gbo | next thing to arrive will be the 060 board for the a4000T
        gbo | then we want to enhance the A1200
        gbo | give it more memory expansion onboard,
        gbo | make the motherboard less power consuming
        gbo | adding an easy CD ROM expansion with MPEG
        gbo | These are the plans for the near future, this means early
        1996 for us.

  Lohengrin | One of the thingsthat made the Amiga less tha popular was
  that you couldn't go into mainstream software shops and purchase Amiga
  titles readily.  Does Amiga Technologies have any plans to encourage
  large software chains and/or independant dsoftware retailers to carry
  Amiga compaatible titles again?

        gbo | Of course we are.  We are also talking to software editors
        [Note-I presume he means "publishers" -Jason] to make them write
        that software we want to see in these shops (jonathan Anderson is
        doing a good job regarding this in the UK)

   jalovick | I have 3 or so questions
   jalovick | has AT contacted Australian distributors,
   jalovick | what of hte old range will you continue to support
   jalovick | and do you think you'll move away from the 680x0 CPU soon ?

        gbo | We are looking for a distributor in Australia but haven't
        chosen one yet.  we will have to move away from the 680XX processor
        range for sure

  NiteFlite | What are or will be the eventual USA marketing plans or
  promotions?  If so, will you coordinate them, or Ed Goff (ie/ the US
  office)?  Any dealer support?  GA

        gbo | In the united states, we are looking for a partner more than
        for a distributor.  We have some negociations going on at the
        moment that seem to be very promising.  Currently, we have signed a
        non-exclusive agreement with a distributor called SMG.  this
        contract is valid until the end of the year.  marketing and
        promotion will be made by our partner in the states, in accordance
        with us of course

    narwhal | Will the CD32 be reintroduced or an upraded version?  Or at
    least will the MPEG card ever be available?  I have three sx-1 CD32's
    here

        gbo | The CD32 should not be reintroduced this year
        gbo | We want to do something new next year on the CD32 base.  For
        the MPEG card for the actual CD 32.  I think that we aren' t going
        to produce it anymore.  But we are looking at the market and if it
        is worth it, we have no problem if a third party co mpany wants to
        produce it under licence.  This could actually be a good solution

   NorthWay | when can we hope for ADSP to restart? are you going to do the
   chips in CMOS for lowpower? and was the DSP project sold to a 3rd party?

        gbo | adsp will restart
        gbo | yes, we want the chips to consume less power.  This is
        actually one of the development goals for the near future
        gbo | Sorry, don't know about the DSP project.

    Idea-MW | Are there any plans for an internet package for the Amiga?
    There is potential but alot of internet software currently available
    seems to be under-supported or not entirely user-freindly, at least
    when compared to PC applications.

        Tau | mattc informs me that the DSP project was completed but never
        produced

        gbo | Yes, we are working on an internet package indeed.
        gbo | I think this will be a very sucessful bundle for the A1200
        and for the A4000T.

        Tau | is it based on AS225 or AmiTCP?

        gbo | For the A1200, we want something that can run with disks and
        the standard 2MB of RAM.  And the package has to be very easy to
        use, sort of plug and play.  regarding online services, we actually
        have a lot of plans but these i can't talk about

        Tau | gbo, will this internet package be based on AS225 or AmiTCP?

        gbo | It depends on more than one factor.
        gbo | the advantage of AS225 is that it' ours
        gbo | the advantage of Amitcp is that it's better

        Tau | many of us TCP/IP software developers might disagree on the
        latter ;)

        gbo | i haven't said witch one we will use, so what is there to dis
        agree with ?

     Frotz2 | gbo: you expressed a preference for which one is better, one
     that many developers wouldnt agree with.

        gbo | amitcp is more advanced

        Tau | (there are several TCO/IP oriented developers here, and to my
        knowledge all of us prefer AS225 (or Interworks' I-Net 225))

        Tau | okay, two would prefer AmiTCP ;)

    The_Kid | Are we going to see A1200 with 2 megs chip and 2 megs fast
    out of the box?  And will the A1200 be more or less in price now tha t
    your ppl are making them?

        gbo | The current A1200 slod will have 2 meg chip ram and an
        optional 170 MB harddrive loaded with the bundle sW
        gbo | the price i can tell is 699 DM without HD and 999 DM with 170
        MB
        gbo | the prices of course will depend on different countries, VAT,
        etc...

     Timmer | My question is regarding OS development...  have any plans
     been made yet in this area, and WHEN will deve lopers be given any
     clue as to the directions the OS will take?  Also, who is in charge of
     OS development that developers can contact?  [and I prefer AS225 over
     AmiTCP :)]

        gbo | The OS has to be improved in many points
        gbo | actually you know them as well as we do
        gbo | there has been some work done on this by the AOS replacement 
        project team.
        gbo | please don't ask me about details but i know about ressource
        tracking, vMem, and memory protection to be urgent things to
        improve/implement
        gbo | the docs for developers will be made available on our ftp and
        www servers.  this is being made currently.  there will be email
        adresses for ADSP support.  we are still building up this developer
        support structure and we want it to be efficient and easily
        accessible.

        Tau | can you give a time estimate when these will be available?

        Tau | gbo, as you can see, people have more questions than you have
        time to answer.  Maybe there is something wrong with Amiga
        Technologies PR?  ;)

        gbo | tau: servers are running
        gbo | domains are reserved and used

        Tau | gbo, I tried to access said servers on Monday with no luck.

        gbo | email adresses have to be made and publicly announced
        gbo | the developer docs have to be put in a directory
        gbo | i think this should be running in two weeks.
        gbo | (actually it is already but not accessible yet)

      caldi | Also OS related, we have a BOOPSI toolkit called ClassAct
      which addresses a number GUI/API issues, who would be the contact to
      discuss inclusion of such work in the the OS?  And, will developer
      support be public or private and $$$ as it was with CATS?

        gbo | i said at the beginning of this conf that i was no developer
        nor engineer but i will try to answer the question gbo | i think
        this support should be $, not $$$

    ramscan | what about delevoper support on BIX, whats happening to that?
    and will 3.1 RKMs be made available?

        gbo | BIX is also a theme of discussion among our support guys
        although i'm not into that discussion, i know that it is one of
        their concerns and that they will adress it for sure

     Frotz2 | gbo: the lack of information now is far worse than even
     during the liquidation, to be honest.  the lack of public notice is
     VERY bad for you guys.  We don't even have contact info for the US
     distributor.

        gbo | i know.  We are very busy with fairs currently and the PR
        section is just built up now.  not easy to get the adresses and
        databases for the press worldwide.  because we dont only want to be
        present in amiga magazines.

        gbo | but don't tell me that there is less info than during the liq
        uidation, it's simply not true.

        Tau | this is the feeling here on the field

     Frotz2 | gbo: there was FAR more media coverage of the amiga in any
     single month of the liquidation than you folks have managed in 3
     months.   it's a fact.

        gbo | we are going to be present at the world of Amiga in Colone,
        10-12 november 1995.  maybe because journalists prefer to report
        about catastrophies

     Frotz2 | gbo: i'm sure it has nothing to do with inactivity on your
     part.

        gbo | and BTW i was the one providing info about Commodore on the
        net for one year

[He certainly didn't have an exclusive market on that...-Jason]

  Jerusalem | As a long time member of a user's group, I'd like to know how
  your support is set up for User's groups, and How will Canadian dealers
  aquire the new hardware, Thanks

   Cyberwlf | gbo: What sort of media coverage (if any) is planned for Aust
   ralia? (or even Australasian region)

        gbo | we will support user groups and fairs and events and
        everything possible according to our human ressources.  of course
        we know how valuable user groups are for us.  this can be by
        sending some machines, POS material or attendi ng etc.  but please
        be aware that we still are a small company.

        gbo | we now have 32 people in Bensheim

        gbo | 5 in London
        gbo | 3 in the USA (sorry i had to count)
        gbo | and 3 month is NOTHING when you build up a company
        gbo | and the will be the Amiga homepage THE OFFICIAL ONE this
        month

  Sergio Ruocco                                ruocco@tac.sm.dsi.unimi.it
===========================================================================

[Taken from comp.sys.amiga.misc, in response to a third-hand account of the
show]

When I was there (Saturday 2 and Sunday 3 Sept.) I was able to find the
AMIGA TECHNOLOGIES booth simply asking to IFA personnel at the Info kiosks
for "AMIGA": tha girl said "Oh, yes, it's hall nr.  xx" without browsing
the huge index)

When I arrived to the right place (browsing the entire fair) I saw a large
booth located in a angle of the showroom, very well laid out, in elegant
black with giant labels: AMIGA (with the small red square), Commodore (in a
different font), I-Glasses and ESCOM.

On the boot there was a big screen displaing real time AMIGA 4000 24 bit
animations and SCALA presentations.  On display there were a number of
A1200 and A4000T, three CD32 with FMV cards, ESCOM and Commodore PCs, and
the Virtual I-glasses connected both to the Amiga and to the PC.

Representatives at the stand were numerous (maybe 20) and from all the
companies: AMIGA TECHNOLOGIES, VIRTUAL PRODUCTS, ESCOM/COMMODORE and also
from external companies, like SCALA and Macrosystem, which were showing
their presentation program and the DRACO (Amiga clone without custom Amiga
chips, AMIGA OS 3.1 MC68060 @ 66 Mhz, 48 Mb ram, Retina & VLAB MOTION). 

I personally met and had a long talk with Mr.  Gilles Bourdin and Mr.  
Hohmann, both from AMIGA TECHNOLOGIES, with three people from SCALA, the
guys of MACROSYSTEM and Electronic Design.  All of them were very excited
of the feedback they got from the people attending the fair.  In
particular, Mr.  Bourdin was continously asked "When the AMIGA will be
available ?" by Video professionals from german and international TV
stations.

The booth was always filled with people looking at the computers, and
trying the i-glasses (very exiciting experience, indeed !).

===========================================================================

[Again taken from comp.sys.amiga.misc.  The below is the quoted question
that prompted this report. -Jason]

JS-> Did Amiga Technologies present the Amiga on IFA fair in Berlin?
JS-> Are there any reports available?

Yes, they did!  But they shared their presentation area with commodore pcs,
that's why their actual stand was relatively small.  They presented, I
guess, 6 Amigas, 4x 1200 and 2x 4000.  I didn't see any Towers!  But on the
4000 Desktop Computer I recognized a "4000T" Sign.  On the A 1200 they
presented the workbench (I think it was a 4 colour one).  Very awfully!  On
one 4000 the showed a Dino-Animation, on the other high grade Amiga I think
they presented Scala.  Beside the Amigas, there were dozens of Commodore
Pentium PCs!  And, yes, there were prospects about the Amiga Clone DraCo.

Very disappointing, hum?

The only positive features were the nice A1200 and A4000T prospects.

Review:
AirMail is a utility program to receive mail for use with a SLIP/PPP
(Serial Line Internet Protocol/Point to Point) account on an Internet
Service Provider, where the connection is dynamic, and the user may not be
connected at any given time.   (The POP3 standard).  It also has the
ability to interface with a SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol) mailer on
a system to send mail.

It also allows for off-line message reading and creating.

Installation of AirMail is very simple.  Running the supplied REXX script
installs the 2 libraries it needs, and creates a subdirectory in ENVARC:
for variables.  The script does not check to see if these libraries are
already in place (translator.library and socket.library), so if you had
newer version of either of these, it would be overwritten by the install.

When run, the program prompts the user to configure the program.  The
program must be configured with the name of the mail host, user name,
desired editor, and in and out box paths.  While the documentation
describes AirMail as being "a stand alone program that does not required
[sic] any additional programs" there is no built-in editor, so one must be
configured if the user wants to compose or edit mail.   The example given
is for the C= editor, ed, but I tested with memacs and the demo version of
GoldEd also.

A very nice feature is the browsing ability to find the programs needed.
Next to the boxes to configure paths, editors, etc., there is a select
button which pops up an ASL requestor, allowing the precise path and file
name to be found.

A small window pops up, with 5 icons.  These icons have no text
descriptions on them, and I had some trouble remembering what several did.
I felt much more comfortable pulling down from the menu to do exactly what
I wanted, rather than trying to remember which box was the in and out box.
I suppose one could get used to this interface, and remember which icon
does what, but it seems that a one-word description in the icon would be a
very simple thing to add, and one that would make use much simpler.

The leftmost pops up a requestor to send mail.  The To: and From: addresses
must be filled in before the editor can be invoked, but there is no message
or error if you try to edit the mail first, just nothing happens.  I would
prefer to be told why something didn't work, and what fields must be filled
in to continue rather than having to guess.

The next button over is the address book.  Addresses can be added here, for
groups and for individuals, allowing point and click sending and
forwarding. 

The next two icons are the In and Out boxes.  Mail queues up in the out Box
until it is sent.  This allows off-line message composition, and then
transmission at one time. 

The last icon gets AirMail to check the POP3 mailbox on the host for new
mail.

Documentation of AirMail consists of an AmigaGuide document, which
documents adequately in most areas the use and function of AirMail.  It
falls short in some areas, notably the "Attach" ability in the send mail. 
In the AirMail/docs/ directory, there were several DPaint picture files.
These seem to be illustrations for the Preference Setup part of the
document, but both AmigaGuide and Multiview refused to follow these links.
AmigaGuide gave an error or "display: Unknown command" and Multiview just
did nothing. 

Documented are program-specific needs, such as the program UUxT for
uudecoding and uuencoding.

Use of AirMail shows some areas that need improvement.  In and Out Boxes
cannot be open at the same time.  While in the boxes, even though a item is
highlighted, the gadgets to perform actions are usually grayed out - the
item must still be clicked on, then the gadgets become accessible. 

The password for the POP3 system must be entered in the setup - there is no
option to require the password at the time of the actual reading of the
mail on the server.  This allows anyone to access that mailbox if the
system is left unattended.   The option to enter password only at the time
of access would be a great addition for security.

When my modem hung up once while checking mail, I could not get AirMail to
exit, forcing a reboot (could not stopnet and re-dial) The "cancel" button
did nothing.

When exiting many areas in AirMail, for instance, after exiting the
external editor, the screen will jump from the WorkBench screen where I was
running AirMail to another screen.  (In this case, the Final Writer
screen). 

Also, keyboard use inside fields was erratic.  To send mail, one must enter
the To: field, if the cursor is in a text gadget, the tab key allows
movement among the fields (as is very nice).  But if enter is entered, the
cursor disappears, requiring mouse use to regain the cursor.  But, in some
fields, if enter is not pressed, the field value is not accepted.  This
highlights a functionality problem inside AirMail - often to accomplish a
function, you must use a combination of keyboard and mouse, moving back and
forth.

A more serious problem I found was the "attach" field.  I could find no
documentation for this, and no matter what I tried to attach, (binary file,
text document, saved AirMail mail) each time, the program would display the
error, "Cannot open file" and remain hung - connected to the mail server,
and "Cancel" not cancelling.  The only recourse I found was to kill the
process with PriMan.  The file with the mail was also locked open, and
undeletable until after a reboot. 

To forward a mail, the user or group must be defined in the Address Book. 
There is no provision to enter the address(s) manually.

Conclusion:
AirMail has promise, but what it shows now is not enough.  Other products
exist now, that work better than AirMail, without the idiosyncrasies and
problems, doing much the same job.  These programs, however, are either too
limited, or have so much capability that their setup is difficult, leaving
room for a nice program that will send and receive mail.

The current version has many features that make it very interesting, but
the problems in using the program, both in minor irritants to larger
problems, detract vastly from the value of AirMail.

Since AirMail is in need of further improvements, and there is an
additional fee for product upgrades, (although the key file registration
scheme may allow for upgrade distribution through AmiNet and usual
channels), I feel that it would be a purchase hard to justify at this stage
in its development.

But it is a small, reasonably major bug free piece of software, with some
good ideas that I would greatly welcome if developed a little further
(particularly MIME attaching and encoding). 

If your needs are only a small mail reader for a dynamic account, and you
rarely send mail, (and are not enough of a UNIX person to do it manually),
it will do the job.

                          REVIEW: IMAGEMASTER R/T
                            By: @{" William Near " link WILLIAM}
===========================================================================

SOFTWARE:  Imagemaster R/t v1.60 (FPU)

MANUFACTURER:  Black Belt Systems

DESCRIPTION:  24bit graphics manipulation program

SYSTEM TESTED ON:  Amiga 2000 (Rev 4.4), ECS chip set, G-Force '030
                   accelerator @ 50 MHz., 2 MB CHIP + 8 MB FAST memory,
                   Quantum LPS270S hard drive with Trumpcard Professional
                   controller, Picasso II RTG (2 MB) graphics board,
                   Workbench 3.1

A FLEETING GLIMPSE: Let me start by saying that I was excited about
receiving Imagemaster R/t for review in Amiga Report magazine, but the
excitement soon turned into disappointment after installing the program on
my hard drive. 

     After the installation was complete I proceeded to run the Imagemaster
program.   The first try at doing so resulted in a hard crash of my entire
computer.  I promptly renamed my WBStartup drawer and user-startup script
thinking that some "renegade" program was causing the conflict with
Imagemaster.  Sorry, wrong answer!  Imagemaster continued to crash like a
747 encountering wind sheer.  The only things running on my machine at that
time were Workbench 3.1 and ARexx -- Imagemaster didn't care, it was bound
and determined to trash the entire system eight out of ten attempts to get
it up and running. 

     After fiddling with a few other things and unsuccessfully trying to
launch the program, I called Black Belt System's tech support number.  The
nice man there made a few suggestions, but none of them made much
difference.  I found out another interesting fact along the way.
Imagemaster only supports two graphics boards!  The FireCracker 24 and
OpalVision are the only two boards supported, neither of which I feel are
mainstream or current boards.  No Picasso II, Spectrum, or Retina board
support.   Correct me if I'm wrong, but what good is a 24bit image
manipulation program if it only has support for AGA, ECS, and two obscure
graphics boards? 

     I tried using Cybergraphics software with my Picasso and Imagemaster
-- no difference.  If I switched the Imagemaster software to one of the
NTSC 16 color screenmodes then it would run for a few minutes before
crashing.  I actually was able to play with the program for a few minutes
in 16 color modes, but what's the use?  That's like downloading a 2
megabyte file on a 28.8k modem at 2400 baud.  You aren't getting the full
benefit of the product if you are saddled with limitations which are
imposed on you by the manufacturer or for some other reason.

SUMMARY: Imagemaster R/t just might be the best 24bit image manipulation
program on the Amiga at its cost -- you couldn't prove it by this reviewer,
though.  Maybe it's some conflict with my hardware or a conflict with
Workbench 3.1.  I don't know.  I tried every reasonable method of getting
this program to run for any length of time, but it just wasn't going to
cooperate. 

     On a positive note, I liked the on-line manual and help facilities,
but a companion printed manual would have been a nice touch.  Also, support
for other mainstream graphics boards is a necessity for a program of this
type.

     I honestly cannot recommend buying this product; on the other hand, I
cannot recommend not buying it.  It may run flawlessly on your individual
setup or it may turn you red with anger.  Frankly, I just gave up after the
fiftieth crash.

Overview

Photogenics is the best 24 bit image manipulator for the Amiga.  It takes a
completely new approach to how effects are applied, that gives it more
power then Adobe Photoshop 3.0, Image FX 2.1, or Opal Paint 2.3.  However
because of the lack of an arexx port Photogenics can not hope to snare very
many of the video/toaster users.  There has been talk of them including an
arexx port(I sent them a letter and am waiting for a responce).

    option allows the right mouse button to bring more of the back
    image in and the left mouse button brings the fore ground image to
    the front.  You can use any of the paint tools or brushes.  You can
    use any of the paint modes to combine the images.  Brightness Key
    and Transparent black enable you to blend in better as well as use
    the alpha channel for complex combines.(VERY NICE!!!)

Interface

The interface in Photogenics is wonderfully intuitive.  The manual is
excpetional in that it covers everything and gives many tutorials as you go
along.  Photogenics uses a powerful drag and drop interface between the
image, secondary image, and alpha channel(which uses the fingernails of
every picture open-you can hide or show any picture to make sure your work
space doesn't get cluttered.

[The Photogenics 1.2 manual was a SIGNIFICANT improvement over previous
versions.  -Jason]

Photogenics took a completely different approach to the way the paint layer
is added.  You can use of ANY of the drawing tools and ANY of the brushes.
The interface is extremely easy to use, like Deluxe Paint only the images
are in windows, making working with several images easier.  Each effect has
a transperency setting and brushes have a size and pressure setting when
being applied.  What the key factor to Photogenics power is that you end up
with a paint layer with varying transparency which you can change on the
fly until you decide its the way you want it to be.  You can also move the
paint layer to the alpha channel to make it so that you can apply lots of
effects with in a boundary or use fix and paint layer to apply different
effects to the same whole area.  The paint layer therefore allows an
unlimited amount of undos.  In Photoshop you can undo to the last paint
layer, but the problem is once an effect is down it can only use the undo
so you have to undo and reapply the effect each time you screw up.
Photoshop is VERY limited on how you can apply many of its effects and none
of them have the same flexibility that Photogenics offers.  Since any brush
or drawing tool can be used to apply effects and using the alpha channel is
as simple as one menu option.  Using the left mouse button applies the
effect and the right mouse button unapplies the effect.

EXAMPLE:
You want to solarize the sky on a picture of stonehenge.  You start by
using the menu option select similar on the bottom clouds.  Then use the
rectangle to fill in the upper region since there is nothing but clouds in
the upper part.  Then you take the air brush and trim the edges where the
solarization filter does not blend in well with the ground and stone henge.
This whole process in simple, can be done in a minute and produces an
awesome effect.

The secondary channel and compose are quite possibly the second most
powerful feature in Photogenics, because any compose can use any brush,
paint mode, drawing tool, and several powerful compose options.  This tool
is quite possibly my favorite, but it wouldn't be possible with out the
above feature of a modifiable paint layer.

The last thing is the warper tool added in 1.2.  This tool allows you to
select in ellipse on the the screen and set two points to warp to.  You can
also set the amount of warping and the amount of twist you would like.  One
problem is that it does not anti alias after this effect and sometimes if
something is stretched out enough you need to apply a simple 3X3 blur or
antialias.  None the less a very powerful feature when used in the right
situations.

Comarison to other products:

    Here is a list of the programs I've seen.

    Brilliance 2.0
    Deluxe Paint 4.5(latest 5-only in reviews)
    Personal Paint 6.1(latest 6.3-only in reviews)
    Macro Paint

These programs don't compare to photogenics.  It is far superior in many
things, but these offer animation and quick effects.  Photogenics blows
them away when it comes to 24 bit image manipulation and professional
painting.

    Image FX 2.0(latest 2.1-only advertisement)
    Adpro 2.5

The interface in all of these is barbaric compared to Photogenics. 
Photogenics has far superior painting ability.  Their major advantage is an
Arexx port..  which is something Photogenics REALLY needs.  Beyond this I
would never use the other programs.

    Opal Paint 2.3

Great Paint program with some nice effects only it requires a specific
graphics card.  The program is a little faster, but it's not really a photo
manipulation program and lacks many of the features Photogenics has in
painting.  However it does have several cool effects which make it a very
viable tool in painting still.

    Photoshop 3.0 w/ KPT2 Plug ins

The only direct competitor and a very good one.  Photoshop is much harder
to use and the features aren't quite as nice some times but the options are
more complete.  Photogenics is definetly a better paint program...  and in
fact Photoshop sucks as a paint program, but that isn't its purpose.  I
would have to say that I like Photogenics easy to use interface and I like
the fact that the really powerful features are far more accessible.  See
below for ratings.  Another thing is speed and the prohibitive price tag
that doesn't even include any of the extensive plug ins.

Suggestions:

(1) Arexx Port
(2) The ability to warp an image to the paint layer(if possible)
    or a rectangle or circle.

(3) Fix bugs(may be cybergraphics)

(4) Use the right mouse button with the fill effect.  So it would
    undo every part of the paint layer like that color.

(5) Multiple paint layers with a composite window.

PRODUCT NAME

    CyberVision64 64 bit graphic card

BRIEF DESCRIPTION

64 bit graphics card using the Trio64 graphics chip set which uses a
graphics processor, a 64 bit wide blitter, and a special 24 bit D/A
converter.  It also has a Planer to Chunky chip(Roxxler).  I will go over
installation, bugs, compatibility, and speed.

I bought this from Select Solutions of Campaign-Urbana Ohio.  It appears as
though they have moved...  I've tried calling them...Softwood didn't get
back to me(they are USA distrubuters for Phase 5).

LIST PRICE

        I paid $600 for the 4 Meg version.

SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE

An 040 would definetly be nice...  this would allow the computer to keep up
with the graphics board.  A nice monitor is very important because of
bandwidth and resolution.  4 Megs of RAM suddenly doesn't seem quite as
endless when you deal with normal applications.  I've found that the 8 megs
I got have come in very handy.  Photogenics(my most used program) and a
virtual screen(what I use when programming) tend to zap the fast memory as
well(nearly 3 megs in 24 bit color in photogenics just to run).

        SOFTWARE

2.04 or above.  I recommend OS 3.1(cause its better) and also because you
get to use all the features, like 256 colors in Workbench.

COPY PROTECTION

None whatsoever.

MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        Amiga 3000/16, 8 MB Fast RAM onboard, 2 MB Chip RAM.
        1 internal 1660K floppy.
        SCSI rev 8 chip
        Quantum 50 MB hard drive SCSI
        Seagate 100 MB hard drive SCSI
        Acer 14"
        Developers AmigaDOS 3.1, Kickstart 40.68 and WB 40.42.
        Cybervision 64 with 4 MB RAM

INSTALLATION

The installation was simple and very straight forward.  The manuals really
are bad except perhaps in the installation part which they do a good job. 
Using the CVMODE preferences(screen settings) I found that it was much
better (at least for me at the time) to just use the defaults that are
given when you select a khz.  They have a test screen if you want to try to
optimize the screen settings.  The other thing is that the card is full
length and you'll probably have to take the card holder on the front end if
you have an Amiga 3000, this is not a problem since it is plastic and snaps
out easily.

EXPANDABILITY

The CYBERVISION64 has an expansion bus through which additional cards such
as JPEG or MPEG cards can directly access the fast video memory.  Note
these aren't available at the time...  2GO is what they are working on
currently.  Includes a DSP and some other features for rendering pictures
faster.  I'm afraid this will be limited to programs that specifically use
it though.

REVIEW

Once I had it installed I started changing preferences and such in my
applications to use the cybervision when I wanted.  A note: The cybervision
screens reside in cybervision memory and all other Amiga screens in computer
memory so when you drag down screens you can only see screens in your
memory section, however flipping screens works fast and doesn't make a
clicking noise or anything annoying like that.

One thing I really like was loading up a large 256 color gif or iff and
then scrolling around in it on the 256 color screens...  it was like an
animation because of the updating!

More information in the bug section about how programs work.

LIKES

Speed, speed, speed, and compatiblity... I will probably get one of
their expansion modules depending on what it does (MPEG and JPEG sound
nice).

DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

The documentation is pretty lean, but it suffices because
everything is really easy.

BUGS

These may be due to my 15-31khz monitor - Also they have only to do with
cybervision screen modes except for one.  One, when scrolling around in a
large virtual screen it some times jumps back (like when you click on the
right mouse button) when you move it into a certain position.  This is no
problem if all you're doing is moving the mouse around, but if you are
using the LAmiga-Left Mouse Button drag(or whatever you have it set to) or
you've grabbed the menu bar it will. 

Sometimes I will lose a screen and it will go completely grey(happens to
NTSC screens-this does not happen when I use the 1960 monitor, but does
when I use the ACER(small bandwidth).  It will flicker occasionally when
I'm moving the screen up and down. 

Some demos and games don't like to run from a cybervision screen(like
CyberSphere or Lemon), actually I have found that almost no games work if
you run them from a cybervision screen.  When painting in hicolor,
truecolor screens the pointer has a shadow about 80 pixels beneath it.  You
can not show two hicolor or true color screen in front/back of each other,
although you can still flip through them easily.

        Notes:
Wordworth - Works great only that they use a crappy palette.  This is only
a concern for text effects when your doing shading from the first to last
letter or first to last shadow (which looks quite nice).  You can I think
load an image which forces the palette map to change (At least it seems
that way as loading several images looks nice).

ProCalc 2.0, Final Writer 3, PageStream 3.0, Multiview, Prowrite, Term,
Twist 2, and just about any other program that I run works perfect work
fine

Personal Paint 6.1 crashes anytime I try to change the mode to ANYTHING
else.  6.3 I suppose fixes all this and even allows you to paint in
Cybervision mode.  I figured out what you have to do.  Personal Paint has a
RTG setting when changing screen modes...  makes sure this is set to "Yes"
and not "No" or "Auto".

Amiga Vision Pro is NTSC or PAL only.  Although NewMode will allow you to
work in more colors there isn't any point and you can't preview anything
since it doesn't understand cybergraphics.

Scala MM300 is NTSC or PAL only.  Newmode will promote this to, but is
rather buggy when you do.

Photogenics Lite 1.2 sometimes crashes, but I use it whenever I can cause I
like painting in 24 bit a lot more than having to save the image all the
time when I use Photogenics 1.0.

Photogenics 1.25 crashes only when I run in cybergraphics mode.  Hicolor
and Truecolor screens tend to have a problem with freeing used memory (This
could still be photogenics fault, maybe cybergraphics mode implemented
wrong.  This is hard to tell since its the only program that runs
completely in cybergraphics).

OpalPaint doesn't work anymore...  oh yea we took the board out, but I will
soon be sticking it back in to test the pass through capabilities of the
Cybervision 64.

Brilliance does not allow you to use cybervision screens since it does some
hard ware hacking to the chip ram

Deluxe Paint does not animate and you have to manually refresh the brush,
solid fill, and anything else that is more than one pixel wide.

Adpro will not show more than 256 color screens(from the screen mode
requester), but you can see in 24 bit I'm pretty sure using the saver.

WBscreen can run in 24 bit, but intuition does not use more than 256 colors
so special programs like CyberWindow (which is fast, supports lots of
formats as well as datatypes, and allows windows to be opened on the
WBScreen) must be used to exploit the 24 bit display.

I use these: QMouse, ToolsDeamon, ToolsPref, CycleToMenu, PowerSnap, and
Click to Front.  Power Snap is the only one I've had problems with and ONLY
when I run a hicolor to truecolor screen mode(256 colors is fine).  I use
Iconify as well and it works fine to.

VENDOR SUPPORT

I want to call them and ask them about any known bugs and stuff like that
and speed tests, but they live too many time zones away and I always seem
to not be home when I could call (I'm afraid I work and play too much).
Select Solutions were really nice (but they didn't make the board though).

[Note-phase5 allegedly has e-mail set up @phase5.de, but no replies have
come back. -Jason]

WARRANTY

    phase5 gives a warranty of 12 months against manufacturing defects.

CONCLUSIONS

I love this board compared to the ECS chip set... which of course I
can still use.

Installation 5 out of 5
Documentation 4 out of 5
Photogenics-Lite Demo 4 out of 5 (few crashing problems)
Speed 5(6 if I could) out of 5
Compatiblity 4.5 out of 5 (the most compatible I've encountered, but still
a few general bugs they can fix that don't have to do with other
applications)

===========================================================================

Finally!

I was starting to feel like Aminet CD reviews were turning into exercises
in repetition.

Don't get me wrong, I've been enjoying them.  But the pattern for
evaluating them was one largely of "lather, rinse, repeat."  Luckily,
Urban's come up with a few things that are worth special note.  But first,
the overview of the CD.

Aminet 7 represents the change from quarterly to bimonthly publication of
CDs, meaning 8 is due any day now.  The familiar-like-an-old-friend
AmigaGuide interface is on the job, breaking down Aminet's structure into a
searchable index, either by text string, age, popularity, or physical
location on the network.

The theme for this edition is the inclusion of 10,000 images from Aminet,
largely clipart with some 24-bit JPEGs.  Eh.  I'm in online journalism for
a reason, you know, and one of those is so I don't have to worry about
clipart.  But, I know it's rather useful to a lot of people, so I endure.
It is indexed by subject matter and can be accessed by name or through a
thumbnail system.

The games and demos on the CD are once again in their own separate,
easy-access areas (when do online magazines get that treatment?), this time
categorized so far as to point out whether or not they're fully compatible
(ready-to-run from CD) on an A4000/040.  Mods get similar treatment
(although all, of course, are compatible.)

Aminet 7 also does something no Aminet CD has done before (at least, not
intentionally)-include commercial software.  Personal Paint 2.1 and PPrint
Deluxe have been licensed and placed on the CD, presumably as a promotional
measure (for PPaint, that is certainly the case, as the 6.3 demo is
included to inspire the user.)

The ability to customize your use of Aminet CDs now extends beyond the
simple preferences in place to select a dearchiver and picture viewer.
Custom index lists, for use with the AmigaGuide interface, can now be
created and saved to your system drive.  In addition, "clones", or virtual
references to software stored on the CD, can be used as real system items,
including WBStartup items.  The catch, of course, is that the CD has to be
in place whenever these programs are to be accessed, since they really live
there.  A strange concept, but if disk space is at a premium, it is worth
investigating.  My personal theory is that it is a bit of "catch up" with
the CD-Write filesystem-a way to offer some useful "virtual filesystem"
features without a full-blown package.

Aminet 7.  It's the newest software from Aminet since the last time around,
with an improved interface and a whole ton of clip art.  Rinse.

Oh yeah, and it finally credits the Amiga as a trademark of Escom AG on the
label.

DM 25, or roughly US$18, give or take depending on your mood.

                        REVIEW: MAKIN' MUSIC CD-ROM
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

CD Exchange showed up last year, tossed a general-interest CD32-aimed
compilation on the market, and then went quiet.

Now they're back, with an audio "fest" designed to, well, to sell lots of
copies, but to provide a comprehensive, one-stop resource for Amiga audio
hobbyists and professionals.

To that end, they've brought together utilities by the dozen, including
sound and .mod players, rippers, and converters, along with commercial
demos, including Octa-MED V6.  In addition, a healthy collection of MODs,
MEDs, and MIDI files is included, as well as a number of free trackers with
which to compose or edit them.

The item of the CD that the most attention is drawn to is the AKAI sample
library, an IFF and WAV collection of a large collection of (originally
16-bit) sound bites.  The quality is quite impressive, as the sampling rate
is rather high-not quite the sort of material you'll find in the average
MOD, at least not without having been reduced through any one of the many
sampling software packages included on the disc.

There is no interface as such to the CD, but there is an AmigaGuide index,
with some descriptions, for all files contained.  Most work will by
necessity be done with some sort of directory utility, and to that end,
DirWork 1.62 is included on the CD.  In fact, a complete suite of all
necessary tools (including MUI, XIcon, and DMS) are available for automatic
installation, as some programs require their services.

The concept of an "Audio Amiga CD" is not a new one, but unlike the "mod
collection" CDs I have encountered, Makin' Music has a decidedly
professional slant to it-more concerned with high-quality orchestral
strings than cartoon character samplings from TV.

It's not hard to take a decent theme and implement a compilation badly, and
it's particularly easy to make a mediocre music collection.  Many aging
bands do it all the time.  But the blend of enjoyable, pre-composed music,
genuinely useful musical tools (the mere inclusion of AmiSOX and other
format-conversion programs is a significant boost to its usefulness) and
"springboard" samples turns Makin Music into a successful product.
Convenience is part of the game, and the CD puts just about everything
within close reach.

(Note-Makin Music is not autobooting.  In addition, non-Amiga versions do
exist, offering the AKAI library and a different set of utilities.)

===========================================================================
                       REVIEW: WORLD INFO '95 CD-ROM
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Danny Amor, compiler of the FreshFonts and da capo CD-ROMs, returns with
the help of a couple of friends to create World-Info '95, an HTML-only
creation intended as a cross between an almanac and an atlas, with a bit of
travel guide thrown in.

The interface is easy enough to explain-quite simply, it will look like
whatever graphical web browser you throw at it.  For the purposes of this
review, I used AMosaic 1.4 (not having upgraded to the 2.0 beta as of yet.)
While World-Info '95 is being marketed for "any" computer platform with
graphical web browsing capabilities, the "feel" is that it was aimed at the
Amiga, if for no other reason than it lacks a text-based search utility,
which at the time the CD was being compiled was not available on the Web
browser of the day, AMosaic 1.3.

What you do get is a way to search through the facts Danny and friends have
compiled for you.  You can start all the way at the most general way to
delineate the world (landmasses and oceans), then break it down to
continents (interestingly enough, they percieve North and South America as
one continent for some purposes), and so forth, right down to latitude and
longitude of major world cities.  Along the way, you can pick up such
national data as the usual almanac entries of population, inflation,
birth/death rate, literacy rate, and the like, as well as major pollution
concerns and human rights violations.  Full-color flags are included, and
several countries have a portfolio of several pictures available for
viewing.

Translation of common phrases between popular world languages (although not
the top ten by usage) is included.  I'll be well prepared in Armenia. :)

All of the data is included on the CD-ROM in both English and German, which
in short means that basically half of the 538 megs on the CD are used for
informational purposes, since the German and English data is reproduced,
with pictures, in separate directories.  It is worth noting that the human
rights data seems to be in English exclusively-apparently too huge of a
task for translation.

World-Info is a useful resource, but not something that offers an
earth-shakingly significant quantity of information.  While the
international telephone prefix directory is in some ways useful, and
certainly is not unwelcome, it is a good capsule of the CD as a
whole-interesting, but not stunning.  Data does not delve as deeply as it
could, particularly when it comes to individual cities, reduced to
coordinates and population.  Pictures, while nice to view and readily
organized in a thumbnail system, should have descriptions by those
thumbnails.  After all, the idea of a preview is to entice the viewer to
dig into the full picture, and telling them what the sight will be in full
glorious 256 colors (your capabilities may vary) is a serious help.

The data that has been compiled is certainly worth having access to,
particularly in the realm of human rights.  (Fascinatingly enough, there is
a "no entry" for the US-I presume that is because the reports seem to have
originated here.) 

In fact, that is one of the major negatives to the CD.  Much of the
information has been compiled, but not written, by Amor and the D'Addeo
sisters.  As such, there is an inconsistency in writing style.  I am also
troubled by the total lack (on the copyright page) of recognition for the
various sources that were used to complete the CD.

The team should be applauded for using HTML to create an
open resource for many computer users.  There is an axiom used to describe
many large CD-ROM projects, and it does apply here-"there is something for
everyone."  Few resources like this exist for the Amiga.  But don't rely on
it alone to plan your winter holiday.

==                      Amiga Report Mailing List                        ==
===========================================================================

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to listserv@itesmvf1.rzs.itesm.mx.

Your subject header will be ignored.  In the body of the message, enter

subscribe areport <your real name>

ie: 

subscribe areport A. R. Reader

The system will automatically pull your e-mail address from the message
header.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!             **

          *** The following is only for Australian readers!  ***

To circumvent the new pay-per-megabyte system for Australian Internet
communication, Paul Reece has been kind enough to set up an AUSTRALIAN-ONLY
mailing list, to save his fellow countrymen some money.

You can join the list by sending mail to:   majordomo@info.tas.gov.au

with the single line (in body of message):

Amiga Report will then be bounced to you.

==                        UUDecoding Amiga Report                        ==
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

==                    Amiga Report Writing Guidelines                    ==
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.  Please stipulate as
well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to the editor.

                The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
          -------------------------------------------------------

Portal is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-service online SIG
(Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users. We promise, and
WE DELIVER ongoing & aggressive Amiga support!

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in many ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA high-speed modems (you pay for the phone call
if it's not local), or though any SprintNet or Compu$erve indial anywhere
(with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell service!  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help, and you can easily customize
it for your favorite terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1000 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
      once, of any size, with one command.
 * Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, Elastic
      Reality (ASDG), Soft-Logik, Apex Publishing, and others.
 * 40 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 10,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.
 * Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
      related and get quick replies from the experts.
 * Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, AMosaic, LightWave, EGS,
      OpalVision & others feed right into the Zone message bases.  Read
      months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with them.
 * FREE unlimited Internet Email with 5 meg of free storage.
 * A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.
      You can run Amiga Mosaic through your shell and explore the
      vast World Wide Web!
 * Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which you can read
      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine.
 * Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
      never worry "Ooops... Am I paying for this area?" again!
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  And you get FREE unlimited
      usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
      email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
 * Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
      at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
