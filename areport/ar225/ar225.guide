Welcome back to Amiga Report!  Again, thanks to everyone who has stuck
with us through this bizarre summer.

I'd like to announce a few things.  First, Michael Wolf joins AR as its
new European Editor, and Alan Buxey has the newly-created honor of being
AR's UK Correspondent.  Hopefully, the pair will get cracking and write
something relatively soon.

Once more, the Amiga community sits around waiting.  It's really
getting a bit infuriating.

David Pleasance continues to make himself the most-talked about man in
the Amiga community, taking the top spot previously shared between Irving
"Sold a bunch of CD32's at $90 apiece because they were his loan payment"
Gould and Medhi "Why are you calling me, you idiot?" Ali.  Most of the
talk is either rehashes of his recent statements (he sent a letter to
dealers outlining his plans) and his interview in the latest Amazing
Computing.  The rest tends to be speculation, and while not all of it
is positive, the "David Pleasance wouldn't know the truth if it bit him
on the ass" comments have subsided.

In an attempt to stay on top of the news, this week's AR contains his
most recent letter printed in CU Amiga, in which he tries to dispel the
rumors that his plans included the death of the 4000 and the holdup of
future development.

Amazing Computing's interview pulls out some rather interesting points...
from the way the conversation went, Pleasance sounded (to me) as though
he would be happy as can be if he could do great business in the UK
alone...just about every reference to North America had to be dragged
out by the interviewer, AC Editor Don Hicks.

Of course, all of this is meaningless if Pleasance and crew are not
successful.  Who does that leave?  By most accounts, Creative Equipment,
Samsung, and Amstrad.  Still no word from Samsung or Amstrad, and
CEI is still serious and is waiting for more word from the liquidators.

Amiga Report will do its utmost in the upcoming weeks to secure and
distribute information to you.  In the meantime, it's worth mentioning
that AC plans to interview other interested parties in the Commodore
saga in upcoming issues.

However, let's pretend for the moment that the Pleasance/Proudfoot/
other unnamed associates buyout goes through.  Pleasance has made it
rather clear that the UK will be the center of virtually everything
except R&D (but WILL be the center of production).  What has not
been made clear is exactly how vigorously the other markets of the
world will be explored.  At times, Pleasance seems to communicate
that if he can sell his entire production capacity in the UK, he
will do so with no second thoughts.

This is unacceptable.  I suggest that anyone with ANY sort of contact
with Commodore UK, Pleasance, Proudfoot, CEI, Samsung, Amstrad, or even
can write to a magazine make it VERY clear to ANY interested party that
the Amiga community has suffered through selective and/or widespread
neglect for long enough and that it will not be tolerated under any new
regime.  Better to kill us quickly.

Enjoy the magazine, and try not to get too upset.

AR Mailing List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report
in UUENCODED form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put
on the list, send Email to listserv@bbs.xnet.com and in the body of
the message put:

ADD <mailaddress> armag

ie: ADD rniles@goofy.com armag

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an
intact copy. For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming
messages.

Joining the Amiga Report Coverdisk list is just as easy, but REQUIRES
that your mail site be able to handle messages in excess of 600k.
Place the following in the body of a message to listserv@bbs.xnet.com:

ADD <mailaddress> ardisk

ie: ADD rniles@goofy.com ardisk

Many thanks to X-Net Information Systems for setting this service up
for us!

** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!

                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
World Wide Web
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AR can also be read with Mosaic (in either AmigaGuide or html form).
Reading AmigaReport with Mosaic removes the necessity to download it.
It can also be read using programs found in UNIX sites such as LYNX.

Simply tell Mosaic to open the following URL:
http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/People/mjw/Computer/Amiga/AR/MainPage.html

Mosaic for the Amiga can be found on Aminet in directory comm/net, or
(using anonymous ftp) on max.physics.sunysb.edu

Mosaic for X, Macintosh(tm) and Microsoft Windows(tm) can be found on
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu


                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Aminet
~~~~~~
To get Amiga Report from Aminet, simply FTP to any Aminet site, CD
to docs/mags. All the back issues are located there as well.
(ftp.cdrom.com or ftp.wustl.edu are two sites)

UUEncoding/Decoding (thanks to Bob Tomasevich for the quick tutorial)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is uuencoding and uudecoding?
----------------------------------
uuencoding is converting a binary file into text (ASCII) which can be
sent through mail or Usenet.  uudecoding is reversing the process
(e.g. converting the file back to binary).


Why would I want to do this?
----------------------------
You have to send a binary file to a user who does not have
FTP access, or the user is too lazy to FTP the file.


What is the normal procedure?
-----------------------------
1. Convert the binary file into ASCII, using uuencode.
2. Send the file, through email, to the user.
3. The person on the receiving end gets the email, which may
   be split into parts.  If the email is split into parts, the
   parts must be combined, in the order received, into one file.
4. Receiving person converts the file back into binary, using uudecode.


What does a uuencoded file look like?
-------------------------------------
The start always has:

    begin 644 <encoded file's name>

So, for the file happy-happy-joy-joy.txt, it would look like:

    begin 644 happy-happy-joy-joy.txt

The encoded file begins right after:

M1TE&.#=A@`+@`9<````$`*QB15=2.+&/@R(Y)XM8.=J]H+*%7BL6#8]F6EP_]
M*$=E5"L?L-Z8A-:#60\@$,9P27-4-YB#;4HY)U!L9KZNE\O"O["#;8]82SDF>
M&[%J4FI',.&:E`48#="4@SE41M61<R`@%R$\,9:.?&!Z=NWM_\V';H-D1TI`=

.. more lines like the above ..

M>(`)N(`-^(`1.($5>($9N($=^($A.((E>((IN((M^((Q.(,U>(,YN(,]^(-!+
&V"\"`@`[&
``
end              <-- the end of the encoded file
size 151341      <-- size of the original file


So, how would I do this on the Amiga?
-------------------------------------
There are many uuencode/decode variants out there, but most usually
have kept the old UNIX command line, which can be confusing to novices,
or, require you to remove all mail headers and other, non-uuencoded text.

Luckily, Asher Feldman took the time to write UUxt.


What is UUxT?
-------------
It is a program which performs both the uuencode/decode operations in
one executable, AND, can also pack/unpack LhA archives.


Tell me more.
-------------
The UUxT archive contains UUxT, the CLI version, and UUxtGUI, the
Workbench interface.  I will give a short summary of how to use
both.  Detailed instructions are included in the UUxT archive.

  CLI Version:
  ------------

  Running UUxT without any options gives the following:

     UUxT Version 2.1a Copyright (c)1993 Asher Feldman
     USAGE: UUxT [option] [archive name] <LhA archive name> <file(s)>
     options: a - encode           l - LhAencode
              x - decode           u - LhAdecode

  showing the format of the command line and the valid options.


  Some example command lines:

  1. Normal encoding - UUxt a filename.uue filename-to-archive

  2. Normal decoding - UUxt x filename.uue

  3. LhA archiving and encoding -

            UUxT l filename.uue filename.lha file1 file2 ...

  4. Decoding and LhA unarchiving - UUxT u filename.uue

  For LhA encoding and decoding, you will need LhA by Stefan Boberg.

  (1) Clicking on this brings up a requester to select the file you want
      to perform the operation shown in gadget (5).

  (2) You can manually type here the filename of the file affected by the
      operation indicated in gadget (5).

  (3) Used only for encoding, brings up a requester to select where the
      encoded file should go.  Selecting an existing file will cause the
      existing file to be replaced by the encoded file.  You can also use
      this requester to create directories.

  (4) You can manually type the filename of the file to be the encoded file.

  (5) The operation to perform on file shown in (2).  The operations are
      the four provided by UUxT (uuencode/uudecode/LhAEncode/LhADecode).

  (6) The name of the archive created with the LhAEncode option.  Ignored
      when any other operation is selected.

  (7) Does the encode/decode/LhAEncode/LhADecode and pops up a requester
      indicating if the operation was successful or not.


I need this!  Where can I get it?
---------------------------------
If you use the Internet from a local BBS, you may find it there.  If not
you can FTP it from wuarchive.wustl.edu, in the directory

                          pub/aminet/arc/UUxT.lha

It should also be on the Aminet mirrors.


Thanks for the explanation!  How can I reach you if I have questions?

Late-Breaking News!  Commodore US Liquidation Sale!

Thursday, September 8, at 10 AM, liquidation will commence on Commodore
US.  For a free brochure, contact Ross-Dove Co., Inc. at:

A message from Amiga World's editor:
------------------------------------

August 16. No Commodore Deal Yet.

While rumors abound that David Pleasance's Commodore UK Management Buy-out
was a done deal, that's not the case. We talked with Pleasance last night
in London, and he doesn't expect a decision until the end of the first week
of September. His bid is in, his financial backing is in order, and he
makes his final presentation this week in the US before the liquidators and
Commodore's creditors.

He is, however, very confident that his bid will carry a lot of weight
because it is for the entire company and product line--not solely for the
technology, or a portion of the inventory, or for part of the operation.
However, CEI, Samsung, Philips, and maybe one or two others are still in
the picture, so it will be a few more weeks before any decision is made.

On another matter: AmigaWorld has taken some hits lately because the size
of the magazine has shrunk over the last few issues. No kidding?
Everyone--most notably the developers and vendors who advertise in our
pages--is stressed out over the Commodore liquidation. Most are holding
their wallets pretty tight and reluctant to invest their advertising
dollars until this situation gets resolved.

When advertising dwindle, so do the editorial pages. Overspending your
budget for three or four issues in a row during times like these is akin to
financial suicide. Since AmigaWorld plans to be around for a good long
while, we have to avoid those kinds of mistakes. Nobody, including us,
likes to be in this position--but if you want to be around in the long run,
you have to endure the lean times with the fat.

When the dust settles and things start moving again in the Amiga market,
we'll be able to quickly beef up the size of the book. Lets hope Mr.
Pleasance or another pro-Amiga group like his gets things rolling again
soon. When that happens, AmigaWorld is committed to help the new owners
jumpstart the process.

          Three-Way Merger Creates Desktop Video "Super Company"


        August 17th, Sacramento, CA - A merger between three desktop video
pioneers was announced today.  The companies are Digital Creations, Progressive
Image Technology, and a group of eight senior staff members who left Video
Toaster maker NewTek earlier this year.  Working seperately the three groups
launched and dominated the successful desktop video market on the Amiga
computer.  By joining forces the companies have set their sights on redefining
the desktop video market for PC compatible computers.

The new company, Play Incorporated,will be headed by Mike Moore as Chairman,
Paul Montgomery, as President, and John Botteri, as CEO.  "Between the three
groups we've shipped over 50 products" said Botteri, "Each of us has dominated
in our own area: hardware, software, and marketing.  Together, we will be the
leader in PC video."

The Progressive Image Technology team, led by Mike Moore and including former
Grass Valley Group engineering talent, began creating hardware for personal
computer in 1978.  Progressive has been a pioneer in computer video since the
early eighties when they engineered desktop video products for both IBM and
Apple.  Since then Progressive has designed many successful video peripherals
including video effects hardware, overlay cards, genlocks, digitizers, and time
base correctors.

Digital Creations, headed by John Botteri, has been a leader in video
applications on the Amiga since 1986.  In addition to marketing and writing the
applications software for all of Progressive's desktop video products, Digital
Creations developed three breakthrough video paint systems.  Exploiting the
expertise in real-time graphics, Digital also created several award-winning
entertainment titles for Electronic Arts.

The group from NewTek includes former Vice-President Paul Montgomery as well as
NewTek's former directors of sales, marketing, and software development.  The
group also includes key software engineers from the Emmy-award winning Toaster
team and Kiki Stockhammer, the industry's best-known spokesperson.  "Helping
create the Video Toaster and with it the desktop video industry, was a
fantastic seven year adventure," commented Montgomery, "Now we've found the
perfect partners to take the desktop video revolution to the next level".  Play
is owned entirely by its employees and is debt-free.  The new company is based
in Sacramento, California and will begin shipping the first of its PC video
products within 90 days.

And, it wouldn't quite be an Amiga magazine these days without the obligatory
message from Mr. Pleasance.  Reprinted from CU Amiga.

COMMODORE WRITES

As you might have gathered, things have been pretty hectic here recently.
In case you've been living on Mars for the last few weeks and havenn't
heard, Colin Proudfoot and myself are heading up a team busy working on a
management buy-out of Commodore.

If we succeed, and I'm very confident that we will, this means that there
will be a new, UK-based team manufacturing and selling the Amiga. We'll be
independent - ie no American parent - and we'll be benefiting from
investment from some of the UK's biggest financial institutions.

Why am I confident we'll succeed?

Well, we've managed to satisfy the liquidators of Commodore International
that we've got financial support. And now they've got to make up their
minds whether to recommend our bid or someone else's. But we're pretty
sure they'll go with us. Either way, we should know by the end of August.

Good news so far. But:

Can we supply Amigas in time for Christmas?

It will be tight, for sure. But if our bid is successful, we'll be
manufacturing in the UK which means we can press the button immediately we
know we've won the bid. And because we haven't got to ship product halfway
round the world anymore, we are confident in getting products to the shops
just at the right time to take advantage of the expected high level of
demand that Christmas promises.

What about software?

Software publishers never release much at this time of year which is
traditionally quiet for the games business. But they've been amazingly
supportive of the management buyout (MBO) and are even more supportive of
the Amiga 1200 and CD32. They know it's a big business. And they'll be
launching plenty of new titles in the run up to Christmas. I expect the
first announcements to be made at the ECTS trade show in early September.

What about the high-end Amigas?

Here the message is 'don't believe everything you hear'. The MBO team is
100 percent committed to the Amiga 4000. It's far and away the best
machine for specialist users and knocks spots off the competition as a
multimedia platform. PLUS, it's a really low-cost development platform -
particularly for CD32 titles. So not only will we be pushing it very
hard, we'll be devoting plenty of R&D resources to growing this end of
our range. Which brings me on to:

Future products - will there be any?

We don't need telling you that without R&D and new products coming
downstream there isn't a long-term future for the business. Lew
Eggebrecht - the guy who's been responsible for most of the Amiga's
recent technological strides - has reconfirmed that a team of experienced
Amiga engineers based in the states have some wonderful new products at
various stages of development. You will not be disappointed.

Will we have enough money to promote the Amiga range?

Again, we know that all this is no good if no one knows what's going on.
So we've ensured that we've built a comprehensive marketing budget into
the plans for new business. That means you'll be seeing us at three
shows between now and Christmas: Live '94 at Earls Court in September,
The Motor Show at the NEC in Birmingham in October and last, but
certainly not least, at the European World of Amiga at Wembley in
November. Plus, we'll be advertising as usual and making sure you've all
got plenty of chances to win equipment and software in the press and TV.

I hope I've given you a brief look into what we're planning. Of course, I
really hope that the MBO succeeds and that we're around running the new
company and making sure the Amiga continues to be the only choice for
right thinking people everywhere.

But rest assured. Even in the extremely unlikely event that we don't pull
it off and Commodore ceases to exist, the Amiga won't die - especially
with people like you to support it. It's bigger than Commodore and bigger
than any new company we run. There are a lot of you out there. About five
million loyal and devoted fans. And there are a lot of Amiga titles -
about 4,000. And there are a lot of Amiga-specific magazines - about
600,000 copies are sold a month. And that doesn't include all the
manufacturers of peripherals, the servicing agents and so on.

It's a huge industry. And it will go on regardless.

But you can't get rid of me that easily- I'm confident that I'll be
celebrating when I write again in September.

Wish us luck!

PRODUCT NAME

        "Greek Workbench"
        (The actual product name is in Greek.)


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

        WorkBench 2.1 plus all extensions such that any Workbench supporting
locale is totally localized in Greek. A lot of supporting tools.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

        Name:           AC Software Engineering
        Author:         Kostas Tsaousis
        Address:        Themistokleous 84B Nikaia 184 52 Athens GREECE
        Telephone:      4962494

LIST PRICE

        8.000 drx. (Greek currency)
        I bought it on Jan 84, so pricing might have changed.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE
                Kickstart 37.175+

        SOFTWARE

                None (Other than WorkBench 2.04 or above that is expected to
                come with your machine.)


COPY PROTECTION

        Many tools have a popup window that closes automatically after any
action occurs in the Workbench.  The window includes the particulars of the
purchaser. The executables seem to be serialized (multiple serial numbers).
Legal action will be taken against anybody pirating!!

        The program installs on a hard drive.  To install you follow the
same process as installing any Amiga operating system (consult your original
OS manual)

        I rate the protection as annoying, although it's only for some tools.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        Amiga 3000/25, 6 MB Fast RAM, 2 MB Chip RAM.
        1 internal 1.76 HD floppy
        Quantum 240 meg, Maxtor 120 Meg, Quantum 52 Meg internal hard drives.
        Standard VGA monitor.
        AmigaDOS 2.04 (Upgraded to 2.1 with this product)
        AmigaDOS 3.1 (Which I switch to on startup. 3.1 being the default)

        Amiga 500, 4.5 MB Fast RAM, 0.5 MB Chip RAM.
        1 internal 880K floppy.
        Quantum 40 MB internal hard drive.
        GVP Series II controller
        AmigaDOS 2.05 (Upped to 2.1)


INSTALLATION

        As part of the program is the actual WorkBench 2.1, it installs
exactly as Commodore WorkBench 2.1 is installed.


REVIEW

        This product comes in two forms. One is Greek WorkBench 2.1, which
is an eight disk set, and the other a WB 3.0, which is a four disk set.
WorkBench 2.1 is a complete Workbench and is sold to those that want to
upgrade the Workbench to 2.1 as well as have the Greek extra tools. The
WorkBench 3.0 is a four disk set that appears to be only the extensions to
WB 3.0. It is expected that you have WorkBench 3.0 to start with. There is
no difference between the two products. It seems to be a subset of the 2.1
disks. (WB 3.0 specific files included in the 2.1 release.)

        The reason I wanted this product is that I wanted to find out how
the Greek character set was arranged on the Greek Workbench, as well as the
Greek versions of the standard Amiga fonts. I got much more than I bargained
for. Even though I mostly use 3.1, the 2.1 version works well under 3.1.

        Given there are two major components to this product I will
concentrate only on the Greek extension rather than Workbench 2.1.  All that
I will say about WorkBench 2.1 is that it introduces locale. It allows you
to make your Amiga environment use any language you wish (and is
supported).  The only other point to note is the inclusion of the narrator
device and the speak program in this version. It appears to be the latest,
and the last version included in any Workbench. It looks much nicer than the
one included in WB 2.04 having only one window to type in the spoken words.
It appears that normal WB 2.1 didn't even include a narrator device.

        The extra diskettes that have Greek names include updates to the
Workbench that can be installed in both WB 2.1 and 3.1. They are a variety
of tools. After the full installation, all menus appear in Greek. The error
command in the Shell, the requesters, and virtually everything on the
Workbench is totally in Greek. It appears to be a very detailed job.  It's
an unfamiliar environment as there is an argument among all non-English
speaking countries:  should technical terms be translated or transliterated?
A lot of terms tend to be very long, as it seems a direct translation ends up
being a long word compared to the familiar few letter words in English. To
me the locale was a novelty that wore off pretty quick. I was not
disappointed though as that's not what I wanted from the package, and
English is more natural to me when it comes to technical terms.

        There are many other tools that assist in using the Greek language
in conjunction with the English language. First, note the peculiarity of the
Greek language. The Greek character set is almost totally different from the
English one. As a result, the current solution for using Greek was to use a
Symbol font. The problem with that was that I wanted accents, as well as the
fact the font selection was limited.  I wanted to swap from English to Greek
the way the Macintosh achieves it. That is by pressing Command-Space you can
flick between Greek <-> English keyboard. In the Amigas case, with the use of
a commodity, Amiga-space-bar achieves the same result.  The Greek characters
are encoded in the high 128 positions of the ASCI set.  There are also other
commodities that configure the Amiga depending on what keyboard is active.
Menu keys are mapped such that while in Greek mode, all keyboard short-cuts
are still available. For example, typing Amiga-C would copy a selected item
to the clipboard. While the Greek keyboard is active, what you would actually
be pressing is Amiga-Psi, a Greek character.  It all works great though. It's
supported by all programs; i.e., PageStream and excellence!

        In my WBStartup I have:

        MenuMapSwapper, so that short-cut keys are swapped.
        KeyMapSwapper, so that the KeyMap is swapped.
        MenuKeySwapper, so that menu keys are swapped.
        MenumapAnalyser, a tool that shows the complete character set such
        that any character can be selected and the key combination to get to
        it is shown.

        In the package are many printer drivers. They are the same Amiga
printer drives but they include an Elot standard as that appears to be the
IBM standard character set for Greek printers. I am not sure if this is part
of the AmigaDOS 2.1 package in Greece or the Software Engineering package.

        Also included is a program that can convert documents from different
character arrangements that are written in Greek. Along with it are included
many different filters.  Another program converts file names written in
Greek by another standard to the current one.

        Looking into my L:filesystem_transl/ directory, I found the following
extra files among the standard Amiga files. I don't know how to use them
other than they are used by CrossDOS and are selectable by a configuration
screen in CrossDOS.

                GrIBM.crossdos
                GrMAC.crossdos
                GrWindows.crossdos

        The standard bitmap fonts like topazgr, perlgr, rubygr and the
others have Greek characters in the high ASCI 128 positions, otherwise they
are the standard Amiga fonts. With the use of the FF program the system is
patched such that all programs that insist on using topaz can use the Greek
font topazgr in them. Also included are the following fonts for popular
application programs:

                dpaint.font     (Deluxepaint 4)
                Scala.font      (Scala)
                SWScrFontA      (FinalCopy)
                SWScrFontB      (FinalCopy)

        Also included are two Compugraphic fonts, CSTimesGR and
CSTimesTrimvirateGR.  They are not as good quality as the original CSTimes
and CSTriumvirate.


DOCUMENTATION

        The documentation is neat, written in Greek from cover to cover. I
didn't get the WorkBench 2.1, manuals but the WorkBench 2.1 software is
included with the permission of Commodore Greece. There is no index but
there are only 29 pages I hardly read. I preferred to work my way through it
as I am familiar with Workbench.


LIKES

        It's a great value for money. Considering the small market, a lot of
professional effort has gone into the design of the product. Tools conform
to the style guide. The labels and the manual are nice. There are many
different tools in it.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

        The protection ... oh that protection. Upon start-up I get a small
window opening up noting my name and passport number. The reason being that
is they wanted my ID number to serialize my copy, I only had a passport
number. Well I needed it, I gave it to them :-) But the window vanishes
immediately. Greek locale and the keyboard should have been supplied by
Commodore Greece. As the equivalent is done so by Macintosh Greece for free.
I have no complaints though as it was good value for money.

        A little complaint is the box it comes in. It's just a VHS video
casing. It sort of loses some of the professional look it deserves.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        I have not used and I don't know of any other such product on the
Amiga.  Although there should be for other languages. On the Macintosh
computer I have used a patch that swaps the keyboard and works with Amax II
very well. I know of a Greek desktop for the Macintosh (I am comparing Greek
computer interfaces here) It should work just as well although I don't think
it has the power of local. There also exists a Greek Windows 3.1.


BUGS

        None found. Only one not directly related with the product. The FF
program included (and available in PD) that patches the system to change the
original topaz font does not work in 3.1.


VENDOR SUPPORT

        I have had no reason to contact the vendor. It's a long distance
call to Greece which I don't think I will be doing.  I have had no need,
though.


WARRANTY

        30 days on the magnetic media.


CONCLUSIONS

        I am very impressed by this product. It does much more than I wanted
so I am pleased. I give it a rating to 4 out of 5. An extra 1/2 would be
given if it wasn't for the copy protection. I do understand it though as
Greece is quite notorious for piracy.

as he pleases. My guess is PD but he can make money out of it if he wishes.

[Hey kids, I finally upgraded my aging 2000HD to a nice fast 3000/25.  In
purchasing this new machine, I also had to find a monitor.  From the
incredible choice in Toronto, I personally feel the CMC-1501 is the best
value for your Amiga spending dollar.  But don't take my word for it, check
it out for yourself.  I assume no responsibility for people buying a
monitor they themselves don't like.]

Introduction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Looking for a monitor is downright annoying.  Commodore has a few,
of decent quality, but there is such variety in the PC SVGA market.  Why
not buy a monitor made for a PC?  Visiting the electronic superstores and
the like, there are a multitude of choices.  There's quite a range: Cheap
ones from strange manufacturers whose names you can't pronounce, and nice
ones from big names like NEC and Sony.  Feature for feature, price for
price, the Daewoo 15" is difficult to beat.

        I intended to use the monitor for a flickerfixed 3000.  Note the
warning about EGS type graphic boards at the end of this article.  In the
last month or so, DayTek Canada, the Canadian branch of Daewoo, has
introduced the Daytek 1501, which also has the added benefit of the EPA's
EnergyStar compliancy.

        This monitor is perfect for owners of A3000's, A2320 deinterlacers,
and EGS boards.

Specifications:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Daewoo 15" (260x190mm) FlatScreen Monitor
        MPR II Emission Compliant
        AntiGlare Etched

        Analog RGB Type (SVGA)
        50-90Hz vertical scan rate
        31-60KHz horizontal scan rate
        1024x768NI maximum resolution

Price:
~~~~~~
$490-500 Canadian

Platforms Used for Testing:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Commodore Amiga 3000/25
68030-25 / ECS Denise, Agnus and Amber
4 MB of RAM / 52 MB HD
Kickstart 2.04 / 2.1
Onboard deinterlacer (A2320 Type)

A2300 NTSC Genlock
A2088 XT Bridgeboard
Supra SupraRAM 2000/2

It Weighs A Ton and Looks Ugly:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The first thing I noticed about all the Daewoo SVGA monitors is
that they all look ugly.  If you've seen the new IBM monitors with the wide
bezel or the new NEC Multisync 3GFx's, it's very much like that.  The
colour is that olivy-white complexion, like Brent Spiner's face in Star
Trek.  The monitor also is quite large and heavy-it is noticeably more
volumous than my original 1084S or 14" SVGA monitor.  This is most likely
due to the added 15" dimension.  It looks decent ontop of my 3000, but
seems more styled to fit a PC.  A store demo unit ontop of a IBM
ValuePoint, confirmed this.

        It's tolerable though, and the monitor itself is near perfect.  I
wish clone and other less well known companies would spend the money to
design nice cases for their products-it would make them much more
attractive to potential buyers.

The Manual:
~~~~~~~~~~~
        The manual, a torrid 18 page affair, is filled with wonderful
English like this:

        "2) The Way of Adjustment
         When you want to adjust the screen, please Refer to No.1-No.12
         of ninth and tenth page."

        You'd figure a nice monitor made in Korea by a multinational
corporation should at least be able to pay a nice guy to write a proper
manual that one can read through without laughing.  The content of the
manual, grammar aside, is quite good.  It guides you through attaching,
configuring and installing the monitor.  Plenty of useful specifications
are availible for tinkerers.  Cute little cartoons in the front to amuse
you about safety precautions.

Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        A detachable three prong machine type power cord was supplied as
was a fixed 15 pin DB-15HD VGA connector.  The VGA connector plugged into
the A3000's Deinterlacer out port, and was screwed in place.  The monitor
was placed on top of the 3000's case.  The weight did not pose a major
problem, but one should remember to keep the case tightly screwed on to
maintain rigidity.

        On boot up, via the ScreenMode pref panel, the A3000 was set to
NTSC:HiResInterLaced (640x400) and the Overscan was adjusted to fit as
large as possible.  Shifting and enlarging of the image was handled through
the CMC-1501BA's front panel digital controls.  Other controls include
Brightness, Contrast, and Pincushion.  The Factory Reset button is right
next to the control Select button, which made it easily pressed during mode
setting.  Quite annoying, since I pressed it at least three times by
accident during setup.

        Some strange lines, were noticed during configuration.  They
flew across the screen and wrapped around.  Changing the Overscan prefs
removed them.  However, they appeared later on in other screen modes.
Removal of the A2300 Genlock remedied this problem.  Genlocks tend to
affect the synchronization of any Amiga system.

        In general, installation and configuration of the monitor was
simple and quite easy.

Safety and Health:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The Daewoo 15" complies with Swedish government MPR-II regulations.
It's low radiation, which supposedly means you won't die of some strange
cancer or stop having children.  Seriously, because of the larger screen
size, I find myself less inclined to look closer at the monitor, which
means less radiation hits me when I'm near the screen in the first place.
The display is rather pleasing and doesn't hurt my eyes.  At least not yet.

Performance and Image Quality:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The picture quality is excellent.  Images are very bright and
contrast well on this monitor.  The maximum resolution I can pull without
touching the top line of overscan screen is 720x480 Interlaced (via the
OverScan Prefs).  The display doesn't seem as detailed as the Sony Trinitron
tubes I've seen attached to Macintoshes, but that's mainly because the Mac
doesn't use a four colour desktop.

        Running PC Emulation via AmigaJanus showed no problems, and neither
did any other software.  Certain dot patterns, like the ones used by
Workbench's WBPattern, which have repetition of dots in a checkboard
pattern, cause moire lines.  This is common to all monitors, and lines
aside, did not affect the flicker free output.  Moire patterns did not show
up in dithering screens either.  Only in the repetitious ones.  Text is
visible and crisp at all resolutions.

        Publishing and graphic applications worked extremely well with the
Daewoo and fonts and drawings were clean and clear.  The added physical
screen size makes looking at your pages easier.  Digitized graphics from
paint programs were clean.  Good colour reproduction and uniform
brightness.  One unique aspect was the warmth of certain colours, much like
the familiar Commodore 1084S line.  The red and oranges come out vibrant,
instead of the pale look of other VGA type monitors.

        The best advice I can give you, though, is to visit a dealer and examine
the monitor yourself. Bring your Amiga there too, and show typical images that
you will be working on, or run applications you frequently use during the course
of a day.  Don't let them show some dumb pictures of smiling women, monkeys and
bowls of fruit-make sure they will let you see real world displays, which
is what you're paying for.  Also remember to bring a test pattern of fine
lines and a grid to test for pincushioning and proper alignment.

Modes, Modes, Modes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        NTSC and PAL running through the Deinterlacer ran perfectly, since
the Daewoo can sync to 50 Hz and 60 Hz vertical for these two modes.  With
the deinterlacer disabled, the 15.75 KHz signal scattered the display-the
monitor will not sync down to 15.75 KHz horizontal for normal NTSC
displays.  This means it is not ideal for A500, 600, 1200, 2000 and 4000 users
without A2320 boards or EGS boards.  Any 15 KHz mode was converted via the
deinterlacer on, and any 31 KHz mode was passed through.   Pure 15 KHz
screen modes from standard Amigas without deinterlacers will not work with
the Daewoo.

        31 KHz modes like MultiScan:Productivity, Euro:36 and
DoubleNTSC/PAL worked perfectly, and the Daewoo quickly resynced to each
one as modes were switched.  The digital controls made it easy to readjust
the display for each mode.

        The only mode that would not run was Super72, the 800x600 mode,
which requires a monitor to sync at 24 KHz.  The deinterlacer could
not/will not convert a 24 Khz signal into 31 KHz, only 15 KHz ones.  It
just passed it through, and the Daewoo will not scan so low.  The lack of
Super72 was not a big loss, since the Overscan NTSC:HiResLaced comes very
close to matching the same resolution.

Stuff I Like About This Monitor:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Big 15" Screen          -I can see my work from across the room.  No squinting.

Image Quality           -A good solid display. Uniform colour reproduction.

Digital Controls        -Big plus.  Very friendly.  Very convenient.
and Memory

Emission Control        -I feel safer in front of this thing.  It may not be worth
                         anything, but at least I can be comforted with the label
                         on the front, proclaiming it's low radiation.

Pincushioning Control   -Very professional feature.  A good idea too, even on a
                         flat screen.

Flat Screen             -Very little glare on the face of the monitor.

Tilt and Swivel Base    -Easy to move and reposition monitor.

Stuff I Don't Like About This Monitor:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SVGA Sync Only          -The monitor doesn't sync down to 15 KHz, the optimum
                         for any Amiga.  However, A3000 users won't care, and
                         neither will graphic board owners.  This is not
                         Daewoo's fault-the market doesn't need a 15 Khz scan
                         monitor.

Ugly Design             -Compared to Sony's or Apple's designs, the Daewoo
                         is ugly.  But who cares, it's the display that
                         counts.

Warranty                -Only a year, and limited.  This is the norm for
                         all monitors, except the NEC MultiSync at 3 years.

Slow Warm-Up            -The Daewoo takes a while to come to full brightness.
                         It's colours are all screwed up (far too yellow and
                         lacking in contrast) until it warms up.  This takes
                         about five seconds or so.
A Warning:
~~~~~~~~~~
        The CMC-1501BA has trouble with my dealer's EGS type
graphic boards.  It's specifications seem to be perfect for one, but this
monitor has been found incompatible with GVP's EGS Spectrum and other
cards.  The 17" Daewoo, seems to work perfectly with the EGS Spectrum and
has a rock solid, high quality display.  Also, ICD's AdFFV board seems to
have trouble as well.  Make sure you test your system out before buying.
Bring your Amiga to the store and test it with the monitor.

        Actually after we found this monitor to be defective (read below),
it might have been that one particular unit.  Nonetheless, test before you
buy.

Oh no!  I'm a chair! Have a nice umbrella!

        A week and a half after my Daewoo was connected to the Amiga 3000,
it fried.  Yes, big frying.  Like zzzt! sounds.  It was returned to the
shop which I purchased it at and sent to DayTek Canada, where it staed for
over a month.  While at the Comdex Canada 94 trade show, I spoke with a
manager of DayTek casually.  He said that the usual turnaround time is
about a week.  DayTek sent me a brand new unit and the new unit is working
perfectly.

Conclusion:
~~~~~~~~~~~
        The Daewoo CMC-1501BA is a superb monitor for A3000 users, as well
as anyone else who needs a high resolution graphic display.  It has great
specs for sync and resolution, and it's performance is near perfect.  The
digital controls are fun and useful, with the small annoyance of the Reset
button being next to the Select button.  Overall, it's a fine monitor.

By the way, Daewoo is pronounced Day-woo.

%%  Review: CD Exchange Volume 1                  By: @{" Jason Compton " link P8-1}     %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

CD Exchange, much like Micro R+D (keep reading the magazine), were hit with
a stroke of brilliance when they named this disc, a fully-Workbench-bootable
compilation of quite a bit of stuff.

Fully bootable?  Oh yes.  1.3, 2.1, and 3.0 are included, meaning that just
about everybody can take advantage of it.  What's "it"?  A strong assortment
of games, animations (LOTS of animations.  LOTS.), pictures, fonts, mods,
sounds (most of the sounds are rather ridiculous, like "Ooohaaaah" and
various renditions of "Yeah" and "Hey") and even some utilities and
"useful" programs.

The material is laid out in a fairly orderly fashion on the disc, or if
you like and have an AGA machine, you can use the included "multimedia"
menus.  I recommend you don't.  They're slow, sometimes run the wrong scripts,
and are in general unnecessary.  Good idea, poor implementation, you're
better off just scrolling through the material and finding whatever you
like.  Particularly bad are the picture viewers...pick a category and
be forced to see every picture in the directory like a slideshow.  Not
abortable from CD32 joypad, as far as I can tell.

I'm actually pretty impressed by the collection that has been put
together...of course, you can always look at a directory and say, "Well,
why did they leave Progam X off the disc?  It would have been PERFECT
here!", and I've done it myself.  And there are some stinkers, but that's
inevitable.  Overall, though, the compilation was well thought-out.

The animations alone kept me clicking for 90 straight minutes, and I
didn't nearly get through all of them.  (Some are choppy since they're
being loaded, in my case, from a 300k/sec drive, but there are ways
around that, and ParNet is included on the disc).  Some demos even show
up, mostly in compressed form, which I find to be a nice bonus.

As a CD32 boot disk, it does the job...sort of.  NTSC users will need
to switch to PAL in order to quit the autobooting "multimedia" menu
system.  A nice touch is that the CD32 joypad mouse emulator supports
the blue button as the right mouse button, something that Lock 'n Load's
program neglects to do.

I'm happy with this CD once I quit from the menu system.  That's gotta
go, and will hopefully have improved if there is a CDEx Volume 2.
Right now, CDEx is working on Makin' Music, a music/sound oriented
CD-ROM for the Amiga, IBM, and Mac (all on one CD).

%%  ShaREview:  Pete W. Storonskij's Works      By: @{" Jason Compton " link P8-1}      %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Reviewed:  Mangled Fenders, Incinerator, Checkers Conquest

About a month ago, Mr. Storonskij sent me three of his shareware creations.

I played them and played them, but kept putting off reviews.  Here they
come...

Mangled Fenders is a demolition-derby style car game: a bash-up to the
death (well, to the explosion) of six vehicles, which can be controlled
in a wide variety of ways if you've got a bunch of friends over dying to
get in the action.  The better you do (i.e. blowing up later in the match,
or winning outright), the more money you get, and there is an assortment
of upgrades for your vehicle.  Power-ups appear on the playfield while
the cars are bashing each other up, which, along with the fast gameplay,
give Mangled Fenders an arcade feel.

There is a rather important detail missing from the spartan documentation,
though...apparently, demolition derby drivers back into their opponents,
because driving head-on at them is more likely to damage you than them.
This becomes painfully obvious as you land blows, hoping to take out
your opponent, only to watch your damage meter get worse...

The graphics and sound are functional and give enough atmosphere to the
game to make it playable, but are far from revolutionary.  Overall,
a good deal for the money, as Storonskij doesn't ask much.  Fun is the
operative word here, and it IS fun to slam into other people.

Incinerator:

I didn't have a lot of luck with Incinerator.  Essentially, it's like what
Missile Command would be if you could shoot back at the other guys in
turn, much like a strategy game.  The graphics are 3D, and are not bad
for a $5 shareware fee.

My main problem with the game is that it seems to play itself no matter
what I do (and no, I'm not watching a demo!)  I'm not surprised that I
can't find more info in the documentation, as there's only 4k of it..

This idea could have grabbed me if I had the faintest clue what was
going on.  It's tough to find out, though.

Checkers Conquest:

A very, very pretty game.  Seriously.  Even if you're not a checkers
freak, this is a worthwhile program to take a look at.  The board
and pieces, while 2-D topdown view, are very pretty.  The game has
just about every feature a Checkers match can have and is pleasant
to the eye at the same time.

Of course, it's not an innovative concept, but the implementation
is very good.  For a lousy $3, if you play Checkers at all, you owe
CC to yourself.


The Upshot:

Pete has put together some decent games at a combined price better
than attending most amusement parks.  What more can you ask for?

Looks like we have another stumper here. After a few entries had been
received, all of them came up with the same answer, which is no where near
what I am looking for. But I assure you that if you figure out how to win,
I will answer immediately!


    - THE PRIZE FOR NEXT MONTH -

CONTEST BEGINS: 7-29-94
CONTEST ENDS: 8-26-94

The Amiga Report contest is still going on, and it is not too
late to enter. This ongoing monthly contest allows Amiga Report
readers a chance to win software by either solving a puzzle or by
entering a random drawing.

The prize this month is the Amiga/Toaster Reference Manual v2.221,
from Area52. This is a 1,000 page help system for the Amiga and Video
Toaster, covering the Workbench, AmigaDOS, Lightwave, and more ($34.95).
The second prize choice is the FutureShock audio CDROM,  which was
produced using Amiga computers by SideWinder. There are some Sidewinder
music modules on Aminet that you may want to look at for a sample of
the audio CD ($12.95).
Another possible prize is SubVersion, a strategy submarine hunt
game by Point of View Computing. Both a Mac and IBM version is included
along with the Amiga version.
We have also been offered some AMINET CD-ROMs and some database
software which have not arrived yet.

Previously we have offered the ARexx Reference Disk by Merrill
Callaway, which was awarded to a previous winner. Contact Whitestone
for more information (505) 268-0678. More prizes will be announced
as they become available.

All monthly contests end on the morning of the first of the
following month. Any entries beyond this date will be entered into the
next contest. In the event that you were announced as a winner and
did not receive your prize, please contact me by email.


- THE MONTHLY DRAWING -

To enter the random drawing, select a number from 1 to 262,144
and send it to me at one of my addresses listed below, either by
the postal service or email through the Internet.
Also, you may enter by solving the following puzzle. The winner
of this puzzle will be decided within the same time frame as the
random prize, to allow the contest information to filter through the
networks, and to allow your letters and postcards to come in.


- THE PUZZLE -

Since people complained that the first contest was too hard, and
that the second was too easy, I made one that anyone can solve with
a little thought. The third problem should have been obvious... the
first word was as big of a push in the right direction as you could
get. Now we will try a more mathematical problem, which is very easy
to solve. If you are not too familiar with matrix manipulations, just
look for the right resources and you will find all the help you need
(help is everywhere!). Of course, this is another one of those trick
problems.

There are two matrices, A and B. Each matrix will have a
value applied to it, and you must determine the answer. The
value is specified by x, and the answers you must provide are
Ax = ?, and Bx = ?.

x = (151647 - 61615)

    [ 7 8 9 ]       [ 1 2 3 ]
A = [ 4 5 6 ]   B = [ 4 5 6 ]
    [ 1 2 3 ]       [ 7 8 9 ]
    [ 0 0 0 ]       [ 0 0 0 ]

What does Ax equal, and what does Bx get you? Also provide
your method of obtaining the answer. I understand that there
may be cultural differences for this problem... not all math is
the same (you should see how my mother does long division!). So
just make a good guess ::heh heh::. With a little research, you
can determine the answers. You may want to look for information
on matrix multiplication.
As a special bonus, the first person to successfully supply the
correct answer will automatically win. If you feel that you
definitely have the answer, get in touch with me with what you have
learned. If you do everything correctly, I will answer to let
you know :).

As an additional clue, the x value has a special code in it that has
to do with area.


- TO ENTER -

To enter, simply let your fingers do the talking and write an
email and send it to dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu. You MUST put
the word CONTEST in the subject line of the email header! Otherwise
you run the risk of having your email deleted (don't ask, it is a
long story!) or send a post card or letter to:

Amiga Report Contest
c/o David Tiberio
6 Lodge Lane
East Setauket, NY 11733

Is it possible to win via snail mail? You might think that your
chances of winning are better by entering in email (much faster of
course), but last month's winner send in a letter that arrived the
day before his winning number was drawn!

In your letter or email, please provide the following:

Your full name and address. Please keep in mind that many of
you may have addresses that I am not accustomed to, so please include
your country or any other information that I would need in case you
win. An email address should also be included, if possible.

You must also include a brief one sentence overview of the editorial
in this issue of AMiga Report. Just to make sure you are reading it. :)
You must also include the issue number. For example, if you read this in
AR213, then include that in your correspondance. Also, a prize winner
will be determined by a random number generator. Choose a number from
1 to 262,144. The closest winner or winners to the randomly generated
number will receive the prize in the mail. Anyone who does not provide
a number will have one assigned to him randomly.

All prizes will be mailed within one week after I get my hands on
the published version of AmigaReport. I am doing this for a few reasons.
First, every winner so far has given the correct puzzle solution before
I have received the editon of AmigaReport that announced it. :)
Second, I don't like to go to the post office every day if I can avoid
it. Third, you never know when someone's power supply might blow up
(right Mr. Editor?!).


- RULES AND REGULATIONS -

1. In the evnt that the editor's power supply fries, the contest for
   that month will have its deadline postponed to a later date, to be
   announced. Any contest entries for the random drawing will be added
   to the next month's drawing, to be held once per month near the
   beginning of the month.

2. All prizes are donated. I cannot be held responsible for any damage
   caused by a prize. For example, if you leave your prize on the
   stairs and your grandmother slips on it, I will not pay her medical
   bills.

3. We are not doing this for any profit, and cannot be held responsible
   if we go out of business or are otherwise financially unable to give
   you anything! We are actively looking for submissions from other
   software authors.

4. Good things come to those who read the rules and regulations! Here
   is a tip to help you win: every problem is a trick problem, or gives
   you clues that are not part of the problem itself. Read the whole
   entire contest entry looking for clues. And read my other articles
   for more clues. I give some very obvious clues :).

5. If for any circumstance you are awarded a prize but do not receive
   it, contact me at (516) 476-1615. I will promptly attend to any
   mistakes that have been made.

6. These rules are subject to change at any time without warning!

7. All entries so far have been using A, and that is why they are wrong!


- THE DISCLAIMER -

DISCLAIMER: This contest is being provided as a service to the
Amiga community and all persons involved in running this contest
cannot be held liable for anything that costs you money or
lifetime pain and anguish. Rules are subject to change. All entries
must be received by whenever TBA. Any entries beyond this date
will be entered into the next contest, if any.


- THE CHANCE YOU WILL WIN -

Odds of winning are approximately 1:50 for the random drawing and
1:15 for the correct answer to the puzzle, based upon current entries.

SPECIAL THANKS to SideWinder for donating the Future Shock albums
for inclusion in our contest, along with Merrill Callaway for his ARexx
Reference Disk!

Just in case Creative Computers was starting to breathe a sigh of
relief...
-----------------------------------------------------------------


To all of you out there who love the Amiga and would like to hear about all
the ups and downs about mail ordering. We all know we can save lots of monies
by mail but, the question here is how much and is it worth the savings? Well,
of course it all depends on who you order from and whether or not their service
is any good or not. I would like to say at this time that for a lousy $5.00 to
$10.00 savings that sometimes it is not. The reason I say this is, I have dealt
just dealt with CREATIVE COMPUTER and boy was it a mistake! At least for the
service and the time consumption. Nevertheless, the thought of loosing $160.00
I have read the past article about Creative Computer in this Report but, it was
a little too late. So, I figured I'd add to the comments about Creative Computer
and let you all out there know what I just went through.

               I just a couple weeks ago ordered a DKB High Density Floppy Drive
for my Amy and received it next day delivery. I then installed it and had some
problems with it recognizing HD floppies. No problem with 880k or 720k IBM how-
ever, I called Creatives technical support and they said it was a defective
drive that I would have to send it back. So, I was questionable about his reply
and ask if, he had DKB's phone number. He said yes and gave it to me. I gave DKB
a call and explained everything and I was told the same thing, Send it back.
O.K. I replied. I called up customer assistance at Creative and asked for a R/A
(return authorization) and they gave it to me knowing that this item was being
sent back for a replacement due to defect. I sent it out Next Day UPS and at the
time I was doing this I had been talking to my friend Mark Davidson whom is an
authorized distributor of this report and magazine and he made a comment to me
about sending it along with an A.O.D. form. This way they, Creative Computer
that is has to sign for it when received. He had told me this based on the fact
of reading the last article that was based on Creatives service and reputation.
I took this very seriously and thank him alot for filling me in on this. That's
I decided to read the report myself. Well, since I had sent it out next day UPS,
I figure that after a week I should be able to call them and ask them if, they
had received it and about when will I receive the new one. So, I called and I
was told that he had to call me back in a half hour. ???????? was going through
my mind saying, here we go just like the last article says about their reputa-
tion. I waited a little over an hour and got no call. I called back! I talked to
a different person this time and they told me it hadn't been received yet???????
Now, how or what would you be thinking after hearing about their reputation? I
told this person that they were full of shit and that I had sent it out next day
air and they gave me a crock of shit about Well, sir it is in UPSes hands and
are the ones that determine when we get it. I said at this time, that i wasn't
about to listen to anymore excuses and that I will be calling UPS myself and
will soon return a third call. I called UPS at this time and they told me why,
certainly Mr. Rizzo, your package was delivered ontime next day at 9:00 a.m. and
signed by a person by the name of Hernandez! Bamm! now, all I had to do is call
Creative back for a third time and let them know what I know. I called and now,
I got another person whom I told everything that was going on and she said, that
she would be happy to resolve this matter but, it would take her about an hour
and a half! I said, Why the wait? She told me because she had to check the ware-
house for the package. I again said o.k. and waited for 2 hours! You know what?
I had to call a fourth time because I didn't hear from her. I called again, and
asked for this person since I asked for her name prior to calling her back. She
was now nowhere to be found but, the person who answered asked if, I would leave
a message and she would be sure that the other woman would call me back. She
said at this time could she help and I said listen.... I just spoke with 3 diff-
erent people there at your office and have been doing nothing but, wasting my
time and will not take anymore of this run around. I explained to her everything
from the very first call to technical support up to right now. She said for me to
hold on she will try and locate the other woman personnally for me. I waited
probably 10 mins and finally got through to the other one who was going to check
the warehouse for me. She now tells me that the package has arrived and that,
they didn't have another one in stock!!!!! Of course you don't I said! Could
you imagine that. She said she would put me on priority backorder so that, as
soon as they got another one in I will receive it. Well, who knows when this
will be but, I'll leave a comment in this report as to how long it takes to
receive it for further reference. Maybe this will help all you out there who
might have any questions about Creative Computers reputation and service. I hope
this has been an interesting article and hope noone has to go through with what
I just did. Please, whoever has any questions or comments themselves about
Creative or any other computer mail order store, leave your gripes or questions
on the T.B.P. Video Slate BBS (201) 586-3623. Comments will be listed on the
next issue of Amiga Report and questions could be answered by myself by leaving
me E-Mail. I am a member of this BBS and a friend of the Sysops. My name is
Russell Rizzo and am listed as that on this BBS. If, I couldn't answer your
questions I'm sure someone else could.:-)

A quick set of reactions to the SX-1...

To: rniles@hebron.connected.com
X-Vmsmail-To: SMTP%"rniles@hebron.connected.com"
Status: R

Here is a mini-review or a letter-to-the-editor depending on how
you want to use it.


SX-1

Here are several other points about the SX-1 that I haven't seen in
other reviews along with a few reiterations.

The SX-1 case design should violate the warranty ;-)
It appears to be designed without knowing what it is was going to be
connected to. Paravision should add supports to relieve strain on the
edge connector immediately. I see two ways to do this. One is to simply
add a long thin strip of metal to the bottom of the SX1 case that extends
under the CD32 case. This fix could be done at home, but really should
be done at the factory. It is not a perfect fix either, since it doesn't
activate until there is already some stress on the connector. There is a
notch on the Cd32 case that appears to serve a similar purpose, but the gap
is so big between the cases it doesn't help much, and it is only on one side.

The second way would have to be done at the factory. The card that joins the
SX-1 to the CD32 and FMV should have a molded bracket that bolts to the
provided hole on the back of the CD32. This bracket could have a latch that
would integrate with the SX-1 lid so that a quarter turn would quickly
disconnect the SX-1 for removal. Although more expensive then the first
solution, it would would provide more positive strain relief.

The SX-1 does work with the FMV, and allows you to play movies on your rgb
monitor. Since my monitors are in one room and the entertainment system is
in another, a quick disconnect feature would be nice. I plan on placing
the SX-1 mouse and keyboard in the computer room so I can parnet to my 4000,
but I need to easily move the Cd32 to the home entertainment center for watching
movies with friends.

I've added a 4Meg simm module, and a floppy drive, and so far the power supply
has held up. I haven't hooked up a hard drive yet for two reasons. One, I don't
have a bigger power supply, and two, There is no scsi connector yet.
I have a dataflyer scsi 270 meg drive, but according to Expansion Systems
the IDE to SCSI cable they have has to be redesigned to fit the SX-1. They said
they were working on it, but had no release date. Paravision did provide a hole
in the case for the SCSI connector.


Richard Norman
REd kNight
norman@eisner.decus.org

Response:

  Expansion Systems SCSI+ works with the SX-1.  There are currently two problems:
  cable length sometimes becomes inconvenient (too long for the SX-1), and the
  board does not function without an IDE drive attached.  ES is working on the
  second (may have it fixed by the time I write this).  The cable length may
  or may not be solved by pack-ins from the company.

Hi Robert,

Ignore all that those guys said about getting updates.
I for one, appreciate getting word what's going on.
You're providing a great service for us here, and I'd hate to see that
jeopradized by a few people that can't control the the path from their brain
to their fingers.

  Response:

  Thanks for the support.  Since I can see the dispute from both angles, I
  think my compromise will be enough.  Of course, it would be ideal if I
  never have to give updates again...


And now, the sort of mail that makes AR really worth doing...

From: wingell@unx15.mro1.dec.com (Joshua Wingell)
To: jcompton@bbs.xnet.com
Subject: Amiga Report is great!

There has been a lot of talk on Usenet lately about the incredible shrinking
Amiga World and how Amazing Computing stays in business (How do they?).

While all this talk was going on, I realized that neither of these two
magazines is what I really look forward to.  The one I really enjoy reading and
anticipate each weekend is Amiga Report.

Amiga World is good for the advertisements and features, and Amazing Computing
gives good in depth tutorials.

But the one magazine that really gets on top of things is Amiga Report.  The
Emulation Rambler, the Amiga News, and the Editor's column all grab my
interest and keep me reading.  As well, the reviews of current hardware and
software are excellent!

Does anyone remember the monthly ".info is great!" letter that was always
publihed in the late great .info magazine?  Well, I would like to start a new
tradition...the weekly (soon to be bi-weekly) "Amiga Report is great!" letter.
These guys deserve the praise for providing such a wonderful service to the
Amiga community!

/********************************************************************
Amiga User Profile: Jim Carey
By Douglas J. Nakakihara

    Since meeting Jim Carey a few years ago, I've often been
puzzled by the range of work he does: a producer on this, an editor
on that, an animator on this, etc.  etc.  Jim is unique, a jack of
all trades and an amateur at none.  He has worked on everything
from low budget industrial videos to very high-end commercials.
One of his current projects is doing some of the graphics for the
Emmy-nominated FOX Saturday morning cartoon "Where in the World is
Carmen San Diego." "Carmen" is a slick blend of traditional
cartoon, 3-D, and short computer animations.  Carey, along with
David Kahn (producer), Kent Butterworth (storyboards and
characters), and Mike Kast (co-animator), handle the later.  He
refers to it as "animated image processing", a computerized
take-off from the cut-and-paste Monty Python style of animation.  I
had a chance to talk with Jim at his place in Westlake, California
and look at some of his current work.

How was this piece put together?

    The animation itself is in 256 colors.  But then this animation
is 256 and the next animation is 256, so I would use ADPro (ASDG)
to bridge them together.  Of course when you're using ADPro you're
in 24-bits, so there's like three different elements that are
coming together here.  Because I had the luxury of going a frame at
a time and compositing at the last minute to an Exabyte drive, I
could do my transitions in 24-bit in ADPro.

You actually would go directly to it?

    Yeah, directly to it.  For instance I would have a 24-bit
background and I would have two or three animations each with their
own 256-color palette and the ARexx script would throw it together.


How do you know it came out OK?

    I do check-animations back off the drive.  In the beginning I
would do a lot more testing because I was unsure of the format.
Out of all that animation, we had maybe two or three bad frames.
That's just amazing.

So basically you did a lot of stuff in 256-color independently and
just composited it in ADPro.

    Right.  Especially if I have a real nice background which I
would want to keep the color fidelity as high as possible.  This
background is 24-bit because it had such a nice gradient, this
Wolfgang Mozart piece.  Little Mozart, the second character, and
the piano were a single 256-color DeluxePaint (Electronic Arts)
animation.  So with ADPro I would just take the background and
composite the animation frames over it.

    I had to get this one (another animation) done fairly quickly
so I just maximized one 256-color palette.  I would take a look at
all of the characters necessary and I'd assign a certain range in
the palette for characters' costumes, and a certain other range for
the background, and another range for the cutout of the heads.  But
you can see--even though it's just 8-bit--you still have a wide
enough range of colors.

I would have guessed that the head was 24-bit.

    Yeah.  It's not, on this one I probably assigned just 32
colors, dithered the head in ADPro and it worked fine.  So,
especially with dithering--random dithering--you see all of the
rest of the characters come in using just 256 colors.

You really don't have that much disk capacity.  How do you store
all of this stuff?

    The backgrounds are just static and this is what we provide the
client, 8mm tape.  A 120 minute (tape) will hold about 10 GB.  A 60
minute will hold a little over 3,000 frames.

You use ARexx to control ADPro quite extensively.  Aren't there
programs that do this for you?

    I don't mind writing ARexx scripts because a lot of times you
have to do very specific things.  Now ProControl (ASDG) does quite
a bit and so does Multiframe (MacroSystemUS).  They both have
things that are really handy.  But there are some times you need to
get so specific you gotta write it.  Thank God for ARexx.  I would
say 70 percent of the animations that I did on Carmen San Diego had
an ARexx script to do the final compositing.  No way I could have
turned out 30 minutes of animation in that period of time, of that
type of single frame animation, without ARexx.  And I am excited
that DeluxePaint 5 (a forthcoming upgrade) will support ARexx.

It's amazing how powerful DeluxePaint is.

    It's much more powerful than I think people realize.  The
surprising thing, at Electronic Arts, they never think of
DeluxePaint, even DeluxePaint 5, as a professional program--this is
a program for amateurs.  That's the way they look at it.  Of
course, I'm always urging them to do a little bit more.  There are
a few more things I would like in there, which they probably won't
be able to put in because they don't think many people would take
advantage of it, because they don't view it as a professional
program.

What's the definition of "professional."

    Exactly.

Some of your techniques seem to break tradition.

    That's true.  In fact, you want to stay away from tradition.
The thing about it is, you usually have to learn the tradition
before you can learn how to stay out of it.  Rules are usually
written after somebody's done something enough times.  By the time
they are codified, it's time to break them.  (But it's a necessary
evolution.) You get used to things and you have to take it a step
at a time.  I think that's true for the artists and animators, as
well as the audience--you kind of have to grow up into it.  I don't
think you can just sit down and listen to a symphony by Beethoven
and immediately grasp what you're suppose to grasp.  You have to
bring some information along with you.

Do people care that you do things on an Amiga?

    I've gone to see a few companies and there is a prejudice when
they find out I'm using an Amiga.  I think I've lost some jobs
because they know I'm using an Amiga--even though I know the stuff
they're working with--but yes I have run into that preference.  I
would say well over half of the clients out there don't care.  Part
of that is because they don't know what the platform is doing
anyway and the people that do know about the Amiga, appreciate it.

I guess the director you were telling me about early was at the
opposite end of the spectrum.

    Yeah, because he hadn't seen this on any platform.  A platform
where he came to my office, sat down, and saw all of the equipment
right there in front of him that it was being done on.  I showed
him a few clips from the Carmen San Diego show and he was just
amazed.  "You did that on this computer?" He couldn't believe some
of the things I was doing, especially the pans and scans on
animated pieces, and some of the image processing.

You have to be a little worried now about the Amiga.  Have you
investigated Mac and PCs?

    I was worried when I first learned about what was happening
with Commodore--I've since regained a little optimism.  So I
started looking at what is available for what I do on the Mac and
the IBM.  I can put together a number of programs together on the
Mac and IBM that would be far more expensive than I am used to
paying for on the Amiga.

    The biggest limitation is I have yet to find a comparable
program to DeluxePaint.  I wish someone would tell me about a
program that animates as easy while still allowing me to work in
8-bit and in video resolution, 724 x 482--I haven't found it yet.
Right now, I can do essentially everything I want to do 2D-wise
with ADPro and DeluxePaint.  What machine out there, what IBM or
Mac is going to have the Toaster, plus ADPro, plus DeluxePaint,
plus multitasking, plus...  I can't imagine another machine giving
me the productivity that this machine has given me, without
multitasking.  I'm always running two programs, sometimes three.

    The other big advantage I've found is the Amiga community
itself.  The programs that I use have great tech support.  I find I
can get a hold of somebody on the phone and they listen to my
problem.  It's obvious they listen to users because the programs
that I use are upgraded constantly and have just gotten better.  I
mean, look at ADPro, DeluxePaint--it's just a constant improvement.

And often you get to talk to the actual programmer.

    Right!  More times than not, I do talk to the programmer.  And
I have been in a situation more than once, where I've talked to the
programmer and gotten an upgrade to solve a particular problem.
With ASDG on Carmen San Diego, we got the new 8505 Exabyte and they
upgraded their software for us--I understood or moved up the
upgrade date--and we got it.  They downloaded it to me directly and
I was using it an hour later.  I can't imagine that in the IBM
world.

Can you summarize your feelings on the Amiga?

    The thing about the Amiga which is most important to me are the
programs I've chosen to use, which have become so easy for me to
express my creativity.  Because of the way the programs are
written, because of the user-friendliness of the Amiga, because the
Amiga multitasks, I can eliminate the technique and work right on
the creative process, putting it together.  If I have an idea, I
can get right to it, and I won't lose that idea.  Because of the
depth of the programs, like ADPro and DeluxePaint, I can solve
problems.  If I want to do something, I can figure out how to do it
with these programs.  I probably could do it with other programs,
but I grew up with ADPro and DeluxePaint, and now the VideoToaster.
Because it's not that easy for me to learn a program, I struggle...
But once I learn one, I stick with it.

NewTek and Commodore Update

    Just by chance, NewTek was working on their next promo tape
close to where I work and I received a surprise invite from NewTek
Marketing head Donetta Colboch and Toaster trainer extrodinaire Lee
Stranahan.  I also finally met NewTek president Tim Jenison and his
wife Leslie.  Everyone was extremely nice and I hope I don't end up
on the proverbial cutting room floor.

    With some help from Brad Peebler, while at the studio I had a
chance to really play around with the Flyer.  Now I know where the
name came from.  The hand-made prototype board I saw had three PC
board fans mounted on it and two PC box fans balanced on the edges
of the opened A4000's case--any minute it was about to take off!  I
don't want to say too much about it now, other than it is an
awesome product.

    Lightwave 1.5 should be shipping by the time you read this,
both in standalone and VideoToaster upgrade versions.  There are
several improvements, most notably the new Metaform feature that
can help you literally turn a 2-D rectangle into a beautiful 3-D
sports car in minutes.

    At the L.A.  Video Toaster Group meeting, Jenison spoke and
provided some frank information on the future of the Amiga.
According to Tim, two of the bidders are Samsung and a group headed
by Jim Dionne, the former president of Commodore US.  Dionne knows
the Amiga and it would be wonderful to have him at the helm.  Tim
also indicated that the bankruptcy trustees have made it clear that
buyers must promise to get Amigas in production as soon as
possible.  NewTek seems to be totally confident that the Amiga will
survive and that ample supplies of machines exist until production
can resume.

Just a few notes from the past couple of weeks...

Emplant 4.7 is out.  Jim Drew told me he's made major changes and
improvements to the sound-handling code.  I haven't had a chance to get a
hold of it yet, however.

Apple_2000 1.2's release is imminent, and will pretty decidedly be the
last release of the emulator.  Kevin Kralian (interviewed in the last
AR) called me up to let me know how things were going.  He's landed a job
with a software development company and is currently working on the Sega
Saturn.  His message, other than to tell me that 1.2 is coming out in a
week or so?  He has "no regrets" for moving off the Amiga.

Maxwell Daymon has taken over the review of the GG2 Bus+ (once known
as the GoldenGate II) card...it seemed like a good idea, since I've got
plenty to do these days being Editor and all.

I'm still looking for fresh emulators...although it is worth mentioning
that I've received a copy of the new AGA-only Spectrum emulator, but
have yet to give it a go on my CD32.  (why it's AGA-only, nobody is
quite sure).  I'll keep you posted.

It IS worth mentioning that I received the same postcard that Emplant
owners got, inviting me to pre-order my copy of the Emplant PC
emulation module.  It's ALSO worth mentioning that, despite the fact
that someone requested that I be allowed to see the emulation to
reassure users that it exists, Drew has told me I have to wait until
the module is released.

The wording on the postcard is clever...my favorite part is "How soon?
SOON!", the only date on the card aside from the postmark.

More news to follow in a couple of weeks.  Keep the emulators warm.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

One thing they didn't spend a lot of time on at Micro R+D was the title
of their CD-ROM line.  That's just fine.

Based largely around 3-d objects and fonts, with a healthy (actually,
rather huge) collection of pictures, some utilities, and even books
and literary works from over 20 authors (Ever want to read The Scarlet
Letter again in its entirety?).  Thrown in as an afterthrought are
some games and sounds and a dozen or so MODs...in all, the disc is
over 500 megs of material, capped off by Transition, the picture
format processing program from DarkSoftWare.

So, what's good and bad about this CD?  The manual to Transition has
been recreated in the CD jacket, but unfortunately hasn't been edited
to take out things like hard drive installation (it can be run directly
from CD).  The CD is non-bootable, which isn't tragic to many people,
but for CD32 users it can be annoying to be denied access so summarily.
(SX-1s help alleviate the problem, but you STILL need 3.0 from somewhere.)
Since Transition requires 4 megs to run, though, the question is academic
to stock CD32 users.

I like it.  At times, it seems a bit too cluttered with too many directories,
but there ARE some rather conveniently placed indexes along the way.  The
assortment of Lightwave and Imagine is formidable, and many of the goodies
on the disc are LHA compressed...irritating again for CD32 users, but it
means you're at least getting your money's worth in filled space.
Besides, you can't beat free books.

There are all sorts of interesting goodies...many look like they've been
taken from Aminet, like the directory of IRC pictures.  Some early
Eric Schwartz animations are here.  There's even two copies of
GuitarSlinger if you REALLY love that mod.

It's always tough to review a CD-ROM like this...the best advice I can
give is this: if you want some 3d objects and a load of pictures heaped
with a helping of utilities, a few games, and an image conversion
program (a rather flexible one at that), then by all means, pick up
this CD...after all, Transition alone retails for US$40.

PRODUCT NAME

 D.A.S.ModulePlayer V3.2a


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

 DASMP (short for D.A.S.ModulePlayer) does what the title claims;
i.e., play music modules.  It is capable of playing modules of various
formats such as ProTracker, S3M, MTM, MED/OctaMED, QuadraComposer and
FutureComposer.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

 Name:  Pauli Porkka
 Address: Innanlantie 5 D 29
   FIN-37600 VALKEAKOSKI
   FINLAND

 E-mail:  paporkka@freenet.hut.fi
 FidoNet: 2:221/112.4


LIST PRICE

 DASMP is shareware, and the current price is $20 (US) or an
equivalent amount in any other currency.

 There are two registration sites mentioned in the manual, situated in
North America and Australia, which simplifies registration for the users
located in those countries.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

 HARDWARE

  None.

  At least 1 MB of memory is recommended due to the size of
  some modules.  More is recommended if you want to use
  the program to its full potential.

  Works on all processors (68000-68040).  A faster processor
  is recommended if you want to play any of the multichannel
  modules with a high mixing rate.

 SOFTWARE

  MUI (Magic User Interface) is required.

  AmigaDOS 2.04 or higher is required.
  Having AmigaDOS 3.x enables some extra features in DASMP.


COPY PROTECTION

 None.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

 Amiga 1200, 2 MB Chip RAM, 8 MB Fast RAM.
 120 MB Conner HD.
 Kickstart version 39.106, Workbench version 39.29 (AmigaDOS 3.0).
 C= 1940 multisync monitor.


INSTALLATION

 DASMP features an Installer script to simplify the process of
installing.  It works like a charm. :-)


BACKGROUND

 Playing modules has been an essential need of any Amiga user since
the first NoiseTracker program was released.  Various module players have
been released over the years, some of them better than others, and some even
worse.  Today, there are a number of different module file formats to look
out for, and compatibility with the various formats is a necessity.  Another
option that is strongly needed is the possibility to crunch/archive modules
in order to save hard disk space, since modules are getting bigger.  A nice
interface is of course a feature that should not be neglected.

 DASMP features all this and much more.


EXTERNAL PLAYER LIBRARIES

 DASMP supports S3M, MTM, MED(OctaMed), QuadraComposer and
FutureComposer modules through External Player Libraries ("EPLs").  This
modular approach allows the user to choose what libraries to install and
what
libraries to use with the player, giving the user greater control of how
much resources the program should be allowed to use.

 S3M and MTM are multichannel PC formats which are getting more and
more followers. I've tested only S3M modules because I haven't been able to
find any MTM modules on my local BBSs.

 The S3M format supports the use of 4-32 channels, and DASMP allows
you to configure what mixing rate to use for each type. (Higher mixing rate
values make the module sound better but it also intensifies the workload of
the processor.  It is recommended that you adjust the settings to suit the
power of your system.) You can also choose play modes that consist of the
following features: Mono, Stereo, Surround, Real Surround, and Stereo
14-bit.
The playing of these modules works perfectly, and the user will not notice
that you are playing them after you have enabled and configured the EPL.

 Another commonly used EPL is the MED(OctaMED) library. It requires
the medplayer.library and octaplayer.library to be present in your system,
and when they are present, MED/OctaMED modules are played like any other
module.

 For those who haven't got access to huge amount of Chip RAM which is
often required to play big modules there is a solution trough the use of
dasFAST.library. It plays ProTracker-compatible modules from Fast RAM using
a
technique that is everything but perfect, according to the author. It seems
to work well for me, however, and I hardly noticed any loss in quality when
playing some of my modules from Fast RAM. You may choose the size of the
modules to use this player, the priority of the player, the mixing rate, and
some different playing modes.


PACKED MODULES

 DASMP supports mainly XPK-packed modules.  Through the use of the
XPK package, you can get it to play PowerPacked modules too. Another great
feature is the ability to play modules that are archived in almost any
format; e.g. LHA, ZIP, ZOO, etc. It even allows the handling of multiple
files within the same archive, and it can also play XPK-packed modules from
within an archive.

 I recommend the use of the SQSH-library which is especially well
suited for packing 8-bit sound data.  It gives you an excellent result.
Decrunching speed is quite fast, but if speed is your main priority, use the
xpkFAST.library or xpkNUKE.library instead.


THE INTERFACE

 The interface to the user is perhaps the most vital part of any
program. Due to the use of MUI, DASMP features all advantages of that
package; i.e., tremendous configurability. You can rearrange almost the
whole
GUI to your liking. DASMP features a "special" menu which allows you to
enable and disable certain groups of gadgets to give you some quick
possibilities to change the interface.

 DASMP's strongest point is without question the module list
handling. To be able to play modules, you add them to the listview using the
appropriate function. When the list is created, you are able to configure
each entry separately.  Fade speed, preload, volume and FAST relocation are
selectable for every module. (FAST relocation means that DASMP will put the
song data in Fast RAM in order to save as much Chip RAM as possible.) The
name of the module in the listview doesn't need to be the same as the name
of the "real" module, and there is a "Get" function which is able to fetch
the real name of the module from within the module.

 DASMP also features a unique author system that allows you to enter
an author and a style for each module. To play just the modules in a
particular style, click the "Au" button of the main window and select your
desired style from the listview that pops up. The module list will then
change to contain only the modules in your selected style. It is as simple
as that!  There is one disappointment with this feature, however:  it is
impossible to select an author and a style at the same time. Even if most
composers produce work in only one style, this is indeed a limitation even
if it is a small one.

 DASMP supports the use of two groups called group A and group B.
For example, group A could contain the modules that you have easily
accessible (on your hard drive), and group B could contain the modules that
aren't easily accessible (e.g., on your floppy disks.)  When you want to
play a group B module, you just double-click it and DASMP will ask you for
the required disk. Since you are able to choose which groups to show in the
listview, this is a great option, and you don't have to scan all your disks
in order to find a particular module once you've added the modules to the
group.  To add a module, you select the "Add" button and a requestor (ASL or
ReqTools, depending on your configuration) allows you to select modules to
be added to the list.  There are three options which should be mentioned:
Normal, Date updating and Check. Date updating adds only modules newer than
your current module list date, suitable for the inclusion of newer modules
that you've copied into your module directory. The Check option checks if
there is a real module that corresponds to the listview entry, suitable for
updating the listview when you've erased modules from disk without notifying
DASMP.

 Of course, no player program would be complete without programming
and randomizing functions. Programming is dead easy when using DASMP's
listview capabilities.  Just delete from the listview the modules that you
don't wish to play, and play the remaining ones. The new module list can be
saved as any other module list, and you can have as many "programs" as your
hard disk allows.

 Another nice feature of DASMP is that it shows and remembers the
playing time of the modules. There are four different clocks.  One shows the
the total time of the currently playing module and how long it has been
playing. The second shows the total playing time of all modules which
currently are in the module list. It is (IMHO) actually quite amazing to
know that all my modules have a total playing time of 5 hours and 32
minutes.  The third shows the total playing time for today, and the fourth
shows the played time of a module and the remaining time to be played.

 DASMP also supports the use of some effects: QuadraScope,
DoubleScope and a big QuadraScope that is scaled using some new functions in
AmigaDOS 3.0. The effects contain a bug that sometimes messes up your
display, and the author has no clue what is causing the problem. I've
encountered the same problem while using another module player's effects so
it isn't a problem that is all that special for DASMP. It is advised,
however, that you use the lowest priority available for the effects to
reduce the problem.

 DASMP has a full-blown ARexx port which is very valuable to simplify
the process of playing modules; e.g., from within a directory utility. It
also supports a few very useful tooltypes that allow you to load a module
list automatically during startup and define an AppIcon for DASMP.


DOCUMENTATION

 The documentation is in standard AmigaGuide format and explains
everything that you need to know about using the program. Like any good
program, DASMP has on-line help available by just pressing the HELP key.
The
program recognizes in which state it is currently in and shows the
appropriate section of the documentation.

 The documentation is quite easy to understand, but unfortunately
there is no section for the novice. But if you have a bit of patience, you
will most certainly be able to have it configured shortly.

 Some features are omitted from the manual of version 3.2a. It seems
like the manual hasn't been updated to fit the current version, and there
isn't any on-line help when you are configuring the EPLs either.  I would
like an explanation of what the different playing modes do.  (By the time
you read this, I will have notified the author.)


LIKES

 I like everything about the product! It gives you everything that
you could ask from a module player and more. The most useful feature is
indeed the unique handling of modules in the listview which makes your setup
so much more professional.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

 I have only one small dislike about the product. It isn't possible
to save the bpm (beats per minute) setting separately for each module. I
have some modules that should be played at a different speed and it is
annoying that you have to change the tempo slider each time you want it to
be
played at correct speed.

 It would be nice if you were able to multiselect both an author and
a style at the same time, but this isn't as important as most composer stick
to one style in their work. But it would be a nice feature.

 The documentation in version 3.2a isn't entirely up to date.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

 I've used quite a lot of different module players -- more that I can
remember really -- but my needs haven't been fulfilled until I got hold of
DASMP.  The other players either had too few features or an awful GUI.


BUGS

 There is a problem with the effects messing up the display.  The
author is aware of the problem.


VENDOR SUPPORT

 The support of Pauli Porkka is one of the strongest points of DASMP.
Pauli claims that he will answer *all* e-mail that has to do with DASMP, and
he has always done his best to answer my sometimes silly questions.  DASMP
has been developed with a lot of user interaction, and it shows on the
result.


WARRANTY

 None.  It's shareware, for God's sake!


CONCLUSIONS

 DASMP is the best module player for the Amiga platform today (IMHO).
I rate it 5 stars out of 5 with a slight minus due to the lack of handling
the bpm of modules separately.

 Finally, I would like to say that it is really a great program and
you should try it out immediately if you haven't done so.

%%  Important notes for 2.x -> 3.1 upgraders     By: Dan Barrett       %%
%%  (No, it's not a BLAZEMONGER message)         barrett@cs.umass.edu  %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

        Here is some advice for everyone upgrading from AmigaDOS 2.x to 3.1.
I discovered these things the hard way -- through trial and error (and help
from Net friends).  If you are having weird problems after the upgrade,
maybe you will find a solution below.

PREFERENCES FILE PROBLEMS (especially mouse pointer problems)

        Are you experiencing any weird preference behavior like the
following?

        o       The busy pointer does not appear.
        o       The mouse pointer is the wrong color.
        o       Pointer preferences (and others) don't get saved between
                reboots.
        o       The Workbench screen turns strange colors.
        o       WBPattern backdrops don't work correctly.

          The prefs file format apparently changed from AmigaDOS 2.x to
3.x.  To solve such problems,

        (1)     Run all of your preferences programs and write down (on
                a piece of paper) all your settings.

        (2)     Go to the directory ENV:sys and delete all the files with
                names ending in ".prefs".  (You can copy them to another
                directory first, if you want to be safe.)  These are your
                preferences settings that are created when you click "Save"
                in a preferences program.

        (3)     Go to the directory ENVARC:sys and, as above, delete all
                files with names ending in ".prefs".

        (4)     Run all of your preferences programs and re-create all your
                desired preferences settings (that you wrote down on paper
                in step (1).)  Click "Save" after running each program.

        (5)     Reboot.  All should be OK now.

        DO NOT simply run the 3.1 preferences programs, change the settings
and click "Save."  YOU MUST DELETE YOUR PREFS SETTINGS FILES FIRST.


COMMODITIES

        If you are using the SwitchNTSC commodity, get rid of it.  It will
crash your system under 3.1 due to (I believe) changes in the Screen
structure.


CPUBLIT

        If you are using CPUBlit, start using the "-b" option, or else
it may not work.  See the CPUBlit documentation for more details.


DATATYPES NOT WORKING?

        If you assign LIBS: somewhere in your user-startup file, beware!!
The AmigaDOS 3.1 startup-sequence has a new "Assign add" line:

                Assign >NIL: LIBS: SYS:Classes ADD

If you reassign LIBS: and forget to include SYS:Classes, your datatypes will
not work.  For example, MultiView and WBPattern will work incorrectly or
refuse to run.


WSHELL 2.0

        If you are using the PATH: handler from WShell 2.0, and reassign
LIBS:, beware of the problem mentioned above.  For example, I had in my
user-startup:

                assign LIBS: PATH:sys:libs,another:libs

and forgot about sys:classes.  I changed it to

                assign LIBS: PATH:sys:libs,sys:classes,another:libs


MUI (Magic User Interface)

        If you use MUI, watch out for a conflict between sys:classes and the
MUI "classes" directory.  If your datatypes are not working or MUI
does not work, this may be the problem.  For me, with WShell 2.0's PATH
handler, I had to do:

                Assign Libs:    PATH:sys:Libs,sys:Classes
                Assign Libs:    usr:Lib/Classes ADD

If you don't use WShell, you might not have a conflict.


THAT'S ALL - GOT ANY MORE TIPS?

        If anybody has more AmigaDOS 2-to-3 tips, please mail them to me,
and I'll keep this list up-to-date.

DESCRIPTION

    Physics Laboratory in Mechanics is a multimedia program which
    uses an experimental approach to teach high school level
    mechanics. Seven topic areas cover the concepts of Kinematics,
    Newtonian Dynamics, Statics, Universal Gravitation, Work & Energy,
    Impulse & Momentum, and Rotational Motion.  Each topic area has
    beginner, intermediate, and advanced level experiments for a total
    of 21 different experiments.  A laboratory notebook describes each
    experiment and allows the user to simulate the experiment with
    the computer.  The experiment can also be performed by using
    everyday objects found around the home.

    Physics Laboratory in Mechanics allows multiple users to retain
    data in computerized notebooks.  It also includes history segments
    explaining how the physical concepts were discovered, a math
    reference section, a units reference section, and a program to allow
    you to convert units to the MKS system of measurement.  A hall of
    fame with pictures of notable scientists will include an entry for
    the user upon completion of the entire set of experiments.

NEW FEATURES

    This program is a free demo version of Physics Laboratory in
    Mechanics.  It has a slide show of some of the programs features,
    a list of the 21 experiments and one experiment which can actually
    be run.

        email: walrus@wam.umd.edu

DESCRIPTION
        KingFisher 2.1, the successor to the popular KingFisher 1.40,
        a disk catalog tool originally aimed at Fred Fish's Amiga
        Library collection, but now capable of a more general purpose
        format, real multi-user capabilities, and a lot more.

        KingFisher began as a tool to catalog, maintain, and search
        Fred Fish's AmigaLibrary disks ("Fish Disks.")  It has been
        redesigned into a multi-purpose, multi-user, multi-database
        cataloging tool capable of delivering detailed information on
        software using Fred Fish's new Product-Info Specification.  As
        such, it can be used to catalog not only the Fish Disks, but
        your club's selection of software, as well, even the contents
        of Aminet itself.

PRE-RELEASES (KingFisher 2.0)
        Pre-release versions of KingFisher 2.0 have been available
        since March on Fred's FreshFish, FrozenFish, and GoldFish
        CD-ROMs, but only now has the program achieved the envisioned
        set of features that make a first public release feasible.

FEATURE OVERVIEW
        KingFisher 2.1, the product of nearly 20 test releases over a
        beta test period of three months, offers some of the following
        capabilities (features marked with {*} are new or
        significantly improved over the older KingFisher 1.40):

        {*} -   Fully resizable GadTools interface operating on the
                default public screen; uses the default screen font
                (even if proportional) for all menus, gadgets, and
                displayed text.

        {*} -   Multiple copies of KingFisher 2 can operate
                simultaneously, using a minimum of additional RAM
                overhead through the use of Client-Server technology.

        {*} -   Multiple copies of a supplied program, RexxFisher,
                provide ARexx ports at the cost of approximately 25K
                per client.  This contrasts sharply with achieving the
                same goal with KingFisher 1.40 where the cost was 350K
                for a complete, secondary copy of KingFisher.

        {*} -   Supplies any number of independently accessible
                databases to multiple clients (such as KingFisher,
                RexxFisher, etc.)

        {*} -   Search Sets can be built (as well as saved and
                restored) to select from a list of matching software
                that a previous search produced.  Matching records are
                listed and can be selected for instant viewing through
                a standard listview.

        {*} -   Any number of search expressions are memorized by
                KingFisher 2 and can be recalled at the press of a
                button to save typing.

        {*} -   The layout of information used for the display,
                printing, and exporting can be re-defined to suit
                individual taste or need.

        {*} -   Uses locale.library and comes supplied with Dansk,
                Deutsch, Nederlands, and Suomi language catalogs.
                More are expected.

            -   Context sensitive and fully integrated AmigaGuide(R)
                documentation.

            -   Includes a complete, ready-to-use database of
                descriptions for Fish Disks 1-1000!

REQUIREMENTS
        RAM requirements are less than for KingFisher 1.40 and merely
        a fraction thereof when multiple copies are run: approximately
        200K.  Also required is Kickstart V37 (2.04) but V38 (2.1) is
        required for localization.

COMPATIBILITY
        Tested with 68000 through 68040 CPUs, V37, V38, V39, and V40
        system software, Picasso II graphics board.  Enforcer and
        Mungwall used during testing.

DESCRIPTION

        SSAPatch allows ClariSSA v1.1, given on the July 94
     coverdisk of Amiga Format, to run under Kickstart 1.2.

        Note that you'll get a lot of messages about not having
     ARexx, and won't be able to use a lot of the features the program
     offers.  I don't know if it's like this on all Worbench 1.3
     machines, or perhaps the program is saying to itself "I'm not
     running on Kickstart 1.3, so this must be 2.0 or higher".  You'll
     still be able to convert animations to SSA format.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        ClariSSA v1.1 is needed (or course).
        Kickstart 1.2 is not required, but let's face it, you don't need
       this program if you don't have it (and frankly, you'd be better
       off upgrading it anyway).

     free, but if you find it useful, and you're feeling generous, you
     should send the latest version of the BLAZEMONGER archive to my
     snail mail address (since I'll be off the net soon).

        Users of this program (and others) are also encouraged to
     play the Amber Diceless Role Playing game, and read the Hellrider

TITLE

     Universal Message System, Public Release

VERSION

     This is Release 10.9 of the UMS installation package.

AUTHOR

     This package contains software from many different authors.
     Take a look at the various documentation files for further
     information. The installation package was originally put
     together by Kai Bolay and has been updated for 10.9 by
     Oliver Knorr (E-Mail: olk@johann.nbg.sub.org).

DESCRIPTION

     The Universal Message System (short "UMS") is a system for
     managing all kinds of messages ('e-mail' and 'news') as
     universally and efficiently as possible.

     It uses its own, network-independent format, thus allowing the
     user, the 'newsreader' and tool-programs to read and treat
     messages from different networks in a unified way.

     Special programs called 'importers' and 'exporters' deal with
     the specific formats of all these networks. In this release
     importers/exporters are supplied for QWK, UUCP, FidoNet, Mausnet
     (German) and Z-Net (German) as well as for a proprietary format.

     UMS supports multiple users and manages individual access-rights
     for each user.

     UMS provides a common interface ("ums.library") for access to
     the message-base, which is used by all programs dealing with
     UMS.

     Developer-material for using UMS in Amiga-Oberon, ARexx, C and
     Modula-2 is included in this package.

     Also included:

      - all binaries and tools needed for the central data-base

      - two messagereaders for reading and writing news and mail.
        One very nice and intuitive one (needs MUI), and one "not-so-
        intuitive" one that works on every Amiga- or VT100-console.

      - many tools that are useful and/or intructive in how to use
        UMS and write other tools.

      - an  Installer ((c) Commodore-Amiga, Inc.) script to install
        UMS with any of the above networks in a simple setup (i.e.
        a "point" or "leaf-node").

NEW FEATURES

     About 20 of the included packages have been updated since 10.8
     and a couple of bugs in the installer script have been fixed.

     IMPORTANT: There are still a few updates and new packages that
     ========== did not make it into this release! Most important,
                the included Maus and Z-Netz drivers are *not* the
                current releases. You have to get and install these
                separately. Sorry for the inconvenience.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     AmigaOS >=V2.0, >=3 MB RAM, >=2 MB hd

     MUI (Magic User Interface, (c) by Stefan Stuntz) is needed
     if you want to use the IntuiNews messagereader.

HOST NAME

     Any AMINET mirror, for example ftp.uni-erlangen.de.
