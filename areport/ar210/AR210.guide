Hiya!!!

Another week, another fantastic issue of Amiga Report!!

This week we have had quite a few readers out there send in some very
interesting articles. These articles, the articles that have been written
for Amiga Report, and the articles that you send to AR in the future is 
what makes this magazine so great! 

We don't just talk about the Amiga, and the Amiga community. 
Amiga Report *IS* the Amiga ....and the Amiga community!

I've been honored to receive newsletters from The Minnesota Commodore 
User's Association, and from Amiga Arizona. These newsletters are quite
interesting to read. It's good to hear from those of you out there who
are actively supporting the Amiga, and educating the public.

If you are a member of an Amiga user's group, please send me a newsletter.
And no matter where you are ....support your local Amiga user's group!

OK ...enough! Let's get on with the show!

Automated Voice Responce Helpline in the UK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LONDON, ENGLAND, 1994 MAR 9 (NB) -- Commodore UK has revealed 
that its pilot project, of an automated voice response system for 
its helpline, has been a great success. The service, which has been
operational since December, will now go fully live to all callers,
Newsbytes has learned.

"In December, 1993, we introduced an interactive voice response
(IVR) helpline to help ease the pressure on human operators over the
Christmas period. Since then, it's been a great success. By the end
of January, it had handled 13,326 queries," explained Terry Maguire,
customer services manager with Commodore UK.

The IVR used was developed jointly by ICL and Legion Limited, the
software house. The company claims that it is the industry's first
fully automated diagnostics and advice line of its kind in the UK.

The service is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week and runs
in parallel at ICL's call reception center on Wakefield, Yorkshire.
To date, the automated service has handled around a third of all
Commodore Helpline calls.

"We receive a variety of calls to the Helpline," Maguire said, "from
dealers asking how to resolve a fault, to customers simply 
wanting to know how to operate a unit. Our aim in introducing this
automated diagnostics service was to allow customers to resolve 
problems themselves, wherever possible, by listening to recorded 
information. This allows call receptionists to concentrate on 
getting engineers out to customers more quickly." 

According to Peter Horridge, operations manager for ICL customer
service, which handles Commodore's support calls, the key to a
successful automated service is not only its ability to handle a
large step function increase in call volumes efficiently, but also
its ability to mid-call divert to a live operator when needed.

"The majority of users and problems exploit the facilities provided
by the automated service. We should not lose sight, however, that
the end user requires a balance between automated diagnosis and
direct contact with a live operator whenever appropriate. The call
rates to dare using both the diagnostic service and the mid-call
divert facility prove that the IVR is an acceptable solution," he
said.

The Commodore UK helpline is on 0345-626090, a local rate "linkline"
call that is charged at local rates wherever in the UK the caller is
located. When callers are connected to the Helpline, after an
introductory message, they are asked to dial "5," which ascertains
whether the call is touch tone or rotary dialed. Touch tone calls
are routed through the IVR system, while rotary dial calls are
routed to a live operator.

staff, be distributing collections of Amiga Report across the world.

Each collection will contain issues of AR from the past five to six weeks,
ensuring totally full disks, providing the very best in value for 
Amiga PD.

This move was made in order to make Amiga Report more accessible by those
poor unfortunates who do not have access to a modem. We don't want them to
miss out on one of the best Amiga magazines around!

CYNOSTIC: LOOKING FOR NEW AMIGA PROJECTS!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In our ongoing policy of enhancing the scope and public perception of the
Amiga, Cynostic is now looking for new Amiga CD projects.

We already distribute a whole range of audio compact discs and cassettes,
but we are now looking for further exciting projects to broaden our range.

The projects can be anything, such as:

 -  Music compact discs
 -  Music cassettes
 -  Amiga CD-ROMs
 -  Magazines
 -  Videos
 -  ANYTHING!

The only stipulation is that they must be either produced or in some other
way related to the Amiga home computer.

As an example of what we already stock:
"Montage" by Bjorn A Lynne (His latest music CD; the best yet!)
"Hobbits & Spaceships" by Bjorn A Lynne and Seppo Hurme
"Simplicity" by Minimal Arts, aka Volker Tripp (Jester/Sanity)

If you think you can match or beat the quality of these excellent 
productions then get in touch with us at:

other part of Cynostic's operations, do not hesitate to get in touch!

All the best to everyone in Amigaland,

Commodore's CD32 communicates!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Eureka delivers low-cost CD32 expansion interface.

The Communicator enables CD32 to communicate with other Amiga's.
With the Communicator, you can use CD32 as  intelligent CDrom drive.
Control your CD32 from  Scala and start Audio or  even Mpeg tracks.* Or
View iff aga/pcx/gif and other CD's even on non-aga machines.
* needs Mpeg cartridge.


Uploading and starting programs on the CD32 is possible making CD32 a
powerful stand alone Computer with communication and graphics capacities
far better than CD-I! The Communicator plugs in the keyboard plug and
doesn't occupy the expansion slot.


Intelligent CDrom drive

The CD32 is a state of the art dual speed, multi-session drive.
With the Communicator up- and download files from amiga to CD32 is
achieved with a speed of upto 115200 baud! Because of intelligent
multi-tasking, both the CD32 and amiga can perform other tasks while
exchanging data, the internal logic of the communicator takes care of
error correction and insures error free data transfer.

SCALA, CD32, the Communicator and how they work together.
Scala specially wrote a new EX module for Eureka's Communicator.
With this EX module and the communicator it is now possible to control
both  audio CD's and Full motion video CD's  (when an MPEG cartridge is
installed), starting audio and Mpeg tracks on CD32 from SCALA on the
remote machine. This makes CD32 a full blown Mpeg player station for
scala. At last full motion video can be played in SCALA by
using the Communicator, the CD32 and the Mpeg cartridge.


The MIDI interface

This popular music interface MIDI is supported.
The Communicator comes with high speed MIDI IN/OUT and TRU plug.
MIDI can be used  from the CD32- or  the amiga-side.
The Communicator can also be used as stand alone MIDI interface on the
amiga or CD32.  Popular programs such as Bars&Pipes, Helm, Scala and many
more can use Midi to control anything from  keyboards upto
drum-computers.


Connectivity and safety

The Communicator connects to the CD32 keyboard  plug, leaving the
expansion port free for Mpeg cartridges or memory expansion boards and
allowing still the keyboard plug being used (ported tru), all circuits are
protected against wrong connection and static electricity so you can
safely connect and disconnect two machines.


Viewing  CD disks

Now you can view IFF (including AGA), PCX, GIF and other
pictures on your CD32 by simply loading the picture CD in your CD32. You
can also copy pictures to your Amiga. Viewing aga pictures can be very
handy when the connected machine is non-aga such as the A500 and A2000.
The Communicator supports also a unique Photo-mode which enables it to
display PhotoCD disks.


Control

CD32's control pad emulates  the mouse. The workbench , a terminal program
and Scala backgrounds are available on the CD. Spare room of the CD is
filled with spectacular PD software.

The Communicator package contains:

-       Communicator hardware with MIDI/Serial/keyboard plug.
-       Communicator CD crowded with the Communicator program, utilities  
        and PD software.
-       Amiga disk for installing the amiga side and manual in
        English/German and Dutch.

Eureka's Communicator has 1 year warranty.
Retail  price  will be around 250 DM including taxes. Available by the end
of february 1994.

                AMIshare Shareware Distribution
         The NEWEST Amiga-Only Shareware Distributor!
               Appearing for the first time in
            Redlands Market Night, March 31 1994!!

------------========= A N N O U N C I N G =========------------

   We are a group of three Amiga enthusiasts who live here in the Inland
Empire (one in Highland, the other two in Redlands, to be precise) who
are steamed about the lack of available software applications for our
beloved computer.  Being entrepeneuring citizens, we decided to tackle
the problem head on: collecting and distributing Amiga Shareware...
However, unlike other Shareware collections, we have decided to implement
a few up-to-date features:

 1)  All shareware has been tested for Kickstart 2.0+ compatability!
     We want the Amiga community to catch up with the rest of the world,
     so we will also be offering

 2)  Kickstart Kickup! Upgrade your 500, 1000* or 2000 to 2.1!! Dont be
     stuck in a 1.3 world!  We also realize that the Amigas ARE NOT just
     game machines, so we also

 3)  GAURENTEE ONE DATA APPLICATION ON EVERY DISK!!! Unlike other
     collections which are mostly utilities or games, our disks contain
     4 programs (and one MOD), one of each of the following categories:

     Data Processing       <----- One on EVERY DISK!!
     Educational
     Video
     Programming Utils
     Communications
     Audio
     Utilities
     Games
     Music                 <----- One MOD on EVERY DISK!

So, if you want a little more variety in your software collection, come
on down and visit our booth on March 14th in the Redlands Market Night!

                Is AAA already obsolete?
                ------------------------

  Recent  rumors of AAA being "too little, too late" have been making the
rounds.   Some rumors say that Commodore has canceled AAA because they A)
can't afford to make it, and B) it's already obsolete.  Well, I don't buy
into that.

  According to Dave Haynie, one of the senior engineers at Commodore, and
who  is responsible for the system design of the next generation high end
Amiga,  and  who  seemed  enthusiastic  just  three months ago, said some
important  things  publicly.   And  I tend to believe him over other less
reliable  people.   Here's  some  quotes from Dave's conference on Portal
three months ago:

"Everyone's  heard  about AAA, of course, and I did build a AAA prototype
machine, which we have running in the labs of course."

So,  AAA  *IS*  real and *IS* up and RUNNING, even if only in a prototype
machine.  And that was three months ago.

"There  are things in AAA which will make a very impressive difference in
many of the things we're doing with computers these days."

"The  AAA  chip  set  is  a radical departure from anything you have seen
before.  Everything in it was designed new, from the ground up."

"I  don't think AAA is coming out too late, though it's later than I (and
all of you, of course) would have liked.  There's still not a big move to
4MB  floppies  yet,  everyone's  still  trying to work out just how to do
multimedia,  and I think AAA supports much of this in hardware, the right
way."

He seems confident that AAA isn't obsolete.

"AAA  will  cost  more  [than  AGA],  though much less than we originally
guessed,  thanks  to  the  downsizing of chips (AAA takes about a million
transistors)."

That's  good  news.   Things  are  turning out, at least in some aspects,
BETTER than they had planned.

"I  think  you'll find this new system isn't lacking as a '94 machine.  I
can't  get into too much detail, only to say that [a] I have been working
on  this  architecture for two years, something that never happened at C=
before  (two  weeks  was  more  like it in the...  old days), and [b] I'm
doing  things  with  system  throughput no one else is doing, or at least
talking  about,  now.   No  big surprise, really, though.  There's little
incentive  to  get  too  fancy in "standard" architecture.  Apple doesn't
build  clever  hardware,  and they seem to be wanting out of the hardware
business anyway."

Sounds like a nice *system*, no?

"C=  "high-end"  is $4k and below, generally.  I think it should start at
about $1.5K-$2K, less if possible."

With a great price...

"There's  perhaps  an  aggregate  bandwith of 400-600MB/s in a basic next
generation machine."

Yikes!   The  AGA chipset has a total bandwidth of just 14MB.  The 32 bit
ram in the A4000 has around 10MB bandwidth, as does the Zorro III and CPU
slots.  The "A5000" has 400-600MB total?  WHOA!

I  will  now detail why I think AAA and the next generation machine won't
be  obsolete, and in fact will be innovative, based on facts presented by
Dave.

                        . . .

  First  of  all,  lets  talk  about  the  features  of  AAA and the next
generation  machine  (hereafter  refered  to as the A5000, even though we
don't know if that is what it will be called).


AAA
---

  AAA  consists  of four custom CMOS chips, with a total of approximately
one  million  transistors.  It's a totaly new design, not an upgrade from
AGA,  thus  it  has  none  of the limitations of AGA.  The four chips are
called Andrea, Monica, Linda and Mary.

  They  are  all  full  32  bit  chips, with the "exception" of Linda and
Monica  which  also have 64 bit modes.  They are not limited by the 14Mhz
clock of AGA, or the hardware-fixed DMA slots (see the hardware reference
manual).


DMA: the soul of AAA
--------------------

  There  are 40 DMA channels, with dynamic allocation of bandwidth.  That
means that each channel can be as fast as it needs to be (up to the limit
of total bandwidth in the system).

  DMA  is  used  for everything, from the blitter and copper, to sprites,
the audio voices, video display, floppy disk I/O and serial ports.

  These DMA channels are the heart of AAA and part of what sets the Amiga
apart  from  other  computers.   It's  part  of  what gives the Amiga its
performance.   The  OS  is  fully  capable of taking advantage of DMA and
hardware coprocessing, due to it's multitasking nature.

  When  one  task is waiting for some DMA or other hardware processing to
finish,  another  task  can  switch  on  and  use the processor.  This is
something  that  other computers have a hard time with (for instance, the
Mac,  which  doesn't have the pre-emptive multitasking required for this.
The  Mac  IIfx  had  DMA  channels that couldn't be used by the Mac's OS!
Only UNIX on the Mac could use this hardware).


The blitter and the copper
--------------------------

  The  pride and joy of the Amiga.  In AGA, the blitter and copper became
very  outdated.   They  are slow by modern standards, very slow, although
there  is  still  nothing  that quite duplicates the functionality of the
copper.

  In AAA, these two important components become greatly enhanced.

  The blitter is basicly just some DMA channels that feed data (graphics)
into  a  processor  and  then  write it back out to RAM.  The blitter can
easily  do  all  the  necessary  bit  shifting,  modulo counting, and bit
masking required to move 2D images around in a raster/bitmap; in addition
to  doing  things  like  combining  more  than one image based on a logic
operation.   These  calculations are quite a bit more time consuming when
done by a general purpose CPU.

  The AAA blitter can blit 24 blit images "significantly faster" than AGA
can blit 8 bit images (according to Dave Haynie, who built a prototype!).
I've seen Mac's manipulating 24 bit graphics, and you can visualy see the
windows "slosh" ("shear", "squish", etc) when they are moved (you can see
the  graphics get redrawn slowly from top to bottom).  AAA will move such
windows  instantly (just like back in 1985, when comparing a colour Amiga
to a B/W Mac -- the Mac windows moved very slowly).

  The  Amiga's  "Copper"  is  also  a  DMA channel.  It feeds a stream of
instructions  into  a  very  simple processor (one could almost call it a
RISC CPU).  It's capable of doing almost anything the CPU can do; loading
chipset  registers,  jumping,  looping  and  waiting.   It can be used to
control *everything* in the chipset, independant of the CPU.  It lets the
Amiga  have  dragable  screens,  giant scrolling screen bitmaps, and many
other things characteristic and unique to the Amiga.

  With  the high bandwidth and flexibility of AAA's DMA channels, you can
see  that  the  new  blitter  and  copper are going to be quite powerfull
indeed.


Glorious sound
--------------

  Another  hallmark  trait  of  the  Amiga is its built in sound ability.
Most  computers do not have good built in sound (the exceptions being the
Apple  IIgs  and  the  Atari  Falcon,  both of which failed despite being
decent machines), most even have none standard.

  The  Amiga's  old  4 voice, 8 bit sound has been quite sufficient for a
number  of years and remains better than average for a PC.  But AAA takes
this  to  new  levels:  it now has 8 independant voices, each with 16 bit
accuracy,  and  64Khz  sampling  rates (compared to 30Khz for AGA).  That
puts  each channel well beyond a CD player in technical accuracy, and far
beyond  what  the human ear can hear.  It's also far beyond typical sound
boards on other computers.

  Amiga  sound  samples  are  fed by DMA channels, thus relieving the CPU
from 99% of the work normaly involved.


Video!
------

  Ah,  here  we  get  massive improvements over AGA!  Utilizing 32/64 bit
DRAM  and VRAM, and high speed burst access, AAA increases bandwidth over
AGA by 20 times!

  First  of  all, AAA just simply runs faster, due to its high speed CMOS
chip  design.   Everything  is  at  least  32  bits,  further  increasing
bandwidth.   Memory can now be accessed in "burst mode", which allows you
to  read  four  successive locations in memory very quickly.  And finaly,
VRAM!

  What's  VRAM?   It  stands  for  "Video RAM".  In order to get the high
transfer  rates  (bandwidth)  required  for  hi-res  displays,  VRAM  was
invented.   It  has  two  "ports" (and is hence also called "dual ported"
RAM),  one  exclusively  for video and one for accessing and changing the
bitmaps.  That effectively doubles the speed.

  With  VRAM,  there will be no more "video contention".  Ever notice how
slow your Amiga gets when you open up the largest, most colourfull screen
(640  x  400  x 16c for ECS or 640 x 400 x 256c for AGA)?  That's because
those  modes  need  so much bandwidth, that there is almost none left for
the CPU and blitter to use.

  In  the  AAA chipset, using VRAM, this won't be a problem anymore!  The
video  DMA  only uses one of the ports on the VRAM (in fact, this port is
designed  specificaly  for  video,  and  the  VRAM  has  a built in shift
register  for  this  purpose).   You can open the largest most colourfull
screen  you  can,  and  the  blitter  and copper etc won't slow down!  Of
course, they'll have more graphics to chew on..

  You  can  also  use  normal  everyday  DRAM,  which will be slower, but
cheaper.  VRAM costs about twice as much.  Luckily, you can combine both!
VRAM  is good just for the display, DRAM is good for everything else.  So
as  long  as  you have enough VRAM to open your screens, you're OK.  This
flexibility is a great advantage.  You can have upto 16MB divided between
DRAM and VRAM.

  So,  what  kind  of  resolutions  are  we  talking  about?  The maximum
resolution,  NON-INTERLACED,  should  be  around  1280 x 1024 (at 8 or 16
bits).   That's  quite a far cry from 640 x 480 x 8 in AGA.  It should be
able  to  do  1024  x  768 x 24 bits as well.  And it'll be FAST in these
modes.

  We'll also have our choice of chunky or bitplane modes.  Chunky will be
2, 4, 8 or 16 bits.  Bitplane mode will allow up to 16 planes.  The types
can  be  combined.  For a 24 bit mode, for instance, you would have three
bitplanes, each of which is an 8 bit chunky bitmap.

  There  is also some kind of new compressed display mode (in addition to
HAM  which  is  also  technicaly compressed).  Of course, there's HAM and
HAM8,  which  at a resolution of 1280 x 1024 will be very nice, and there
is  likely  to  be a HAM10 mode, giving 24 bit graphics with only 10 bits
per pixel!


Serial, floppies, mouses
------------------------

  As  if  that weren't enough, AAA does still more.  It has serial ports,
floppy drive support, and input device ports.

  The  two  joystick/mouse  ports  can  support  a wide range of devices,
including   standard  joysticks,  mechanical  and  optical  mice,  analog
joysticks, lightpens, and drawing tablets.

  AAA  also  has  two,  high speed buffered serial ports.  The old single
port  on AGA can handle as much as 115.2K Baud, but requiring significant
CPU  overhead  to prevent loosing characters.  AAA uses a FIFO buffer and
DMA  to  remove the overhead and danger of dropouts at high speeds.  This
will  come  as  great  news  to  those  planning on keeping up with modem
technology!

  Finaly,  the floppy port.  One of the most annoying things that has not
been upgraded, until now.  While AGA requires a special, half speed drive
to support HD floppies, AAA is so fast they don't even make a floppy that
can  keep  up!  It easily supports the Quad Density drives that are still
not  commonplace (High Density being the standard now).  And with AmigaOS
formating, that means 3.52MB on a disk!

  The  floppy  support  can handle the transfer rates of a CD-ROM or slow
HD,  which  is  far  in excess of current floppy drives.  So if they ever
make  an "Octa Density" floppy drive, AAA will be ready for it!  It could
also  handle  a  20MB  floptical  drive,  if there was a non-SCSI version
available.


A little help from a DSP
------------------------

  Though it's not part of the Amiga custom chip set, it fits right in.  A
DSP is a natural companion to the AAA chip set.

  A  DSP isn't limited just to sound, although it can be of great use for
creating  music  and  sound  effects.  But it can also be used for things
like  high-speed modem emulation (indeed, high speed modems have DSP's in
them),  speech synthesis, JPEG/MPEG image compression/decompression, data
aquisition   and  processing,  speech  recognition,  graphics  and  image
processing, and more.

  The  Amiga  DSP has a multitasking OS of it's own.  This allows the DSP
to  do many things at once, so you are not limited to just doing sound or
modem emulation.

  Commodore  has  selected  the  AT&T  3210  DSP.   This  is full 32 bit,
floating point processor (unlike the limited 24 bit fixed point processor
used  in Atari's Falcon).  It has an 8K on-chip memory cache and 33MFlops
of  computing  power,  and  shares  the  system bus with the Amiga's CPU,
giving  it  access  to  all memory and resources.  Finaly, there's a high
speed serial I/O port with DMA, capable of 24Mbit/sec transfers.


Last, but not least, the OS
---------------------------

  One  needs  an  OS to orchestrate the use of the hardware.  AmigaOS has
been maturing for almost 9 years now.  It now has most of the basic tools
needed for multimedia out of the box.

*   Pre-emptive   multitasking.    A   great   help,   especialy   in   a
hardware-oriented machine like the Amiga.

*  Advanced interprocess communication.  Adopting ARexx was a great move.
Any  application  can  communicate  with  another,  control  it, or offer
services  to  other  apps.   This  communication can even exist accross a
network (see "Envoy", Commodore's networking software).

*  Object  oriented  GUI.   While not yet being fully taken advantage of,
this  is  great  thing  for  the future.  An important offspring of this,
Datatypes, play an important role in multimedia.

*  Datatypes  :).   Datatypes allow applications to support multiple file
formats without any extra work.  Since Datatypes are objects, they can be
embeded  into  windows,  or even each other.  The full power of Datatypes
have yet to be realized.

  Currently,  Datatypes cover the basic multimedia data forms:  Pictures,
Sounds,  Animation, Hypertext.  Support for specific file formats include
the  standard  IFF  formats,  including  ILBM  (images),  ANIM  and  CDXL
(animation),  8SVX  (sound);  Amigaguide  (hypertext), ASCII text.  Third
party (public domain) datatypes cover GIF's, JPEG and other forms.

*  Multitasking  GUI.   The  AmigaOS GUI is designed with multitasking in
mind.   It  does not have such unfreindly things like "modal dialogs" and
other "features".

*  Fully  32 bit from the begining.  All Amiga apps are 32 bit.  There is
no baggage from 8 bit OS's.

* Extendable design.  Anyone can add new function libraries, or devices.

* Shared code libraries/devices.

* DSP support library(ies).

* This list goes on.. :)


Amiga, The Next Generation
--------------------------

  What  good  would AAA be, if it doesn't have a nice computer around it?
The "A5000" is going to be a perfect match for AAA.  Like AAA, it will be
a totaly new design.

*  Processor  independant,  high  speed  64 bit local bus.  So you aren't
locked  into  the  040  or  060.   When  you  are ready, go RISC, with no
bottlenecks.

  This  is  probably one of the most important aspects of the new system.
With  this  as  the backbone of the system, everything else will fly.  It
gives  massive  bandwidth  to  the  entire  system,  and a high degree of
modularity.

*  PCI slots.  A future industry standard.  Why go with this?  Isn't this
"anti  Amiga"?   Well,  why not.  PCI is good.  It's fast, it's standard,
it's perfect.  The Amiga will still have Zorro III slots, too.

*  64  bit memory.  While the 68040 and 68060 are only 32 bit processors,
having  64  bit memory actualy will speed things up.  It's also handy for
when you can add a 64 bit RISC processor.

*  Motorola  '040  and '060 CPU's.  The 40Mhz 040, and the upcoming 60Mhz
060 are still formidable processors.  They can hold their own against the
Pentium (PowerPC doesn't count, yet).

*  High  speed  SCSI-II on the motherboard, connected to the 64 bit local
bus.

*  DSP.   As if the AAA chipset isn't powerfull enough, you'll have a DSP
to play with too!


Why the A5000 is still a good idea
----------------------------------

  And  now,  the point to this article.  The primary feature of the A5000
will  be  the  level  of integration of the *system*.  All the parts will
cooperate  smoothly,  complementing  each other, and giving the system an
overall feel and power that is greater than the sum of its parts.

  Look  at  the  A5000  and  look at what the competition will have then.
Sure,  there  may  be individual areas where other machines will beat it.
Particularly,  IBM  clones  will  still  be  cheaper.   But as an overall
system, the A5000 will win for many applications.

  The  A5000  will  have very respectable graphics.  How many people will
have 1280 x 1024 graphics?  Such monitors are very expensive.

  How  many will have 8 voice 16 bit sound?  Cards that do that alone are
expensive.

  Will QuadDensity floppies be standard by then?  Probably not.

  Will  there  be  a  system  that  has  all these things, and more, in a
perfectly balanced system?

  Will  there  be  an  OS  for  it that uses all these features, and lets
applications take full advantage of them?

  The A5000 system is built right, from the ground up.  With a high speed
64  bit local bus at its core, a fast 32 bit CPU, a fast 32/64 bit custom
highly integrated multipurpose chip set, SCSI-II, DSP, and PCI slots, its
a formidable system.

  And  running on this hardware, you have an OS that already knows how to
use  all  this  power.   A very fast, multitasking kernel.  All the basic
multimedia extensions, built in.

  The  Amiga,  and  especialy  the A5000 (or whatever they call it), is a
perfect  multimedia  system.  It can go full blast doing sound, graphics,
communications, number crunching, multitasking, disk I/O, networking, etc
all at once with ease.

  I've  heard  altogether too many stories about Macs that just barf when
trying  to  multitask  with  serial  or  network transfers going on, slow
animation,  mega  expensive  video  hardware and software, and just plain
being slow no matter what you're doing.

  I  don't think the A5000 or AAA is too little, too late.  Sure, I think
Commodore could have created this machine two years ago (which would have
been mind blowing), but that's the way it goes.

  Lets  take a look at what you'd need to approximate the AAA chipset and
the A5000, if you have an IBM clone:

* Modern motherboard.

  64 bit local bus (CPU to DRAM).
  Full PCI slots.
  EISA or ISA or something for backwards compatibility.
  Sockets for plenty of 64 bit SIMM's (well, pairs of 32 bit SIMMs).

*  SVGA card

  PCI based, or built into motherboard.
  64 bit high speed bus interface.
  32 bit fast blitter.
  co-processor  (completely independant instruction list, can control ALL
    aspects of the system -- sound, video, blitter, sprites, etc).
  Sprites
  Bitplane (1 - 16), chunky (2, 4, 8, 16) and hybrid modes (8 x 8 x 8).
  VRAM, DRAM, in varying combinations.
  Upto 16MB VRAM/DRAM.
  Compressed video modes.

*  Sound card.

  8 voices, 16 bits each, 64Khz sampling.
  Separate volume and balance registers.
  DMA fed.

* Serial port card.

  2 high speed serial ports.
  FIFO buffers and DMA.

* Game port/mouse port/floppy/CD-ROM card

  Two ports, which support mice, joystick, lightpen, drawing tablets.

  Floppy port:
    Supports Quad Density disks.
    Is  fast  enough  to  support  CD-ROMs or other devices in this speed
      range (flopticals, etc).

* SCSI-II card

  PCI card or on motherboard.
  High speed SCSI-II FAST (10MB/sec).
  DMA driven.

* Powerfull OS

  Pre-emptive multitasking.
  Object oriented GUI.
  Datatypes.
  Interprocess communication.
  System script language (Rexx?).
  Etc.

  (this narrows it down to OS/2).

* DSP card

  PCI card or on motherboard.
  32 bit floating point DSP.
  33MFlops computing power.
  8K cache.
  Access to system memory.

I don't think you could set up such a system today, and the closest setup
would be very expensive.

ever invented runs on H.A.L. eh.. I.B.M.  And the people and companies
who were supporting Your PC have vaporized, dissapeared, dried up and
blown away. And your wife still ain't come home from the movies yet. 
Is that what's got you down boobie? 

Well I'd say from where your sitting your probably right, but everythings
relative chum.  From where I'm sittin it don't look like that at all. 
Maybe a change of perspctive will help. Certainly one more Mac vs Amiga 
won't.  What a dump idea, let's take two really super PC's and bash them 
together continuously. For what good reason? 

When I sit down in front of my Amiga I strap on my seatbelt cause
I know I'm taking the fastest ride in the business.  I've got an old A500
sitting in the cornner that's a more sophisticated computer than  any 
PC sold today straight out of the box. " A yeah right, but what has it 
done for me lately" you say.  I say the only thing sophisticated about 
IBM and compatibles is the support.  All the magazines, all the third 
party developement all the Compatible machines sitting on everyone's work
desk, all the  networking , Makes for a very sophisticated environment. 
But does it make for a sophisticated Machine? You figure it out.  

If you live in Britian you can laugh in the face of any other PC owner.
Why?  Because in Britian Amiga has the Numbers to back up the gloating.  
In Germany too Amiga owners walk down the street with pride.      
This is the same PC that people in America wringing there hands
over.  Well I've got some news for you, right now today in the cities and
towns of America their are more Amiga's being sold than ever before.
Its a fact, you can look it up.

Those kind of things are important.  Their important to know, because
the life of your PC is important.

But I could say what comes tomorrow is Pie in the Sky.
What about the PC sitting on your desk right now. There are not enough
ideas in your head to tire out this machine. There are more software 
packages sittimg on the shelves today to keep you entertained for the rest
of your life. "Yeah but what about the next big thing " you say.
I say the next big things already here it's called a "personal computer",
and if your's is an Amiga then your a very lucky guy (gal,droid,hamster)

If you want to argue with me your welcome to but I won't argue
with you. I haven't got time, I've got some Star gazing to do , some 
landscapes to render, some music to blast, some animations to think up,
some images to distort. some other universes to visit, and some ...
<insert thing to do here>.

%% CD32 A Long Term Perspective                              by RobMan %% 
%%                                                                     %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I've now been the proud owner of a CD32 for about four months,
so I thought I'd write and let you know how it performs. 

The first thing I did (essential) was to buy the great serial port 
adaptor ( A329 from Brian Fowler Computers) which allowed me to connect 
the CD32 to my '020 A500+ with a nullmodem cable. Using the Almathera 
CDPD3 disk, which has the Terminus comms package on it, I am able to 
download AGA images and utils to the CD32s RAMdisk and display/use them 
in all of their AGA  glory, which is amazing to behold having been used 
to OCS and ECS for the past six years!! The CD32 also includes Workbench
3.0, so I'm having an interesting time exploring its potential.

The next important step was to improve the quality of the display that I 
was getting from my 1084S. When I purchased the CD32, I was told that I 
had to connect it to my 1084S via the composite video sockets. This works 
fine, but as soon as you try to display any fairly small text on the 
screen it becomes very blurred and unreadable (this also happens in some
of the games). Not to fear, S-VHS is here! After a quick call to CBM, I 
had a fax of the S-VHS port pin-outs and a cable was constructed from an 
old Apple Mac keyboard cable and an old A500 tv modulator cable (I'm 
posting the details on Aminet under Hard/Hack/SVHSCD32.lha). To make this 
cable from scratch components should cost less than 33UK. So, connecting 
this to the luminance andchrominance sockets of the 1084S gives SUPERB 
quality images from the CD32. I only wish I'd made the cable sooner! 

What about the machine itself? Looks tacky, performs excellently. CD 
audioquality is great, particularly when hooked up to a hi-fi. A4000 
keyboard works a treat too, as does any Amiga mouse/joystick (including 
my now TEN YEAR OLD (wow!) Competition Pro 5000).

FMV is out over here, but the currently available movies and  music
videos are a bit lacking in both quantity and quality (from a movie-
lover's pointof view, not the quality of MPEG!). It costs 199UK and is 
bundled with a disc, but don't ask me which one. More importantly, the 
Microbotics SXI expansion unit (serial, parallel, floppy, RGB, SIMM, 
FMV thru' and IDE) will be shipping over hereon March 17th and will cost 
A3139. I believe  this also includes Parnetsoftware/hardware, although 
that maybe only from Indi Direct Mail Order. 

At last, access to my A500+'s hard disks!And what of the software? As you 
probably know, Liberation is rather cool (although not exactly Doom in the 
graphics department) and there are a multitude of other excellent games 
waiting in the wings (TFX, Rise Of The Robots - where are you!). 
Shovelware is available in abundance (see the full software list for 
details). However, by far the most used disks in my collection are 
Almathera's CDPD3 and Demo2 cd's. These autobooting extraveganzas contain
so much software, its just amazing! Most of it is fairly recent, and  it 
has to be worth it just to experience Workbench 3 for the first time! Both
cost approx. 20UK and are guaranteed to be the best 40UK you spent since 
you bought that 1/2 meg expansion in 1989. When the Microbotics expansion 
is released, the CD32 can be booted from floppy and then you can access 
those CDs that don't autoboot, or are limited when they do, such as the 
Multimedia Toolkit (hundreds of images,icons, fonts, samples, tunes, 
clip art), 17Bit collections (thousands of Pounds worth of PD disks for 
about 50UK for 3 CDs), the early Fred Fish collection and the Aminet CD. 
I really can't wait - I had a taste of this when I hooked a borrowed Apple 
CD300 up to the A500+! 

The CD32 is an excellent machine with a realistic price tag, and the power 
to run some great games. I'm sure in a few months we're gonna be jumping 
with glee at the quality of the software we're getting.

BUY ONE!

Low Cost Emulation Fun with the Commodore Amiga 2088 XT Bridgeboard
 
A Long Time Ago
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Just thought I'd write in and tell you of my experiences with
emulation on the Amiga.  When I was younger and naive to the Amiga world
(still am in a way), I read the literature on the Amiga 2000, and told
myself I'd get a A2000 with the XT Bridgeboard.  While crossborder shopping
in Buffalo from my hometown of Toronto, Canada, a dealer gave me some words
of advice:
 
	"Don't waste your money.  Get a hard disk instead."
 
	I ended up buying an Amiga 2000HD without an XT Bridgeboard.  Most
of you are laughing at me, since I actually thought a one floppy XT
compatible A2000 would be useful, but I was almost dead set on getting one.
Lucky me that the dealer in Buffalo straightened me out.
 
Further Along
~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Along my bumpy road, I tried everything on my new Amiga, and I bought
a SupraRAM memory expander, an extra hard disk, a genlock, a CDRom, a 
doormat,
a little stuffed animal, a new bicycle...
 
	...and four years later, I had a piece of trash that I called my
Amiga.  Everyone else had A3000's, and A4000's, with SCSI hard disks, big
multisync monitors and VideoToasters.  It was nearing Christmas, 1993.
I was starting to hate my boring old 68000 Amiga 2000. What possibly
could make my Amiga interesting again?
 
The Deal
~~~~~~~
	Reading my local BBS ads, I found a guy trying to sell his
Bridgeboard for $30.  I gave the guy a call and offered him $20 for it.
The rendezvous was set and we met on a Friday night at the Royal York
subway station in West Toronto to do the big exchange.
 
	It was like those spy movies.  Ooooh.  Scary.  I had twenty bucks
on me.  I needed to make a phone call.  The guy showed up.  I told him I
needed a quarter.  I ended up paying him $19.75.  I made my phone call.  I
had my Bridgeboard.  Now the fun began.
 
Getting the Darn Thing Home
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	For $19.75, Canadian dollars, exact change, I got myself one used
A2088D board, a 5 1/4 drive, cables, a serial and memory expansion board
for the PC side and three boxes of disks.
 
	I installed it into my A2000, with 3MB of of RAM, A2300 Genlock and
60MB HD.  I was ready to have fun.  Lots of fun, when I was informed that
my Janus software wouldn't work with Workbench version 2.1.
 
	Revisions later, I got my cards installed, twisting and turning
cables, and placing drives where drives shouldn't be.  Like having a Rodime
40MB HD and a 3.5" floppy on the top two bays, the Bridgecard 5.25" on the
bottom bay, and a Miniscribe 21MB HD wedged between the drive cage and the
power supply, vertically, blocking almost all ventilation.  But hell, this
was fun.  
 
Space: The Final Frontier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Unlike other reviewers, who have megabytes and gigabytes of space
to review their products, I have about zilch HD space.  Out went the
Xapshot pictures of my friends, old publishing files, fonts I didn't like,
PD archives which were boring, the free copy of MediaShow I won at World of
Commodore Amiga last year...
 
	...and I had ten MB free! Okay! We're having fun now! Install the
software.  Put the virtual drive in.  Yes!!!! We have.....boot! Yeah! uh
oh.  No boot disk.  Honk.
 
Getting the Boot Disk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	I can handle this.  I own three PC compatibles, a 386DX, and two
386SX's.  This is not beyond me.  Just get the disks from the old
boxes...and...shoot...where's the boxes?
 
	Ah.  Let's take a short trip.  Visit my aunt.  Proud owners of a
PS/1.  Borrow their DOS boot disks.  Return home.  Yes!!! We have.....boot!
Yeah! Drat.  Wrong size disks.
 
Steal the Drive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	I visit my old friend Andrew Rowat.  Borrow his external A1010
drive and hook it into my A2088D's back port.  Try booting.  It doesn't
recognize the the A1010 as drive A.  Back to square one.
 
	Ripped open the Amiga.  Detached the 5.25" drive.  Swiped a clone
3.5" drive to the bridgeboard as device 0.  And it works.
 
Fun with Manuals: Installing DOS 5.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	IBM DOS Installation software comes up.  Format.  Prep.  Copy.
Wham-bang, floppy-copy.  And we have an XT. Yes, fun on a Zorro II card.
 
Okay, Software!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Conversation with PC expert friend, around December:
 
	Me: Hey, what's new in the PC world (never use my PCs)
	Friend: Uh, OS/2, Doom, AutoDesk 3D Studio...
	Me: Great! Where can I get these?
	Friend: Your local clone store.
	Me: I just got an emulation board!  I've having fun.
	Friend: What do you have on it?
	Me: 8088 at 4.77 MHz, 640K of RAM. Can I run them?
 
	End of Conversation.  Friend leaves, laughing.
 
Digging Out Old Stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Finding old software that runs on my A2088 was difficult.  An old
copy of Microsoft Works v1.0.  My Logitech Kidz Mouse and it's drivers.  A
few old CGA shareware games.  Microsoft Works runs great.  Now I can write
letters with no fonts and nonproportional spacing.  Yeah! Fun!
 
	I was beginning to be depressed.  Emulation wasn't as fun as it was
all made out to be.  Maybe it was because they all had Emplants and Golden
Gate 486's.  I didn't touch my Bridgeboard for a long time.  I was starting
to regret my $19.75 investment in fun.  (cue violins)
 
I See the Light
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Just when things were getting worse, I noticed that my NEC
UltraLite notebook had a copy of LapLink on it.  I read the instructions,
and lo and behold, all you needed was a serial cable.  I had one of those.
And a copy of LapLink on a PC XT.  I have one of those.  The fun was
starting again.
 
	Connected my Bridgeboard to my notebook.  Started whipping files
back and forth at 115K.  Wow.  Printed my notes and reports on my Amiga
after sending them back and forth.  The Bridgeboard was beginning to have
some use!  But this was only the beginning...
 
	...when a boatload of five inch disks from friends started coming
in.  I could collect submissions and articles from them and convert them
for publishing on the Amiga through the Bridgeboard...
 
	...and I found a QWK mail reader for the PC, which I could read
mail with on my PC side while my Amiga downloaded files...
 
	...and a ZIP archiver to let my PC side batchprocess archives while
I used my Amiga at full speed for other stuff, without dedicating any of my
processing time on the 68000...
 
	...and I found out that InterLego AG makes a really niftycool Lego
robot controller only on the PC, and not on the Amiga...
 
	...and that the extra serial port was like having two terms running
at once...
 
The Moral of This Story: Brush Your Teeth Everyday!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	I finally found some good uses for the XT Bridgeboard.  I was
having fun again with my Amiga.  It's like having an extra computer around
to muck with when your Amiga is bogged down with tasks.
 
	So, wholeheartedly, I can recommend, for a parking lot of fun,
getting an old used XT Bridgeboard, for $19.75.

Full-motion video, revisited
----------------------------

A few issues bag, I wrote a quick and negative article about
the FMV-module for the CD32. Here's more:

A Philips employee told me that it's true that there are a lot
of "knobs" to turn when recording a digital video CD. This to
the extent that the quality of the finished product depends a
lot on the money and work spent to perform the conversion. And
the poor quality on some of the early titles is a reflection of
that: They were rushed to the market, more or less. If you
recall, the first sound CD titles sounded quite awful - it took
some time for the engineers to learn to do it right. It seems
likely that the quality will improve.

There is apparently no quality difference between Philips' CD-I
digital video format and the VideoCD format Commodore's sub-
scribed to. Both follow the MPEG-1 whitebook. The difference is
in the way the data's been put on the disc.

Having spent a few hours in a quiet room with Ridley Scott's
"Black Rain" on CD, I'll elaborate my initial feelings about
FMV a bit: Half of the time, I think it's absolutely great. The
colors are nice and steady. The sound is _great_, wonderful
stereo. It's just that sometimes a face freezes, sometimes it
seems that the children walking up a stair jump a few frames.
The almost unmoving scenes are OK, the freezing faces I'll
learn to live with. The action scenes are OK as well, perhaps
there's too much happening for the eye to notice problems. But
freeze frames in action scenes sometimes look absolutely
horrible; some still pictures of a fast-moving Michael Douglas
are completely unrecognizable. It's like a low, low, low
quality JPEG picture, the picture is even split into little (I
think) 8 x 8 pixel (and very visible) squares. It becomes
extremely blocky, and Michael Douglas looks as much like
Godzilla in a dim room as a human.

Also, I watched Seal's "Killer" video on the current dealer-
demo CD. (Commodore continually produces new dealer CDs,
featuring demos of different games, the CD32 "Creation" ad in
both MPEG and CDXL (for the basic machine) video.) The video
looked very good, but I found that the sound had occasional
cracks. And try looking closely at the suit Seal's wearing, it
looks distinctly like Mandelbrot graphics on an Amiga, color-
cycling! I'm sure it is.

The currently avaliable video CDs are: Andrew Lloyd Webber,
Black Rain, Bon Jovi: Keep the faith, Hanna Barbera's Cartoon
Festival, Patriot Games, Star Trek VI, Top Gun.
A lot more are coming soon, including: Apocalypse Now (yes!),
Billy Ray Cyrus Live, Bryan Adams: Waking up the Neighbours,
Eric Clapton: The Cream of Clapton, The Firm, The Hunt for Red
October, Sliver, and ...... Fatal Attraction Director's Cut. I
thought Director's cut was strictly for good movies? What'll it
be? 30-minute sex scenes? Glenn Close refusing to die for 45
additional minutes? I don't get it?

But I think I'm getting to like this digital video thing.


SeaQuest
--------

Commodore has put some effort into promoting the Steven Spiel-
berg/Amiga-Produced series. The pilot episode was in Germany
watched by some 17 million viewers, this included the "Commo-
dore - Amiga praesentiert"-trailer. (You figure out what it
means.)
Commodore and RTL (the station showing SeaQuest) has staged an
animation-competition. Prize is 5000DM (around US$2500) and a
few hours backstage at RTL. Animations must be 10-15 seconds,
produced on Amiga, Mac, or PC, and put on VHS, SVHS, Video8, or
Hi8. Only "amateurs" can participate, whatever it means. I do
suppose they want PAL. Closing date is April 15th, 1994. The
animation is supposed to be shown just before every show, so it
seems a good idea to make it relate to SeaQuest in some way.

Expanding the CD32
------------------

P&K Computer has announced a CD32 expansion box for around the
time I write this. (March 17th.) The box brings you a 3.5 inch
floppy, serial, parallel, floppy, and RGB ports, and room for a
3.5 inch Harddrive.
No word of keyboard or additional power-supply.

Price is DM495 (around US$ 250).

>From the 16th to the 20th of March, Europes biggest computer
fair takes place in Hannover, Germany. If you were there,
please email me so I can write a bit about it.

That's all for now. Sometime soon I'll be looking at a PowerPC,
and I'll compare a Sillicon Graphics Indigo machine to an
A4000/040. Stay netted.

            Using Crons and Crontabs - by David Tiberio

        There may be a large number of you out there who, like me,
    either leave your computer on all the time or use it at a
    regular time on a daily basis. When this is the case, it is
    nice to have a crontab to perform tasks throughout any given
    day.

        For example, I have a terrible time getting ready for school.
    My clocks all tell different times, and sometimes when trying to
    turn them off in the morning I accidentally set the time a few
    minutes ahead. And I have 4 alarms! One is about 10 minutes
    ahead, my watch is 10 minutes ahead, another clock is 30 minutes
    ahead, and another is 40 minutes ahead. Although after this
    morning I think there may be a new record...

        Another problem I have is that on Monday, Wednesday, and
    Friday, I have to go to class at 8:20am, which on Tuesday and
    Thursday, I go to class at 8:30am. As luck would have it, I
    arrive early twice a week and barely make it three times a week.

        Now here is where my crontab comes in. My computer is on all
    night. Overnight, it performs operations that I feel are needed.
    For example, when I ran a BBS it used to backup my files, or
    download UUCP news from another BBS. But now it wakes me up in
    the morning. Every ten minutes it announces the time using the
    narrator.device. But on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I set it
    to announce the time ten minutes early, so at 8:00am it will
    announce that it is 8:10am, time to be at class. :)

        Another use is for it to remind me which books to take to
    class, or on weekends, to remind me that there are no classes.
    Same when classes are canceled. Since my loft is above my
    computer, I don't even have to get out of bed.

        At 2pm it reminds me that the bank closes in one hour. At
    4pm it reminds me that the post office closes soon. Although
    I do not go to each every day, I do go at least once a week,
    which makes it very useful.

        On Thursday nights at 7:55pm, time to put the TV on channel 5.
    Then at 8:55pm, time for channel 4. Once 11pm comes around, I
    am reminded to finish my homework. And at midnight, it reminds me
    to go to sleep. Also for the sake of security, I get reminded a
    few more times after that just so the point gets across.

        But there are other uses. Every morning at 6:01am, my
    PhonePak Lineman is executed. This program must be running at all
    times in case someone calls, making it capable of answering the
    phone or accepting a FAX. If Lineman is not running (I may
    accidentally close the window, which I do often), it will be
    executed. If it is already running, it will not execute another
    copy.


        Here is a sample s:crontab file. Comments are followed by
    a # symbol.

#<min> <hour> <day> <month> <week_day> [<command>]
00 6  * * 2,4       say six ay em. time to wake up.
01 6  * * *         run sys:wbstartup/lineman
02 6  * * 1,2,3,4,5 execute s:wakeup-sequence
45 6  * * 0,6       c:hear -b 15000 xdh1:iff.8svx/goodvibrations.8svx

        At 00 minutes 6 hours, every day, every month, on the second
    and fourth days of the week, the system announces the current time.
    One minute later, my PhonePak is put online in the event that it
    was closed the day before. At 6:02am, a wakeup-sequence script is
    executed which ensures that I will wake up. And later at 6:45am,
    on weekends, it plays a few minutes of an audio sample off of my
    hard drive (nice song to wake to).


        The format for the crontab is simple:

    minutes hours date months weekdays commands

        MINUTES ranges from 00 to 59
        HOURS ranges from 0 to 23, 24 hour time
        DATE ranges from 1 to 31 (day of the month)
        MONTHS ranges from 1 to 12 (January to December)
        WEEKDAYS ranges from 0 to 6 (Sunday to Saturday)
        COMMANDS includes any standard CLI/Shell command and arguments


        Here are some more samples:

* * * * *           #every second
00 * * * *          #beginning of every hour
00 0,12 * * *       #beginning of hour at midnight and noon
00 1 3 7 *          #July 4th at 1:00am


        Good luck in using crontabs. In order to use them with your
    Amiga, you will need a cron reader, such as CyberCron, DCron, or
    TPTCron. Of the ones I have tested, I found Cybercron to be the
    most stable under Workbench 2.04.

        Check Fred Fish disks or look for these two files on Aminet.

CyberCron15.lha      os20/cli    78K+Schedule jobs at specific times.
TPTCron.lha          util/cli    32K*Executes jobs repeatedly at given 
                                     times

%% Desktop Publishing--Amiga Style                         By Tom Reamer %%

Desktop Publishing is one of the most exciting computer aided forms of art
that one can partake in.  You are probably saying to yourself, "WHAT?  
DTP, an art form?".  It sure is, anything that you design is considered an
art and as you go along you will find yourself at the edge of your seat 
either pulling your hair out or begging for more.  DTP can be expensive 
depending on how you use your available tools.  In this first edition of 
Desktop Publishing made easy, I am going to give some hints and tips that 
you will find extremely helpful.  Many people who already use their 
Amiga's for desktop publishing quickly found out that the Amiga is an 
incredibly powerful machine that surpasses the others even in this field.
Our resources are not as large as the IBM and MAC base but we have the 
tools to do the job well.  I am going to focus on the most widely used 
program for layout design; Pagestream 2.2   (PS)

Pagestream has some awesome features that even the faint of heart could
learn.  For those of us who do not wish to read manuals and like to jump 
right in and play,

Pagestream is there for the taking, making it somewhat easy to get what 
you want off the screen and onto the paper.  There are some basic 
guidelines that you must follow in order to make your "document" exciting
enough for the viewer to keep reading. Eye catching enough for the viewer 
to be pulled into the message that you are trying to convey.  This is 
where TYPE comes in.  Many people will concentrate on graphics and 
layout and will overlook the message conveying type.  There are a number 
of different ways to use type to add impact.  You can change the look and
feel of an entire sentence by simply changing the type.  Avoid over used 
typefaces such as Avant Garde, Times, Zapf Chancery, Bookman etc.  They 
look good but they are plainly used by everyone else.  Although your HD 
space is probably limited, get a hold of as many fonts as you can.  You 
will be surprised how many of them you can and will use.  Make that type 
BIG!  Why not?  You have the space and nothing is more eye-catching than a
fantastic looking huge font.  Literally make a point!  50, 60, 70, make 
that point size over 100!  Before I forget to mention..Stay AWAY from 
BITMAP FONTS!  They are the worst and if made any bigger all you will 
see is jaggies.  Stick to scalable fonts for the cleanest reproduction 
of your type onto paper and on the screen.  When type is large,they 
become more of a graphic element than a letter.  You can also do the 
opposite be surrounding small text with a large amount of white space.  
Now back to what we were trying to get to.  The HEADLINE!  Many people 
who glance at your layout will often read one thing.  You guessed it!  
The headline.  They should be at least twice the size of your text but 
can happily be larger than that.

Don't forget to add a subhead.  Subheads help the reader to find what they
are looking for, they also add 'visual' interest to the page.  Don't make
it tiny. Make it stand out but not to the point where it over powers  your
headline.  I like to add subheads to help the readers eyes follow the page
down.  Psychology my friend.  

Why not use a drop cap?  I need not explain how interesting it is to read
a line starting with a wonderful first letter font dropped to perfection.
Drop caps can easily be any size without break ing any rules; even a 100 
point size will show off your type.  The drop cap will look its best when
it fits it's allowed space exactly.  Be sure to align the bottom of the 
drop cap with the line of text it is next to.  Don't over do it. To many 
drop caps will defeat your purpose.  They will attract the readers eye to
them and not your message.  

     I love to use type known as "display typefaces".  These fonts have
beautiful attributes to them.  You know the ones, the type that you just 
have to use.  The Chancery type fonts with leaves, curves, the ornamental
fonts!  Again, do not over do it, if it seems fit use it.

     Now that you know the basics of what to do, how about the basics of 
how to do it? Before I go into that remember one thing, this may not 
always be true with Photography, but I feel it is extremely important in
DTP.  CENTER IT.  If your page is off center it certainly will not help 
you out one bit.  You will soon find yourself centering everything.  Every
page you see done by someone else will stand out on the edges and in 
between.  You will not read the document right away, you will first look 
for the centering!  Trust me, I am obsessed with it.  Specially when the
layout is done on an IBM or MAC.  Glad I put that past us both.  But 
DON'T FORGET IT!  The biggest strength Pagestream has over other design
software is the ability to put anything on the page without having to use
boxes.  With your mouse click on the large A in the tools bar on the 
right.  This is your FONT tool.  Click anywhere you would like to place
text on the page.  Pick a font from your fonts directory up  in the menu
bar--click/click.  Also pick the point size--click/click.  Select OK.  Now
you can freely type away. When you are finished use your mouse to select 
the arrow on the tools bar.  Click on the text; you will notice that there
is now a light box around it.  You can do as you wish with the font now...
Resize it, move it, right Amiga-X it (to cut) all by placing your pointer 
on the edges of the box.  You can also change the color as you see fit.  
This is done by simply selecting Fill Style  in the object menu.

     I would like to go on some more with this, but I have probably went 
to fast as it is.  I am sure you have noticed that I mentioned mostly 
fonts used on Macs and IBM's. I did this on purpose; reason being is that
we are surrounded by these machines and those are the fonts you see the 
most.  With the simple document guidelines above and the quick tutorial, 
this should give you a basic idea on how to make a great looking layout.  
Nothing comes without practice so load up that program and get to work.
The Amiga is a very strong contender in the DTP world.  With people 
unaware of the Amiga's potential as a DTP device, that just leaves less 
great computers to compete with.

Enjoy!

%% Your friendly E-mail Gateways                    by Jonathan Guidry %%
%%                                                Fido-net: 1:3803/6.1 %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Ever wanted to send an electronic mail item to a person on a totally
different network than which you are a member?  If you have access to
Internet E-mail (FIDOnet users, see note at bottom), you can send mail to
other networks.  The networks that I currently know of that you can send
E-mail to somebody (through Internet mail) are:  GEnie, Compuserve, 
Delphi, BIX, and FIDOnet, and of course, Internet. :)

* Bix *
Format:  Username@bix.com
Example: JBLEAUX@bix.com

* Compuserve * 
Format:  number.address@compuserve.com
Example: 73113.3141@compuserve.com
Note:    Make sure to use a period and not a comma in the address

* GEnie *
Format:  Username@Genie.geis.com
Example: J.BLEAUX@Genie.geis.com

* Delphi *
Format:  Username@delphi.com
Example: JBLEAUX@delphi.com

* Portal *
Format:  Username@cup.portal.com
Example: JBLEAUX@cup.portal.com

* Fidonet *
Format:  FirstName.Lastname@pX.fX.nXXXX.zX.fidonet.org
Example: Jonathan.Guidry@p6.f1.n3803.z1.fidonet.org
Key:     p = the POINT of the system
         f = the NODE of the system
         n = the NET of the system
         z = the ZONE of the system

     For example, if I'm 1:3803/3.4 in FIDOnet, my ZONE is 1, my NET is
3803, my NODE is 3, and my POINT is 4.  If the person doesn't have a POINT
in his addrrss, you can omit the "pX" from the address, thus making the
format:  FirstName.Lastname@fX.nXXXX.zX.fidonet.org

FIDO NOTE:

If you are a FIDOnet user, and have access to "NETMAIL", then you can send
Internet mail.  Follow these instructions:

Address the message to "Uucp" at 1:1/31.  The subject can be anything.
In the FIRST line of your message, type "To: username@machine.domain",
leave a blank line, then start your message.  It will be routed to a
FIDOnet to Internet "Gateway" and your message will get out.  By using
this, you can send Internet E-Mail, and thus, you can use the address
formats mentioned above to send mail to GEnie, ect..  Just, please don't
annoy the "Gateway" sysop and send Internet gated FIDOnet netmail to 
yourself.


If you have any questions, complaints, suggestions, or need clarification
on something, mail me at 1:3803/6.1 on FIDONET, or use
Jonathan.Guidry@p1.f6.n3803.z1.fidonet.org.

                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

  Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

  The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software, online.

  Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command.

   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES.

  35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

  No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

  Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

  Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

  Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.

   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

  Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

  And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

  Direct rates also apply to connections made to Portal using the
  UNIX "telnet" program from an account you may already
  have on an Internet-connected system. 
% 9600 bps Sprintnet in over 300 cities areas
+ $10 rate prevails at smaller US Cities
# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]
