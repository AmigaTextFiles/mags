(Founder of Scala, Vice President New Business Development)</p>

Scala is in the business of computer television: that is, using a computer
to produce and distribute television type programming.</p>

The company is one of the world's leading developers of computer-based
television information solutions and the undisputed leader in multimedia
software fot the Amiga platform.  Available in eleven languages, Scala's
multimedia tools are distributed in more than 40 countries.</p>

Scala was founded in Norway in 1987.  Today we are headquartered outside
Washington, DC, with international headquarters in Oslo and offices in the
United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden.  Scala's team of
sortware engineers includes most of the people who originally developed
the Amiga operating system for Commodore.</p>

Our main products are Scala MultiMedia, a software package for the
production and playback of multimedia presentations, interactive training
applications, infotainment, and video titling; Scala InfoChannel, for
multimedia networking and information distribution; and Scala Interactive
Television, including software for the production of TV content and the
operating environment for satellite and cable TV decoders.</p>

All products share the Scala BackBone technology.  This makes the software
independent of hardware platorm and makes the Scala solutions portable to
multiple environments.  BackBone includes MMOS, which is an
object-oriented operating system layer specifically developed for
multimedia applications, and ScalaScript which is the scripting language
we seek to establish as the standard multimedia language of the future.</p>

Since the Amiga went out of production a year ago Scala has seen a
constant demand for Amigas, from both new and experienced users.  We are
happy to see production resume, and to continue to support the Amiga
platform.</p>

Together the Scala software technology and the Amiga hardware technology
make up a powerful and cost effective solution for everyone who needs a
multimedia package for home or office use.  No other solution can match
the price performance of the Amiga and Scala combination.  We look forward
to working closely with the neew Amiga Technologies company in order to
provide ready-to-use solutions with every machine.</p>

Scala's good design has long been one of our strongest assets, and it is
an acknowledgement of our achievements that Escom has chosen one of our
designers to create the new look for the new Amiga.</p>
