</ul>
                            
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
<ul> Any Amiga with a hard drive and running at least
Workbench 2.x can use Directory Opus 5 (DOpus 5).  I would recommend at
least 1 MB of free FAST RAM to operate this program.</p>
</ul>
SYSTEM TESTED ON:
<ul> Amiga 2000 (Rev 4.4), ECS chip set, GForce '030
                  accelerator @ 50 MHz., 2 MB CHIP + 8 MB FAST memory,
                  Quantum LPS270S hard drive with Trumpcard Professional
                  controller, Picasso II RTG board, Workbench 3.1</p>
</ul>
PACKAGING: 
<ul>The DOpus 5 package consisted of a shrink wrapped, 174 page,
spiral bound manual with 1 floppy disk inside.</p>
</ul>
INSTALLATION:
<ul>DOpus 5 uses the standard Commodore installer utility, so,
as usual, installation is a breeze.  Upon launching the installer, you are
presented with several choices of install methods: Start DOpus 5 on boot,
Start DOpus 5 iconified, Use DOpus 5 as Workbench replacement, and Don't
start DOpus 5 on boot.  All of these are self-explanatory, except use
DOpus 5 as Workbench replacement.  If you choose to use DOpus 5 as a
Workbench replacement, your LoadWB command will be renamed and a startup
file for DOpus 5 will be put in its place.   After selecting one of the
install options for DOpus 5 the script creates a DOpus 5 drawer on the
hard drive partition you selected and copies the appropriate files there.
Finally, an assign line is added to your User-Startup script.   One final
note, if you are using a ROM switcher and you have renamed the original
Startup-Sequence then you must rename the original Startup-Sequence so
that the DOpus 5 install script can find it; otherwise, you will get an
error and have to abort the install.</p>
</ul>
FIRST IMPRESSIONS: 
<ul>If you are use to the look and feel of DOpus 4.x then
you will immediately notice that DOpus 5 is a complete rewrite of its
predecessors.  The interface is almost completely new and fresh.  DOpus 5
opens its own screen, of your choice, which strongly resembles a Workbench
2.x+ screen (a backdrop picture can even be used!) Most of the same
pulldown menu choices are present with several DOpus 5-specific additions.
Icons for all devices appear just as on Workbench.  I had icons for my
Boot and Work partitions, as well as the RAM Disk appeared on the main
screen with the initial startup of DOpus 5.  Also, a floating palette of
buttons for performing various tasks and a RAM Disk Lister appeared on the
screen.  At this point, you are ready to go!  My honest first impression
was, this looks confusing!</p>
</ul>
DOWN TO BRASS TACKS: 
<ul>Upon exploring the new features and look of DOpus 5 I
quickly realized just how powerful this version is.  The confusion I felt
with my first look at the new utility quickly faded as I began to use it.</p>
     You can click on any of the device icons that appear on the screen
and open a floating Lister window.  Each Lister window has a Title Bar
which displays the device name and the amount of free space left on that
particular device.  Directly below the Title Bar is a Status Bar which
displays: the number of selected directories out of the total number of
directories displayed, the number of selected files out of the total
number of files displayed, and the number of bytes selected out of the
total number of bytes displayed.  To the immediate right of these are the
Lister Command Menu and the Device Gadget.  These allow you to perform
various actions on the selected files from a pulldown menu, as well as
directory manipulations.  The final item on this line is the Status Gadget
which displays the state that the Lister is in i.e.  SOURCE, DESTINATION,
or OFF.  You can change the state by clicking within the Status Bar.  The
last area before the actual file listings is the Lister Tool Bar which is
full of various icon presentations for file and directory manipulation.
The icons are: DeviceList/CacheList, Parent/Root, All/None, Select/Toggle,
MakeDir, Copy/CopyAs, Move/MoveAs, ReName, Delete, Show, Play, Protect,
Comment, and DateStamp.  The icons of the Tool Bar are accessed by the
left and right mouse buttons, also actions may be assigned to the middle
mouse button.  The Tool Bar can be customized any way you like, including
the addition and subtraction of icons.</p>

     The area of the Lister that actually shows the files and directories
of the selected device can be customized as well.  You can select the
order in which the items are sorted and what part of the file's attributes
are used for the sort order.  The Lister's display can also contain as
much information or as little as you desire.  At the bottom of the Lister
is a window where the complete path is shown.  You can manually type a new
path if you so desire.  Maneuvering around in the Lister window can be
accomplished by: holding the right mouse button down and moving the mouse
pointer up/down/left/right (the listing will scroll to follow the mouse
pointer's movement), using the cursor keys, using the numeric keypad's
Home/End/PgUp/PgDn keys. </p>

     The pulldown menus on the DOpus 5 main screen consist of the
following options (I've included short definitions where appropriate):</p>
<ul><li>     OPUS
<ul><li>          BACKDROP
<li>          EXECUTE COMMAND

          drawer in that programs can be launched from here without having
          the entire program's related files located in this drawer.  You
          could make a Program Group that held all of your word
          processors, paint programs, etc.)

<li>     USER (customized user menu)</p>
</ul>
OTHER FEATURES:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Drag and Drop support for highlighting directories or files and
then dropping them in another Lister to be copied or unarchived etc.  You
can also just drag these directories or files outside of the Lister and
drop them on the main screen for easy access.</p>

<li>The middle mouse button has full support for a wide range of functions
associated with Buttons and Tool Bar icons, providing you aren't using a
Commodity such as MultiCX which enables the middle mouse button for
switching between screens.</p>

<li>Floating button bars make it easy to customize your DOpus 5 layout with
only the most needed functions which aren't supported, or conveniently
accessed, by an icon on the Tool Bar or a menu choice in the User menu.</p>

<li>ARexx support.</p>

<li>Data Type support.</p>

<li>The mouse pointer sensitive help function will pull up an Amigaguide
document specific to the item you are pointing at when pressing the HELP
key.</p>

<li>Enhanced Search requestor which supports simple and complex searches.</p>

<li>Enhanced Pattern Matching which supports simple and complex searches.</p>

<li>The ability to change the DateStamp of any file or directory.</p>

<li>Your old DOpus 4 configuration can be imported into DOpus 5.  The look
of DOpus 5 will change to look just like the old familiar DOpus 4 if you
choose to do so.  Frankly, this defeats the purpose and power of the new
DOpus 5.  I don't recommend it.</p>
</ul>
DISLIKES & BUGS:</p>
<ul>
I miss the CPU usage display on the main title bar. </p>
     The ability to set a window close delay has been removed.  This means
that you have to either add a close gadget to any window that shows output
from a DOpus 5 function i.e.  LHA dearchiving etc., or add an AmigaDOS
WAIT command to that particular function's activity.  It was easier to
just set the close delay under DOpus 4.  When selecting a Backdrop for use
on the DOpus 5 main screen, you must select the desired image from within
your Prefs/WBPattern requestor and then use SaveAs.  If you just select
any old image from the DOpus 5 Backdrop requestor, it won't work. </p>

     You have to type in a lengthy registration number that locks the copy
of DOpus 5 on to the hard drive to which it was installed.  If you copy
the program to another drive or use a hard drive defragmenter (ReOrg
etc.), you have to reregister the program by typing in the registration
number again!</p>

     I have experienced crashes when working with DOpus 5 with my Picasso
II board and Workbench 3.1 setup.  Closing the Button Paint Palette with
its close gadget will cause a GURU every time on my system.</p>
</ul>
SUMMARY:
<ul> Directory Opus 5 is very powerful.  It offers a fully
multi-threaded, internally multitasking suite of programs.  You can have
multiple destination Listers open and be copying files etc.  to each
destination Lister from the source, formatting multiple floppies,
unarchiving or archivng files, editing files, etc.  -- all at the same
time!  Any of these individual tasks can be aborted without affecting any
of the other tasks which are running concurrently. </p>

     DOpus 5 offers a fresh new look and a functionality heretofore
unheard of on the Amiga platform.  The author is easily contacted via
Email and he replies promptly, usually within one day.  I strongly
recommend that any power user of the Amiga get this program -- it's well
worth it.
