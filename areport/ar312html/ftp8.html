DESCRIPTION
<ul>
A picture management (including PhotoCD) and presentation software for the
EGS graphical environment.</p>

This software enables all EGS users (e.g.  users of the typical EGS
graphic boards as Piccolo, Piccolo-SD64, EGS-Spectrum, EGS-110, ...) to
maintain and present large collections of pictures in full 24Bit quality
on their graphic boards.  EGSPhotoAlbum supports more than 20 picture file
formats internally and additionally suports picture DataTypes and even
animation DataTypes when used under OS3.0/3.1.</p>

Internally supported formats:
<ul>
     1) IFF-ILBM (1 to 24Bit incl. HAM6/HAM8)<br>
     2) JPeg (color and greyscale)<br>
     3) PPM/PGM/PBM (P1&P4 b&w, P5 grey, P6 color)<br>
     4) QRT (also known as dump format by PD raytracers as POV-Ray)<br>
     5) Targa<br>
     6) PCX<br>
     7) BMP (uncompressed)<br>
     8) TIF (packbit-compr./uncompr.)<br>
     9) EGS7.x window icons<br>
     10) DEEP<br>
     11) YUV<br>
     12) VLAB raw<br>
     13) RGB<br>
     14) HHsYUVSq sequence format<br>
     15) IFF-PBM (DPII)<br>
     16) ACBM<br>
     17) FBM<br>
     18) Sun raster (uncompressed)<br>
     19) MacPaint (b&w compressed 1Bit format; datafork only)<br>
     20) HHsXRL formats<br>
     21) PhotoCD (Base format 768x512 or 512x768 (portrait))</p>

The additional DataType support extends this list by many formats;
DataTypes can e.g.  be found on Aminet in <a href="http://ftp.wustl.edu/~aminet/dirs/util_dtype.html">util/DType</a>.</p>

Small (thumbnail) representations of all pictures in a directory or
directory tree are shown very fast.  You can then select pictures for
viewing in multiple full size windows including fast scrolling and zooming
functions.  You can also present selected pictures in a Slideshow
presentation mode including transition effects.  Pictures can also be
directly transfered to ImageFX, ImageFX-EGS, PicoPainter, ArtEffect,
XiPaint or to the Clipboard.  Saving is possible in several 24Bit formats
including JPeg, IFF24 and more.</p>

For faster access you can also save downscaled representations of the
images.  You can view and change the file comment of pictures directly and
also delete pictures in a comfortable way.
