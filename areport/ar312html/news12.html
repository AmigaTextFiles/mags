<b>Scala to Deliver Software with New Amigas</b></p>

Frankfurt, May 30, 1995 --- "We look forward to working closely with Scala
and to deliver Scala software with all Amiga computers," said Manfred
Schmitt, President of Escom AG, at a press conference in Frankfurt on
Tuesday, 30 May.</p>

Escom AG has recently bought the assets of Commodore International and all
rights to the Commodore and Amiga technologies.  With its subsidiary, Amiga
Technologies GmbH, Escom will relaunch the Amiga computer in September this
year, first targeting the creative, video oriented, home and office
multimedia markets.</p>

"Together the Scala software and the Amiga hardware technologies offer a
powerful and cost effective solution for anyone who needs a multimedia
package for home or office use.  Scala lets us promote ready-to-use
solutions, and not just computers," says Manfred Schmitt, CEO and President
of Escom AG, the parent company of Amiga Technologies.  "Escom now turns
from a PC manufacturer and retailer into a multimedia company.   We see
this as a key to continued success."</p>

"The Amiga has shown the way and continues to do so, " comments Vice
President Jon Bohmer, Founder of Scala, the undisputed leader in multimedia
software for the Amiga platform.  "No other solution can match the price
performance of the Amiga - Scala combination.  We will support the Amiga
platform in the future and look forward to [a] close relationship with the
new Amiga Technologies company."</p>

Adds Einar Haugstad, Vice President of Scala, "Even though the Amiga went
out of production a year ago, we have continued to see a constant demand
for Amigas, from both new and experienced users."</p>

The new Amiga 4000T will come in a totally new casing, designed by Creative
Director Bjorn Rybakken of Bates Strategic Design in Oslo.   Rybakken has
long been a consultant for Scala and among other things, designed the Scala
[Exclamation] logo.</p>
