<hr></pre>
The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:</p>
<ul>
     1.  Please use English.</p>

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.</p>

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.</p>
</ul>
Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the <a href="jason.html">Editor</a>.  Please stipulate as
well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to the editor.
