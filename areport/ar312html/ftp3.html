DESCRIPTION
<ul>
An animation, framegrabbing, handyscanner and Blue Screen effect software
for the EGS graphical environment.</p>

This software enables all EGS users (e.g.  users of the typical EGS
graphic boards as Piccolo, Piccolo-SD64, EGS-Spectrum, EGS-110, ...) to
create and edit animations direct on harddisk, grab pictures and sequences
from several framegrabbers, access some handyscanners or apply the Blue
screen effect to pictures/sequences.</p>
<ul>
     Supported framegrabbers:<br>

     1) VLab (std., Y/C and parallelport versions of MacroSystems framegrabber)<br>
     2) IV24 (GVPs Impact Vision)<br>
     3) VideoCruncher (Ing.buero Helfrich)</p>
</ul>
Single or multiple frames can be grabbed from such framegrabbers and
combined with loaded frames into sequences/animations on harddisk.</p>
<ul>
     Supported handyscanners:<br>

     1) Cameron (black&white and greyscale)<br>
     2) Reisware (black&white and greyscale)<br>
     3) ScanKing (black&white and greyscale)</p>
</ul>
As scanner interfaces only Cameron and Reisware interfaces are supported.</p>

For animation creation or extension pictures or whole directories of
pictures can be imported in the following file formats:</p>
<ul>
     1) IFF-ILBM (1 to 24Bit incl. HAM6/HAM8)<br>
     2) JPeg (color and greyscale)<br>
     3) PPM/PGM/PBM (P1&P4 b&w, P5 grey, P6 color)<br>
     4) QRT (also known as dump format by PD raytracers as POV-Ray)<br>
     5) Targa<br>
     6) PCX<br>
     7) BMP (uncompressed)<br>
     8) TIF (packbit-compr./uncompr.)<br>
     9) EGS7.x window icons<br>
     10) DEEP<br>
     11) YUV<br>
     12) VLAB raw<br>
     13) RGB<br>
     14) HHsYUVSq sequence format<br>
     15) IFF-PBM (DPII)<br>
     16) ACBM<br>
     17) FBM<br>
     18) Sun raster (uncompressed)<br>
     19) MacPaint (b&w compressed 1Bit format; datafork only)<br>
     20) HHsXRL formats<br>
</ul>
The additional DataType support extends this list by many formats;
DataTypes can e.g.  be found on Aminet in util/DType.</p>

Pictures can be downscaled during import.</p>

Animations/sequences can be edited directly on harddisk: new frames can be
inserted/appended and frames can be deleted.  Frames can also be directly
imported from ImageFX or ImageFX-EGS.</p>

Frames can be directly exported to ImageFX, ImageFX-EGS, PicoPainter,
ArtEffect, XiPaint, TVPaint or to Clipboard.</p>

Saving of individual frames is also possible in several formats (e.g.
JPeg, IFF-ILBM24, ...).</p>

Animations can be played back at selectable speeds forward and backward.</p>

The Blue Screen keying effect allows the conbination of several image
sources into one picture.  This can e.g.  be used to combine a picture
from framegrabber with some blue background with another background
picture, so that the blue background is replaced.  The colour range can be
selected by several parameters.</p>
