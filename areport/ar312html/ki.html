<b>Dr. Peter Kittel, Amiga Technologies GmbH,</b><br>
on the press conference 30 May 1995 in Frankfurt</p>

Ladies and gentlemen,</p>

As Head of the Product Planning Group of the new Amiga Technologies GmbH I
would like to give you an overview about the past and the technical future
in our view.</p>

The company Commodore started in 1958 as a typewriter repair company
followed by production of electric typewriters, digital watches,
calculators and video games.  In 1977, there was launched one of the first
real desktop computers, the legendary PET 2001.  It was followed by the
CBM series, where the CBM 8032 dominated the german bureau market in 1980
and the following years, just before the breakthrough of the IBM PC.
These 8000 series had a reputation of being especially easy to use and to
program and being robust, a similar reputation like the Volkswagen beetle.</p>

Simultaneously Commodore started the Home Computer market in 1981 with the
VIC 20, soon followed by the C 64.  The C 64 became the top selling
computer ever, its success and sold number is again only comparable to the
Volkswagen beetle.  In this way Commodore had generated two different
markets which complemented each other nicely.</p>

The year 1985 brought great news.  In spring Commodore introduced the
IBM-compatible PC 10, and in July in New York during a gala show the
Amiga.</p>

- The PC 10 succeeded to carry on the advantages of the 8000 series and at
least in Europe to increase the professional reputation.</p>

- The Amiga was far ahead its time with its graphics and sound
capabilities and got an euphoric reception by the computer press.  >From
its first days software and hardware vendors exploited the special
capabilities of the Amiga to display graphics, or also animated graphics,
all accompanied by synchronized sound.  Only later the term "Multimedia"
was invented for this, the Amiga did it from day one.</p>

The special capabilities of the Amiga are due to two aspects, its special
hardware - the Custom Chips with the familiar names Paula, Agnus, and
Denise - and on the other hand its Operating System.  Looking back, one
can only admire how well suited for the future this unique operating
system was designed in the early 80's.  As a result it offers still
unmatched multitasking ability.  The Amiga reacts immediately on every
user input and wastes no time for administrative tasks.  Typically you can
run several big applications in parallel, without noticing a slow down of
any of them.  This all while the Amiga uses its resources like memory in
RAM or on disk very efficiently, so that it appears always a bit faster
through this aspect, and also doesn't stress the wallet of its owner in
regards of big RAM or harddisks.  A further feature of the Amiga is its
video compatibility by using scan frequencies typical for video, as well
as its ability to get genlocked.  Every Amiga from the low-end to high-end
provides this feature.  Many video and TV studios use the Amiga as an
integral part of their equipment.</p>

To show more concretely where the Amiga comes from, here is a picture of
the genius behind the Amiga Custom Chips, Jay Miner, who passed away last
year.</p>

The breakthrough for the Amiga came in 1987, when the first Amiga 1000 was
followed by two successors, the Amiga 500 as a dedicated home computer and
the Amiga 2000 as a professional workplace computer.  The A500 became
immediately the star of the home computer scene and dominated it for
several years, so that Commodore nearly gained a monopoly in this low-cost
market.  On the other end, the A2000 featured the Open System
Architecture, so that add-on vendors could offer everything from an
external video digitizer to a turbo board with a bigger processor.  One
other unique Amiga feature helped here, which is called "Autoconfig": You
can just plug in cards and don't need to bother for DIP switches or
jumpers, a feature that's only now slowly emerging as "Plug&Play" also on
PCs.</p>

The year 1994 brought the breakdown of Commodore, after the financial
reserves had been exhausted by some fatal management decisions.  The
liquidators tried to sell the company, but only in spring 1995, on the
auction of April 20th and 21st in New York, the german company Escom won
and took over Commodore completely.</p>

Under the wing of Escom AG, Amiga Technologies GmbH will concentrate
exclusively on the Amiga, to restart its production and develop it
further.</p>

The current Amiga generation offers a full palette from the absolute
Low-End - the Multimedia Game Console CD32 - over the full-featured home
computer A1200 up to the High-End with the A4000 Tower.  Concurrent
platforms try to state it as normal that you get a trade-off between
enhanced features and speed.  But the Amiga shows that this has not to be
the case for a really modern operating system.  The professionality of the
Amiga's video features shows up frequently in the recent past, in that
several TV series in USA are now produced completely on Amigas for their
video effect parts.  Two examples are SeaQuest DSV and Babylon V.</p>

After the takeover the new company is conscious of the necessity to
further develop the Amiga platform, as the competition has not stood
still.  The new Amiga company will therefore install an engineering
division that can make the transition into a new generation happen.</p>

In the mid term future this will lead to stronger processors and otherwise
enhanced versions of the current models.</p>

The big perspective for the future consists in a port of the Amiga
architecture to a RISC platform, to assure the awaited power for the
future.  The very first task of this new engineering division will be to
prepare this decision.  Which of the concurring RISC platforms will be the
optimum for the special case of the Amiga, is no trivial decision.  On one
side it is a goal to bring the Amiga nearer to the "Mainstream", so that
it becomes easier to port and run existing application programs.  On the
other hand, the future computer should always remain recognizable as an
"Amiga" that is not assimilated among an amorphous mass of similar
computers.  The Amiga once started with far superior graphics and sound
capabilities, and should by all means regain this advantage.</p>

To fulfill both requirements, there are currently two alternatives, the
PowerPC and the HP PA RISC.  Both have advantages and disadvantages, and
they will get thoroughly judged.</p>

Concurrent with this, the operating system will have to get adapted to
this new hardware platform, plus will adapt to new requirements like 3D
graphics, texture mapping, Object Oriented design and other current
technologies.  This task will be not as difficult as some might suspect,
as we can build on a basis which was always designed with progress in
mind.  Let's look forward to a great future of the Amiga architecture!</p>
