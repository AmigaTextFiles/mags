DESCRIPTION
<ul>
     CyBERgraphics supports:
<ul>                              Picasso II<br>
                              Spectrum<br>
                              Piccolo<br>
                              Domino<br>
                              Retina Z3 BLT<br>
                              Piccolo SD64 </p>
</ul>
The cybergraphics system was designed to define an independant graphics
standard for graphics boards.  We also wanted to continue our development
of workbench emulations.  We could include all our knowledge of about 3
years of gfx board software development (wb-emulation of visiona, domino,
picasso and now the cybervision64).</p>

Cybergraphics is based on hardware dependant monitor drivers and hardware
independant libraries.  This has some advantages: Bug fixes in the
workbench emulation or speed optimizations is of benefit for ALL gfx
boards that are supported by the cybergraphics system.  There is no third
like XpERT or Village-Tronic inbetween developers and users.  That
guarantees bug fixes and continued development of the software in the
future.  cybergraphics allows using of 15/16/24 screens independant of the
used color model.  You are able to use the cybergraphics.library functions
to modify this screens.  Using graphics.library functions is currently not
possible but this may change in one of the next releases.</p>

Cybergraphics will also be the standard workbench emulation for the soon
coming (April 95) Cybervision64 by Advanced Systems&Software.  (of course
including drivers for diverse graphics programs, screen promoters and much
more).</p>

Right now (6.4.95) there are drivers for Maxon Cinema,Real 3D, ADPro,
AmaxIV, PhotoWorx, Emplant, ImageFX and Photogenics available.  There is
also a picture viewer called CyberView which can be found on AmiNet.</p>
