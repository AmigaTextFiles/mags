DESCRIPTION
<ul>
  ShapeShifter is a multitasking shareware Macintosh-II emulator for
  the Commodore Amiga computer. It allows to run Macintosh software
  concurrently to Amiga applications without hardware add-ons or
  modifications.</p>

  Some of the emulation's features:
<ul>
<li>Color display up to 256 colors on AGA Amigas (16 colors on ECS)
     and up to 16,7 million colors on graphics cards (Picasso-II,
     EGS and CyBERgraphics cards are supported)
<li>No MMU required, even runs on A1200
<li>Macintosh hard disks can be simulated in Amiga files or Amiga
     hard disk partitions
     [unregistered version has no hard disk partition support]
<li>Can use Amiga floppy drives, serial, parallel and SCSI ports
     from the Mac
     [use of SCSI not possible in unregistered version]
<li>Mac HD disks can be read directly with an HD floppy drive,
     Mac 800K disks cannot be read, Mac 720K disks, however, can
<li>Multichannel sound output and parallel-port sound digitizers
     supported
<li>Text clipboard sharing between Mac and Amiga
<li>File handler to access Macintosh volumes from the Workbench
<li>Speed comparable to a real Mac with equivalent hardware</p>
</ul>
  Changes in V2.0:
<ul>
<li>Pre-emptive multitasking
<li>Quickstart now works reliably
<li>Bug in stack handling corrected
<li>Graphics cards in 24 bit address space work with ROM 34
<li>CyBERgraphics 15 and 24 bit modes now work, selecting a
     CyBERgraphics mode will automatically set the color depth
<li>Needs no special ROM sub versions any more
<li>Setting for task priority removed
<li>Macintosh reset routine revamped
<li>Italian catalog files
<li>When the selected amount of Mac memory is not available, you
     can choose to use the largest free block
<li>Numerous internal corrections and improvements
<li>SCSI IDs individually switchable, an error when accessing
     ID 0 will no longer cause the other IDs to be skipped
<li>The graphics refresh is now done by a subtask, enabling the
     Amiga mouse pointer will prevent any refreshes
<li>ROM write-protection is now choosable
<li>The FileDisk driver will no longer open files with empty
     names</p>
</ul>
