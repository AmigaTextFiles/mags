Finally, the wait is over, and there's light at the end of the tunnel, the
Amiga has a new owner, and a new life.  In the past days I've read a
zillion letters about this, most of them with concern about the future,
many more with suggestions and requests for ESCOM, and more in between.
But a question keeps poping in my mind: What can we, the regular Amiga
users and fans, do to keep our beloved companion alive?  And as I ponder
that question, I sense an idea lurking on my head:<pre>
<h4>                                                                                 This is a second chance</pre></h4>
Yes my friends, this is a second chance, and no other PC had one in the
past.  It's time for us to appreciate our good luck, to behave ourselves
and keep our friend alive, to have it in all her glory, show the world her
power and have many more fun along the way.</p>

How?  That's the easy part, just do the right thing.  Let's cut that
piracy crap, show the makers of software that we too can handle their
programs.  Some of you are saying "yeah, right" and I can understand you,
software is pricey most of the time, even on our cheap plataform, but if
money is not enough, there's the PD scene, you can live with it and
believe me, you can live well.  It's cool to say "Lemmings Tribes was
available in the US before official distribution", but what did you
obtained from that apart from a few hours of fun?  Remember Sierra, Lucas,
SAS, and some other makers.  It's not only their programs and proffits,
those are guys who can attract more developers, and put the money on big
development projects and better programs.</p>

Support our programmers, and the people who dedicate some hours and days
of their lives to us, like magazine editor's ( :-) ), PD organizers, and
the like.  After all, without them the "dark ages" may were really dark. 
Remember that each and every dollar/pund/peso/whatever you invest goes
directly to your computer, and I mean the one you're using to read this
right there on your desk.</p>

I hope you get the main idea of this letter as english is not my main
language, but remembering a foreign president words: Ask not what the Amiga
can do for you, but what you can do for the Amiga.  I think it (and we)
deserve it, besides, nothing but good times will follow for all of us if we
do that.</p>
