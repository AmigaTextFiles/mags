                 PRELIMINARY INTRODUCTION TO THE DELFINA DSP</p>

1. WHAT IS DELFINA DSP?</p>

Delfina DSP is a multifeatured audio board containing a fully programmable
powerful 20 MIPS Digital Signal Processor.  The board is capable of 16bit
stereo digitizing and multichannel playback at 50kHz.  Price will be under
$700, with an introductionary price for the Internetters at $400.</p>

More sofware will be released later. </p>

2. HOW AND WHY TO CONTACT US?<br>

The board is at prototype stage, so changes can still be made according to
good propositions and requirements.  The libraries and applications for
the card will be continuously developed even after the product has been
shipped, so we will be always open for fresh ideas.  We'd be glad to join
the discussion about wishes for features on the Internet News.</p>
