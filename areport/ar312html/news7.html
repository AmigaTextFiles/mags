Makin Musik is a CD Rom for the Amiga Musician, be they professional or

and sequencers.  ) allows the Amiga musician to create fantastic music
with ease.</p>

The Amiga user will find the Sound Samples on Makin Musik a valuable
collection to their music making skills.  With the permission of AKAI we
have converted sounds from there professional sound library as well as the
AKAI S3000 sampler we use ourselves into a format usable on the AMIGA.
The sample quality is incredible Samples are in 8 & 16 bit.  Now that
programs like Octamed 6 can take advantage of 16bit samples this CD Makin
Musik is invaluable.  Amongst the 2500 sound samples found on Makin Musik
you will find a large range of musical instruments, special effects, and
even full loops and beats.</p>
