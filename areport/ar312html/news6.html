Some of you (many, I hope) might have seen the first issue of Amiga Report
Tech Journal some time back.  Possibly you've wondered what happened to
that.  ARTech's former editor, Greg Block, moved his development to
NeXTSTEP, and I took the magazine over from him.  However, there is a
problem, and that being a lack of articles.  ARTech needs you.  I want to
make ARTech a magazine that will always have some useful technique notes
and interesting features for anyone interested in Amiga.  This doesn't
just mean programming, as you might have thought from the first issue.
Amiga is that, but Amiga is also multimedia, rendering, and whatever you
do with your machine.</p>

If you're an expert in some computing field, program Amiga, create cool
art with Amiga, or just do something interesting with it, and would like
to tell others about it, contact me.  ARTech will welcome anything from
LightWave animation technique notes to ARexx programming hints to a
programming course.  It is what many, including me, have waited for a long
time.  Help make it great.</p>
