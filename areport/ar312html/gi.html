<b>Don Gilbreath</b><br>
Chief Technical Officer, VisCorp.</p>

Hello my name is Don Gilbreath.  I have 12 years association with
Commodore.  I have worked in various capacities from engineering to
technical sales and marketing.  As a Director of Product and Market
Development, I designed and managed among other products the team that
brought the CDTV to market.</p>

I am happy to be here today for the re-birth of Amiga.  After spending
some quality time with ESCOM management, I am convinced they possess the
marketing finesse and strength to make Amiga successful into the 21st
century.</p>

Currently, I am Chief Technical Officer for VisCorp, an interactive
set-top box developer and application designer based in the United States.
Our executive offices are in Chicago, and we have engineering teams based
in West Chester, Pennsylvania and the Silcon Valley.  VisCorp is the first
company to be granted a license to use the Amiga technology in interactive
set-tops.</p>

Before I explain why we believe Amiga is the right platform of choice for
set-tops, let me explain the current landscape of North America set-top
offerings.</p>

We are aware of some 40 set-top projects.  Seventeen design wins alone are
for Philips chip sets and an OS9 derivative (DAVID), the closest
competition for an Amiga offering.</p>

Som eof the other set-top projects (or camps) range from pure video
game-based platforms such as Nintendo, Sony, and Sega to a multi-
function, cost prohibitive (in terms of memory) Microsoft-based platform
as well as similar offerings from Apple, SUN, and Silicon Graphics.  Amiga
will find a home between these two ranges in terms of cost/features and
the development community.</p>

There is another camp which tend to be as much of a target as a potential
partner and include Scientific Atlanta and General Instrument.  They are
currently not strong in computer technology as cable modems, video
delivery, and authorization schemes.  There is synergy and relationships
with development between Amiga and these two companies in particular.</p>

What is this set-top business all about?</p>
<ul>
<li> Selling product - initial hardware sale/lease or licensing - the
  enabling technology</p>

<li> Potential of ongoing revenues - hard goods - soft goods - providing
  movies, telephone service, and grocery shopping</p>

<li> Controlling transactions - classic gate keeper model</p>
</ul>
We need a consortium because the following is at stake:</p>
<ul>
<li> Self-intereest in semiconductors - hardware design win.</p>

<li> Operating system dominance - where applications reside.</p>

<li> Delivery system dominance - cable, teleco, radio, satellite, etc.</p>

<li> Development community - tools and understanding of next generation
  software.</p>

<li> Secure tranactions - financial and developer community backed (musicains
  to software writers).  to the cusomer it must be friendly and secure</p>
</ul>
Set-top world common goal:</p>
<ul>
<li> Low cost -</p>

<li> Content rich - variety</p>

<li> Deploy a platform to meet the above parameters: Allow an upgrade path
  similar to a computer i.e.  cable modem du jour, MPEG audio/video, etc.,
  ISDN, wireless cable modems, etc.</p>
</ul>
The confusion:</p>

1% homes wired for 2-way high-speed data....</p>

The confusion stems from how this magic, high-speed data arrives to the
home: Is it telephone, satellite, radio, cable, or some hybrid?  In our
model it does not matter.  We have OEM activities today in all of these
areas.</p>

Our present VisCorp model, which is in homes today under the guise of a
market test, is a hybrid model utilizing both analog telephone and
broadcast data video.  When the cable modem and digital video technologies
settle, the federal laws may change as well.  Our strategy is to deploy a
product that is useful today but provides a migration path to this over
hybrid, high speed, low cost world we don't live in.</p>

The current product:</p>

Over the past few years, we at VisCorp have been developing an interactive
set-top platform.  The VisCorp product starts by converging the television
set with the telephone.  It convers the TV set into an executive
speakerphone with one-touch on-screen dialling and caller ID.  It has
built in filters and font generators to convert on-line data services to
text that is readable at standard TV viewing distances.  It has a built-in
credit card reader and can support electronic directories, classified
advertising, and catalogue shopping applications.  Other features include
on-screen TV listings with one button recording facility, sending faxes
and e-mail, and accessing InterNet and multi-participant games (thousands
playing simultaneously) that in some cases are tied to live TV events with
national scoring in place prizes and cash where legal.</p>

The VisCorp product is currently being tested on a cable system in a
Detroit suburb where it is also suppoting one-touch ordering of pay-
per-view and access to local bulletin board service including restaurant
reviews and local civic information.</p>

So this sounds like a great product.  So why the Amiga?  Is there
something wrong?  Absolutely nothing.  It is our entry model, suitable
today, and can be sold at retail 1995 for under 300 USD or the price of a
feature rich telephone, which it is.  We have a custom chip program
nearing completion that further cost reduces this product and enables
further dimensions in interactive TV in terms of the toy industry and
education.</p>

The Amiga-based version will be our second model.  We plan to embark on a
crash program to further develop a chipset with our combined licenses and
patented technologies with Amiga functionality.  The combined
Amiga/VisCorp interactive TV platform will support all currently
envisioned interactive applications with the exception of full motion
video on demand and practical speed CD Audio delivery.  We do not think
this is a handicap as a base case offering.  Speciality markets or cable
customers can be addressed with additional modules.</p>

We encourage an Amiga set-top consortium to be formed immediately.  We
believe a minimum base case design including encryption technology, if
possible would be supported by consortium members.  Since this platform is
destined for world markets, a software rating mechanism would include
parental lockout of adult features and include reviews, top sellers, etc.
This standard must be in place in a similar fashion to that of the movie
and music industry, thereby freeing the software development community to
treat it as a guaranteed publishing platform with secure distribution of
content and payment.  This device which many of us will build in various</p>
