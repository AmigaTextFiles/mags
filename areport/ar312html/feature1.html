Let's face it, text is important.  In order to catch attention, you
need to have cool, interesting, and innovative text to catch the eye of
the observer.  I'm going to go step by step to show how I did the effect
for the improv Amiga Report logo I did.</p>

<h3><ul><b>STEP {1}</b> - Creating the initial text.</ul></h3>

For the first step, I needed a program that could load a large number of
fonts, and hopefully do other nice and interesting effects.  As I own
ArtExpression, I had to settle for something that could load PostScript
fonts.  Since Amiga Report is a news zine, I decided to pick an
appropriate styletype.  Having wild, exciting, bizarre, or groovy text was
out for this particluar purpose, as I can only assume that something
called Amiga Report has at least a moderately serious edge to it.</p>

I chose Times-Roman because this is a typeface that is commonly associated
with newspapers.  I also sketched in a cute little checkmark to go with
the text effect...  maybe I'll use it, maybe I wont.</p>

I save the work as a PostScript file.  I could have saved the work as a
standard IFF file, however that causes the file to be saved as a specified
resolution.  On the other hand, saving as an IFF means that you can load
the file into nearly any program.<hr>
<h3><ul><b>Step {2}</b> - Transfering the File</ul></h3>

This stage involved importing the text into a more capable program,
(essentially, anything that does not say ArtExpression on the box), and
for this I used ImageFX 2.1.  Since IFX2.1 has a PostScript import module,
(using the hgpost datatype), and I decided to have the resolution as a
425x550, and cropped it to 425x253.  The resolution is a little bit low,
but for what I'm doing, it will work just fine.<hr>
<h3><ul><b>Step {3}</b> - The Real Job</ul></h3>

<h4><ul><ul><b>{A}</b> - The Background</ul></ul></h4>

This is where a dab of artistic flair comes in handy.  Fortunately a dab
is all that is required, for that is all I posses!  Now, I conceptualize
what this will look like.  Will it be modern?  Classic?  New Age?  I think
that I will start with it having a modern background, and then afterwards,
work on the text.  I swap buffers, and then select "Create New Buffer" and
size it to swap (If you remember, since we swapped the buffers, the one we
were working on now becomes the "swap").  Going to the palette, I create a
range of greys, (for that modern look).  After trying out a couple of
experimental fills, I decide to go with a nice wheel filled from the
middle of the screen.</p>

<h3><ul><ul><b>{B}</b> - The Checkmark</ul></ul></h3>

First, I swapped buffers again to bring me back to the first screen, and I
decided to do something about that checkmark.  This was simple.  I loaded
a rainbow texture that I had laying around, (I think I grabbed it off of
someone's home page), so I loaded it as a brush, and then did a brush fill
on the checkmark.  I then cut out the brush, and then removed the spot
where the checkmark, as I did not want it to be there permanently.</p>

<h3><ul><ul><b>{C}</b> - The Alpha Channel</ul></ul></h3>

Black text on a white background faced me.  The words "Amiga" and "Report"
sat atop one another, the "G" in Amiga fitting in the depression in
"Report".  Nice.  Now I do any special effects to the shape of the text. 
Since I don't want anything particularly fancy for this, I simply add a
small amount of anti-aliasing.  If you want to get crazy, try the dream
effect first.  Groovy, man.  I then copied the screen to the Alpha
channel.  This will become my texture later in the process.</p>

<h3><ul><ul><b>{D}</b> - Of Alphas, Swaps, and Textures</ul></ul></h3>

I decide that I want a shadow effect, so I roll my current buffer by about
5 pixels.  Now I swap buffers again to bring me back to the wheel fill.
Setting the fill options to normal/rub through/use alpha as friskit, I
used a filled box to select the whole screen.  This causes the box to rub
through the entire screen except what was protected by the alpha channel.
The Text is filled by what is left of the wheel-filled screen, and the
text now has a shadow beneeth it.</p>

<h3><ul><ul><b>{E}</b> - The Checkmark Reviseted</ul></ul></h3>

I throw the checkmark back in.  Easy.  Just make sure all of the drawing
modes are reset to their defaults.</p>

Excuse me?  How did I stick it behind the text?  Well, I'm glad you asked,
because otherwise I wouldn't have answered.  I created a range of colors
from black to almost pure white.  Emphasis on almost.  I then chose to
exclude that range from receiving colour wiht my draw options.  Easy as
cake.<hr>
<h3><ul><b>Step {4}</b> - Touch Up Work</ul></h3>

Well, everything turned out pretty good, but I wanted to fine tune things
a little bit.  First of all, sticking in the checkmark messed up some of
my lettering.  I repaired that using the pantograph draw option.  I toned
the white down to 235/235/235rgb I scaled it down to 380x200.  I ran
Unsharpen Mask to bring out the edges a little better.<hr>
<h3><ul><b>Step {5}</b> - Saving Your Work</ul></h3>

This is a very important step.  The format that you save your work in
usually depends on a variety of things.  How much space does your work
need to fit in?  I don't have a lot of space on my hard drive, therefore,
I usually use JPEG.  If you are using this for a WWW page, you probably
want to save it in GIF.  If I had the space for it, I would save my work
as IFF24.<hr>
<h3><ul><b>Step {6}</b> - The End</ul></h3>

Now you criticize your work and lament about how bad it turned out.  At
least, that's what I do.  :)<hr>
