(first of all, sorry about my english)</p>

I am a recent computer engineering graduate.</p>

I am working at my campus's electronic & computer labs, and my campus's
video labs.</p>

I am also a fanatic amiga user who lives in jakarta indonesia.</p>

I am amazed by amiga video and multitasking capability.</p>

I think amiga OS is very powerful and efficient.</p>

In my city 80 percent of amigas are used for video work.  there are 6 - 8
video production alone in my city although here in jakarta, we don't have
any dealers.  Because we don't have any dealers, we got to order it
directly from UK, USA or Singapore, and the price will go up to 1.5 - 3
times than the normal prices.</p>

I always encourage people that use computer for video work
 to use the amiga.</p>

I even encourage my lab at my campus to use the amiga.  (curently my
campus's video labs using amiga 500 & amiga 4000/040 for your information
my campuss had to pay US$4000 for amiga 4000 alone, without monitor)</p>

Here in Jakarta, amiga are nameless computer.  Recently, at computer expo
in Jakarta, local apple dealer show to the big screen projector, 'Change
Myself' music video from Todd Rundgren (I know it was created using AMIGA)
people visit to their stand will think it produced using Apple Computer,</p>

So you see, I work very hard to promote amiga,</p>

To support amiga here in jakarta, with several of other fanatic amiga
user, we even create our own memory boards, sampler boards ( at the moment
only for A500), repairing the amiga (without support from anywhere), help
to install the 3,5" HD to AMiga 1200, created our own external disk drive
using cheap IBM drive and others activity.</p>

The 7 - 14 video production (in 3 city in Indonesia) that use amigas,
depend on us.</p>

We even think in the near future we want to become an amiga dealer.  (for
video work amigas are still popular, but because it is hard to find
especially in indonesia, then people buy IBM or Apple instead)</p>

So I hope Escom will make amiga's future brighter than before.
