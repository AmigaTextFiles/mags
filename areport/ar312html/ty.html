General Manager, Amiga Technologies GmbH</p>

Ladies and gentlemen,</p>

As the General manager of Amiga Technologies GmbH, I would like to welcome
you to the first press conference of our new company and also tell you how
much we appreciate your presence here.</p>

At a spectacular auction, five weeks ago in New York, ESCOM AG acquired
the rights to the intellectual property of the former Commodore company
for 10 Mio $, including all trademarks, logos, products and licences.</p>

Since the day we succeeded in buying the Amiga technology, many people
have asked us how the future will look for their computer of choice.  We
got floods of anxious faxes and letters to which we couldn't give an
answer at once because things were too early to comment.  We will use the
opportunity we have now to talk to all of you and present the new Escom
daughtercompany, Amiga Technologies.  Some leading developpers of hardware
and software for the Amiga as well as some of our new licensing partners
will present themselves and their projects to us.</p>

To clear up things from the beginning, - and that's the point you are all
interested in - I want to make the comittment that we are determined to
resume production and also want to continue hardware and software
development of what we believe is a superior technology.  That's why we
created Amiga Technologies and we are now hiring the best and most capable
people to accomplish this.</p>

For a sucessfull Multimedia company like ESCOM, the Commodore Patents and
licences concerning Amiga are considered the key to multimedia technology.
Mister Schmitt will say more about this later.</p>

But let's concentrate on our immediate plans.  As the director of Amiga
Technologies, my first priority now is to resume production of Commodore
and Amiga computers and bring them on the market as soon as possible.  For
us, this means September 1995.</p>

I would also like to refer to Commodore computers, Pentium PCs, which will
be available in August this year.  These will be fully loaded P75 and P100
multimedia PCs.  They will be assembled in our own ESCOM facilities.  We
plan to sell between 50 000 and 60 000 units before the end of this year.
Let me point out that the Commodore and Amiga operations will be separate,
Amiga Technologies will only take care of Amiga, whereas ESCOM will
provide Commodore PCs.</p>

One month later, we will start producing the high-end multimedia Amiga
4000 T.  To succeed in keeping that tight schedule, we negotiated with
well known producers in Europe and Asia.  For the selection of the
manufacturing partner, we will be emphasizing the quality requirements.</p>

Until the end of the year, we plan to produce enough machines to meet the
demand.  These machines are already outsold in preorders.  In October, the
production of the low-end A1200 will begin.  We expect to ship enough
untis as well as CD 32 game consoles to meet the Christmas season demand.
Please give us more time to publish quantities.</p>

The takeover of the inventory, which is mainly composed of spare parts, in
the UK and Germany is completed.  The rumoured stocks of new Amigas ready
to be sold do not exist.  For inventory in the Phillipines, we are
currently negotiating with the local trustees.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, the new Amiga Technology will now become the
operating center of an international Company held 100% by ESCOM AG.  Our
headquarters in Bensheim will employ around 50 people for following tasks
: development, support to developers, resellers, and users, production
management, Marketing, PR and administration.  We also took over the
former Commodore development center in Norristown, with its research and
development facilities.  Eduard Goff, former Vice President and General
counsel at Commodore now leads that center.  He will talk to you later.
Our developers are now working on the next generation RISC based Amigas as
well as on improving current models.  Here, we are working in a tight
partnership with SCALA and MOTOROLA.</p>

Amiga Technologies GmbH expects a turnover of 100 Mio DM in 1995, mainly
from the Christmas business with Amiga 1200, 4000 and CD32.  Our monthly
expenses are evaluated at around 600 000 DM.  The break even point should
be reached this year.  We are confident that we will have rentabilized our
10 Mio $ investment by spring 1996 with Amiga sales and licences.</p>

I will be here again for further questions later this afternoon, but now
let me introduce M Manfred Schmitt, Chairman of the executive board at
ESCOM.</p>
