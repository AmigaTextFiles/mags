CONTENTS
<ul>
Aminet CD 6 contains over 1 gigabyte of freely distributable software. 
The newest file included is dated Apr 28th.  The space is used as follows
(uncompressed sizes):
<pre>
      520M of software newer than Aminet CD 5
      500M of demos
       20M of top downloads

    These consist of:
      1800 demos
      1300 tools
       350 mods
       140 pics
       120 games
</pre>
The demos were collected from various sources besides <a href="http://ftp.wustl.edu/~aminet/>Aminet</a>, and almost
none of them have appeared on previous Aminet CDs.</p>

The disks also contains all <i>Amiga Report</i> magazines issued so far.</p>
</ul>

ACCESS SOFTWARE
<ul>
Amigaguide based user interface, allows easy unpacking and viewing using a
single mouse click.</p>

Extensive search facilities.  Finds words in descriptions or readmes, and
outputs matches as an index that allows direct viewing.</p>

New access features for the following categories of files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demos: All demos have been tested.  Separate lists of best, good and
compatible demos.  All demos startable from those indices.  Another demo
index is the Amiga Demo List with extensive info about almost all demos on
the CD.  It is sorted by demo group.  Finally there is a program called
BootTool that allows you to view demos right after a reboot without much
fuss, so you can quickly look at the demos that force you to reboot.</p>

<li>Mods: All of the modules are listed in indices sorted by music style and
rating.  There's also an index sorted by module author and the possibility
to randomly play music of a certain style.</p>

<li>Docs: All Amiga Report electronic magazines that have appeared so far
are on this CD, including a utility that allows you to search for any text
in any AR article very quickly.</p>

<li>Personal: Aminet CD 6 allows you to easily create an index of your
favourite files on the CD.</p>

<li>German: All the files (except demos) on Aminet CD 6 have a German
description.  Also included is an index of the SaarAG disks up to 840.</p>
</ul>
Other improvements are the possibility to use file requesters to set
extraction and tool paths, and 'Clones' which are little programs that,
when started, unpack and run/view a file from the Aminet CD.
