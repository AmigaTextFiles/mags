DESCRIPTION
<ul>
A fast action game of skill...</p>

Principle of this game is to guide a rolling ball as fast as possible
along a long and tricky track in space, to avoid the holes and gaps or
jump over them, and to get as many points as possible in the end (what
else?).  Many extra fields with special effects can make this task easier
or much more difficult.</p>

Included are nine levels, starting "very easy" and ending "utterly
difficult".</p>

With the integrated level editor you can change levels or create your own
levels.  This is also possible with the freely distributable version, but
you can't save levels to disk from this version.  For proper use, you
should decide to register and pay the shareware fee.  With the registered
full version you can design as many sets of each nine levels as you like
and save them to disk.  For each level set separate highscores (incl.
highscore game play for automatic replay mode) are saved.</p>

The ball can be controlled by joystick or keyboard.</p>
