Harv Laser, sysop of the 2.5 gigabyte Amiga Zone on the Portal online
service, has announced that the services provided by Portal and the Amiga
Zone will soon be available to customers through a World Wide Web
interface.</p>

Previews of this service are now available on <a href="http://www.portal.com/~harv/">http://www.portal.com/~harv/</a></p>

This move would make the Amiga Zone the first Amiga online service with a
Web interface-provided nobody beats them to getting it up and running.
