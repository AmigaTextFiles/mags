<b>Conclusion</b><br>
Manfred Schmidt - Escom AG</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, So I hope that you got a more precise view of
what the future of ESCOM and Amiga will be. I think that we all have
the same motivations : We want the Amiga to succeed again as it did in
the past, we want it to be recognised as an important player in the
personal computer industry and we want it to be an interesting
alternative to other systems.</p>

The market like the concept and the elegance of the Amiga and for us,
Amiga is now our platform of choice, our business.</p>

A new company has now seen the light of day.  This is an Amiga company,
our people know what they have to do because they all have a deep
knowledge and passion for the system they are working for.  They also
won't repeat the errors that have been made in the past.</p>

Since the liquidation of Commodore, this has been the first official Amiga
press conference.  To allow a close cooperation with the Amiga Press,
Amiga Technologies has its own Press and PR department, led by your new
person of contact who I'd like to introduce to you : Mr Gilles Bourdin.</p>

This conference is now over.  I would like to thank you again for showing
your interest, especially for those who had a long way to come.  There is
a showroom next door to this one where you can have a look at some of the
many application fields the Amiga covers.  In the meantime, before dinner,
I and my colleagues are at your disposition if you have any further
questions.</p>

Thank you.</p>
