DESCRIPTION
<ul>
The DFA datatype can be used to view DFA created database files using
tools like Multiview.  Additionally, it is possible to print customized
address lists using this datatype and Multiview (for example)</p>

The display format can be customized, i.e.  you can tell the datatype
which fields of the address database you want to get displayed.</p>

This datatype can read all DFA address database formats from version 1.0
to version 2.25 of DFA!</p>

DFA is the definite address database tool.  It supplies a very nice GUI, a
powerful Arexx port, a flexible client server mechanism and much more.  It
is simply the ideal mean to manage several or many addresses for the
beginner as well as for the professional Amiga user.</p>
