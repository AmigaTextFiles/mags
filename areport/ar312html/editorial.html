<hr></pre>I've been learning a lot of things in the last few weeks.</p>

One is that it was pretty nice not rushing to make an exact 2-week deadline
for this issue...it was some much-needed rest.  Still, I feel like I've
been just as busy...</p>

So busy, in fact, that I wasn't able to actually finish any reviews for
this issue.  Strike that up as a learning experience, too.  I suppose that
just means I'll have to have twice as many next issue.</p>

I've been learning lately that perhaps I should do like everyone else does
and CHARGE MONEY for all these "open letters" I keep getting.  You have to
admit, there does seem to be a market for them. :)</p>

I've learned that maybe there is some name value in Amiga Report after all.
I've been invited to speak at <a href="news4.html">AmiJAM'95</a> in Calgary, in the company of such
giants as Dale Larson, Dave Haynie, and Fred Fish.  So, if you're bored in
mid July, come see us.  We'll be there.</p>

I've also learned, literally just an hour before I wrote this, from an
unconfirmed report credited to Dan Stets of the Philadelphia Inquirer that
Amiga Technologies will be manufacturing 4000Ts in the US and 1200s in
Scotland.</p>

I've learned that there's some irony in hype.  I just got a press pack from
Team17, with their new slogan "100% Gameplay, 0% Bullshit."  The
information is in a nice red folder with glossy type-much snazzier than
anything I've ever received before from Team17.  The material talks about
an upcoming soccer management game.  In the two glossy release sheets,
though, only the Mac and Windows are discussed.  In the photocopied press
release, only the Mac and Windows are discussed.  The only place they admit
to having created an Amiga version is on the second page of their faq on
the product, another included insert.</p>

I don't know what the fellows at Team17 call this, but I call it bullshit.
I honestly can't tell if they really did an Amiga version or not, and their
press people haven't been nice enough to return my inquiry.</p>

Sigh.  Next issue, more reviews, I promise.  In the meantime, enjoy the new
<a href="AmigaReportTutorial.JPG">logo</a> courtesy of Corinna Cohn, the Escom press conference transcripts, and
all that news the assistant editor was nice enough to package for you...</p>
