DESCRIPTION
<ul>
     DFA is the definite address database utility for you and the 
     Amiga computer.</p>

     DFA manages your email addresses, allows direct dialing of
     the stored phone numbers, grouping of addresses, different 
     types of printing addresses, online help, application 
     icon/window and much more!</p>

     DFA has an Arexx port, font sensitive windows and can be fully
     directed by keyboard. Native languages are supported as soon
     as Workbench 2.1 (and above) is installed.</p>

     Nearly every aspect of DFA is customizable, so you may
     configure "your own" DFA.</p>

     This is version 2.25, a minor update to version 2.2.</p>

     DFA is an SASG product! Shareware, binary only.
</ul>
NEW FEATURES (since v2.2)
<ul>
     QuickSearch function for the DFAEditor main window.</p>

     Improved mapping function for the <a href="http://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/docs/rview/MagicWB2.txt">MagicWB</a> images.</p>

     Several bug fixes.
</ul>
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
<ul>
     DFA needs at least Kickstart/Workbench 2.04 to run.</p>

     It takes advantage of the new features included in version 2.1
     (Locale  support)  and  uses even some features coming with OS
     3.0 if available.</p>

     DFA is made to run on all systems, starting with the A500+
     and ending up with the A4000(T).</p>

     More than 512KB of RAM and a harddisk are recommended.

DISTRIBUTABILITY
<ul>
     DFA is NOT PD.  It is shareware.  The author keeps the
     copyright over the whole package.</p>

     The public version of DFA (without the keyfile!) is freely
     (re)distributable, but noone is allowed to sell the program
     for more money than to cover just the costs of copying.</p>

     In any case nobody may charge more than Fred Fish claims
     for one of his "Library Disks"!
