DESCRIPTION
<ul>
    AmyBoard is a graphical chessboard, that can serve as a user
    interface for GNU Chess, for the ICS (Internet Chess Server) and
    for itself as a PGN (Portable Game Notation) file editor. The
    original xboard can also be used for electronic mail
    correspondence chess, but this possibility is not yet integrated
    into AmyBoard, as this requires cmail, which is a Perl script.</p>

    As an interface to GNU Chess, AmyBoard lets you play a game
    against the machine, set up arbitrary positions, force variations,
    or watch a game between two machines.</p>

    As an interface to the Internet Chess Server (ICS), AmyBoard
    lets you play against other ICS users, observe games they are
    playing, or review games that have recently finished.</p>

    You can also use AmyBoard as a chessboard to play through games.
    It will read and write game files and allow you to play through
    variations manually. You can use it to browse games off the net
    or review GNU Chess, ICS, and correspondence games you have saved.
    These features are available at all times; even if you do not have
    access to GNU Chess or the ICS.
