DESCRIPTION
<ul>
This is the official all-in-one information program about the SASG, its
goals, services, up-to-date information about all available shareware
products (i.e.  new SASG releases, updates etc.) and it also includes the
favorite automated registration generator which makes the whole
registration process a piece of cake.</p>

So, if you are interested in shareware products like MUI, DFA, MagicCX or
MagicWB, if you would like to find out your nearest located registration
site to be sure to get the benefits of a national treatment (shorter
waits, own currency supported, local support etc.), and if you never
registered shareware because of all the fuss and complication involved:
Get this program!</p>

By the ease of a few mouse clicks the program will generate your personal
registration form with all necessary data (like the receiver's address
etc.).  This is the easiest way to support the author of your favorite
product and get the most out of your money through the quality assurance
and services of the SASG.</p>

The SASG is a group of well-known shareware authors whose goal is to offer
high quality shareware products at a reasonable (standardized, i.e.  US$
20.00) price on a high value-for-money basis.</p>

The SASG has achieved a well-established infrastructure for the
registration process by installing several official registration sites all
over the world (accepting a variety of currencies) and ensuring that you
receive your registered product as fast as possible.</p>

At the same time the SASG is a non-profit organization which was founded
by shareware authors themselves to ensure that 100% of your money will
reach the specific author.  This has made the low and standardized price
of US$ 20.00 possible since no other persons than the author himself
profits from your support.</p>

You may find all further information in the program itself.
