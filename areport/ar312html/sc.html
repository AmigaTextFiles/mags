Ladies and gentlemen,</p>

Since we won the auction for the intellectual property of Commodore and
Amiga, the ESCOM AG is flooded with congratulation messages.  Amiga clubs
and Amiga users write to ask us to revive and continue to develop and
improve the Amiga.  Many of them actually sent us their wishes for future
hardware architectures and operating systems improvements.</p>

However, it is still unclear for many users how a PC manufacturer and
retailer will use the Amiga technology.</p>

Here is our answer: </p>

ESCOM now turns from a PC manufacturer and retailer into a multimedia
company.  The big multimedia applications will come very soon as Pay-TV,
Video on demand, homebanking, home-shopping and online services.  In this
growing market, we want to become a leading provider of hardware, software
and solutions.  Our goal is to give the user a cost-efficient way to
access all these new services the multimedia world will allow.  The Amiga
technology brings us all we need here in an elegant way.  We see in the
Amiga the key to Multimedia technologies for the future.</p>

As an intelligent terminal, you all know the PC.  Many people use the PC
in conjunction with a modem to access online services and the worldwide
Internet.  Escom is providing that market with a wide palette of
advantageoulsy priced Multimedia PCs in a range between 2000 and 3000 DM.</p>

But there are other user profiles, who want to use the multimedia
technology without having to spend several thousands of DM.  For these
users, the Amiga represents a very interesting alternative.  It stands out
with an amazing price/quality ratio.  Also remarkable is the operating
system with a still unmatched multitasking ability.  That means that
several applications can run simultaneously, depending on available memory
without slowing down the whole system.  This is achieved by the smart
resource sharing of the system and the low consumption of RAM and
processing power by the applications.</p>

The Amiga operating system needs 8 times less memory than Windows, and it
multitasks better than Windows.  Through this smart use of system
resources, the Amiga is still a very efficient and unexpensive computer.</p>

Video is another strength of the Amiga.  In this aspect, the Amiga is
superior to the PC.  The video output of the Amiga is already PAL and NTSC
compatible, so it can just be plugged into a TV or any video monitor.  A
PC needs a converter to do this.  The Amiga represents a possibility to
give people access to interactive television, online services and pay TV
with set top boxes at decent prices like 400 DM.  The market is huge
because there are much more televisions than computers in the homes.</p>

The set top box is a concrete application involving Amiga technology that
we want to improve.  For the American market, which is much more advanced
than in Europe in this regard, we already have license agreements with our
partner VisCorp - our first licence by the way.  We are willing to be very
flexible and open-minded regarding licensing of our technology.  Amiga
developers and manufacturers shall have the chance to talk with us to
define partnerships or license agreements.  Together, we will develop a
wide range of Amiga hardware and software.  Our goal is a productive, open
amiga technology.  The example of Viscorp demonstrates it at best : we
license Amiga technology to people who want to integrate it in their own
products.  The press already talked about another partner, the Tianjin
Family-Used Multimedia Co.  Ltd.  They will build the lower range of Amiga
computers and revive the legendary Commodore 64 for the chinese market.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, we have mainly talked about the Amiga.  In New York,
we also took over another well known brand : Commodore.  All of you surely
remember the good old Commodore 64 and its tremendous success in the early
eighties.  It is still a famous episode in the home computer history that
could be compared to the Volkswagen Beetle.  A recent study made by the
german economic magazine DM reveals that the name Commodore still has very
high recognition.  93 percent of all PC users know the trademark
Commodore.  such a reputation is only surpassed by IBM.</p>

We will now separate Commodore and Amiga operations.  Amiga will be the
multimedia range with Motorola processors and Commodore for Intel based
Personal Computers.  We want to use all available and appropriate
distribution channels both for Commodore and Amiga: specialized retail
stores, warehouses, and mail order services.  The ESCOM subsidiaries are
only one of many possibilities.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, we are convinced that ESCOM, Commodore and Amiga
will become a sucess story.  Look at the structure and competencies we
have built up in a short time.</p>

Thank you.</p>
