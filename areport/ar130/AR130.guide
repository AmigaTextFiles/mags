/// From the Editor's Desk                        "Saying it like it is!"
    ----------------------


I was watching Beyond 2000 on The Discovery Channel last Tuesday afternoon,
and saw something rather interesting.  They were running a story on Virtual
Reality.  A company called "W" Enterprises was creating cyberspace simulations
for doctors, architects, and even doing some games.  The narrator said that
they were using "Commodore's Amiga computer" with additional chips for
graphics.  There were pictures of somebody inserting IC's on a motherboard,
but I'd say they looked a lot more like RAM chips than anything else.
Besides, it'd be kinda hard, I bet, to add more custom graphics chips to
the machine unless they're talking about a custom board (like a Retina or
EGS Spectrum).  It's nice to know the Amiga is still a forerunner in the
design of new technology.  The PC hasn't taken over completely!

I'm still being haunted by the remark two issues ago about there being a
"bug" in DLG.  Let me rephrase that.  Instead, I think the word, "inconsist-
ency" would be more appropriate.  So please forget I said anything about a
bug. ;)

Now, a special note... we've lost an Amiga Report Distribution Site.  The
Dead Fish BBS has been taken down.  Below is the letter I received in E-Mail
the other day:


    #1          19-OCT-1993 14:03:18.67                                  NEWMAIL


    From:   IN%"awald@dfbbs.linet.org"
    To:     IN%"rob_g@delphi.com"
    CC:     
    Subj:   Remove

    Would you please remove me as an amiga report distribution site, and 
    perhaps stick in some where in amiga report that the dead fish is dead. 
    Let them know I am taking the BBS down because the Amiga community no 
    longer exists in my area. Or just remove my name and be done with it :).
    My UUCP email will still be active.

    Cya on the nets!

    And thanks for bringing Amiga Report to the Amiga community.


We're really sorry to see him go, but I can certainly understand that if
there are no Amiga callers to your board, there isn't much point in having
it.  Again, we're sorry to lose you!

Oh, another note before I forget.  Our Internet Mailing List guy, Bob Caron,
is going to be offline for a while for a move from Massachusetts to Kansas,
so anybody wanting on or off the list, please get your requests in now.
Otherwise, it may take a few days to a week or more for your request to be
processed.  Thanks!

            » Hitachi to Market Re-Writable Optical Drives «

According to Hitachi Ltd., the company later this year will  begin selling
2-gig re-writable 5.25-inch optical disk drives.  Hitachi said the re-writable
optical disk can store 50% more data than  products of other makers available 
on the same size of disk.
  

           » Multimedia Expo - Analyzing The Games Industry «

At the "Analyzing the Games Industry - Investment and Return" session at the 
Multimedia Expo in San Jose, one of the featured speakers was Volpe Welty's 
Lee Isgur.

Isgur  identified Nintendo as the dominant player in the video game industry 
in terms of installed base and hardware.  However, he said that in terms of 
sales, the "8-bit machine is faltering very badly," but the "16-bit will do 
better in sales than last year."  He also said that, "Game-Boy is, at the 
moment, the leading portable platform."

He predicated that there would be 83 million units of software sales 
domestically this year.

He noted that Sega has been outselling Nintendo in the last few weeks in the 
US, in terms of new hardware and software sales.  However, he said he did not 
know if that would continue into the Christmas season.

He identified CD's as becoming the dominant factor in the industry in 
terms of software during the 1995-1997 period.

Interestingly, he said that which media the game industry uses will dictate 
where it goes. He maintained that the current cartridge industry is fairly 
expensive, and expects a shift to something else - such as flash cards or 
CD-ROMs.  He also said that the current hardware "is lousy," with no flat 
screens, no great colors.


            » IBM Microelectronics Has Faster PowerPC Chip «

IBM Microelectronics has announced a new version of the PowerPC 601 micro-
processor that runs at 80 MHz. Previous versions operated at 50 and 66 MHz.  
Company officials said the new chip would make possible desktop computers 
faster than any based on existing processors.
  
The PowerPC line of chips resulted from an alliance of IBM, Apple Computer 
Inc., and Motorola. The 601 is the first of four planned Power-PC parts.  
The PowerPC 603 is a power-saving version aimed  at  laptop, portable, and 
low-end desktop computers.  The PowerPC 604 is meant  for higher-performance 
desktop PCs and workstations. The PowerPC 620 will be the top of the line,  
meant for high-performance workstations and servers.  IBM plans to begin 
making these chips in 1994 and 1995,  Smith said.
  
The 601 chip has 2.8 million transistors, in a package about four tenths of 
an inch per side.  It includes the Motorola 88110 bus, which provides an 
advanced interface that supports a range of computer systems, including 
personal computers, workstations, and multiprocessing systems, the companies 
said.
  
  
          » Hewlett-Packard Announces Video Printing System «
  
Hewlett-Packard Co. this week announced the HP VidJet Pro, a product that  
allows video images from a wide range of sources to be printed on plain 
paper using most HP printers.
  
Designed for professional video production, the HP VidJet Pro has an 
easy-to-use interface that is also expected to attract advanced home 
hobbyists.  Users connect the HP VidJet Pro to any video source, such as 
a videotape player, television, camcorder, photo CD or laser-disc 
player.  They also connect the system to an HP DeskJet or LaserJet 
printer or HP DesignJet plotter. Images are stored as individual frames, 
sequences of frames or in pre-designated special formats, such as the 
first frame of every scene change.
  
HP-authorized video dealers are scheduled to begin taking orders  for 
the VidJet Pro in December.  Prices will vary depending upon options, 
starting at about $3,500.
  
   
                  » QMS Unveils Color Laser Printer «
  
QMS  Inc this week announced that it has begun quantity shipments  of 
its  ColorScript Laser 1000 Print System,  it first desktop color  laser 
printer.   The QMS ColorScript Laser 1000 produces color and  monochrome 
documents on a variety of paper stocks, including plain office paper.

The unit offers an output resolution of 300 dots per inch. Four self-
contained toner cartridges containing cyan (blue), magenta (red), yellow 
and black toner, supply the basic colors used to create a palette of 
millions of colors.

The QMS ColorScript Laser 1000 is compatible with most computer systems, 
networks and mixed computing environments. Its resident emulations 
include PostScript Level 2 and Level 1, HP PCL 5C with GL/2 (which 
supports color) and an optional DEC LN03 Plus emulation. Standard 
interfaces include parallel, serial and LocalTalk ports.

The QMS ColorScript Laser 1000 is available now and is priced at $12,499.
   
  
              » Seagate Intros New High-Capacity Drives «
  
Seagate  Technology  has announced 13 new  hard  disk  systems,  with 
storage capacity ranging from 214 megabytes (MB) to 9.1 gigabytes (GB).
  
Included  in the new lines is the ST410800 Elite 9,  a  9.1  gigabyte 
unit in a 5.25 inch full-height form factor.  Seagate says that the unit 
is designed for hierarchical storage and large file plus database appli-
cations.

The  ST15150 Barracuda 4 is a 4.1 GB 3.5 inch half-height  drive  for 
super servers, super computers, and high performance storage systems.
  
The  ST12450  Barracuda 2 is a 3.5 inch half-height  drive  that  can 
store up to 1.78 GB of data.
  
The Hawk family comes in 2.14 GB, 1.7 GB and 1.05  GB  versions, designed
for advanced workstations and super servers. Hawk comes in Fast SCSI-2 and 
Fast//Wide SCSI-2 versions in either single-ended or differential 
configurations.
  
In  the  under one GB category,  Seagate is introducing  the  ST5660, 
ST3491 and ST9550 families. The 5660 is available with AT or Fast SCSI-2 
interfaces,  has a 12 millisecond seek time. OEM pricing is $495 for the 
AT/IDE model and $545 for the Fast SCSI-2 version. The 9550 was designed 
for  use in portable computing units and can withstand shocks up to  100 
Gs and uses a disc substrate material called MemCor.  The  glass-ceramic 
canasite-based  media was developed jointly by Corning Glass  Works  and 
Seagate.  MemCor substrates can be manufactured much thinner than  other 
media and still retain rigidity. The ST9559 has a 16 millisecond average 
seek time.
  
  
             » Hayes Launches New Fax-Modem, Cuts Prices «
  
Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc. announced a new fax board which can 
work on two separate phone lines,  the JT Fax 144B Dual,  and cut prices 
on its older 9600 bits per second (bps) product by over 35%, to $369.
  
The new fax-modem is more than just a fax answering machine.  It eli-
minates  the  need  for  an additional voice  card  and  provides  voice 
announcement and prompting,  voice record and playback,  and the ability 
to enter commands through a touch-tone phone. It also off-loads the con-
version of files to the fax format from the main computer,  and  enables 
routine multi-board installations in a single computer,  limited only by 
the number of available slots.
  
The  modem  will  be available November 1  in  North  America,  Latin 
America,  and  Hong Kong,  with a further world-wide  rollout  following 
shortly thereafter.
  
  
                   » U.S. Robotics Sells Subsidiary «
  
Modem  maker  U.S.  Robotics Inc.  has sold  Communications  Research 
Group,  the subsidiary responsible for making and selling the BLAST com-
munications software product line,  to Blast Inc., a North Carolina cor-
poration.  U.S. Robotics said that it retained an equity interest in the 
new entity and "will work closely with Blast Inc. to ensure the needs of 
new and existing BLAST customers are met."
  
Robotics Vice President Ross Manire said,  "As we evaluated our  core 
business,  we recognized that CRG was not a strategic fit going forward. 
(This  sale) allows for more focus on what is a  very  support-intensive 
communications software line."
  

           » Motorola Announces a New Integrated Processor «

Motorola's  High  Performance Microprocessor Division this  week  an-
nounced the 68307,  a highly integrated processor ideal for a variety of 
portable,  low-power  applications such as digital cordless  telephones, 
portable measuring equipment and point-of-sale terminals.  The 63807 was 
originally  designed for the digital cordless phone products of a  major 
European  telecommunications  company.  The newest member of  the  68300 
Family  of Integrated Processors,  the 68307 features a  static  68EC000 
core processor with multiple bus interfaces.  It is the second processor 
designed using Motorola's standard cell design methodology.
  
"The  68307's high level of functional integration results in  reduc-
tions  in  power consumption,  board space and system cost  demanded  by 
today's portable devices," said Jim Reinhart, Motorola's manager, M68000 
marketing and applications.  "The 68307 is the only member of the  68300 
Family   of   Integrated  Processors  that  incorporates   several   bus 
interfaces,  providing glueless connections to a wide variety of  common 
system peripherals and memory."


                         » RAM Prices Falling «

On the July 4th weekend,  the Sumitomo Chemical plant in Japan exper-
ienced  an explosion that shut it down.  Since Sumitomo produces 60%  of 
the  world's high-quality epoxy resin,  the explosion resulted  in  sky-
rocketing RAM prices. Some suppliers reported RAM costs jumping 200-300% 
since the explosion.  Sumitomo announced this week that it will be  back 
in production in December.  This announcement has resulted in some  com-
pany's RAM prices dropping 10-20%,  with larger price reductions due  in 
December or January.
  
Epoxy resin may seem far removed from RAM chips, but the substance is 
critical to about 80% of the computer chips made today.  Alvin  Despain, 
Ph.D.,  an expert on computer architecture at the University of Southern 
California,  said  the  resin  protects the surface  of  the  integrated 
circuit (IC), has some thermal properties that help get heat out, and is 
the "glue" to hold down the silicon in the chips.


                    » Chip Rate Drops in September «

The chip industry's  key book to bill ratio took a dive last month to 
1.01, down from 1.08 in August, possibly indicating a much softer market 
for semiconductors than had been forecast.

The ratio means that for every $100 worth of products shipped in Sep-
tember  (billed),  manufacturers  received  $101  worth  of  new  orders 
(bookings).

    
                  » Online Service for Women Formed «

An online service devoted to women,  called WIRE (the Women's  Infor-
mation & Resource Exchange) has been created in San Francisco.
   
The service,  created by two computerists who are women, offers news, 
entertainment,  bulletin  board conversations and electronic  messaging. 
Subscribers pay $15 a month for two hours of use,  with additional  time 
billed at $2.50 an hour.
  
Sources  say  that  "in the 'virtual community'  formed  by  computer 
online services,  women represent 10% to 15% of online users. They often 
are made to feel unwelcome by men who dominate online conversations  and 
make sexually harassing comments."
   
WIRE  officials  said men are welcome,  but said  unruly  subscribers 
could be expelled from the system.
  

                 » Recall of Faulty Dell Notebook PCs «
  
Dell  Computer  Corporation has announced the recall  of  17,000  dis-
continued 320SLi and 325SLi notebook computers because of a faulty  part 
that, under certain circumstances, could cause a fire.
  
Dell said its engineers has determined that a capacitor on the mother-
board of both models might crack under physical stress. If that happens, 
the capacitor might overheat and cause a fire.
  
A  Dell  spokesperson said he only knows of the problem  happening  on 
three machines, and the company has been unable to replicate the problem 
in  the  lab.  However,  due to the safety aspect the  problem  Dell  is 
immediately recalling both models.  Registered owners are being notified 
by registered mail.
  
Owners of either model should return their machines to Dell so repairs 
can be made. Turnaround time will depend on how many owners return their 
units.   To  return one of the computers owners should contact  Dell  on 
their  toll free number between the hours of 8AM and  6PM  CDT.  Special 
customer  services representatives are available to arrange the  returns 
and answer questions.
  
  
                » Flying Toasters Arrive For DOS Users «
  
Berkeley  Systems has started shipping its DOS version of  After  Dark 
screen saver.
  
Screen savers, apart from looking good on screen, protect the computer 
monitor  from phosphor burn-in -- which is a problem when  monitors  are 
left on but inactive. The company says that After Dark can also increase 
privacy  -- to block access to a user's files,  the program  features  a 
screen-locking  security  system  that is deactivated only  by  a  user-
selected password.
  
After Dark for DOS also offers optional digitized sound  effects,  run 
through the internal PC speaker or through Sound Blaster or Ad Lib  com-
patible sound cards.
  
The package requires DOS 3.3 or higher, a VGA or SVGA display, 640k of

Best Data Products Inc.  is rolling out the ACE Advanced Communication 
Enhancement system, a breakthrough internal board for IBM-compatible PCs 
that  will  change  the  way small companies  and  at-home  workers  use 
computers.
  
Developed  in cooperation with IBM's  Microelectronics  division,  ACE 
merges fax,  modem,  sound,  telephone answering capabilities and CD Rom 
interface  onto a single card--a first-time feat made possible by a  new 
digital  signal processing (DSP) technology from IBM called  Mwave.  One 
ACE  board can take the place of four separate  cards,  saving  valuable 
space in the motherboard for other applications.
  
In  addition,  ACE defies obsolescence because it is  fully  software-
upgradeable, making it easy and inexpensive to add new applications such 
as  V.FAST,  color  faxing  and video teleconferencing  as  they  become 
available.  ACE  also reduces downtime because it  permits  simultaneous 
tasking,  enabling  a  user to continue working at the  computer  screen 
while  a fax is being sent or a phone message is being  taken.  Both  of 
these important features were made possible by the Mwave technology.
  
The ACE system comes with a 14,400 bps modem, a 9,600 bps fax with fax 
back and fax forward features,  and a 16-bit audio board with wave table 
synthesis.  It  requires  a 386SX MHZ processor with a 4 MB RAM  and  is 
designed to operate with Windows and OS/2. Suggested list price is $259.

Puette  has  been at Apple since 1990.  Apple officials said  the  USA 
general manager is leaving to pursue other interests.  However there are 
speculations  that Puette's resignation could be the result  of  Apple's

       » Apple Sets up a "Try Before You Buy" Software Division «
  
Joining  IBM and Gateway,  Apple Computer has announced a  new  CD-ROM 
delivery system for its software.   The initial offering will consist of 
80 software programs and will be handled by a new division called  Soft-
ware Dispatch.
  
Apple's  Software Dispatch division will handle 800 number calls  from 
users  who,  after providing a credit card number to purchase the  soft-
ware, can unlock applications on the Software Dispatch CD-ROM disc via a 
key given over the phone.
  
A  Quicktime  movie tutorial will be supplied to explain the  'Try  it 
first' purchase process.  Interactive tours, limited trial versions, and 
product   information  sheets  will  be  available  for  each   software 
application on the CD.  Customers may select the software by clicking on 
a button that adds the title to an electronic order form.
  
The electronic key will allow installation from the CD to a hard  disk 
of the software purchased. At the same time, the customer can also get a 
full set of product documentation that is identical to the print version 
that users would normally get in traditional packaging.  Hard copies  of 
the documentation can also be ordered.
   
Over 80 applications will be on the first CD,  featuring productivity, 
utilities, education, games, fonts, clip art and other applications from 
Symantec,  Claris,  Computer Associates, Intuit, Vividus, Spinnaker, and 
Lotus.
  
The CDs will be distributed free by mail beginning in November 1993 to 
Macintosh CD-ROM owners and in early 1994 to Windows CD-ROM owners.  The 
cost  of the software will be about the same as users can expect to  pay 
in software stores.

                »» Dataquest - CD-ROM Market Exaggerated ««

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1993 OCT 20 (NB) -- There is a
strong shift on the part of multimedia hardware makers towards 
software in the form of CD-ROM titles. 

Apple Computer, Media Vision, and Creative Technologies have all 
announced their intention to offer CD-ROM software titles in 
various forms. Traditional book publishers, such as Harcourt Brace, 
are getting to the act as well. However, Dataquest analysts say 
the race to CD-ROM may be premature.

Media Vision's Allen Thygensen, senior director and general
manager of multimedia publishing, told Newsbytes: "Content,
long term, is where the money is." 

Ian Diery, executive vice president of Apple Computer's 
Personal Computer Division, said the company sees such strong 
opportunity in the direction of content that it has gone as far 
as to spend $100 million to populate the market with CD-ROM 
hardware so it can sell CD-ROM titles.

Harcourt Brace and Company, a publisher in the educational
market, just recently purchased Archipelago Productions, a
California-based developer of CD-ROM and interactive computer
software and educational products, for the purpose of entering
the educational software market. Random House, another
educational publisher, recently announced a joint venture
agreement with multimedia software publisher Broderbund to
develop and distribute CD-ROM titles.

However, the market for CD-ROM drives and titles may not grow 
as fast as these companies anticipate, according to Bruce Ryon,
principle multimedia analyst with the market research firm
Dataquest. Ryon said exaggerated reports have had the CD-ROM
market as high as $3 billion, but Dataquest has been unable to
find any supporting evidence for a market larger than $600
million right now.

A recent Dataquest survey revealed only seven percent of a sample
population of 200 consumers with computers have CD-ROM drives
attached to their computers. Ryon says independent surveys he has
seen have held to the same proportions. This means the current
market for CD-ROM titles is a small subset of the PC market as
a whole.

In addition, Ryon said he found a whopping 85 percent of the CD
software titles are sold bundled with CD-ROM drives and those
surveyed said they were happy with the software that came in
the bundle. Less than fifty percent bought additional titles
after buying the CD-ROM bundle and most buyers said they did not
plan to purchase any more CD-ROM titles. As the CD-ROM drive
market becomes more competitive, manufacturers are considering
cutting their costs by eliminating the expense of the bundled
software, but Ryon says these companies are also afraid to
eliminate the bundles because they fear CD-ROM sales will drop
off altogether.

The main demand in the CD-ROM market is driven by the needs of
home business and home education, according to Dataquest. A
family can easily justify the purchase of a CD-ROM drive
bundled with an encyclopedia on CD as opposed to the $1,700 or
higher expense of an actual book set of encyclopedias, Ryon
said. In addition, other reference materials, medical
encyclopedias, and early learning software titles are also
finding acceptance in the home and small business markets. As
for the rest of the titles out there, Ryon quipped, "There's a
lot of content chasing not many potential buyers."

While there appears to be a nice growth curve ahead of 30 to 40
percent, the steep growth curves hyped by the multimedia
hardware companies are probably not going to occur, Ryon
claims. A handful of companies are doing well, such as Software
Toolworks with a $28 million revenue stream and Compton's in
the $26 to $28 million range. However, the vast majority of
content developers are small shops with total revenue of under
$50,000.

Why all the hype? Ryon says it is in the interest of the
multimedia hardware vendors to make the market sound lucrative.
These companies sell more hardware and get more developers to
make titles for the hardware, Ryon maintains.

AUTHOR:

DESCRIPTION:

     Mand2000D is the demo version of Mand2000, a fractal exploration
program.  Fractals are strangely beautiful mathematical objects which
have started appearing everywhere from book covers to rock videos.
The Mandelbrot set is probably the most popular of these fractals.
Its unique beauty and infinite complexity, derived from a simple
mathematical formula, have drawn thousands of people to explore the
Mandelbrot set on their computers.  Do note however, that no
mathematical ability is required to explore and appreciate fractals
with Mand2000.

     Mand2000 draws pictures of the Mandelbrot set and other fractals
on your Amiga and allows you to explore them by zooming in towards
interesting areas.  In Mand2000 we have attempted to combine speed,
power and simplicity with a few unique features, all designed to make
it easy for you to discover uncharted regions of the Mandelbrot set,
Julia set and other fractals.

     Mand2000D is a full version of Mand2000, except that saving and
printing have been crippled.

     What makes Mand2000 different?

     Point and click animated zooming is the most intuitive way of
exploring the Mandelbrot and Julia sets that we could think of.  It's
as easy as using a zoom lens on a camera.

     Until now the idea of driving through the Mandelbrot set would
have been absurd - now it's a reality.  Plug in your joystick to
scroll and zoom your way around the most complex object ever seen.

     Mand2000's multi-pass drawing means that even slower Amigas can
take a test drive.  It lets you see an approximation of the final picture
in just a fraction of a second.  Even for pictures that will take several
minutes to complete, you can get a good idea of what your picture will
look like almost immediately.  This allows you to decide quickly
whether to keep zooming, or wait for the completed picture.

     Mand2000 has a multi-window, multi-requester design.  You can
adjust parameters and see the changes in real time as Mand2000
continues calculating while you use the requesters.  Leave as many
requesters and fractal windows open as you want.

     Mand2000 lets you calculate fractal zoom movies quickly, by
calculating key frames and letting Mand2000's TweenPlayer create the
intermediate frames at playback.

     Just a few of the other features include:  full AGA support,
Picasso II compatibility, literally dozens of different assembly
language math routines for accuracies ranging from 16 bits to 1000+
bits, on-line help, printing, multi-level undo, built in locations to
start you searching, full featured ARexx support, several ARexx
scripts supplied, graphical displaying of your location, etc.

     These are just some of the more significant and innovative
features in Mand2000.  There are dozens more.

NEW FEATURES:

     Since version 1.001 we have added:

     An AppIcon, some new ARexx commands and scripts, and optional
disabling of joystick zooming, for compatibility with dongles, etc.

BUG FIXES:

     Fixed all known bugs.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:

     Requires version2.04 of the OS.
     Three fractal equations are always available.  Four more
fractal equations are available with a 68881, 68882 or 68040.

SHORT

     A protection system for several users

DESCRIPTION

       You've got an Amiga with Kickstart 2.04 or higher and several
     people are regularly fooling around with it ...  Last week your
     sister deleted your 20MB JPEG collection by mistake and you don't
     want this to happen again ...  Well, here's the answer:
     MultiUser!

       MultiUser allows you to create a *IX-like environment where
     several users live together in harmony, unable to delete each
     others files, unable to read those private love-letters of other
     users ...  And this even if several users are working on the
     machine at the same time (on a terminal hooked up to the serial
     port) ...

       You are the sole user of your computer?  Well, make sure it
     stays that way by installing MultiUser!  People without a valid
     login ID and password won't be able to access files you have made
     private with MultiUser.  If you make all files private (not
     readable for others), the only useful thing they could do, is
     boot from a floppy ...

       And ...  you do not have to reformat your hard drive!

NEW FEATURES

     - Better compatibility with ixemul.library (i.e. gcc/g++).

     - Groups can have a name.

     - Users can belong to more than one group.

     - Support for system monitoring.

     - Non-binding assigns (e.g. HOME: points always to your home
       directory, even if several users are using the same computer at
       the same time).

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     - AmigaOS Release 2.04 (V37+) or higher.

     - A Rigid Disk Block compatible hard drive/controller.

     - reqtools.library V38+ () Nico Frangois).

TITLE

     Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)

VERSION

     Version 2.3a PLUS

AUTHORS

             The original version was written by Philip Zimmermann,
     Branko Lankester, Hal Finney, Peter Gutmann and various other
     contributors. Amiga port and enhancements by Peter Simons
     <simons@peti.GUN.de>, based on the efforts of Cor Bosman.

DESCRIPTION

             Pretty Good(tm) Privacy (PGP), from Phil's Pretty Good
     Software, is a high security cryptographic software application for
     MSDOS, Unix, VAX/VMS, Amiga and other computers. PGP allows people
     to exchange files or messages with privacy, authentication, and
     convenience. Privacy means that only those intended to receive a
     message can read it. Authentication means that messages that appear
     to be from a particular person can only have originated from that
     person. Convenience means that privacy and authentication are
     provided without the hassles of managing keys associated with
     conventional cryptographic software. No secure channels are needed
     to exchange keys between users, which makes PGP much easier to use.
     This is because PGP is based on a powerful new technology called
     "public key" cryptography. And PGP performs the public-key
     functions faster than most other software implementations. PGP is
     public key cryptography for the masses.

             The release consists of two archives: The official release
     and an enhanced version. Both can be found on in the same directory
     on the AmiNet--see below for further details. The main archive
     contains everything you need to run PGP plus sources and several
     contributions, while the update-archive just contains the new PGP
     versions the the source-diffs of the changes that have been made.

Universal Message System (UMS) - Release 10.7 Available for FTP


TITLE

      Universal Message System (UMS)

VERSION

      Public Release 10.7

COMPANY

      Private developers

AUTHOR

      Various. Please consult the documentation

DESCRIPTION

      UMS is an universal mail and news system.

      UMS itself handles the message base. It uses a very fast message base
      with a standarized message format. The access to the message base is
      handled by standarized programmer interface (ums.library). Programmers
      support for C, Modula-2 and Oberon are included. The ums.library
      interface includes an ARexx interface and transparent networking
      support.

      External programs provide the interface to existing networks, e.g.
      Usenet over UUCP. Currently available are converters for UUCP, FIDO,
      Maus and Z-Netz. The standarized interface eases the creation of new
      converters.

      The standarized message format eliminates the need for specialized
      message readers or writers. Currently you can choose between a
      comfortable, MUI based program and old-style program which uses the
      console and the keyboard.

      Included is an Installer script for easy installation.

NEW FEATURES

       * IntuiNews, a MUI based message reader
       * ARexx interface
       * many new tools
       * updates to the existing tools

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

       * OS 2.04 (or better) is required
       * IntuiNews needs the MUI package (not included)

/// ONLINE WEEKLY Amiga Report Online                The lines are buzzing!
    ---------------------------------



From Fidonet's Amiga International Echo
---------------------------------------


  Well just so everyone knows in the business section of the Washington
Post there is a story on the CD^32. It is fairly long and speaks of C= in
a possibly possitive light (Basically C= is not dead yet, but could be if
nothing happens). Here is the first paragraph, so you can get an idea...

                        Commodore's Entertaining CD Player
           CD32 Is a Game, Video and Adudio Machine Rolled Into One

        Commodore, the company that once dominated the home computer-market
in the United States only to let that position slip through its circuits, has
quietly introduced a remarkable home-entertainment device that could take the
country by storm - or languish on store shelves.
        It could go either way for teh CD32 because Commodore can't - or
won't - spend more than pocket change to promote the device.


Anyway it goes on from there but my typing is not the greatest in the world,
so I guess it is up to you to find the article if you want to read this. It
is the second week in a row that the Amiga's have been mentioned in the
Washington Post (Last week it was basically Amiga's are still the best at
multimedia if you can find one. This was a paragraph in a story about
multimedia).

                                        Later,
                                        Rob Morton

From: Rich Koster (1:396/36.0)
To  : All
Subj: End of Poll

The poll has come to an end, asking Amiga users on various echoes if
they would pay for new games and productivity software made by Disney
if they were to decide to come out with more in the future.

The number of responses was quite low.  I have decided to not pass
along the names and responses of those taking part, but have instead
informed Dave Arnspiger of Disney Software what the numbers were.
If any of you responding are upset that I'm not passing your comments
along, remember that you always have the ability to write to Disney
yourself personally.

     Question: More support and/or buy more Disney productivity?

     No: 1          Maybe: 1          Yes: 29

Here on the Amiga echo, someone was interested in knowing if the
IBM version of Disney's The Animation Studio had ever been upgraded
and if it would get more updates in the future (this was asked
because the Amiga version has never been upgraded).

Dave Arnspiger responded to that question this way:

 DA> There are some plans to do an upgrade to the IBM version.  I don't
 DA> think that includes the AMIGA version, but I am not privy to those
 DA> high level issues.
     [...]
 DA> There have been several bug fixes and one upgrade
 DA> to IBM DAS and all that did was add support for Windows.

Thanks to one and all who took part in the poll!

Subj: Amiga Sighting

I just got back from seeing The Phantom of the Opera at the Pantages in
Toronto (this is not a small-time production) and whaddayaknow -- there
on the sound board setup was a C= 1084 monitor.  Looked down and there
were a couplea Amigas.  They use 'em to handle the sound -- even got a
mention in the program.  Didn't get a chance to ask what
hardware/software they use.

Also the local computer newspaper, Toronto Computes, has a two page
article on Commodore's Gould and Haig and their troubles with the
Commodore Shareholders' Movement.  Plus Robocop (the TV series) is in
production here with 3D graphics by Lightwave.

@toc "menu"


/// Usenet Review:  Hired Guns
    ---------------------------
    By David W. Lowrey
    (dwl10@juts.ccc.amdahl.com)


PRODUCT NAME

        Hired Guns


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

        An "adventure" game for 1-4 players, where each player controls one
or more of the computer characters.



AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

        Name:           DMA Design (distributed by Psygnosis)
        Address:        29 Saint Mary's Court
                        Brookline, MA 02146
                        USA


LIST PRICE

        I paid $44.95 (US) at a "full service" Amiga store.
        I don't know the list price.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE

                At least 1 Meg of memory.

                If you have a 2 meg Agnus chip, the program will use
                extra sound effects.

                It works on my 68020-based Amiga, so I would imagine
                that other processors are supported.

                Supports up to 4 floppy drives.

                A special parallel adapter can be bought, or made, that
                allows 2 additional joysticks to be used.

                The game also allows you to use a modified Sega "Joypad" in
                place of a joystick.

        SOFTWARE

                ?


COPY PROTECTION

        Look up a word in the manual. The disks are copyable, and the game
is hard disk installable.

        The "look up a word...." scheme isn't too bad as the game doesn't
always ask you!  I would rate the copy protection as acceptable.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        Amiga 2500
        68020 processor board with 2 meg Fast RAM
        2091 SCSI controller with 2 meg Fast RAM
         (total of 5 meg memory, of which one meg is Chip RAM)
        AmigaDos 2.1

INSTALLATION

        The program either runs off of floppies, or off of your hard drive.
The hard disk version of the game does not take over the system. You can
pause the game and switch to the Workbench. The game returns to the
Workbench when you exit.  The floppy version takes over the system, and you
have to reboot when you are finished with the game.

        Floppys do not require any installation, other than the judicial
practice of copying the originals and playing from the copies.

        To install the game on a hard drive, drag the Install icon into the
drawer you wish to contain the HiredGuns directory.  Then double-click the
Install icon.  5 languages are supported.

        You have the choice of installing the complete game, including the
extra music, or just a minimal configuration.

        The disk comes on 5 floppies, and takes about 1.5 meg of hard drive
space.


REVIEW

        NOTE: I have had the game for 24 hours now, so this is really a
first impression.  If my opinion changes, or if I have the facts wrong, I
will send in an update.

        Hired Guns is somewhat like an RPG, or "adventure" game, where you
have a party of "adventurers", and you go on a quest of some sort, solving
puzzles and fighting bad guys along the way. You usually have a "window"
that shows what the party sees.

        Hired Guns is like that, plus a whole lot more.  Up to 4 players
control 4 computer characters at the same time.  The players can use up to
two mice, the keyboard, or joysticks to control the computer players. Each
input device can control one or more computer players. The program supports
a parallel port joystick adapter.  Other games, such as Gauntlet, use this
same device.

        When there are only one or two players, they have to use a mouse.
That means that for a two player game, you need two mice.  Three or 4 players
have the option to select the input device.

        Each computer character can also be told to "follow the leader", so
you can move up to 4 characters at once.  This "Auto Leader" mode will cause
the computer characters that have the mode enabled to follow the currently
moving character.

        Each computer character has its own view window, so each can be in a
different place at the same time.  If player 1 is standing in front of
player 2, then player 2 sees player 1 in front of him.

        You have your choice of 12 different computer characters.  You
cannot edit their "stats" nor add your own characters.  However, you CAN
edit the graphics for each character using any Amiga paint program.  Each
character has an ILBM IFF file containing the different views of that
character.  You can edit the pictures, perhaps replacing them with your own
picture, and use that in the game.

        The view windows are in "3D" style, so you get the illusion of
depth. The graphics are relatively detailed, but they do not blow you away.

        The purpose of the game is for the players to eradicate the area of
the various mutants that happen to be there.  You are provided various
weapons, and more are found that allow you to do this.

        You move your computer characters around the a landscape consisting
of grass, trees, multi-level buildings, tunnels, and rocks.  There are also
water channels, sometimes multi-leveled, that you can (or have) to wander
around in.  There are devices available (you hope) that will allow humans to
breathe, and keep robots sealed for a few minutes.

        There are stairs and elevators that move you up and down.  There are
big blocks that you push and pull around to allow you or another computer
character to get across a chasm or water channel.  There are force fields,
teleport fields, and doors that need to be removed, accessed, or opened.
Many of the puzzles require cooperation between computer characters to
complete.

        And, of course, there are the "Bad Guys."  There are many different
ones, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  It is up to you to
figure out the best defense and the appropriate weapons that are necessary
to deal with each creature.

        Each character has an inventory of items, called a "store".  Items
can be picked up, dropped, and equipped, using each computer character's
store window.

        If a computer player has the appropriate device, a map of where he
or she has been is automatically kept, and is displayable.

        The game has several modes. There are "Training" missions, "Short
Campaign" games, and the "Full Campaign" game. The training missions start
out easy and get progressively harder.  The "short campaign" games can
usually be completed in one sitting.  When there are more that one "human"
playing the game, they can compete with each other to see which one
completes the level first.  The "Full Campaign" has about 20 different sites
you have to visit, each with different puzzles and varying degrees of
difficulty.  Fortunately, you can save your "Full Campaign" game between
playings on floppy, Hard Drive, or in RAM.


DOCUMENTATION

        The program comes with 4 different manuals.  However, I am not
impressed with the contents.  Much of the information you need is either
spread out between the manuals, or not there at all.

        The manuals are: "Amiga Instructions", which tells you how to
install and operate the game; "Game Manual", which describes the various
games, and some of the objects in the game; and "The Luyten System, a
Background" which describes the bad guys and weapons.  It also describes and
the local planetary system, which is for "color" only and not necessary
to play the game.  Finally, the "Countdown To Graveyard" manual gives a
history to what is happening, and also describes the Good Guys.

        All of the apostrophes (') are missing in the manuals!

        None of the manuals describe any sort of strategy that might be of
help.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

        I really like having 4 independent characters to control.  You have
each character's view in front of you at all times.

        I also like the balance between fighting and problem solving.  The
problems are just as important as the fighting.  They are also logical
problems, such as "how the heck can I get down 4 stories without killing
myself," as opposed to being randomly teleported somewhere for no apparent
reason.

        I like the hard drive installability, and the relatively
non-intrusive copy protection.

        I like the ability to play with 3 other players (which I haven't
tried, yet).


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        There was a demo of this program released earlier this year.  The
play is basically the same, but items such as "group mode" work much better.


BUGS

        None found, yet.


CONCLUSIONS

        This is a much waited-for game, and it was well worth the wait!

                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA or through Tymnet from anywhere in
North America.  If you have an account on another Internet-connected
system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet programs, from
anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users can now Telnet
into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 · Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

 · The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software, online.

 · Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

 · Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES.

 · 35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

 · No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

 · Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

 · Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

 · Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

 · FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
 · Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  

 · Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

 · The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
 · Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
 · All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

 · Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

 · And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

REVIEW

        Civilization is game based on the history of the world.  You start
off as a leader of a small neanderthal, nomad tribe which is looking for a
place on this planet to start its first settlement.  From here, you try to
build an empire that can last through the ages.  You have scientists that
try to achieve new discoveries or new technology which you can then use.
Your decisions on what the Scientists can research make very large changes
between one possible future and another.  Not only that, but you have to
handle properly what ideas your tribe knows now.

        You start with only two types of people you can send out from your
town or towns.  You can send out Militia (cheap and fast to make, are pretty
weak fighters, but still are your only chance at defense at the beginning of
the game). You can also send out Settlers (these are pretty dynamic), which
can do one of several things.  The settlers can go out and

        1. Try to find a place to build yet another town.
        2. Irrigate plains so that they reap more food.
        3. Change plains to forest or vice versa.
        4. Build roads so that any unit (types of people or machines; we'll
           call them units from now on) can move 3 times as fast.

Roads, obviously, are best when built from town to town.

        The main 2 screens that you use the most are the Main Map screen and
the Town screen.  In the Main Map, you manipulate your units, look around
your known part of the world, and control main game functions.  In the Town
screen, you control aspects of the town and choose what the town builds
(it'll show you how many turns it will take to finish the project too). You
can also manipulate how the town farms, and how much food, water, fish, oil,
diamonds, gems, and ore that the town brings in.  Much food comes from ripe
and irrigated lands, especially if those lands have Game in them.  (Game
means animals that can be hunted for food.  Australian Aboriginals politely
go for game like certain deer to survive, for example.  I'd like to visit
them myself -- they seem like nice blokes.)  OK, back to the game.

        You do this, and manipulate troops for fortifications or scouting
around.  You usually will use troops to discover new parts of the world.  At
the beginning, you can only see a small square around your first group of
settlers (which you start with), but as you move around in the map, those
black unknown squares become known territory.  Beware, there are other
civilizations out there trying to do the same thing.  Gameplay changes (much
like Dune) as you discover more things, then makes a drastic change when you
meet other civilizations.

        When you meet other civilizations, things come to war, peace,
treaties, spies, Diplomats, stealing technology, encouraging other
civilization's cities to go under revolt, political chaos, restoring or
making new order, and more.  Messengers from one republic to another.  While
doing all that you did before and more.  Soon, you have a magnificent empire
(if you last that long) with all sorts of towns that you have to worry
about; and the way the game leads you in the comfortable learning curve, you
are surprised that you could probably remember specific things about all of
the 50+ towns that you have.

        Technology goes with learning the alphabet, establishing writing,
and building literacy which gives birth to messengers and diplomats.  There
are also the wheel, automotion, and mathematics... in which the first and the
third would allow the use of catapults, because your men need mathematics to
understand the true theory of projectile motion.  When you learn those, you
can have catapult units attack other towns and such, but are easily taken
out by decent ground troops. Some discoveries make others obsolete.  The game
goes on an on, getting more complex as it goes, even to the age of the space
race (if you lived that far, or any other civilizations lived that far while
you are there).

        Yes, for those of you who are into nuking people, they go as far as
nuclear weapons and a bit past them.

        Now the sound.  Well, who asked for sound in Civilization anyways?
Well, don't fret.  The music is as nice as it gets for this kind of game.
It's decent, but not earthshattering, but the music is very appropriate
during the beginning and introduction sequences.  You also have the main
theme of your tribe or civilization play when certain special events happen
to you.  Otherwise, no in-game music (which is nice, because in-game music
can be annoying with this kind of game, and the authors know it).  There is
sound in the game, as you hear a digitized sword clashing sound when two
units fight, or the sound of workmen and woodworkers when a new development
is built in a city for example.


AGA VERSION INFORMATION

        Well, the first difference is the title.  It's not just called
Civilization:  it is actually called Civilization AGA.  It seems they really
wanted to make note of the difference.  Technically, I can say this is
probably one of the best IBM ports ever made.  The 256 color screens often
show some nice graphics in which they were directly converted from the IBM
original and some look like they were touched up a bit.  To enjoy the
graphics truly, you need a real monitor.  Though, they look great on a
television, but they look very sharp and refined on the monitor.

        Now the speed.  It looks like they decided to not make the same
mistake they did with the first Amiga (old chip set) version of Civilization.
They decided to Amigatize the game to bring more enjoyable fulfillment of
this work. The graphics look good and the game doesn't run slowly at all,
even with my stock A1200 system.  Civilization AGA multitasks with the
operating system.  It runs on an Intuition screen which you can use your
AMIGA keys and M, N or the mouse to screen-flip, or drag down screens to use
other programs in the process.  Even with just 2 megs of memory, you can run
certain software while playing Civilization, so it is a boon and a plus for
the game.  Another great thing about the speed is, though you see the
Civilization screens normally animate things, you are not restricted:  it is
all done strictly in the Civilization AGA Intuition screen.  The speed at
which you can handle other things in the background makes Civilization AGA
seem that it is hardly using the CPU at all.

        The scrolling at the beginning isn't smooth, but it wasn't meant to
be that way.  This was coded that way so it would move slowly enough to match
the music that plays with it.  Even a pixel by pixel smooth scroll on the
Amiga would be too fast because you need a certain frames per second in
order to have a smooth scroll (still too fast).  It's just neat to move the
screen around while it does this.  Planet generation is pretty swift, when
you choose to start new game or choose to have your own custom-made planet.
You can even hit the spacebar or Enter keys so that it skips part of the
animated introduction when the planet generation is finished.  Even on a
stock A1200, you never have to go through the whole introduction to wait for
the planet to be constructed.


DOCUMENTATION

        The real explanation of the game takes up 70+ single-spaced
typewritten pages.  Sounds daunting, eh?  Well, when I first saw the IBM
original of this game, when someone was already up to developing the train,
concepts were going around in it that I couldn't comprehend.  But if you
play the game from start to finish, you seem to never lose your place.  It
has a great learning curve that guides you through history.  And as the game
and your civilization get more intelligent, so does the player.

        The game also includes a full Civilization Encyclopedia, which tells
you about all aspects of the game, aspects of the various technologies and
things people can learn, often with picture illustrations (some which look
quite nice with a gradient blue background) and comparisons to how this was
achieved or what significance this had in Real Life Earth History.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

 ---- Dislikes ----

        This game is well done, but I have one small gripe.  The gripe is
the special effect of the fade between some screens. They do the smooth
color fade for transitions between the Main map and the Civilopedia, or
when you want the Bird's Eye view of the city. My gripe is that it is faster
to simply jump to the next screen than to do a smooth color fade (which is
probably faster on A1200s with Fast RAM or accelerated AGA machines; e.g.,
A4000 or 68030/040 accelerators).  I don't like to wait a second to flip
between screens, though it looks neat:  I would like the choice to do without
them.  When on the town screens and you click on a part of the screen that
doesn't do anything, it will redraw the screen. It redraws quick as a jump
jet, but the redrawing is unnecessary, especially since the Amiga mouse is a
sprite.  It is the smaller of my two gripes.

 ---- Likes ----

        Probably the best IBM conversion to date, and they even were nice
enough to improve over that original in Civilization AGA.  It adheres more to
the AmigaDOS standard except for the way you use the menus (in which the left
mouse button and the right mouse button have the same function). It's
comfortably fast for any AGA machine, and takes up just 1.1 megs of memory
for those who like multitasking.  And it is the best educational program for
the High School/College-level student while being one of the most addictive
games of the century. This game broke in a lot of gameplayers who, before,
didn't like strategy-style games.  Having this kind of stuff and animation in
a standard Intuition screen is neat as it is nice.  It'll have you playing
for ages and has randomly generated maps, and has gameplay that changes based
on your decisions in a tree-like structure. The more decisions you make, the
more branches are on the gameplay tree.


BUGS

        I have found no bugs at all with the program itself. It seems to
clean up resources cleanly after exit. I've tested it with Hires/Lores Mice,
various Workbench screenmode setups, but haven't yet been able to screw up
the program. The only bug seems to be running it after some other Buggy
program that doesn't clean up its resources well.  The program may hit a
vector that the other program trashed, but made open for other program use.
I can't blame Civ AGA for that though.  I have managed to run something that
must've cause Civilization's graphics to get a bit garbled, but you can tell
it straight from the beginning.  If the title of Civilization looks OK at the
beginning, the rest of the graphics will too.  You may need to do an 'avail
flush' command or flush the libs in the debug menu when your Workbench is
invoked with "loadwb -debug".  That is, if you use buggy programs.


CONCLUSIONS

        If you have an AGA machine, and don't have Civilization AGA, I'd
suggest you go for it.

        Well, that's my review.  Happy Civilizing. :)

/// The Emulation Rambler
    ---------------------
    By Jason Compton
    (jcompton@meltdown.chi.il.us)



Off I go again, this week with an IBM C-64 emulator and some ensuing 
questions of legality...

The C-64 Emulator Demo, while not very cleverly named, does what it 
says for a sufficiently fast IBM with a SoundBlaster compatible card. It 
emulates a C-64. I haven't had time or the resources to extensively test its 
emulation (which I'll explain in a minute), but from the demo programs 
included with the package, this emulator does pretty much exactly what it 
says.

Since it's a demo version, SOMETHING has to be disabled.  In this case, 
you can't access any drives, only the 10-15 programs the author has 
placed in the package, selectable by an internal menu and then loaded 
using just plain old "load", like a tape.  It's a LOT faster, though.
Blindingly 
so.  Admittedly, my test machine is a 486/66, but the emulator is alleged to 
work to 100% capacity on a 386/40 or 486/33.  Obviously, these are machines 
considerably more expensive than the $60 you can get a refurbished 64 for 
these days, (or even a new C-65!) but, as I always say, it's the emulation 
that counts.

The author includes about 10 games and a demo or two.  A couple of 
them didn't run, but the ones that did ran flawlessly, albeit a bit too 
fast, and the internal speed controls didn't seem to do a whole lot to help, 
except to speed it up more.  Joystick emulation is provided using the arrow 
keys (another drawback).  The music from the SoundBlaster Pro sounds like 
SID music to me.  All in all, it's a considerably more faithful emulation of 
a 64 than A64 for the Amiga.  At this point, however, there just MIGHT be a 
slight bit of doubt about the authenticity of the emulation.  For all we 
know, it JUST MIGHT be an elaborate farce, and the programs have been 
specially modified to run from what looks for all the world like a C-64. I 
truly believe that it's the real thing however.

How real? Here's where the legality comes from. From what I've read of 
the sparse documentation (it's a 64, how much could you possibly need?), 
all it says is that 6510 code is emulated faithfully.  It does NOT mention 
what sort of kernal is interpreting the code once it's emulated, but I am 
inclined to believe that it's the original 64 kernal and BASIC ROM being 
used in the program, unlike A64, whose programmer wrote his OWN kernal and 
BASIC. Anyone who would successfully attempt such a feat would (and deserves 
to) take credit for it, and the C-64 Emulator author does not.  Plus, the 
games on the demo are all games which were commercial.  Is all of this 
illegal?  Yep.  But I am forced to question just HOW illegal it is: after 
all, it would be rather difficult to legitimately buy a copy of Spy Vs. 
Spy, since the game is no longer in circulation.  The same case can be made 
for the 64 ROMs.  Another interesting parallel is the proliferation of 
Kickstart files in the Amiga world...we all know that developer copies of 
KS 2.0 and above have spread around boards, providing semi-workable 
alternatives to buying a new ROM (I have legitimate 2.1 and feel it was 
worth the money).  At the same time, due to machines which have come out 
with KS 2.04, 2.05, and now 3.0, which have zero compatibility with some 
of the picky 1.3 and below programs, kick files for 1.3 have been published 
in PD disk magazines (a legal faux pas), and I myself have downloaded a copy 
of Kickstart 1.1 (yes, 1.1), back when title bars had the thinnest possible 
horizontal lines running through them, presumably to look like a Macintosh.  
The distribution of 1.3 and 1.1 would still be illegal, since Commodore-Amiga 
holds the copyright...and 1.3 IS still sold in ROM form in some places.  But 
v1.1 is something Commodore hasn't sold in years, and somehow I doubt it is 
practical to come knocking on my door asking for payment.  I got a companion 
copy of Workbench 1.1, and still get a kick out of the three graphics demos 
they included, and the ability to TURN OFF CLI in Preferences.

I was actually glad I didn't submit an article for AR129, as Jim Drew's 
conference was much more informative. I figured I'd do a little responding 
to it, however...

First, in answer to the question "...why anyone would want other platform 
emulation"...my answer is threefold-first, if there's ANY software for that 
computer you need to run, you can just pop it into your Amiga and run 
it-second, you can use it to impress the hell out of other computer 
users-and third, it's just incredibly neat to be able to take another 
computer's screen, multitask it, and still do silly things like click on the
title bar and fling it up and down.  Not to mention the fact that as software 
becomes sparse for the Amiga in business/application areas, Emplant (or 
other emulators) provide often cheaper solutions than going out and 
buying a new computer-not to mention the fact that in getting an emulator 
or Emplant, you keep as much money as possible out of the rival company's 
hands.  I am curious to see just how well 386/486 emulaton will work without 
a true 386/486 on the board... and that Utilities Unlimited would give away 
all 8-bit emulators is enough to set me to drool...not to mention make me 
think VERY seriously about getting an Emplant.  Money and practicality have 
prevented me up until now...but if I can get a 64, Apple II, and Atari 
emulator free, I think they've got another customer.

A side note: I realize I have been somewhat lax in reporting on Amiga 
emulators lately, and I apologize. With school and the lack of any new 
Amiga emulators that I've actually gotten in my hands, my range of 
knowledge has been a bit depleted. I'm working on getting a set of 
benchmark comparisons between PC-Task and SoftPC, but I need someone with a 
faster Amiga than my 020/14 to run the tests.  For now, I'll close.  Until 
next week, remember: Tell a friend about what the Amiga can do. Tell your 
neighbors what the Amiga can do. Tell ANYBODY with ANY remote interest about
the Amiga. Make them get one. I'm not kidding.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    By Kurt Haenen
    (haenen@cs.kuleuven.ac.be)



Hi there Amigoids,

I've  replaced my Retina 4MB board with an EGS 28/24 Spectrum with 1MB (It was
supposed  to  have  2MB, but there were some problems with the delivery) and I
want  to  share  my  opinion of both boards with you.  First of all :  I won't
compare  any  24bit  capabilities  at  the moment because it wouldn't be fair,
since I only had 1MB in the Spectrum, but lets talk about the rest.

The  Spectrum  sure has one thing my Retina didn't have :  good documentation.
Well,  that  is at first sight.  The docs clearly explain installing and using
the  software  that  comes  with  the  Spectrum,  ie.   the EGS system.  So, I
installed the stuff and tried it ...  At first it seemed to run fine, but then
...   FREEZE  ...  So, I reset my machine, start enforcer and what do we get ?
Yup, enforcer hits.

Enforcer Hit!  Bad Program!

These  are  just  some  examples of the Enforcer hits I get.  They all are BUS
ERRORS,  but  the  address  read  from  or  written to changes.  This is on an
A4000/040  with Zorro III on the Spectrum enabled.  I won't consider disabling
this,  cause  it's the only reason to have a Spectrum instead of a Picasso.  I
have  a  fat-buster revision 9, so this may be the problem, but it is not very
likely.   Since the board doesn't do DMA, the buster-bug should not affect it.
The  strange  thing is that there IS memory at that place (the graphics memory
of  the  Spectrum).   Has  anyone  else  experienced  this ?  Oh yeah, running
enforcer gives me a system that doesn't freeze up anymore, but everytime a bus
error  is  generated,  the  system  freeze  for a moment.  I send the enforcer
output  to  NIL:  so it isn't the printing of the output that causes this, but
the  bus  error  itself.  I also run the program that came with the board that
turns of the cache for the address-space of the card.

Before  you read on, I have to say that I have a 2 monitor system, so I do not
use the built-in display-switcher and I have told this to the install program.
One  thing  I  liked  about  my  Retina  was the way screens were handled, ie.
exactly  the  same  as standard Amiga screens.  Cycling through screens on the
Retina would also include standard Amiga screens, but on the Spectrum they are
completely  apart.   To  switch between Amiga and Spectrum screens you have to
use  a  hotkey, you can not simply press the screen-depth gadgets to get to an
Amiga  screen  if  the current one is a Spectrum screen.  And something really
anoying  is  that  when  your  using  the  standard  Amiga  modes  and use the
screen-depth  gadget  on  such a screen, the monitor has to resync even if the
underlying screen uses the same display mode.  Yet another software problem.

There  is  an  option to allow you to have a connection between the Amiga side
and  the  Spectrum  side, so that moving the mouse off a screen on one monitor
will  make  it  appear on the other one, but still it keeps blanking the Amiga
screen  when I move the mouse off it, so it isn't very useful.  Also the mouse
keeps  appearing  at  the wrong place when moving from the Amiga screen to the
Spectrum screen.  You move the mouse off the left edge of the Amiga screen, so
you  would  exspect it to appear at the right edge of the Spectrum, but NO, it
appears at the left edge :{(

The EGS system supplied catches your eye for a few moments.  Windows move with
their  entire  contents visible, you can put pictures in the background of the
screen,  have  a  24bit drawing in a window on top of that and simply drag the
window  and  its  contents in real-time.  This surely means the board is quite
fast  and  the supplied screen-blankers (especially scooter) only adds to this
impression,  *BUT*  if you have more than 1 screen on the Spectrum, the screen
cycling  (with  A-m  or the screen-depth gadget) is *SLOW* !  The Retina was a
lot faster at doing this and it think this board could do it a lot faster too,
so  my  guess  is that it's another glitch in the software.  To continue about
the  EGS  stuff:   it  really  sucks.  As I said, at first it looks great, but
then:  the clock always crashes, the display disappears (I mean the EGS screen
is  closed)  regularly,  simply  because there seems to be a small shortage of
memory  (I  have  8MB  fast-ram  and  still  it  isn't  happy)  and no serious
application  (I  mean  existing software) works under EGS.  I haven't found an
ADPro driver on my disks, so I couldn't use ADPro to display stuff and the EGS
viewer  can't  read  anything  else  than IFFs.  Once again I wanted my Retina
back.   It  may  have  been  a slower board, but the software was reliable and
useful.   It  didn't  crash  on  me  for  over 6 months. The Spectrum software
doesn't  crash  either (if we forget about the EGS stuff and only consider the
screenmodes), but there are a lot of things that aren't right:

  - To begin with: the enforcer hits.  This may be a hardware problem though.

  - When  using  CED 3.5 and opening a duplicate view (Amiga-d), the cursor is
    drawn  twice (in XOR I guess) in the newly opened view, so that is becomes
    invisible.   The  second cursor scrolls up and down together with the text
    and  only  disappears when you scroll enough to get it out of sight.  This
    problem  never  appeared  on the Retina or the Amiga native display, so it
    must be a bug in the Spectrum software.

  - As  stated  above, screen-shuffling is *SLOW*.  The Retina was at least 10
    times  faster  at  this than the Spectrum.  Since the Spectrum has a Zorro
    III  bus  and  the Retina only Zorro II, this should not be the case, so I
    guess  it's  again a software problem.  REMARK:  Could some Picasso owners
    tell  me  how fast the Picasso is in screen-shuffling.  I flip through the
    screens  a  lot  and I would like this to be snappy.  Also for the Picasso
    users:   Is  it  true that you can drag down screens on the Picasso to see
    the underlying screen ?  I heard this rumour ...

  - Powersnap  doesn't  work  anymore.  I do not know what exactly seems to be
    the  problem,  so  this could be a Powersnap bug, but it did not appear on
    the Retina.  Maybe it's because the screens are in fastram now.

  - There  are  no  programmers  docs  except  for the EGS stuff.  This really
    sucks.   I  am not going to write something for EGS.  Actually I hate EGS.
    All the nice commodities I have are useless on an EGS screen.  Oh well, my
    feelings  about  EGS  are probably not shared by others, so I won't bother
    you  with  them, but I really think they could have done a better job than
    this:   who the hell needs all those EGS gadgets and menus when you've got
    Amiga gadgets and menus *AND* MUI (which in my opinion are better).

No  promotion utility was provided with the Spectrum, but since I'm the author
of Promotor, that wasn't a big problem.

The  Spectrum of course has some advantages:  faster scrolling than the Retina
and  (silence)  ...   Well,  that's  about it.  The software of the Retina was
simply  a  lot  better  than the stuff for the Spectrum.  I have also used the
EGS-DisplayAdjust  program  to  get the most out of my monitor and yet again I
was  not  impressed.  The Spectrum can not achieve the same resolution/refresh
rate  my Retina could.  This seems quite odd, especially since all the talk in
comp.sys.amiga.graphics  indicated  that  the  max.  pixel speed of the Retina
should  be  lower  than  that  of  the  Spectrum.  I should state however that
according to the manual that came with my Retina, the Retina has a 90MHz pixel
speed,  not  75 as mentioned in all the comp.sys.amiga.graphics articles.  But
because  of  the  limitations  of  my  monitor  I  don't think the pixel speed
limitation  is  the  problem.   The real problem is the sprite.  My Retina did
800x600x8  bit at 86Hz on my monitor, the Spectrum can only go upto 83Hz, if I
push  it  higher, the sprite pointer gets screwed up if it's at the top of the
screen.   The  Retinas image also filled up my display nicely.  When using the
Spectrum,  even  when I turn my monitors knobs so that the display is as large
as  possible,  there  still  are  black  borders  to the left and right of the
screen.  I can remove those borders, but that means dropping the refresh rate
and  I don't wonna do that: I was just getting used to the rock-steady 86Hz.

Another problem with the Spectrum is the mouse-pointer:  the Retina had a nice
4-coloured (1 transparent) sprite for this, but the Spectrum seems to use some
weird  kind  of  sprite, with a kind of half-transparent color.  I do not like
this  !   Of course this is a question of taste.  Another anoying thing is the
image  the  sprite  uses:   I  work  on an A4000 and so I normally use a hires
sprite, but this seems to screw up the color information of the sprite used on
the  Spectrum.   Again a software problem.  REMARK:  Again, could some Picasso
II   users   tell   me   whether   or  not  the  Picasso  II  sprite  is  also
half-transparent.  Both cards use the Cirrus Logic chip-set, so my guess would
be  that  the Picasso also has this type of sprite, but I would really like to
know for sure.

Ok,  I'm  gonna wrap it up here ...  Conclusions:  I want my Retina back.  The
scrolling  was  slower, but the software was a lot better and it was *STABLE*.
Once again it has been proven to me that even the nicest board is shit without
decent  software.  Well, I guess that's about it.  I'll be giving the Spectrum
back to the store and will probably get a Picasso II (which seems to have much
better software) and a bit of money back.  Of course, due to the same chipset,
I guess the Picasso II will also have some of the problems (sprite and display
size)  I mentioned here, but at least you get a decent workbench emulation and
drivers  for ADPro and of course it's a lot cheaper than the Spectrum.  At the
moment  I  don't  think the Zorro III facility of the Spectrum is of much use:
under  normal  WB  operation, fast data transfer is only needed when scrolling
something.   And since both boards have a blitter to speed up this operation a
bit  (if  not  the  entire  area  needs to be refreshed), I don't think you'll
notice  the  additional speed of Zorro III a lot.  And then of course there is
the  fact  that  generally  German  firms have better software updates than US
companies.   I  know I'm gonna get flamed for this, but I really think this is
true.  GVP for example has an excellent record of supplying the user with neat
manuals,  but  I  haven't  heard  about  any software upgrade for any of their
products  (ok, maybe it's cause I'm in Europe).  MacroSystem for example has a
very  bad  record  concerning  manuals  (my  Retina came with some photocopied
stuff), but their software is continually updated and enhanced.  Ok, that's my
opinion, let the flamin' start :{)

One  last remark:  I think it's really outrageous that the graphics boards for
the Amiga cost so much money.  An EISA board with a Cirrus Logic chipset on it
(the  same  one  as in the Spectrum, Picasso and Piccolo) costs about $150 US,
while  the  Spectrum costs about $400 US.  For that kind of money a 80x86 user
gets  a  really fast Localbus S3 board which can do 1280x1024 in 24bit at 72Hz
non-laced.   With  the  bankrupcy (how does one write that) of C= being only a
small  step  away  (How  are  the CD32 sales in your country ?  How's the SEGA
promotion  campaign on your TV-station ?  Have you seen a single C= commercial
on  TV  ?   And  just  how many CD32 games have you seen ?  Didn't C= say that
there  were  going  to  be  17  games out by the time the CD32 was going to be
released  ?), maybe we should consider porting the Amiga look and feel to some
other platform.


                                          Hoping to get a better board soon,

knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  You're likely 
to find many others in similar situations who can offer advice, give 
technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.

BIX is divided into areas called conferences, each devoted to a 
particular area of interest.  They range from algorithms to windows,
from writers to amiga.  Conferences are categorized into groups,
usually referred to as exchanges, so that you can browse through
whatever groups interest you and see a list of the conferences it 
contains.


                  These are some of the exchanges on BIX:

amiga.exchange - the place for Amiga developers and enthusiasts
byte - the full text of each issue of BYTE magazine; source code too 
e.and.l - Entertainment and Leisure; music, pets, games, more
ibm.exchange - everything from OS/2 to PC clones
mac.exchange -  Mac news, support, software, advice
professionals - consultants, engineers, financiers gather here
programmers - some of the best brains in the business!
wix - the Information Exchange for Windows; Windows Magazine online
writers.ex - the professional and amateur writer's exchange


                       *** FULL INTERNET ACCESS! ***

/// Amiga Ramblings
    ---------------
    by Robert Niles


Well since I couldn't think of anything *real* to talk about I thought I'd
make you suffer through a bit of my charming wisdom, and plain common sense.

OK, I'm done.

Naw, not really. For those of you who followed my articles on using the
InterNet through email, I need to make a correction...if you haven't figured
it out yorself already. On the InterNIC's WHOIS (tm) function, send it to 
mailserv@internic.net .....not to mailserv@rs.internic.net. My boo-boo, I'm
sorry. Just got a little happy with the fingers :)

OK, who went out to buy the Emplant (tm) yet? I really don't know why I would
want to get another platform to run on my Amiga...but it sure would impress
the friends eh? Really though, something like that would really open up the
doors. Didn't like the Amiga version of Wacky Space-out Warriors (tm)? Well 
get the MS-DOS (tm) version instead! Blamo! Now you got 30 trillion colors on
your screen! Not that you can see more than...what is it...somewhere between
1 and 500,000? I'm sure I'm close. But really...(I keep saying that) ...to
have a computer...that runs other computer software...all nice and neat, is
something worth-while. I was in a conference with someone last night...he
has another computer that isn't supported very well. Well he said something
like, "...if I'm going to fork so much more money on another computer...I 
want support" ...now if the concept of running, oh say, five or six
different computer systems on your Amiga (tm) is not supportive enough. Well, 
ya got an ego problem.

Remember that column that we were running in AR (?m) a while back...what was 
it called...."Tip of the Week (tm)"? Ever wonder why you haven't seen it 
lately? Me too! Well, I really can't say that you all are interested in "How 
to use the CLI(c?)" articles....but if you have any ideas about something you 
would like to see, shoot it my way. As I'm just be-fumbled on what to write 
about.

As you haven't noticed!

Well I'll let you go recuperate, but If I'm in a bind next week...

....well, we'll just have to do this again!

Subj: Florida Tourist Season


As some of you may know, the recent rash of tourist killings in 
Florida has resulting in the hiring of a Public Relations firm to 
try and keep the tourists coming.

Here is an advanced copy of one of their brochures.  Try and 
visualize it in the form of a glossy flyer, with lots of pictures 
of happy hunters enjoying the new sport.


                                   *****


                     Miami:  Big Game Hunters Paradise

Tired of hunting the big cats in Nairobi?  Can't get a permit for the Elk 
in Montana?  Bored with the lack of danger in the more traditional targets?  
Now you can hunt a big game that is just as dangerous as you, yet still easy 
to find.  Yes, you too can hunt the dreaded "Tourist Preditus".  And, best 
of all, hunting from your rental car is both legal and recommended.

As with any organized hunting expedition, there are a few rules to comply 
with.  The first, of course, is that your bag limit is four.  This is to 
ensure that enough big game is left for other visitors.  There is no season, 
and no difference between male and female predators.

Due to the presence of non-game species, and the difficulty of identifying 
the game from the non-game, a safari guide is highly recommended.  As a 
general rule, though, game animals are those that will be also hunting you, 
and can often be found in packs roving around other, non-hunting tourists.

One common hunting technique utilized by your game is that of "bumping" the 
prey gently with a car, then shooting and robbing the prey when it stops.  
This can be used to identify your game.  After allowing the "bumping" to cause 
you to stop, you can easily drop all of your game animals with a minimum of 
danger if you are using several hunters in a blind configured to look like a 
rental car.  Florida law, however, requires that the predator must get the 
first shot, so body armor is recommended for the driver and any front seat 
passengers.  

Taxidermy services are available for those who wish, although some countries 
may have restrictions on the import of your stuffed and mounted game.  As a 
general rule, the animals you will be hunting carry many forms of parasites, 
so proper disease control is important.  The recommended form of trophies are 
pictures, with souvenir necklaces made from the spent shell casing appealing 
to some hunters.

Florida law does have sever penalties for taking of non-predator species, so 
please ensure that your marksmanship is up to the task before hunting.  Your 
safari guide can provide other legal tips which may be needed.
