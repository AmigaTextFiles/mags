DESCRIPTION
<ul>
ShapeShifter is a multitasking shareware Macintosh-II emulator for
the Amiga computer. It allows to run Macintosh software concurrently
to Amiga applications without hardware add-ons or modifications.<p>
Some of the emulation's features:
<ul>
<li>Color display up to 256 colors on AGA Amigas (16 colors on ECS)
and up to 16,7 million colors on graphics cards (Picasso-II,
EGS, Merlin and CyBERgraphics cards are supported)
<li>No MMU required, even runs on A1200
<li>Macintosh hard disks can be simulated in Amiga files or Amiga
hard disk partitions
[unregistered version has no hard disk partition support]
<li>Can use Amiga floppy drives, serial, parallel and SCSI ports
from the Mac
[use of SCSI not possible in unregistered version]
<li>Mac HD disks can be read directly with an HD floppy drive,
Mac 800K disks cannot be read, Mac 720K disks, however, can
<li>Multichannel sound output and parallel-port sound digitizers
supported
<li>Access to Ethernet networks with MacTCP
<li>Text clipboard sharing between Mac and Amiga
<li>File handler to access Macintosh volumes from the Workbench
<li>Speed comparable to a real Mac with equivalent hardware
</ul>
The most important changes in V3.0:
<ul>
<li>The SCSI routines are more compatible (e.g. SCSIProbe and the
HDT drivers now run)
<li>You can select which floppy drives ShapeShifter will use as the
first and the second Macintosh drive
<li>You can select which volume to boot from
<li>The serial driver has been heavily improved and now supports
fully asynchronous transmission and has better support for
parallel devices
<li>Removed the bug that could make ShapeShifter crash when using
the "serial.device" from the Amiga side while the emulation was
running
<li>ShapeShifter now supports MacTCP with Ethernet cards
<li>The "Merlin" graphics card is now supported
<li>ShapeShifter can now display the Macintosh desktop in a window
on the Workbench
<li>On the 68040, the MMU is used to speed up the graphics refresh
<li>ShapeShifter runs on the 68060 and with VMM
</ul></ul>
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
<ul>
OS2.1, 68020 processor, 4MB of RAM, HD floppy drive recommended.
A copy of a Macintosh 512K or 1MB ROM and the Macintosh system
software are not included, but required. The ROM can be read off
of a real Mac by using a supplied program, the system software
can be bought from Apple. Note, however, that reading the ROM is
only legal if you have bought the ROMs or own a real Macintosh.
