DESCRIPTION
<ul>
`xpkdisk.device' is an exec-style device that looks like
trackdisk.device and similar disks. The difference is that it
compresses its data and stores it in multiple files in an existing
filesystem.  It uses the XPK (eXternal PacKer) standard to do the
actual compression.  This has many advantages.<p>
This aproach differs from compressing file systems: they compress
on a per-file basis, and generally limit the maximum size of files
that they can handle to the available memory.
</ul>
NEW FEATURES
<ul>
<li>Version 37.8 works around a horrible bug that is really caused by
XPK when track files are not compressible.  Look in the source
file "devio.c" for details, near the symbol XPKBUG.
<li>You can now change the XPKD: assign on the fly, if you're careful.
<li>xdClear now works with the fake scsi.device, which does not seem to
know about ETD_* commands.
<li>Now keeps the old track file while writing a new one. The old
track file is only deleted after successfully writing the new one.
You have more control about what to do in such situations.
</ul>
