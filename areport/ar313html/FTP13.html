DESCRIPTION
<ul>
EazyBBS is a Unix/Uucp-like BBS (Bulletin Board System) (aka Mailbox)
with UUCP network support for multiple users on multiple ports.<p>
Multi-language support for input, output and commands. Configurable
commands, online help for every command. Extremely fast VT102
emulation. Full-screen editor, full-screen input/output masks,
full-screen file lister, full-screen chat and line chat. Online games
(Greed, Sokoban, Global War).<p>
Z-Modem (xprzmodem.library) and X-Modem (builtin). Comfortable
Batch-Download and Batch-Upload. AmiNet-like .readme files
(containing file data) for upload and download. Also supports
those "brain-dead" FILE_ID.DIZ files.<p>
Thread-oriented message system. Binary mails. Personal newstree for
every user, automatically shows new messages and files in subscribed
boards and file-areas. Checks integrity of archives and lists contents
of archives (highly configurable). CRC checksums to verify correct
file transfer.<p>
Handles cursor-keys. Builtin support for "Umlaute", configurable
Umlaute conversion after upload and before download. Builtin pager,
users can edit their personal configuration easily.<p>
Commands, filenames, boards, file-areas can be abbreviated.
AmigaDOS pattern-matching for various commands.<p>
EazyBBS runs on own screen or in window (on any public screen).
Fonts configurable. No wimpy GUI, no fancy gadgets... everything's
done with VT102 masks (quite comfortable), perfect for remote
maintenance.<p>
Configurable for any modem, ISDN board and multi I/O card.<p>
Can be started from Uucp-getty (on already established connection).<p>
Access to boards and file-areas can be restricted to certain users
(Unix-like owner/group concept), every group may have one or more
moderators. Optionally, all upload may be unaccessable by default,
then checked by the moderators and unlocked (if okay).<p>
Very flexible import of peripherals (eg, CD-ROMs or any other
devices). Certain files and directories can be excluded.
Directories can be archived and transferred in one file (program
configurable, size check... configurable).<p>
EazyBBS is comfortable but has no full-blown GUI. If the Workbench
is your home and you even don't know how to spell the word "Shell"
then EazyBBS is maybe not for you. But if you can handle a shell
and if you like sophisticated software -- then you'll like EazyBBS ;)<p>
German support BBS with discussion boards, also available via UUCP.
