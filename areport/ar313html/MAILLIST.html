message ask nicely to be added to the list.</p>
ie: Please add me to the mailing list for Amiga Report magazine.  My

** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **<br>
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!             **<hr>

To circumvent the new pay-per-megabyte system for Australian Internet
communication, Paul Reece has been kind enough to set up an AUSTRALIAN-ONLY
mailing list, to save his fellow countrymen some money.</p>
You can join the list by sending mail to:   <a href="mailto:majordomo@info.tas.gov.au">majordomo@info.tas.gov.au</a> </p>
with the single line (in body of message):</p>
subscribe ar</p>
Amiga Report will then be bounced to you.
