MasterISO Copy</TITLE>

<BODY>
Paul Reeves of Asimware Innovations Inc.  recently announced that the
program NG-Master, a freely redistributable ISO 9660 CD-ROM mastering
package, was in fact merely a slightly modified version of Asimware's
MasterISO software, essentially only altered text strings.<p>

Mr.  Reeves sent AR a demo version of MasterISO and the NG-Master
distribution.  While we are not in a position to verify his claims with a
disassembly comparison (and such things are touchy issues), and we don't
even have the complete MasterISO distribution to compare with, rest assured
that we'll look into it.
