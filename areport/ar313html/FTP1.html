DESCRIPTION
<ul>
  WreadFiles is a vocal text file reader program for use on the

<ul>
<li>Text is read in sentences rather than lines.

<li>Corrected Pronunciation of some foreign names and expressions.

<li>Corrected Pronunciation of many abbreviations containing vowels.

<li>Expansion of many capitalized abbreviations. 

<li>Standard pronunciation of many multi-digit numbers. 

<li>ANSI color codes stripped from text displayed or spoken. 

<li>Ignores repeated characters. 

<li>Different voices for user interface and reading.<br>
  &lt;   Alternate voice for text delineated by brackets.<br>
  -&gt;  These brackets are often used to identify quoted text.       &lt;-<br>
  &lt;&lt;  Three basic types are supported.  Single or double brackets  &gt;&gt;<br>
  &gt;   may be forward or reverse, left side only or left and right. &lt;

<li>Single file or indexed multi-file read modes. 

<li>Run from Workbench or CLI. 

<li>Used with A1000 (OS 1.3), A3000 (OS 2.04-2.1), and A4000
      (OS 3.0)

<li>ASL file requester for input file selection for OS 2.04+.
</ul>
NEW FEATURES
<ul>
<li>Correcting vocabulary increased 20-25%.

<li>Alternate high-contrast color setup: white text on black
       background in addition to the normal black text on lavender
       green.

<li>Program icon tooltypes now enable user pre-selection of reading
       rate, color and full screen ASL file requester.
