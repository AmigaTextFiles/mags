REVIEW
<ul>
The Toaster Oven is essentially a tower case for Amiga 4000 computers.  To
assemble your 4000 Tower, you move all of the components from your desktop
4000 into the new Tower Case.  This encompasses moving the motherboard,
daughter card, hard drive(s), floppy drive(s), Zorro and PC cards, and the
Processor Card.  Additionally, the drive bay cover on the dektop's 3.5"
drive bay must be used on the Toaster Oven to cover its unused 3.5" drive
bay (unless, of course, you have another 3.5" device that must remain
uncovered).<p>
The 4000GT is apparently the interim replacement for the GT-4400 which has
been advertised (for quite some time, I might add) by Anti-Gravity in
North American Amiga magazines.  In fact, when I was first trying to order
the GT-4400, the salesperson didn't know what I was talking about.  He was
only familiar with the basic Toaster Oven model and didn't realize that
his company had been advertising the GT-4400 for months.  (The GT-4400 was
a larger version of the basic Toaster Oven with more drive bays and a more
powerful Power Supply Unit).  Upon trying to place an order for this unit,
I was met with several delays.  Granted, Anti-Gravity never committed to a
shipping date although I was told more than once that it "should" be ready
next week.  I was not too upset over the delays, but I would think twice
before ordering something from Anti-Gravity that I needed in a hurry.  (As
a side note, I had ordered two units as I was working for an Amiga dealer
at the time; ie.  I had ordered them as a dealer, not as a consumer.)
Eventually, I was told that they could finally ship a model called the
4000GT, which was "essentially" the same thing.<p>
Let me start off by stating that this unit is HUGE.  It is all metal (not
plastic) and it measures 2.5 feet tall by 9 inches wide by 20 inches deep.
The unit comes with casters but I chose not to install them.  They would
have added about 2 inches to the height of the unit.  On the front, there
is room for 2 half-height 3.5" drives and 5 half-height 5.25" drives.  A
removable metal door covers these bays.  Internally, there is room for 11
(eleven!) half-height 5.25" drives (they mount on their sides).  That's a
lot of bays (and the main reason why I spent the big bucks for this unit).
The base unit comes with a pitiful 250 watt power supply.  When you're
talking about putting several 9 GB A/V drives in this Tower, a 250 watt
PSU is rather puny.  I was expecting a 400 watt PSU like I had tried to
order (the specs for the GT-4400 had it listed as standard).  Because I
didn't get the EXACT specifications for the new 4000GT (I assumed they
were virtually identical to the GT-4400), I wasn't aware that a 250 watt
PSU was standard.  I can't put the blame entirely on Anti-Gravity for this
one, although selling this large a tower with anything less than a 400
watt PSU does not make sense to me.  A large fan is located on the front
inside of the unit (like the 3000T, only much larger) in addition to the
fan of the Power Supply.  The much advertised "Big Ethyl Sisterboard"
never did make it into this unit (I knew this when I ordered it, however,
so it was no surprise).<p>
Included with the unit is a different sisterboard, which allows you to add
6 cards that fit into a PC XT slot.  These slots do not provide any
communication to the computer - they are powered slots only.  They are
meant for such cards as TBC's and other assorted video-related cards.  The
advantage here is that these slots are isolated from the Zorro slots.  The
sisterboard also contains the new video slot.  This relocates video cards
(such as the Toaster) so they are no longer in-line with a Zorro slot.<p>
The assembly of the ToasterOven proceeded as follows:
<ol>
<li>Disassemble desktop 4000.  Completely.  Unscrew and unplug everything.
<li>Secure motherboard to ToasterOven chassis.  The motherboard is mounted
vertically, with the Mouse ports facing straight down.  Two internal
cables are provided to re-route the mouse ports to the back of the
chassis.  This places the mouse ports above the serial port.
<li>Secure processor card (in my case a Warp Engine) and attach all
motherboard cables (IDE, Floppy, SCSI, Motherboard Power, Keyboard Lock
Jumper, LED jumpers)
<li>Attach provided "sister board" to second level "daughterboard
platform" (a sheet metal plate).  This platform is secured about 3 inches
from the motherboard.  Once the platform is secured to the chassis,
getting at the motherboard is a real pain.  If you want to have an
external connector for your SCSI port, it would be a good idea to install
it BEFORE securing this platform.  Also, pulling the sisterboard power
cable through the large slot in the platform should be done now.
<li>Install provided daughtercard extender.  This relocates the CBM
daughtercard to the same platform as mentioned is step four (the
daughtercard lies alongside the sisterboard).  From here, two small ribbon
cables relocate the video slot to the sister board.  By doing this, the
Zorro slot that is in-line with the video slot becomes available.  And if
you have a Video Toaster, the adjoining Zorro slot is also freed up. 
Confused yet?
<li>Install drives (floppy, hard disk, CD-ROM, etc.).  Actually, I found
that it made more sense to install all the drives FIRST.  Because of the
way the the internal drive bays are arranged, drives are easier to secure
if they are done first.  Otherwise, the daugherboard platform gets in the
way.
<li>Install Zorro/PC cards.  I found this to be very aggrevating.  The
daughtercard platform is too far away from the side of the chassis that
you install the cards on.  This results in cards not being seated
properly.  The cards do not make good contact and are prone to popping
out.  This can be remedied with the skillful use of a round file.  There
is a card bracket (the piece of metal where you actually screw your
expansion cards into) which is held in place by screws.  If you use a file
to enlarge the screw holes just a little bit, you can move the bracket a
fraction of an inch closer to the daughtercard platform.  Expansion cards
will now fit better.
</ol>
The kit was fairly complete, but it needed more than a little work to make
things fit properly.  First, the drive bay that is intended for the floppy
drive does not have the screw holes drilled in the right position.  You
must drill four new holes through the sheet metal so that you can position
and secure your floppy drive properly.  Additionally, the large fan in one
of the 4000GTs made a horrible whine as it resonated against the chassis.
I remedied this by placing rubber foam between the fan and the chassis (an
hour-long operation due to the way the fan is secured to the chassis).
The other unit did not exhibit this problem.  The ToasterOven 4000GT came
with all the screws I needed and most of the extension cables.  You will
have to fabricate your own hard drive activity LED cable and your own
Keyboard Lock cable, however (the cables from the desktop are too short).
And if you're like me and installed all of your Video Toaster Flyer hard
drives inside the case, you'll need to have custom SCSI cables made.<p>

This unit did not come with an LED display either.  There was a spot on
the front of the unit for it, but it just wasn't included.
</ul>
DOCUMENTATION
<ul>
A seven page manual details how to put everything together.  It is
sufficient, but hardly a professional job.  There are several diagrams
which help, but there are too few that illustrate "how" to do something. 
Many intricate details are lacking and the user must examine things
carefully before proceeding.  For the amount of money I paid for the
4000GT, this manual should have been many times better.
</ul>
LIKES
<ul>
I like the fact that I can put everything inside of this box.  It is big
and sturdy.  The option to put casters on the unit is also nice.  Extra
holes are provided on the back of the chassis to allow for external
connectors (SCSI ports, other I/O ports).  When closed, the small metal
door muffles the sound of the fan and makes things a little less noisy.
</ul>
DISLIKES
<ul>
One thing that was particularly disappointing about the unit was the lack
of an LED display.  Yes, I know they are fairly useless but there was a big
gaping hole where it was supposed to go.  The transparent red plastic cover
was provided, however (cute, but I was not impressed).  A minor complaint
is the organization of everything.  Many screws are in positions that are
near impossible to get to (how did they get there in the first place?).
However, I have yet to see a case that was completely accessable.  The 250
watt PSU is a real bummer, too.  Make sure that you order the PSU that you
want.  And have a drill and metal file handy when you assemble the 4000GT.
For a unit that cost this much money, it should have been done better.
Paying $1150 US for a CASE is insane enough without having to drill holes
in it.
</ul>
COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS
<ul>
The only other product that I have seen in this same category is the
Commodore-made Amiga 4000T.  The A4000T has an extra Zorro slot (for a
total of 5) and 2 video slots, which is nice.  However, the A4000T doesn't
have anywhere near the storage capacity of the ToasterOven 4000GT.  
Additionally, adding a Video Toaster to the A4000T covers up BOTH video
slots (and their in-line Zorro slots).  This is not the case with the
4000GT, which seperates the video slot from the Zorro slots.  Also, adding
an accelerator card to the A4000T is difficult as a drive platform covers
the processor slot.  I had to cut a hole in this platform in order to fit a
Warp Engine into an A4000T.  There is plenty of room in the ToasterOven for
a processor card, and no cutting is required.  I have heard about a new
Tower case by a different manufacturer which provides 7 Zorro slots.   As
far as I'm concerned, you can never have too many Zorro slots.
</ul>
WARRANTY
<ul>
There is a one-year warranty on all electronic components.
</ul>
CONCLUSIONS
<ul>
If you want to have your Flyer system completely enclosed in one box (and
have fairly deep pockets), the 4000GT is for you.  It has its problems,
but I for one am quite (though not 100%) satisfied with it.
