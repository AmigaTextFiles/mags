DESCRIPTION
<ul>
plip.device is a SANA-II compliant (internal) parallel port 
network interface driver - this version is a bug fix described in 
the New Features section, someone who tested this for me suggested
it made a 25% speed increase which I doubt since I haven't done
anything to that part of the code, except compile with SAS/C 
6.55, and I suspect they upgraded from an old(er than 38.11) 
version of plip.device but this is unknown, if you observe a 
speed increase due to this version of plip.device please post in 
comp.sys.amiga.networking.
</ul>
NEW FEATURES
<ul>
S2_DEVICEQUERY command now respects the correct usage of the 
SizeAvailable & SizeSupplied fields of the Sana2DeviceQuery 
structure passed to the S2_DEVICEQUERY command.
</ul>
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
<ul>
A working internal parallel port, cable made as described in the
docs and a SANA-II compliant Networking Package such as Envoy.

PRICE, DISTRIBUTABILITY & OTHER LEGAL STUFF
<ul>
While Oliver & Michael were supporting plip.device it was 
considered Shareware but I (and someone else I know working on 
plip.device) have tried mailing both of them without success. 
They have also released the source to Aminet so I guess they've 
placed it in the Public Domain (I remember one of them talking 
about releasing it under a GNU license while the ADSP network was
alive).<p>
