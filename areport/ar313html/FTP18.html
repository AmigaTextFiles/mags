DESCRIPTION
<ul>
BBSwitch is an electronic monitor switch designed to allow an
A2386SX BridgeBoard, equiped with a VGA card, and an AMIGA to
share a monitor. Actually, BBSwitch is an AmigaGuide document
describing an electronic monitor switch (ie. how it works,
how to build one, etc...).<p>
The switch is controlled by the 4 pin mini din connector of
the BridgeBoard and is fully compatible with the SXServ
software written by Frank Mariak.<p>
Although it was designed to be connected to an A2386SX, it can
also be used with other devices if you can provide an interface
similar to the A2386SX (a +5V power supply and a TTL compatible
signal) and write the software for it.
