<h2>Review: Aminet 6 CD-ROM</h2>
<h3>By:  <a href="JASON.html">Jason Compton</a><hr></h3>

Hard to argue with running success.  The Aminet collection of CD-ROMs, up
until now a quarterly phenomenon, are going bimonthly.  Aminet itself is
doing the largest volumes of new software and downloads as it has in its
history-enough to prompt the North American site, <a href="ftp://ftp.netnet.net/pub/aminet/">ftp.netnet.net</a>, to pick
up the aliases <a href="ftp://aminet.com/">aminet.com</a> and <a href="ftp://aminet.org/">aminet.org</a> for convenience.  Hey, at least
some sectors of the Amiga market are doing well.<p>

Aminet 6, dated June 1995, is a 634 meg collection of "the newest, the
best, and all the demos" of Aminet, as well as a licensed copy of all Amiga
Report issues up to and including AR3.08 and the auction issue.  (Yes,
licensed.  We really make people license these compilations.)<p>

The comfy AmigaGuide interface is back, with just about everything
ready-to-run (even most of the demos worked properly straight from the
interface, which is pretty rare for demos).  A search tool for Amiga Report
articles (those in AmigaGuide format, meaning all but the first 13 issues)
is included, which is quite useful for me when I need to look up old
reviews to figure out what it was I said.<p>

The mod collection is particularly enjoyable this time around, with the
usual shuffle feature for random selection, and a quick rating system from
Urban.  Hopefully, the new Aminet ratings system will give a more
objective viewpoint, saving Urban from having to condemn or endorse all of
the mods on the disc.<p>

Quick access is provided for the collection of games and pictures on the
disc, many of which are excellent.<p>

With the policy of providing free CDs for contributors (i.e. those whose
files are on Aminet), the still-low price of 25DM (roughly US$19-$20), and
the complete Amiga Report archive...I have a hard time seeing how anybody
could be displeased with Aminet 6.<p>
