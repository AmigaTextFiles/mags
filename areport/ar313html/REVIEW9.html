<h2>Review: The Music Maker By John McDonough</h2>
<h3>By:  <a href="JASON.html">Jason Compton</a><hr></h3>

MOD compilation CD-ROMs are a dime a dozen.  And that's not a bad thing, if
you like a lot of MODs.<p>

MOD collections on audio CD are considerably more rare.  They're wonderful
if you want to take, say, your favorite Sidewinder MODs with you on the go,
or to capture the pleasantly eclectic variety on The Best of the Amiga
Scene CD.<p>

And then there's a totally new sort of fish-The Music Maker, a CD from the
fledgeling Laughing Cat Records and New Age artist John McDonough.<p>

Forget everything you're used to in a MOD CD...because The Music Maker
isn't.  MIDI composed on the Amiga, McDonough has created what seems to be
the first Contemporary New Age collection authored on our favorite machine.<p>

For those of you as unfamiliar with the genre as I am, suffice it to say
that the music is totally instrumental, heavy on piano/keyboard, and fairly
low-key.  It won't make you run out and crusade for world peace, mind you,
but it also won't give you a pounding headache.<p>

From the first, title track through to the tenth (Wind of the Spirit),
McDonough creates a smooth flow of sound that seems to fly by.  No song
becomes "tiresome", tempting you to hit the fast forward button.  Most
importantly, it doesn't sound like "fake music."<p>

I'm impressed.  The sound quality is superb, the track selection excellent,
the overall effect moving without being sappy or overpowering.  I hope this
is not the last showing we see from McDonough and Laughing Cat.<p>
