Hello!<p>
The official FTP server to get ShapeShifter updates and additional
utilities from is now<p>
<ul>
<a href="ftp://server.biologie.uni-erlangen.de">server.biologie.uni-erlangen.de</a>  (131.188.170.4)<p>
</ul>
It will always carry the latest version (V3.0b at the moment) as soon as it
comes out and you will find other useful things there such as Mac printer
drivers for Epson and DeskJet compatible printers.<p>
The Mac stuff on this server will be BinHex4 (.hqx) encoded.  Mac FTP tools
should be able to decode this automatically, otherwise you may use "StuffIt
Expander", "Compact Pro" or a similar program.<p>
Questions regarding the management and network part of this server should
be directed to Carsten Melberg &lt;<a href="mailto:cnmelber@biologie.uni-erlangen.de">cnmelber@biologie.uni-erlangen.de</a>&gt;.<p>
And, yes, the <a href="http://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/misc/emu/ShapeUpd3_0b.lha">V3.0b update</a> is now out. The changes to V3.0 include:
<ul>
<li>DeviceDisk drivers are opened with a flag value of zero (instead of
TDF_ALLOW_NON_3_5)
<li>1MB ROMs now work in 24 bit address space
<li>ShapeShifter now works without FPU (ooops...)
<li>Processor exceptions occuring on the Mac side are intercepted
<li>In case of an error on startup, the Mac screen is always closed
<li>Floppy disks inserted before the emulation started weren't checked
for HD/DD
</ul>
Bye,<br>
Christian<p>
