<h2>Review: Magic Illusions CD-ROM</h2>
<h3>By:  <a href="JASON.html">Jason Compton</a><hr></h3>

Stefan Ossowski's Schatztruhe has become quite an important Amiga
publisher.  With the flagship of the Aminet CD-ROM set, the Schatztruhe
also publishes TurboCalc 2.0 and a slew of other CD-ROMs.  Many of these
have been reviewed in AR, and, for the most part, we've been very
supportive.<p>

Even The Beauty of Chaos, perhaps a slightly overindulgent work from a pair
of fractal fans, was tolerable.  But I think Magic Illusions comes
dangerously close to the line of being ridiculous.<p>

It is a collection of over 200 stereograms in IFF, BMP, and GIF format, in
three resolutions.  (320x240, 640x480, 1024x768)  Tools are included to
create your own.<p>

<a href="http://cswww2.essex.ac.uk/users/malldx/magiceye.html">Stereograms</a>, for those of you who have missed the trend, are pictures that
have been altered by an algorythm to look like a pile of garbage but, when
stared at <a href="http://cswww2.essex.ac.uk/users/malldx/Magiceye/cani.html">correctly</a>, produce a 3D illusion of the object under that pile of
garbage.<p>

Mathematical and physical justification and explanation of the phenomenon
is included, in both German and English (although some words slipped by the
translators).<p>

I suppose I should come out and admit that I have a very difficult time
seeing stereograms.  That being said...<p>

Isn't this a bit much?  Granted, I'd rather buy a CD with 200 stereogram
images than a book of 50, but if I had my choice I wouldn't buy either.<p>

For true fans of the genre-and I mean FANS-I suppose it's a must-have.  But
for the rest of the world...I just don't see the allure.<p>
