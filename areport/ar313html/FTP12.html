DESCRIPTION
<ul>
HTML-Heaven is a suite of _four_ programs intended to make the
creation and maintenance of WWW (HTML) pages easy. The programs
in the suite interface with your favorite editor (providing it 
supports text insertion via ARexx) to provide you with a very
comfortable environment. Now inserting HTML commands is as simple
as point and click. This is the upgrade from version 1.1 with a
host of exiting new features.
</ul>
NEW FEATURES
<ul>
Version 1.1a has all the features of version 1.1. Plus:
<ul><li>Support for two new editors. MEmacs (thanks to Ellis Pritchard)
and PolyEd.
<li>Improved script for GoldEd now supports blocks the same way that
the TTX script does. Same goes for the PolyEd and SE scripts.
<li>Just mark a block and hit eg. the &lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt; gadget in HTML-Heaven.  
<li>Support for character entities so you can now embed special 
characters like ®, æ and þ for example.
<li>The brunt of the new NetScape extensions to the HTML language. 
<li>The documentation is now also included in HTML format.

</ul>
OTHER
<ul>
To encourage users to register, (I'd like to get some return for
all this effort I have put into creating the suite.) the freely
distributable versions does not support ToolTypes/parameters and
will not supply on-line help. Furthermore a 'reminder' requester
appears on exiting any of the four programs comprising the suite.
The unregistered versions will also not allow more than 5 ARexx
commands per session. They'll keep functioning, but ignore any
further ARexx commands given by the user as it has unloaded it's
ARexx Host.
