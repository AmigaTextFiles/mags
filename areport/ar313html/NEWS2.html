It seems that two Amiga developers have been hit by the same brainstorm.
Scott Ferrero (<a href="mailto:sferrero@enterprise.powerup.com.au">sferrero@enterprise.powerup.com.au</a>) and Jens Schoenfeld
(<a href="mailto:sysop@nostlgic.tng.oche.de">sysop@nostlgic.tng.oche.de</a>) have both been working on a DCTV-style Amiga
attachment designed to bring a low-cost chunky graphics mode or two to the
aging Amiga graphics system.<p>

The most obvious application would be towards "texture-mapping" games such
as Doom, however both have grander plans for their as yet unreleased
devices.<p>

Mr. Ferrero has been keeping me up to date on their independent progress,
and they are now considering joining forces.  Watch this space.
