<h2>Review: Cybergames By Cyberpunk Developments</h2>
<h3>By:  <a href="JASON.html">Jason Compton</a><hr></h3>
Anybody remember Barbarian?  It was a C-64 game that involved two players
hacking, slashing, and cutting off each other's head.<p>

Barbarian, meet the 90s.  Cybergames is a battle-duel type game of the
Barbarian/Mortal Kombat/etc. etc. genre, two players on a two-dimensional
profile field beating the hell out of each other.<p>

Important to note is that now it's the 90s and you can't really expect to
get through the whole game with the same weapon, as you might have years
ago in Barbarian.  Now, the object is to beat the hell out of your
opponent, preferably with fairly difficult moves like kicks and body cuts,
to earn money to buy better weaponry and...body parts.<p>

Yes, the "Cyber" in Cybergames means you're in a William Gibsonish future
world in which body parts are readily exchanged for cybernetic
improvements.  If all goes well, you'll go from a guy in a loincloth with a
wimpy sword to a chrome monster with an electric field mace-ish thing by
the end of the game.<p>

Because the Cybergames are a long series of duels in which you try to
become the champion by beating the hell out of a few dozen computer
opponents (you can also duel against a friend indefinately).  Each opponent
comes with a picture (that looks to be in the obscure PCHG format, but
don't quote me) and a little blurb, like "Kill..." to tune you in to their
"personality".<p>

Unfortunately, you see an awful lot of totally robotic opponents with only
"Silent" to say, and pretty much everyone fights the same, other than
having different weaponry and body parts.<p>

Falling objects like pools of fire and proximity mines, as well as a set of
climbing bars overhead from which you can kick your opponent, give the old
format enough of a boost to keep the concept fresh, as do the missile
weapons you can buy and fire at your opponent.<p>

It's a pity that the control system is so unpredictable-combinations of
moves are certainly possible, but the program seems to have a difficult
time reconciling a held fire button, leaving you to click away in
frustration as you get your head cut off for failing to finish off the
other guy.<p>

The graphics are colorful enough for ECS, but the animation leaves a bit to
be desired in the "fluid" category.  These guys don't really walk like
people do.<p>

I have a lot on my wish list for Cybergames.  As it stands, it is an
excellent sucessor to the Barbarian line, and while only having the stock
finishing move of the severed head (which, by the way, is quite
entertaining) might even attract a dedicated fan of the Mortal Kombat line.<p>

Cybergames is "PAL and sort of NTSC", meaning that for the full screen
display you should really use PAL, but NTSC is acceptable for playing.<p>

Cybergames is pretty much a shareware steal at $15, and a demo is available
from Aminet, in <a href="http://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/game/misc/cybergames.lha">game/misc</a>.<p>
