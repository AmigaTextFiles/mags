DESCRIPTION
<ul>
Icons in isometric style a la NewIcons. A set of IFF pictures that can be 
used to create icons in the style of the "NewIcons" package. Various 
elements from the pictures can be combined to create an icon to suit your 
personal preferences. Examples (in IFF format) of all common icons are 
provided.(SYS: icons) All icons are a standard size and format, to give 
their final appearance on the Workbench a neat and organized look. No more 
cluttered screens and windows and no more massive, gaudy icons. The icons 
images can be picked up from the IFF pictures as IFF brushes, and then 
imported into your favorite icon editor, and the icons created from there.<p>
A few screen grabs have been included to show off the "isoicons".<p>
What makes this package different?<p>
This is the only package, that I know of, that allows the you to construct 
your own icons from the "clip art" provided. Also ALL the images are in IFF
picture format and can be edited and created using the power of a paint 
program like DPaint or Brilliance. (This way you won't have to put up with 
using icon editors like the terrible IconEd program from Workbench 2.0+. 
:-() <p>
The imagery only uses the first 4 colors on a 16-color picture, so
more colors can be used in the icons. That is better than working with
a 8- or 16-color icon from somewhere else and then losing most of the 
visual detail when reducing the palette to suite your Workbench. :-(
