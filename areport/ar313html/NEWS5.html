In Motorola's quarterly PowerPC report, Escom is listed in a crowd of about
75 companies as one using the PowerPC chip.<p>

Mind you, this is not proof-positive that Amiga Technologies will use the
PowerPC.  But it is an indicator that there has been some sort of
communication between the two parties, and that can't be bad.<p>
