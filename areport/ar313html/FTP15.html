DESCRIPTION
<ul>
Easy-to-use file copier with GUI. Good for copying a bunch of
files from a harddisk to floppy disks, as it figures out which
files will fit and only copies those files. If more disks are
required, you will be prompted for them.
Should support any type of disk device (including diskspare
and PFS).<br>
Similar programs are available, but (as far as I know) the don't
have a GUI.
</ul>
NEW FEATURES
<ul>
This is a bug-fix to version 1.4. Version 1.4 kept a lock on
the screen on which the window opened, making the public
screen feature totally useless.<p>
This version is also nearly 1 kb smaller that v1.4.
</ul>
