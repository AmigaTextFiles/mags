DESCRIPTION
<ul>
Analay is a new analysis program which provides all the standard
functions such a program needs. The special feature of this
program is the integrated DTP mode which allows you to layout
a page with full WYSIWYG! The program is divided into two
independent parts running at the same time as separate tasks.<p>
The Math Mode contains all functions for plotting and analyzing
function graphs. It's no problem to create the derivative of
functions or to calculate the zeros or the area between functions
to name only three of the many facilities. Moreover, the design of
the graphs can be changed in many ways. You also can place texts,
points, etc. in the windows or hatch an area. Tables, lists and
legends can be created as well.<p>
The Layout Mode contains a small, but complete DTP program with
full WYSIWYG and Intellifont support! It allows you to layout
a page with function graphs, tables, lists, legends, text blocks,
etc. Moreover, it knows formulas which no program apart form TeX
was able to display or print up to know! The page can be printed
in the highest resolution your Workbench printer driver allows
for your printer!
