Dear CEI Dealers:<p>

Good news as promised!  The Amiga 4000T will be the first machine to be
available.  New models will follow shortly thereafter.  In North America,
Amiga Technologies GmbH is concentrating on the high end desktop video
market first.   CEI is assisting Amiga Technologies in various aspects of
creative marketing and product development. <p>

The Amiga 4000T will be a tower based model with the Motorola 68040
processor operating at 25Mhz.  Initial configurations are expected to be
6MBs of Ram and 540MB hard disk.  Introductory pricing is set for a street
price of $3499.00 CEI will be offering different configurations including
complete Flyer workstations ready to plug and play. <p>

Everything that is humanly and legally possible to maintain the dealers
profit margins will be done.  Our goal is to make all dealers profitable. 
We will be instituting a number of programs that will reward dealers that
maintain high service standards, local customer support and proper profit
margins. <p>

Enclosed (BY MAIL) you will find our new dealer application, dealer
contract, credit application and forecast sheet.  CEI is reinstituting
credit terms to those that qualify.  Machines will only be available to
those that return the completed forms.  If you assume that because you
purchased from us in the past you do not need to fill out the new
applications, you are mistaken.  A new marketing campaign with dealer
referral service is being instituted and without the applications you will
be left off. <p>

We realize that the price of the Amiga 4000T is slightly higher than we all
would have wished.  At the same token there is pent up market demand and
the A4000T/FLYER combo is still unbeatable. <p>

The number of computers built will be determined by the number of completed
dealer applications and your forecasts.  Please fax the forecast as soon as
possible.  Mail the other forms to our address above. <p>

We are quite excited about the Amiga's long term prospects.  During the
coming months, you will see a number of announcements that will regain our
dominance in the multimedia markets. <p>

Sincerely,<p>

Alex Amor
