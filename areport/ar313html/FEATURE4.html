VisCorp Overview<p>

VisCorp is an Illinois corporation with offices in Chicago and engineering
facilities in Westchester, Pennsylvania and in the Silicon Valley area of
California.<p>

VisCorp has developed a unique interactive set-top device (trademarked
"ED") that enables a host of new interactive services that can be
delivered over existing cable or even telephone systems, without the
necessity for new and highly expensive hybrid fiber/coaxial broadband
plant.  This new platform is designed to be low cost and enables the
television set to act much like a modem-equipped computer with all
functions being controlled by a familiar hand-held remote control.<p>

The ED provides unique telephone management features, on-screen TV program
guides, fax and e-mail, Internet access, and the ability to down-load and
play arcade quality video games right on the TV.  With a non-technical and
friendly front-of-screen experience and a target retail price of about
$300, ED will make the information superhighway accessible to the mass
market.  Business Case<p>

On-line services are growing rapidly.  By some estimates access to the
Internet is growing at a rate as high as 20% per month and is expected to
top 100 million users world-wide by the end of 19961.  Many cable and
telephone companies are launching trials of broadband video-on-demand
interactive technologies.<p>

However modem-equipped personal computers are still priced well out of the
reach of many families and their complexity remains daunting to others. 
Interactive television technology to support full motion video-on-demand
is still extremely expensive with most digital set-tops being priced in
excess of $1,000.  Further, in order to deliver compelling programming,
such set-tops must be backed-up by tens of millions of dollars in
telecommunications infrastructure upgrades including ATM switching systems
and powerful digital servers in each market.<p>

It is VisCorp's belief that there is a market opportunity to provide
revenue producing interactive services to the mass market that do not
involve deployment of such technologies and which are far cheaper and
easier to use than the typical PC.<p>

To do this, VisCorp has designed a set-top appliance that uses a highly
efficient design and operating system that greatly reduces the amount of
memory needed to manipulate video images on the TV.  Memory is the one
irreducible cost in digital electronics, and by reducing a dependence on
memory, VisCorp has brought the cost of the device down to where it can
penetrate the mass market.<p>

VisCorp intends to license consumer electronics manufacturers and
distributors to produce the hardware and market it to consumers.  VisCorp
has had preliminary discussions with several manufacturers, including
Pioneer, Zenith, Toshiba and Freedom Star.  Unless offered a substantial
up-front exclusive royalty, VisCorp intends to provide as many
manufacturers as possible with the right to use the technology. <p>

VisCorp expects to get only a relatively low revenue stream from this
manufacturing licenses, and instead plans to receive substantially all of
its revenue from the variety of services it intends to make available
through the ED.  The nominal licensing fee is designed to encourage a
low-priced device to be offered with the expectation of greater acceptance
by consumers and a level of market penetration that will permit the use of
the ED as a new electronic publishing platform.<p>

While the ED will be an open system and, in theory, any application
developer can write for it, the ability to develop applications to run in
the reduced memory environment of the ED is not widely available.
Consequently, VisCorp's intimate knowledge of the operating system is
expected to enable it to get to market sooner with more compelling
programming than any emergent competition.<p>

As this happens, product marketing on this new medium will grow
explosively.  Whether the consumer is looking for a movie, an interactive
game, a house, a sweater, a particular kitchen appliance, or simply
information about a vacation destination, he or she will need the ability
to either quickly locate a specific product or service or to have fun
browsing selections while looking for an impulse purchase opportunity. <p>

<h3>The ED Interactive Set-Top</h3><p>

The Company's initial hardware product, the ED, is an electronic device
designed to be placed on top of - or next to - a television set.  The ED
is designed to permit consumers to perform a variety of functions and
utilize a number of on-line interactive services which the Company expects
to make available in the future, including video games, home shopping,
educational programs and fax capability.  To the extent these services are
currently available to consumers they are not available except on office
devices and personal computers.  The ED can be marketed for a small
fraction of the cost of such devices and also can support entirely new
capabilities such as advanced telephone management. <p>

The ED is essentially a highly cost-optimized computer with a graphical,
simple-to-use interface which can be remotely configured from a host
operating system.  It comes equipped with a modem, video and audio
circuitry and a controller.  The ED is connected to an ordinary telephone
line and uses the consumer's standard television set as a monitor.  ED can
present text and graphics on a television set using specially configured
fonts so that it is readable at normal viewing distances.  The ED can also
overlay graphics and text on the television picture or bring up a solid
background to facilitate information viewing.<p>

The ED converts the consumer's television set into a high-quality duplex
speaker phone with one-touch on-screen dialing so that calls may be placed
from the living room couch with the remote control.  In locations where
caller ID is available, ED scans the incoming call and checks the number
against a database.  If it recognizes the number, ED scrolls the name of
the incoming caller across the TV picture and the viewer may answer the
call and speak to the person with a flick of the remote control.<p>

Included on the ED is a magnetic card stripe reader so that credit or
debit cards may be swiped to confirm transactions and debit cards may be
"filled" with electronic funds drawn on the consumer's bank.  Some of the
other features that the Company has implemented and intends to provide
through the ED are:<p>
<ul>
<li>a user-friendly interface to the Internet including a Web Browser,
<li>a linking mechanism to allow multiple users in different homes to play
  the same video games, competing in real time,
<li>in-home gaming and wagering,
<li>a voice bulletin board on the Internet,
<li>one-touch remote dialing of 800 numbers for reservations, hotel booking
  etc,
<li>one-touch dialing of home delivery and catalog shopping services,
<li>classified and "Yellow Pages" type advertising,
<li>guides to restaurants and other entertainment,
<li>statistics gathering programs to track consumer TV viewing patterns and
  usage of the of specific interactive services,
<li>a complete transaction processing, tracking and billing mechanism,
<li>distribution of electronic coupons,
<li>electronic banking including secure encryption and the ability to "fill"
  debit cards,
<li>various specialized applications for the hospitality and health care
  industries.

<h3>Company Background</h3><p>

The Company was formed in Chicago, Illinois on May 1, 1990 under the name
Information on Command, Inc.  The Company changed its name to Visual
Information Service Corp.  on May 22, 1990.  The Company has a limited
history of operations.  The principals of the Company began developing the
ED technology in 1990 and first produced a prototype in May 1993.  In
November 1994, the Company hired its current managment team and in
December 1994, the Company established a relationship with its first
interactive service provider, NTN Communications, Inc.  In May 1995, the
Company licensed the rights to the former Commodore Amiga technology, now
owned by ESCOM AG of Germany.  By incorporating elements of the efficient
Amiga chip-set and operating system into the ED box, the Company believes
it can reduce manufacturing costs and also enable the ED box to utilize
the vast library of exiting Amiga software, particularly arcade quality
video games.<p>

The Company has not yet begun manufacturing the ED (other than a small
number of prototypes) and is conducting a six-month market trial in
conjunction with focus group studies of the ED in up to 25 homes on a
cable system in a Detroit suburb.  After completion of this study and
after making further refinements and modifications to the ED, VisCorp
plans to begin manufacturing and mass marketing the ED during early 1996.<p>
