Title: JPEGonDCTV v1.01<p>

Author: Nicolas Dade / n9rzb / <a href="mailto:nicolas-dade@uiuc.edu">nicolas-dade@uiuc.edu</a><p>

Hardware: DCTV Display Device<p>

Cost: Not stated in the doc file.  Nicolas has put in a copyright
statement, but no Freeware/Shareware type statement.<p>

   Jpeg compression is latest and greatest way to go for pictures.  It has
many advantages over other formats.  The file size is the most noticeable,
and it is very portable.  Amiga, MS/DOS and Mac users can view them without
any conversion.  It seems that there is finally a standard that everybody
likes.<p>

   On the Amiga, the best choice for a jpeg viewer that I have found is
FJPEG.  I have been told that it does a wonderful job viewing jpeg images
on an AGA machine in HAM8.  Unfortunately, on ECS machines, it displays in
HAM6.  While this would be fine for most people, I own a DCTV unit that
just sits on the table while I view jpeg files in HAM6.  :-(<p>

   Recently, I was browsing though the Aminet looking for the new version
of FastView, when I seen <a href="http://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/gfx/show/JPEGonDCTV100.lha">JPEGonDCTV100.lha</a>.  Since then, my Jpeg viewing
has been a much happier experience.<p>

On the up side:<p>

   This program is fast!  Faster than FastView, FastJpeg and ViewTek!   And
of course, DCTV looks MUCH better than HAM6.<p>

On the down side:<p>

   Version 1.01 is a CLI only application and only will view one file at a
time.  I have overcome this by using SPAT.  The following line in my
S:Shell-Startup makes things go real smooth.<p>

Alias s "spat jpegondctv []#? nolace 3planes"<p>

  The above line allows me to just type "s pat" where "pat" = any pattern
for multiple files and views them on a 3 plane non-interlaced screen for
speed.<p>

   Hopefully, the next version will support multiple files.  It would be
very nice to configure it in Dopus filetypes.  :-)<p>
