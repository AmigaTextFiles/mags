<h2>Review: Maxdos 2.5 By Media4 Productions</h2>
<h3>By:  <a href="JASON.html">Jason Compton</a><hr></h3>

I've been around the MaxDOS bend before, in a comparison review between
MaxDos 2.0 and <a href="http://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/misc/emu/CrossMAC_Demo.lha">CrossMac</a> in...&lt;searching Aminet 6 for keyword "MaxDOS"&gt;...
<a href="http://www.omnipresence.com/Amiga/News/AR/ar232_Sections/MAIN.HTML">Amiga Report 2.32</a>.<p>

At that time, I pointed out that both MaxDOS and CrossMac did the job of
providing a transparent Mac filesystem for the Amiga.  CrossMac just did it
prettier, with more support tools.<p>

No longer.  <a href="http://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/disk/misc/MaxDOS25Demo.lha">MaxDOS 2.5</a> adds the sort of goodies CrossMac offered, including
icon display (black and white for both of them, unfortunately), resource
extractors, file type modification, and relatively straightforward
assignment of AmigaDOS file types to Mac programs.<p>

The solid Mounter, for creating and using Mac partitions, still exists.  It
has stabilized (it would crash on one of my Mac partitions, for reasons not
even Media4 could ever pin down), and is still very easy to use.  Once
you're up and running, there's your Mac filesystem, complete with data and
resource fork idiosyncracies.<p>

The included commodity MaxDOSFiles can make what was once a pain, modem
transfers of Mac software, more straightforward by, among other things,
monitoring the use of MacBinary files on specified devices.  It can also
protect the user (or the drive, depending on your viewpoint) from seeing
files the Mac OS would hide from them.<p>

On the downside, the costs of being an Amiga development company have
dictated that MaxDOS 2.5 now comes with even more minimalist packaging than
before...and no hardcopy manual.  The AmigaGuide manual included is great,
and does the job, and to be honest, I'm glad to see online text references
build legitimacy.  But some people like hardcopy manuals just as they like
hardcopy magazines, so you have been notified.<p>

Street prices on the software have dropped below $100, which is good to
see, particularly with the competition of <a href="http://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/misc/emu/ShapeShift3_0.lha">ShapeShifter</a>, the low-cost
shareware Mac emulator which recently added a minimalist Mac filesystem for
the Amiga side of operations.  MaxDOS still comes out cheaper in that you
don't need the Mac ROMs or OS.  But the tide may be turning.<p>

Still, MaxDOS 2.5 does what it says it does, and does it well.<p>
