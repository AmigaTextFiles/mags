DESCRIPTION
<ul> 
AmiSlate is a paint program that allows you and a friend to paint
together, on the same "canvas", over an AmiTCP link.<p>
Features:
<ul>    
<li>Runs in a resizable window on a custom screen, public screen, or
Workbench screen.
<li>Supports most standard painting "tools", including freehand
dot, freehand draw, line, filled and unfilled circles and
rectangles, polygons, and flood fill.
<li>Flexible design allows both users to draw at the same time,
even multiple ARexx scripts can be run simultaneously.
<li>Has a "chat bar" at the bottom of the window to facilitate
textual communication between users.
<li>Will transparently map colors to different palettes in real time,
allowing users to use screens of differing depths.
<li>Loads and saves IFF ILBM format picture files.
<li>Has Record/Playback Macro features.
<li>An extremely full-featured ARexx port, allowing AmiSlate to
be extended by the user to play games or do other interesting
things.  AmiSlate comes with a number of demonstration ARexx 
scripts, including scripts to play chess and Tic-Tac-Toe over
the network.
<li>Installer script included.
