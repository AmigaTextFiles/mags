DESCRIPTION
<ul>
Amiga CDROM Guide (ACDG) was made to help Amiga-owners
to pick the right CDROM for their needs. It doesn't
include commecial games or photoCD-discs, but all Amiga
PD/clipart/fonts/modules collections.<p>
<ul>
<li>It is in the Amigaguide-format.
<li>You will find all the vital information on a CDROM, like
price, contents, publisher etc.
<li>Covers 128 CDROMs
<li>45+ of the CDROMs have a review
<li>If you're interrested in for instance raytracing, click
on the keyword "Raytracing" to get a list of all CDROMs
that can be assosiated with ratracing.
<li>Other keywords: Clipart, fonts, pictures, utilities,
GNU, text-files, fish etc

NEW FEATURES
<ul>
A lot has been changed since the first version (v1.0),
which wasn't uploaded to Aminet.
</ul>
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
<ul>
You will need a program able to display Amigaguide
files. Workbench 3.0 and up has this build-in with
the program "Multiview". For Workbench 1.3 and 2.x
I reccomend the program PPguide, which is available
on Aminet.
</ul>
