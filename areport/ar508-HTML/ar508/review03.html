<p>An equally appropriate title for this game would have been "Laser Squad
Goes To Roswell."  A production by some of the same people who brought the
80s 8-bit and Amiga classic Laser Squad to life, UFO is a strategic combat
and planning game which pits you, the director of a secret anti-UFO
multinational organization, against the combined forces of aliens who are
bent on converting, subverting, and annihiliating the population of Earth.

<p>A game that is as many things as UFO is sometimes is best described with
some very up front and direct assessments.

<tr><td valign=top>-</td><td>UFO is not for those who cringe when they hear
the word "strategy" (or at the very least, not for those who cringe with
good reason, rather than simply not having ever given it a try.)</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>-</td><td>UFO is not non-stop action and alien blasting
fun--although there's plenty of that.</td></tr>
</table><br>

<p>To really enjoy UFO takes patience and dedication.  It's not an easy job
you've been handed.  Not only are the aliens rather better equipped than
you are to start with, but they typically have the strategic advantage over
you at the beginning of the game.  Until your surveillance equipment
blankets the Earth, you're likely to only hear about an alien in Earth's
skies until they've attacked a city--and then they're holding the ground.

<p>UFO takes place in two major modes.  One is the "planning and waiting"
mode, which gives you access to a map of the world and the ability to
create, maintain, and upgrade your UFO X-Com facilities.  (You're in charge
of X-Com.)  At first, your budget is a major constraint, but nonetheless
you have to hire personnel and build rooms that will make your job easier.

<p>The other is the strategic combat mode.  This is where the game shows its
Laser Squad roots, although the old engine has had some polishing up.  You
command a squad of specially trained soldiers in a 3D-isometric map, often
on search-destroy-capture missions.  The 3D view, while prettier than Laser
Squad and offering such amenities as line-of-sight, multiple heights, the
ability to kneel and take cover, is overall more difficult than the old LS
interface simply because getting a clear shot can be much tougher with
everything taken into account.  I found myself getting wasted early and
often.

<p>As the game progresses, you learn more about the aliens and alien
technology.  There's a sort of storyline running through the game, although
of course at first you're just focusing on your own survival while trying
to do your job well enough to keep the money rolling in.

<p>I honestly wish I was better at planning strategic combat.  I still get
pasted by my friends in Laser Squad, and the computer-controlled aliens in
UFO have a field day with me most of the time--although I do get lucky
sometimes.  UFO is going to require that you be better than me to get the
fullest out of the game.

<p>Guildhall's republished version comes on a few floppies with a printed
manual (black and white rather than the color of Microprose's original
manual, but otherwise identical.)  The game has absolutely terrific
atmosphere--the graphics and music are chilling and disturbing, exactly
what they should be for such a game.  A fast machine will come in handy for
the game although you can get by with an 020.  Guildhall is republishing
both AGA and ECS versions of the game.

<p>UFO is not particularly graphics-board compatible but is 060 compatible.
The game is HD installable and runs from the WB.  Documentation protection
exists, and you're provided with a manual just like Microprose's, but in
black and white only.

<p>Note: Microprose made two additional X-Com games for the PC, one focusing
on underwater lifeforms, and the latest, Apocalypse, dealing with all of
humanity crammed into one last mega-city which you have to defend from
aliens.  Given that having all of humanity crammed into a single city is a
pretty crappy way to live anyway, I think X-Com Apocalypse makes playing
UFO Enemy Unknown a real downer--why bother defending the planet if that's
how the X-Com universe ends up anyway?  I really hate sequels sometimes...
