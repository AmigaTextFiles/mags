<p>I hope you had a chance to have a look at issue 9 of The Amiga Informer.
It was our largest issue to date and contained over eight main news
stories, fifteen news bytes and product announcements, sixteen reviews and
summaries, and, of course, our usual informative columns. 

<p>At The Informer, we have a unique way of bringing you information.  
Through our network of internationally connected correspondents, we are
able to gather information as it happens and often we get inside reports
directly from the source.  Unlike some publications, we don't just reprint
press releases that are posted to the internet, but instead investigate and
research our stories and provide you with a commentary view of the events
happening in the Amiga world.

<p>We have an innovative approach to bringing you this information too.  
Unique among Amiga publications, The Informer provides our readers with
both a detailed and professional print magazine, and a comprehensive
website where readers can enjoy current and past articles and columns.  The
website provides instant links to the web sites and email addresses of both
our advertisers and the Contacts listed within those articles.  In
addition, our subscribers get regular news reports sent directly to their
email address, courtesy of Amiga Update Newsletter.  By taking advantage of
the power of the internet and the expediency of electronic correspondence,
we are able to provide our readers with the latest and most comprehensive
reporting available to Amiga enthusiast.

<p>The Informer also provides a means for the small developer or vendor to
reach the Amiga community.  By printing our magazine in grayscale instead
of a full color glossy format, we are able to maintain affordable
subscription and advertising rates.  This gives small companies a chance to
advertise and let readers see just what products are available in the
market today.  We also give a voice to the development community by
offering them free announcements for their new products and upgrades and
providing a web-based Developers Forum where developers can air their views
on matters of interest to the entire Amiga community.

<p>The combination of these and other services are what is making The Informer
the fastest growing Amiga print publication in North America.  By listening
to the suggestions of our readers, and keeping our fingers on the pulse of
the world-wide Amiga community, we will continue to provide our readers
with the most comprehensive and informative Amiga publication available.
