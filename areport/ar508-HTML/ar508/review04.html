<p>Don't blink--you might miss a shift in the Amiga graphics product market.
For the past few years now, starting I'd say with Photogenics, the Amiga
software customer has been flooded with options.  Image processing programs
have become all the rage.  Relative newcomer ArtEffect has taken up an
interesting position with its version 2: it's now just about as expensive
as professional favorite ImageFX, is more accessible and available than
aging but still good AdPro, and even offers a feature or two that the other
guys don't have.

<p>ArtEffect is marketed heavily on being a Photoshop clone.  This is a bit of
a stretch if you're talking about features, but it does have a heavily
graphical/window based interface, something ImageFX 2.6 doesn't offer.  The
interface is pleasingly simple to look at, although this might seem
deceptive if you're accustomed to being overwhelmed by on-screen options.

<p>ArtEffect is geared towards 24-bit work and runs quite well under
CyberGraphX.  I have heard reports that it is non-functional under
Picasso96.  AGA 256-color and HAM8 modes can be used, although HAM8 can get
very slow very fast.  

<p>The first place to start with any image editor is loading.  ArtEffect can
load a decent although not exhaustive array of common image formats, but
straight out of the box it is very limited in what it can save out to--IFF
and JPEG being the notably useful ones.  To expand your image load/save
capabilities you need the SuperView plugin for ArtEffect, available for
about US$45.

<p>Once you're that far, of course, now you have to put that $200 or so you
just spent to good use.  As an image conversion package, ArtEffect will
do the job (and now that ArtEffect 2 has added ARexx, you could conceivably
automate the process of batching a collection into JPEG or GIF or IFF).
ArtEffect does not really offer any cataloguing features, but there are
other programs which will take care of that for you.

<p>ArtEffect, like any good image processor, has to perform not just on image
conversions, but on manipulations.  The basic color balance level changes
are available, good for importing images from a source and touching them
up.  ArtEffect offers scanner plug-in capability, so this sort of work
would be your next likely step after a successful scan.  But if you're
looking to go further, into design and graphics work, you'll want to take
advantage of ArtEffect's filters and the implementation of layers, unique
among Amiga graphical packages.

<p>Layers provide you the ability to approach an image not as a single flat
surface on which to apply effects and transformations, but as up to three
sandwiched "layers" which overlay each other, either completely opaquely or
with some degree of translucency.  ArtEffect allows you to use just three
layers at a time, the functional minimum for seriously getting any use from
layers.  The concept has been used successfully in Photoshop for some
time--this is one of the areas where a somewhat legitimate comparison
between the two can be made.  But three layers isn't much--while an
included tutorial shows how they can be used effectively, it's always
frustrating to see arbitrary imposed limits.  Hopefully memory will be the
only barrier in the future.

<p>Layers can only be created--they cannot be "pulled" from an existing image.
The exception is the special IFF format you can save while working in
ArtEffect which will preserve your layers.  Any other format requires
combining all of your layers into one for the save.  Layers can also be
merged at any time, freeing up a layer to add another effect.

<p>ArtEffect's filters are the power effects you'll spend your time in once
you're done converting or gamma correcting images.  These are your "special
FX", the things that make image processors fun and can produce stunning
results.  ArtEffect comes with a good sample, although some of the more fun
effects come in the special plug-in add on packs for US$45.  Many effects
are very dramatic, reminiscent of the current trend for PC and Mac users to
want to "cartoonize" every image they come across.  The most impressive
facet of ArtEffect's filter system is that the preview windows which come
up when an effect is called are interacting--multiple effects will cascade
their results in corresponding filter windows and update automatically.
This is very useful for getting a hold of what your final image will look
like.  Multiple level undo is indispensible as well--luckily, it's in this
version of ArtEffect.

<p>For all that's nice about ArtEffect, I'm a little turned off by the price.
I realize that ImageFX does not seem to be the most intuitive program in
the world, but I've seen what it can do when used by someone familiar with
the system--and I know that the effects are superior to those offered in
ArtEffect.  So when the price of the two packages is now virtually
identical, and ArtEffect actually requires that you spend MORE money in
order to get even close to the amount of effects and supported image
formats, I have to caution you.  If it's serious work you're looking to do,
ImageFX is still the way to go.  ArtEffect is probably going to be more
instantly gratifying to someone, and it is certainly nicer to look at and
more CyberGraphX-friendly, but for the price you could be doing better.

<p>ArtEffect 2 ships with the documentation from ArtEffect 1, plus an
AmigaGuide update file.  Haage and Partner provides very good customer
support and frequently releases update patches.
