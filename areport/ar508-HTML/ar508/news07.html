<p>Oliver Wagner is the one-man wrecking crew behind a number of Amiga internet utilities, most notably Voyager, the shareware HTML browser which
more than once has been the first to offer new features, beating its commercial counterparts AWeb and IBrowse.  Java and Javascript support have
been mentioned for the browser in the near future.  Below is Wagner's explanation of the situation, taken from the CU Amiga mailing list.

<p>From Mr. Wagner:

<p>I've been working on the Javascript implementation for quite some time already; actually, all Voyager versions since 2.42 internally have the
hooks to the Voyager_JS.VLIB plugin which contains the interpreter and object management parts (those were accidentally left active in 2.70, thus
causing Voyager to complain about lack of this library upon hitting &lt;script&gt; tags or event specifications).  Those are now disabled for the
public releases but are still used internally for testing.

<p>I've also made several statements about upcoming Javascript support in Voyager on the support mailing list, including a recent thorough
explanation of the problems which were introduced due to Netscape's latest update to "their" language.  If you ever hit Javascript intensive pages
with MSIE 3.x, you know what I mean :) (see, for example, <a href="http://www.opel.com">http://www.opel.com/</a>).  Obviously, we want to support
the latest Netscape specs on JS, and are closely following the W3C effort to standardize a web scripting language.

<p>I'm not actually writing the interpreter myself, this is done by someone who prefers to stay unnamed since he fears "When will JS be ready?" mailbox
cluttering.  However, the interpreter will be an integral part of the Voyager 3 release.  Part of the code has been originally developed by
Holger 'hkr' Kruse.
