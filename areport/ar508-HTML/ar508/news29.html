<p>The first, and probably most important news about Phase5's PowerUP
PowerPC/060 cards is that they are actually, finally, shipping.

<p>The CyberStorm PPC cards for the A3000 and A4000 are the first to be sent
out the door--the A1200 and 2000 models will follow.

<p>Phase5 has also been doing some work to expand PowerUP coverage: Newtek is
in possession of a board, and SAS/C will be gaining PowerUP code generation
capabilities.  In fact, just about all of the 3D software for the Amiga is
slated for PowerUP conversion.

<p>A1200 owners have seen their options expand again.  The 603+ series of
Blizzard cards will allow the use of an 040 or 060 (as opposed to the 030
previously planned for the original 603 Blizzard board), and all A1200
models with PowerUP cards will be able to use the planned BVision PPC
graphics board, which will attach to the accelerator card in much the same
way as the already announced CyberVision PPC for the big-box Amiga
accelerators.

<p>Blizzard 603+ card pricing is as follows:
(All pricing in DM, does not include necessary 040 or 060 CPU)

<pre>
160 Mhz: 749.00
200 Mhz: 999.00
250 Mhz: 1199.00
</pre>

<p>PowerUP-grade users subtract 100 DM for 160 and 200 Mhz models, 150 DM for
250 Mhz model.

<p>The BVision PPC will be a 4 meg video RAM device capable of 1600x1200x24
bit display at 60Hz.  Planned price is 499 DM, with a 50 DM discount for
PowerUP-grade program members.

<p>Also, Phase5 has dropped all 040-based products from its lineup due to the
lack of availability for 040 chips.  The CyberStorm Mark II has also been
dropped and has been replaced by the CyberStorm Mark III, which is
essentially a PowerUP CyberStorm with the relevant PowerPC circuitry
missing, i.e.  only an 060 onboard with no ability to add a PowerPC 604.
Pricing and availability should be available soon.
