<p><b>TITLE</b>

<p>Games Master System (GMS)

<p><b>VERSION</b>

<p>0.8B (Released September 1997)

<p><b>AUTHOR</b>

<p>Paul Manias (<a href="mailto:paul@ethos.co.nz">paul@ethos.co.nz</a>)

<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b>

<p>The Games Master System is a developers kit that is aimed at enhancing the
functionality of the Amiga OS, with emphasis on games programming.  It is
based on the Amiga shared library standard, so will work with any
programming language such as C, Assembler, E, Basic etc.

<p>The system can be ported across to other platforms besides the Amiga, and
in future GMS programs could be run on other platforms without
recompilation (CPU's must match or they have to be emulated).

<p>Here are just a few of the GMS features:

<p> - Object Oriented kernel design.
<br> - Fast blitter functions, including CPU assisted blitting.
<br> - Full sprite support.
<br> - In-built proportional fading functions.
<br> - Sound support, includes intelligent channel play-back.
<br> - Support for raster/copperlists with built-in special FX.
<br> - External structure and object pre-processing, allows user
  editing of program data.
<br> - Dynamic resource allocation.
<br> - Support for all kinds of input devices (joysticks, joypads etc)
<br> - An official system debugger is provided.
<br> - A preference program that allows editing of things such as
  default screen dimensions, resolutions, mode promotion etc.
<br> - Multi-tasking and screen-switching is supported.

<p>The system has a very modern design and includes full resource tracking and
safe task destruction features.  A debugger has been included which GMS
functions co-operate with, so there is no need for special patches or
debugging tools.  Functions are written with garbage protection features
and where possible, software based memory protection.  GMS can recover from
many programming errors that usually result in software failures.

<p>Full documentation and 285k of example source in C, Assembler and E is
included within the developer archive.

<p><b>NEW FEATURES</b>

<p>Some of the new features present in V0.8B are:

<br> - Complete object orientation, making GMS the first low-level OO
    system to appear on the Amiga.
<br> - Lots of smaller changes and bug fixes.
<br> - Dice C support.
<br> - Revised documentation.

<p><b>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</b>

<p>GMS will take up 1.5 megs of space on your hard-drive and runs in less than
90k of memory.  There are no must-have requirements, but an AGA Amiga is
necessary for about 5% of the demos.  KingCON or any other enhanced shell
with a scroll back buffer is desirable for running IceBreaker.

<p><b>AVAILABILITY</b>

<p>GMS is available on all up to date Aminet sites, for example:

<p> <a href="ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/gms_dev.lha">ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/gms_dev.lha</a> (420k)
