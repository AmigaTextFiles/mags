<p>No Amiga To Waste Update

<p>A place where developers and users can come together as one to share
ideas and comments.

<p><b>NATW HAS EXPANDED WITH SOME NEW FEATURES

<p>DEVELOPERS WANTED</b>

<p>Developers can now use a forum where their needs for development partners
can be posted to.  This forum is freely accessible to anyone and will
facilitate the creation of perfect development teams.

<p><b>MAINTAIN RESERVED IDEAS</b>

<p>Developers have the possibility to drop the reservation of ideas.  The sad
truth points out that this is a necessity.  Soon they'll have the ability
to give feedback about the development status.  A special page will be
added to each idea.  This will be freely editable by the developer that has
reserved the idea.

<p><b>AUTOMATIC NOTIFICATION THROUGH EMAIL</b>

<p>Developers can now choose to be notified daily or weekly about the new
ideas that were posted to the site.  The email contains the full data of
the new ideas, including a link to the ideapage itself (for those that are
running HTML enabled email programs).

<p><b>GIFANIMS AND BANNERS FOR PROMOTION</b>

<p>Several promotion graphics have been created for those that stand behind
NATW and that want to help to make it get known.
