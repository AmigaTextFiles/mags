<p><b>Amiga Inc. To Host Official Developers Conference at MAE</b>

<p>We are very pleased to announce that South Dakota-based Amiga Inc., will be
hosting its first-ever official Developers Conference at the The 1997
Midwest Amiga Exposition (MAE) which will be held in Columbus, Ohio on
November 1 and 2.  The show is produced by the Amiga Central Ohio Network
(AMICON) user group and will be attended by many Amiga software and
hardware companies, Amiga industry luminaries and promises to be a very
positive shot in the arm for the entire Amiga community. 

<p>Darreck Lisle, Amiga Inc.'s Public Relations and Events Coordinator told
CUCUG, "The Developers Conference at the MAE show is actually just the
first of a series of international conferences Amiga Inc.  will be
sponsoring.  We recognize the importance of effective communication and
cooperation between software and hardware makers and the new Amiga
development team here at Amiga Inc.  and we are putting together an
ambitious program to facilitate an effective exchange of ideas and
information."

<p>Additional conferences are now planned for Cologne Germany, Milan Italy,
St.  Louis Missouri, and London, according to Lisle.

<p><b>Amiga Developers Network Planned</b>

<p>CU Amiga Magazine announced today that it was contacted by Amiga Inc.  and
asked to assist in building a database of Amiga developers.  Serious Amiga
developers are being encouraged to register at the CU Amiga web site for
possible, later contact by Amiga Inc.  A Registered Developers Network will
at some point be put together by Amiga Inc., according to Lisle who also
went on to say, "The Industry Council Open Amiga (ICOA) will play a big
part in the future of the Developers Conferences, and the Developers
Network."

<p><b>Epson Supports the Amiga</b> 

<p>In another bit of promising Amiga news, Lisle told CUCUG, "The people at
Epson have agreed to work with us and to supply us with everything needed
to develop software and drivers to support their full line of printers and
scanners." This unexpected announcement will come as a relief to the many
Amiga users who have been frustrated by the lack of Amiga driver support
for popular peripherals in the past.
