<p>Darreck Lisle, Amiga Inc.'s utility infielder (event coordinator, PR man, and pretty much anything else necessary until a full staff gets hired),
spoke last week at an Amiga user group meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.  Set on the grill, this is the summation of the Q&A session that ensued.

<p>Q:  Should we buy AmigaOS 3.1?
<br>A:  Yes--you will need the ROMs for the updated AmigaOS anyway.

<p>Q:  Is graphics card compatibility going to be built into the next OS release?
<br>A: Yes--some type of RTG standard should be included as well as an AHI-type of standard.

<p>Q:  How long should we expect to wait before we see new systems?
<br>A:  Probably around a year.

<p>Q:  Are there any other enhancements to the Amiga you foresee?
<br>A:  Possibly support for the Universal Serial Bus (USB).

<p>Q:  What is Amiga, Inc.'s position on UAE, the Amiga emulator available for Microsoft and UNIX?  
<br>A:  The current practice of pirating Amiga ROMs will be cracked down on shortly.

<p>Q:  What does Amiga, Inc. think about Java?
<br>A:  We would like to see Java in the next OS, but there is still a lot to be done in this area.

<p>Q:  Are we going to see any of the current operating system hacks, such as MUI, built into a future AmigaOS?
<br>A:  Possibly--however, MUI is too large and bulky to consider making it an integral part of the OS.  A TCP stack is a definite possibility.

<p>Q:  Will the prices of existing systems be dropped, like say $1000 off the existing A4000T prices?
<br>A:  Yes--Amiga motherboards are quite simple in design so cost should reduce, especially after improvements are made to the current design,
    such as optimization of the existing custom chip set.

<p>Q:  Will Amiga, Inc. be coordinating with third parties?
<br>A:  Yes--that is one of the main goals of Amiga, Inc.<br><p>
