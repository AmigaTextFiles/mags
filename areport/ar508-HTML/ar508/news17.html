<br>The Graphics World Of ArtEffect

<p>Following the recent successful debut of ArtEffect 2 in June, we are now
pleased to introduce two new special effect packages to extend its' power.
PowerEffects 2 offers a variety of outstanding effects like LensFlares,
Lightning and FishEye.  The new PowerUP Effects package offers a great
performance boost for users of PowerUp boards by Phase5.  This is also the
first commercial Amiga application that takes advantage of the incredible
speed of these RISC based cards.

<p>ArtEffect 2.0

<p>Version 2 of ArtEffect has been completely revised.  We have built on the
innovative concepts which were introduced in version 1.0, and have added
many new features, e.g.  Layers, ARexx and multiple Undo/Redo.

<p>ArtEffect Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 

<p>There is a new FAQ section on the homepage of ArtEffect with helpful
answers to often asked questions.  You are also able to submit your own
questions here regarding ArtEffect.

<p>ArtEffect Mailing List 

<p>A new ArtEffect mailing list has been setup as an open forum for questions
and discussion.  It is also a good place to voice your wishes for future
releases of ArtEffect.

<p>New PowerEffects for ArtEffect 

<p>Nine (9) sensational new effects are included in PowerEffects 2.  Besides
FishEye, Patchwork, FalseColor, Pointize, HalfTone and Crystalize; the
highlights are certainly: Lightning and LensFlares. 

<p>Need for Speed: PowerUP Effects 

<p>Are you looking for some really fast effects?  Then stop here to have a
look at the PowerUP Effects.  The speed of the PowerUP Effect is mainly
based on the PowerPC native version of the plugin.library that handles
almost all actions of the plug-ins.  So not only the filters of this
package will be faster, there is also an increase in speed of every effect,
because they all will now use the new PPC plugin.library.   Besides this,
there are special native versions of the major effects.  The PowerUP
Effects are 2 to 20 times faster than the normal ones.   The PowerUP
Effects are the first application that makes use of the enormous power of
the PowerUP board of Phase 5.
