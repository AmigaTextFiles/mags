<p><b>AMIGAZONE WEB SITE GETS COMPLETE FACE-LIFT</b>

<p>The venerable AmigaZone's Web site (<a href="http://www.amigazone.com">http://www.amigazone.com</a>),
 one of the oldest existing Amiga-supporting web sites has just gotten a
total redesign! 

<p>Our pages now loads faster, because we've split them up a bit into more
sub-pages, and we now use tables with a convenient bar of buttons down the
left-hand side to take you to its other areas. 

<p>However this new site design incorporates even more info than we had
before.  For example, we now feature tables of our current weekly prize
offerings and a listing of recent winners. 

<p>We've even included buttons which will automatically launch your favorite
Telnet client (once you've configured your browser for it) to let you log
right into the Zone's Text-style interface, and another to take you to its
members-only web interface (<a href="http://amigazone.com">http://amigazone.com</a>).

<p>If you haven't visited the AmigaZone site in a while, well c'mon back and
take a look at our fresh new face :-)

<p>(The AmigaZone is an online service for Amiga owners, users and lovers.
