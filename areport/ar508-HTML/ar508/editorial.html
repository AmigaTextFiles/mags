<p><i>HTML preface: At last, the HTML version has been released!  A little later
than we'd hoped, but we really believe you'll like the results.  Because of
the time constraints we have not added screenshots, etc. to this issue of
AR.  That will start in the next edition.  Another piece of good news has
come our way--we will be able to run a special "notification" mailing list
courtesy of Fred Fish and Cronus for those who wish only to be informed
that AR is available for HTML viewing and download.  More details and
signup information will be made available soon.</i>

<p>Ahhh!  Finally.

<p>Work on this issue is finally coming to an end.  And yes, it's been a long
time since we put out 5.07, although I must say that most of you showed
considerable restraint in not mailing me <b>too</b> much about it.

<p>A lot of work went into getting this issue ready for the new graphical HTML
format we'll be moving to.  That's right.  Amiga Report has finally made
the switch.  Initially, we had thought we could maintain both an AmigaGuide
and an HTML version of the magazine, but now that we've seen the result of
the HTML version (which, if you're reading the AmigaGuide version shortly
after its release, will be available in a few days), we've realized these
things.

<p>1.  HTML lets us do a lot more with Amiga Report.

<p>2.  HTML lets us make Amiga Report look a lot better.

<p>3.  Trying to maintain both an AmigaGuide and an HTML version would be
nearly impossible on anything resembling our current schedule.

<p>For these reasons, Amiga Report in AmigaGuide is a lame duck.  We'll do
one, perhaps two more issues in .guide format, and thereafter switch fully
to HTML.  For the time being, the HTML version will be available on Aminet
and through participating web sites.  Once the switch is made, however,
we'll use the Amiga Report mailing list at <a href="mailto:majordomo@ninemoons.com">majordomo@ninemoons.com</a>
(the "areport" list) to distribute HTML Amiga Report.  Because HTML tends
to be larger, and because we'll be able to include pictures much more
readily, the magazine will be split up into multiple archives, logically
ordered (a text archive, and various graphical archives as needed).

<p>There are a minority of readers who cannot even read AmigaGuide but
struggle through reading the magazine as text.  To these readers, a switch
to HTML means a slightly higher level of inconvenience because the magazine
will be in multiple text files instead of just one large .guide file.

<p>There is another minority of readers who do not have an HTML browser.  My
advice?  Get one, they're easy to find and run on virtually any Amiga
configuration put together since 1989.  Your browsing mileage may vary, of
course (Amiga Report in HTML has been IBrowse optimized but looks quite
good on other Amiga and non-Amiga browsers), but AWeb, Voyager, and IBrowse
demos are all over the place--online, on shareware and magazine CD-ROMs,
even on commercial CDs as front ends.  Check out AR 5.08 in HTML when
released and we hope you'll agree with our decision.

<p>A lot has gone on besides just switching over to HTML.  Last issue, I was
about to leave on a trip--to Gateway HQ, where I participated for a few
days in discussions with new Amiga, Inc. GM Jeff Schindler, his skeleton
staff, and the directors of the ICOA (or Open Amiga for "short".)  Petro
was there as well.  Most of what went on was friendly talk and just getting
acquainted--there was of course some mutual brain picking going on, as
Amiga Inc. wanted to know what market insiders and well-known luminaries
like Andy Finkel thought about the Amiga market, while we all hammered at
them trying to find out what their plans were.  

<p>As of today, Amiga, Inc.  has not been able to hire many
employees--partially due to a company policy imposed by Gateway requiring
them to fill upper management positions first before fleshing out their
larger engineering and marketing staffs.  It may seem somewhat
disappointing, but I was greatly inspired by the drive and level head with
which Schindler is approaching the situation.  For now, cooler heads need
to prevail and these guys need a chance to get up and running before TOO
much judgement has passed.

<p>They have made some attempts at a public presence--Petro is flying around
making personal appearances, and new moving target PR man Darreck Lisle has
made some stops in the US as well.  What they've said so far is largely
general--no spec sheets are being handed out.  But they will be at the
early November Midwest Amiga Expo as well as the large Cologne Computer '97
expo.  By then, perhaps we'll hear a bit more.

<p>-Jason

<p><i>PS: It looks like I'll be at the Midwest Amiga Exposition, along with
Assistant Editor Katherine Nelson and our partners from Legacy Maker.  Hope
to see some of you there!</i>
