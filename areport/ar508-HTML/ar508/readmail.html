<p>comments: I found an AmigaGuide viewer for those Amiga users out there that have
(temporarily) left the Amiga for MS-Doze... I just can't remember where
I found it... It's called AGV...(AmigaGuide Viewer - original name eh?)
I don't have any docs on it but I found it on the WWW (somewhere...)

<p><i>- Mr.  Broussard followed this up with the executable.  I'll see what I
can do about making it more readily available.  It's ironic, though, that
this came through so short to our cancellation of the AmigaGuide version of
Amiga Report...  -Jason</i>

<br>Subject: Amigas in Sri Lanka

<p>In the current issue of AR, a poor Amiga enthusiast from Sri Lanka asks for
help in getting Amiga-related materials in his decided un-Amigan country. 
While unfortunately I live nowhere near Sri Lanka and cannot help him, I
should point out that one of the Amiga's more famous promoters, Arthur C. 
Clarke, DOES happen to live in Sri Lanka.

<p>I wonder where he got his equipment?

Subject: Migraph

<p>Dear DeWilton,

<p><table border==0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td width=30 align=middle>&gt;<p>&gt;<p>&gt;</td><td>
<b>comments: I am writing because I have a MS2400 Migraph Flatbed Scanner and
recently had a reason to scan slides.  When I purchased the scanner Migraph
had an attachement that allowed the scanning of transparencies.

<p>My question is does Migraph still exist?  There phone has
been disconnected and I can't get a new listing from
directory assistance.

<p>Do you have any idea where I might find one of these attachments?</b>
</td></tr></table><br>

<p>I just read your letter in Amiga Report this morning.  Unfortunately I
can't help you with locating the transparency attachment, but I can confirm
Migraph's fate.  Back in December I tried contacting them to get an update
to their Touch-Up software, but to no avail.  So I then proceeded to mail
each of their 3 or 4 last known addresses.  All but one was returned, and
that letter went to a Post Office Box.  AFAIK that relies on the
cooperation of the (current?) boxholder.  So I then decided to contact City
Hall in Federal Way, WA, who plainly told me that Migraph had not renewed
theit business license for 1997.  So they chose to quietly slip away.

<p>I've never seen any of their hardware first-hand, but would be surprised if
they didn't just choose generic scanners made in the Far East and put their
name on it.  I have seen hand scanners for several different platforms, and
this would appear to often be the case.  So my guess is that some company
out there sells an attachment that will work for you.  Hopefully somebody
can give you a more concrete answer, but failing that, I would start making
enquiries.   And if all else fails, I have the name (and possible address)
of the owner.

<p>Sincerely,

<p>Todd Oberly

<p>comments: Hello Mr.  Compton.  I know the Amiga Computer since 1988 and get
a A1200 in august of 1993.  This computer is "sensacional", "la berraquera"
this the principal expresion to this platform.  My machine A1200 had
accelerator Microbotics, with MMu and FPU and 50MHZ, sound, video and
conection to Internet.

<p>I lost my A1200, because the "ladrones" in spanish, get into my house and
get us all my home: TV, A1200, CDTV, VHS, bicyclet, radio, "joyas", and so
on.

<p>This ocurred in jun 27 of 1996.  Today i buy another A1200, with HD 80MB,
Accelerator GVP, monitor Comm.  1084, MMU, FPU and Midi Interfece.

<p>I have an PC Computer Premium.

<p>But A1200 is very nice.  I work in Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje, SENA.
in Santafé de Bogotá, Colombia South America.

<p>My Entity is a public service to prepared the workers. 

<p>We are 9,000 employees.  4,500 of they are teachers an instructor of
diferents materias or especialities. 

<p>Sena is the only public service for the poor people.

<p>The working student has much necesities and the only site to study is Sena
Entity.

<p>In relation to Amiga report I have collected Amiga Report from 201 through
507.

<p>Your magazine is very important.  The Colombians Amigans are "preocupados
por" the Amiga future.  Gateway 2000 not decided nothing.

<p>I have in my computer IBrowse v1.0 and tomorrow will have IBrowse 1.12a.

<p>Excuse me my bad English. 

<p>Thank you. Felicitacions from Amiga Report.

<p>A Colombian Amigan.

<p><i>- It's really rewarding to hear from readers so diverse from across
the globe.  Sorry to hear about the loss of so much of your equipment.

<br>Subject: For next AR, readers section..

<p>Hi!

<p>I have now for about one year waited for a sign of an eventually new
version of Magic Workbench.  I'm still waiting...

<p>Reference:

<p>----8&lt;---from http://www.sasg.com/mwb/future.html ---
<br>The test extends over the coming months.  The amount of new-registered
users in this test period will be decisive of the future of MagicWB and if
I will continue my work on it.  If the amount of registrations within this
period is not going to improve I will interpret this as a "no" to any
further development of MagicWB and will eventually have to stop this
project (as much as I would regret it). 
<br>----8&lt;-----------------------------------------------

<p>This test Martin is talking about have been almost a year now...  (1st of
August 96?)

<p>I wonder when it will end?  As with the Amiga situation today only time
will tell..

<p>Regards Per Jonsson

<p>comments: Is Amiga dead or not?  When is Gateway releasing the new Amiga
range is there such a range and is there any hope of South-Africa getting
some Amiga stores or support.  My A1200 BLEW UP by lightning and no one can
fix it.  Give us some news on the net of what is happening.

<p><i>- No, the Amiga is not dead.  It's too soon to tell when Amiga, Inc. 
could release a new line of Amigas or even what is feasible to put in such
a computer.  As far as South Africa gaining substantial Amiga support, in
the short run I would imagine that would have to be market driven, although
it would be nice to see a world-class service organization develop over
time.  -Jason</i>

<p>comments: Wow, Amiga Report still kicking!  I am glad to see you do not
have archived my inauspicious publishing debut with A.M.I.G.A.  :-). 
Sadly, I jumped the Amiga ship about 3 years ago now, and have been paying
for it since through Windows 95/DirectX programming hell.  You don't know
how I've wished for sanity in an operating system!  I do still have my
trusty A1200, languishing away under the bed, but there nonetheless. 
Anyway, just wanted to say I hope you have continued success with the mag,
and I expect you to still be here 3 years from now when I check in again
(and the Amiga will be owned by Wal-Mart or some such nonsense) :-)
