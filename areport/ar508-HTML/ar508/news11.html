<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b>

<p>UltraAccounts is a home accounts program which has been designed to make things as simple and easy to use as possible - so that even people who
don't know anything at all about keeping accounts (or using computers) should be able to use UltraAccounts without any problems at all.

<p>Features include:

<br> - Multitasking windows. Open and use several different windows at exactly the same time.
<br> - Supplied in English, Francais & Nederlands.
<br> - Multiple accounts & transaction tags.
<br> - Full payslip support, including multiple wage configurations.
<br> - Debit & credit standing orders, and timed transfers. The   transactions entered by these timed events can be edited or erased *without* duplicate entries being created.
<br> - Budgeting facilities.
<br> - Common transactions & transfers. Predefine the details of any   often-used transactions or transfers, saving you from having to
  keep retyping those details each time you enter that particular   transaction/transfer.
<br> - Reminders. Make sure you don't miss important events, such as birthdays/anniversaries or bills that need paying.
<br> - Pie, bar and line graphs, with optional future projections.
<br> - Encrypted files, optionally password protected.
<br> - Fully configurable export formats.

<p><b>NEW FEATURES</b>

<p> - The Show/Account etc windows have been redesigned to add some buttons for selecting the Display Options, Date Range, etc.
<br> - The titlebar of the main UltraAccounts window now only displays the "name" part of the current filename, instead of both the name & path.
<br> - The various backup options (and associated tooltypes) have all changed. See the main docs for more info about this.
