<p><font size=+1><b>Workbench85</b></font><hr>

<p>One of the things in which Commodore never did much work was probably the
icon part of Workbench.  Be it the icon engine itself, or the look of the
system icons, Commodore seemed to have always worried about the
ridiculously-low-end part of things by keeping their icons 4 colors--with a
no-frill engine to handle them.  Fast but boring.  Basically, icon imagery
is nothing but actual bitplane data stored in an image structure, with no
color information.  All that is stored is information that some pixels will
use whatever color is first in the screen's color map (Color0), other
pixels will use the next color, and so on.  This means the icon will use
whatever colors the system palette is set to, preventing the use of any
color scheme in icons for easy recognition.  Thus, an icon which is
supposed to show the Canadian flag (red and white) might very well come up
as gray and green.

<p><font size=+1><b>Workbench 2.04 - Things are getting better...  Are they?</b></font><hr>

<p>With Release 2 of the OS, Commodore did a complete overhaul of the GUI.  A
new 3D look was defined for windows and gadgets.  This was also applied to
icons--they were turned into large buttons that would recess as you clicked
on them.  While this provided a very useful visual feedback, this kinda
hindered artistic efforts - you had to do something that would look nice
while surrounded with a gray box.  You couldn't get rid of it.  As for the
icon look itself, not much was done to improve the look.  It was mostly
left to flat black & white pictograms.

<p><font size=+1><b>A little Magic on your Workbench</b></font><hr>

<p>The first real effort toward improving things came probably through
MagicWB.  It defined an 8-color standard palette (quite an improvement over
the CBM 4-color scheme), as well as more a intricate icon design.  It
quickly became popular, and soon hundreds of icons using the MagicWB style
started to appear.  However, the palette engine used by Workbench and
icon.library was still a problem.  A small patch was written to ensure that
the 8 standard colors would be locked, preventing applications from
changing them.  So, you were sure your MagicWB icons would always use the
same colors on any system running that pen locker.  For quite a few years,
people were content with it.

<p><font size=+1><b>Newer and better</b></font><hr>

<p>The second attempt at improving things came out as NewIcons, from Nicola
Salmoria.  NewIcons's revolution was that it wasn't just an attempt at
changing the look - it was also an attempt at improving the actual icon
engine, by allowing a palette (up to 256 colors) to be embedded within each
icon, which would be dynamically remapped as it was displayed.  The drastic
improvement over the original palette-less icon scheme was to allow more
colorful icons to be used, without having the user worrying about what
color to lock in his or her Workbench palette.

<p>The new engine (supplied as a library and a system patch) was shipped with
a 16-color isometric iconset, bringing a whole new look to the Workbench. 
However, the silly gray boxes were still there.  There was also a price to
pay--more colorful icons meant higher memory requirements, and the actual
remapping process slowed down icon display quite a bit as well.  Today, we
might find this irrelevant as we're flying with 24-bits cards and 68060,
but back to these days (around 1993), the average user was still using ECS
or AGA, on a 68020 or 68030.

<p><font size=+1><b>The new Ring Bearer</b></font><hr>

Just after the release of NewIconsV2, Nicola decided to pass the torch to
new developers as he migrated to another computer platform.  Eric Sauvageau
and Philip Vedovatti decided to take over, respectively as programmer and
icon artist (former icon art was being done by Roger McVey).  Work began on
a major update that would push it even further.  V3 finaly came out, with a
welcomed surprise: gone were the gray boxes surrounding icons!  Also, as
people started to get faster CPUs and better graphic cards, they started to
want something more colorful for their Workbench, NewIcons grew in
popularity.  V3 also allowed graphics card owners to have icons loaded into
FastRAM instead of the slower (and limited to 2 MB max) ChipRAM.

<p><font size=+1><b>Better, Stronger, Faster</b></font><hr>

About one year later, another incarnation of NewIcons appeared, as Version
4 was released.  As 68060 and graphics cards had become popular, the
included iconset got redesigned in 32 color.  Also, gray boxes were totally
eliminated, as icon dragging is now also box-free.  It also allowed the
user to select between normal, outlined or shadowed rendering for the
icon's text, allowing even more freedom in Workbench look customization.
And finally, it was also faster than V3.

<p><font size=+1><b>icon.library - The Next Generation</b></font><hr>

There is no doubt that something must be done about the icon scheme in a
future update to AmigaOS.  The first thing that needs to be addressed is
the need for screen palette independant icons - having each icons decide
which colors it requires, just like NewIcons does.  However, NewIcons
itself isn't a long-term solution.  NewIcons was designed as a patch over
the old icon scheme, compromising in various areas to allow full backward
compatibility, like having its new image data stored in the tooltypes.  And
with modern graphics cards, 256 colors for icons is no longer enough.  The
icon palette would need to be extended to at least 16 bits, with true
transparency support.

<p>Other features missing from the actual icon scheme is support for alternate
imageries.  How about less colorful images for systems with less color?  Or
with the advent of more powerful processors, dynamic rescaling so icons
would adapt to the aspect ratio of the actual display could even become a
realistic feature.  Another feature popular on other platforms is the
presence of an alternate, smaller image that can be used as a pictogram
either in an application launcher or in some text display of a directory,
like a file requester.

<p>Finally, some form of filetype recognition needs to be integrated to the
Workbench.  This could be implemented as a "filetype" field stored into the
icon, which would take further the idea of a "default tool", where a user
could change the default tool for a given file type through some global
preference editor, rather than having to individually change every icon for
a given filetype.  This would eliminate the chaos of every programmer
finding another new esoteric text viewer to set as the default tool for
their documentation icon, ruining the idea of saving the actual user the
work of having to decide what to use as he double-clicks on its icon.

<p><font size=+1><b>Who shall lead the herd to greener pasture?</b></font><hr>

<p>Third party developers pushed farther the unfinished task Commodore had
started in 1985 by bringing to the user a graphical user interface that was
meant to be both easy in use and attractive.  They took care of the
aesthetic side of things that Commodore had somewhat failed to assert.  
Now, it's time to give back the torch to whomever at Amiga, Inc.  will be
working on the next version of AmigaOS, so they can take things one major
step further ahead, farther than third parties could by just patching over
an OS and an icon system that's starting to show its age.
