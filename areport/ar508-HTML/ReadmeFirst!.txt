Welcome to the first official HTML version of Amiga Report!

Point your browser into "ar508" and load up index.html.
You'll be off and running in no time!

Just a couple of quick notes.  You may notice that there are
two directories in this archive--"ar508" and "Images".  The
Images are pictures that will be reused from issue to issue of
AR and should be kept exactly where they are.  We suggest you
create an "AR" directory (if you don't have one already) and
de-archive this and future issues of AR to it.

We're very sorry about the time lag in getting the HTML issue
out.  Now that we've worked through the difficulties the process
should be much more streamlined in the future.

I hope you enjoy AR 5.08 in HTML even more than you did the first
time around!
