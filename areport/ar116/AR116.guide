/// From the Editor's Desk                        "Saying it like it is!"
    ----------------------


There are a lot of rumors flying about Commodore's CD32 game console.  No
confirmed information exists that we know of, but we have included a press
release in German later in the issue that has some interesting details.
I was unable to get it translated in time for publication, so you'll have
to fend for yourselves in that respect.  If somebody out there wouldn't
mind sending me a translated copy, I'll run that next week.

The big question about this new game console is, "Will Commodore market
it properly?"  I hope so.  If not, it'll die just like Atari's Lynx
color portable video game system.  If people don't know it exists, they
won't buy it.

Also, Atari's Jaguar system will literally blow the CD32 into the weeds
if it makes it out at the projected price of $200 (compared to $400 for
the CD32).  The Jaguar is a 64-bit RISC system with a DSP, compared to
a 68020 at 14 MHz and AGA for the CD32.  Hmmm...  While the CD32 will
easily compare to the 3DO and Sega CD, it can't hope to compete on even
ground with the Jaguar, should it be successful.

We've added yet another distribution site -- this time in Portugal.  Much
thanks to Sysop Celso Martinho.  We hope to add distribution sites soon
in Germany and the UK, as well as other countries.  If you are a BBS
sysop in these areas, have an internet address and would like to be a
distribution site, please send me Email.

That's it for now.  See ya next week!

PIONEER CREATES MULTIMEDIA SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT GROUP

TOKYO, JAPAN -- Japan's major audio visual product maker Pioneer has set
up a group to create multimedia software for its latest interactive laser
disk player. The group is called "Multimedia Creators Network" and it
consists of noted computer graphics designers, musicians and motion
picture writers.  This group aims to create software for Pioneer's new
multimedia device called Laser Active.

The group's office will be located at Studio Garage, which is an unique
software facility in Tokyo. Major Japanese advertising agency Dentsu and
Los Angeles-based Magic Box Productions will also participate in this
group. It is expected that these participating members will develop
educational or entertainment software for adults.

The Laser Active is a hybrid machine based on Pioneer's laser disk
player. Besides regular laser disks, the device supports karaoke laser
disks and game disks. These features were added to the laser disk player
in cooperation with Sega Enterprises and NEC Home Electronics. With ROM
packages, the user will be able to play NEC and Sega game programs on this
laser disk player.

The actual release of Laser Active is scheduled to be August 20. The retail
price of Laser Active is 89,800 yen ($820). ROM packages for Sega and NEC
game software costs 39,000 yen ($350) each. One game software cartridge
costs about 10,000 yen ($90).

PHIBER OPTIK PLEADS GUILTY

NEW YORK -- Mark Abene, better known throughout the computer world by
the hacker handle "Phiber Optik," plead guilty on July 2 in Federal
Court to felony charges of conspiracy and unauthorized access to
computers. Abene had been due to go to trial on these counts today.

The plea by Abene, entered before Judge Louis Stanton in the Southern
District of New York, admitted intrusion into computers owned by
NYNEX, BellSouth, and Southwestern Bell. In his statement, Abene said
that he had, in his actions, "never tried to damage any computer
systems and, to my knowledge, I never have."

In the course of the proceedings, Judge Stanton asked Abene a series of
questions including: whether he understood the charges;
whether he realized that, by pleading guilty to felony charges,
he was exposing himself to possible loss of civil liberties such
as the right to vote, sit on jury or hold public office;
whether he realized that he could face a maximum sentence of 10 years
imprisonment and a maximum fine of $500,000; whether he understood
that he could be required to make restitution for damages;
and whether he was satisfied that he had received adequate legal
counsel. He replied yes to all the above, but no to the question
of whether he had been threatened or coerced by the United States
Attorney's office to change his plea.

Following the questioning, the judge asked Abene to say what he did.
Abene responded by admitting that he had conspired with others to gain
access to various computer systems, including those belonging NYNEX,
BellSouth and Southwestern Bell; he had intercepted data on networks
belonging to British Telcom and Tymnet; and that he had misrepresented
himself to employees of phone companies to gain access to their
systems. It was during these admissions that Abene said that he
had never, to his knowledge, damaged any systems.

At the end of Abene's statement, Assistant US Attorney Fishbein stated
that Abene had fraudulently used computer accounts at New York
University to access the remote computer systems. When asked by the
judge to confirm Fishbein's assertion, Abene did.

Judge Stanton then stated, "Mr. Abene is fully competent to make an
informed plea in this case. He is knowledgeable of the charges against
him and is aware of the possible consequences. I accept his guilty
pleas."

Judge Stanton then set sentencing for 9:30AM Wednesday, November 3rd.
He asked Abene's attorney, Paul Ruskin, to insure that he do everything
possible to cooperate with the probation staff in its development of a
background of Abene for the sentencing procedure. Abene was then
released on his own recognizance.

Abene, together with Elias Ladopoulpos, a/k/a "Acid Phreak;" Paul Stira,
"Scorpion;" John Lee, "Corrupt;" and "Julio Fernandez, "Outlaw," were
indicted on July 8, 1992. Ladopulous, Stira, Lee, and Fernandez
previously plead guilty to charges relating to the indictment. Lee,
the only one sentenced to date, has received a year and a day.
Stira and Ladopoulos are scheduled for sentencing on July 23.

In a prepared statement after court adjournment, United States Attorney
Mary Jo White said that the investigation leading to the indictment was
performed jointly by the United Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. She praised both the Secret Service and FBI and thanked
the Department of Justice Computer Crime Unit for "their important
assistance in the investigation."

Ruskin, Abene's attorney, told Newsbytes, "My personal opinion is that
Mark has outgrown the phase in his life in which he performed the
activities to which he confessed. He wants to use his considerable
computer talents in manners that will be productive to society."

Fishbein told Newsbytes, "The government is satisfied with the
successful end to an important case. We hope that other people
involved in illegal computer activities recognize that the Federal
Government takes these cases very seriously."

APPLE LAYOFFS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED

CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA -- Rumors fed by a New York Times article last
week hinted Apple Computer would lay off as much as ten percent of its
work force, but the official announcement of layoffs at Apple is worse
than expected. The company publicly announced fifteen percent, or
nearly 2,500 of the company's 16,000 employees, will be getting their
pink slips.

Most of the layoffs will occur this month, according to Apple
which is calling the move part of its "re-engineering" effort
planned for the next twelve months. Apple says the
restructuring will be company-wide and aimed at accelerating
revenue. In June, Apple said stockholders could expect lower
earnings for the second half of its current fiscal year due to
profit-cutting price wars. Intense pressure from the IBM and
compatible personal computer (PC) industry has finally caught
up with Apple, according to analysts. The two main pressure
points are the success of graphical Microsoft Windows 3.1 and
the PC price wars.

This is not the first time Apple Computer has announced layoffs.
However, this is the largest layoff the company has announced
to date. In May of 1991 Apple laid off ten percent of its work
force, or nearly 1500 employees. At that time, some employees
set up a protest outside Apple and read excerpts from Apple
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) John Sculley's book "Odyssey."
Sculley said in his book that companies owe it to their employees
to make "work" a rewarding experience and that corporate
strategy should not be driven by the need to improve quarterly
earnings.

In the company's current dilemma, Sculley suggested Apple
Computer was for sale last month when he mentioned to various
publications his suggestion to IBM that it should buy Apple.
Talks about a possible purchase of the company by American
Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) have been hinted, but no
official announcement or even a confirmation of the talks has
been forthcoming from either company.

Sculley stepped down as CEO in June as well, and former Chief
Operating Officer (COO) Michael Spindler took the CEO slot.
Industry analysts have said if things were really, really bad
at Apple, the company's board of directors would have put
Sculley out entirely, but some speculation suggests such a
drastic move would alarm stockholders. Sculley's
responsibilities currently include travel in the search for new
technology opportunities for Apple. There is a report by the
San Jose Mercury News which suggests that Sculley may not
return to Apple after his sabbatical ends in August.

The wait now is for the company's second quarter earnings
statement, expected in the middle of this month. The stock
market appears to approve of Apple's layoff move as the
company's stock was up in morning trading. Apple's stock has
dropped one-third in value overall since the beginning of the
year, to close Friday, July 2, 1993 at thirty-eight. Many
analysts, however, including those at California Technology
Stock Letter, are seeing Apple's stock drop as an opportunity
for investors. Confidence in the company is high, they say,
and they are urging their readers to buy as much of the stock as
they can.

The restructuring charges incurred by the current round of layoffs
will not be seen until the third quarter earnings statement,
Apple added.

HP SCANJET IIC IS LATEST COLOR SCANNER TO GAIN DIRECT ADPRO SUPPORT

The  popular  HP  ScanJet  IIc  is the latest flatbed color scanner to gain
direct   support   from  within  ASDG's  Art  Department  Professional  and
MorphPlus.   The driver carries a suggested list price of $200 and requires
a Commodore compatible SCSI controller with an external connection.

The  ScanJet  IIc  is  the first SCSI scanner to be supported by ASDG.  Its
user  interface operates identically to ASDG's driver for the parallel port
based  EPSON  scanner  family,  and  the  GPIB  and serial port based Sharp
scanner family.

As  with the other scanners which ASDG supports, two versions of the driver
are included.

The  first  integrates  the ScanJet IIc directly into ASDG's Art Department
Professional.   Asking  ADPro  to  ``load''  from the scanner brings up the
driver's WYSIWYG graphical user interface which has been carefully designed
to make scanning for print and video applications easy.

For  example, it allows the video user to specify a region to be scanned in
terms  of  pixels,  while  a print oriented user can specify a region based
upon  physical  area.   The user interface also allows picture aspect to be
locked  allowing  a  physical space on a page or specific screen size to be
quickly and easily matched.

When  running  on AGA equipped Amigas, such as the A4000/040 and A4000/030,
all previews are displayed in 256 shades of gray for near photo-realism.

Also  provided  is  a  stand-alone version of the driver which provides the
same  user  interface  but scans directly to disk.  This allows the maximum
scanning size to exceed available memory.  Since this version of the driver
is  stand-alone, Art Department Professional is not required to make use of
this product.

The  driver carries a suggested list price of $200 and requires a SCSI disk
controller  (with  an  external  connector) which is 100 percent compatible
with Commodore's SCSI Direct standard.

ASDG UPGRADES AWARD WINNING CygnusEd PROFESSIONAL

CygnusEd  Professional,  the text editor for Amiga programmers and writers,
has  been  upgraded  to release 3.0.  The new release, several years in the
making,  offers  complete  Workbench 2.0 and 3.0 compatibility, support for
multiple languages, and many new features and improvements.

CED's  power,  speed,  and flexibility earned it the 1992 Amazing Computing
Reader's  Choice  Award for Best Text Editor even though, at that time, CED
had  not  been  upgraded in over two years.  The wait for a new CygnusEd is
finally over.

ASDG   is  pleased  to  announce  that  the  original  author  of  CygnusEd
Professional, Mr.  Bruce Dawson, has joined the full-time staff of ASDG and
has  produced  release  3.0  of  one  of the most popular text editors ever
released for the Amiga personal computer.

Release  3.0  offers  many  new  features and improvements.  These include:
full  compatibility  with  Workbench  2.0  and  3.0  with  CED's now-famous
lightening  fast  scrolling  and text rendering on any AGA screen; multiple
concurrent  CEDs  can  be  launched  in separate windows or screens; a full
featured  macro  editor is supplied; the system clipboard is used for block
operations allowing blocks to be shared with other programs; and search and
replace  strings  offer  ``history''  so  that  they  can remember previous
values.

And,   owing  to  CED's  incredible  following  overseas,  Release  3.0  is
locale.library compatible, which means it can present its user interface in
multiple  languages.   In  addition  to  English,  a localized text set for
Germany will be provided initially.

Also  of note is Release 3.0's upgraded manual which has been substantially
enhanced and re-typeset for increased quality.

CED  Release  3.0  carries  a  suggested  list price of $119.95.  Owners of
previous  versions  of CygnusEd can upgrade to the new release for $30 plus
$5 shipping in the United States.  If you reside outside the United States,
please  add  $15  for shipping.  To upgrade, send a check and your original
disk  to  ASDG.   If  you cannot locate your original disk, contact ASDG to
make other arrangements.

GVP MAINTAINS AMIGA VITALITY WITH NEW ImageFX

GVP has announced the imminent release of a major upgrade to their image
processing package, ImageFX.  ImageFX has now been further enhanced to meet
the changing demands of photographers, graphic artists, animators,
educators, scientists, and hobbyists.

Highlights of this comprehensive upgrade include faster global operation,
multilevel UNDO, macro recording, and aspect lock.  In addition, users can
expect improved real-time feedback for all painting tools, new drawing
tools, and more crazy effects.

Moreover, there are dozens of new loader & saver modules, extended support
for the new Epson 600 & 800 series scanners, plus Framegrabbers like the
VLAB and PP&S 256.  In an effort to stretch compatibility, ImageFX 1.5 now
directly supports the Opalvision and Retina display boards.  Finally,
ImageFX 1.5 pushes the envelope of print quality to the limit, as further
enhancements were made to the already-excellent output routines.

If that weren't enough, the accompanying version 1.5 manual addendum
provides clear explanations of changes and features, plus many existing
chapters have been expanded and revised, making ImageFX 1.5 incredibly easy
to use.

These are just some of the changes made to the program that embodies its
slogan, "Truly Integrated Image Processing." As a tribute to integration,
Byrd's Eye Software* , makers of the ToasterVision package for the, Video
Toaster have announced ToasterFX; an ingenious compliment to ImageFX,
allowing it to load, save, and display directly to & from the Toaster with
professional ease!  Furthermore, ToasterFX modules allow ImageFX to preview
and paint within the Toaster as well.



Great Valley Products continues to support their "power to the people"
approach by offering this new version to registered users at only $29.95.
Version 1.5 is anticipated to ship beginning July 15, 1993.  More
information will be provided as it becomes available.

TERRA NOVA DEVELOPMENT RELEASES "DINER" OBJECT SET FOR IMAGINE


Terra Nova Development of Ventura, California has released Volume One of
its Designer Objects series of 3D models.  This first volume, "DINER", is
a three disk set of objects for Impulse, Inc.'s Imagine software for
Amiga computers.

The Diner set includes a variety of objects that together build a
complete diner of the early 1950's, including a jukebox, counter, booths,
a pay telephone, dishes, cups, silverware, and other items for place
settings.  In many cases there are both `hi-res' and `lo-res' versions
versions of objects so that artists can optimize their scenes for either
image quality or speedy rendering.

In addition to the objects and image maps there are two Imagine projects
on the disks.  One, with scenes that can be rendered on five megabyte
systems, offers fairly simple scenes; the other features more complex
scenes that require up to fourteen megabytes to render.  A manual is
included.

The Designer Objects series is intended to showcase the talents of gifted
3D artists by making available affordable collections of their 3D
objects.  The Diner objects were created by award-winning computer artist
Bradley W. Schenck, whose work should be familiar to the Amiga community
through articles and artworks including wins in the BADGE Killer Demo
Contests of 1988 and 1989.

Terra Nova Development, based on the California coast, is a
ground-breaking multimedia development company hard at work on
entertainment and application titles for several computer platforms.

Terra Nova Development
P. O. Box 2202

Price for the set is $47.50 US.  Direct sales orders from California
should include $3.44 sales tax.  Orders accepted with money order, check
or cashier's check in US funds.

     FidoNet tosser/editor for all Amiga points (with WB 2.0+)

                      (C) 1993 Nico Francois


To quote Roger Nordin (ANet Test Bench) -- having just tried one of the early betas:

"The program does look *very* impressive.  I'd say it blows away
 everything else on the market today, no kidding."


Feature list:

 * Requires Kickstart 2.04 or higher.
 * Supports new 3.0 features (newlook menus, memory pools,...).
 * Fully localized (Workbench 2.1 or higher).
 * Style Guide compliant.
 * Supports all current and future monitor modes.
 * Completely font-sensitive, user may select which fonts to use.
 * Keyboard shortcuts for most menus and gadgets.
 * All settings can be easily changed from within Spot.
 * Fast importing/exporting.
 * Automatically creates new areas for you, no tedious work.
 * Special fast message base format with only a few files per area.
 * Optional - fully transparent - message base crunching.
 * Message list with powerful functions (e.g. search body text).
 * Message thread linking based on subject and MSGID kludge.
 * Excellent support for multiple character sets (LATIN-1, IBM,...).
 * Built-in, fully asynchronous, Fido file request.
 * Multi-bossing and multi-domain capable.
 * Nodelist support (traplist.library).
 * Userlist editor. Every domain has its own userlist.
 * ARexx port.
 * Clock

(Some of these features are only available in the registered version)

Spot has been tested on nearly every Amiga model, including an A500 and an
A4000/040.  A harddisk and at least 1MB of RAM are strongly recommended. At
least Workbench 2.0 is required, Workbench 2.1 or 3.0 for locale support.


Spot will be released Saturday 3rd of July 1993.  It will be available for
file request from Great Balls Of Fire BBS (2:292/603@FidoNet):

 GBOF Line #1 - +32-16-640912 (V32b, ZyX 16k8, V42b - min 14k4)
 GBOF Line #2 - +32-16-640099 (V32b, V42b)

The evaluation version will be freqqable under the magic filename of
'SPOT'. File can be freqqed from midnight 0:00 CET and is around 300K
large.

Spot will also be hatched into ADS and will most probably arrive at a local
BBS near you.

From Skipper Smith on Fidonet's Amiga_Tech echo...


For those people who saw my comment on the Quantum GO drive and the A1200
that I have but won't work together.  I finally got in touch with someone
at Quantum's technical support and I have been told that the problem is a
firmware bug and if I send my drive back to them they will replace it with
one that works.  As the GO drive was the best $/MB (at the time, my
primary interest- far more so than speed), I am happy to hear this and I
will be happy to report the results of my returning the drive when I get
it back.

From Flayberger on Bix...

Thank you! I don't know who to personally thank, but a BIX user was kind
enough to take my announcement about being laid off from Commodore and
have it distributed in an Amiga Report. After seeing my request in the
Amiga Report, an Amiga user in Philadelphia called me about an ad-
vertisement he had seen in The Philadelphia Inquirer a few days earlier.
Since it sounded good to me, he faxed me a copy of the ad. I responded
and got the position :-) I started to work on Monday, 6/21/93 as the

/// Commodore Shareholder Movement Update!
    --------------------------------------


            THE COMMODORE SHAREHOLDER MOVEMENT UPDATE  7/02/93


This article follows up on the announcement of the Commodore Shareholder
Movement.  Questions, offers and advice have been pouring in from around
the world.  In response, this article will briefly discuss our background,
activities and plans.  This should establish our credibility and
demonstrate the viability of this movement.

BACKGROUND

The people behind this effort were present at the 1991 Commodore Share-
holders' Meeting.  A prominent Philadelphia attorney was thrown out of the
meeting for raising a "point of order" that the meeting be moved to the
United States where shareholders could attend.  Another shareholder, who
worked for Commodore, warned the Board of Directors of the crisis which is
now occurring.  Other people have since joined the movement including other
shareholders and Commodore employees.

Similar attempts at affecting Commodore management have failed in the past.
But now, new SEC regulations have given shareholders new abilities.  The
rules which previously favored management now allow shareholders to vote
for, or run as, individual board members that are not part of management's
slate.  It is also possible to acquire corporate shareholder lists.  

There are a total of 3700 shareholders.  The latest Standard NYSE Stock
Report shows that Irving Gould owns only 19% of Commodore's common stock.
A total of 70 institutional investors account for 20.6% of ownership,
according to the Nelson's Directory of Investment Research.  According to
the new laws, these institutional investors may vote.  Further, the
remaining 60.4% of Commodore shareholders may be reached through an
official proxy campaign.  That 81% majority of votes may unite to elect 
independent directors.  The three year terms of both Irving Gould and
Alexander Haig are up for reelection this year.

ACTIVITIES

We are talking with candidates for new directors.  These people must have
the necessary abilities and reputation to get elected.  After elected, they
must be able to serve in a contentious environment until the remaining
directors are replaced.  They will start to correct Commodore's problems
and move forward.  Until a candidate states to us their willingness to run,
we will not discuss their names.  But the important thing is that these 
candidates will not be part of management's slate.

We are constantly writing letters, on the phone, and communicating by
E-Mail with people adding their efforts to the movement.  We are in
correspondence with the SEC and Commodore's legal council.  Currently, we
await Commodore's response to our request for the by-laws and shareholder
list.  

PLANS

Our immediate strategy is to take advantage of the new SEC regulations, and
make our movement as publicly known as possible.  We hope to locate and
join efforts with other shareholders by working with magazines, newspapers,
and television.  This public exposure should aid us in pressuring Commodore
to supply their governing by-laws and shareholder list.

In order to nominate and elect new directors, we will ultimately have to
solicit proxy votes and attend the shareholder meeting.  The meeting will
be held some time in November, and proxies will come out some time in
September.  We are not currently asking for anyone to assign us their
proxies.  First, we must complete the proper filing procedures with the
SEC.  At that time, all Commodore shareholders will be informed of the new
candidates for directors.  Meanwhile, we are allowed to talk about our
intentions, and lay the groundwork for popular support.

PARTICIPATION

Many people have asked how they might participate.  It is not too late to
buy stock (at your own risk).  Every vote is important.  But more im-
portantly, help us reinforce our message to the media.  Write about the
Commodore Shareholder Movement to magazines and newspapers.  Call talk
radio shows.  Help us make Commodore's situation into a news story.  Talk
about the company with the wonderful products and the destructive
management.  Talk about how the shareholders and users at long last are
able to take the situation into their own hands.  Watch for future
announcements (including our mission statement), and keep sending us
feedback.

      ATTENTION: PROBLEM CONCERNING NEW VIRUSES

 It is becomming Apparent to SHI that we may be running into a problem,
 that is we are currently running into a sort of slump as far as people
 turning in new viruses. Now certain programmers are seemingly having no
 problem finding some new viruses, BUT is making it HARD for all the OTHER
 programmers by NOT sharing them.

 WE NEED YOUR HELP, we need you to send us as many AMIGA viruses  as
 possible, PLEASE send them to EITHER of the SHI regional virus centers.
 Mark the disk * ATTENTION VIRUS * and state if you want a reply or not, we
 will try to get your disk back to you, BUT it is not  guarenteed. After
 the disk is analyzed, the disk will be formatted and your name arkived in
 the trash if thats what you want, and we ALWAYS keep our promise. 

                         Thanks, Michael Arends

/// Often-Asked Questions about SHI and Answers
    -------------------------------------------
    By Michael Arends



Q: How do I know you're not doing this for profit?

A: I've tried going through the "legal channels" to make this an
   OFFICIAL non-profit organization, but the cost alone just to be
   established was outrageous. If you need real proof that I am doing
   this not for profit, contact Erik Soerensen or Lars Kristensen in
   Denmark. They have records of all moneys sent to them from the RVC's

Q: Where is the PC Version of SUPERKILLERS?

A: We have it!  After a L-O-N-G time in the waiting, I finally have it.
   It's actually two disks: McAfee's AntiVirus and F-Prot AntiVirus.
   

Q: When are the SHI projects going to happen, ie, a universal BBS killer?

A: Some of the projects are happening as you read this. Example, I have
   already seen the "Bootblock.library" that's NOW being used in versions
   of X-Copy! Now if I can get SSI to have MAVERICK to use this same
   feature, we'll be rockin'! (By the way, this library detects 180
   different bootblock viruses before copying disks!)

   As for other projects, we are looking for programmers. If you know of
   any good ones, please let us know!

Q: Are software companies intentionally producing these viruses, so that
   they in turn can sell virus-killing programs at a huge profit?

A: Perhaps....Most of the time it is done by someone who just wants to
   ruin your system.  Other times it is poor programming by "hackers". 
   Still other times it is "system glitches" and not a virus at all. 
   This is why it is IMPORTANT to have the latest information on these
   things, and even  MORE important to have the latest killers from a
   non-commercial center.In the long run, the ones who profit are YOU.

Q: Why do the prices for SHI disks keep changing ?

A: To try and get more people interested in the SHI-disks, while keeping the
   price at an agreeable setting. If disks aren't selling, drastic measures
   need to be taken.  However, I feel that the prices set now (June 1, 1993)
   are fair prices (taking into accordance the price is established by
   Safe Hex Interntional) and will not change for some time.

Q: What's the difference between ordering from you and ordering from Jim
   Maciorowski in Florida?

A: Not a thing...but if you live closer to Florida, the length of time
   to get disks in the mail is decreased.  I've had disks go to him that
   wouldn't reach him until a week or so after I mailed them!

Q: Why isn't SUPERKILLERS available to download from the RVC BBS's?

A: Good question.  Let's take the Fred Fish library for example.  A man
   compiles a disk, distributes it to subscribers, and within a week
   almost every major BBS has the disks.  Then the users of those boards
   download it for free, and Fred Fish gets ZERO for the disk. The disks
   aren't spread ILLEGALLY, but the fact that too many people have access
   to them and don't get it from a source indicates leeching and poor
   computing.

Q: But Fred Fish is a COMPILER, not a PROGRAMMER. Is SHI this way too?

A: SHI is composed of several programmers. In essence,"SHI" and "Anti-
   Virus Programmers" are synonymous. SHI is NOT just a compiling
   organization.  We collect new viruses and help the authors who are
   making the anti-virus programs and share the contributions that are
   sent to SHI.  Don't think of us as another Fred Fish, although we
   have been quoted as being such.  We work hard to keep your Amiga
   virus-free. Don't you think a few bucks is good preventative main-
   tenance from something that could destroy thousands of hours of work
   in mere seconds?

Q: What future projects do you have in store for us in the USA?

A: Jim Maciorowski has started a VSUM-like program that has the list of
   all known Amiga viruses and what they do. He has written an article
   that is in the July 1993 issue of Amigaworld magazine, and I am
   seeking other publications to contribute articles to. Such as AR
  (Amiga Report,hehehe),and Amazing Amiga computing.

   As for subscriptions, I will continue to analyze what prices are the
   most cost-effective and experiment until the end of this year.  After
   January 1, 1994, bonus disks with subscriptions will no longer be
   included with orders from EITHER RVC  made after that date. 

   As always, I am open to suggestions...




              SAFE HEX INTERNATIONAL - THE COMPUTERS GREENPEACE

  Our organization "Safe Hex International", SHI, is a grass roots
movement which  started  in  1990 with Amiga computers. Today we are
an organization with around 600  members who are all more or less
involved in our work.

  We now have 31 virus centres around the world which have free phone
help lines,and where anyone can get the latest Shareware virus killers
on disk. These disks have been translated into the relevant languages
with all imaginable instructions. Even inexperienced users can
immediately understand what to do.

  The price of these disks is now at $5 US, including disk and postage
i.e. a  price  anyone  can  afford. These disks are updated approximately
every 4 to 6 weeks,and contain programs which are generally better than
the best commercial virus killers!

  Our organization or our "movement",I should say, does not have the
formal structure one normally associates with clubs, associations and
the like. We are a non-profit making organization which has a very
specific aim, we try to make active efforts which, in many ways,resemble
those of Greenpeace.The resemblance to Greenpeace is not just coincidental.
Greenpeace works in the biological environment. The only difference with
us, is that we work in the data environment.


  As always, if you are interested in contacting SAFE HEX INTERNATIONAL
for ANY REASON, especially for virus information or ordering help.you
can contact any of our worldwide Anti-virus centers. the address's to
ALL our worldwide centers have been listed in "AMIGA REPORT 114" or you
can just write us at the address below..

PRODUCT NAME

        GVP ioExtender (With version 1.7 software)


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

        The ioExtender is a Zorro II hardware product which expands your
Amiga 1500, 2000, 3000, or 4000 by two serial ports, one parallel port, and
one MIDI port, in an extensible manner.  The ioExtender is capable of any
speed from 1 to 614400 baud.  It also is designed to work cleanly with the
ports contained in the G-Force 040 accelerator.  However, I was not able to
test this.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

        Name:           Great Valley Products

LIST PRICE

        $149.00 (US), with mailorder prices ranging from $110 to $130.  I
paid $150, but in recent weeks the price seems to have dropped dramatically.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE

                Requires a Zorro II-capable Amiga.

                No extra RAM is required, but 1 megabyte minimum is my
                recommendation.

                Does not require a hard drive, but the documentation
                assumes that you are using one.

                Does not require any particular CPU.

        SOFTWARE

                None.


COPY PROTECTION

        None.  It's a Zorro II-based dongle. :)


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        Model used:     Amiga 3000
        RAM:    (Fast)  16 megabytes 70 nanosecond Static Column ZIPs
                (Chip)   2 megabytes 80 nanosecond DIPs
        Kickstart version 37.175
        Workbench version 38.30
        Tested with:    Commodore MPS-1270 InkJet Printer
                        SupraFAXModem V.32bis (ROM version 1.200H)
                        Best Data 'Smart One' 2400X


REVIEW

        I tested the ioExtender specifically with Terminus 1.926, AmigaUUCP
1.16D, DNet 2.10, GPFax 2.23, JR-Comm 1.02a, term 3.3, VLT 5.576, TrapDoor
1.80, TransAmiga BBS 1.1, and PrintManager 1.1.

        In the case of all of the above programs, I was able to merely set
my serial device and go.  Once the device was set, it was mechanically no
different than using the internal port.  However, there was a noticeable
performance increase.  CPU usage dropped drastically.

        Unfortunately, selecting the parallel port for printer use is not so
clean.  You have to use the supplied "GVPIOControl" program to intercept
parallel.device calls and route them to gvppar.device.  I do not blame this
on GVP, but on Commodore, since selecting which hardware port printer.device
uses isn't nearly as easy as selecting serial devices.  Audio digitizers
tend to hit the Amiga parallel port hardware directly; so this merely allows
you to use the I/O Extender to drive the printer, while the digitizer goes
along on its merry way, banging the internal parallel port.

        GVP supplies 1/3 of a disk full of support programs, including
the driver program, a port-interceptor program, a serial preferences
program, an interceptor-preferences program, a system-information program,
and a program which even improves native Amiga serial.device performance.

        The "GVPSerial" preferences program closely resembles the AmigaDOS
2.1 preferences, except for a few changes required for the board's nature
(e.g., selecting which particular port, and, if you have multiple ioExtenders
and/or a G-Force 040, which board).

        The "GVPIOControl" program allows you to redirect the serial.device
and parallel.device to the gvpser.device and gvppar.device, respectively.
However, one should have to do this only with the parallel.device, as most
properly written, modern programs allow you to select the serial device
driver.

        The "GVPIO" program simply goes in SYS:Expansion, and is the basis
for the software driver.

        The "GVPinfo" program provides general system information.  It
specifically recognizes the ioExtender, by full name.  It also displays
information customary to this type of program, such as particular chips, RAM
information, etc.  A similar program, Nic Wilson's "SysInfo", mistook the I/O
Extender for a GVP Series II SCSI Board.  Commodore's "ShowConfig" program
identified the board as a generic hard-drive controller, but provided no
specifics.

        The "GVPPatch" program breaks up DMA packets to allow better
serial.device performance, which I assume would work for other devices as
well.

        The board itself contains two very-high-speed DB9 serial ports, one
DB23 parallel port, one MIDI sub-port, and one expansion port.  The MIDI
port is a 9-pin port which attaches to an optional MIDI-expansion box.  This
box gives you full MIDI-expansion capability, via one "In" connector, three
"Out" connectors, and one "Thru" connector.  The expansion port is an
internal port directly on the board which allows later attachment of other
I/O related devices.  I have heard mumblings of Ethernet capability for this
port.


DOCUMENTATION

        Documentation is provided in a 44-page plastic-bound manual.  It has
instructions for board installation in the A2000 and A3000, but not for the
A4000.  It also has clear, concise information on the necessary software,
but doesn't document the "GVPinfo" and "GVPPatch" programs.  "GVPPatch" does
come with on-disk documentation.

        The documentation provides application examples for JR-Comm and
AmigaVision, but assumes that the user would know how to use these to
other programs.  (Not too difficult, however.)

        It provides information which I would deem appropriate for someone
who is moderately versed in Amiga specifics.  While not assuming the user is
a "technogeek" who knows the machine up and down, it is not for the weak at
heart either.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

        I like the fact that the ioExtender provided a fast, cheap,
addition to my system.  It provided additional ports which I had needed.

        I dislike the fact that the card was about 1 millimeter too large
for my A3000, requiring me to remove one of the beige clips which would
normally hold the front of the card in place.  This particular process is
fairly easy, and involves prying the clip out of place with a screwdriver.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        I have no real basis for comparison.  However, I do wish it had the
7 serial ports as per the Commodore A2232.  Those are only 19200 baud,
however.  You can't have everything.


BUGS

        None found.


VENDOR SUPPORT

        I have had no problems other than the clip removal, so have had no
need to contact GVP.


WARRANTY

        No conclusive warranty information given. I find this to be
disturbing, but not a deterring factor, as I have not ever seen or heard of
a problem with the board that a software upgrade did not fix.


CONCLUSIONS

        I am happy with my ioExtender. It seems to perform well and as
advertised.

        I give it a 4 out of 5, as I feel it should have installed cleanly
without the requirement of removing the clip near the front of the machine.
There is a lot of empty space on the board, and I believe the board could
have been manufacturered to require a lot less space.

/// Game Demos:  Which ones are worth it?
    -------------------------------------
    By Robert Niles


OK, all this is my own opinion (and that of my seven-year-old son) BUT 
here's a listing of what I figure to be our 5 most favorite playable 
previews within the "jump and run" style games (Contact appropriate
companies on how to purchase the full game). 
 
I'll start with the least favorite of the 5 and work my way to the number 
one (which was not agreed upon between my son and I).

These files (archived name in parenthesis) should be available on most 
BBSs and commercial online systems. All are available on @{"In The MeanTime" link P2-1}.
 


#5 - Super Caldron (DCD-SUPC.DMS) 
 
        Great graphics, no sound (on a 1MB Chip RAM machine, don't know if 
        this will be different for those who have more RAM). But good 
        original ideas!! You're a little Warlock who has this endless 
        supply of stones to throw around...pick up a broom here and there 
        and fly! ...but watch out for the buzzards!! 
 
 
#4 - RoboCod (ROBOCOD.LHA) 
 
        A funny new twist, more of an exploration type jump and run, but 
        plenty to do and lots of secret places to find. Your charactor is
	part robot, part fish running around, the second level is neat...
	never saw a fish jump so high!! 
 
 
#3 - Arabian Nights (ARABIAN.LHA) 
 
        Arabian Nights - another with great graphics. Secret places, the 
        bad guys, lots of "acid" lakes to jump over, and a small bit of 
        detective work will get you through the first level, then you're 
        off on a cart ride through some mines in a race against time to 
	finish off this preview. 
 
 
#2 - Woody's World (WOODYW.DMS) 
 
        Now you got this little guy, in in the true Super Mario fashion 
        you can have this little guy change into some sort of King, 
        who can finally throw some killer stars against the bad guys in 
        the land. Lots of "secret" places to keep you going after it again
	and again! Great graphics!
 
 
#1 - This one was tied.... 
 
     Traps-n-Treasures (TRSI_TNT.DMS) 
 
        REALLY good game, original ideas, some problem solving and LOTS 
        to explore!! You gotta a guy (a pirate) to run around with, there 
        are shops in which he can get more stuff to better his fighting 
        and to increase his health. There is plenty of underwater 
        swimming, as well as stuff on top for you land lubbers. 
        The only disadvantage here is some of the stuff is in German, 
        but this won't stop you from playing at all!! Avoid the pirates 
        on top and the sea animals below and explore! 
 
 
     Zool Demo (ZOOLDEMO.LHA) 
 
        Well of course you have heard of this one. You're an ant on a 
        high speed mission to get as much candy and junk as possible 
        while avoiding all moving creatures...lots to do here!! 
        AGA demo version is available also.

/// Rendered Reality                         "I Render, Therefore I Am."
    ----------------
    By Mike Troxell



                    "I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
                     For science it worked flawlessly.
                        Try using it for graphics!
                               Write in C."

Well, actually I used to write in COBOL, not FORTRAN.  And while I always
enjoyed writing in COBOL, I would'nt quite call it flawless, and it was
business, not science and... Anyway, the point is that while every
programming language has its area of expertise, every language also has its
limitations. I'd no more try to use FORTRAN for business than I would try
to write a graphics program in COBOL. This goes for computers as well.
Each computer has its own strengths and weaknesses.

This brings me to where I've been for the last few months. I've been
looking for a new computer. During the last year I've gone from doing
animations on a 2000 with a 40 MHz 68030, 40 MHz FPU, 9 megs of RAM and a
120 meg hard drive to working on a 1200 with two megs of RAM and a 40 meg
hard drive. Obviously, I haven't been doing any animation lately.  After
about two months with the 1200 I decided I had to have a bigger system.
Since I was basically going to have to put togeather a new system, I
decided to look at all the available platforms (yes, even PC's). What I
found was that for around $5000 I could put togeather the type of animation
system I wanted from any of the three main personal computer platforms,
(Amiga, IBM and Mac) as long as I was willing to put up with system and
software limitations.

I use IBM's at work every day so I started my search by looking at what was
available on the IBM. Not much is available in the way of (good) graphics
software under $1000.  But if there is a hardware peripheral that you can
think of, IBM's probably have it. Unfortunatly, they also have MS-DOS. Of
course there are several alternative OS's for the IBM but most of them
require a memory upgrade just to run them. Oh well, maybe when they finally
get a real OS (that doesn't require 10 megs of RAM and 80 megs of hard
drive space).

Next I looked at the Mac. This is where I was really tempted. True, they
don't have Lightwave, but they do have PhotoShop and several nice 3-D
programs. What the Macintosh doesn't have are custom chips to speed up
graphics, or a true multi-tasking OS (yet). I talked to one MacIntosh
salesman who admitted that while System 7 does have a "type of multi-
asking", he said he wouldn't recomend doing anything radical like rendering
an animation in the background while you were downloading a file from a
BBS, because the rendering would come to a near halt while the file was
being downloaded. Maybe having an Amiga has spoiled me, but I like being
able to run other programs while Imagine renders an animation. I proceeded
to cross the Mac off my list of possibilities.

So, where did that leave me? Back where I started, with the Amiga as the
only logical choice. By next month I should have my Amiga animation system
set up. I'm still a little nervous about spending this much money on an
Amiga when Commodore just reported a record loss (a little nervous?
Actually I'm on the verge of having a nervous breakdown!) but I don't see
any alternative short of spending $20,000+ for a Sun or SGI graphics work-
station. 

So, that's where I've been. Now, where am I going? Well, in the immortal
words of Buckaroo Bonzai "No matter where you go, there you are."  So I
guess we'll just have to see what develops. Graphics is a rapidly changing
field and what is new today may be old news tomorrow (which makes me even
more nervous about purchasing a new system). In the next few months I
expect to see even more graphics hardware and software products. That's
what I expect to see. What's going to really happen?  Like I said, I guess
we'll just have to wait and see, but no matter what happens I'm convinced
that with the Amiga I'll always be ready for it.


				-----------------------------


I talked to Centaur today and they said that the long awaited OpalVision
modules are being shown this week at WOC in Sydney, Australia, and that
they will be shown in America at SigGraph in early August.  They said the
modules would be shipping in America by late September at the latest.  

Essence II is available now to people on the Imagine mailing list, and
those who recieve the Apex newsletter. It should be shipping to stores
within a few weeks. 

I'll have more information on the OpalVision modules and Essence II next
issue.

/// Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users
    --------------------------------------



                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA or through Tymnet from anywhere in
North America.  If you have an account on another Internet-connected
system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet programs, from
anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users can now Telnet
into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 - Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files, online, 24 hours a day.
   Portal has dedicated a 2.5 GIGabyte disk drive to the Amiga Zone.
   We have virtually unlimited space for files and new uploads. 

 - The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable
   software, online.  All of it.  Every disk.  Well-organized so
   it's easy to find exactly what you're after.

 - Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

 - Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES,
   and many others including Compute's Amiga Resource with over
   4 Megabytes of exclusive Compute magazine disk stuff you won't find
   elsewhere.

 - 35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.  Since Portal has FTP connections we can get
   new freely-distributable software online within MINUTES of its 
   being announced on Usenet.

 - No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.  Start downloading
   files with your first session on Portal. 

 - Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.
   Instead of stumbling around in frustration you can talk to the
   people who design your hardware, who write your software.

 - Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

 - Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

 - FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
 - Portal has the Usenet.  Tthousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  Usenet feeds into Portal many times each hour.
   There are 14 Amiga-specific Usenet newsgroups with hundreds of
   articles posted every day, including postings by Commodore 
   personnel.  Since Usenet is distributed worldwide, your questions
   and answers can be seen by literally hundreds of thousands of
   people the same day you post them.  

 - Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

 - The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
 - Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
 - All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

 - Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

 - And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well.. it's true.

   Tymnet 9600bps services is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.

    By Joe Jernigan


I'd like to respond to Rex "The Catman" Morriss in AR103. Concerning his
accurate discussion of Commodore marketing, he is right on target and also
very generous in his effort to help (I'd offer to help, but I'm burned out
and need some help from C= before I can help).

 But what can be done?  The problem as I see it is the attitude of a single
man (and his "yes men" at the top with him).  At one time Jack Tramiel was
the marketing department of Commodore.  He was shrewd enough to realize
that without advertising/sales/marketing (something Irv deemed
unnecessary), the only thing to do was lower the price and increase demand.

That's what happened.  That's what worked. All the top cats at C= got very
rich *without* marketing the machine.  Therefore I suggest that it'd be
pretty hard to convince them that C= needs to market.  And when confronted,
they give excuses like 'we don't have the dealers to handle the demand,'
etc. (Wonder if it's because you chased them away or something :)  Also, to
avoid confrontation, they'll move the shareholder meeting to the Bahamas
*just to make it inconvenient* to get flamed/presented with the facts. In
the days of the 64, Commodore represented a good value.  I *used* to
recommend them to everyone.  I sold several and still haven't received my
commission check!  Now I downplay the machine to the new buyer.  Someone
might say, "What do you think about the Amiga?"  I'd say, "It's a pretty 
good machine," and leave it at that.

That's exactly the truth.  It is a pretty good machine.  The trouble is
the company that manufactures the machine has no grasp on selling the
thing. Amiga owners are probably the most computer savvy people around.
Many started with the 64 and subsequently got on the Amiga wagon.  The
problem is that IBM, and it's clonies/cronies, have created such a *name*
that that's all people know.  And I gave up (as I mentioned above)
explaining and educating a person why they would *want* (not necessarily
need) sound,  what linear addressing is, etc.  Most of 'em don't care,
they're not going to program anyway.  It's simply too much resistance to
overcome for me to "sell" somebody on the Amiga.  It used to be a little
easier before super VGA graphics and the slide of peecee hardware prices.

*That* was the help I got from C=.  *They* made it a good value which made
it easier for me to sell.  Now I just say go ahead and get a PeeCee because
chances are that they'll have some software to *choose* from in their tiny
specialized niche.  Most likely, there isn't even a program available for
the Amiga, much less a *choice*. I wonder if C= DID even start to market
the Amiga isn't it too late now.  Isn't the market pretty well saturated
with Mac's and PeeCee's (those "name brand" computers)?  It's one thing to
get a first time buyer to select a C=, and another to get somebody who
already owns an XT or 80286 or Mac "Classic" (whatever that is) to switch
platforms.  *What about my software?*  Well, Amax or Bridgeboard... But
here again -- I have to explain/educate the consumer about C='s product
line AND I'M NOT GETTING PAID FOR IT!  I'm making the Gould's richer and
all I get the satisfaction of knowing that I sold a superior machine and
also if they have questions, I'LL BE THE FIRST ONE THEY COME TO FOR HELP!!!

Starting to get the picture a little here C=?  In case not, I'll sum up.

1)  A precedence was set when C= got rich WITHOUT advertising.
2)  That's ok, but C= did not (IMNSHO) KEEP (it started off, yes) the 
    Amiga line a good value.
3)  That's ok, but you didn't have a MASSIVE advertising/educating the
    consumer as to WHY the Amiga is a superior machine (the "Stevie"
    commercial had little educational content).  BTW, I didn't see it on
    TV, my dealer had it on video tape and I borrowed it and watched it
    on my VCR.
4)  I don't mind being your sales force, but I DO mind being your VOLUNTEER
    sales force AND I feel I earn a little gratitude by having to answer
    incessant beginner questions.  I know that ethics dictate that in turn
    of someone helping me, I help someone else. I feel I've repaid my debt.
    I also feel C= could pay its debt to me by ADVERTISING THE BLOODY
    MACHINE so as to make my job of selling it easier. OK, got off here.
    Here's the point, and if I could drill one simple statement into C=,
    it would be:

    "Either lower the price and increase demand or advertise HEAVILY and 
    increase demand."

ASSUMING *you* want to increase demand.  *I* want you to increase demand
because that'd be a bigger market share resulting in more and varied
software and it'd help the C= volunteer sales force not have to waste time
educating the consumer as to WHY/HOW the Amiga is a superior machine.
Sounds like United We Stand America doesn't it!  Now, I know Irving (the
bomb) has heard the decree "Advertise the Amiga" before.  I can just
imagine his attitude.  It's my company, I can do what I want.  If I'm
satisfied, then everybody else should be too.  Let them go out and start a
computer company if they don't like it.  Well, OK Irv, but you've got to
know that everybody has a boss.  Whether you're an employee or have clients
or customers.  The customer is always right. Who would have thought that 
advertising/marketing would be an important criteria in computer ownership
satisfaction AFTER THE SALE!!!  It's like you have to keep advertising in
order to preserve brand loyalty or something!  The Amiga market is unique
in that its users ARE so savvy.  They're also the hardest working sales
force C= has.  You better believe me, they KNOW what's going on with other
platforms and the Amiga line is constantly being compared to the other
guys.  But the reverse isn't necessarily true.  As an example, most Mac
users think System 7 is a multitasking OS!
 
If I gave free advice, it'd probably be something like, "do what made the
64 a hit."  Offer a value.  Superior hardware (and leaving a CLOCK out of
the A1200 and not including documentation and a language [I've heard] ain't
it Irv) at a blow-the-others-away price.  Irving owes us that and if he
doesn't pay up, his US market might just wind up being a tiny niche (read
Toaster) machine.

/// Usenet Review:  Commodore Dynamic Total Vision
    ----------------------------------------------
    By THP
    (thp@sx.ac.uk)


PRODUCT NAME

        Commodore Dynamic Total Vision.

        Now known as Amiga CDTV since a remarketing strategy, and "You
	what?" by most non-Amiga followers.


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

#include <Design/Hardware/Software/Audio/Documentation/Expansion/Uses.h>

        Erm...  er...  Audio CD and interactive software player based around
Amiga 500 engine with CD-ROM drive and cut-down I/O peripherals, which can be
added on via the usual Amiga expansion sockets?  Read on.

        Since the CDTV first appeared on the market in August 1991, there's
been much confusion -- from the public, Amiga users, the magazines and
Commodore's marketing team themselves -- over what the machine actually
capable of, and which markets it is aimed at.  So, to put the record
straight, it's time to give a full breakdown of the CDTV, as I don't think
anyone else has done so yet.  Tsk.


KEEP IN MIND THAT...

        The author has moved to the CDTV from an A500 <0.5 meg Chip RAM, 1.5
meg Fast RAM, 2 drives>, a Technics stack, a desire to own a 'Pizza box'
machine, and a break-in... so the move was obvious.  AGA, Kickstart 3, and
ARexx won't get much of a mention.  The author is also aware of sarcasm and
irony.


COMPANY INFORMATION

        Name:           Commodore Business Machines, Inc.
        Address:        1200 Wilson Drive
                        West Chester, PA  19380
                        USA

        Name:           Commodore Business Machines UK Ltd.

        [Commodore has other offices in other countries as well.]


LIST PRICE

        Variable, due to different peripheral and software bundles at a range
of prices.  Currently <June 1993> in the UK, it varies from approximately 250
pounds for the standalone machine <Main box, Disk caddy + Tutorial CD, remote
control> up to approximately 450 pounds <same as above, plus keyboard,
mouse, external floppy drive, Lemmings disc, Fred Fish disc, possibly
more>.  Shop around, since the prices are being slashed each month, with
better and better value for the buyer.  Everyone's waiting for the new
Commodore CD-based console, so stores are clearing stock of CDTVs.


OBTAINING THE MACHINE

        I ordered the CDTV Multimedia package from Hobbyte <UK Mailorder
firm> in mid-February of this year, and after a couple of days of waiting, it
arrived, after a few calls explaining that the shop had to wait for another
Multimedia pack to come in.  The bundle as ordered consisted of:

        <Standard 'vanilla' CDTV pack>

        Amiga CDTV main box <Black>
        Remote Control <Black> plus batteries.
        CD Caddy <Black> with Tutorial CD
        Cables <Black> to hook it all together.
        Hookup booklet

        And: <'Basic Multimedia' pack>

        Wired Mouse <Black>
        Keyboard <Black. Quelle surprise>
        External Drive <Give you 3 guesses...>
        AmigaDOS 1.3 System disks and documentation

        Since then, I've borrowed <On very long-term ;-> a RocTec external
floppy drive <Not black.  Sobs> with slight personality problems, and that's
the complete system under review, apart from the colour portable TV I use as
a monitor.

        Nowadays, the CDTV is best obtained by mail-order, as few computer
shops <'Box shifters'> stock the machine due to lack of large-scale demand.
And so, it is rare to get 'hands-on' play-testing or demonstrations in shops,
resulting in public confusion and scepticism, leaving us right back with lack
of large-scale demand.  Great.


HARDWARE

        The CDTV main box is of similar dimensions as any standard Hi-Fi
'separate' component:  430mm <Width> x 330mm <Depth> x 95mm <Total Height>.
It is completely black, with 15mm high cylindrical silver feet:  very gothic
and stylish.

        On the front, you've got <From left to right>:  Main power switch with
6.5mm stereo headphone jack, the CD caddy slot with eject button and power
indicator <And high-pass audio filter ;-> and CD active indicators in green
and yellow, to the left and right of the CD slot, respectively.

        Then the indicator panel with the headphone volume level <Graduated
scale>, CD track number, and realtime clock display both in cyan, and a 'CD'
video indicator, and finally, the CD audio controls along with a soft-reset
switch and a CD/TV video switch.

        A trapdoor under the indicator panel reveals a credit-card slot to
allow the use of RAMcards for saving 'data from applications'.  <High Score
tables, in other words>.  The options are 64K and 256K.  I've yet to see them
on sale.  A PCMCIA slot would have been far more useful, especially for
memory expansion.

        The entire design is very swish, and would sit nicely at the base of
a Technics or Denon Hi-Fi stack.  'Cool' is an understatement.  It's
gorgeous.  Probably the best-looking Amiga machine yet.

        Along the back, there's the usual Amiga ports:  external floppy
drive, serial, parallel, RGB out, and audio left/right.  Because the machine
was designed to sit next to the household VCR, there are appropriate RF
connectors below the RGB socket, according to country of retail.  In the UK,
we get RF in, RF out and Composite Video out.  In the States, you get
S-Video instead of RF in.  The Euromachine gets a SCART socket.  The RF
modulator is thus inside the machine, as is the power transformer.  The
socket is a standard 'kettle' connection with a mains plug at the other end
of the lead.  There's a fan in the back, which sucks air through the machine
from the vents on the top and sides.  There's a lot of machinery in the box
<Amiga 500 and CD player in the space of a normal CD player>, so it needs
whatever cooling it can get.

        The keyboard socket is a weird miniature DIN configuration, as is the
wired mouse socket.  No joystick ports -- a major design screwup.  However,
there's a pair of MIDI connections <In/Out> and a removable plate labelled
'Expansion', which can have a SCSI interface <Commodore's own or a third
party widget> installed for adding extra storage.  There's an internal
genlock available as well.  Good, eh?

        The remote control acts as mouse and joystick, and has buttons for
the digits 0 to 9, ENTER, ESCAPE, GENLOCK, CD/TV, JOY/MOUSE.  The additional
buttons REW, PLAY/PAUSE, FF, STOP are mainly for audio CDs.  Finally, there
are headphone volume controls, a power switch, a joypad, and buttons A and B
for selection, like most console keypads have.  Normally, the remote is in
"MOUSE mode," where the joypad controls mouse movement <with autorepeat>, A
and B act as Left and Right mouse buttons respectively, CD/TV switches the
video output between the CDTV's own output and what's coming in via the RF
input <same as pressing the CD/TV switch on the main box>, and GENLOCK
overlays the CDTV output onto the RF input if you've got the internal
genlock.  The CD and volume controls have the same priority as the controls
on the main box.

        If you switch the machine off from the handset, you have to switch it
back on from the handset.  The main power switch is likewise.  Same system as
my Technics receiver used to have.  Notice that Hi-Fi analogy again.

        When in Joystick mode, the only active controls on the remote are the
joypad and the A and B buttons.  Problem is, they're very unresponsive, with
no microswitches, and have an extremely unreliable action when playing.
Apart from low-movement games like Lotus Turbo 2, where accurate left /
right / up / down / fire action isn't needed, they're complete and utter
crap.  Don't even think about playing Llamatron, Gods, or anything needing
fast response.

        Commodore's answer to this is the 'Brickette', which costs around 45
pounds and plugs into the mouse socket.  It gives a trailing lead with 2
standard joystick/mouse sockets at the end, and the intelligence to recognize
which method of input is being used.  Because it sits on the mouse port, you
have to buy a new standard mouse to go with it.

        There's a third-party solution which relies on internal fitting,
designed by Almathera <Producers of CDPD, Fractal Universe etc.> and sold by
GoldTech, called CD-Joy, which does the same thing and doesn't take up the
mouse port <according to Jolyon Ralph at Almathera, who designed it>, and
sells for about 25 pounds.  I've yet to test either of these <some of us
don't have jobs or spare cash floating around>, but I've got to upgrade
soon.  As usual with Commodore vs. Third Parties, you must weigh losing your
warranty against better hardware performance.  C'est la vie.

        The keyboard?  Black, virtually identical to the A2000 keyboard, with
a 50" partly coiled cable, and a nice key action.  A massive improvement on
the somewhat 'dead' feel to the A500 keyboard, with a 3-position angle
adjust.  Oddly, there are two blank keys that have no function and are
documented in an accompanying leaflet as 'not having any function'.  Only
with Commodore. ;->

        The wired mouse <black> is the next generation from the old
A500/A2000 mouse, having a curved back <like a Naksha, but the CBM mouse is
curved along its length and around the back end> and large buttons that are
flush with the back of the mouse.  The buttons are sized in a 60:40
<Left:Right> ratio, very comfortable to use with Intuition, but unfortunately
not microswitched.

        The external drive <black: what did you expect?> is larger than the
average third-party external drive, has a yellow 'in use' LED to match the CD
drive and the 'CD-video out' indicators <nice touch>, but for some insane
reason, doesn't have a pass-through port.  And there are few drives that
match it either in styling or colour.  Tsk!

        As for the operating system, it's based on Kickstart 1.3, with the 1
meg ECS Agnus, the standard Denise, and 1 meg of Chip RAM onboard.  The
processor is a 7MHz 68000.  This version of AmigaDOS has been around long
enough that everyone should know what it's about, so I don't need to
reiterate previous reviews, which should come as a relief.  It has all those
classic OS bugs you love to hate.

        There's a realtime clock, displayed at all times, as witness the
display panel description, but it isn't battery-backed.  The machine has
private RAM for internal Preferences settings.  This means that whenever you
unplug the main unit, you have to reset the clock.  Oh joy.  External
preferences are no problem, as the machine uses the standard 1.3
DEVS:system-configuration file when booting from floppy or hard disk.


DOCUMENTATION

        The 'Hookup' manual is just that.  A page of 'Contents of the box',
two pages of 'Plug the leads in here, here and here', and you're left booting
the Welcome disk as the manual switches language.  The 'Multimedia' pack
ships with Workbench 1.3, so I got the Workbench boot disk, the Workbench
Extras disk and The Very First, which is the Workbench tutorial disk.

        There is no copy of the AmigaBasic manual, nor the equivalent of the
A500 Manual <which documents Workbench usage as well as a lot of VERY useful
schematics, ANSI escape codes and pinout diagrams>.  Just the Enhancer
Software manual.

        Maybe the others had been forgotten when packing all the bits into
the 3x2x2 foot box the machine came in - I wasn't fussed.  I've still got all
my old A500 manuals which weren't nicked with the machine, and rarely need to
refer to them nowadays.  Besides, I'd used 1.3 <almost exclusively from the
shell> for nearly 2 years; so once I'd run through the Welcome CD a couple of
times, I skimmed through the Workbench disks to see if anything had changed.
Nothing had, so I reached for my old all-singing-all-dancing system disk and
booted up.

        Lack of documentation is no problem for an old<ish> hand like myself,
but I don't know how 'Joe Punter' would manage.


THE WELCOME DISK

        Booting the Welcome disk gives a couple of title screens, a extremely
average soundtrack module whilst loading, and the main menu, offering a 'How
to use CD titles' interactive tutorial, a 'Tech' guide and an 'Available
Software' section.

        The tutorial is essentially an explanation of the remote control
functions and how to select options from on-screen menus, which is fairly
obvious anyway, but it's there if you really need it.

        The 'Available Software' section is simply a batch of title screens
and voiceovers split into categories like Entertainment, Reference,
Education, etc.  Note how some titles don't have a screenful of graphics but
just the title name in a simple font.  It'd be interesting to contrast
what's actually been written against the expectations of the disk.

        Most useful is the 'Tech' section, which explains the expansion
options and the CD-audio panel.  It also shows use of the internal system
preferences adjustment, but doesn't tell you how to get to it.  <Press
anything whilst the 'Insert disk' boot animation is showing, folks>

        The coding quality on the disk is about the same as that in 'The Very
First'.  'Desert Dream' from Kefrens it isn't, but it gets the job done, with
an initially-cheery-then-rapidly-becoming-bloody-irritating 'ping' at each
selection prompt.  Luckily there's a certain amount of logic in the
programming - you can skip irrelevant parts of the audio playback <although
not the loading times> and graphics, and on going back up the disk menu
structure you don't get information repeated.  Just as well, given that the
female voice on the disk sounds like she's being indecently tickled, and the
male could pass as a member of the National League of Depressives whilst on
an acid trip.  Who ARE these people?

        If the truth were known, it's more interesting to hack the disk from
AmigaDOS to see how it's all supposed to work.  To be honest, it's a bit of a
botch job, as witness the first line of the s:startup-sequence:

        ;THIS STARTUP-SEQUENCE IS TOO GODDAMN CLUTTERED !  RE-WRITE IT !

Temper, temper.  So much for the glamorous world of programming CBM
introductory software.  This isn't all:  there's a load of unused demo
scripts, graphics, discarded sound samples and credit screens that should
have gotten wiped before the disk went to print.  See what you can find.

        The disk uses the preferences as set in the machine's private RAM,
which include:  language of user, screen position, screensaver timeout <yep,
there's one built in>, keyclick toggle when using the CD-Audio panel, clock
mode <12/24 hour> and setting, and a video sync toggle.  This is downloaded
as the working system-configuration by the program CDTVPREFS.

        The audio sections of the disk amount to 49 megs of data split across
444 files.  Bear in mind that this is a 58 meg disk, according to c:Info.
All are standard IFF samples, so you can play around with them with the
music program ProTracker.  This is why you really notice the loading time
during the longer sentences in the 'Tech' and 'Available' sections - the CD
drive speed isn't really fast enough for file-dependent software.  Strange
that CBM didn't just use the 'direct-from-disk' long sample player available
in the public domain.  It may be that the data throughput isn't fast enough,
but it'd speed the loading up.  Separating the disk into AudioCD and Amiga
partitions wouldn't be worth it - there are too many separate audio sections.

        The graphics are all IFF ILBM images - use Mostra or another IFF
picture viewer to skim through them.  I recommend a viewer that supports
command line wildcards.  The 'voiceover beings' aren't listed in the 'hidden
credits' screens.  Probably due to reasons of acute embarrassment and public
ridicule, no doubt.


CDTV IN ACTION

        My normal working system is based around the ARP shell and commands,
with CygnusEd <used to write this>, DiskMaster 1.4 <a Directory Opus clone>,
MessyDos and PowerPlayer.  All run perfectly, apart from ARP's 'assign' now
refusing to accept multiple assignments in a single command line.  Weird.

        Programming with SAS/C is just about possible with a meg of RAM and
a single drive, but it would be better if the compiler and header files were
distributed on CD.  The boot disk would contain just the shell of
preference, the editor and the user's source code.  The header and library
assignments would be linked across onto the CD.  To get at the compiler
itself, just add the CD directories to the executable path.  Not as fast as
a hard drive, but better than floppy, and easier and more reliable to
distribute.

        The first main thing you notice is that the CD filing system and
handling routines grab 150K of Chip RAM workspace as AmigaDOS boots up.
There isn't an option to switch the device drivers off, either.  The RAMdisk
is thus fairly limited.  Anything over 400K is pushing it, or there isn't
enough workspace for DMS or LhA to work.  Don't bother loading Workbench if
you need RAM workspace.  That, or get hold of an external drive with a
pass-through port.  It's just as well the machine isn't based around
Kickstart 2.04, since the memory shortage would be chronic.

        Multitasking with more that 2 big utilities or hitting the RAMdisk
fragments the memory very quickly - this machine desperately needs a Fast RAM
expansion.  There is a hardware dongle <from GoldTech, in UK> that disables
the CD drivers but still allows audio CD playback, but - you've guessed it -
it's an internal fitting.  Goodbye warranty....

        Some software doesn't like the CD device when running or uncrunching.
Large executables, such as ProTracker and DPaint, can be extremely awkward
when PowerPacked.  Assorted demos and games fall over as well, due to either
memory requirements or hardware differences.  Sometimes both.  Marble Madness
won't run despite the machine's being based around Kickstart 1.3 <could be
the 1 meg Agnus OR the CD drive>, and StarGlider won't format its gamesave
disks.  More modern games released since Kickstart 2 are better, due to the
new machines' forcing software compatibility.  No problems with ThunderHawk,
Lotus 2 or Pinball Fantasies.  The same goes for demos - anything that is
2.xx compatible should be OK co-existing with the CD drivers.  1.3 stuff
varies from piece to piece, but the CD switch should fix this.

        When things crash the system, you'll get the usual 'Software Failure:
Retry / Cancel' alerts, but rarely a Guru meditation.  What would normally
give a Guru just throws up a soft reset, accompanied by a whirr as the CD
drive resets its head and the screen kicks back to the bootup animation.
Odd.

        Talking of resets - the RESET switch on the front of the main box is
vary badly positioned.  I often run a BBC Micro into the back of the CDTV via
the serial port for file transfers to the Amiga BBC Emulator <which works
perfectly>.  When checking things at the BBC end <the BBC RF Out goes into
the RF throughport on the CDTV> with the CD/TV switch, I've got to be fairly
accurate with the thumb to avoid hitting RESET and killing the machine.  Why
the hell wasn't this switch put under the main power switch, and the
headphone jack moved to here?  Gawd knows what it's like when you start
genlocking...

        The CD caddy mechanism gives a resounding 'Clungg!' on insertion, and
the manual eject has an action similar to an external drive.  You've got to
have a reasonably positive action, or the caddy can jam.  Pity it's not a
motorized drawer, given the CD-Audio marketing side, but there's precious
little free space in the main box, and all of that is needed for ventilation.
The fan in the back is quieter than the A2000 fan, and is pretty ignorable.
I'm not sure how expandable the system is re power requirements, but 2
external drives are no problem.  This may be the reason the CDTV drive has no
pass-through port - CBM was unsure about PCB burnout due to overload from
external power requirements, so they didn't want to risk multiple drives?
Surely not.

        As to the CDTV and Audio CDs - according to the CDTV information
flyers, the sound quality is supposed to be 16bit x 8 oversampling.  It's as
good as my Technics stack was, when you run it through the phono jacks into a
stack system, as every Amiga should be used.  Through the RF modulator output
to the TV, the audio level is rather low.

        The CD Audio panel frontend is extremely easy to use, and has all the
functions of a full CD player, including Time to Disk End, Time to Track End,
Disk Time, Track Time, 10 second Introscan, Randomize and full random
programming up to 16 tracks.  It's a pity all these features can't be
accessed from the main box displaypanel, only via the video output, because
it means I've got to lug the TV along with the CDTV to where the good hi-fi
tapedeck is.  In another room.  After going down a flight of stairs.  And
unplugging means losing the clock and internal preference settings.  Life is
fun.

        And that internal screensaver?  We can just assume it only applies
when the CDTV internal preferences are being used, as I've yet to see it in
action when booting from floppy.

        One thing that the manual doesn't tell you, and this is a biggie, is
that you can start up an Audio CD during ANY POINT of system operation.
<Assuming you're not using the CD drive, obviously.>  What you've got is the
CD hardware being under control of software when required, but with full
manual override from the controls on the main box.  An example of this is the
Audiopanel mode of the CDTV.  Press PLAY on the front of the CDTV, and the
disk will start, but the software doesn't register this, and movement of the
selection cursor will still result in a keyclick.  When PLAY or STOP is
selected by software, it doesn't affect the hardware override.  Sometimes the
software link to the CD hardware can crash for no reason, but it's rare.

        The Amiga audio is directly laid on top of the CD Audio.  The Amiga
output has always been at a higher level than most Hi-Fi component output
levels - as anyone who runs an Amiga into a stack system will tell you.  Same
with the CDTV.  Problem is, the CD output is at normal Hi-Fi levels, and thus
when you run both at once, the Amiga tends to drown out the CD if there's a
constant noise level or tune happening on the Amiga side of the system.

        Volume levels aside, we're talking hitting PLAY from ANYWHERE.
Workbench, bootup, or system-trashing games.  Seemingly Contradictory Fact
#1:  disk-based games are superb on a CDTV!

        Having your own choice of CD soundtrack whilst playing games is a
positive boon, and adds a whole new atmosphere.  Games that have their own
in-game music <e.g., Turrican 2 and Pinball Dreams/Fantasies> don't work well
with this technique, as the music is usually out of tune/tempo with your CD,
and combining the two sounds dire.  Games with only spot-effects or a constant
throb work best.  The only thing is the Amiga tends to drown the CD out when
producing throbs.  The best results are obtained with CDs that are mastered
with a loud signal.

        THP Recommends:  If you thought Lotus 2 was good, try it with 'Angel
Dust' from Faith No More blasting out in the background.  Or StarGlider 2
with Jean-Michel Jarre?  Thunderhawk with Metallica?  BLAZEMONGER with Cher?
[MODERATOR'S NOTE:  BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED recommends that you play Bing
Crosby and "Great Head-On Train Collisions Of The 1980's" simultaneously.
- Dan]

        As to CD-based games - most use the CD only as a way of avoiding
disk swaps.  Few have separate data/audio partitions - the only one of note
is Sim City, where a full studio-mastered audio soundtrack plays during the
game.  Obviously, there's only spot-effects from the Amiga side, with the CD
audio being under software control.  The Lemmings soundtracks won't improve
<sob>, but at least you can play the game via ParNet.

        It'd be interesting to see if the 'Scene picks up on this, and release
any productions <they're not demos any more> that use a certain audio track as
the basis for the design, graphics and coding, with special effects overlaid
by the Amiga audio hardware. The mind boggles.

        Back with AmigaDOS, if you start an audio CD before the Amiga goes
over to the Workbench screen, the digital output will hang.  AmigaDOS
checking to see which drives are attached and what's in everything,
obviously not expecting to find 'Happiness' from the Beloved in a drive...

        The boot preference sequence appears to be the following:

     [Floppy?] -> [CD-ROM/CDAudio?] -> [Hard drive?] -> [Bootup Animation]

as the CDTV will recognize Audio and CDTV disks but still check the external
drive first.  One big advantage of having all floppy drives fitted externally
is that if the boot drive dies, replacement is very easy, and a wide choice of
replacement mechanisms are available.

        Speed of directory access on the CD drive <CD0: comes up on any
standard filerequesters> is slow via the shell, but with the Req or ReqTools
requesters, is very fast.  300 files in 2 seconds isn't bad.

        Not quite so impressive is the data transfer rate - a quick shell
utility for timing file access that I hacked together in C reckons a 220K
file takes around 5.15 seconds <average> to suck off disk.  The
still-to-spin disk start adds another 1.7 seconds onto that.  The disk spin
timeout <a drive motor saver?> cuts in when no files are accessed, or, when
using Audio CD, if the system is paused or not playing for around 8
minutes.  OK, these benchmarks aren't breaking any records when compared to
the double-speed drives now available; but if you're not using the system
for file-based games which load massive files all the time, I can't see the
problem.

        I've yet to test out the genlocking capabilities of the machine,
and the MIDI interfaces and ParNet, due to lack of cash.


EXPANSION

        At the time of writing, there's no standard way to expand the memory
with Fast RAM, although the 'Blizzard' board <specifications unknown> is
currently being thrashed out and will be with us soon.  The CD-Switch may
suffice for those just requiring the full 1 meg.  The SCSI adapter <various
suppliers> is an excellent move, making the CDTV useful as a cheap
mass-storage device.  Gamers have got to get some form of standard joystick
interface:  either the Brickette or CD-Joy.  CPU acceleration is only
possible through systems relying on the 68000 CPU socket.

        The machine can be expanded to the SuperAgnus with 2 megs of Chip RAM
via the MegaChip board - some CDTV suppliers will fit this as an optional
extra before shipping the machine.  It is possible to upgrade the operating
system to Kickstart 2.04, but the CD driver chips also need replacing, and
they currently aren't widely available.  Without memory expansion, a
Kickstart upgrade is ill advised.


BEST USES

                                The EuroScene
                                -------------

        Because it's still based around Kickstart 1.3, the CDTV is the last
machine to feature the 'classic' chipset.  With the CD-Switch, all the big 1
meg demos <e.g., 3D Demo 2> and productions that conflict with the CD.device
will work, although some older works may still require that half meg of
trapdoor SlowFastRAM that used to sit in the A500.  A standard joystick
interface is a must, obviously.  And at 'scene gatherings, play your own CDs
whilst coding/copying/gfxing, all from one power socket. ;->

        'Scene musicians also get a look in, with the MIDI sockets as standard
<can we have them used in the next version of ProTracker?>, and the CD output
plugged straight back into a sampler on the parallel port. Never again
experience that 'Oh f*ck! 5 minutes to the deadline and I need a sample from
that CD back at home!' feeling. Assuming you've got the CD to hand. ;->

        It's also possible to jam over Audio CDs via MIDI <either the MIDI
sockets or just into the serial port>, or even playing lead guitar through a
sampler and blasting the output over a CD track.  And if we don't say anything
about Karaoke-thru-sampler-over-CD, hopefully everyone will have the good
taste not to try it.


                                    Games
                                    -----

        Likewise, Kickstart 1.3 means all the classic games will run,
although the CD-Switch and a 'stick interface are vital.  The predicted
'trend' towards releasing games on CD means future compatibility as well,
albeit without the AGA chipset.  Versions of Kickstart don't usually make
much difference to game quality. The possibility of selecting your own audio
soundtrack for games is an added bonus. And massive games for the future?

        Eye of the Beholder on CD?  The original came on 3 disks, and, being
AmigaDOS-based, was hard drive installable.  Consider 660 megs of dungeons,
missions and chaos, with no disk grind or swap.  Failing that, how about a
CD-quality in-game soundtrack?

        Elite 2?  Frontier?  Whatever it's going to be called, the scale of
this one when released on CD is just IMMENSE.  The original BBC version had
2000 planets spread through 8 galaxies, with loads of extra information,
realtime fly-by-wire docking computers, combat, trading and exploration.  In
100k.  We know Dave Braben's using an A2000 with an 030 as his working
machine, but what about CD?  If not 660 megs of planets and missions - how
about an exclusive music score by Jarre or Huelsbeck?  Okay then, a selection
of modules from Nuke, Greg, LizardKing and Jester?  Either would be great.

        Lotus 2, Thunderhawk, F15 and their ilk have been discussed already
with regard to in-game music.  CD also stops the drives grinding under
trackdisk, though.  Pinball Dreams/Fantasies could be expanded with extra
tables and music.  The trick with the audio is to get the relative Amiga/CD
overlay volume levels correct.  Software houses - are you reading this?


                         Communications / Networking
                         ---------------------------

        Many people on UseNet are using a CDTV as a CD Fileserver via ParNet
with great success.  Add this idea to a BBS machine <often an A2000/A3000
with the multiple serial port card>, and you've immediately got 660 megs of
online downloadable software, which can be swapped for another batch in a few
seconds.  Add a SCSI tower case <No restriction of mechanism physical size>
plugged into the SCSI expansion, and that's one HELL of a fileserver.  The
speed of CD access isn't so important in this situation, as no modem yet can
download at over 50k/second, so the relatively low CDTV data transfer rate
isn't important.

        If AmigaNetworking ever takes off <Ha!>, the possibilities are even
greater.  The obvious archive disks such as the Fish collections and the AB20
and AmiNet snapshots would be interest enough; but on a mixed machine-type
system, clip art, samples and typefaces would be a major bonus.
        
        Finally, the CDTV offers an alternative to a normal CD-ROM drive,
when used with ParNet.  Printers can still be used by squirting data onto the
serial port of the CDTV through the NET: handler.  Given that it's also a
separate computer, it can act as a leisure/hackabout machine, leaving the
'serious' power-machine to run Real 3D, Imagine, Morph, TVPaint, etc., with
no risk of virus-trashing, Lemmings-at-3am urges, and abuse-from-children.
You can even run all those CDTV titles without any compatibility problems
<Surprise surprise! ;->> and not have to bother installing the CDFilesystem.

        Best of all, you can do all this with just the basic machine and a
spare external drive.  Set up a systemdisk with the startup-sequence running
ParNet and NetMount, and possibly even Workbench and PowerPlayer so you can
play modules whilst you're at it ;->, plug in the ParNet cable, and boot up!


FOR THE FUTURE <Or 'Gripes and Praises'>

      If the new CD console is going to be based around AGA and an '020,
I'd like to see:

STANDARD JOYSTICK PORTS!        <Auuughhhh!>

Kickstart 3.xx

More MIDI support

DSP for direct off-CD sampling  <Will catapult machine into serious music
                                 market with regard to Atari Falcon>

Keep the design and styling     <Superb>

RF pass-through port            <Excellent for watching TV/datalink/genlock>

USABLE JOYPAD                   <Auuughhhh! again...>

Pass-through port on external   <PSU problems? Either way, no other drives
drive                            match it...>

Internal Genlocking             <Great concept>

SCSI                            <Another winner! SCSI2 next time?>

RAM Expansion                   <Can we have some? Please? Credit Card slot
                                 turned into PCMCIA slot?>

RESET switch                    <How's the BBC dataliaaaauuuggghhh...>

Real-Time Clock, Internal Prefs <Nice touch. BATTERY BACKING! Sheesh...>

Welcome Disk                    <More usefulness than comedy value, next
                                 time, people?>

                               Further WishList
                               ----------------

Volume controls for Amiga & CD? <Independent volume levels - much more
                                 flexible for game soundtrack mixing>

All Audio functions on Display  <It'd be damn useful - go on, you know you
panel?                           want to...>

Networking interface?           <TCP/IP running over Ethernet. Would make
                                 brilliant entry-level LAN fileserver with
                                 NFS>


CONCLUSIONS

        In case it's not blatantly obvious, I'm extremely pleased with the
CDTV and its capabilities.  Mind you, it's not that I've got a choice of
another machine.  My first upgrade will probably be a CD-Joy and a CD-Switch,
then a long hard look at the Blizzard board when it finally turns up.  And
finally, if I ever get some serious cash together, I'd like one of the SCSI
interfaces.

        Either way, if I ever get a top-end machine, I'm keeping this one as
well. ;->

@node P1-11 "Clones of the old Arcade"
@toc "menu"


/// Send in the Clones:  Arcade classics available on the Net
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    By Marcus Albers
    (malbers@ns.ccsn.edu)


I have been playing video games for 10, maybe 13 years, ever since
we bought a Sears Pong Game System. It had Tennis, Squash, Single
Tennis, and Hockey. It was an amazing system for its time. Then I
found the video arcade. Such classics as Dig Dug, Donkey Kong, Pac-
Man, Space Invaders....
 
I always wanted to play these games again on my Amiga. When you
compare these games with the playability of some of the newer games,
the new ones stink. They like to replace flashy graphics and digitized
sound effects for good old fashioned playability.  I have more fun in
an arcade with Galaga than with Super C. Well, if there are any others
out there that feel the same as me, help is on the way. On the Net,
without much pain (just a little downloading time) you can have many
arcade classics, most Amiga-tized to take advantage of the superior
technology of the Amiga, without losing playability. Be forewarned,
many of these games are extremely addicting. Consult a physician if
constant replaying persists.
 
*** Pac-Man ***
 
This excellent game appears to be one of the most cloned games ever.
I have found a number of clones based on the Pac-Man theme, i.e.
little yellow man eats dots in a maze and stays away from the
ghosties.  I have found a few clones of this on the Net, some true to
the original, others a little further out there.
 
Deluxe Pac-Man
 
This is by far the best port to computer of Pac-Man that I have ever
seen, on any system. The graphics are superb, and the sound is quite
good.  Good theme music, as well.
 
This game is your basic Pac-Man, with a lot of extras, in the form of
power-ups that appear under the ghostie starting place (where the
fruit appears in the old game). Some of the power-ups include a
speed-up that doubles the speed of Pac-Man, to let you get that last
little dot before the ghosties gobble you up. Another one is the glue,
which slow the ghosties down a mite.  The best one, IMHO, is the gun.
This turns Pac-Man into a maze/shoot'em up. One of the best graphic
enhancements has to be the fact that when you die, or the level ends,
there is sort of a video zoom which looks extremely cool.
 
Wack Man
 
This is an interesting implementation of the Pac-Man theme. It does
away with the standard maze design and uses a more free design theme,
causing the mazes to look more like the blocks of the old Tank Combat
game on the Atari 2600.  The character view is a top-down view of the
Pac-Man character, and a side view of the ghosts (?). The movement of
the player's character is very unobstructed, unlike the linear
movement of the old Pac-Man game. There is no facility for diagonal
movement, making it feel more like an old Commodore 64 game. The music
is fairly good, making it about the only redeeming quality of this
attempt at a clone.
 
Mouth-Man
 
There is not much to say about this one. It looks like the Atari-Soft
implementation for the C64. Plays about the same and sounds about the
same as well. It is good for nostalgia, but not much more. One
difference that this one has is that it contains a maze editor.
Unfortunately, I found nothing more to attract me to this game.
 
Fruit Panic.
 
Its Pac-Man gone Jumpman! The characters are there, looking more on
the line of the characters from the Pac-Man cartoon and Pac Land video
game. You utilize jumping and elevators to gobble up all of the fruit
on the levels of the screen. I like the interesting approach, but
there are a lot of control enhancements that could be made, like
smoother movements, and better jump comtrol.  Overall, an OK game.
 
Snackman
 
I have two words for this one - stay away. It is an exceptionally long
file for such a poor program. If you like to listen to a good MOD,
take the music off of the intro and trash the rest. There is little
sound in the game, no graphic enhancements, and the ghosts have no AI
system, which even the first Vic-20 conversion had (by the same name,
interestingly enough).  Not worth the download time, IMHO.
 
*** Space Invaders ***
 
The first ever alien shoot'em up game to hit the arcades, Space
Invaders took the video game industry by storm. It has been ported to
just about every home system and computer system. Not much has changed
(not counting Super Space Invaders) from the original, which remains
one of my favs.
 
Ameoba
 
This is the only conversion that I know of for the Amiga, and an
excellent one it is, too. It stays very true to the original, keeping
graphics colourful, yet not obtrusive. This is enhanced by game
responce that is as good, if not better, than the original arcade
version.
 
Not to appear two-faced, I have to say that I like the fact that this
was a direct port from the arcade version, whereas I liked the
enhanced version of Pac-Man. The reason that I like this direct
conversion is simply because I seemed to like Space Invaders more than
Pac-Man, and I always wanted to know what Pac-Man would be like with
more stuff (not having played Super Space Invaders, I may be somewhat
biased). Also, the "direct" conversions of Pac-Man where simply not as
good as this one. Enough of the disclaimer....
 
Ameoba is very user friendly, and multi-tasks excellently. As I said
previously, the game has no major graphical enhancements, but the game
itself is sold on excellent game play.  Who cares if it is ancient!
 
 
Next week, we will look at clones of Asteroids, Boulderdash (a C64
CLASSIC), Omega Race, and others, including the not so ancient (but
definitely cloned) Tetris, in Send In the Clones II: I Think I'm a
Clone Now.
 
 
Internet FTP sites, authors, and addresses are available upon request
from me via E-mail, malbers@ns.ccsn.edu. Maybe I was too lazy to write
all of the information down before I started this article. Maybe I
just like to recieve E-mail.

/// The Humor Department           Jokes, Quotes, Insults, Shameless Plugs
    --------------------



From Josh Farley on Fidonet's Amiga International echo...


Due to a couple of questions regarding the following, and with the humblest
of apologies to David Letterman...


             TOP 10 Reasons "*BM" is written here as "*BM"...


10.  Due to its highly UNgraphic nature, it cannot be viewed in its
     entirety without the accompaniment of an adult.

9.   `Ass-Backward ugly oversized garbage disposal' takes up too much room.

8.   Cursing isn't allowed.

7.   Forgot the first letter.

6.   Superstition- say it, and you may end up with one.

5.   OUR wrists don't bend that way.

4.   Don't want to get reply reading---`U-B-M?  Hey, I be Q!'

3.   Thought of Windows causes severe hand spasms that register as `*'.

2.   Two words- Big Brother

AND THE NUMBER ONE REASON THAT "*BM" IS WRITTEN AS "*BM"...

(crescendo...)

The Amiga's auto-destruct sequence just happens to be IB-

NO CARRIER
