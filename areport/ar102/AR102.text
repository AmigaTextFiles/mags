 Ah, Spring is in the air.  Amazing how little more than a week ago, we
 were digging out of the worst snowstorms in over a hundred years.  Now,
 the birds are singing, it's warming up, and everything is just about
 back to normal.

 Spring means change; a new beginning.  Commodore appears to be trying very
 hard to please.  The announcement of the 4000/030 is another step toward
 helping to make the Amiga a more widely recognized alternative to the
 inferior, "me too" computers -- IBM and compatibles.

 Sure, even Commodore has its flaws.  The lack of AmigaDOS and ARexx
 manuals with the A1200, and some of the production problems with the
 machine aren't going over too well.  But this newest low-end entry is
 selling like mad.  Nobody can keep them in stock, and people are saying
 it may be the next Commodore 64.  Wouldn't that be great?

 Our first issue was a smashing success!  Comments have been coming in from
 all over.  The only real complaint was the length of the Emplant thread
 from GEnie.  We realized it was long to begin with, but it was just too
 entertaining to cut much of it out.  With that said, you can be sure we
 won't run something quite so long in the future, at least without good
 reason.  This week's STR Online still contains some interesting messages,
 but they're not all one thread.

 At the request of our readers, we will no longer right-justify our text.
 They told us it was hard to read with the extra spaces between words.

 An idea we've been kicking around for a while is converting the magazine
 to a graphic format.  I'm not sure how well it would go over, so I thought
 I'd just ask.  Would you, our readers, like to see us go graphic?  We'd be
 using a program such as Notebook, from Black Belt systems.  It has a
 freely distributable reader, so you wouldn't have to own the program to
 read the magazine.  The advantages are being able to make the magazine
 appear more like a "real" paper-based magazine, to add some pictures here
 and there, and to generally fancy it up.  The drawback is size.  The
 average issue would jump from about 100K uncompressed to around 200K.
 Since many are downloading the issues from online services, costing from
 $6 to $8 per hour, it would hurt.

 Another idea is converting to AmigaGuide format.  The size difference
 would be minimal, and since Commodore has released AmigaGuide to the
 public, everybody can get it.  I'm not sure if there's much point to
 converting to a hypertext system, but it's a thought.

 Now sit back, relax, open a bottle of Crystal Pepsi, and take a deep
 breath.  Spring is here!

   =================


                         AMIGA RESOURCE NEWS UPDATE!
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


 COMMODORE ANNOUNCES AMIGA 4000-030

 The Amiga 4000-030 is powered by a 25MHz Motorola EC68030 microprocessor
 and comes standard with 2MB of Chip RAM, 2MB of Fast RAM, and a 120MB
 IDE hard drive.  A socket on the processor daughterboard allows the
 addition of a 68881 or 68882 math coprocessor. The daughtercard can be
 replaced at a later date with a card bearing a 68040 processor, 68040 and
 Digital Signal Processor, or future advanced processors such as the 68060.

 The system is expected to be available by the end of the month at a manu-
 facturer's suggested retail price of $2399.

 Amiga Resource contacted one dealer who said that he believes the street
 price of the A4000-030 will fall somewhere between $1900 and $1999.

 COMMODORE EXTENDS POWER UP PROMOTION

 Amiga Resource has learned that Commodore plans to extend its successful
 Power Up promotion through May 2, 1993. The A4000-040/120 with ASDG's Art
 Department Professional and EA's DeluxePaint IV AGA are available for a
 MSRP of $2693 under this promotion. The A1200 with Final Copy 1.3 and
 DeluxePaint IV AGA are are available for $599.

 COMMENTARY

 While the suggested retail price of the A4000-030 was surprisingly high
 to this editor, the $1900-ish street price seems quite a bit more reason-
 able. Also, remember that Commodore has a tradition that dates back to
 the introduction of the VIC 20 of releasing systems at a premium price
 and lowering costs to more reasonable levels later in the game. I'd
 expect to see the A4000-030 priced far more competitively by this summer.

 In the meantime, if you can afford the extra $700 or so, the A4000-040
 remains the best value under this pricing structure. Not only do you get
 $500 worth of free software due to the Power Up program, but you're also
 getting a machine that's going to be two to three times as fast; not to
 mention an MMU and math coprocessor. Also, since the A4000-030 ships with
 2MB of Fast RAM, this means it's using 1MB SIMMs for Fast memory. You can
 install two more 1MB SIMMs to go to a total of 4MB of Fast RAM. However,
 SIMM sizes can't be mixed, so if you need more than 4MB of Fast memory
 you'll have to remove the 1MB SIMMs on the motherboard and replace them
 with 4MB SIMMs. If you think you'll need a math coprocessor and more than
 6MB of RAM, the A4000-040 remains the machine of choice due to the cost
 of expanding the A4000-030.

                                Issue #12

                             By: John Deegan



    MAC CLONE RELEASED BY NUTEK - NuTek USA Corp. has released a clone of
 Apple Computer Inc.'s famous Macintosh, setting the stage for what anal-
 ysts expect will be a patent infringement suit from Apple.

    NuTek President/Founder Benjamin Chou says his company developed a
 computer motherboard that will run most Macintosh applications, adding
 NuTek plans to license the technology to independent computer makers at
 a price of $899 each, and it has already gotten some orders from Europe.

    Chou told the wire service, "We have done this from scratch. This is
 absolutely original." He said his engineers thoroughly documented their
 work and consulted throughout the process with an attorney.

    Nonetheless, an Apple spokesman told AP late last week Apple does not
 believe anyone can build a computer that runs Macintosh software without
 infringing on Apple's patented technology.


    MICROSOFT SHIPS FINAL BETA VERSION OF WINDOWS NT - Microsoft Corp has
 started shipping its final beta version of Windows NT to 70,000 custo-
 mers and software developers.

    The company said the pre- release version contains significant impro-
 vements in performance, application support, installation, ease of use,
 networking and hardware compatibility.

    Windows NT is aimed at providing the power, reliability and openness
 required for client-server computing.


    ZEOS OFFERS NEW SYSTEMS - Zeos International Ltd. has introduced
 LiteLine, a new low-cost 486SX PC for the home user. The unit starts at
 $1,495 for a 33MHz system with 8 meg of RAM and a 210MB hard drive. All
 come with a Super VGA adapter and color monitor, MS-DOS and Microsoft
 Windows.


    COMPUADD TO CLOSE RETAIL STORES - Computer retailer CompuAdd Computer
 Corp. has announced it will close its national chain of stores by the
 end of the year. The move will eliminate approximately 600 jobs.


    NEXT INC. PRESIDENT QUITS - After only a year on the job, Peter van
 Cuylenburg reportedly has resigned as president/chief operating officer
 of NeXT Computer Inc. The San Francisco Chronicle reports NeXT Chairman/
 CEO/founder Steve Jobs and van Cuylenburg decided the scaled-down com-
 pany no longer needs both a chief operating officer and a CEO.

    Van Cuylenburg's resignation come a month after NeXT said it will
 slash its staff from 530 to 200.


    ZENITH DATA CUTS NOTEBOOK PRICES UP TO 13% - Zenith Data Systems has
 announced price cuts of up to 13% on selected notebook computers.


    DELL OFFERS COLOR NOTEBOOK PRICED UNDER $2,000 - Dell Computer Corp.
 has unveiled a color notebook computer priced under $2,000. Based on an
 Intel '386 SL microprocessor running at 25MHz, the Dimension NL25C has a
 suggested retail price of $1,999. The new system is a color version of
 the company's NL25 monochrome notebook.

    The NL25C comes with a 9- inch, passive-matrix color VGA display, 2MB
 of system memory, expandable to eight, an 80MB hard drive, pre-installed
 MS-DOS 5 and a rechargeable NiCad battery that provides up to 5 hours of
 operating time when using the system's power- management features.


    COURT RULES AGAINST SECRET SERVICE IN BBS RAID - A federal judge has
 awarded $55,000 in damages to Steve Jackson, an Austin, Texas games pub-
 lisher.  The judgment against the U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. Attorney
 and a Bell Communications Research (Bellcore) security expert came in a
 27-page opinion by Judge Sam Sparks. The judge ruled that federal agents
 were at fault in a 1990 raid that seized computer equipment at Jackson's
 company.

    Jackson and three users of his BBS sued the Secret Service following
 the raid, alleging their privacy rights had been violated when their
 electronic mail was read.

    Reporting on the ruling, Communications Daily observed, "Jackson's
 case was another episode in (a) law enforcement crackdown as (a) result
 of (the) copying of (a) BellSouth administrative document on (the) 911
 service from (the phone company's) computer service and posted to
 several bulletin boards across (the) country."

    The judge ruled that:

    -:- Because the Secret Service failed to return equipment promptly,
 Jackson lost $42,259 and ran up expenses of $8,781, which the federal
 government should pay.

    -:- None of the authorities involved knew of Privacy Protection Act
 that prohibits electronic mail from being read, and there was strong
 evidence that Secret Service agents read mail of those using Jackson's
 BBS. Therefore he awarded $1,000 to each defendant.

    Neither Jackson or his company were suspected of violating the law,
 but federal agents were investigating a Jackson employee for alleged
 computer-related crimes at his home. The employee has never been charged
 in the case. Federal agents seized computers and hundreds of floppy
 disks from Jackson's company and kept the information for several
 months, forcing Jackson to lay off half his staff.

    Steve Jackson said that he is "overjoyed" and feels vindicated by the
 ruling. Jackson said the case enabled him to prove federal agents "had
 no business doing what they did." Jackson added, "It means that there is
 more protection for bulletin boards, both for the bulletin board opera-
 tor and for the user who sends electronic mail."

    The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which helped cover legal costs of
 case, applauded Judge Sparks' decision.

    "This case is a major step forward in protecting the rights of those
 who use computers to send private mail to each other or who use
 computers to create and disseminate publications," said EFF attorney
 Michael Godwin.

    "Judge Sparks has made it eminently clear," he added, "that the
 Secret Service acted irresponsibly. This case should send a message to
 law enforcement groups everywhere that they can't ignore the rights of
 those who communicate by computer."

    The ruling is being "hailed as a ground-breaking decision by computer
 buffs and civil libertarians who have been watching the case for the
 last three years. It was seen as a test case for extending First Amend-
 ment protections to computer information."


    SOFTWARE SALES HIT $5.75 BILLION IN 1992 - PC application software
 sales were up 14.1% last year from $5.04 billion in 1991. The sales,
 which reached $1.71 billion in the fourth quarter of 1992, totalled
 $5.75 billion for the calendar year.

    That is the word from the Software Publishers Association, based on
 its worldwide sales reporting program, in which member companies report
 their sales of personal computer application software.

    Other announcements by the SPA in a statement from Washington, D.C.:

    -:- Units sales in North America increased 36% for the year and 40%
 for the fourth quarter.

    -:- International sales out-paced growth in the North American
 market. Revenues from international sales of U.S. software grew 25.1%
 for the full year, while international sales in the fourth quarter were
 up 31.7%.

    -:- Combined U.S. and international sales were up 18.1% for the year
 and 17.3% for the fourth quarter. Worldwide units sales growth was 37.5%
 for the full year and 44.2% for the fourth quarter 1992.

 NEW ADPRO INTEGEGRATES WITH TOASTER, OPALVISION, DPAINT


 Madison WI, March 8, 1993 ---- ASDG Incorporated announces a major
 upgrade to their product, Art Department Professional.  The new
 release contains several firsts which increase the level of
 integration of the Amiga's most popular imaging tools.

 ADPro 2.3 is the first third party product to offer complete support
 of the Video Toaster Framestore file format.  The new release provides
 a loader and saver which can read and write Framestores in full
 broadcast color and fidelity.

 ADPro's Framestore support does not require a Video Toaster, which
 increases the processing options available to those using Toaster
 images.  For example, Framestores can be directly manipulated by all
 machines on a network including non-Toaster equipped machines.
 Batch processing using any of ADPro's extensive manipulation and
 conversion capabilities is now quick and easy.

 Videographers now have a direct Framestore-to-D1 digital video
 connection using ADPro's ABEKAS digital video driver.  This is today's
 most effective means of moving video data to and from the Amiga and
 has been used in such high profile productions as Quantum Leap,
 Babylon 5 and The American Music Awards.

 ADPro 2.3 also provides an exclusive direct memory link to the newest
 version of Deluxe Paint from Electronic Arts, as well as OpalVision's
 24 bit-plane paint program.

 ADPro has direct access to DPaint's memory including its primary,
 secondary, and animation buffers.  A similar capability is provided
 for Centaur Development's OpalPaint.

 Users of either paint system can directly load and save images in any
 file format which ADPro supports.  The same is true for any of ADPro's
 image processing capabilities.  For example, a Toaster Framestore can
 be loaded into OpalPaint, touched up with both programs, and saved to
 a film recorder.

 ADPro 2.3 adds many other new capabilities as well.  To learn more
 about the 2.3 upgrade or any of ASDG's other image processing tools,
 contact Ms.  Gina Cerniglia at 925 Stewart Street, Madison WI, 53713
 or call her at (608) 273 6585.

 GVP ANNOUNCE IV24 VERSION 2.0

 Great Valley Products announced today that it is set to release Version
 2.0 of its IV24 multifuntional video board.

 At the heart of Version 2.0 is enhanced software which greatly increases
 the capabilities of the IV24. Especially impressive is the new MacroPaint
 2.0 software. This real time, 16 million color paint package features high
 performance painting, and features a full color, floating toolbox-style
 interface that gives the user the ability to move the toolbox to a more
 convenient location. Also new is the ability to load and save JPEG com-
 pressed files. Painting can be done on a 24-bit image, while viewing the
 work in 12, 15, 18 or 21 bits for faster screen updates and lower Amiga
 graphics memory requirements. MacroPaint contains so many new features and
 enhancements that it comes with a brand new manual.

 A newly designed custom version of Caligari24 gives the user many more
 features than the original. Rendering directly to the IV24, Caligari24 now
 features an unlimited number of light sources, hierarchial animation which
 coordinates the movements of complex objects with their primitive
 sub-objects, and free form defamation for more realistic rendering of or-
 ganic objects like plants and flowers. Broadcast rendering capabilities
 ensure photo realistic representation of scenes. Like MacroPaint,
 Caligari24 also comes with a new manual.

 MyLad and Desktop Darkroom are also included in this upgrade. MyLad, a
 switching package, enables users to enhance their video productions by
 utilizing a number of simple, yet creative transitions between video
 sources, while Desktop Darkroom offers image capture and complete photo
 retouching capabilities, as well as a full range of special effects for
 image manupulation and image processing.

 According to Bill Prescott, GVP Product Manager, Version 2.0 represents a
 major advance in the professional capabilities of the IV24.

 "The IV24 with its built-in real time frame grabber, 24-bit frame buffer,
 genlock, flicker eliminator, picture-in-picture and highly versatile VIU
 (video interface unit) that provides inputs for all video formats and full
 transcoding capabilities, has always been a valuable tool for the video
 professional, photographer and educator," he notes. "And now with the
 addition of this impressive software upgrade, the system represents a
 dramatic opportunity for these professionals to optimize their creative
 potential and productivity."

 A separate IV24 upgrade kit for existing users will begin shipping at the
 end of March. It will list in the U.S. for $149.

 This major upgrade, which as been eagerly awaited by IV24 owners, consists
 of a ROM, several enhanced software packages and new manuals. The version
 3.10 ROM allows for A4000 compatibility and also allows the new software
 to run on existing IV24 boards.

 GVP is a privately held company that was founded in 1988. Today it is the
 world's largest third party developer of products for the Commodore Amiga.

 ADSPEC PROGRAMMING ANNOUNCES VERSION 2.1 OF ALADDIN 4D

 Adspec Programming is announcing the latest upgrade to its Aladdin 4D
 product: Version 2.1. Version 2.1 of Aladdin 4D was released as a FREE
 upgrade to all registered users. Registered users should have already
 received their upgrade in the mail. Those users who did not yet receive
 their upgrade should contact us or send in their registration card. All
 new packages are now being sent out with version 2.1 in them. If a
 customer puchases a package that contains version 2.0, then s/he will
 receive version 2.1 auotmatically when they send in their registration
 card. In addition to correcting some bugs in the initial release,
 Aladdin 4D version 2.1 includes some new features. Here is a list of
 new features in 2.1:

  o Speed - the new version of Aladdin 4D renders much faster. The amount
    of speed up depends on the drawing, but users can see up to seven times
    speed up in rendering times.

  o Group Levels - Polygons can now belong to up to five different groups.
    The groups are selected by setting the current level. This feature
    allows the grouping of large complex objects while retaining the
    ability to select the individual components parts in a separate group
    level.

  o Line Types - A new line types attribute has been added to the polygons.
    With the addition of four new types, plus the normal default, polygons
    can be represented in five different ways:

       Normal: the polygon will render in its normal state
       Edges: the polygon will render only along its edges
       Centers: the ploygon will render without edges
       Points: the polygon will render only at its point
       PntCnt: (point center) the polygon will render without its points

    The user can specify both and entry and exit value for the width of the
    edges of points. This feature makes builiding "girdered" objects quick
    and easy.

  o AGA Support - Version 2.1 of Aladdin 4D now includes support for the
    AGA machines. The program will recognize and allow the user to render
    the drawing in the new HAM8 mode. These modes can be quite effective
    and compare favorably to 24-bit displays. Aladdin 4D wil also use the
    HAM8 IFF files as textures and can save out Opcode 5 HAM8 animations.

  o Art Expression Support - Aladdin 4D will now read in the encapsulated
    PostScript files from Soft Logik's Art Expressions program.

 Product Information:

 Aladdin 4D Version 2.1
 Retail Price:  $499.00
 Requires a minimum of 2MB of RAM
 AmigaDOS 1.3/2.0 compatible
 Regular and Math Coprocessor version included
 Available now.

 |Subject: Warning: Bogus SnoopDos 2.0 spotted
 |Message-ID: <1993Mar12.162746.17351@maths.tcd.ie>
 |Keywords: SnoopDos 2.0 bogus  "Oh no, not again!"
 |Organization: Dept. of Maths, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.
 |Date: Fri, 12 Mar 1993 16:27:46 GMT
 |Lines: 24

 It has come to my attention that someone has started circulating a copy of
 SnoopDos 2.0. Since the most recent version of SnoopDos that I've released
 is version 1.7, this new version is an imposter.

 As of yet, I haven't had the chance to determine what this fake version
 does, but since the executable doesn't match the source code included with
 the distribution, there is a good chance that it does something nasty; it
 may be a repeat of the incident last year, where a bogus SnoopDos 1.6 was
 circulated that added a back door to the AmiExpress BBS package.

 If you see any files claiming to be SnoopDos 2.0 on an FTP site or BBS,
 please inform the Sysop that it is not an official release, and ask him
 or her to delete it. Please also pass on this message to other networks,
 to try and prevent this file from spreading too far.

 Thanks to Floyd Vest and Mathias Korsback for alerting me to the fake
 version. I can always be contacted by mail at ecarroll@maths.tcd.ie if
 you want to check whether your current version of SnoopDos is a valid
 release or not.

 MICROBOTICS RELEASES NEW PARTITIONING SOFTWARE

 MicroBotics has released its sophisticated and powerful RDPrep partition-
 ing software for free use by all Amiga users, worldwide. RDPrep has a com-
 plete graphical interface and extensive online help files. It can be used
 with any interface which completely supports the Rigid Disk Block standard
 and which accepts SCSI commands. Even the IDE interfaces on the Amiga 1200
 and 4000 can be accessed by RDPrep to partition third-party IDE drives.
 Although RDPrep is very easy to use it can nonetheless control every
 aspect of a hard disk partition. MicroBotics retains all rights to RDPrep
 and offers support only to its own hardware customers --but all Amigans
 are invited to avail themselves of this excellent commercial package, free
 of charge.

 Available on CompuServe in the Microbotics Library (Library 16) as
 RDP391.LHA, or on GEnie in the Amiga RT, file #18852.


 AMIGA REPORT NOW AVAILABLE ON ADS

 The FidoNet-based Amiga Software Distribution System (ADS) is now carrying
 Amiga Report Online Magazine from STR Publications.  If your local BBS is
 connected to the ADS, it will very likely receive Amiga Report each week
 automatically.  For information on joining ADS, please contact your local
 HUB or Network Echo Coordinator.


 ATTENTION EMPLANT OWNERS

 Utilities Unlimited has just released a new version of the HardKickMMU and
 SoftKickMMU that make *dramatic* improvements in emulation speed:

    60 % faster 16 color graphics!
    20% faster 2 & 4 color graphics!
    50%-80% faster FPU mathematics!
    5%-10% faster CPU rating!

 These increases were determined using Speedometer v3.2.

 We have also added command line options to turn on our own version of
 FASTROM so your system is FASTER (note:these speedups mentioned above
 do not include the FASTROM option which can increase CPU peformance by
 another 35%).  Also, we added an option for 040 owners to turn on the
 COPYBACK mode (System 7.1 required).

 Another reminder....

 We have a booth at the World of Commodore show in New York next week.
 The booth is located directly across from Creative Computer's huge
 booth (just to the right of entrance).  Come by and see for yourself
 that EMPLANT does exist, and it does what we say it does.  :-)

 > ONLINE WEEKLY STReport Online             People...  Are Talking!
   =============================


 On CompuServe:
 -------------

 From Rodger Padgett:


 "SupraTurbo 28 - An Economical way to Speed Things Up!"

 "I've been a Beta Tester for a device called the SupraTurbo 28, from Supra
 Corp of Albany Oregon.  Most well informed or well read Amigoids know
 about it already.  Amiga World has run the add for it the past several
 months, even though Supra hasn't officially released it for sale.

 "Quite simply, the SupraTurbo is an inexpensive way to make your Amiga
 500 or 2000 run faster than a stock Amiga 1200 and 2/3 as fast as the
 Amiga 3000.  For about $200 you get a SupraTurbo 28 (500 or 2000 version,)
 the only difference is the case the 500 version comes in.  You also get a
 well written manual and a program called "SupraTurbo."  Installation is
 easy. On the 500 you remove the expansion access panel on the side of the
 computer if it isn't already.  Remove the expansion pass-through on the
 ST28 case if you have a hard drive or memory expansion.  The ST28 has to
 be closest to the computer.  Install your other devices (HD or Memory
 module)  and then turn the ST28 switch on, then your machine.

 "It is just as easy to install on the 2000.  You do have to install
 the on/off switch so it goes outside your case if you intend to use it.
 You could jumper the to leave it on,  but I don't recommed that.  One word
 of caution, if you are using a GVP Series II A500-HD+ with memory
 installed, you have to make sure the ROM is version 3.14 or higher.  Mine
 wasn't, so I called GVP and had them send me their FaastRom Upgrade kit.
 Until I got it (I had the 3.07 ROM) I was dead in the water if I wanted to
 use my hard drive while accellerated.  I could use it in turbo mode as
 long as I was accessing memory or floppy.  Since installing the new 4.14
 ROM, I've been flying at 28.4 Mhz.  ProPage is faster (it actually keeps
 up with my typing now).  I haven't found anything that isn't compatible
 yet!  I don't expect to.  My system is a Amiga 500 with a fully populated
 Baseboard (4 megs memory), B-Pal option on the Baseboard, 2.04 ROM with WB
 2.1, a GVP SII A500+ 4 megs memory and now the SupraTurbo 28.

 "All in all, I am very excited over the SupraTurbo 28.  It is a fine
 product from a really caring company.  Supra is definitely in it for the
 long haul with Amiga's.  If your dealer hasn't gotten it yet, ask them too
 order one.

      From: CONSTABLE    To: ALL

 Hello Everyone, A special user here on delphi is suffering from Leukemia.
 Her only hope for a cure is a bone marrow transplant from a matched, un-
 related donor. She is of Native Americam ancestry and because there are so
 few Native Americans and other minorites who have volunteered to become
 registered as bone marrow donors, she and other patients of minority
 heritage have only a remote chance of finding a donor. If you are of
 Native-American, African- American, Asian-American, or Hispanic heritage
 and are between the ages of 18 and 55 and in good health, please contact
 the American Red Cross (Maine and Massachusetts> at 1-800-462-9400 Ext.
 2075 or the National Marrow Donor Program at 1-800-MARROW-2 to learn how
 you can help her and thousands of other patients who are waiting for the
 gift of life from the gift of a stranger.

 Thank you all for the time to read this and I hope you can help.

 Right, today I noticed a little snippet o' news that might interest
 some people:

 The German computer magazine CHIP (it's kinda BIG and heavy, equivalent
 to an average issue of BYTE dropped in a puddle) has chosen the Amiga
 3000 and Amiga 500 as "Computers of the Year" once again. (March '93
 issue).

 Around 16.000 readers have taken part in the survey to choose the best
 computer over 1992 in different groups: 3*6's, 4*6's, laptops etc.

 The A3000 came first (before the A500! ;) in the "680X0" category,
 leaving (among others) the Apple Mac Classic behind.  The A500 won
 the "Home computers" category.  Runner-up was the C64(!), before the
 Atari ST.

 Wonder what will happen next year when the A4000 and (especially!)
 the A1200 get settled into the German Amiga community...

 I too have been awaiting the SCSI-II board for months now and have recently
 become very angry about the SuperBuster issue.  I was led to believe by
 Mr. Eggerbrecht that the board would be available around mid January, yet
 it is now March and there is still no sign of it.  It is annoying me to no
 end that my hard drive is now full and I cannot purchase a SCSI controller
 and drive to remedy the situation.

 I've put up with a backwards fan, the goofy case, the slow hacked HD floppy,
 the slower than expected 8-bit non-interlaced modes, and the lack of burst
 mode for the 040, but I'm honestly getting very tired of it and I will not
 stand for C= to screw me once more with the SCSI-II situation.  Someone at
 Commodore is responsible for this screw-up and I am going to hold Commodore
 accountable for it.  I've broken my seal to fix the fan, add memory, and
 add an Ethernet controller, because there is no such thing as a dealer
 within several hundred miles of here, thanks to Commodore's mis-management
 an non-marketing of what could have been a great machine.

 I really doubt that anyone who has the authority to make such a statement
 reads this or any newsgroup.  C= seems to have a fine bunch of engineers,
 with the exception of the bozo who designed the A4000, but their managers
 are total morons.  Given the way that C= has treated Amiga owners in the
 past with regard to motherboard swaps and the like, I'm worried that we'll
 all just get screwed on this one.

 Just to let you know that you are not the only one with this problem.
 I have just given up with the A1200, after my fifth one, each one with
 display problems.

 I have just been reading in the march issue of amiga computing that 2500

 > Amiga Tip of the Week                      Screen Centering with AGA
   =====================
   By Micah Thompson


 Those of us with the new AGA machines are experiencing some neat new
 graphics modes.  But at the same time, we're finding that using them
 can be a royal pain.  Since the various graphics modes use different
 sync rates, the picture on our monitor isn't always centered.  Unless
 you own a monitor that has screen mode memory (like the NEC 3D), you
 have to constantly fumble with the screen controls when the screen
 mode changes.

 You'll need Commodore's latest AGA monitor drivers to perform this
 minor miracle with the AGA's programmable graphics chips.  The
 drivers are supplied with a disk called V39_Update, which should be
 available from your Commodore dealer by the time you read this.

 Here's what you do:  Turn off any mode promoting hacks you have
 installed such as DoubleX, ForceVGA or PKludge.  Open the Overscan
 prefs tool, and choose the Graphics Size for the NTSC mode.  A non-
 interlaced screen will open with visible scan lines (the 'normal'
 Amiga mode).  Adjust your monitor's screen position controls so that
 this screen is perfectly centered, vertically and horizontally.  It's
 also best to be sure your monitor is completely warmed up, as the
 centering varies from a cold monitor to a warm one.

 Now select another screen mode.  DBLNTSC for example.  Click on
 Graphics Size.  A screen will open, and the picture probably will not
 be centered.  Click and hold the center dark square in the picture
 with your mouse.  Drag that square, and the entire screen will move.
 If your overscan settings are smaller than maximum, the box defining
 the overscan screen will move within the maximum area, until it
 reaches the edge.  Then the entire screen will move!  That way, you
 can adjust each mode so that it will be perfectly centered.

 *Note:  You can also use the arrow keys to move just the screen,
 without disturbing the overscan area.  This seems to be the better
 method.

 Once you've adjusted all the modes (you don't need to adjust NTSC or
 PAL, as they are used as the reference), save it and you're set.
 What a relief!

 > Rendered Reality                     "I render, therefore I am."
   ================
   By Mike Troxell


 Morph: The process of changing one object into another dissimilar object.

 I guess by now everyone knows what a morph is. You've probably seen
 examples on TV or at the movies. An old car turns into a new model,
 one face transforms into another. I'm sure you've seen plenty of examples
 of this type of morph. In fact, ever since Michael Jackson used a morph
 sequence in his 'Black or White' video, it seems half the commercials
 you see on TV and just about every science fiction series out is using
 morphs.

 There are several excellent morphing packages available for the Amiga.
 ASDG's MorphPlus, GVP's CineMorph and Black Belt System's ImageMaster
 will each allow you to perform morphing magic on your images. Change that
 picture of your Mustang into a Lamborgini, for instance. Or try dup-
 licating some of the moprhing sequences you've seen in movies. Each of
 these three software packages has it's own personality and style.  What
 works for one person may not be right for someone else.  Talk to people
 who use these programs and get their opinion.  Then decide for yourself.

 I've been using ASDG's MorphPlus for about a month now and it seems to do
 everything I need it to and then some. A morphing program is not something
 you use every day. In fact, one of the dangers with any speceal effect is
 that you overuse it and it becomes boring. I'm working on a 2 1/2 to 3
 minute animation that will probably be close to 2500 frames long by the
 time I finish it.  I'm using one morph in the animation that will use
 around 45 of the 2500 frames, and will run 2-3 seconds. Morphing is a
 great technique to spice up your animations.  Just don't overdo it.

 The following is a list of the features ASDG claims for MorphPlus and my
 comments based on my experience with using the program.

 MorphPlus:

 * "A morphing/warping system with advanced state-of-the-art technology and
   an intuitive user interface."

   If you've used ASDG's ADPro then you'll be familiar with the MorphPlus
   main screen. MorphPlus has a very intuitive and easy to use interface.
   In fact, you can install MorphPlus as part of ADPro.

 * "A 3D wave/ripple module which actually models the interference patterns
   created by colliding waves."

 * "A complete WYSIWYG perspective warper which creates high quality DVE
   effects such as fly-bys and tumbles."

 * "A complete WYSIWYG spherical warper which can create fisheye lens
   effects, or even wrap images onto a rotating sphere."

 * "Arbitrary rotation and twirling of images about any point, by any
    amount or radius, with or without soft edges or anti-aliasing."

   I bought MorphPlus because I needed to do a morph in an animation
   I was working on, but I found that MoprhPlus does a lot more than just
   morph objects. Some of the Operators (effects) that MorphPlus does are
   apply map, blur, color to gray, crop visual, gray to color, horizontal
   flip, perspective, camera control, rotation control, refract, ripple,
   rotate, scale, sphere, twirl, vertical flip, warp, negative image and
   roll. If there's anything to want to do to an image, MorphPlus probably
   has an operator that will do it.  If you can't find an effect you're
   looking for, there's a good chance it will be in the next upgrade. I
   just recieved the latest (free) upgrade in the mail, and it contained
   three new effects and enhancements to several existing operators.

 * "The ability to read and write images in IFF and Anim formats."

   Add to that the ability to read JPEG and AGA. MorphPlus can also save to
   IFF, ANIM, HAM-E, JPEG and AGA.

 * "Complete AREXX compatability."

 * "All function are computed in 24 bit-plane color or 8 bit-plane grey
    scale and work entirely from RAM for maximum speed."

 * "Comprehensive fully indexed manual with tutorials."

   With MorphPlus you get a 303 page hardcover, ring binder manual. The
   manual and tutorials are well done and will have you doing you're first
   morph within minutes (well, within an hour anyway).

   System requirements:

   Compatible with all Amiga models, both NTSC and PAL.
   Kickstart and Workbench 2.0 or above.
   Requires 4 meg FAST RAM.  Eight meg recommended.
                             (See why I recomended 8-10megs last time?)
   Hard drive and accelerator recommended.
                             (Strongly recommended!)

 In a review of MorphPlus in "Video Toaster User" magazine, David Duberman
 called MorphPlus "the Rolls Royce of Amiga morphing software".  I think
 I'll have to agree with him.

 > AGA-Compatible Monitors STR InfoFile
   ====================================
   By Robert Glover


 With the new AGA machines out in full force, people are often asking what
 monitors sync to the frequencies required by the Amiga.

 The main thing you want to look for in a multiscanning monitor is the
 ability to scan down to the 15 kHz range.  Usually this is about 15.7 kHz.
 If it cannot go that low, you will not be able to play most games, see
 your guru or Boot Options screen, etc.  Below is a list of the monitors we
 know of that are fully AGA compatible and their specifications.  Very few
 are still in production, so many will be refurbished units.  This isn't
 necessarily bad, since they often include warranties.  One thing to keep
 in mind when selecting a refurbished unit is WHO did the refurb -- did the
 manufacturer do it, or the reseller?  Your best choice is one refurbished
 by the manufacturer, since you can then take it to any authorized service
 center if it needs work.  However, if it is done by the reseller, any work
 must be performed by them.  This will usually require sending the unit
 back, which can often add up in terms of shipping costs, and down time
 while it is away being repaired.

 NEC 3D            This is probably the nicest multiscanning monitor
                   availble (IMO).  It has the best picture I've seen on
 a monitor, and it has automatic screen mode memory.  What this means is
 that there are pushbutton controls on the front panel, and you set your
 screen once for each sync mode you use, and it remembers it.  This is very
 handy, since different sync rates cause the position of the screen to
 change.

 NEC II            This is a very nice monitor, and a second-cousin to the
                   NEC 3D.  It preceded the NEC 2A, which is NOT AGA
 compatible.  I own one of these and am very pleased with it.  The picture
 is every bit as good as the 3D, though it lacks screen mode memory.  My
 only complaint with this monitor is that the screen width control is a
 two-position switch, so there are only two settings -- narrow, and not-
 so-narrow.  It makes it difficult to fill the screen with a picture, but
 it's not that big of a deal.  Do not confuse this with the NEC 2A, which
 is NOT AGA-compatible, as it does not sync down to NTSC rates.

 Panasonic C1381   Do not confuse the newer C1381i with this one.  The 'i'

 Commodore 1950/1960    These are Commodore's own entries into the multi-
                        scanning arena.  Both are nice monitors, but the
 picture quality leaves something to be desired in some cases.  I think
 Commodore must have some quality control problems, as about half of the
 1960's I see don't look very good, and the other half are decent.  The
 1950 is rumored to have a better overall picture, though the styling
 isn't quite as nice as the 1960.  Given the price of these monitors,
 you're better off finding a deal on one of the above units, unless you
 really want your whole system matching perfectly.

 > Warez Out There ~ STR Weekly Feature
   ====================================


 This will be an ongoing and (hopefully) weekly feature in Amiga Report.
 We will try to cover as many of the newest file available on the online
 services.  The idea is to let people what's out there, and if it's any
 good.  Whenever you download a program, it's always a good idea to READ
 THE DOCUMENTATION.  You might miss an exciting feature, that you otherwise
 wouldn't have known about!

 If you know of a program or author that you feel should get some
 publicity, please send us Email!


 File:                Worm
 Author:              Tim Kreuzer
 Status:              Freeware
 Where to find:       GEnie:  Amiga RT, File #18744

 Worms is an entertaining little program.  It is a port from the Sun/UNIX
 platform, by Brad Taylor, and based on the first Amiga port by Chuck
 McManis.  The author refers to Worms as "eye candy."  It opens a small
 window on your public screen and draws a number of worms moving about in
 that window.  All parameters are user-adjustable:  Speed, number of worms,
 length, etc.  There are gadgets at the bottom of the window to make the
 necessary adjustments.  My favorite thing to do is start up a dozen or more
 copies of the program, and move them about my Workbench, until the system
 comes to a crawl.  That's easy on my A1200 with no Fast RAM, but I'd like
 to see how many it would take to do that to an A4000!  There are versions
 in the archive for 16- and 32-bit machines.  Requies WB 2.0 or greater.

 NOTE:  As of this writing, a newer version of Worms has appeared on GEnie,
 file #18845.  The major difference is that all controls are in the form of
 drop-down menus, and the Worms window is resizable.  I recommend getting
 both versions.  Also, a newer version will be available in a few weeks with
 some expanded options.  Tim said that these improvements are from user
 requests.  If you like something, tell the author!


 File:                Terrain
 Author:              Tim Kreuzer
 Status:              Freeware
 Where to find:       GEnie, Amiga RT, File #18657

 This program is more than eye candy.  It's a random terrain drawing tool,
 using however many colors they choose.  The user can adjust various
 parameters from degree, scale, divisor or swivel.  Three modes of op-
 eration are available:  Altitude mapping, Shadows, or Wireframe.  To
 properly use the Shadows mode, you must use the included Palette Tool
 program.  This handy utility lets you adjust every color in the present
 color palette.  The version of Palette tool included is v1.0.

 The program opens two windows on your current public screen.  One is a
 control box, the other is the resizbly terrain window.  Therefore, the
 resolution of the terrain is determined by your maximum screen res-
 olution.  There are three versions included in the archive:  One for the
 base A1200, one for an A1200 with an FPU, and one for the A4000.


 File:                Fractal
 Author:              Tim Kreuzer
 Status:              Freeware
 Where to find:       GEnie, Amiga RT, File #18605 - No FPU requred
                                            #18601 - FPU version

 Fractal is another neat little program that lets you draw fractals in a
 window.  It is controlled much like Terrain, with a window of gadgets,
 and a sizable window containing the drawing area.  User-adjustable
 parameters include Xmax, Xmin, Ymax and Ymin for the fractal coordinates,
 a Depth setting, plus Zoom In/Out, Center, and Amount.  Amount controls
 how far you choose to Zoom in or out, on a scale of 1 to 10.  To zoom
 in, for example, you click Zoom In.  Now, in the drawing window, choose
 the upper-left point where you want to zoom, and click.  Move the mouse,
 and a sizing box appears.  Enclose the area you wish to zoom in on, and
 click again.  The box stays.  The coordinates are updated.  Click Draw,
 and you're set.  This is another fun little program, especially if you
 like Fractals.  There are two versions available:  One for an A1200 with
 no FPU, and one for the A1200 with an FPU or the A4000.


 File:                LyapunovSpace
 Author:              Tim Kreuzer
 Status:              Freeware
 Where to find:       GEnie:  Amiga RT, file #18756

 This program is identical to Fractal in operation, except that it draws
 Lyapunov fractals instead of Mandelbrot fractals.  Versions for A1200 with
 or without FPU and A4000 included.


 File:                Palette Tool v1.1
 Author:              Tim Kreuzer
 Status:              Freeware
 Where to find:       GEnie:  Amiga RT, file #18846

 Palette tool is a handy utility to change every color in the palette of
 whatever public screen Palette Tool is opened on.  It's especially useful
 when used with any of the above programs.  The author recommends using
 Window Blender to open an AGA screen/color depth of your choice, then
 using PublicScreenX to switch Window Blender to the current public screen.
 Then open the above programs on that screen, and use Palette Tool to alter
 the colors to your peferences.  Version 1.1 adds copy, undo and spread
 functions.  This program is designed for use only on AGA-equipped Amigas.
 Please read the docs for further information.  It is designed for use with
 screens using a palette of 32 or more colors.


 File:                SmartPlay v3.0
 Author:              Xtreme Intelligence
 Status:              Freeware
 Where to find:       ADS (Amiga Software Distribtion System):  SPLAY30.LHA
                      Various FidoNET BBS's

 SmartPlay is another MOD/MED music player, but it is different from the
 others in its ability to load the actual song data into Fast RAM, and only
 the samples into Chip RAM.  This saves a considerable amount of Chip RAM,
 especially on Amiga 500's that still have only 512K of chip RAM.  The doc-
 umentation recommends running it from the Shell, but I run it from within
 Toolmanager (v1.5) with no problems.  It opens a small window on the Work-
 bench, with CD-Player type controls, like DeliTracker.  It has a cycle
 gadget telling the MOD name, the name of the MOD's author, and what type
 of MOD it is (Protracker, Noisetracker, etc.). There are gadgets for Play,
 Stop, Fast Forward/Reverse, Pause, Eject, Config, Editor (for loading
 multiple MODs), and "><" buton that reduces the window to just its title
 bar and these gadgets.  There are also sliders for volume and balance.  I
 have tested this player with many of my MODs, and they all appear to play
 correctly, except during serial transfers.  In some cases, a channel may
 temporarily disappear, or certain samples are messed up or not played. I
 noticed some samples weren't played as clearly as with DeliTracker,
 EdPlayer, or MultiPlayer.  However, if you're cramped for Chip RAM, this
 is a good choice.  I hope SmartPlay will get a bug fix, as it's clearly
 what many Amiga owners need!  Recommends OS 2.0 or greater, but the author
 feels it SHOULD run under WB 1.3.

 > BT to ADD SPEED STR InfoFile     High Speed Dialer, Wireless & Digital
   """"""""""""""""""""""""""""



           BT SPEEDS UP CUSTOMER ACCESS TO ITS U.S. DATA NETWORK
           =====================================================



 New  Services  to  Include  Higher  Speed  Local  Dial,  950, Wireless and
 Switched Digital Access

 San Jose, California, March, 1993

     With the goal of offering the widest array  of access  methods to meet
 customer-specific  application   requirements,  BT   North  America  today
 announced plans  to introduce  diverse new  wire and  wireless services by
 year's  end.    The  new  domestic services will provide the company's two
 million daily users with faster and  enhanced access  methods to  its U.S.
 data network, the largest public network in operation.

     The new  capabilities will  enable customers  to cut  costs of on-line
 network usage up to 30%, while giving users the ability  to access network
 applications and transfer data at rates of up to four times the speed that
 can currently be achieved.

     Among the  new services  to be  introduced are  high-speed (14.4 kbps)
 local dial,  uniform number  access (800  and 950), wireless (cellular and
 radio), and switched digital services.   The  move  to  higher  speeds and
 wireless access  methods is  in anticipation  of customer requirements for
 faster data communications and  network access  for the  growing number of
 mobile  users,  driven  by  continued  proliferation of portable computing
 devices.

     "While ATM, ISDN and  SONET garner  much of  the industry's attention,
 millions of  users are  looking for better and faster ways to access their
 network  applications,"  said  Ron  Bamberg,  vice  president  of Business
 Development and  Strategic Planning  for BT North America. "Network access
 is the most critical and core component of any network  service offered by
 a carrier or service provider."

     Bamberg continued:  "BT's strategy  is to  not only maintain a leading
 role in the area of network access, but to deliver  targeted services best
 suited  for  specific  network  applications.    No one access service can
 satisfy all the various requirements our  customers have  to get  to their
 network applications.   Therefore, we will continue to introduce a variety
 of new products which best address each individual requirement."

 LOCAL HIGH SPEED DIAL SERVICES
     Starting in September, BT  will become  the first  value-added network
 (VAN) provider  to deploy a U.S. service enabling users to access its data
 network, through a local  phone call,  at speeds  of 14.4  kbps (V.32bis).
 Nationwide  coverage  of  the  14.4  kbps  service  is  expected  by 1995.
 International  Data  Corporation  (IDC),  Framingham,  MA,  estimates that
 between 1991  and 1996 the compound annual growth rate for 14.4 kbps modem
 shipments will exceed 45 percent.

     In addition, BT plans to become the first  VAN to  offer service which
 supports  the  CCITT  V.fast  recommendation  (see note to editors), which
 provides for access speeds of 28.8 kbps. The  company is  currently in the
 process  of  rolling  out  a  nationwide  9.6  kbps  dial service which is
 expected to be fully deployed in over 520 local access  sites by December,
 1994. To date, over 120 sites have been completed.

     "Our  applications  have  become  response-time sensitive," said Allen
 Watrud, manager of Telecommunications for CUNA Mutual Insurance Group, the
 world's largest  provider of  credit insurance for credit unions and their
 members. "Getting our remote users to  the  network  is  one  of  the most
 important aspects  of providing  them with the information they need to do
 their jobs more effectively."

     Watrud continued: "With thousands  of users  dialing into  our network
 every  day,  we  are  constantly  looking  for ways in which we can reduce
 overall access and on-line costs while increasing the users' productivity.
 Higher  speed  dial  services  represent  a solution to our requirements."
 CUNA's telecommunications  group  currently  supports  approximately 3,000
 remote users through local dial public network services.

     The  new  dial  services  will  support  the  industry-standard  CCITT
 V-series  recommendations  for  data  compression  (V.42bis)   which  will
 effectively  quadruple  data  throughput  rates.   For example, a customer
 accessing the network with a compression capable 9.6 and 14.4  kbps modems
 could  realize  data  throughput  rates  of  up  to  38.4  and  57.6  kbps
 respectively.

     "New communications  and modem  technologies are  emerging which allow
 for faster  transmissions over  existing analog  architectures," said Jeff
 Zanardi,  manager  of  Access  Services  for  BT  North  America.   "These
 technologies  coupled  with  new bandwidth-hungry applications are driving
 network access More? speeds to increasingly higher levels."

 UNIFORM NUMBER ACCESS
     Already a leading provider  of  uniform  number  and  toll-free access
 through its  800 service, the company will upgrade this service to support
 14.4 kbps access  by  September.  In  addition,  to  better  meet customer
 application requirements for uniform number and toll free access,  BT will
 reduce its 800 rates to as low as $9 per hour.

     By the third quarter, BT will also begin  offering 950  (Feature Group
 B) service to its electronic transaction service (ETS) customers.

     "We don't  see 950  replacing local dial access or 800 services," said
 Zanardi. "A local call will always  be the  most cost-effective  means for
 users to  access any  network. Rather, we are positioning our 800 services
 to address the needs  of  customers  whose  applications  require  UNA and
 toll-free features.   950  services will  be positioned  to address point-
 of-sale applications and electronic transactions which  require short call
 set-up times. 950 is best suited for these types of applications."

 WIRELESS ACCESS  BT is currently evaluating a number of cellular and radio
 network  access  alternatives  and,  by  year's  end,  plans  to introduce
 services utilizing wireless technologies.

     These include  the use  of IBM's  CelluPlaN II technology and services
 from Cellular Data Inc.  (CDI), of  Palo Alto,  California.  Additionally,
 radio  access   will  be  provided  to  users  through  RAM  Mobile  Data.
 Discussions are currently underway to link RAM's nationwide radio networks
 and BT's  data network.   These  new wireless  services will provide users
 with the ability send and receive electronic mail and other  time critical
 information, as well as access transaction applications.

     The Yankee Group expects revenues from mobile data network services to
 reach nearly $2.5 billion by  the  end  of  the  decade.  E-mail  has been
 identified  as  the  primary  application for which users require wireless
 network access. Currently there are more than 20  million e-mail  users in
 the United States.

 SWITCHED DIGITAL SERVICES
     In addition  to high-speed asynchronous dial and wireless services, BT
 North America  is currently  evaluating the  provision of switched-digital
 services.  Initially these services will be provided to users at speeds of
 56 kbps as backup for dedicated digital connections (X.25 or  frame relay)
 or as  an alternative  for sites  which cannot justify dedicated circuits.
 Higher speed digital services with  speeds  up  to  T1  are  also planned.
 These  higher  speed  services  can  also  be  used  for  cost- effective,
 low-speed video conferencing applications.


                                ###

 > STR's Mailbag                     Letters to the Editor
   =============


 From:   James W. Greenidge
 To:     Robert Glover
 Sub:    Premier Issue STR-Amiga

 Greetings Mr. Glover;

 Excellent issue!  It's about time we've a tie-in resource between
 the networks!  Please consider future themes and features as these:

 A suggestion which I often hawk and plead is a full length feature on
 Amiga PD authors.  These people not only go unsung, but even most of
 their titles are unreviewed or unknown or haphazardly strewn all over
 cyberspace.  We know little of what drives them, their plans, their
 opinions, their family-author life.  I know it'd be difficult to accom-
 plish, what with many Amiga authors in Europe and down-under, but heck,
 I'd be willing to contribute a modest fee to permit you say, a trans-
 oceanic interview with Nico or Chris Hames, etc.  We need these people,
 the Amiga community does.  They need their "fifteen minutes"!

 Secondly, your BBS etiquette article was superb, and I'm seeing that as
 many computer labs in the NYC Board of Ed system post them to as many
 metro boards as possible.

 May the wind forever fill your sails,

                 Jim


             __________________________________________________


 Dear Jim:

 I agree with you completely about PD authors needing credit and praise.
 I hope to be able to accomplish something along those lines in the near
 future.  This issue, we have started spotlighting various programs that
 we find on the online services and local BBS's.  While this effort is
 certainly a step in the right direction, it is far from sufficient.  But
 at least it will get some of these otherwise ignored programs some
 attention.

 If you can provide me with an Email address for some notable PD authors,
 I will contact them and try to arrange some interviews and features.

 Thank you very much for your reponse, and I hope more people will take
 the initiative to make suggestions like you have!

              Rob @ Amiga Report International Online Magazine

                      ****************************************

  Basic Services
  --------------
      Most  of  the  Basic  services  are  available 24 hours a day with no
 connect time charges beyond  the basic  membership fee.  However, a select
 group  have  functions  for  which  transaction  fees  are  charged. Basic
 services are accessible through a flat rate charge of $5.95 per month.

  Premium Services
  ----------------
      For Premium services, Members pay connect  charges for  the amount of
 time spent in a particular service. Premium services are accessible Monday
 through Friday for a connect time charge of $9.00/hour from 8 am  to 6 pm,
 and $6.00/hour from 6 pm to 8 am; and on Saturday and Sunday for a connect
 time charge of $6.00 all day (6 pm Friday til  8 am  Monday), central time
 zone.   9600 Baud access is available at no additional cost!  Think of the
 advantages of downloading at 9600 baud for 9.00 hr Prime  Time or  6.00 hr
 non-prime time!

     Order an  extended NVN  Membership of  6 or  12 months,  pay for it in
 advance and   receive  a bonus  in connect  time at  no additional charge.
 Choose from two  subscription plans:

 6-Month Membership
     Pay just  $30 for a 6-month Membership and receive a usage credit that
 entitles  you to $15 of  connect-time  in  the  Premium  services  of your
 choice. Your total savings using this plan would be over $20!*

 12 Month Membership
     Pay  $50  for  a  full  year's  Membership and get even more free time
 on-line. We'll give you a $25 usage credit to use in your favorite Premium
 services or try out new ones. You could save as much as $45.*

     For more  information about  either of  these plans, give us a call at
 1-800-336- 9096.

     *Both extended  Membership options,  including free  usage credits are
 nonrefund-able/nontransferable.  Members  are  responsible for all Premium
 charges over the  $15 or $25 usage credit.

     You can join NVN one of  two  ways.    By  voice  phone 1-800-336-9096
 (Client Services)  or via  modem phone 1-800-336-9092.  You will be issued
 an Account # (usually within 24 hours) National  Videotex Network  and the
 Amiga Forum will be waiting for you.
