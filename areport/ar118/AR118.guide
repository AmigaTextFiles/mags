/// From the Editor's Desk                        "Saying it like it is!"
    ----------------------


A friend gave me an idea a few days ago.  He said that since Amiga Report
is such a hit in ASCII/AmigaGuide format, why not do it on video?  Video??
He said yeah, do a video Amiga magazine.  Not weekly, of course, but say,
Quarterly.  Every three months.  He's a video producer with his own studio
and equipment (including a few Toasters), so he has everything we need to
do it.  Basically, it'd be a "Video" edition of Amiga Report -- a magazine
much like Motorweek on PBS.  We could do stuff just like we do weekly in
ASCII form, only be able to SHOW it to you.  We'd have lots of neat video
effects, screen shots of reviewed programs in action, interviews with
people, and so on!

It sounds like a really neat idea, and we might even try it.  I wanted to
ask (once again) our readers.  What do YOU think?  The reason I ask is
because, naturally, this can't be a free thing like AR is every week.  We
figured $15 per copy seemed fair.  That would cover the costs of the tapes,
production, etc.  We can provide copies on VHS, Beta, NTSC or PAL.  So tell
us what you think of this idea.  Are we crazy, or might it be worthwhile?

                 ------------------------   ----------
                Weekly Happenings in the Computer World
 
 
                            By: John Deegan
 
   ATARI TO GET TIME WARNER LIBRARY - Atari Corp. has announced that a 
library of video clips owned and licensed by Time Warner Inc., the 
world's largest media and entertainment company, is being made available 
to Atari or their third-party licensed publishers set to develop titles 
for the new multimedia Atari Jaguar.

   The long-anticipated Atari Jaguar, to be introduced in the New York 
market later this fall, is a 64-bit interactive multimedia entertainment 
system with high-performance, true color and CD-quality sound.

   "Having access to this Time Warner library will be truly beneficial," 
said Sam Tramiel, president of Atari. "With 64-bit technology, the 
Jaguar will allow for new heights in software experiences, and the 
association with Time Warner will add to the reality of the software."

   The Atari Jaguar's high-level technology includes a 32-bit expansion 
port allowing for future connection into cable and telephone networks, 
as well as digital signal processing for modem use and connection to 
digital audio peripherals. The video output is far superior to video 
games available today and will allow for more realistic simulations of 
moving vehicles such as spaceships, cars, planes and figures.

   "Our emphasis now is not only the product's affordability and the 
fact that the Jaguar is made in America, but also that our software 
titles will be a fun experience on a truly next level," Tramiel said.

   The Atari Jaguar will retail for approximately $200. A national roll-
out is expected sometime next year.
 

   APPLE CUTTING 15% OF FORCE - Apple Computer Inc. plans to lay off 
about 2,500 people -- or more than 15% of its worldwide work force -- 
over the next 12 months. The company said most layoffs will occur this 
month.

The company, which currently employs about 16,000 people, will account 
for the restructuring costs in its third quarter, which ended on June 
25.

   In a statement announcing the actions, Apple said only that it plan-
ned to implement "a broad re-engineering of the company to accelerate 
revenue, unit and earnings growth. The re-engineering will include a 
work force reduction of approximately 2,500 worldwide of Apple's 16,000 
full-time, temporary and contract employees, with the majority of 
layoffs occurring in July 1993."


   APPLE DENYING REPORT IT WILL LICENSE SYSTEM 7 - Apple Computer is 
denying a report that said Apple will begin licensing its Macintosh 
System 7 operating system to other hardware vendors.

   Apple spokesperson Cindy McCaffrey said that an Apple official had 
spoken with InfoWorld, but made no such statement regarding the 
operating system.

   Apple is "looking to be more aggressive" in licensing systems soft-
ware technology, McCaffrey said, but that does not include licensing the 
Macintosh operating system.


   U.S. MARSHALS AND MICROSOFT COMPLETE SOFTWARE SEIZURES - U.S. Marshals 
in association with Microsoft Corp. investigators announced this week 
that they have completed a series of coast-to-coast seizures over the 
past four months intended to purge the market of illegal Microsoft MS-
DOS and Windows operating system software.

   According to sources, several defendants named in three separate 
federal lawsuits filed in conjunction with the seizures were former or 
present Microsoft licensees, including Unitron Computer Inc., CMOS 
Technologies Inc. and Micro Innovation Inc.

   Microsoft said undisclosed amounts of several defendants' assets were 
frozen in each of the cases.

   In the California action against Unitron Computer, over 125,000 
illegal copies of Microsoft MS-DOS 5 and Windows 3.1, with a street 
value of approximately $7 million, were seized.

   CMOS Technologies of New Jersey was targeted for allegedly producing 
tens of thousands of counterfeit Windows 3.1 packages. Although Micro-
soft terminated CMOS' license agreement in 1992, CMOS had continued to 
produce and distribute Windows 3.1

   Micro Invention Inc. of Houston was allegedly producing unlicensed 
copies of MS-DOS 5 and Windows 3.1 under its own trade name and dist-
ributing the product through the PC Innovations stores and other resel-
lers nationally. Simultaneous seizures at seven Houston-area locations 
netted 35,000 units of MS-DOS and Windows, with a street value of 
approximately $2 million.



                NOTABLE TECHNOLOGIES PARTNERS WITH COMPSOFT
                                 TO DELIVER
                          ADVANCED COMMUNICATIONS
                                    FOR
                              MOBILE COMPUTING


Notable Technologies Inc., a leading developer and publisher of
applications for pen-based mobile computing, and Compsoft Services Inc. of
Greenwich, Conn., a developer of custom software and communications
products for Fortune 100 companies, today announced a technology and
marketing partnership that will bring to market new and expanded
communications software solutions for GO Corporation's PenPoint operating
system.

     Under the agreement, Notable will market and distribute Compsoft's
PenNET line of new communications applications under Notable's Mobile
Access brand, as well as other products that are currently under
jointdevelopment with Compsoft.  In addition, Notable will be providing, in
conjunction with Compsoft, custom application development and project
coordination services for companies looking for assistance in their
mobile computing and communications piloting efforts.

     In coming months a series of powerful pen-based hardware
products will be shipping from such companies as:EO, Inc., IBM, Fujitsu,
Toshiba and NEC.  Notable is positioned to be the leading supplier of
communications-based software for this emerging market.  The company
has already announced Mobile Access Personal, a powerful
telecommunications package that links mobile users with various host
environments.  Compsoft Services will provide its significant
communications and networking technical expertise to help Notable
broaden the vertical and horizontal applications for the Mobile Access
family.

     Notable and Compsoft Services are committed to staying on top
of the rapidly emerging pen-based mobile computing and personal
communicator technology.  Host connectivity is a cornerstone
application for this market, said Ronald J. Brown, president of
Notable Technologies.  Our agreement with Compsoft assures that we will
be the premier provider of this crucial communication capability.  In
addition, our relationship means that Notable will be in a position to
reach the market faster, with other new communications solutions and
upgrades.

     Dr. Trilok Manocha, president of Compsoft Services, Inc. added,
We believe that the combination of our experience in the development
of complex networking, application and system software combined with
Notable's significant marketing, distribution, sales and software
development expertise and close relationship with other mobile
computing technology companies will allow us to be leaders in bringing
this new technology to market.

     According to Brown, positive feedback from prototype application
sites and initial trade press technology reviews are good indications
that the era of pen-based mobile computing has finally arrived. 
Communications is one of the key factors that makes this class of
computing highly productive.  From the floor of major stock exchanges
to the field sales forces of international pharmaceutical companies,
business managers are realizing the competitive advantage that can be
gained by providing easier, more portable access to and from their
information warehouses (host computing infrastructures).

     With offices in Oakland and Foster City, California, Notable
is dedicated to creating easy-to-use, easy-to-learn software to empower
mobile professionals to more effectively communicate and interact, as
well as organize information efficiently.

Mobile Access as well as the Notable name and logo are all trademarks
of Notable Technologies, Inc. Other trade marks mentioned are property
of their respective companies.

MICROSOFT INTRODUCES ARCADE

Microsoft has introduced Microsoft Arcade, the newest title from the
entertainment product unit. Microsoft Arcade is an accurate
replication of five of the most popular arcade games from Atari -
Asteroids, Centipede, Battle Zone, Missile Command and Tempest - for
use with the Microsoft Windows operating system. These high-quality
games were reproduced to give users the same look and effects on the
Windows platform that they recall from the original arcade versions.


MPEG GAINS SUPPORT

A group of leading consumer electronic manufacturers and program content
providers announced last week at the Digital World conference that they
will support the distribution of video on Compact Disc. These discs will
use the MPEG 1 standard for the compression of video and audio data.
Further, the manufacturers have agreed to support the Karaoke CD
format proposed by JVC and Philips Consumer Electronics which will
ensure that video CD programs can be played interchangeably on a wide
variety of platforms. Companies supporting the format include
Commodore, C-Cube Microsystems, E-Motions, Goldstar, JVC, Paramount
Home Video, Philips and Samsung. MPEG 1 compression technology allows
74 minutes of VHS-quality video and CD-quality audio to be played from
a Compact Disc. Directory information on video CD format discs is
compatible with both interactive players (such as CD-I, Commodore
Amiga, 3DO, Macintosh, PC-compatibles etc.) and linear play machines
(karaoke or movie players). To support interactive machines, the
directory format is compatible with CD-ROM XA, including all ISO 9660
compatible CD drives.


GDI - INDUSTRY FIRST C-TECH

...has announced the industry's first GDI laser printer developed
exclusively for the Windows 3.1 user environment. The C.Itoh ProWriter
CI-4GDI, available OEM as model 1321E, combines high quality, high
performance and low noise in a compact package. It is the first GDI
laser printer introduced to the United States market. List priced at
$999, the CI-4GDI/1321E is also the company's first printer product
designed to comply with the energy requirements established by the
Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) new Energy Star Program, which
was launched in Washington, D.C., on June 17. Resolution is 300x300
dots-per-inch. A high-speed Centronics parallel interface is standard.


NEW JOINT SPONSORED CD-ROM

Apple, Kodak and Sony recently announced the release of a jointly-
sponsored CD-ROM title called Open Wider. Created by New York-based
multimedia design company Imergy, Open Wider documents the assembly of
Open, a magazine that explores creativity in the digital age. Open
Wider is an interactive CD-ROM that brings the making of Open to life
while expanding its content through sound, animation, video and still
photography. It is also intended to be an educational tool for
magazine and book publishers, advertisers, and universities, offering
insight into the future of publishing. The three sponsors each played
a key role in the production of Open Wider. All of the photos used in
the CD-ROM were first stored on Kodak Photo CD, then accessed from
Photo CD and incorporated into the CD-ROM. Open Wider was designed and
produced entirely on Apple Macintosh computers. Sony helped in the
final stages by manufacturing the CDs and contributing the jewel case
packaging.


PROTECT YOUR KIDS FROM GUNS

A Family of Safety Products (FSPI), an Atlanta-based company,
has created a new solution to this growing problem of guns using
today's computer technology, packaged in a special enclosure designed
to fit on most handguns, long guns and air guns. TriggerAlarm, the
lead product in the line, combines visual warnings designed to
communicate effectively the potential danger of the gun, along with a
digital alarm system which, when activated, sounds an 85-decibel alarm
which warns the child, or other individual, of the danger, while
alerting the owner and others in the home of the intrusion. According
to a recent General Accounting Office (GAO) report, 31 percent or more
of the accidents with guns and youths could be avoided through the use
of a device which would block access to the trigger and provide
cognitive warnings that communicate the danger effectively.
TriggerAlarm and its companion, TriggerShield, provide both of those
capabilities in a small package which fits on most handguns, rifles,
shotguns, air guns and paint ball guns. TriggerAlarm expands on that
solution by including a full digital alarm system designed to sound if
the gun is tampered with. While limiting accesses and providing
immediate warnings, this system can be easily removed from the gun in
seconds by the educated owner, and is controlled by a two-digit
security code. TriggerAlarm is priced at $29.95, while TriggerShield
is $12.95.


WILD TYPE FROM ADOBE

Adobe announced the immediate availability of Adobe Wild Type, a
package of creative headline typefaces for Macintosh and IBM
compatible computers. Adobe Wild Type font software features nine new
Adobe Original typefaces, including Critter, Cutout, Studz, Rad,
Mythos, Toolbox, Quake, Giddyup and Giddyup Thangs. In addition, the
package has five typefaces adapted from existing Adobe Originals that
complement the Adobe Wild Type fonts. The package is available
immediately for a suggested retail price of $60.


TOKENPRINT SHIPPING

Dayna Communications has announced TokenPrint, a LocalTalk to Token Ring
bridge for connecting LocalTalk printers and other devices directly to
Token Ring networks. TokenPrint will connect up to two LocalTalk
devices to Token Ring, while TokenPrint Plus will connect up to four
LocalTalk devices. With the exception of routers, all types of
LocalTalk devices are supported, including all brands of printers,
network modems and Macintosh computers.


IBM ANNOUNCES NEW PENDOS

IBM announced a new version of the PenDOS system for pen computing. With
this release PenDOS is now available from IBM directly to end-users
for the first time, in addition to being pre-loaded on a variety of
pen- based computers from other vendors. PenDOS Version 2.2 brings a
broad range of pen-based capabilities, including handwriting
recognition in any one of six languages, to DOS applications. PenDOS
is now available to both end-users, OEMs, ISVs and systems
integrators. Single unit end- user pricing is $89. Volume discounts
are available for OEMs.


IBM ANNOUNCES PEN FOR OS/2

IBM's announced Pen for OS/2. Pen for OS/2 is a powerful pen computing
system that adds pen capabilities, with handwriting recognition, to
virtually any OS/2, DOS or DOS/Windows application.  Pen for OS/2 is
designed for mobile computing environments, where a keyboard can be
impractical, and for collaborative computing on the desktop. It
combines the strengths of OS/2 with full-featured pen capabilities,
including: integrated user-trainable handwriting recognition; a window
which adds handwriting recognition to most non-pen-aware applications;
standard and user-customizable gestures, and a pop-up keyboard.
Included as part of Pen for OS/2 are two applications - Telepen, a
collaborative computing system, and Sketchpad, a freehand drawing
tool. Pen for OS/2 is available now to end-users at a single-unit
price of $89.


IBM INTRODUCES PCDOS 6.1

IBM has introduced PC DOS 6.1, a full-featured, enhanced version of
the DOS operating system that includes valuable utilities from three
industry-leading vendors. PC DOS 6.1 is a robust product that includes
utilities from Central Point Software for backup, memory management
and scheduling, as well as IBM's AntiVirus technology. PC DOS 6.1 is
the only DOS to ship with pen extensions that enable the use of a pen
instead of a mouse and advanced software supporting PCMCIA cards,
through an agreement with Phoenix Technologies Ltd. PC DOS 6.1
includes proven, data compression technology from Addstor, Addstor's
SuperStor/ DS provides PC DOS 6.1 users with DoubleSpace-compatible
real-time data compression. PC DOS 6.1, which will be generally
available July 26, will ship with a coupon offering users a free
upgrade to the AddStor compression product. PC DOS 6.1 with
compression will be available later this year, once PSP has completed
additional integration and useability testing of SuperStor/DS.

WINDOWS WORLD QUICK REPORT

Windows World Expo/Tokyo '93 attracted 67,418 visitors to the
Nippon Convention Center to see the latest developments in Windows
technology. The exposition and conference, held June 16-18, nearly
doubled its attendance from the previous year (34,036). Interest in
Windows has skyrocketed since Microsoft released the Japanese version
of Windows 3.1 on May 17, 1993. Windows World brought together 119
companies utilizing 59,300 square feet of booth space, a 73 percent
increase in booth space over the previous year. Among the participants
were 58 new companies, including 27 exhibiting companies from
overseas. Show highlights included demonstrations of Windows for
Workgroups, Windows NT, Windows for pens, Video for Windows and
Modular Windows. A "Hands-on Corner" allowed visitors to sample many
new applications installed in Windows. Featured keynote speakers
included Benjamin Rosen, chairman of Compaq Computer, Sam Furukawa,
chairman of Microsoft Japan and Makoto Naruke, president of Microsoft
Japan. Microsoft founder Bill Gates addressed the Tokyo audience by
video.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK -- Newsday, a New York City and Long Island, New
York daily newspaper, has begun the simultaneous publishing of a
series of articles electronically and in print.

The series, "Riding The Information Highway," by staff writer Joshua
Quittner, began in Sunday, July 18 edition with an eight-page spread. It
was the cover story in the Long Island edition of the paper and was the
back page business feature in the New York City edition. The series,
which concludes on Wednesday, July 22, deals with the convergence of
computer, television and telephone technologies.

Newsday explained to readers the simultaneous publishing, saying, in
part, "This series on information highways can be read today in San
Francisco, Tokyo, Paris and Buenos Aires - but not on printed paper. For
the first time, Newsday is making a series accessible to anyone with a
personal computer and modem, from Long Island to Luxembourg."

The periodical then outlined the advantages of electronic 
publishing, saying the stories can travel from editor to reader in a 
fraction of the time it takes to print them and deliver them by truck. 
"Space is limited in a newspaper because of the cost of paper and
production, but the electronic version has a selection of related 
articles." Newsday concludes: "Readers can communicate directly with 
writers, both by electronic mail and a live chat period - a group 
conversation conducted online through personal computers."

The first stories contained interviews with Microsoft's Bill Gates,
economist George Gilder, Apple's John Sculley and other people
whose ideas and actions are shaping the future.

The sidebar then gave instructions to obtain the articles by
computer and modem: in Nassau, 516-599-2525; eastern Suffolk,
516-727-0177; west Suffolk, 516-665-7878; NYC, 212-385-2551 or
718-875-6504. After you are connected, type HH (upper case) and 
ENTER/RETURN. At asterisk, type 2129250054 and press ENTER/RETURN. 
Internet users can access the service via telnet to DELPHI.COM. 
At the "Username" prompt, enter HIGHWAY."

Series writer Joshua Quittner told Newsbytes, "I think it is 
tremendously exciting that Newsday is plunging deeply into the 
new technologies and is distributing this piece as far as the 
world-wide Internet will take it."
 
Mainstream publications like Newsday are just now beginning to 
discover electronic publishing, a domain that has for ten years 
been in use by many publications. Newsbytes has been publishing 
electronically worldwide via the Internet and other networks
since 1983.

I just wanted to post some positive information; so many posts are doom and

The Amiga reseller that I work at here in Huntsville is doing very well.  We
are selling significantly MORE Amigas this year than last year. MOST of them
are Amiga 4000/040.  We have sold many more A4000s than A1200s.  Many of
these A4000 purchases are by people/companies who have never owned an Amiga.  
They bought them for the Video Toaster 4000 or for other graphic applications.

@node P1-5-1 "Monopolizing DOS"
@toc "menu"


/// Commentary by Robert Niles



A few days ago I was driving up to the mountains for a bit of 
fishing when I heard on NPR (National Public Radio) the problem 
with Microsoft's hold over the DOS market. I'm talking about DOS 
as in Disk Operating System.

On the IBMs and even in the "Clone" world, these platforms are 
ran with Microsoft's MS-DOS. The DOS is the fundamental part of 
any platform, and any developer for the clones MUST adhere to a 
DOS when developing programs and hardware. And they NEED to use 
MS-DOS to make sure that their programs reach the largest part of 
the market.

It is projected that if the sales of MS-DOS increases as it 
currently has, then in the next 10 to 20 years there will be no 
other disk operating around for the IBM (and it's clones).

Possible? Who knows, but I understand what they are trying to say 
here. UNIX is a strong player, as with the MacIntosh, and even 
the Amiga has found a niche in the market, but we can already see 
what is happening with Apple now. You think CBM displayed 
problems here in the last months, look over to the Mac platform.
There's even some chunks being taken out of THAT apple!

The past shows that at anytime someone succeeds in monopolizing a 
market, that market stagnates, and new technologies come to us 
slowly if at all, even then, prices increase. The break up of Ma 
Bell hurt a bit in the short run, but the competitiveness brought 
to us services and technology that we now use for granted, with 
prices we can afford. WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO PICK AND CHOOSE!

Apparently there is an attempt to possibly break up Microsoft, 
who not only produces the most used DOS, but business software to 
boot. In doing so they are able to create products easier 
(because the are most familiar with the DOS) and cheaper, putting 
other developers at a disadvantage.

Break Microsoft up! I think it's right! This affects the IBMs the 
most, but in the long run it will affect each and every operating 
system out there. Keeping things as they are will strangle 
development on the IBM, and squeeze the rest of us even further. 
And it is counterproductive to the growth and technology of the 
computer market that we have all been witness to in the last 
decade.

Amiga users are quite loyal. BUT having other companies to 
compete against is the crucial point in bringing us such a wide 
range of platforms, hardware, and software. It's what makes this 
market grow and hopefully continue to achieve such potentials 
that we only could dream of. Remember 10 years ago, then look at 
what you have now.

See what I mean?

@node P1-5 "Shareholder Update"
@toc "menu"


/// Shareholder Movement Update!
    ----------------------------


     PRELIMINARY RELEASE:  THE COMMODORE SHAREHOLDER MOVEMENT, 7/18/93


UPDATE

Commodore shareholders and activists continue to send mail in response to
our June announcement.  We apologize for the delay in our response, but
there is so much information to compile and questions to answer, that the
most effective way of dealing with the volume is in the form of a press 
release.  This feedback  demonstrates a great deal of pent-up shareholder
frustration.  For some of you, the information contained in this release
may be redundant, but give special attention to how you might contribute
your efforts.


INTRODUCTION 

The users of Commodore computers should be happy to learn that the
Commodore shareholders are finally taking action to solve the company's
chronic problems which have led to its current grim situation.  This
movement which grew out of the concern of shareholders, developers and
dealers back in 1991 was faced with the daunting barriers of Bahamian law
and an uncooperative Board.  But now, with the recently revised SEC reg-
ulations on their side along with intensified shareholder interest, the
effort now stands a good chance.  The purpose of this communication is not
to obtain proxy authority form any shareholders, but rather to discuss why
this shareholder movement is likely to succeed, and to enlist the aid of
any persons or institutions willing to partake in the movement.


NEW SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS

For those interested in the new SEC regulations, you may find a copy at
many libraries which subscribe to the Federal Register.  This publication
documents Federal regulations soon after they are approved.
"Communications Among Shareholders" may be found in Volume 57, published
October 22, 1992, beginning on page 48276. The Summary states this:


"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announces the adoption of
amendments to its proxy rules promulgated under section 14(a) of the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act").  By removing un-
necessary government interference in discussions among shareholders of
corporate performance and other matters of direct interest to all 
shareholders, these rules should reduce the cost of regulation to both the
government and to shareholders.  The amendments eliminate unnecessary
regulatory obstacles to the exchange of views and opinions by shareholders
and others concerning management performance and initiatives presented for
a vote of shareholders.  The amendments also lower the regulatory costs of
conducting a regulated solicitation by management, shareholders and others
by minimizing regulatory costs related to the dissemination of soliciting
materials.  The rules also remove unnecessary limitations on shareholders'
use of their voting rights, and improve disclosure to shareholders in the
context of a solicitation as well as in the reporting of voting results."


BACKGROUND

The people behind this effort were present at the 1991 Commodore
Shareholders' Meeting.  A prominent Philadelphia attorney was thrown out of
the meeting for raising a "point of order" that the meeting be moved to the
United States where shareholders could attend.  This shareholder was bodily
removed from the meeting despite his clear assertion that he did not want
to leave.  Such action is typical of this well fortified and unresponsive
Commodore board of directors.  Another shareholder, who worked for
Commodore, warned the Board of the impending crisis of the MS-DOS price
wars.  The insufficient response on this point has, in great part, landed
Commodore in its current jeopardy.  Commodore's recent plummeting stock was
not a result of unforseen economic conditions in Europe as they would have
you believe, but  rather a direct result of the Board's unwillingness to
respond to the changing realities of the computer industry.  Since the
press coverage of the 1991 meeting, other people have joined the movement
including other shareholders and Commodore employees.


Similar attempts at affecting Commodore management have failed in the past.
But now, new SEC regulations have given shareholders new abilities.  The
rules which previously favored management now allow shareholders to vote
for board members that are not part of management's slate.  With well 
chosen candidates and a well run proxy contest, alternative directors stand
a good chance of usurping Irving Gould and Alexander Haig this time around.
Once succeeding in this contest, the new directors can get to the business
of commencing Commodore's long overdue recovery.


FEASIBILITY

There is a total of 3700 shareholders.  The latest Standard NYSE Stock
Report shows that Irving Gould owns only 19% of Commodore's common stock.
A total of 70 institutional investors account for 20.6% of ownership,
according to the Nelson's Directory of Investment Research.  According to
the new laws, these institutional investors may vote.  Further, the
remaining 60.4% of Commodore shareholders may be reached through an
official proxy campaign.  That 81% majority of votes may unite to elect
independent directors.  The three year terms of both Irving Gould and
Alexander Haig are up for reelection this year.


THE CURRENT BOARD OF DIRECTORS

A community of people including shareholders, businesses and customers
have a stake in Commodore's survival.  Irving Gould, the Chairman of the
Board and C.E.O. of Commodore International Limited is the greatest
barrier to Commodore's survival.  Gould has eroded the loyalty of their
only reliable revenue source (the customer base), driven Commodore into
debt, and brought the company to the edge of collapse (1993 3rd quarter
disclosure).  


Meanwhile, Gould has compensated himself with annual salaries of over
1.7 million dollars, plus stock options and bonuses (1992 Proxy Statement
3).  Shareholders who have already lost a great deal of money stand to
loose everything.  Commodore is also the sole source of Amiga computers,
a proprietary product in which many people have invested.  These customers
will be abandoned and possibly forced to buy products less suited to their
needs.  A top-caliber engineering team will be broken up, many small 
symbiotic companies will loose their market, and potentially successful
products will never be developed.


A NEW BOARD

The change of top-level management is believed to be Commodore's only
chance for survival.  This can be accomplished through the election of
new Directors.  The upcoming 1993 shareholder meeting presents the chance
to break Gould's stranglehold on the company and to replace him with
dynamic leadership.  A movement to nominate and elect new directors is
being organized.


Both Irving Gould and Al Haig are up for reelection to the Board of
Directors.  All shareholders should vote for the alternative candidates who
will become known in the following months.  Talks are being made with some
very exciting possible candidates.  With Gould gone, Commodore can start on
its path to recovery, being led by capable new Directors.  Without Gould,
the remaining Directors will likely step down.


CANDIDATES

We are open to suggestions regarding persons who might run against Irving
Gould and Alexander Haig for the Commodore Board of Directors, and are now
talking with a few possible candidates.  These people must have the
necessary abilities and reputation to get elected.  After elected, they
must be able to serve in a contentious environment until the remaining
directors are replaced.  They will start to correct Commodore's problems
and move the company forward.  Until a candidate states to us their
willingness to run, we will not discuss their names.  But the important
thing is that these candidates will not be part of management's slate.


We are constantly writing letters, on the phone, and communicating by
e-mail with people adding their efforts to the movement.  We are in
correspondence with the SEC and Commodore's legal council.  Currently, we
await Commodore's response to our request for the by-laws and shareholder 
list.  


PLANS

Our immediate strategy is to take advantage of the new SEC regulations,
and make our movement as publicly known as possible.  We hope to locate
and join efforts with other shareholders by working with magazines,
newspapers, and television.  This public exposure should aid us in 
pressuring Commodore to supply their governing by-laws and shareholder
list.


In order to nominate and elect new directors, we will ultimately have to
solicit proxy votes and attend the shareholder meeting.  This communication
is not a solicitation of proxy votes. To this end, we must first complete
the filing requirements with the SEC.  At that time, all Commodore share-
holders will be informed of the new candidates for directors via proxy
statement.  Meanwhile, we are allowed to talk about our intentions, and lay
the groundwork for popular support.  Proxies will come out some time in
September this year, and the shareholder meeting will be held some time in
November.  There is the possibility of organizing a group-trip to the
meeting, larger than that which occurred in `91. We would like to gauge
shareholder's ability to participate in this.


INFORMATION FOR NON-STOCKHOLDERS

If the shareholder movement is successful, then Commodore stock may have
been a smart investment.  Many companies have come back from the brink.
The purchase of stock will allow you to cast a proxy vote in the upcoming
election, or attend the shareholder meeting (at your own expense).  If you
were to wish to buy stock, you could contact a discount stockbroker.  There
would be a transaction fee which shouldn't be over $50.  To expedite the
proxy voting process, you would ask for the stock certificate to be sent 
to you.  You might get your friends to buy stock, or ask for it for your
birthday.  The process is easy and every vote helps.  Just remember the
risk if the effort fails.  You'll at least have the satisfaction of being
involved.  


SPREAD THE WORD 

If you buy or own any Commodore stock, contact us with your address.  Send
a letter or e-mail (MarcR@cup.portal.com).  Let everyone who might care
know what's going on.  Bring it up at the users' group meetings and write
articles for the newsletters.  Re-post this announcement.  Talk about it on 
the electronic bulletin boards.  Call talk radio shows.  Help us make
Commodore's situation into a news story.  Talk about the company with the
wonderful products and the destructive management.  Talk about how the
shareholders and users at long last are able to take the situation into
their own hands.  Use your imagination in thinking about strategies for
gaining exposure, and follow through!  Consider yourself our partners.
Send a copy to anyone you know who writes for financial or computer
publications.  Accompany it with your own letter in order to validate the 
topic of widespread concern.  Watch for future announcements, and keep
sending us feedback.

                    U.S. ROBOTICS SYSOP SUPPORT PROGRAM

General:

    This  section describes the rules  of the U.S.  Robotics SYSOP Program.
U.S. Robotics reserves  the right to  modify or change  these rules at  any
time.

Scope:

    The  U.S. Robotics SYSOP  Program permits QUALIFIED  SYSOPs to purchase
current U.S. Robotics  products at a  reduced price.   The purpose of  this
program  is to continue the  close relationship established  many years ago
between  U.S.  Robotics  and  the Sysop  community.    Participants  should
recognize that our  ability to continue  the program is dependent  upon the
strong  position U.S.  Robotics enjoys  in the  reseller channel,  with the
distributors and dealers,  VARs, etc. that continue  to buy and  resell our
products to home and business users around  the world.  It is our intent to
maintain the integrity of our channel relationships by closely scrutinizing
each SYSOP sale to ensure that we only sell products to qualified SYSOPs.



Qualifications:

     1.  The SYSOP states that he/she is NOT in the business of
         reselling computer products and/or related
         peripherals, including modems.  Qualified resellers
         may take advantage of other programs offered by U.S.
         Robotics by calling (800) 342-5877 and asking for the
         dealer sales representative for your area.

     2.  The SYSOP has been operating the bulletin board system
         for at least six (6) months and that this activity can
         be verified by dialing into the bulletin board system.
         Typically user logs, activity logs, and local message
         bases are a good source for verifying activity.

     3.  The SYSOP understands that the number of modems that
         may be obtained under this program is limited to the
         number of working, VERIFIABLE data lines.  Data lines
         MUST be dedicated for modem use only and MUST be
         available 24 hours a day for modem access.  Modems
         purchased under this program MUST be used on one of
         the stated lines.  Furthermore, the SYSOP understands
         that the number of serial cards that may be obtained
         is one for each 2 modems ordered under the SYSOP Program.
         Participants in the Sysop Program beginning 1/1/92 may
         purchase the Dual Async Card based on these rules as well.

     4.  The SYSOP agrees to post an appropriate logon notice,
         visible to users of the bulletin board, which states
         that said bulletin board uses and supports U.S.
         Robotics brand products.

     5.  The SYSOP agrees that he/she intends to operate the
         bulletin board, for which these products are purchased,
         for at least six (6) months post purchase.  The U.S.
         Robotics logon must remain in effect for six (6)
         months to allow verification that the bulletin board
         is in place and that the U.S. Robotics promotional
         message is being displayed.

     6.  The SYSOP agrees that, in order to avoid conflict with
         the U.S. Robotics reseller channel, modems purchased
         under this program cannot be re-sold without the
         expressed written consent of U.S. Robotics.
         Violation of this policy will result in the SYSOP's
         being ineligible for future participation in the U.S.
         Robotics SYSOP program.  In addition, any warranties
         on modems re-sold without U.S. Robotics authorization
         will be null and void.

     7.  The SYSOP understands that verification of an order will
         take from two (2) to five (5) weeks depending on the
         number of orders being processed by the SYSOP Support
         Department, and difficulty in verifying your bulletin
         board.  Shipment of product will take from two (2) to
         six (6) weeks pending availability of the particular product
         ordered.  U.S. Robotics will ship product(s) to
         QUALIFIED SYSOPs as soon as possible after:

         A.   The SYSOP completes the order form and
         questionnaire found on the U.S. Robotics BBS via
         the SYSOP command at the main menu.  These must be
         filled-out on-line as no mail-in orders will be accepted.

         Prepaid orders will not be processed until payment has
         been received by U.S. Robotics.  After placing an order
         on the board, a SYSOP wishing to prepay his/her order
         should send a money order or cashier's check to:

              U.S. Robotics SYSOP Support Program
              8100 McCormick Blvd.
              Skokie, IL 60076

         It is imperative that the SYSOP name, voice phone
         number and BBS phone number be indicated for identi-
         fication purposes.  A personal or company check is
         acceptable, but shipping will be delayed for ten (10)
         working days to ensure that the check clears our bank.
         NO CHECKS OR MONEY ORDERS WILL BE DEPOSITED BY U.S.
         ROBOTICS UNTIL THE SYSOP's BBS HAS BEEN VERIFIED.

ADDENDUM

We realize that  all Bulletin Boards are not the same and we are not always
able to ascertain their validity during our normal verification process. In
order not to exclude those Bulletin Boards from our program, we may request
additional information such as copies of telephone bills, proof of software
purchase  and/or registration and network and association membership.  This
information  will only be requested by U.S.  Robotics in rare cases and can
not be used solely as a means of qualification.

Before placing  an order, please take  steps to ensure the  process goes as
easily as possible.

 1. Create a login for U.S. Robotics
 2. Ensure no questionnaires or voting is necessary
 3. If your logon requires information other than password be
    sure to include this information on the order.
 4. Once this is established logon under the U.S. Robotics ID
    and look for verifiable proof of 6 months activity.  If
    you can't find it, odds are we won't be able to either.

** US Robotics CAN NOT download special software to verify  **
** your BBS.  We support the basic communication platforms. **

U.S. Robotics  is determined to provide  a SYSOP Program which  is fair and
equitable  to everyone.   Any requests  made of  SYSOPs in  order to verify
Bulletin Boards  are made in  order to ensure  that the program  serves the
entire SYSOP community and protect the USR distribution channel as well.

We will make every effort to process each and every order in a professional
and courteous manner.   Please help us to provide  the type of service  you
want and deserve by filling-out the order form as completely and accurately
as possible  and responding to our requests for additional information in a
prompt manner.

@node P1-7 "Atari Jaguar"
@toc "menu"


/// ATARI JAGUAR an IBM ANIMAL
    --------------------------
    By Junko Yoshida,
    
    From "Electronic Engineering Times", July 5, 1993

    Copyright 1993 by CMP Publications Inc.  All rights reserved.
    Reprinted under the "Reasonable Use" interpretation of the
    1976 Copyright Act.
 
Sunnyvale, Calif -- Atari Corp. will score a new level of videogame perf-
ormance this fall with the introduction of Jaguar, a 64-bit RISC-based
system offering realtime 3-D shaded surfaces with texture mapping.
 
The $200 system, able to tap into the growing network of cable and
telephone video services, will take videogames into a graphics realm once
the province of midrange 3-D workstations. In yet a further departure, the
system will be built by IBM Corp.
 
Jaguar, billed as an interactive multimedia system, is based on an Atari-
designed proprietary 64-bit RISC processor and its proprietary digital
signal processors. The cartridge-based system features 24-bit true color
graphics, shaded 3-D polygons and realtime texture mapping.
 
Atari claims that Jaguar offers four times the processing power of the
current 16-bit videogames form Sega and Nintendo, and believes it is even
more powerful than the coming 32-bit ARM CPU-based machine from 3DO Co.
"If a spaceship goes around a moon, or a person walking on a street turns
on the next corner, every object, every detail in such scenes is reproduced
in shaded 3-D images with texture. It's truly amazing stuff," said Atari 
president Sam Tramiel.

Dense ASICs
 
The system's graphics performance is compared by the company to that of the
3-D engines in midrange Unix workstations. And like those engines, Jaguar
is based on advanced, very dense digital ASICs.
 
Jaguar's core consists of two chip sets, one holding the 64-bit RISC
processor and the other containing DSP hardware. "But the partitioning
between the two chip sets is ambiguous," said Richard Miller, vice
president of research and development at Atari, as the two share some
functions. The two sets apparently pack a whole range of components,
including controllers, video processors and encoders, leaving outside the
core only "a very small amount of TTLs and DRAMs," said Miller. They were
designed at an Atari facility in England, said Tramiel.
 
The 64-bit RISC processor is capable of processing video data at a high
rate, handling various video effects as well as full-motion video com-
pression on its own, Miller claimed.

Lots of bandwidth
 
Atari would not disclose any more about the core ASICs, such as gate counts
or data bandwidth, but Miller pointed out that Atari engineers had to
concentrate most of their design efforts on bus bandwidth. "Graphics eats a
lot of bus bandwidth. What's available today for other 64-bit processors
such as PowerPC is only just enough for what we want to do," he said. "What
we designed is right up on the level of expensive 64-bit processors."
 
To meet its cost goals, Atari had to push ASIC technology to the limit. The
chip sets will be manufactured by "one of the top four silicon vendors in
the world" using the "smallest geometry" available, said Miller. It is
believed that with Jaguar Atari has become one of the early customers for a
major Japanese 0.5-micron ASIC process, but the company would not confirm
this.
 
Clearly, manufacturing volume is essential to the Jaguar plan. The company
intends to introduce an add-on PC card featuring the company's proprietary
64-bit RISC processor, said Tramiel. "It could also help minimize the cost
of our chip sets," he said.
 
Atari is also considering licensing the chip set to other silicon vendors,
but has not determined any details yet, said Tramiel.
 
The future holds more integration. But before working on the ultimate, a
system on a chip, the next step for Atari's engineering team is to shrink
what is currently a set of rather large custom chips further, reducing the
whole system to "one processor, one DRAM, one ROM and one custom chip,"
said Miller. The company is looking at both synchronous DRAMs and Rambus
DRAMs for future use, "but we are waiting to see some of the standards
issues get settled first," he noted.
 
Miller does have a technological wish list. "First," he said, "we'd love to
have 0.3-micron process technology as soon as possible for custom ICs.
Second, we'd like to see some form of synchronous DRAMs appear as a
standard commodity DRAM, and, naturally, a very high bus bandwidth to
produce higher video performance. The existing improvements for faster bus
interfaces so far have been very disappointing for us. Lastly, I'd love to 
play the Atari Jaguar system on a 10 x 10-foot display. I'm waiting for a
very low cost, low power, large-screen-size display, using probably not an
active matrix but FED-type technology."
 
In the long run, Jaguar is designed not just as a cartridge-based game
machine. It will use a 32-bit expansion port to connect to cable and
telephone networks, and a digital signal processing port for modem usage
and connection to digital audio peripherals.
 
This I/O structure reflects Time Warner's 25 percent stake in Atari. "In
the course of our product development, we've had frequent discussions with
Time Warner. It has set the direction for our machine to have cable and
telephone connections," said Leonard Tramiel, vice president of operating
systems.
 
The company designed and built a 16-bit prototype home-entertainment
machine two years ago, said Sam Tramiel, but scrapped the plan in favor of
a grand attempt to leapfrog the 16-bit systems that were then coming onto
the market. But when Atari engineers stated to look for enabling
technology, "there were no RISC processors and no DSPs that fulfilled our
requirements, especially at our cost," said Miller. Atari's design team
even had to develop its own HDL simulation tools, he said.
 
"People tend to forget that, unlike business users, consumers do have much
higher expectations in video quality, speed and cost," Miller said. "In
order to match that demand, we had to really push the technological
envelope, driving the chip counts down, designing the system to be highly
manufacturable and depending on the smallest geometry process technology."

IBM the OEM
 
Atari will also push the envelope in another way, turning its back on tra-
ditional East Asian manufacturing sites and calling on IBM to build Jaguar.
IBM, working with a 30-month contract worth $500 million, will be res-
ponsible for component sourcing, quality testing, console assembly,
packaging and distribution, and will build the system at its Charlotte,
N.C. facility. The motherboard will come from an IBM-approved manufacturer,
said Herbert Watkins, director of application solutions manufacturing at
IBM Charlotte.
 
For IBM, producing the Atari Jaguar system makes it for the first time a
major OEM for highly cost-competitive, mass consumer-electronics products,
Watkins noted.
 
"To manufacture one of the most sophisticated game machines in the world,
we needed someone who understood a high-volume, fast digital machine," said
Miller. "IBM was a natural choice."
 
According to IBM, the prototypes of the Atari Jaguar system will come out
in July, ramp-up models in August and mass-production versions in
September. The system will be available first on a limited basis in the
fall in the New York and San Francisco areas. A national rollout is
scheduled for next year.

/// Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users
    --------------------------------------



                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA or through Tymnet from anywhere in
North America.  If you have an account on another Internet-connected
system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet programs, from
anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users can now Telnet
into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 - Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files, online, 24 hours a day.
   Portal has dedicated a 2.5 GIGabyte disk drive to the Amiga Zone.
   We have virtually unlimited space for files and new uploads. 

 - The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable
   software, online.  All of it.  Every disk.  Well-organized so
   it's easy to find exactly what you're after.

   and many others including Compute's Amiga Resource with over
   4 Megabytes of exclusive Compute magazine disk stuff you won't find
   elsewhere.

 - 35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.  Since Portal has FTP connections we can get
   new freely-distributable software online within MINUTES of its 
   being announced on Usenet.

 - No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.  Start downloading
   files with your first session on Portal. 

 - Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.
   Instead of stumbling around in frustration you can talk to the
   people who design your hardware, who write your software.

 - Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

 - Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.

 - Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  Usenet feeds into Portal many times each hour.
   There are 14 Amiga-specific Usenet newsgroups with hundreds of
   articles posted every day, including postings by Commodore 
   personnel.  Since Usenet is distributed worldwide, your questions
   and answers can be seen by literally hundreds of thousands of
   people the same day you post them.  

 - Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
 - Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
 - All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

 - Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.

# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Tymnet 9600bps services is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

Ah yes, another fine week in that fine country in which that fine computer-
maker Commodore International resides (except legally).  It's now official,
Atari's stock has gone higher than Commodores, and after all, why shouldn't
it?  Atari is introducing a next-generation 64-bit game machine that's
going to be manufactured and distributed by IBM.  Commodore's coming out
with... uh, well, a new program to restructure their debt.  Hopefully.  Or
the government will do it for them (they call it bankruptcy).  On the bright
side of things, though, there is some sort of movement picking up steam with
the shareholders; they actually want to make a _change_ (beginning with
Gouldzilla, I hope), and the US Government now actually gives them a chance.
(Now _this_ is astounding!)  If you're interested, and you have a few hundred
bucks to spare (or you already own Commodore Deflated International stock), be
sure to check it out; you should be able to find the information somewhere on
your favorite service.  Lets hope it works!  The Commodore team (aside from
upper management) is too good to send packing to Microbrain or some other lame
PC plug in card manufacturer.  At least I know I wouldn't want to be sitting
in some sweatshop designing Yet Another Incompatible Soundcard, would you?
Which reminds me, did you hear that some Microbug VP said Windows NT was going
to be the SOLE operating system for ALL computers in about 20 years and that
there would be NO competition?  Kind of scary because it just might end up
being true (only because of Microstooge's virtual monopoly in several areas of
the computer business, though).  But at least _some_ of us will still be
plugging away at the old Amiga, eh?

[Editor's Note:  Hey, if the gov't made Bell break up due to monopolization,
I think they should force Microsoft to break up too!  One company can then
specialize in Title Bars, another in Pull-Down Menus, another in Dialog
Boxes.  Then, if you buy Company X's product, you give them the names and
numbers of all your friends.  They call them up and harrass them.  If your
friends (who by that time may no longer be your friends) buy their software
too, you get a 20% discount next time you buy software from Company X.
Make sense?  I hope not.]

Speaking of plugging away, I have discovered recently a new Murphy's Law
of Computers.  It goes like this: a 20 line program will take just as much
time to complete as a 1000 line program.  I have proven this by actual
clinical trials: namely, I sat down the other day to write a short little
program for my Amiga and its ended up taking me more time than I spend on most
of my programming assignments for school.  That _really_ ticks me off.  There
is also a corollary to this rule, and it says:  Any program you ever write
will cause a new bug in your compiler to be found.  This happens without
exception, even though you may not visibly see its effects.  For every program
you compile without a noticeable bug biting you, you will be stricken by a 10
times larger bug sometime in the future.  Its true, ask any software engineer.
Heck, I've even hit bugs in a VMS compiler, and that system is as old as God;
you think they would have any bugs a student programmer would find worked out,
don't you?  Well, just remember that the next time your Amiga gurus during
your startup-sequence.

And now a note for all of you that wrote in about that wonderful new
terminal program Terminally Ill by the Foo brothers: STOP IT!  Unfortunately
Bill and Jim Foo have been arrested for using an Atari 2600 to influence
William Sessions behavior these past few years, and I have a feeling we won't
be seeing them for a long time to come.  Unfortunately they handed the rights
to Terminally Ill over to Borland, which means we'll never see the Amiga
version.  Fortunately the papers they handed over were slightly modified, in a
somewhat malicious way.  Let's just put it this way; you thought the
Michelangelo virus was going to be bad?  Heh heh heh...

Well folks, I'm going to cut my li'l ol' article a li'l ol' short this
week.  Yes, yes, I know you'll miss my dagger-sharp wit and profound insight
into the state of affairs of life, the universe, and everything; but have no
fear, for I shall return once again next week with another exciting episode of
AMIGA, the only column that dares to swim in the toilet and pee in the pool.

Joke of the week:

Q.     If Irving Gould had half a brain, what would he be?
A.     A bumbling idiot with half a brain!

See you next week!

/// Send in the Clones!  Part III
    -----------------------------
    By Marcus Albers
    (malbers@ns.ccsn.edu)



Send In The Clones III:  Clones, Clones, Clones, Clones...
----------------------------------------------------------

For the past couple of weeks, I have been looking at some of the better
clones of arcade games that are currently available on InterNet.  From
Pac-Man to Boulder Dash to Street Fighter II, they're all out there, folks.
Now you know about them.  I'd like to wrap up this series with a look at a
couple of my favourites:  Galaga, Asteroids, and Street Fighter II.

*** Street Fighter II ***

If you do not know what this game is by now, then you have been leading a
very sheltered life and you should get out more.  Take a look at any video
game discussion on any BBS, and you will inevitably hear the name Street
Fighter II pop up.  The game itself has spawned a Classic Edition, Turbo
Edition, Hyper Fighting, and Turbo Hyper Fighting for those of you that
cannot get enough speed.  They are great fun if you have had a bad day and
feel the urge to just beat someone to a bloody pulp.  Of course, as we all
know, this comes with a price, in the form of small circular silver pieces
that we so affectionately call quarters.  And buying it for your computer
is better in the long run, but there is still the matter of shelling out
all that money in the first place.  Can't I play it for free (legally)?
Well, TAH DAH!  Here it is (sort of).

Fighting Warriors

This is the closest thing that I have been able to come up with, and it
serves its purpose admirably, I might add.  Fighting Warriors would have
been, IMHO, more aptly titled "Ken vs. Ryu", for this seems to be the game.
The two characters on the screen are the spitting image of Ken and Ryu,
both dressed in white karate garb.  The whirlwind kick and fireball are
available to both players, if you ever figure out how to use them.  The
computer uses them at its leisure, but I have yet to be able to perform
either one deliberately (I have done so while moving the joystick in every
possible direction in utter frustration).  The character graphics are
excellent.  The sunset-type of background is very nice, although I would
have liked to see the changing backgrounds of SFII.  The digitized sounds
are a little scratchy, but are none-the-less very good.  A nice game for
the days when punching out your boss just doesn't seem to be the smartest
thing to do.

*** Asteroids ***

A classic to be certain.  This is very possibly one of the first arcade
games to be a hit.  I still love to walk into a Holiday Inn and see one of
these beauties sitting in their arcade.  I will spend about as much time on
this as any game.  Of course, I am a sucker for ancient games.  But she's
been Amiga-tized to keep up with the times.  And readily available in at
least three different versions.

Meteor

This is the least desirable of the three.  The sounds are great, the
graphics are not bad, but the game play is comparable to clones found on
the venerable old C64.  The main problem that I have with this version is
that the ship doesn't accelerate like it used to.  You instantaniously go
from stop to warp speed (I don't think she'll take much more of it, captain)
without the slightest hesitation.  It then slows just a quickly to a
floating speed when you let up on the gas.  This becomes very awkward when
trying to manuvoure through millions of little tiny asteroid bits.

Asteriods

Notice the spelling on this one.  I do not know what that has to do with
the actual game, nor does the other title that I have seen it under have
any connection with the game: wetroids.  This is simply Asteroids with
weird graphics.  Instead of shooting space rocks, you are now blasting away
at taunting, digitized heads of some unknown hackers.  The game play is
very smooth, and the graphics, although mono, are in high-res interlace,
always a plus in my book.  Check this one out if you get the chance.

Now, for my personal pick of the crop...

Amigoids

This is the Amiga-tized version of Astreroids that the world has been
waiting for.  Game play has not changed.  You are still shooting little
rocks in space.  But this version sports such features as 32-colour
graphics, user configurable graphic images, and a two-player option.
The graphics for the game are loaded in from templates that can easily
be modified with DPaint, or any paint program that supports 32 colour,
320x200 graphics to produce what ever you want to shoot.  Included are
graphics that make it look like the original vector graphics, a template
that turns it into the old Atari 2600 game, and even little Amigas and
diskettes (its not too hard to imagine that they are IBM-compatibles).
I have also seen a version of the template on the net that turns your ship
into a little Lemmings killer, for those of you fed up with the Psygnosis
classic.  The game supports a two-player simultanious mode, for those of
you who cannot handle the meteor shower alone.  You even have the option
of controling both ships at the same time, side-by-side, to double your
chances of survival.  The game also has true stereo sound.  It utilizes
the stereo sound channels in such a way so that is your ship is on the left
side of the screen, it will sound like it is on the left side of the screen.
As you move over to the right, the sound moves along with it.  This is true
for every sound effect in the game, except for the maniacal laughter when
you die, which seems to come from everywhere when hooked up to a good
stereo system.  If you cannot tell, this game is a must have.  Find it
somewhere and grab hold of it quick.

*** Galaga ***

OK, one more.  We all remember the Space Invaders clone Galaxians (say yes).
This went on to become Galaga.  Then there was Galaga'89.  Well, now there
is Galaga '92.

Galaga '92

This is a super Amiga-tized shoot'em up that has it all: weapon power-ups,
end-of-level baddies, great graphics, smoooooooth game play.  It is a very
lovely game.  There are power-ups for increasing the number of shots that
you put out, doubling the shots, and increasing your speed.  Yes, there is
also one to give you an extra ship.  The programmer boasts over 250 frames
of animation, multiple levels, and a secret creat mode that, supposedly,
you cannot complete the game without.  The only complaint that I have is
the fact that the game becomes VERY hard VERY quickly.  IF you lose your
power-ups in the fifth level and up, you may just as well die quickly and
begin again.  Frustrating, but a great game all together.

Well, that about does it for the world of the clones.  There are hundreds
more where these came from.  Some good, some really bad.  Give them a try.
You may be suprised.  See you next week for another look into the world
of Amiga shareware and public domain.

@node P1-10-1 "Amiga and Science"


/// The Amiga and Science
    by Robert Niles


With it's graphic capabilties and flexabilty, the Amiga would seem to be
one of the platforms most used in the field of science.

As an introduction I went through some of the programs available to get
an idea of what was being done on the Amiga in the scientific "arena".
Where as these programs by no means show all of the files out there that
introduce us to or show us the whole field of science, it might set
you off to see what there is available in fields that interest you most.

As a parent, I definately would like to see more of these programs as an
aid in helping children grow and learn all they possibly can.

The reviewed files below can be found on most @{"commercial online systems" link P4}, 
on many BBSes, or if you can't find them anywhere else they are available 
to download or to File REQuest on @{"In The MeanTime" link P2-1-2} (The names of the 
files as they appear on "In The MeanTime are in parenthesis).




Ephem v4.28 (EPHEM428.LHA), by Elwood Downey (1992)

Ephem is a program that displays ephemerides for all the planets plus any
two additional objects.  The additional objects may be fixed or specified
via heliocentric elliptical, hyperbolic or parabolic orbital elements to
accommodate solar system objects such as asteroids or comets.


Electron Demonstration (ELETRN1.LZH and ELETRN2.LZH)

Very good demonstration of how electrons work and their properties.
Includes the periodic table, and shows the flow of electrons through a diode.


Evo (EVO.LZH), by Steve bonner (1987)

A human evolution demonstration program. Gives background information
on the sapien class with a visual progression of changes through the 
years. Small glossary of terms also included within the program.


StarChart v1.2 (STARCHRT.LZH), by Ray R. Larson

StarChart is a program that lets you display and identify about 600
stars, galaxies and nebulae visible in the Northern hemisphere.
The display can be set for any location, time, and date.


CELLS v1.2 (CELLS.LHA), by Davide Cervone

CELLS is a program that allows you to create Cellular Automata based 
on the 2-dimensional cell-space called "WireWorld" using the set of states
and rules described in the January 1990 Computer Recreations column of the 
Scientific American magazine (Sci Amer, Jan 1990, pp 146-149). CELLS lets 
you create your own circuits in WireWorld and gives you the ability to see 
them in action, with electrons flowing through their cellular wires. There 
are many more Cellular Automation programs available, but this is a good 
one for introducing the concept.

OVERVIEW

	Gunship 2000 ("GS2000") is primarily a helicopter flight simulator
in the same kind of way you might describe Birds of Prey as a aircraft
flight simulator.  There is what seems to be a good flight model for
helicopters (note that I am not a pilot for real :-), and a good bit of
blasting tacked on.


GAMEPLAY

	The gameplay is overall very good:  much better than any other
similarly pitched combat/flight simulator I have played (which include Birds
of Prey, B 17, Reach for the Skies).

* Main Selection Screen

	This allows you to choose mission types, theatre of operations
(currently "Gulf" or "Western Europe" but more are promised), pilot/flight,
and to go on to the briefing.  Selection is by hotspots in an animated
graphic (the guy at the desk is writing :-)).

* Briefing
	
	Three options here are to read the briefing notes, choose and equip
a helicopter (or the entire flight, see below), or to proceed with the
mission. The briefing notes detail all the important information, including
wind, visibility (which should influence your weapon choice), targets, time
of day, enemy activity, map locations and map, etc.  Most of this is
accessible in some form during flight.  Wind direction is an exception and
can be important if it is strong, so take note.

* Training

	The start point is as a novice combat helicopter pilot and a choice
of training missions or single helicopter missions.  Training is for you to
learn how to fly, to use all the helicopter systems, and develop tactics
with no risk (and no points).  The training missions are the same as the
real thing except you take no damage when hit.  With all the flying aids
switched on, the only way to "die" is to hit the ocean, and even then you
haven't lost your pilot.

* Combat

	So having got the hang of blasting numerous targets in training, you
will take on the real world using a limited range of helicopters (some are
for higher ranks only) and weaponry.  The missions are flown from land bases
or an assault ship against primary and secondary targets which range from
fixed placements and airfields to mobile recon groups or columns of T-72s.
The number of different land/sea/air types you come across is large and
includes MIGs, SU-27s, HINDS, patrol boats, numerous tank and other vehicle
types, SAMs, infantry, oil refineries (large explosions!), oil rigs,
mosques, advertising hoardings....  This is just a cross-section from the
Gulf Theatre.

	When in flight, most of your tactical planning will be done on your
in-flight map (F10) which has a strategic and operational level (a zoom).
All identified targets show up as well as bases, buildings, etc.  It's here
you can set up to three waypoints to aid your in-flight navigation
(accessible through at least three different displays during flight).  When
on this screen, action is paused so you can take your time in planning.
This is very important when commanding a flight.

	Successful missions bring promotions, medals, and points (not
necessarily the first two :-)).  Gaining sufficient points results in the
offer of a commission to lead a flight of 5 helicopters.  You can turn this
down, but why miss out?

	Commanding a flight gives you two more options in the flight
selection screen, FLIGHT and CAMPAIGN.  These are essentially the same but
the campaign is linked sorties rather than one-offs.  Now you have four
other guys who you have to assign helicopters and weapon loads according to
the task in hand.  You can split the flight into light and heavy sections to
perform different tasks.  The range of tasks now includes search and rescue,
cargo drops and squad drops/pick-ups.

	Once all armed and ready, you are on the pad where you access you
tactical map and start giving individual flight plans.  On the higher level
map, you can also tell each flight member what height and speed to fly at
and whether they are free to engage the enemy or not (weapons are either
free or held).  Other options are to disengage, regroup, land, return to
base, fly the indicated flight plan or drop cargo.

	The tactical map is the guts of the game in a lot of respects, as
here is where you plan all your tactics and execution.  Timing is important
as is planning flight paths and protecting the vulnerable members of the
flight.  You must always keep your objectives in mind (there's a summary on
the strategic map) and keep the other flight members in tight control.  For
key jobs, you often have to assume responsibility and go in yourself, but
you could command from the rear.  The computer AI for your buddies seems
good with sensible weapon selection (helped of course by your choosing the
load they carry) and a downright enthusiasm for taking out targets (sometimes
too enthusiastic).  The flight is generally every bit as efficient as you
are and takes comparable damage.  Often flight members are up for more
medals and promotions than you are.

	Seeing a well laid plan come to fruition and hearing the digitised
"Primary objective confirmed" from the back seat is very satisfying.


GRAPHICS AND SOUND

	The detail in the game is very good, certainly compared to other
similar style games.  There is a lot of terrain including roads through
canyons, pylons down roads, camels, oases, etc.  Visibility can be variable
and is well reflected:  it is genuinely more difficult to see when visibility
is bad through the use of different palettes.  Although some hills look more
like pyramids, there is a good feeling of texture to the land, and you do
feel like you're skimming along at an unhealthy rate very close to the
ground.

	The detail and speed of moving objects is very good as well.  On my
Amiga 1200 at 100 feet doing 140 knots, it seems plenty fast enough and not
as jerky as Birds Of Prey on an Amiga 500.  A friend reports that an
unaccelerated A2000 handles the game on full detail well (and he has Red
Baron).  On an A3000, I expect it to be a dream.

	Still pictures within the game are well drawn but nothing really
spectacular.  For those who know English cricket, the guy who is there to
comment on your mission afterwards is a doppleganger of Robin Smith.  His
wit isn't up to much.

	There is quite a lot of digitised speech with your counter
measures/weapons buddy pointing out targets and missiles.  A minor gripe is
that, apart from missiles or when you lose your optics, it is obvious there
is a target and "target left/target right/target confirmed/missile
left/right" becomes hard, fast and distracting.

	Another nice touch is the missile explosions.  Even if you don't get
hit, the explosion can be heard according to how close it is and will even
shake the 'copter so you can often be fooled into thinking you have been hit
when you haven't.  If the guy in the back doesn't scream "We're hit! We're
hit!"  and damage show on the panel then you're OK.

	Other sound effects are for the engine, rotors (yes there is engine
noise and the "thuwp" of rotors), explosions, rocket launches, cannons,
stirring selection screen music plus a few other tunes.


FLIGHT MODEL AND WEAPONS

	I have never even flown in a real helicopter let alone piloted one,
so I really can't say how accurate the model is compared to the real thing.
It does feel true, and the interaction between the collective and stick seems
very realistic and tricky to handle.  Wind is noticeable and a real factor.
Loss of stabilising influences, like (say) your tail :-), has a real and
dramatic effect (you spin round continuously :-)).  Weapon systems recoil
which has a subtle effect in that it slows your forward motion.  At high
speed, this has the effect of making you gain height as the nose comes up.

	Generally, firing weapons is OK except for rocket pods which need to
be aimed in a straight line.  This involves fancy flying because if you pull
up at 140 knots to fire, you gain a lot of height very quickly and slow to a
crawl.  In this position you are a sitting duck, so only use the M series
pods for turkey shoots.

	The array of weaponry is helicopter dependent; and as the available
helicopter is rank dependent, you only get the really good "fire and forget"
stuff later on.  In fact, the low rank missions are the real trial since with
better helicopters, weapons and more experience the later flights are easier
in many respects.


DOCUMENTATION

	The manual is what most have come to expect from Microprose these
days.  It is clear, reasonably well written and very full of information.
Unfortunately, the manual skimps a bit in certain areas, like what the detail
levels mean or exactly what is expected for certain mission types.  If you
want the armour for a T-72 then you're fine, but that isn't too much help.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

	The worst element is the very dodgy mouse handling for certain
screens.  From what I have found out from others and experience is that
accelerated machines, that is anything other than a 68000, has a juddery
mouse problem.  This makes selection very tiresome, especially on the
helicopter/munitions screen.  The keyboard alternatives don't seem to work
fully as advertised either.  Shoddy work.

	In flight, I haven't had any control problems except having to zero
my analogue by taking it to the map screens and correcting the drift on the
detailed map (tactical) where you can scroll around.  Again a bit shoddy.

	The game does also guru on my A1200 for an unknown reason.  I've
disabled the cache to no effect (doesn't cure the mouse problem either).  I
haven't tried using the ECS chipset as it boots fine in AGA and I don't see
why I should.  The guru frequency is low (about once per day) but seems to
only occur during flight which is annoying.

	Another gripe is the leaving out of the recording feature, by which
you could record and play back missions.  Reach for the Skies does this
without slowing, so why not GS2000 on my nippy A1200?  If it did adversely
affect speed I could turn down the detail or not use the feature or suffer a
marginally worse frame rate.  Let me choose though!!  I infer a lack of time
to do the full job.  I don't believe a 386 PC is any more capable.

	My main like is the overall quality of the graphics, sound, gameplay
and flight model.  This is an extremely addictive game to play and certainly
one of the best I have played.  Apart from the niggles above this is one
superb offering and will undoubtedly set a standard to be followed.  I've
not fully described all the features (check out the README file!) but there
is plenty to hook you and keep you going.  For seat-of-the-pants flying and
blasting action, Gunship 2000 is going to be hard to beat.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

	Compared to Birds of Prey, B17 or Reach for the Skies, GS2000 wins
hands down.  This is one excellent game.


BUGS

	Dodgy mouse, keyboard, analogue stick handling (see DISLIKES).  No
mouse or keyboard problem on a A2000 though (and presumably a A500).
Undiagnosed guru on A1200; none reported on an A2000.


CONCLUSIONS

	A tremendous game packed with very high quality gameplay, graphics,
sound.  If you like action and flight simulators, this is a very good game
to buy.

Subj:   Amiga Report, what else?

I just wanted to drop a quick line to tell you that Amiga Report is, for lack
of a better word, incredible.  You and your staff (please pass the word on, if
you get a chance) do a wonderful job putting the magazine together week after
week (I believe I've read three straight now), and it keeps getting better...

I'll say this about the AmigaGuide format: it's neat, and it let me see what
hypertext is all about, but the downfall is that it's annoying as hell to read
without a hyper reader...and I'll admit, those are pretty easy to come across
in the Amiga world, but I, at least, am trying to get IBM-people to read it,
and I just had to ask them to ignore the hypertext stuff. Just a comment,
really, I wouldn't suggest you change it. I'll leave you alone now, and let
you flip through your other mail. Just a final thanks for putting out a great
magazine.

Hiya.. Just dropping a line to say congrats on Ar.. Keep up the good work!



                       -----------------------------



I don't ordinarily run compliment letters, because I feel like we're
tooting our own horn.  But in this case, I'll make an exception. The reason
is because I try to personally answer each message I receive.  In the case
of these two, my replies were returned by the mail system as 'user not
found.'  So I figured I'd reply here.

I wanted to thank you guys for the kind words!  We put a lot of work into
the magazine, and I'm glad people are enjoying it.  I'm amazed that it has
become such a hit.  If somebody had come to me back in January and said,
"You'll be producing a hit Amiga magazine in three months," I wouldn't have
believed it.

Anyway, about the AmigaGuide format.  Initially, I wasn't too hot on the
idea myself.  I too kinda prefer to just page through the magazine with an
ASCII reader, but after several AG issues, and with our format style growing
and improving, I'm growing to like it.  Most of all, more people like it
than those that don't, so I have to lean toward the majority.  But that's
why we try to keep the majority of the AG codes at the bottom of the
magazine.  I won't be able to keep it that way forever, because as we come
up with better ideas, it may require that more codes be placed in the actual
text.  We'll do our best though, to ensure that its readable in whatever
way you prefer.

A fellow with a lisp enters a bar and asks the bartender for shot of
scotch.

The bartender hands it to him and asks for $8.
  The customer says, "Damn, thath high" and pays.

Then he says, "Pleath leth me havth a drink ofth bourbon".

The bartender hands him the drink and asks for $7.
  Customer says, "Damn, thath high" and pays.

Next he says, "Bartender, pleath leth me havth a drink ofth vodka".

The bartender hands him the drink and asks for $6.
  He again says, "Damn, thath high" and pays.

Then he says, "Thit I gotta go, thankth".

The bartender then says, "Thank you for not mentioning my affliction".
  The customer says, "What afflicthion?"

The bartender then says, "Didn't you notice the hump on my back?"

Customer says, "Hump?  Hump?  I thought that wath your ath, everything elth
 ith tho high in here".


(I hope no one is offended.)           <grin>
