    compt.sys.editor.desk                          By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

I really don't want to think about how many times I've had to write this
editorial.  Oh, the wording is different, and the people and the places are
somewhat different, but it's never fun to have to deliver the same news
more than once...and in the past few years, I've said this a lot.

But it still has to be said.  No, there is no major news involving the
Amiga acquisition.  No, it was not completed on or near September 20th,
which is the date we all thought was THE date.  Yes, we all want it to be
done really soon and realize that waiting is annoying and unproductive.
And yes, the discussions are continuing, which means that VIScorp still
wants to buy and Escom's trustee still wants to sell.

I'm not sure what's scarier...the fact that I've said this so many times
over the years in Amiga Report, or the fact that thanks to the people at
CUCUG's Amiga Web Directory, you can do a search on all the old Amiga
Report issues and find out for yourself.  Seriously, CUCUG does a great job
and Amiga Report is very thankful for the AR hosting, AR searching, Agnes
Amiga-web related searching, and the monstrous Amiga Web linking they
provide.  You'd do yourself a favor to check out CUCUG's Amiga Web
Directory if you never have.  I'll go so far as to say it is for Amiga Web
users what Aminet is to Amiga FTP users.  http://www.cucug.org/amiga.html
is the magic link.

Some people on Usenet are even more annoyed than I am at hearing me say
that we've got to wait longer, which they attribute to my position as
Communications Manager handling Amiga inquiries and news for VIScorp.  I
suppose to a large extent, they're right.  Nobody likes to hear that they
have to wait, least of all from an official source.  (I seem to remember
that during the Commodore auction, we were hardly ever lucky enough to get
a trustee or court-related announcement, which of course meant that at any
given time you could discount or accept any rumor) Now you good readers
(many of which are on Usenet, following the same threads and getting just
as annoyed) have to read it here, in Amiga Report, which is still my
magazine and will stay that way.  That may make you even more upset.

If this should happen, just keep this in mind: if it wasn't me at VIScorp,
it would be someone else as the Communications Manager handling Amiga
inquiries and news.  And that someone else would tell the Editor-in-Chief
of Amiga Report that he had to wait like everyone else.  And he'd be right,
too.  I DO have to wait along with everyone else.

Of course, the Editor in Chief of Amiga Report would tell this
Communications Manager that he felt VIScorp needed to act decisively, to
push ahead with the Amiga and make the community feel informed and kept up
to date with the happenings of the deal.  The Communications Manager would
say he and the company were doing everything possible at the moment to push
ahead with the acquisition.  At a personal level, he might even point out
to the Editor in Chief that there was only so much he could personally do,
since the acquisition cash was hardly coming out of his own pocket, and
that there was only so much any company could do, because sometimes the
scenarios look a bit different to a Communications Manager than they do to
an Editor in Chief.

The bottom line of this exchange is this: we all hate to wait.  You hate to
wait, I hate to wait, our writers and editors hate to wait, and VIScorp
hates to wait.  Nobody benefits.  However, if we believe in this thing that
is the Amiga, and will do our individual best to keep the unpopular belief
that computing should be, all at once, productive, fun, and personal, it's
a bit more bearable.  Why do you think I got involved in Amiga Report in
the first place?  Tired of watching events unfold around me, I decided to
get involved in a productive way.

Does being a contractor for VIScorp affect my ability to report on the
Amiga?  In a word, no.  What would the hypothetical Communications Manager
of VIScorp tell the Editor in Chief of Amiga Report that I personally, as
both, can't tell you now?  Nothing.  But since I am in the unique position
of being both people, I can tell you that the view from the business inside
is not the same as it is from the journalistic outside.  Trying to find a
harmony between them, ah, that's the challenge.

Enjoy the issue.

- Jason

PS: It's been quite some time since we've had a good, educational
discussion threaded through several issues of AR.  I'd like to suggest a
topic.  Please submit your thoughts, preferably in letter or opinion
article form, on the following issue: A good system of "Electronic Cash"
could help promote the growth of Amiga businesses (specifically, the
third-party and retailer markets) worldwide.

From: Nick Christie <nmc@dircon.co.uk>
Subject: AR410 Letters: Value of a PPP connection

Hi Jason,

I write in response to the letter from Rob Knop in the Reader's Mail
section of Amiga Report 410, in which he promotes the use of a Unix shell
account, particularly for email:

1.  Ease of use: while a shell account may be easier to set up than, say,
AmiTCP, you won't have the familiarity of Amiga-style GUI-based software.

2.  Speed: With a shell account, you cannot download your email in a minute
or two and read/respond off-line.  When browsing the web, you can turn off
the downloading of graphics, while still maintaining the option to retrieve
them if you wish.  As for the behaviour of Lynx, I do not believe it
retrieves only one screen- full of text at a time.  In any case, almost all
graphical web browsers display text as it is received; you do not have to
wait.

3.  Availability: A shell account is extremely accessible, but a PPP
account can be reached from any machine running a PPP client.  The only
drawback is that your messages will end up residing on that machine's hard
disk.

And I would add a fourth point:

4.  File transfers are simpler across a PPP connection, allowing you to
download direct to your Amiga using a native FTP client.  With a shell
account, you would have two transfers to deal with, for example, FTP to the

Subject: Amigas at Disney

Jason,

As a former member of a long since departed Amiga dealer in Orlando, I can
add to your story about the Indiana Jones Amigas.  The Amiga 2000 is also
used at the MGM theme park here in Orlando to control fireworks displays. 
We repaired the machine used there and sold them a backup unit back in the
1989 time-frame.

Another prominent user of the Amiga in Orlando is the Orlando Arena and the
Orlando Magic Shak-less NBA team.  Back in the Magics 2nd year in the
league, I (along with two staff members), used 2 Amigas (an A2500 and a
Toaster equipped A2000 (with a GVP 33MHz '030 board) to produce the
graphics on the Arena JumboTron.  We did six or seven games before
convincing the city and the team to purchase machines for the video
production room at the Arena.  These machines are still in use today.

Last year I formed a new company (Intrepid Communications, Inc.) which
sells Computer Telephony solutions to business, business phone systems, an
inhouse line of Pentium machines, UMAX SuperMac MacOS machines and
hopefully, if the situation improves, new generation Amigas.

We are in the process of becoming NewTek resellers (for all platforms) and
are already SoftLogik dealers.

Best wishes in your new relationship with VisCorp and kudos for producing
Amiga Report so well for so long.  We have every issue stored on our A4000
here in our office.

BTW: we will soon have our new WebSite up on line.  (URL:

            VIScorp: Problems Identified and Solutions Offered
  Stephen Judd                                    judd@merle.acns.nwu.edu
===========================================================================

[Originally from comp.sys.amiga.misc.  Enjoy. -Jason]

Recent months have revealed a clear and unmistakable disconnect (or one
perceived thereof modulo extenuating circumstances tansverse to hegemonic
dialectic) between VIScorp and the Amiga community at large.  With this
text I hope to instigate a soporific discourse upon the current state of
the Amiga dystopia, in the specific context of the internet community, and
examine the invocations, both cause and effect, which characterize the
abundance of banal vicissitudes permeating this newsgroup.

First.

VIScorp has constructed a device apparently named "ED".  This name most
certainly must change, as it contains the capacity to cause consternation
encompassing the Amiga community -- is this product really a set-top box,
or merely an editor?  Will the editor continue to be a part of Amiga OS?  I
believe this signifies VIScorp's desire to convert the AmigaOS to a pure
set-top box.  For many like myself "ed" has come to symbolize AmigaOS, and
this choice of name as the settop box conveys an unmistakably ominous note.

To avoid this sort of confusion the company should immediately change the
name to something more appropriate, such as "ED-209", or "EDLIN".

Further is the referral to their box -- which is, after all, an Amiga -- as
just that, a box.  Not only does this indicate a detrimental attitude
towards the Amiga, but the word itself contains much more ominousity, a
lot:


1box \'ba^:ks\ n,  pl box or box-es
[ME, fr. OE, fr. L buxus, fr. Gk pyxos]
(bef. 12c)
     esp: a widely cultivated shrub (B sempervirens) used for
     hedges, borders, and topiary figures 
     ^^^^^^

Hedging their bets?  PIOS explained?  Or do they mean to simply use the
computers as gardening tools, or perhaps larn ornaments?


2box n
[ME, fr. OE, fr. LL buxis, fr. Gk pyxis, fr. pyxos box tree]
(bef. 12c)
1d: the driver's seat on a carriage or coach
1e slang: GUITAR
1f slang: RECORD PLAYER

A-ha!  Perhaps the company really intends to use the Amiga technology to
make record players!


6: a square or oblong hollow space or recess

"Hollow", not a good attitude to have.  "Recess", as if we were simple
schoolchildren who needed something to play with.


10: PREDICAMENT, FIX

Not good at all. :(  But, most revealing of all:

4box n
[ME]
(14c)
:a punch or slap esp. on the ear 

Truly, not a very good looking state of affairs.

Secondly.

To understand the dichotomy between VIScorp and the Amiga community we need
to take a closer look at the two words which comprise the name itself:
"VI", and "Scorp".

VI -- merely the number 6, one-third of the evil triad?  Probably, but
equally probable is the unmistakable reference to the holy UNIX editor.
Why does VIScorp have such a fixation with text editors?  Is this how they
view the Amiga?  Is this all they know how to do back there?  Does this
mean that VI is to replace ED in AmigaOS?  Do they intend to edit AmigaOS?
If so, how?  By adding more of a UNIX kernal?  Or do they intend to simply
use the machine for UNIX work, and drop AmigaOS altogether?  Once they have
dropped AmigaOS, what then?  Are current programs really supposed to be
compatible with UNIX?  Why is the company so obsessed with UNIX?

Or is the Freudian play on words the key signifier here?  What has VIScorp
to do with Eunuchs?  Is this really the image a serious company wants to
project?  To imply that millions of workstations and users are somehow
Eunuchs because they do not use AmigaOS, while correct, is certainly not
appropriate business practice.  Eunuchs have not been used in the business
community, to the best of my knowledge, for many many years.   And in no
way could Eunuchs have been associated with Amigas, either -- after all,
electricity had not been invented yet back then, right?  Does VIScorp
really have such a complete lack of basic fact and logic and common sense
and basic fact?

The second word is "Scorp".  What does this word mean?  It is a mystery,
and that's why so is VIScorp.


VIScorp is clearly a business, and as such is primarily motivated in making
a profit, in expanding itself, in facing constraints placed upon it by
outside influences, and working within time and budgetary limitations. 
They have survived for a while and are thus wholly controlled by this sort
of existentence-based business thinking.

We, on the other hand, are the Users, whose very lives may depend on the
actions VIScorp takes.  We are not constrained by similar paltry
considerations, and may concern ourselves with more weighty and visionary
tasks.  As users, we necessarily know what VIScorp should do with the
Amiga, and what technologies should be implemented, and what direction the
computer should be moving.  While a company must focus on producing and
selling computers, and continuing its existence as a company, we are the
ones who can look forwards and focus on using them: on Needs.  Whereas a
designer may get bogged down with design details, such is not a problem for
us.  We develop the "Should-Be" which follows from the "As-Is".

Moreover, VIScorp clearly owes us something, as longtime Amiga users.  We
should be rewarded and listened to, and our ideas and designs implemented,
for we have had much longer to think about the truly important issues.
They should keep us informed at all times about their plans and progress,
so that we may follow, and correct when necessary.  We have paid our dues
and the company would do well to remember that since we don't work for
them, it is they who work for us.

Finally, as the internet Amiga community, we speak for the uneducated,
unenlightened members of the Amiga community who are not present.  These
ideas have stood up to the close scrutiny of everyone else in the internet
community, have been pronounced correct, and are thus inherently correct --
an incorrect idea or assumption simply cannot last in such an environment.
That is the reason for the great uniformity of opinion expressed.

===========================================================================
               What The Amiga Needs To Survive In Australia
  John Pospisil                                   pospisil@ozemail.com.au
===========================================================================

The current Australian Amiga distributor can't be serious -- not about
selling computers anyway.

Why, might you ask, do I say this?

Recently, I wrote a book, "How to buy a computer", in which I included a
short section about the Amiga.  In a market dominated by Wintel, and to a
lesser extent Macintosh, I thought this was a nice little gesture for my
personal favourite computer, the Amiga.  An initial conversation with the
distributor was positive -- the sales manager said he would be happy to
supply a picture of an Amiga 1200 for the book.

Unfortunately, when it came time to send me the picture, the sales manager
didn't return my calls.  I did eventually manage to get a picture of a
1200, thanks to Storm Front Studios, which was then still publishing the
Australian Amiga Review.

I haven't seen any Amiga advertising, nor have I seen any evidence of PR
activity on behalf the Australian distributor.  I have heard that an Amiga
advertisement did appear in the Age.

"The Australian" newspaper does very occasionally publish Amiga articles,
but they seem to be sourced from the US.  Two recent examples were the
Eagle attempt at buying Amiga Technologies and the Viscorp announcement of
the ED.

Another project I have been involved in is the development and launch of a
new computer magazine for a well-known Australian consumer organisation.
It's designed for people who don't go for all the hype that tends to appear
in most other computer magazines.  In the first issue we did a story about
cheap computers for under $2000.  Is the Amiga mentioned?  No!  As editor
of the magazine, I don't think it is appropriate to report on a product
that is all but invisible in Australia (as much I would like to).

So the Amiga completely out of the race?

In my opinion, there is a huge market for a sub $1000 computer.  Even
computers that costs $2000 (expect to pay $3000 to $4000 for a brand-name
PC in Australia) are still beyond the means of many working people (C and
Ds the marketing people call them).  Get a $900 computer that connects you
to the Internet into a store like Harvey Norman (a very popular superstore
here in Australia) and you'll sell thosuands of the bloody things.

My two-bits worth

For all it's worth, here's my advice to anyone who's remotely serious
aabout selling Amigas in Australia.

1.  Get the price right.  An Amiga 1200, V34 modem and software bundle
should cost AUS$899.  It has to cost less than a $1000, the physchological
price point for many people.  As long as it does the basics, such as
connect to the Internet, word process, run spreadsheets, most people won't
care what the hell is under the cover.  As long as it feels and looks like
a 'real' computer, most people will be satisfied.  If it's impossible to
get the machines out at this price, than someone along the line has stuffed
up big time.  Even with smallish production runs, how expensive can it be
to make a 68020-based computer with 2 MB RAM?


2.  Abandon the discredited strategy of selling only through small dealers.
The truth may be that no big distributors want to take the Amiga again, but
**IT IS** important to try to get Amiga into the larger stores.  Market
share does count.

3.  Get someone to do PR -- do it inhouse for Christ's sake, if you can't
afford a PR agency.  At least let the media know you exist, and that you're
selling a worthwhile product.  Returning their calls is a start.

4.  And while you're at it, develop some point of sale strategies.  Talk to
an advertising company about small, but interesting, display ads in the
computer sections of the metro dailies.

5.  Support any of the user groups that have managed to survive.  Feed them
information, give them prizes to raffle off, etc


All these things may seem very obvious -- but they're things the current
distributor seems to totally ignore.

As for me, I work everyday with the latest and greatest PCs and Macs.  And
yet somehow I still find my Amiga more interesting and fun to use than even
the fatest PCs.  I know it's probably irrational, but I kinda think it's
got something to do with my Amiga having a little character.

Oh, and here's the obligatory disclaimer.  These opinions are my own, and
do not represent the opinions of my employer.  If anyone wants to drop me a

@toc NEWS

               Electrics (V1.1) Digital Designer
               ---------------------------------

Electrics is a group of programs for designing and simulating digital
electronic circuits on the Amiga computer.  The circuit to be tested
is drawn using simple and complex gates.  Multiple logic levels and
drive strengths permit realistic circuit behavior during simulation.

SCHEMATIC PROGRAM:
  A circuit design is drawn using Wire, Label, Text, and Symbol
  objects.  Symbol objects are obtained from a library of simple
  gates (NAND, XOR, etc.) and complex TTL gates (74193, 74245, etc.).
  The circuit design may contain one sheet, or span up to 99 sheets.

SIMULATOR PROGRAM:
  The circuit design is simulated by applying signal levels, and
  evaluating the results.  The sequence of signal levels to apply is
  described in an ARexx script.  Signal levels may be '0' (low),
  '1' (high), 'X' (unknown), or 'Z' (floating).  The activity of the
  signals may be observed by connecting various viewing programs to
  the Simulator.  Original signals may be renamed, used to create new
  ones, or grouped to create signal Buses.

VIEWER PROGRAM:
  The Viewer may be connected to the Simulator in order to record
  signal activity during simulation.  This activity is displayed as a
  trace waveform of both Single and Bus signals.  Over 4 billion time
  units may be recorded for over 64000 signals.

DIGITS PROGRAM:
  The Digits program is a multi-digit 7-segment display that may be
  connected to the Simulator to observe signal activity.  Each digit
  has seven segments, a colon, and a decimal point.  Individual common
  lines allow the digits to emulate common-Anode and common-Cathode
  displays.

AREXX SHELL:
  The ARexx Shell provides a command-line shell for interactive
  simulation and signal probing, or for general-purpose ARexx
  operations.

PROJECT MANAGER:
  The Project Manager creates and organizes design project directories.

Electrics comes with illustrated AmigaGuide instructions, and requires
Workbench 2.0 or greater.  Electrics may be purchased by sending a
postal order for US$30 + US$2 (P&S) to:

@toc NEWS

*** WORMS - THE DIRECTOR'S CUT ***

* LATEST STUFF - 2/9/96

The new version of Amiga Worms, for AGA machines only, will be released in
September/October - a price has yet to be decided on, but there will be an
upgrade offer for owners of the original version.

The aim of this version was to give the Amiga the best possible version of
WORMS 1.  Thanks again to everyone on #Amiga+#Worms+csa.games who's
suggested stuff for it ... 

Here's an (almost) complete list of the extra stuff in it ...


* THE TECHY STUFF ...

Over 300 colours on screen
Super-smooth quarter-pixel scrolling
9 level parallax (including two layers of mountains)
24-bit fades + explosion flashes


* MAD COWS, HOMING PIGEONS, OLD WOMEN ...

A few of these things are still being put it in (last-minute-panic-type
situation) ...  but I should get them all in there ...

> 15+ (count 'em) new weapons

New standard weapons ...

Grenade Launcher
Hand Gun
Petrol Bomb
(Sheep has been promoted to a standard weapon as well)

New special weapons ...

Homing Pigeon
Mad Cows
Holy Hand Grenade
Baseball Bat
Super Sheep
Sheep-on-a-Rope
Sheep Strike
Old Woman

... and the rest =)

> Graffiti Mode 

Lets you paint your own level in the landscape generator - like drawing
freehand in a paint package ...  Worms then turns it into whatever
landscape type you want (Forest/Arctic...) and places objects/bridges on
it.

> DIY Landscapes

Using a template you can create your own types of level (like Mars/Hell...)
You can also set the gravity/friction/sky-colour/water-colour, and which
set of mountains it uses.

> Mountain Sets

You can create your own mountains (both back+front) in a paint package and
then turn them into a mountain set which can be used by Worms for
standard+custom levels.  Both back+front mountains can use their own 16
colours.

> 2-layer levels

Levels can now have background scenery which you can walk infront of.  On
standard levels this means that tunnels+small explosions are not
see-through.  On custom levels you can now have a whole second picture as
the background scenery.

> Cavern Levels

1-in-4 levels are now caverns (this option can be turned off though)

> Weapon Damage Settings

The amount of damage each weapon does (and therefore the size of the crater
it makes) can be changed.  This lets you have weapons like Banana Bomb
enabled + have a game that lasts longer than a minute =)

> Air Moves

Certain moves can now be done in the air.  Worms also have a straight-up
jump and backflip.  This allows you to jump up and kamikaze, or backflip
off a cliff and Ninja Rope the underneath of it.  Ninja Rope can also be
done repeatedly, tarzan-style - very useful in cavern levels - and dynamite
can be dropped when you're swinging.

> Improved Team Entry

Worms now handles unlimited number of teams - they are just stored in a
TWTEAM drawer.  The number of games played/won, cpu setting etc.  are also
stored - so even if a team is hardly ever used, it's stats will still be
remembered, and the team will still be selectable at Game Start.  As a lot
of people like to have more than 4 worms on the go, and the WormList was a
bit confusing for selecting them, you can now have A+B Teams under the same
name.

> Improved sample-sets

Samples are now loaded into fast-ram if you have it - letting you have a
different sample-set for each team.  Worms also handles unlimited amount of
sample-sets, and uses a default set if any sound fx are missing - you don't
need to include standard fx, such as the bazooka, in your set if you don't
want to change them.

> Personalized samples

Each worm can have a specific sample for when they go byebye.  So Jessica
Fletcher can now go down in a blaze of glory to the Murder She Wrote theme
tune ...

> WormCam

The equivilant of "action-tracking" on the PC/PSX version - the screen will
scroll to follow moving worms/mines etc.  You can also go and look at the
position of each worm by pressing "*" on the keypad.  WormCam can be
toggled on/off with the "/" key on the keypad.

> The "very exciting" crate menu

Which items appear in weapon-crates, and how often they appear, can be
adjusted.

> Donor cards

If you would like to help some worm to live after your death you can get
your team to carry a donor card - when the last worm on your team dies, all
your unused weapons are left in a crate ...

> WormPrefs

The game can be configured from a WormPrefs program for Workbench.  This
lets you edit the gravity/friction etc.  of custom+standard levels, create
2-layer level/DIY/mountain files, assign samples to individual worms ...

> Small changes ...

Air Strikes are now directable, Homing Missiles can go
off-screen+underwater, you can swing off-screen when on the rope, pressure
or proximity mines, continue on same level option, medi-kits, wind on/off,
maximum of 250 energy for worms, options can now be saved ...


* CUSTOM LEVELS, BUT MORE SO

If the thought of drawing levels in just 8 colours made you shout at people
you didn't even know, this will calm you down.  You can now use 16 (!) -
the colour restrictions are the same as before ...

colour 0    - transparent
colour 1    - white-ish
colour 2    - pink-ish (204,136,136/12,8,8)
colour 3    - anything (t-shirt colour)
colour 4    - lighter version of 3
colour 5-15 - anything

Levels can be in AGA colours.  8-colour levels can still be loaded, but if
your making an AGA level make sure you put .WRM16 on the end of it so you
don't make the original Worms explode trying to load it.

Also, you can now have background scenery which your worm can walk infront
of.  To do this draw two pictures, both 960x350 in 16 colours and using the
same palette.  The first picture will be the foreground, all the stuff you
can stand on and shoot, and the second will be the background.  In the game
the two pictures are combined on screen, like the first being overlaid on
the second, and as the foreground is blown up, the background is revealed.
WormPrefs will eat both pictures to create a single custom level file.

This means you can produce levels like the inside of a house, with the back
wall drawn as background and the walls + stairs drawn as foreground.  This
will allow your worm to walk into the house and climb up the stairs (cor!).


* THE DIRECTOR'S PATCH

Because of the time the AGA version has taken up, I haven't been able to
get the patch done for the original Worms.  This patch will fix the
infamous cd.device bug, and add some extra stuff to the game.  As soon as
I've got the AGA version out the way, I'll get it finished.  Sorry =(


* NEVER USE CHEAP 70s CONCRETE

And yes, a certain "garden ornament" will probably be making an
appearance...

Keep on worming ...

                     HAAGE & PARTNER NEWS SEPTEMBER, 1996

   PROFESSIONAL C(++) DEVELOPMENT TOOLS FOR THE FUTURE OF THE AMIGA

StormC 1.1 STARTER

   16 Sept. 96 - HAAGE & PARTNER Computer announces new STARTER version
   of StormC 1.1. This version is especially for students and novices to
   ANSI C and C++ at a SRP of US$ 169. This package offers all the
   advantages that make StormC the best choice for programming the Amiga:
   integrated development system, visual project manager, fast source
   editor with syntax coloring, very fast ANSI C and C++ compiler,
   optimizing linker and the outstanding run-time system.

   StormC STARTER makes programming the Amiga easier and more effective.
   All of its components are designed for ease-of-use. StormC is a
   two-in-one compiler system that offers both current C standards: the
   well known ANSI C and the modern C++ standard (according to AT&T 3.0)
   for object oriented programming (OOP).

New Version 1.1 of StormC

   We also released version 1.1 of our new StormC development system in
   August. It has got a lot of new features and enhancements and it is
   the first international version. The program is localized in English,
   Italian, French and German and the manual is available in English,
   German and soon in French too. The international demo of new version
   1.1 is available on our home page and on AmiNet (biz/demo).

Coming Soon: International Version of StormWIZARD

   One of the most time-consuming parts of programming is creating a
   Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the program. For that we offer an
   easy-to-use graphical GUI editor, called StormWIZARD. Using this
   editor will save a lot of programming time and get you a nice and
   OS-compliant GUI. StormWIZARD will be available in English by the end
   of September at US$ 69. The latest demo is available on our home page
   and on AmiNet (biz/demo).

Future Plans

   We are also working on a special version of StormC for the upcoming
   PowerPC boards for Amiga from Phase 5. Development is getting along
   well and we intent to show you a pre-version at COMPUTER 96 in Cologne
   (November 15 to 17). At this show there will also be a demonstration
   of the new OS from German company proDAD, called p-OS and we will
   present a special version of StormC for p-OS development too.

   For all these reasons StormC is the development system for the future
   of the Amiga. StormC supports development for current AmigaOS and the
   next generation PowerPC Amiga and p-OS systems.

  _________________________________________________________________

                      URGENT - PLEASE READ THIS!

After five highly succesful years on Portal, The Amiga Zone on Portal
will close on Sept. 30th, 1996 and we're moving to CalWeb Internet
Services in October, 1996.

Portal has decided to drop all of their internet services after a ten
year run, and switch to being a different kind of company. We had to
find the Zone a new home, and CalWeb will be it!

The Amiga Zone will be rebuilt on CalWeb with a different look, but
with the same philosophy we've always had: the Amiga is the best
computer, and its owners are the best people, and it deserves the best
online support possible.

It'll take a while to rebuild the Zone on CalWeb. We hope to have her
up and ready sometime in October.

If you're currently a Portal customer, PLEASE move with us to CalWeb.
We've arranged for a free signup for you. Just call 1-800-509-9322 or
1-916-641-9320 and say "The Amiga Zone Sent me!" The same deal goes
for any of you who want to join the Zone but weren't Portal customers.

Watch this space for more news. The Amiga Zone was reborn once before
and we'll be doing it again! Stay tuned..

  _________________________________________________________________

                                CONTESTS!

The Amiga Zone, in its ten year history, has given away more prizes
than any other Amiga-related SIG, Forum, roundtable, spaceship, clan,
club, cabal, group, or commune on any online service anywhere in the
galaxy.

Thanks to the generosity of Bob Luneski of Oregon Research we're
currently giving out their brand new product Termite TCP in our Amiga
Zone online Sunday Night Chat Contests. One Termite TCP will be given
away each Sunday night until they're gone. After that, we have even
more kewl Amiga prizes to give out. (If you are an Amiga
product-making company and wish to donate prizes to the Amiga Zone and
get your company and product name splattered all over this page..
please contact us and let us know!)

To participate in the Amiga Zone's contests you must be a Portal
subscriber (or after Sept. 30, 1996, a CalWeb customer) as the
contests take place in our nightly, live Amiga Zone chats, and you
must be present to participate and win.

1. First, the bad news. 

Apology: We have tried really hard to make Capital Punishment appear in

bit. 

Since we are perfectionists, everything (including boxes, manuals etc.) has
to be exactly the way we wanted it.  That takes time, so we had two
options:

- Compromise, or
- Be late with the game

We don't like compromises, period.

Seriously, though, we hope you understand this.  Capital Punishment is a
superb game so it also requires every other aspect to be of the same
quality.  We are late, it's true, but, believe us, once you have the game
you will have forgotten it was late.

So, it should be out somewhere around the end of the month.  But, this
time, we will inform you of the exact date only when we are 100% sure of
it.  :)

We apologize one more time.

* Due to the fact above, we are extending the preordering period.  For more
information, please visit our web site.


2. And, now the GOOD news. 

We predicted a long time ago that Capital Punishment would become one of
the best Amiga games of all time. 

Now, after Amiga magazines reviewed Capital Punishment we can very proudly
tell you that we were right. 

Here's a brief report on the upcoming reviews:

- Capital Punishment is now officially the highest rated game of 1996!  
All the major magazines reviewed it, and they were stunned by its quality.


- Capital Punishment is now generally considered to be among the top ten
games of all time!

- All the magazines awarded Capital Punishment more than 90%!

- Here are some of the quotes:

"A game like this is unbelievable.  One of the best games of all time." -
Amiga Computing (third highest rated game ever).

"There's only one word for the graphics in Capital Punishment - superb!" -
Amiga Format

"The best Amiga beat-em-up ever!" - Amiga Games

"Capital Punishment scores a clean technical Knock Out!  It's almost
incredible what this game makes out of an ordinary Amiga." - Amiga Joker
(the highest rating ever)

"Capital Punishment is one of the finest games on Amiga" - Amiga Action

"Frame rate is higher than any fighting game I've seen" - CU Amiga

- We are also proud to say that due to its quality Capital Punishment will
be on the covers of three major Amiga games magazines' (Amiga Games and
Amiga Joker in Germany, and Amiga Action in UK).

Thank you for your attention.  We will inform you of the exact Capital
Punishment release date as soon as we are 100% sure of it.

@node FEATURE1 "Miami vs TermiteTCP"
@toc FEATURE

===========================================================================
                            Miami vs TermiteTCP
  Ron Mascaro                                           rcmasca@clark.net
===========================================================================

Connecting an Amiga to the Internet has, until recently, been a somewhat
difficult task, due to the difficulties of installing and configuring a
TCP/IP stack, the software that allows the Amiga to communicate with other
computers via the common language (protocol) of the Internet.  The only
available TCP/IP stacks for the Amiga, were AmiTCP and AS225, or Inet225,
as it is known in its commercial incarnation.  AmiTCP is somewhat difficult
to set up, even for a net Guru.  For the beginner, it is a nightmare.
There is no GUI.  To change any of the configuration settings, you had to
run the install script over again.  Additionally AmiTCP did not directly
support dial-up connections.  You either had to dial the provider from a
terminal program, set the modem to stay on-line, release the serial port
and then run AmiTCP, or you had to install one of the shareware GUI
front-ends to do this for you.  In all fairness, the latest commercial
version of AmiTCP is supposed to have a rudimentary dialer, but I haven't
had the opportunity to use it.  I've never had the opportunity to try out
AS225 or Inet225, so I don't know how difficult they are to use.

Added to the installation difficulties is the fact that AmiTCP and AS225
use different Application Programming Interfaces (API), the language that
the Client programs, such as FTP, use to communicate with the TCP/IP stack.
Clients written for AmiTCP would not work with AS255 and vice-versa.  In
the past year or so, libraries have been available to allow Clients to work
with either stack transparently.  Still, the Amiga desperately needed a
TCP/IP stack that was simple to use.

All that has changed with the recent introduction of two new TCP/IP stacks
for the Amiga, Miami, and TermiteTCP.  Miami is a shareware program that
currently is only available from the authors WWW and FTP sites.  TermiteTCP
is a commercial program published by Oregon Research.  Both of these
programs were designed specifically for dial-up connections, with ease of
use a primary consideration.  The focus of this review is to compare these
two programs.

First off, let me say that Miami and TermiteTCP are not suitable for direct
LAN connections.  Neither has any support for Amiga ethernet cards.  Both
programs are limited to dial-up connections only, although Holger Kruze,
the author of Miami has hinted that he may produce a Miami Professional
version if there is enough interest.  However both programs have settings
for use with a null-modem cable to connect two Amigas directly via the
serial ports.

The Interface: Miami uses the MUI GUI system.  Termite uses the standard
Amiga GUI.  MUI is highly user configurable, but window redraws are a
somewhat slower, especially on high color AGA screens.  If you are using a
4 or 8 color screen, or a Graphics card, you will get much better
performance.  Both programs use the GUI exclusively for all configuration
and connections operations.  There are no text files to edit.

Installation: Both Miami and TermiteTCP were easy to install.  Termite uses
a standard Commodore Install script to install the program.  During the
install process, you are asked to type in the serial number which then
serialises both the install disk and the hard drive installation.  Miami
has no install script.  You simply download the archive, and expand it to
any location.  There are no paths or assigns to set, so you can freely move
the program around wherever is convenient, so long as all the files remain
in the same directory.  As Miami is a shareware program some features are
disabled.  By registering, you will receive a key file to enable the
additional features.  However the disabled features do not in anyway
diminish the basic functionality of the program.

Configuration: Miami really shines here.  Total time to dearchive, install,
configure, and connect to my ISP was an astonishingly low 10 minutes, I
didn't even crack open the manual.  The Readmefirst file was enough to get
going, because Miami completely walks you through the procedure.  It comes
with a companion program called MiamiInit, that Asks for some basic
information such as serial device and phone number, and modem settings.
Miami includes a list of preconfigured modem settings for a number of
popular modems, so you generally won't have to fumble with you modem's
manual to answer these questions.  It then asks whether you are configuring
for SLIP, PPP, TIA or Slirp, you IP address, (if you are issued a static
address), your login and password, and then it dials your provider.  A
window will pop up in which records your login actions.  there are buttons
to send your login and password, and then you can manually navigate through
any additional login menus until your SLIP/PPP connection is established. 
Then, if you are configuring for PPP, Miami will negotiate an optimum
connection.  It will also attempt a DNS lookup to find the available DNS
servers on your network.  This may or may not be successful, depending on
whether your provider supports DNS lookup, but if it fails you will just
have to type in the DNS IPs that your provider has given to you.  It will
then verify the validity of those servers, and hang up, storing a complete
configuration.  After that you simply run the main Miami program and import
the configuration.  Then away you go.  It's that easy.  The script recorder
works flawlessly, provided you don't make any typos/backspaces in the
process.  The main program allows you to edit the script if necessary.
I've used script recorders on various terminal programs before, and
generally you have to tweak them to get them to work properly, even if you
typed correctly.  This is because the script tries to send commands before
they are prompted, or waits to long.  Modifying the wait commands usually
fixes the problem.  I had no such problems with Miami, however.  My script
worked flawlessly first time, every time.

TermiteTCP was also fairly easy to configure.  Configuration is
accomplished in the main program., however, you need to know all the
information in advance, and set the configuration before attempting a
connection.  The only exception is the login script.  It also has a script
recorder, and it worked flawlessly once I figured out how it worked I had
to look in the manual to figure out how to start and stop recording and
save to disk.  Not terribly difficult, but not immediately obvious either
(Miami starts and stops the recorder automatically).  Total elapsed time
was about 25 minutes.

Miami has many more configuration options than TermiteTCP, especially for
PPP.  You can tweak the configuration for better performance or use the
defaults (There is no PPP configuration settings in TermiteTCP, so you are
stuck with the internal settings).  TermiteTCP is limited to the standard
Modem settings, and provider information.  There is only provision for one
phone number.  DNS servers are limited to 2 entries, and there is no
setting for MTU.  Miami gives you many different options for TCP/IP/PPP
settings.  TermiteTCP does not support SLIP/CSLIP protocalls.  You must
have a PPP connection to use it.  Miami supports SLIP/CSLIP/PPP
connections.  I haven't tested TermiteTCP with TIA yet.  TermiteTCP does
not claim to work with TIA or Slirp.  It may not work since it doesn't have
a "Fake IP" option.

Other Options: Miami has an internal database similar to AmiTCP for
services, users, etc, which allows you to configure server daemons and
allow for remote users on you system.  The database is configured within
the GUI, unlike AmiTCP where you have to load a text file into an editor to
add or change entries.  There is no database of any kind in TermiteTCP, so
I doubt it is possible to add any services or allow other users to login to
your computer.  I don't know how you could set TermiteTCP up for Amiphone,
for instance.  There is no mention of this capability in the documentation.
Miami also has a unique automatic activity generator which will send out a
ping packet periodically at a user configurable interval.  This is useful
if you have a provider that disconnects after a period of inactivity.  This
will keep you from being disconnected should you exceed the limit, while
reading a document on-line, for example.

Clients: Miami comes with no client software.  TermiteTCP comes with FTP
and Telnet clients but they are very rudimentary.  The shareware AmFTP is
MUCH better, and is worth the registration Fee.  The Termite Telnet client
is OK, but it would not log in to my shell account using a preset login and
password configuration.  It would only work if I logged in manually.  Other
than that it seemed to work OK.  There are several freeware/shareware
Telnet clients available on Aminet.  I wouldn't choose TermiteTCP over
Miami based on the inclusion of these clients.

API: Miami is compatible with the AmiTCP API.  Termite uses it's own API,
but also includes compatablity with the AmiTCP API.  Both programs will
work with AmiTCP clients.  TermiteTCP includes a Software Development Kit
for programmers who wish to write clients specifically for the Termite API.
One drawback to TermiteTCP's custom API is that the included clients are
written for this API, so they will not run with any other TCP/IP stack.  It
is unknown to me, whether Miami or TermiteTCP will work with AS225 clients.
The API is not supported directly, but they may work with the addition of
the socket.library found on Aminet.  There are, however, few clients
written specifically for AS225 that do not also support the AmiTCP API.

Speed: TermiteTCP is marginally faster at dialing and connecting, due to
the fact that Miami has to deal with the overhead of MUI windowing
operations.  But once on line, speed is not a factor.

Both Miami, and TermiteTCP claim to have a quick auto-reconnect feature,
that allows you to skip dial-in and negotiation after a system crash, if
you have set the modem to stay on-line.  Only Miami's seems to work,
however.  The TermiteTCP manual mentions it, but doesn't give any specifics
on how to get it to work.  The default config hangs up the modem on a loss
of DTR signal, but after changing it so the modem would stay on-line,
TermiteTCP apparently still insisted on trying to redial and/or renegotiate
PPP.  It's possible my provider does not allow renegotiation of PPP.
Either way, Miami's reconnect feature that allows bypassing both dialing
and renegotiation works with my provider.

Documentation: TermiteTCP comes with a thick printed manual, but 2/3 of
this is devoted to a Guide to the internet for new users.  Only 18 pages
are devoted to the program's operation, with another 22 devoted to the FTP
and Telnet clients.  Miami's Amigaguide manual is far more descriptive.

On-line Help: Miami provides on-line help in the form of MUI "Balloon
Help".  If you place the mouse cursor on any gadget, and leave it there for
a few seconds, a bubble will pop up telling you what the gadget does.
Additionally, pressing the "Help" key loads the Amigaguide manual to a
context-sensitive section of the document.  TermiteTCP has no on-line help.

Price Comparison: Miami - $35, TermiteTCP - $69.95 (Oregon Research
currently has a direct mail-order promotional price of $59.95)

Unregistered Disabled Features: TermiteTCP, N/A.  Miami's disabled features
minimally affect the programs functionality.  Connection Time is limited to
1 hour sessions.  At 1 hour Miami will spontaneously disconnect.  A 30
minute warning is provided.  Auto-online after passive offline is disabled.
Arexx scripts are disabled.  There is a limit of three phone numbers.
Phone Logging is disabled.  Some MUI GUI customization options are
disabled.

Registration: Since TermiteTCP is a commercial program, registration is
simply a matter of returning a completed registration card.  Miami uses an
on-line 3-step registration process.  The first step is to order a license
code.  You do this from the main program which asks for your Name, address,
etc, and your e-mail address.  You can send in the request on-line or via
slow mail.  To send it in on-line you must have a "First Virtual" payment
account established.  This account allows you to puchase merchandise online
without revealing your Credit Card Number in your E-mail.  For slow-mail
you can use check, money order or cash.  Once the author or other
registration site receives your License request and payment, he will e-mail
you a license code.  This code is necessary to run the second step which is
the actual registration, this step automatically sends an encrypted
registration request, and in a few minutes another encrypted registration
code will be returned.  With this file you will run the third step that
creates a pair of keys from the encrypted e-mail.  These keys enable the
additional features.  The registration process sounds more complicated than
it actually is.  If for some reason the automatic registration fails, you
can send the request directly to the author's e-mail address and he will
process it manually.  It took 3 days from the time I sent my check via
slow-mail, until the author sent me the license code.  The second two steps
took just a few minutes.  This is by far the fastest response I have ever
had registering a shareware product.

Conclusion: Let me just say that Miami beats TermiteTCP hands down.  It's
easier to use, has many more options, and is considerably cheaper.  It is
by far the best TCP stack around for dial-up connections.  I think that $35
for Miami and $25 for AmFTP is a much better deal than $59.95 for
TermiteTCP.  It's amazing what a nickel will buy you these days.  Yes, it
does require MUI, which will cost an additional $35 to register, but you
will need MUI anyway as most of the Internet Client software require it.  
Miami is truly the most amazing piece of Amiga software I have seen in a
very long time.

Where To Get Them: TermiteTCP is now available directly from Oregon
Research and will most likely be available through most Amiga Retailers.

                            AMOS With The CD32
  C. Edward Stewart                                    joehick@golden.net
===========================================================================

Whether or not you happen to have a CD32, you may have access to a CD32
joypad.  With it, you have the option of programming a lot more neat
options (because it has a lot of buttons).  There have been several
different programs out there to read the CD32 joypad, but they all lack in
one way or another.  Here's my procedure that does it:

Procedure PAD
CD=0 : CD32=0
Lib Open 1,"lowlevel.library",40
Dreg(0)=1
CD=Lib Call(1,-30)
Lib Close 1
If CD and 1 Then CD32=CD32+%1
If CD and 2 Then CD32=CD32+%10
If CD and 4 Then CD32=CD32+%100
If CD and 8 Then CD32=CD32+%1000
If CD and 131072 Then CD32=CD32+%10000
If CD and 262144 Then CD32=CD32+%100000
If CD and 524288 Then CD32=CD32+%1000000
If CD and 1048576 Then CD32=CD32+%10000000
If CD and 2097152 Then CD32=CD32+%100000000
If CD and 4194304 Then CD32=CD32+%1000000000
If CD and 8388608 Then CD32=CD32+%10000000000
End Proc[CD32]

To use this procedure, you'll need to get the lowlevel.library (and a CD32
joypad) if you don't have it.  Now, the procedure is nice, but without the
code to use it, it's just so many cool AMOS commands.

Loop

This loop checks all the buttons and acts on them.  If you want different
buttons to be sensed sooner, move them up on the list.  I've got all the
different buttons labeled as procedures, but you could use Goto's or
commands just as easily.  The code above just shows you what values
represent which buttons.

Most CD32s don't have keyboards attached, so don't put places in your
program for users to type unless you use some sort of CD32 joypad procedure
to get the characters.  Say something like the one below.

Procedure CD32_TEXT
CHAR$="" : CHAR=0 : A$="" : IN$="" : PAD=0
CHAR$="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ,.!?() 1234567890"
CHAR=1
Curs Off
CD32:
If CHAR<1 Then CHAR=69
If CHAR>69 Then CHAR=1
A$=Mid$(CHAR$,CHAR,1)
Locate 0,0 : Print IN$;A$;" ";Cleft$;Cleft$;
CD32A:
Do : PAD=0 : PAD : PAD=Param : If PAD=0 Then Loop
If PAD and 4 Then CHAR=CHAR-1 : Wait 5 : Goto CD32
If PAD and 8 Then CHAR=CHAR+1 : Wait 5 : Goto CD32
If PAD and 128
  IN$=IN$+A$
  Locate 0,0
  Print IN$
  Goto CD32B
End If
If PAD and 512 Then IN$=Left$(IN$,Len(IN$)-1) : Wait 15 : Goto CD32
If PAD and 1024 Then IN$=IN$+A$ : Wait 10 : Goto CD32
Goto CD32A
CD32B:
End Proc[IN$]

To use the text procedure use the following code:

CD32_TEXT : IN$=Param$

CD32 joypad up and down scroll through the letters.  Blue advances a
character.  Red deletes a character.  Green terminates input.  The
parameter in IN$ will contain the text entered by the user.

With these procedures, you can write AMOS programs that can be included on
CD32 coverdisk CDs.  Also, you can have access to all those neat buttons on
the CD32 joypad.

You may be wondering why anyone would want to use a CD32 joypad.  For one
simple reason: More commands at your fingertips!  So go get a CD32 joypad
and start writing cool multi-button programs.

                 Arcade Classics Plus from Epic Marketing
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Arcade Classics Plus, the CD from Epic Marketing, focuses largely on clones
and remakes (some faithful, some only remotely so) of legendary, classic
arcade games: the likes of Asteroids, Defender, Pong, etc.  There's even a
section for slightly more "modern" classics like Pendo and Lode Runner.

Like the Epic Collection, there is a custom GUI interface.  This one is
significantly more attractive to use and easy to navigate.  Unlike the Epic
Collection, not everything is DMS compressed, which is a welcome change.
Many of the files have documentation, which comes up in a scrollable window
when you select the file you want more information on...however, not all of
them do, so there's still some degree of guessing and testing to be done.
The interface lets you uncompress the archives to the directory (or disk,
for DMS) of your choice, and they can be run (by you) from there.

As classics collections go, I haven't seen a better one yet.  In all
honesty, the quality of many Amiga recreations of classic games is not the
greatest, so this is obviously reflected in what you get.  (I have yet to
see a decent light cycles game, and am at a loss to understand why nobody
in the world has ever done a clone of the original Tron 4-event arcade
game.) There are games that are without compare, however, and a special
section for Jeff Minter's own brand of classics, which to many would be
worth the price of admission in and of itself.  And for those not so
interested in pure classics, there's a collection of Assassins games disks.

Quite a lot of the games here are of the "Crash_Immediately_On_AGA()"
variety.  You have been warned...best not to uncompress to RAM: if you
value what you're working on currently.

Maybe it's the interface, or the theme, or the DMS, but I didn't find
myself quite as gleefully immersed in games with this disc as I did with
Games Galore.  It's still a more-than-decent collection if you find
browsing through Aminet's game directory a harrowing task at best.  I know
I do.

===========================================================================

Didn't I just get done talking about how great it was that Golden Games had
most everything unarchived?  Yep, I did.

Epic Marketing has been in the Amiga software and CD-ROM business for quite
some time and has a considerable array of Amiga and PC CD-ROMs.  The Epic
Collection represents a large portion of their PD disk collection.

The Epic Collection is a catchall CD, roughly akin to the AGA Experience
CDs put out by Sadeness/NFA (although without the same AGA-only slant).
For those ready to dive right in, there is a text file with filenames and
descriptions (some more informative than others) for each of the 1000+ DMS
archives on the CD.  For those looking to comfortably navigate, there is a
custom GUI which takes you through each category of archives and lists
descriptions where appropriate.  The custom interface almost, but not
quite, worked under CyberGraphX.

The quality of the archives isn't the problem (although some of the items
are pretty questionable...you'd think someone would have figured out that
SoftAGA isn't a real program and that "VT220", while an "emulator", isn't
an emulator in the same way Frodo is).  The DMS archiving is the problem.
CD-ROMs are one of the fastest ways to move large quantities of data from a
publisher to a customer.  Why insist on forcing a slow de-archive to
floppy?  I would have accepted LHA or LZX archives without question, as the
CD is rather full and likely would have been exceeded in capacity without
some sort of archiving.  But DMS should be a "only when necessary" archival
form, not something you use because you happen to have a lot of disks with
good material lying around.  I also located a bit of silliness on a disk
whose DMS archive included an LHA of the contents of the disk being
unarchived!  Using the original LHA would have saved 400k on the
CD-ROM...not to mention a lot of time.

As a general collection, there's nothing really wrong with The Epic
Collection.  There will be something for everyone--games, Reko cardsets,
sound files, emulators, and more.  If you don't go crazy by the time you're
done un-DMSing disks, that is.

         Review: Amiga CD-Sensation: Golden Games from Schatztruhe
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

...apparently, Gamer's Delight 1 and 2 wasn't enough.

Golden Games, the new CD from Stefan Ossowski's Schatztruhe, is the second
I've seen in their new "psuedo-magazine" packaging.  (The first was the
"Demos are Forever" CD.)  No jewel box, just an A4-sized cardboard "cover"
and information in English and German on the back about the CD.

The information pretty much tells you the obvious--there are a lot of games
on here.  Specifically, there are a lot of freely redistributable games and
demos, as well as the requisite group of degrading tools to make them all
work, and an extensive selection of hints.

Unlike Gamer's Delight 2, there is no custom GUI interface, only the
Workbench.  A set of icons will configure your system to the recommended
color and screenmode for browsing, and another click will set up various
assigns needed to allow the games to execute directly from CD.  The games
are divided into 12 major categories by type, with DMS'ed archives in their
own separate hierarchy.  (The majority, by far, of goodies on the CD are
unarchived and ready to go.)

The selection, like anything of this kind, is going to be largely hit and
miss, but overall I was fairly pleased.  I found a few more "instant
classics" and there are a number of my personal favorites on the CD.  I was
impressed with how much I could painlessly run off of the CD, although
programs that expect to save their prefs file to progdir: are always in for
a shock, which means a lot of clicking "cancel" for the user.  (Unless
you're smarter than I am and are running an assign-requester patch, in
which case it will be less of a nuisance.)

One of the things which caught me off guard was the lack of English
documentation for the CD other than the introduction on the back of the
packaging...the rest is German only.  It's nice to be able to read about
the compilation and any last-minute changes we might need to be aware of.
You can use the German guide to navigate (easily) to the master index of
games with documentation and click directly on the individual docs for each
game.

The categorization on the CD is overall a plus but I think a bit more
notice should be given for those items which are just game demos (lest
anybody get really excited when they see "Worms" and "Skidmarks 2" (both of
which appear in the "Great Action" section).

If I may digress for a minute, I've been having trouble sitting down with
the Amiga and having a genuinely good time lately...it's not a problem with
the Amiga, but with me, as all the work I've done on Amigas lately have
made me associate them with just that--work.  However, Golden Games has
given me a number of incentives to start treating the Amiga less as a "work
tool" and more like a computer that I genuinely enjoy using.  So, for that,
I am grateful.  If you're having a similar problem, it's going to be worth
the small fee to pick up a copy of this CD for yourself.

          Review: Timekeepers Expansion Disk from Vulcan Software
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Well, I guess it wasn't feasible to expand Hillsea Lido (although that's a
shame, because with a few enhancements it could easily be one of my
favorite games), so Vulcan wound up expanding Timekeepers. :)

Seriously.  Timekeepers, Vulcan's entry into the world of puzzle-solving
little guys made famous by Lemmings, is a neat game.  I'm not huge into
solving puzzles with little tools, but games like Lemmings and Timekeepers
are enough to distract me for a good length of time.

Vulcan went so far as to give Timekeepers a plot.  They must not have liked
the deus ex machina Lemmings falling from the mystical trapdoor in the sky.
The mission is to send these little Timekeepers into human history to
prevent evil people from detonating nuclear weapons that would seriously
disrupt the development of the Earth.  These Timekeepers are special
forces, the trip into the past is one way, and you are the only one who can
make the mission work by getting them past, over, and through obstacles.

Neat game.  Not being very good at puzzle games I didn't make it very far,
either, and now Vulcan wants to subject me to more.  Fine, then.  There is
now even more challenge awaiting your Timekeeper dollar, for those people
who are either hopelessly stuck somewhere and need something fresh, or
those dedicated guardians who completed the original and are hungry for
more.

In keeping with Vulcan's "the best packaging is small packaging" principle,
Timekeepers comes in a small folding container just big enough for a floppy
disk and a small set of instructions which tells you, basically, that the
Timekeepers expansion disk should be inserted when you're prompted for Disk
2, rather than the usual Timekeepers Disk 2 you'd otherwise be using.  For
hard drive users, this just means you drag across this disk's drawer
instead of the original Disk 2 drawer, and if you're clever you'll just
rename the original for later reference.  It's a shame there's nothing to
automatically handle this, but Vulcan's confidence in us is high that we'll
figure it out for ourselves.

For the US$10 or so that Vulcan is charging, I'm hard pressed not to
recommend this to Timekeepers fans worldwide.  Perhaps Vulcan might be
persuaded to release their level builder someday?  Good response to the
expansion disk could help.

Vulcan is a UK-based Amiga game publisher who sells their games through
direct mail order.  You can also find them on the Web.

===========================================================================
               Review: The Final Gate - CD32 from Bigg Wolf
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

The story behind Final Gate's release is one I'd like to hear more often.
The first part happens too much, the second, too little.

Alternative Software developed Final Gate, made a game out of it, and went
so far as to burn CDs.  But it was never released.

Bigg Wolf of the US stepped in, bought up the CDs and released the game.
Which is nice to see...too often, I'm hearing of projects developed for the
Amiga but never released (and the evidence of them is pretty staggering,
considering that Ocean and Microprose had this habit of advertising them
for months but deciding that taking the product to market would result in
a loss above their development costs.)  So in this case, Final Gate gets to
see the light of day after all.

The game boasts of offering FMV gameplay without an FMV cartridge.  This
should already be setting off the CDXL alarms in your head.  (CDXL, for
those unfamiliar with the CD32 and CDTV, is Commodore's format for
quarter-screenish 30fps animation, which can come from a video source or
other animation, such as the rendered Pirates' Gold intro.)  In fact, the
game is very reminiscent of other attempts at "FMV" gaming on standard
Amiga setups.  The two that leap to mind are Tomcat and Desert Apache from
Dark Unicorn Productions, a shareware team.

The plot of Final Gate, so far as I can make out, is this: you're a guy
with a machine gun hanging out on a speedboat with a buddy of yours.
Suddenly (much like a cat jumping up and running to another room for no
good reason) you realize you have to be somewhere else, shooting at things.
So your buddy starts up the boat and you're off, with a quarter-screen view
of the scenery whizzing by as the boat drives on.  You'll quickly notice
lots of garishly colored missiles and projectiles coming at you, which you
need to move your crosshair (with a gamepad) in order to shoot.  Let them
hit you, and you lose health points.  From time to time, you'll have the
opportunity to shoot an FMV person (so distinguished by the white aiming
guides you see near him.)  Take him out, and you get a special point and
FMV bonus.  Miss him, and he shoots you, taking away a lot of your precious
health.  Final Gate suffers from "power-up-itis", so there are some special
flying objects you can shoot which will benefit you.

If you've followed me this far, you've got a good feel for Final Gate.  The
camera work is passable but nothing that will win cinematographic awards.
The gameplay, well, it's a lot like Tomcat and Apache, where you take your
sprite and shoot at other sprites against a FMV backdrop.  I have to admit
that I wish the developers had made the CDXL full-screen, despite the
blockiness that introduces, because that enhancement made Apache far
superior to Tomcat.

By my reckoning, Final Gate is a pretty middle-of-the-road CD32 game.  I
can easily rattle off a host of other CD32 titles I enjoyed a lot less, but
it's certainly no Pirates' Gold (crashes and all), Liberation, or
Microcosm.  Note that Microcosm is itself a CDXL "shoot your bright sprite
at other bright sprites" game, but it's all a question of implementation
and mood, and Final Gate doesn't quite suck you in the way Microcosm does.

Bigg Wolf certainly seems to realize that Final Gate isn't the end-all
be-all of gaming...the exceptionally limited documentation (all of two
sides of a jewel box insert) is amusingly tongue-in-cheek.

Final Gate was developed for the CD32, but is actually playable to a point
on a stock A4000T without any software help--you'll find that it crashes
after you die, however.

I've gotten a hold of the Kang-Fu playable demo disc...

Now that I've had a chance to sit down and thumb through both.  I don't
have the full version of Kang Fu, so I'm not comfortable giving a total
review, but from what I've seen I'd like to jot down a few notes.

How's "Looks like it should sit next to Zool in the 'incredible-looking
platformer' category" for a comment?  It does.

Oh, plot's never very important in Kang Fu, but basically, you're a
kangaroo who runs around collecting small kangaroos, hurling punches and
boomerangs and eggs at brightly colored evil things (like umbrellas and
Amiga Boing balls), collecting keys to open locks, that sort of thing.

The animation is exceptional on the 4000T test system.  The game supports
CD32 gamepads and runs without additional software support on Amiga AGA CD
setups.

I'm looking forward to finding out more of Kang Fu's status.

===========================================================================
              Review: SX32 CD32 enhancement hardware from DCE
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON
===========================================================================

In the beginning, there was the CD32.  The CD32 is perhaps the saddest
story of all of the Amiga models which have sad stories.  (Basically, all
of them.)

Unlike most of its counterparts, the CD32 was blessed with a good price
point (US$400), early penetration into a new marketplace (only the CD-i,
CDTV and Sega CD had established any sort of presence in console CD gaming,
and only the Sega CD was what you might consider successful), and a
competitive price/performance ratio (While the 3DO, released at about the
same time, looked superior in a number of ways, it was US$300 more at the
time.)  And the 3DO wasn't even readily available in the big European Amiga
markets.  Even the television campaign was decent!  And the early releases
of games looked pretty good.

But, no.  Commodore didn't have any trouble selling the machines.  The
problem was that their credit was so bad that they couldn't build enough
CD32s.  Psygnosis, claiming that Commodore owed them money for assisting
in the CD32's design, was less than enthusiastic about continued support.
Support and market momentum lagged, and what CD32s were around wound up
being stockpiled as the 3DO started to come down in price with better
games.

As Amigas go, the CD32 was a low-end AGA machine, comparable in features to
an A1200.  But the expansion options were far fewer.  Aside from video
output, the only link to the outside world for the CD32 was a special AUX
port, designed to hold a keyboard but also capable of serial communication.
Devices like the Communicator sprung up to allow rudimentary networking
between a CD32 and Amiga.

But there was more.  There is a rear edge connector designed for the rare
Commodore FMV card, which was used by developers to support a special
communication board that gave a CD32 a full set of I/O ports.  MicroBotics
set to work on a similar device to offer commercially.  They were bought by
Paravision, which released the SX-1, a big gunmetal grey attachment that
ups the CD32 footprint by 50%, gives you a lot of I/O ports and IDE
connections, and is precariously connected by a special card that will let
you plug in a FMV cartridge at the same time, if you're so lucky.

People wanted more.  DCE's SX32 is a good alternative to the blocky SX-1
and the other kid on the block, the ProModule.  The SX32 and ProModule are
seeing new versions released, but this review deals with the original SX32.

The SX32 is a total rethink of the SX-1 concept.  Instead of retaining FMV
passthrough (not very popular of a demand) and adding an external box, the
SX32 only adds a new rear panel to the CD32, which sports 5 connectors.
The IDE hard drive, as it does on the SX-1, mounts directly to the SX32
mainboard.

The SX32 mainboard sits inside of the CD32, and its installation requires
the opening of the CD32 case.  Rather upsetting is that you have to remove
a groundstrap to make the SX32 fit.  It's even more upsetting for me,
because we have to give the SX32 back, meaning we've got this CD32 which is
missing an original piece...

Once you have the board laid properly in the CD32 case, you have to line up
the external panel which holds the five I/O ports.  This is actually a bit
tougher than I anticipated, but can be done.  The board is designed to hold
in place fairly securely.  Once done, you hold the whole assembly together
with a large screw (of the sort used to hold on the old expansion port
cover).

The 5 new ports on your CD32 are as follows:

25-pin Parallel port: functionally indistinguishable from an Amiga or SX-1
parallel port.  Use your CD32 for Parnet or printing.

25-pin Serial port: functionally indistinguishable from an Amiga serial
port, and superior to my mind than the SX-1's serial port, which is 9-pin.
25-pin has been the Amiga standard, and I imagine we all have 25-pin serial
cables by now.

Amiga Floppy connector: functionally indistinguishable from an Amiga or
SX-1 external floppy connector.  Allows you to boot from floppy or use
floppies in conjunction with CD32 games (like Liberation) or from
Workbench.

RGB Video connector: To my eye, functionally indistinguishable from an
Amiga or SX-1 external RGB connector.  Designed to plug into a 1084-style
monitor.

15-pin VGA Video Connector: Not a scan-doubler, but it duplicates the
function of the 23-to-15 pin RGB-to-VGA conversion devices (affectionately
called "The Silver Box" at Amiga Report.)  Allows you to plug a true
multisync monitor directly into the CD32 for games, or to use a VGA monitor
under VGA/DBL modes in Workbench.

In addition, you get the internal 2.5 inch IDE header, and a single SIMM
slot which will accept up to 8 megabytes.  (Tested successfully with 4 and
1.)  Fast memory is a boon for the acceleration of the CD32, but
unfortunately it is not always compatible with CD32 games.

Documentation is exceedingly scarce.  My Eyetech-provided SX32 came only
with installation instructions, not operating instructions.  There is an
Eyetech-provided HD setup disk, which will install AmigaOS 3.0 from the
included CDPD CD-ROM and assist a novice in setting up a hard drive.

What's good about the SX32?  Well, on its own merits, it offers just about
everything a CD32 user needs to make their machine a full-blown Amiga.  A
new model promises FPU capability as well as the memory expansion.
Compared to the SX-1, the installation is extremely sound.  The ports are
all in the same place, as opposed to the SX-1's 3-sided approach.  And
nothing should obstruct the original CD32 hardware, unlike the SX-1 which
when coupled with a silver box made the power plug a tight fit.  (Besides,
the VGA adapter replaces the need for the silver box.)

What's bad?  Well, as a general complaint, Commodore gave 030 boards to its
developers, and I'm surprised nobody has followed suit yet.  (Paravision
and Hi-Tech claimed they would release enhanced SX-1s with 030s, but that
hasn't happened.)  Installation was a bit more down and dirty than I would
have liked...I don't personally mind opening my Amigas, but the CD32 is a
pretty rare piece of hardware and I don't know how many people want to poke
around in them.  And the SX32 is missing two SX-1 features which were
exceptionally useful: a PC-keyboard port and a memory-disable switch.
While the AUX port is still available for A4000 keyboards (or A2000/3000
keyboards with the included adapter), those keyboards are significantly
more expensive than your garden variety PC keyboard.  As for the memory
disable, since there's no good way to get at the memory in the SX32 without
opening your machine, if you want it disabled you'll have to rely on a
Degrader-type program.  The SX-1 switch was a great benefit at times.

Overall, the SX32 is a very good expander for the CD32.  It offers a lot
that the SX-1 didn't, or didn't implement as well...but not everything.  If
you've got a spare Amiga keyboard, the SX32 is the clear choice.  If not,
you may want to think twice about your overall cost.

===========================================================================
              Review: Apollo 1240/40 Accelerator Card Part 2
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON
===========================================================================

Recently, we took a look at the Apollo 1240/40 card.  Now it's time to take
a look at the numbers.

We ran three benchmark routines as well as the AIBB comparison suite.  The
benchmarks were run with FastExec installed, which moves exec.library to
RAM and gives a significant performance increase to the Apollo card.

The first test was a raytrace render of the Staircase example from
Cinema4D.  It was rendered in 320x400 resolution on the following machines:

An Amiga Tech A4000T with 14 megs of memory and a standard 3640 040/25 card
A Macrosystem Draco with 32 megs of memory and the Draco 060/50 card
An A1200 with 10 megs of memory and the Falcon 040/25 card
An A1200 with 10 megs of memory and the CyberStorm 060/50 card
An A1200 with 10 megs of memory and the Apollo 040/40 card

The time breakdown is as follows (in minutes:seconds)

Cyberstorm-- 1:26
Apollo--     2:31
Draco--      5:05
Falcon--     5:05
4000T--      6:01

The Cyberstorm wins the test, as well it should as it is an 060 card.
Furthermore, the Cyberstorm was running CyberPatcher, which enhances the
FPU performance of a select number of programs (of which Cinema4D is one).
The Apollo clocks in with performance far better than that of an 040/25
machine (either the Falcon or the 4000T).  It is worth noticing that the
Draco under Cinema4D is exactly as fast as the Falcon.  We ran this test a
number of times with the same result.  The answer seems to lie with
CyberPatcher saving the day for the Cyberstorm.  Draco users do not have a
similar recourse.

The Apollo, in this application, offers a great deal more performance than
anything else in its price class.

Moving along to the ImageFX tests, we ran two effects on the included
"guy.jpg" picture.  The first was the Sobel Edge Detect algorithm, run on
the 4000T, the Apollo, and the CyberStorm.  The time breakdown here, in
seconds.hundredths of seconds:

Cyberstorm-- 2.87
Apollo--     6.63
A4000T--     10.68

Here, the Apollo is working a great deal faster than the stock 040/25
A4000T but is not on the same pace as the 060/50 Cyberstorm.

The final test was run using the Crystallize effect with default settings.
Time breakdowns:

Cyberstorm-- 3.36
Apollo--     6.46
4000T--      10.73

As we saw in the first test, under this particular situation the Apollo
performs at better than 50% of the 060 speed.  (ImageFX, incidentally, is
not currently supported by the version of Cyberpatcher we used)  It is also
nearly twice as fast as the 4000T.

By these standards, then, the Apollo is a significantly speedy card.  The
AIBB benchmarks offer additional insight as well.

By and large, of course, in the comparison between the Cyberstorm 1260, the
Apollo, the Falcon, and a 4000T, the Cyberstorm rules the day.  But in most
tests, the Apollo outperforms its 040 cousins (the Falcon and 4000T) by at
least 20% and sometimes over 100%.  The MemTest, in particular, is won by
the Apollo, with the 4000T's poor memory system rating only 22% of the
Apollo's score.  Some graphically-oriented tests are fastest on the Apollo
as well, notably the WritePixel and EllipseTest.  But overall, the
CyberStorm 060 outscores the Apollo on most intense-mathematics tests,
usually at a level of 50-125%, with the 040/25 machines far behind.

There are a couple of concerns with the Apollo.  One is the lack of disable
option for pesky software that is not 040-friendly.  The other is the fact
that towards the end of our tests here at AR, the Apollo fan failed, making
it difficult to complete our tests.  This may of course just be an isolated
case.

The Apollo is retailing for well under US$500 these days, which in
comparison to other 040 options (the overpriced Falcon), slower 030 options
(which can reach over $300), and the high-end 060 choices (at least
US$800), is a good performance/price choice.  If you're looking for a
serious (but not end-all be-all) speed increase and are opposed to the
concept of spending more than you bought your 1200 for just to speed it up,
the Apollo is worth a serious look.

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to majordomo@amigalib.com

Your subject header will be ignored.  In the body of the message, enter

The system will automatically pull your e-mail address from the message
header.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact

                          UUDecoding Amiga Report
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

                      Amiga Report Writing Guidelines
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

     4.  Please send us your article in ASCII format.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.

Please stipulate as well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to

===========================================================================

AMIGA ZONE MOVES TO CALWEB!

THE AMIGA ZONE MOVES FROM PORTAL TO CALWEB INTERNET SERVICES

For over ten years the Amiga Zone has been an online resource, home,
community, oasis, for Amiga owners.

For over ten years I've made my living running the Zone and supporting Amiga
users all over the USA, Canada, and the world.

Five years ago when American People/Link pulled their own plug, we had to
find the Zone a new home and we found a good one on the Portal Online
System. 

Well, it's happened again.. Portal has informed all of its customers that
its ten year history as an online service and Internet provider is coming to
an end on Sept. 30, 1996.  This is very sad, it's short-notice, and the
decision is completely out of my control, but it's also irreversible.  

Portal is changing its entire business plan from being an ISP to selling an
accounting system to other online services.  

So be it. It's sad, but like I said, the Zone went through this before and
now we'll go through it again, and come out the other side better and wiser.

THE AMIGA ZONE IS MOVING TO CALWEB INTERNET SERVICES.

CalWeb (http://www.calweb.com) is a two year old Internet provider located
in Sacramento, CA.  It has a good sized customer base, and very
knowledgeable support staff. 

It's also run by a long time Amiga owner who has been a friend of mine for
many years.

The world of modeming has changed much in the last ten years.  In 1985 you
had very few choices and you had 1200 baud.  These days, everyone and his
dog has an ISP running and a web page

But the vast majority of those providers don't know an Amiga from a hole in
the ground, and could care less about Amiga owners.  Say "AWeb" or
"IBrowse" to them and they'll say "Omega?  Amoeba?  What?  Huh?  They still
make those things?"

CalWeb is different because it's the new home of the Amiga Zone.

In October 1996, a new custom front-end menued system will be added to
CalWeb to host the Zone.  It'll have features for Zone users that neither
Plink nor Portal ever had nor were they willing to add.

The tradition of a friendly online Amiga community, run by long time Amiga
owners, users and lovers will continue. 

Message bases, huge file libraries (we plan to move over the 20,000+ files
we have on the Zone on Portal to CalWeb, MANY of which you'll never see on
Aminet or anywhere else), live nightly chats, vendor support and our famous
prize contests will continue.

We've given away tens of thousands of dollars worth of Amiga prizes in the
last ten years.  No one else even comes close. 

I urge any and all of you who were on Plink, or who are now on Portal or
who may have left Portal..  or even if you were never on either but used or
still use another online service to join CalWeb for the Amiga Zone.  I
personally promise you the best online Amiga community we can possibly
build.  You will not be disappointed.


CalWeb has arranged a special signup offer for you!

Call:
 1-800-509-9322
  or
 1-916-641-9320
  or telnet to calweb.com, login as "guest", and follow the prompts. 

You can join CalWeb for US$19.95 flat, a month.

CalWeb takes major credit cards or you can establish a monthly invoiced
account if you don't have plastic.

The signup is FREE.

To get this deal you must say "THE AMIGA ZONE SENT ME" when you call or
signup online. 

I hope to see lots of you join CalWeb.  You can telnet into it from
anywhere for no hourly charges at all.  Your $19.95/mo fee covers
everything and also gets you ten meg of storage which includes hosting your
own personal web page.  Naturally, when the Zone opens there, you'll have
unlimited use of all of its features and areas.  Never a "money meter"
clock to worry about.

Your personal or business CalWeb Web pages are maintained by you via FTP. 
It's pretty slick.  You can make a net connection to the server with any
Amiga FTP client, put your files onto it, the permissions are automatically
set (no "chmod-ing" required!) and flip to your running browser and see the
changes instantly.

The Amiga Zone's new home is already up at:

         http://www.amigazone.com

running on CalWeb's server.  Ckeck it out!

Please feel free to write to me at harv@amigazone.com or harv@cup.portal.com
if you want more information.

Remember to say "THE AMIGA ZONE SENT ME!" when you join.

A splendid time is guaranteed for all.  

Please plan to join us in the Amiga Zone on CalWeb!
