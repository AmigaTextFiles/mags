Well this is the last issue of Amiga Report. I must say that it has
been real enjoyable, but ...it time to go.

JUST KIDDING!!!!

We're here to stay! 

Well as many of you know, Commodore has been having serious financial
difficulties. I don't know what that means for us, but I'm quite sure
we're not seeing the end of CBM. I've tried to get ahold of CBM...
to no avail. Looks like they aren't answering the phone today.
We'll keep trying, and hopefully get you some more information by next 
week.

There's been many rumors. One interesting rumor is the one floating
around about Hewlitt Packard doing some sort of take-over, or possibly
just helping CBM out. OK, this is just a rumor, and there are many
more floating around out there.

...Maybe it's some fancy April Fools joke??

Oh well, on with the show...

Amiga Report - COMMODORE AT RISK OF FINANCIAL COLLAPSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Commodore International Ltd, has announced that they are currently having
financial difficulties which may result in bankruptcy or other 
liquidation procedures unless sufficient additional funding is found.

The Wall Street Journal reports (3-28-94) that for the second quarter
Commodore has lost $8.2 million, or 25 cents a share. Revenue fell to
$70.1 million from 237.7 million. Commodore stock fell 12.5 cents
to $3.00 in NYSE trading. Stocks closed thursday at .75 per share.

Associated Press reports that, "The company's net worth turned negative
during the fiscal year that ended last June 30 and it has since had two
more quarters of losses."

Suppliers have limited credit to Commodore and some have filed suit. 
Commodore is now trying to negotiate a restructuring plan with creditors,
including those that have sued the company. There has been no reports as 
to the nature of the suits.

The New York Stock Exchange has halted trading of Commodore stock, and
stock will remain halted while NYSE reviews Commodore's eligibility
for continued listing. Hock Tan of Commodore told Reuters that he didn't 
know when CBM would be able to resume trading.

AR wasn't able to reach anyone at Commodore today for questions.

AMIGA TALK - A low cost Amiga network
  
-Back in 1989 a small German company showed a networking system for the
Amiga on the "Amiga Messe" in Frankfurt. The beauty of the network was 
the fact that it works via the diskdrive port. No loss of essential ports
(like PARnet and SERnet) and no need for expensive cards. The Amiga Talk 
network created a device being the harddisk of another machine. Now that 
there's finally a little network support for the Amiga (NetWork 
FilingSystem and Superbase LAN) the time was right to buy Amiga Talk.
  
Although it is pretty cheap (Hfl 450,- (about $ 200)) the package surely
lacks some essential things. The worst is the fact that everything is in
German. The Dutch dealer included a translated manual, but still are
technical details (needed to make applications that make full use of the
net) are in German. All software is in German as well. So when the network
crashed or reported some error I had no idea whatsoever what was wrong.
  
INSTALLING
  
Installing the hardware is as easy as could get. Plug the network adapters
in the last disk drive in the chain; that's it. Plug a terminator on the
first and last machine in the network and the hardware is ready to go.
  
Installing the software isn't that easy. Manufacturer Adonis doesn't use
the standard Commodore installer. Instead they have their own system,
regrettably in German. So there's nothing else to do but follow the
instructions from the translated manual blindly.
  
First one has to name the server. I named my server "office". One has to
specify which devices can be accessed by the clients. For some reason RAM:
and DF0: aren't recommended but the manual nor the software explains why.
Next the names for all clients have to be entered. Now all clients need to
be installed. The installer sees which clients can be appointed and with a
simple click of the mouse a client name can be selected for the current
machine.
  
To use the network the server has to run "StartServer" before the other
machines have access. The "StartServer" command does not display a window
or anything annoying. Without any clients "StartServer" doesn't complain
either so it doesn't harm to put it in the S:Startup-Sequence. For a 
client to access the network the command "NetMount" has to be run. If a 
client has a similar device to the server (e.g. DH0:) one can "mount as".
For example "NetMount Office/DH0: as SH0:", now the harddisk of the server
will be known as SH0: on the client.
  
USING THE NETWORK
 
It's slow. It is very slow. It's just a little faster than the diskdrive.
Of course the harddisks on the network don't have slow heads to move but
seek time and transferring rate are very disappointing. This is surely 
not a network for heavy file transferring. However to transfer single 
records for a distributed database system it will perfectly do.
  
Here are the figures:

If the server has a ".backdrop" file in the root, it will be copied to all
clients. With my server having "PageStream", "DirectoryOpus", "Term", 
"Ami-Back" and a Shell as outplaced icons, they all appear on the clients
as well. Running them from a client works as well. Keep in mind that calls
to logical drives like L:, Libs: or Devs: are still aimed at the client 
itself. So in order to run the programs the necessary files have to be on
each client or the paths have to be assigned to the server as well.
  
PRINTER SPOOLER
  
The Adonis software also offers a way of printer spooling. All output to
the standard printer device (PRT:) should be re-routed to a file using the
standard CMD-command. A printer-spooling program then sends all printer
files to a special directory on the server. The server checks for new 
files in this directory and prints them.
  
This all works all right. However if one has a printer on the client (for
example a matrix printer) and the server has a laserprinter, one chooses
once in a while. A draft copy can be printed locally, the final result
should be printed on the laserjet. Creating two printer devices isn't 
easy. The "CMD.info" can only contain "DEVICE=parallel" or 
"DEVICE=serial". So, by appointing the server-printer to be "serial" by 
the client it can be done. Creating a special printer device (SPT:?) would
have been a better solution from Adonis.
  
The printer spooler on the server opens a window which cannot be closed.
The person working on the server always has one extra window in the
WorkBench.
  
DETAILS
  
To maintain the network some extra utilities have been supplied. Again 
most of their output is in German so they ain't that useful after all. The
programs allow to check the network and reinstall (new server, new 
devices, other machine names).
  
As the network hardware plugs into the diskdrive ports using drive patches
like CrossDOS could cause trouble. Intense activity on the network slows
the speed of the diskdrives on the current Amigas down.
  
AmigaTalk v1.1d has been tested using 3 Amigas. All running KickStart 2.0,
all having a personal printer and a network printer. Two machines have a
modem, one internal and one external.
  
 server:
  Amiga 500
   Supra ByteSync 105M harddisk
  
 clients:
  Amiga 2000
   GVP 40M harddisk
  Amiga 2500
   Supra WordSync 52M harddisk
  
CONCLUSION
  
I'd recommend AmigaTalk for those who transfer small files. Companies who
make magazines can send texts and pictures to the server. Companies can
send records for a database to the server or lookup something. Using Amiga-
Talk in a file-server situation, where all users run software from a
central machine wouldn't be a good idea.
  
The network never crippled a file and never crashed. If the server crashes
for some reason all clients will go along. For some reason I hardly ever
have GURUs or software failures and therefore I only know this from the
manual.
  
Nice try. If Adonis translates the German texts to English and polishes 
the software here and there it could be a very interesting product. Even 
after all these years between introduction and buying it the software 
seems out dated. Some work still needs to be done.

   Not a peer-to-peer network. So the clients can access the harddisks of
   the server. The server cannot access the client harddisks.
 o slow
   Not a good idea for running programs over the network. Perfectly 
   suitable for small files like database records, messages, mail or 
   pictures.
 o all in German
   Isn't English the standard computer language?
  
 positive:
 o affordable
   Compared to prices in other countries $ 230 (USD) might be a lot for a
   network but compared to prices here in Holland it is very cheap.
 o transperant
   The network acts as a device. Easy to use easy to install other packages
   to work with the system
 o printer spooler
   
Not perfect, but it's there and it works.

        Creating Custom Gadgets with Directory Opus by David Tiberio


        One of the best features of a program such as Directory Opus is
    that it can be used to control other software. For example, mine
    controls my music module player, software compression, email, and
    much more. Although the authors would like for you to believe that
    it is easy to configure, this simply is not true! In many cases
    external files were necessary, although newer versions have fixed
    those problems (I will use my older scripts for the sake of those
    who are using the older version or other software).


    -- EdPlayer --

        One of my favorite uses is to control my music player. I use
    EdPlayer by Ed Mackey to play my modules. Although Ed does have a
    usable interface, I rarely ever see it since DirOpus does all the
    work. My EdPlayer control panel contains the following options:
    OPEN, MENU, PLAY, STOP, NEXT, PREVIOUS, EJECT, and KILL. In the past
    I have also used volume control functions but apparantly they were
    deleted and not used as often.
        To load a music module, I merely select the file or a group and
    then press the OPEN command from DirOpus. This executs a script that
    loads the desired file. My DirOpus config contains the line:

        OPEN:   AmigaDOS    c:telled.s {f}

        With the following options:

            CD source
            Do all files
            Run Asynchrously

        My c:telled.s file is an AmigaDOS script that looks like this:

key infile/a

run c:edplayer -h
c:telled DCOL 4
c:telled PALM
c:telled AUTO 3
c:telled JUKE <infile>
c:telled NEXT           ;use this line for the module to play immediately

        To play a song, I used the command: AmigaDOS c:telled NEXT

        Likewise, I also use other EdPlayer commands. The NEXT option
    above may be replaced with STOP, HIDE, KILL, EJEC, PREV, or nothing
    to load the EdPlayer screen. Now I can play and control EdPlayer from
    DirOpus. The advantage is that it is much faster and easier to select
    the songs I want to hear.


    -- XPK --

        I also frequently use XPK for realtime file compression and
    decompression of files on my hard drive. For this I used to have
    every supported XPK method, but now have only two selected, NUKE
    and SQUASH (for audio samples and music modules). I also access
    the XPK decompressor and the compression identifier program. These
    allow my to select various file with DirOpus and select only one
    gadget to actually perform the compression. Here are the commands
    I use in the DirOpus configuration screen:

        XPACK:      AmigaDOS    c:xpack {f}{sr} method nuke
        XSQUASH:    AmigaDOS    c:xpack {f}{sr} method squash
        XUNPACK:    AmigaDOS    c:xup {f}{sr}
        XDIR:       AmigaDOS    c:xdir {f}

        With the following options:

            CD source
            Do all files
            Output window


    -- LHA --

        Using LHA, I can compress files in various ways. By merely
    selecting the files I wish to compress with DirOpus, clicking the
    right gadget will either compress to a default name, add files to
    an archive, move files to an archive, and more. Also, if the archive
    already exists, new files may be added without destroying the old
    archive.

        For example, a basic LHA addfiles command looks like this:

        LHA ADD:    AmigaDOS c:lha -2x a "{sr}{aArchive Name}"{O}.lha
        LHA MOVE:   AmigaDOS c:lha -2x m "{sr}{aArchive Name}"{O}.lha
        LHA EXT:    AmigaDOS c:lha -x x {f}
        LHA LIST:   AmigaDOS c:lha v {f}
        LHA TEST:   AmigaDOS c:lha t {f}

        With the following options:

            CD source
            Do all files
            Output window
            Recursive directories
            Rescan source           (not needed for ADD, LIST, and TEST)


    -- MultiView --

        MultiView is a great little program incorporated into Workbench
    3.0. This will display pictures, hear sounds, read text and hypertext,
    and hopefully play music modules also in the future. The great part
    is that using "loaders" called datatypes it can access various types
    of file formats, unlike other picture viewers (but keep your favorite
    viewer, such as viewtek, as a spare).

        SHOW:   AmigaDOS sys:utilities/multiview SCREEN {f}

        Or if you have a large 256 color Workbench or greater, try using:

        SHOW:   AmigaDOS sys:utilities/multiview WINDOW {f}

        With the following options:

            CD source
            Do all files

        My backup viewer is viewtek, which handles GIF and JPEG much better
    than the current MultiView datatypes do. This command looks like this:

        VIEWTEK:    AmigaDOS c:vt {f}

        With the following options:

            CD source
            Do all files





        In closing, you will find DirOpus can perform many tasks. When I
    used to run my Internet site, I could send email and binary files to
    people simply by clicking on the files and entering their email
    addresses. I could also post files ot newsgroups or send files to
    FTP mail servers. Then my machine would be able to send and receive
    all the files while I ate lunch, went to class, or slept.

        Good luck using your file manager programs in the future, and look
    for my new shareware file manager which will be coming soon. The layout
    is designed to increase performance once you become accustomed to the
    new design, as well as increased configurability. Unlike some programs
    which insist that configuring the appearance of the program is most
    important, you will come to find that getting work done is much more
    important. But my interface looks better than theirs anyway! :)

From:	NES@delphi.com
Subject: Re:  New colums

I used to get a magazine which had a lot of little programs sent in by 
users. This used to get alot of reader participation.  The programs would
not be limited to a topic.  One issue the program maybe a utility next 
issue a game. Since we don't want to make the AR file to large for 
downloading. I was thinking to have the readers send in programs that they
have writen. The only limit to the programs would be they have to be under
20K arc'ed, or 10K if you think that 20K will add to much size to AR.  The
programs would be arc'ed in with AR.  And there would be a discription of
the program inside AR.

EXAMPLE:

This issues program is "CRLF"
Writen by Eric Stringer [NES@DELPHI.COM]
Programed in E.

CRLF is a utility program to remove the Carrage return or Line feed from a
text file.  

USEAGE:  From cli type "CRLF inputfile  outputfile -options"
         options are one of the following: -LF = remove line feed, -CR =
         remove carrage return.

You will find the file as "CRLF.LHA" inside the AR arcive.

Rules?

  Yep there are a few rules.  Of course the program or programs must
be under 20K arc'd (Lha please).  Please include with your program a short
discription with your name, mail or INTERNET address and the language you
used (Programing language that is).  Also include instructions.  

[ ED - How about it?? If you're interested in this send mail to either ]
[ myself or to NES@DELPHI.COM, and let us know what you think!         ]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

        I brought up the idea to Rob Niles that we could hold a monthly
    contest to Amiga Report readers, and he agreed. After discussing it
    briefly, I was asked to create some sort of entry contest method
    that people could enter with. After much thought, I decided that
    the best way for people to enter the contest is simply to send a
    letter. Sure, i thought of various tricks and puzzles, but I have
    a tendency to make them very hard. :)

        The prize for the contest will be computer software. The first
    prize will be the latest version of the Amiga/Toaster Reference
    Manual from Area52 software. This is a 1000 page AmigaGuide document
    on disk, including pictures. It covers AmigaDOS, the Workbench,
    Lightwave 3D, over 500 questions & answers, and a dictionary of
    over 800 words. A perfect prize for people who know nothing or
    very little about using the Amiga, or just to learn all the little
    tricks and tips such as writing AmigaDOS scripts. This has a retail
    value of $34.95, and is usre to help many Amiga Report readers.
        Runner-up prizes will also be available. These will include
    older versions of the same package that are no longer shipping.
    The winner of this and all other prizes will be selected randomly
    from a random number generator.
        Also, the first person to solve the following puzzle will win
    a copy of the first prize (in addition to the other winner)
    automatically:

            Recently I purchased a MasterLock combination lock. The
        numbers on the lock are marked from 0 - 35. To open the lock,
        it must be turned to the first number, the second number, and
        then a third number. How many combinations are possible? Keep
        in mind that this is a trick question. Please provide the
        answer along with the formula used to derive the answer.


        We will give it a test run to see how things work out. To enter,
    simply send an email to me at dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu, or
    send a printed letter via "snail mail" through your local post
    office to:

        Amiga Report Contest
        c/o David Tiberio
        6 Lodge Lane
        East Setauket, NY 11733



        In your letter or email, please provide the following:

        Your full name and address. Please keep in mind that many of
    you may have addresses that I am not accustomed to, so please include
    your country or any other information that I would need in case to
    win. An email address should also be included, if possible.

        You must also include a one sentence or "short answer" explanation
    of the editorial content from the editor, Rob Niles, or any stand-in
    editor, in the issue in which you read about this contest. You must
    also include the issue number. For example, if you read this in
    AR213, then include that in your correspondance. Also, the prize winner
    will be determined by a random number generator. Choose a number from
    1 to 262,144. The closest winner or winners to the randomly generated
    number will receive the prize in the mail. Anyone who does not provide
    a number will have one assigned to him randomly.


        DISCLAIMER: This contest is being provided as a service to the
        Amiga community and all persons involved in running this contest
        cannot be held liable for anything that costs you money or
        lifetime pain and anguish. Rules are subject to change. All entries
        must be received by April 30th, 1994. Any entries beyond this date
        will be entered into the next contest, if any.

D/Generation RRP: 29.99

Jukka
-----
You probably know what this is about. Guy running around
a building where strange things happen. D/Generation has
got loose! Overall the game is very much like the floppy
(AGA or not) version. In fact, it's identical. Only the
intro is a bit longer, and controls have been remapped

for CD32's joypad. Joypad isn't the best possible
thing for this game, as controlling the guy is sometimes
too inaccurate and you try to walk on walls etc.
Anyway the game is great adventuring and puzzle solving,
if you can get over the funny gfx that almost don't
have colours at all.
 
Alan
----
When I first slipped this disc in i thought "what the..."
the graphics really are minimalistic - harking back to
the old isometric days (though not as monochromed as "head
over heels" on the speccy). But after spending a few hours
playing i realized how indepth the game really was. Its
certainly a puzzler to contend with. Control with the
standard joypad is a real pain - but its mapped for it
so no joystick option. BTW, I remember the floppy version
wasn't a success. A matter of taste, try before you buy.
 

Saving: saves games at CD32's flash ram.

Diggers/Oscar  RRP: 29.99

Commodore CD32 disk (Millenium/Flair)
 

Jukka
-----
These games come with CD32. Diggers is interesting and
good looking/sounding game of gem digging and strategy
while Oscar is basic platformer. 

Oscar looks great. It uses lots of copper-colours at
background, and has very beautiful fore/background
graphics. But gameplay sucks. There's nothing that
keeps you playing and coming back time after time.
Diggers is quite good, while Oscar fails.
 
Alan
----
 
Diggers was hyped up by the press to be THE puzzle game 
1993, but for me is simply does not cut the mustard (as
the expresion goes). The graphics are nice (AGA) and
the mellow sounds from the CD make for an interesting
atmosphere but the shallow (and VERY slow) gameplay
just trash the game.

Oscar is far too colourful for its own good the baddies
are hard to see but the sound IS good and a generous
amount of continues are given for a platformer. The first
of its genre for the CD32. The game had a nice idea, but
the execution of this idea failed miserably.
All I can say is thank god this Disc came with the CD32
I wouldn't like to have bought it - there again, it gives
bad impressions of CD32 capabilities..

Puke flows when you play this game. Just terrible. It's
ages since I've seen football game so full of bullshit
as this. Looks bad, sounds a bit good and plays awfully.
No way I would touch this again.

Is this a joke? Come on, April the 1st 's not for another few
weeks yet! - seriously, I had the same vomiting problems as Jukka
when I played this title. It really is CRAP. The graphics take
me back to the old soccer days (the days we'd rather forget!!)

The graphics dont even seem to take up 1 colours, let alone 32!
The sound is the only saving grace here - some nice chants and
fx, but the control is awful! If you WANT a soccer game - but
already have Sensi or dont like Sensi, then wait for Krisalis
to release "Man. Utd. Euro. Leag. Champ." as it will be much
better - even Easy AMOS experts can beat this!

Pinball Fantasies RRP: 29.99
21st Century Entertainment
 
Jukka
-----
THE pinball game, of all times. THE glory of 256-colour
AGA-graphics with CD-sound? Not quite. GFX look great,
though their AGA enhancement hasn't been so complete
as one could wish. Anyway the fields look very good.
Game sounds are the old ones, no CD quality here.
As far as gameplay and outlook goes, CD32 version
is 99% identical to the old one. Though compared to

OCS-version this HAS some new things, the 32-bit
maths routines are bit more efficient and gameplay
is remarkable faster - even so much that one guy who

has previously played PF on A500 couldn't get practically
any points as he was used to the "slowness" of A500-version.

Cool. BUT, this is anyway cool. CD-soundtrack at beginning
is nice, but the great thing is that it's all so easy now!

Throw disk in, go and play. No disk swapping, or

password completion. Yes - there is no pw-protection on
CD! This makes be believe to CD-platform!

It's not worlds greatest achievment on CD-technology, but
as game it's supercool. A must to own.
 
Alan
----

You like pinball? Good! Well then, you should get a copy of
this game then - it'll save you a fortune on that addiction of
yours! Seriously, though its not as good as actually playing
fields such as "indiana jones" and "dr who" - not to mention
"twilight zone" ;) it gives them a run for their money.
Graphically this version is the AGA floppy version on a disc.
Loading is extremely quick! and their is no manual protection.
The music is also better. But for CD, they could have at least
added proper pinball sounds - AND put the pinball dreams fields
on the same disc (though they had problems due to P.Dreams

not being OS friendly). This is still one helluva game to own
at any rate. But I wish the flipper controls were on the top

2 "action" buttons rather than on the joypad and red button
 
Saving highscores: are saved to flash ram.

Woah, the cool soccer game on CD? What's new? Well,

not much more. But if you don't have this (on Amiga)
already, then SS is The soccer game to have.*

Well, heres Sensi on the CD, so what do we get for the 
cash? Not a lot more than version 1.1 of the floppy
actually. There are LESS crowd chants and the total 
atmosphere of the game is lost. This version has less
features than the latest Megadrive version - its only
saving grace is the low price. Oh yes, I almost forgot,
control on the Standard C= controller is also diabolical

Commodore reveals A1200 and A4000 CD expansions!
------------------------------------------------

The CeBit computer fair in Hannover took place on the 16th to 23rd of
March. Around 5800 exhibitors and 650,000 visitors attended. CeBit is
huge; busses help you move form one hall to the next, there's hotels,
restaurants, post offices and even a church.

Apple displayed their new PowerMac, Sillicon Graphics had a huge stand
showing of their latest machine.

The 4000 tower was shown, just like it was a year ago. Yes, Commodore
had it up and running at the last CeBit. Mighty strange. Let's hope
they get around to actually selling it now.

Aaaaaaannd.... Commodore revealed their A4000 CD expansion which is
internal and includes MPEG! This is great, since MPEG is controlled by
a standard system device (mpeg.device) and can run from HD as far as I
know, meaning that it'll be extremely easy to do presentations from an
A4000 including live video, with genlocked graphics on top. I suspect
that programs like the Scala MM package will very soon support the
board.

The A1200 expansion unit (called CD1200) is white, and is shaped like
the CD part of a CD32. It's a stand-alone unit which you connect with a
cable. It apparently was more of a prototype than the CD4000.
Unfortunately, the CD1200 can not be expanded with MPEG for the time
being.

Both units fortunately include the AIKIKO chip of the CD32, which any
texture-mapping game (like Wolfenstein or Doom) is quite likely to use.
So there should be no compatibility problems on that account, CD32
games are pretty likely to work. I have no details of pricing for
either unit, unfortunately.

And IBM were using the Amiga and Scala MM again this year. A video-wall
running some presentation/demo featured some distinctly Scala-ish
wipes.

The head of Commodore Germany, Alvin Stumpf, shrugged off the
inevitable questions of AAA and RISC machines, saying that he only
wanted to announce new machines when he could ship them a few days
later. But he admitted that he will announce some "new devices" later
this year. Come on, Commodore, tell us, and tell us now!

I went to CeBit last year, walked at least 100 KM in two days. One of
the funny things about the place is that the different restaurants are
styled in their own special ways; La Cuisine Francaise, pizza and so
on. But the most interesting place is the "Muenchener Bierhalle". For
those of you who haven't met that much German culture, you'll have to
know that there is a (Southern) German tradition of wearing Lederhosen
(very large leather pants), small hats with feathers, drinking 1-liter
beers (served by huge women who carry 6 or 7 at a time) and listening
to "Heimat-musik" (a particularly beer-oriented musical style which
includes yodeling) in huge halls, seated along long wooden tables. The
restaurant at CeBit is approx. 100 times 50 meters, and was completely
packed with visitors who relaxed from watching computer screens by
wearing the aforementioned silly hats, going extremely drunk, and
singing "do-de-li, do-di-ley" along to a lederhosen-wearing band. It's
quite interesting to note the amount of contradiction a person can
contain!

And let's hope the CD expansions hit the stores soon. Can't wait.

The CD32, again
---------------

The official "Creation" commercial for the CD32 runs on German
television in conjunction with the SeaQuest series. It goes like this
(I've only seen the English version): A young man in a white coat is
welcomed to a laboratory by a scientist in another white coat. (You can
tell he's scientist because he is old, his hair is white, and he wears
glasses.) The voice of the young man goes "I never understood why he
chose _me_ to share his secret." They see a CD32 machine, "this was
twice as fast, twice as powerful. (Pan over the "32Bit" text on the
CD32.) He goes on about "colors, the sheer number of colors", the
scientist calls forth a robot which is set to play "MicroCosm".
(MicroCosm is a kind of cute flying-through-arteries-in-a-human-body-
which-is-a-background-animation-and-killing-some-tiny-sprites-on-top-
game.) This, of course, is so great that the robot overloads, the
scientists hits all kinds of red "stop" buttons, the robot explodes,
and the picture stops at "CD32 - The worlds first 32-bit games
console." It's a very professional ad, but it seems to be aimed at a
very young market. Am I too old, is it too late?

NAB '94 Show Report
written by Steve Herring for Amiga Report (c) 1994
 
Let me start off by explaining what NAB is...NAB stands for National
Association of Broadcasters.  The NAB show is generally for the REALLY
wealthy people who happen to be part of the broadcast industry.  Just for
comparison, on-site registration to NAB is $695 vs. the $50 for CES!
 
On with the show, right??  Well, we arrived in Las Vegas (after driving
from Portland, OR to Las Vegas, NV - 18 1/2 hours!) at approx. 12:45 PM on
Sunday, March 20th.  We were supposed to be at NewTek's press conference 
at 2:00 PM.  So after RUSHING to check in to our hotel, and showering, we
finally arrived at Caesars Palace at about 2:00.  Here we were greeted 
with an almost maze-like casino where the conference rooms we were seeking
were at the other end.  The Colisseum rooms were within sight, so the fun
was about to begin.
 
NewTek started the show by quickly introducing a "video" segment and then
dimming the lights.  The video began with narration by Ken Nordine
(Remember him from all the other NewTek demo tapes?) who informed us all 
that we'd have to wait until the beginning of NAB the next day to see 
NewTek's new breakthru. But then finally after a few seconds we were saved
by the next narrator, Penn Jilette (sp?).  We were told that we had waited
long enough.  So, the video introduced what NewTek calls the "Flyer."  The
Flyer is a completely digital non-linear editing system.  What does that 
mean?  Well, the Flyer takes video and records it to a hard drive (it 
takes 2 HD's), so that it can be sequenced (edited) together with any of 
the Toaster transitions, CG's, or effects all in REAL TIME.  I won't go 
into technical details, but the output I saw was stunning.  Tim Jenison 
(NewTek's President) then came out and gave the history of the Flyer and 
how it had been planned to be used with the Toaster ever since the 
beginning.  NewTek's overall demonstration was flat in my opinion, and the
employees who departed a few months back had an obvious impact.  The Flyer
should totally revolutionize the world of video just like the Toaster has.
So, all I can say is, get one if you can! :)
 
After the NewTek press conference, we travelled to the Las Vegas 
Convention Center to pick up our badges for the NAB show the next day.  It
took roughly an hour to get everything straightened out, so after we had 
the badges, we headed off to our hotel to get some MUCH needed sleep.  The
next morning, we parked next to the Convention Center (not an easy task!)
and ventured in. 

My first impression was wow!  There was literally millions of dollars of
equipment all accessible to everyone there.  The absolute best in video
gear was here to play with.  My absolute favorite thing was the HDTV 
stuff. If you haven't seen an HDTV unit yet, you don't know what you're 
missing. There were HDTV cameras from several vendors, including Sony, 
Panasonic, and Toshiba.  The only HDTV recorder that I saw was from 
Toshiba, and it was about the size of a dishwasher.  While NewTek may have
released their digital non-linear editing system, they were definitely not
alone.  I must have seen at least 10 different systems from companies like
Matrox, ImMix, and Abacus.
 
On to the real computer stuff...the MULTIMEDIA side of NAB.  The 
Multimedia expo was held in the Las Vegas Hilton.  Here is where the Amiga
was more prevailent.  Let me see if I can name all the Amiga vendors... 
ASDG was showing a new version of Elastic Reality (the SGI version of 
MorphPlus), Centaur was showing their OpalVision card with all the modules
(it's starting to look REALLY impressive - but it still needs a few
improvements), Video Toaster User was giving VTU issues, Scala was 
demonstrating InfoChannel and Scala MM310, and DevWare was showing their 
Toaster stuff. 

I believe that's almost all the Amiga related vendors that I saw. 
InfoChannel seemed to be gathering quite a crowd the whole time I was 
there (so much so, that it was hard to get around the booth!).  Another 
*INTERESTING* thing at the Multimedia side was Hewlett Packard.  They were
demonstrating their interactive TV set-top box.  The guy I talked to 
didn't have any specific comment on the technology inside, but he did say 
they had two versions of the box.  One was based on Intel technology, and
one was based on Motorola technology (I assume with CD32 stuff being 
added! :D).  The controller for this box was the thing that I liked.  It 
was a remote (IR) with a trackball to control the cursor on the screen.  
The trackball could be pressed as a selector as well.  Very simple, and 
easy to use.  I was impressed by the accuracy of an IR controlled 
trackball!
 
My lasting impressions...There were quite a few things *I* found
interesting, but didn't put here 'cause they don't pertain to the Amiga
community at all (at least not directly).  I do believe NewTek's Flyer
needs some software improvements (which are most likely already underway).
The Flyer is supposed to be available for demonstration in June/July and
available to the market by the Fall!  The business atmosphere of NAB was
kind of refreshing compared to the circus atmosphere of CES, but it was 
harder to get answers from vendors.  This made it slightly frustrating, 
but I began to learn some tricks to get their attention.  Anyway, there 
were lots of new things, which I'm sure I'm only beginning to see what I 
missed.  I look forward to going to the next NAB, and maybe doing another
report!  That is, if I don't get snubbed out of the writing community for
this drab piece of writing! ;)

LineLink modem owners should check out the cool voice mail program in the
library.  I've been playing with it for a bit and I'm really impressed! I
had no idea that this $99 bargain had so much capability.

  In brief, the software provides means of turning your Amiga and LineLink
into a simple answering machine which will play your greeting and record
messages to disk (yes, the little gem digitizes from and plays back to the
phone line) complete with time stamps or caller ID info (if available).  It
can accept fax calls or switch into a BBS with the touch of a key or with
Silent Answer.

  It has a remote maintainance mode (with password) that allows you to 
call in remotely to play back/delete your messages or change the personal
message, password etc.  It has a toll saver option as well.

  And that's only the simple mode.  It also supports a multi-level menu
system, mailboxes for two or three users and more.  The program is 
shareware ($20 or $35) comes functional but you get more configuration 
options if you register.

  You'll need to download three files, the VoiceMail program avm1.11a.lha
(473826 bytes), pre-recorded messages AVMVEngCVSD72.lha (510578 bytes) and
MUI1_4usr.lha (575899 bytes).  If you already have MUI1.4 you can skip the
last file.  You must have MUI1.4 installed for the software to work.
You can digitize your own messages using Perfect Sound or generic 
digitizers or use the telephone.  I recommend getting the pre-recorded 
ones and change them as you see fit.

  The setup uses the CBM Installer program so it's rather easy to startup 
the default system - a one user mailbox system.  Read the instructions at
least once through, there's a lot of information there but it can be 
confusing at first glance.

    2.  To ask a question you must type ? and wait to be recognized       
        by the moderator.  The moderator will notify you with a
        private message indicating you are next in line to ask a
        question.  Try to have the question already prepared so
        that the flow of the conference is quick and smooth.
    3.  Once you ask your question end the question with the
        letters 'GA' indicating 'Go Ahead'.  This tells the moderator     
        and the guests that you have finished asking your question.     
    4.  Once the guest has answered the question, you have the
        option of typing a ! to indicate that you have a followup        
        question or comment.  Please wait once again to be
        recognized by the moderator.

 ImageFX-EGS
 ImageFX 2.0       Exciting new developements for this
                   acclaimed Image processing
                   software.  Ask tonite for details.
 Thanks again for joining us.

(MarkM/MOD) Nova Design.. do you have a opening statement?

(<ImageFX> Kermit W.) We have no formal opening statement on ImageFX. 
We'll be  happy throughout the night to anwer your questions regarding
ImageFX 1.5  or the upcoming release of ImageFX 2.0.   As Gary said, feel
free  to ask about new features, effects ... anything that comes to mind. 
Rusty Mills from Warner Bros is due to show, but is not yet online.  When
he arrives you can ask him about Warner's use of ImageFX in the FOX 
animated series; Animaniacs!

(MarkM/MOD) I want to thank all of you gentlemen for joining us tonight. 
I would like to ask GVP a question...

(<GVP> Gary Nush) Glad to be here.
(MarkM/MOD) GVP:  How soon before the release of the A4000 accelerator? 
(grin) 
(<GVP> Gary Nush) We're producing boards at the factory now.  Units should
 begin shipping before the month ends...

(<IAM>dale) Is SCSI included or optional?  What controller chip?

(<GVP> Gary Nush) SCSI is optional; we're using an NCR chip.

(<IAM>dale) Which connector?  Active or passive termination?

(<GVP> Gary Nush) Probably Active, but the PCB can support both as an
option. 
(<GVP>Steve P.) There is also a RAM optional module.  2 SIMM slots
included and  6 more on the option.  And you can have both the SCSI and
the RAM.  They're not mutually exclusive.

(<IAM>dale) Standard SCSI-II connector (like on 4091)?

(<GVP> Gary Nush) Yep, the stylish looking one. :-)

(Mike Smith) Tell us about IM/FX 2.0 !! I already love 1.5!ga

(<ImageFX> Kermit W.) OK...there are literally hundreds of new things
coming  in the new release...

(<ImageFX> Kermit W.) (actually, it's up to two hundred today. :)  We're
adding more painting tools... more loaders, savers, previews  - more
modules of all types.  There are many new effects being added,  such as
Minimum, Median and Maximum filters, Ripples, Twirls, and  Lens Effects. 
Feel free to ask for specifics.

(<GVP> Gary Nush) BTW, A formal press release is in the works and should
be  released in the near future, listing the new features in more detail 
than this  conference will permit...

(Mike Smith) How's Toaster/FX? Is there full Picasso preview??

(<ImageFX> Kermit W.) I was told yesterday, by the programmer of
ToasterFX,  that it is FINALLY SHIPPING!!  I've used it in beta, it's
amazing.  Literally nothing like it anywhere...it lets you paint directly
on the  Toaster's composite output.  As for Picasso II, we're working with
 the programmers there towards a preview for their board.

(JohnG) Steve: I noticed on the list of new products that the 4098
SCSI-II...  controller was not on the list. Will it still be available?
GA

(<GVP>Steve P.) Sorry to say that we can't do it... There are technical 
problems in the A4000... that prevent it's completion...I can't go into 
the details in this conference, though

(<ImageFX> Kermit W.) I'd like to point out that Rusty Mills, of Warner
Bros,  is now here and can take Animaniacs questions as well.  Thanks for 
coming Rusty!!

(WarnerBros) hello everyone and I'm glad to be here GA

(JohnG) OK Steve, understandable. Well lets hear about some of the new....
 loaders Kermit. What's in the works?

(<ImageFX> Kermit W.) We're adding about a dozen or more new loaders and
savers  in ImageFX 2.0 ... these include support for the C64 Koala format 
<grin>, SGI Wavefront RLA/RLB, Xwindows X11 .xwd, Macintosh PICT, 
Sunraster, PAR ...and many more.

(Juan Casado Poblado) will the IM/FX-EGS and ImFX 2.0 be identically
(except  EGS structure)?

(<GVP> Gary Nush) No, ImageFX-EGS is on par with 1.5, and 2.0 is a whole 
new ballgame.

(<ImageFX> Kermit W.) Although 2.0 will include EGS support as well...just
 with all the new features as well.

(Juan Casado Poblado) will be an direct loader for KodakPhoto abailable on
 SpectraPaint?

(<GVP> Gary Nush) We're investigating, but Kodak's current $$$ are high. 
(MM) I would like to change the subject for a moment.  The Amiga has a 
short coming with both serial and parallel ports..
 which you have addressed with your I/O extender card.
 Can you tell me about your current product and whats coming in the... 
future?

(<GVP>Steve P.) Well I listed a few items at the opening statement...  but
we have nothing *new* for an ioExtender. The one we have...
 Is doing just fine at the moment. GA

(MM) So the io card will remain at one serial port for the time being? 
I'm...  thinking of the user who runs a bbs and needs mult ports.  I think
 this is important since CBM no longer makes their card. ga

(<GVP>Steve P.) It is actually 2 serial ports.  Only one supplied in basic
 package.... second is avail as an optional accessory...
 multi cards can be placed in one machine....

(<GVP>Steve P.) There wasn't enough demand for more than 2 ports per card
at  this time.Sorry.

(MarkM/MOD) I want to ask a question of Rusty.. Just what is Warner
Brothers  doing with ImageFX?  I love it when Amiga products are used for
 television. :-)

(<Warner Bros> Rusty) Well I have been a long time amiga user and it did
what  I needed...which was to create the title cards for Animaniacs... 
and to do various color corrections on backgrounds and whatever else I 
desired.

(<GVP>Steve P.) PS My daughters watch it every day <grin>

(MarkM/MOD) Are there many Amigas at Warner Brothers?

(<Warner Bros> Rusty) Nope only my A4000 but I run circles around the MACs
and SGI's with it!

(MM) Rusty, if thats the case.  Have others there expressed interest in
moving  to the Amiga as their work platform?

(<Warner Bros> Rusty) Mostly as a personal home machine but not the
computer  department.  They like to bost about how much their machines
cost! 
(jon - GroVeR) GVP: During the Jessup/Haynie conference, it was mentioned 
that C= was considering EGS as their RTG standard. Any comment on that? 
(<GVP> Gary Nush) We are obviously excited about EGS and it's future, but
we  are also aware of Commodore design needs and goals, and we're trying
to  move forward with them.

(jon - GroVeR) So, does that mean that EGS might be adopted, or that
EGS...  will function in their RTG design?

(<GVP> Gary Nush) I cannot comment further at this time due to NDA. 
(Leslie T. Bartiromo) I'm using IV24 on an 030 A2000. Is the IV24 4000
software  avalible to me as an upgrade?  Thanks.

(<GVP>Steve P.) IV24-A4000 is a hardware change and was only built in PAL 
at this time.

(Leslie T. Bartiromo) So there is no Image FX avalible for the users of
the  older boards?

(<GVP>Steve P.) ImageFX standalone (1.5 is current) works great!

(Leslie T. Bartiromo) I was also wondering about the EGS paint too. 
(<GVP>Steve P.) That was not brought forward for IV24-A4000 at this time.

(Steve Setzer) Kermit:  Does Image F/X 2.0 have a encapsulated postscript 
Loader/saver?

(<ImageFX> Kermit W.) No Postscript loading for ImageFX 2.0 I'm afraid. 
ImageFX 1.5 can already output EPS Postscript files via the Postscript 
print module.

(Steve Setzer) Can in import it also?

(<ImageFX> Kermit W.) Import how?  Can you elaborate?

(Steve Setzer) Well, have been using Final Writer lately and would like to
 play with some of the clip art.

(<ImageFX> Kermit W.) Ah.  Well, like I said there is no planned
Postscript  loader/importer.  You could always find a program that can
load the  clipart and out put it as an IFF then load the IFF into ImageFX.

(Steve Setzer) alas that is what I am doing now and was looking for a more
 straight forward way to handle it...paiteince when you are an amiga 
owner

(<ImageFX> Kermit W.) It's a great idea and it's definitely on our "to do"
 list someday soon.

(<Warner Bros> Rusty) I just want to clear something up that I said
earlier...  As for how many Amiga's are being used... I am only in the
Animation  department do places  that do other types of work such a
Babylon 5  are seperate from me and I can't speak for them.

(Trent Hawkins) GVP: With the release of the CD32, does GVP plan to make
any  hardware that would allow a CD-ROM equipped A1200 or 4000 to run CD32
 discs?

(<GVP> Gary Nush) Not at this time.

(Trent Hawkins) But it is not being ruled out tho?

(<GVP> Gary Nush) No it's not, but the CD32 has a custom chip that A1200's
 (and A4000's) don't.  That's a tough thing to overcome...

(Stuart H. Brand) Can you tell us anything about the "DSS-16", both the 
internal and the PCMCIA versions?

(<GVP>Steve P.) There are 2 versions being planned and designed at this
time..  One inserts in the DMA Peripheral Port on our A1230Turbo Series II
 and the other is a PCMCIA card.  Both will play and sample 16bit 48K 
audio in stereo and mix multiple.  The speed of a EGS28/24sources  and
play back simultaneously.  Real multitasking!

(Stuart H. Brand) OK, can I use both at the same time, or is that asking a
 little much. And can you give us an idea of what type of software will 
accompany it?

(<GVP>Steve P.) Unknown at this time if they will both operate
simultaneously  We hadn't tried that yet... As for the software... We are
preparing  DSS version 3.0 for this...Real nice stuff with a new
interface,  mixing panel, etc  ...

(<GVP> Gary Nush) Both work well independently, though! :-)

(jon - GroVeR) Will the PCMCIA version work with PClone portables? Will
there  be a Zorro version (possibly as an audio-for-video solution, i.e., 
Sunrize competitor)?

(<GVP> Gary Nush) Yes, the PCMCIA hardware will be our first
cross-platform  product. There are no current plans for a Zorro version.

(MarkM/MOD) Garry.. will there be a version that works on the A4000 at
all? 
(<GVP> Gary Nush) Not in the immediate future.

(Juan Casado Poblado) will be there an EGS-animation program to take full 
advantage of the EGS-spectrum board?

(<GVP> Gary Nush) I'm not sure if I can say this yet, but I'll take my 
chances...Magic Lantern now fully supports the SPECTRUM in multiple  ways
for ultimate animation performance!

(<Warner Bros> Rusty) Yes you can say it Brad said it last week at another
 conference

(JohnG) OK Kermit, we know some about the new loaders and savers of
ImageFX  2.0, anything new concerning the preview and render modes?

(<ImageFX> Kermit W.) New previews will include anything EGS of course. 
We're  also working with the Picasso II guys on their preview module.  New
 render modules will include the Harlequin.

(Carl Hansen) Back to the 040 board.  Will the same one work on the A3000
and  A4000? If not will the price be the same?

(<GVP> Gary Nush) The same board will work in both machines!

(Carl Hansen) Price?

(<GVP> Gary Nush) $1800 MSRP with 4MB's installed.  Street price will
vary. 
(MarkM/MOD) I have two questions that I would like to end with--before 
prizes.. :-)  The first one I want to direct at Nova Design..
 I would like to ask how you would compare your product (ImageFX) to  your
competitions?

(<ImageFX> Kermit W.) That's hard to do here...

(MarkM/MOD) Ok.. a better question would be why should someone pick
ImageFX  over say Adpro or ImageMaster?

(,<ImageFX> Kermit W.) In short, ImageFX is a complete solution.  You have
 every image processing tool you need right at hand - completely
 integrated.

(<Warner Bros> Rusty) How about if I interject here!

(<ImageFX> Kermit W.) Sure...take a shot at it Rusty! :)

(<Warner Bros> Rusty) Being a user on the outside I cna tellyou what drove
me  towards IFX...It was the most like Photoshop on the Amiga...And now 
with 2.0 ImageFX is moveing closer to Photoshop which has become an 
industry standard and IFX works well with the SGI formats too!  As a 
professional I really needed to see my work as I did it and I needed  the
program to be fast and IFX did the job.

(MarkM/MOD) Ok.. my second question is to GVP... I would like to know
GVP's  general feeling about the future of Commodore and GVPs future
 developing new Commodore Amiga products?

(<GVP>Steve P.) GVP remains comitted to the Amiga platform...We are
actively  developing new products for Amiga systems, and although we have
 brought out some product in the PC arena this doesn't mean we are 
abandoning the platform in any way.

(<GVP> Gary Nush) Commodore has had it's ups and downs before and they've 
always pulled through.  I believe they will again, perhaps in a
 different market niche, but again nevertheless.

(sja) First of all, I'm sorry that I've missed most the the CO ...  altho
I've been online, I wasn't paying attention due to ...
 helping my son with his math homework  <grin> ...
 and, if this question has already been asked, please let me know and 
we'll move on .. I have heard that GVP has dropped all telephone/voice 
support, is this the case?

(<GVP>Steve P.) Here's the story... We are providing full tech support via
 Fax, mail and here on CServe.  We also are providing TS indirectly 
through your dealer.  This is the most effective method of support 
available, it's just painful to make the changes.

(MM) I'd just like to say that I did call your tech support once and
recieved...  prompt and excellent support for a hardware problem.  I and
prob most...  users feel better being able to actually speak with someone
with the CO.  So I hope this new way will not damage the aspect of GVP.

(<GVP>Steve P.) Thanks... We are looking forward to better things all the
time.  Let's get on to the prizes!

(MarkM/MOD) Ok.. we got a pile of 'em too.. Why not tell them what you
folks  are giving away tonight ?

(<GVP> Gary Nush) We have six prizes tonight:
 Three ImageFX 1.5's right now (which include free upgrade's to 2.0  when
it's launched), and...
 Three DSS8+'s (which include free upgrade's to the 3.0 software when 
it's released).

(MarkM/MOD) Ok.. lets give away the first ImageFX... I am going to roll
for  Jon (grover)
 Ready..

(MarkM/MOD) Harry that was already asked earlier.

(Harry Callesis) As I said, I got here late ... 8^)

(<GVP>Steve P.) Harry, Send me EMail here on this and I'll discuss it with
you.  it's 11:30 here and I get up at 5am for work <grin>

"The Video Guide to ImageFX in the real near future here...the official 
announcement will come out in the next few days...it is hosted by  me and
covers all of IFX 1.5 Including CineMorph!
 Call GVP or your local dealer for inquireies

(Mike Smith) great!

(MarkM/MOD) Excellent!!!

(JohnG) Outstanding!!!

(Chris Tolmie) Rusty > I will want to purchase a copy.

(Harry Callesis) Steve: Thanks ...

(MarkM/MOD) I would like to thank the folks from GVP for coming here
tonight! 
(MarkM/MOD) I would like to announce the next conference...

%%                Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users                 %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

  Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

  The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software, online.

  Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

  Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES.

  35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

  No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

  Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

  Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

  Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

  FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
  Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  

  Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

  The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
  Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
  All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

  Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

  And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

Portal Signup or for more information:

   408-973-8091 (modem 9600/14400) 24 hours every day

   or enter "C PORTAL" from any Sprintnet dial-in in the USA,
   or telnet to "portal.com" from anywhere.

* plus cost of phone call if out of Portal's local dialing area
  Direct rates also apply to connections made to Portal using the
  UNIX "telnet" program from an account you may already
  have on an Internet-connected system. 
% 9600 bps Sprintnet in over 300 cities areas
+ $10 rate prevails at smaller US Cities
# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

%% BIX - Byte Information Exchange             Lots of information!     %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and 
enthusiasts. While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is
the place for knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.
You're likely to find many others in similar situations who can offer 
advice, give technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.


                       *** FULL INTERNET ACCESS! ***

BIX features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription. 


                      ==============================
                      Rates and Connect Information:
                      ==============================


BIX membership costs $13 per month, plus connect time.  There are several 
different ways to connect:

SprintNet*              $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet:**               $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
(SprintNet and Tyment rates shown are for 48 contiguous US states only.)
                                                        
Tymnet Canada:          $4/hr eves/wkends           $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet Hawaii:          $10/hr eves/wkends          $20/hour weekdays   
Telnet(via Internet):   $1/hour, round the clock
Direct dial (Boston):   $2/hour, round the clock (up to 9600 bps)
 
 * SprintNet daytime hours are from 6am to 7pm, M-F, ET.
** Tymnet daytime hours are from 7am to 6pm, M-F, ET.

                20/20 PLAN OPTION (for USA-48 users only):

Volume users can choose the 20/20 Advantage Plan, which is $20 per month
and includes the first 20 hours of access by any combination of methods 
from the contiguous United States.  Additional use is $1.80 per hour 
(additional use for telnet access is $1 an hour).  The 20/20 Plan's cost 
is in addition to the $13 monthly fee.  


                           INTERNATIONAL USERS:

If you wish to connect internationally through Tymnet or SprintNet, 
please contact your local PTT.  BIX accepts prepaid international calls,
direct dial, or telnet connections.  In order to make a "collect" (not 
prepaid) call to BIX, your account must be verified before the charges 
are accepted.  When you complete the registration, we'll mail you a BIX
Membership Agreement by regular US Mail.  Whe you receive it, sign it 
and return it to us by mail.  When we receive it here, we'll authorize
your account to make reverse charged calls.

If you want to access BIX right away, contact your local PTT to set up a 
prepaid account.  You'll pay your local carrier for your calls to BIX in
advance, so there's no waiting period or verfication needed. Or, connect 
at BIX via telnet to x25.bix.com.

SprintNet international calls from most locations are $24 an hour.
Tymnet international charges vary, but are generally between $20-$30 an 
hour.

TITLE

     AXsh - Amiga external shell

VERSION

     1.31 - a non-crippled evaluation version

AUTHOR

     Pasi 'Albert' Ojala	Internet: albert@cs.tut.fi OR
					  albert@cc.tut.fi

DESCRIPTION

     AXsh's main purpose is to let other users have access to your
     Amiga and still be sure that nothing inappropriate can happen.
     AXsh ensures this by allowing access only to directories that are
     defined accessible and only accepting commands and arguments that
     are defined legal.

     AXsh supports multiple lines, multiple users logged in
     simultaneously and 8 different user levels. User actions can be
     saved into a log file. Each user has his/her own home directory,
     and the used disk space can be/is restricted.

     AXsh can be used as a bulletin board system with or without
     UUCP or as a door program in a 'normal' BBS. It has its own mail,
     news and file transfer programs. However, AXsh is not restricted
     to remote access, it can be very well used as a local shell.

     The shell itself has command line editing, function key macros,
     history, aliases, variables and scripts. It also has filename and
     commandname completion assigned to the TAB key. VT100, Ansi and
     dumb terminal modes are currently supported.

     Many useful programs are included in the packet and any CLI-based
     programs can easily be added.

     AXsh systems can be connected together to form a network, so that
     mail and news are exchanged between systems. You can also use UUCP
     instead of the native AXsh net system or you can use another
     transport mechanism like Fidonet (TrapDoor) to transfer AXsh net
     packets. News and mail programs are configurable to fully interface
     with UUCP or CNews.

     If you have WB2.1, you can choose the used language from English,
     Finnish, Spanish, French, Danish, Swedish and German. New 2.0
     features are also used, but you can still use AXsh with ks1.3 if
     you have arp.library.


NEW FEATURES

     All known security holes patched.

     Possibility to kick out users and a crude time-limit feature.

     New, faster serial handler.

     Possibility to have userlevel-specific configuration files
     for FFE and Rn (allows restricted file/news areas).

     Numerous bug fixes and improvements.

     It is now possible to install from hard disk (Assign AXshPack:
     to the directory you unarchived the InstallDisk packet).


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     arp.library (v39) OR ks2.0

     LhA (or Lx) to unpack the archive, installation disk and language catalogs

     C= Installer in the WorkBench command path to use the installation
     script (usually SYS:System/Installer)


SUGGESTED ENVIRONMENT

     A hard disk, about 1M for a basic one-user system without news

     At least 1M of memory

     A modem for remote access


HOST NAME/FILE NAME

     ftp.funet.fi:/pub/amiga/shells/AXsh/AXsh-1.31-demo.{lha,readme}

     Aminet sites, util/shell/AXshDemo131.lha


PRICE

     Suggested shareware/registration fee is US$30


DISTRIBUTABILITY

     The demo version can be freely distributed, provided that the
     contents of the archive remain intact.


IMPORTANT!

     This can be the last 1.3-compatible version. However, bugfixes will
     be done for registered users, if needed. The next version will be
     totally new inside, writing applications will be easier, the security
     will improve etc. If there is enough interest (and registrations),
     I might consider making a 1.3-compatible version also.

TITLE

    CycleToMenu - turns cycle gadgets into popup menus


VERSION

    2.0  (20.3.94)


AUTHOR

    Federico Giannici <MC4080@mclink.it>


DESCRIPTION

    CycleToMenu is a commodity that turns the standard cycle gadgets
    into popup menus or "expanding" gadgets. This way, selecting the
    desired option is easier and faster.

    The look and behaviour of the popup menus are highly configurable
    by a font&resolution-sensitive configuration window.

    CycleToMenu works under AmigaOS 2.0 but takes advantage of some
    features of AmigaOS 3.x.

    The archive contains the documentation and localization files in
    four languages: English, Italian, German and Dutch.


NEW FEATURES

    - The popup menus' look&behaviour is now highly configurable
    - Added a font&resolution-sensitive configuration window
    - Complete localization of the program (AmigaOS 2.1 required)
    - Parameters can be used both from Workbench and Shell
    - It's now possible to quit the program


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    AmigaOS 2.0.
    AmigaOS 2.1 is required for the localization.


HOST NAME

    Available via anonymous FTP from Aminet,
    for example ftp.luth.se (130.240.18.2).


DIRECTORY

    /pub/aminet/os20/cdity


FILENAME

    CycleToMenu-20.lha  (37712 bytes)


PRICE

    Free.


DISTRIBUTABILITY

    The archive is freely distributable as long as the archive remains
    intact and only a nominal fee is charged for its distribution.

    This program is CardWare: if you like it, send a postcard of your
    country to the author.
