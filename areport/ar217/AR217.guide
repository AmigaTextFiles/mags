As of 4:50pm Eastern Time...nobody has made an announcement in that they
were taking over what we formerly new of C=.

Darn.

For the good news though, it looks like things are moving forward
as far as the idea of Samsung taking over Commodore. Inventory of
stock is being made, and other signs seem favourable.

I really don't want to get into rumor mongering though, so I'll
keep the supposed details to myself for right now. Sorry :)

I'm still having problems with the computer...mostly becuase that
"time" thing is short, but as you see, it's not preventing me from
gettin AR out.

I want to thank David Tiberio for the "AR Logo" above....looks superb!!

I also wanted to thank the people that creat the "Think! Amiga"
newsletter for sending me one! The newsletter is fantastic! The
newsletter is a production of the Sittingbourne Computer Club in
England. You can contact them by calling +44 81 952 7719 (EIS BBS)
and send a message to either Andy Everingham or Peter Barrow.

Until next week, take care, and enjoy!

Announcement from NewTek
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NewTek Inc.
May 5, 1994

Dear Friend of the Toaster,

I'm sure you're aware of Commodore's recent announcement of their
liquidation, as it is obviously an issue of concern to everyone connected
with the Video Toaster.  Rumors have been rampant for weeks about what 
would happen, but getting the facts has been a little more difficult.

We want you to know that we weren't caught by surprise.  Events over the
past nine months made it very clear that something would have to change 
and that Commodore's liquidation was a possibility.  It didn't take a 
mind reader to see Commodore's troubles.

Liquidation certainly wasn't the only possibility, however.  Even as late
as last week we were aware that other options were being pursued.  While 
no one could know exactly what would happen, or when, we did know that 
something would happen and made plans for that eventually.  For reasons 
that we hope you will understand, we cannot talk about all of these 
things at the moment. What we can say unequivically is that we are 
committed to the Video Toaster and our customers.  We are taking the 
following steps in support of this goal:

1)  Development on the Flyer is on schedule for shipment of demo units to
    dealers in July and shipment to end users early fall.  Of course, the
    Flyer provides capabilities highly sought after by the existing 
    Toaster user base.

2)  We are monitoring product availability in the channel and will provide
    you with all the information we can gather.  At this point, it appears
    that there are Amiga 4000's availabile worldwide to meet demand for 
    the next several months.

3)  We will continue to market the Video Toaster and Video Toaster Flyer 
    as always.

4)  We are investigating an Amiga refurbishment program.

5)  We are continuing our ongoing Toaster development program.

We realize that there are still a number of questions left unanswered,
but know that as answers become available, we will pass the information on
to you.  A great deal of exciting development continues in Topeka and I
believe that you will be happy with the news coming from here as the year
progresses.

Sincerely,

Tim Jenison
President

PORTER JOINS SCALA AS VP OF ENGINEERING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WASHINGTON, D.C., MAY 16, 1994 - Jeffery S. Porter, former director of
advanced technology for Commodore International Limited, has joined Scala,
Inc., the leader in computer-based television information systems, as vice
president of engineering.  In this position, Porter will head all
world-wide research and development activities with offices in Exton, PA,
and Oslo, Norway.

Scala's founder and President Jon Bohmer said, "Jeff has been the key
development person for the Amiga since 1986, and brings to Scala a proven
track record of product management and technical leadership.  His presence
at Scala will help us sustain our increasingly rapid growth."

Porter, employed by Commodore in various capacities since 1984, has been
employed by Bell Laboratories, AT&T Consumer Products and the Eastman
Kodak Company.  He holds a Masters of Science degree in Electrical
Engineering from the Unviersity of Illinois and a Bachelor of Science
degree in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University.

He is co-author of a book entitled "MultiMedia Systems: The Convergence of
Computers, Communications and Consumer Products" published by the ACM.
"I've been a fan of Scala from the beginning," said Porter.  "Scala's ease
of authoring and low-cost playback make it a natural for interactive
television.  The next step is to support a cross platform architecture for
Scala that includes PC compatibles and set top boxes.  Scala's technology
is years ahead of Mac and PC solutions, due to the "TV-centric" heritage
of the Amiga.  It's compact and efficient and can be embedded in other
systems such as the General Instrument satellite television receivers
being developed for PRIMESTAR (R)."

Scala, founded in 1987 in Norway and incorporated in the U.S. in 1992,
develops and markets computer-based television information solutions.
Available in ten languages, Scala's multimedia tools are used by 45,000
users in more than 40 countries.

Scala is a registered tradkmark of Scala, Inc.  
PRIMESTAR is a registered trakemark of PRIMESTAR PARTNERS LP.

Soft-Logik plans to release PageStream 3.0 in the near future.
Commodore's bankruptcy will not have an effect on our Amiga development.
We will continue to develop PageStream, and while we hope in the future
that it will be available for other platforms, we are too busy with our
Amiga products to consider that now. Remember that just because Commodore
is out of business does not mean that your Amiga will stop working. We
hope to release more Amiga products in the future.

NEW SAS/C PRICING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dear Amiga Developers,
 
Concerning the recent announcements by Commodore, I wanted to let you know
that SAS Institute, Inc. intends to continue selling and providing
technical support for the SAS/C Development System with C++ as long as
there is a viable market.  However, due to the uncertainty of the market,
the Institute's management has decided to suspend new
development on the Amiga-specific parts of the product.  This policy will
remain in effect until changes in the market warrant
reconsideration.
 
Development will continue on those portions of the product that are used
on other platforms, including the code generator, the global and
peephole optimizers, the C++ translator, and the debugger.  If we see a
viable Amiga market in the future, we will be in a good position to
produce a new release for it with a minimum of lost time.
 
Also in response to the Commodore announcements and many user
suggestions, SAS Institute Inc. announces the following new prices for the
SAS/C Development System with C++, effective immediately:
 
                Version 6.50...................$199.00
                Upgrade from Version 6...........59.00
                Upgrade from Version 5...........99.50
                Upgrade from Version 4...........99.50
                Academic discount................99.50
                Manx trade-in offer..............99.50
 
These prices are in US dollars and do not include shipping charges.
Customers outside the US, please contact your local SAS Institute office
or your nearest Amiga distributor for prices in your area. We do not plan
to send a mailing to registered users, so please
take the initiative to contact SAS Institute if you would like
to take advantage of the new upgrade price.
 
If you have comments or suggestions about our development policy, please
send email to "ts4sasca@unx.sas.com" or write to
 
      Amiga C Marketing
      SAS Institute Inc.
      SAS Campus Drive
      Cary, NC 27513
 
Please do NOT send email to me, Jim Cooper, Steve Krueger, Khristi
Tomlinson, Diane Gomez, or Gerlinde Schuster with suggestions for future
development plans or product offerings.  We will just ask you to go
through one of the above channels.
 
On a personal note, I'd like to add that I plan on keeping my Amiga and
supporting the Amiga community in any way possible.  I've been an Amiga
developer since March of 1986, and I'd hate to see it go.  Look for a new
release of parnet soon 8^)

MacroSystem GmbH of Germany Announcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jorg Sprave, president of MacroSystem GmbH, located in Witten, Germany,
is pleased to announce the appointment of NoahJi's as the exclusive
distributor of MacroSystem product in the United States.

Technical support, repair, and service will be handled by NoahJi's.
Software updates for the V-Lab and the Retina will also be made available
at a modest charge for current owners of these products.

NoahJi's is the Amiga board division of Micro Reps, Inc. a 10-year-old
distribution company. Eric Kloor, president of NoahJi's, is excited to
begin distribution of the remarkable line of product manufactured by
MacroSystem GmbH.

The Retina Z3, with updated hardware features and astonishingly fast
software, will soon be impressing the US market. In the current issue of
The Amiga Magazine, Germany's largest, 10 different graphics boards were
reviewed. The Z2 Retina was called "nearly legendary, " and in
price/performance comparisons towered above the others. The only more
impressive board in the tests was the new Retina Z3. Both products
received glowing and strong recommendations.

The Toccata 16 bit I/O board, which has been available in Germany for over
6 months, will now be available for the US market. The V-Lab Y/C 24 bit
realtime video digitizer will also join the product mix of NoahJi's. 
An astounding new product that is currently in production and will be
available here in July is the VLab Motion Card. This card is a Zorro II
motion JPEG board for non-linear video editing and playback. The VLab
Motion product contains a digitizer plus a video output device with YUV
4:2:2 square pixel quality and embedded hardware scaling and a genlock
with chroma keying for real-time blue box effects as well as the
compression/decompression JPEG chipset which runs at 29.5 Mhz peak
frequency. The board has composite and Y/C inputs and outputs, and also
features an expansion socket for add-ons like piggy packed YUV or RGB
component transcoders, and an interface for outputting over NewTek's Video
Toaster. The V-Lab Motion board does not require a time based corrector
and can be combined with existing hard drives and controllers. VLab Motion
also comes with MovieShop, a complete editing software package that
features a hierarchical editor, B/W or color reference stamps, and a time
line editor. Perfect interfacing with the Retina and the Toccata allow
simultaneous recording and playback of audio and video.

Brilliant.  I write some editorials about how it seems like the worst has
passed for Commodore, and here we are, seat-edging, waiting to see
who, if anyone, will buy the sinking ship of C=.  Never ask me for
stock tips.

This leaves an awfully big void waiting under the feet of Amiga users.
Well, it COULD be worse.  I have seen a good amount of developers
and companies come out and strongly support the Amiga.  The only
lukewarm response I've seen was from GVP, whose message can
be summed up as such:

"Well, it's a damn shame Commodore's going down. Lucky for us, we've
started doing PC hardware.  So, sure, we'll sell off our inventories, 
build some Spectrums if we need overtime and maybe release a couple
new things if they were two days away from the first run, but don't
wait up for us to save the Amiga."

Actually, my sum-up was longer, I think, but more descriptive.

Unfortunately, I can't blame them too much.  That's not to say
that I'd do the same in their position, because I'd like to think that
I wouldn't.  Luckily, all of the other press releases have been
positive and hopeful, which is what I'd like to remain.

The rumors abound way too much.  I have made a couple of phone
calls and haven't learned anything useful about who or what
may own Commodore or various pieces of Amiga hardware.
I'd love to wake up tomorrow morning with Commodore and the
Amiga looking into the future, but right now I'm content to know
that it isn't over yet.

CEI just commissioned the CEI A1962 monitor: a successor to
the 1960, this time built by Electrohome.  At least all those 1200s,
if we ever see them again, will have something to output to.

MacroSystem has a new US distributor (strangely, MacroSystem US
doesn't distribute MacroSystem hardware anymore).  The company
name is NoahJi's, and we'll be running reviews of the Toccata 16
(imminent, once I figure out what to do with the thing), the Retina
Z-III, and possibly the V-Lab and upcoming V-Lab Motion boards.

I'm still waiting for my Paravision SX-1, due tomorrow in the mail.

My review of the Vortex 486SLC2 should begin as soon as I can
get it to work.

Sound good for now?  At least you know I've been working hard,
even if I have nothing to show for it now.

Until next time, don't walk the plank.

%% Programming HASH Tables                          by @{" David Tiberio " link P8-4} %%
%%                                     dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

One of the most important data structures used in programming is the HASH
table. This system has many advantages; it is fast, the data is easy to
organize, and it is easy to program. One of the drawbacks is that it is
not as dynamic as some data structures, although it can be combined with
other data structures to make it more dynamic. Another drawback is that it
may be hard to find a good hashing function that applies equally well to
all of your data.

A hash table is an array of fixed size. Each location of the array can
hold one piece of data or many pieces of data, including other hash tables
or linked lists. An example of a hash table is the telephone system. In
this example, I will be using the American telephone system.

Each region has its own three digit number. For example, Long Island uses
the 516 area code. Queens (one part of New York City) uses the 718 area
code. Manhattan, also a part of New York City, uses 212. Other parts of
New York City use different area codes.
Next there are local calling exchanges. East Setauket uses numerous
exchanges, such as 476 and 473. Stony Brook University uses 632 and 444,
although other exchanges are used for the Stony Brook area. Last of all,
each house can have its own 4 digit code. For example, my house has 4
lines coming into it. One is 5156, another 6351, another 3516, and another
1615. Now, we take these three groups of numbers and put them together to
get a hashed phone number. To reach my house, you could call 516-476-6351,
516-473-5156, 516-476-3516, etc. Note that none of these numbers ring my
personal phone BTW :). Some of these numbers used to be here but were
disconnected (such as my old BBS number). Now, anyone in North America
would dial one of these numbers, which would be hashed through the system.
First to Long Island, then to East Setauket, then to my house.


Here is another example. You have 10 people, and you want to store them in
an array with 5 spaces. Here are the people:

    David Pleasance
    Irving Gould
    Jay Miner
    Jim Drew
    John DiLullo
    Lewis Eggebrecht
    Marc Barrett
    Mehdi Ali
    RJ Michaels
    Rob Niles

Here is how the information is stored:

1

2   RJ

3   Jay, Jim, Rob

4   John, Marc

5   David, Lewis, Mehdi

6   Irving

What about each person places them in the given array location? The HASH
function in this case is very simple. The length of the first name was
used, placing RJ all by himself in the 2 letter location with Irving in the
6 letter bucket (a bucket is a term used ot refer to an array location).
Now, in the cases were more than one person is in a bucket, a link is made
between each name starting at the first name placed in the bucket. For
example, to find Mehdi, you would look in bucket 5 since Mehdi is 5 letters
long. First you find David, then you check to the next name on the list to
find Lewis, and then the next name you find is Mehdi. After Mehdi, you
would place a NULL pointer, as with the last element of each bucket. The
1st bucket merely contains a NULL pointer.


There is more than just one way to make a HASH function. Here are some to
try:

    AMIGA: Add the ASCII characters for each letter together,
           then do a MOD (MOD is a remainder function) on the size of the
           array. In C, this might look like:

           bucket = ('A' + 'M' + 'I' + 'G' + 'A') % array_size;

    RULES: Let's try something different with this word (which I chose as
           an example for no particular reason). Instead of adding the
           ASCII values, we could try using RAW keycodes. The RAW keycodes
           are determined by the location of the keys on the keyboard,
           as opposed to alphabetically. For example, a DVORAK keyboard
           would have different RAW keycodes than a QWERTY keyboard.
           The % (MOD function) is used to ensure that if the total is
           greater than the size of the array, then it will start again
           from the beginning of the array until it fits.

           bucket = (19 + 22 + 40 + 18 + 33) % array_size;


There are some key issues to remember. First, the hash function should
tell the difference between the position of letters. For example, the
above sample with AMIGA would have the same bucket as AGIMA or MAGIA,
since they contain the same ASCII values. The total HASH value should
not exceed the size of the array (hence the MOD function is used). You
may place more than one item in a bucket only if you link them with a
link list or use a second hash function to divide the bucket into a
second array. Or, if there is a collision (an item is already in the
bucket), you can check the next bucket in the array until you find a
free one. If you use the second method, the size of the array must be
equal to or greater than the total number of data items you are working
with.

REVIEW

	The manual tells the story of a race of small furball creatures
called Tinies.  Tinies look like tennis balls with eyes, and according to
the manual, they have a horrid sense of humour.  The Tiny King has
apparently been taken prisoner and been imprisoned in his own castle by a
Tiny with a particularly wicked sense of humour.  Yes, this is where you
come in. :-)

	When the game boots, you're shown a glitchy animated sequence
portraying all this, accompanied by some decent CD audio.  Once you're at
the title screen, you can start a new game or restart one of four saved 
games.

	The object of the game is simple:  take control of a Tiny and find
your way to the exit of each level.  Your Tiny can walk, run, and jump 
three different heights.  As if that isn't enough, your Tiny is also able
to transform into any of 4 colours, each one having a special ability:

		Red    - eats through walls
		Yellow - shoots fireballs to kill nasties
		Green  - swings and climbs on rope
		Blue   - dives underwater

	Green is my favourite.  It's great fun swinging the little critter
back and forth on the rope, then letting go and watching him fly across 
the screen and do a couple of somersaults before landing on the ground!

	Not all of the abilities are available all the time.  On some 
levels, you may only have one ability, and on others, you might get all 4.
To make it harder, there are force-field type things which enable or 
disable an ability when you pass through them.

	You view the action from the standard platform perspective (side 
on), and the levels scroll in all directions.  The game takes place over
8 areas, with each area having 10 levels based on the same theme.  The 
levels are full of all sorts of obstacles designed to reduce your Tiny to 
an ex-furball before reaching the exit.  There's trees, water, spikes and
loads more, and of course the usual array of NASTIES.  You must make use 
of the various abilities of your Tiny to negotiate these obstacles.

	As you progress into the game, the puzzle element starts rearing 
its head.  As well as avoiding (or shooting) all the nasties, you also 
have to start solving problems in order to reach the exit.  These puzzles
range from simple things, like finding and using keys, to more complex 
ones, like moving blocks and finding secret entrances.  The puzzles rely 
on the correct choice of abilities in most cases, and also require some 
pretty nifty joypad skills on some of the later levels.

	Every 5 levels, your position is saved in Non-Volatile RAM.


DOCUMENTATION

	The booklet in the CD sleeve has instructions in English, French,
Dutch, Italian and Spanish.  It covers everything you need to know (not a
lot, really) and has some nice black and white drawings.


LIKES

	Great fun.  It's playable, cute, and best of all:  totally silly!
There's something distinctly warped about a 10-pixel high ball of fluff
letting fly with a Streetfighter-style fireball. :-)

	The game-saving feature means you can restart where you left off
instead of playing through all the levels again.  This adds a lot to the
longevity of any game in my opinion; if I can restart where I left off, 
I'll keep coming back until I finish it (or go insane).

	The difficulty curve is just about right.  There's plenty of easy
levels before the brain mangling begins.

	The CD tracks on the intro and title screens are really good.
In-game music is only Amiga based, but the tunes are great.

	Although he's very small and not very colourful, your Tiny is 
nicely animated and moves well.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

	The in-game graphics are pretty dull; they'd look perfectly at 
home in a 512K A500 game 5 years ago.  It doesn't look like any more than
about 16 colours, definitely not 32bit CDROM stuff.  Static title and 
between-level screens are more colourful though.

	The game doesn't use the full PAL screen.  If you force it into 
NTSC using the boot-menu, it runs too fast.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

	If you liked The Lost Vikings, you'll like this.


BUGS

	I've found a couple of graphic glitches here and there, but they
don't affect gameplay at all.


VENDOR SUPPORT

	An address and phone/fax number are provided for support.  I 
haven't needed to contact them as yet.


WARRANTY

	Unknown.


CONCLUSIONS

	If you're looking to be blown off your seat with stunning visuals
and audio, don't buy this game, because there aren't any.  But do buy it 
if you want a game to *PLAY*, because it's got more playability and 
lastability than a lot of other stuff around.  An enjoyable blend of 
platforms, puzzles and general silliness.

	My rating : 80%

%% Music Modules                                     by @{" David Tiberio " link P8-4} %%

Next time your IBM PC friends or Macintosh friends play SoundTracker music
modules on their machines, remind them that it all started with the Amiga.
Of course all platforms have made an attempt at music production, but the
Amiga is the birth platform of music modules in the same way that the Mac
is the birth of QuickTime videos. The technology has been used elsewhere,
but the Amiga popularized it... and they have been riding in our wake.

I remember when I first heard a music module... it was back in 1991, more
than a year after I got my first Amiga 500. The first music module I ever
downloaded was called "Beat dis Paula". Today, the piano effects still
sound decent. But it has gone a long way. After I learned what music
modules were all about, I remembered the "drum" software on the C64. After
showing it to a good friend of mine, he came across the Michael Jackson
tune "Smooth Instrument", which was the highest quality mod we had ever
heard. But it has come a long way.

Looking through my hard drive, I have about 100 mods that I have saved 
over the years, after having gone through at least a thousand or more. 
The ones that I have saved tend to be fairly well known, such as those 
produced by u4ia or SideWinder. While I am currently seeking out new mods,
there are some that I do not know very well by name, so I will only list 
the ones that I have had for a while.

    1989
    Beyond Music
    Bomb Jazz                   - tint of jazz, very good
    Boom
    Das Boot                    - submarines and spys
    Guitar Slinger              - sounds just like the radio, "new age"
    Native Dance                - this won a music mod contest
    Nightmare                   - crude and distorted, but good
    No Limit                    - dance music
    Open Sesame                 - great dance tune
    Power Of American Natives   - can get long and tiring, but very good
    Space Debris                - one of my oldest favorites
    Street Jungle               - another of my oldest favorites
    Tribal Dance                - good dance music
    What Is Love                - just like the radio
    XTermin8                    - dance music


I also took the time to download most of the Sidewinder modules on Aminet.
One thing I must say; this guy knows how to mix modules! His samples are
of the highest quality, and contain a variety of effects. I would suggest
that you download certain modules first, such as the following:

    HouseBeatles                - "Beatles" classic
    RainyDecember               - jazzy piano love song
    RainySeptember              - jazz
    Spanish-Armada              - Spanish RAVE


Of course, you also need a program to play most music modules. Some music
modules have the player built into them, and are referred to as "self-
playing" modules. Since you will mostly come across data modules, I would
suggest the following players:

    DeliTracker                 - one of the most flexible players
    EdPlayer 2.1                - small, compact player for MOD and MED
    JukeBox                     - controls CD ROM drives with audio CD's
    ModuleMaster                - nice interface displays

Aminet, so here are some of the ones which were previously in the mod

Along comes a game in which simplicity creates hours of enjoyment.
The game being SubVersion v1.0. in which you are in command of the
submarine called the Nautilus, armed with nulcear torpedos and short
range anti-ship missiles. @{"(Picture of opening screen)" system "display.s 650 100 AR217_pic1.iff SubVersion"}

When you begin, you find yourself in an 18 by 22 kilometer area in the
Euclidean Strait facing anywhere from 10-40 destroyers and 4 opposing
submarines. Supporting you are supply ships which will refuel you as
well as rearm you.

Your mission:

Destroy all enemy ships.

Simple.

Oh yeah!? Starting the game you see a "game board" in which your
location and location of some of the ships that have already been
detected. You move around the "board" horizontally, vertically, or
diagonally.

On the side of the "game board" is the main control panel. Here
you will find everything you need to play the game.

Torpedos, HMS array system, Missiles, Status, Crew, Resupply, Depth,
Power, Engine, and Auxiliary controls. Which are accessable with the
mouse or with keyboard shortcuts.

Being outnumbered strategy plays an important role. The enemy ships
aren't always detected by the sonar array, enemy submarines are quite
difficult to detect. Adding to that, you have mines, which nicely sink
the enemy ships as well as you. Watch your supplies! You need to
balance your fuel between the missiles and the engines...and you need
enough fuel to get back to the supply ships. You can only be resupplied
twice.

A feature I liked is the abilty to use your crewmen as frogmen. You can
utilize the frogmen in close range encounters, and encounters in which
land is between you and the enemy. While they are a great asset, they
don't always get the mission accomplished, nor do they always survive
and return. Capture is possible.

The concept is remarkable simple, but winning is not.

 - THE PRIZE FOR NEXT MONTH -

    The Amiga Report contest is still going on, and it is not too
late to enter. This ongoing monthly contest allows Amiga Report
readers a chance to win software by either solving a puzzle or by
entering a random drawing.

    The prize this month is the Amiga/Toaster Reference Manual v2.221,
from Area52. This is a 1,000 page help system for the Amiga and Video
Toaster, covering the Workbench, AmigaDOS, Lightwave, and more ($34.95).

    The second prize choice is the FutureShock audio CDROM,  which was
produced using Amiga computers by SideWinder. There are some Sidewinder
music modules on Aminet that you may want to look at for a sample of
the audio CD ($12.95).

    All monthly contests end on the morning of the first of the
following month. Any entries beyond this date will be entered into the
next contest.


 - THE MONTHLY DRAWING -

    To enter the random drawing, select a number from 1 to 262,144
and send it to me at one of my addresses listed below, either by
the postal service or email through the Internet.
    Also, you may enter by solving the following puzzle. The winner
of this puzzle will be decided within the same time frame as the
random prize, to allow the contest information to filter through the
networks, and to allow your letters and postcards to come in.


 - THE PUZZLE -

    Since people complained that the first contest was too hard, and
that the second was too easy, I made one that anyone can solve with
a little thought. Once you get some of it decoded you will be able
to solve it with ease ::heh heh::!

        Decrypt the following encoded message: 17851 47932

        Each location in the code represents one character in the
    ASCII character set from A to Z. Also provide your method of
    obtaining the answer.


 - TO ENTER -

    To enter, simply let your fingers do the talking and type up an
email and send it to dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu. You MUST put
the word CONTEST in the subject line of the email header! Otherwise
you run the risk of having your email deleted (don't ask, it is a
long story!) or send a post card or letter to:

    Amiga Report Contest
    c/o David Tiberio
    6 Lodge Lane
    East Setauket, NY 11733

    Is it possible to win via snail mail? You might think that your
chances of winning are better by entering in email (much faster of
course), but last month's winner send in a letter that arrived the
day before his winning number was drawn!

    In your letter or email, please provide the following:

    Your full name and address. Please keep in mind that many of
you may have addresses that I am not accustomed to, so please include
your country or any other information that I would need in case you
win. An email address should also be included, if possible.

    You must also include a brief one sentence overview of the editorial
in this issue of AMiga Report. Just to make sure you are reading it. :)
You must also include the issue number. For example, if you read this in
AR213, then include that in your correspondance. Also, a prize winner
will be determined by a random number generator. Choose a number from
1 to 262,144. The closest winner or winners to the randomly generated
number will receive the prize in the mail. Anyone who does not provide
a number will have one assigned to him randomly.

    All prizes will be mailed within one week after I get my hands on
the published version of AmigaReport. I am doing this for a few reasons.
First, every winner so far has given the correct puzzle solution before
I have received the editon of AmigaReport that announced it. :)
Second, I don't like to go to the post office every day if I can avoid
it. Third, you never know when someone's power supply might blow up
(right Mr. Editor?!).


 - THE DISCLAIMER -

    DISCLAIMER: This contest is being provided as a service to the
    Amiga community and all persons involved in running this contest
    cannot be held liable for anything that costs you money or
    lifetime pain and anguish. Rules are subject to change. All entries
    must be received by April 30th, 1994. Any entries beyond this date
    will be entered into the next contest, if any.


 - THE CHANCE YOU WILL WIN -

    Odds of winning are approximately 1:50 for the random drawing and
1:15 for the correct answer to the puzzle, based upon current entries.

    SPECIAL THANKS to SideWinder for donating the Future Shock albums
for inclusion in our contest, along with Merrill Callaway for his ARexx
Reference Disk!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

PLEASE NOTE:  My E-Mail address has changed.  Sorry for the inconvenience,
but it's my excuse for being unreachable for a while.

Ok, the day has come where I'll sum it all up and give you my final 
comments on both of the color multitasking Mac emulators.  Again, thanks 
to both ReadySoft and Utilities Unlimited for providing, respectively, the
A-Max IV and the Emplant.

Now, to explain the ratings:
In each category, I have selected the emulator that performed better.
It is rated 100% in that category.
THIS DOES NOT MEAN IT IS PERFECT IN THAT RESPECT.
It simply means that it has the best support of that feature available.

To begin:

Overall software compatibility:
Emplant: 100%
A-Max IV:  90%

I can't blame the A-Max for much, although the repeated complaints
about SoundMaster got to be too much for me.  Once Emplant hit the
high version 3 series, most incompatibility bugs were ironed out.
Emplant also handled lousy Mac code (like, programs intended for
pre-Multifinder environments) better...for example, the game Star
Wars.

Multitasking:
A-Max IV: 100%
Emplant: 85%

The Emplant frequently dies when I try to access Amiga serial through
an Amiga program, even if the serial port isn't given over to Emplant.
It's not just me and it's not just Terminus, either.  Aside from that, 
both operate along a similar concept, although Emplant uses a more
conventional screen and does not require a non-standard method of
flipping to it.  Both are well-behaved when it comes to the user not
wanting system time allocated to the emulation.

Floppy dIsk support:
A-Max IV: 100%
Emplant: 75%

The A-Max IV has built-in 720k floppy support.  It's a bit roundabout
and requires you to read the entire disk into an AmigaDOS file which
will be treated as a virtual drive until you copy everything somewhere
better, but it exists and works.  UU is selling Macdrive adapters, but
that requires a Macdrive.  I also encountered some disks which
Emplant would consider fine but real Macs would feel were damaged.
This WAS before multi-os.device and the like, but it's worth mentioning.

Video support:
Emplant: 100%
A-Max IV: 85%

This was a toughie.  Emplant supports more boards, but many are ones
that quite frankly not too many people have.  With the recent QD modules
and the fact that the Emplant DOES do a quicker job of ECS video,
the choice goes to them.  It is worth mentioning that A-Max IV supports
the Picasso and Retina in the included software, two of the more
popular boards, and has supported multi-monitor work for a long time.

Ease of Use:
A-Max IV: 100%
Emplant: 80%

Big minus points to the Emplant for its memory remap program.  It
makes many system-incompliant programs very unhappy.  A-Max's
does not need to be taken out nearly as often.  A-Max's interface
is also a bit more straightforward on the Amiga side.

Sharing Amiga Devices
A-Max IV: 100%
Emplant:  100%

No complaints here for either board.

Value for Money:
Emplant: 100%
A-Max IV:  93%

Tough, tough, tough.  Were it not for the fact that the Emplant now
supports the crusty old 1.1 and 1.2 ROMs, this would be A-Max's
category.  As it is, though, the Emplant does give you a SCSI
controller (not the greatest one in the world, but...) if you go with the
Deluxe, which is rather reasonably priced.  I've seen a dealer carrying
them at $330, which is amazing.  Both offer the Mac serial ports,
shareable from the Amiga side.  A-Max IV does offer MIDI, but
I regretfully couldn't test that bit.  Emplant wins here, but it's close.

Sound Support:
A-Max IV: 100%
Emplant: 95%

Were it not for the SoundMaster thing, A-Max would have won by more.
It simply slows down less when playing MODs.

The conclusion is up to you.  BOTH boards are quality items and I would
recommend a different board to different people.  Someone who would
be dealing with lots of Mac software would want A-Max IV or to track
down a Macdrive and the AMIA interface from UU, but the A-Max has
it built in.  If you've got a lot of video to do, especially on a board 
A-Max doesn't support, you go with the Emplant.  If you've got a 4000 and
no SCSI controller, go Emplant.  If you want MIDI, go A-Max.

Hopefully, I've given enough information over the last few months to
help everyone reach the conclusion they need about the boards.
It's been a lot of fun.

I'll return with some spot reviews if I ever get Photoshop running...
maybe when one of those 24-bit companies finally sends me
something.

Keep the emulators warm.

CIX (Compulink Information eXchange) is an online community of about
15-20k users (we call ourselves cixen) of all kinds.  I'm not sure of the
exact figure but it's in this region.  The main attraction of CIX is the
conferencing facilities.  Conferences range from the obvious computer
issues to everything from cooking, gardening, television and films and
anything else you can think of.  If you happen to be a llama breeder and
can't find a conf that caters for your needs then you just start up your
own conf and get your fellow llama breeders to join in. :)  CIX admin
don't interfere with the creation of new conferences and won't say no
unless you are breaking the law in some way. :)

Just about every computer that has seen the light of day has a conference
dedicated to it.  If it's a *really* obscure machine then it will probably
be discussed in the cultmachines or obsolete conferences. :)

The Amiga areas on CIX are pretty lively at the moment because of C='s
current problems.  There's a lot of discussion, argument and flaming.
Everyone has a view of what went wrong and how to put it right.  And
everyone's right of course! ;-)

Here's a quick list of some Amiga related conferences:

 alt.alt.amiga  For people too offbeat to be accepted in alt.amiga
 alt.amiga      For interesting people only.
 amidemos       For Amiga Demo Programmers
 amiga          Commodore Amiga Conference.
 amiga.24bitgra Extended graphics for the Amiga
 amiga.com      Amiga Commercial Developers forum.
 amigamods      For ALL amiga music freaks
 amreport       AMReport International - Amiga OnLine magazine
 gtb            Discussion of GadToolBox and Amiga Gadget Creation
 ttx            For users of Turbotext on the Amiga
 amiga_fidonet  The Amiga and Fidonet
 pcvamiga       Which is better? The argument rages...
 amiga_dtp      Area to discuss Amiga DTP and download Amiga Clip-art
 amiga-3d       All about Amiga 3d packages
 opalvision     chat and files from Opal tech's 24 bit card
 digita         Digita International, Product support
 amiga_user     The Conference for readers of Amiga User International
 amigashopper   For readers of Amiga Shopper magazine
 cuamiga        The conference dedicated to the fastest growing UK Amiga mag
 jam            Just Amiga Monthly feedback, discussion and contributions.


There are plenty of others. ;-)  Each of these conferences is divided up
into topics for holding files or for talk on a specific subject.

I hope this gives you an idea of what CIX is about.  The Amiga community on
CIX is pretty large and very vocal.  All the UK Amiga magazines are
represented in some way and there are plenty of Amiga developers.  We even
have the honour of having representatives from CATS-US and CBM-UK popping
in every now and again.

                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

  Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

  The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software, online.

  Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

  Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES.

  35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

  No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

  Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

  Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

  Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

  FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
  Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  

  Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

  The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
  Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
  All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

  Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

  And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

  UNIX "telnet" program from an account you may already
  have on an Internet-connected system. 
% 9600 bps Sprintnet in over 300 cities areas
+ $10 rate prevails at smaller US Cities
# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

/// BIX - Byte Information Exchange             Lots of information!
    -------------------------------



BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and enthusiasts.
While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is the place for 
knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  You're likely 
to find many others in similar situations who can offer advice, give 
technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.


                       *** FULL INTERNET ACCESS! ***

BIX features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription. 


                      ==============================
                      Rates and Connect Information:
                      ==============================


BIX membership costs $13 per month, plus connect time.  There are several 
different ways to connect:

SprintNet*              $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet:**               $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
(SprintNet and Tyment rates shown are for 48 contiguous US states only.)
                                                        
Tymnet Canada:          $4/hr eves/wkends           $9/hour weekdays

and includes the first 20 hours of access by any combination of methods 
from the contiguous United States.  Additional use is $1.80 per hour 
(additional use for telnet access is $1 an hour).  The 20/20 Plan's cost is 
in addition to the $13 monthly fee.  


                           INTERNATIONAL USERS:

If you wish to connect internationally through Tymnet or SprintNet, 
please contact your local PTT.  BIX accepts prepaid international calls,
direct dial, or telnet connections.  In order to make a "collect" (not 
prepaid) call to BIX, your account must be verified before the charges 
are accepted.  When you complete the registration, we'll mail you a BIX
Membership Agreement by regular US Mail.  Whe you receive it, sign it 
and return it to us by mail.  When we receive it here, we'll authorize
your account to make reverse charged calls.

If you want to access BIX right away, contact your local PTT to set up a 
prepaid account.  You'll pay your local carrier for your calls to BIX in
advance, so there's no waiting period or verfication needed. Or, connect 
at BIX via telnet to x25.bix.com.

SprintNet international calls from most locations are $24 an hour.
Tymnet international charges vary, but are generally between $20-$30 an hour.


                           ====================
                           Billing Information: 
                           ====================

     Editor.Gadget

VERSION

     1.0

AUTHOR

     Email: mthomas@cs.utexas.edu

     Smail: 1515 Royal Crest Dr. #3259
            Austin, TX  78741

DESCRIPTION

     The editor.gadget is a BOOPSI gadget for text entry,
     supporting multiple lines, borders, two cursor types,
     an optional notepad look, font setting, style setting,
     and much more.

     A programmer who is familiar with BOOPSI can use this
     gadget by simply creating an instance and then adding
     the gadget instance to a window's gadget list.  All
     text editing is then handled by the gadget.  When the
     programmer needs the text in the gadget, he/she can just
     read the text in.  When the gadget is no longer needed
     it can be deleted.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     The gadget requires OS 2.04 and up.  From the user's
     standpoint, for OS 2.04 and 2.1 the gadget must
     be placed in a drawer where the application that uses
     it exists, and for OS 3.0 and up the gadget can be
     installed in SYS:Classes/Gadgets.

HOST NAME

     It is available on Aminet.  Aminet's main site is
     ftp.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4).

DIRECTORY

     /pub/aminet/dev/gui

FILE NAME

     editorgadget.lha

PRICE

     I do not require a fee to be paid by end users of the
     gadget, but the programs that use the gadget may require
     paying a fee of some sort, which should be directed to
     the author of that software, not me.

     The cost for using this gadget in a program is that I
     get a copy of the software package it is used in, at no
     cost to me.  The purpose of this requirement is that
     I will be able to evaluate future needs of the gadget.
     Also, there should be mention of the gadget and author
     in the programs and documentation of the programs that
     use the gadget.  In programs you can drop a short line
     in the About requester: editor.gadget by Mark Thomas.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     The archive may be distributed only in its entirety to
     anywhere, such as ftp sites, a BBS, or a disk collection
     such as Fish disks.

     The editor.gadget file itself, and portions of the
     documentation pertaining to editor keyboard sequences
     can be distributed with software packages that use the
     gadget.

     In light of the fact that I give people the right to
     copy the archive and certain files, I can't actually
     retain a "copy" right, so therefore I am retaining the
     maintenance right (not recognized by law I'm sure).
     This right gives me the exclusive ability to make
     modifications to the files in the archive.

OTHER

     Please send any bug reports or suggestions to me.  There
     is a fully working example program that uses the gadget
     in the archive.

     Enjoy!

TITLE

     QuickTools 

VERSION

    Release 1.1 (05 May 94)

COMPANY

     Ultima Thule Software

AUTHOR

     Eivind Nordseth      Email: eivindno@idt.unit.no

DESCRIPTION

     QuickTools  is the tool package for the harddisk owner
     who is tired of writing long pathnames when changing
     directories and who doesn't have the time to search
     for files manually. QuickTools consists mainly of four
     small utilities and a library where the search
     routines are. All search routines support standard
     AmigaDOS wildcards.

     Qcd:
     With this you can change directory by only writing
     enough of the directory name to identify it. The
     directory can be anywhere on the harddisk. If more 
     than one directory maches the search word a requester
     will pop up and you can select the directory you want
     to change to.

     If  you  want  to  change  to  a  directory  with  the
Path: NOT-FOR-MAIL

     It's several ways to do it: You can write: 
     'Qcd Harddisk0:Work/SAS/SelfMade/QuickCD' (the hard way)
     Or just: 'Qcd qui'   (the fast way)

     QFind:
     Search for files, scans through the database in just a 
     few seconds.

     QPop:
     A commodity for file and directory searching.

     QMan:
     A documentation finding utility which uses the database 
     to locate the documentation file for a specified program.
     The file found can be shown with a configurable viewer. 
     These programs are a must for any serious hard-disk user!!
                                    
NEW FEATURES

     Brief summary of news and fixes for Release 1.1:
     o Default arguments for most commands can be put in 
       envirorment variables.
     o QCD opens selection requester on the active public 
       screen if possible.
     o Posiblilites to disable the selection requester in QCD.
     o GetQInfo has got a number of new parameters: OLDERTHAN, 
       DELAY, SAVEREQUEST, EXCLUDEDIR, EXCLUDEFILE.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Requires an Amiga with OS compatible with Workbench
     2.04. A harddisk is also nice to have :-)

TITLE

     Beginner's Guide to Amiga E

VERSION

     Edition 1.0.  Covers the latest (PD) version 2.1b of Amiga E.

AUTHOR

     Jason R. Hulance <jason@fsel.com> (or <m88jrh@ecs.ox.ac.uk>).

DESCRIPTION

     This Guide is intended to be complementary to the existing Amiga
     E documentation, and it is aimed at the beginner, rather than the
     more experienced programmer.  Amiga E is (currently) an Amiga
     specific programmming language, designed and implemented by
     Wouter van Oortmerssen.  It has become quite popular due to,
     amongst other things, its amazingly fast compilation speed and
     its similarity to C and Modula-2.

     The Guide is divided into three main parts: the first assumes
     very little knowledge of programming and progresses through the
     second to describe all aspects of the Amiga E language.  The
     third part is dedicated to some illustrative examples.
     Experienced programmers (who are new to Amiga E) may find the
     second part useful for learning the language, especially if read
     in conjunction with Wouter's documentation.

     The topics covered in Part One include procedures, variables and
     expressions.  Part Two builds on this, describing the type system
     (including the list and string types), quoted expressions,
     built-in functions, modules, exceptions and recursion.

     The Guide may also be used as a quick reference, since it
     includes both a language and a concept index.  The concept index
     is pretty exhaustive.  The language index covers all the language
     keywords and built-in functions, constants and variables.

     There are two forms of the Guide included in the archive: an
     AmigaGuide(R), hypertext version and an ANSI text version.  (The
     latter is the more suitable for printing, using standard Amiga
     printer drivers.)  Other forms are available (such as a more
     AmigaGuide-v34 friendly version) from the author (see below).

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     To get the most from this you need the Amiga E package,
     obviously.  The current version is v2.1b and is Public Domain.
     You can find it in, for instance, the dev/e directory on any
     Aminet site.  If you don't already have a copy, try it: you might
     be very surprised.

     There is a text version of the Guide in the archive, so you don't
     need to use a hypertext viewer, but it is preferable.

HOST NAME

     Aminet.  For example, ftp.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1) in the UK.

DIRECTORY

     /pub/aminet/dev/e

FILE NAMES

     BeginnersGuide.lzh (200Kbytes)

PRICE

     Free.  A more AmigaGuide-v34 friendly version is also available,
     but separately from the author (to keep the archive size down).
     Also, a TeX dvi and a PostScript version are available for a
     small cost (five UK pounds).  They don't contain anything more,
     but are much nicer for printing (the cross references and
     indexes, especially).

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     The archive is freely distributable so long as it is complete and
     unaltered.  All versions of the Guide are Copyright (c) 1994,
     Jason R. Hulance.

OTHER

     Amiga E v3.0 is due out sometime soon.  Wouter has been doing a
     grand job extending and improving the language.  There are a lot
     of really exciting new features.  This Guide will hopefully be
     completely revised to cover the new version.  You, the reader,
     are strongly encouraged to help me improve it by sending me your
     criticisms.
