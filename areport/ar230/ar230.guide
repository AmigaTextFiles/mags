First off: Big changes for Amiga Report!  The demonic listserv from Hell
is no more, replaced by a manual Terminus script.  This means that if you
have any list requests, they've got to be mailed to me and processed.
It'll take a bit longer this way, but hopefully only one copy of each
issue will be mailed.

Second: as you may have noticed by now, Amiga Report got a facelift.  Tell
us what you think.  Blame @{" Katie Nelson " link P8-5}, the changes were
her idea.  :) (I personally like it.) 

Another week, another conference...

The third in a series of Amiga Report online conferences was held this past
Wednesday on Delphi, with Alex Amor from CEI returning to answer questions.

Now, to once again answer an accusation.

Commodore UK's management has, REPEATEDLY, been invited to conferences.
They have been given my home number with a 24-hour invitation to call.
Sharon McGuffie, a specialist at C= UK, has bothered Pleasance and
Proudfoot on my account more than once with my invitation to online
conferences.  So far, they have not given her an answer to the invitations.
Either yes or no.  The minute they say yes, I'll scramble to get them
airtime.  I'm sure Portal, BIX, and Delphi will be ready to go as well.
I'll say it again: I'm not trying to keep news from people.  On the
contrary, I'm trying to get as much as possible.  When I find something out
(the Chinese financial backing of the MBO), people accuse me of favoring
CEI...presumably they think I'm making it up.  I'm not.  I got it verified
through as many sources as possible: it's not possible at present to verify
it with Commodore UK because of reasons I just explained.

A number of people have asked for conferences on IRC.  I personally think
the instability of IRC combined with the relative difficulty in moderating
a conference would make it impractical, but I will try to get both parties
to consider dropping by sometime.

To condense information that can be found fragmented in the conference,
here's the bidding update: The bidding is now in a public phase. 
Essentially, all interested parties will get together in a building in
early to mid November, sit in separate rooms, and bid until it hurts.  It
seems there is NOT a "final bid" for any specific party, either CEI or C=
UK, despite reports to the contrary.  The final bid would seem to be the
bidder who isn't challenged by the other parties.

A contract HAS been written based on Commodore UK's bid.  This was done at
the request of the highest bidder, CEI.  They took this tactic at the
advice of their lawyers in order to protect the value of their own bid. 
The strategy is known as "Stalking Horse" bidding, and is designed to put
other parties at a disadvantage: Nobody knows how high the stalking horse
was willing to go in the private phase, so it makes it that much more
difficult to figure out how high they will go publicly.

Anybody, including myself, can now bid against the contract bid.  However,
I haven't sold enough floor scrubbers to make my bid viable.

That being said...enjoy the magazine.

From: Johan Van Houtven (vanhoutv@nbre.nfe.be)
-----

Here are my coments about some of the things that were said on the recent
CEI Conference on Portal.

1) Alex Armor said nothing really important that I (we ?) didn't already
know.  Not that I blame him for this.  Maybe there was nothing more to
tell.  And it wouldn't be very wise for him to tell us things that his
competitors would also like to know, would it?  :)

"CEI-Alex: [...] a German concern [...] "

Why didn't Alex name the "German concern"?  ESCOM.  Does Alex know what he
is up against?

Here are some loose thoughts about ESCOM:

Does Alex know that Scala might be 'behind' (can't find the right word,
sorry) ESCOM's bid?

Some ex-C= managers are now working for ESCOM.  In Holland you have 'Mr.
Van Thienen' (sp?), in Belgium you have 'Mr.  De Waegeneire' (sp?).

You can see Scala's InfoChannel running in several Escom shops in Holland.

I have heard that ESCOM is determined to outbid every bid from David
Pleasance.

Scala needs the Amiga, at least for a while, to sell InfoChannel systems. 
Scala has most of the ex-C= engineers.  Do I need to remind anybody of
that?

2) It were the remarks of some Ex-Commodore engineers that made the
conference most interesting, IMHO.

Dave Haynie:

   I just had a question or two to call on the AAA vs.  RISC issue.  One
might wonder if the current engineers' recommendations against AAA is based
on the fact that no one involved with AAA is actually left at C=, rather
than its suitability versus a RISC project that is [a] not Amiga compatible
in the least, and [b] not yet in silicon.  The RISC project certainly makes
a better CD32.  I don't necessarily believe it makes a better A4000, at
least not yet.

My thoughts:

DaveH works for Scala.  Scala needs Amiga's.  Scala would like to have AAA
systems (today).  :) Scala fears that if DavidP or CEI have it their way,
there will never be an AAA system.

Isn't it all rather obvious?  Even the (ex) engineers know there is a
market?  :) Scala knows.  And ESCOM has has a distribution channel, they
have their own dealer network (PC-oriented I might add).  They have
marketing muscle.


    - Mr. Houtven also expressed the idea that Scala was in support of
    Escom.  Dave Haynie and Scala in the US have both publicly (according
    to Dave) expressed their support for CEI in this matter. 
    I haven't been in contact with Escom to hear what they have to say, but
    I recently obtained contact info and will be trying...

                                 IPISA'94

 Incontro dei Programmatori Italiani per lo Sviluppo Amiga Fourth Edition

                        Saturday, November 19 1994

                               Milano, Italy

The Italian Amiga community will meet on November 19th, 1994, at the fourth
annual IPISA conference.  IPISA stands for Incontro dei Programmatori
Italiani per lo Sviluppo su Amiga (Italian Programmers' Meeting for Amiga
Development).

IPISA is an open meeting (advance registration is required for a small fee)
focussing on non-commercial products, projects and ideas, and on the
distribution of high-quality information and advanced software tools.

It is also a chance for (usually isolated) novice users to talk each other
and to consult qualified and experienced Amiga users.  IPISA is (and has
been) a valuable occasion for small Italian enterprises working with the
Amiga to do some head-hunting and to arrange professional talks with
usually unreachable people, such as magazines chief editors and
journalists, freelance programmers, etc.

In the past, IPISA was an opportunity for Commodore Italia to introduce new
products (the MPEG card at IPISA'93 was a hit) and to answer questions on
its policies.  Commodore Italia has always supported the IPISA conference
by helping in the organization phase, by giving computers and sample
products, and by participating in the conference through its
representatives.


About past IPISA conferences

As we said, this is the fourth conference; the first and second ones were
held in Modena and were organized by three former Amiga developers.  Even
without press coverage, the conferences attracted 90 participants.

For the 1993 conference, the organization was taken over by a large group
of developers and users living in Milan.  With the help of Amiga-specific
magazines, FidoNet Amiga chat groups, Commodore developer support (Mr.
Ettore Caurla) and fellow Amiga users who helped to "spread the word", the
last conference was attended by over 150 people from all over Italy (even
from Sicily, which is one full day of travel away).

During the conference, relators talked about their works (mainly software
programs, hardware projects, etc.), and Mr.  Caurla described the terms and
conditions for becoming a registered Amiga developer.  He also answered
many questions from users and the developer community.

In the end, an impressive demo of CD32's MPEG card and CD32 games was
shown.  IPISA'93 was covered in depth by several Amiga-specific magazines,
and reviewed by Italy's most influential computer magazine: MC
Microcomputer.  All reviews were entusiastic and labeled the organization
"ottimo" (very good).


About this year's conference

The team organizing the IPISA'94 is composed of fifteen people: Roberto
Attias, Vittorio Calzolari, Marco Caimi, Federica Colla, Alessandro
Ferrarin, Giovanni Gentile, Fabrizio Lodi, Marco Menegon, Sergio Ruocco
(chair), Carlo Santagostino, Paolo Silvera, Reinhard Spisser, Carlo
Todeschini, Sebastiano Vigna and Marco Zandonadi.

All of them are long time Amiga users.  Some are (or have been) freelance
authors for Amiga-specific magazines for years.  Many of them are working
(or have worked) as programmers, artists or qualified technicians for
Italian companies setting up a number of commercial Amiga-based multimedia
projects.

This year, IPISA'94 will be held Saturday November 19, 1994, in the
Conference Hall of the Centro Universitario ISU (via Valvassori Peroni 21
Milano); the hall is in the Northwest zone of the city, also known as
Citta` Studi, where the Politecnico di Milano and many scientific
departments of Universita` Statale di Milano are located.


The tentative schedule is:

  9:00 AM - 10:00 AM            Registration
 10:00 AM - 10:30 AM            Presentation and foreword
 10:30 AM - 12:30 PM            Conference talks (part 1)
 12:30 PM - 02:00 PM            Meal / Lunch break (see note)

       Conference with our special guest of Creative Equipment,
       International.  Also joining us tonight is Jason Compton, Editor in
       Chief, Amiga Report With special thanks also to him for his help in
       setting up tonights conferance.  Since this is a formal session, we
       ask that participants wishing to ask a question, to type a "?" and
       wait to be called on before typing your question.

.jcompton> Ok.  First off, Alex, you can take this opportunity to give any
           sort of introductory info on yourself or CEI.  Secondly, I think
           everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) would appreciate some sort of
           brief overview of the bidding process to come.

AMIGA_ALEX> As all of you probably know CEI is on of the parties that is
            interested in acquiring the Commodore technology and produce
            Amigas.  Currently, there appears to be two interested parties
            (notice the word appears), I believe one is a Chinese venture
            that is backing the UK management team and the second is
            ourselves.  Within the next four weeks the trustee will
            negotiate contracts with the interested parties and actual
            bidding will progress.

            We expect a resolution sometime in late November.  There is
            always the possibility of another party coming to the table
            before this is all done.

.jcompton> :)  Is it your interpretation, then, that Escom has lost
           interest in the bidding?  Also: I realize it's not up to you,
           but do you know why there's going to be a month lag before the
           bidding begins?

AMIGA_ALEX> At this point in time I would not rule ESCOM out.  Remember
            there is a lot of activity behind the scenes.  As far as the
            time frame is concerned there are a number of legal issues
            which must be resolved. Including law suits, appeals, etc.

BRIANKOK> Alex, thanks for doing this. I actually have several questions:
          (most importantly, first)

          You said you are interested in purchasing the amiga technology
          and producing them. Does this mean you are not actually buying
          out Commodore, just buying the technology?

AMIGA_ALEX> Yes, who ever ends up with the Amiga technology is simply
            purchasing the assets. Not ending up with the old Commodore.

BRIANKOK> Ah, i see. i thought this was a "race" to be appointed to the
          pres., co pres., etc.
 
AMIGA_ALEX> Our plan is to form a lean marketing/engineering firm that
            designs, market, and sells Amigas.


INZANE> I was wondering if you could explain your future plans for the
        Amiga if you win the bid.

AMIGA_ALEX> As you can see I am not a touch typist, but I'll try to give
            you a synopsis:

            1. Re introduce the current Amigas.  At lower prices if
               possible.
            2. Move the technology forward by having engineers work on new
               OS and new RISC chips.
            3. Concentrate on markets which we can dominate; multimedia,
               home entertainment desktop video, etc.
            4. Market...Market....Market.... let people know why the Amiga
               is such a good choice.

            I always believed the Amiga would get wider acceptance If more
            people just saw the machine. That's the basic nuts and bolts.

FERRIERM> Thanks. Three short questions.  First, there have been several
          bidding 'deadlines' over the last five month. And yet new
          parties are still accepted? What gives?

          Also, How does the Christmas season look for CD32? Is this season
          not very important to the new owners? And, what are your plans
          for the much larger British and European markets?

AMIGA_ALEX> First, there really haven't been an official deadline.  When it
            comes to C= rumors seem to gain momentum and there is not
            stopping them.  I remember that all the BBSs had the
            information that Samsung had bought C= and an announcement was
            imminent.  It does not look possible that we will be able to
            make the Christmas Season with any Amiga products.  Our
            business plans fully take this into account based on our
            projections expect to see machines in late Feb 95.

            As the European market we are in constant contact with all the
            major European retailers and distributors.  They have agreed to
            assist whoever is successful with this venture.  I fully
            understand the importance of Europe and have been working
            to overcome our distance barrier.  CEI will open offices in UK
            and Germany.

.jcompton> This is being passed along from a developer: Will you
           re-evaluate the way developer support is handled?  As he put it:
           "$100/year isn't bad, but all you basically got was BIX, and
           lately that hasn't been much."

AMIGA_ALEX> Oh no not Jason Again :)

            Developer support is crucial to our success.  We plan multiple
            developers conference around the world as well as joint
            marketing strategies.  Bundling software, third party coupons,
            real support!

ADAMGOOD> Do do you think that the amiga developers that are still around
          can hold out untill feb 95

AMIGA_ALEX> Yes, once they understand the direction of the new company, the
            market is strong and there is demand.  Newtek, Scala, GVP
            should all be there and profit.

ADAMGOOD> What about cross platform support? windows? mac?

AMIGA_ALEX> If you know anything about CEI its that we believe in support
            for cross platfom support.  We introduced the 4000MC which
            included the Emplant (no association to McDonalds).  As future
            processors come into play the ability to integrate cross
            platform support will become easier.

RUSTYW> In past statements from the UK group, they are (where) hoping to
        get something going in time for Xmas, Since this will not happen do
        you think this will the blow to out of the bidding? (I hope)

AMIGA_ALEX> No, I dont believe that.  The Amiga market makes good business
            sense, if you understand the market.

BRIANKOK> One of my questions was answered. (Developer support.) An
          offshoot question: Will efforts to get developers to develop
          again be aggressive? (e.g., MicroSoft and MSWord).

          Another: Will the immediate development focus upon the hardware
          or the OS?

AMIGA_ALEX> Commodore had a very closed mind... In order to garner support
            from outside the Amiga community these companies have to
            realize the potential.  With the very competitive software
            market many software developers are looking for new
            opportunities.  If we manage to build relationships with these
            companies the likelyhood of support will increase.  If there is
            important software the new entity will of course do whatever
            possible to get them ported including $$$$$$$$.

INZANE> Getting back to the future of the OS. I know that RTG,Networking,
        and memory protection are important features, but I think we also
        have to address the look and feel of the OS.  I've seen pitures of
        WINDOWS `95 and some of it looks very nice. Any plans on this
        subject?

AMIGA_ALEX> Our OS has very strong features.  We plan on upgrading and
            improving system as well as porting to other processors.  As
            the looks are concern we have been analysing the look and feel
            of other systems including Windows 95, SGI, etc.  If we can
            improve the look of the system while mentaining the memory
            advantage as well the multitasking advantage we have the
            potential for a real winner.

ADAMGOOD> I don't know anything about cei, what is the 4000mc?

AMIGA_ALEX> CEI = Creative Equipment International. Most end users have not
            heard of us.  Our goal was supplying the dealers and
            establishing a dealer network for Commodore.  We signed up over
            four hundred dealers in the last year alone.

            The 4000MC was a stock Amiga 4000 with the Emplant, extra ram,
            large hard drive, System 7 and MacRoms fully integrated and
            ready to run both AmigaDos and System 7 out of the box.

            By the way we started as a Commodore PET dealer in 1977 and
            only sold Commodore products for the past 17 years.

RUSTYW> When the Trustee(s) look at the bids, are they just looking for the
        highest $$$ amount or the plan that will yield the highest $$$ in
        the long run?

AMIGA_ALEX> The job of the trustee is to get the most money for the
            creditors, NOW!

RUSTYW> If CEI wins the rights to Amiga, and is successful in marketing,
        do you think other developers that have stopped or never developed
        for Amiga, will be attracted to develop for Amiga?

AMIGA_ALEX> RustyW, if we do our jobs correctly with a little support from
            the Amiga community I think we can get developers back and
            acquire new developers. These guys are looking for the
            opportunity to make a buck and the Amiga and its users provide
            that opportunity.

.Wizardess> In case someone has not asked already - what was the winning
            bid and are the other bids known?

AMIGA_ALEX> There is no winning bid at this time.  The actual bid process
            (auction) will come later in early to mid Nov.

INZANE> IS there a way people could send in our sugestions for feature we
        would like to see in the future OS. I know someone on DELPHI was
        keeping a list?

AMIGA_ALEX> ABSOLUTELY, our plans include a user advisory panel in the US
            and Europe.  This panel reports directly to the board.

ADAMGOOD> You mentioned RISC earlier? Any plans to use PowerPC? Licence
          the Mac os?


AMIGA_ALEX> It's obvious that we need to move to RISC technology sooner
            than later.  The two RISC that have attracted the most
            attention is the PA RISC and the PowerPC, but this decision 
            will be made by engineers, software designers, and you the
            customers.  Since we believe in full cross platform
            compatibility the option of licensing the Mac System is not
            unrealistic.  Cost would be the determining factor.

.jcompton> (Yes, AGAIN, Alex. :)) Can you please explain the "contract bid"
           situation to us?  As you know, the report that Commodore UK has
           the contract bid has been blown across the net and is being
           interpreted incorrectly.

AMIGA_ALEX> Without going into great detail. The trustee has the ability to
            negotiate on contracts with multiple parties simultanously.

            Additionally, any bidder can bid on another parties contract.
            For this reason signing a contract at this stage of the games
            makes for good PR but little else.  We had the option of
            agreeing on a contract but turn it down for tactical reasons
            I'd rather not discuss here.  The bottom line is bidding for
            Commodore has not commenced yet.

BRIANKOK> Alex, what are you looking at for price/performace ratios for new
          machines? (Can you give us specific CPUs/prices?)

AMIGA_ALEX> NO, way too early.  But, I can tell you that we understand the
            market pressure when you can go out an purchase a Pentium
            machine for under 2k.

            Our goals are to bring the price in line and make Amiga
            attractive once again.

FERRIERM> Is there still a chance that the bidding process will move to the
          US? If so, what would the consequences be? Also, would a
          Windows compatible machine be possible in the next year?

          How about an OS/board combination for Intel or PPC based systems?

AMIGA_ALEX> Anything is possible, but at this late stage it seems
            improbable that the court proceeding be moved.  An Windows
            compatible machine would certaintly open up a new market but
            bringing in within the next year might be technologically
            impossible.

            The Amiga OS and chips make it very attractive as an add on
            board for PCs.  As we work closer with the engineers we will be
            able to make better determinations.

TREYE> As a developer, I am wondering where the Amiga will fit
       into the ODBC, SQL Server, OrACLE, ETC. world?

AMIGA_ALEX> Let's face it, the Amiga is strong in digital desktop video,
            interactive applications, home entertainment, etc.  This does
            not preclude the need for strong mainstream applications 
            (Databases, Spreadsheets, etc.) But, we need to capitilize on
            the strenght of the technology.

            Since we operate CEI on 30 network Amigas, there is no one in
            the world who would like to see strong business software
            (read Relational Database with file locking....).

JVANHOUTEN> Are you plannning on having packages with monitor
            harddrive/cdrom??

AMIGA_ALEX> YES! We have a multimedia machine, don't you think everyone
            should have a CD ROM  :)

.Wizardess> Once the dust settles have you any idea how long it will be
            before the "kiosk" makers can get the CD-32s I hear them so
            plaintively asking for? And how quickly can you ramp up general
            production?

AMIGA_ALEX> Once a contract is in place and the legal matters are out of
            the way expect 60 to 90 days before the entire product line is
            once again available.

XIS> When do you believe I will be able to get a 4000 tower system?

AMIGA_ALEX> Same time frame (late Feb).

.jcompton> Alex: What, theoretically, happens to the few remaining
           Commodore branches if you are successful?  Do you ask them to
           join the gang, or just let them rot and liquidate? GA

AMIGA_ALEX> Jason, our bid emcompasses the branches of Commodore which are
            do not have great liability.  This will be brought into the
            fold of the new company.

AMIGA_ALEX> Additionally, we have contacted individuals of the former C=
            who were valuable employees but were limited by their
            management.  We now get to chose the cream of the crop and
            possibly even purchase a new floor scrubber:) he he

.jcompton> Thank you, Alex.  You beat me to the gratuitous floor scrubber
           comment of the night.  Don't worry, I'll get one in.

TREYE> 2 more quick questions: 

       1) The Amiga is a perfect machine for professional Laser Shows. 
          Do you see this as a target for the machine?

       2) What happend to those people whe have own(ed)
          stock in Amiga???

AMIGA_ALEX> First, the AMiga controls a large portion of the laser
            industry. I see this a another niche market which makes sense.
            We personally installed a laser system in the Miami area.

            The individuals who purchased Commodore stock are simply out of
            luck.  Add me to that list.

RUSTYW> Do you for see offering trade up deals for A500 and A2000 owners?
        and is there plans to add Amiga tech to that floor scrubber? :)

AMIGA_ALEX> ABSOLUTELY!  The one thing C= did well were the trade up
            programs.  We plan on being more agressive with our customer
            base.  Jason will be in charge of floor scrubber tech support;)

BRIANKOK> Last ? from me: Why should the ppl who are deciding the fate of
          the Amiga choose you over CBM UK?

AMIGA_ALEX> $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

BRIANKOK> heheh

XIS> Seems to me Amiga OS on a PC Card would elimanate Amiga computers...
     wouldn't it be better to get the dos users to buy an Amiga/emplant
     combination?

AMIGA_ALEX> NO not at all.  I think its the old Trojan horse.  Show what
            the Amiga can do and then try to go back.

.Mark> If I can jump i here...  How about a PCMCIA card with the Amiga
       Chips on it..  It would solve your laptop problem!

AMIGA_ALEX> Good question.  I'm afraid I dont have enough (read any)
            engineering background to answer that.  As far as a laptop
            Amiga plans are in the works to co-engineer desktop and laptop
            models.

.Del> When are we going to see ads that play up the qualities of the Amiga
      line against the limitations of the MS-DOS platform?  I've seen it
      put this way: 'It takes more than a CD and a cute pair of speakers to
      do good multimedia!'

AMIGA_ALEX> Our investors have allocated substantial funds for marketing.
            Our marketing budget in the first year exceeds C='s budget in
            the last 3 years.

AMIGA_ALEX> We understand and plan to be radical in our marketing programs.

RUSTYW> Does CBM UK really have that strong $$$ backing?

AMIGA_ALEX> That's a hard one to answer.  Our sources say that a Red
            Chinese company that clones cartridge is backing them.  As time
            progesses we should better understand all the parties involved
            and find out the truth.

.Jeff> Will the prices of the new Amigas be cheaper or at least competitive
       to the PC market?  How about the Laptop model?

AMIGA_ALEX> JEFF, I think I answered those questions...yes cheaper Amigas..
            yes laptops.

XIS> on the laptop just make me a lcd screen for a 1200 & I'll advertise the
     Amiga free

AMIGA_ALEX> LCD screens for all Amigas are not out of the question.

JVANHOUTEN> Do you plan on having discounts for the disabled learning blind
            etc, any software developes for this ?????

AMIGA_ALEX> No not at this time. We do plan on implementing an aggresive
            educational campaign.

            Remember, software developers are interested in making $$.  If
            there is a market then they will explore it.  Most developers
            have no idea what the users want.  It's important that you let
            them know what you need.

AMIGA_ALEX> I would like to wrap this up in the next ten minutes.  I have
            an early flight in the AM.

DRACUS> How abt pushing the Amiga 1200 in Kmart, Walmart, and Sears stores
        like the C-64?

AMIGA_ALEX> We have already reached a tentative agreement to put the CD32
            into 17,000 retailers across the US.

.Wizardess> Could you drop us a few words on your specific marketing
            background?  Which markets are you active in now and which have
            you had outstanding success with?

AMIGA_ALEX> CEI has been instrumental in obtaining wide acceptance of the 
            Amiga into a diverse arena.

AMIGA_ALEX> They include the US Army, NOAA, Walt Disney World, foreign
            governments, Medical Reaseach, the information markets.
            Many of you know that CEI has been distributing the Amiga
            line in Latin America.  We established 20 major distributors
            while Commodore pulled out of those lucritive markets.  
            Additionally, we are working with a PR and an advertising firm
            for some very creative adverts in this market.

ECURB> Just a few minutes ago I called the AmigaWorld line. It stated that
       the the decision has been delayed until Nov. 2. Why is this?

RUSTYW> Nothing would thrill me more than to see a full page ad for Amiga
        in Windos Mag!!

AMIGA_ALEX> How 'bout BYTE?

.Jeff> Forgive me if this ? has already been asked- Can we expect a
       PowerPC-based Amiga, or is 68060 more likely?

RUSTYW> just seeing an amiga ad would be great!!

AMIGA_ALEX> First, expect a 68060.  This is logical and easier to
            implement.  That will be followed by a RISC processor to be
            chosen soon.

.Mark> And Jason has the final question

AMIGA_ALEX> OH NO!

.jcompton> What's this we've heard about a fax from CEI asking dealers for
           projected demand on Amigas and floor scrubbers?  Just building
           statistics?

AMIGA_ALEX> Since we are confident of the acquisition our manufacturing
            partner (to be announced upon acquisition) has begun to do the
            statistical analysis to be able to roll products of the
            assembly line as soon as possible. This was a statistical
            analysis and was not meant to encompass the entire dealer base.

            Some dealers were upset that they were not included in this
            survey, but we were only looking for the raw data, not actual
            orders.

.Mark> Thank you all for stopping by and thanks to Alex for his time.. We 
       wish you the best for you bid in keeping the Amiga Alive and Well!
       
BRIANKOK> Thanks Alex, good luck! If you win, please switch the CTRL and ALT
          keys! :)

.Wizardess> Alex, thanks a lot for coming by and answering these questions.
            Good luck! And please don't forget the internet address
            for jdow@bix.com. {^_-}

KEHLAND> Thanks

.Jeff> Thanks ...  Take Care

INZANE> good luck

.Tom> Thanks for coming Alex. Drop by again soon.

RUSTYW> thanks is thare a email address for feedback from users?

.jcompton> Thanks, once again, for hanging around with a bunch of weirdos,
           Alex.

.Ardell> Good Luck Alex!

.Wizardess> Probably best to do it through Jason.

AMIGA_ALEX> Thank you all :)  Thanks for all the support!

== Wake-Up With Flowers                                 By: Lamar Morgan ==
===========================================================================

Worldwide News Media Wake-up Call w/Flowers

Through Amiga World and Amiga Report I have encouraged Amigans throughout
the world to contact the news media and request a news investigation of
Commodore.  Now I am asking that those concerned about the future of the
Amiga platform unite worldwide by engaging in a specific activity on a
specific day.  The day?  Wednesday, October 26th.  The activity?  Send a
floral arrangement to your favorite news media person.

Why flowers?  Letters get lost, filed or more often than not, ignored.  
Flowers, on the other hand, get lots of attention.  Just imagine what it
would be like if a news person got flowers from all over the nation or the
world on a specific day for a specific reason.  Well, I believe we would
see some action by the press on our behalf.  I can personally testify to
the fact that although my letters and faxes to network newspeople resulted
in almost no feedback, the delivery of one floral arrangement resulted in a
phone call from a newswoman and a lengthy conversation about the Commodore
situation.  Nevertheless, it takes more than just one person sending
flowers to one news official to get the news media in general to sit up and
take notice.  That is why I suggest we all make arrangements to send
flowers on the same day - Wednesday, October 26th.  In so doing, the news
media in general will realize this is a worldwide event - that the Amiga is
an international computer platform worthy of their attention.

When making arrangements to send flowers, be sure the florist includes your
name, home or work phone number, a request to investigate the Commodore
situation and an uplifting remark.  For example:

                To: Deborah Amos - ABC News
                From: Lamar Morgan  (800)123-4567
                Please investigate the Commodore situation.
                For more information, please call me.
                Have a nice day.

Flower sending can be effective - whether it be to local or national media.
(Amigans outside the US need not wire flowers overseas to be effective.  
Instead, send them to your favorite local or national news media person.)
Remember, this is a worldwide event.

For those living within the United States, the following are the names and
addresses of some important news media people - although most are not
household names:

What should you do should you receive a call in response to the flowers you
sent?  Answer: explain to your caller that the flowers were sent as part of
a worldwide campaign by Amiga computer users to pursuade the news media to
investigate the Commodore situation.  Explain the situation as best you
can.  Then, refer the newsperson on to other knowledgeable Amigans.  Three
who I referred Deborah Amos of ABC News to were:

1) Mike Levin, Scala Inc. @(703)713-0900.
2) Dan Sullivan, Amiga World @(603)924-0100.
3) Jim Drew, Utilities Unlimited @(602)680-9004.

Of course, you do not have to use the people I just mentioned.  You
probably have your own list of sources.  Bottom line is to show the news
media a united worldwide Amiga community and their concern for the future
of the computer platform.  Let's show the media so they will tell the world
that Amigans mean business and their computer platform really is amazing.

==                          AmiNet Hits 10,000!                          ==
===========================================================================

Today, October 14th 1994, three years after its inception, Aminet has hit a
total number of 10,000 online files.  Again, I would like to step on the
soapbox and talk what happended in the meantime, how Aminet looks today,
and what is still in the making.  And of course I'd like to thank the
countless people who helped to make Aminet what it is today.


THE HISTORY
-----------

As I expected, there's not nearly as many stories to tell about the the
second 5000 files that found their way onto Aminet as there were about the
first 5000.  Considering how violent the early days of Aminet were, this is
certainly a progress.

Yes, there were some notable events.  There was a first go at integrating
the boing archive into Aminet (thanks once again to the many, many
volunteers who helped).  Also, the manufacturer of the Aminet CD ROM's has
changed - for the better, I hope.  We've also introduced some new services,
like gopher and WWW servers, new mirrors, and 50 BBSes carrying Aminet. 
But far more important is that Aminet now has become established standard.

Aminet now grown to a point where almost everyone on the Internet has a
working Aminet mirror nearby, which removes the need to use international
Internet lines.  There are 20 official Aminet mirrors now, plus another
dozen inofficial or partial ones.  Aminet can also be accessed from about
60 BBSes around the world, as well as on CD-ROM and diskettes.  Amiga
magazines have started quoting Aminet as the source of the freely
distributable software they review.

It looks like a dream has come true.  Back when I started doing the 50
Megabyte archive that was to become Aminet, I had a look at how the
distribution of freely distributable software worked.  It was quite messy.
There were many possible channels (different FTP sites, independent BBSes,
and lots of diskette PD series) where a software author could place his
releases, but none of them came even close to reaching everyone.  And none
of those channels came anywhere close to carrying all the Amiga software
released.

Wouldn't it be much nicer if there existed a large pool where simply *all*
Amiga software is released and stored?  It was a complete utopia when
Aminet was founded.  It starts to become reality now.  Much like the Fish
disks in the early days, Aminet has now become the place to check for new
software.  We had the luck (lots of luck, considering how much could have
gone wrong) to see a good thing succeed so totally that I don't expect any
of my future ideas will ever come close.

Internet is a strange place to be.  Aminet is being run by a team of 60
administrators who, for the most part, have never seen each other or even
talked to each other.  Aminet is moderated by a Swiss who never got closer
than 1000 miles to the computer he does his work on.  The uploads are
contributed by people who, for the most part, are never going to know who
they wrote them for.

We may not know each other.  But the users of the Amiga are, more than the
users of any other computer in the world, and on the Internet more than
anywhere else, a community.  And I am happy to have provided one bond that
keeps that community together.

THE PRESENT
-----------

Monthly downloads in thousands (at wuarchive).  The recent decline shows a
shift to the mirrors, since wuarchive is full almost all of the time.  
Newer data not available.

THE FUTURE
----------

There really isn't very much left that I can promise for the future.  What
I promised last time is reality now.  A few improvements are still ahead,
though:

So far Aminet is very hard to use for people with mail only access to
Internet.  I plan to make their lives easier with a distributed specialized
mail server for Aminet, and a mail-upload facility.

Also planned is an Aminet CD access tool that combines the browsing and
searching capabilities of the current software without using Amigaguide for
viewing.  Don't expect it very soon, though.

But the last real step ahead I'm trying to get implemented is called
annotations.  This will allow everyone to stick a short comment to the
.readme file of somebody else's upload, thus turning Aminet into a two-way
communication medium.  That way, you will for example be able to point out
that a program does not run under AGA , or give a program a rating (which
will be collected, averaged and published).  The whole thing is quite
complicated to get going, though, so give me some time....

And of course, if there is any additional service you would like to see in
Aminet, just tell me.  I'm running out of ideas :)

CREDITS

===========================================================================
== AmiTCP 3.0b2: A HowTo					  By: Keith Christopher ==
===========================================================================

     Ok so you're back in school and you dailup the Academic computing
center.  You are riding down the information super highway sitting behind
the cockpit of an amiga, It's unfortunate that you have this masterful
multitasking machine and you are limited to one serial connection.  Oh the
things you could do if you could open more than one win- dow and while that
ftp to the local aminet site that travels obiviously through a 56K line
somewhere has you reading the jolt cola can in your hand was happening you
could be surfing along the internet dropping by all your favorite road side
stops.  My kingdom for a A2065 card and a network connection.  A little
more time goes by and you are reading the 5 empty cans on your desk as you
download the latest bounty you've ftp'd from the aminet archive.  You know
there's something BIG going on in #amiga on the irc server, yet you have to
wait; after all you only have one modem, one serial port, and no network
connection.  Sound familiar ?  No?!  Maybe you are in your basement and you
have di- aled into the local on-ramp to the information super highway, same
situation.  There you are flipping screens between Adpro and Deluxe paint,
you've already drawn your name several hundred times, there has to be more.
Where's that #?S($*# on-ramp brochure.  Hmm, lets see.  .  .  Meanwhile
back at school you have decided that you will now be up all night pumped
with caffiene and need to solve this problem, where did I put the Aca-
demic Computing notes and announcement bulletin ?  Like an Archeologist you
begin to explore the depths of the piles of disks and cables, then you spy
it!  Blowing the dust off reveals a big wad of gun stuck in the middle
covering some bold face type, lets just carefully scrape it off.  .  .  The
only thing missing in this brochure is a bikini clad girl sitting behind a
terminal.  .  .  you open the brochure breaking the little white edge seal,
oh there she is, what's this next to her ?  You begin to read.  .  .  As
the gum comes off you begin sweating as you try not to damage the hidden
informatin below.  Worse yet, it's not even your gum.  Your eyes light up
as you see the message below.  ..  Your mouth slowly mo- tions out the
word.  .  .  SLIP.  .  .  That's it slip!  You dance around a little happy
with your new found information, then when the glow of discovery wears off
you stop and begin thinking.  .  .  Now what.

     While the above may be fictitious I do know one thing for sure, the
end result is the same.  Whether you come on via an on-ramp or have a
connection via work or school, one sure begins to miss the network
connection once at home.  10megabits per second over ethernet makes 1650
CPS via 14.4 dialup pale in comparison.  The ability to connect multipule
times from work leaves one dry at home with a single serial con- nection. 
This is where SLIP comes into play, sure there are other protocols and I
will talk about them later, but one of the most common is SLIP.  SLIP
stands for Serial Line Inter- net Protocol.  Basically TCP/IP style
connection over standard serial lines.  While a multi- tude exist for the
various other computers, in my opinion the Amiga has only one hard core
performer.  AmiTCP (current version 3.0.)

     While several programs exist that simulate a SLIP or network
connection, they do not talk IP.  One of the most popular being Dnet by
Matt Dillion of DICE fame.  Dnet brought some tools to the Amiga that were
under development on other platforms, and I still think it has one of the
nicest irc clients available.  (hint hint Matt, write one for AmiTCP !) The
second being AUW.  This program is much easier to install than Dnet but
doesn't have the expanse of the tools as available for dnet.  It does
however, work well.  By far AmiTCP is becoming one of the fastest and most
popular packages available on the Aminet.  Before I begin in the setup and
configuration of AmiTCP, I will first need to explain a few terms I will be
using.  These are necessary to help you as the first timer, or the person
stuck and not sure what to check an idea of how things work and how they
relate to your setup.

Internet Protocol or IP: The protocol used by internet hosts to communicate
with one another in a standard format. 

Internet Protocol Address: An address or series of numbers seperated by or
IP address peroids assigned to a machine that "talks" IP which identifies
it to ALL other machines on the internet.  This should be a unique number.
e.g.  129.235.23.1 also known as dot notation.?

Domain Name service or DNS: A service that "resolves" hostnames into its
unique Internet address.  e.g.  If a machine is named amiga.net.com with an
IP address of 129.235.23.1, and one wanted to connect with this machine, I
could telnet to amiga.net.com, IP however, cannot understand this and the
name must be "looked up" to find out it is known to the network as
129.235.23.1 routing Tables that tell a host what "route" to take to send a
message to another host on the network.  i.e.  send it to this machine and
then this machine to this machine until it hits it's destination.  This is
a very critical part of talking on the internet, if the tables are
incorrect the computers may lose the ability to talk to anyother machine
off of their local network. 


     Ok now the moment you've been waiting for.  The AmiTCP has lots of
files associated with it, there is the bin or binary archive.  This is
the one that has the main programs in it to get AmiTCP up and running.
There are many many network programs available for AmiTCP like finger,
ping, ftp, telnet, napsaterm(a vt100 emulator), an irc client, a gopher
client.  .  .  the list goes on and more are produced everyday.  This is a
very well supported package. 

     The basic installation requires OS 2.04 or better, 1MB of RAM and
approx 2MB of diskspace.

     Upon un-archiving the package and double clicking he drawer icon one
is greeted by a very welcomed sight, an installer icon !

     I do recommend that you unarchive the package in it's final resting
place.  i.e.  Comm:AmiTCP30b2

     This will save alot of time in the installation process.  If there is
an old version of AmiTCP it must be removed first and then install the
new version.

     Once you've figured out where you want to store AmiTCP, double
clicking on the install_AmiTCP icon starts the ball rolling. 

     Before doing this however I have assembled a checklist of information
in the order it is requested by the install script.  Hopefully it will help
you streamline your thoughts.   Please look this over and have the
information written down.

1. hostname your computer will be assigned (without the domain):  
2. Domain name:
3. Type of connect SLIP or CSLIP:
4. serial.device number (unit number):
    This number is usually 0 unless you have a second serial port.
5. your machines IP address:
6. NetMask:
7. Gateway:
8. Domain Name Server IP and Name: 
9. default router IP address:(same as #7)
10. SLIP dialin number:
11. SLIP login and password:

     Now that you have the information ready lets begin by double clicking
on the Install_AmiTCP icon.  This is a standard installer script so it
should feel fairly familiar, if this is your first time using the installer
script, please read each section carefully and proceed slowly.

     It is another nice to notice the "Help" button, there is alot of
useful information behind each one.  Be sure to check them out.

     Default selection (intermediate [if you were an expert you wouldn't
need this article would you ?] ) Install for real and you decide if you
want to log it all.select the directory you want to install AmiTCP in.  
Selecting the default directory will save you lots of copying time and this
is the main reason I suggest you unarchive it in its final home on your
harddisk.

     Next installer will ask you the name of your host without the domain.
<enter #1 from your list> Installer will ask you for your domain name. 
<enter #2 from your list> It will now prompt you to decide if you want to
set any enviroment variables using set- env or envarc, I recommend envarc.
Next it will prompt you for any aliases you wish to use for this hostname.
<hit proceed> The installer will ask you to select a device driver. 
<select from #3 above> (hint : rhslip.device = SLIP and rhcslip.device =
CSLIP.) (If you are unsure about this one select rhslip.device as CSLIP
understands standard SLIP.) You will be prompted for a serial.device
number.  <enter from #4 above> Now you will need to enter your IP address.
<item #5 above> You will be prompted for an address of a "point to point
address" <hit proceed> You will be prompted for a netmask.  <enter iten #6>
(if item #6 is not given simply hit return.)

     Installer will then ask you if the information you've entered is
correct.   <click proceed>

     You will again be prompted to select another SANA-II driver to
configure, click proceed.

     Installer will prompt you for a gateway machine IP address, <enter #7
if available, if not simply slick proceed.> Enter search Domain <enter item
#2 click proceed, when prompted again click proceed> Enter the IP address
of the Domain Name Server (DNS) <enter #8 then click proceed.> If another
name servers IP address is provided by your internet provider you will be
prompted to enter the information.  if not simply click proceed again.  Do
you want AmiTCP to be started at system startup?  Unless you have a FULL
time SLIP connect I suggest you select NO, selecting YES here without a
full time SLIP connection will cause AmiTCP to grab the serial.device and
effectively disable it for other system uses.  In a machine that has only
one serial port, this can be an awful thing.  Do you want the installer to
make the desired changes to you s:user-startup ?  select YES, this save
alot of time editing the file and adding the aliases and a path to your
user-startup.  Do you want the inetd to be started at AmiTCP startup?  
Select YES.  This program contains vital information for AmiTCP to access
system re- sources.  The system will tell you you are done and to reboot
your machine.

     So what are you waiting for reboot your machine.  (seriously though
this is a necessary step.  so go ahead and reboot.  be sure and save that
final writer (TM) document; oh!  sorry.)

     Congratulations!  If you've entered the information correctly you are
on the down side of a long battle to install and use AmiTCP.

Where angels fear to tread .  .  .

     This portion is going to get a little tricky and I will outline some
terms and definitions for you.  The startnet script provided with AmiTCP
will not properly start AmiTCP once your're connected.  There is some
editing to be done.  Below is what the default AmiTCP startnet script looks
like:

run AmiTCP:AmiTCP
WaitForPort AMITCP
; configure loop-back device
AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig lo/0 localhost
; Configure Devs:Networks/rhslip.device unit 0
AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig Devs:Networks/rhslip.device/0 128.220.62.50 
; Add route to this host
AmiTCP:bin/route add slip.welch.jhu.edu localhost
Assign TCP: Exists > NIL:
IF Warn
  Mount TCP: from AmiTCP:devs/Inet-Mountlist
EndIf
; Start the internet `super server'
run AmiTCP:bin/inetd

     The problem lies with several lines in the script.  We will edit this
file with a normal text editor like Ed or Textra.  Lets begin editing the
file.

 The first being the following line:

AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig lo/0 localhost

     The device lo/0 does not exist in the INTERFACES file in the AmiTCP:db
directory.  This file lists all available devices for use with AmiTCP.
While one can edit this file to reflect the changes needed it is much
easier to edit the startnet file in AmiTCP:bin.   Since there are other
changes that will need to be made as well.

     The devices are listed in the interfaces file as:

lo dev=amitcp:devs/networks/rhslip.device
slip dev=devs:networks/rhslip.device

     So we will change the line :

AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig lo/0 localhost

     To read: 
AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig slip0

     and add a line that says:

AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig lo0

     This basically configures the system to use device slip and lo at port
0 and get the information needed to configure the devices from the
interfaces file.  The device slip0 is the outgoing or the external network
port.  lo0 is the local or loopback port.  (This allows one to call one's
machine from itself.  i.e.  telnet from your machine to your machine.)

     The next line that needs editing it a little more obscure than the
previous line(s) we edited/added.  This is the line:

AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig Devs:Networks/rhslip.device/0 128.220.62.50

     This line further configures the port slip0 with several identifiers,
your IP address, the IP address of the gateway machine (if there is one)
and the netmask.  This is configured by default from the information
entered in the installer script.  This situation will not work mainly
because the syntax is wrong, it should look something like this.

AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig slip0 128.220.67.50 128.220.67.180 netmask 255.255.0.0

     The line "reads" as follows: call program ifconfig to define network
device slip0 with the IP address of 128.220.67.50 and a gateway address of
128.220.67.180 and a network mask of 255.255.0.0.  (default Class C)

     The next line, route to this host is ok as configured.  I did not need
to edit it.  We will however need to add a default network if we want to go
out and explore the world.  (we have to know the route to get there.) Note:
If you entered a default gateway this line should be correct if not,
continue on.

     Most on-ramps and schools use the first IP address in its class for
all routing, this is typically ending in 0 (zero.) in the above example the
router is 128.220.67.0, well to enable our path to reach out through there
we need to let it know that's the way to go, we do this be adding the
following lines to the startnet script just below the slip0 configuration
line above.  The lines read (one of them being a comment line):

; Add route to the default gateway
AmiTCP:bin/route add default 128.220.67.0

     The router's IP address is listed in your list of 11 prerequistes
under item #9.  The line beginning with a ";" is the comment line, this is
not read by the system.  The line "reads" pretty straight forward: call the
route program and let me default route (unless otherwise specified) be
128.220.67.0.  i.e.  send my packets that go out of my local do- main to
this device so it may forward them to the recipient machine.   The rest of
the file can be left alone it is fine as it is.  Double check your entries
and save your file. 

Back on high ground.

     Now that you've installed and configured the heart of AmiTCP, will
will need to check/tweek some other files.  These can be found in AmiTCP:db
and are called hosts and netdb.  These files hold some important network
information to allow us to talk to other hosts once connected. 

     The hosts file contains system IP addresses and names, as well as any
aliases you may wish to add.  for example, our DNS machine is called
dns.net.com and has an IP address of 128.220.67.13., to type out
dns.net.com or the IP address will usually take alot of typing depending on
the hostname.  (wait until you see some of the German host- names!) The
hosts file also allows one to assign an alias or shortcut to the name.  I
could simply type telnet dns in lieu of typing telnet dns.net.com.  The
entries are as fol- lows:

IP address      HOSTNAME                alias
128.220.67.13   dns.net.com             dns

     This says to the system the IP address is assigned to the hostname and
can be address by the alias.  There should be an entry in this file for the
local host DO NOT remove this entry.  The hosts file can also speed up
accessing other systems.  The system will first try to resolve the hostname
into an IP address by looking in the hosts table to see if it exists, if it
finds it, it will stop trying to resolve and grab the information provided
and make the connection.  If it does not exist in the hosts file the system
then looks to the netdb file for a listing of name servers.  The netdb file
should look something like the fol- lowing:

; This host
HOST 128.220.67.50 slip.welch.jhu.edu slip
; Domain names
DOMAIN welch.jhu.edu
; Name servers
NAMESERVER 128.220.67.13
NAMESERVER 128.220.67.78
WITH protocols PREFIX=P
WITH services PREFIX=S

     The information is fairly straight forward, first listing the local
host machine, next listing the domain and then thirdly listing the
nameservers.  This is how AmiTCP knows which host to ask to resolve names
intto IP addresses from.  The last lines are add per the
Amitcp:db/protocols file and the services file:

; protocols -- the protocol database file for AmiTCP/IP
; This file shouls be included from netdb-file with following line:
; WITH protocols PREFIX=P

; services -- the services database file for AmiTCP/IP
; This file shouls be included from netdb-file with following line:
; WITH services PREFIX=S

      Now that everything has been checked out and is set lets make a
connection.

All setup and nowhere to go.

      OK, all we need to do now is dialin and start AmiTCP for a SLIP
connection!  There are only a few steps involved in this and they are
fairly straight forward.  I will be referring to Term 4 by Olaf Barthel as
my choice of terminal programs.  Terminus will also work well with this
configuration.  Napsaterm, the vt100 emulator packaged with AmiTCP, can
also be used to dialin with; I have not tried this however. 

1) Run the terminal program of choice by double clicking its icon.
2) Dial the internet service provider using the number listed in item #10
3) Once connected enter the login and password.

     NOTE: Some slip setups only require a loginID and password, SLIP
starts automatically.  However there are others that require a command to
be typed from the prompt, i.e.  SLIP,slip .  .  .  Check with your internet
provider to find out how it is invoked on their host. 

4) Once SLIP has been started on the host (either auto or manual), select
release serial device from the menu or Iconify or quit the program while
still online.  The latter being a much sloppier way of freeing the
serial.device.  The serial.device MUST be freed to start AmiTCP!  If you
are using Terminus for instance issuing AT&D0 before dialing will allow the
modem to stay online after the terminal program is exited.  (I added this
to my startup init string.)

5) Once the serial.device is freed, open a cli and type: "AmiTCP:bin/startnet"
(without the quotes. The path should be set in S:user-startup but I always
type paths out for some reason. In other words typing startnet from the CLI
will also work.)

You should see something like the following:

4.Comm:AmiTcp3/bin> startnet
[CLI 1]
slip0: flags=b0<POINTOPOINT,NOTRAILERS,NOARP>
lo0: flags=8<LOOPBACK>
add net default: gateway 128.220.67.0
[CLI 5]
4.Comm:AmiTcp3/bin> 

     This signifies that AmiTCP has started successfully.  If for some
reason it did not start successfully then it will open a CLI window at the
top of the screen and display an erro message. 

     That's it!  now you're connected !  The world is your oyster, all you
need to do is know where to go and what to use and how to use it.  Well
I'll be covering that in my next few articles, there's lots of things to do
with AmiTCP, this is just the tip of a VERY large ice- berg.  You are now
running one of the hottest programs available on the internet !

     Check out my sidebar titled Now What?  It should give you an idea of
things to do and places to go to begin checking out the internet.  Happy
surfing, !

     Upon validating my "HOW TO" guide I was informed by the AmiTCP team
that the next release of AmiTCP will circumvent most of the editing and
headaches involved with installing and setup of version 3.0x AmiTCP.  I was
also informed that the next version will be released as commercial.  While
this may be upsetting to some who have enjoyed the freedom of getting this
software and running it with reckless abandon they seem to forget that
there is a team of people putting hard work behind this software (as with
all other shareware.) The tenative cost will be 99$ and offer preorder
discounts and Student pricing.  (I hope they come up with a cool logo and
disk label.) If you use it now it looks like the commercial version will
only be better, I do recommed supporting them, since C=`s TCP/IP stack was
dead after its release due to no support/updates.  (Keith stepping down
from his soapbox.)

.jcompton> What's this we've heard about a fax from CEI asking dealers for
projected demand on Amigas and floor scrubbers?  Just building statistics?


AMIGA_ALEX> Since we are confident of the acquisition our manufacturing
partner (to be announced upon acquisition) has begun to do the statistical
analysis to be able to roll products of the assembly line as soon as
possible.  This was a statistical analysis and was not meant to encompass
the entire dealer base.  Some dealers were upset that they were not
included in this survey, but we were only looking for the raw data, not
actual orders.

.Mark> The floor is now open to all

.jcompton> <scrub>

.Mark> You dont let up on the floor scrubber jokes do you?

RUSTYW> Will this scurbber multitask?

.Ardell> I like the floor scrubber jokes...

RUSTYW> Jay and can several scrubber be networked?

.jcompton> Rusty: We're working on building SoapyTCP into the engine.

.Del> And can the network be scrubbed?

.Wizardess> It is done with a cast iron pipe between the handles of the
various scrubbers.  It is the floor scrubber from hell!

.jcompton> Del: Well, the RJ-45 cables don't hold up real well to an
industrial strength scrubbing right now...

MIJ67> How about a laptop scrubber....?

.Jeff> Self-cleaning Drives?

RUSSTYW> will this be a 10baseT or wireless net?>

.jcompton> Rusty: We're trying to cross the wireless barrier, but so far
all we can do is charge the batteries.

.Del> Will it render BOTH MS-DOS AND AMIGA disks asunder?

.Wizardess> If you need a laptop scrubber to get your jollies you are doing
SOMETHING wrong, VERY wrong.  {O,o}

.jcompton> There's a rumor on c.s.a.emulations that Jim Drew is going to
port MScrub to the Amiga, but I really doubt it.

.Del> And a buffing for a nice shine...

.Mark> Well Jason.. When is the conferecce with UK?

.Wizardess> They are unresponsive - utterly unresponsive.  I have tried
repeatedly.

.jcompton> Mark: When David Pleasance or Colin Proudfoot answer my standing
invitation.  I have no idea.  I had Sharon McGuffie REMIND them that I
invited them.
  
RUSTYW> if Red China get the amiga, they can change the name from Commodore
amiga to Commrad Amiga

JVANHOUTEN> bye all going to the FTP

RUSTYW> me too only I have to FTP some sleep

.Del> RUSTY telnetted to bed, then FTPd some sleep...

.jcompton> ...the upshot of which is that DP/CP would have to hold their
conference around 4:00 AM their time, but I think that's a decent
sacrifice, seeing as how I've kept Alex up past midnight twice...

.Wizardess> That is what I was proposing.  I could bring in a good crowd
both here and BIX for them.  (I wish we could link 'em.)

.Del> Conference on IRC, that would be a madhouse...

.Wizardess> (I suppose I should try IRC sometime.  But....  no time!)

@toc P2-3

I'll bet you were surprised to see how many cool Amiga CD's that Fred Fish
is distributing these days: FreshFish, FrozenFish, GoldFish, OldFish,
PrehistoricFish, ShavedFish, etc.  etc.  Well, I have some AMAZING NEWS
about Fred's most recent, upcoming CD that will make Amiga history!! 
Thanks to BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED's "Industrial Espionage" Department, the
following top-secret, INSIDER INFORMATION can now be revealed.  (Sorry,
Fred, but this is just TOO exciting to keep secret!!)

        Presenting...

                        *************************
                        *       Fish Styx!      *
                        *************************

        What is "Fish Styx?" Here's the story.  It's a little known fact
that Fred Fish has an excellent singing voice.  He has one of the finest
bass voices around and has quite a reputation in the highly selective
"computer jingle" industry.  A loyal Amigan even in song, Fred was recently
approached by IBM to do a commercial for their latest Pentium-based
machine, and he turned them down on principle.  Way to go, Fred!

        Anyway, Fred's fans have finally persuaded him to release his first
full-length audio CD, "Fish Styx!" It features these soon-to-be NUMBER ONE
HITS:

        "Oooh, Baby I Love Your Toaster" (with Kiki Stockhammer)

                Thrill to Fred and Kiki's soulful rendition of this classic
                ballad about love and multimedia.

        "What's The Frequency, Irving?"

                Alternative music at its best!!  This song reveals, for the
                first time ever, just how many CD32's REALLY were produced
                per week at Commodore's Phillippines plant.

        "Can You Feel The Load Tonight?"
           
                A beautiful, sensitive ballad about network slowdown on
                IRC.  From the soundtrack of the little-known Disney movie,
                THE LINELINK KING.

        "Free Ware"

                A southern-rockin' love song about the lonely life of
                a public domain software author:

                     "If I code this tomorrow...
                      Will you still remember me?
                      For I must be hacking on, now...
                      'Cause there's too many addresses I've got to see..."

                This red-hot rocker features a 10-minute-long, scorching
                guitar solo played by the famous Dave Haynie!!
                (Ex-Commodore engineer, now CEO of Columbia Records.)

        "Born To Run"

               A complex, yet tender, high-energy tune about how Commodore
               moved the "Run" command out of the C: directory and into the
               Shell.

        "For Those About To Hack, We Salute You"

                Hear Fred rock out on this heavy-metal headbanger in honor
                of demo coders everywhere.

        "Ooooh, I Heard It From the Grapevine"

                A soulful testament to the problems of buying Amiga
                hardware by mailorder.  The lyrics consist entirely of
                excuses like, "it's on backorder," "we shipped it
                yesterday," and "at the sound of the beep, please leave
                a message, and a representative will return your call."

        "Eleanor Mehdi"

                A 1960's style song with a haunting cello accompaniment.
                The lyrics say it all:

                        "Eleanor Mehdi
                        Picks up her check at the desk where the factory
                           has been...
                        Lives in a dream.
                        Look at her working,
                        Making commercials and adverts that no one will
                           see,
                        Till bankruptcy.
                        All the lonely people, too few Amiga hacks.
                        All the lonely people, why do they all buy Macs?"

        Similar to the recent Meeting Pearls and Aminet Share CD's, "Fish
Styx" will be distributed as shareware.  If you enjoy the music, you are
obligated to make a contribution to Fred, either in cash or by singing your
favorite song to him over the phone.

        "Fish Styx" is available from Amiga dealers and Sam Goody, and is
available on CD, data cassette, and in MOD format.  Check it out, fin fans!

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                     COMMODORE INTERNATIONAL PURCHASED
                         BY MCDONALD'S CORPORATION

The Bahamas -- October 18, 1994 -- Bankrupt computer manufacturer Commodore
International, former makers of the "Amiga" multimedia computer, was
purchased outright in a surprise move last night by McDonald's Corporation.
Previous bidders CEI and Commodore UK are reportedly "stunned" and
consulting their legal departments in an effort to block the purchase
retroactively.

"We've had our eyes on Commodore for a long time," said Robert Burger,
official spokesperson for McDonald's.  "For years, we've been thinking of
expanding our operations into the computer market, and now we're ready to
start cooking."

Burger said that McDonald's first product based on Amiga technology will be
a new game console.  Nicknamed "The McNugget", this sizzling new 32-bit
console will feature great graphics and superb sound.  In addition, every
time you beat the high score on your machine, coupons for free burgers and
shakes will be printed from the console's serial port.  Unlike many
existing consoles, the McNugget will not have a CD-ROM drive.  Instead, it
will use a new, proprietary data disc called the "Patty." Patties are
placed into the McNugget's data drawer (known as the "Bun"), and data is
literally broiled onto its surface for later retrieval.  This unique
technology is known as EORM, or "Eat Once Regurgitate Many."

Another technology advance is McDonald's new speech synthesizer, designed
to take the place of the Narrator Device that was removed from AmigaDOS
after version 2.04.  The technology is in the development stages, however,
and still contains several bugs.  For example, at the end of every
sentence, instead of pausing, the voice adds, "Would you like fries with
that?"

To the relief of Amigans worldwide, all existing Amiga products will be
reintroduced to the market with new names.  Watch for the Mc4000, Mc1200,
and other products to appear around Christmas of this year.  As for the
rumored Amiga 5000, it is slated to appear under the McDonald's logo by the
middle of next year.  "We searched for a long, long time to find a clever,
catchy name for the new machine that would embody both computing power and
begin with 'Mc'.  We finally settled on 'McIntosh.'" Apple's lawyers are
reportedly wearing ritual clothing and performing pre-lawsuit dances.

                                                        Dan

== Review: Cybersphere                                By: @{"Jason Compton" link P8-1} ==
===========================================================================

Hey, it's nice to have software show up at your door that you didn't know
about before.  Such is the case with Cybersphere.  I didn't ask for it, it
just showed up one day.  I'm glad, too.

Most people have played some sort of Breakout game.  If that doesn't ring
a bell, think of Arkanoid games.  If that doesn't work, try one of the
more popular Amiga options, MegaBall.  Get the idea?  Use a paddle
(usually restricted to horizonal sliding movement) to bounce a ball to
break bricks that exist "above" you.  In the Arkanoid variants of this
sort of game, rewards come down, usually in the forms of "power-ups" for
your paddle, like a gun, extra length, a slower ball...things like that.
Your goal is to break all of the bricks so you can go to the next level
and break more.  Miss the ball, and you die.

So, it's not the life for everyone.  But it can be a lot of fun.
Cybersphere is exactly that: a lot of fun.  The game idea itself is old,
but this implementation is very clever.  Almost every brick yields some
sort of prize...many bricks yield a shower of them in the form of gems you
can collect for a bonus at the end of the level.  Other goodies include
the requisite length, gun, and speed-decreasing bonus, along with old
favorites like multiple balls (extra destructive power but tougher to keep
everything in play), and the special bonus level, in which you can earn
tons of points and generally feel good about yourself.

This game, like many others in its genre, is fun.  The smooth animation
and colorful (for ECS) game grid make it pleasing to the eye.  One thing
that stands about it compared to other Arkanoid-clones is the largeness of
everything, which at first may disorient players familiar with games such
as MegaBall.  Another is the sheer volume of objects on the screen...with
the gun and a quick left-mouse-button finger, you can get 20-30 gems and 3
power-ups careening towards you.

One place where the game falls a bit short is in the music...it's
hard-coded and not very good (halfway decent 64 SID music comes to mind).
Still, the game itself isn't killed by it.  And for US$12.50, you've gotta
hate Arkanoid games to not be interested.

== Review: GPFax                                      By: @{"Jason Compton" link P8-1} ==
===========================================================================

There's something fun about GPFax.  Maybe it's the goofy near-pastel colors
picked as the defaults.  Maybe it's the fact that the GP in GPFax is Dr.
Greg Perry, and, even though we're not sure what he's a doctor of, he's a
doctor of something.  Maybe it's the button labeled "WOW" instead of "OK"
in the exciting "About" window.  Maybe it's the "This page intentionally
left blank" pages in the manual.  Whatever it is, GPFax is charming.

That said, it's time to worry about what it's supposed to do, and that's
fax.  And fax it does.  Available now as a combined Group 1 and Group 2
package on the same disk (about time), GPFax is going to work with
basically any faxmodem worth using.  GPFax will send plain ASCII text (and
allows for formatting to things like bold and italic), IFFs, and files
printed from virtually any Amiga word processor (I find it works very well
with Final Copy/Writer) using a "printer" driver that automatically traps
prints and places them into a special fax directory on your HD.  The GPFax
software can run on its own custom screen with a custom GUI (a takeoff on
the Amiga's Intuition: marginally faster but does not allow for window
layering) or on the Workbench.  Take your pick.  Faxes themselves can be
viewed in basically any screen resolution you have available (the more
resolution you have at your disposal, the better.) Serial drivers are
selectable and may be shared, ARexx support is present...it's got what you
need.

The quality of the faxing itself is quite good.  The phone book is
well-organized, allowing multiple fax destinations to be "grouped" for mass
faxing.  The dialer gets to the point...it, in short, works.

For convenience, and to save you a trip to your modem manual, GPFax comes
with roughly 16 pre-configured modem types in the two classes, and can use
a Generic Class 1 or 2 configuration as well.  If you're lazy or don't
know, it can detect which class modem you own.  I was able to test GPFax
with a USR Sportster (Class 1, USR modem option) and a ViVa 14.4 fax/modem
(Class 2 Generic).  The Sportster performed flawlessly, but the ViVa had a
rough time interfacing with a Ricoh laser plain paper fax machine at times.
It was able to receive but not send correctly all of the time.  It did
interact fine with the Sportster.  I am inclined to blame the modem itself
for the problems.

The likes?  It's a solid fax program at a decent price.  The interface is
smooth, and performance is great.  The myriad of options, including
scheduling, ensures that you'll get the performance you need.  Dislikes are
few...a way to pretty up the default colors would be nice.  That's pretty
much it.  A warning to readers unfamiliar with what A4 paper is: be sure to
configure pagination to letter size, as GPFax defaults to A4, which is
longer than the fax machines you'll be sending to are likely to be
expecting.

If you need faxing and don't want to tangle with a free or shareware
solution without as slick and simple of an interface, GPFax is what you
want.

== Review: Guardian                                   By: @{"Jason Compton" link P8-1} ==
===========================================================================

Give us a good CD32 game, so the call goes.

Give us something with nice graphics, fast RAM compatibility, NTSC/PAL
compatibility...oh, and fittingly good CD tracks.

Give us Guardian.  It's really that good.

For those who haven't played the demo yet, Guardian is a 3D remote-camera
perspective game which finds its roots in the old game of Defender.  The
upshot: Blow up all of the bad guys before they blow up your buildings.

You fly your speedy glider of death around what seems to be a small,
recurring plot of land (but with a suspension of disbelief could be an
entire planet), trying to find these baddies so you can hit them with your
rapid fire cannon.

What's to stop you?  Time...after all, you can't be everywhere at once, and
the enemy is rather widespead.  (airlifted in from what appear to be huge
hot air balloons) Another deterrent is the fact that certain varieties of
enemy craft shoot back at you...chase you around...and try their hardest to
slam dead into you.  You're provided with a shield, but it's often not
enough when you start hitting aliens or, worse, buildings.  (Yep, you can
uproot a pine tree with your craft, and it does a number on you.)

What makes Guardian so nice?  Well, the flying-around-shooting-people is
well done and makes decent use of the CD32's pad.  Control seems logical. 
The graphics aren't stellar, but are crisp enough in their own right, and
the 3D generation is considerably enhanced by fast RAM.  The
freely-adjustable camera angle is another bonus...if you're feeling
masochistic, you can place the camera in FRONT of your craft, relying on
your radar (and incredible luck) to keep you alive.  Or, do a top-down,
wide-angle view of the land as you fly through it getting pummeled.

Life isn't perfect, though...on the faraway views of the camera, objects
just don't appear until they're ready, leaving "blank" areas where you
can't see anything coming.  Also, if you place the camera below the plane
your craft flies at, ground-level objects appear to float in midair...

Ah, but that's ok.  Guardian is good, solid, explosive fun that no CD32
owner with $45 to blow should be without.  It's a great compliment to your
machine.

== Review: Workbench 3.1                                By: William Near ==
===========================================================================

PROGRAM:  Amiga Workbench v3.1  (Kickstart version -  40.63)
                                (Workbench version -  40.42)

PUBLISHER:  Commodore-Amiga Inc.

            Distributed and manufactured by Village Tronic Marketing GmbH,
            Germany

DESCRIPTION:  Workbench/AmigaDOS v3.1 for the A500/2000 computer

PURCHASED FROM:  Expert Services

                 (606) 371-9690 - Orders
                 (606) 282-5942 - BBS 

PRICE:  I paid $130 U.S.  This includes $5 S&H

        There are other people selling the Workbench (WB) 3.1 kits for as
        much as $225 U.S., so shop around to get the best price.  Note:
        There are substantiated reports of pirate copies of WB 3.1 being
        sold.  These bogus kits are just Xeroxed copies of the manuals and
        copies of the disks.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:  Amiga 500/2000 hard drive recommended, but not
                      necessary

SYSTEM TESTED ON:  Amiga 2000 (Rev 4.4), ECS chipset, GForce '030
                   accelerator @ 50MHz., 1 meg CHIP + 6 megs FAST memory,
                   2 standard floppy drives, Quantum LPS270S hard drive
                   with Trumpcard Professional controller.

PACKAGING: Workbench 3.1 came with Workbench, AmigaDOS, and ARexx manuals
           (the manuals are the plain paperback type, not the nice 3-ring
           binder type I received with WB 2.04), an AmigaDOS quick
           reference card, a 3.1 ROM installation instruction sheet, a 3.1
           ROM chip, and six disks. 

NOTE: This review is written with the assumption that you have previously
      used Workbench v2.04, 2.05, or 2.1.  It would make this review ten
      times longer if I had to compare this Workbench to the pre-2.x
      releases.  So, all references to new features will be written on a
      Workbench 2.x comparison basis.


INSTALLATION: The instruction sheet contains the necessary steps for
installing the 3.1 ROM in either an A500 or A2000 computer.  I will briefly
cover the special notes for each installation just so you'll know what
you're getting into here.  For the A500 motherboard Rev.  3 & 5, the 3.1
ROM must have Pin 1 jumpered to Pin 31 and for Rev 6A and above the 3.1 ROM
requires no jumper.  For the older A2000s with the motherboard marked "1989
COMMODORE AMIGA 2000 MADE IN GERMANY (BSW) or for Rev.  3 motherboards, the
3.1 ROM must have Pin 1 jumpered to Pin 31, for Rev.  4 and higher
motherboards, no jumper is needed.  The ROM I received came with no jumper
wire attached, but I didn't need one anyway.  The new ROM was easily
installed into my MultiStart ROM switcher after removing my old 2.04 ROM. 


    I chose to reformat my entire hard drive with the new version of the
Fast File System (FFS) included with WB 3.1 (note: I did NOT use the
directory caching feature of the new FFS because I also boot up in WB 1.3
from the hard drive and the older OS would not recognize the hard drive as
a valid DOS disk if directory caching were present.) The representative at
Expert Services said that I could expect a 10-20% increase in hard drive
reads/writes by using the new FFS -- the speed increase was more like 5-10%
in actual use as determined by SysInfo v3.24.  Any speed increase is
welcome and it didn't take that long to back up the crucial information on
my hard drive.  I just booted up the computer with the WB 3.1 disks after
installing the 3.1 ROM and accessed the hard dive using the HDToolbox
program. 

    The software uses the Commodore Installer program which makes things
run quite smoothly.  If you have previously installed Workbench v2.x then
you should be familiar with this process.  If you have a previous version
of Workbench installed on your hard drive then the Installer program will
delete any old files that are unnecessary to the new version of the
Workbench and it will also preserve any preferences and user-startup
scripts you are using. 


A NEW LOOK AND FEEL: WB 3.1 has a new 3-D look to the windows and sliders
that adds some professionalism to the Workbench.  It uses the exact same
pulldown menus as WB 2.x does, so things won't look all that different if
you're used to WB 2.x.  The differences are somewhat subtle, but there is
some real power lurking underneath. 

    The back of the Workbench box claims improved support for graphics
boards e.g.  Picosso II RTG with up to 1600x1200 pixels in 256 colors (I
can't verify this since I don't have a 24bit card.) The graphics rendering
is also significantly accelerated due to the completely rewritten graphics
and layers libraries.  You can definitely notice the difference, especially
with the screen refreshes and when scrolling text etc. 

    The following sections contain a description of what objects are
contained within each drawer of the new WB 3.1 -- they do not list every
object in each drawer, just things that have been changed or added with the
new WB release.  All unlisted objects are assumed to be the same from WB
2.x to WB 3.1.


UTILITIES: The Utilities drawer contains a program called MultiView.
MultiView is a powerful utility that can read an IFF text file, view a
picture file in almost any format, play sound files, view AmigaGuide
hypertext documents, play animations, and perform many other functions.
The MultiView utility relies on DataTypes (see below for a list of included
DataTypes) to access the many types of formats available to the Amiga.  A
DataType is a description of the data to be used, you can get DataTypes for
virtually anything you want to view, play, read, or whatever.  DataTypes
are included with WB 3.1 and others are available on many BBS's and
commercial services, such as: GEnie, CompuServe, etc.  If you can't find a
DataType for a file format you want to manipulate with MultiView then just
write one for yourself! 

    The MultiView icon can open a standard file requester or, because it is
an AppWindow, it can just open a window on the Workbench screen into which
you can drag various icons to manipulate.  Just drag a sound file into the
MultiView window and a little speaker icon will appear in the window.
Click on the speaker icon and the sound will be played.  When you load an
animation file into MultiView you will get a VCR-type control panel for
manipulating the animation with FastForward, Reverse, Play buttons and a
slider for jumping to any part of the animation.  This is a very powerful
utility and it's fun to use! 

    Although the Say utility is not included with WB 3.1 you can easily
enable it by copying the necessary files from an old WB 1.3 disk.  It works
flawlessly under WB 3.1.

TOOLS: The Tools drawer contains one new commodity program, a mouse
blanker.  The mouse blanker is very simple, just double click its icon to
enable it.  Whenever you type at the keyboard the pointer will disappear. 
To make the pointer reappear just move the mouse.  I would have liked to
see a better mouse blanker that would allow a user-defined time limit
before blanking the mouse.

SYSTEM: Nothing new here.

DEVS: The Devs drawer contains the DataTypes used by MultiView, some new
Monitor drivers, and a CD-ROM DOSDriver. 

* The DataTypes included with WB 3.1 are:  

     8SVX - IFF sound files

     AmigaGuide - Amiga help files

     FTXT - IFF text files

     ANIM - ANIM-format animation files

     CDXL - CDXL-format animation files

     ILBM - Bitmap picture files

* The new monitor drivers are : DblNTSC, DblPAL, and VGAOnly.  The DblNTSC
and DblPAL drivers add eight new screen modes:

     DblNTSC

                    High Res Laced - 640 x 800  4 colors

                    High Res No Flicker - 640 x 400  4 colors

                    Low Res Laced - 640 x 800  16 colors

                    Low Res No Flicker - 640 x 400  16 colors


     DblPAL

                    High Res Laced - 640 x 1024  4 colors

                    High Res No Flicker - 640 x 512  4 colors
       
                    Low Res Laced - 640 x 1024  16 colors

                    Low Res No Flicker - 640 x 512  16 colors


The VGAOnly driver is used when a VGA monitor is attached to the Amiga and
the Multiscan screen modes won't work correctly.  The VGAOnly driver
modifies the scan rate and will cause the left edge of the screen to flash
when scrolling horizontally.

* The new CD-ROM DOSDriver (CD0) allows you to access a connected CD-ROM
drive by using the device name CD0:.  This is quite a nice feature of WB
3.1, now any connected CD-ROM drive shows up as just another Workbench icon
like any other device -- no other software is necessary for basic CD-ROM
access.

PREFERENCES: The Preferences drawer contains new WBPattern, Palette,
Pointer, and Overscan preference editors. 

* The new WBPattern preference editor allows you to place a backdrop image
on the Workbench, windows, and screen.  The images can be different from
one another.  So, you could have one image inside any open windows, another
image inside the Workbench window (providing you have the
Workbench/Backdrop feature disabled), and yet another image on the actual
screen behind the Workbench window!  Of course you can still use the boring
pattern selection and choose one of the eight pre-defined patterns or draw
one of your own.  Who would want to use the same old patterns when they can
select any IFF image to use?  This is a very nice feature of the new
Workbench -- no more hacks needed to accomplish this feat.  Besides, the
hacks I saw were only able to place an image as the backdrop to Workbench,
now you get three choices that you can use! 

* The new Palette preference editor is totally reworked from previous
incarnations. 

The set of color blocks are located at the upper left corner of the editor.
You can click on any one of the colors to set its new value.

The colors can be adjusted by one of four means: Red Green Blue sliders,
Color Wheel, Gradient slider, or Hue Saturation Brightness sliders.


     Red Green Blue sliders - These are the familiar sliders found on
                              previous versions of WB.

     Color Wheel - Selecting the Color Wheel bar from the main palette
                   editing screen brings up a color wheel with a pointer
                   inside of it.  You can drag the pointer around the color
                   wheel with your mouse to change the basic color of the
                   selected block.  

     Gradient Slider - The Gradient Slider works in conjunction with the
                       Color Wheel.  As you move the pointer around the
                       color wheel the gradient slider, off to the right,
                       changes its range of possible colors according to
                       the position of the pointer on the color wheel.  You
                       may then move a slider up and down, throughout the
                       range of colors, on the gradient slider.  This
                       method allows you to select a more precise shade of
                       the general color selected with the color wheel.  

     Hue Saturation Brightness sliders (HSB) - You can select this option
                                               from the pulldown menu.  It
                                               replaces the RGB sliders
                                               with Hue, Saturation, and
                                               Brightness sliders for
                                               controlling the colors.

  

Off to the right of the main palette editor is a list of items to choose
from for adjusting certain screen attribute's colors.  The list includes:

     Background

     Text

     Important Text

     Bright Edges

     Dark Edges

     Active Window Title Bar

     Active Window Titles

     Menu Background

     Menu Text

At the bottom of the palette screen is a mock representation of a Workbench
title bar, a pulldown menu, active and inactive windows, and various
buttons and requesters.  This allows you to get a visual idea of how any
changes you make will appear, instead of having to use your changes and
exit the palette editor numerous times.  There are also several predefined
palettes available from the pulldown menu

The new palette editor really allows you to change all aspects of how the Workbench will look -- this 
makes it possible to personalize your Workbench like never before.

* The new Pointer editor allows you to edit both the mouse and busy
pointers.  If I had an AGA machine then I could have a hi-res mouse pointer
and busy pointer, but with an ECS machine I'm still saddled with the lo-res
versions. 

* The new Overscan editor has a nice little addition in the form of four
arrows that allow you to make small changes to the screen positioning.  By
clicking on one of the four arrows you can move the display one pixel at a
time in any direction instead of dragging the screen by the center handle
(which you can still do if you so choose.)


NEW WORKBENCH FEATURES: The following are new additions to WB 3.1 over the
earlier 2.x versions (these come in order of how they appear in the
manuals):

* Under the Icons/Format Disk menu choice you have a new option called
Directory Cache.  Directory Cache speeds up the opening of drawers, file
requesters, and listings.  This feature seems to be of greatest use on
floppy disks as their access is considerably slower than hard drives.
Directory Cache should only be used on disks and devices that will not be
accessed by pre-3.x Workbenches as they will be unreadable by them.  This
option makes a noticeable difference in accessing data from floppy disks,
but due to the incompatibility you will have to avoid using it when giving
data to fellow Amiga users with older versions of Workbench.

* The ED menus come in two flavors, contrary to several messages I've read
on the Amiga FIDO echo where some people have been saying that it was a bug
in the OS!  It used to be a secret that you could reap the benefits of the
expanded ED menus by renaming the ED-STARTUP file in your S directory.
Finally, Commodore has put this little treasure in the manual instead of
letting the user rely on word-of-mouth sources or various books and
articles on the Amiga.  All of the new menu options are fully documented. 
I highly recommend using the expanded menus because they add many features
to ED's operation.

* There are many new Early Startup features programmed into the ROM.  Here
are all of the choices available in the 3.1 ROM:

    Disabling Devices and Caches - You can disable devices and caches from
a list of available devices.  Choose the hard drive partition(s) and/or
disk drive(s) you wish to disable from the list and then boot the computer
to save valuable memory.  If you select the disable CPU Caches option then
all Instruction and Data caches will be disabled on 68020, '030, and '040
CPUs. 

    Choosing Display Options - You can emulate the Original Chip Set (OCS)
on earlier Amigas by selecting the OCS button.  This will allow you to use
older programs that will not run correctly under the Enhanced Chip Set
(ECS).  Also, you can boot up in PAL or NTSC modes.  You must have at least
the ECS chipset to use these options.  Users of Degrader will find these
modes quite useful in getting older and PAL-based programs to work.

    Diagnosing Expansion Board Failures - This option will pull up a screen
that lists all the available expansion boards installed in your Amiga.  The
list contains:


        Board Number -   The number of the expansion board

        Manufacturer -   The number of the maker of the board

        Product Column - The manufacturer's product number for the board

        Status Column -  The status of the board: Working or Defective

* There are a few new AmigaDOS commands:

     LOADRESOURCE - This command allows you to preload resources into
memory to cut down on excessive disk swaps on floppy-based systems.  You
can preload: Libraries, Devices, Fonts, and Catalogs.

     REQUESTCHOICE - This command allows you to use custom requesters from
ARexx scripts and AmigaDOS.  You could set up a custom requester that
contains the text "Is it OK to proceed?", and then have OK and CANCEL
buttons at the bottom of the requester.  This is very nice!

     REQUESTFILE - This command allows you to open a standard file
requester from AmigaDOS or an ARexx script.

     SETKEYBOARD - This command allows you to temporarily redefine the
keymap to be used in the current Shell.

HIDDEN MESSAGES: Remember those neat hidden messages that could be found
with a weird combination of key presses in Workbenches past?  Well, there
are some new ones included with WB 3.0 and probably WB 3.1, too!  Here are
the hints from Denny Atkin's Best Amiga Tips and Secrets book:

     #1 - Control is given to those who are shifted four from the start and
          do not give up on the alternate course.

     #2 - When it is about time to learn the secrets of the master, one must
          also qualify for enlightenment.



If anyone figures this one out, please leave me some Email at my Internet
address telling me how you did it.
  
SUMMARY: I really love the new Workbench.  It is a nice improvement over WB
2.1 and it is definitely worth investing in.  I didn't notice too much
software incompatibility, on an ECS machine with WB 3.1 you can expect
about the same software compatibility as you have been accustomed to under
WB 2.x.  The addition of the new 3-D look, added hard drive speed with the
new FFS, MultiView, graphics board support, eight new screen modes, CD-ROM
support, new Preferences editors, Directory Caching, Early Startup Menus,
and the added AmigaDOS commands make Workbench 3.1 a real winner.  With the
current uncertainty of the future for the Amiga it can't hurt to help
support the platform and you would at least have the latest incarnation of
the Workbench.  Buy it -- you won't regret it!

Another Amiga to complete the link.

SOFTWARE

None.


COPY PROTECTION

None.


MACHINES USED FOR TESTING

Amiga 3000/25, 4 MB Fast RAM, 2 MB Chip RAM
2 internal 880K floppies
2 gig Hewlett Packard HD
ViewSonic SVGA monitor
Comports 8 port high speed serial cards (for sale BTW)
AmigaDOS 3.1

CD32 w/2MB chip only
AmigaDOS 3.1
Workbench 3.1 (Kick 40.60 WB 39.29 old WB version??)

GE S-VHS TV/Monitor.


INSTALLATION

Installation is rather simple.  Plug one end of the cable (DB-25) into your
Amiga, Plug the round cable end into the CD32's AUX port and your keyboard
(A4000 style) into the passthough connector.


CABLE REVIEW

I must say I am impressed, not really with the cable but with the CD32's
built in serial port.  It doesn't offer RTS/CTS handshaking, yet it can and
did lock at 57600 bps with my A3000 comports serial port and sustain
3900-4200cps with minimum errors.  The cable is of good enough quality for
what it does.  The DB25 end has a few parts in it including a small chip to
convert signals to the correct levels of standard serial ports.

The small AUX end went in the CD32 a little hard, although this may just be
my particular machine.  The keyboard passthough worked flawlessly and of
course allowed serial transfers while active.

Overall, I believe the cable is worth the $30 that NorthWest PD sells it
for.  With this cable, the Networking CD, a modem, and another NullModem
cable (to reverse it back to standard pins), your CD32 could be a nice
little terminal for calling out to a BBS as well.  Seeing as the CD32
handled the 4200 CPS all right, I am guessing it could handle one of my
28.8K modems without to much trouble.

In conclusion, for the price of $30, this is a good deal for someone who
would like to download a few small AGA Euro demos from another Amiga to
watch on their TVs (note to AGA demo makers: make these things run on NTSC
CD32s), or perhaps use their CD32 to view some nice HAM-8s.  This is a good
solution to for doing so.


NETWORK CD REVIEW

The Network CD is simple to use overall.  Once you put it into the CD32 and
turn the power reset, it gives you a message, "LOADING this may take
awhile." I believe this message is here for the CDTV owners, as it takes
approximately 1 minute 40 seconds for it to load every little program
including Arq, several commodities, the boot picture and a very annoying
backdrop.  The Network CD boots under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.0, or 3.1 for any
machine.

When you open the main CD icon, you get the standard Workbench drawers
(Prefs, Tools, Utilities, Devs, etc.) and all the setup programs.  You also
get a Shell, the wonderful trashcan (sic), and few other tidbits.  The
pre-setup programs include Terminus, Parnet, Sernet, a PhotoCD converter,
and a few others.  It also includes Fred Fish disks 800-975, Amos PD disks
478-603, Tbags disks 1-74, and approximately 500 images for viewing.

On to the programs...  About the only program I really used was Terminus. 
This is what I used for file transfers from my A3000 to the CD32.  I used
Terminus because that is what I am used to.  Read my dislikes later about
its setup.  I tried to run sernet with the included disk for the host
machine with no luck.  I'm not saying that it doesn't work -- I am sure it
does -- but I tried only once and didn't want to mess with it after that.

The only networking I have done has been with Envoy using slip.device and
plip.device.  I would have much rather seen them use an Envoy setup and
these drivers.  It would have allowed for a much cleaner and more reliable
connection with full disk icons and full network compatibility.  Using old
junker programs like Parnet and sernet just don't cut it any more. 
Actually it never did for me; Parnet has never been a viable choice in my
opinion for networking.  Sernet seems to be another hack that just doesn't
cut it.  This is only my judgement and whoever decides to use whichever is
no concern of mine.  :)


DOCUMENTATION

All the documentation is in README files on the CD.  Most every individual
program had its own README that brings up a text reader.  The ones written
by the makers of the CD were for the most part clear and helped where
needed.  The rest were mostly the documents that came with the programs
(i.e., Terminus, ViewTek, etc.).  Everything overall was complete and not
to hard to understand.


LIKES

The setup was simple, and I transferred a file just fine on my first try
with no reconfiguration whatsoever.  I liked that they used such programs
as Arq.  I hope future CD32 utility CD's use more of such programs.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

Well, here we go....  I like to complain.  The first thing I noticed is it
seems they set up Workbench with nothing but the ugly, "blah" defaults that
no one likes.  The background is setup with a group of tiled NETWORK CD
pics that helps to steal the precious 2MB of Chip RAM that is very much
needed to run about any program you want to pull over the network.  The
only place to put programs pulled over the net is into the RAM: drive.
This means that the bigger the program, the less RAM that program has to
use.  This can be cured with the use of Virtual mounted drives (which
Sernet and Parnet allow); take note of my Envoy usage example.

The overscan is set so low (640x200) that is is hard to fit any windows on
the Workbench screen without cluttering things up a bit.  The colors are
all set a little blah, and the icons look to be simple 4-8 colors.

Something that really got to me was the configuration of the programs
included on the CD.  Terminus is set to open on the Public WB screen with
WB palette colors, and it isn't even the new version of Terminus!  They are
using Terminus 2.0 (latest is 2.0d I believe).  On the other hand, Ncomm is
setup the exact way I have my Terminus setup (color and preference wise). 
I suggest they put a little more work into setup of the programs on their
next version.  Although speaking with a salesmen on the phone at Northwest
PD, "Lock and Load 2" should be something very nice.

Another dislike is the fact that they are using a seriously old version of
Workbench 3.1.  The Palette preferences programs and several others
including Multiview are old and are missing several important features.

I am perhaps looking for too much out of this CD.  It is sold as a
networking CD, and I just would like a few things changed for user friendly
purposes.  There were a few little bugs in it, like the "slideshows" area.
They all default to pal, which may be fine for some people, but I find it
hard to watch a slide show while my TV rolls.  :)

I want a CD that is specially made for an AmigaDOS 3.1 AGA CD32.  This CD
is set up for any machine and it causes minor problems at times.  Hopefully
"Lock and Load 2" will do this.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

As for the CD32 cable, I can't compare it with much of anything else.  I
did own a SX-1 but sold it after being extremely disappointed with its
ugliness and performance.  This cable gives me at least the ability to run
AGA demos and utilities that I want to for $30.  The SX-1 stuck out of my
CD32 and made it look a little lame in my eyes.  I hope someone makes
another expansion box that perhaps fits under the CD32 and gives some
seriously faster serial and parallel ports.  If the CD32 had a mere floppy
port, I would be very happy.  :)


BUGS

There are a few minor bugs, but nothing of concern.  They used a separate
Workbench backdrop setting program instead of the standard WBPattern
program.  This can cause conflicts with some programs including WBPattern
and Font preferences, and the backdrop program itself can crash the machine
if you try to take away the picture.


VENDOR SUPPORT

Well I called Northwest PD and had a cool chat with someone (whose name I
forget) about a few CD32 topics and the CD he is working on: the "Lock And
Load 2".  We also talked about the jerk companies making CD32 games using
only 880K on the 650MB CD.  :) Overall, it's a friendly place and it did a
fine job with my order.  I never have dealt with "Weird Science" the actual
company that made the cable and the CD.  Don't think I would need to.


WARRANTY

Nothing mentioned, but from the nice way I was treated by NorthWest PD, I
am sure if anything was wrong with the cable or CD they would allow a free
trade for a good one.  At least I think so.  :)


CONCLUSIONS

Both of these are good products, I give the cable a nice "A" and the CD a
"B".  These are good solutions to a slow method of getting files to your
CD32 until something other than the SX-1 becomes available for a decent
price.

A quick ending note: Monday, I ordered 3 CD32s from DarkSoft computers.  
They were the ones going for $220 on the Internet.  I believe these are C=
liquidated.  I will be ordering another 2 CD32 Sernet cables and using the
CD32s as null modem computers and AGA toys.  I will be hooking them up to
1084s Monitors Via the SVHS port with a homemade cable.  These cheap
wonderful little machines will make for a lot of fun when I throw another
BBS party.  These will allow several users to jump online my BBS locally
for cheap...  yet another cool use of the CD32.  :)

===========================================================================

Review: The Deathbed Vigil

The Deathbed Vigil and other tales of digital angst is Dave Haynie's
documentary of the last days of Commodore US and International as they
knew it.  It consists of a 20 minute tour of the nearly bare West Chester,
PA plant and the people that remained in it days before the liquidation
began (oh so long ago).  It progresses to the "Last Layoff Party" at a
nearby bar, where scores of Commodorians had hung out for years.  It
progresses to the Deathbed Vigil Party at Randell Jesup's house, where
loads of stories pour out about the good and bad old days.  It culminates
in the ultimate act of condemnation: the spraypainting upon the Commodore
speedbumps of the people they blamed for the collapse of the once-mighty
computer company.

If I don't have you anxious to see the film, I haven't done a good job of
describing it yet.  The tour through Commodore: seeing the utter bareness
of what was once a 1,000+ employee complex with computers stacked to the
ceilings is depressing.  Seeing the people affected by these last days is
touching.  Reading Dave's editiorial screens, in which he describes a
series of "Where Things Went Wrong", from the story of how Commodore could
have made the 3000UX into an industry standard to the story of how Medhi
Ali twice blew a chance to sell the Amiga in Japan to the story of how the
3000+ was blown off by C= management to the 1200 and CD32 underproductions
is riveting.  Listening to the stories of ages past, when OS 2.0 kept
people at Commodore nearly 24 hours a day in an attempt to finish it was
amazing.  In short, it's a great way to get some sort of perspective about
just what was going on at Commodore for the past 7 or 8 years.

If you want to see What Went Wrong, see this movie.  If you want to see
the people that made the Amiga keep working all these years, see this
movie.  If you want to understand just what Commodore management was like,
see this movie.  If you just want to hear a bunch of really, really funny
stories (and a few that are amusing but not gutbusters), see this movie.

The movie isn't going to win any film industry awards.  The sound is at
times horribly trebled, some of the text-screens are mistyped and it wasn't
exactly cinematographed.  That wasn't what it was all about, though, and it
doesn't detract from the experience.

Sure, $35 ($40 PAL) IS a considerable chunk of change to pay for 2 hours of
film.  But the movie really is worth it if any of the above is important to
you.  It is also required viewing for anybody who thinks they can do it all
over again, and better...CEI, Commodore UK, I'm talking to you.

===========================================================================
== Review: Connect Your Amiga!                        By: @{"Jason Compton" link P8-1} ==
===========================================================================

Connect Your Amiga is Dale Larson's overview of networking, with a very
important angle on how it's done on our favorite machine.  The 256-page
book is hardly a step-by-step guide to setting up any sort of network you
might imagine, but it does what it is supposed to do, familiarizing the
reader with ways in which it can be done.  Dale worked for Commodore's
Netowrking Group (so the back cover's typo tells us), and his company, IAM,
sells Amiga Envoy and AS225, among other products.

The book does its job.  By no means dry, Dale initiates those who aren't in
the know as to what it's all about, and at the same time tells those in the
know (either previously or as a result of his overview) how it can be done.
He covers faxing and EtherNet all the way up to Wide Area Networks, with
such products as AmiLink inbetween.  There's even a few generous references
to Amiga Report, although it's mainly because he printed a ton of BBS and
online service information from us.

Larson really does what he set out to do.  I know more about networking and
doing it on the Amiga than I did before.  It certainly didn't make me a
pro, and I'm still silent on IRC #amiga when people walk on asking loads of
questions about AmiTCP.  As a reference and product guide, as well as a
tutorial, it excels.

Be prepared for a wee bit of sticker shock: Dale asks $25 for the book, and
it's tough at times to figure out if it's worth it.  Again: if you're
looking for a networking reference that's going to involve your Amiga, it's
a book you want.  But for the ultra-casual reader, or for someone who
doesn't need more than, say, fax software, reviews in magazines would
probably suffice.

If you need to be in the know, you'll want this book.  But don't rush out
to buy it simply because it's one of the few Amiga books being published
these days.  (I'm wondering if the price results from the large amount of
work Dale put into making the copyright page fun to read.  Never before
have disclaimers made me laugh as much.)

For the trivia buffs: Except for the cover, the book was written in Final
Copy II.  He did quite a good job with it, too, even if the spell checker
missed a couple.

    - THE PRIZE FOR NEXT MONTH -

CONTEST BEGINS: 9-13-94
CONTEST ENDS: 11-13-94

The Amiga Report contest is still going on, and it is not too
late to enter. This ongoing monthly contest allows Amiga Report
readers a chance to win software by either solving a puzzle or by
entering a random drawing.

The prize this month is the Amiga/Toaster Reference Manual v2.221,
from Area52. This is a 1,000 page help system for the Amiga and Video
Toaster, covering the Workbench, AmigaDOS, Lightwave, and more ($34.95).

The second prize choice is the FutureShock audio CDROM,  which was
produced using Amiga computers by SideWinder. There are some Sidewinder
music modules on Aminet that you may want to look at for a sample of
the audio CD ($12.95).

Another possible prize is SubVersion, a strategy submarine hunt
game by Point of View Computing. Both a Mac and IBM version is included
along with the Amiga version.

FOCUS GbR has made available graphicRECALL, its interactive multimedia
database. Designed for catagorizing and accessing large databases of
images, texture maps, anims, and audio.

Walnut Creek has also dontated 5 copies of the AMINET CD-ROM, which
contains approximately 4000 files from the AMINET FTP sites.

Previously we have offered the ARexx Reference Disk by Merrill
Callaway, which was awarded to a previous winner. Contact Whitestone
for more information (505) 268-0678. More prizes will be announced
as they become available.

All monthly contests end on the dates listed above. Any entries beyond
this date will be entered into the next contest. In the event that you
were announced as a winner and did not receive your prize, please contact
me by email.


- THE MONTHLY DRAWING -

To enter the random drawing, select a number from 1 to 262,144
and send it to me at one of my addresses listed below, either by
the postal service or email through the Internet.
Also, you may enter by solving the following puzzle. The winner
of this puzzle will be decided within the same time frame as the
random prize, to allow the contest information to filter through the
networks, and to allow your letters and postcards to come in.


- THE PUZZLE -

Two cars are racing on a race track. Each car is traveling in an
opposite direction (they aren't too bright). The cars eventually
collide with each other. One suffers damage to the windshield as
it gets hit. The other driver flies out the side openning on his
car because the netting was damaged.

The first car, a Formula 1 racer, has its windshield replaced. The
second car has its netting replaced. What kind of car is the second
car, and why?


- TO ENTER -

To enter, simply let your fingers do the talking and write an
email and send it to dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu. You MUST put
the word CONTEST in the subject line of the email header! Otherwise
you run the risk of having your email deleted (don't ask, it is a
long story!) or send a post card or letter to:

Amiga Report Contest
c/o David Tiberio
6 Lodge Lane
East Setauket, NY 11733

Is it possible to win via snail mail? You might think that your
chances of winning are better by entering in email (much faster of
course), but last month's winner send in a letter that arrived the
day before his winning number was drawn!

In your letter or email, please provide the following:

Your full name and address. Please keep in mind that many of
you may have addresses that I am not accustomed to, so please include
your country or any other information that I would need in case you
win. An email address should also be included, if possible.

You must also include a brief one sentence overview of the editorial
in this issue of Amiga Report. Just to make sure you are reading it. :)
You must also include the issue number. For example, if you read this in
AR213, then include that in your correspondance. Also, a prize winner
will be determined by a random number generator. Choose a number from
1 to 262,144. The closest winner or winners to the randomly generated
number will receive the prize in the mail. Anyone who does not provide
a number will have one assigned to him randomly.

All prizes will be mailed within one week after I get my hands on
the published version of AmigaReport. I am doing this for a few reasons.
First, every winner so far has given the correct puzzle solution before
I have received the editon of AmigaReport that announced it. :)
Second, I don't like to go to the post office every day if I can avoid
it. Third, you never know when someone's power supply might blow up
(right Mr. Editor?!).


- RULES AND REGULATIONS -

1. In the evnt that the editor's power supply fries, the contest for
   that month will have its deadline postponed to a later date, to be
   announced. Any contest entries for the random drawing will be added
   to the next month's drawing, to be held once per month near the
   beginning of the month.

2. All prizes are donated. I cannot be held responsible for any damage
   caused by a prize. For example, if you leave your prize on the
   stairs and your grandmother slips on it, I will not pay her medical
   bills.

3. We are not doing this for any profit, and cannot be held responsible
   if we go out of business or are otherwise financially unable to give
   you anything! We are actively looking for submissions from other
   software authors.

4. Good things come to those who read the rules and regulations! Here
   is a tip to help you win: every problem is a trick problem, or gives
   you clues that are not part of the problem itself. Read the whole
   entire contest entry looking for clues. And read my other articles
   for more clues. I give some very obvious clues :).

5. If for any circumstance you are awarded a prize but do not receive
   it, contact me at (516) 476-1615. I will promptly attend to any
   mistakes that have been made.

6. These rules are subject to change at any time without warning!

7. The company that publishes Art Department skipped the key information.


- THE DISCLAIMER -

DISCLAIMER: This contest is being provided as a service to the
Amiga community and all persons involved in running this contest
cannot be held liable for anything that costs you money or
lifetime pain and anguish. Rules are subject to change. All entries
must be received by whenever TBA. Any entries beyond this date
will be entered into the next contest, if any.


- THE CHANCE YOU WILL WIN -

Odds of winning are approximately 1:50 for the random drawing and
1:5 for the correct answer to the puzzle, based upon current entries.

SPECIAL THANKS to SideWinder for donating the Future Shock albums
for inclusion in our contest, along with Merrill Callaway for his ARexx
Reference Disk! SubVersion is donated by Point of View, and graphicRECALL

AUTHOR

     Andreas M. Kirchwitz
     E-Mail: elm-fan@zikzak.in-berlin.de

DESCRIPTION

     AmigaElm is an "Electronic Mail Reader" which allows you to read and
     write mails.  Normally you'll need a properly installed UUCP package
     (eg,AmigaUUCP, Feulner-UUCP or Dillon-UUCP) to reveive and send mails
     but AmigaElm is highly configurable so that you can take a mail-folder
     from a UNIX box, answer the mails and bring the answers back to the
     UNIX box.

     AmigaElm is easy to install and to use.  The user interface is very
     intuitive and similar to the well-known UNIX-ELM.  Beginners can
     control all basic functions with menus and some nice GadTools
     requesters.  Advanced users can use aliases, priorized message
     tagging, various filename-offers when saving messages and lots of
     options to configure AmigaElm to fit your needs.  In a system with
     multiple users AmigaElm allows separate configuration files for each
     user.

     AmigaElm can be invoked in a special "terminal mode" (all input/output
     from/to console).  This is useful for running AmigaElm in the current
     shell window or over a serial line (eg, with AUX-Handler).

     AmigaElm offers basic internal MIME (multimedia mail) functionality
     (eg, sending 8-bit-texts and binaries over 7-bit-lines) and supports
     "MetaMail" (a full-featured package for handling all kinds of MIME
     messages -- also available on AmiNet, see section "HOST NAME") and
     "ReqTools" library 2.x (reqtools.library is included).

     AmigaElm is one of the very first mail readers that has in-built
     support for cryptographic applications, namely PGP.  Henceforth,
     AmigaElm improves your privacy and general living quality
     significantly.

NEW FEATURES

     Changes since version 3:  (summary)

     Enhancements to reply-commands (group-reply, new extended group-
     reply) and encryption/decryption (new scripts, user can set default
     encryption mode, 3 predefined and 3 custom encryption modes).

     New sorting criterion, palette settings support up to 32-Bit-Colors,
     can skip over deleted messages, new config file .elm/smartsignature
     (similar to .elm/smartheader), cleaned up documentation on some
     commands, fixed nasty bug with option -f (FOLDER), smarter handling of
     domainized HOSTNAME, non-empty DOMAINNAME and DOMAINNAME in general.

     Very intelligent get-char-handling when started in terminal mode (Elm
     now accepts break signal when in terminal mode); thanks to Ralph
     Babel. Also supports file notification when in terminal mode. [...]

     No longer needs env-var LINES/COLUMNS for terminal mode when
     connected to Amiga terminal.

     Various other enhancements to existing commands. Some new commands.
     Miscellaneous bug fixes.

     (see file "History.Txt" for details)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     AmigaOS 2.0 (or higher)

     And for normal usage: a properly installed UUCP package.  But can be

DESCRIPTION
    
    AmigaBase is a powerful programmable database with its own graphical
    user interface.

    AmigaBase is not a relational database with SQL interface or something
    like this.  Nevertheless, or just because, AmigaBase is ideal for
    managing music cassettes, videos, addresses, etc.  Complex applications
    like a finance manager with automatic printing of transfer forms and
    writing client accounts is no problem for AmigaBase, too.

    AmigaBase knows of the following data types: BOOLEAN (boolean values),
    CHOICE (one item out of many items), INTEGER (integer values), REAL 
    (floating point values), STRING (any text), DATE (date values), TIME
    (time values), and MEMO (unlimited multi line text).

    For more information see the ReadMe file in the archive.

NEW FEATURES since Version 1.31:

   o  Full font sensitive
   o  OS 3.0 look
   o  Iconification of windows.
   o  Improved memory management
   o  Arexx port
   o  Copy & paste
   o  New variable type: CHOICE
   o  MEMO variables with their own window
   o  Improved text editor.
   o  Enabled use of an external editor
   o  Shortcuts for variables
   o  Improved preferences settings (project dependent/independent)
   o  Formats for date and floating point values.
   o  Stack overflow handler and ctrl-c checking
   o  Save & load of filter programs
   o  Font attributes, background color and borders for all variable types.
   o  New program types: PreNewDataset, PostNewDataset, PreDeleteDataset,
      PostDeleteDataset and Functions.
   o  Many new functions and improvements for programming AmigaBase
   o  Many bug fixes

DESCRIPTION

     gage_cs220.device is a driver for the CompuScope 220 ISA Digital 
     Oscilloscope board from Gage Scientific.  With this driver and a
     GoldenGate 2 or GG2+ ISA/ZorroII bus bridge, you can use the CS220
     on an Amiga. 

     The driver allows access to nearly all features of the hardware,
     including dual channel sampling at up to 20MHz, and single channel up
     to 40MHz.

     A demo disk is available.  The demo disk contains gage_null.device, a
     demonstration and test version of the driver that doesn't require a
     CS220 or even an ISA/Zorro bus bridge.  It simulates the operation of
     the gage_cs220.device and provides the same interface, and allows
     development of software for gage_cs220.device when hardware is not
     available.  Since gage_cs220.device is a binddrivers-style device, and
     since gage_null.device is based on much of the same code, the
     gage_null.device is also a binddrivers style device and must be bound
     to an autoconfiguring board on your system.  However, gage_null.device
     doesn't actually access the board it is bound to, so it is safe to
     bind the driver to any unbound board on your system.  A ram expansion
     board is a good candidate. 

     The disk also contains the full autodocs and headers necessary to 
     program for the gage_cs220.device, and to allow you to get a feel for
     the capabilities of the real driver.  Or, with the gage_null.device,
     you can develop complete applications for the CS220 without having the
     hardware or driver available. 

     See the file README.DataWeb on the demo disk for information on the
     DataWeb, a complete scientific data acquisition and processing
     environment that can be used with the gage_cs220.device.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Amiga 2000, 3000, or 4000 with OS 2.0 or later.  See the section
     titled 'OTHER' for a special note about the A3000.

     A CompuScope 220 ISA Digital Oscilloscope board (naturally).

     A GoldenGate 2 or GG2+ ISA/ZorroII bus bridge.

OTHER

     The CS220 board will not work in an A3000 as-is.  It draws too much
     power on start-up and prevents the 3000's power supply from coming up.
     It works fine on 2000s, 3000Ts, and 4000s, but not the standard 3000.
     Gage can provide a modified board that works around the problem, or
     you can modify your own.  Please contact us for details. 

     The driver has only been tested with the 32K board model, but should
     work with the other small (<512K) models.  It may not work without
     additional work on the large models.  I am unable to test this without
     access to a large-memory card.

     If you need a driver for other Gage Scientific hardware or require
     features not supported in the current CS220 driver (for example,
     non-automatic software triggering, or large-memory cards), please
     contact us.  We may be able to help.

     EazyBBS (Mailbox)

VERSION

     2.17

AUTHOR

     Andreas M. Kirchwitz

     E-Mail: amk@zikzak.in-berlin.de

DESCRIPTION
           
     EazyBBS is a Unix/Uucp-like BBS (Bulletin Board System) (aka Mailbox)
     with UUCP network support for multiple users on multiple ports.

     Multi-language support for input, output and commands. Configurable
     commands, online help for every command.  Extremely fast VT102
     emulation.  Full-screen editor, full-screen input/output masks,
     full-screen file lister, full-screen chat, line chat.  Online games
     (Greed, Sokoban, Global War).

     Z-Modem (xprzmodem.library) and X-Modem (builtin).  Comfortable
     Batch-Download and Batch-Upload.  AmiNet-like .readme files
     (containing file data) for upload and download.

     Thread-oriented message system. Binary mails. Personal newstree for
     every user, automatically shows new messages and files in subscribed
     boards and file-areas. Checks integrity of archives and lists contents
     of archives (highly configurable). CRC checksums to verify correct
     file transfer.

     Handles cursor-keys. Builtin support for "Umlaute", configurable
     Umlaute conversion after upload and before download. Builtin pager,
     users can edit their personal configuration easily.

     Commands, filenames, boards, file-areas can be abbreviated.
     AmigaDOS pattern-matching for various commands.

     EazyBBS runs on own screen or in window (on any public screen).
     Fonts configurable.  No wimpy GUI, no fancy gadgets... everything's
     done with VT102 masks (quite comfortable), perfect for remote
     maintenance.

     Configurable for any modem, ISDN board and multi I/O card.

     Can be started from Uucp-getty (on already established connection).

     Access to boards and file-areas can be restricted to certain users
     (Unix-like owner/group concept), every group may have one or more
     moderators. Optionally, all upload may be unaccessable by default,
     then checked by the moderators and unlocked (if okay).

     Very flexible import of peripherals (eg, CD-ROMs or any other
     devices).  Certain files and directories can be excluded.
     Directories can be archived and transferred in one file (program
     configurable, size check... configurable).
     
     EazyBBS is comfortable but has no full-blown GUI. If the Workbench
     is your home and you even don't know how to spell the word "Shell"
     then EazyBBS is maybe not for you. But if you can handle a shell
     and if you like sophisticated software -- then you'll like EazyBBS ;)

     German support BBS with discussion boards, also available via UUCP.

NEW FEATURES

     Changes since version 2.15 (summary):

      - new script to create nice file-lists for Anonymous UUCP
      - resets DOS date of imported files so that (date based) recent-list
         for Anon-UUCP will work
      - fixed bug in recognizing AmiNet-like Readme-Files with ".desc"
         extension (from munpack)
      - "MB_DATA:LogoutProg" renamed to "MB_DATA:HangupProg",
         new "MB_DATA:LoginProg" and "MB_DATA:LogoutProg"
      - layout of log-files changed for easier usage of "awk"
      - workaround for FileSystem-bug (if you had lots of Readme files
         when importing/uploading files, some of them were ignored)
      - command "edit config" now allows to change realname, address
         and phone number
      - various changes/enhancements to existing commands
      - bug fixes

     See file "History.Txt" in archive EazyBBS-2.17.lha for
     complete listing of changes and new features.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     AmigaOS 2.0 (or higher).

TITLE

     GFFT

VERSION

     1.12

AUTHOR

     Charles P. Peterson  (Charles_P_Peterson@fcircus.sat.tx.us)

DESCRIPTION

     GFFT is an audio spectrum analysis program with many features.  By
     operating from stored sound sample files, it can provide high
     resolution and accuracy, and has no specific CPU performance
     requirement.

     Audio spectrum analysis allows you to see the frequency content of a
     sound file and how it varies over time.  This can be used to help
     understand sounds such as acoustical instruments and speech,
     and also to evaluate and adjust loudspeakers and other sound
     reproducing equipment.  

     GFFT accepts 8, 12, or 16-bit data in in IFF 8SVX, AIFF, and AVR
     formats, or in unformatted files.  It can also accept data points
     entered through a console in floating-point.  The number of frequency
     bins and smoothing points is limited only by available memory; there
     is no limit to the length of the sound data which can be analyzed and
     averaged.

     Both a Workbench GUI and a CLI interface are provided.  There is
     built-in help for both interfaces using a help file that can also be
     read as a user manual.

     High quality spectrum plots can be produced on screen, plotter, or
     printer, or saved to Postscript or TeX files.  Spectral data can also
     be output in text form to a console or file.
     
     GFFT can perform a 2D (Amplitude vs Frequency) or 3D (Amplitude vs
     Frequency vs Time) analysis.  It allows the selection of logarithmic X
     and/or Y axes, the dB scaling of X, and arbitrary 3D rotation.  It can
     show multiple spectra in the same plot, or append spectral data bands
     from earlier sessions.

     There are 8 selectable data window types, including Blackman-Harris 92
     dB, which has very low sidelobe artifacts.  A special weighting can be
     applied for pink noise testing.  Smoothing, calibration, ranging, and
     quantization are also available.

HOST NAME

     GFFT is available for anonymous FTP on Aminet sites such as 
     ftp.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4).

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Workbench 1.3 (V34) or higher and 1.5M total RAM.  Will run on some
     systems with 1M RAM with reduced capabilities.  Recommended: Workbench
     2.0 (V37) or higher, 3M or more RAM, and harddrive or second floppy.
     Larger amounts of memory will enable you to analyze using more
     frequency bins.

     Gnuplot 3.0 or higher is required; Gnuplot 3.4 or higher is required
     for the Hidden3D feature (only).  Gnuplot is available on Aminet (see
     below for an example) and on some Fish disks and CD-ROMs.

DESCRIPTION

     IBG Browser is a simple and fast viewer for the images contained
     on the cd-rom set: "Voyager to the Outer Planets" by NASA.
     Because of the moltitude of images present on the NASA cd-roms
     for one man is very hard to see all of them in one life.
     There are at least 12 full cd-rom of the probe Voyager images,
     the majority of which, stored in the PDS compressed format, but
     at the end of every subset of images (ie Saturn subset, etc)
     there are the "best of" stored in the IBG format (directory
     /BROWSE/ of the each cd-rom). So this program is useful to "fish"
     in the sea of images the preferred one in IBG format and then get
     the original image in the PDS compressed format.


     IBG Browser is easy to use and it can:

     - display the image (obviously)
     - show the image histogram
     - report the image information (tech data and so on)

     and in addiction it's possible to change the colors of the image
     so to put in evidence unexpected details. There are three options:

     - full gray scale
     - standard false colors
     - spectrum colors

    Originally intended to be an online newsletter, I opted to make
this a general server of Amiga-related information with an emphasis on
OVAUG members' contributions. Most of the submissions are reviews,
artwork, and articles on everything from art and design with the Amiga
to technical articles. Therefore, this site is not just to serve OVAUG
members, but it is for all Amiga users.

TITLE

   SCRIPT:

VERSION 

   1.1

AUTHOR

   Richard Rogers
   rrogers@cs.washington.edu

DESCRIPTION

   SCRIPT: is an AmigaDOS device that gives the Amiga the 
   functionality of the "script" command in UNIX.  SCRIPT: is
   actually more general, in that it can echo the I/O passing 
   through any AmigaDOS device to any other device, including 
   itself.

   For those of you not familiar with UNIX, the script command 
   causes the "screen" input and output to be saved to a file 
   (which is frequently then printed).  This is useful for 
   things like demonstrating to your professor that your program
   works correctly.  It's like a terminal program's capture or
   buffer feature, only for the shell.

   On the Amiga, the command shell can use any device (usually CON:).
   Some Workbench programs allow you to specify the device they use
   via the WINDOW tooltype.  Setting WINDOW to SCRIPT: allows you
   to script programs run from Workbench.  SCRIPT: captures the I/O
   going through any device and echos it to any other device. 
   Echoing to the SCRIPT: device itself allows you to echo the I/O
   to several devices at once.

                            UUEncoding/Decoding
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
             (thanks to Bob Tomasevich for the quick tutorial)


What is uuencoding and uudecoding?
----------------------------------
uuencoding is converting a binary file into text (ASCII) which can be sent
through mail or Usenet.  uudecoding is reversing the process (e.g.
converting the file back to binary).


Why would I want to do this?
----------------------------
You have to send a binary file to a user who does not have FTP access, or
the user is too lazy to FTP the file.


What is the normal procedure?
-----------------------------
1. Convert the binary file into ASCII, using uuencode.
2. Send the file, through email, to the user.
3. The person on the receiving end gets the email, which may be split into
   parts.  If the email is split into parts, the parts must be combined,
   in the order received, into one file.
4. Receiving person converts the file back into binary, using uudecode.


What does a uuencoded file look like?
-------------------------------------
The start always has:

    begin 644 <encoded file's name>

So, for the file happy-happy-joy-joy.txt, it would look like:

    begin 644 happy-happy-joy-joy.txt

The encoded file begins right after:

M1TE&.#=A@`+@`9<````$`*QB15=2.+&/@R(Y)XM8.=J]H+*%7BL6#8]F6EP_]
M*$=E5"L?L-Z8A-:#60\@$,9P27-4-YB#;4HY)U!L9KZNE\O"O["#;8]82SDF>
M&[%J4FI',.&:E`48#="4@SE41M61<R`@%R$\,9:.?&!Z=NWM_\V';H-D1TI`=

.. more lines like the above ..

M>(`)N(`-^(`1.($5>($9N($=^($A.((E>((IN((M^((Q.(,U>(,YN(,]^(-!+
&V"\"`@`[&
``
end              <-- the end of the encoded file
size 151341      <-- size of the original file


So, how would I do this on the Amiga?
-------------------------------------
There are many uuencode/decode variants out there, but most usually have
kept the old UNIX command line, which can be confusing to novices, or,
require you to remove all mail headers and other, non-uuencoded text.

Luckily, Asher Feldman took the time to write UUxt.


What is UUxT?
-------------
It is a program which performs both the uuencode/decode operations in one
executable, AND, can also pack/unpack LhA archives.


Tell me more.
-------------
The UUxT archive contains UUxT, the CLI version, and UUxtGUI, the Workbench
interface.  I will give a short summary of how to use both.  Detailed
instructions are included in the UUxT archive.

CLI Version:
------------

  Running UUxT without any options gives the following:

     UUxT Version 2.1a Copyright (c)1993 Asher Feldman
     USAGE: UUxT [option] [archive name] <LhA archive name> <file(s)>
     options: a - encode           l - LhAencode
              x - decode           u - LhAdecode

  showing the format of the command line and the valid options.


  Some example command lines:

  1. Normal encoding - UUxt a filename.uue filename-to-archive

  2. Normal decoding - UUxt x filename.uue

  3. LhA archiving and encoding -

            UUxT l filename.uue filename.lha file1 file2 ...

  4. Decoding and LhA unarchiving - UUxT u filename.uue

  For LhA encoding and decoding, you will need LhA by Stefan Boberg.

  (1) Clicking on this brings up a requester to select the file you want to
         perform the operation shown in gadget (5).
  (2) You can manually type here the filename of the file affected by the
         operation indicated in gadget (5).
  (3) Used only for encoding, brings up a requester to select where the
         encoded file should go.  Selecting an existing file will cause the
         existing file to be replaced by the encoded file.  You can also
         use this requester to create directories.
  (4) You can manually type the filename of the file to be the encoded file.
  (5) The operation to perform on file shown in (2).  The operations are
         the four provided by UUxT (uuencode/uudecode/LhAEncode/LhADecode).
  (6) The name of the archive created with the LhAEncode option.  Ignored
         when any other operation is selected.
  (7) Does the encode/decode/LhAEncode/LhADecode and pops up a requester
         indicating if the operation was successful or not.


I need this!  Where can I get it?
---------------------------------
If you use the Internet from a local BBS, you may find it there.  If not
you can FTP it from wuarchive.wustl.edu, in the directory

                          pub/aminet/arc/UUxT.lha

It should also be on the Aminet mirrors.

Thanks for the explanation!  How can I reach you if I have questions?

==                Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users                 ==
===========================================================================


                The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
          -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-
service online SIG (Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users.

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in various ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA area banks of high-speed modems (you pay for the
phone call if it's not local), or though any SprintNet indial anywhere in
the USA, (with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell account.  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help and you can easily customize
it for your terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1000 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
      once, of any size, with one command.
 * Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, Elastic
      Reality (ASDG), Soft-Logik, Apex Publishing, and others.
 * 38 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 10,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.
 * Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
      related and get quick replies from the experts.
 * Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, EGS, Picasso,
      OpalVision & others feed right into the Zone message bases.  Read
      months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with them.
 * FREE unlimited Internet Email with 5 meg of free storage.
 * A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.
 * Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which you can read
      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine.
 * Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
      never worry "Ooops... Am I paying for this area?" again!
 * The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)  An 
      entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  And you get FREE unlimited
      usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
      email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
 * Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
      at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
