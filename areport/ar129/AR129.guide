/// From the Editor's Desk                        "Saying it like it is!"
    ----------------------



The next generation of video game wars is on!  The 3DO is officially out,
the CD32 is out in Europe, and due out anyday now in the US, and Atari's
Jaguar should be appearing in New York, Los Angeles, Dallas and London
real soon now.

If the marketing of Commodore's and Atari's' entries are any good, the
3DO won't have a prayer.  How does a $699 machine compete with a $399
CD32 and $199 Jaguar ($399 after you add the optional CD ROM drive)?
Both Atari and Commodore have signed some good names to make games.
Interplay, a well-known game maker that had signed up for 3DO develop-
ment, took a look at the Jaguar and its developer documentation, and
quickly declared the Jaguar to be superior to 3DO in every respect.
Word has it that they may not even be a 3DO developer anymore.

While the CD32 isn't as advanced as Atari's 64-bit RISC-based Jaguar,
or Panasonic's 32-bit RISC-based 3DO, it has the advantage of (1) a
reasonable price, and (2) a standard CD ROM drive.  This means that it's
likely to be the machine of choice for MPEG movies.  Just add the optional
MPEG board, and you're ready to watch all those movies that are being
ported to the compact disc format.  I think owners of laser disc players
are going to be upset when their format is abandoned in another year or
so.  <g>

This week is Chad Freeman's birthday (Happy Birthday, Chad!), so he's
taken the week off from his A.M.I.G.A. column.  Jason Compton has also
decided to take a break this week, so our big treat is the conference with
Jim Drew on Delphi, the maker of Emplant.

That's it for this week!

    -----------------



    ANOTHER VIDEO GAME CONTENDER - It is rumored that 3DO Co. will soon 
 move into the video game market.  Sources say that 3DO's Interactive 
 Multiplayer unit is, "faster and more powerful than game machines now on 
 the market". Much attention has been focused on the 3DO system "because 
 of its ability to combine video, audio, text and graphics."
  
    One problem that the 3DO system has to overcome is the few games that 
 will be available for it through Christmas.  Sources say that "customer 
 decisions on machine purchases usually are based on what games can be 
 played on those machines ... and so far, the software selection for 3DO 
 is slim."
  
    The manufacturer says 10 to 20 games will be available for Christmas 
 sales, though more than 150 games are under development.
  
  
    PEN COMPUTER OFFERS WIRELESS NETWORKING CAPABILITIES - Fujitsu Per-
 sonal Systems Inc. has announced the PadPlus RF, one of the industry's 
 first mobile computers with fully-integrated wireless communications 
 technology.  The PadPlus RF is a pen-based mobile computer that allows 
 transparent wireless client/server and peer-to-peer LAN communications.
  
    The PadPlus RF incorporates Proxim Inc.'s RangeLAN wireless adapter 

 and radio into its enclosed housing, with a retractable antenna in the 
 upper left corner. The PadPlus RF has the same form-factor and func-
 tionality as the PoqetPad Plus.
  
    The PadPlus RF features a communications range of up to 300 feet with 
 interference immunity made possible by the spread spectrum technology. 
 The PadPlus RF has a burst data rate of 242Kbps and provides users with 
 three full channels. With error correcting hardware and firmware desig-
 ned to retransmit undelivered data, users will be sure that data is 
 never lost or corrupted.
  
    The PadPlus RF is available immediately through FPSI systems 
 integrators and VARs. Preliminary pricing for the PadPlus RF is $2,449.
  
  
    HP CUTS VECTRA PRICES - Word from Los Angeles is Hewlett-Packard Co. 
 is cutting prices of selected Vectra personal computers by up to 14%.
  
  
    APPLE BIG IN ASIA-PACIFIC - Apple Computer Inc.'s bottom line is 
 being given a boost by a tremendous boom in the personal computer market 
 in Asia, according to a top company executive.  Reports say that sales 
 of the major Macintosh and PowerBook product lines are higher than the 
 rate of market growth.

    "Our Asia-Pacific business is growing at a rate of around 50 percent" 
 annually, said Randy Battat, vice president of Apple's Macintosh desktop 
 and PowerBook division.


    IBM AND PHILIPS UNVEIL OPTICAL DISK DRIVE - Philips Electronics NV 
 and IBM Corp. announced they have formed a joint venture to develop 
 affordably-priced optical disk drives for the computer market. The 3.5-
 inch IBM MTA-3127 optical disk drive is the first in a series of 
 products aimed at a market for small, high-capacity drives.
  
    "We are aiming at a very big market share, by far the biggest," said 
 Philips spokesman Jack Reemers. He explained the disk drive market is 
 currently worth $250 million annually, but forecasts it will grow 
 rapidly to more than $1 billion.
  
  
    INTEL CORP. ANNOUNCES '386 CHIP FOR EMBEDDED PROCESSING MARKET - A 
 new line of '386 chips intended for the embedded processing market will 
 be available in volume in the second quarter of next year, Intel Corp. 
 says.
  
    The embedded market includes microwave ovens, consumer electronics, 
 copiers, facsimile machines, telecommunications and other devices in 
 which the tasks are more limited than those of microchip-based PCs.
  
  
    NEW CHIP SPEEDS UP GRAPHICS PROCESSING 30 TIMES - Samples of chips 
 that are said to process graphics 30 times faster than current tech-
 nology are being sold in samples by Toshiba Corp.
  
    Toshiba officials said the LSI (large-scale integration) chip is 
 capable of processing 150,000 polygons -- the basic building blocks of 
 computer graphics -- per second, compared with 5,000 per second for 
 computer graphics workstations now on the market.
   
  
    FUJITSU AND HYUNDAI TO JOINTLY PRODUCE CHIPS - Fujitsu and Hyundai 
 Electronic Industries Co. announced they will jointly produce computer 
 memory chips. Manufacturing will take place in the Hyundai factory in 
 Inchon, South Korea, as well as in Fujitsu's plants in northern Japan 
 and Gresham, Ore. The two companies also said they are considering 
 jointly developing more advanced chips.
  
  
    APPLE DENIES TEXAS MOVE IS IN THE WORKS - Apple Computer is once 
 again denying rumors that say the firm will move some of its operations 
 to Austin, Texas.  The company did say, however, that it was planning on 
 moving some of its operations out of California's Silicon Valley.
  
  
    MEGAHERTZ CUTS MODEM COSTS - Megahertz Corp. has reduced prices by as 
 much as 38% on its PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International 
 Association) modems.  The price reductions include those on modems with 
 the company's patented XJACK connector system.
  
    Those reduced in price range from the XJ1144 14,400/14,400bps data/ 
 fax w/XJACK (reduced to $399 from $599) to the CC324FM 2400/9600bps 
 data/fax (to $239 from $379).
  
  
    ASTRONAUTS TO TEST COMPUTER - The helpfulness of an "intelligent" 
 computer called the Astronaut Science Advisor is to be tested later this 
 month on the next space shuttle mission. The system was designed "to 
 help space travelers increase their productivity and improve the 
 scientific quality of data they collect".
  
    Experts at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., say 
 that the computer has four major functions:
    -:- Diagnosis and trouble-shooting of experiment equipment.
    -:- Data collection.
    -:- Management of experimental procedures.
    -:- Detection of "interesting" information.
  
    "Scientists hope the nonhuman assistant will enhance the crew's abi-
 lity to perform science experiments and reduce reliance on air-to-ground 
 communications," sources said. "If it does, it can play a critical part 
 on longer missions and the space station."
  
  
    NO JAIL TIME FOR 'NASA CRACKER' -- An Australian computerist who
 authorities say shut down some NASA computers for 24 hours in a 1990
 system intrusion has avoided jail time.
  
    In Melbourne, the 22-year-old Nahshon Even-Chaim was sentenced to 12 
 months' jail but was freed immediately by the judge on a good behavior 
 bond.
  
    Judge Anthony Smith warned Even-Chaim, who was known in his 
 underground computing circles as "Friend," that he may have to serve the 
 sentence if he breached the $1,000 bond over the coming year. Smith also 
 ordered Even-Chaim to carry out 500 hours of unpaid community work over 
 the next two years.
  
  
    WORDPERFECT CORP. SETTLES SUITS - WordPerfect Corp. says it has set-
 tled lawsuits against a Canadian bulletin board system operator and a 
 Texas beta-tester it accused of illegally copying and distributing beta 
 versions of its new WordPerfect 6.0 word processor.

    A statement from the company says the software was first found on a 
 BBS called "California Dreamin" located in Toronto. It was then traced 
 to a beta-tester in Texas, the company said.
  
    "Under court authority," says the statement, "U.S. marshals and Royal 
 Canadian Mounted Police, together with company representatives, con-
 fiscated computer equipment and unauthorized copies of the program from 
 the electronic bulletin board operator and from the beta-test site."

    This was WordPerfect Corp.'s first direct action against a beta-
 tester, though the publisher previously has taken actions against pirate 
 BBSes through the Business Software Alliance of which WordPerfect Corp. 
 is a founding member.

SysLog 1.7 Available for FTP


TITLE

     SysLog -- Amiga system log daemon

VERSION

     Version 1.7

AUTHOR

         The original author is unknown. However, Amiga specific stuff,
     enhancements and docs by Peter Simons <simons@peti.GUN.de>.

DESCRIPTION

         SysLog is a set of subroutines designed to help you to debug
     your programs. Several concepts for debugging output exist (one of
     them is the debug.lib, released by Commodore) and all of them have
     a few advantages and disadvantages.

         SysLog consists of two parts: A link library, containing the
     routines your programm should call, and a daemon, handling the
     debugging output. If your program jumps into the log-routine, an
     exec message is sent to the daemon's port and control is handed
     back to the program immediatly. The daemon will receive the message
     and will print it out to the standard output it has been started
     from or to one or more logfiles. Thanks to this concept, the
     to-be-debugged program does not have to perform the logging itself.

         The big advantage of SysLog is that all programs compiled with
     the debugging information use one logfile/output for their messages
     in cronological order. So, you can exactly determine what happened in
     what order.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Sneak Preview of My First Monthly CD-ROM Disk
   (Fred Fish -- 10/7/93)


Because I am getting close to the point of being ready generate the master
for the first monthly CD-ROM, I figured this was a good time to let people
know what it's status is, and provide a sneak preview of what the disk can
be expected to contain.  I don't expect any major changes at this point, so
this information ought to pretty accurately reflect what the actual CD-ROM
will contain.  There's a lot of info in this message, so here is a quick
summary:

    * This first CD-ROM represents the efforts of two people working
 almost full time for more than a month.

    * I've moved, so I have a new address and phone number.

    * I'm expecting to have shipable CD-ROM's about Oct 20th or so.

    * The CD-ROM will contain the contents of floppy disks 600-930.

    * The CD-ROM contains 84Mb of new material, 150Mb of useful tools
 including gcc 2.4.5, emacs 18.59, PasTex, etc, and 404 Mb of
 material from old floppy distributions.

    * All of the source to the supplied GNU binaries is provided and
 has been personally used by me to build the supplied binaries,
 using the GNU compiler on this CD-ROM (except GNU emacs).

    * You must order *now* if you wish to reserve a copy.

    * The next monthly CD-ROM will be due out about the last week
 in November or the first week in December.


I'VE MOVED
----------

Because I had to spend a couple weeks at the end of September moving to a
new residence, my schedule for the first monthly CD-ROM has slipped by
about that amount.  I'm currently projecting releasing the master to
production about Oct 15th, and having shippable CD-ROM's shortly after
that.  I've been told it should only take a few days to do the actual
CD-ROM production.

Note that my address and phone number have changed.  The new contact
information is:

 Amiga Library Services
 610 N. Alma School Road, Suite 18
 Chandler, AZ  85224-3687
 U.S.A.

 voice/FAX:  (602) 917-0917


STRUCTURE OF THE CD-ROM
-----------------------

The current structure of the CD-ROM closely follows the initial concept for
the monthly CD-ROM's, being divided into roughly three sections: (1) New
material, which includes the material from the new unreleased floppy disks
as well as material which does not appear in the floppy distribution, (2)
useful utilities that can be used directly off the CD-ROM if desired, thus
freeing up the corresponding amount of hard disk space, and (3) older
material from previous released floppy disks or CD-ROM's.

The portion of the disk dedicated to new material that I've not previously
published on a CD-ROM or floppy disk is 84Mb, broken down as follows:

  7Mb Archived (bbs ready) contents of disks 911-930
 16Mb Unarchived (ready-to-run) contents of disks 911-930

 21Mb Archived "new material" not in floppy distribution
 40Mb Unarchived "new material" not in floppy distribution

The portion of the disk dedicated to a bunch of useful tools like GNU
utilities, TeX with lots of fonts, and other interesting software that will
be updated on a monthly basis, is 150Mb, broken down as follows:

   3Mb Reviews of Amiga software and hardware
          4Mb Full BSD source for supplied BSD executables.
   8Mb Binary executables, libraries, and other "runtime" things.
  10Mb Runtime support stuff for GNU emacs and GNU C/C++
  14Mb Distributions of various small utilities and libraries.
  33Mb PasTeX source, fonts, binaries, etc.
  78Mb Full GNU source for supplied GNU executables.

The portion of the disk dedicated to old material is 404Mb, broken down as
follows:

 257Mb Unarchived contents of floppy disks 600-910.
 147Mb Archived (bbs-ready) contents of floppy disks 600-910.


GNU CODE
--------

Here are the current GNU distributions which are included in both source
and binary form.  In most cases, they are the very latest distributions
ftp'd directly from the FSF machines and compiled with the version of gcc
included on this CD-ROM.  I have personally compiled all of the GNU
binaries supplied on this CD-ROM, to verify that the compiler (version
2.4.5) is solid and that the binaries are in fact recreatable from the
supplied source code.

bc          diffutils flex     grep make      tar
binutils    doschk gas         gzip patch     termcap
bison       emacs gcc          indent perl    texinfo
cpio        fileutils gdbm     ispell sed     textutils
dc          find gmp m4        shellutils     uuencode
 
Here is an "ls -C" of the binary directory which can be added to your path
to make all these utilities usable directly off the CD-ROM, once it is
mounted:

AD2HT        bc        doschk      indent     paste       test
ARTM         bison     du          info       patch       texi2dvi

basename     dirname   id          od         tee


CONTENTS OF FLOPPY DISKS 600-930
--------------------------------

Because this is the first monthly CD-ROM, there are no previous monthly
CD-ROM's from which to replicate new material from previous months.  I've
elected to use the contents of floppy disks 600-910 to fill that portion of
the CD-ROM.  The next monthly CD-ROM will contain the new material from the
first one, which will squeeze out a substantial number of the older disks,
probably 600-700.  Then the next monthly after that will contain the new
material from both of the previous monthly disks, squeezing out another
batch of older disks, etc.


ORDERING INFORMATION
--------------------

If you wish to reserve a copy of this first monthly CD-ROM (and get the
lower price for preordered copies) you must order *now*, since your order
must reach me before I have to tell the CD-ROM production house how many
CD-ROM's to cut.  Orders received after that will be filled on a first come
first served basis from the extra CD-ROM's produced, and those few CD-ROM's
will cost 50% more.

The current pricing for preordered copies is $19.95 per CD-ROM plus $3
shipping and handling to USA/Canada/Mexico, $5 shipping and handling to
other destinations via small packet airmail.  For orders received after the
master disk is released to production about Oct 15th, the price is $29.95
per CD-ROM, with the same cost for shipping and handling as preordered
CD-ROM's.  You can FAX in an order to (602) 917-0917 if you wish, and pay
with VISA or MasterCard, but there is a $50 minimum on such orders because
of the way I have to process them.

If you want copies of the 6 page description of the CD-ROM distribution
that was posted previously to comp.sys.amiga.announce (and has been
slightly updated) send me email and I'll email it back to you.


NEXT MONTHLY CD-ROM
-------------------

Getting this first CD-ROM out was a lot more time consuming than originally
anticipated.  Because of this, not everything was done on this CD-ROM that
I wanted to get accomplished.  Since there is still lots of leftover work
to be done for the next CD-ROM, it is anticipated that it will follow about
5-6 weeks after this first one.  Eventually, after two or three CD-ROM's,
the distribution will stabilize to a monthly interval.

Subj: READ THIS!

Well...here's some interesting news.
 
A few months back, I purcased a game called Lemmings II.  Now, I know I could
have got a pirated copy, but I feel I should support the software houses that
support the Amiga.  The least I can do, I feel.
 
So I recently exchanged my A1200 +HD, for the one I owned previously had
occassional weird flickers in DBLNTSC, which I thought were normal until I
found out otherwise from fellow 1200 owners.
 
So what is the point of my story?
 
When I went to install Lemmings II to my hard drive, IT ERASED ITSELF.
 
It read "Icon x, deleting install, deleting install.info".
 
And the game will NOT boot off of floppy.
 
I can see this as NOTHING but an attempt to "punish" a user who tries to
install the program on multiple computers.  But what of my situation? And of
my right to switch computers daily, deleting and re-installing Lemmings II on
an hourly basis, between my new A1200s?  An absurd case, but as long as it is
on one single computer, I see how this cannot be anything but my right.
 
So what it comes down to is this.  I BOUGHT a program for $70 CDN funds, and I
cannot back it up (the floppies), AND, it can only be installed once. 
Unaceeptable.
 
There should have at least been a warning that the program would delete itself
if you attempted a second install.  How on EARTH was I supposed to know?  To
not even TELL me it would do that is beyond comprehension.  
 
I now have NO working copy of Lemmings II.

Thanks Psygnosis.  Assh*les.

Subj: Amiga/Toaster Sighting

I was watching last Thursday's (September 30) episode of "The Rush Limbaugh
Show" while reading my latest QWK bundle when I noticed something
interesting.  About 20 minutes into the show, after the commercials ended
and the show came back on, the logo came up in the lower left corner
followed by (suprise, surprise) the Video Toaster fade of the woman with the
wand that I've seen so often in an area Amiga dealer.

Hats off to Multimedia Inc. for their taste in computers.

As always.

/// Usenet Review:  EGS Spectrum 28/24 Graphics Card
    ------------------------------------------------
    By Jeff Wahaus
    (jeff_w1@sfov1.verifone.com)


PRODUCT NAME

        EGS Spectrum 28/24


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

        The following is a review of GVP's new EGS Spectrum 28/24 graphics
board.  I've had this board for a little over a week now, so I think that I
have a pretty good feel for what its capabilities are.  Here are my
impressions so far as well as the technical specs.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

        Name:           Great Valley Products, Inc.
        Address:        637 Clark Ave.
                        King Of Prussia, PA 19406

        Fax:            (215) 337-9922


LIST PRICE

        The list price of the Spectrum board is $599 for the 2MB version and
$499 for the 1MB version.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        Amiga with a Zorro slot.
        AmigaDOS 2.04 or greater.
        Minimum of 2 MB of RAM.


COPY PROTECTION

        None.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        My system is an Amiga 2000 with 22MHz 68030/68882 and 12MB of
memory, A2320 Display Enhancer, Commodore 1950 Multisync monitor, and
various other SCSI disk drives, tape drive, bridge board, etc.


INSTALLATION

        Installation was very simple.  I just put the board into a slot,
connected the supplied video jumper cable from the output of my Display
Enhancer to the Spectrum's input (I really appreciated the supplied cable),
and that was it.  The software comes on 5 disks and uses Commodore's
Installer program.


OVERVIEW

        The performance of the Spectrum board is exceptionally good, and
this is with a Zorro II system.  I imagine that this board would fly on a
Zorro III system (you will need an up-to-date Buster chip for Zorro III
though).  Scroll speeds on a EGS 640x480 pixel 16-color Workbench are about
8 times faster than when using an equivalent native Amiga mode.  Even when
using an EGS 800x600 pixel 256-color Workbench, scroll speeds do not
substantially degrade.  An awesome feature of the Spectrum/EGS system is
that you can move windows with their contents intact in real time.  This
looks really incredible in 24-bit color.  In EGS Paint, moving around with an
oversized 800x1200 24-bit image was done in real time as well.  The image
quickly and smoothly scrolled as I moved the windows sliders to reveal the
hidden parts of the image.

        The output of the Spectrum is exceptional.  All of the EGS display
modes are very crisp.  When the native Amiga display modes are passed
through (this is handled automatically), they appear as they always did with
no noticeable noise or interference from the Spectrum board.  I am a little
disappointed that the maximum refresh rate for a 800x600 pixel 24-bit screen
is 50Hz.  I guess you Europeans won't mind this, as you all are used to that
50Hz flicker.  I did define a 800x600 pixel 16-bit screen mode at 60Hz and I
am pleased with this mode.  To be honest, I can't discern much difference
between the 16-bit and 24-bit modes; they both look very good.

        One slight glitch I noticed was that the EGS's cursor produces a
short line of horizontal pixels if you moved it to the very top line of the
display screen.  Not a big problem, though.  After reading the manual, I
discovered that this may be a result of the way in which the screen mode was
defined.  Sure enough with a little bit of tweaking, I was able to get rid
this problem.


THE HARDWARE

        The board itself looks very clean and professionally designed.
There is only 1 jumper, which controls the Force Zorro II option.  There are
two 512KB RAM chip sockets which were filled on my board as I have the 2MB
version.  There is also an empty socket in the middle of the board.  I would
guess that this socket will be used to support the upcoming RTG
(ReTargetable Graphics) from Commodore.  The board has 2 ports which are
accessible from the back of the computer:  one is a 9-pin video input, and
the other is a 15-pin (SVGA type) video output.

        One thing worth mentioning is RAM.  You will need a lot of it.  The
Spectrum board uses Fast RAM for storing screens.  Chip RAM is not used at
all unless you use a native Amiga display mode.  For instance, I had both an
800x600x3 Workbench screen and a 736x556x24 EGS screen open and still had
980K of Chip RAM free on a 1MB Chip RAM machine.  All EGS screens do use
Fast RAM, however.  My 12MB machine was constantly getting low on memory
(less than 2MB free) when running several programs at once.  Granted, I did
have a couple of 24-bit images loaded in EGS-Paint and an Image processing
program running at the same time.


THE SOFTWARE

        The supplied software includes EGS Paint and several preferences
programs:  one to set the default EGS Screen Mode, one to set the EGS System
Fonts, one to set the Display Colors, and the Display Adjust program for
defining and editing screen modes.  Another preferences program lets you
edit the EGS sprite pointers, although this program constantly crashed on me.
And finally, there is a program to select which EGS screen blanker to use.
The screen blanker program has several neat blankers to choose from like
raindrops, fractals, EGS wave, and others.

        There are also several utility programs included such as an IFF
display program, a clock, an EGS version of the text display program 'More',
an EGS Shell (couldn't get this one to work), and a screen/window grabber
program which saves EGS displays to an IFF-24 file.  There is a program to
let you define 24-bit backgrounds for your EGS screen.  Several pre-defined
backgrounds are provided.  In a directory named 'Tools' there is a neat
little function plotter program and a Tetris Game.

        The software was all pretty straightforward:  I was up and running
without opening the manuals.  That is, until I tried actually using some of
EGS Paint's features.  It took a little getting used to; but with a little
help from the manual, I quickly got the gist of it.

        My impression of EGS Paint is not so favorable, but it does have a
few neat features.  The author obviously spent a lot of time on the stencil
features.  They allow you to mark off areas of the image which can/cannot be
modified.  The stencil area can be captured as a brush or saved to disk.

        EGS Paint will let you have multiple images open at the same time.
Also it will let you have 2 or 4 views of the same image within a window at
different magnifications if desired.  Overall I would say that EGS Paint
still needs quite a bit more work.  I haven't really found any bugs with EGS
Paint, but there are a few things which need fixing.  For instance the window
which contains the image being edited constantly updates its title when the
mouse moves (even when coordinates have been turned off).  Not only does
this needlessly slow down painting, but it is very annoying to see the title
bar flickering like that.  Another thing which I don't like about this
program is that when drawing lines with a brush larger than 1 pixel, you get
a thin 1 pixel wide representation of where the line will be drawn.  I would
really like to have the option of seeing the entire thick line drawn before
I let go of the mouse button.  I know that this would be slow, but they could
at least make it an option so that you can see what the line will really
look like if you want to.

        Another dislike about EGS Paint is that when you grab a brush you
are given a 1 pixel deep outline image of what the brush looks like until
you stamp it down on the image.  If the EGS system is fast enough to move
entire 24-bit windows with their contents intact in real time then why can't
EGS Paint show the full 24-bit brush?  Brushes also don't seem to know about
using transparent background colors.  I could go on and on about what
features are missing but I won't.  Would I say that EGS Paint is useless?
No, not really.  It is useful for touching up 24 bit images.  It does have a
slick interface.  But in comparison to a program like Deluxe Paint there is
quite a lot missing.

        One notable capability missing from both EGS Paint and the IFF
Viewer program is the ability to read and write JPEG and GIF type images.
Currently only IFF is supported.  It is a real headache to convert JPEG's to
IFF before working with them.  And the size of them!!!  A 150K JPEG image
becomes about 2MB once it's converted to IFF-24.  To give GVP credit, they
do use external libraries to support file IO.  This means all they have to
do is release modules for JPEG and GIF in the future and the programs will
automatically support them.  I have been using HamLab II+ to do the
conversions.  It's an excellent program that is well worth the modest asking
price.  I would love direct Spectrum support in this program.  Ed, are you
listening?  Hint. Hint.

        Moving on to the rest of the software....  A nice program included is
the display database/screen mode creator.  You can define custom resolutions
to add to the display database.  It gives you complete control over the
Vertical and Horizontal scan rates allowing you to squeeze the most out of
you monitor.

        Compatibility with existing software is good as long as you don't
try and use an EGS display mode.  This is probably the most disappointing
aspect of this package right now.  I tried running ProPage 3.1, ProDraw 3.0,
and Final Copy II on a 256 color hi-res Workbench screen, and none of these
programs would work at all.  In fact they crashed and burned.  Both ProPage
and ProDraw would not even work on their own custom screens if I had the
workbench set to an EGS mode of any type.  I did have a little luck,
however.  Most programs which open up a window on the Workbench screen will
work.  They don't seem to know or care about any extra colors you have over
16 though.  Even the Workbench preferences programs won't use more than 16
colors.  I'm running Workbench 2.1 by the way.  I would really like to see
GVP come up with a screen mode promoter program like the Retina graphics
board has currently.

        Programs which use the Display Database do work correctly.  I
currently have exactly 2 programs which do use the display database (out of
thousands).  One is the Workbench and the other is Term 3.4.  Final Copy II
does work on large screens as long as they have 32 colors or less.  I guess
I'll be needing a lot of software upgrades in the near future.

BUGS

        The EGS sprite pointer program would not run -- it crashed
constantly.

        I could not get the EGS shell program to work.


CONCLUSIONS

        In retrospect I would say that Spectrum board is a really nice piece
of hardware.  My complaints with this system are all software related.  I
think that we can count on the software's improving, knowing GVP's
reputation.  I feel that they rushed the software to get this board out
because of the heavy competition now emerging.  Not that all of the software
included is all bad.  In fact, it all has a very polished look, but it lacks
a little substance right now.  Once the software catches up, I will be in
24-bit bliss.

        The opinions expressed above are my own.  I am in no way connected
with Great Valley Products.  I am a software engineer by trade and an artist
by heart.

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA or through Tymnet from anywhere in
North America.  If you have an account on another Internet-connected
system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet programs, from
anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users can now Telnet
into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Tymnet 9600bps services is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.

@toc "menu"


/// Delphi Conference:  Jim Drew from Utilities Unlimited
    -----------------------------------------------------


RNILES> OK, we'll go ahead and start the conference...
RNILES> Ok....first We have tonight...
RNILES> Jim Drew from Utilities Unlimited....
RNILES> the makers of EMPLANT.
RNILES> Jim...first off how about a little about yourself and Utilities
        Unlimited.

.Jim Drew> Well, Utilities Unlimited, Inc. is about 8 years old.  We 
	first started in the C64 business (remember those)?
	We got into the Amiga market in '89 with 'Super-Card Ami', a 
	disk copier.. had bad dealings with ReadySoft over SYBIL and 
        EMPLANT was born.  :-)

BONAJDROVSKY> Jim, I have a couple of questions... 1st, how soon till 
              3.2?

.Jim Drew> Well, v3.2 is due out soon... we are out of version numbers, 
        so we don't have much choice!  :-)

BONAJDROVSKY> second, I seem to have some problems with empscsi.device...
        lockups with big files? are you planning to release a new 
        version soon?

.Jim Drew> No.. we don't see this problem.  You need to check 'GAL3' on 
        your EMPLANT harware...
        It will be indentified by having a white label with 
        'P3-XXXX-Y'.. where 'XXXX' is a date code, and 'Y' is a model
        number.  In your case, the model # is either a 'B' or 'C'.
        The date code needs to be '5092' (50th week of 1992) or later.
	If it isn't, contact Utilities Unlimited for an upgrade. 

BONAJDROVSKY> My EMPLANT is very new... got it 1.5 weeks ago.. I don't 
	think it's outdated gal. Finally, I have a Q about the IBM 
	emulation module.  I understand that it will be memory intensive.
        .. how big PC with 8 megs of FAST?
.Jim Drew> I will not be answering any questions about the IBM emulation.
  	At this point, I have instructed our office to provide no 
	information about it until it is ready for shipping.

BONAJDROVSKY> ok, thanks. that's all for now.

.Jim Drew> As far as your SCSI problem, the only possibility left is
	termination.  Make sure that the LAST SCSI device is terminated 
	and NO other device is...
  	If you are still having problems after you are sure that the 
	cable is ok, and the drive(s) is/are terminated properly, then I
	would send the board back to us for a replacement.

TODDA> Is the Emplant coming out for the A1200?  <I have more to ask>

.Jim Drew> Yes.

TODDA> Okay, what port will it use, and will I need an accelerator?

.Jim Drew> No, you can use the stock A1200.
.Jim Drew> It will be PCMCIA based.

TODDA> Thanks!  That's it.

KALEM> Jim, just how compatable is the system with the MAC line for 
	everything from word proccessors to games?  And what about the 
	SNES and GENISIS emulation?

.Jim Drew> BTW, the unit will also work in a PCMCIA port on a different 
	computer for the ports.
.Jim Drew> Well, compatibility is great.  We demo PhotoShop, Quark 
	Express, QuickTime movies etc.  We know of one program that won't
	 ever work.. Apple's own Disk Copy program...
.Jim Drew> we could fix it, but it breaks all of Apple's own rules and 
	nobody really uses it anyways... they use DiskDup+ and other PD 
	programs...
.Jim Drew> No information is available at this time (to even us) about 
	the SNES and GENESIS emulation modules.. we are not writing them.

KALEM> Sorry, thought I saw it somewhere.  DONE

.Jim Drew> There will be SNES and GENESIS emulation modules, it is just 
	that we (UUI) are not writing them... two companys in Germany 
	are.

KALEM> OOOH! thank you
NWASTE> DITTO

RNILES> OK while we are waiting for some more hands....What can the 
	Emplant emulate...and what is being possibly planned for the 
	future of emplant?

.Jim Drew> MAC. :-) .. PC (386/486), Apple ][+/e (we did demo this one 
	at WOC in Pasadena), Atari 400/800, C64/128, etc, etc.  a bunch 
	of stuff... and other 3rd party companys are taking interest in 
	writing modules too... so, EMPLANT will really be taking off.

RNILES> Haha...that's good to hear!! OK...grumpa you're next

.Jim Drew> Well, the 8 bit emulations will be free to customers.. PC 
	will $99.95.

GRUMPA> Can you tell us why anyone would ewant other paltform emulation?  I
	ahvnt got time to run Amiga programs
GRUMPA> much less other stuff

.Jim Drew> Well, the MAC has some serious application software packages... 
	the best in the world...
.Jim Drew> ..many people don't have enough desk space too.
.Jim Drew> ...but...
.Jim Drew> ... big reason is money... even production studios in 
	Hollywood (I deal with these people daily) are on tight budgets...

GRUMPA> Well, in my case, for every meg of hard disk space I would 
	dedicate to other platforms, it cripples my Amiga

.Jim Drew> ...ever price a Quadra with all of the goodies?  Spendy.  
	Besides, there is that nastalga thing. :-)
.Jim Drew> 'Cripples' is probably a poor choice of wording.  You are 
	giving your Amiga the power it needs to keeping it alive...

GRUMPA> Can EMPLANT emulate a QUADRA?...

.Jim Drew> ...the Amiga could die if something is not done to expand it's
  	capabilities.
.Jim Drew> Yes, EMPLANT's MAC emulation is a 'generic' MAC.  This means 
	that it is ALL MACs made.  The speed is dependant on the 
	processor you are using...
.Jim Drew> A3000=MACIIci and A4000=Quadra 700.

BONAJDROVSKY> Since DiskCopy does not work, can you suggest another 
	method of writing .image files to a disk?

.Jim Drew> Use DiskDup+.  It is much faster, and more reliable.  Apple's
	Disk Copy program does work with the MAC emulation for READING 
	disks, just not writing them.

BONAJDROVSKY> Could you elaborate more on the clipboard support, and 
	multiOS file system that you mentioned on 
	comp.sys.amiga.emulations?

.Jim Drew> Well, the Amiga's and the MAC's clipboard will be shareable..
	that is, you can cut and paste between the clipboards...
.Jim Drew> ..the multi-osFileSystem and multi-os.device will allow ANY 
	Amiga user (even without EMPLANT) to read and write MAC, IBM, 
	and Atari ST disk formats.. this includes...

BONAJDROVSKY> sounds HOT!  FInally, I have the GVP EGS Spectrum.. will 
	you support 800x600 mode soon?

.Jim Drew> ...hard drives, diskettes, etc.  The way it is designed, you 
	can add a new DOS type by simply changing the 'datatypes.library'.
	So, adding support for OS/2's filesystem is very easy.
.Jim Drew> No.. you can not use 800x600 at all.  I explained this on
  	c.s.a.emulations.
.Jim Drew> The EGS and Piccolo boards won't make 832x624 screens... only
  	800x600... the MAC can't use this size.

KALEM> Jim, I saw that the Emplant was available for around 400(?).  But
	without any BIO chips.  So, 1) Is it worthless right out of the 
	box?  2) What kind of price will I be spending to get MAC-II 
	System-7 compatibility? (on a stock A1200)...

.Jim Drew> You would need a set of ROMs (or a ROM image if you already 
	own a MAC II/x/cx machine), and the MAC system software (which 
	can be downloaded from various FTP sites).

KALEM> price?

.Jim Drew> The A1200 version will retail for $299.95 and will include 
	both a SCSI interface and a dual serial interface.
.Jim Drew> ROMs can be purchased at various prices...

KALEM> What about things like analog joystick and cards?

.Jim Drew> shop around.. we have had customers pay as little as $90, and
	as much as $650.
.Jim Drew> Analog joysticks for what?

KALEM> Sorry, I think a PC question slipped in there :)

.Jim Drew> :-)  :done:

NWASTE> I AM AT A LOSS AS TO THE COST OF A USEFUL SYSTEM HERE.  I HAVE A
	2000 AND NEED 486 CAPABILITIES
NWASTE> I ALSO NEED TO BE ABLE TO USE HARDWARE/SOFTWARE PACKS THAT ARE 
	MAC

.Jim Drew> System requirements for MAC emulation:
.Jim Drew> 68020 or 68030/040 with MMU (no, the 020 does not need an MMU)
.Jim Drew> At least 4 megs of FAST ram (32 bit memory preferred), and 
	MAC 256K ROMs..
.Jim Drew> ..and of course, you'll need the MAC system software.

NWASTE> WHAT WOULD THIS COST...

.Jim Drew> Unknown... it varies for the different pieces.

.Joe> Hello Jim, Joe Slayton from Baltimore Md. here. Are there any 
	hardware revisions coming out soon that we should wait on before
	purchasing?

.Jim Drew> No.. the only change we ever made to the 'hardware' was a 
	change in the SCSI handshaking logic, and that was done last 
	December.  I am not making any changes to something that 
	works.  :-)

.Joe> Does the emplant require any more power from the supply than is 
	usually there?

.Jim Drew> No, we use ultra-low power components... real low in fact.  
	Our custom logic uses about the same about of power as a 
	standard LED...

.Joe> great! no new power wupply
.Joe> about the floppy emulation...

.Jim Drew> Also, the board is very well buffered... I never turn the 
	power off before removing or inserting an EMPLANT board in my 
	system.  :-)

.Joe> will a apple floppy be the simplest solution?

.Jim Drew> Apple floppy?

.Joe> drive emulation

.Jim Drew> Ah.. well, it depends what you are doing.  If you have HD 
	floppy drive, you can read/write MAC HD disks...

.Joe> I read that there was some song and dance required to use the 
	amiga floppy

.Jim Drew> ...if you have low-density MAC disks, you will need either 
	SYBIL (which we do not sell anymore... thank you Japan), or a 
	drive interface and MAC drive.

.Joe> oh, ok...that is what I meant . No problems with using a mac 
	floppy drive.

.Jim Drew> More like a really bad waltz.  :-)  The MAC floppy drive 
	(low density) has variable speeds. :done:

CABRALC> Hi JJim, how come the Mac roms arent  included with the package?

.Jim Drew> Because we don't want to get involved with that.  I am sure 
	Apple is not happy as it is. :done:

BONAJDROVSKY> Jim, since you don't sell SYBIL any more, what will be 
	replacement for it, and when? How about the support for the PD 
	Mac floppy interface?

.Jim Drew> We support the PD MAC floppy interface now.  Yes, we will 
	have a disk drive (MAC) interface replacing SYBIL that is 
	similar to the PD hack.
.Jim Drew> The release date has not been set at this time.
.Jim Drew> :done:

BONAJDROVSKY> Also, about what you mentioned earlier... the EGS can do 
	ANY resolution between 320x200 and 1600x1280. It simply has to 
	be defined. Could you provide a driver for 832x624 so that we 
	can define a mac screen for it?

.Jim Drew> Well, we *tried* to define the screen size of 832x624, but the
  	EGS.library does NOT permit this size to be opened.  I am going 
	to have to talk to the programmers in Germany (again) about this.

KALEM>   Me again :)  Is there a relese date on the A1200 Emplant or is 
	it out already?  Is it SCSI or SCSI-II?  Does it run on WB? Does
	 it play well with other programs (multi-tasking)?

RNILES> <grin>

.Jim Drew> There is no release date set for the PCMCIA version of EMPLANT.  We
  	are having problems getting the PCMCIA connectors...
.Jim Drew> It is SCSI-I as is the EMPLANT now.. however, the controller 
	is capable of moving 1.75 megs a second quite easily.. so I don't
	see a problem with speed... yes, it multitasks just like the 
	current EMPLANT MAC emulation.
.Jim Drew> ..and you can use the SCSI interface for the Amiga side. 

.Alan> i was told that there where a lot of problems getting the emplant
  	to work i was wo was wondering if this is ture.
.Alan> i ment true?done.

.Jim Drew> well, yes and no.  I think a lot of the problems were due to 
	our documentation...
.Jim Drew> ..we now have a nice 3-ring binder style documentation, and 
	that has ended our problems with installation. :-)

RNILES> LOL!

.Alan> ok.

(above was an answer to, "What is EMPLANT"

NWASTE> What would a 486 emulation cost?

.Jim Drew> $99.95.  You need no ROMs (we wrote our own BIOS).

NWASTE> Including Emplant?..

.Jim Drew> No... that is an emulation 'module'.  The EMPLANT system 
	retails from $279.95 to $399.95 depending on the options you want.

NWASTE> What are these options? done

.Jim Drew> BASIC board - $279.95, OPTION 'A' (dual serial ports w/BASIC)
	- $349.95..
.Jim Drew> OPTION 'B' (SCSI interface w/BASIC) - $349.95, DELUXE (serial
	 & SCSI w/BASIC) - $399.95.

RNILES> Jim: Can these serial ports and such be used on the Amiga side?

.Jim Drew> Yes.  You can use the SCSI interface and/or the serial ports 
	on the Amiga AS WELL AS with an emulation module... even at the 
	same time.

.Joe> Did I read earlier that the GVP spectrum is supported? and is there
	a preferred video board recommended by Emplant.

.Jim Drew> GVP's spectrum is supported... I don't have an official 
	opinion at this time.  Commodore has asked me to review the 
	various video boards and choose which board they will base their
	RTG standard on.  I would like to be fair and judge all boards 
	made....before going to Commdore with my opinion.

.Joe> I was wondering, I am really interested in getting this setup, but
	the Retina board doesnt work with games on the original moniotor.

.Jim Drew> I guess I do have an opinion... don't get a Retina board for 
	use with EMPLANT.  It was the first board we supported and is 
	_by far_ the slowest. Games are unplayable using it.

.Joe>  Thanks much!...the spectrum looks good on the ad...I hope maybe
	this will be what I need for the Emplant..and 256plus colors

BONAJDROVSKY> Will Mac 3.2 support Amiga internal Parallel port? If not, when
  can we expect support for it?   (Note to .Joe:  My EMPLANT works 
	wonderfully with the Spectrum 28/24 it's FAST!)

.Jim Drew> No, v3.2 will not include Amiga parallel or serial support.  
	There is no release date set for this support.
.Jim Drew> ...BTW...
.Jim Drew> ...Amiga parallel and serial support now takes the place of 
	the sound support (bottom of the list of things to do).. but who
	knows, maybe it will magically appear like s

(Jim lost carrier here)

RNILES> ooopss...looks like we lost him...we'll wait a bit and see if he gets
  back

BONAJDROVSKY> bummer, that's the only way to print for me, but I'd rather have
  32 bit clean first. Also, I have problems with using 14.4 kbaud modem in the
  emplant serial port. not DSR. Any suggestions? (I'm using a Mac cable.)

.Jim Drew> OK... I'm back
.Jim Drew> I got bumped... weird.

BONAJDROVSKY> ok I have problems with using 14.4 kbaud modem in the 
	emplant serial port. not DSR. Any suggestions? (I'm using a Mac 
	cable.)
BONAJDROVSKY> I mean no DTS..

.Jim Drew> Yes, you can't use ANY HIGHER BAUD than 2400...period.  We 
	did not write the serial driver.  It does not support handshaking 
	at all.

BONAJDROVSKY> will you rewrite it, Jim?

.Jim Drew> I need to look at that code and add handshaking support.  On 
	the MAC side, I lock my modem at 57,600 without any problems and
	get better CPS rates than my A4000.

XIS> hello,do you know what the landmark or norton rateing is on your 
	486 emulator? done

.Jim Drew> Like I mentioned in the beginning of this conference, I am not
  answering any questions concerning the IBM emulation...
.Jim Drew> ..not until it is officially released.  Sorry. :done:

XIS> ohh I'm sorry

KALEM>   Jim, what is all this talk about boards?  Ok, IF I buy an A1200,
	the Emplant (when it comes out), the 99.95 486 (that you wrote).
	Then what else do I need to use programs and play games?
KALEM> If that is a PC question then I am done.

.Jim Drew> For the MAC emulation (included with ALL EMPLANT systems), you
	will need MAC 256K ROMs, and MAC system software.. and of course,
	any software you want to run...
.Jim Drew> The PC emulation requires no ROMs, just MS-DOS software.

DENM> I was just wondering how long you had to work on Emplant before 
	you were convinced or could convince others that it was possible.

.Jim Drew> About 15-20 minutes.  :-)
.Jim Drew> ... for myself..

DENM> :)

.Jim Drew> ... people *still* don't believe it when they see it.. We had
	one of our MAC IIx machines sitting right next to an 
	A3000/EMPLANT.. system at WOC.  People were looking for another 
	MAC under the table, and cables coming from the MAC sitting there
	connecting to the A3000.  :-)

DENM> I'm done. Thanks.

.Joe>  Jim, What is the story on sound support?, is there any? and will 
	that affect sound from a Mac cdrom player hooked up to Emplant

.Jim Drew> yes, there is full STEREO sound support.  You can play 
	QuickTime movies with sound, games, etc... just like a MAC.  No 
	adverse affects on anything.

.Joe> This is sounding better every minute...
.Joe> Any discount for Delphi users.? heh,heh.  DONE

.Jim Drew> :done:  ;-)

BONAJDROVSKY> Jim, since it's patented, I'm sure you won't mind answering
  	this... :-)  how did you get the multitasking to work in 
	supervisor mode? (I'm interested in the tech aspects)

.Jim Drew> By re-writing all of the code.  Basically, once RsrvMem37ii is
  	running, you are now running on OUR multitasking system.. it no 
	longer uses the Amiga's own routines.
.Jim Drew> ..basically, the Amiga's routines forbid multitasking while in
  	Supervisor mode...

BONAJDROVSKY> are you talking about the Exec's scheduler itself?

.Jim Drew> ..in fact, they make sure you can't!  So, by re-writing the 
	OS stuff to support task switching while in SuperVisor mode *AND*
	while our emulation is running...
.Jim Drew> .. we can multitask our emulation.  No, not the task schedule
	routines.. the task switching routines themselves.

BONAJDROVSKY> hmm.. that's what I suspected. Very slick. I was blown away
	when I first saw my Ami and Mac run at the same time. :done:

.Jim Drew> Thanks. :-)

RNILES> Jim: I just want to make sure on this...the Emplant is being sold
	in Europe with the Amigas correct?

.Jim Drew> Well, there is a deal going through right now with Commodore 
	UK that will provide an EMPLANT system and a 3rd party video 
	board with every A4000/040 sold...
.Jim Drew> ..this same deal is in the works right now with Commodore US 
	and CEI.

RNILES> Ah...that's good to hear...possibly with the A4000s here also?

.Jim Drew> Yes, possibly.  We are hoping so.. that would mean 40,000+ 
	units a month in the US.

RNILES> CBM is selling 40,000 units a month here in the US?

.Jim Drew> Of the A4000, yes.

RNILES> Ahhh...I like to hear that!

.Joe>  Jim, there has been alot of talk about a4000's...
.Joe> will my a2000 68030 8meg ram be ok?

.Jim Drew> Yep.  I have an A2500 (2630) with 4 megs of 32 bit memory and
	2 megs of 16 bit memory.. it works great!  :-)

.Joe> Oh, ok....hey...notice you guys are making the other emulator makers
	look like real goofs...DONE

KALEM> I still don't understand the use of the video board. ???  What is
	 it for?

.Jim Drew> Well, the MAC has the ability to run in 256 colors, 32000 
	colors, and 24 bit colors.
.Jim Drew> The Amiga (with exception of the AGA machines) is not capable
	of anything higher than 16 colors.
.Jim Drew> ..in HIRES mode. :done:

KALEM> won't the 4000 (1200) do that?

.Jim Drew> AGA machines can do the 256 color mode, but nothing higher.

XIS> Jim do you mean that with your emplant I won't need a 24 bit true 
	color board?

.Jim Drew> Well, yes, you would need a 24 bit board if you wanted 24 bit
  	graphics.  The EMPLANT hardware has no video capabilities itself.
.Jim Drew> We you like me to ASCII-send a complete info sheet?

XIS> yes done

.Jim Drew> I think it will look a bit odd, but you could always cut out 
	the wraps..
.Jim Drew> Ok.. I will prepare it...
.Jim Drew> Ready?
.Jim Drew> Here it goes....

Updated June 26th, 1993


EMPLANT received class B FCC verification August 24th, 1992.

Information reguarding the product "EMPLANT" from Utilities Unlimited,
Inc.  This information is freely re-distributable and may be used in
any form as long as the contents are not altered.

           What is EMPLANT?
           ----------------

EMPLANT is a hardware/software product that is designed to allow the
emulation of virtually any computer using the Amiga.  A simple  software
driver and ROM(s) from the computer to emulated are all that is required.
Features and software compatibility will depend on the software driver.


           About the hardware
           ------------------

The hardware holds the key to emulation speed.  Every effort was made to
make the hardware virsatile enough that we should never have to upgrade
it to handle the emulation of forth comming computer systems.  For this
reason, we have included components that may never be used, however,
this does insure the fact that we are prepared for the future.

The MAC series of computers, although different from one another, share
the same basic technology.  We can replicate this technology by emulating
the MAC's custom chips through a reliable hardware system.  All timers,
interrupts, and clocks are handled on a hardware level so that speed is
identical (or even faster) than the real computer being emulated.

Support for custom EPROMs, static RAM, and SIMM modules makes our hardware
compatible with all existing methods of storing a computer's operating
system.  This versatility also allows us to create adapter boards if some
new method of OS storage becomes available.  The EMPLANT hardware has four
empty 32 pin ROM/RAM sockets provided for use with operating systems that
are stored in DIP format (such as 128K MAC+ ROMs are).  These sockets
can also be used to store your own utility software in EPROM format. We
plan to release a utility package that will be literally "at your
fingertips".  Another option is to fill the four sockets with static
RAMs, giving you up to 2 megs of extra RAM that you could write protect and
make auto-booting, which would be handy for floppy-only customers.

The hardware comes in two forms: a plug in card that occupies one of the
Zoro II/III slots on your A2000/2500/3000, and a plug in card that fits on
the expansion bus on your A500/1000.  For the A500/1000 version, there is
a pass-thru that allows you to plug in your existing equipment.

The Apple Nu-Bus expansion ports are not emulated through hardware because
they are now RAM-based device drivers which operate faster than a MAC's own
hardware.  We will be producing NuBus adapter sockets that allow the
use of standard MAC NuBus products to work in a Zoro II/III slot.


* AVAILABLE HARDWARE OPTIONS *

HIGH SPEED MAC SERIAL PORTS/APPLE TALK SUPPORT

The MAC serial port is not emulated, it is duplicated - using the exact same
standard dual high speed serial interface IC.  Apple Talk is completely
supported through this port like the MAC, via a 8 pin mini-din connector.
This dual high speed serial port can be used on the Amiga side as well,
allowing the connection of two serial devices operating independantly.
Communication speed on these ports are a maximum of 230.4K baud, which is
the speed at which Apple Talk runs.  Maximum modem speed is generally
limited to 57.6K baud.


SCSI INTERFACE

A simple, autobooting SCSI controller using NCR53C80 high speed
controller IC.  Capable of pseudo-DMA transfers up to 1.1 megs per second.
Support for up to 7 SCSI devices including CD ROMs, tape backup units,
and hand scanners.  This SCSI interface can be used on both the Amiga
side and the MAC side, independantly or simotaneously.


           About the MAC II emulation software
           ------------------------------------

FULL COLOR, MULTITASKING, MAC II EMULATION!

Up to 16 colors can be displayed using the standard OCS/ECS Amiga video
output, and up to 256 colors can be displayed when using an AGA capable
machine.

Full color can also be emulated with various 8bit and 24bit video boards.
Support for the Retina, Merlin, Picasso II, Piccolo, EGS-28/24 Spectrum,
and Rainbow II video boards allowing up to 16 million colors to be
displayed!!  We are currently working on drivers for other video boards.

Full STEREO sound is supported through the Amiga's audio outputs.

ALL emulation modules created for the EMPLANT system will share one
very important feature...they will multitask with the Amiga's
environment.  That's right, just pull down the MAC screen, or flip to the
back with LEFT-AMIGA-M/N and you still have complete access to your
Amiga! ...and the MAC stays running at full speed!  Speaking of speed,
a 25Mhz A3000 runs the emulation at exactly twice the speed of a *real*
 MAC IIx computer!

The MAC IIx emulator software is relatively simple since the majority of
the emulation is done on a hardware level, giving both better compatibility
and equally important, emulation speed.

The software reads the MAC ROM SIMM module that is installed on the EMPLANT
board, dumps the ROM image into a block of memory, and patches the image
to run on your Amiga.  One intelligent move on the part of Apple was to
define "global" variables for their operating system.  This makes it
relatively simple to move the code around without a lot of hassles.
Since the MAC IIx is a 68030 based machine, it has a AMU or PMMU to map
memory into various locations.  Using a 68020/30/40 with an MMU allows
virtually 100% compatibility when running MAC software on the emulator.
Another big advantage of having a MMU is the tremendous speed increase
of the video display drivers.  The MAC's video data is in 'CHUNKY'
format, and the Amiga's video data is in 'PLANAR' format.  These two
formats are completely different, so the emulation converts the MAC's
video data into data that the Amiga's display hardware can use....all
in real time, thanks to the MMU.

Support for virtually ANY SCSI device such as hand scanners, Ethernet
cartridges, hard drives, SyQuest units, Magneto-Optical units,
DATs, film recorders, CD-ROMs, etc. is provided via the EMPLANT's
SCSI port.  You can also use AmigaDOS formatted devices (which
become MAC formatted by the emulation).  Amiga devices such as
hard drive partitions, recoverable RAM drives (RD0, RAD, VD0, etc.),
and MS-DOS partitions can all be used under the emulation.  Up to
14 different devices can be used at the same time.

The MAC 400/800K disk format is emulated by using the already successful
SYBIL hardware package.  High density (1.44mb) floppys are supported via
the CBM 1.76mb drives.


           Future emulation
           ----------------

Since the EMPLANT's hardware is so versatile, a completely new and
different computer can be emulated by just changing the emulation
software patch and the ROM(s).  MAC QUADRA, Mega ST, and IBM AT
(386/486) emulators are planned in the future.


           Price and availability
           ----------------------

Current retail price for the basic EMPLANT system is $279 + shipping.

Basic EMPLANT system with High speed serial ports/Apple Talk support
is $349.00 + shipping.

Basic EMPLANT system with high speed SCSI interface is $349.00 +
shipping.

Deluxe EMPLANT system with both high speed serial ports/Apple Talk
support AND high speed SCSI interface is $399 + shipping.

All EMPLANT packages described above come with the MAC IIx emulation
software and necessary device drivers.

The EMPLANT systems are shipping now, however, we are in a back order
situation with shipment priority based on the order date.

..Robert> OK...everyone use your buffers there!
..Robert> Thanks for the info!

.Jim Drew> Yikes... please ignore the part about the 'Quadra emulation' planned
  	for the future.  As I stated, our emulation is now ALL MACs made.

BONAJDROVSKY> Jim, in my EMPLANT manual, I read that the SIMM socket can be used
  	for foreign processors. Could you give us a hint to the possibility of 
	any HARDWARE based emulation modules?

.Jim Drew> well, it is possible.  We have nothing planned at this time, however,
	I did not want to leave the hardware un-expandable.

..Robert> OK, one more question from whomever

.Jim Drew> I have a comment..
.Jim Drew> The next release of our emulation (v3.19) will have something
	that we have been missing for quite some time, and possibly the
	only advantage to having AMAX in the past...

.Jim Drew> We have now included bi-directional file transfer ability 
	built right into the emulation.  You can transfer data from 
	anywhere to anywhere...

.Jim Drew> .. for example, I am able to move files from a MAC connected 
	to my A3000/EMPLANT system via AppleTalk to my A1200 system 
	connected to the A3000 via Parnet.
.Jim Drew> There are no headaches that deal with MACBinary files...
.Jim Drew> we handle all of the conversion for you.  Speaking of 
	conversion...
.Jim Drew> In v3.2, there will be conversion modules for the MAC 
	emulation's file transfer system.  These modules (information 
	will be made available publically so you can write one yourself)...
.Jim Drew> .. will let you convert data AS IT IS TRANSFERRED.  For 
	example, you will be able to convert fonts, pictures, and even 
	sound samples... or ANYTHING else you might like!  One MAC 
	company is going to port their screen saver...
.Jim Drew> ...program's animations using this method.. converting their 
	format to ANIM format.  Just wanted to let you guys know... v3.19
	will be available on our BBS (and GEnie, Portal, etc.) on Sat.

..Robert> Hahaa...this thing sound super!!

KALEM> What is YOUR dream ideal setup for using the Emplant.  To get THE
	MOST out of it!

.Jim Drew> Well, the ideal setup (in my opinion) is an A3000 with 16 megs
	of memory and a Piccolo video board... but, I do like other 
	systems too... especially the 33Mhz 040 board for the A3000.  :-)

KALEM> The AGA computers are not in your future?

.Jim Drew> Well, I have two A4000s... so, I am definately into AGA... but,
	you asked what the best arrangement is..

.Joe> Thankyou for all your help Jim and the informed answers...I cant 
	wait to get one. Bye everyone. Joe.

KALEM> Thank you VERY much.  And have a good night.  DONE

.Jim Drew> .. The A3000's are cheap right now... and you can buy an A3000
	and a video board for less than an A4000/030!

.Jim Drew> 'nite Joe.



Phew! That's the conference!

I would really like to thank Jim Drew for coming to the conference
and letting us have the chance to ask him these questions.

Emplant sounds like something that belongs in an Amiga!

@node P1-6 "Atari's Jaguar VS. 3DO on CBS"
@toc "menu"


/// Atari's Jaguar steals 3DO's Thunder on CBS This Morning
    -------------------------------------------------------    
    By Travis Guy


                Reprinted from AEO News #1, October 8, 1993


Finally breaking loose from its well crafted veil of mystery, the Atari
Jaguar made its national television debut early today on the CBS news
program CBS This Morning. Placed squarely in competition with the 3DO
system, Atari's new machine looked to be in good shape in the battle of
the next generation videogame systems.

For those who couldn't see the CBS This Morning piece, the Jag played
second fiddle to the 3DO... in terms of placement and air time only. Herb
Weisbaum, consumer reporter for KIRO-TV, Seattle, opened his three and a
half minute live report with a Panasonic REAL 3DO Multiplayer at his side,
telling viewers only that there were two new video game machines coming to
market. "Both are better than anything that's ever come before."

3DO was presented as a 32-bit machine that relies on CDs to deliver action
and realism. Lots of footage of Crash and Burn, the Panasonic player's
pack-in game, played throughout the 3DO segment, interspersed with
snippets from other 3DO games. Ken Williams, President of Sierra On-Line
said of 3DO, "It's got the horsepower to deliver the games we always
dreamed about."

3DO CEO Trip Hawkins demoed PGA Tour Golf, saying it has, "The look and
feel of a TV broadcast." Kirkland, Washington's Boy Scout troop 616 was
given an opportunity to play with a 3DO machine - the comments from the
Scouts ranged from, "It's cool" to "A lot better than Super Nintendo and
Genesis."

Weisbaum warned, "Right now, 3DO stands alone. But not for long."
Suddenly, the familiar Fuji and the ATARI logo appeared on screen -
Atari's first direct mention.

The Jaguar was presented as "an even more powerful system," a 64-bit
machine to sell for "just 250 dollars", and to which a $200 CD-ROM can be
added. The Jaguar, a controller, and a CD-ROM unit attached to another
Jaguar - all sitting in front of a Jaguar shipping box - were displayed.

Cuts from Crescent Galaxy, Cybermorph and Raiden were shown being played:
"The first time Jaguar software has been seen on TV. The games are
colorful, fast-paced, with lots of action."

Atari President Sam Tramiel said, "I love shoot'em up games. That's what
people like to play.... The big thing is to have a lot of fun with your
software. That's the key."

Glenn Rubenstein, a videogame reviewer for the San Francisco Examiner, was
seen having been given some time to spend with a Jaguar. "For 250 dollars,
I'm very impressed with the Jaguar." Rubenstein laughed, "I would actually
spend my own money. Not a lot of journalists would say that about a
product, but I would actually go out and buy a Jaguar."

Weisbaum closed his report on Atari by saying Rubenstein would have to
wait until November for the Jaguar's San Francisco and New York rollout,
with national distribution coming in 1994.

He then pointed out that 3DO is going to the stores now. For $700. CBS
This Morning anchor Harry Smith asked Weisbaum, "Who's going to pay that?"

Weisbaum answered, "They [3DO] say people will for brand new technology."

He also added that the machines (both 3DO and Jaguar) will be able to
connect to digital networks to enable players to play games linked across
the country.

Harry Smith neatly summed up the segment, "Hot stuff, Herb."

Notes:

////  From the background I was given, CBS was planning a story on 3DO,
when they heard about Atari's Jaguar. After spending 4 hours at Atari on
Tuesday, they felt that it was worthy to include it in their story.

////  The Atari logo and Fuji shown in the broadcast should be part of
what appears when you power up a Jaguar without a cartridge or CD-ROM
installed.

////  I reached Herb Weisbaum later in the day by phone, and asked him
what were his personal impressions on both machines. He declined to take a
stand on that, saying, "At this moment, I have trouble playing Pong."

////  Atari Corp. also confirmed via phone that the Atari Jaguar will
retail for $249. This includes one controller and one pack-in game.

////  CBS This Morning airs weekdays on most CBS stations from 7am to 9am
(Eastern and Pacific times) and 6am to 8am (Central time).

/// Usenet Review:  Magic Workbench
    -------------------------------
    By Thomas Baetzler
    (s_walter@irav1.ira.uka.de)



PRODUCT NAME

        MagicWB

BRIEF DESCRIPTION

        A collection of icons to replace the standard Commodore-supplied
icons.  To quote from MagicWB's ReadMe file:

                "[This] is not 'just another useless Icon compilation!' It
        is far more different. [...] This package contains all standard
        system icons and more (actually 60 different icons) painted in a new
        completely different style: They look very 3-dimensional, have 8
        colors, have gradient fills, feature click-and-push animation if
        being clicked onto to simulate a pushed button and even more..."

        Address:        Parkstr. 11

                        XEN@NATHAN.ZER         (Z-Netz)


SHAREWARE FEE

        DM 20.00 or $20.00 (US)


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE

                If you don't have the AGA chipset, I strongly recommend a
                flicker fixer or some kind of graphics board that lets you
                use the Workbench in a flicker free HighRes-Interlaced or
                better display mode.  While MagicWB can be installed on any
                kind of system, it doesn't look too good on displays with
                non-proportional pixels. For example, a 640x200 display
                would make the MagicWB icons look much too tall.

                To unpack the MagicWB archive, you'll need at least 1.7
                megabytes of RAM or hard disk space.  Installation might be
                difficult on floppy-based systems with less than 2 MB of
                memory and custom Workbench disks.

        SOFTWARE

                The MagicWB icons are created using the enhanced AmigaDOS 2.x
                coloring scheme, so you'll need at least Workbench 2.0.  If
                you want to use one of the fancy backdrop patterns, you'll
                also need to pick up the "NickPrefs" package by Nicola
                Salmoria, which can be found on AmigaLibDisk (Fish Disk) 780.


COPY PROTECTION

        None.  However, all MagicWB icons are marked with a tooltype

                ">>>>>>Icon by Martin Hottenloher <<<<<<".


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        My test setup includes:

        o       Amiga 2000, ECS chipset, Kickstart 2.04, Workbench 2.1
        o       Commodore A2630 68030 accelerator with 4 MB of 32-bit memory
        o       Commodore A2320 FlickerFixer
        o       Picasso II Graphics Enhancer
        o       CTX 14" MultiScan Monitor


REVIEW

        I'll admit I had to be forced to try out the MagicWB package.  I had
been using the normal 4 color HighRes Workbench for ages, and I saw no need
to change things around, especially not to some colorful interlaced mode.
But then my Picasso II arrived, and peer pressure got the better of me.  Now
I'm perfectly happy with the new look of my Workbench, and I'm not thinking
of switching back any more.

        The installation should prove no major problem once you've read the
"LIKES AND DISLIKES" and "BUGS" sections of this review.  Just go ahead and
see what you get!  Alternatively, you can have a look at Martin's Workbench
by clicking on the "Show MagicWB" icon.  Modifications include the switch to
an interlaced display with eight colors.  Also, all of the standard system
icons will be replaced with their MagicWB counterparts.  The supplied utility
"Update Drawers" brings the new "Magic" look to directory structures on
other partitions of your system.  Once you're done, you will see the new
professional look of your Workbench.

        MagicWB also comes with a large collection of nice-looking backdrops
that can be installed on your Workbench.  They sure do look nice, but if
your Workbench version is lower than 3.0, you need NickPrefs to install
them.  See "BUGS" on my experiences with this package.

        You pay for all that glitz with some trade-offs:  the MagicWB icons
are quite a bit larger in size than the old ones, so they take up much more
space on your hard disk.  They also take longer to load, since the
installation seems to fragment your hard disk a bit.  However, this is
quickly cured by backing up and restoring the disk, defragmenting it.
Alternatively, if you're courageous enough, you might try one of those fancy
disk reorganisation programs.

        Switching from 4 colors non-interlaced to 8 colors interlaced also
carries some performance penalties on older systems, since the increased DMA
bandwidth required to display such a mode effectively slows down blitter
operation.  If you wish you had your old fast-scrolling shell back, you might
try Bernhard Moellemann's ScreenManager, which lets you open a dedicated
public screen in your favourite screen resolution to run your shell(s) on.
This shouldn't be a problem on AGA machines!

        Running MagicWB on the Picasso II graphics board in 800x600 pixel
resolution is a pleasure to behold! :-)

        Another problem of running an interlaced display is the inevitable
flicker in the first scan line of the display that my A2320 display enhancer
creates.  A cheap work-around to this is using the "BorderBlank" commodity
which can be found in the subdirectory os20/util on the Aminet ftp sites.  I
remember having heard of some program that would blank the first line of the
display to avoid that problem, but I seem unable to get a pointer to it.  Any
suggestions?

        [MODERATOR'S NOTE:  Some monitors allow the first line of the
        display to be raised high enough to be hidden by the monitor border
        itself.  This is another way to solve the problem.  I do this at
        home on my NEC 5fg.  - Dan]

        You might also run into trouble trying to run your collection of
hard-disk-installed games.  Some commercial games evidently don't like
interlaced Workbench displays!  You can kludge around this by fixing them
with a startup-procedure that explicitly switches back to a non-interlaced
screenmode of your choice.  The "ScreenMode" preferences program supplies a
"Use" keyword that lets you specify a screenmode preferences file to use.

        Having all those old-style icons lying around on your Workbench tends
to be a problem, too.  Don't be afraid to try to create your own icons!  All
you need is IconEdit and some paint package!  Maybe Martin Huttenloher will
provide generic MagicWB icon layout templates in IFF format in a future
release!


DOCUMENTATION

        MagicWB comes with a large, 58 kilobyte ReadMe file, detailing the
installation, history and concept of MagicWB.  There's also a license
agreement and the usual plea for shareware contributions.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

        I don't like the way the MagicWB installation copies its new icons
over the existing ones, overwriting your existing tooltypes, and without
saving the old icons first.  The installation should provide an option to
back up the old icons someplace. A suitable method would be to "cd" to the
SYS: partition and run something like

                1> cd sys:
                1> lha -r a old_icons #?.info

which recursively collects all existing icon files into an archive.  Now, if
you want to restore your old icons after you have installed MagicWB, this is
done easily by unpacking the archive again:

                1> lha x old_icons

        Copying over the old tooltypes to the new icons is a bit more
difficult.  This should be handled in an updated version of the installation
program.  Maybe Martin Hutteloher could try out Stefan Winterstein's
"ICONtrol", which can be found on AmigaLibDisk (Fish Disk) 603.  This
utility lets one replace the image of an existing icon with that from
another icon.

        Giving away a fully operational shareware package shows the author's
trust in the Amiga community.  However, my personal feeling is that more
people would be willing to register if the author made clear what kind of
incentives he's offering.  You know, I just love to have those shareware
registration certificates and specially labeled disks around. :-)

        While MagicWB includes all of the standard icons, you'll probably
discover that there are thousands of old-style icons left on your Workbench.
:-(  Converting all of them over to the new "Magic" look should prove too
hard a task for any single user.  In an effort to motivate other users to
contribute their custom-made MagicWB icons to a common pool, I've uploaded
the archive "MagicIcons.lha" to the directory wb/misc on the Aminet ftp
sites.  New icons include my favourite commodities like "Tool Manager",
"TWA", "ASwarm", "MFR" and "Exploding Layers".


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        I've seen a lot of icon collections in my time, but there's nothing
that comes close to MagicWB in quality.


BUGS

        The "Unpack MagicWB" script didn't work properly for me.  The
dearchiver complained that it had problems creating some files. This is
either fixed by unpacking the archive from hand, or by replacing the call of
"lhx" in the script with a call of LhA.

        I experienced random crashes and gurus after installing a full
MagicWB.  At first I figured it might be a problem with my newly-acquired
A2060, the the new release of the Picasso II software, or even a nasty
virus. However, by chance I was pointed to the true culprit:

> From: Tom Jones <1:147/2020.5@fidonet>

> Newsgroup: fidonet.AMIGA
> Message-ID: 3e3af5da%FidoNet@p5.f2020.n147.z1.fidonet.org
> Subject: Majic WB gotcha!

> I just solved a problem someone else might find interesting to know

> had not happened before, now it was every other message.

> To cut to the chase, I found one thing that cured it:  not using NickPrefs
[...]

> Tom

I'm forwarding a bug report to Nicola Salmoria.

        [MODERATOR'S NOTE:  I have seen many reports on USENET that NickPrefs
        may cause system crashes, especially under Kickstart 3.0.  - Dan]


VENDOR SUPPORT

        Quoting Martin Huttenloher:  "Registered users will receive one free
update of MagicWB on a specially labeled disk.  Further updates will be
available for a nominal fee covering postage and handling; i.e.,  about DM 5
or $5 (US)."


WARRANTY

        None.


CONCLUSIONS

        MagicWB gives your Amiga Workbench that professional look that you've
come to envy on systems like NeXT. You really should give it a try. I'd rate
it 4.5 stars out of 5.

/// BIX - Byte Information Exchange             Lots of information!
    -------------------------------


BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and enthusiasts.
While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is the place for 
knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  You're likely 
to find many others in similar situations who can offer advice, give 
technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.

BIX is divided into areas called conferences, each devoted to a 
particular area of interest.  They range from algorithms to windows,
from writers to amiga.  Conferences are categorized into groups,
usually referred to as exchanges, so that you can browse through
whatever groups interest you and see a list of the conferences it 
contains.

These are some of the exchanges on BIX:

amiga.exchange - the place for Amiga developers and enthusiasts
byte - the full text of each issue of BYTE magazine; source code too 
e.and.l - Entertainment and Leisure; music, pets, games, more
ibm.exchange - everything from OS/2 to PC clones
mac.exchange -  Mac news, support, software, advice
professionals - consultants, engineers, financiers gather here
programmers - some of the best brains in the business!
wix - the Information Exchange for Windows; Windows Magazine online
writers.ex - the professional and amateur writer's exchange


************FULL INTERNET ACCESS!************

BIX also features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription.

New users can call and get ANY copy of Amiga Report.  These are considered
"free" downloads, they do not count against any file ratio.  The latest issue
of Amiga Reports can be Freq'ed (FileREQusted) from here as "AR.LHA", as "AR"
or as ARxxx.LHA where xxx is the issue number.
 
For users interested in reading AR, but who do not have access to AmigaGuide,
you can freq ARBUL and get the AR in bulletin form.  This service is provided
for persons who do not have Amigaguide (such as IBM users).  Please note that
any pictures distributed with the "regular" Amiga Reports archive will NOT be
sent with this freq.  This file is not available for dial-in users, but you
can read bulletin #22 with your capture buffer open and get the same file.
