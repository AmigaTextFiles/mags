First, a correction.  In last week's editorial, I said that Nintendo's new
game system was called Saturn.  That is incorrect.  Their new system is
Project Reality.  Saturn is Sega's new system.

Not much in the magazine this week in terms of features.  All of the new
writers with new columns seem to have bailed on me.  Jason Compton is
taking the week off, so it leaves us with two Usenet Reviews.  Oh well.
I tried to make up for it with plenty of stuff in CPU Report and AR Online.
I hope it balances out.

The weather is still nuts here in the Midwest.  We had a bout of below
zero temps for a few days, then it teases us with a three day blast into
the mid 50's.  Now it's about 15° outside, and we have 4" of snow on the
ground.  Sheesh.

Only two more days until the premiere of Babylon 5, at least here in
Omaha.  I know some areas of the country have already seen it.  I guess
it's going to be how a lot of the country gets Star Trek and DS9 a week
late.

I just spoke with a few people that have already seen it, and the
like/dislike rate is about 50/50.  I hope it turns out well.  They've put
a lot of work into the show, and it's a great way to showcase the Amiga's
talent.

                     ** Microsoft Profits Up 22% **

   A 22 percent jump in profit for the second quarter has been reported
by Microsoft Corp. Microsoft earned $289 million, or 95 cents a share,
in the most recent quarter, up from $236 million, or 78 cents a share,
in the year-ago quarter. Revenues rose to $1.22 billion from $938
million.


              ** HP Color Printer Sales Doubled in '93 **

   Hewlett-Packard Co. reports that it more than doubled its color
printer sales last year. HP says it sold approximately 2 million color
inkjet DeskJet printers worldwide in 1993, a 122% increase over 1992 when
the company sold nearly 900,000 units. HP color printer sales in 1991
were 120,000.

   HP's says its sale of 2 million color DeskJet printers represents a
figure greater than all other makes of color printers combined, based on
statistics supplied by BIS Strategic Decisions, a market research firm
located in Norwell, Mass.  HP notes that it has sold more than 10 million
monochrome and color inkjet printers since its first model was introduced
in 1984.


                 ** Digital Reports 2nd Quarter Loss **

   Digital Equipment Corp. today reported a second quarter loss of $72.1
million, compared with a loss of $73.9 million for the same period a year
ago. The computer maker continues to face a tough recovery with revenues
for the quarter down 12% to $3.25 billion, compared to $3.69 billion in
the fourth quarter of 1992.


                  ** PC World to List Top Computers **

   PC World this week introduced the PC World Top 20, a monthly listing
of the industry's leading PCs. Beginning with its February issue, the PC
World Top 20 will each month provide readers with a top-down ranking of
the PCs that were analyzed by the PC World Test Center.

   "The PC World Top 20 ranks the first time a monthly computer
publication has responded to the ever-shortening PC product cycles --
which is roughly six months for R&D, three months to promote and sell,
and three months to 'unload' the product," says PC World's
Editor-in-Chief Phil Lemmons. "The PC market is moving so incredibly fast
that buyers need continuously updated information and recommendations."

   The PC World Top 20 will be comprised of three PC categories -- the
Top 20 Power Desktops, the Top 20 Budget Desktops, and the Top 20 Mobile
PCs (10 power notebooks/subnotebooks and 10 budget notebooks and
subnotebooks). The top five products in each of these categories will be
honored as the monthly "Best Buy."


  ** Sega to Work With Microsoft on New Operating System for Games **

   Microsoft Corp. has agreed to supply Japan's Sega Enterprises Ltd.
with a new operating system for Sega's 32-bit home video game player,
"Saturn," to be released in November.

   A spokesman with Sega, Japan's largest maker of commercial-use
amusement equipment,  said the two firms also are considering cooperating
in developing new game software.

   Saturn is to have two 32-bit RISC (reduced instruction set computing)
chips in its central processing unit. Reports says Sega plans to sell it
for less than $450.

   Sega's move follows an announcement last week by Japan's consumer
electronics giant Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. that it planned
for the launch on March 20 of a 32-bit home entertainment player jointly
developed with 3DO Co. of the United States, and six software titles.


             ** Tektronix Unveils Desktop Color Printers **

   Tektronix Inc. this week announced the Phaser 220i and Phaser 220e
thermal transfer color printers. The 600 by 300 dots-per-inch units
output at two pages per minute, feature network connectivity options and
print on most laser papers.

   The Phaser 220 printers include dual-tray configuration options, large
tray and ribbon capacities and automatic ink- level sensing to minimize
the need for printer maintenance or operator attendance.

   The Phaser 220e and 220i are priced at $3,995.00 and $5,995.00,
respectively.  Both printers are available now.


               ** America Online Subscriber Rate Jumps **

   "As a result of strong word of mouth and a growing list of partners
who bundle America Online with their products, our subscriber growth has
continued to accelerate," said Steve Case, president and CEO. "These new
bundling agreements can help us attract new PC owners, further increasing
our market share."

   Dell, a leading manufacturer of personal computers, will now include
America Online with all of its PCs sold through consumer channels. By
preinstalling the Windows version of America Online in these computers,
Dell purchasers will see an icon representing America Online on their
Windows desktop. This will provide quick and easy access to the America
Online service.

   US Robotics, a leading manufacturer of modems, will expand their
bundling agreement with America Online to include their entire line of
consumer modems. US Robotics' Macintosh line of modems began bundling
America Online last year.

   "As 1994 unfolds, we plan to continue to expand bundling and content
partnerships because we believe they help us attract and retain
customers.  We plan to continue to add compelling content in a number of
areas such as news, personal finance and shopping," Case added. "By
making it easier for consumers to try our services, and providing them
with compelling reasons to continue as customers, we believe we are
well-positioned to take advantage of the encouraging market trends for
consumer online services."

   America Online, Inc., based in Vienna, is a leading provider of online
services to consumers. The company offers its more than 550,000
subscribers a wide variety of services, including electronic mail,
conferencing, software, computing support, interactive magazines and
newspapers, and online classes. Founded in 1985, the company has
established strategic alliances with dozens of companies including Time
Warner, CNN, The New York Times, Knight Ridder, Tribune Company, IBM and
Apple. Personal computer owners can obtain America Online software at
major retailers and bookstores, or by calling 800-827-6364.


                  ** Government Sued Over Database **

   Tax Analysts, a nonprofit publisher of legal information, has filed
suit in federal court asking for portions of the Department of Justice
(DOJ) JURIS database under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

   The dispute concerns public records which West Publishing, a private
company, provided to the Department of Justice for use in its JURIS
online Computer Assisted Legal Research (CALR) database system.

   The data are public records and, by federal law, not copyrightable.
West, however, claims that it owns the arrangement of the data, and the
Department of Justice is not free to release it.

   JURIS was established initially for DOJ's use.  The President, by
Executive Order 12146 (July 18, 1979), directed DOJ and its head, the
Attorney General, to expand JURIS for use throughout the government legal
community. All federal agency users share the cost of JURIS operation,
database management and improvements.

   JURIS is organized into and contains federal case law material,
statutory law, digest material, tax documents, Federal regulations,
Federal manuals, work product material, legislative histories, federal
administrative law opinions and decisions, treaties, DOJ publications on
the FOIA and other such legal materials. The basis of the suit is that a
federal agency should not be making exclusive arrangements to give away
public data to a private company.

   The lawsuit will be heard by U.S. District Court Judge Richey, the
same jurist who is presiding over an FOIA case involving public access to
electronic mail records.


               ** Autodesk Ships AutoSketch Release 2 **

   Autodesk Inc. is now shipping AutoSketch Release 2 for Windows, a 2-D,
CAD-based drawing package.

   Autodesk notes that the software "combines the power and precision of
computer-aided design with the freedom of an illustration program by
providing tools for creating sketches, technical drawings, diagrams and
information-based graphics and presentations."

   The latest AutoSketch release features a new user interface, as well
as improved file import/export capabilities and additional drawing tools.
It also offers expanded CAD functionality and interoperability.

   AutoSketch Release 2 software is now available through Autodesk
resellers and the retail channel at a suggested price of $299. Existing
AutoSketch customers can upgrade to Release 2 for $99 (certain
restrictions
may apply).


                 ** OS/2, Valuepoint Machines Unite **

   In a move intended to sharpen its appeal to business, government and
other commercial customers, IBM PC Co. this week begins bringing its PS/2
and ValuePoint products under one brand team.

   While PS/2 and ValuePoint computers will maintain their different
labels for the time being, they will be sold by one team to be known as
the Commercial Desktop brand, with Stephen Cohen, who led PS-2 marketing,
directing the group. (The ValuePoint brand was designed to offer less
costly models that are updated more frequently than PS/2.)

   He said IBM will continue to develop PS/2 and ValuePoint computers
separately, partly because they have different technical designs for how
information is moved inside them.


          ** James Buckley Appointed President of Apple USA **

   Apple Computer Inc. this week appointed James J. Buckley, 43, as
president of Apple USA effective immediately. Reports say that Buckley
will be responsible for all of the division's sales, marketing, channel,
customer service and support activities.

   A nine-year veteran of Apple Computer, Buckley was most recently vice
president and general manager for Apple USA's Higher Education division
and was responsible for directing all sales, marketing, customer support
and service operations to 3,500 colleges and universities in the United
States.

   Buckley held positions as Apple USA's vice president and general
manager for Northern Operations in Norwalk, Connecticut, vice president
and general manager for Apple's Central Operations Group located in
Chicago, area sales director of Apple's U.S. North Central Area, and
director of educational sales at the company's Cupertino headquarters.


    ** Apple Introduces Macintosh Performa Money Edition Computer **

   Money Magazine and Apple Computer have teamed up to create the
Macintosh Performa 560 Money Edition, a multimedia computer designed
especially for those who want to take advantage of the latest technology
to manage their personal finances.

   Reports say the system features popular personal finance and
organizational programs such as WealthBuilder by Money magazine, Quicken,
MacInTax, Willmaker and Personal Recordkeeper; the ClarisWorks integrated

              Comp.Sys.Amiga.Reviews Announces Micro-Reviews

           Introducing... Micro-Reviews!  (Very easy to write!)


        I would like to introduce a new kind of review that will appear in
comp.sys.amiga.reviews.  (Thanks to Benbuck Nason, bigben@netcom.com, for
this suggestion.)  Introducing... the micro-review!  It's only one line
long... so easy that anybody can write one in seconds!!!

        Just rate the programs you like or dislike, using a simple scale
(described below).  I will collect the ratings, compute the averages, and
post the cumulative results once every month.

        That's it!!

        Here is an example of a micro-review submission.  Complete
instructions are below.

========================================================================
To: amiga-reviews-submissions@math.uh.edu
Subject: micro-review

SpamWriter              | Fooblat Software              | ***
Bunny Blaster Wars      | Peter Gunn                    | *
BLAZEMONGER             | BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED      | *****+
========================================================================

COMPLETE (SIMPLE) INSTRUCTIONS

(1)     Address your e-mail to amiga-reviews-submissions@math.uh.edu.

(2)     Make the subject of your letter:

                Subject: micro-review

(3)     Rate the products, one per line, listing the product name,
        author/company name, and the rating, in order, SEPARATED BY "|"
        SYMBOLS.  It doesn't matter how many spaces or tabs you use between
        these three fields, as long as you use "|" symbols to separate them.
        (See the example above.)

        Please use the following 5-star rating scale:

                *       Bad.        Avoid this product!
                **      Fair.       It is useful but needs big improvements.
                ***     Average.    It works OK.  Nothing fancy.
                ****    Good.       It works well.  You like using it.
                *****   Excellent.  It works wonderfully.

        In addition, you may optionally add a plus sign ("+") to your rating
        to increase it.  For example:

                *+      Bad, but not ALL bad.
                **+     Slightly below average.
                ***+    Above average.
                ****+   Very good.
                *****+  One of THE BEST programs you have EVER used.

        Remember:  FIRST choose the number of stars, and THEN add a plus
        if the product deserves it.

        I stole this scale from Peter Thelen (ptlk@netcom.com) because I
        think it is very simple to use.  He uses it for rating music.
        Thanks Peter! :-)

THE MONTHLY REPORT

        Each month, I will post a report which lists for each product:

                o       The average (mean and median) ratings.
                o       The number of submissions.

        This is an experiment which will succeed or fail based on your
participation.  Let's give it a try!!  Please take a few minutes and rate
some hardware and software products to help your fellow Amiga users.

                          AGE Announces PARANOIA


                         Sunday, January 9th, 1994
                         Calgary, Alberta, Canada

AGE Entertainment Software is pleased to publicly announce today, the
impending release of their first game for the Commodore Amiga computer
platform, Paranoia.

Paranoia is a first-person, scrolling action adventure game which takes
elements from popular role playing games like Dungeon Master and Ultima
Underworld while maintaining action elements usually present in games more
like Alien Breed or Uridium and mixes it all together with elements from
popular science fiction films like Alien and Star Wars.

The player takes the place of a member of the crew from an interstellar
starship which is transporting cargo through the cosmos.  The ship is
attacked by an unknown alien race for no apparent reason, and the ship
is boarded by "Hoarders", creatures which roam the dark hallways of the
ship in search of human prey.  The player must find an escape off this
death trap in an adventure that will keep players on the edge of their
seat all te way throgh.Obstacles must be overcome, and puzzles solved
in this epic story of  rutine trip gone bad.

Combine all this action and adventure with a mixture of graphics rendered
with NewTek's amazing LightWave 3.0 and digitized clay animation and you
have an experience like nothing anyone has ever seen before on a personal
computer.

Should players succeed in this harrowing mission of mercy, they can continue
on in the story of this lonely crusader in Paranoia 2: Colony.  This story
picks up where the first left off, with our hero landing his escape vehicle
on a nearby planet which harbours a colony filled with mystery. Then,
finally, comes the third and last game in the Paranoia trilogy.  Paranoia 3:
Revenge goes to the home planet of the "Hoarders" and takes our hero along
for the ride.  Follow amazing plot twists and unparalleled action sequences
in an unprecedented game series.

Paranoia will be available first quarter, 1994 from:

TITLE

     Colonial Conquest

VERSION

     1.05

COMPANY

     None

AUTHOR

     Christian Mumenthaler
     mumi@molbio.ethz.ch

DESCRIPTION

     Colonial Conquest is a space strategy game for one or
     two persons. The aim of each player is to colonialize a
     maximum of the 26 earth-like planets that are shown on
     the universe map. Every planet has its own surface map
     composed of oceans, forests, mountains, deserts etc.
     where different machines (power-plants, irrigation
     robots, space port etc.) have to be built to guarantee
     a rapid growth and a high production of the colony.
     People can direct the machines or work as scientists
     which will make the technology level rise and allow new
     inventions (battlestars, planet scanners, energy
     cannons etc.).
     Five different types of space ships will compose each
     player's army and conquer planets for him.
     The game is easy to handle as it has an intuitive,
     mouse-based interface. It also has decent graphics with
     some rendered HAM images.

NEW FEATURES

     V1.05 fixes some bugs of the previous version and adds
     some new features that were asked from the people who
     wrote to me about the game.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Colonial Conquest is a PAL game. Besides this, it
     should work on ALL Amigas. (Tested on A4000 and A2000)

     Use Left-Amiga + A to multitask.

                             RenderCalc v1.41


TITLE

    RenderCalc


VERSION

    V1.41 (First Release)


AUTHOR

    Daniel S. Milling Jr. (dan@chaos.mcs.mu.edu) or
                          (milling@studsys.mscs.mu.edu)

DESCRIPTION

    RenderCalc v1.41 incorporates three tools into one program:

      - FRAME CALCULATOR: The ability to calculate the number of animation
        frames needed to represent a moving object of known speed and known
        linear distance travelled relative to any one of the three supported
        time code formats.

      - UNITS CONVERTER: The ability to quickly and easily convert numbers
        between different common units of length.

      - TIMECODE CALCULATOR: The ability to easily and quickly calculate
        Time Code durations from IN and OUT points and also to calculate a
        timecode OUT point from an IN point and a duration.  These
        conversions may be done interchangeably between the three supported
        time code formats.

    Some feature of the program are:

      o Ability to enter values for Speed and Distance and receive output
        telling you how many total frames, seconds, minutes and the length of
        time, in the specified timecode format, that the motion will take.

      o Table of conversions between units of length.  Supported units are
        inches, feet, yards, miles, millimeters, meters and kilometers.

      o Ability to change the units of ANY inputted number and have all of
        the values update, relative to the new units, on the fly.  This
        saves having to re-enter the values again.

      o SMPTE non-drop frame, EBU and Film time code formats supported.

      o Ability to enter Timecode In and Out points as well as a Duration.
        The time code input has two modes of operation.  You may enter
        Timecode In and Timecode Out points which results in Duration being
        the final output value.  You may also enter a Timecode In and a
        Duration which will give you the Timecode Out as your final value.

      o Ability to change the Timecode Type 'on the fly.'  This means that
        you may switch between the supported time code formats and see the
        updated results immediately without having to re-enter the values.

      o Keyfile system which allows for easy registration.  Upon registration,
        you will receive a personalized ASCII keyfile which will permanently
        remove ALL instances of the Shareware Notice for this and all
        future revisions of the program.

      o Many more, listed in the doc file.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

   - OS 2.04 (V37+) or higher.
   - asl.library version 37 or above (38 or above is recommended)

     mikeh@starnine.com

     Also author of JForth Professional and LCD Calculator.

DESCRIPTION

     Textra is the User-Friendly text editor for the Amiga.
     It contains a fully-Intuitionized GUI as well as an
     ARexx interface with 70+ commands.  The package
     interfaces with the asl file and font requesters,
     supports multiple windows with cut, copy and paste
     to the clipboard.  Also supported are Undo and Drag-select
     with left mouse button, background printing and ARexx
     script execution, user-settable preferences which can
     be saved.  The editor displays fast text and
     continuous-movement vertical and horizontal scroll bars.

     The package contains full, detailed documentation,
     40+ Arexx scripts (including an interactive tutorial)
     and a hard disk installer program.

     Scripts are provided to integrate Textra with
     JForth Professional 3.x, SAS/C, HSPascal and Paul Kienitz's
     Q-Blue Offline Mail Reader program.

NEW FEATURES

   o  Textra now includes a full-featured interface to the popular
      SAS/C development environment, developed and generously
      contributed by one of SAS Institute's own!
   o  The new MARKS facility allows you to assign any selected
      text to a logical name of up to 31 chars long.  Any number
      of assignments can be made.
   o  Users may now opt to use the ASL File requester in place of
      the native Textra file requester.  Default is the Asl requester.
   o  Under 2.0 or later, the CUT, COPY and PASTE functions now
      operate with the standard clipboard device (unit 0).
   o  This is the first version to be low-memory-failure-proof!
      ANY MEMORY REQUEST FAILURE WILL FLASH THE SCREEN 3 TIMES in
      1 second, then wait until the memory comes available.
   o  Textra now supports just about any mail reader known to
      Amiga-Man!  Textra 1.15 sports both a command-line option
      as well as an ARexx command which tell Textra to
      "hold" the calling program until the specified window
      is closed.
   o  Program now takes note if a file is MSDOS format or Amiga
      format and will preserve the format when saved.
   o  Added the ability to write-protect a window so that it
      cannot be accidentally altered while open.
   o  Before you SAVE a file over an existing disk file, Textra
      now performs some checks that nothing else has messed with
      the file on disk while the editor has held a copy in ram.
   o  Under 2.0 and later, Textra will display the 2.x-style
      'busy pointer'.
   o  14 new ARexx commands, 12 new scripts
   o  Bugs fixed

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     None, but additional functionality if run under 2.0 or later.

PRICE

     $25.00 Shareware fee.

fiction aficionados.  Now Warner Bros. has come up with a tie-in
promotion it hopes will attract both groups to its soon-to-debut
"Babylon 5" adventure series.

Warner Bros. has developed a computerized interactive software
program companion for its Jan. 26 syndication debut of the hour-
long sci-fi series.  The on-line computer program, which the
studio claims is the first interactive program based on a
television series, is intended for viewers who subscribe to the
CompuServe, America On-line or Genie national computer networks.

Designed to further promote the show's debut on Warner Bros.'
ad hoc Prime Time Entertainment Network (PTEN) block, the
interactive kits are being made available to computer users with
either Windows or Macintosh formats.  Stations that air "Babylon
5" will be able to distribute the kits to local user groups and
science fiction clubs.

The kit contains moving video and sound from the series, a full
interactive view of the "Babylon 5" spaceship interior, program
synopses, character descriptions, biographies of the stars, color
photos and production credits.

(End of quote.)

This article was not attributed to any particular writer.
Hopefully whoever wrote it simply left out the detail that this
kit will also be available for Amiga computer users, but I have
no further details and can only assume that the information is
correct and that we will be left out in the cold.  If so, how
ironic that "Babylon 5" owes a deep debt of gratitude to the
Amiga computer and the Video Toaster for its special effects,
and yet they apparently are not making this software kit
available in Amiga format.

Elsewhere in the magazine, I found this address:

                           Warner Bros. International
                           4000 Warner Blvd., The Tower

and do not want any credit for filling you in on this bit of
news.

*** Subj: Amiga Format - Feb Review

OK it's that time of the month again... well it's early, I just did the Jan
review of Amiga Format... well the Feb issue has just hit my letter box.

Ok Coverdisks

Wordworth 3 Demo (very nice it is too)
Fractal Pro (need I say more)
Tornado (won't run as I have a screwed disk) Toado (frogger game)

Certainly the Wordworth 3 demo is worth a look at, problem is they have cut it
down somewhat in order to fit it onto the one disk (Fractal Pro is also on the
same disk). Print out's looked fine, but I could only access the one font they
supplied. Graphically it looks very nice on screen, but I think you will have
to wait for the full version to become available before we can see exactly
what features it will have... who know's it could be a Final Writer beater (I
certainly think Final Writer will have it's work cut out when this finally
gets released).

Also reviewed :

16-bit sound cards
Disk Expander
Emplant 3.4 (bit behind the times on this one.. it's at 3.7)
Trapfax (again)?
Rainbow III graphics card
Typesmith 2
Designer Objects 1 - The Diner
Upper Disk Tools
Playmation
ProText 6

Plus there is all the usual games reviews.

Right onto the news section.

The one thing that I found most interesting was the bit about Commodore's
advertising in the UK (YES they are doing it)! One of the things they have
been doing is plastering large Hoarding signs all over the place - get this
- they placed a LARGE advert on the hoarding right outside the main
entrance of Sega's headquarters in London !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Laugh - I
nearly died :^)
There is a picture in AF showing the main building with Sega in large
letters on the side of the buliding  - and the hoarding. The advert says
"To be this good will take Sega ages" on the right hand side is a picture
of the CD32 console, with the words under it, "Amiga CD32".
It's placed so that the Sega employee's would see it every day they went to
work :)
Now if that's not Commodore's way of saying "Spin on this" I don't know what
is.

Finally news of the Amiga CD only magazine, apparently the original issue
never got into print (it was supposed to have started last year) - but all is
not lost, the new CD magazine will be going on sale in April, it has no title
at the moment, but is being published by the same people who do Amiga Format
(and Amiga Shopper, Amiga Power). It will have a cover mounted CD with the
latest game demo's and public domain games. The magazine will also cover
things relating to the FMV module as well.

Right that just about covers it for this issue.

Tim

*** From: Steve Slatin (40:708/10.0)
*** To  : IVS users
*** Subj: Probs. with IVS Trumpcar


I was hoping someone out there may have had a problem similar
to mine, and found a solution ...

I have an A-500 with IVS Trumpcard Pro w/84 meg Seagate HD.
The drive was formatted and partitioned with the IVS software.
My ROM is 2.04, running WorkBench 2.1.

I have occasional lockups (I don't know what better to call them)
in which the drive goes to access, but the procedure doesn't 
ever finish.  Often the green "operating" light on the drive box
stays on.  The mouse continues to move the cursor, and the 
gadget to push windows forward and back works, but other functions
don't -- the keyboard won't do anything, and if I double click on 
a drive or drawer, it will open a window but nothing comes up
in it.  

In any event, the drive doesn't access again when I do this, even
if the green light is off.  When the green light is off, I _can_
reboot successfully with Ctrl-A-A, but if I try with the green
light on, it stays on -- so I can reboot from floppy, but not
HD.

I tried replacing my 8520's, but the problem remained.

Someone on a local BBS solved a similar problem by lowering the 
MaxTransfer rate.  (He did not have an IVS.)  He did this from
HDToolbox.  I can't get mine to work, though I have edited the
tool type on my HDDisk tool to have a line that reads 
"SCSI_DEVICE_NAME=IVSSCSIpro.DEVICE, and I have IVS_SCSIpro.device
in the DEVS drawer.  IF I load up the HDToolbix, though, it always
gives me the message "driver not installed".

I can't figure out how to lower the MaxTransfer rate from the 
TCUtils menu, either.

Has anyone else with a similar problem figured out how to get
around this logjam?  (i.e., how to use HDToolbox to accept the driver, or to
lower MaxTransfer without using HDToolbox.)  I'll 
try most anything, it's getting to be personal ....

*** Subj: Probs. with ivs trumpcar

First, you don't need to use HDToolBox and it's not recommended. If you double
click on the partition in the TCUtils you will get another window that has the
information you want to change.

But changing the Max Transfer would just be a kludge and not fix the real
problem at hand.  You are getting SCSI Bus lockups.  This can be caused by a
bad cable, improper termination, insuffient power, bad controller card.  They
should be checked in that order.

Since you only have one drive, your setup is rather simple.  One cable and
both the Trumpcard Pro and the drive should be terminated.  Remember
terminaters that are plugged in backwards will cause problems.  There is a dot
on the terminator to denote pin 1.

If you have alot of stuff connected to your A500, it could be that your are
overloading your power supply.

Or it could just be a bad card.  But I doubt it, bad cards usally don't work
at all.

It's best not you use HDToolBox,  our utilities do everything HDToolBox does,
and HDToolBox doesn't know about our caching or updated drives. So by using
HDToolBox you would not have a read cache and you would be running with older
device drivers.

For more help,  Let me know more about your system.  What's in it. What
revision of our software you have.  The latest is 2.1c.

You can also get help and/or download newer software from the IVS BBS @ (714)

*** Subj: Piccolo

 Hi there

  I bought the Piccolo gfx board two days ago and I'm still not happy
 with it. The board works great when I use EGS-software or when I re-
 direct applications which use their own screen to the  Picasso. So I
 suppose there is no hardware problem. The  problem starts when I try
 to use one of the Piccolo resolutions for the  Workbench screen with
 the screenmode preferences program. After selecting the 'use' button
 the screen just becomes white, or shows garbage. In the  latter case
 the mouse  pointer is still  visible. The  garbage is obviously pro-
 duced by the  Amiga  graphics, so the  Piccolo  grapics are not even
 activated (I tried this  connecting one  monitor to  the display en-
 hancer and another to the Piccolo board).

  In short: The Workbench emulation  only works on  screens opened by
 applications. But using Piccolo screenmodes for the Workbench screen
 does not work.

  I use the following system configuration:

 A2000 Rev. 6.2 (~ 3 years old)
 Nexus SCSI adapter with 2MB RAM (16 bit)
       Quantum LPS 52
       Quantum ELS 85
 A2630 Processor board (68030) with 4MB RAM (32 bit)
 A2320 Display Enhancer
 Kickstart 37.175  (2.04)
 Workbench 38.35   (2.1)

 Piccolo Rev. 2.1 with 2MB.  Jumper set to 'Force Zorro II' (I tried
                             autosensing, though)

 Version numbers of some of the programs ( not all of them have one)
   EGSAmigaDriver   6.011
   EGSPiccoloDriver 6.020
   EGSConfig        6.005
   (This is the software of the most recent update)

 Other errors:
   TV-Paint Junior crashes often immediatly after startup
   Dia sometimes cannot obtain VisualInfo

 PLEASE HELP

  I tried about  everything: I installed a plain  WB2.1 without any
 additional  programs on it's own  partition. I disabled  all other
 partitions so  that no other software  could be loaded. ONLY ORIG.
 WB2.1 PROGRAMS. I tried  both Zorro  jumper positions. I tried one
 and two monitor installations. But nothing worked.
  Has anyone  encountered this  problem  yet? Has  anyone  actually
 solved this problem?

 Thanx for help

 Bruno

16031.3.64.1 Maxis interested again?
1/24/94 23:41 33/1319 EVAlien

I called Maxis today regarding SimFarm and SimCity 2000.  My last question
to them was "And are you still supporting the Amiga platform?"

His response was that they were still selling the inventory that they have
for the Amiga and that the support lines are willing to answer questions
but that their staff might have a problem answering some of the questions
that were really Amiga specific.

He then asked me how much I liked my Amiga.  Informing him that I have
four Amigas he was rather amazed.  Every Amiga owner he had chatted with
told him how much they appreciated their fine little machines but he also
stated that the community of Amiga people was just too small for them to
continue developing for the Amiga.

His questions began to get further and further into depth.  Almost like he
was polling me for information.  "Should we continue developing for the
Amiga?"  "Would it be worth it to look into CD-32?"

Something gave me the impression that this guy was more of a big-wig or
developer than just "tech support".

Any thoughts?

Actually, Maxis itself dropped Amiga development a couple of years
ago. However, they licensed Amiga ports to Mindscape in the UK.
Mindscape did SimLife and whichever one preceded that (SimAnt, I
think). Mindscape _IS_ working on SimCity 2000 for the Amiga, and it's
expected this summer.

I think he probably was just a tech support guy, but Maxis may be
using the tech support lines to do a bit of research.

At any rate, MindScape UK is a huge Amiga developer, and they're still
committed to porting the SimStuff to the Amiga.

Well, last year, I registered 4 shareware packages.  Also from one program
I had released as shareware I recieved about $150 (15 people registered it)
and while it does not seem like much, it was enough to keep me believing
that shareware does work.  I know one person that recieved over 300
registrations for a program.  It does not work as well as selling a
program commercially, but is alot lett work for the author.

Shareware works for good products.

The makers of DOOM have reportedly earned a lot of money.  There are
quite a few other sharewarew "Success Stories".

Me, I register shareware.  I also write shareware - and did abysmally
until PortalX, which has earned me some money (although certainly
not enough to live on).

If you expect to get rich on Shareware, then you'd better put as much
resources into the product as whatever you are competing with.

  I routinly register shareware products.  If I use it regularly I'll send in
the money.  If I find that I only use it once or twice a year I don't bother.

  I do object to people asking a small fortune for their products unless it's
an extremely superior product.  $10-20 seems about right.  I guess that the
$50 I spent for the registered version of DICE was the most I've ever paid.

.../General Q&A, Announcements, and Help!/The Amiga is DEAD and BURIED
16026.3.679.1 The Amiga is DEAD and BURIED
1/27/94 06:02 76/2974 Hubert - Cross


In My Humble Opinion, The Amiga is DEAD and BURIED. I wrote to several
software houses to see if they would be interested in publishing a program
that I wrote. Here are some bits from some of the answers I received:

ELECTRONIC ARTS: ...We are unlikely to publish an Amiga program...

ACCLAIM: ...We are not seeking softare in this category... [Amiga]

KONAMI: ...It has been decided that Konami will no longer publish...
        ...Amiga Software...

IMPRESSIONS: ...at this time we are not accepting any programs
                for Amiga...

GAMETEK: ...Unfortunately, the Amiga software distribution system in
            North America has deteriorated to the point where we are
            no longer publishing new Amiga titles.

            My suggestion would be to approach some European publishers,
            where the Amiga still has a strong (though declining)
            following...

A letter from Europe:

ACCOLADE EUROPE LTD:

         ...Unfortunately, the Amiga market in Europe is declining
            rapidly and we are not, therefore, looking to produce
            further Amiga product...


I also sent a letter to Commodore, explaining clearly that I had written
a game and that I was looking for a publisher. I even enclosed some
color photocopies of my game's screens. They took months to answer:


...Thank you for your letter requesting information. We would like to take
   this opportunity to apologise (sic) for the extreme delay in responding
   to your enquiry...

...It may be that you have now successfully found a resolution to your
   enquiry elsewhere. If you have, could you please still complete the
   section below and return it in the reply paid envelope enclosed, in
   order that we bring this matter to a mutually satisfactory conclusion
   and close your file...

   -------------------------Cut along this Line-----------------------

...Regarding your reference number 1336, I have/have not been able to
   obtain the information required elsewhere. I do/don't require this
   information. (please delete as necessary)...


And then a month latter:

...Further to our recent communication regarding your enquiry. As we
   have received no reply, we therefore presume that you have managed
   to obtain the information you required from an alternative source,
   and as a result have closed your file...

...Should this not be the case...


I still wonder if they ever had an idea of what I wrote them about.


I have also been reading about a CD32 or something that is the future
of Commodore and that is selling 20,000 or 100,000 units a week or
a month or whatever. I have been to Toys -R- Us twice and haven't seen it.
How can they be selling a zillion units a week when I can't even find the
thing on the stores is beyond my comprehension.

I haven't sold my Amiga and gotten a PC only because I spent over $2000 on
the damned thing and now probably nobody would give me even $300 for it.

Comments or flames welcome.

[Editor's Note:  Is this guy asking for trouble, or what??]



.../General Q&A, Announcements, and Help!/PCPursuit ends 1 Apr. 94
16026.3.680.1 you can switch to PortalPursuit
1/27/94 08:38 63/2859 Harv


Please note the following article is cross-posted from PCPursuit's
BBS, The Net Exchange. This is *not* a rumor. If you currently get
to Portal via PCP you will not be able to anymore as of 1 April
1994. Your alternative is to contact Portal (email cs) and ask
to sign up for a Portal Pursuit account. For $30, you get 30 hours
of Portal each month via Sprintnet (up to 9600bps) and there are
other plans for heavier users. Portal Pursuit requires no fancy
indial/outdial or other passwords - its all transparent to the user
plus you get an account reconciliation each time you log off Portal
so you know excactly what you've used each month and how much you
have left that month.

If you use Portal for more than 12 hours each month via SprintNet
you are already paying $30 (12 x $2.50/hr) so it would be wise for
you to switch to Portal Pursuit as you WILL SAVE MONEY! It is a good deal.

Here is Sprint's announcement regarding the cancellation of
PCPursuit services::

------
SERVICE DISCONTINUATION: PC PURSUIT AND PC BUSINESSCALL SERVICES
________________________________________________________________

PC Pursuit and PC BusinessCall Services are being discontinued.
Users will be receiving the following letter via mail.

Thanks,

-support

________________________________________________________________

January 27, 1994


Dear Customer:

Over the past several months, Sprint has conducted a thorough business
evaluation of the PC Pursuit and PC BusinessCall services. Based on the
results of this evaluation, Sprint's PC Pursuit and PC BusinessCall
services will be discontinued, effective April 1, 1994. We regret any
inconvenience that this may cause you.

We are taking this step in order to focus our resources on the growing demand
for local dial-in access to online, "information provider" computer hosts
which are directly connected to SprintNet. The continued growth in the number
and variety of these dedicated hosts and host applications has minimized the
need for PC Pursuit and PC BusinessCall. Today, access to these host-based
applications far surpasses the usage of dial-out access via PC Pursuit and
PC BusinessCall.

Per this notification, your PC Pursuit or PC BusinessCall ID/password will
become inoperable on April 1, 1994. No further charges for these services
will be billed to your credit card or electronic funds transfer account after
the April 1, 1994 date. (Note: Users: If you would like to discontinue your
service prior to April 1, 1994, you may do so here on the Net Exchange via
the "Cancel" option included within the "Questionnaire" section. Type "Q"
to access the questionnaire area, then choose prompt "2", "cancel." Then
answer the prompts requesting your cancellation information). If you have
already recently discontinued your PC Pursuit or PC BusinessCall service,

     Commodore going out of business?
     From: JAKEHAMBY    To: ALL

Just got my shareholder's report from Commodore and they are really screwed
up.  Last fiscal year, they lost $356 million, and had DEFICIT equity of $53
million and deficit working capital of $107 million!  In addition, they're
in default under various credit agreements and a mortgage loan, and they're
worried because many of the companies under which CBM operates, unlike the
U.S., they can't seek judicial protection (a.k.a. Chapter 11) to prevent
liquidation of their assets!  In fact, the CPAs who audited the books
expressed "substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern."

Well, I wouldn't mind so much (I bailed out of Amiga land half a year ago,
caved in and bought a PC [and am loving it!]) except that I own 40 shares in
a stock which isn't worth more than $3 a share on a good day!  Well, maybe
somebody will buy Commodore out, knock some sense into their marketing
division, and start selling some computers.  I can't think of any company
that would want to buy out Commodore, though, except maybe Newtek (and they
probably don't have the capital), or possibly Apple (although it would be
hard, but not impossible, for them to integrate the Amiga somehow with the
Macintosh line).  Maybe Sega or Nintendo, but that's about it.  Actually, in
the latest Ami Report on Delphi, there was a blurb about a Wall Street
Journal article which stated that a company called "Sage Enterprises" wanted
to buy out another company called "CBM".  It could happen...

It really saddens me to say, but the Amiga's been dying for the past year or
so.  And while people have been predicting Commodore's downfall since 1987,
I'm sure that a critical point will be reached before next year.  Either
they get bought out, or they go bankrupt.  And if Commodore files for
bankruptcy, the Amiga will go the way of the TI-99/4A, the Kaypro, and the
VIC-20.  Sad, but true.  I bailed out of the Amiga scene half a year ago,
and have never once regretted it, but I think a lot of people and companies
(Newtek, GVP, etc.) won't, and they'll be riding the S.S. Commodore to their
watery graves.

     RE: Commodore going out of business? (Re: Msg 22265)
     From: PELLEGRINO   To: JAKEHAMBY (NR)


Regarding the possible purchase of Commodore by Newtek or Apple - I just
saw an episode of MacTV tonight spotlighting video products for the Mac. One
of the products was a Video Toaster! Yes, a rep from Newtek was demonstrating
a Toaster as a Mac peripheral utilizing Newtek's Toasterlink software
interface to the Mac. The Newtek rep did a pretty good demo of some simple
Toaster effect as well as talking about its bundled software products
including Lightwave.

Unfortunately, despite the fact that the Toaster was really an Amiga 3000
with a sophisticated board and software inside it and in plain view to the
audience right behind the shows host, neither the words Commodore nor
Amiga were mumbled during the segment. The host kept trying to play up
the Mac sideof things but it was apparent that Toaster did not need any
input of Mac art/video work, just that it is now capable of easily taking
in such works. Maybe that is what Newtek intented in a subtle marketing
attempt. Mmmmmm.......


As an aside, I also saw the first episode in the Babylon 5 series tonight. I
had not seen the pilot episode last year but was blown away at the
sophistication, quality, and length of the animated sequences. In a word...
AWESOME!! What a great advert for the Amiga, Video Toaster, and Lightwave.
Maybe all is not lost.

Ack! It's a slow week. Maybe it's the fog ...or the snow ...could be
that it's just that "blah" feeling of winter setting into everyone's
bones, but nothing much is going on this week in Amiga land.

Well the >>BIG<< news of this week is that I ganglefooked my article
again. The article in AR203 about Aminet was ...well, not quite right.
There was the mention of ab20 being apart of the Aminet. Well I read it
wrong ...the cold gettng to my brain, I guess ...but ab20 was a site
seperate and distinct from Urban Mueller, amiga.physik, and Aminet.
ab20 was one of the places people used to visit and FTP Amiga files.
I suggest reading the article on Aminet that's in AR127. Becuase somehow
I know that if I try to go any futher, I'll mess up the details again :)

The readership of Amiga Report is growing each week. Now I have over
450 people on the mailing list who recieve Amiga Report uuencoded auto-
matically each week in their mailbox. We also have several distribution
sites that carry Amiga Report. My site usually has about 18 people who
call to get AR. AR is also distributed over ADS (FidoNet) and, I think
SAN (FidoNet). 

Now I've tried to figure out how many people read AR each week.
Trying to be conservative I came to the conclusion that at least 730
people read AR each week. 450 for the mailing list, 18*10= 180 from the
distro sites (we have more than 10 distro sites... I was just being 
conservative here), and lets say from all the BBSes that are connected
to FidoNet we have 100 people there.

Geez, why the <beep> am I telling you all this?? Well I figure that if
we have so many readers, it would be great if some of you out there could
lend us a hand and write some articles for AR.

What about?? ....Well, about anything you please, as long in some manner
it would contribute to the Amiga community. People have been asking for
more reviews on software and hardware. More news from Europe and Australia.
I would like to see some news from the former Soviet Block nations describing
what people are doing with the Amiga over there. People have repeatedly
asked for articles on programming...in "C", and "ARexx" as well.

So write about something you think would be interesting to others.
Send digitized pics as well, we'll include them. Don't worry about editing.
We have an editor just waiting to take those articles and incorporate them
into AR. It's hard to come up with something to write about each week.
Especially since this is a voluntary magazine, in which none of the writers
or staff get paid, special bennies, or what-not.

So if you have any idea, articles, please send them to rob_g@cup.portal.com
We'd like to hear from ya!

Two final notes:

On behalf of AR, I would like to extend out thanks to those who
moderate c.s.a.reviews and c.s.a.announce, and to those who write
for those two groups. With out them our readers wouldn't get anywhere
near the information that we currently provide. The information out of
those groups are professionally done without the biased opinions
that the paper mags have to give.

And last, but certainly not least. SUPPORT SHAREWARE!!!
If you use it, send the requested amount to the author. A good
portion of the software that we all use are written as shareware.
Even if the program is freeware, giftware, whatever, send them a note,
donation or whatever. They'll appreciate it, and most of all, it will
encourage them to keep on writing those fantastic programs!!!

The Director positions have three year terms (these two ending in 1996).

The Amendment is an important change to the Company's Articles of 
Incorporation.  It essentially removes the necessary 3/4 vote of all
outstanding shares on decisions by Commodore's Board of Directors to
certain things including mergers, transfers of stock or assets, or loans
over $10 million in value. The possibilities range from selling the company
to just being able to accept larger loans.

PRODUCT NAME

        Picasso II 24bit retargetable graphics board for Amiga 2000, 3000,
4000.

        [MODERATOR'S NOTE:  Over the years, there has been much discussion
        and debate on USENET about the meaning of the term "retargetable
        graphics" or "RTG".  In this review, Humberto Gomez uses the term
        "RTG" as it is found the Picasso II documentation.  Mr. Gomez
        quotes from their manual:

        "The term RTG means - No more CHIP RAM BLUES.  The Picasso II RTG
        emulator has been designed so that it uses no Chip RAM for its
        emulation.  Following Commodore WB4.0 guidelines, the Picasso II
        on-board blitter which supports drawing speeds up to 30 megabytes per
        second can use the RTG to let programs able themselves to run on the
        board instead of the ECS graphics or AGA."

        Mr. Gomez felt strongly about using the term "RTG" in his review,
        even though its use here may be controversial or disputed, so we
        agreed to leave the review as-is and put this disclaimer at the
        top.  - Dan, Moderator of c.s.a.reviews]


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

        This is a 24-bit graphics board that fits inside an Amiga 2000,
3000, 4000.  It is RTG (Retargetable Graphics), and it is a Zorro II card.

LIST PRICE

        It lists for $599.99 (US).  But most places sell it for $449.99
(1 MB version) and $499.99 (2 MB version).


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE

                At least 2 megs of Fast RAM required.

                Monitor? Well it really helps if you have a MultiSync
                monitor if you do not own a 3000. A 3000 uses the
                deinterlacer and can use all resolutions on a regular SVGA
                Monitor.  You only need one monitor, but it has to be at
                least SVGA... not RGB.

                It works on a 68000, but a faster processor is recommended.

        SOFTWARE

                AmigaDOS 1.3 or higher.  Works with AmigaDOS 2.0 and 3.0.

                Under 3.0 I have experienced some problems.  Screen dragging
                jerks, and then also the pointer sometimes gets stuck on the
                menus.  A call to the company verified some problems with
                3.0 screen drawing routines, and the company is working to
                correct the problem.  These 3.0 problems are very minimal
                and due to software, not hardware.


COPY PROTECTION

        None.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        Amiga 3000, 2 megs Chip RAM, 4 megs Fast RAM
        250 meg hard drive.
        AmigaDOS 2.0 and 3.0.

INSTALLATION

        The board installs in an Amiga Zorro slot.

        [MODERATOR'S NOTE:  If you are not comfortable opening up your
        Amiga, then you should have the work done by an authorized Amiga
        service center.  Opening your Amiga yourself may void your warranty,
        and careless work may even damage the machine.  - Dan]

        The software installs using the Commodore Installer utility.  It is
very easy to do.


REVIEW

        I am very happy with this board.  First of all, it fits into a Zorro
II or Zorro III slot.  The board itself is Zorro II.  The back of the board
contains two 15-pin jacks.  One of these is for the Amiga output that goes
into the card.  The other is for a cable (supplied) going from the card to
the monitor.  Requiring only one monitor, the card auto-switches between its
display modes and the Amiga's.  This switching is transparent to the user.
You just use the Amiga as you would normally do. If an Amiga screen is in
the front and a Picasso screen in the back, then you just use the screen
depth gadget as usual, and the board switches to the Picasso screen.

        All Picasso resolutions are available to all programs that let you
select a screen mode.  For those programs that don't let you select a screen
mode, then the Picasso includes a Change Screen Commodity that goes into the
WBStartup drawer (AmigaDOS 2.0 and higher).  This commodity pops up every
time a program is used that does not use a Picasso resolution.  The commodity
gives you the ability to select a Picasso screen for the program to use.
This is useful for ASDG's Art Department Professional (ADPro) and other program
s
that always appear in lo-res.

        ADPro savers are included, along with other graphic programs so that
you can save your images to the Picasso II board for immediate displaying in
any of the resolutions.

        Resolutions include 640x400 with 16 million colors, 800x600 with 16
million colors (with 2 megs installed), 1280x1024 with 256 colors, and many
others.  Anything higher than 800x600 may be displayed with 256 colors.  But
I noticed in ADPro, all of these resoltuions had the ability to display
64,000 colors with no problem.  Many intermediate resolutions are also
available.


IMPORTANT

        AmigaDOS 3.0 is required to select resolutions that have more than
16 colors.  If you do not have 3.0 ,then this board will only give you the
ability to display up to 16 colors for your programs, unless it is a graphic
program that can dump the image directly to the board like ADPro.  But
ProPage, DPaint IV, and all other programs that let you select screen modes
will give you only up to 16 colors in the resolutions supplied.


ADDED BONUS

        The Picasso turns your pointer into a professional hi-res pointer.
Actually your pointer will reflect the resolution that you select.  So if you
select 800x600, then your pointer resizes for that resolution.


LIKES AND DISLIKES ('+' means like, '-' means dislike)

        + I like the ability to use my Amiga programs using the Picasso II
board resolutions.  Under AmigaDOS 3.0, I opened up a 256-color ProPage
screen at 1280x1024, and it displayed all pictures with their colors
correctly.  Very impressive.

        + You can choose the colors using the Palette Preferences program
supplied by Commodore and see all the colors swirl.

        + Includes a 24-bit screen blanker that draws lines in 16.8 million
colors.

        + The autoswitch feature is really nice.

        + It uses the Picasso memory for displaying Picasso screens, leaving
all of your Chip RAM alone.

        + It includes TV PAINT JR.  Graphic viewers are included for display
GIF, IFF, MPEG, and JPEG pictures using the Picasso board.

        - Minor problems with the screens in 3.0.  They wont drag correctly
and the pointer sometimes gets stuck at the menus.

        - The manual is not user-friendly.  Information is not very clear and
it does not explain things very well.  It looks like it is photocopied, not
professional.

        - Some of the programs supplied are in German, not English.

        - It requires AmigaDOS 3.0 to select more than 16 colors in the
resolutions for programs such as ProPage, DPaint, and others.

        - TV Paint JR always says it does not have enough memory for UNDO
buffer, even if you install a full two megs on the board.

        [MODERATOR'S NOTE:  I suspect that TV Paint Jr. is limited by the
        amount of RAM in the Amiga, not just on the Picasso board.  - Dan]


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        GVP's EGS Spectrum ranks slightly higher in my book.  Although this
board is very hard to find with 1 meg on it, the full two megs gives you
higher resolutions than the Picasso II board does.  It also autosenses
whether you have a ZorroII or Zorro III machine and uses whichever one your
machine has for better throughput.  No problems with AmigaDOS 3.0 experienced
yet with this board.

        Besides that, the boards compare well.  They both autoswitch, and
they both are RTG.  But in my opinion, the EGS is a better board than the
Picasso.  But the EGS Spectrum is also more expensive.


BUGS

        Already mentioned.  Mostly due to software.  The company is working
on an update of its libraries to let them function correctly under AmigaDOS
3.0.


VENDOR SUPPORT

        Although friendly with regards to my question, they seemed
unknowledgeable.  I asked what advantages are there to having 2 megs on the
board and they just did not know.  They did not know of specific AmigaDOS 3.0
problems, just that there were some.  The board packaging also shows an
AmigaDOS 3.0 A3000 Workbench screen with 256 color pictures, but the
representative I spoke with said that 3.0 is not fully supported.


WARRANTY

        Depends where you buy it.  30 days from my sales firm, 1 year from
the company.


CONCLUSIONS

        If you can afford the EGS Spectrum, then buy that board.  But if you
can't then the Picasso II will take you beyond AGA graphics to workstation
resolutions at a minimal price.  It performs fairly well, and updates of the
software are planned so that the bugs with AmigaDOS 3.0 will be resolved.  An
Amiga with a Picasso II outdoes any SVGA 80486's that I have ever seen.  It
outdoes an Amiga 4000 in graphics capabilities, and all the screens can use
the Picasso II board .  It is a very good, highly impressive product.  It is
a must to own one if you want to get out of the old age of Amiga display
capabilities and go forth to the higher, faster, more-color resolutions of
the future and today.


RATING SCALE

        GVP Spectrum:   9.5 out of 10
        Picasso II:     8.5 out of 10

COPY PROTECTION

        Excessive manual-word-lookup copy protection.  Every time you use
the book, you CONSTANTLY have to look up words and whole sentences in the
manual.  The word lookup scheme is ingenious:  while using the product, you
don't normally notice that you're looking up the phrases! ;-)

REVIEW


        After having bought "Das Amiga-Guru-Buch" several years ago by
the same author, I immediately went out and obtained the "Amiga Guru
Book" when I heard that Ralph Babel had finished it.

        The Amiga Guru Book is the successor to "Das Amiga-Guru-Buch" and
contains pretty much all of the original information (updated) and quite a
bit of new stuff.  Every chapter starts with a few quotes related to the
topic at hand.  For example, here is one of the quotes for the chapter "Legal
Alien:  AmigaDOS, the Englishman in the System":

        "BRAIN-DAMAGED. adjective.  Obviously wrong; extremely poorly
           designed; {cretinous}; {demented}.  There is an implication
           that the person responsible must have suffered brain damage,
           because he should have known better.  Calling something
           brain-damaged is really extreme. The word implies that the
           thing is completely unusable, and that its failure to work is
           due to poor design, not accident."

           -- Guy L. Steele Jr. et al., The Hacker's Dictionary

and another one for the chapter "Hooking in at Boot Time":

        "ColdCapture and CoolCapture vector operation will change because
        ExecBase can be in fast memory (the result of this is to raise the
        temperature of ColdCapture about 60 degrees)."

           -- Bryce Nesbitt, Compatibility Risks for 1.4 and Beyond

        The book can be used as a tutorial on programming the Amiga, but it
is also very useful as a reference manual.  The index looks like a VERY big
hash table. ;-)

        Throughout the book, you'll find quite a few assembly-language and
SAS/C listings to further the enlightment of the reader on a specific topic.
The code examples range from short fragments to complete working programs
(for example, the complete source code for a user shell). It would have been
a nice idea to offer a disk with all the sources to accompany the book; but
then again, the listings are meant to clarify certain subjects.  Therefore
this isn't a big problem.

        Among the many useful bits and pieces that you'll have a hard time
finding anywhere else are Amiga-specific information about the 68040;
compiler internals; system start-up procedures and different types of
reset-resident programs; CON custom-screen magic; user shells; FFS data
structures; and background information about BCPL, Tripos, and the Global
Vector.

        The chapters on dos.library and DOS packets cover these subjects
much more in depth than anything else I've seen so far. The Guru Book
clarifies several ommisions and errors of the AmigaDOS Manual in regard to
dos.library, autodocs, packets and FFS data structures.  Included also is
information about DOS data structures and the program/process start-up
environment.

        Here are the contents of the book:

          2 Programming Guidelines

        Appendices

         About Listings
         Glossary
         Bibliography
         Index


DOCUMENTATION

        The Guru Book's documentation is excellent.  It comes with a 31-page
index, so it's very easy to find a particular subject.  Obviously, the TeX
typesetting system was used in preparing the book and it really shows.
There's just one description of the quality:  excellent.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

        There are lots of fun quotes, sideblows (many more than in its
predecessor) and interesting footnotes.  Ralph Babel reused some of the best
quotes from "Das Amiga-Guru-Buch".

        The book cover is now fully Style-Guide-compliant and displays a
normal 2.x window border and guru.

        The book is neither Zorro I/II or III compatible, and it doesn't fit
into the video slot nor the 3.5" and 5.1/4" bays of any Amiga.

        The book's resolution cannot be duplicated by any normal graphics
adapter for the Amiga.  At 1270 dpi it has an approximate resolution of 8509
* 11430 pixel.  The display is rock steady and non-interlaced.  All this is
monochrome, though.

        It is not hard disk-installable.

        Making a backup copy for safety reasons is a LOT of work.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        It completely replaces the Bantam AmigaDOS manual (though it doesn't
include the bugs... therefore if you liked them, you'll have to fall back on
Bantam).

        It is more fun than the Amiga ROM Kernel and Hardware Reference
manuals and has a better form factor.


BUGS

        Immediately upon receiving the book I sprayed it with insecticide,
so I'm pretty sure that there are no bugs left... at least none alive.


VENDOR SUPPORT

        Ralph Babel can be found on several groups on USEnet, where he's
known and feared for his short/precise/crisp answers/flames.


WARRANTY

        There's a pretty impressive disclaimer in the book that disclaims
all shapes/colours.  I didn't read it completely though, as reading Lawyer
Talk always gives me headaches (although you can find a joke in anything, if
you look hard enough).


CONCLUSIONS

        The Amiga Guru Book ranges somewhere between a specialized book and
light literature.  It is excellently researched, pleases the eye, and
contains numerous hints, tips, tricks, and knowledge nowhere else to be
found.  It is a must for every serious (and especially for the not quite so
serious) Amiga programmer.

        Don't walk, RUN out to your nearest book store and buy it.  Better
buy three copies:  one to use as a mousepad, one to keep the door closed,
and one to put under your pillow. ;-)

From: Mike_Noreen@p14.anet.bbs.bad.se (Mike Noreen)
Subject: The Jaguar STILL isn't 64-bit, you know.
To: Rob-G@cup.portal.com


I just read AmigaReport v2.03, and was distressed to see that

 a) CD32's only real competitor, the Jaguar, gets mentioned more than the CD32
    IN AN AMIGA NEWSLETTER!, and 

 b) that the Jaguar is still falsely claimed to be 64-bit. It's got a *16-bit*
    CPU, with two *32-bit* custom chips, located on a *64-bit* bus!

In addition, one of the *32-bit* custom chips has some 64-bit registers. 
Big deal.  My 68882 maths coprocessor is 94-bit internally.  Does that make my 
A3000 a 94-bit system?  Not in anybody's book except Atari's.  I honestly don't 
understand how an Amiga newsletter can help spread such obvious hype - the Jaguar
was claimed to be 64-bit FIVE TIMES!  A tleast you didn't claim it to be a
RISC machine this time, at least that's something. What really ticked me off was 
the Atari Jaguar game list. Why did you include that into the newsletter?  I 
suppose one or several of you own Jaguars - but that's no reason to give it so 
much coverage.


                      ------------------------------


First of all, Mike, I cover the Jaguar in Amiga Report just as I would a PC
compatible -- it's a 'competitor' so it should get enough coverage so that
people know what's going on 'on the other side.'  You should always keep up
on your competitors.  Now, just because we're an Amiga magazine doesn't mean
we should ignore everybody else.  No way.  The idea here is to keep everybody
informed on matters besides the Amiga.  It's just like watching the news on
TV -- do you only care what happens here in the US, or do you like to know
what's going on in Europe and Asia?  I do.

Which leads me to the 64 vs. 16-bit issue.  The Jaguar IS a 64-bit machine,
and it IS in fact a RISC machine.  The MAIN CPU is a 64-bit RISC chip that was
developed to be a graphics-specific CPU.  This does not make it a coprocessor,
because the actual program code runs on the 64-bit chip.  The Jaguar also has
a 68000, which handles communication between the other custom chips, and the
CPU.

The CD32 is entitled to just as much coverage as the Jaguar, or any other
game system.  When I have material to print on it, I will do so.  Likewise,
I will print new info on the Jaguar as it becomes available.

For the record, no, I don't own a Jaguar.  Not yet anyway.  I have used one,
and I'm very impressed with it.  I've also used a CD32.  It's a nice machine,
but it's hard to be impressed with it since it's nothing more than a CD-ROM
machine with the guts of a 1200... the computer I've owned for over a year.

                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 · Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

 · The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software, online.

 · Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

 · Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES.

 · 35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

 · No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

 · Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

 · Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

 · Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

 · FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
 · Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  

 · Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

 · The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
 · Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
 · All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

 · Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

 · And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

%%                    BIX - Byte Information Exchange                    %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and en-
thusiasts.  While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is 
the place for knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  
You're likely to find many others in similar situations who can offer 
advice, give technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.

BIX is divided into areas called conferences, each devoted to a 
particular area of interest.  They range from algorithms to windows,
from writers to Amiga.  Conferences are categorized into groups,
usually referred to as exchanges, so that you can browse through
whatever groups interest you and see a list of the conferences it 
contains.

                  These are some of the exchanges on BIX:

amiga.exchange - the place for Amiga developers and enthusiasts
byte - the full text of each issue of BYTE magazine; source code too 
e.and.l - Entertainment and Leisure; music, pets, games, more
ibm.exchange - everything from OS/2 to PC clones
mac.exchange -  Mac news, support, software, advice
professionals - consultants, engineers, financiers gather here
programmers - some of the best brains in the business!
wix - the Information Exchange for Windows; Windows Magazine online
writers.ex - the professional and amateur writer's exchange


                       *** FULL INTERNET ACCESS! ***

BIX also features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription.

                         WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF GOD
                       HAD TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN?


                      Reprinted from STReport #10.04


  AND GOD SAID:

 "IN THE BEGINNING, GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH." He was then faced with
 a Notice of Violation and a class action lawsuit for failing to file a
 Part A notification and an environmental impact statement with HEPA
 (Heavenly Environmental Protection Agency), an angelically staffed agency
 dedicated to keeping the Universe pollution free.

 God was granted a temporary permit for the heavenly portion of the
 project, but was issued a "cease and desist" order on the earthly
 portion, pending further review by the HEPA.

 Upon completion of His construction permit application and environmental
 impact statement, God appeared before the Heavenly Environmental
 Protection Commission to answer unresolved questions regarding His
 application.

 When asked why He began these projects in the first place, God simply
 replied that He liked to be "creative." This was not considered adequate
 reasoning; and God was required to substantiate this further.

 HEPA was unable to see any practical use for earth, since "THE EARTH WAS
 VOID AND EMPTY, AND DARKNESS WAS UPON THE FACE OF THE DEEP." And God
 said, "LET THERE BE LIGHT." He really should never have brought up this
 point, since one Commission member was very active in the Sierrangel Club
 and immediately protested, stating "How was light to be made? Would it be
 a nuclear-powered or coal-fired generating plant? Would there be strip
 mining? What about thermal pollution? Air pollution? Universal warming?"
 God explained that the light would come from a huge ball of fire. No one
 on the Commission really understood this, but it was provisionally
 accepted assuming (1) there would be no smog or smoke resulting from the
 ball of fire, (2) a separate burning permit would be required, and (3)
 since continuous light would be a waste of energy, it should be dark at
 least one-half of the time. And so God agreed to "DIVIDE THE LIGHT FROM
 THE DARKNESS, AND HE CALLED THE LIGHT 'DAY', AND THE DARKNESS 'NIGHT'."
 (The Commission expressed no interest with in-house semantics.)

 When asked how the earth would be covered, God said "LET THERE BE
 FIRMAMENT MADE AMIDST THE WATERS, AND LET IT DIVIDE THE WATERS FROM THE
 WATERS." One ecologically radical Commission member accused Him of
 double-talk, but the Commission tabled action since God would be required
 first to apply for a "firmament" permit from the ABLM (Angelic Bureau of
 Land Management), would be required to obtain water permits from the
 appropriate agencies involved, and further, insure that construction of
 any firmament would result in no net loss of wetlands.

 The Commission asked if there would be only water and firmament, and God
 said "LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH THE GREEN HERB, AND SUCH AS MAY SEED, AND
 THE FRUIT TREE YIELDING FRUIT AFTER ITS KIND, WHICH MAY HAVE SEEN ITSELF
 UPON THE EARTH." The Commission agreed to this, as long as only native
 seeds were to be used.

 About future developments, God also said "LET THE WATERS BRING FORTH THE
 CREEPING CREATURE HAVING LIFE, AND THE FOWL THAT MAY FLY OVER THE EARTH
 UNDER THE FIRMAMENT OF HEAVEN." Here again, the Commission took no formal
 action, since this would require approval of the Game and Fish
 Commission, coordinated with the Heavenly Wildlife Federation and the
 Audubongelic Society.

 It appeared that everything was in order until God said that He wanted to
 complete the project in six days. At this time He was advised by the
 Commission that His timing was completely out of the question. HEPA would
 require a minimum of six to nine months to review the permit application
 and environmental impact statement, and then there would have to be a
 45-day public comment period followed by public hearings. After any and
 all public comments were considered, it could feasibly take 12 to 18
 months before a permit could be issued.

 And God said, "THE HELL WITH IT!"
