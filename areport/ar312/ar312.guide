I've been learning a lot of things in the last few weeks.

One is that it was pretty nice not rushing to make an exact 2-week deadline
for this issue...it was some much-needed rest.  Still, I feel like I've
been just as busy...

So busy, in fact, that I wasn't able to actually finish any reviews for
this issue.  Strike that up as a learning experience, too.  I suppose that
just means I'll have to have twice as many next issue.

I've been learning lately that perhaps I should do like everyone else does
and CHARGE MONEY for all these "open letters" I keep getting.  You have to
admit, there does seem to be a market for them. :)

I've learned that maybe there is some name value in Amiga Report after all.
I've been invited to speak at AmiJAM'95 in Calgary, in the company of such
giants as Dale Larson, Dave Haynie, and Fred Fish.  So, if you're bored in
mid July, come see us.  We'll be there.

I've also learned, literally just an hour before I wrote this, from an
unconfirmed report credited to Dan Stets of the Philadelphia Inquirer that
Amiga Technologies will be manufacturing 4000Ts in the US and 1200s in
Scotland.

I've learned that there's some irony in hype.  I just got a press pack from
Team17, with their new slogan "100% Gameplay, 0% Bullshit."  The
information is in a nice red folder with glossy type-much snazzier than
anything I've ever received before from Team17.  The material talks about
an upcoming soccer management game.  In the two glossy release sheets,
though, only the Mac and Windows are discussed.  In the photocopied press
release, only the Mac and Windows are discussed.  The only place they admit
to having created an Amiga version is on the second page of their faq on
the product, another included insert.

I don't know what the fellows at Team17 call this, but I call it bullshit.
I honestly can't tell if they really did an Amiga version or not, and their
press people haven't been nice enough to return my inquiry.

Sigh.  Next issue, more reviews, I promise.  In the meantime, enjoy the new
logo courtesy of Corinna Cohn, the Escom press conference transcripts, and
all that news the assistant editor was nice enough to package for you...

The co-sysop on my BBS had big problems with A&M Computer repair.  He
wanted me to email this to you so you could put in the AR and warn
everyone about this company.

subj: AR letter to jcompton@shell.portal.com
from: Chris Foster
on  : Sun 21-May-1995  1:52p

 Dear Jason,
 
 I am writing you and your staff to tell you what a great job you do
informing the Amiga community about news and new products for the Amiga.  
You have continued to do a great job and I will continue to read your
magazine (Who could ask for a better magazine for the price.) :)

 The other reason I am writing you is the concern I have with a company in
which I feel needs the attention of the Amiga community.  In February of
this year, I sent my Commodore 1960 multiscan monitor to be repaired to A&M
Computer Repair Service.  Before I sent it I called their office and spoke
with someone and told him what problems I was having with the monitor.  The
computer screen had collapsed into a single vertical band down the center
and was emitting a high pitched whining noise.  He told me to send the
monitor with $85.00 + $12.00 shipping (money order).  Another person in
their office told me that someone would call me as soon as they received
the monitor.  I allowed 6-7 working days for UPS to deliver it to them.
Approximately 10-14 days later, I called A&M back to see if they received
my monitor and money order.  I spoke with another person and she said that
they received the monitor the day before, but that there was not a money
order enclosed with the monitor.  She then told me that it would cost
$168.95 to have it repaired.  Obviously, whoever received the package just
took out the packing material and threw it in the trash without checking
the contents of the box.  I then had to spend $5.00 to get a refund on my
money order and wait 3 weeks for it to be mailed back to me.  I called A&M
back and told them to repair my monitor and send it back to me C.O.D.  When
I received my monitor back, there was only a shipping label attached and
when I opened the box, there was not a copy of my invoice or any type of
packing slip.  I hooked the monitor back up to my computer and noticed that
the PAL/NTSC screen modes weren't being displayed correctly.  On the far
right of the screen pixels were squeezed tightly together and pixels in the
center of the screen appeared enlarged.  All other video modes were normal.
I also noticed that the case on the front of the monitor had been scratched
as though someone had set it face down on a workbench and dragged or slid
across a rough surface.  I immediately called A&M back and told them what
the monitor was doing and that I hadn't received a copy of the invoice.  He
told me to send it back and they would fix it and there wouldn't be any
charge for the repair, and that someone would call me when they received
the monitor.  Well, sending the monitor costs approximately $15 (insured)
and I was not able to send it for another week or so.  I did not use the
monitor except to only demonstrate what the PAL/NTSC modes were doing when
the picture suddenly collapsed into a single vertical bar and emitted the
high pitched whining noise (what I had sent it to them for in the first
place.) I packed my monitor back up and shipped it back to A&M and waited
two weeks before I finally had to call them again and ask if they had
received my monitor and given any diagnosis.  I called numerous times
wanting to speak to the owner and each time I was told to leave my name and
number and he would get back with me.  I never once was called by anyone at
A&M Repair Service in regards to this matter.  I had to initiate all
communications with them.  I finally got to talk to the owner and he said
that he would look at the monitor and call me back.  Still no call back to
me.  I called repeatedly and asked to speak to the owner (who I later found
out was also the technician that was doing the repair work) and was told
that he wasn't in.  I was informed that a circuit board on the monitor had
a hole burned into it and that there was nothing they could/would do about
it.  I asked to be refunded and they refused to refund any money due to
terms that they did not authorize me to have any repair work done on it
other than by them.  I simply stated in a letter I sent with the monitor
the second time that I had a friend/technician LOOK at the monitor, and
they are taking that to mean that I had work done to it.  I did not take it
to a repair shop, I had a friend (who is also a technician) come look at
it, not disassemble it, when it blew out on me the second time.  He said
that he couldn't work on it because he couldn't get parts for the monitor
since the Amiga market is in the position that it is in right now.

 I am still trying to get a refund of $168.95 that I paid to have it
repaired.  I spoke with someone at A&M Repair Service but they refuse to
refund my money.  I have since then received my monitor back with just a
note written in pencil on the back of the case that says "burnt hole in
board".  Well, I took the cover off of the monitor just to look around and
see where this hole was and if I could maybe get it repaired somehow.  The
hole is about 1/4" in diameter and the component that used to be there is
missing.  I also noticed that the RF shield was missing.  After some
studying of the circuit board I started to just put the whole thing back
together when I noticed that there were some spare parts from somebody
elses monitor floating around inside my monitor.  The rubber feet that are
on the bottom of monitors and screws that also attach the bottom cover of
the monitor were loose, rattling around my monitor.  I believe that this
could've caused the monitor to have shorted out and caused the arcing that
burnt the hole in the circuit board.

 I feel I have no choice but to bring this matter to the public eye and let
you come to your own conclusion.  I feel that I've been ripped off royally
and believe that I deserve my money back since they did not fix my
monitor.I have gotten absolutely nowhere with this company.  It is really
sad to pay $170 dollars for repair service and end up with a dead monitor.

 You may edit/revise this letter as you wish, but please post it for me and
for others who may have defective Amiga equipment so that they won't make
the same mistake I did.  This is a warning to fellow Amigans to get a
reliable company to work on their computer equipment.  Thank you.

Dear Jason,

I have read a lot of UseNet posts recently concerning the whereabouts of
Stefan Boberg, the author of the LHA archiver.  Apparently several people
(close to 10 by my count) have sent in their registration fees, but they
never received the registered version of LHA or any word back from him. 
Several others, myself included, have wanted to send in for the registered
version, but the address listed in the documentation is four years old and
half way across the planet.  I know I'm not about to send out money till I
confirm the address - especially in light of the recent messages I've
read.

My question to you is: Do you know the whereabouts of Stefan Boberg or at
least his current address?  One of the posts said they heard Stefan has
recently joined the programming group "Team 17".  All EMail messages to
them though have gone unanswered.

If you don't know his whereabouts, would you at least consider including
this letter in the next issue of AR so he or someone else who knows his
whereabouts might read it?

HEY STEFAN, PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SEND YOU MONEY!!!  THE LEAST YOU COULD DO
IS MAKE IT EASY FOR THEM!!!

-   Anyone?

Subject: ...PANTS? (letter to editor)

Jason-

After reading the latest word from Escom, I'm inclined to think of the
episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000* in which Joel gave all of the
'bots neat presents.  Tom got a hot-rod go-cart, Gypsy got a bath playset,
and Crow got ...  PANTS.

Well, that's what U.S.  Amiga users got handed this week.  Pants.  In other
words, all of the good news was just that -- if you happened to live in
Europe.  Or be one of the 10000 people in the US or Canada who can afford
one of the 10000 A4000T's Escom is so /GENEROUSLY/ sending across the sea.

So here we sit.  European Amiga users get the neat toys and we get...  
nothing.  Not a damn thing.  Ten thousand A4000t's are an excuse for Escom
to say "Look.  Amigas don't sell worth a damn in North America.   Let's not
even think about that market any more." Why?  Who in the hell will be able
(willing) to pay for an A4000T?  NewTek?  Not hardly.  They jumped ship a
month ago.  Die-hard Amiga users?  OK.  There's 10000.   That's not even
the beginning of a thought of an idea about doing something that might
create an indication of a ripple in the computer market here.

This isn't an "It's not made here Alex should have won" rant...lots of
great things come out of Europe.  But how "fair" is it to NA Amiga users to
be completely ignored by Escom?  It isn't.  And I guess now that NA stands
for "Not Applicable" now.

And set-top boxes, you say?  Great.  We got a shirt with our pants.

*ObAmiga: They use(d?) Video Toasters extensively in the "BestBrains" labs.

Anyone who leaves the platform, at least here, can't be accused of 
"abandoning" the Amiga.  It's abandoned us.

Sadly,

    Bill Silvey (wsilvey@oo.com)

                            --- --- --- --- ---

I was reading AR 3.09 today (I don't have a modem etc., but friends
generally send me AR) and I thought I'd just add a coupla things to the
letter about UK Amiga mags:-

1.  Amiga Pro had gone to the wall
2.  The best mag of all wasn't included-namely, JAM (Just Amiga Monthly),
    probably because it's a subscription-only magazine not a fancy glossy
    job!

Glad Escom are gonna restart production of A600s (assuming of course that
they actually do what they say they're gonna do...) it really is an
underrated little machine-graphically disadvantaged though it may be :-( -
it's a great "first-timer's" computer.  If I'd had to start out on an
A1200, never having touched a computer before, I'd have been put right
off, instead of hooked for life. ;-)

Anyway, thanx to you and AR for keeping the Amiga community in touch with
what's been happening over the past rather traumatic year or so.

          A Very Worried Look - ESCOM Saves Finnish Amiga Market?
  Jukka Kauppinen                                  jkauppin@muikku.jmp.fi
===========================================================================

For years, Finland has been a neglected market area for C= products. 
Since the official, big and good THOUGH expensive, C= representative
PCI-Data backrupted (because gray imports), Finnish C= Spokesmans have
been many in their numbers, and ALWAYS very ignorant what they represent
and attempt to sell.

After PCI-Data we had A Commodore Finland, for very short time.  After
their demise Finland was given to Toptronics, who were very unsuccessful
and, as can be doubted, unwilling to promote the Amiga in any way.  During
Toptronics "good times" a company called "Man & Man" also was promoted to
official C= Importer status, and while they had the will, they lacked the
financial muscle to do what they wanted.  Even worse, the MORE official C=
representative Toptronics prevented every effort by other companies to
advertise the Amiga, because "the other companies would make money with
the reputation TOPTRONICS (HAH!) built for Amiga-name".

Sometime 1991-1992 even they were dropped out of C= representative
position, and a ghostly kind of C= office was opened in Finland.  Office,
really, since it consisted of ONE man, who first though Amiga is a IBM
PC-clone brand.  TRUE!  He was very ignorant, and never really knew
anything about the Amiga.  Some Finnish Amiga dealers even demoed the
machine to him to show what Amiga is about and what it can do.  He never
learned though.

Very much credit can be given to this man of Amiga's fast demise in
Finland.  He was very successfull in giving hard time to all Finnish Amiga
dealers - aal machines HAD to be ordered trough him, and he couln't deliver
them, other than very late and just fraction of machines ordered.

He had no knowledge, no technical specs, no information of anything at all.
He could not support the dealers, couln't advertise at all, or give C=
backing on Amiga advertising campaigns in Finland.  The only Amiga AD
campaign we've had in the '90s was 1993, when Man & Man SOMEHOW got a 50%
C= backing, and decided then to double their own part so the campaign was
150% of the original size.  They managed to sell more Amigas in the worst
time of year than in any previous year's BEST time.  But it wasn't that
long campaign, and the financial support never came back.

All Amiga dealers and most users with knowledge of the "inner happening"
in Finnish Amiga market are, as far as I know, in same opinion that THIS
ONE MAN has been mostly responsible with Amiga's problems in Finland.

So when C= busted, this guy went over, and started to sell cars and
furnitures.  Great.  He's gone.  What next?

Year passed.  We got ESCOM.  ESCOM makes press release for Finnish mags,
and it looks good.  Wow!  They have Scandinavian HQ, and an office in
Finland.  Hey, it's 1990 when we've had DIRECT contact, a real office, of
our Amiga-manufacturer's.  Maybe we finally get some decent support, tech
knowledge etc?  Maybe NOW our dealers get help when they need to...

Or so I thought...

The POINT IS, that ESCOM'S COUNTRY MANAGER (FINLAND) is the SAME MAN that
has ruined Amiga-market in Finland during whole '90s!

SAME MAN!  Again, we have Eero Walden, as the head of Finnish Amiga-market.
The future doesn't look that bright after all.  Say your prayers.  Finland
is lost, forever.

             A Portrait Of An Amiga User In Jakarta-Indonesia
  Edwin Nugroho                                   nunu@server.indo.net.id
===========================================================================

(first of all, sorry about my english)

I am a recent computer engineering graduate.

I am working at my campus's electronic & computer labs, and my campus's
video labs.

I am also a fanatic amiga user who lives in jakarta indonesia.

I am amazed by amiga video and multitasking capability.

I think amiga OS is very powerful and efficient.

In my city 80 percent of amigas are used for video work.  there are 6 - 8
video production alone in my city although here in jakarta, we don't have
any dealers.  Because we don't have any dealers, we got to order it
directly from UK, USA or Singapore, and the price will go up to 1.5 - 3
times than the normal prices.

I always encourage people that use computer for video work
 to use the amiga.

I even encourage my lab at my campus to use the amiga.  (curently my
campus's video labs using amiga 500 & amiga 4000/040 for your information
my campuss had to pay US$4000 for amiga 4000 alone, without monitor)

Here in Jakarta, amiga are nameless computer.  Recently, at computer expo
in Jakarta, local apple dealer show to the big screen projector, 'Change
Myself' music video from Todd Rundgren (I know it was created using AMIGA)
people visit to their stand will think it produced using Apple Computer,

So you see, I work very hard to promote amiga,

To support amiga here in jakarta, with several of other fanatic amiga
user, we even create our own memory boards, sampler boards ( at the moment
only for A500), repairing the amiga (without support from anywhere), help
to install the 3,5" HD to AMiga 1200, created our own external disk drive
using cheap IBM drive and others activity.

The 7 - 14 video production (in 3 city in Indonesia) that use amigas,
depend on us.

We even think in the near future we want to become an amiga dealer.  (for
video work amigas are still popular, but because it is hard to find
especially in indonesia, then people buy IBM or Apple instead)

So I hope Escom will make amiga's future brighter than before.

My system consist of: Amiga 1200-030/882 50 mhz 10 MB ram,
                      Amiga 2000-EC030/882 40/66 mhz 9 mb ram
                      2 Amiga 500 2 mb ram & 1 mb ram  
                      (i change the oscilator for my A2000)
                      GVP-Glock & Minigen PAL Version

  Alejandro Kurczyn                        akurczyn@itesmvf1.rzs.itesm.mx
===========================================================================

Finally, the wait is over, and there's light at the end of the tunnel, the
Amiga has a new owner, and a new life.  In the past days I've read a
zillion letters about this, most of them with concern about the future,
many more with suggestions and requests for ESCOM, and more in between.
But a question keeps poping in my mind: What can we, the regular Amiga
users and fans, do to keep our beloved companion alive?  And as I ponder
that question, I sense an idea lurking on my head:

                      This is a second chance

Yes my friends, this is a second chance, and no other PC had one in the
past.  It's time for us to appreciate our good luck, to behave ourselves
and keep our friend alive, to have it in all her glory, show the world her
power and have many more fun along the way.

How?  That's the easy part, just do the right thing.  Let's cut that
piracy crap, show the makers of software that we too can handle their
programs.  Some of you are saying "yeah, right" and I can understand you,
software is pricey most of the time, even on our cheap plataform, but if
money is not enough, there's the PD scene, you can live with it and
believe me, you can live well.  It's cool to say "Lemmings Tribes was
available in the US before official distribution", but what did you
obtained from that apart from a few hours of fun?  Remember Sierra, Lucas,
SAS, and some other makers.  It's not only their programs and proffits,
those are guys who can attract more developers, and put the money on big
development projects and better programs.

Support our programmers, and the people who dedicate some hours and days
of their lives to us, like magazine editor's ( :-) ), PD organizers, and
the like.  After all, without them the "dark ages" may were really dark. 
Remember that each and every dollar/pund/peso/whatever you invest goes
directly to your computer, and I mean the one you're using to read this
right there on your desk.

I hope you get the main idea of this letter as english is not my main
language, but remembering a foreign president words: Ask not what the Amiga
can do for you, but what you can do for the Amiga.  I think it (and we)
deserve it, besides, nothing but good times will follow for all of us if we
do that.

PHOTOGENICS 1.2 UPDATE

Almathera is releasing on 15th May its new update of Photogenics.  
Photogenics 1.2 contains important new features which have been developed
with the end-user's wishes in mind.  We improved and added tools, options
for paintmodes and better support for different file formats.  The update
from ealier versions to 1.2 is only available from Almathera.

Photogenics 1.2 list of new features:

Warper tool added:
The easy-to-use warper tool allows you to distort, stretch, bend and twirl
parts of your image.

Printing added:
One of the most frequent requests from end-users was to be able to print -
Photogenics can now print to any preferences supported printer.  
Photogenics also supports the STUDIO II colour management system (not
included) for true 24-bit colour quality printouts.

CyBERgraphics 24-bit painting:
Photogenics can now paint in hi-colour (15/16 bit) and true colour
(24-bit) directly with any graphics card that supports the CyBERgraphics
standard (eg.  CyBERvision 64, Picasso II, Retina Z3, etc..).  Requires
CyBERgraphics drivers (not included)

Transparency Gradients added:
You can now apply various transparency gradients to rectangles, circles or
other shapes you draw and give the direction of your transparency.

Crop option added:
You can now crop an image to remove unwanted borders etc...

We added also for the end-user with non-AGA machines the 
Ham6.gio/ShowHam6.gio and the 16 Colour preview.  Photogenics can now save
and display standard Ham (or Ham-6)images as well as being run in a 16
colour preview.

Some improvement has been made to the Previews (Photogenics uses high 
quality dithering to get near 24-bit quality from a 256-colour display)
and the Compose mode (You can use other paintmodes inside compose to
combine the two images in many different ways).  You will also find new
Paintmodes (colourise, gamma, mirage, jitter etc...), NewIcon support, New
.GIOs (TIFF, PCX, HAM6, RETINA, ProGrab24, etc...) and many other
improvements.

Photogenics1.2 is better, bigger and heavier with a 150 pages manual.  It
retails at £59.95 and the upgrade from 1.1a to 1.2 costs only £15.00.  You
can purchase Photogenics 1.2 direct from Almathera, Southerton House,

    Aminet CD 6


AUTHOR

    Urban D. Mueller  (umueller@wuarchive.wustl.edu)


CONTENTS

Aminet CD 6 contains over 1 gigabyte of freely distributable software. 
The newest file included is dated Apr 28th.  The space is used as follows
(uncompressed sizes):

      520M of software newer than Aminet CD 5
      500M of demos
       20M of top downloads

    These consist of:
      1800 demos
      1300 tools
       350 mods
       140 pics
       120 games

The demos were collected from various sources besides Aminet, and almost
none of them have appeared on previous Aminet CDs.

The disks also contains all Amiga Report magazines issued so far.


ACCESS SOFTWARE

Amigaguide based user interface, allows easy unpacking and viewing using a
single mouse click.

Extensive search facilities.  Finds words in descriptions or readmes, and
outputs matches as an index that allows direct viewing.

New access features for the following categories of files:

- Demos: All demos have been tested.  Separate lists of best, good and
compatible demos.  All demos startable from those indices.  Another demo
index is the Amiga Demo List with extensive info about almost all demos on
the CD.  It is sorted by demo group.  Finally there is a program called
BootTool that allows you to view demos right after a reboot without much
fuss, so you can quickly look at the demos that force you to reboot.

- Mods: All of the modules are listed in indices sorted by music style and
rating.  There's also an index sorted by module author and the possibility
to randomly play music of a certain style.

- Docs: All Amiga Report electronic magazines that have appeared so far
are on this CD, including a utility that allows you to search for any text
in any AR article very quickly.

- Personal: Aminet CD 6 allows you to easily create an index of your
favourite files on the CD.

- German: All the files (except demos) on Aminet CD 6 have a German
description.  Also included is an index of the SaarAG disks up to 840.

Other improvements are the possibility to use file requesters to set
extraction and tool paths, and 'Clones' which are little programs that,
when started, unpack and run/view a file from the Aminet CD.

Some of you (many, I hope) might have seen the first issue of Amiga Report
Tech Journal some time back.  Possibly you've wondered what happened to
that.  ARTech's former editor, Greg Block, moved his development to
NeXTSTEP, and I took the magazine over from him.  However, there is a
problem, and that being a lack of articles.  ARTech needs you.  I want to
make ARTech a magazine that will always have some useful technique notes
and interesting features for anyone interested in Amiga.  This doesn't
just mean programming, as you might have thought from the first issue.
Amiga is that, but Amiga is also multimedia, rendering, and whatever you
do with your machine.

If you're an expert in some computing field, program Amiga, create cool
art with Amiga, or just do something interesting with it, and would like
to tell others about it, contact me.  ARTech will welcome anything from
LightWave animation technique notes to ARexx programming hints to a

DESCRIPTION

     CyBERgraphics supports:  Picasso II
                              Spectrum
                              Piccolo
                              Domino
                              Retina Z3 BLT
                              Piccolo SD64 

The cybergraphics system was designed to define an independant graphics
standard for graphics boards.  We also wanted to continue our development
of workbench emulations.  We could include all our knowledge of about 3
years of gfx board software development (wb-emulation of visiona, domino,
picasso and now the cybervision64).

Cybergraphics is based on hardware dependant monitor drivers and hardware
independant libraries.  This has some advantages: Bug fixes in the
workbench emulation or speed optimizations is of benefit for ALL gfx
boards that are supported by the cybergraphics system.  There is no third
like XpERT or Village-Tronic inbetween developers and users.  That
guarantees bug fixes and continued development of the software in the
future.  cybergraphics allows using of 15/16/24 screens independant of the
used color model.  You are able to use the cybergraphics.library functions
to modify this screens.  Using graphics.library functions is currently not
possible but this may change in one of the next releases.

Cybergraphics will also be the standard workbench emulation for the soon
coming (April 95) Cybervision64 by Advanced Systems&Software.  (of course
including drivers for diverse graphics programs, screen promoters and much
more).

Right now (6.4.95) there are drivers for Maxon Cinema,Real 3D, ADPro,
AmaxIV, PhotoWorx, Emplant, ImageFX and Photogenics available.  There is
also a picture viewer called CyberView which can be found on AmiNet.

     Revision V40.49 (changes since 40.47)
     -------------------------------------

     - changed the way ReadPixel() works on non clut screens.
       MatchPenColour now scans palette in reverse order in order
       to fix some problems.
     - CygnusED EOF marker is now shown correctly
     - pctask text modes now show up correctly under cybergraphics
       (inverse text before)
     - fixed jam2 line pattern bugs
     - fixed "pointer gets square" bug when screen was dragged down
       too far. Some machines even crashed ......

     (- added faster text output ) <- disabled in 40.49 (to be revised)

Scala to Deliver Software with New Amigas

Frankfurt, May 30, 1995 --- "We look forward to working closely with Scala
and to deliver Scala software with all Amiga computers," said Manfred
Schmitt, President of Escom AG, at a press conference in Frankfurt on
Tuesday, 30 May.

Escom AG has recently bought the assets of Commodore International and all
rights to the Commodore and Amiga technologies.  With its subsidiary, Amiga
Technologies GmbH, Escom will relaunch the Amiga computer in September this
year, first targeting the creative, video oriented, home and office
multimedia markets.

"Together the Scala software and the Amiga hardware technologies offer a
powerful and cost effective solution for anyone who needs a multimedia
package for home or office use.  Scala lets us promote ready-to-use
solutions, and not just computers," says Manfred Schmitt, CEO and President
of Escom AG, the parent company of Amiga Technologies.  "Escom now turns
from a PC manufacturer and retailer into a multimedia company.   We see
this as a key to continued success."

"The Amiga has shown the way and continues to do so, " comments Vice
President Jon Bohmer, Founder of Scala, the undisputed leader in multimedia
software for the Amiga platform.  "No other solution can match the price
performance of the Amiga - Scala combination.  We will support the Amiga
platform in the future and look forward to [a] close relationship with the
new Amiga Technologies company."

Adds Einar Haugstad, Vice President of Scala, "Even though the Amiga went
out of production a year ago, we have continued to see a constant demand
for Amigas, from both new and experienced users."

The new Amiga 4000T will come in a totally new casing, designed by Creative
Director Bjorn Rybakken of Bates Strategic Design in Oslo.   Rybakken has
long been a consultant for Scala and among other things, designed the Scala
[Exclamation] logo.

Escom was founded in Germany by Mannfred Schmitt in 1987 and has since
grown to become the second largest indigenous European PC manufacturer. 
(Source: Dataquest) The company provides low cost, high quality PC
products through its own European retail network as well as through direct
channels.  With a group turnover of 1.3 billion USD in 1994, Escom is one
of the leading players in the European PC marketplace.

Scala is in the business of Computer Television; using a computer to
produce and distribute television-type programming.  The company is on of
the world's leading developers of computer-based television information
solutions.  Available in eleven languages, Scala's multimedia tools are
distributed in more than 40 countries.  Scala was founded in Norway in
1987.  Today Scala is headquarted outside of Washington, DC, with
international headquarters in Oslo and offices in the United Kingdom, the
Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden.  Scala's team of software engineers
includes most of the people who originally developed the Amiga operating
system for Commodore.

Scala's main products are Scala MultiMedia, a software package for
production and playback of multimedia presentations, interactive training
applications, infotainment and video titling.  Scala InfoChannel is for
multimedia networking and information distributions.  Scala Interactive
Television, includes software for the production of Interactive Television
content as well as an operating environment for satellite and cable TV
decoders.

              However, at the free tables you get less space than the pay
              tables, it is first-come first-serve, and you cannot sell
              products at the tables!  That is strictly for the rented
              tables.

ACCESABILITY:  The show is easily accesable by bus and train, as well as

                          wares to a crowd of Amiga owners, all of whom
                          have money to spend and are influenced by how big
                          a prescence you have at the show.

WHY PEOPLE SHOULD COME:   AC'95 will have stands from many major dealers
                          and developers.  It will also have a lot of
                          friendly Amiga owners there, plus a booming sound
                          system and TV setup that will show crazy demos
                          and products.  It will be a wild good time for
                          all!

  ShapeShifter

VERSION

  2.0

AUTHOR

  SMail: Christian Bauer, Langenaustr.65, 56070 Koblenz, Germany

DESCRIPTION

  ShapeShifter is a multitasking shareware Macintosh-II emulator for
  the Commodore Amiga computer. It allows to run Macintosh software
  concurrently to Amiga applications without hardware add-ons or
  modifications.

  Some of the emulation's features:

   - Color display up to 256 colors on AGA Amigas (16 colors on ECS)
     and up to 16,7 million colors on graphics cards (Picasso-II,
     EGS and CyBERgraphics cards are supported)
   - No MMU required, even runs on A1200
   - Macintosh hard disks can be simulated in Amiga files or Amiga
     hard disk partitions
     [unregistered version has no hard disk partition support]
   - Can use Amiga floppy drives, serial, parallel and SCSI ports
     from the Mac
     [use of SCSI not possible in unregistered version]
   - Mac HD disks can be read directly with an HD floppy drive,
     Mac 800K disks cannot be read, Mac 720K disks, however, can
   - Multichannel sound output and parallel-port sound digitizers
     supported
   - Text clipboard sharing between Mac and Amiga
   - File handler to access Macintosh volumes from the Workbench
   - Speed comparable to a real Mac with equivalent hardware

  Changes in V2.0:

   - Pre-emptive multitasking
   - Quickstart now works reliably
   - Bug in stack handling corrected
   - Graphics cards in 24 bit address space work with ROM 34
   - CyBERgraphics 15 and 24 bit modes now work, selecting a
     CyBERgraphics mode will automatically set the color depth
   - Needs no special ROM sub versions any more
   - Setting for task priority removed
   - Macintosh reset routine revamped
   - Italian catalog files
   - When the selected amount of Mac memory is not available, you
     can choose to use the largest free block
   - Numerous internal corrections and improvements
   - SCSI IDs individually switchable, an error when accessing
     ID 0 will no longer cause the other IDs to be skipped
   - The graphics refresh is now done by a subtask, enabling the
     Amiga mouse pointer will prevent any refreshes
   - ROM write-protection is now choosable
   - The FileDisk driver will no longer open files with empty
     names

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  OS2.1, 68020 processor, 4MB of RAM, HD floppy drive recommended.
  A copy of a Macintosh 512K or 1MB ROM and the Macintosh system

==========================================================================
              CREATING COOL TEXT EFFECTS: A GRAPHICS TUTORIAL
  Corinna Cohn                                           gemini@indy.net
==========================================================================

[For reference, the end result of this tutorial, AmigaReportTutorial.JPG,
has been included in the magazine.  -Jason]

    Let's face it, text is important.  In order to catch attention, you
need to have cool, interesting, and innovative text to catch the eye of
the observer.  I'm going to go step by step to show how I did the effect
for the improv Amiga Report logo I did.

    STEP {1} - Creating the initial text.

For the first step, I needed a program that could load a large number of
fonts, and hopefully do other nice and interesting effects.  As I own
ArtExpression, I had to settle for something that could load PostScript
fonts.  Since Amiga Report is a news zine, I decided to pick an
appropriate styletype.  Having wild, exciting, bizarre, or groovy text was
out for this particluar purpose, as I can only assume that something
called Amiga Report has at least a moderately serious edge to it.

I chose Times-Roman because this is a typeface that is commonly associated
with newspapers.  I also sketched in a cute little checkmark to go with
the text effect...  maybe I'll use it, maybe I wont.

I save the work as a PostScript file.  I could have saved the work as a
standard IFF file, however that causes the file to be saved as a specified
resolution.  On the other hand, saving as an IFF means that you can load
the file into nearly any program.


    Step {2} - Transfering the File

This stage involved importing the text into a more capable program,
(essentially, anything that does not say ArtExpression on the box), and
for this I used ImageFX 2.1.  Since IFX2.1 has a PostScript import module,
(using the hgpost datatype), and I decided to have the resolution as a
425x550, and cropped it to 425x253.  The resolution is a little bit low,
but for what I'm doing, it will work just fine.

    Step {3} - The Real Job

         {A} - The Background

This is where a dab of artistic flair comes in handy.  Fortunately a dab
is all that is required, for that is all I posses!  Now, I conceptualize
what this will look like.  Will it be modern?  Classic?  New Age?  I think
that I will start with it having a modern background, and then afterwards,
work on the text.  I swap buffers, and then select "Create New Buffer" and
size it to swap (If you remember, since we swapped the buffers, the one we
were working on now becomes the "swap").  Going to the palette, I create a
range of greys, (for that modern look).  After trying out a couple of
experimental fills, I decide to go with a nice wheel filled from the
middle of the screen.

         {B} - The Checkmark

First, I swapped buffers again to bring me back to the first screen, and I
decided to do something about that checkmark.  This was simple.  I loaded
a rainbow texture that I had laying around, (I think I grabbed it off of
someone's home page), so I loaded it as a brush, and then did a brush fill
on the checkmark.  I then cut out the brush, and then removed the spot
where the checkmark, as I did not want it to be there permanently.

         {C} - The Alpha Channel

Black text on a white background faced me.  The words "Amiga" and "Report"
sat atop one another, the "G" in Amiga fitting in the depression in
"Report".  Nice.  Now I do any special effects to the shape of the text. 
Since I don't want anything particularly fancy for this, I simply add a
small amount of anti-aliasing.  If you want to get crazy, try the dream
effect first.  Groovy, man.  I then copied the screen to the Alpha
channel.  This will become my texture later in the process.

         {D} - Of Alphas, Swaps, and Textures

I decide that I want a shadow effect, so I roll my current buffer by about
5 pixels.  Now I swap buffers again to bring me back to the wheel fill.
Setting the fill options to normal/rub through/use alpha as friskit, I
used a filled box to select the whole screen.  This causes the box to rub
through the entire screen except what was protected by the alpha channel.
The Text is filled by what is left of the wheel-filled screen, and the
text now has a shadow beneeth it.

         {E} - The Checkmark Reviseted

I throw the checkmark back in.  Easy.  Just make sure all of the drawing
modes are reset to their defaults.

Excuse me?  How did I stick it behind the text?  Well, I'm glad you asked,
because otherwise I wouldn't have answered.  I created a range of colors
from black to almost pure white.  Emphasis on almost.  I then chose to
exclude that range from receiving colour wiht my draw options.  Easy as
cake.

    Step {4} - Touch Up Work

Well, everything turned out pretty good, but I wanted to fine tune things
a little bit.  First of all, sticking in the checkmark messed up some of
my lettering.  I repaired that using the pantograph draw option.  I toned
the white down to 235/235/235rgb I scaled it down to 380x200.  I ran
Unsharpen Mask to bring out the edges a little better.

    Step {5} - Saving Your Work

This is a very important step.  The format that you save your work in
usually depends on a variety of things.  How much space does your work
need to fit in?  I don't have a lot of space on my hard drive, therefore,
I usually use JPEG.  If you are using this for a WWW page, you probably
want to save it in GIF.  If I had the space for it, I would save my work
as IFF24.

    Step {6} - The End

Now you criticize your work and lament about how bad it turned out.  At
least, that's what I do.  :)

==========================================================================
                          BLAZEMONGER GOES PRINT
  Dan Barrett                                 barrett@astro.cs.umass.edu
==========================================================================

    OK, OK, enough already!!  Stop bombarding us with email messages, you
rancid PANDA-BAITERS.  You want the truth?  OK, you got it!

    Apparently, many people are wondering where BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED
has been during all of this Commodore bankruptcy/negotiation business.  As
various computer giants took their turns wrestling over Commodore's ashes,
where have the creators of BLAZEMONGER, the ULTIMATE computer game, been
hiding?  And why??

	Heh heh heheheh.

    Well, for a while, we watched from the sidelines.  Then, when
Commodore UK and CEI finally got into the act, BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED
was right there, behind the scenes, helping out with the negotiations. 
Personally, we couldn't BELIEVE how long all those DWEEB LAWYERS went ON
and ON.  In fact, if it hadn't been for the timely action of our "Customer
Service" department, those negotiations might STILL be in limbo.  Special
thanks go to "Vinnie" for his ingeniously creative and helpful use of
razor wire and olive oil.  Ooooooeee, that smarts.

    Now that Escom has won the battle, we've been involved in SECRET,
INTENSE PLANNING SESSIONS with them to decide the future of the Amiga. 
68060 CPU?  AGA graphics?  Built-in neutron BOMB?  These are all extremely
WIMP-OLA ideas.  The final results, when the new Amigas hit the market,
will be FAR BEYOND this unimaginative TRASH.  Expect to see Cray CPU's,
live AQUARIUMS, and LASER DEATH RAY CANNONS built into even the low-end
models!!

    Ah, but that is not all.  Escom has been only a side interest for our
company.  You see, we've also been working on a TOP SECRET project.  It's
new.  It's FAST.  And it's VIOLENT.  VERY VIOLENT.  The kind of QUALITY
you'd EXPECT from the AWESOME creators of "the first computer game with
its own Richter Scale rating" [Computer Gaming Monthly].

    "But," you ask, in a kindly, innocent voice, the sort that a cute baby
lamb might have in a hushed meadow at twinkling twilight, "what in the
world could Blazemonger Incorporated be working on if they have already
created the 'ultimate' computer game?"

    [The next paragraph is a brief, polite summary for all of those nice
newcomers in the newsgroup.  Old-timers can skip ahead.]

    FIRST of all, SHEEP-FACE, it's "BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED" in ALL
CAPITAL LETTERS!!  If you don't SHOUT when you SAY IT, you SUCK when you
PLAY IT!!!!!  (TM) Get a LIFE, get a JOB, and GET A *GRIP*!!

    OK, now that that's overwith....  The answer, my friends, is that we
haven't been working on a new game.  Instead, we've been writing a book.

    "A book?"

    Yes, a BOOK.  One of those FLAT things with PAGES.  And it's all
about...  the life of Commodore!  How they began, how they rose to
grandeur, how they fell DOWN again, how they came back UP again, how they
slipped and FELL on a banana peel, how they climbed back up using only
their FINGERNAILS on a BARE ROCK CLIFF FACE, STRUGGLING for NEW LIFE,
GASPING, BLEEDING PROFUSELY from every ORIFICE...  only to find a pack of
ULTRA-VIOLENT JOURNALISTS sitting at the top, writing lies about them.
That's where we come in.

    Thanks to the EXPERT crew in our "Publications and Supplications"
department, we have chronicled the rise and fall (and subsequent rebirth)
of Commodore in PERFECT PROSE, GLEAMING GRAPHICS, and unequalled STYLE AND
WIT.  GRRRAAARRRRGH!!!!

    One of the most important issues we faced was, of course, what should
the book be called?  What title could we invent that would appropriately
capture a subject so near and dear to millions of our hearts?  We thought
of a whole mess of preliminary titles, such as:

o "The Ballad of Irving"

o "How To Succeed in Business Without Trying One Damn Bit"

o "I Was a Hardware Love-Slave in Bondage: Dave Haynie Tells All"

o "The Amazing Adventures of Amiga Man and his Teenage Sidekick,
   MultiTasko!"

o "From West Chester to Escom:  What a Long, Fucked Up Road
   It's Been"

o "Men Who Love Women and the Women Who Hate Their Computer
  Game Addictions"

o "Mehdio and Gouldiette"

So......  after much reasoned deliberation and argument (involving several
machetes and a gallon of molten Snapple), we came to the decision that ALL
of these titles were WAY WIMPY.  NONE of them expressed the true feelings
in our souls.  So we locked ourselves in a PADDED FALLOUT SHELTER for 48
straight hours and emerged, truimphant, with the ONE TRUE TITLE we knew
was meant for our book.  Get ready for....

        [rumble RUMBLE...!]

       "CRUSHED SKULLS:
       VIOLENT DEATH AND GERBIL LUST
       IN THE BOWELS OF COMMODORE"

    Yes!  "CRUSHED SKULLS" is due to SLAM into your local bookstore any

the reviewers have been saying about our Beta version of "CRUSHED SKULLS":

      Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History
      of Time"

    "CRUSHED SKULLS is the best book I've read this year."

    - Charles Manson

    "The fastest read I've ever experienced.  The pages whipped past my
    eyes so quickly I could hardly take in the details!  I read it
    twelve or thirteen times before I even opened up the cover!"

    - Computer Game Review

    "CRUSHED SKULLS is a total ripoff -- what a stupid book!  I can't
    believe that BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED would stoop to such a...  [knock

    **CRUNCH** BRRRRRRZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZT!!!!!!>"

   assure the "Customer Service" department that do not share the
   reviewer's views]

    Now if THOSE reviews don't sell you on the book, I don't know WHAT
will!  But just in case, here is a brief, SPINE-TINGLING EXCERPT from the
book.

    From Chapter 5, "Splattered Guts on Virtual Walls"

        "As the weeks flew by, and the development team worked diligently
on the A3000+ prototype, dark things were afoot.  Unknown to those loyal
hardware and software designers, the deadly MARKETERS were on the warpath,
wielding the ultimate weapon, Fatal Shortsightedness of Doom, and sending
it whizzing into the heart of a good idea.  'I remember those days well,'
said Mike Sinz.  'We used to hide our designs inside locked safes so the
Marketing Department wouldn't know what we were doing.  That way, they
couldn't discontinue the project.' But it was to no avail.  The A3000+ was
discovered in a daring, midnight raid on the hacker headquarters, and it
vanished into the obscurity of legend."

    Check it out, CBM fans!  Here's your chance to learn the truth, the
WHOLE truth, and NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH (except for the bits we made up). 
Watch for "CRUSHED SKULLS" any day now, d00dz!!!

DOpus5 is a work of art: probably the most configurable, versatile, and

                             POTTER ON PIRACY
                            By Jonathan Potter
===========================================================================


Jason,


I just thought I'd write a quick letter to AReport to express my
disappointment with the actions of some members of the Amiga community. 
As you may be aware, Directory Opus 5 has just been released.  This is a
significant upgrade; the program has been completely rewritten after more
than 6 months of hard work.  Less than a week after its release, pirate
copies have already spread around the world.

Software piracy is a problem as old as computers themselves, and of course
we'd be naive not to expect it.  But to have the program appear so quickly
on pirate BBS' makes me wonder just exactly how tuned in to reality some
people are.  The position of the Amiga at the moment is exceptionally
precarious, as I would have thought was obvious to anybody, and the only
thing keeping it alive are the developers who still believe in the
platform.

Many times in the past six months I've had to ask myself why I was wasting
my time programming for a nearly-dead computer.  Obviously, I do it
because I enjoy it, but the hard truth is that I have to justify it in
dollar terms - philanthropy is all well and good, but if I don't make any
money I don't eat.  The Amiga market is already small enough without the
added burden of rampant piracy to contend with.

I guess all I'm trying to do is to appeal to people; if they really
believe in the Amiga, and really want to see it continue, don't contribute
to its downfall by ripping off the hard work of the very people who are
keeping it alive.

      Regards,

      Jonathan Potter

What pirates must remember is that it takes 12 months of bloody hard work
to get a product to market, then more time to get some money in etc. 
Development of Dopus 5 was actually funded by GPFax.  It is quite simple
if people keep pirating our Amiga software we will just have to give up
and go elsewhere.  It would be a pity."

Internet: zzgperry@mailbox.uq.oz.au

First let me state: I'm not attempting to create any illusions here.  I'm
no angel, and I haven't bought every piece of software I own.  I wish I
had the money to, and if I were not a student with zero real-income I
would certainly buy a hell of a lot more software.  This message is aimed
at those who can easily afford to buy software and support their machine
but don't.  Of course some people are worse than others.  Think of those
selling pirate copies of other people's software and making so much money
that they can afford to buy mega-expensive pieces of hardware and all
kinds of stuff through virtually no work of their own (there IS such a
thing as a free-lunch).

Enough moral high-horsing, let's talk.

The Amiga is in a bad state.  It isn't a machine which is in every other
house, office, or school.  Everyone who has really got past inserting a
game at the kickstart screen knows that the Amiga has the best OS on any
home computer (sure, AmigaOS has holes in it at the moment, but I'd rather
wear a raincoat with holes than one that dissolves in water!).  Another
thing the Amiga has going for it is the great support by PD and shareware
programmers - people who really love the machine and write software for
that single reason.  Let's face it, if you look at how much software comes
out (from MicroSoft alone!) on the PC, commercial software development on
the Amiga has all but stopped in comparison.  (Of course, bar a few games,
there's very little I could do on the PC that I would not do better on an
Amiga, despite the vast amounts of releases).  I would go as far as to say
that if all commercial software development on the Amiga stopped today, I
would continue to use the Amiga for a long time to come, using the PD
software, and writing my own stuff until I could afford my own
SiliconGraphics machine, because I'm used to a REAL computer, without
bottlenecks, workarounds, bad standards, and inherently-flawed hardware
covered with a paper-thin gloss of leading edge technology.  There is some
incredible shareware software out there, but none of these people are
earning enough from it to support them.  Broadly speaking, there is a
point where projects become so large that none but the rich-hobbyist can
afford to make them just for fun and the love of a machine.  Unless you've
already made your fortune, you are simply not able to spend a year
developing a program, because you won't even be able to pay the bills to
keep your machine fed with electricity (well, OK, my SAmiLog3 is taking
about 2 years to develop, but so far it could have all been done in 2
weeks!).

So isn't it easy to understand why so many people have dumped the Amiga? 
No matter how much you love the machine, you can't make a living out of it
if not enough people buy the software.  The fact that developers who have
experienced the *JOY* of programming on the Amiga can write software in
the *DREADFULL* PC environment is an indication of just how much piracy
has affected the Amiga market.  On the PC, so many people own the machine
that stupid things like a Screen-Blanker, which would never be a
commercial product on the Amiga, have huge price tags slapped on them, and
the stupid market buys it.  (This is more or less what the PC is based on:
a STUPID market who are happy to follow all the trends because they don't
know that there is another way of doing things).  Because the PC market is
so huge now a product will make money even if only a tiny percentage of
people buy it.  Piracy may be a Robin Hood operation on the PC, but on the
Amiga it is suicide for those who love the machine, and a disappearing way
to make some quick money for those who don't give a stuff about it (notice
how most of the parasites who were in the scene to make money have left
the Amiga for the PC (of course, a large number of very talented and great
people have also gone that way too, to our loss)).

It's even worse on the PC, but I still think that the price of games on
the Amiga is too high, especially considering many will last two weeks at
most for someone like me.  But on the Amiga we simply cannot complain
about the cost of productivity programs.  Let's look at Directory Opus as
an example.  This is a program which PC users would kill for, (and they
would have to) yet it cost about the same price as many PC games!  Walk
into a software shop some day and have a look at just how much serious
software costs on the PC.  Of course, just because our (better) software
is cheaper than the PC's doesn't mean it is reasonably priced.  What is
reasonable is an individual's choice, but I personally feel that a program
such as Directory Opus is very good value for money.  Not everyone likes
DOpus, especially the controversial new version (believe me, use it for a
week and you won't ever want to go back to DOpus4 !), and it's always been
a program which has polarized opinions.  You either love it or hate it,
because a file management program is something that if you use at all, you
probably use every single day you turn your computer on.  When you use
something as good as DOpus every day, and it costs as little as it does,
there is very little excuse for not buying it.

If you're using a pirate copy of Directory Opus 5, just think about this.
Is the cost (and I would hardly call it expensive!) really so great,
considering how much work has gone (and continues to go) into the program
which you use every day and wouldn't be the same without?  If you're using
DOpus5 it is because you think it's the best, not because there is nothing
else to do the job, as there are many, many other file-management programs
for the Amiga.  It isn't like people using AmiExpress because it's
virtually the only option, despite the fact that it is incompetently
programmed and designed (if it is designed at all).  If I hated DOpus as
much as I hated AmiExpress when I used that every day too, I would never
have paid a penny for it and certainly wouldn't be urging anyone else to.
However, I have a great deal of respect for the people behind DOpus, and I
wish that they were getting rich from it (but not so rich that they
wouldn't talk to me any more :), because they certainly deserve to.

I know a lot of people read AmigaReport, so many of you will have seen the
message from Jonathan Potter about how damaging the almost instant pirate
release of DOpus was, and how upset he was personally.  Now it seems that
an internal beta copy has even been released (there isn't even honour
among thieves).  I've been talking to both Jonathan and Greg Perry a great
deal during the past few weeks and they have been both helpful with my
problems and open to my suggestions, not to mention extremely friendly and
willing to take the time to talk to me.  You wouldn't get that from a lot
of other companies, and I guess it's a little ironic that the smaller
companies can often offer better tech-support.  Greg and Jonathan have
both done a great deal for me, and this is my small way of doing (trying
to do) something in return.

I urge people not to release any more of the updates of DirectoryOpus. 
Those who would actually want the updates must like the program enough to
be able to spend the small amount of money it takes to actually buy the
program.  You can't even use the excuse that you're doing it for respect,
because virtually ANYONE who knows how to use DMS could release a new copy
of DOpus.

For the same reasons, I urge people not to release copies of the manual,
as this and tech-support are about the only incentives to buy the program
for people who don't even care about the developers and the future of the
Amiga.  There are many features of DOpus5 that you will probably never
find without reading the manual.  Incidentally, there will not be an
electronic (AmigaGuide) version of the ARexx commands appendix for the
sole reason of sales.  Think about what that means.  (Looks like I'm too
late in saying this, someone has already released the manual :( ).

Come on, if someone with as little money to spend as me at the moment can
manage to pay the small cost, surely you can too.

The only other reason that you should buy your copy of DOpus5 (for those
who really just don't care about anyone or thing but themselves) is that
DirectoryOpus has to be the most frequently "faked" program of all time. 
If I had a pound for ever fake copy (some with a virus attached) of DOpus
that I've seen on certain BBS, I would be able to buy myself a second
copy.  If you want to be able to TRUST your copies, you have to BUY them.
(For those of you thinking things are dandy, BOTH of the TWO versions
claiming to be Directory Opus v5.1 are BOTH *BETA* versions, and not the
real v5.1!!  (YES, even the "German release" one).  How does that make you
feel about trusting new versions?  Next time it could look just as much
like an official release but wipe your harddrive.)

DOpus5 is STILL being worked on and updated.  Think how many of the great
Amiga programs you use on a daily basis are still being updated.  We
really cannot afford to left any more developers leave our platform if we
want our software to continue to be up there with the other machines'.

           OPEN LETTER TO AMIGA TECHNOLOGIES, DR. PETER KITTEL
  Bob Richardson, MagicBox Inc.                        magicbox@peak.org
==========================================================================

May 8, 1995

Escom AG
ATTN: Dr. Peter Kittel
Tiergartenstr. 9
D-64646 Heppenheim
Germany

Dear Mr. Kittel:

Greetings.  We have been following your posts to the internet for quite
some time, and were very glad to hear of your new position with Escom.
Our company markets products to the cable television industry, and relies
heavily on the Amiga hardware and operating system both for development
and our final product.  Our products range from a low-cost character
generator, based on the CD32 repackaged in a rack-mount chassis, on up to
large distributed display systems based on multiple A4000's.

This letter addresses our suggestions for what features we feel are
essential for future machines, both for our needs and the general needs of
the Amiga community.  As you said in your post today, the most important
thing right now is to get the existing models back in production.


Short Term Suggestions:

As you have mentioned in your posts, it is very important to keep the
price of the low-end machines down.  We definitely feel the same way, and
recognize the need for those machines in the marketplace.  Therefore, our
suggested changes primarily apply to high-end machines, and the changes
for low-end models are primarily related issues such as board layout.

We feel that certain features which are not present in current models have
provided significant problems for marketing the machines.  For future
models, we think the following relatively simple changes will add
tremendous value:

1. SCSI in the high-end machines (A4000)

Well over 90% of the Amiga 4000's we have shipped and encountered in the
United States market have had to be equipped with a SCSI board, which
occupies a Zorro slot.  Because many of these system use the Video
Toaster, which covers over but does not use two Zorro slots, only one slot
is left free for networking, video capture, extra serial ports, etc.  The
addition of a SCSI controller (such as found in the A3000) will free up an
extra slot, while simultaneously reducing the overall cost of putting a
system together, since adding 3rd party cards is inevitably more
expensive.

2. Video output in the high-end machines

The A600, A1200, and CD32 provide a composite color video output which
provide a remarkably high quality signal, better than most low-end
genlocks.  This solution should also be included in the A4000.  If all you
want to do is record your productions direct to video tape, you shouldn't
have to buy an expensive genlock or waste your video slot.  The exact same
circuitry as the A1200/CD32 video encoder would be more than acceptable
for most uses.

3. Audio input and/or extra parallel port in the high-end machines

Most of the A4000's in the USA become equipped with a parallel-port based
audio digitizer, such as the MegaloSound from HiSoft/AVR.  Unfortunately,
this requires the use of a switchbox or a Zorro slot with an extra
parallel port, which is expensive, if you want to have a printer.  Having
this very inexpensive A/D circuitry integrated into the computer, or
providing an extra parallel port for a printer (or PARnet, etc.), would
eliminate this problem, and provide for more favorable direct comparison
to competition from the A/V Macintosh line of machines.

4. Internal keyboard header in the low-end machines

As I mentioned earlier, we repackage machines, such as the CD32 (and SX1)
into a 19" rack-mount chassis.  We have been doing this since the days of
the A500.  Unfortunately, this is very difficult to do with newer machines
like the A600 and A1200.  The A500 provided all the necessary keyboard
controller lines on a header connector on the motherboard.  Hooking an
external keyboard to the A600/1200 requires soldering directly to chips or
traces.  Having the keyboard controller lines available just as blank,
drilled pads that we can solder to would only add a couple of cents of
cost to future machines, but would be of tremendous value to OEMs such as
ourselves.

5. Connectors should all be on front or rear of high-end machines

If at all possible, the location of the mouse connectors should be moved
to the front or rear of the computer, as was the case on the A2000.  By
having connectors on the side of the machine, mounting of the cabinet in a
permanent environment, such as a rack, is difficult, and sometimes
impossible.

6. PCMCIA connector on low-end machines should be relocated

We find the PCMCIA port to be of tremendous value, and use it for both
SCSI and Ethernet applications.  Unfortunately, the present location again
provides problems for mounting of card-equipped machines in a rack, or in
a professional setting.  The best solution for us would be to have this
connector present on the rear of the case, or recessed in a trapdoor.  If
it must remain on the left, perhaps moving it further toward the rear, and
providing a greater depth for card insertion.

We feel that the above suggestions, if implemented in the first round of
new models, would greatly increase the usefulness of Amigas in a
professional environment, while minimizing the cost impact to the lower
models.


Long Term Goals

We have three additional suggestions for the future, which I will present
here.  Two are for new low-end models, and one is for the long-term future
of Amiga O/S development.

1. Faster processor in the A1200

If (and only if) the component prices are low enough, the A1200 should get
a processor upgrade.  The simplest change, which wouldn't require a
substantial redesign, would be to double the clock speed of the 68020 to
28MHz.  A better solution would be to go with a 68030, with more address
lines brought to the trapdoor, for more memory expansion.  This would
probably introduce compatibility problems and higher costs, however. 
Another suggestion would be to include SIMM sockets on the A1200
motherboard itself, so that the trapdoor could be used for other
applications without always having to squeeze memory onto the cards.  A
problem many users face is that they buy one trapdoor card that accepts
one type of memory, then later upgrade to a more powerful trapdoor card
and find they have to buy all new memory.

2. Introduce an intermediate model that fits between the A1200 and A4000.

We see a need in the video production and education markets, especially in
the USA, for a very low cost Amiga model that appears more high end in
terms of case design than the A1200.  We feel such a machine could be
produced using existing motherboard designs and would represent a good
niche between the A1200 and A4000.  Start with an A1200 motherboard, but
put it in a plastic pizza-box style (thin form-factor) case with the
floppy drive located in the front, and enough internal room for a 3.5" IDE
drive.  Provide a connector for a standard external Amiga keyboard.  This
machine will not cost much more than an A1200 to produce, and won't
require a substantial redesign, but will easily overcome the established
resistance in the US marketplace to console-style case designs.  This
would also be an ideal platform for low-cost multimedia delivery (see the
CD32 section below).

3. Port the Amiga O/S to your chosen RISC platform

The Amiga O/S is one of the last truly efficient, compact designs.  It can
be argued than a RISC-based Amiga that runs under Windows NT or such is
not really an Amiga.  We feel that in order for the basic design
philosophies that the Amiga represents to carry on into the future, the
operating system must be represented on future architectures, even if this
takes much time to materialize.  Without AmigaDOS, a RISC-based Amiga will
just be a Windows box with a nice chipset.


The CD32

This product deserves special mention.  The CD32 has kept our company (and
many others) going through Commodore crisis of the past year, as A1200's
and A4000's are unavailable.  We have gone so far as to design a 3" x 19"
x 17" chassis that accommodates a CD32, SX1, 3.5" HD Floppy, 3.5" hard
drive, and 3.5" 270MB SyQuest drive for our high end systems traditionally
made up of A4000's.

We feel that the CD32 has a good future as an ideal kiosk / multimedia
delivery platform, and hope to see production continued.

We wouldn't change a thing for the base model, as the inclusion of
non-volatile RAM, keyboard and serial ports makes it a good all-around
machine.  A step up for multimedia producers would be a CDTV-style design
with an integrated floppy drive.  This could also be accomplished with the
intermediate A1200-A4000 machine described earlier and an internal CD-ROM
drive.


Thank you for taking the time to consider these suggestions.  We are
looking forward to the results of your new efforts with Escom.  If you
have any questions, please feel free to contact me.  You may call me at
[phone numbers removed from public post], or send email to
magicbox@peak.org.

Congratulations once again on your new position; we wish you the best of
luck.

Petro Tyschtschenko
General Manager, Amiga Technologies GmbH

Ladies and gentlemen,

As the General manager of Amiga Technologies GmbH, I would like to welcome
you to the first press conference of our new company and also tell you how
much we appreciate your presence here.

At a spectacular auction, five weeks ago in New York, ESCOM AG acquired
the rights to the intellectual property of the former Commodore company
for 10 Mio $, including all trademarks, logos, products and licences.

Since the day we succeeded in buying the Amiga technology, many people
have asked us how the future will look for their computer of choice.  We
got floods of anxious faxes and letters to which we couldn't give an
answer at once because things were too early to comment.  We will use the
opportunity we have now to talk to all of you and present the new Escom
daughtercompany, Amiga Technologies.  Some leading developpers of hardware
and software for the Amiga as well as some of our new licensing partners
will present themselves and their projects to us.

To clear up things from the beginning, - and that's the point you are all
interested in - I want to make the comittment that we are determined to
resume production and also want to continue hardware and software
development of what we believe is a superior technology.  That's why we
created Amiga Technologies and we are now hiring the best and most capable
people to accomplish this.

For a sucessfull Multimedia company like ESCOM, the Commodore Patents and
licences concerning Amiga are considered the key to multimedia technology.
Mister Schmitt will say more about this later.

But let's concentrate on our immediate plans.  As the director of Amiga
Technologies, my first priority now is to resume production of Commodore
and Amiga computers and bring them on the market as soon as possible.  For
us, this means September 1995.

I would also like to refer to Commodore computers, Pentium PCs, which will
be available in August this year.  These will be fully loaded P75 and P100
multimedia PCs.  They will be assembled in our own ESCOM facilities.  We
plan to sell between 50 000 and 60 000 units before the end of this year.
Let me point out that the Commodore and Amiga operations will be separate,
Amiga Technologies will only take care of Amiga, whereas ESCOM will
provide Commodore PCs.

One month later, we will start producing the high-end multimedia Amiga
4000 T.  To succeed in keeping that tight schedule, we negotiated with
well known producers in Europe and Asia.  For the selection of the
manufacturing partner, we will be emphasizing the quality requirements.

Until the end of the year, we plan to produce enough machines to meet the
demand.  These machines are already outsold in preorders.  In October, the
production of the low-end A1200 will begin.  We expect to ship enough
untis as well as CD 32 game consoles to meet the Christmas season demand.
Please give us more time to publish quantities.

The takeover of the inventory, which is mainly composed of spare parts, in
the UK and Germany is completed.  The rumoured stocks of new Amigas ready
to be sold do not exist.  For inventory in the Phillipines, we are
currently negotiating with the local trustees.

Ladies and gentlemen, the new Amiga Technology will now become the
operating center of an international Company held 100% by ESCOM AG.  Our
headquarters in Bensheim will employ around 50 people for following tasks
: development, support to developers, resellers, and users, production
management, Marketing, PR and administration.  We also took over the
former Commodore development center in Norristown, with its research and
development facilities.  Eduard Goff, former Vice President and General
counsel at Commodore now leads that center.  He will talk to you later.
Our developers are now working on the next generation RISC based Amigas as
well as on improving current models.  Here, we are working in a tight
partnership with SCALA and MOTOROLA.

Amiga Technologies GmbH expects a turnover of 100 Mio DM in 1995, mainly
from the Christmas business with Amiga 1200, 4000 and CD32.  Our monthly
expenses are evaluated at around 600 000 DM.  The break even point should
be reached this year.  We are confident that we will have rentabilized our
10 Mio $ investment by spring 1996 with Amiga sales and licences.

I will be here again for further questions later this afternoon, but now
let me introduce M Manfred Schmitt, Chairman of the executive board at
ESCOM.

@endnode
@node SC "Manfred Schmidt"

Manfred Schmitt
Escom AG
Chairman of the Executive Board

Ladies and gentlemen,

Since we won the auction for the intellectual property of Commodore and
Amiga, the ESCOM AG is flooded with congratulation messages.  Amiga clubs
and Amiga users write to ask us to revive and continue to develop and
improve the Amiga.  Many of them actually sent us their wishes for future
hardware architectures and operating systems improvements.

However, it is still unclear for many users how a PC manufacturer and
retailer will use the Amiga technology.

Here is our answer: 

ESCOM now turns from a PC manufacturer and retailer into a multimedia
company.  The big multimedia applications will come very soon as Pay-TV,
Video on demand, homebanking, home-shopping and online services.  In this
growing market, we want to become a leading provider of hardware, software
and solutions.  Our goal is to give the user a cost-efficient way to
access all these new services the multimedia world will allow.  The Amiga
technology brings us all we need here in an elegant way.  We see in the
Amiga the key to Multimedia technologies for the future.

As an intelligent terminal, you all know the PC.  Many people use the PC
in conjunction with a modem to access online services and the worldwide
Internet.  Escom is providing that market with a wide palette of
advantageoulsy priced Multimedia PCs in a range between 2000 and 3000 DM.

But there are other user profiles, who want to use the multimedia
technology without having to spend several thousands of DM.  For these
users, the Amiga represents a very interesting alternative.  It stands out
with an amazing price/quality ratio.  Also remarkable is the operating
system with a still unmatched multitasking ability.  That means that
several applications can run simultaneously, depending on available memory
without slowing down the whole system.  This is achieved by the smart
resource sharing of the system and the low consumption of RAM and
processing power by the applications.

The Amiga operating system needs 8 times less memory than Windows, and it
multitasks better than Windows.  Through this smart use of system
resources, the Amiga is still a very efficient and unexpensive computer.

Video is another strength of the Amiga.  In this aspect, the Amiga is
superior to the PC.  The video output of the Amiga is already PAL and NTSC
compatible, so it can just be plugged into a TV or any video monitor.  A
PC needs a converter to do this.  The Amiga represents a possibility to
give people access to interactive television, online services and pay TV
with set top boxes at decent prices like 400 DM.  The market is huge
because there are much more televisions than computers in the homes.

The set top box is a concrete application involving Amiga technology that
we want to improve.  For the American market, which is much more advanced
than in Europe in this regard, we already have license agreements with our
partner VisCorp - our first licence by the way.  We are willing to be very
flexible and open-minded regarding licensing of our technology.  Amiga
developers and manufacturers shall have the chance to talk with us to
define partnerships or license agreements.  Together, we will develop a
wide range of Amiga hardware and software.  Our goal is a productive, open
amiga technology.  The example of Viscorp demonstrates it at best : we
license Amiga technology to people who want to integrate it in their own
products.  The press already talked about another partner, the Tianjin
Family-Used Multimedia Co.  Ltd.  They will build the lower range of Amiga
computers and revive the legendary Commodore 64 for the chinese market.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have mainly talked about the Amiga.  In New York,
we also took over another well known brand : Commodore.  All of you surely
remember the good old Commodore 64 and its tremendous success in the early
eighties.  It is still a famous episode in the home computer history that
could be compared to the Volkswagen Beetle.  A recent study made by the
german economic magazine DM reveals that the name Commodore still has very
high recognition.  93 percent of all PC users know the trademark
Commodore.  such a reputation is only surpassed by IBM.

We will now separate Commodore and Amiga operations.  Amiga will be the
multimedia range with Motorola processors and Commodore for Intel based
Personal Computers.  We want to use all available and appropriate
distribution channels both for Commodore and Amiga: specialized retail
stores, warehouses, and mail order services.  The ESCOM subsidiaries are
only one of many possibilities.

Ladies and gentlemen, we are convinced that ESCOM, Commodore and Amiga
will become a sucess story.  Look at the structure and competencies we
have built up in a short time.

Thank you.

Dr. Peter Kittel, Amiga Technologies GmbH,
on the press conference 30 May 1995 in Frankfurt

Ladies and gentlemen,

As Head of the Product Planning Group of the new Amiga Technologies GmbH I
would like to give you an overview about the past and the technical future
in our view.

The company Commodore started in 1958 as a typewriter repair company
followed by production of electric typewriters, digital watches,
calculators and video games.  In 1977, there was launched one of the first
real desktop computers, the legendary PET 2001.  It was followed by the
CBM series, where the CBM 8032 dominated the german bureau market in 1980
and the following years, just before the breakthrough of the IBM PC.
These 8000 series had a reputation of being especially easy to use and to
program and being robust, a similar reputation like the Volkswagen beetle.


Simultaneously Commodore started the Home Computer market in 1981 with the
VIC 20, soon followed by the C 64.  The C 64 became the top selling
computer ever, its success and sold number is again only comparable to the
Volkswagen beetle.  In this way Commodore had generated two different
markets which complemented each other nicely.

The year 1985 brought great news.  In spring Commodore introduced the
IBM-compatible PC 10, and in July in New York during a gala show the
Amiga.

- The PC 10 succeeded to carry on the advantages of the 8000 series and at
least in Europe to increase the professional reputation.

- The Amiga was far ahead its time with its graphics and sound
capabilities and got an euphoric reception by the computer press.  >From
its first days software and hardware vendors exploited the special
capabilities of the Amiga to display graphics, or also animated graphics,
all accompanied by synchronized sound.  Only later the term "Multimedia"
was invented for this, the Amiga did it from day one.

The special capabilities of the Amiga are due to two aspects, its special
hardware - the Custom Chips with the familiar names Paula, Agnus, and
Denise - and on the other hand its Operating System.  Looking back, one
can only admire how well suited for the future this unique operating
system was designed in the early 80's.  As a result it offers still
unmatched multitasking ability.  The Amiga reacts immediately on every
user input and wastes no time for administrative tasks.  Typically you can
run several big applications in parallel, without noticing a slow down of
any of them.  This all while the Amiga uses its resources like memory in
RAM or on disk very efficiently, so that it appears always a bit faster
through this aspect, and also doesn't stress the wallet of its owner in
regards of big RAM or harddisks.  A further feature of the Amiga is its
video compatibility by using scan frequencies typical for video, as well
as its ability to get genlocked.  Every Amiga from the low-end to high-end
provides this feature.  Many video and TV studios use the Amiga as an
integral part of their equipment.

To show more concretely where the Amiga comes from, here is a picture of
the genius behind the Amiga Custom Chips, Jay Miner, who passed away last
year.

The breakthrough for the Amiga came in 1987, when the first Amiga 1000 was
followed by two successors, the Amiga 500 as a dedicated home computer and
the Amiga 2000 as a professional workplace computer.  The A500 became
immediately the star of the home computer scene and dominated it for
several years, so that Commodore nearly gained a monopoly in this low-cost
market.  On the other end, the A2000 featured the Open System
Architecture, so that add-on vendors could offer everything from an
external video digitizer to a turbo board with a bigger processor.  One
other unique Amiga feature helped here, which is called "Autoconfig": You
can just plug in cards and don't need to bother for DIP switches or
jumpers, a feature that's only now slowly emerging as "Plug&Play" also on
PCs.

The year 1994 brought the breakdown of Commodore, after the financial
reserves had been exhausted by some fatal management decisions.  The
liquidators tried to sell the company, but only in spring 1995, on the
auction of April 20th and 21st in New York, the german company Escom won
and took over Commodore completely.

Under the wing of Escom AG, Amiga Technologies GmbH will concentrate
exclusively on the Amiga, to restart its production and develop it
further.

The current Amiga generation offers a full palette from the absolute
Low-End - the Multimedia Game Console CD32 - over the full-featured home
computer A1200 up to the High-End with the A4000 Tower.  Concurrent
platforms try to state it as normal that you get a trade-off between
enhanced features and speed.  But the Amiga shows that this has not to be
the case for a really modern operating system.  The professionality of the
Amiga's video features shows up frequently in the recent past, in that
several TV series in USA are now produced completely on Amigas for their
video effect parts.  Two examples are SeaQuest DSV and Babylon V.

After the takeover the new company is conscious of the necessity to
further develop the Amiga platform, as the competition has not stood
still.  The new Amiga company will therefore install an engineering
division that can make the transition into a new generation happen.

In the mid term future this will lead to stronger processors and otherwise
enhanced versions of the current models.

The big perspective for the future consists in a port of the Amiga
architecture to a RISC platform, to assure the awaited power for the
future.  The very first task of this new engineering division will be to
prepare this decision.  Which of the concurring RISC platforms will be the
optimum for the special case of the Amiga, is no trivial decision.  On one
side it is a goal to bring the Amiga nearer to the "Mainstream", so that
it becomes easier to port and run existing application programs.  On the
other hand, the future computer should always remain recognizable as an
"Amiga" that is not assimilated among an amorphous mass of similar
computers.  The Amiga once started with far superior graphics and sound
capabilities, and should by all means regain this advantage.

To fulfill both requirements, there are currently two alternatives, the
PowerPC and the HP PA RISC.  Both have advantages and disadvantages, and
they will get thoroughly judged.

Concurrent with this, the operating system will have to get adapted to
this new hardware platform, plus will adapt to new requirements like 3D
graphics, texture mapping, Object Oriented design and other current
technologies.  This task will be not as difficult as some might suspect,
as we can build on a basis which was always designed with progress in
mind.  Let's look forward to a great future of the Amiga architecture!

@node FR "Jeff Frank"

Jeff Frank
Amiga Technologies GmbH

My name is Jeff Frank and I have been retained by Amiga Technologies GmbH
to provide technical assistance with respect to Engineering and
Manufacturing Amiga related products.  Previously I have been with
Commodore International Ltd.  for nearly nine years, primarily as Director
of Engineering.

I am sure you are all as happy as I to hear that the "Amiga" is indeed
alive and well!

Initially, most of our labours will be focused on resuming production of
the A4000 Tower and A1200 class products.  In fact, the A4000 Tower will
be much like a new product introduction, considering that Commodore only
ever built 1000 units.  The A4000 Tower and A1200 will feature the
AmigaDOS 3.1 Operating System which was not in wide release prior to
Commodore's demise.  We will also pursue both tactical and strategic
enhancements to the Amiga product line over the months and years to come.


Tactically, our first and perhaps the most obvoius enhancement will be a
68060 processor upgrade to the A4000 Tower.  We also believe that a
performance upgrade to the A1200 by moving from an EC020 to an EC030
processor as well as built in support for fast ram capability is a logical
step.

Strategically, we are looking into creating "Encapsulated Amiga
Environments" or Emulations for the IBM and Apple environments.  Also,
potential ports of AmigaDOS to non-Amiga platforms will be assessed.  We
feel that this is a way we may help the Amiga Technology to permeate other
Computing Environments.  We will also consider merging architectures of
available RISC technologies and the Amiga technology.

We also feel very strongly that the "Amiga Technology" has applications in
many non-traditional computing environments, and we will vigorously pursue
relationships in order to promote the Amiga Technology.  The Amiga
operating System "AmigaDOS" features a low overhead Kernel and efficient
use of memory, which makes it well suited to Multimedia and embedded
applications, such as interactive TV set-top boxes.  The Amiga "AA" core
chipset features low-cost genlock support, high performance graphics and
animation capabilities, and direct support of broadcast quality PAL and
NTSC video standards making the technology ideal for video effects, video
production and interactive TV set-top boxes.  We feel that the time is
right to establish this technology as a potential standard in these
embedded applications, particularly here in Europe where these
applications are just emerging and the participants can benefit from the
many mistakes made by similar vendors in North America.  Strategically, we
will look toward advancing the core Amiga technology where possible and
practical.

In closing I would like to say that we are very excited about Amiga's
future.

(Founder of Scala, Vice President New Business Development)

Scala is in the business of computer television: that is, using a computer
to produce and distribute television type programming.

The company is one of the world's leading developers of computer-based
television information solutions and the undisputed leader in multimedia
software fot the Amiga platform.  Available in eleven languages, Scala's
multimedia tools are distributed in more than 40 countries.

Scala was founded in Norway in 1987.  Today we are headquartered outside
Washington, DC, with international headquarters in Oslo and offices in the
United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden.  Scala's team of
sortware engineers includes most of the people who originally developed
the Amiga operating system for Commodore.

Our main products are Scala MultiMedia, a software package for the
production and playback of multimedia presentations, interactive training
applications, infotainment, and video titling; Scala InfoChannel, for
multimedia networking and information distribution; and Scala Interactive
Television, including software for the production of TV content and the
operating environment for satellite and cable TV decoders.

All products share the Scala BackBone technology.  This makes the software
independent of hardware platorm and makes the Scala solutions portable to
multiple environments.  BackBone includes MMOS, which is an
object-oriented operating system layer specifically developed for
multimedia applications, and ScalaScript which is the scripting language
we seek to establish as the standard multimedia language of the future.

Since the Amiga went out of production a year ago Scala has seen a
constant demand for Amigas, from both new and experienced users.  We are
happy to see production resume, and to continue to support the Amiga
platform.

Together the Scala software technology and the Amiga hardware technology
make up a powerful and cost effective solution for everyone who needs a
multimedia package for home or office use.  No other solution can match
the price performance of the Amiga and Scala combination.  We look forward
to working closely with the neew Amiga Technologies company in order to
provide ready-to-use solutions with every machine.

Scala's good design has long been one of our strongest assets, and it is
an acknowledgement of our achievements that Escom has chosen one of our
designers to create the new look for the new Amiga.

The Rebirth of the Amiga

Reincarnation means to continue life, but in another body and in another
place.  The similarities of the Amiga rebirth is obvious.

When designing a new Amiga, one should pay more attention to making the
bodyshell relect that this is a different machine, and a different
computer platform.

Furthermore, the Amiga is a creative tool in creative environments, and it
must therefore relate to this situation.

Wolf Dietrich
Phase 5 digital products

My name is Wolf Dietrich from phase 5 digital products, a Frankfurt based
manufacturer of AMIGA perhipherals.  I am happy to present to you at this
re-introduction of the AMIGA series of computers the latest generation of
the 68k series of processors, the superscalar 68060 CPU.  phase 5 digital
products has developed the first fully operational implementation of this
processor for the Amiga marketed as the Cyberstorm 060 accelerator, which
is available now and shipping.

With this implementation of the powerful 68060 processor the new AMIGA
models make a step ahead into the leading group of today's microcomputer
systems.  The 68060 processor combines the powerful functionality and
instruction set of earlier 68k processors with a new superscalar
architecture and adds performance-boosting features like two parallel
integer instruction units, larger data and instruction caches of 8k size,
a branch cache, and pipelined write accesses; this all means a combination
of the industries most advanced technologies for processing performance
enhancements.

While software compatibility with existing applications is fully
maintained, more than 80 mips processing power ie: real world applications
on the AMIGA perform competitively with other high-end systems such as
Pentium and PowerPC based machines.  In combination with the AMIGA's other
architectural advantages this makes a powerful system for all
semi-professional and professional applications, perfectly suited for
today's requirements for multimedia computing.

The figures shown here indicate the performance leap which the 68060
brings to the AMIGA.  With speed increases by a factor of between 4 and 5
times over the performance of the original 68040 based AMIGA systems -
which have been powerful machines already - time-consuming applications
are dramatically accelerated.  These application benchmarks, however,
still use unoptimized 68040 code, which can be accelerated another 1.5
times by simple optimization to the 68060's special features, which is a
most simple task for software developers now that the 68060 is available.


The scalable superscalar architecture also opens a wide future for options
such as multi-processor systems, which either combine multiple 68060
processors, or even integrate other CPUs into such a system to build a
most flexible computer system for many various tasks.

As a conclusion, it can be said that the 68060 processor, integrated into
the AMIGA architecture, offers true workstation power.  With this
competitive performance and the full integration with the AMIGA's
architectural advantages the AMIGA will hold it's position as an
outstanding multimedia computing system.

Prof. Dr. Hartmut Esslinger

The 70's were the decade of marketing
the 80's were the decade of finance
the 90's will be the decade of design.
(Business Week Magazine 1990)

Reading this quote from Business Magazine, New York, one may be inclined
to look at design like a magic medicine.

I feel that the prominence of design today has more to do with market
reality.  Today, basically great production and functional quality is
plentiful technical performance is exchangable, be it computers,
automobiles, TVs, clothing - basically it's all the same.  The markets and
product-features are transparent like glass-houses, the customer knows
nearly everything, even the margins lay in the open, there is no feature
the competition doesn't have have very soon too, no major technical
differentiation has been left in High-Tech.  Except innovative, human
culture, adapting products to people's specific needs - escpecially
emotional ones, DESIGN, Integrated Strategic Design to be precise.

Our own market research shows us, that in the field of TEDology products
(Richard Wurman: Technology-Entertainment-Design as the new global
industry)

* Ten years ago 4 in 5 potential customers looked at technology and price,
  and only 2 in 5 cared for design, ease of use and ergonomics.

* Today 4 in 5 potential customers make a buying decision based upon
  design but they expect the price to be about 30% lower than the
  "elite-design target-group" would have accepted 10 years ago.

Design however is not defined by qualified aesthetics alone, some people
list design as a visible principle of quality, some people define design
still as a matter of prestige, and some just look at the level of
excitement that design will provide.

Design is becoming different, democratic, open, free Design is reflecting
our open society; many dreams, many ideas, many truths.  With design being
considered a popular issue, no artificial add-on is considered competent
anymore, no stylistic exclusion of the masses for the benefit of an elite
will be tolerated.

DESIGN is requested, feasible and available in what futurist Alvin Toffler
calls the "individual mass product".

We all know Commodore and AMIGA meant as High-Tech brands: Commodore was
an affordable way to get into personal computing, the first AMIGA-machine
actually was created just one mile off my house in Los Gatos - and
personally I know some people who created the machine very well.  But for
some not so trivial reasons, the brands were managed out of the market.

Now - after ESCOM acquired them - NOW

* what will happen to the legendary brands?

* what will be the future products?

* how will they look and feel?

* to whom will they appeal?

* and will there be a new legend?

We have set three goals:

Our new product will emerge from what Richard Wurman calls TEDology, or
what Nicholas Negroponte calls the new domain of "creative digital life"

* Technology

  we will apply the best of Microsoft/Intel

  we will apply the best of Macintosh/PowerPC

  we will apply the hottest Technology in Games

  and we will apply the newest in Digital Television, Audio and Video.

* Entertainment

The new Commodore and Amiga products will be accessible by innovative and
cultural software-interface solutions, which will be easy to use and
powerful tools.  I personally feel that our new products will create a new
standard for people-oriented high-tech consumer products.

* Design

Our new products will be high-tech-fashion statements,
some will appeal to young people, as statements of a new culture,
some will appeal to women, emotional and elegant,
some will appeal to power-hungry web-surfers,
some will appeal to machine-crazies,
we will introduce colour on a bigger scale,
and we will create the opportunity of design-customization.

As we just started to conceptualize and design the new product lines, I
cannot show you anything concise or descriptive at this time.  I can only
explain our "way of design" a little bit and illustrate it with examples:

* historic frogdesign breakthroughs, which were then assumptions of
  the future or became huge successes, changing High-Tch into High-
  Fashion.

and as I am also a teacher,

* the way students look at the future, they will live in as designers
  soon too.

but you will not feel left out completely

* because at the end of my short presentation

I will show you the new brand identities of Commodore and AMIGA and one
short 3 second peek into the design-work under way.

Let me also remark shortly on the new way of doing business in Computing,
(which since about 20 years is at the centre of my professional life):

* It is very competitive, but due to standards it's based on Win - Win

* It is about working together, repecting people and nature

* It is about building alliances, rather than destroying common
  ground.

@node GO "Ed Goff"

Ed Goff
Lawyer - employed by ESCOM and Amiga Technologies GmbH

My name is Ed Goff.  I'm a Philadelphia lawyer working with Escom and
Amiga technologies GmbH, on a wide variety of issues related to the
re-launch of Amigas.

In particular, I will talk today on issues of Licensing.

Our strategy will be somewhat different than the strategy that you saw
from Commodore in the past.  It is our intention to have strategic program
for Amigas that will be as open as possible, and which will therefore
drive the Amiga technology into as wide a range of products and
applications as possible.

First I would like to discuss the broadest type of licensing arrangements
that will fit within our plan, Strategic alliances.  We intend to
consummate arragements for further development of the Amiga technologies
together with strategic partners.  These partners may be one or more well
known names in the electronics and telecommunications industries.
Together with the strategic partner or partners we intend to fund further
development of new and advanced products based partly on Amiga and partly
on proprietary and public systems provided by the strategic partner.

Unfortunately I am not at liberty at this time to discuss or even identify
potential strategic partners, as some of these discussions are at a very
early stage.  However you can understand that these strategic arrangements
often take the form of joint ventures, cross- licenses, cost and
risk-sharing agreements, and capital arrangements.  As a result we can
only announce the nature of such a strategic arrangement consistent with
the wishes of the strategic partner at the time the arrangement is
finalized.

A second area of Licensing that falls within our strategic framework for a
more open Amiga is embedded technology.  We are currently pursuing
opportunities for licensing the Amiga technology or portions of it to
enterprises in there industries who will embed the Amiga in their
products.  One example of this sort of arrangement is VisCorp, a potential
maker of TV set-top boxes.  As you have heard or may hear from my
colleagues, it is our belief that the Amiga presents uniquely attractive
and cost effective solutions to enterprises attempting to meet the
specifications of the telecommunications and cable industries.  It is our
belief that encouraging vendors in these markets to embed Amiga
capabilities or features could be very exciting, and hopefully rewarding.
In this regard I encourage you to make our intentions known as widely as
possible so that we can get the broadest possible spectrum of embedded
technology licensees.

A third and less grandiose area of licensing involves people and companies
who are already using the technology covered by the portfolio of patents
copyrights and trademarks now owned by Escom.  Often this area can be
unpleasant because some of these folks have never recognised in any formal
way their use of the technology.  We intend to review a wide variety of
products and components with a view to developing a licensing arrangement
with their makers, users and sellers.  At the moment, this is an uncharted
area.  It requires fairly intensive reviews, and often difficult
discussions.  For that reason, I am unable to give you further details on
potential licensees at this time.

@node GI "Don Gilbreath"

Don Gilbreath
Chief Technical Officer, VisCorp.

Hello my name is Don Gilbreath.  I have 12 years association with
Commodore.  I have worked in various capacities from engineering to
technical sales and marketing.  As a Director of Product and Market
Development, I designed and managed among other products the team that
brought the CDTV to market.

I am happy to be here today for the re-birth of Amiga.  After spending
some quality time with ESCOM management, I am convinced they possess the
marketing finesse and strength to make Amiga successful into the 21st
century.

Currently, I am Chief Technical Officer for VisCorp, an interactive
set-top box developer and application designer based in the United States.
Our executive offices are in Chicago, and we have engineering teams based
in West Chester, Pennsylvania and the Silcon Valley.  VisCorp is the first
company to be granted a license to use the Amiga technology in interactive
set-tops.

Before I explain why we believe Amiga is the right platform of choice for
set-tops, let me explain the current landscape of North America set-top
offerings.

We are aware of some 40 set-top projects.  Seventeen design wins alone are
for Philips chip sets and an OS9 derivative (DAVID), the closest
competition for an Amiga offering.

Som eof the other set-top projects (or camps) range from pure video
game-based platforms such as Nintendo, Sony, and Sega to a multi-
function, cost prohibitive (in terms of memory) Microsoft-based platform
as well as similar offerings from Apple, SUN, and Silicon Graphics.  Amiga
will find a home between these two ranges in terms of cost/features and
the development community.

There is another camp which tend to be as much of a target as a potential
partner and include Scientific Atlanta and General Instrument.  They are
currently not strong in computer technology as cable modems, video
delivery, and authorization schemes.  There is synergy and relationships
with development between Amiga and these two companies in particular.

What is this set-top business all about?

1 Selling product - initial hardware sale/lease or licensing - the
  enabling technology

2 Potential of ongoing revenues - hard goods - soft goods - providing
  movies, telephone service, and grocery shopping

3 Controlling transactions - classic gate keeper model

We need a consortium because the following is at stake:

1 Self-intereest in semiconductors - hardware design win.

2 Operating system dominance - where applications reside.

3 Delivery system dominance - cable, teleco, radio, satellite, etc.

4 Development community - tools and understanding of next generation
  software.

5 Secure tranactions - financial and developer community backed (musicains
  to software writers).  to the cusomer it must be friendly and secure

Set-top world common goal:

1 Low cost -

2 Content rich - variety

3 Deploy a platform to meet the above parameters: Allow an upgrade path
  similar to a computer i.e.  cable modem du jour, MPEG audio/video, etc.,
  ISDN, wireless cable modems, etc.

The confusion:

1% homes wired for 2-way high-speed data....

The confusion stems from how this magic, high-speed data arrives to the
home: Is it telephone, satellite, radio, cable, or some hybrid?  In our
model it does not matter.  We have OEM activities today in all of these
areas.

Our present VisCorp model, which is in homes today under the guise of a
market test, is a hybrid model utilizing both analog telephone and
broadcast data video.  When the cable modem and digital video technologies
settle, the federal laws may change as well.  Our strategy is to deploy a
product that is useful today but provides a migration path to this over
hybrid, high speed, low cost world we don't live in.

The current product:

Over the past few years, we at VisCorp have been developing an interactive
set-top platform.  The VisCorp product starts by converging the television
set with the telephone.  It convers the TV set into an executive
speakerphone with one-touch on-screen dialling and caller ID.  It has
built in filters and font generators to convert on-line data services to
text that is readable at standard TV viewing distances.  It has a built-in
credit card reader and can support electronic directories, classified
advertising, and catalogue shopping applications.  Other features include
on-screen TV listings with one button recording facility, sending faxes
and e-mail, and accessing InterNet and multi-participant games (thousands
playing simultaneously) that in some cases are tied to live TV events with
national scoring in place prizes and cash where legal.

The VisCorp product is currently being tested on a cable system in a
Detroit suburb where it is also suppoting one-touch ordering of pay-
per-view and access to local bulletin board service including restaurant
reviews and local civic information.

So this sounds like a great product.  So why the Amiga?  Is there
something wrong?  Absolutely nothing.  It is our entry model, suitable
today, and can be sold at retail 1995 for under 300 USD or the price of a
feature rich telephone, which it is.  We have a custom chip program
nearing completion that further cost reduces this product and enables
further dimensions in interactive TV in terms of the toy industry and
education.

The Amiga-based version will be our second model.  We plan to embark on a
crash program to further develop a chipset with our combined licenses and
patented technologies with Amiga functionality.  The combined
Amiga/VisCorp interactive TV platform will support all currently
envisioned interactive applications with the exception of full motion
video on demand and practical speed CD Audio delivery.  We do not think
this is a handicap as a base case offering.  Speciality markets or cable
customers can be addressed with additional modules.

We encourage an Amiga set-top consortium to be formed immediately.  We
believe a minimum base case design including encryption technology, if
possible would be supported by consortium members.  Since this platform is
destined for world markets, a software rating mechanism would include
parental lockout of adult features and include reviews, top sellers, etc.
This standard must be in place in a similar fashion to that of the movie
and music industry, thereby freeing the software development community to
treat it as a guaranteed publishing platform with secure distribution of
content and payment.  This device which many of us will build in various

Conclusion
Manfred Schmidt - Escom AG

Ladies and gentlemen, So I hope that you got a more precise view of
what the future of ESCOM and Amiga will be. I think that we all have
the same motivations : We want the Amiga to succeed again as it did in
the past, we want it to be recognised as an important player in the
personal computer industry and we want it to be an interesting
alternative to other systems.

The market like the concept and the elegance of the Amiga and for us,
Amiga is now our platform of choice, our business.

A new company has now seen the light of day.  This is an Amiga company,
our people know what they have to do because they all have a deep
knowledge and passion for the system they are working for.  They also
won't repeat the errors that have been made in the past.

Since the liquidation of Commodore, this has been the first official Amiga
press conference.  To allow a close cooperation with the Amiga Press,
Amiga Technologies has its own Press and PR department, led by your new
person of contact who I'd like to introduce to you : Mr Gilles Bourdin.

This conference is now over.  I would like to thank you again for showing
your interest, especially for those who had a long way to come.  There is
a showroom next door to this one where you can have a look at some of the
many application fields the Amiga covers.  In the meantime, before dinner,

@node REVIEW1 "Da Capo CD-ROM Volume 1"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
              REVIEW: DANNY AMOR'S "DA CAPO" CD-ROM VOLUME 1
  Kane Peterson                                             kanep@mcs.com
===========================================================================

Da Capo is a 575 megabyte collection of music modules (mods), instruments
and other music programs and utilities for the Amiga.  "So what?", you
might ask, "There are plenty of other CD-roms available that have similar
programs and content." There are a few things that stand Da Capo apart
from these other CD collections.

First, Da Capo is designed for Amiga users.  It has icons for all the
programs contained on it, so everything can be clicked on from Workbench.
The windows are positioned to appear at the correct size to hold all their
contents.

Second, it contains ready to run programs on the CD.  It encompasses every
music editor, mod-player, and music utility that I know about on the
Amiga.  Programs to note are: a full version of OctaMED 4 (mod editor),
AmiSOX (sound converter utility), Play16 (WAVE, AIFF and AU sound player),
DSound (IFF-8SVX sound player), and EaglePlayer (mod player).  Also
included are Workbench 3.x datatypes (AIFF, AU, VOC and WAVE) for
supporting audio formats on other platforms, a demo version of OctaMED
v6.0, and various audio CD-Rom players.

Also on Da Capo are directories of instrument files already converted into
IFF, WAVE, AIFF, VOC and AU format.  For all formats you will find samples
of drums, guitars, speech, fx and more.  According to the author, there
are over 2,000 instrument samples in each sound format.

If you are like me, the music that is included on Da Capo is of most
interest to you.  This, I am happy to report, is what I liked most about
Da Capo.  I have listened to other mod CD collections like: 'The Ultimate
MOD Collection', 'Town of Tunes' and mods on the 'Aminet' CDs, however, my
largest criticism with these collections is that most of the mods fall
under the 'techno' music category.  That is, songs with just a heavy beat
and a bunch of speech samples strung together.  I'm not trying to pick on
this music style (I, in fact, like techno music), but I find many of these
mods to be boring and unoriginal.  Da Capo has seem to step away from this
and offer a more complete range of music.  I have only listened to a small
percentage of the 1,400+ mods on the disk, but many of them I have liked
so far.  Already, I can tell that there has been more music on this CD
alone that I like, than what I have found on the other mod collections
that I have listened to.

Lastly, as extra added bonus to this CD, a real audio track with the song
"I Love You" by Gabriel Seher is included on the disc.  You can pop Da
Capo into your compact disc player and listen to it as well.

Da Capo gets a definite thumbs up!

PRICE:  I paid US$70, this includes $5 S&H and a $5 C.O.D. charge.

                            
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Any Amiga with a hard drive and running at least
Workbench 2.x can use Directory Opus 5 (DOpus 5).  I would recommend at
least 1 MB of free FAST RAM to operate this program.

SYSTEM TESTED ON: Amiga 2000 (Rev 4.4), ECS chip set, GForce '030
                  accelerator @ 50 MHz., 2 MB CHIP + 8 MB FAST memory,
                  Quantum LPS270S hard drive with Trumpcard Professional
                  controller, Picasso II RTG board, Workbench 3.1

PACKAGING: The DOpus 5 package consisted of a shrink wrapped, 174 page,
spiral bound manual with 1 floppy disk inside.

INSTALLATION: DOpus 5 uses the standard Commodore installer utility, so,
as usual, installation is a breeze.  Upon launching the installer, you are
presented with several choices of install methods: Start DOpus 5 on boot,
Start DOpus 5 iconified, Use DOpus 5 as Workbench replacement, and Don't
start DOpus 5 on boot.  All of these are self-explanatory, except use
DOpus 5 as Workbench replacement.  If you choose to use DOpus 5 as a
Workbench replacement, your LoadWB command will be renamed and a startup
file for DOpus 5 will be put in its place.   After selecting one of the
install options for DOpus 5 the script creates a DOpus 5 drawer on the
hard drive partition you selected and copies the appropriate files there.
Finally, an assign line is added to your User-Startup script.   One final
note, if you are using a ROM switcher and you have renamed the original
Startup-Sequence then you must rename the original Startup-Sequence so
that the DOpus 5 install script can find it; otherwise, you will get an
error and have to abort the install.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: If you are use to the look and feel of DOpus 4.x then
you will immediately notice that DOpus 5 is a complete rewrite of its
predecessors.  The interface is almost completely new and fresh.  DOpus 5
opens its own screen, of your choice, which strongly resembles a Workbench
2.x+ screen (a backdrop picture can even be used!) Most of the same
pulldown menu choices are present with several DOpus 5-specific additions.
Icons for all devices appear just as on Workbench.  I had icons for my
Boot and Work partitions, as well as the RAM Disk appeared on the main
screen with the initial startup of DOpus 5.  Also, a floating palette of
buttons for performing various tasks and a RAM Disk Lister appeared on the
screen.  At this point, you are ready to go!  My honest first impression
was, this looks confusing!

DOWN TO BRASS TACKS: Upon exploring the new features and look of DOpus 5 I
quickly realized just how powerful this version is.  The confusion I felt
with my first look at the new utility quickly faded as I began to use it.

     You can click on any of the device icons that appear on the screen
and open a floating Lister window.  Each Lister window has a Title Bar
which displays the device name and the amount of free space left on that
particular device.  Directly below the Title Bar is a Status Bar which
displays: the number of selected directories out of the total number of
directories displayed, the number of selected files out of the total
number of files displayed, and the number of bytes selected out of the
total number of bytes displayed.  To the immediate right of these are the
Lister Command Menu and the Device Gadget.  These allow you to perform
various actions on the selected files from a pulldown menu, as well as
directory manipulations.  The final item on this line is the Status Gadget
which displays the state that the Lister is in i.e.  SOURCE, DESTINATION,
or OFF.  You can change the state by clicking within the Status Bar.  The
last area before the actual file listings is the Lister Tool Bar which is
full of various icon presentations for file and directory manipulation.
The icons are: DeviceList/CacheList, Parent/Root, All/None, Select/Toggle,
MakeDir, Copy/CopyAs, Move/MoveAs, ReName, Delete, Show, Play, Protect,
Comment, and DateStamp.  The icons of the Tool Bar are accessed by the
left and right mouse buttons, also actions may be assigned to the middle
mouse button.  The Tool Bar can be customized any way you like, including
the addition and subtraction of icons.

     The area of the Lister that actually shows the files and directories
of the selected device can be customized as well.  You can select the
order in which the items are sorted and what part of the file's attributes
are used for the sort order.  The Lister's display can also contain as
much information or as little as you desire.  At the bottom of the Lister
is a window where the complete path is shown.  You can manually type a new
path if you so desire.  Maneuvering around in the Lister window can be
accomplished by: holding the right mouse button down and moving the mouse
pointer up/down/left/right (the listing will scroll to follow the mouse

OTHER FEATURES:

* Full Drag and Drop support for highlighting directories or files and
then dropping them in another Lister to be copied or unarchived etc.  You
can also just drag these directories or files outside of the Lister and
drop them on the main screen for easy access. 

* The middle mouse button has full support for a wide range of functions
associated with Buttons and Tool Bar icons, providing you aren't using a
Commodity such as MultiCX which enables the middle mouse button for
switching between screens. 

* Floating button bars make it easy to customize your DOpus 5 layout with
only the most needed functions which aren't supported, or conveniently
accessed, by an icon on the Tool Bar or a menu choice in the User menu. 

* ARexx support. 

* Data Type support.

* The mouse pointer sensitive help function will pull up an Amigaguide
document specific to the item you are pointing at when pressing the HELP
key.

* Enhanced Search requestor which supports simple and complex searches.

* Enhanced Pattern Matching which supports simple and complex searches.

* The ability to change the DateStamp of any file or directory.

* Your old DOpus 4 configuration can be imported into DOpus 5.  The look
of DOpus 5 will change to look just like the old familiar DOpus 4 if you
choose to do so.  Frankly, this defeats the purpose and power of the new
DOpus 5.  I don't recommend it.

DISLIKES & BUGS:  I miss the CPU usage display on the main title bar. 
     The ability to set a window close delay has been removed.  This means
that you have to either add a close gadget to any window that shows output
from a DOpus 5 function i.e.  LHA dearchiving etc., or add an AmigaDOS
WAIT command to that particular function's activity.  It was easier to
just set the close delay under DOpus 4.  When selecting a Backdrop for use
on the DOpus 5 main screen, you must select the desired image from within
your Prefs/WBPattern requestor and then use SaveAs.  If you just select
any old image from the DOpus 5 Backdrop requestor, it won't work. 

     You have to type in a lengthy registration number that locks the copy
of DOpus 5 on to the hard drive to which it was installed.  If you copy
the program to another drive or use a hard drive defragmenter (ReOrg
etc.), you have to reregister the program by typing in the registration
number again!

     I have experienced crashes when working with DOpus 5 with my Picasso
II board and Workbench 3.1 setup.  Closing the Button Paint Palette with
its close gadget will cause a GURU every time on my system.

SUMMARY: Directory Opus 5 is very powerful.  It offers a fully
multi-threaded, internally multitasking suite of programs.  You can have
multiple destination Listers open and be copying files etc.  to each
destination Lister from the source, formatting multiple floppies,
unarchiving or archivng files, editing files, etc.  -- all at the same
time!  Any of these individual tasks can be aborted without affecting any
of the other tasks which are running concurrently. 

     DOpus 5 offers a fresh new look and a functionality heretofore
unheard of on the Amiga platform.  The author is easily contacted via
Email and he replies promptly, usually within one day.  I strongly
recommend that any power user of the Amiga get this program -- it's well
worth it.

                REVIEW: A LOOK AT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PNG
  Andy Dean                                       adean@eleceng.ucl.ac.uk
===========================================================================

[Well, it's mostly review.  It's part plug, since the author of the
article also wrote Image Studio, but hey...-Jason]

Dear Jason,

After reading the excellent article on GIF/PNG by Michael Console
Battilana in AmigaReport 3.11, I thought you may be interested in the
following article.  We've recently added PNG support to ImageStudio and
I've had a chance to test the new file format's performance against
existing formats.  I'd be delighted if you would consider the following
article for inclusion in AmigaReport, it will of interest to anyone who
deals with bitmap images.

        All the best,

                Andy Dean

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the start of 1995 the GIF file format was the centre of attention when
it was revealed that the LZW compression algorithm used for its data
compression was under patent from Unisys.  This meant that authors of
commercial and shareware software that wrote GIF files were required to
pay Unisys (or Compuserve, the designer of the GIF format) royalties for
every copy of their software sold.

This was deemed unacceptable by many users of GIF and so suggestions were
put forward as to the creation of a royalty-free replacement for the GIF
format.  A few ideas have been suggested, but the most complete solution
to date is the new PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file format.

PNG takes the following features from GIF:

        o Storage of palette based images of up to 256 colours.
        o Interlaced redraw for quick display on World Wide Web
          browsers.
        o Transparent colour, allowing for non-rectangular images.
        o Powerful lossless compression algorithm.
        o Extendable for future expansion.

and adds the following abilities:

        o Full colour images up to 48bits per pixel.
        o Full alpha channel.
        o Image pre/post filtering to further aid compression.
        o More levels of interlacing for faster display.

The full PNG specification has not yet been released (it is up to the
tenth draft at the time of writing), but already a PNG support library is
being written to aid software authors in loading and saving PNG files from
within their programs.

As the co-author of the Amiga shareware image processing program
"ImageStudio", I was very interested in this new format.  So with the
pre-release version of the PNG support library, the tenth draft of the PNG
specs and the trusty SAS/C debugger at the ready, I wrote a PNG module for
ImageStudio.

My aims were to find out exactly what PNG could be useful for.  I was
interested in:

        o How fast PNG files were to load and save.
        o How large a PNG file is compared to other popular formats.

I tested the PNG module with 3 images:

        "Bud"         - 256 colour, 640x806 scanned image of a Budweiser
                        advert.
        "Colourface"  - 24bit, 574x815 scanned image of a woman's face.
        "Williams"    - 24bit, 640x480 raytraced image of a Williams
                        Formula1 grand prix car.

With such a small number of images it is difficult to represent all types
of image, but they represent perhaps the most popular types of image that
are found in the 256 colour and 24bit formats.

The results of load/save times and file size are given below:

Image    Format         Load time       Save time       File size
-----    ------         ---------       ---------       ---------

         LHA(1)         2s              19s             175K


Notes:  o The computer used for all the tests was an Amiga 4000/030
        with 10MB of RAM and a 25MHz 68030.

        o The software used to load and save the images was
        ImageStudio v2.1.1 (68020+ version).

        (1) LHA is not an image file format. These values are the
        results of taking the IFF-ILBM and compressing it with LHA
        v1.38. The load time is the time taken to decompress the file,
        the save time is the compression time. This operation is a
        typical method of storing files to reduce their size.

        (2) The JPEGs were saved with a quality setting of 85. JPEG
        uses lossy compression, so information was lost over the original
        24bit images; this explains JPEG's ability to create much
        smaller files than any of the other formats.

        (3) The TIFF-LZW files were loaded/saved by ImageFX v1.52 as
        ImageStudio cannot use TIFF-LZW yet.

The colour mapped "Bud" image showed the least of the improvements in
compression, but it was still significantly smaller than any of the other
formats.  When you're paying per kilobyte of file downloaded, any
reduction in file size is welcome.

It is the 24bit images where PNG excels.  In both the scanned "Colourface"
and raytraced "Williams" images, the PNG image was almost half the size of
the nearest lossless format.  JPEG still creates the smallest files, but
at the cost of losing some of the image information.  In the case of the
"Colourface" image, the loss of information was almost imperceptible.
With the clean raytraced "Williams" image however, the JPEG artifacts were
quite noticible.

I'll leave it up to the individual to decided whether PNG looks like a
useful format for their own use.  As all the PNG images were smaller than
the other lossless formats it seems a good idea to consider PNG for
storing files for archiving in all cases.  Using JPEG to store scanned
24bit images is possible, but for storing computer generated images (from
a raytracer, landscape generator or fractal program) the need for lossless
compression is paramount.

At the moment the creation of PNG files is substantially slower than with
the other formats.  This again suggests that PNG files lend themselves to
applications where they are compressed once and read many times.

The ImageStudio PNG module used for these tests is now released on Aminet
as:

        gfx/conv ImageStudioPNG.lha

The code is based on a pre-release v0.6 of the PNG library and so should
still be considered "work in progress".  The PNG library loads the
majority of the PNG files I've come across and saves PNG files correctly,
including support for interlacing and a transparent colour.  The above
archive contains both 68000 and 68020+ versions of the PNG module.
Unregistered users of ImageStudio will find that PNG files loaded with the
module will be clipped to 512x512, registered users will have a fully
functional module.  The module will be uploaded on the 7th of June 1995 so
please give it a couple of days to propagate around the Aminet network.

PNG is currently supported by both "ImageStudio" and Cloanto's "Personal
Paint v6.3" on the Amiga, but as PNG becomes more popular I guess the
format will be supported by many more packages.

For more information on the GIF saga, I suggest reading Michael Console
Battilana's article in AmigaReport 3.11. 

Excerpts are taken from the PNG specification, tenth draft.

DESCRIPTION

A fast action game of skill...

Principle of this game is to guide a rolling ball as fast as possible
along a long and tricky track in space, to avoid the holes and gaps or
jump over them, and to get as many points as possible in the end (what
else?).  Many extra fields with special effects can make this task easier
or much more difficult.

Included are nine levels, starting "very easy" and ending "utterly
difficult".

With the integrated level editor you can change levels or create your own
levels.  This is also possible with the freely distributable version, but
you can't save levels to disk from this version.  For proper use, you
should decide to register and pay the shareware fee.  With the registered
full version you can design as many sets of each nine levels as you like
and save them to disk.  For each level set separate highscores (incl.
highscore game play for automatic replay mode) are saved.

The ball can be controlled by joystick or keyboard.

DESCRIPTION

An animation, framegrabbing, handyscanner and Blue Screen effect software
for the EGS graphical environment.

This software enables all EGS users (e.g.  users of the typical EGS
graphic boards as Piccolo, Piccolo-SD64, EGS-Spectrum, EGS-110, ...) to
create and edit animations direct on harddisk, grab pictures and sequences
from several framegrabbers, access some handyscanners or apply the Blue
screen effect to pictures/sequences.

     Supported framegrabbers:

     1) VLab (std., Y/C and parallelport versions of MacroSystems framegrabber)
     2) IV24 (GVPs Impact Vision)
     3) VideoCruncher (Ing.buero Helfrich)

Single or multiple frames can be grabbed from such framegrabbers and
combined with loaded frames into sequences/animations on harddisk.

     Supported handyscanners:

     1) Cameron (black&white and greyscale)
     2) Reisware (black&white and greyscale)
     3) ScanKing (black&white and greyscale)

As scanner interfaces only Cameron and Reisware interfaces are supported.

For animation creation or extension pictures or whole directories of
pictures can be imported in the following file formats:

     1) IFF-ILBM (1 to 24Bit incl. HAM6/HAM8)
     2) JPeg (color and greyscale)
     3) PPM/PGM/PBM (P1&P4 b&w, P5 grey, P6 color)
     4) QRT (also known as dump format by PD raytracers as POV-Ray)
     5) Targa
     6) PCX
     7) BMP (uncompressed)
     8) TIF (packbit-compr./uncompr.)
     9) EGS7.x window icons
     10) DEEP
     11) YUV
     12) VLAB raw
     13) RGB
     14) HHsYUVSq sequence format
     15) IFF-PBM (DPII)
     16) ACBM
     17) FBM
     18) Sun raster (uncompressed)
     19) MacPaint (b&w compressed 1Bit format; datafork only)
     20) HHsXRL formats

The additional DataType support extends this list by many formats;
DataTypes can e.g.  be found on Aminet in util/DType.

Pictures can be downscaled during import.

Animations/sequences can be edited directly on harddisk: new frames can be
inserted/appended and frames can be deleted.  Frames can also be directly
imported from ImageFX or ImageFX-EGS.

Frames can be directly exported to ImageFX, ImageFX-EGS, PicoPainter,
ArtEffect, XiPaint, TVPaint or to Clipboard.

Saving of individual frames is also possible in several formats (e.g.
JPeg, IFF-ILBM24, ...).

Animations can be played back at selectable speeds forward and backward.

The Blue Screen keying effect allows the conbination of several image
sources into one picture.  This can e.g.  be used to combine a picture
from framegrabber with some blue background with another background
picture, so that the blue background is replaced.  The colour range can be
selected by several parameters.

NEW FEATURES

New since V5.0: Support for VideoCruncher

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

OS2.04 required, OS3.0/3.1 reccomended (needed for DataType support)

AUTHOR

Dirk Federlein

UUCP:   dirkf@alcmy.franken.de (prefered!)

Fido:   2:244/6302.12


DESCRIPTION

The DFA datatype can be used to view DFA created database files using
tools like Multiview.  Additionally, it is possible to print customized
address lists using this datatype and Multiview (for example)

The display format can be customized, i.e.  you can tell the datatype
which fields of the address database you want to get displayed.

This datatype can read all DFA address database formats from version 1.0
to version 2.25 of DFA!

DFA is the definite address database tool.  It supplies a very nice GUI, a
powerful Arexx port, a flexible client server mechanism and much more.  It
is simply the ideal mean to manage several or many addresses for the
beginner as well as for the professional Amiga user.

This is version 39.1. Freeware, C-source included.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

Requires Amiga-OS 3.0 (V39).  Runs on all Amiga computers (500+, 600,
1200, 3000, 4000) with this OS (or a newer one) installed.

AUTHOR

SASG  (Standardized Amiga Shareware Group)

DESCRIPTION

This is the official all-in-one information program about the SASG, its
goals, services, up-to-date information about all available shareware
products (i.e.  new SASG releases, updates etc.) and it also includes the
favorite automated registration generator which makes the whole
registration process a piece of cake.

So, if you are interested in shareware products like MUI, DFA, MagicCX or
MagicWB, if you would like to find out your nearest located registration
site to be sure to get the benefits of a national treatment (shorter
waits, own currency supported, local support etc.), and if you never
registered shareware because of all the fuss and complication involved:
Get this program!

By the ease of a few mouse clicks the program will generate your personal
registration form with all necessary data (like the receiver's address
etc.).  This is the easiest way to support the author of your favorite
product and get the most out of your money through the quality assurance
and services of the SASG.

The SASG is a group of well-known shareware authors whose goal is to offer
high quality shareware products at a reasonable (standardized, i.e.  US$
20.00) price on a high value-for-money basis.

The SASG has achieved a well-established infrastructure for the
registration process by installing several official registration sites all
over the world (accepting a variety of currencies) and ensuring that you
receive your registered product as fast as possible.

At the same time the SASG is a non-profit organization which was founded
by shareware authors themselves to ensure that 100% of your money will
reach the specific author.  This has made the low and standardized price
of US$ 20.00 possible since no other persons than the author himself
profits from your support.

You may find all further information in the program itself.

NEW FEATURES

- New SASG product versions available
- Improved printer support
- New registration sites included
- New payment methods & currencies included
- Improved layout
- String gadgets now retain the user's data even when the
  language is switched while being used
- Improved MagicWB color support
- All known bugs removed
- Special joke implemented :)

     20) HHsXRL formats
     21) PhotoCD (Base format 768x512 or 512x768 (portrait))

The additional DataType support extends this list by many formats;
DataTypes can e.g.  be found on Aminet in util/DType.

Small (thumbnail) representations of all pictures in a directory or
directory tree are shown very fast.  You can then select pictures for
viewing in multiple full size windows including fast scrolling and zooming
functions.  You can also present selected pictures in a Slideshow
presentation mode including transition effects.  Pictures can also be
directly transfered to ImageFX, ImageFX-EGS, PicoPainter, ArtEffect,
XiPaint or to the Clipboard.  Saving is possible in several 24Bit formats
including JPeg, IFF24 and more.

For faster access you can also save downscaled representations of the
images.  You can view and change the file comment of pictures directly and
also delete pictures in a comfortable way.

There are different versions available:

    - A simple ASCII version, printing the complete chessboard
      with ASCII characters after each move.
    - A Curses version, similar to the ASCII version, but with the
      ability to move the cursor.
    - An AmyBoard client; AmyBoard is a frontend, which allows you
      to play with the mouse on a beautiful chessboard.

    Some tools for analyzing a chess game and postsript output are
    included.

DESCRIPTION

     DFA is the definite address database utility for you and the 
     Amiga computer.

     DFA manages your email addresses, allows direct dialing of
     the stored phone numbers, grouping of addresses, different 
     types of printing addresses, online help, application 
     icon/window and much more!

     DFA has an Arexx port, font sensitive windows and can be fully
     directed by keyboard. Native languages are supported as soon
     as Workbench 2.1 (and above) is installed.

     Nearly every aspect of DFA is customizable, so you may
     configure "your own" DFA.

     This is version 2.25, a minor update to version 2.2.

     DFA is an SASG product! Shareware, binary only.


NEW FEATURES (since v2.2)

     QuickSearch function for the DFAEditor main window.

     Improved mapping function for the MagicWB images.

     Several bug fixes.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     DFA needs at least Kickstart/Workbench 2.04 to run.

     It takes advantage of the new features included in version 2.1
     (Locale  support)  and  uses even some features coming with OS
     3.0 if available.

     DFA is made to run on all systems, starting with the A500+
     and ending up with the A4000(T).

     More than 512KB of RAM and a harddisk are recommended.

DESCRIPTION

    AmyBoard is a graphical chessboard, that can serve as a user
    interface for GNU Chess, for the ICS (Internet Chess Server) and
    for itself as a PGN (Portable Game Notation) file editor. The
    original xboard can also be used for electronic mail
    correspondence chess, but this possibility is not yet integrated
    into AmyBoard, as this requires cmail, which is a Perl script.

    As an interface to GNU Chess, AmyBoard lets you play a game
    against the machine, set up arbitrary positions, force variations,
    or watch a game between two machines.

    As an interface to the Internet Chess Server (ICS), AmyBoard
    lets you play against other ICS users, observe games they are
    playing, or review games that have recently finished.

    You can also use AmyBoard as a chessboard to play through games.
    It will read and write game files and allow you to play through
    variations manually. You can use it to browse games off the net
    or review GNU Chess, ICS, and correspondence games you have saved.
    These features are available at all times; even if you do not have
    access to GNU Chess or the ICS.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    AmigaOS version 2.0 or later
    MUI version 2.0 or later (available on Aminet, dev/gui)
    Installer (available on Aminet, util/misc)

    To play against GNU Chess you need the gnuchess package
        (available on Aminet, game/board)

    To connect to the ICS, you need Internet access, either by

    - a standard telnet program using stdin/stdout, for example
      AmiTCP/IP's telnet or
        - a terminal program using stdin/stdout, for example IPDial
      (available on Aminet, comm/tcp)

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to jcompton@bbs.xnet.com and in the body of the
message ask nicely to be added to the list.

ie: Please add me to the mailing list for Amiga Report magazine.  My
     addresss is <your net address>.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **

To circumvent the new pay-per-megabyte system for Australian Internet
communication, Paul Reece has been kind enough to set up an AUSTRALIAN-ONLY
mailing list, to save his fellow countrymen some money.

You can join the list by sending mail to:   majordomo@info.tas.gov.au

==                        UUDecoding Amiga Report                        ==
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

==                    Amiga Report Writing Guidelines                    ==
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.  Please stipulate as
well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to the editor.

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
          -------------------------------------------------------

Portal is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-service online SIG
(Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users. We promise, and
WE DELIVER ongoing & aggressive Amiga support!

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in many ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA high-speed modems (you pay for the phone call
if it's not local), or though any SprintNet or Compu$erve indial anywhere
(with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell service!  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help, and you can easily customize
it for your favorite terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1000 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
      once, of any size, with one command.
 * Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, Elastic
      Reality (ASDG), Soft-Logik, Apex Publishing, and others.
 * 40 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 10,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.
 * Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
      related and get quick replies from the experts.
 * Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, AMosaic, LightWave, EGS,
      OpalVision & others feed right into the Zone message bases.  Read
      months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

 * A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.
      You can run Amiga Mosaic through your shell and explore the
      vast World Wide Web!

      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine.
 * Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
      never worry "Ooops... Am I paying for this area?" again!
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  And you get FREE unlimited
      usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
      email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
 * Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
      at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
