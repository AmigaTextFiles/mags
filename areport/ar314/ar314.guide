It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...

It seems like what should be our greatest assets are our greatest
detriments.

Take, for example, the horrifying distribution of AR 3.13.  It totally
overloaded the listserv.  Some people got 80 copies, others got none.
Those that DID get it who didn't have OS 3.x ran into a slight problem
because we made an AmigaGuide error that only affects pre-3.0 AmigaGuide
(BTW, guys, delete line 1991.  It'll work then.)  We're returning to the
manual-script method of distribution.  Hey, it's slower, but it's less
hassle for readers.

And then there's Amiga Technologies.  What was originally cause for great
rejoicing is now sending some Amiga users packing.  Not everyone is pleased
with the strategic decisions and marketing plans the company has laid out.

Still, all hope is not lost.  Amiga Technologies has shown they will
listen to a mass user revolt.  The force of negative energy that responded
to the projected US$3500 price of the 4000T brought the company to hold a
distribution conference, and the new price, reported in a dealer letter
sent out by CEI, is roughly $2700.

Certainly, nothing to write home about.  Still uncompetitive in the home
computer market.  But it's an improvement.  And if Amiga users can continue
to join together to make good things happen-then the fight is never over.
Take AmiJAM '95 and the upcoming Amiga Convention '95.  Two grassroots
organizations putting on shows.  Of course, it would be great to have a
parent company willing to organize such events, but for now, we'll live.

Make no mistake, though.  The clock on Amiga Technologies' borrowed time is
ticking, and that time is running out rapidly.  We need a bonanza.  We need
an event.  Amiga Technologies MUST show the Amiga community, and the world,
that they will be a serious player in the world of computing for the rest
of this century and beyond.  Everyone else is vying to make this statement.
It's do or die time.

Jason  

P.S. For those who didn't get AR 3.13 and would still like to get a hold of
it, any Aminet site will carry it in the directory pub/aminet/docs/mags.
If you do not have direct FTP access, there is an excellent FTP-Mail server
on src.doc.ic.ac.uk.  To use it, send mail to ftpmail@src.doc.ic.ac.uk and
ask for HELP.  (This site is also an Aminet mirror site, making it doubly
convenient.)

RE: Magic Workbench 2.0 Review --

For all those Magic Workbench 2.0 users who would like to see the special
boot screen every time the Amiga is turned on, here's how you do it:

Find the line in your startup-sequence (and user-startup if you'd like)
that says:

    RUN >NIL:  C:MagicWB-Demon 4,123,123,123....; Don't remove this line!

and add the word "XEN" right before all of the numbers like this:

    RUN >NIL:  C:MagicWB-Demon XEN 4,123,123....; Don't remove this line!

Special thanks to the following people for writing in to tell me how to use
this feature:

Amiga developper brainstorming in Heppenheim, Germany.

Bensheim, 18/07/95

On the 7th of July, Amiga Technologies invited all main hardware and
software development companies in Germany to a brainstroming meeting in
Heppenheim.  Manfred Schmitt, chairman of the board at ESCOM AG and Petro
Tyschtschenko, General Manager at Amiga Technologies used the opportunity
to present the new Amiga daughtercompany of ESCOM and the plans for the
future to the attendance.

The main discussion topics were about the development of the actual product
range in the future.  Amiga Technologies wants to build up tight
cooperations with the most successfull development companies worldwide.
"There is a high potential for development from third party and we want
this people to be on our side and to work with us", says Manfred Schmitt.

During the meeting, the Amiga Technologies staff and the developpers could
exchange their views and plans on the future of the Amiga.  The use of
Amiga technology in the set-top-boxes market as well as the migration
towards new generation models were also discussed topics.

In August, Amiga Technologies will also hold a conference for the press,
the developpers and the dealers in London.

A new Logo for the Amiga.

The Amiga had its official rebirth on the 30th of May at the press
conference held in Frankfurt by Amiga Technologies and ESCOM.  Projects for
the future concerning company identity and new casing designs were
presented to the attendance.  The logo from Frogdesign has finally been
chosen.  It is a simple and elegant symbol that will from now on accompany
the Amiga and its fans.  Frogdesign states about the brand : "The Amiga
Wordmark evokes both a classic and elegant feel as well as modern look.
Bodoni, the font selected to build upon is a classic font.  Further
refinements involving the manipulation and substraction of serifs and the
addition of the red square create a progressive, yet elegant logo.  the red
square represents technology and adds energy to the logo by implying a
sense of motion."

Amiga Technologies distribution in the USA

There has recently been an announcement made by an american distributor
about a price for the Amiga 4000T of 3500 USD.

We would like to contradict this information as it has not come from one of
our official press releases.  There have been no firm distribution
contracts or agreements signed yet for northern America.

There has been no decision taken yet concerning the pricing of the Amiga
4000 T in the USA.

There will be a sales meeting in the USA next week where all american
dealers will be invited to discuss the market situation and future price
policy for the USA.  Petro Tyschtschenko, General Manager at Amiga
Technologies GmbH will conduct that meeting.

Manfred Schmitt, Chairman of the Board at ESCOM AG and Petro Tyschtschenko
will thereafter take the decision for the pricing of the Amiga 4000 T in
the USA.

Potential Amiga dealers are welcome to send in their applications for
becoming one of our distributors in Northern America.

In response to a few questions of late:

Yes, we are still alive!
Yes, we are still producing and supporting HyperCache.
Yes, it really should be built into the operating system :-)

Termite V1.10 Upgrade
Press Release

July 27, 1995

Oregon Research is proud to announce a major upgrade to Termite, a modern
Telecommunications package for the Amiga.  Some of the new features in
version 1.10 include:

o Built in ZMODEM protocol hand-optimized in assembly language for speed.

o Improved internal emulation.  The new internal ANSI emulator is
  optimized, robust, and has been extensively tested with the most complex
  ANSI screens we could find.  The new VT102 emulator is highly optimized
  and is ideal for use with UNIX or VMS dialup accounts.  Both of the
  built-in emulations have mouse-based cut-and-paste functionality.

o Jump scrolling.  Instead of scrolling the screen one line at a time,
  Termite monitors incoming serial data and scrolls up multiple lines at a
  time, for a huge speed increase.

o Multitasking review buffer.  The terminal and review buffer can be used
  simultaneously!

o Enhanced chat window.  The chat window now maintains a resizable
  "history" which keeps track of the text you have sent.  A single click on
  a line in the history brings it up for editing.  A double click on a
  history line instantly resends it.

o Predefined palettes.  The screen settings requester now provides buttons
  which allow you to switch between ANSI, RIP, and Termite default color
  palettes with the click of a button.

o Review buffer filter.  Optional filtering of ANSI codes out of the review

===========================================================================
                          AMIJAM '95 SHOW REPORT
                           By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

In mid-July, the Amiga Users of Calgary (AMUC from now on) held the first
North American Amiga show of this tumultuous year.  I was fortunate enough
not only to be at the show, but a part of it as well.

When the show organizers contacted me, asking me to give a couple of talks,
I was thrilled.  I was sold when I learned they'd pay to fly me out and
book my hotel stay.  I got to see a lot of Canada that day, flying from
Chicago to Vancouver to Kelowna to Edmonton to Calgary.

But the show was more important.  It was a two-day event, kicked off early
Saturday morning to a lined-up crowd outside the door.  Demonstrating and
hawking their wares at the show were Canadian dealer chain/distributor
Wonder Computers; Oregon Research, publishers of Termite and On the Ball
and distributors of several UK-based Amiga products including the Squirrel
PCMCIA SCSI interface; AmiTrix, an Edmonton-based Amiga engineering and
product distribution company, local dealers Software Supermart and The
Computer Shop, and Spots, a local Internet service provider with active
Amiga support.

These made up the main show floor.  Two rooms, one large auditorium and a
smaller, classroom environment, were used for presentations and seminars
that went on during the course of the show.  To fill the time, Dave Haynie,
Dale Larson, and I were brought out to give a pair of presentations each.
In addition, local experts on 3D rendering and Amiga programming got their
day in court, and Wonder's Steve Vetzal gave an Internet presentation.  For
my part, I gave a couple of talks on emulation-neither of which went as
well as I'd have liked, owing to difficulties in locating the right
hardware combinations for the software I brought.  I can't complain,
though.

Dave Haynie, former senior hardware engineer for Commodore, presently
employed in a similar capacity at Scala, launched the auditorium speech
series with a Scala-assisted talk on the history of the Amiga.  Nearly two
hours long, Dave kept the crowd interested non-stop, covering little-known
details and potholes in the development of key hardware products, complete
with a lesson on how to dodge FCC regulations.  Later, Haynie unveiled a
prototype motherboard for Nyx, the AAA development machine.  It was one of
the basis for his seminar on Amiga hardware.

Dale Larson, former Commodore networking software engineer and presently 
el Presidente of Intangible Assets Manufacturing, gave a small-room seminar
on Amiga networking (note: people had to pay to get into those small-room
seminars) and an auditorium talk with a basic theme of "Fun stuff to do
with an Amiga on the Internet." I made sure Amiga Report was mentioned at
least twice.

The show floor marched on through both days, regardless of who was talking
when.  Wonder sprawled across nearly a quarter of the show floor, with
software piled high off the tables.  Of particular note were the products
they were selling as a result of their buyout of the New Horizons "B" pack
of liquidation assets, most importantly DesignWorks, the structured drawing
package.  Wonder's sister company Lazarus Engineering had turned
DesignWorks into a 1.1 version, bringing it up to full 2.x/3.x OS
compliance.  Also being sold and shown was PowerManager, a drive
caching/screen blanking/power conservation package.  A week after the show,
Lazarus' head engineer, Steve Cockwell, informed me that a totally revamped
DesignWorks would be hitting the shelves soon with a new manual.  He also
informed me that PowerManager's future was uncertain-the product was
completed specifically for AmiJAM (the box sleeves were printed with the
designation "Special AmiJAM Version!") and Wonder has not committed to
mass-marketing the product.

Oregon Research, across the hall, had its entire product line on hand for
sale and display.  The long-awaited Termite 1.1 was available (and I walked
away with one for review).  Bob Luneski, president, didn't mention any new
upcoming products, but at least one, On the Ball, seems headed for
something of a refit.  We exchanged notes for a time, and I learned, among
other things, that the rights to the Atari ST have been sold to a German
company.  (Oregon Resarch also distributes products for that line of
computers and apparently does very well by it, particularly in dense
pockets of users in the music business in California.)

AmiTrix had the SCSI-TV, SCSI-570, and AmigaLink on display.  AmigaLink is
the floppy drive-port SANA-II compliant networking solution that AmiTrix
recently got distribution rights for.  SCSI-TV and SCSI-570 are original
products that bring a full SCSI interface to A570 and CDTV users via the
special expansion port on those units.

Software Supermart brought a bunch of software and sold a ton of it.

Spots was a great outlet for people who wanted to check their e-mail and
were far from home.  Unfortunately, I never got my turn.

The Computer Shop seemed to want to sell this Toaster 2000 system really
bad.  I don't think they ever did, though.

The AMUC crew held down the fort, trying to make sure all participants
registered (to get an accurate attendance figure), keeping the speakers and
presenters and table-holders happy, and raffling off donated prizes
(largely sent by companies who felt guilty about not attending).  AMUC also
organized an All Night Hacker's Party Saturday night and a post-show
banquet on Sunday.  I have no idea if the all night party really went all
night, but I have my doubts, since everyone looked pretty tired around
midnight.

The banquet was a chance to kick back, relax, and congratulate everyone for
actually pulling the show off successfully.  The food wasn't bad, either.

What was the general mood at the show?  Maybe that can best be felt through
the panel discussion held at the end of the Sunday events.  It consisted of
Brant Coghlan of AmiTrix, Dale Larson (who held a minor coup and became the
MC of the discussion), Dave Haynie, myself, and Steve Vetzal and Steve
Cockwell of Wonder.  "Strong concern" is the term.  People are strongly
concerned about the path Amiga Technologies is headed down-one with cloudy
skies and uninspiring decisions.  It seems clear that strong leadership
with populist motivation was the sort of thing Amiga users wanted and
needed, and they're not getting it, and it's making them uncomfortable.

Also discussed was what the panel would like to see for future development
of the Amiga line.  PowerPC was a virtually unanimous choice.  As Dave
Haynie put it, "it will be the only RISC chip with a chance to be priced as
a commodity item."

Was it a successful show?  Everyone has to make their own decisions on that
one.  AMUC wanted better attendance (it was a matter of hundreds-registered
attendees numbered somewhere around 300-400).  Of course, the dealers
wanted better attendance for more sales, although Software Supermart was
said to be "very happy" and Wonder was in a pretty good situation-with the
opening of Western Canada dealerships, much of the unsold inventory went
directly to the new stores.  I had a great time, got to put lots of faces
to what were previously just names and (rarely) voices, and even got Dave
Haynie to agree to do articles for Amiga Report and Amiga Report Tech
Journal.  I had a great time.

The Wild Side
-------------

Just a collection of anecdotes and stories, largely taken from the
non-AmiJAM action that weekend.

Friday night: After Dale and Dave finally arrived at our hotel suite, the
three of us, along with AMUC and AmiTrix members went out to Jezebel's, a
local bar and grill.  As the night wore on, just about everyone got worn
out, save Dave, who had consumed roughly 1.5 pitchers of Warthog beer.  As
a hint that maybe we should leave, Dale inquired, "What, does beer keep you
awake?!?!"

The Karaoke Chronicles: On Saturday, many of Friday night's veterans went
looking for a Karaoke bar.  After some 6 different bars all over Calgary,
we finally found one.  Dale Larson blew a fuse on the Karaoke equipment
about 1 minute into his rendition of "Wild Thing".  Undaunted, he went on
to restart the song, as well as sharing "Keep Your Hands to Yourself" and
"Bad to the Bone" with the crowd, much to the delight of the guys with
cowboy hats.  Other notable performances included my Karaoke debut of
"Stand", the Dale/Dave/Jason/Brant version of "Eat It", and an eventual
sextet of "Addicted To Love."

On Sunday, we got a bar all to ourselves for about 45 minutes before the
AmiJAM banquet.  This gave us more chances to look silly, including a
Dale/Dave/Jason performance of "Whip It" (we had tried on Saturday night
but they wouldn't let us), Dave's "Losing My Religion", and a tag-team
version of "Let It Be" (Dale decided after a minute and a half that it was
out of his range, so Dave took over.)

Food and Drink: According to Dale Larson, el Presidente of IAM, Jezebel's serves
one of the top 5 Zombie's he's ever had.

I spilled beer on AMUC member and Amiga game publisher Ken Pierce, which is
less exciting than it sounds.  It was just a wild gesture I made where he
happened to be holding his bottle.

Canadian Subway shops aren't as good as those in the US.  Still, it was fun
seeing a bag of Doritos in both English and French.

Here's looking forward to AmiJAM '96.

===========================================================================
              RESULTS OF THE ESCOM/U.S.  DISTRIBUTOR MEETING
           HELD IN PHILADELPHIA, PA USA ON FRIDAY JULY 21, 1995
  SHANE R.  MONROE                                       smonroe@awod.com
      REPRESENTING DARK UNICORN PRODUCTIONS AND BETTER CONCEPTS, INC
===========================================================================

NOTE: A NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT WAS ESTABLISHED AT THIS MEETING AND
THEREFORE CERTAIN ITEMS CANNOT BE DISCUSSED HERE.

This is Shane Monroe reporting on the conference held in Philly regarding
the distribution and pricing of the Amiga computer platform in the United
States.

I will organize this in several parts, so if there is a part that you are
not interested in you may skip over it by looking for the next header
flanked by asterisks.

                        ** WHO WAS THERE **

Those attending the conference are listed below.  The number of
representatives present is indicated by parenthesis.

Petro Tyschtschenko (1) - Senior Vice President Escom and General
                          Manager of Amiga Technologies.

Ed Goff (1) - Attorney, more or less leading the U.S. side of
              Amiga Technologies.  The man we have all grown to
              love over the last several months! ;)

Jeff (1; missed his last name) - Amiga Technologies' Engineer and
                                 the only one missing a tie.

Better Concepts, Inc. (3) - Hardware/Software dealer

Software Hut (3) - Hardware/Software dealer

Lively Computers (2) - Hardware/Software dealer

Micropace (1) - Hardware/Software dealer

Metropolitan Computers (1) - Hardware/Software dealer

CEI (2) - Hardware/Software/Misc. Amiga dealer/distributor

Centaur Development (2) - Makers of the Opalvision and the most
                          verbose people at the table.

Several companies that were invited didn't make it, according to Mr.  
Goff.  Most of the presentation was given by Petro with commentary by Ed
and Jeff.  Lively & Software Hut were very quiet for the most part, while
Alex Amor of CEI seemed to be the meeting referee to keep us on topic as
the day went on.  Micropace had quite a bit to say, as did Metropolitan.
The most input came from Centaur Development who spoke a great deal of the
time.  Better Concepts Inc (BCI) also had a lot to say and generated a lot
of comment (as well as I think a bit of hate and discontent!  ;)

                   ** WHAT WAS SAID (OVERVIEW) **

The meeting was really quite open ended, especially after lunch.   The
better part of the morning was taken with a very interesting overview of
ESCOM as well as a round-the-table introduction of everyone present.  A few
jokes passed, like some of my previous comments about him when Ed
introduced himself.

We then discussed configuration of the new Amiga 4000T and started talking
about everyone's favorite topic: price.  Petro solicited a price from the
attendee's and we talked a little about other Amiga 4000T related topics,
as well as other machine distribution.

We broke for lunch and returned to have Petro get to the meat of the
meeting and give the distributors a "how do you say it?  Bottom of the
line?" price of the machines.

We then discusses numbers of units the attendee's believed could be sold
and gave input in that general topic.

CEI made it VERY plain to this attendee that he was solely there for the
distribution information of the A4000T and really didn't care a lot about
the other topics and didn't want anyone not having some volume buying power
to be involved in the remainder of the meeting.   At that point,
distributors interested (and capable) in signing a distributor contract
made appointments to speak with Petro alone later.

This is where BCI's involvement ended at the meeting.  I doubt that any of
the distributors that stayed after this would be even SLIGHTLY interested
in discussing their end of the meeting, so this is more or less where the
meeting ended.

           ** THE AMIGA 4000T'S FUTURE IN THE U.S. **

I will bring this topic up first, since this seems to be the question on
everyone's lips.  Here are the common questions and the answers that *I AM
ALLOWED TO GIVE*.  None of these are falsehoods, but on the other hand are
as vague as I have to be to keep from breaking the NDA.

1. Will Amiga 4000T be available in the U.S. for sure?

A.  At this point, yes they will.  I think that the major point of this
meeting was to determine the very future of the machine in the U.S.  Based
on the response from the attendee's, I believe production will continue and
machines will indeed be available.

2. When will they be available?

A. The first week of September is what was said.

3. How many will be made?

A.  Unknown at this time.  I imagine that has a lot to do with how many the
distributors told Petro they could move.  Petro mentioned the number
20,000.  I believe that there will be a good deal ready to go by September.
Pre-sales will have a lot to do with it also, I bet.

4.  Will they be available to everyone or just video guru's and big
companies?

A.  The distributors seemed to have plans to sell them to any dealer who
wanted them, so companies like BCI, Software Hut, etc.  should be carrying
them.

5. How much!!!!?????

A.  The question on everyone's lips, isn't it?  It is also one of the very
few bits of information I cannot divulge.  The bottom of the truth is this.
Distributors and dealers will be determining the final costs.  Everyone at
the table was revealed the 'distributors price' for the A4000T (that is NOT
negotiable and volume will have no impact on).  Without disclosure, I can
tell you that every person at the table could *very easily* live with the
quoted price (and they were ALL really pissed at the $3500 tag too).  That
should help you a bit.  The street price, in my humble opinion, will be
under $3000 but I cannot be quoted.  It is out of everyone but the
distributor's hands.

6. Specifications???

A.  Another big question.  Here is the layout.  A4000T with an 040 or 060
processor, 512 MB or gig drive (this changed throughout the day, so I never
got it quite right - assume it is a half gig), with 6 megs of RAM.
Basically, what we already knew.

7.  Is the bottle-necked memory handling of the original A4000 still there?

A.  Unfortunately so.  However, it was my impression that the 060 board
would rectify that problem.

8. Who is making the 060 card?  Is it a Cyberstorm?

A. This was not disclosed to the group and no one asked.

9.  Is it the machine we are seeing on the Internet and in the latest
Amazing Computing?

A.  No sir.  The machine that is going around in picture is what I would
call an Artist's Rendition and it is NOT what the machine actually looks
like.  Apparently the real machine is in a converted PC tower case.  The
interesting thing I heard was that the turbo button normally used for the
PC is now an audio cutout switch.

10.  Why the hell is this machine costing more now than an A4000 did at the
end of the Commodore reign?

A.  This is the answer we got over and over again.  This is also the answer
to the 'why are the CD32s sitting in Philly being sold for $400?' question.
The parts being put together just cost that much.   This is what Jeff and
Ed continued to tell us (mainly BCI who just can't believe it still) about
the price tag.  Apparently they are going into the old Phillipean factory
and pulling certain parts off the motherboards for the newer model.  Price,
I suspect, will go down after the first 6-12 months or so, when the ramp up
costs are paid, etc.

11. Where are they being made?

A.  They are all being made and assembled here in the U.S.  As of now, the
European market is not interested in the machine and Petro says that there
are no orders placed there for the A4000T.  If the machine IS brought in to
Europe, they will be made in U.S.A.  and assembled in Europe.

GENERAL INFO

The feeling I got was that the entire party was mainly interested in
getting A4000T's to the people who already own Amigas and want more power
or for existing Amiga 4000s who need the space.  The primary reason for
this feeling is that there are to be ZERO dollars spent on advertising in
the U.S.  by ESCOM/AT.  Absolutely none.  This was said by Petro himself. 
If this doesn't scare you, it should.   However, NONE of the rest of the
attendees other than BCI seemed to give a single care to this lack of
marketing.  Jeff even said that there was no way we could possibly take on
the PC market.  Pretty bad when your own engineer says there is no chance.
This leads me to believe that the Amiga platform in the U.S.  will remain a
very isolated and unrespected niche market and once the demand is filled
for immediate needs, that the market here will simply die.  I could be
wrong but that is how I see it.

All attempts by myself and BCI to improve the machine's configuration to
bring it to the 90's failed.  The addition of even a cheap 2x speed CD-ROM
STANDARDIZED into the Amiga 4000T failed miserably.  I don't understand why
these guys aren't interested in entering the 90's generation.  Adding the
equipment as an addition later won't demonstrate a commitment to the
machine's future.   Again, my humble opinion.

                           ** THE A1200 **

This meeting was directed mainly at the A4000T in U.S.A.  but at the same
time, we have a lot of info here for you on the A1200 as well.   Again, we
will put it in Q&A form.

1. Is the U.S. going to get A1200s?

A.  This was the most infuriating part of the conference.  Ed said "There
is no market in the U.S.  for A1200s".  Jeff and seemingly Petro seemed to
agree.  To this, BCI told all of them they needed to come to our offices
and answer the phone for about a week and then tell us again that there is
no market.  This wasn't well received.   In any event, there are no plans
to bring this machine to the U.S.   Ed assured us that if we needed
machines we could get them, but the overall impression was that there is
not going to be anything done with it here.  Sad.

2. Are there any new specs for the A1200?

A.  Well, we all got to look at the new tech sheets (which was neat), but
alas, there were all in German.  My poor German seemed to tell me that the
machine was the same configuration as before.

3. How many are to be made?

A.  The number of 100,000 was put out.  40,000 of which have ALREADY been
sold (to whom was not revealed).  Basically, it is assumed that 30,000 or
so are for Germany, 30-40,000 for U.K., and 10,000 for Italy.

4.  Where are they being built?

A.  This will likely be new news for most of you.  They are being made in a
factory near Bordeaux, France.  The company who owns it, SELECTRON (if I
understood his pronunciation) is a U.S.  based company that has factories
all over the world.  Interesting note is that this factory also makes
Silicon Graphics workstations too, as well as lots of other things from
dental parts to automobile parts.   The factory is handling every aspect of
the A1200s including assembly, boxing, etc.  etc.  ESCOM has a sweet deal
there, and IMHO, will not be changing anytime soon.

5.  The cost?

A.  Not mentioned at the meeting.

6.  Where will they be available and when?

A.  September, as the A4000T.  They are planned to be in over 1200 stores
throughout Europe (a breakdown was shown, but that isn't really important
here).  They will also be available in very popular catalogs that have
everything from frying pans to electronics in them.  The European market
will be SATURATED with A1200s.  I love it.  At least the U.K.  developers
(you listening OCEAN and TEAM 17???) will have a good reason to stay/come
back.

7.  What is the word on the A1200CD unit that C= U.K.  halted production on
before it was released?

A.  Not a priority (take that however you want to; I know how *I* am taking
it).  There was a mostly working prototype at the end, but the lack of FMV
adaptability (and other things, I suspect) stopped it from hitting the
market.  Don't expect to ever see it, so stop waiting and get a Squirrel
and drive 3rd party.

8. What about the A1300, and 030 based A1200s, etc.?

A.  Not divulged at the meeting.  I really doubt that they exist at this
time.

GENERAL INFO

The A1200, IMHO, will be a landmark success with the ESCOM chain and
marketing power there in Europe (they send out almost 40 MILLION what they
call high-flyers to the public every year for advertising).  They owned
over 50% of the Pentium market for their PC based side.  These guys are
rocking over there and what they tell the market to buy, the market will
buy.  Damn shame it isn't happening over here.

As for the end of the A1200 in U.S.A., get your comments and letters ready
and send them to me and I will forward them to Mr.  Goff.  Perhaps then
they will see.  The attractive price tag and performance of the A1200
(especially with some RAM and a nice drive) is exceptional.  This is the
market I think they should break open the U.S.A.  with and I told them all
so.  Negative.

                             ** CD32 **

God, this is the worst part of all.  Q&A time.

1.  How many CD32s are we looking at getting this year?

A.  Absolutely none.  Zilch.  "No market for the CD32" either.  This is
both U.S.  and Europe.  I really like the CD32 and I will miss the
development for it dearly.  Even with the 70,000+ units that have been
sold, I doubt that there will be much more use for it.  Ed said that it
isn't dead, but 'not a priority'.  Figure it out.

2.  So I should just throw my machine out the door?

A.  No, there is still the SX-1 avenue to get a basic A1200 and you can
always network it to your existing Amiga (or even the new A4000T since they
won't make a CD-ROM in it).  I would suspect support for another 6 months
at best (Dark Unicorn Productions has several projects on the way so there
will be at least one developer - blatant advertising plug).  I just hope
more developers will take the CD-ROM route and force Amiga people to get
CD-ROM drives to be competitive.  You guys like Softwood and Digita need to
take note.

3. What about the 'new' CD32 we were told about in 1st Quarter 1996?

A.  As Norman Bates' mother would say "Its ALL LIES!".  According to Jeff,
there is no new CD32 on the shelf, nor was there ever.  The Amiga console
days are PROBABLY over (read on).

4. What is all this talk about CD32s for kiosk use?

A.  This seems to be the only thing ESCOM is willing to admit the CD32 is
good for.  I believe that they will continue to make the boards for the
CD32 if nothing else for this purpose.

5. Who is Viscorp and what do they have to do with the CD32?

A.  You can read about this company and their plans in detail in Amiga
Report Issue 313.  The only thing wrong with this article (sorry Jason), is
that there is NO OFFICIAL licence yet.  There are discussions only at this
point.  The basic thing is that Viscorp will be making a set top box with
some very exciting features out of the CD32 box.  Apparently a prototype is
completed.  Every developer should contact them and see what we can do to
support them in this endeavor.  They are likely to be the only one's
successful in the U.S.  with Amiga technology.

[While I have not been able to test this version of the story, it was quite
plainly stated as a fact by Viscorp that a license agreement was in place.
I have no idea why Amiga Technologies would deny this, or why Viscorp would
lie about having one, either way. -Jason]

GENERAL INFO

For those of you who know me well, you realize that this was the most
depressing part of the meeting.  The CD32 while CURRENTLY isn't up to snuff
with the latest consoles had a lot of selling points.   In its early days,
it could have owned the market.  Now...Sigh.   After all, CD-I is still
selling.

                    ** Interesting Points **

Here are some very interesting tidbits I picked up from the conference.
Take a peek.

1.  Alex Amor told us that NewTek is no longer going to be making the Video
Toaster for the Amiga once the current 140 or so are sold.   This is due to
lack of certain parts (you buy that crap?) and Alex said that they are
working with NewTek to reverse this game plan.   Until then, if you ever
wanted one, you better get it now.

2.  Centaur Development stated that the Video Processor/Roaster chip is
DONE and ready to go, pending the results of the conference and the outlook
for the future of the Amiga.  ALthough they didn't say it, I believe that
it will indeed ship now that there is a commitment to the A4000T's future.
This should healthily assume the position of the Video Toaster in U.S.  and
Europe.

3.  FMV seems to be a dead issue.  Unless the third party developers such
as CEI and the unknown U.K.  company I mentioned in my previous periodicals
continue development on FMV cards (looking unlikely now, eh?), FMV is an
entirely dead issue.  The rumored FMV Zorro compatible card of C= is also
'low priority' although a working prototype exists/existed, I doubt it will
ever see the light of day.

4. Petro had the most best hotel room of all with no windows...

5.  Service Management Group, the people responsible for some of the
excellent service we received with the Amiga's past warranty service, will
once again be handling warranty and repair service for ALL Amigas,
including the new A4000T.  Parts for the older machines should be available
soon.

That is about it.  If you all have any other questions, feel free to send
them to my EMail address at the top of this document.

                          REVIEW: AMINET 6 CD-ROM
                           By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

With the recent decision to move the Aminet CDs to a bimonthly (rather than
quarterly) format, it's going to be difficult to keep up.  Apparently,
they're really doing that well, and Aminet's usage is at its highest.
Great, I say.

Aminet 6's "headline" items include the entire collection of demos (many,
surprisingly enough, will run straight from CD, although you know those
wacky demo programmers, you may not be able to exit, or if you can, you may
wish you hadn't as a guru sneaks up on you and mightily crashes your system
when you least expect it), 520 megs of new material, and an authorized
collection of the entire Amiga Report archives up to and including AR 3.08
and the Auction issue.

The familiar AmigaGuide interface is back (where would it possibly go?),
again, as always, in English and German, with a quick search utility and
the ability to run and view most items directly from CD with your favorite
utility using the prefs feature of the CD.  (Obviously, the prefs aren't
saved directly to the CD, but you can save them for future reference.)

The collection of mods on this CD is enough to keep you busy enough, and
the "shuffle" button is a nice touch.  Pity it doesn't continually shuffle,
though.  A word of advice-Ignore Urban's ratings of the mods.  While I
usually don't disagree with his choices for terrible ratings (which are
fairly rare), he gives some high marks to some mediocre tunes.  To each his
own...

The Amiga Report collection comes with something even I didn't have before
this-an article search utility, which lets you search all AmigaGuide issues
(1.14 onward) for a text string.  I LOVE this.  I'm constantly checking
back issues to help people with questions I KNOW I saw answered last
summer, or to find a phone number from a company I KNOW was in one of the
first issues this year, or...etc.  Sorry about not being able to search the
earliest issues.  I'm not even sure what the reasons were that made this
impossible, but it's not like you're missing too much.  They're nice to
have around, though, if for no other reason than to see how Amiga Report
has evolved.

Aminet still holds a price of 25 DM, but authors of software that appears
on Aminet can contact Urban Mueller for a free CD.  Subscription deals are
also available from Aminet CD distributors.

What else can be said?  Aminet continues to be the premier source for
redistributable software.  While nothing beats the speed of your local
mirror site, it's sometimes nice to have the goods available at your
convenience, limited only by the speed of your CD-ROM drive.

                 REVIEW: AMUC CD-ROM SET (VOLUMES 2 AND 3)
                           By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

The Amiga Users of Calgary, the organizers of the recent AmiJam conference,
ran into a small problem on their AMUC Express BBS-what to do when the hard
drive fills.

Enter a series of CD-ROMs.  Essentially, when the drive is about full, they
grab an ISO 9660 image, run over to INSTAR, and whip up a CD, then clear
almost the entire drive.  Clever.

This set brings the second and third of these volumes, dated June 1994 and
October 1994.  Both CDs are in the "acceptably large" range, around 600
megs of archives.  It has the eclectic flavor of a BBS archive (which it
is), covering just about all areas of interest, from pictures to 3D
objects.  The three categories of separation are "data" (pictures, 3D
objects, etc), "software" (executables), and "hardware" (hardware hacks,
mostly.)  Most files have separate descriptions in a "descript" directory.
These descriptions are accessed by the included MUIFind program, used for
browsing and searching the discs.

The set would make an excellent general-reference addition to a
collection-since it came from a BBS, it has all of the "necessities" of
Amiga existance, such as LHA and DMS and even a few emulators.  The CDs are
getting a bit dated, but then again, a BBS can't take Aminet head on and
win anyway.  The collection is a valiant effort, and the presentation is
better than I've seen from some "professional" CD-ROM compilations.  

Sure, the compilation dates are a bit old, but it's not like the software
has rotted just yet.  In fact, my biggest complaint is the lack of any sort
of paper insert to label the double-jewel case.  The lack of a spine label
actually delayed this review, because I couldn't find it when I scanned my
CD-ROM rack last issue saying "Hey, did I forget anything?"  I realize it
kicks up the cost a bit, but it's worth it.

                           By: @{" William Near " link WILLIAM}
===========================================================================

HARD/SOFTWARE:  Advanced Amiga Analyzer v1.11

MANUFACTURER:  Wilcom Australia Ltd.

DESCRIPTION: Combination hard/software diagnostic utility for all Amigas

PURCHASED FROM:  
Software Hut
313 Henderson Drive
Sharon Hill, PA  19079

(800) 93-AMIGA - orders
(610) 586-5701 - info
(610) 586-5706 -  fax

PRICE:  I paid US$75.95, this includes $6 S&H.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The Advanced Amiga Analyzer will work on any Amiga
model.

SYSTEM TESTED ON:  
Amiga 2000 (Rev 4.4), ECS chip set, GForce '030 accelerator @ 50 MHz., 2 MB
CHIP + 8 MB FAST memory, Quantum LPS270S hard drive with Trumpcard
Professional controller, Picasso II RTG board, ioExtender, Workbench 3.1

PACKAGING: The hardware, 8 page dittoed manual, and floppy disk of software
all came in a bubble wrap envelope.

INSTALLATION: The Analyzer hardware consists of a plastic box
(5"x2.5"x1.5") with four port dongles, a joystick port pass-through and
eight LEDs (parallel, video, serial and mouse).  To conduct the preliminary
hardware test you must first power-down your computer and attach the
serial, parallel, video, and joystick port dongles (A1000 requires gender
changers.) Turn the computer back on and check that all the LEDs are lit. 
If one or more did not light up then this indicates a problem with the
corresponding port(s).  If all of the LEDs lit then power-down the computer
and remove the mouse and video port dongles.  Reattach your mouse and
monitor and power-up the computer with the supplied disk in the drive.

TESTING: The Analyzer's software boots up into the Gameport tester screen.
From this screen you can see a graphical representation of your mouse and
joystick ports.  By moving your mouse in all directions and pressing any
single or combination of mouse buttons, you will see a light appear in the
corresponding pin position(s).  The mouse X and Y coordinates are also
displayed on this screen.  The same happens when moving your joystick in
all directions and pressing the fire button(s).  If any of the
corresponding lights do not light then this indicates a problem with that
specific pin on the port.  By clicking on any of the graphical
representations of the port pins a text box will appear indicating what
this particular pin controls and what hardware to check on the Amiga for
possible causes of the problem.

It should be noted that the diagnostic information comes from the A2000
schematics.  While other models vary, the general chips should be similar
enough to allow you to troubleshoot any model Amiga.

There are a series of buttons at the bottom of the main screen.  By
clicking on any one of these you will be taken to that testing or
information screen.

PARALLEL: This screen contains a graphical representation of the parallel
port's 25 pins.  Each pin may be clicked on to see what it controls and
what hardware to check in case of malfunction.  A parallel port test is
also included.  By clicking on the Run Test button you will initiate a
parallel port test using the hardware and software of the Analyzer.  The
test is ended by clicking on the End Test button.  Any errors that may have
occurred will appear in a window with the complete explanation for what
hardware to check.  If the test was passed then the window will indicate
this.

SERIAL: This screen contains a graphical representation of the serial
port's 25 pins.  Each pin may be clicked on to see what it controls and
what hardware to check in case of malfunction.  A serial port test is also
included.  By clicking on the Run Test button you will initiate a serial
port test using the hardware and software of the Analyzer.  The test is
ended by clicking on the End Test button.  Any errors that may have
occurred will appear in a window with the complete explanation for what
hardware to check.  If the test was passed then the window will indicate
this.

MEMORY: This screen contains two windows.  One window displays all CHIP,
FAST and other expansion memory that is installed on your computer.  The
other window displays any errors that may have occurred during testing. 
When you click on the Run Test button, a memory test is done on all
installed memory.  A display at the top of the screen shows which pass
number the test is on, as well as the address block and current address of
the test in progress.  The test is ended by clicking on the End Test
button.  If no errors were found then a Test Passed requestor will appear;
otherwise, the lower window will display the errors that were encountered.

DISK: This screen allows you to test any of up to four floppy drives that
are connected to the computer.  You can initiate either a READ ONLY or a
READ/WRITE test on any of the floppy drives. 

The READ ONLY test will only test for read errors on the inserted floppy
disk(s) in the drive(s) to be tested.  As each track is read from, a green
box will appear with the error number encountered, if any.  This test will
continue until you click on the End Test button.

The READ/WRITE test will check for read and write errors on the inserted
floppy disk(s) in the drive(s) to be tested.  Each track is tested by
performing two write and read tests, and as each track is read from a green
box will appear with the error number encountered, if any.  This test will
continue until you click on the End Test button.

If you encountered any errors while testing the floppy drives then you can
click on the ERRS button to see a list of seventeen possible errors.

You may also check the drive alignment for any floppy drive by using the
READ/WRITE test on a known good floppy drive and disk.  Take the good
floppy disk and insert it into the suspect drive and then run a READ ONLY
test on this drive.  If you encounter any errors then this drive's
alignment is questionable.

VIDEO: This screen contains a graphical representation of the video port's
23 pins.  Each pin may be clicked on to see what it controls and what
hardware to check in case of malfunction.  A video port test is not
available.  The hardware of the Analyzer will only test the integrity of
the three power pins on the video port.

CONFIG: This screen will display the following information about the system
being tested:

     * ROM version
     * Agnus version
     * Denise version
     * CPU
     * FPU
     * Display (NTSC or PAL)
     * Any expansion boards installed
     * All memory installed

AUDIO: This screen displays four boxes on the screen (one for each of the
four Amiga audio channels) which contain a musical scale.  When you click
on the Run Test button a scale of notes will be played through each of the
four sound channels one at a time.  This test will continue until you click
on the End Test button.  If, during the test, you don't hear some or any of
the notes being played then this could indicate a problem with the
hardware.

MORE TO COME: This is the most annoying button on the screen!  The author
tells you how he's constantly trying to upgrade the hard/software.  This is
all well and good, but he asks that you contact him with any ideas or
comments you may have -- he also neglects to give you any contact
information In four different locations throughout the manual, software,
and readme file.  This makes it quite difficult to do.

HELP: This button appears on each of the above testing and information
screens.  When you click on this button a window will appear which explains
the current screen's testing procedure.

DISLIKES: The cables that lead to the various ports could stand to be a bit
longer.  It is usable now, but 6 more inches of cable wouldn't hurt.  The
dongles for the ports could use better screws.  The ones included need a
flat blade screwdriver -- using the thumb screw approach would be much
better (the type found on most modern cables.) I would also like to see the
inclusion of an Email and/or snail mail contact address for the author.  He
goes out of his way in asking for suggestions and comments, but doesn't
supply the needed information for submitting these suggestions and
comments.

SUMMARY: All in all the Advanced Amiga Analyzer is a useful tool.  It can
be used to analyze your current Amigas or possible purchases of used
equipment.  It saves you the trouble of opening up the computer to see what
boards and chips are installed, as well as eliminating the fear of buying
defective, used equipment.  The Analyzer can track down 90% of Amiga
hardware failures and suggests some very good leads on what parts of the
hardware to check.  If the Analyzer saves you from making one service visit
or from buying one defective, used Amiga, then it's more than paid for
itself.

@node REVIEW4 "Review: Almathera Ten on Ten CD Pack"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                   REVIEW: ALMATHERA TEN ON TEN CD PACK
                           By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

The "5-Foot 10-Pack" has become something of an eyesore in the IBM PC
CD-ROM market.  These monstrosities, which sell for about US$40, contain 10
CDs, usually one Doom collection, a few mostly worthless multimedia
offerings, and some totally worthless CDs as filler.  Occasionally, there
are a couple of classics, but in general, the vinyl holders aren't worth
buying.  (They do sell pretty well, though.)

Almathera had the same idea, but turned it around completely.  Rather than
the largest packaging possible, they squeezed their 10 CDs into a
paperboard case roughly the size of two stacked jewel boxes, each CD with
its own paperboard sleeve (which, by the way, form a nice rainbow-order
pattern in the case.) They had to jack the price up a bit (it's more like
US$60), but...


Disc 1: Almathera Comms & Networking CD
---------------------------------------

This is the "main" CD of the collection.  It is the only CDTV/CD32 bootable
CD, allowing the user to access the rest of the discs if they're not
fortunate enough to have a CD-ROM equipped full-blown Amiga (or a CDTV or
CD32 so decked out that a boot CD is unnecessary).

The primary purpose is to get the user connected to something, somewhere.
For modemers, Terminus is included.  For local networking, Parnet and
SerNet (largely for the CD32) is included, as are Envoy tools.  For TCP/IP
type net connections, a comprehensive installation of AmiTCP 4.0 demo is
included, along with quite a few useful and fun networking programs
(Grapevine IRC and Netrek, to name a couple.)

The work of getting the user online is very well done, put together by
Almathera's resident net geek, THP.

When you're tired of talking to other computers, there are some diversions
on board.  The entire Blaz...uh, BLAZEMONGER collection of articles,
StarWoids, and a complete Amiga Report archive up to and including the
Auction issue and 3.09.  An assortment of "useful" utilities, including
DiskSalv, LHA, DMS, and KingCon are there for enrichment purposes.

It's a good start, even if it is missing such staples of networking as
Mlink and a decent FTP client.  Still, just about every essential is here,
and in a well presented form.  Nice sendoff.


Disc 2: CDPD 1
--------------

To be flat, this is an old CD-ROM, one of Almathera's first products (if
not THE first), with Fred Fish discs 1-660 and about 100 MODs.  Not a bad
thing, per se, but nothing current enough to keep you entranced for ages.

Protracker and Noiseplayer are included for MOD enjoyment, and KingFisher
is on the disc to make the Fishing process less of a hassle.


Disc 3: CDPD 2
--------------

This companion piece brings the Fish collection up to about 760, adds 220
disks of the Scope collection and 150 megs of archives from the now-defunct
AB20 archive of Amiga software (back when Aminet was not a mighty monolith
of Amiga FTP)

As an interesting aside, 10 disks from JAM Magazine (Just Amiga Monthly)
are included.  The readme file didn't mention them...that's what made it an
interesting aside.

Again, not bad.  There's certainly useful software to be had.  But it can't
replace being current.


Disc 4: Demo 1
--------------

The third offering from the old archives of Almathera is what it sounds
like-a big collection of demos.  Most fall under the category of
"single-screen" demos, rather than the multi-screen "mega-demos" that I
prefer.  Such is life.  Good luck getting some of these to run...you know
how demos can be...

Aside from the collection, there are some games, a small collection of
clipart, a dash of fonts, some classic animations (including works of
Tobias Richter and Eric Schwartz), and a large collection of MODs.

Good stuff, considering you only paid $6 for it.  This is a CD worth
spending some time on.  I admit, I'm a sucker for animations.


Disc 5: World Vista
-------------------

Hey, great idea!  Educational/reference software for the Amiga!

It was originally a CDTV title, and has endured some minor bug-fixes to
make it usable for all Amigas.  (It's a good idea to disable mouse-altering
clients, though, just in case.)

The interface is sound and easy to navigate.  The information on the
countries isn't always encyclopedic in scope, but the included musical
clips and digitized HAM images are a nice touch.  Pity that it still has
the USSR, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia...

The program is OS-compliant, but its method of handling multiple screens
can be a bit alarming if you try to multitask (after all, on the CDTV, they
didn't think you would.)

The included phrase-translation guide (that speaks the translated phrase,
from a choice of a couple dozen or so) is a nice touch, as are the city
maps (even if they are a bit too rare.)  As a general-reference tool
(providing the country still exists), this is actually a nice program.


Disc 6: The Illustrated Works of Shakespeare
--------------------------------------------

Let's hear it for AMOS.

This was clearly the product of a company that said "CDTV?  Wow, this
multimedia stuff is neat.  Let's get a multimedia authoring system and
write some software!"

The result is...well, it's ok.  Yes, it IS Shakespeare's collected works,
and I suppose not all of the pictures are terribly distracting.  But on
balance I think I'd have preferred a less gaudy presentation, as well as
one that accessed more quickly (some of Shakespeare's scenes are short, and
you lose the rhythm having to click, click, click...)

It's nice to have.  Hey, it's a lot cheaper than buying one of those
Shakespeare collected works volumes.  But it's decidedly CDTV-era.  Get
together some actor types and have a blast.


Disc 7: Pandora's CD
--------------------

Sorry, I just don't quite get this one.

It seems to be a combination "CDTV Multimedia Sampler Disc" (something to
make you feel good about having bought one) and a multimedia promo disc
(i.e. something to convince people it's worth buying one).  Originally
published by Optonica, the disc is a combination of self-promotion for
their own products and some multimedia educational and entertainment (both
used loosely) features, consisting of animations with voiceovers, mostly.

Check it out, then shelve it.  I couldn't get the interface to work
properly on the 3000.


Disc 8: Team Yankee
-------------------

Is it silly to have a 5.5 meg game on a CD?  Well, yeah.  But the story
goes something like this-

The floppy license to this game had already been sold, so Almathera bought
the CD license.  Plus, they needed to round out the ten pack.  "Nine Pack
of CD-ROMs" just isn't as satisfying if you think in decimal.

This is a 3d (at times) multi-vehicle strategic tank battle game.  To
understand more, you'd really just have to see it.  The manual was scanned
in and included on the CD (and on Disc 1, for convenience), and can be
viewed as the game plays out, since it multitasks.

The game is nothing exciting, and I could think of dozens of others I'd
have preferred, but hey, they didn't ask me.  Consider it a nice reward for
making it this far into the set.


Disc 9: Almathera Photo Library CD
----------------------------------

Part pretty picture collection and part promotional vehicle for
Photogenics.  That's a pretty fair way to sum this up.

It's about 530 megs of data, largely consisting of collected IFFs, GIFs,
and JPEGs, with a small assortment of PhotoCD images (in file form) and
some Photogenics-generated sample pieces, as well as a demo version of
Photogenics itself.

Rather interesting was the inclusion of the Ten on Ten box logo as one of
the Photogenics examples.  Showoffs.

It's hard not to like lots of pictures.  It's certainly lots of pictures.
The IFFs are largely HAM-8, though, so be wary, ECS users.


Disc 10:  Almathera Clipart and Fonts CD
----------------------------------------

To give you a starting point for original Photogenics creations
(presumably), here's 190 megs of fonts and clipart.

Sure, they could have put a lot more on there, but it IS a rather large
chunk of fonts (bitmapped, CompuGraphic, and Postscript) and the usual
stock black and white clipart.

Hey, it's got Bodoni, the font Amiga Technologies is using for their new
logo.  Can't complain much there.


As a Whole
----------

So, let's take score.  4 hits (Comms and Networking, Demo 1, World Vista,
Photo Library), 5 iffy's (CDPD 1 and 2, Shakespeare, Team Yankee, and
Clipart and Fonts), and just one miss (Pandora's CD).  That's really not
bad at all, and of course, tastes will vary.  (I challenge anybody to stare
me in the eye and tell me they found Pandora's CD an unbridled success and
masterpiece, though.)

It's a lot of data bang for the buck.  An investment in something like the
Aminet Set may give you a more consistent diet, but it's 6 less CDs and a
much less eclectic arrangement.  Almathera's Ten on Ten has a sense of
style, and the included CDs should be enough to keep you busy for a long,
long while.

  KBTools - bringing Knowledge-Based Systems to the Amiga.

VERSION

  Prototype release. See below.

AUTHOR

  The software is a usable product of a research project 
  carried out at the IT Institute of the University of Salford.
  The main authors were Dr Andrew Basden and Alex Brown. 

  Email: A.Brown@iti.salford.ac.uk
  WWW: <http>://www.salford.ac.uk/iti/docs/depts/iti/projects/inca/inca.html
  Phone: 0161-745-5292
  Fax: 0161-745-8169

DESCRIPTION

  Knowledge-Based Systems encapsulate human knowledge to 
  perform tasks such as diagnosis, prediction and selection.  
  They are particularly appropriate for handling complexity 
  and uncertainty.  KBTools is a toolkit which supports the 
  construction and maintenance of Knowledge-Based Systems.

  KBTools allows for full forward-chaining and 
  backward-chaining, uncertainty, probabilistic and bayesian 
  reasoning and provides a comprehensive set of inference 
  procedures. The emphasis is on ease of building Knowledge 
  Bases as Boxes and Arrows diagrams.  A flexible GUI 
  provides the interface between the Knowledge Engineer and 
  the Boxes and Arrows representation of the Knowledge Base.  
  The interface between the system and the end user is 
  configurable by the knowledge engineer.

  We hope to bring this product to full commercial status; 
  the software released is a prototype version only.  We 
  are placing it in the public domain for the following 
  reasons:

     1) To elicit any comments, suggestions and criticisms
        regarding the prototype software.

     2) To allow people to develop and contribute knowledge 
        bases or ideas for knowledge bases. 

     3) To contact people interested in registering as 
        developers. 

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  Amiga OS 2.0+.
  2mb+ chip memory.

AVAILABILITY

  The software is directly available via the Internet:

TITLE

    "The Music Web"

VERSION DATE

    Second Edition -- June 1995

DESCRIPTION

    The Music Web is an extensible, interactive, graphic-diagram platform
    on which you can build `webs' of elements that manipulate MIDI event
    streams.  Modules with specific functions can be `plugged together' by
    placing icons in a diagram and linking them to form a network; these
    two-dimensional, interlinked chains of elements give your creativity
    full rein to explore new effects.  [Caveat: the name has nothing to do
    with the World Wide Web! It was unfortunately chosen before the latter
    became well-known.]

    Element modules in this edition include note filters and modifiers,
    an `Instrument' that plays 8SVX sample files, recording and playback,
    and a MIDI file player.  Full documentation is included in the archive.

    You will probably be able to take best advantage of this package if
    you have some kind of multitimbral, multichannel MIDI setup, but it
    should be useful for even the simplest.  In fact the supplied initial
    demo will play standard MIDI files through the Amiga's (four) internal
    sound channels, witout any attached MIDI interface at all!  With more
    modules to come, I hope it can become one of the most flexible music
    environments around.

    Many of the current functions:

        MIDI IN and MIDI OUT (of course!)
        Loudness (reduce velocity value of a note event)
        Transpose (up or down by octaves and semitones)
        Key Filter (block or divert specified notes of the scale)
        Key Range (pass a specified range of notes)
        Msg Filter (block or divert specified types of MIDI messages)
        Channel Filter (block or divert specified MIDI channels)
        Splitter (where events are actually diverted to another path)
        Set Channel (of events on the path)
        Delay (make delayed copies of note (and other) events)
        Instrument (uses 8SVX IFF samples to play notes)
        Note Off (generates a note-off for each note-on (use with Delay))
        One Note (converts all notes to the same pitch (for sound FX))
        Record/Playback
        Read MIDI File (feeds record/playback element)
        Monitor (events on the MIDI stream)

NEW FEATURES

    *   Distinctive (icon) images for the various elements

    *   Record/Playback

    *   MIDI File playing

    *   Other added modules

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    The Music Web needs the 2.04 or later operating system; it should run
    in a 1MB machine.  It really needs something faster than a 68000 to
    be useful (though it will run on one).

    Of course an essential requirement for most uses is a MIDI interface
    on the Amiga serial port.

    Documentation is in AmigaGuide form, so you should really have this
    on your system (although you *can* read it without if you have to).

TITLE

     InfraRexx
     (and InfraJoy hardware design)

VERSION

     1.6a
     (and InfraJoy version 4.0)

RELEASE DATE

     14-Jun-95

AUTHORS

     Leon Woestenberg (leon@stack.urc.tue.nl)
     Jeroen Steenblik (jeroens@stack.urc.tue.nl)

DESCRIPTION

     The InfraRexx software along with the InfraJoy hardware serve as
     an ARexx-Infrared interface, that adds the function of an infrared
     remote controller to your Amiga, and more.

     With this software and hardware you can:

       o Control external audio/video devices via ARexx commands.
       o Control Amiga programs via a common remote control unit.
       o Learn and edit new remote control infrared commands.

     For example you can control a moduleplayer via your compact
     disc player remote control unit. Or, control your video tape
     recorder via a graphic user interface or an ARexx script.

     The main features are:

       o Seperate editor (with learner) and ARexx host commodity.
       o Multitasking-friendly infrared sampling monitor, with very
         low system overhead during monitoring; can also be disabled.
       o Font-sensitive, style-compliant graphic user interface.
       o Supports localization under Workbench 2.1 (or better).
       o Uses AmigaOS 3.x functions and gadtools features if present.
       o Modular lowcost hardware for joystickport, with throughput.
       o Uses the Amiga Installer Utility to install onto (hard)disk.

CHANGES

       o Release 1.6a differs from 1.6 by a bugfix in the schematics.
       o Building plans and documentation for new v4.0 hardware.
       o Added support for new hardware's multifrequency feature.
       o Added german and norwegian language catalog translations.
       o Improved RexxEvent; now handles multiple events in one call.
       o Optional MagicWB icons installable via the Installer utility.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

       InfraRexx needs at least AmigaOS version 2.04, and the commodity
       needs RexxMast to be running in order to be useful. The software
       is useless without the small InfraJoy hardware add-on, off which
       the design and full building instructions are included. The
       hardware can also be ordered from one of the authors.

     EMail: hhoff@pool.informatik.rwth-aachen.de

DESCRIPTION

     An universal picture viewer (incl. PhotoCD) and converter
     for all Amigas and esp. for Cybergraphic users.

     This program can display pictures in many file formats (see
     below) directly in windows on the Workbench (default public
     screen) or in a window on a separate screen. If you have
     a suitable graphic board with Cybergraphic WB emulation
     installed you can even watch the pictures in full color
     quality (HiColor/TrueColor) on your Workbench. Without
     Cybergraphics the normal color restrictions (2 to 256
     colors) will lead to a reduced quality, but smart pen
     allocation during displaying will still give surprisingly
     high quality with 256 colors.

     You can switch forward and backward between images and
     scroll images in their resizable windows. An automatic
     preloading feature will reduce waiting time to a minimum.
     While you watch one picture (and maybe scroll it around),
     the next picture will already be loaded, so that it will
     be there if you decide to switch... You can select down-
     scaled loading for viewing in reduced size. Unlike many
     other viewers, this viewer reduces most pictures during
     loading and will thus be faster for reduced size loading.

     Additional features include conversion to some 24Bit formats
     (incl. JPeg, IFF-ILBM24, Targa) and fast direct transfer
     to famous image processing and painting programs (ImageFX,
     XiPaint, ArtEffect/PicoPainter).

     Internally supported formats for loading:

     1) IFF-ILBM (1 to 24Bit incl. HAM6/HAM8)
     2) PhotoCD (Base format 768x512 or 512x768 (portrait))
     3) JPeg (color and greyscale)
     4) PPM/PGM/PBM (P1&P4 b&w, P5 grey, P6 color)
     5) QRT (also known as dump format by PD raytracers as POV-Ray)
     6) Targa
     7) PCX
     8) BMP (uncompressed)
     9) TIF (packbit-compr./uncompr.)
     10) EGS7.x window icons
     11) DEEP
     12) YUV
     13) VLAB raw
     14) RGB
     15) HHsYUVSq sequence format
     16) IFF-PBM (DPII)
     17) ACBM
     18) FBM
     19) Sun raster (uncompressed)
     20) MacPaint (b&w compressed 1Bit format; datafork only)
     21) HHsXRL formats

     The additional DataType support extends this list by many
     formats; DataTypes can e.g. be found on Aminet in util/DType.
     The DataType support is very fast, so that you can also view
     pictures in GIF or other formats quite fast for which Datatypes exist.

NEW FEATURES

     New since V3.0: + OS3.1 not needed anymore for displaying with 2 to 256
                       colors; OS3.0 is now sufficient
                     + configurable screenmode for use of it's own screen
                       instead of WB (or default public screen)
                     + Viewing directory can be changed by a menu function
                     + Increased drawing speed on standard Amiga screens

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     OS3.0 (unlike previous versions OS3.1 is not needed anymore)
     4MBytes FastRAM recommended

     Optional for TrueColor/HighColor viewing:
       cybergraphics.library V40 or higher and a suitable graphic board.
       The Cybergraphics emulation is compatible with many graphic boards
       (e.g. CyberVision, Piccolo, SD64, Spectrum, Picasso2, Retina-Z3,
             Domino)

     PoolWatch 1.03

AUTHOR

     NORWAY

     EMail: magneoe@stud.cs.uit.no

DESCRIPTION

     PoolWatch is a debug tool for OS 3.0 and higher designed to watch
     and correct illegal allocation and freeing of memory that use the
     pool-functions provided in OS 3.0 and upwards.  PoolWatch is
     necessary since Mungwall do not catch any illegal memory handling
     concerning pool-allocations.

     PoolWatch is especially useful in combination with Enforcer,
     Mungwall (which will watch normal allocations that use
     AllocMem/FreeMem), SegTracker and FindHit (included in the
     Enforcer archive).

     If SegTracker is running in the system when PoolWatch is started,
     PoolWatch will use the public SegTracker seglist tracking for
     identifying the hunk and offset into the executable doing illegal
     allocations.

     PoolWatch will patch CreatePool(), DeletePool(), AllocPooled(),
     and FreePooled() in exec.library.  PoolWatch will use these
     functions but will add extra security on top of all
     pool-allocations.  In most cases of illegal allocation/freeing,
     PoolWatch will report the error to the user and correct the
     problem (if possible).  Please note that PoolWatch does not offer
     any memory protection if a task writes to a random addresse in
     memory, but will take care of most problems associated with pool
     allocations.

NEW FEATURES

     Version 1.02 fixed two small bugs, and introduced three new
     options; NOSTACK, NOREGS and STDIO (output to stdio instead of to
     the serial port).  Version 1.03 fixes an address error (occurred
     on 68000 machines), and introduces the options UPDATE and
     DOILLEGAL.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     AmigaOS Release 3 (V39+) or higher.

DESCRIPTION

    `phonebill' is, simply said, a log file analyzer. What it basically
    does is scan log file(s) generated by a terminal program or a mailer,
    extract all information about calls you have made by using your modem,
    and store this in its own (short) format. After extracting the calls
    `phonebill' can generate various reports in which you can find
    information on duration and costs of the calls.

    Here is a small list of the main features:

     * Very flexible user-configurable rates, supporting exceptions for
       certain days and dates.

     * User-configurable log scanners: `phonebill' by default supports
       various log files, but for any log file that is not supported the
       user is able to create a scanner. The following is a list of log
       files that are already supported:
          * AmiTel
          * AutoPilot
          * CyberPager
          * DreamTerm
          * GMS
          * GPFax
          * ISDN Master Telephone log
          * JamMail
          * JrComm
          * MagiCall
          * MicroDot
          * Multifax (both v2.0 and Multifax professional)
          * NComm
          * Off-line Amiga
          * Plink
          * Term action log and Term call log
          * Terminus
          * TheAnswer
          * TKR-BTX
          * Trapdoor
          * Trapfax
          * UUCP TimeLog
          * XenoLink
          * ZeeTerm

     * Log files can be automatically truncated if their size exceeds the
       maximum size.

     * Generates miscellaneous reports: statistics, total costs, predicted
       costs ...

     * Context-sensitive online help.

     * Supports new 3.0 features (new look menus, ...).

     * Nice `Amiga User Interface Style Guide' conformant user interface.

     * Supports `traplist.library'.

NEW FEATURES

     * Added GMS scanner.

     * A French catalog is now available.

     * Several minor enhancements and bug fixes.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    Workbench 2.04 or higher.

TITLE

     Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)

VERSION

     Version 2.6.2 (USA and Canada version)

AUTHOR

        Original version written by Philip Zimmermann, Colin Plumb,
     Staale Schumacher and various contributors. Amiga port and
     enhancements by Peter Simons and Robert Knop.

DESCRIPTION

        Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), from Phil's Pretty Good Software, is
     a high security cryptographic software application for MSDOS, Unix,
     VAX/VMS, Amiga and other computers. PGP allows people to exchange
     files or messages with privacy, authentication, and convenience.
     Privacy means that only those intended to receive a message can
     read it. Authentication means that messages that appear to be from
     a particular person can only have originated from that person.
     Convenience means that privacy and authentication are provided
     without the hassles of managing keys associated with conventional
     cryptographic software. No secure channels are needed to exchange
     keys between users, which makes PGP much easier to use. This is
     because PGP is based on a powerful new technology called "public
     key" cryptography. And PGP performs the public-key functions faster
     than most other software implementations. PGP is public key
     cryptography for the masses.

CHANGES

        Please check the included README.1ST and ReadMe.amiga file for a
     detailed list of modifications.

NOTES

        This version of PGP is for use in the USA and Canada only.  Users
     outside these two countries should instead use PGP 2.6.2i, which was
     announced earlier on comp.sys.amiga.announce.

        This vesrion is based on the same source tree as PGP 2.6.2i.
     However, it was compiled with the RSAREF library to make it completely
     legal to use in the USA.  The USA and international versions are
     functionally equivalent.

        A mailing list concerning PGPAmiga has been created on
     peti.rhein.de. To subscribe, send e-mail to PGPAmiga@peti.rhein.de
     with "ADD your_address" (without quotes) in the message body.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     PGP 2.6.2 works completely with Kickstart 2.0 and above.  It mostly
     works with Kickstart 1.3, but the key generation still does not
     function under 1.3.  (We are working on that, however.)

LEGALITY

        This version of PGP is perfectly legal for non-commercial purposes
     inside the United States of America and Canada.  However, before you get
     it, you have to agree not to export it out of these two countries.
     International users should use PGP 2.6.2i, released by Peter Simons
     (simons@peti.rhein.de).

HOST NAME

     ftp.csn.net

DIRECTORY

     /mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/pgp/amiga

     NOTICE -- this directory is a little tricky to get into because of
     the export controls.  To get into it, first go to directory /mpj
     and get the file README.MPJ.  If you agree to all the terms in this
     file, it will tell you the name of the directory which is listed as
     a bunch of ?'s above.  This name changes frequently, so read
     README.MPJ right before you are planning on downloading files from the
     site.

FILE NAMES

     pgp262-amiga020.lha    68020 executables and full docs

     rsaref-amiga.lha       RSAREF 1.0 library w/ Amiga files added

     Users only need to get one of the first two files.  If you have a
     68020 or better, the 68020 version of PGP will be significantly
     faster than the other version on your machine.  The last two files
     together comprise the source code necessary to build your own version
     of a USA and Canada legal PGP 2.6.2.

TITLE

     Yak -- multi-purpose commodity

VERSION

     2.0

AUTHORS

     Gael Marziou and Philippe Bastiani.

     E-mail address: Gael_Marziou@grenoble.hp.com

DESCRIPTION

     Yak stands for "Yet Another Kommodity" (never was any good at
     spelling), and is a mouse/window manipulation program along the
     same lines as MCP, MagicCX and lets you activating screens 
     and windows, inserting localized date. 

FEATURES

     A lot! Among them : AutoActivation of windows, extensible hotkey 
     system (like FKey's) with a lot of different actions

NEW FEATURES

This is a major release of Yak, it introduces a lot of changes since Yak
1.60. Yak 2.0 main goal was to provide more flexibility, this has been
achieved by a new way to handle options for hotkey actions and by adding
configurability to mouse cycling. Due to this, GUI code has expanded quite
a lot, so now GUI is separated from the main commodity.
Beside these major changes, there were also some less important ones among
which: 

     - New option 'Activate only' for 'Cycle Windows' action. 

     - New toggle in 'miscellaneous' window : 'Full Workbench'.

     - KeyActivate is now disabled while a mouse button is pressed.

     - Added a 'Clear' gadget to the keydef window.

     - New toggle in 'miscellaneous' window : 'UNIX Dirs' 

     - New option for CycleWindows action, you can now specify a pattern
       on the name of the task which handle some windows. 

     - A new tooltype for the prefs program to let you choose your own
       font for Yak GUI independently from the screen font.

     There are also other changes not listed here, browse the doc and
     the GUI to find them.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     OS release 2.04 or newer is required; Yak has been tested with
     OS releases through 3.1.

  o group different events and make them appear simultaneously
  o keep a simple database of the birthdays of family and friends
  o let your Amiga keep track of how old people are by insterting the date
    of birth in the middle of the string where you want to display the age
    (I.e. the text "Adam is {years:08/05/1970} years old today" may be
    displayed as "Adam is 24 years old today".)
  o make advanced events which are displayed for example after 21:00 every
    3rd day the first 7 days of every 2nd month the next 4 years
  o combine all of the attributes mentioned above in the same event
  o enter these events in an easy-to-use, totally font adaptable multi-
    window environment and without the need of programming-knowledge, just
    by entering the desired text and pressing a few buttons
  o localized for most languages supported by Commodore as well as some
    unsupported ones
  o well documented - over 100K of documentation!

NEW FEATURES

  o The checker may stay resident in memory (optional) and keep on
    reminding you until you quit the program or turn off your machine.
    Will check the events every minute (idle time may be overridden).).
  o The checker is a commodity, and may be controlled via the Commodore's
    Commodities Exchange program.
  o Unlimited number of dates can be attached to the same event.
  o You can combine weekdays and date, allowing you to make events which
    will be shown i.e. the third Sunday in a month etc.
  o Major update of the calculation fields: allowing you to include both
    the current date, current time, calculation of days, calculation of
    years, current weekday and such in the SAME event! The fields can be
    selected and inserted from a requester.
  o Possibility to group only certain events, flash certain events etc.
  o Recursive directories, allows you to make folders of events i.e.
    keeping all birthday-events in a folder called Birthdays. Unlimited
    number of levels!
  o Search and replace of events.
  o Recall can pop up requesters on any public screen.
  o New powerful type of event: Input - generates input-events and
    hotkey-presses.
  o New type of event: AREXX - runs AREXX scripts directly.
  o Modular built.  Its functionality may be extended with modules.
  ...and much more

  Various bug fixes.

DESCRIPTION

    fMSX Amiga emulates an MSX computer on an Amiga. In its current
    state it will run cartridge based games (not included but
    available through FTP and WWW) and allow you to play around
    with MSX BASIC.

    Action speaks louder than words, and most of the action can
    be found in games, so I'll just list some of the available
    software titles:

    Loderunner               Raid on Bungeling Bay    Zaxxon
    Bosconian (1)            Falcon (2)               Eggerland Mystery
    Grog's revenge           Guardic                  Knightlore
    Knightmare               Oil's Well               Payload
    QBert                    Tank Battalion           Thexder (3)
    Twinbee                  Zanac                    Digdug

    (1) With speech!
    (2) You read that right, and it is the original version.
    (3) And it runs faster than the Amiga version - the mind boggles.

    Of course fMSX Amiga is fully multitasking, runs in an intuition
    screen, and has a font-sensitive user interface.

NEW FEATURES

    Speed! fMSX Amiga now has two ways of redrawing the screen,
    OS-friendly and highspeed.

    The OS-friendly mode, which was also available in the previous
    version, should work with everything from OCS to graphics cards.
    This mode is slightly faster than before.

    Highspeed mode takes over the screen, and uses the coprocessors
    for updating the screen, resulting in a massive speed boost.
    In this mode multitasking is still left enabled, but the copper,
    blitter, and screen are constantly in use by the emulation.
    This mode is obviously not compatible with graphics cards.

    It is at all times possible to toggle between the two modes with
    a simple keypress.

    Other features include greatly enhanced sound, support for joysticks
    with two buttons, and lots of bugfixes.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    Required are:

    - Amiga OS 3.0
    - 68020 processor
    - 400 kilobytes chip ram
    - 700 kilobytes other ram

    Recommended:

    - 68030 processor, at least 25MHz
    - Those 700 kilobytes of 'other' ram had better be fast ram!

    Note that fMSX Amiga does *not* require the AGA chipset. In fact,
    it should run on any chipset upto and including graphics cards,
    although this has not been tested.

AVAILABILITY

    fMSX Amiga 0.5 is available from any aminet site, such as:

    ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/misc/emu/fmsx_0.5.lha (97264)

PRICE

    fMSX Amiga 0.5 can be yours for... ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!

DISTRIBUTABILITY

    fMSX Amiga 0.5 is publically supported freeware. If you are
    interested in the source, and you're not afraid of function
    pointers and huge amounts of assembly intermixed with C, you
    can request it from me.

TITLE
     Xv for Amiga - Image display and manipulation program

VERSION
     2.18 (X11 v.3.10a)

AUTHOR
     John Bradley

     Terje Pedersen (terjepe@hstud6.cs.uit.no) ported it to Amiga.
     (Oterveien 55/9017 Tromsoe/Norway)

DESCRIPTION

      This is an Amiga port of the X11 program Xv by John Bradley.

      The xv program displays images in the GIF, JPEG, TIFF, PBM, PGM, PPM,
      X11 bitmap, Utah Raster Toolkit RLE, PDS/VICAR, Sun Rasterfile, BMP,
      PCX, IRIS RGB, XPM, Targa, PhotoCD, XWD, possibly PostScript, and PM
      formats on workstations and terminals running the X11 Window System.
      The documentation for XV is now distributed only as a PostScript file,
      as it has gotten enormous, and is no longer very well suited to the
      'man' page format.  Print a copy of the (100-ish page) manual found in
      docs/xvdocs.ps.  If you are unable to get the manual to print on your
      printer, you may purchase a printed copy of the XV manual.  Click on
      'About XV' in the program to get further information.

NEW FEATURES

     Added PNG support and a truckload of more fixes.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Amigas with 68020+ and MUI 2.0+ preferably with 6mb+. Manipulation
     on 24bit images will require a lot more memory.
     A big Workbench may also be useful. (640x400 is a minimum)

AVAILABILITY

     An X11 version in source form is available on public.x.org and
     other X11 sites.

     ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/gfx/edit/xv218.lha
       and
     ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/gfx/edit/AmigaXv_docs.lha
     (unchanged from previous releases)

PRICE
     Free! With a suggested contribution of $10 for the use of my X11 
     emulation (libX11) and my efforts at porting the program.

DISTRIBUTABILITY
     Xv is Copyright 1989-1995 John Bradley and the distribution of the
     Amiga version has been granted by the original author.

     The program may not be sold/redistributed in any other way or form
     without the consent of the author.

===========================================================================

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to jcompton@xnet.com, and ask very nicely.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.
Having a 150k limit is highly recommended.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!             **

To circumvent the new pay-per-megabyte system for Australian Internet
communication, Paul Reece has been kind enough to set up an AUSTRALIAN-ONLY
mailing list, to save his fellow countrymen some money.

You can join the list by sending mail to:   majordomo@info.tas.gov.au

with the single line (in body of message):

Amiga Report will then be bounced to you.

==                        UUDecoding Amiga Report                        ==
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.  Please stipulate as
well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to the editor.

      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We

      related and get quick replies from the experts.

      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine.
 * Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
      never worry "Ooops... Am I paying for this area?" again!
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  And you get FREE unlimited
      usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
      email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
 * Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
      at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
