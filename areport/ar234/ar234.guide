Well, we're not quite cooking with gas yet, but at least SOMETHING is
happening.

Actually, there was quite a lot of what seems, in retrospect, to be hot air
flying around at the World of Amiga show in the UK a weekend ago.  C= UK
was confronted by several people on the subject of online conferences, and
they claim that they are prohibited from speaking about the buyout
publicly.  This is interesting, since even into January '95 issues of UK
Amiga magazines, Pleasance continues to write about just that...

All sorts of people listened as David Pleasance informed them that he was
pretty sure that CEI had lost their financial backing-at times, he seemed
to blame the Amiga Report online conferences for scaring them off.  He even
got Utilities Unlimited's own Jim Drew to post to CompuServe that yes, CEI
had indeed lost their financial backing. 

Good one, guys.  CEI, at least, doesn't think so.  They directly refute C=
UK on a lot of points.  First off, they claim that they are under no
restrictions to talk about the buyout.  (Good thing, too, now that they've
held four conferences and have a fifth coming up.)  They deny that they've
lost any financial backing for any reason.  And, just to prove a point,
they've submitted an offer and a deposit for the Commodore assets.

So, here we go again.  Who do you believe, who do you trust?  Had CEI not
submitted the offer and deposit, it would merely be another case of "they
said, we say" and around and around we go.  But some money has been put on
the table, along with an honest-to-God press release, so we'll see what
happens now.  (Incidentally, there's even a contradiction there...CEI says
their cash deposit is the first, but Pleasance claimed that they had one
before CEI submitted theirs.)

The ball has, rather unfortunately, been cast back into the liquidator's
court, and a formal presentation of the CEI bid is due Tuesday.  When we'll
hear what happens, I don't know yet.  However, GEnie's Amiga *StarShip* has
arranged (all on their own) to hold a CEI conference on the 22nd, so AR
will be present to document and report...

Unfortunately, none of the regular AR staff were able to make it to Wembley
for the WOA, but we've compiled enough reports that, hopefully, we can make
you feel like you were there, too.

This might be the last issue of 1994 for Amiga Report...it'll depend
largely on how much material we can collect before January 1st.  Next issue
will feature more reviews and HOPEFULLY some serious news on this damn
liquidation.  I'll even have an overview of the fabled Commodore 65
prototype I recently obtained thanks to the C= US liquidation...

We'll also have a large reader survey launched in the next issue, be it
2.35 or 3.01.

Until then, enjoy...

Jason

PS - I suppose Amiga Report should make an official statement on how we see
the recent Pentium revelation.  So, here goes...

"It's one thing to make a mistake.  Everybody does that.  It's entirely
another thing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars convincing people to
buy that mistake."

Alas poor Amiga?
----------------

The Amiga is dead...Long live the Amiga.  What are we supposed to make of
it all.  One article proclaims that there's no hope for our wonderful
machine - might as well throw it out the window and buy a (uuurggh) PC.
Then the next one you read sings the praises of RISC technology, DSP chips,
Retarg graphics support, all coming your way in the guise of the best value
machine for the price, everyone will buy it, etc...  Personally, I agree
with rbeekman@xs4all.nl - get real.  However, let's not put too pessimistic
a bias on the argument.  Let's *try* to look at it in a semi-detached
fashion - a hard one, I'm afraid, but...  :(

The Amiga as business machine?
------------------------------

     The Amiga, as we all know is a great machine.  Yes, I'm sure you're
all sick of people saying this - so am I, but let's face it, it IS the best
value package I can think of for the low cost you pay.  Yes, obviously if
you're a big professional organisation, and you're looking for the latest
hi-spec all-singin'-all-dancin' system then maybe the Amiga isn't your best
bet.  But prepare in that case to get out a big fat wad of cash.  The big
companies can afford this, of course, and (often rightly) argue that the
expensive systems they're investing in offer greater opportunities for
customer support and future upgrading.  Fair enough.  The picture is also
gloomy as far as the Amiga is concerned on the small business front.  If
you don't have a clue about computers, chances are that you'll wanna get
some advice on the system that's right for your company - but who has
really been informed of the merits of the Amiga?  Mention the word to a
salesperson and you generally get a strange look as if to say "we are
talking about *computers* here, right?"

Even for that enlightened minority of dealers who are Amiga-friendly, the
struggle is an uphill one.  The PC - the bile riseth as I type this :( -
dominates the business market, along with the Mac in some areas.  Both
platforms have admittedly good software: personally, I have access to 386s
and 486s and use Word6 in preference to FinalWriter2, simply because it's
better - sorry Amigans.  But the point is here that if I couldn't get
access to PCs, I certainly wouldn't buy one.  The technology to my mind is
beaten hands-down by equivalent Amiga systems, and the software on the
Amiga is better value.  Compare the relatively inexpensive FinalWriter to
the monstrous price-tag of Word6, PageStream3 to PageMaker6.  The PC/Mac
stuff may be slightly better, but not hugely so - the price differential is
far from justified, particularly since PC/Mac developers are producing for
a much wider mass-market than that constituted by the Amiga community.  If
you're not aiming at the highest-end machines and packages available - and
you're probably not if you're in a small business - then the Amiga seems to
make more sense.  But now back to our enlightened dealer.  How does he/she
persuade the end user to make the right decision?   Herein lies the
problem.  It doesn't take a computer whizz to figure out that PCs/Macs are
saturating the computer market with their expensive advertising campaigns
and the sheer number of these machines that are already being used in
business.  If you want compatibility, and upgradeability, you can only
assume that the best computer for you is the one everybody else uses.  And
that, sadly, is the way things are going. 

Now CEI/C= UK - whoever wins the bid - can't hope to compete with the big
boys on their own terms (as Alex Amor of CEI acknowledged on the recent IRC
conference).  They can't push the same funds into ads, and they won't be
taken as seriously as will the other platforms, simply because the latter
have established names in bigger markets.  This is only to be expected.  
Most developers, particularly if they believe the Amiga is on the road to
hell, will switch to a more lucrative source of income, where their
prospects are more sure.  If they put loads of development money into a
good package, they'll also want a fat return.  The Amiga isn't gonna sell
itself as the ultimate business machine just at this time, I'm afraid.  So
what is its likely fate? 

The Amiga as Jumped-Up Console?
-------------------------------

     The Amiga has a well-established reputation as a great games machine -
which of course is part of its problem in getting itself established in
business circles.  But is this a handicap?  Much of the Amiga's established
market lies, to my knowledge, in the home; and much home use - though far
from all - is dedicated to gaming.  Some will argue that the Amiga should
stick to - and improve upon - what's it's good at.

This argument does an injustice to the machine - it can be very good at a
very wide range of things.  But let's put that aside for a moment.  So
should the Amiga concentrate on its established market?  Well, the fact is
that here too - as Alex Amor again succinctly put it - the Amiga can't
compete with "the big boys" - the Sega/Nintendo Corporations.  SegTendo
consoles are designed with one thing in mind - games (and of course making
huge profits from the sale thereof).  Make no mistake, these guys have
MONEY, and they're not afraid to use it.  They blast our TV screens with
trendy commercials and sell games based on cute cartoon characters, fancy
scrolling shoot-'em-ups or big bad beat-'em-ups with loadsa gore etc.  Now
these guys are releasing new consoles with mucho custom hardware designed
just to produce the kinds of games that kiddies will knife their parents
for ["gimme $100 pleasepleaseplease" - "die you little......" ;-) ] Now of
course these games aren't generally the in-depth stuff that have mostly
remained the preserve of `real' computers, so there are possibilities for
the Amiga in this area - only if, however, it's able to compete with the
PC/Mac platform in this area.  Already we hear of great products like Sim
City 2000 which will require an A1200 with 5 MEGS (!!!) of RAM to install
on HD, and 4 to run from floppy.  And even then the game will run slower
than on a 486.  This could easily be rectified by a well-placed accelerator
and a couple of megs of RAM, and still for under the price of the PC/Mac. 
But the question is: are there enough people out there to make the
continuation of such quality releases likely?  The Mac/PC market can rely
on businesspeople who take their machines home for a bit of relaxation, but
the Amiga is dependent on a much smaller and much more diverse user-base.

So what is to be done [as Lenin once wrote in a different context :-?  ]
Well, this all depends on what the Amiga's new owners have in store.  
They've already got some great technology to build on, and even if the user
base is comparatively small, it is a loyal one.  Amigans love `their'
computer precisely because it's not some alien piece of plastic stuffed
with Intel silicon or fronted by a very friendly Mac interface which finds
it difficult to let the user burrow into the actual workings of the system
with ease to see why this or that isn't working quite right.  The Amiga has
personality and its community will stick with it as long as they can.  It
can still be a credible games platform for those who are not turned on by
the thought of over-priced carts and games that are often so slick that the
alien concept of gameplay has been lost sight of somewhere along the line.

The Amiga still has dedicated programmers, and if some software houses are
moving their primary development platform to the PC, other coders are
moving in from the PD/demo world and presenting us with great new titles
(Team 17 are the most famous example, but there are other, more recent
arrivals).  The Amiga can have a future in entertainment software, because
it is a *real* computer.  People might not buy it primarily for games, but
they will probably buy games in any case.  The other computer platforms of
course have the same advantage, but they don't have the custom chips - if
we all spent the equivalent amount of money on an Amiga as on a 486 DX-2,
we too could be enjoying Doom2 or whatever in all its accelerated glory -
and maybe better.  But the Amiga is not, and is not likely to develop into,
a jumped-up console.  Its real strength lies in the diversity of its uses,
of which leisure software is simply one of the more widely- recognised
aspects.

A terminal disease? [excuse the pun]
-------------------

     It is surely quite clear to us all that the bidding process has
dragged on for too long.  Of course, we realise the legal technicalities
that have to be sorted out, the negotiations and offers that have to be
made, so it isn't necessarily the bidders' fault.  I believe that both C=
UK and CEI have the best interests of the Amiga at heart.  Both seem
willing to commit real resources to its future development, though it's a
real shame that David Pleasance and Colin Proudfoot haven't been able to
match Alex Amor in terms of PR - why, one asks exasperatedly, do they
constantly ignore AR's pleas to become involved in an IRC conference, or at
least to answer questions?  Obviously they have their secrets to keep - for
tactical reasons - but there's good business sense and then there's bad
publicity.  I've always been a big fan of C= UK, so come on guys, get your
act together (if you're even reading this :( ).  I'm being swiftly
converted to CEI, who seem to have a better eye for the Amiga public as of
late.  However, gripes aside, if both companies are committed to winning
the bid, then they must see a future for the Amiga.  Even the worst
businessperson does not put capital into a venture that doesn't look like
it'll succeed - unless he/she has more money than sense.  BUT, the more
time that's lost in wrangling over the final deal, the further behind Amiga
technology necessarily falls. 

As the Amiga is made to lag increasingly behind; as no new machines are
produced; as no new R&D is undertaken; in short, as the Amiga's future
continues to look uncertain, developers will, rationally enough, turn their
attention elsewhere.  Gone, or going, are the days when Amigans could say
"You wanna do 3D rendering - get an Amiga" or "You're using a PC for that
multimedia presentation??!  - hahahaha..." And those days will continue to
slip through our fingers unless we pull those fingers out (what an analogy
- ow!  sorry).  Every day is precious from here on in.  New stocks need to
be produced, and rolled out to the fanfare of a fairly major ad campaign
directed at the Amiga heartlands such as the UK and Germany to build on
established bases of loyalty, as well as in existing markets where the
machine is already extensively used in a particular sphere - eg Toasting in
the US.  The Amiga's very real advantages should be pushed for all they're
worth - more genuine multitasking than PCs or Macs, better value hardware
and software, a friendly but powerful GUI, easy expandability and potential
cross-system compatibility - for all those people who have PCs or Macs in
work but detest the thought of stooping to buy one for home use.  R&D
should restart immediately, but should not necessarily seek to emulate the
competition, because this simply would mean that the Amiga will be one step
behind.  New machines should offer something genuinely different - a good
reason for the sceptic to buy the machine instead of the competition.  Of
course, all us poor student-type low-to-mid-end users can't expect to be
able to afford this WOW!  technology just as soon as it comes on the
market, but as rbeekman@xs4all.nl said, those who can afford it, if they're
really convinced that it offers them something they need, will buy it in
sufficient numbers for prices eventually to be lowered, particularly as the
cost of the new technology drops as time goes on. 

Cut the Crap, What's the Verdict?
---------------------------------

It's all too easy to romanticise the prospects for the machine that we all
prefer; I should know, because I've already owned two computers of various
kinds as each went through its death-throes.  Of course, none of them died
overnight - no sir, their end was a long-drawn out affair, with excellent
titles still being released years after the official tombstones had been
carved and the coffins lowered into the ground.  So even in a worst-case
armageddon-type scenario, where no-one ends up with the bid, the Amiga will
live on - partially at least.  Good titles will be released for years to
come, particularly since the PD/Shareware scene is so vital.  You need only
login to one of the bigger Aminet sites to witness this fact.  Yet it does
seem likely that someone *will* end up holding the Amiga's fate in their
hands, be it CEI or C= UK.  Both have plans for the development of the
range and the technology, but their task will, I suspect, be a difficult
one.  The old cliche that money talks is truer than ever in the computer
world - witness Microsoft, Intel or Compaq in their domination of the
market.  PCs and Macs are not likely to allow the Amiga elbow-room, because
they know that the computer could pose a real threat to them, if only the
truth about its capabilities were more widely known.  Because of this, the
Amiga will have to rely, in the short term certainly, upon the loyalty both
of its users and software developers.  Only if it's given the breathing
space it needs can further development take place and a real chance for the
machine be generated.

The task will be difficult - maybe impossible: the market dictates - the
quality product does not always emerge the winner, as Betamax found to
their cost in competition with VHS all those years ago.  The Amiga is the
last true home computer - it excels in so many areas that it can't be
neatly pigeon-holed as a `business machine' or `games console'.  It has a
unique `community' of users who have a real affection for their computer. 
It has the technology on which to build, and it's not yet too late to
salvage something good out of this whole mess.  Our Amiga deserves a
chance, but a chance, alas, is all that it appears to have.  Time alone
will tell its fate.

You've heard their side
You've laughed at the Far Side
You've fallen on your backside
Now read the Darkseid

Things to do in the computer lab Part II
----------------------------------------

1)  Give all your disks names, talk to them, treat them like people, when
    one gets a virus ask the technician for the name of a good doctor, draw
    faces on them all.

2)  Keep a loaded mousetrap beside your mouse, explain that it keeps the
    mouse on its toes (You too I suppose)

3)  Make a cut out for your monitor that looks like something else, for
    example a christmas face, or better yet one which makes your monitor
    look like a TV set complain loudly that you cant get Mtv...

4)  When somebody isnt looking swipe the ball out of their mouse and watch
    the frustration as they track and track and the poor little cursor wont
    move about guranteed to produce another sort of cursor, if asked
    explain that sometimes the little man who lives in the mouse goes on
    strike/holiday....

5)  Take the magnetic disk out of a floppy, reseal th e case, now try to
    use the disk in a machine.  Complain that the stupid machine wont read
    your disk repeat on several machines, when confronted with the truth
    deny everything and state that the first damn machine must've eaten it
    when you werent looking.

6)  Ask someone which key is the 'any' key  (press any key to continue)

7)  When about to print shout incoming and run to thw far side of the room,
    works best if you have a fast or very loud printer

8)  When starting up from a cold boot, keep pressing some keys, pretty soon
    the buffer fills up and you end up with a beeping tone, the more you
    press the more you beep, try and communicate with others using only
    these beeps, two or more people beeping will drive the whole lab nuts,
    trying playing a tune eg When the saints go marching in beep beep beep
    beep, beeep etc etc etc

9)  Cackle loudly when the windows logo pops up, it makes people nervous
    When the hourglass icon pops up ask a technician for a key so you can
    wind the clockwork up agin..

10) Every 2 minutes turn round and smile at the technician, itll make em
    paranoid

11) Verbally say CLICK as you click with the mouse, when dragging something
    make a noise like an areoplane Vrnnmmmmmmmmm

12) Everytime someone isnt looking move their keyboard an inch to the left
    or right

13) Bring a portable drill in with you, if anyone asks just smile....

14) Turn the brightness & contrast way down when you leave a machine, the
    power is on and everythings connecte d but no picture, it'll drive them
    nuts, esp if you do it to someones machine whilst they're not looking /
    out of the room

15) Email someone famous and offer to tell them something scandalous about
    someone closely connected to them.....

16) Everytime the hourglass pops up time it in a loud voice, one second two
    seconds etc

17) Alter the windows screen resolution to its highest possible setting,
    the result is very small screens which you cant read that well esp with
    terminal packages

18) This needs an accomplace, set your email address as a forwarding
    mailshot, sending it to your partner, get them to set their email to
    forward mail to your address, result you can bring a server down in
    less than 3 minutes and a whole net in 10.  Only snag is you'll
    probably get caught and lose all your priveleges.....

19) Everytime you press return mutter Hah !

20) Learn to drum type, type in a rhythmic clattering pattern ie sound like
    Nine Inch Nails

21) Everytime you use a peice of Microsoft Software mutter about sheep
    chainsaws and Bill gates in an evil little voice.

22) Every time you logout and turn off say Hah, got you that time

23) Any time you get a supervisor request, demand they submit it in writing

24) Any time your supervisor is in the room, leave and as you walk past
    say, hah didnt catch me that time

25) Pretend to have amnesia, you cant remember how turn use a computer ask
    the nice supervisior to guide you through it and at the end ask them wh
    at happened to the little yellow guy in the maze.

26) Sneeze on your screen and leave it there

27) Remap the keyboard to russian or arabic, very confusing

28) Lock the default for windows into symbol, if anyone asks you why reply
    that its much easier to read and ask if they cant understand what it
    says on the screen....

29) Everytime you press a key pretend to get a static shock, yelps are
    quite disconcerting

30) Paint all your fingernails a different colour, when asked, say it remi
    nds you which finger to type with on which day of the week, then add it
    also reminds you which finger to pick your nose with.

Things to do in the real world, that freak people out
-----------------------------------------------------

1)  Label all your socks with your name in big black biro

2)  Hide some of you clothes in flat mates wardrobe/drawers, when they wear
    that article of clothing jump on them for it

3)  This one takes time but....  Move all your flatmates furniture around
    start small, move a table a few inches to the left, move books from one
    side of the room to the other, gradually build up, move their bed,
    eventually rearrange all the furniture in their room, deny everything.

4)  Rush into a bedroom, haul the matress off the bed, prop it up against
    the window and dive under the bed yelling duck and cover

5)  Hide some snacks in a sealable plastic bag at the bottom of the bin
    when your flat/room mate is in the same room, announce your hungry then
    root around in the bin, palm some of the snacks, exclaim excitedly
    commence eating, guaranteed to gross out

6)  Anytime your flat mate cuts some vegetables shout murderer and run
    crying from the room

7)  Drink lots of cans of cola, something like 'Jolt' is best (it has 2
    times more caffeine than anything else).  Number all the cans and stack
    them in the middle of the room, when questioned yell thats its none of
    their business and youre we ll within youre constitutional rights

8)  Mail a banana with your name and address written on it in pen, see what
    state its in when it gets back, if asked where it came from reply you
    have a cousin in Brazil who sends you them from time to time.  Also try
    this with Eggs and Melons, dont wrap them and write your full address,
    on sticky label if need be, you may need to use glue to affix the
    stamp(s).  Work up see whats the largest messily destructible thing you
    can send by post (hint Biscuits are cool ;) )

9)  E-mail Jason and ask about the new floor scrubber......  ;)

10)  Buy a rubber duck and carry it around w ith you.....  General weirdness
     is good for you look where the muppets got Jim Henson.......

From: "David C. Gorton" <udcg@sunyit.edu>
Subject: Intel Fraud Hurts Everybody: Investigation (Just. Dept. & 
SS&Tech Cmte)

Dear Congressman Boehlert,

I'm writing to you in your capacity as Ranking Republican on the Science,
Space and Technology Committee.  I'm VERY concerned about the government's
lack of action against Intel, the maker of processors for the ubiquitous
IBM PC compatible.  I suspect that this lack of action is because the
people in power don't understand how this "technology" affects every aspect
of daily business and even medical care for individuals.  It even affects
Animals & the Environment.

By now, I'm sure you've heard about the Intel Pentium division design
flaws.  The Pentium (aka the 80586) is the 3rd in a family of 32-bit
processors from Intel; all of which have had design flaws!

When the 80386 and 80486 were released, they both also had numerous design
flaws.  From logic and math errors, to heat and electrical spec problems. 
Now the Pentium is also part of the problem.  I'm asking you, "Why wasn't
Intel investigated back in the late 80's when the 80386 first was revealed
to be flawed?" Maybe it's because big business could get away with bllody
murder and fraud under the Reagan/Bush administrations?  Will
Intel/MicroSoft do it again under a Republican controlled congress?

I'm sure part of the problem is that decision makers don't understand the
significance of these problems and how it will trickle down to daily life.
Fidelity's Magellan trust was jeopardized, with earnings incorrectly
projected, reportedly due to calculations from spreadsheets running on
Pentium based IBM compatibles.

The IBM compatible has always been a poor design, from 1980.  Despite the
hype, the architecture hasn't changed much on 14 years.  It succeeded due
to marketing advantages, and people's insecurities about "this new
technology", NOT because it was a good design.  As a result these machines
are everywhere.  Macintoshes and Amigas are rare by comparison.  WHAT THIS
MEANS: since there are so many of these machines being used for CRITICAL
TASKS, the public is placed in economic and mortal jeopardy, because these
systems use Intel processors.

Example: Scientific work relies on math greatly.  In the case of medicine-
measurements, calculations and theories are used to produce treatments. 
But if the math is wrong, life-saving research could be hindered, red
herrings could be produced, cures could be missed, and worst of all... 
LIVES COULD BE LOST.  What about all the money that will be wasted to re-do
experiments that were flawed due to faulty Pentium calculations?  In the US
alone, Millions of animals are killed and treated cruelly each year in the
name of progress.  How many more will be vivisected because because
previous experiments will come into question?  Biological "research"
depends heavily on math, due to the chemistry involved.  I know you
supported HR 2472, which aimed to use computer technology to reduce the
number of animals suffering in labs in the US.  Now, Intel's faulty,
rushed-designs will condem more animals to torture and death, because
scientists will want to recheck their data.  As a self-proclaimed
environmentalist, you should also know that Intel is on the Silicon Valley
Toxics Campaign's "Dirty Dozen" list, as the most egregious of polluters.

Let me ask you this, Mr.  Boehlert: In your frequent airline trips to and
from Washington and home, WOULD YOU FEEL SAFE ON YOUR PLANE RIDE IF YOU
KNEW THE PLANE WAS DESIGNED ON A CAD SYSTEM THAT USED A PENTIUM PROCESSOR?


Increasingly Computer Aided Design (CAD) systems are based on Intel IBM
compatibles.  If a car is designed using AutoCad on a Pentium system, how
do we know the car lives up to it's projected specs?  Also please note that
Intel's Neptune chipset and PCI controllers have also have problems.  Intel
makes the motherboards for major "PC clone" vendors like Dell and Gateway.
One digital flaw on top another...this is tragedy waiting to happen.  And
the sad part is, it may have already happened, we just don't know it-
because these sorts of things are hard to track down.

That's why I'm asking you to launch a full investigation, as Ranking
Republican on the SS&T cmte.  Also, I want your support in having the
Justice Department investigate the actions of Intel.  Be aware that IBM
itself has said it won't be using Pentium chips, at least until Intel gets
their act together and starts being honest.

Industry journals have noted that Intel has lied repeatedly about when they
first learned pf the flaws.  Inside a week, they went from claiming they
knew about it a full two MONTHS ago...to all the way back to July.  The
only reason they came clean at all, is because the Math professor who
actually bothered to check the figures coming from his Pentium, got tired
of waiting and went public.  If not for his math skills and honesty, Intel
would still be getting away with it.

FACT: They still are getting away with it!  Intel admits to KNOWINGLY
shipping flawed chips, and are STILL doing it!  Though they have corrected
one of the problems (the other problem is a defective write-back cache)
they CONTINUE TO SHIP DEFECTIVE CHIPS, along with corrected ones, with no
distinction between them.  INTEL PUBLICALLY ADMITS TO THIS.

This is fraud.  What will you do to halt Intel from shipping any more 80486
or Pentium/80586 chips, until there is a complete investigation?

Sincerely,
Dave Gorton
Vernon NY

[Jason's note: Just in case you missed it, this letter was originally
directed to a Congressman, but the author also sent it to at least 50 other
people who I guess he felt were "important".  So, there you have it.]

                               CYBERVISION64

Pioneering a new generation in graphics performanceThe CYBERVISION64
graphics card is produced by phase 5 digital products, the developers and
manufacturers of the Fastlane Z3 Controller, the Blizzard Turbo Card series
and the Cyberstorm 68040/68060 Accelerator.

The CYBERVISION64 satisfies the most demanding requirements on performance
and system conformity because of its combination of an extremely fast 32
bit Zorro3 interface, a 64 bit wide graphics controller and exceptional
software.

Once again the phase 5 design team have proven their competence as one of
the most innovative technological pioneers in the AMIGA market.Based on the
highly integrated graphic chip Trio64 from the renowned manufacturers S3,
which integrates an expensive graphics processor, a complex 64 bit wide
Blitter as well as a highly efficient 24 bit converter for D/A conversion,
the CYBERVISION64 can offer a video band width of 135 MHz.

It will, therefore, support a variety of resolutions in True Color, High
Color and 256 colours.

The CYBERVISION64 32 Bit Zorro3 interface is highly optimised and allows
transmission rates from the AMIGA main memory to the graphic memory of up
to 16 MByte/sec (using fast CPU cards) - an exemplary rate that sets new
standards.

Data transfers within the CYBERVISION64 video memory are executed by the 64
Bit Blitter at speeds above 100 MByte/sec, practically in an imperceptible
amount of time, resulting in extremely fast shifting operations, for
example.Another special feature of the CYBERVISION64 is its hardware
support of Planar-to-Chunky Conversion which, with AMIGA graphics cards,
often takes up most of the time required for emulation and representation
of the AMIGA modes.

This hardware solution is some 6-8 times faster than typical software
solutions which considerably accelerates the emulation and representation
of AMIGA modes and especially the representation of 8 Bit graphics. 
Complementing this efficient hardware is excellent driver software which
fully utilises the performance of the card for unusual system conformities.
The CYBERVISION64 screen modes are installed via the CYBERVISION64 monitor
files, are available via normal ASL-Requester (e.g.  in screen mode in
PREFS) as "normal" system resolutions, and for common applications
operating under OS3.0 or 3.1 require no additional driver.

Working with CYBERVISION64 becomes a real pleasure.  By supporting many
functions, such as draggable screens or virtual screens that can be
considerably larger than the actual screen resolution and within which you
can scroll much like within an AMIGA Superbitmap, the CYBERVISION64
achieves an extraordinary Look-and-Feel that is difficult to differentiate
from the original AMIGA resolution.

Naturally, the CYBERVISION64 has an expansion bus through which additional
cards such as JPEG or MPEG cards can directly access the fast video memory
making the CYBERVISION64 suitable for future developments.  The combination
of the attention that has been paid to necessary details, such as slipped
through AMIGA video signal and integrated, loss-free electronic switching,
default-monitor-timing on system start-up or simple expansion of the 2MB
version to 4MB with common memory modules, with the usual high quality of
phase 5 products will be able to satisfy even the most demanding user.

CYBERSTORM Cache Module

  Information about the CYBERSTORM Cache Module was unfortunately not
    available at the time of printing this brochure.

All CYBERSTORM components are manufactured in Germany to the highest
industrial quality in modern Fine Pitch SMD technology and are subjected to
a complete functionality test prior to delivery.  The manufacturer provides
a one year guarantee.  Because of the three-dimensional use of the space
available in the AMIGA 4000, the systems specified here cannot be installed
in the AMIGA 3000 or the AMIGA 4000T.

CYBERSTORM versions for the AMIGA 3000 and AMIGA 4000T are in development
and should be available at the beginning of 1995 - if there is sufficient
demand.

However, these systems have limited modularity and expansion capabilities.

Redefining Performance

When the CYBERSTORM project began in December 1993, it was probably one of
the most demanding and ambitious development proposals for the AMIGA.  The
objective was to move into the future of system performance, and to allow
the AMIGA to catch up with the latest high-performance PC's and
Workstations.

The method of achieving this was to design a non-compromising accelerator
card, based on the new Motorola 68060 high performance processors, that
would set new standards in performance, expansion capabilities and price.

This project underlines the fact that the phase 5 digital products
development team (Official Motorola Beta Site Developer and Commodore
Commercial Developer) is a leading technological developer in the AMIGA
sector.

This has already been demonstrated with products such as the Fastlane Z3 or
the Blizzard Series.

The CYBERSTORM System is basically designed as a High End 68060 System for
the A4000.

In the basic 50MHz configuration it achieves a processor performance of
some 80 MIPS (*): a performance level that has been previously unknown in
the AMIGA sector.  Prepared for clock speeds of up to 80MHz, it also has
more than adequate reserves for subsequent faster versions of the 68060
processor.

The flexible design also allows the 68040 processor to be used at various
speeds, with performance of between approx.  20 and 30 MIPS.  This means
that the CYBERSTORM System can be offered in different performance classes,
which is an obvious advantage for the user who may want to start with
minimal investment, but have the opportunity to install other expansion
systems or to use a faster processor in the future.

Performance is not defined by the processor's power alone, but also by the
device's flexibility and expansion capabilities.

As well as a selection of different processor versions and the greatest
possible flexibility in memory configuration, the CYBERSTORM System also
has a variety of expansion options that will be available from the end of
1994 as expansion modules.

The rejection of any technical compromise in the development of the
CYBERSTORM System has succeeded in bringing a technologically leading
product onto the market with an excellent price/performance ratio that
demonstrates just what can be achieved in modern user friendly product
design.

                              Modular Design

The CYBERSTORM System for the AMIGA 4000 is designed as a fully modular
system not only with the various expansion modules that can be fitted
according to the user's requirements but also in the basic systems that are
available.

These basic systems consist of three components: the CYBERSTORM Carrier
Board, which is installed in place of the original processor board in the
AMIGA, the CYBERSTORM CPU Module and the CYBERSTORM Memory Board which are
both slotted into the Carrier Board.  The Carrier Board is a fully
asynchronous internal (i.e.  between the various CYBERSTORM components) and
external (to the AMIGA system and Zorro Bus expansions) interface.

It controls the data flow between the main memory, AMIGA System components
and the CYBERSTORM I/O Module if it is installed.

Extremely fast programmable logic components, as well as expensive, highly
integrated synchronisation logic, provide optimal signal transit times
which result in the highest possible data transmission rates.

A further part of the synchronisation logic is integrated in the CYBERSTORM
CPU Module and is optimally rated to the respective clock speed of the
processor used.

This ensures that the CPU module can be exchanged for another version at
any time without having to change any of the other components.  This
concept guarantees optimal access speed and the greatest possible
performance at each CPU speed.

The CYBERSTORM Memory Board has slots for 4 single or double sided 32 Bit
SIMM Modules.

This allows memory to be configured in various levels and combinations up
to 128 MByte.

The asynchronous interface concept also applies to the memory: the
bi-directional buffer logic allows the CYBERSTORM CPU asynchronous access
to the memory which operates at the AMIGA system speed of 25MHz.  This
principle makes the memory transparent to other system components which
access it by DMA, and avoids possible problems that can arise with
so-called local memory designs which, for example, are directly linked with
a CPU clock.  There is no principle speed disadvantage over designs which
operate the memory at higher clock speeds, as 25MHz is the upper limit for
memory access without wait cycles (even for 60ns fast D-RAMs), which is
performed on the CYBERSTORM in Burst Mode Access.

In addition, existing memory can still be used after a CPU upgrade to a
higher clock speed or another type of processor, and even without loss of
performance.

With a data throughput that is nearly independent of the processor
frequency of up to 66.66 MB/s in Burst Mode Access, the CYBERSTORM memory
achieves multiples of the AMIGA 4000 Fast RAM speed, whereby even a
CYBERSTORM System clocked at 25 MHz demonstrates clear acceleration,
especially when working with large amounts of data.

The CYBERSTORM System is not linked to any particular type of processor. 
Processor modules with other than 680x0 processors can be installed at any
time, as long as they are supported by the AMIGA operating system. 
Wherever the future of the AMIGA may lead, you can be assured that the
CYBERSTORM will keep apace of technological advances.

                             Expansion Options

To do justice to the requirements of an absolute high-end solution, the
CYBERSTORM project has always made provisions for considerable expansion
options.  This well thought-out expansion concept means that the CYBERSTORM
System can support the widest range of user needs, even in professional
fields.The CYBERSTORM I/O Module together with a Fast SCSI-II Controller,
an Ethernet Controller and a serial High-Speed-Port, offers all the
essential interfaces required for professional applications.

The Fast SCSI-II Controller that naturally operates as a DMA Unit with 32
Bit FIFO Buffer, offers transmission rates up to 10 MByte/s with minimal
CPU loading.  Active termination and internal and external 50 pin SCSI
connections guarantee the highest possible data security.  The know-how
gained from developing the Fastlane Z3 (the world's first 32 bit SCSI
Controller for the AMIGA and twice product of the year in 1993) was used
extensively in the design of the SCSI interface, which has mature driver
and utility software amongst other features, and also includes a CD-ROM
Filesystem and the efficient cache software, DynamiCache.

A serial high-speed interface with its own FIFO buffer has also been
integrated in the I/O Module to guarantee problem-free operation of fast
serial devices without data loss.

For users who do not need the networking option, an alternative to the full
I/O Module is the CYBERSTORM Fast SCSI-II Module, which is also based on
the same advanced technology found in the Fastlane Z3.  Offering DMA
transmission rates of 10 MByte/s with minimal CPU loading, active
termination and internal and external 50 pin SCSI ports, this also includes
the complete SCSI software package as supplied with the full I/O Module.

The CYBERSTORM CPU Module also offers another High Speed Connector with
direct processor connection through which, for example, cache memory and
boards with second processors (e.g.  DSPs) or other high speed expansions
can be connected.

                                The Quality

CYBERSTORM sets standards even in its design and quality.  It is produced
to the highest industrial standard in expensive and precise Fine Pitch SMD
technology.  Digital components and high value mechanical components are
selected to a high processing quality, which as a whole contributes to the
high level of reliability.  The three-dimensional mechanical design
optimises the use of the space available in the A4000 and allows easy
access for installing and refitting the CYBERSTORM system.  Active CPU
cooling eliminates heat problems even before they arise, demonstrating that
even in this respect the CYBERSTORM System meets the highest requirements.

Hi there,

it's been a long time since I wrote my last article.  Things are looking
good for me at the moment and I am quite busy producing my first rendered
Intro for a PC Game (3 minutes of animation).  It's great fun, hard work
and finances my Cyberstorm :-) What else could one ask for ?

Not much else is happening right now.  All the new development has been
shown at the WOCA. It looks like the majority of Amiga developers is
waiting for the CBM takeover to be finalized, before they  continue to pour
money into Amiga developement. This decision I understand.

Then, a few days ago, this mail appeared on the German part of FidoNet,
here follows a rough translation:

[Actually, this is the English press release from MacroSystem's US
distributor, NoahJi's.  -Jason]

                        MacroSystem Announces DraCo

Powerful Professional Graphics and Video Workstation Shipping this Spring

December 5, 1994 - Boulder, Colorado.  MacroSystem GmbH of Witten, Germany
is pleased to announce the development of their own video and graphics
workstation named DraCo.  Based on the Motorola 68060, this incredibly
powerful machine will ship in the Spring of 1995.  For operating systems
the Amiga OS will be standard and UNIX clone support is expected.

The conception of this computer is based on the absence of the Amiga custom
chips.  Any software program that runs on Amiga graphic boards like the
Retina and the Picasso will work in DraCo.  This includes LightWave, AdPro,
Image F/X, Imagine, Bars and Pipes Pro, and most every other professional
software package.  Hardware compatibility is the function of the five Zorro
II slots.  Thse slots allow use of the Toccata, Emplant, Ethernet, VLab Y/C
and most other hardware boards.  Hardware that requires the custom chip set
won't run in DraCo.  This includes 880K floppies, genlocks, and the
Toaster.

Development and production of DraCo are not dependent upon the current
Commodore situation, as this computer is custom chipset independent.

Graphic output is delivered using the Retina BLT over a direct bus with
data rates of over 20MB/second.  The second direct 32 bit bus is for the
optional DraCo version of the real-time VLab Motion JPEG non-linear editor.
With VLab Motion installed, data rates of up to 100% JPEG are standard.
This allows 2:1 JPEG data rates, the highest possible.  At these data rates
the highest qualities of video can be edited and produced.

The first release of DraCo will be a full size tower with a minimum of 4MB
expandable to 128MB of on board 72 pin SIMM modules.  The SCSI II
controller is factory equipped and is based upon the NCR 53C720.  This SCSI
II device (used on the Warp Engine) guarantees the highest data rates with
a maximum of free CPU time.  This SCSI controller allows the connection of
internal and external SCSI devices.  A parallel port and triple speed
CD-ROM drive will also be included in every model.  Floppy drives are not
included, but SCSI floppies can be used.  Transfer of software from
existing Amiga platforms is easily accomplished using the SCSI or over a
parallel net.

DraCo will be available in numerous memory and hard drive configurations. 
Pricing is not yet determined, but will be comparable to a similarly
equipped Amiga 4000.  Owners of the Retina and VLab Motion products will
receive attractive upgrade prices directly from NoahJi's.

                         --- End press release --

Interesting innit ?  Will they really market the first Amiga clone ?  I
guess if they do and succeed (Also taking the software publishers with
them), then this will be a clear sign for Amiga Inc.  (whoever it may be by
then), that you can very well have a certain break in compatibility and
still sell a good product and get support form third party manufacturers. 
(Hey, Apple can do it...).

Anyhow, enough for today.  As I said, there isn't really much else to write
about at the moment.

P.S.  A big hello to Kiko from Japan, I hope that everything works out and
you get your Cyberstorm before Christmas.

Hi ALL.

What follows is my description of the World of Amiga Show in London.  I
went on Saturday 10th December and stayed for 5 1/2hrs.  Anyone who doesn`t
like long posts, please skip this.

[Disclaimer: what follows is entirely my own thoughts and opinions]

            WORLD OF AMIGA SHOW - Wembley 9-11th December 1994

         Big Thumbs up: Cybervision64, Cyberstorm060, Photogenics
         Thumbs up:        PC emulation on emplant
         Thumbs down:      PicolloSD64.

Well, what a show.  At first glance the show seemed to look a little bare
but in actual fact there was quite a lot going on.  My first question to be
answered was "does the PC emplant exist".  I made it to the Blittersoft
stand and there was Jim Drew, a rather large CBM monitor and his emplant.

EMPLANT:
-------

 Standing at the back of the crowd, I could just see the emplant up and
running on Jim`s emplant+ warp 40/040+ picasso.  At this time it was
running rather nicely the MAC emulation - no big deal.  After a patient
wait, Jim shutdown the Mac emulation (interestingly enough he was running
V5.0 of the emulation and when he shutdown it asked him to insert his hard
drive.....).  Then came the good part - the PC emulation.  Jim clicked on a
similar icon to the MAC startup icon and started up the PC emulation.  The
emulation went straight into the Ami-bios (which according to Jim is
shipped with every version of PC-emplant).  He showed that it recognised
every bit of PC hardware.  He then moved to the dos prompt and listed
directories on the HD and then started showing bench marks and testing
programs.  He showed that all the hardware test came up ok.  The speed
tests varied.  One said that the processor was running at 0mhz, another
showed it was a 286 running at ~20mhz (this was probably closer to the
truth).  I was desperate to see Windows but alas, the version Jim had with
him didn`t have any VGA support and therefore no Windows, or anything
really good to show.  I asked if he had dos apps to show but he said no and
that most people wanted to see benchmark programs.  All in all the
emulation seemed to be running well and quite fast.  It was on a native
Amiga screen and the updates were instant, but then the PC uses planar in
4bit colour and his machine did have a 68040/40mhz.  I would say everything
seemed well.  Jim pointed out that the emluation was runnning in
interpreter mode and that the one that compiles will run a lot faster.  He
also said that when the PC emplant ships it will run DOOM.  Now for the
best bit, Jim gave an announcement on the realease date of the PC emplant:

  The PC emplant will start shipping, mid January (So Jim Drew says)!

 I asked Jim whether the PC emulation would run OS2/Warp and he said yes. 
I asked wether my OS2/Warp CDROM would install ok and he said yes!  Oh, I
asked whether the 586 emulation contained the fp bug from the pentium :-),
"no" was the reply.  I also asked whether the Cyberstorm 060 would work
with the emplant and Jim said yes.

 Some other interesting bits.  Jim also had an emulation called ACE (atari
console emulation) which was a Atari 400/800 emulator.  He had masses of
software on his hard drive and showed of a Lucasfilm demo.  I asked why
this emulation wasn`t available yet as I love the Atari 800Xl and he said
"the sprite collision isn`t working yet" and then he went on to say "oh, we
have implented sprites at all", hmmm - pretty fundemental point I think. 
Anyway, it all looked good and I can`t wait to see that running on my
machine.  He also had an Apple ][ emulation which was running games, the
one I saw was galaxians. 

 Jim also announced that they are going to release the PC emulation for the
PowerPC MACS at the same time as the Amigas one and that it would be
shipped with all new PowerMacs instead of softwindows - time will tell.

 Jim seemed to impress lots of people with what his emulation could do and
rightly so.  I chuckled at one point though, when he was playing with
photoshop and the MAC crashed, requiring a restart. 

 I never saw more than one emulation running at a time but I`ve read
another post where a guy saw the Pc and Mac running at the same time.
Overall at the end of this I got a plus on the feelgood factor for owning
an emplant.


Picollo SD64:
------------

 On the same stand they had the Picollo SD64 which was running on a Warped
A4000.  I don`t know why but they only had it displaying on a 14" monitor
and I had a play.  The Workbench was only running in 8 colours and an
attempt to change that to 256 colours failed as there was something running
which couldn`t be quit.  I was then shown a 256 colour graphics program and
had a play with that.  I was very dissapointed.  It was a small screen
running in 256 colours and when I moved just a small window containg a
picture it seemed very slow and I could see the redraw.  I was then shown
the viewer on an EGS default screen and things seemed a lot faster.
Overall though things didn`t seem that impressive.  Strangely enough
Blittersoft weren`t making a big thing of the board.  Maybe the software
requires some tweaks, possibly the 256 colour screen was running in Planar
mode? 


Next was on to the Gordon Harwood Stand where Phase5 were showing off two
new products the Cybervison64 and the Cyberstorm 060. 


Cybervison64:
------------

 Phase5 had the Cybervision running on a 040/40mhz machine with a 20" Apple
trinitron display.  They were showing a Workbench screen in 1024x768 256
colours but they had the workbench set to 1024x1536 so it would annonyingly
scroll as you reached the bottom of the screen, however it scrolled with
ease.  The speed of this card was very nice.  I moved windows around with
ease and all in a 1024x768 - 256 colour environment.  The screens were all
dragable, and at one point I had 3 screen all at the same time.  
Unfortunately, the software still mucks up the palettes between screens.
It would be nice if the software could alter the palettes of background
screens to "best match" colours from the palette of the front screen.  The
demonstrator loaded up ProPage4 to show me the speed of the text in that
environment.  He set the screen to 256 colours, zoomed in on the text and
you could move round the document with ease, in fact the text flied by.
There was a big problem here, though.  Half of the text didn`t get
displayed for some reason.  The German demonstrator said that they knew
about this and it wasn`t just a problem with their boards but ProPage seems
to much up a few of the RTG boards around.  I don`t use ProPage but if you
do, check out the problem before considering a purchase.  The price of this
64 bit graphics card: 299 UK pounds ~=$450 US.  Howeveri, if you ordered
one at the show or asked to be sent details you could get the board for 285
UK Pounds.  The board will be available in Febuary and ships with 2megs of
ram, upgradeable to 4megs.  It will do 1280x1024 in 8bit and 800x600 in
24bit all non interlaced.  Comes with a pass through connector as well.  I
filled in a form for details of the board when it is available.


Cyberstorm 060:
--------------

 The cyberstorm 060 was on display for everyone to see, there was one in
the machine and one outside.  The Cyberstorm 060 is just the same as the
040 Cyberstorm except for the CPU Module part (The basic Cyberstorm comes
in 3 bits).  They were just running animations which were running at high
speed.  I asked to play with the workbench and that I did.  Not much to see
here.  They didn`t have any apps so I couldn`t really see the thing perform
in real life but they did have AIBB running and that was flying through the
tests such as the beach ball etc.  Overall I think it showed the machine to
be running about 3-4 times that of the A4000/040 but it could have been
more.  Obviously code written for the 060 would run a lot faster but then
the Amiga`s OS isn`t written for 060 so we can stay with the basic speed. 
Overall though, the cyberstorm gave a very good impression.  The machine
seemed fast and the bench marks showed the machine running extremely fast.
They have bench marking figures which show the A4000 at 15.4mips and the
060 at 82.19 mips.  This is, however, for a 10million iteration program.
If it is only using the same instruction then the speed will be a little
false as this would only show the speed of execution inside the chips
cache.  Sysinfo showed the board running at 39.85 mips (A4000/040- 19.1
mips).  Real world tests with AdPro, Imagine and lightwave all showed the
board to run 3-4 times that of the A4000.  Memory reads and writes are also
about 4X the speed of a stock A4000/040.  Considering that the Cyberstorm
runs 040/40 runs about 2X the speed of a stock A4000/040 (except for memory
access which is a lot faster) you can get an idea of the speed you will
see. 

 The literature pointed out that Bench mark programs do not run correctly
on the 060. 

 Everything seemed to be running ok on the Cyberstorm and there were no
crashes. 

 Now for the good part.  The Cyberstorm will be released in Febuary
(Motorolla willing) and will be intially released with a 50mhz part as
shown at the show (a 80mhz version will follow).  The cost of this little
speed demon: 1000 UK pounds - ~=$1500 US.  Now this is 200 pounds, ~=$300
less than the cost of the current Warp 040/40mhz although the board does
lack scsi-2.  I was told that the scsi-2 option (basically the same
technology as the fastlane) will cost 200 UK pounds.  For those ordering at
the show, the price was 950 pounds for the card.


Photogenics:
-----------

 Next was another piece of amazing software.  Photogenics is a brand new
image manipulation program from Alamthera in the UK.  Primarily written by
a guy called Paul Nolan (who I met) it basically takes images and you can
apply various operations to them (such as blur, tint, etc).  There are
loads of operations that can be done.  The program can loads a wide variety
of formats including Jpeg & gif, it can also create Plasma and ripple
images.  The best part is that the program is designed to work with 2
images.  You can load one as a primary and one as a secondary and then do
all sorts of weird operations to merge the two together and rub through
etc.  The program primarily works in a superbly fast Ham-8 mode and all the
pictures are kept in their own windows.  The speed at which this program
works is superb and the speed at which the windows dynamically resize is
quite amazing.  I went to a full demonstration by Joylon Ralph and I was so
impressed with the demonstration and also when I got to play with the
program that I bought a copy.  It sells for 54.95 UK Pounds ~= $83 US.
Although at the show it was available for 49.95 pounds with a free
tee-shirt.  See later for my impression of the program once I got it home.


Theatre:
-------

 I went to two sessions at the Amiga Theatre.  The first was for
Photogenics and Joylon Ralph managed to impress all with this wonderful
program.  His A1200 did crash when he loaded photgenics :-) the first time.
It`s never crashed for me however.

 The second session I went to was a "meet the developers" thing.  Jim Drew,
a guy who worked on an interesting gadget for the CD32, Joylon Ralph and a
guy from Digita.  The guy from Digita didn`t impress me much as he had more
to say about the PC/Windows than he did the Amiga.  He said the only
software company out there was Microsoft and that we have to face reality.
I like to think that photogenics was more reality although this will be
ported to the MAC and PC.  Joylon said that a professional version of
Photogenics would be available next year.  Jim was asked several questions
about the PC emplant and gave some very good answers as he always does.  He
mentioned that they do have a multiprocessor accelerator board that they
will resume work on but they need more employees and they can`t seem to get
enough.  He mentioned later that they only have 2 working 060 processors. 
The guy who had produced a widgit was a cheery sole.  He was from Canada
and his widget is used for interactive banking and other things.
Apparently his company, TVI, has sold 1,000 CD32`s to a Canadian Bank for
customer use.  One of the news articles that I read said they were testing
the project with 100 of the banks customers and if this went well then it
would be offered to all 200 thousand of their customers -here`s hoping. 

 They were asked an interesting question.  What would you do with 12
million UK Pounds.  I think Joylon wanted to spend some and retire.  Jim
Drew who claims he can retire a rich man now said that 12 million was a
hell of a lot and that he could make good use of it.  He said that these
days you could turn hardware out in a day, make changes and have a new
board out the next day.  He also mentioned that 1000 square feet pre
employee at West Chester was a waste.  In fact, thinking back, Jim had a
lot to say, in fact he never stopped talking the whole time I saw him.  I
think he likes the Amiga.

 On thing they all seemed united on was that the Amiga has a fantastic OS
and that they love using it.  The guy from TVI said that all his employees
use Amigas.  Jim said that the work for the Mac PC emplant was primarily
done on the emplant MAC module.


Other Stuff:
-----------

 One other thing Jim mentioned was that they asked Adobe if they (UU) could
port Adobe Photoshop for free to which Adobe declined.  UU then demaned
that they port it and Adobe refused.  Adobe said that they have loads of
patents on their operations in the program and they don`t want the code
ported.

 Keiron Summer?  was showing an Indian guy the emplant and talking about
the Indian Government.  The guy was impressed with the emplant but then I
think Jim could have done a good job at selling ZX81`s at the show.

 Ramiga were at the show with lots of Amiga equipment although there stand
made it quite difficult to enter.  I didn`t spend much time here.  I did
notice that they had rather a lot of Super Buster Chips Rev11 for 19.95 UK
pounds.

 Villiage Tronic had a big stand but as the Cybervision was on display I
didn`t spend much time looking at their products.  They and many other
stands were displaying an awful lot of OS3.1 kits. 

 There were bargains to be had with CDROM`s.  In fact there were a lot of
CDROMS to be bought.  For the CD32 you could buy Guardian for 10 pounds. 
 
 Newtek were there, well sort of.  There was 1 guy with a projector.

 One star of the show was a video of "The Wrong Trousers" playing direct
from a hard drive with DPS and the personal animation recorder.

 Hisoft had a new version of Twist, Twist 2 which is a relational database.
It looked quite good.  I asked them about a C++ upgrade to SASC but they
didn`t know much about it and asked me to phone the office on Monday.

 ICL were selling warranties.

 Paragon had the new CD32 Gamer out with a full game on the cover -
Lamborghini Challenge - 10 UK Pounds.

 White Knight seemed to have a low key stand which suprised me.  They sell
a lot of products but were concentrating on the Digital Broadcaster.  This
may have been due to their recent move. 


Conclusion
----------

Well, as I said at the start, the show seemed a little bare but there was
lots of new stuff to see and drool over.  The show did seem a little
unprofessional but then money is tight at the moment.  From what I could
see and hear, CBM were making sure that they spoke to all the right people
e.g.  Jim Drew and Phase5.  They were also trying to impress what seemed
some big customers.

One thing I did pick up from the Americans at the show, that we would all
be better off if CEI did not get the Amiga.  I`ve heard this before
actually from other sources and someone pointed out that we only ever hear
from Alex and that he never says no.  Joylon Ralph said that they haven`t
returned any of their calls or faxes.  Now I`m no fan of CBM UK but I came
away from the show not knowing what to think.  I do know that at the moment
nothing is happening so whatever happens can`t be worse than nothing.


Photogenics - what is it like:

 Well I got photogenics home and I couldn`t get it to run.  The
registration number given was wrong.  As it turned out it required an extra
digit.  I must have spent about 1/2hr trying to figure it out.  I tried
several combinations and discovered that the requestor would take 1 more
digit than the length of my number.  I managed to get in my adding a 3 to
the end of the registration number. 

 I loaded the program and as I have an A4000/030/ 25mhz (the machine at the
show was a 50mhz 030) and I was running a dblpal screen (my monitor doesn`t
sync down to 15khz) the program was running quite a bit slower than the
demostration at the show.  However after a few hours I was starting to have
some fun.  It does appear however, that whatever resolution you goto the
images still display in a low res ham8 format.  The resolution of the real
picture is kept though.  It would be nice if you could display the pictures
at their real resolutions.

 I had some great fun with the ascii saver although it seems to create
pictures which are twice the height they should be so you have to reduce
the height of your image before saving.

 Some of the run through effects are great and there are several different
brushes such as spray can, pastel, felt tip pen and pencil.  If you`re
looking for a fun image manipulation program with lots of effects than this
could be for you.

 The program stores all images in 24bit in memory and dispays in ham8.  I
did find that this seemed to degrade my Ham8 pictures when redisplaying
them.

 The number of loaders is extensive, including jpeg, iff, gif, iff-deep,
cdxl and also Photo CD pictures :-).

 If you have a stock A1200 this program will run slowly.  I would start off
with at least a 25mhz 030. 

 At 55 pounds this program is a steal and a hell of a lot of good fun.  If
you want to add some effects to your pictures easily then this is a good
tool.  With the program being this good the proffessional version should be
really good.


This is Si (Simon) signing out. Please email me if you want to discuss any of
the above. I have the product sheet on the Cyberstorm 060 and Cybervision64.

===========================================================================

        The World of Amiga show is the first major Amiga show here in the
UK since the demise of Commodore.  We visited the show on the last day of
the three (Sunday), and after walking around most of the Wembley complex we
happened upon Exhibition Hall 1 and went in...

        The whole show took place within one large hall, with the centre
being dominated by the large "Amiga" stand.  Here lies the main difference
between this show and those that have been held previously - there didn't
really seem anyone in charge of the main exhibit.   Previously Commodore
owned the centre exhibit and had at least a small booth manned with people
giving out Commodore literature.  This time, nothing.  The Amiga stand
itself was home to many CD32s, a wall of TVs and a car but no "Amiga"
employees.  Needless to say, there wasn't any new Commodore hardware on
show at this stand, although Workbench3.1 and some new A1200s could be
found on nearby stands.

        The story gets stranger though, as upon walking in everyone was
presented with a genuine Commodore bag (complete with Commodore
chicken-head logo) and there was a stand selling "official Commodore
merchandise".  Even the less observant visitor couldn't help but notice
that there was something a bit strange afoot in the Commodore household.
Attendance seemed healthy, not so busy that you couldn't move and not
deathly quiet; I don't know how this compared to the previous two days.

        Newtek were one of the first stalls you saw as you entered, and
were showing a looping video of various industry graphics gurus extolling
the virtues of Lightwave.  No actual machines were to be found on the
Newtek stand though, Amiga or otherwise.  Next to Newtek were DPS, showing
their Personal Animation Recorder as well as demonstrating some of the
Video Toaster's realtime video effects, something which we don't see too
much of in the UK.

        Lightwave itself was to be found amply demonstrated elsewhere
though, none better that on the RAMIGA / ACE stand.  Here John Allerdyce
was showing off the Tower Assault intro and outro animation sequences (no
need to play the game, now I've seen how it ends :)) while John's Raptor
stood menacingly by.

        Staying with graphics, Almathera were demonstrating and selling
their new "Photogenics" image manipulation package.  This really does look
like an excellent program and at a price of 49pounds (show price) it seemed
to be selling like hot cakes.  Photogenics allows the loading and saving of
many common file formats, real media painting tools (Chalk, Felt tip,
Crayon ...) and special effects (Emboss, Distort, Rub through ...).  The
image is shown in either HAM8, 256 colour or greyscale and the program
seemed fairly fast even on a standard Amiga.   The program is entirely
modular with loaders, savers, effects and painting tools all loaded
externally - it looks a little like a baby version Adobe's Photoshop.  The
downside to the program are its requirements - Workbench3.0 or later, an
AGA Amiga (although third party graphics cards are supported) and a fair
amount of memory (they suggest that it can be run in 2MBytes, but I'd say
4MBytes was a more sensible minimum).  Coming somewhere between a paint
package and an image processing program, this program is going to do very
well.

        Incidentally, I saw Photogenics running on a A4000/040 equipped
with a Cybervision64 graphics card - now that's really fast!

        Jim Drew was showing off the new EmplantPC software, proof that it
really does exist and it really does work.  The presentation of the setup
software seemed very similar to the Mac emulator and Jim had it running
some simple text based and CGA software.  Apparently the VGA graphics
drivers aren't finished yet so Windows was not shown running, which was a
pity as it's difficult to judge the speed of the emulation with text based
applications.  The Mac emulator was also being shown, this now looks like a
very polished product.  Emplant boards were being sold by Blittersoft at
the show (Emplant Deluxe, 299pounds) so with the cost of the PC emulator
being 99pounds the possibility of having both usable Mac and PC emulations,
SCSI port and AppleTalk for less than 400pounds this seems like good value.
Jim also had strong views on which of the 2 main players in the Commodore
buyout he supported - I'll give you a clue, it wasn't CEI.

        PC Task 3.0, Chris Hames's entirely software PC emulator, was also
on display and I saw it running Windows on a A4000/030.  A fine achievment,
but to my mind it was running too slow to be usable for anything but the
simplest of tasks.

        Digita had a large stand, where they were apparently showing their
new database "Datastore".  Unfortunately, I can't get excited about either
(i) Digita products or (ii) databases, so a Digita database program had me
heading straight away.

        Attendance by the UK Amiga magazines was good, with most of the
major magazines being represented.  It was also good to see some of the
minority magazines like "JAM" also present; incidentally, the show
programme was produced entirely on an Amiga by Jeff Walker of JAM magazine.
I expected more PD houses to be present (I only counted two) - I can
remember the PD houses being very popular previously.

        I can't really comment on the new games being shown, as I didn't
really pay much attention; it was noticeable though that there were
considerably less game-playing youngsters at the show than previous shows.


        Most of the software on sale was slightly cheaper than could be
obtained normally (ArtDeptPro 115pounds, Lightwave 415pounds, PageStream3
175pounds, VistaPro3 22pounds) but there were some bargains on older
software (DPaint4AGA 8pounds, Lemmings 1pound).   Hardware could also be
obtained slightly cheaper (IDE hard drives were about 10percent cheaper
than normal) and again some bargains could be found (a hand scanner for
A500 only was 30pounds).

        Well, you can't go the a show and not buy anything and so we came
away with Photogenics and VistaPro3.  All in all, a pleasant day and I hope
that in next year's show the main stand will actually belong to someone.

                 World of Amiga Show at Wembley London '94

The sysops entourage including yours truely, arrived at the show on the
first day, early so we had some time to wander around before the crowds
arrived.  Still there was a considerable cue outside of die hard Amigans
who'd travelled to Wembley from all over the Europe and beyond.  Inside
most of the exhibitors had set up early too and I was initially surprised
at how many companies had turned out to exhibit their wares to the eager
for re-assurance Amiga owners.  Largely we weren't disappointed but later I
heard of people who were.  Each to his own.

Eighty Eight exhibtors turned out but after the initial wonder around I saw
it still wasn't enough to fill the Wembley Exhibition Hall leaving it look
like the small show that it really was.  Still it's quality, not quantity.
Perhaps the first thing that surprised us was that the entrance fee was
just a pound.  Most welcome, I would guess, as many of the people turning
out to the event would be prepared to pay extra for entrance and found they
had a few more pounds to spend inside the show.

Walking straight in, the first stand I saw held a few computers that the
public could use demonstrating some software.  YOWZA!  It was DOPUS 5!  Yep
and the kindly fellow Australian demonstrating it was non other than
Jonathan Potter himself.  The system is now multi-window and you can run
Dopus 5 as the default public screen.  Displays your drives as icons; when
first seeing this I thought it was on the workbench screen and I have to
say, I wouldn't have thought much improvement COULD be done to Dopus but
this is revolutionary!  Needless to say I hit Jonathan up for for a review
copy...  With luck you'll see a full review in AReport early in the new
year.

Moving on, Ramiga International were displaying the Raptor Plus rendering
at some ridiculous rate.  Multiprocessor MIPS RISC RS4600/133 Mhz beast...
Sigh.  They'll soon have these on a Trapdoor card for the 1200.  :-) Some
more VERY interesting products are the Ramiga Tower Systems: The Z7 A4000
Tower features 7 Zorro III slots, 2 Video slots and 5 PC slots, 6 5.25"
Drive bays and 4 3.5" bays.  The Z5 A1200 Tower comes with 5 Zorro II slows
and 3 5.25" bays and 5 3.5" bays.  Power supply and cables provided.  Not
clear on extra details or prices.  You can be sure I'll be find out ASAP! 
Ramiga were also displaying the Mongoose 50Mhz '030 1200 Trapdoor unit.
Go-faster boards for the 1200 were in great proliferation around the show
and getting cheaper.

The Silicon Studio was also on display at Ramigas stand.  Being a full
workstation kit based around the A4000T it's puzzling to know what they're
going to DO for A4000Ts since just a few were made.  Still THEY had one and
very nice it looked too!  :-) Seriously though, it consists of a fully
configured system being a 4000T with a Warp Engine, 16 MB of RAM, about 3GB
of storage etc but the actual card is capable of 20bit audio, 120dB dynamic
range and 128x oversampling.  These sort of figures indicate the whole
shebang is aimed at the professional studio being able to mix 16 channels
at once.  Nice to see yet more serious Amiga hardware.  Looks like a
winner.

The front part of the show seemed to be dedicated to the serious aspect of
the Amiga and it has to be said...  There was a greater presence in this
area than the low-end market that many are afraid C= UK will doom the
market to.

Opposite, Village-Tronic were shifting copies of OS 3.1 at a rapid rate of
knots when I walked in...  Reason?  All the other show exhibitors were
buying them to re-sell at the same show!  I kid you not!  The same was
occuring with the Picasso II-RTG 24 bit graphics boards which are back with
a vengeance after a disturbing dry spell in their production.  Practically
half the exhibitors had a stock of OS3.1 kits and Picassos so unfortunately
there were NO deals to be had with the Picasso going for 300 UK Pounds.
Most disturbing since they sold out of the entire first production run,
selling more units than an equivalent PC manufacturer might sell VGA cards
and yet the price is STILL nearly TEN TIMES the cost.  I feel that if they
had been 150 pounds or even 200 they would have shifted them ALL.  I asked
the director if they are considering making a Zorro III unit.  'Maybe...
We are seeing what happens to the Amiga.' which is fair comment, I guess,
but then the other manufacturers aren't holding back.  <growl> Still they
DID have 'Ariadne' a new Ethernet card which will be greeted with whoops
for joy.  Sana-II compatible and complete with Commodores Envoy, it's sure
to be a seller...  Again I couldn't get a price out of them at the time.  ?

Am-Power were demonstrating Aladdin 4D compiled with the Inmos Parallel C
compiler running on a mini-tower of Warp-III Inmos units.  Mr Ambigabathy
(!), the director, claimed that it was possible to reach 12,000 MIPS with
enough boards.  The rendering times with 6 CPUs were in the order of 10
times quicker than an A4000/040.  He said deals were being made with NewTek
to port Lightwave to the Warp-III platform.  Looks very promising and cost
effective.  TVI Interactive systems showed the teleview home-banking
product that uses a custom 2400 baud Modem and remote and a CD32 to provide
a plug and go solution...  Rumours were that words were being said to UK
companies to bring the unit to Europe.

Hi-Soft had a very pleasant surprise for the A1200 owning public.  They
demonstated a prototype of 'The Squirrel' a SCSI-2 Interface for the A1200
that fits into the PCMCIA slot and is capable of hitting 3MB/s with an '030
accelerated unit.  It's a normal PCMCIA card with a cable flowing out the
side sporting a 50W SCSI connector on the end.  Not sure exactly where this
unit will fit in the market as for the 69 UK pound asking price, SCSI
interfaces for the leading accelerator boards can be purchased and not tie
up the PCMCIA slot.  Still it's a nice unit based on the nippy 5380
controller chip and should be available early in the new year.

Power Computing, one of the largest Amiga hardware companies in the UK,
were selling their entire range including The Warp Engine, the 28 or 40Mhz
'040 accelerator for the A4000.  The price for this unit was astronomical
and at twelve hundred UK pounds it's a JOKE compared to the Phase 5
Cyberstorm I'll cover a little later.  The Tandem IDE/CD interface card for
Zorro equipped machines was shifting with many Amiga users opting to buy
el-cheapo PC CD-Roms rather than SCSI units.  They were also showing the
Power Super XL drive which can store 3.5MB of data on a a High density
floppy disk.  At 100 UK Pounds it's not cheap but making backups on such a
drive could work out quite cheap.  I expect it'll use the same Power
buffering technology since the Amiga can't handle the data rate the stock
mechanisms produce.  The full Viper range were shown but in my opinion,
they should be keenly avoided having a very bodgy logic interface leading
to disappointing performace. 

One stand I spent some time at was the Phase 5 stand.  Phase 5 are an
innovative German company responsible for the Blizzard range.  They've been
known to offer good value for money and their recent products are NO
exception.  The item that drew me to the stand quicker than Saddam to a
Scud was an an obtrusive logo on a large PGA chip.  *060* Yep...  It was
THERE and I *TOUCHED* it.  If I die tommorow I can rest at ease knowing I
forfilled my fantasy.  :-) Yep the Cyberstorm '060 is ONE HELL OF A BEAST.
Currently fitting only in an A4000, I hassled the Phase 5 blokes (who were
real cool guys) wether if I hacked apart my A3000, it would work.  They
said 'probably' so ...  Now to find the 950 quid to grab one quick smart! 
82 MIPS <froth> You read correct.  The Cyberstorm '060 is CHEAPER than ANY
40Mhz '040 based board so I don't think a great deal of Warp Engines were
purchased that day!  The units are to be availble in February and the CPU
can be quickly and easily changed from the 50Mhz to a 66Mhz when it becomes
availble.  It can be run now with an '040 at any rate.  Impressive. 
Apparently Motorolla are to manufacture a *90* MHz unit before too long. 
Ouch!  However, the bad news is that the CPU is missing 64 bit
multiplication and some other key instructions so a new exception library
is needed but Phase 5 have come to the rescue with some brilliant code
patching software.  First time that the CPU hits some unsupported
instructions they are patched to ones the '060 DOES support.  This was
demonstrated on the AIBB beach ball render test.  First time it ran there
was a noticable pause in the middle of the render but subsequent executions
blistered by without the pause.  Neat.  Fast?  Hell this thing was
rendering the beach ball before my machine would have STARTED.  I WANT ONE
NOW!  Sigh.

Also due in February is the Cybervision 64.  A Zorro III 64-bit graphics
card available in 2 or 4MB of RAM.  Hardware Planr-to-Chunky pixel
conversion using RoXXler chip, proper electronic switching of Amiga video
output.  Digital shared memory/video bus so that MPEG and JPEG cards can be
added later.  Seemless Monitor installing into the OS display database etc.
This card looks NICE and the best bit?  It's the SAME PRICE AS THE PICASSO!
Phase 5 are doing the card for 285 UK Pounds NOW if you'll wait for
delivery until February...  Sheesh.  Is the Pope Catholic?  I could really
get to like these Phase 5 blokes!

BlitterSoft and Utilities Unlimited were demonstrating their latest pride:
Infact Jim Drew himself was demonstration the e586DX Emulation module for
the famous Emplant card.  It was shown running Windoze software which
seemed a bit odd...  Surely they want someone to BUY the thing?  :-)
Seriously, it's claimed that you can run DOS, OS/2, NT, Windoze and even
Chicago on the board but it wasn't possible for me to tell if the
demonstration was working at a useable speed.  :-(

Almathera ia another sucessful and diligent UK based company that
specialises in CD compilations of PD, CD32 projects and ripping my ideas
off.  (oops!) released Photogenics at the show.  This looked VERY
impressive indeed and a couple of friends walked off with copies.  It's a
very good 24-bit paint program and image processor that's very impressive
in it's speed of operation and ease of use.  Something I'm going to look at
more closely though it's aimed more at users of HAM8 rather than 24 bit
board users.  Has a potentially massive market with it's real time HAM8
paint modes.  It cause quite a stir and it wasn't the only Almathera stir.
They were selling Nakamitchi 7 CD changers for 350 UK pounds and sold the
lot very quickly.  Instantaneously would be more accurate...  Interesting.
Naturally NewTek were there, pushing stand-alone Lightwave 3D.  Difference
is the pamphlets are saying 'MUTLI-PLATFORM' with words like PC and SGI
written on it.  Ouch.  I guess it had to happen.  NewTek moving into the
real world.  Brings a tear to your eye doesn't it?  Still luckily there's
the usual group of pamphlet pushing VERY lovely girls to comfort me.  :-)

Digital Processing Systems were showing the PAR DPS doing amazing things
like playing live video off HD.  Their stall was packed all day which is no
surprise considering the fantasic animations they were displaying...  The
Studio 16 was also present but not being on demo as far as I could see.  Of
couse all the UK Amiga magazines turned out in force for stands being CU
Amiga, Amiga Format and the bevvy of Pargon publications but Internet and
Comms Today was conspicuously missing.  JAM, the amateur Amiga produced
Amiga fanzine was there and attracting some attention amongst the
Amigaphiles who didn't know it existed.  It SHOULD be ON the shelf in my
most humble of opinions.

It was noticed by some aquaintances that they weren't approached by a
single UK magazine during the duration of the show.  Dave Collins of the
Multi-media machine stand said, 'Sales were fairly slow on Friday but on
the Saturday the French arrived and promptly bought everything we had'.
The Multi-Media Machine provides a CD authoring service entirely for the
Amiga market and also makes custom Multi-media presentations in stand-up
cabinets plus pub games machines.  A young company that's thriving on the
Amiga scene primarily because they've diversified using Amiga technology to
the full.  Seemed that it took some time for everyone to realise they were
flogging CDs loaded with Amiga games for a fiver each.  When they DID...

Not one English magazine approached us but many of the French magazines
came to see us and the other exhibitors' said Dave.  This seemed indicitive
of the attitude of the English Magazines.  Aimed squarly at the low-end of
the market showing no interest in the higher end.  The large turn-out of
professionals investigating the high end hardware explains why the American
Amiga World magazine is regarded as the best choice in such circles. 
ICPUG, the Commodore user club, stashed right next to the door; displayed a
linear progression of Commodore models with the PET taking the most
prominent position with many people peering closely at the ancient item of
Commodore history.  I was surprised how many people didn't KNOW what it
was.  Maybe I'm getting old?  :-)

The show Theatre held a variety of public demonstrations and seminars by
various companies throughout the day though I didn't have time to see them.
Finally the central Amiga stage held a variety of performaces throughout
the day but just as they were firing up, the sysops retired to the bar and
began to drink themselves senseless before embarrasing themselves at the
Developers Conference...  Which is another matter entirely.

All in all, I feel it was a good show.  Good turn out of exhibitors with
new products dispite the uncertain future of the platform.  There was
certainly no lack of confidence to be seen.  These companies wouldn't
bother if they didn't think that everything wasn't going to come though.

Hi there!

Alright, since there are many of you wanting to know...
I went to the show and saw David Pleasance ;) 

Anyway, more of the man later...

The best NEW thing out there that you can really buy has to be the new
software by Almathera.  Photogenics -- "The ultimate 24bit graphic and
manipulation package".  I must really say that this is the works as
compared to PhotoShop on the Macs!  It features: natural paint tools-
airbrush, pencil, etc; multiple images editing - each in a resizable HAM8
window; Undo/Redo; previews; multiple file formats - IFF, JPEG, GIF, BMP,
PCX, ASCII, PBM, QRT, RAW, RGB8, RGBN, Opalvision, Picasso 2, Vlab; runs on
AGA 1200/4000, alpha-channel, open architecture, drag & drop; lots of
effects - Adddust, noise, alterhue, balance, blur, cloner, deinterlace,
displacemap, emboss, false colour, flip XY, gradient, greyscaale,
highlights, huemap, line art, masking paint, matrix, mono, motion blur,
negative, paint, pixelise, randomise, rub thru, rubmix, saturation,
sharpen, shifthue, shiftRGB, sloarise, Tile & Tint.  etc.  I got myself a
copy too...but....  (see below)

It requires KS3.0 with 2MB RAM, those A2000 & A3000 owners who upgraded and
own a graphics card should be alright.  No EGS though, maybe that will come
later??

Now we reach the slot for BEST NEW hardware which you can see but can't
buy.  That awards go to the Cyberstorm System developed by Phase 5 Digital
products.  They are only demoing in the show so no chance of carrying it
back with you.  Even when it is out, only A4000 owners will be in luck
because they are waiting and see iff the response is good before they bring
out the A3000 and A4000T.  The basic system is actually 3 boards: the
interface card, cpu card and the memory card.  The interface will include a
socket for a Ethernet Boot Rom or Flash Rom.  The CPU is prepared for
speeds up to 80MHz ( the present 68060 is only 50MHz ) and will have an
expansion port for future DSP boards.  The Memory card uses 4 32bit 72pins
slots for a maximum of 128MB with Z3 DMA access and data transmission rate
of 50MB/s is possible with standard 60ns DRAMS.

Further expansions include a I/O card and a SCSI card.  The SCSI planned
will be a SCSI 2 Fast interface with full DMA channel amd FIFO buffered. 
Software will include CD-ROM FS and Cache prog.  The I/O card includes all
these plus ethernet connection and a RS232 serial.

Phase 5 is also developing the Cybervision64 card using S3 Trio64 chip with
a RoXXIer chip for hardware Planar2Chuncky conversion.  The expected
resolution is 800x600 24bit Noninterlaced and 1024x768 24bit interlaced. 
Software include WB emulation and support libraries.

No PCMIA Emplant.....  the E586 module for emplant is only taking orders as
it hasn't shipped here yet.  They were demoing it, but when I was there,
the damned machine wasn't doing anything and lots of people are crowding
around asking questions about the PCMIA emplant....so I can't see if there
is a valid claim in "Pentiumable" performance ;)

Blittersoft are showing off the Micronik 3000T/4000T cases.  They go at RRP
400 ukp each.  I was more interested in the 1200T but they told me that
they can get it for me within a week if I wanted one.  The biggest obstacle
I can see in that offer is the price, approx 600 ukp!  They will only do it
on per order basis.

Village Tronics are there too, selling stuff like Picasso-II (very
popular), Ariadne, OS3.1, etc.

I also saw PC Task 3.0, Termite among numerous other softwares.

And of course the other stuff that invariably makes up a Amiga show,
Lightwave, PAR, Broadcast systems, Rombo products, Magazines, bouncing
castles, one arm jacks, PDs, games, and more games, etc.

Tuck in one corner is a booth selling out what I believe to be liquidation
stock!  Single sync VGA 14' monitors going for 40 ukp a throw!  CDTVs, 5
1/4 external FDD, keyboards, etc.  All Commodore manufactured!!

I was then when I saw DP.  People weren't exactly rushing to ask him
questions, so that is why I got the chance later!  Anyway, from most of his
replies to another guy who was into the high-end of the Amiga macines, it
was depressing.

The main thing that he said, other than constanly repeating the phrase "It
is very positive", was that he will be concentrating on the consumer home
market.  He said things like the A1200 and CD32 was what kept the Commodore
going and Amiga is basically a consumer home computer who happens to have
some special high-end machines (I paraphrase, not his exact words!).  But
he did reassured that guy that A4000 will still be continued to be
developed.  He further says that he is expecting the Hombre chip to be
ready in 2 years time, and until then, the lower-end will be his focus.

OK, now my time!!!  Knowing how anxious you people are, I asked the all
important question.  (Don't kill me if it isn't, nobody told me what was
anyway!)

I asked him whether if he is going to host an IRC conference on the
Internet cause his main rival, Alex Amor of CEI has done it twice already.
Know what did he said???

He said, and I quote, "he has done himself a disservice" and that he should
not have discussed with everybody as the creditors do not want it.  And
then he says, "in fact, he (Alex) has his fund withdrawn" because of this.

[Note - CEI reports that they did not indeed lose their financial backing.
-- Ed.]]

Now, I really don't know what the hell all that was about as I really don't
what to say after that.  I thanked him for my question and walked away.  I
think I feel a strong defensiveness in his last few sentences, like you
would if you had done something wrong.  Maybe I am wrong on this, but it
certainly isn't all good.

Even the latest edition of the Amiga Format Jan95 has an article that seems
to be having a laugh at DP.  I quote: "CEI are said to have made a cash
bid, including a non-refundable deposit in the order of $1 million which
guarantees Commodore creditors against reneging on the proposed
buy-out..............  ...However, this claim has been denounced by David
Pleasance as "horseshit".  "We are in pole position," he continued, " the
receiver has been in touch with me to let me know that nothing has been
agreed." At the end of the article, the writer asked, "so will the real
owners of the Amiga please stand up?" ;)

The show was rather empty, maybe because it was Friday, I might go again
tomorrow just to see if there is any more bargains.  Yep, some of the stuff
are flogged off at such low prices that it is unbelievable!  I got a copy
of Real 3D classic for just 20quid!  I thought it has a rather neat
freeform feature which was missing in my Lightwave.  So I just bought it
for the price of a game!

The day would be absolutely for an Amigoid like me if not for the same old
problems.  No Quality Control!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The Photogenics program I bought could not be used because the program
registration when you first use it doesn't accept the serial number given
on the disk!!!  This is S***!  Can't they make sure they have everything
right!!  Now I will have to go back again and ask for an exchange or
something!!!  S*** again!  The other game I bought, Abandoned Places 2
won't run on my machine too!!!  S***!  It crash after the Character
generation, so I can't even play at all!!!

(sorry for the number of expletives like S***..oops, there goes one more)

Arrrgggghhhh!!!!!!!!
When will we finally find a whole set of user-friendly (machine- friendly)
software and hardware for the Amiga????????

Maybe see some of you there tomorrow on Saturday?

@toc P2

===========================================================================
==  IPISA '94 Conference Report              By:  Wouter van Oortmerssen ==
===========================================================================

INTRODUCTION

        This is a review of the IPISA '94 Conference held in Milan, Italy,
on Saturday, 19 November 1994.  'IPISA' stands for "Incontro dei
Programmatori Italiani per lo Sviluppo Amiga," which means 'Italian
Programmers' Meeting for Amiga Development.' It was organised to bring
Amiga developers from all of Italy together to meet people, exchange ideas,
and hear talks on new products/developments.

     As I was the only non-Italian (and invited speaker) at the conference,
it seemed right that I write the review.  so here it is.


PREPARATIONS

        I arrived at the Milan Airport Thursday, two days early, to meet
with members of the organisation (some of whom have been friends of mine
for quite a while), and to rehearse my talk a bit.  :-)

        The two evenings before the event, we all met at Sebastiano Vigna's
cosy little apartment, trying to arrange everything.  At times, this was
quite hectic: hundreds of disks to be organized, badges to be checked, and
generally making sure everything would be in the right place on Saturday. 
At times I was even forced to help out..  ;-)

        This might seem disorganised, but in retrospect, all was very well
organised and everything fell into place on Saturday.  The organisation did
a marvelous job on this, even in the face of such last-minute obstacles as
Pagestream 3 almost refusing to print an important printout.


THE CONFERENCE

        We arrived a little late because we could not find the conference
hall at first ("I'm sure it was around THAT corner..."), but still in time
to set up some equipment.  The conference hall was quite a large hall with
seats for 500 people, and a stage (a bit like a cross between a lecture
hall and a theatre).  On stage various Amiga's (A4000, A3000 and a CD32)
were set up for use during the talks, and one at a time could be connected
to a large (4x4 meter) screen hanging behind it.  By using large fonts, the
whole audience could enjoy whatever was demonstrated.

        At 10 o'clock, visitors were allowed to enter.  They all received a
badge with their name on it, and upon leaving the conference they would
receive the professionally printed IPISA proceedings (with articles by the
speakers and also a selection of others, among which Daniel J.  Barrett,
Andy Finkel and Urban Mueller), and a 10-disk set containing software
discussed by the speakers and a variety of other useful PD software.

        First there was an introduction by the head of the organisation,
Sergio Ruocco.  The start of the talks was delayed a bit as the first
speakers had yet to arrive.  There were quite a number of talks scheduled,
and I won't be discussing them all in full detail, but here's an
impression:

        There were various hardware related talks such as the very
interesting talk by Paolo Canali on new hardware architectures for
graphics/multimedia.  It was quite technical but supported by various clear
diagrams on the big screen, and thus very comprehensible.  Another was the
DSP system by Castellani and Sartor, which is currently very much in
development.  'OperBlitting' was about using the blitter's logical
operations to perform math on large amounts of numbers 'at once'.

        Other talks: 'WT', a show-all program in the spirit of VT,
'AnimCommander', an animation program; 'KnapDisk', a program with a clever
algorithm to fit a number of files optimally on disks; 'OLE', a system
inspired by the Windows system by the same name; mathematically inspired
talks on systems for integrals and statistics; 'Amiga Expert Team', a
presentation of a new service for Amiga users; 'Music by numbers', a quite
unusual but very interesting talk on algorithmically produced music (with
demonstrations!); and a demonstration of the MPEG module for the CD32,
which isn't all that new, but entertaining anyway.

        And of course there was my own talk, on the E language and
compiler.  I practiced quite a bit, since I can make myself understandable
in Italian, but such a large audience is something different (there were
approximately 200 people).  I finished the talk with a flashy demonstration
of the new source-level debugger for E.

        After each talk the audience could ask questions, and at the end of
all the talks there was time for all people to speak their heart out on
what bothers them most.

        Somewhere in the middle of the talks a meal was organised at the
local self-service restaurant, and at the end of the conference we all
(well, at least 100 of us) gathered at a well know pizzeria in Milan.  It
took hours for everybody got get served eventually, but that didn't matter
much as everybody was amusing themselves pretty well anyway.

        In general, IPISA succeeded very much as a social event also. 
everybody was able to meet with new people and exchange ideas.  I certainly
met more people than I can remember and had a great time with them.

THE PROCEEDINGS

        In the conference proceedings were articles by most of the speakers
on their respective subjects, and also quite a few other articles.

        Daniel Barrett reveals the latest in Fred Fish's CDROM series:
"Fish Styx", where Fred shows off his singing talents.  [MODERATOR'S NOTE:
This was a humor article.  - Dan] Andy Finkel wrote "The Amiga: how to
survive in a PC world", which gives us a profound economics lesson from the
perspective of the Amiga, and its future.  Very interesting: food for
thought.  Urban Mueller talks about yet another milestone: the 10000th file
on AmiNet, and the statistics that come with it.

        Further articles are in Italian.  From the humorously intended
"Waiting for the Powermacintosh" by Giovanni Gentile about a person that
keeps missing the boat on various Macintosh models, tempted by the Amiga,
to worthwhile reading material such as the article by Sebastiano Vigna and
Sergio Ruocco which deals with Amiga survival hints and tips on a variety
of subjects such as software, networks, programming, etc.

CONCLUSIONS

        Personally, I think the IPISA was a great success.  If you are
Italian, this certainly is a an event absolutely worth attending.  If you
don't speak Italian the current edition wouldn't have been as interesting,
as it was in Italian, and most Italians are notorious for their bad command
of the English language ;-) (though rumours have it that future editions
might be more internationally oriented).

        It scores at least 4.5 pizza's out of 5.

        The organisation was very professional, and the organisers (all 15
of them) worked very hard to make it all happen.  I'd like to thank them
here for what they did.

Well, so far I've gotten about 40 letters from readers telling me what they
would like to see in a new version of WorkBench.  I know there are a lot
more of you out there, so start typing!

Just let me know what programs you'd like to see bundled with the new
Amigas, and what cosmetic and functional improvements to the OS that you would
like to see.

Also, if you can let me know what PD utilities you currently use (if any)
to enhance the look or performance of your 'bench, I'd appreciate it. ;)


Secondly, since the most popular idea for improvement is to either use
MagicWB or NewIcons, I would like to see which is preferred.

Please send me mail letting me know if you have seen both NewIcons and
MagicWB, and which you prefer.  (It is very important that I know if you've
seen them both, to get a fair comparison.)

Harv: SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO...  PLEASE SIT BACK, RELAX, DON'T TYPE, AND
      LET ME NOW INTRODUCE KEVIN DAVIDSON, OUR WUNNERFUL SOFT-LOGIK ONLINE
      SUPPORT GUY HERE WHO WILL INTRODUCE TONITE'S WUNNERFUL GUESTS...  KEVIN?

soft-logik: Thank you.  I'm very pleased to have our two guests here
            tonight.  First wearing the Deron SLPREZ trunks, is Deron
            Kazmaier (hope I pronounced that right) Deron is the President
            of Soft-Logik Publishing and the principal designer and author
            of PageStream and his slave, Michael Loader publisher of
            Radical Type Magazine and author of the PageStream 3 manual and
            other soft-logik documents Michael is the real brains behind
            the support we offer here on Portal Gentlemen, would you like
            to make any opening remarks?

Mike-SLslave: Sure. I'm going to post some stuff for Deron.

              "Thank you for coming to tonight's conference.  I'm glad to
              have this opportunity to speak with you in person.  We don't
              have anything new to announce tonight, but we have made a
              number of announcements in the last month that I'm sure you
              will want to discuss.  I know you all have a lot of
              questions, and I'll answer them in a minute.  First, I would
              like to summarize our latest news.

              PAGESTREAM3 AMIGA.  Our main priority at this time is
              PageStream3 for the Amiga.  We are committed to finishing the
              unimplemented features and fixing any problems remaining in
              the program.  We want to make it the best desktop publisher
              possible.  Version 3.0d is being released tonight and will
              greatly improve the usability of the program."

              PAGESTREAM FOR MACINTOSH AND WINDOWS.  I hope that those of
              you who are thinking about changing computers will stick with
              your present computer until we release PageStream for
              Macintosh and Windows.  I can't tell you when they will be
              available, but we have already begun work on them.  We will
              have a very affordable upgrade path from the Amiga and Atari
              versions but pricing has not been announced.  Subsequent
              versions will add support for other machine specific
              features.  There will also be a Windows version of TypeSmith,
              our font editor.

              WORDWORTH AND DATASTORE.  We recently signed an exclusive
              licensing agreement with Digita International.
              Soft-Logik is now selling and supporting Wordworth and
              Datastore in the United States and Canada.  Wordworth 3.1 is
              the latest version of Digita's award-winning word processor,
              while Datastore is a new personal database manager.  We think
              that these programs are the best in their class and will be
              of great interest to all Amiga users.  A document filter for
              PageStream3 will be available early next year to load an
              entire Wordworth document into PageStream to preserve the
              document layout.

               MOVING.  We're moving to a new building at the end of this
               coming week.  Here's our new address and phone numbers:

              That's all the latest news. I'll let Kevin take over again now.

soft-logik: Thanks Michael...

            Before I turn the conference over for questions, I'd like to
            take a point of priviledge and ask one opening question...
            Could you summarize the highlights of tonight's PageStream 3.0d
            release?

Deron-SLPREZ: Faster text, gradient fill onscreen, and more bug fixes than
              you can shake a stick at :)

jcompton: Even though the Amiga situation isn't solved yet the Amiga will
          need more going for it than ever before when it comes back out. 
          Packed-in DTP certainly couldn't hurt.  How seriously would you
          consider striking a deal to pack PageStream in with a model or
          line of Amigas?

Deron-SLPREZ: Well, we have been bundles in England on the Atari in the
              past (long time ago).  We have always been interested, but
              DTP has never been C='s target market.  I can only offer, I
              cant lead the horse to water even in this case!

CliffG: Does Wordsworth support tables and does it have end/footnotes?  If
        not will it?

Deron-SLPREZ: Wordworth supports tables and endnotes, but no footnotes.
              Its on the wishlist, but who knows when.

soft-logik: [Note, I'll have a Wordworth and Datastore preview pack in the
            Soft - Logik vendor area here by tomorrow]

ScottJ: Deron, given the unfinished state of PageStream 3.0, why didnt
        Soft- Logik wait another quarter before releasing it?

Deron-SLPREZ: Not many more reasons other than the one in the readme when
              you install...The program has almost ever feature that 2.2
              does, and so many more, that to call it "unfinished" is only
              a half truth anyway.  Yes it doesn't do everything the manual
              says it should, but it still does a whole lot...  That 1 meg
              program is 1 meg for a reason :)

Luis & Maria: how real will be the pantone supportga

Deron-SLPREZ: The pantone support is finished, so I'm not sure what your
     asking. Could you elabrate?

Luis & Maria: yes will the display will be close to the color or it will be
              like now that you see a different shade of blue when yuo ask
              for process blu or yellow when yousk for orange

Deron-SLPREZ: We ask the system for the proper color.  If your running a 4
              color screen, you not going to get an accurate on screen rep.
              Even at 256 colors it may not be 100%.  The amiga is behind
              the times when it comes to hardware calibration of colors.
              Not much I can do about that.

TheDuck: more of a suggestion than a question, the font.spec template from
         old version 2.2 doesnt load properlly, i guess because of tags...
         will this file ever be updated?  it is the most usefull of files

soft-logik: Howard, that should be fixed (3.0d?)

Deron-SLPREZ: The 2.2 document loader has been fixed so that the tag
              problem is no longer a problem.

Harv: FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR GUESTS, HOW MANY OF YOU CURRENTLY OWN
      PAGESTREAM (ANY VERSION)?  JUST SAY "YES" OR "NO" NOW PLEASE

soft-logik: yes                   CliffG: yes
TheDuck: yes                      Jumpdisk: yes
jraGRAPHICS: yes                  Michael A Radanovich: yup
Luis & Maria: yes                 grog: no
JeffH: yes                        RickB: YES
Voltar: no                        KyleW: yes
SubDriver: yes                    jcompton: Yes
FPW: nope                         HAWK: yes

KyleW: whenever I up versions I seem to loose the color palete as in I cant
       type anytrhing that will show on screen..  is there an easy way to
       keep this from hapening and fix it ?? 

Mike-SLslave: We're not sure what you mean.  Color palettes with regard to
              text not showing???

KyleW: yes text will not show up using the default after the instalation of
       30b

Mike-SLslave: Compugraphic Intellifonts?  Ensure you have the 1.0b CG.font
              engine for PageStream3.0c and then choose Settings/Fonts.
              Select the Intellifonts path.  Click on Update.  CLick on
              Save.

soft-logik: [The FONT ENGINE update is here for downloading]

DonM: I'm a long time ProPage user that converted (trying to?) with PS 4. 
      Almost none of my PP and ProDraw files have converted successfully. 
      Is that being worked on, or is there something I didn't understand?  ga

Deron-SLPREZ: About prodraw, we just found and fixed a problem with objects
              coming in with no fill on and the line weights are ok now.
              It should be close.  About propage, we ask that simple files
              that demonstrate the problem be sent in.  We can only do so
              much without the file format.

jcompton: Follow-up to my question...you said something like "C= never made
          DTP a priority".  You won't be dealing with Commodore.  Are you
          willing to give a new company a new chance?

Deron-SLPREZ: My point was that we have worked with everyone who has wanted
              to work with us.  Why wouldn't we?

Harv: Here's a non tech question: you guys pretty much own the Amiga DTP
      market now, and you now sell a word processor.  what kind of
      competitive upgrade prices do you offer?  If it's too complicated to
      type in, please give the details to Kevin so he can post it here.
      i.e.  for owners of ppage, saxon, word perfect, prowrite, etc.  etc.

Deron-SLPREZ: PageStream3 can be had for $250 direct, or $225 for "competitive"
     upgrades.. Wordworth is $135 direct, $120 for softlogik owners.

Harv: are you going to sell some kind of "super bundle" and maybe put it on
      cd-rom?

Deron-SLPREZ: cd-rom? Not likely. Bundle, probably.

soft-logik: A POLL: HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE CD-ROM DRIVES ON YOUR AMIGA? JUST TYPE
     "YES" OR "NO"

Harv: yes                           Luis & Maria: yes
soft-logik: yes                     Drakon: yes
CliffG: YES                         Jumpdisk: yes
DonM: no                            JeffH: yes
ScottJ: Soon.                       Michael A Radanovich: no, not yet
TheDuck: as of monday  :>           SBurroughs: yes
sjn: no                             grog: no
RickB: OF COURSE                    SBurroughs: a fast yes
SubDriver: Yes

Michael A Radanovich: I bought a copy of Page stream 2.2 form a friend
                      (books, disks and all, even most of his hardware),
                      but not a registration card, because he had sent that
                      in will PageStream 3.0 be available to me as an
                      upgrade, adn if so how much $?

Deron-SLPREZ: You just need to send in a photocopy of the disks with the
              reg numbers on them, and your name and address along with the
              previous owners and they will swithc registrations and you
              can upgrade.  Just call sales at 800-829-8608 tomorrow for
              more details.

DrTed: How does the PS 3.0 unimplemented feature count and bug count
       compare to released DTP progs on other platforms...

Deron-SLPREZ: No doubt that the average release is not full of so many
              unimplemented features, however, with the death of C= our
              user base was beginning to believe that we would never ship
              the program.  We had to show everyone that we were still here
              and still working on it.  No doubt in anyones mind now what a
              great program we are working on, and like I said before, it
              still does so much more than anything else on the amiga.


Luis & Maria: will you disguise art epression to bring it to PS...  or you
              will make a nue progra...m please dont abandon art
              expressionga

Deron-SLPREZ: Since PageStream3 does so much already that would go into a
              new version of ArtExpression (like Pantone support, Arexx
              Macros, import/export, etc.  etc) We won't be doing a v2 of
              AE, but we will be coming out with an AE extension for
              PageStream that adds the 3 features that AE has.  Such as
              text on a path, text/objects in a shape, and blends.  It will
              be cheaper for us to make, and cheaper for you to buy :)

ScottJ: Any chance of PGS 3.0 supporting OS/2? If not, why not?

Deron-SLPREZ: Well, you can always run Windows programs under OS/2 (better
              windows than windows, as IBM says :), and OS/2 is third on
              our list, but we can only do so much at once.

RickB: I have been a loyal Pagestream user since 1.0 and have not been able
       to use 3.0 because it is toooooooooo slow...  I also am anoyed that
       the only way I can get the patches is thru an online service.  Why
       aren't you sending out patches to 3.0 users as a regular service?

Deron-SLPREZ: Well, about the only thing slower than PageStream2 in version
              3 is text and non-ps printing.  In case you havn't noticed,
              every version of pgs3 since version a has been at least twice
              as fast as the previous for text.  We even sped up graphics
              in 3.0d!  About the other part...as we have said, once
              everything is finished, we will update all of your users.
              But to mail disks to everyone every 3 weeks would cost way to
              much.  Mike, care to upload the notice on updates by mail?

Harv: comment: if you knew there was a new patch online, wouldn't you
      rather just d/l it in a couple minutes right now than wait 3 weeks
      for a disk to show up?  I thought most people with modems preferred
      online program patches.  shrug. 

Mike-SLslave: NEW PAGESTREAM3 UPDATE OPTION       ----   Nov 15, 1994

               A few people without modems have asked if they could buy a
               subscription to all the minor PageStream 3.0 updates rather
               than having to pay $10 for each update by mail (we always
               offer the most recent minor update on disk to customers for
               $10).  Some people with modems have asked for a similar
               option since their cost to download the updates is rather
               high.  For $30 ($40 outside of Canada and the United
               States), we will mail you each of the updates (3.0d,
               3.0e...) up to and including 3.1 (which will be mailed to
               all registered owners of 3.0 automatically).  We will send
               you the current version immediately, and then each of the
               updates as they become available.

               These update disks will be identical to the update patches
               offered here online.  Most online users will find it more
               cost-effective to continue to download each update, but for
               users who have to call long-distance to get them, this
               update subscription may be more affordable.  Getting the
               updates online is more timely, since those subscribing to
               this plan won't get them until a week after the patches are
               posted online.

               Note: We're not doing this to make a profit.  We're offering
               the update subscription for those who are without modems and
               for those who have to call long-distance to download the
               patches.

HAWK: why is there no overwrite mode ?

Deron-SLPREZ: Not much real use for it in a DTP program.  If you wish to
              replace 3 letters with 4, overwrite doesn't buy you much.
              Just hilight, and type over.  Simple.

SubDriver: I just received a (second) mailing for upgrading to 3.0 saying
           it was my "last chance"..  and that the upgrade offer "wouldn't
           last long" (or implying that) I'm a 2.2 owner.  How long will
           the upgrade offer last?  ($125 , I think?)

Mike-SLslave: The $125 upgrade offer is not expiring.  The expiration thing
              was supposed to refer to the powerup upgrade offer expiring.
              It wasn't clear, my fault.

Mike-SLslave: That mailing was sent to people who hadn't upgraded from 2.x,
              and those who owned other SL programs but not pgs.

sike-SLslave: Let me post our current pricing...

jraGRAPHICS: what direction will you be taking pagestream (and the company)
             in these new markets (i.e., audience, features, etc.)?

Deron-SLPREZ: As far as audience goes, PgS3 has a very clean interface to
              app.library, which is our Amiga specific library of
              functions.  So pgs3 really doesn't know anything about
              screens, arexx, files, modules, etc.  That is handled in
              app.library.  Same for the modules.  So we just (like thats
              an easy task :)) have to port app.library to new platforms,
              and the core codes remains unchanged.  So we can support many
              platforms with less than normal effort.  About features, I
              can't really say right now.  Why spoil the fun :)

soft-logik: Now that you're distributing WordWorth and soon Datastore, are
            there any changes anticipated in these products, or PageStream
            to make them work together better?

Deron-SLPREZ: We don't develop Wordworth or Datastore.  We just import,
              sell, and support them.  We are going to be releasing a
              document loader for wordworth that supports things like
              graphics, but more than that is just a pure fancy at this time.

              BTW, that is a pagestream document loader for loading
              wordworth docs into pagestream.

Luis & Maria: are you going to make a filter for .cdr file

Deron-SLPREZ: Its on the wishlist, but until 3.1 its nothing more than
              that.  Thats our first and only priority right now.

DrTed: A year ago in VTU, you direct sold a Publishing Pack and a Power
       Users Pack.  I bought the Power Users pack thinking I was told there
       would be a cheap upgrade to 3.0, even though not with the Pub.
       Pack.  Was I wrong??

Deron-SLPREZ: My memory is less than perfect.  Let me look up the ad..  The
              ad says on the bottom "Upgrade to PageStream3 (when
              available) is $125.

DrTed: That was for both packages???

Deron-SLPREZ: I can't see how anyone might believe otherwise when looking
              at the ad.  What are you driving at?

DrTed: Just wanted to be sure...  ..

HAWK: Is there any way to turn OFF!! that BLINKING CURSER ??? !

Deron-SLPREZ: Nope, and I might find a way to make it more annoying :)

HAWK: why! you can in Page LINER?

Deron-SLPREZ: Are you asking "might we be able to turn it off in the
              future"?  You know us programmers!  (maybe is the answer).

soft-logik: A phone-in Question from Mike Williams: How about True Type
            font support for PageStream 3?

Deron-SLPREZ: Well, since PageStream uses a modular font approach (heck,
              delete iffdoc.dfilter and you can forget about loading/saving
              documents)...  Adding support for truetype "only" requires
              writting a truetype module, but no one here has the time.
              Like I said, 3.1 is our only mission right now.  Can't start
              promissing new features yet.  However, we have asked Relog
              (the authors of TypeSMITH) if they might be intereste d.  We
              shall all have to wait and see.  Until then, typesmith works
              just fine :)

Luis & Maria: what about the 2pt.  problem when you draw a line they
              aalways come out broken in pices

Deron-SLPREZ: I'm not familiar with that problem.  I can try it out later.
              When is the 2pt line "broken"?

Luis & Maria: every time a draw a line no matter if it is in PS or AE...
              it prints in seg and if I cut the object i segments is worst,
              always with HP 4M and HP 2P

Deron-SLPREZ: I'm afraid I can't reproduce your problem with PageStream to
              ps or non-ps.  Plese send in a printout and exact steps.

DrTed: Have you been surprised at the number of people who insist on doing
       direct text entry in PS rather than using pageliner or other text
       editor???

Deron-SLPREZ: DrTed, not really. Mike uses pagestream exclusivly.

Mike-SLslave: I wrote the whole 3.0 manual in 2.2 without any text editor.

HAWK: As I ask why not a overwrite mode in pgs.  ?  PGS2.22 did and its was
      very usefull for me!  I thought that PGS3.0 was to have all the
      pgs2.0 stuff and new things?  I find that there is a lot of things
      that is not in 3.0 that was very useful

Deron-SLPREZ: OK hawk. I'll take it under advisement. GA.

RickB: So what is the target date for 3.1??

Deron-SLPREZ: RickB: Well, 3.0e should be out by christmas (probably
              christmas eve).  Our present to you.  3.1?  You want to know
              this from the man who guessed August 93 for pagestream3?  I
              really don't know.  However, I see very little left to do in
              PageStream3 to make it better than 2.x in every way.  People
              get to hung up on a version, and forget they have what we
              consider the best software written for the Amiga already.

Luis & Maria: are you going to release a driver for the Epson Color Stylus,
              and mi wife wnats to tell you how sorry she was for being
              slow tyoing...and for her spelling errors ;) wooops...I am
              sleepy ;)

Deron-SLPREZ: We support the Epson Color Stylus up to 360x360 already, and
              soon as we get the docs from epson (soon?) we will support
              that as well.  No problem on the spelling and speed!  (oops,
              we will support 720x720 as well I should have said).

TheDuck: re: pageliner i am working on a rather large document, and i would
         like to insert italics and bold into the document via pageliner
         rather than in pgs, is there a way to do this?  iv been waiting on
         the updates to place my text into pgs

soft-logik: I can help you with that.

Mike-SLslave: Refer to appendix B for a complete list of text codes to use in
     PL's function keys.

Deron-SLPREZ: We have macros already for normal and bold (choose
              settings/function keys to see them), and you can easily add
              italics.

TheDuck: must have missed it, ok, thank you

Harv: END OF FORMAL Q&A SESSION.  I'D LIKE TO THANK DERON & MIKE FROM SOFT
      LOGIK FOR JOINING US HERE TONITE.  [APPLAUSE SIGN]

CliffG: Thanks Soft-Logik guys - good chat Harv and Jason and SL!

===========================================================================
==  Alien Breed: Tower Assult review                By: @{" Jason Compton " link P8-1}  ==
===========================================================================

The Alien Breed have a habit of always popping back up just when you
thought you'd seen the last of them...always on some desolate planet, with
a lone fighter all alone (or with a buddy, if you're lucky) fighting off
hordes of nasty things.

Alien Breed games sort of work the same way...just when you think they've
had enough, they nail you again.  ABTA won't be the last, either...Team17
is working on a Doomish Alien Breed.

So, what's ABTA got that's so important?  More Alien Breed, for one.  If
you like the sort of thing Alien Breed does so well-put you on a large,
scrolling, often mazelike landscape, watching top-down as you blast through
endless swarms of alien creatures who like to kill you, and AB and AB II
weren't enough for you, ABTA is your thing.  It certainly doesn't miss a
beat from its predecessors, and the gameplay is so similar to AB II that
you can drop right in and start.

Except for the long-needed retreat mode.  Basically, retreat mode, if you
have a second joystick button or a dextrous big toe to hit the keyboard
with, allows you to move in the OPPOSITE direction you're shooting.  Nice,
isn't it, considering that the Alien Breed find it so easy to kill you.
It's not quite as good as the Robotron/Smash TV 8-directional-independent
shooting and movement, but it's a nice addition.

Also nice to see is the hard drive installability.  It still requires you
to use floppy as a passkey, but it's better than nothing.

ALSO nice to see is the inclusion of an AGA and ECS version in one package.
The ECS version is, as you'd expect, the same game with fewer colors.
Gameplay doesn't suffer, but a lot of things look rather brown.  The AGA
version gives you wonderfully pretty (or wonderfully desolate) views of the
world around you.

Still present is the time-honored Alien Breed tradition of blowing up
levels and completely, irrevocably ending your game unless you make it out
of the level VERY quickly.  I've always found that terribly annoying.  Oh,
sure, it's exciting and all, up until the level blows up and you're facing
"Game Over".

So, good for Team17.  Short of retreat and built-in HD installability,
you're not looking at anything TOO much removed from the Alien Breed
formula, but you ARE looking at a fun, fast-paced game.

[End note: I DID have some trouble getting the ECS version to work on a
3000/25, but it worked correctly on other ECS machines.  3000 owners might
want to double-check the game first.  If the gameplay looks horribly
choppy, something's wrong.]

TITLE

    lk

VERSION

    1.06 (update to v1.05)

AUTHOR

    Written by Alexis WILKE (c) 1993-1994

DESCRIPTION

    lk is a linker which will create executable files from
    any valid Amiga object files and libraries. The following
    assemblers and compilers create compatible Amiga object files
    (note that this list is far from being complete):

        GenIm2
        Basm
        SAS/C
        Dice (Upto V2.x at least)
        Oberon

    The C compiler from Aztec and gcc create their own file
    formats and are not supported by lk.

    lk has a large amount of features (over 100 keywords)
    and is compatible with most of the existing linkers:

        SLINK 6.x  (SAS)
        BLINK 7.x  (The Software Distillery/SAS)
        ALINK      (Commodore)
        DLINK      (Dice)

    lk is quicker that those linkers and has no major bugs.

NEW FEATURES

    Each new upload includes a file named lk.history which
    describes new features.

    V1.06 all bugs known for compatibility with
          SLINK have been corrected.

          lk now supports archived libraries

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    There should be no special requirements. However a
    system with less than 1Mb of memory will probably
    fail frequently. lk has been programmed to be compatible
    with OS versions 1.2 and 1.3. However it has been developed
    under V2.0 and V3.1, so there is no guarantee of compatibility.

    The use of lk also requires an assembler or a compiler
    which Amiga standard object files. To test if your program
    does, you can use this demo of lk and it
    will notify you if an invalid file is found.

HOST NAME

    Any Aminet mirror, for example ftp.luth.se (130.240.18.2)

PRICE

    Those two files are free. However there is a registration

    lk tool. This fee is of 15 US dollars or 90 French Francs.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

    This _distribution_ is a freeware. It contains only a limited
    version of the linker. A registered version is available

DESCRIPTION:

     Mand2000D is the demo version of Mand2000, a fractal exploration
program.  Fractals are strangely beautiful mathematical objects which
have started appearing everywhere from book covers to rock videos.
The Mandelbrot set is probably the most popular of these fractals.
Its unique beauty and infinite complexity, derived from a simple
mathematical formula, have drawn thousands of people to explore the
Mandelbrot set on their computers.  Do note however, that no
mathematical ability is required to explore and appreciate fractals
with Mand2000.

     Mand2000 draws pictures of the Mandelbrot set and other fractals
on your Amiga and allows you to explore them by doing animated zooms
towards interesting areas.  In Mand2000 we have attempted to combine
speed, power and simplicity with a few unique features, all designed
to make it easy for you to discover uncharted regions of the Mandelbrot
set, Julia set and other fractals.

     Mand2000D is a full version of Mand2000, except that saving and
printing have been crippled.

     Some of the key features of Mand2000 are:

     Point and click animated zooming is the most intuitive way of
exploring the Mandelbrot and Julia sets that we could think of.  Just
point and double click.

     Mand2000 allows you to pan across fractal images using your
keyboard, mouse, or joystick.  Plug in your joystick to scroll and zoom
your way around the most complex object ever seen.

     Mand2000's multi-pass drawing lets you see an approximation of the
final picture in a fraction of the total calc time.  Even for pictures that
will take several minutes to complete, you can get a good idea of what
your picture will look like almost immediately.  This allows you to
quickly decide whether to keep zooming, or wait for the completed
picture.

     Mand2000 has a multi-window, multi-requester design.  You can
adjust parameters and see the changes in real time as Mand2000
continues calculating while you use the requesters.  Leave as many
requesters and fractal windows open as you want.

     Mand2000 lets you calculate fractal zoom movies quickly, by
calculating key frames and letting Mand2000's TweenPlayer create the
intermediate frames at playback.

     Just a few of the other features include:  full AGA support,
compatibility with the Picasso II and other third party graphics boards
in up to 256 colour mode, literally dozens of different assembly
language math routines for accuracies ranging from 16 bits to 1000+
bits, on-line help, printing, multi-level undo, built in locations to
start you searching, full featured ARexx support, several ARexx
scripts supplied, graphical displaying of your location, etc.

     These are just some of the more significant and innovative
features in Mand2000.

     Also available on Aminet are two screen shots from Mand2000 2.0,
demonstrating the HAM rendering, and an iteration animation made with
one of the supplied ARexx scripts, also demonstrating the new HAM
rendering.

NEW FEATURES:

     Since version 1.x there have been two main changes made to Mand2000:

     1) Mand2000 now supports rendering fractals in HAM, HAM8, and dithered
256 colour.  This allows you to display your fractals in thousands of
different colours - on ANY Amiga.  The entire user interface will now,
optionally, run in these modes, allowing a separate palette for each
fractal window, each palette consisting of thousands of colours.

     2) Mand2000 now creates anim files directly.  Iteration movies, Julia
seed movies, morph movies, and whatever animation types you feel like
adding.  All of these are written out in the standard anim format, for
immediate playback with any animation player.

BUG FIXES:

     The original 2.00 demo had a bug in the low precision 68000
fractal calculation code that caused a large black square to appear on
screen.  This does not affect those with '020 processors or higher.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:

     Requires version2.04 of the OS.
     Three fractal equations are always available.  Four more
fractal equations are available with a 68881, 68882 or 68040.
     An animation player and ARexx are both recommended.

DESCRIPTION

    iffed is an IFF editor. As IFF means Interchange File
    Format, this editor works for any file type, even your
    own.

    With an handy user interface you can click on the
    desired chunk to modify its size and contents.

    iffed supports a text file for chunk describtions,
    with structures written like in C. It enables anyone
    to add their own structures and other necessary things.


NEW FEATURES

    The next version may have a better support of array
    definitions.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    There should be not special requirement, except enough
    memory (about three times more than the IFF file size
    plus iffed size.) However this tool has been developed
    on a 2.x/3.x system.

THIS RUMOR IS COMPLETELY FALSE.

Termite was developed from the ground up by Oregon

No plans were ever made to purchase rights or code to
Terminus, and we have never been in contact with

Terminus registration fees are NOT applicable to the
purchase of Termite, as the original rumor message

TITLE

	ClipBook - Store multiple text & graphic clips for later use


VERSION

	1.2  


AUTHOR

	Nick Portalski
	nick@ripple.demon.co.uk


DESCRIPTION

	I spent a couple of summers working on Macs writing documentation.  
	One of the most useful tools was the Mac Scrapbook, which allows you 
	to store any number of 'clips' (text and graphics) and then copy any
	one to the clipboard so you can paste it into applications.  
	Items were placed in the scrapbook via the normal cut'n'paste keys.  
	In fact, I liked it so much that I wrote this -  The Amiga 
	Clipbook commodity.

	The Clipbook allows you to store text and graphics clips, scan through
	them and copy any of them to the standard Amiga clipboard.  
	They can then be pasted into applications.  To put something into 
	the Clipbook you simply have to copy it from an application and paste
 	it into the Clipbook.

	Each clip in the Clipbook is displayed if possible.  At the moment
	only FTXT and ILBM clips are shown.  Others can be stored but not
	displayed.

	This is useful for logos, 'standard' blocks of text, graphics you use
	often etc etc.  If you use a particular graphics brush often then 
	instead of having to load it (and remember the path!) each time you 
	can simply store it in the clipboard and copy it out each time you 
	need it. 


FEATURES

	Clipbook opens on publicscreens.

	Can be forced to open on *any* screen. (Useful as you don't
	have to keep flicking between screens.)

	Displays ILBM clips.

	Each clip can be named, so even clips it can't display can be
	identified.

	Can use any viewer to view the whole clip. (Such as Multiview)

	Can use different viewers for different types of clips

	Can be controlled completely from the keyboard (and mouse of course!)

	Can load clips into the Clipbook from any IFF file. 

	Can be told to automatically paste anything that's cut/copied
	directly into the Clipbook.

	It's a commodity, so has hotkey and other normal Commodity goodies


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	OS Version 2.04+
	iff.library (included in archive)
	Will work from floppies, but has been designed with 
	hard drive users in mind

                            UUEncoding/Decoding
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
             (thanks to Bob Tomasevich for the quick tutorial)

What is uuencoding and uudecoding?
----------------------------------
uuencoding is converting a binary file into text (ASCII) which can be sent
through mail or Usenet.  uudecoding is reversing the process (e.g.
converting the file back to binary).

Why would I want to do this?
----------------------------
You have to send a binary file to a user who does not have FTP access, or
the user is too lazy to FTP the file.

What is the normal procedure?
-----------------------------
1. Convert the binary file into ASCII, using uuencode.
2. Send the file, through email, to the user.
3. The person on the receiving end gets the email, which may be split into
   parts.  If the email is split into parts, the parts must be combined,
   in the order received, into one file.
4. Receiving person converts the file back into binary, using uudecode.

What does a uuencoded file look like?
-------------------------------------
The start always has:

    begin 644 <encoded file's name>

So, for the file happy-happy-joy-joy.txt, it would look like:

    begin 644 happy-happy-joy-joy.txt

The encoded file begins right after:

M1TE&.#=A@`+@`9<````$`*QB15=2.+&/@R(Y)XM8.=J]H+*%7BL6#8]F6EP_]
M*$=E5"L?L-Z8A-:#60\@$,9P27-4-YB#;4HY)U!L9KZNE\O"O["#;8]82SDF>
M&[%J4FI',.&:E`48#="4@SE41M61<R`@%R$\,9:.?&!Z=NWM_\V';H-D1TI`=

.. more lines like the above ..

M>(`)N(`-^(`1.($5>($9N($=^($A.((E>((IN((M^((Q.(,U>(,YN(,]^(-!+
&V"\"`@`[&
``
end              <-- the end of the encoded file
size 151341      <-- size of the original file

So, how would I do this on the Amiga?
-------------------------------------
There are many uuencode/decode variants out there, but most usually have
kept the old UNIX command line, which can be confusing to novices, or,
require you to remove all mail headers and other, non-uuencoded text.

Luckily, Asher Feldman took the time to write UUxt.

What is UUxT?
-------------
It is a program which performs both the uuencode/decode operations in one
executable, AND, can also pack/unpack LhA archives.

Tell me more.
-------------
The UUxT archive contains UUxT, the CLI version, and UUxtGUI, the Workbench
interface.  I will give a short summary of how to use both.  Detailed
instructions are included in the UUxT archive.

CLI Version:
------------

  Running UUxT without any options gives the following:

     UUxT Version 2.1a Copyright (c)1993 Asher Feldman
     USAGE: UUxT [option] [archive name] <LhA archive name> <file(s)>
     options: a - encode           l - LhAencode
              x - decode           u - LhAdecode

  showing the format of the command line and the valid options.

  Some example command lines:

  1. Normal encoding - UUxt a filename.uue filename-to-archive
  2. Normal decoding - UUxt x filename.uue
  3. LhA archiving and encoding -

            UUxT l filename.uue filename.lha file1 file2 ...

  4. Decoding and LhA unarchiving - UUxT u filename.uue

  For LhA encoding and decoding, you will need LhA by Stefan Boberg.

  Workbench (GUI) Version:
  ------------------------
  Below is a ASCII rendition of the UUxT-GUI window (from UUxtGUI doc):

  (1) Clicking on this brings up a requester to select the file you want to
         perform the operation shown in gadget (5).
  (2) You can manually type here the filename of the file affected by the
         operation indicated in gadget (5).
  (3) Used only for encoding, brings up a requester to select where the
         encoded file should go.  Selecting an existing file will cause the
         existing file to be replaced by the encoded file.  You can also
         use this requester to create directories.
  (4) You can manually type the filename of the file to be the encoded file.
  (5) The operation to perform on file shown in (2).  The operations are
         the four provided by UUxT (uuencode/uudecode/LhAEncode/LhADecode).
  (6) The name of the archive created with the LhAEncode option.  Ignored
         when any other operation is selected.
  (7) Does the encode/decode/LhAEncode/LhADecode and pops up a requester
         indicating if the operation was successful or not.

I need this!  Where can I get it?
---------------------------------
If you use the Internet from a local BBS, you may find it there.  If not
you can FTP it from wuarchive.wustl.edu, in the directory

                          pub/aminet/arc/UUxT.lha

It should also be on the Aminet mirrors.

Thanks for the explanation!  How can I reach you if I have questions?

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
          -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-
service online SIG (Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users.

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in various ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA area banks of high-speed modems (you pay for the
phone call if it's not local), or though any SprintNet indial anywhere in
the USA, (with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell account.  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help and you can easily customize
it for your terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1000 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
      once, of any size, with one command.
 * Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, Elastic
      Reality (ASDG), Soft-Logik, Apex Publishing, and others.
 * 38 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 10,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as

 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.

AR can also be read with Mosaic (in either AmigaGuide or html form). 
Reading AmigaReport with Mosaic removes the necessity to download it.  It
can also be read using programs found in UNIX sites such as LYNX.

Simply tell Mosaic to open the following URL:

Or, for those in Europe, the Polish site is:
http://sun1000.ci.pwr.wroc.pl/AMIGA/AR/

Mosaic for the Amiga can be found on Aminet in directory comm/net, or
(using anonymous ftp) on max.physics.sunysb.edu

@{" Alien Breed: Tower Assault " link P3-1} It's not getting too old just yet...

Sorry for the rather low amount of reviews this time around...between the
WOA reports and the press releases and all of that good stuff, the magazine
was getting really, really huge.  But Matt Costanza, AR Games
Editor-in-waiting promises me he's got some coming up, and I have some up
my sleeve as well-notably, the CEI4065 Ethernet card and AmiCheck.  But
don't worry, we haven't forgotten about reviews...

A Piece by Eyal Teler
---------------------

                     Star Trek - The Amiga Generation

  [ This episode deals mainly with Picard's attempts to come to terms with
the revelation that Q is his true, long lost, mother, adopted by the
Continuum when he was but a child, and still had hair. However, to prove
that this is not just a space soap opera, but actually a highly technical
futuristic series, the crew will also have to deal with a world on the
verge of disaster.
  When we join this episode, the Enterprise is hovering above a solid
yellow planet which is similar in looks to many other planets. ]

  Sitting down with a cup of Earl Jones tea, for that deep voice effect,
captain Gen-Lock Picard listened to the summary La-Forge has prepared.
  "...planet Commodore is therefore completely dry. The ecological disaster
brought by president Ali could cause the death of the entire Amigan
population. Natural reproduction has stopped completely, and there isn't
even enough water for a floor scrubber to work."
  Shock registered on the faces of all scrubber loving crew members.
  "Are there any large underground water deposits? We could then use the
phasers to solve the problem, as we did in the past."
  "I'm sorry, but we just can't use the same solution in two episodes.
We'll look as if we learn from experience.
  "On the other hand, work had already started more than half a year ago
to produce water using a concept similar to the one used by our
replicator. By using the Liquidators, as they are called, the Amigans have
hoped to solve the problem. Unfortunately, the process is taking longer
than anticipated."
  "Ohhhhh," cried Deanna suddenly, clutching her head.
  "Deanna, are you okay?"
  "I just felt a fluctuation in the Force, Lock, as if millions of people
have suddenly lost the will to be creative individuals, and decided to
join the great unwashed masses."
  "With this lack of water, it is no wonder they cannot get bathed,
captain."
  "Oh, shut up, Data. This is a serious matter. What does it mean,
Deanna?"
  "Oh no, the voices, the voices, oh, what a world, what a world!"
  "I know what's happening."
  "Guinan, what are you doing here?"
  "I felt that disturbance in the Force, too. It's the Borg."
  "What have they done this time? Destroyed another couple of worlds?"
  "It's worse. They are life long enemies of the Amigans. The Amigans'
slogan was 'have an Amiga, have a friend', while the Borg's one was
'assimilate or die'. This battle of the slogans has gone on for ages.
  "Now with the weakening of the Amigans, the Borg manage to assimilate
people much more easily, with the use of their new slogan 'join the
Incredible Borg Monopoly world, and get built-in networking'."
  "That's terrible. Perhaps my mother will be able to do something."

  [ The episode continues with Picard trying to find out whether the
records about his mother confirm what the Q had so convincingly claimed,
and talking to his step mother, simulated by the holo-deck. Eventually,
his love-hate relationship with the Q convinces him that the Q is really
his mother.
  At the end of the episode we find out that the whole episode was staged
by the Q, including falsifying records, and simulating Picard's mother
simulation. Commodore's problems were just added by the Q so that he
doesn't get completely bored.
  Not much of a conclusion, is it? But then, what do you expect from Star
Trek - The Boring Generation? ]
