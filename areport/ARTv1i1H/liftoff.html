<p>  It's been a real experience writing for, and more recently writing for AND
editing Amiga Report Magazine.  It's been a chance to take a good idea and
turn it into an (if I may say so) amazingly successful and popular source
of information.  Of course, the argument can always be made that the
Commodore liquidation proceedings have created a huge void of news that we
just happened to fit neatly into, but I'd like to think that it rested on
the hard work of the writers and the support of the readers.</p>

<p>  A few months ago, I started thinking of what AR was missing and what job
it could or should be doing.  Then I started thinking about what the Amiga
was missing...and it came to me: an online technical journal, bringing the
sort of rapid distribution the format allows to a new audience, with the
sort of information that might not QUITE fit into the much more
broadly-based Amiga Report.  To put in development material, in-depth
tutorials and articles, and...well, whatever else happens to come our way.
:)</p>

<p>That's where Greg steps in.  I knew AR Tech needed an editor other than
myself...first off, I simply don't have the sort of expertise it takes,
and even if I did, I wouldn't have the time to do the job right.  Greg's
already set a pretty high standard and set of goals for the magazine,
which thrills me.  (After all, it'll be an online magazine I can READ for
a change!)</p>

<p>Please enjoy yourselves.  The Amiga needs people who know how the machine
works, particularly with the liquidation's conclusion just around the
corner.  The auction is April 20th...just three weeks away as I write
this.  The long sleep may be coming to an end.</p>
