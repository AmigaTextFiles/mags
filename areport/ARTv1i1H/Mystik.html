the opus in progress known only as "Mystik Tank".</H1>

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Okay.  Let's start this off at the beginning, the obvious
            falsity, and work our way up.  Is texture mapping impossible
            on the Amiga?

<dt>davereed<dd>  Impossible is a funny word.  Such techniques are possible on
            any machine with enough memory to support textures.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Okay, so what does the Amiga architecture present as 
            difficulties when trying to build a texture mapping algorithm?

<dt>davereed<dd>  As many people mention, it does take more work to do this kind
            of pixel by pixel handling with a Planar chip set; though,
            with faster machines, texture mapping still works well.  It's
            often a matter of money.
            
<dt>davereed<dd>  People in the PC market often will buy the highest and most
            powerful machine they can get their hands on for a game.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     So, what kind of Amiga can honestly be expected to do texture
            mapping well?

<dt>davereed<dd>  Any machine with the Mhz to push it.  If the standard was the 040 processor, texture mapping would
            hardly be an issue.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     So a good texture mapping algorithm on the Amiga is 100%
            reliant on the speed of the main CPU, then?

<dt>davereed<dd>  Done the easy way, yes. Done the smart way, no.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     So, what kind of algorithms are being used, by and large?
            Are we still following in the footsteps of DOOM, or have the
            algorithms become more complex?

<dt>davereed<dd>  To tell the truth, some algorithms have gone past Doom, at
            a price of speed, no less.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     What kinds of algorithms are the easy way, and which ones
            fall under the "smart" category?  Is there still a use for the
            Amiga chipset in the advanced algorithms that texture mapping
            presents?

<dt>davereed<dd>  Well, hard for me to say. I don't handle the technical aspect of these things too much.
            
<dt>davereed<dd>  You can actually get some nice results by using some of the 
            cycles in the Custom Chips, but lots of people worry about
            making something too custom chip dependant.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Do you?

<dt>davereed<dd>  Basically, I handle the game design and ideas behind it, but
            the coders do most of the techie stuff.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     I see.  How many coders do you have working on your engine,
            then?  And how many man hours have been spent in the design
            phase?

<dt>davereed<dd>  Okay, one question at a time.

            <I>(ARTech smiles.)</I>

<dt>davereed<dd>  Right now, there are 2 coders working on the main game engine.
            The main engine is a 2 part series.

<dt>davereed<dd>  The design phase has been long. too long.  I mean, too long,
            for it is very hard to get help when you aren't well known.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     What kind of help have you needed?

<dt>davereed<dd>  It took me 2 1/2 years just to get a team that has stuck together.

<dt>davereed<dd>  I used to try joining people who started groups, but they 
            often fell apart.

            <I>(room fades in one of those wavy wipes into a dream sequence)</I>

<dt>davereed<dd>  About 5 years ago, I bagen writing fantasy stories.  They were
            not simply fantasy stories, but they were somewhat of an 
            autobiography of myself.
            
<dt>davereed<dd>  I wrote them, initially, for self-illumination. Something to
            help me (perhaps) grow wiser in the ways of life (so to 
            speak). I just never liked to write about myself.

<dt>davereed<dd>  After a couple of years and Wolfenstein 3D was released (also,
            after 3 stories I wrote, based on the same planet), I had an
            Idea for a game.
            
<dt>ARTech<dd>     Idea with a capitol I, it seems.

            <I>(ARTech smiles.)</I>

<dt>davereed<dd>  Yes, a capital I.

<dt>davereed<dd>  A futuristic game to take place many years, after these 
            stories had taken place.  Now, I can really say that this
            may be the first game designed with 5 years of storywork
            behind it that hasn't already been made a series, or a 
            movie, or something.
            
<dt>davereed<dd>  Well, Wolf 3d awakened the memories of the fun Atari 3D 
            arcades i used to play.  I've played nearly all the arcades,
            ever since the Pacman era.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     So did I.  Long gone are the days of typing in programs from
            Compute!, though.

<dt>davereed<dd>  Heh. I remember typing in programs from Compute!

<dt>ARTech<dd>     I've found that there are few programmers that don't remember
            typing in programs from Compute!

            <I>(ARTech smiles.)</I>

<dt>davereed<dd>  I started to design my dream game.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Tell me about the dream game.  (no, not you, Usul.)

<dt>davereed<dd>  Well, I started on developing the idea of a game that mixed
            the 3d Atari Arcades (With things coming at you from all 
            around), the environment from the movie Tron, and the kind
            of Magic system from an RPG.
            
<dt>ARTech<dd>     Sounds like quite the dream.

            <I>(the earth shakes and splits as IRC undergoes one of the
            hundreds of netsplits that rock its foundation daily)</I>

<dt>davereed<dd>  The Old arcades also didn't mind doing a split screen idea,
            with more than 1 perspective.

<dt>davereed<dd>  Often a double perspective, for 2 people to hack around.

<dt>davereed<dd>  What the double display is used for in my game, I'm not sure
            I can say, at the moment.
<dt>davereed<dd>  But lets just say that Tanks are often not controlled by 1
            person.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Okay.  So, we come back to the design, then; have your 
            programmers asked you to scale down your vision of the game?
            
<dt>davereed<dd>  One has, the other is doing another game which also does some
            pushing of its own.

<dt>davereed<dd>  Me. I don't ask to scale things down. We take things one thing
            at a time and just keep adding, till it reaches what it is
            supposed to do. Then we talk scaling.

<dt>davereed<dd>  To make an ok game, you code simply thinking that we have to
            cut this and this out.

<dt>davereed<dd>  To make a game that truly is innovative, you've got to simply
            code for what you'd like to have, and then once the game is 
            there, see what you can do to it.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Do you think that the problems you had trying to get 
            programmers to work with you are in any way symbolic of the
            general attitudes of the Amiga development community?

<dt>davereed<dd>  Some of them, were mainly problems between themselves.

<dt>davereed<dd>  The idea that the Amiga has some effect in the difficulty
            of finding anybody is true.

<dt>davereed<dd>  That's why Origin took off so easily.

<dt>davereed<dd>  The other people weren't working for me, but I was coming in
            as a musician, trying to break some known ground. To establish
            myself so that I could be in a position to make the game a 
            reality with that group.

<dt>davereed<dd>  Scratch Musician. Composer is the better name.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     I've had people say that while the users seemed to have a
            strong vision of the Amiga, somewhere along the line, the
            programmers lose it.  Do you feel that has any truth?  Is
            something disillusioning our development community causing
            them to lose the vigor they held as users?

<dt>davereed<dd>  Fear is the answer to your question.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Very Kosh-ish of you.  So, you think that it's the times we
            live in, then, and not a general attitude.

<dt>davereed<dd>  Origin, in the PC market coded for the biggest machines with
            games that were spectacular enough to get people to upgrade.

<dt>davereed<dd>  Many programmers in the Amiga market are afraid to do what
            Origin did because they aren't sure of Amiga users will
            upgrade for a new and spectacular game, such as in the PC
            market.

<dt>davereed<dd>  Years ago, I believed Amiga users would. I still do.

<dt>davereed<dd>  Not that the Ami scene is the only thing I plan to code for.
            But to push the market for faster processors, I'm all for it.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     What kind of requirements, then, can users expect your dream
            game to have?  030?  040?  Graphics card?  ECS or AGA?
            
<dt>davereed<dd> As for the first project, mainly what is needed is 2 megs and
            for the speed a nice 030.  Graphics is not dependant.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     And the second?

<dt>davereed<dd>  The second should be the same, based on the same engine.

<dt>davereed<dd>  I do have something in the platform genre working up, on
            paper. I've even started some of the soundtrack for that one,
            but that would be AGA.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     What kinds of problems have you had designing an engine that
            is both depth and hardware independent?  What kinds of things
            have you done to make sure that the hardware is used to its
            potential?

<dt>davereed<dd>  Well, with chunky to planar conversion, there isn't an AGA 
            hardware specialty that is needed.  But Magical spell 
            effects are nice with custom chips. There is also some other
            things such as transparencies, etc....

<dt>davereed<dd>  Take Black crypt for instance.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Please do.  I never had the opportunity to play the game.

<dt>davereed<dd>  Black Crypt really doesn't need a whole lot in the custom
            chips, but the magical effects use the blitter nicely.

<dt>davereed<dd>  When you play around with what you can do with a plane in
            planar graphics, they can do some fun things without the CPU.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     What kinds of things can be done with the planar graphics 
            system that you feel are the best examples of that statement?

<dt>davereed<dd>  One of the things I like about Amiga's custom chips, in 
            particular, is the transparent copper runs.

<dt>davereed<dd>  It is done in some euro demos, but also in Black Crypt 
            (Yep, there's that word again).

<dt>davereed<dd>  In BC, there are various magical barriers which you can see
            through, but have their own colors which cycle in a particular
            direction. (Half transparent walls).

<dt>davereed<dd>  They don't have to be walls, however. Imagine, using something
            that cycles in a direction to refract or reflect light.

<dt>davereed<dd>  Just an idea.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Fascinating.

<dt>davereed<dd>  Well, BC doesn't shoot off light.  I was just taking it to a
            possible conclusion, could make a neat idea of something to 
            bounce things off (i.e. lasers possibly?)

<dt>davereed<dd>  We are coding the stuff as system friendly as possible. I.E.
            no real poking around. There are some things in which the 
            graphics are real easily ported between the two sides.

<dt>davereed<dd>  For the first versions, the game will need the custom chips.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     What happens when the custom chips are gone?  Do you then
            rely on the CPU to do what the chips would have done, or 
            do you simply leave the feature out?

<dt>davereed<dd>  Under RTG, most machines will be powerful enough to do the 
            same things without them.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     So you plan on releasing a version of the game for each 
            "platform" then; such as ECS, AGA, and RTG-boards?

<dt>davereed<dd>  The engine already supports ECS and AGA.  RTG boards are
            an option, only needing to redirect some thing.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     How have your programmers reacted to the demands your dream
            game has placed upon them?  How do they feel about the 
            project?

<dt>ARTech<dd>     (one would hope that they are ecstatic, and honored, but you
            know how programmers can be.)

<dt>davereed<dd>  They keep telling me about how big and well-done the storyline
            is.  They see a neat idea, but I know they aren't sure about 
            how it is until they have a tangible product ready.

<dt>davereed<dd>  Perhaps they make think I'm a bit looney, especially that I
            wanted a combination texture mapper and polygon system put
            into the engine. I.e. a double engine.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Sounds like a good idea to me, though.

<dt>davereed<dd>  It'll work. Years after I came up with that idea, Team 17 is
            now working on 3D Off Road, which does this.

<dt>davereed<dd>  Imagine, if I could've gotten the team as early as I wanted.
            I would've had the game ready before Doom was ever released to
            the public eye. :)

<dt>davereed<dd>  The game is nothing like Doom, in game play, but people will 
            see texture-mapping and immediately classify it.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     I know that you and your team work over the internet; how has
            that helped or hindered productivity, and what has it done to 
            the communication between design and coding phases?

<dt>davereed<dd>  The design definitely gets hindered by internet, but mostly
            by not having a mailing list.

<dt>davereed<dd>  Things seem to be moving along, however, mainly since I come
            on here and mail so often. 

<dt>ARTech<dd>     So you feel that for proper development, the minimum requirement
            for productivity would be a mailing list.

<dt>davereed<dd>  I basically try to maintain a daily presence, here. If anything 
            comes through, I relay it.

<dt>davereed<dd>  I also try to ask questions and so forth,

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Have you found productivity within the constrained walls of
            IRC?

<dt>davereed<dd>  Funny enough. Dave Bryson and I are the only ones with IRC
            access.  At least, the only ones I've seen on IRC.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Has it been useful?

<dt>davereed<dd>  IRC. Hmm. It's been useful for my general Amiga stuff, but not
            much for the game.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Mostly email, then.

<dt>davereed<dd>  Heh. my project has been all email and/or ftp.

<dt>davereed<dd>  The design ofthe game is big. The tmapping only makes a tiny
            part of the game.

<dt>davereed<dd>  I had originally designed the game without any texture mapping,
            but Tomwoof insisted that I do it.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     How many people, total, are involved in creating various
            elements of the game?

<dt>davereed<dd>  I can say around 5, at the moment.  Two for the engine, two 
            others for the Cartoon stuff.

<dt>davereed<dd>  There are other people doing voices and stuff, but the voices
            come last in the animation process. That, is the fun part!!

<dt>davereed<dd>  Basically, the people speak into a microphone as they watch
            the character's mouth move.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Wow.  :)

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Is there anything you'd like to say to anyone who, like you, 
            wakes one morning with one of those Ideas for a game?

<dt>davereed<dd>  Heh. No one can wake up one morning and make a game.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Yes, but is that what you want to SAY to them.  :)

<dt>davereed<dd>  Nah!

<dt>ARTech<dd>     What would you say, then?

<dt>davereed<dd>  All I can say is:  If you have an idea that you REALLY want 
            to express. Write it down and don't ever, ever, *EVER* give
            up.
            
<dt>davereed<dd>  Did I mention to never give up??

<dt>davereed<dd>  I can't say that more than enough.

<dt>davereed<dd>  I'm not pushing this game to simply make a neat game.  I have
            to finish this. There's a huge message behind it and all of 
            the stories I will probably have published when the game is 
            released.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Thanks, Dave.  Now's the part where you give us your contact
            information, so that anyone who thinks you're a god can write
            and worship you.

<dt>davereed<dd>  Heh. Worship is the last thing I want.

<dt>ARTech<dd>     I'm sure all of the parents whose nobility many computer games
            seem to offend will be appeased by that statement alone.  :)

<dt>davereed<dd>  That's the funny part about my game. It couldn't be considered 
            either super violent or super cute.

<dt>davereed<dd>  And I never like to be seen as higher than anybody else. But
            my main email address is davereed@wam.umd.edu

<dt>ARTech<dd>     davereed:  Do you have a working or final title for the name 
            of your game?

<dt>davereed<dd>  Yes, the name is Mystik Tank (Spelled correctly for the title)

<dt>davereed<dd>  It's a funny name, but it fits the description, once you know
            the storyline.  It's also not simply about the Tank. :)

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Thanks, dave.  And, of course, you're free to close with any 
            final comments.
<dt>davereed<dd>  Ok. I actually do have a comment.

<dt>davereed<dd>  Basically, it is for developers, no matter what platform they
            are on.

<dt>davereed<dd>  when you come up with an idea, think first about what it can
            do, not how small you can make it.  Tone it down later, not 
            before.  Otherwise, you never know what you could've missed.

<dt>davereed<dd>  The programmers who do this will always come out on top.

<dt>davereed<dd>  And the funny thing, they'd think it was like taking candy 
            from a baby.  Not to condone the stealing from babies.

            <I>(davereed smiles.)</I>

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Sounds like good advice.  Not the candy from babies, of 
            course.  :)

            <I>(ARTech smiles.)</I>

<dt>ARTech<dd>     Thanks for your large chunk of time.  :)

<dt>davereed<dd>  No problem.
