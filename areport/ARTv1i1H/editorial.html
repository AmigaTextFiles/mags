<H2 align=CENTER>by Gregory R. Block</H2>
<p>I wonder, sometimes, at what it means to be a developer; what makes me
different from the many numbers of people who exist, mostly, satisfied
with what they have.  For some reason, something drives me to write
applications, and even to write here, and I believe that something is
the something that drives all developers; the need to create; the need
to leave something behind that is, in some way, a memory, a continuation,
a belief, a thought, anything.  Writers who keep memoirs use their memoirs
to remind themselves of who they are, but also to know that who they are was
someone, and is someone, too; their memories are more than just imaginary
thoughts, they're physical, sitting in the log they keep.  Journalists stash
their articles. Prolific authors, or even not-so-prolific-but-well-intentioned
authors like Dale Larson, go out on book signings; something that satisfies
the ego, the publisher, and the audience, all without earning a death threat
(unless you're a Green Card Lawyer).  And just like most people, engineers,both software and hardware alike, feel that same need; witness the signed
A1000 cases of so long ago, the secret messages hidden in the Amiga's OS.
</p>
<p>
See, I, as a man, and particularly as a gay man, if I were to psychoanalyze
for a bit, am missing a rather large portion of the average person's life --
I have no means of procreation, I have, and will likely never have, a child.
 A child is more than just a product; it is something you leave behind, a
walking, talking legacy that carries with it, whether it be good or bad,
an impression of you, a small image of the person you are.  Developing
software or hardware is more than just creation; it is the leaving behind,
in some way, some small piece of yourself for others to see.  It is as much
a gift to the users as it is a gift to yourself, some temporary freedom from
that parenting instinct, or just a freedom in knowing that something you have
created or done will affect someone in profound and unseeable ways; in
software and hardware, many someones.
</p>
<p>
So, it is unsurprising that I, in my youth, turned towards computers when my
social life went downhill; years of blowing grading curves and being the
school "nerd" have made me a cynic; years of living through my computer have
made me a developer, and given me the ideas and vision I need to keep my
faith, to perpetuate my conception of the way things should be going; it is
these "visionary" ideas I hold that makes me continue to be a developer once
the product is done, just as it is everyone's.  It's the feeling that what
you do, the work you provide, is more than just a "stopgap", or hole filling;
it's the feeling that the software you've developed is somehow of great
importance, something that could really change the way things are, the way
things work, the way people think.  It's that "Coke and a smile" attitude,
that feeling of the machine beneath your fingers, that keeps many going.
 It's certainly what keeps me here.
</p>
<p>
Here, of course, meaning the Amiga; which, arguably, has fallen well behind
in its ability to run modern applications due to its lack of hardware and
software services.  I once was one of the lead arguers in the belief that
there was nothing wrong with the approach the Amiga's OS was taking; but the
more entwined you become in the developer community, the larger the
application you're dealing with, the more you realize that you're fighting
a very special uphill battle, one that not everyone, on every platform, needs
to fight.
</p>
<p>
Which of course leads me back to that aromatic, rotting corpse we've come
to know as Commodore International, and the hope that some form of life
feasts on it.  Personal hopes, of course, are for CEI, whose ideas seem to
be more in line with a modern attempt at building a company capable of
competing as something other than a video game system.  Regardless, one MUST
require of whichever company that manages to hit the Amiga pinata and win
the candy that real work on the OS must be done, and done quickly.  Because
it isn't the developers that stand in the Amiga's way, it's the Amiga.  It's
the proprietary technology that once held its head high that causes it to
swing low; it's the Amiga's undeveloped OS that now trails in its ability
to provide developers with a simple, effective, and work-reducing environment
from which to build the large applications that today's information market
wants to be sold -- something that, you will note, NeXTStep is most often
heralded for.  The tools developers have on that platform is unmatched,
and I'm sure even Microsoft will be playing catch-up for years.
</p>
<p>
With the lack of development tools, the poor documentation provided with
the OS, the death of AmigaMail, the absence of the AmigaWorld Technical
Journal, and even that of AmigaWorld itself (not that it was ever truly
informative), I dub this the Amiga Report Technical Journal, hoping to fill
all of the above voids.  I'll do my best to provide documentation on the new
OS functions that have been so misused or underused; pen allocation, BOOPSI,
DataTypes, and more.  Not all at once, mind you, or I'll run out of readers;
and I won't hit you with a big brick, because these aren't necessarily easy,
or obvious concepts to swallow; as well, I hope to grant you all with the
blessing that is my wisdom, vision, and intellect, with a side order of
cynical comments.  Because there's more to the Amiga, and the Amiga's OS,
then just AutoDocs and example code; there's vision.  And that vision has
been lost by many, and it is the one thing the Amiga needs most to survive;
without the vision, there would have been no Amiga in the first place.
</p>
<p>
Without vision, there will be none in the future.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Gregory R. Block, Editor of the Amiga Report Technical Journal
