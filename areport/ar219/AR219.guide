Boy! Waiting for official announcements from C= is getting to be quite
boring!! Meanwhile some of the employees at C= are moving to a new
building. ...I don't know what this suggests to you ..but it give some
indication that work there at C= is not final. C= is still keeping some
employees although many have moved on to work for other companies such as
SCALA.

As far as I'm concerned The Amiga isn't dead until all the ones in my
house poop out and there isn't any left to buy. Call me a "die-hard"
....or hard headed. I feel that something is going to happen in which the
Amiga will continue to be produced. 

Why!??

Because it is a good platform. The Amiga has been lost in the minds of the
computer users simply because of Commodore. Definately not because it's a
bad machine. It was the wonderful multitasking abilities of a UNIX box,
without the expense and the power needed to make it actually do something
besides give a "login:" prompt. It has an interface that has become
standardized and extremely easy to learn...while keeping it powerful.

In the past the Amiga has become part of an extraordinary catch-22.

Commodore makes the Amiga, doesn't market it though. It relies on the
comsumers to spread the word...and to tell you the truth, the consumers
did a remarkable job...I can't imagine any other platform that survived
under this concept. Commodore can't afford to market the Amiga ...it costs
too much...but without marketing you can't sell. If you can't sell, you
can't make money.

On the other side of the wheel you have the developers who have the
ability to make great products for the Amiga. Some did. Some did but
decided it can't make enough money to justify the effort so they move on
to the Big Blue world. I can understand their reasoning. Lets say you make
the most elegant, beautiful, most needed product in the world and sell 
only a few. Let's say it costs $100 to make the product, but you only 
sell enough to bring in $50. Would you do it again?

Ok...enough babble. I'm telling you this because IF and WHEN someone ever
comes along and takes up the rights to make Amigas again, I hope they have
the money, the power, and the commitment to get onto our television
screens and say "The Amiga is out there!!" ...and actually show the people
that there is a reason that the Amiga die-hards have hung on to this
fabulous machine for so long.

HAYNIE JOINS SCALA AS SENIOR SYSTEMS ENGINEER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WASHINGTON, D.C., JUNE 8, 1994 - David Haynie, former senior system
hardware design engineer for Commodore International Limited, has joined
Scala, Inc., the leader in computer-based television information systems,
as senior systems engineer.  In this position, Haynie will oversee all
computer-related hardware research and development activities in Scala's
R&D office in Exton, PA.

Scala's vice-president of engineering Jeff Porter said, "Dave has been a
key hardware design and development person for the Amiga.  His expertise
and experience will enable us to evaluate and develop computer-related
hardware for the information super-highway."

Besides his tenure with Commodore, Haynie has been employeed by General
Electric and Bell Laboratories.  He holds a Bachelors Degree in Electrical
Engineering and Mathematics from Carnegie Mellon

"It [Scala] is the next big thing." Haynie said when he joined Scala. "I
will advise set-top box manufacturers how to develop a sophisticated, yet
inexpensive multimedia computer in next generation set-tops.  I will also
be doing software work on Scala's MMOS."  Scala's Multimedia Multitasking
Operating System (MMOS) is an object oriented kernel (OS) to be used in
future products.

Scala, founded in 1987 in Norway and incorporated in the U.S. in 1992,
develops and markets computer-based television information solutions.
Available in ten languages, Scala's multimedia tools are used by 45,000
users in more than 40 countries.

Notes:
Scala and MMOS are registered trademarks of Scala, Inc.

Bithead Technologies announces GameSmith
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GameSmith Developement System!

Why? Games are fun! Besides that, about 99% of the games out there just
aren't quite up to your standards.

"C" and assmebler programmers, this is your answer! AMOS and blitz
users: tired of BASIC restrictions? Tired of so-so tools? Do you want
commercial quality results without spending years in development?
Then check out what GameSmith has to offer.

Three years in the making, the GameSmith Development System provides
all of the low level muscle your programs require, freeing you to
concentrate on the things you really want to spend time on - GAME
CREATION! With the introduction of Commodore's exciting new CD32 game
machine, more people than ever want to get in on the action. Amiga
owners are in luck, because the GameSmith Development System allows
even novice programmers to create stunning results. GameSmith
significantly reduces development time. No matter what model of the
Amiga you're targeting, no matter what operating system level.

What is it?

The GameSmith Development System comes with a linker library of highly
optimized games systems and several utilities for game creation. Most
of the system was written in assembler, giving you true arcade
performance. Your programs can make use of any or all the individual
pieces in the linker library.

The major components of the toolkit include:

-The most sophisticated programmmable animation system available today,
and all at arcade speed. Using animated objects has never been easier!

-A sound sample/effects player of unrivaled ease. Very efficient!

-An ILBM picture loader. Load any picture with a single function call
(including encrypted graphics), or merely interrogate the file (get
dimentions, color, etc.). Optionally fill a color table at load time
and/or allocate one or two bitmaps to hold the picture.

-Sophisticated display system for taking over the Amiga's display.

-Many utility routines: Joystick polling, Vector routines, and many
more!!

The system comes with roughly 400-500 pages of manuals. You get a
User's Guide, a Library Reference, and the CITAS manual.

Compatability:

GameSmith Development System (GDS) works with every Amiga, and will run
on any system with WorkBench 1.3 or higher.

What if I want to sell something I make with this system:

No problem! there are no distribution royalties whatsoever. In fact
people won't be able to tell you've even used this system for your
program.

What do I need in order to use GDR?

You'll need either a "C" compiler or an assembler. Programmers should
be familiar with either "C" or assembler. You don't have to be an
expert, but you should be familiar with basic things like pointers,
structures, hexidemical notation, and how bitplanes are combined to
form a bitmap for display.

How can I see for myself?

Demos (including source) and the inclide files are available for
download from the support board. They are also File Requestable on
FidoNet. (Core Link 303-427-9165, 1:104/302)

Price?

GDS is available direct from BitHead Technologies for the special
introductory offer of $79.95US. this is more than a $50 savings from
dealer pricing! Sorry, no dealer sales at this price. Direct sales for
end users only.

Well, there's not much else to do but hold on and hope the ride gets
a bit better...

CEI confirmed for me this morning that they did indeed put forth a
bid for Commodore.  According to Chuck in Marketing, though, C='s
trustees hadn't made any decisions yet.

(For those of you that don't know, CEI is Commodore's US distributor)

CEI also tells me that Microcosm is shipping to them.  That means that
all the US CD32 owners with the infamous coupon WILL INDEED get it!
At least, that's what I'm told...

CEI ALSO tells me that their new Amiga Ethernet board is coming soon.
Package design may be done this week.  The board is manufactured by
Ameristar.  I wasn't able to get an expected price.

Paravision's president, Cheryl Hamilton, called me this morning.  I found
out from her that the beta SX-1s are expected to be ready "real soon".
(Actually, she didn't call to tell me that, she called because she's trying
to find a certain Amazing Computing author, but I managed to ask
anyway.)

CD32 games still dominate the UK top 10 chart, with the most entries 
and the #1 entry.  However, it's lost ground to only have 5 on the chart.

Remind me to never again do indexed-percentage reviews.  My Emplant/
A-Max finale caused more controversy than I think I'm worth, with
some c.s.a.emulations readers not understanding, misinterpreting, or
flatly refuting my conclusions and scores.  All I can say is that I won't
use that system again...

(beginning with Dragon's Lair) to CD32 format has not been launched
yet, assuming it will be at all.  Dave Foster of ReadySoft and I have
talked and the mood is that RS would be interested in CD32 versions
if it did not take much of their time and money to make them and if
someone continues to actively make them.  Enter DigiForte Designs,
my small software company with time to kill...I'll tell you if any of this
actually goes somewhere.  Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a done
deal, but I have some good impressions from their end.

Dave Haynie has left Commodore for Scala.  An E-mail from him to
that effect proves it.  This, of course, completely rules him out from
having his name etched on Amiga motherboards, but DOES free him
up for DiskSalv MM, which will directly spool salvaged files to video
in NTSC or PAL format and allow mixing with any AmigaDOS 
partition.

(portions of the above are satire)

The Coverdisk is looking up!  I have about 5 distribution BBSes lined
up and will probably be able to secure a couple more before my targeted
June 19 release.  I've been telling people June 15, but since I want to make
it a policy to post the contents of the disk in the issue of AR directly
preceding the Coverdisk, I have to push it back a bit.

Since I have received zero submissions, look for it to include Apple2000
(V1.1 for sure, V1.2 if Kralian has it done by then) and some of the more
clever items from my WBStartup drawer. :)

Watch for the disk and any other twists I may choose to throw in soon.
Until next time...when someone tells you to buy a PC or a Mac, just
ask them if you can grab the screen and yank it up and down.

PRODUCT NAMES

 GNU C COMPILER, ported by Philippe Brand and Fred Fish.
 GNU C++ COMPILER, ported by Philippe Brand and Fred Fish.
 Several GNU utilities by several people.


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

 These GNU programs can be used to compile C programs and C++
programs on Amiga computers.  The utilities provide Amiga versions of most
of the POSIX commands like rm, ls, mkdir, etc.

 This review assumes that you are familiar with these products from
using them on other platforms.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

 All the programs are available on the Aminet ftp sites:  GCC version
2.5.8 is split into 5 archives:

gcc258-1.lha  dev/gcc  basic gcc distribution, all what you need is there.
gcc258-2.lha  dev/gcc  C++, Objective-C binaries, headers and libraries.
gcc258-3.lha  dev/gcc  docs in man & TexInfo formats, includes InfoView &
                       man
gcc258-4.lha  dev/gcc  extra binaries in /bin (UN*X utilities).

                 /pub/incoming/uploads.


LIST PRICE

 All programs are licenced according the GNU Public Licence, which
generally means that they can be freely used by everyone.  Read the 
licence for details.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

 Amiga 1200, 14 MHz 68EC020 CPU and 68881 FPU
 2MB Chip RAM, 4MB Fast RAM


ABOUT THE USAGE

 The usage of the compilers is exactly like on POSIX machines.  All
the optimisations of the POSIX gcc are there in the Amiga gcc.

 The compiler is provided with include files and a library
(ixemul.library) to create an environment which is practically the same as
the POSIX environment.  This means that most of the POSIX library 
functions, such as fork and pipe, can be used on any Amiga.

 The distributions also contains an Installer script which makes the
installation a lot easier.


THE COMPATIBILITY

 The compiler is fairly compatible with its POSIX counterpart, but it
also can be used to compile Amiga specific programs.  The Amiga library 
(in the SAS world known as amiga.lib) is also included in the library to 
give the user the ability to use the Amiga ROM functions.

 As the compiler uses a different kind of prototypes, the "clib"
directory of the 3.1 includes has been translated.


THE C++ PART

 The distribution also contains a port of the g++ compiler, which
enables the user to make use of the C++ language.  It is also possible to
compile Amiga-specific C++ programs which use the Amiga ROM functions.

 The use of templates within C++ is possible.


THE OTHER UTILITIES

 Some of the other utilities which are provided seem to be "not so
stable".  This is caused mainly because most of these utilities are direct
ports from POSIX source.  Here problems with the stack occur.  Most of the
problems can be fixed by raising the Amiga stack.

Amiga Multimedia 
By Douglas J. Nakakihara 

	While attending a tradeshow put on by the company I work for, I 
noticed that a booth run by one of our subsidiaries lacked much interest 
from the hundreds of attendees. This was in spite of the fact that I 
know their service would be of considerable interest. The problem was 
that they needed to inform attendees of their service without scaring 
them away. 

	A short, but catchy, video presentation would surely do the trick. 
No one would feel like they were being imposed upon by a salesman and 
they wouldn't have to read a brochure. Passersby would merely have to 
stand back and watch TV. I often write about how easy and inexpensive it 
would be to do a great multimedia presentation using the Amiga. It was 
time to for me to put my money where my mouth is. 

	In this article, I'll show you how I went about creating a demo 
presentation, including selection and use of hardware and software, with 
a particular emphasis on Scala Multimedia 300. 

Hardware 

	Choosing the Amiga 1200 as the delivery hardware was a "no-
brainer." The photo-realistic color and animation capabilities of the 
AGA chip set was a necessity. Furthermore, the 1200's built-in RF and 
composite video outputs allow it to be directly connected to any 
standard TV. Portability was also an issue. Though the 1200 cannot be 
labeled a true portable computer because it requires AC power and 
doesn't have a built-in screen, it's compact size and built-in keyboard 
makes it very transportable. 

	A comparable IBM PC-compatible PC would require a fast 486 
processor, an accellerated video card, a sound board, and a video 
converter. (The video converter is needed to change a PC display signal 
to standard NTSC video and a good one costs several hundred dollars.) 
This setup's price tag would have busted the budget with lesser 
performance, not even considering a portable model. An Amiga 1200 with a 
2.5-inch 60MB hard drive and 6MB of RAM has a street price of under 
$1,000.  

Software 

	For "kick-but" presentation performance, there is no other choice 
for presentation software, but Scala Multimedia 300. Scala takes full 
advantage of the Amiga's graphics and audio capabilities, and really 
shines on an AGA machine. Scala carries a price tag of about $400, 
bringing our total package to $1,400. 

	Now remember that this is basically a delivery-only system. 
Although you could develop the presentation using the same 
configuration, you would want to add a paint package, an image 
processor, and maybe a 3D animation package to add some spark to 
presentations. A good paint program will run you about $150 and an image 
processor about the same. 3D animation programs cost from $250 on up. 
Though not a necessity, a scanner or video framegrabber can add even 
more pizzazz to a presentation, by allowing you to quickly incorporate 
pictures. 

My Setup 

	I have an Amiga 4000, 3000 and CDTV networked with Spectronic's 
AmigaLink. My 4000's hard drive is filled with--what else--VideoToaster 
software, so I run Scala on the 4000, but the software is actually 
stored on my 3000's hard drive. Only Scala's fonts are stored on the 
4000. The network allows me to perform CPU intensive tasks like 
modifying graphics and audio on the 3000 at full speed, while testing 
presentations on the 4000. 

	I digitized some photographs for the presentation using 
MacroSystemUS's VLab, though I could have also used my VideoToaster. The 
images were then cropped and scaled using Art Department Pro (ADPro) 
from ASDG. For smooth transitions during presentations, it is important 
to keep the resolutions of all screens the same. The correct resolution 
was easily determined by simply loading one of the Scala backgrounds 
into ADPro and noting its size. 

Scala Stumble 

	I needed to have a screen where a user could input numbers on an 
imaginary adding machine and then do some calculations. The results of 
which would appear on subsequent screens. Unfortunately, user-
interactivity on a single screen is somewhat limited in Scala.  

	I solved the problem by writing the calculation program using Helm 
from Eagle Tree Software, whose forte is creating just such 
applications. By calling an ARexx script from Scala, I was able to 
seamlessly integrate the Helm application into the Scala presentation. 
Innovatronics' CanDo could have also been used instead of Helm. However, 
since CanDo displays an annoying startup screen unless you pay a license 
fee for a special player program, Helm' freely-distributable player was 
better suited for the task. 

Flying Logos 

	From the very beginning I knew I needed some "eye candy" (i.e., a 
3D animation). I wanted something spectacular, but I didn't want to 
spend a whole lot of time on it. Since the company's service involved 
the citrus industry, I settled for the company's name revolving around 
an orange. 

	Using the VideoToaster's Lightwave 3D animation package, I made a 
90 frame animation. Setting up the animation was a snap. Lightwave had a 
pre-made ARexx script to set up the letters in a circle. The orange was 
just a ball with the orange (fruit) texture. I used a nice steel-gray 
background generated with JEK's ProFills. 

	At first I converted the Lightwave 24-bit image frames to HAM8 
with ADPro and ProControl (also from ASDG), but the anim file ended up a 
couple megabytes in size. Although, Scala has an option to spool 
animations from disk, super-smooth animations must be run from RAM. It 
was also questionable if the 1200 could play it back at 30 fps--the 
resolution was 704 x 480. So I reduced the number of colors further to 
256. The animation still weighed in at 1.5MB. 

	Then I realized that the company name appeared twice on the 
revolving ring and made one revolution. As such, I was able to use just 
the first 45 frames and repeat it with no visual difference. The 
animation was now under 1MB, yeah! 

Scala 

	Each Scala screen is called a "page," which are displayed in a 
vertical list. You can graphically arrange them anyway you wish using 
the mouse. Pages are generally executed from top to bottom, but there 
are provisions to jump around in subroutine-like fashion. A typical page 
consists of a background image, with some text placed on it. However, 
they can also indicate the start or end of a music module, an animation, 
an ARexx script, etc. Scala supports Tracker-type music modules, so 
using my networked CDTV, I pulled a nice song with a jazzy beat and 
catchy melody, from a music module CD. 

	A page can be "wiped" onto the screen using any one of a number of 
built-in effects. You can also set how long a page is visible or if it 
should be user-controlled. Scala also has a feature where it will record 
the timing of pages while you go through it once manually--a very handy 
feature if you want to synchronize events with music. 

Custom Backgrounds 

	Although Scala includes many pre-made backgrounds, I wanted to use 
a custom-tailored one for the informational text portion of the 
presentation. I started with a beautiful close up of some fresh citrus 
fruit and then created a grayscale 16-color embossed version using 
ADPro. This was accomplished by first changing the color image to black-
and-white, and then making it into a negative. This image was embossed, 
with the result saved as a 16-color hi-res IFF file. 

	Since Scala uses a special palette color order, I loaded one of 
the pre-made backgrounds into my paint program and modified the palette 
for a grayscale picture. The embossed picture was loaded and remapped to 
the modified palette. The final image was saved in the Scala backgrounds 
drawer. During the presentation, the full-color version fades into the 
embossed version--an interesting effect--which serves as a background 
for the subsequent informational text. 

Adding Text 

	Adding text to a page is as easy as selecting the font and typing 
on the page. Every line of text is it's own object and every aspect of 
the text can be modified including alignment, color, outline, shadow, 
and 3D-look. Text can be moved by just dragging it on the screen with 
the mouse. 

	For optimum speed, I only used bitmapped fonts and not 
Compugraphic outline fonts. If you have to, you can convert Compugraphic 
fonts to bitmapped using the AmigaDOS Fountain program. However, Scala 
already comes will a ton of nice large bitmapped fonts. 

	You can also import graphic brushes. However, if you make custom 
ones, make sure the brushes use the same palette (or a subset) as the 
background, otherwise results may be unpredictable. Scala ships with 
many pre-made two-color symbol brushes. 

Text Wipes 

	Wipes can also be applied individually to text and other objects 
on a page, with separate on and off wipes supported. An effect can be 
applied to a group of objects by chaining them together. The speed and 
timing of the effects are configurable as well. 

Palette Optimize 

	One 256-color picture I used didn't have the right palette to 
acceptably display the mouse pointer. So I used the "optimize palette" 
feature. I then noticed that before this image would appear there was a 
long pause, which I determined must be when Scala was remapping to the 
optimized palette. To eliminate this, I just saved the background from 
Scala, so the modified palette would become the default palette. 
(Incidentally, you also have the option of saving the entire page 
including Scala objects.) 

The A1200 

	Since I chose to use an unaccelerated 1200, there are limits to 
the type of text and page wipes that can be used. I shied away from 
effects that moved a lot of graphics around. Most of the wipes worked 
fine, but a few would be slightly jerky. (Incidentally, an accelerator 
would have only added about $200 to the purchase price.) 

	The completed project, including background and audio files, was 
copied to an A1200 by connecting it to the network (I disconnected the 
CDTV). The Scala project script is an editable ASCII file, so with a 
standard text editor, it was easy to replace certain path names with 
ones that would work on the A1200. 

The Results 

	Everyone who saw the presentation, including the President of the 
company, was very impressed and couldn't believe the Amiga 1200 achieved 
the results it did. So far, no Amigas have been purchased, but the seed 
has definitely been planted. 

CD32 

	Scala has reportedly developed a system that uses a CD32 with MPEG 
module, networked to an Amiga 4000 using their serial ports. The CD32 
becomes a player device for Scala MM running on the Amiga 4000. This 
innovation will minimize the cost to develop CD32 titles using MPEG, 
since it allows use of CD32's inexpensive MPEG hardware. Of course this 
only helps for decode/playback development. 

Scala for the PC 

	Scala, Inc. is currently working on a version of Scala for the PC. 
Don't expect Amiga performance on a PC, however. PCs lack a standardized 
graphics blitter chip, so the available wipes will be limited on the PC 
version. This is in spite of the fact that a VESA Local bus PC is 
required! 

	Although you will be able to launch Scala from Microsoft Windows, 
Windows will be "frozen" and put aside, while the Scala software takes 
over the machine. This feat will obviously take a tremendous amount of 
RAM. Also, the PC's lack of a true multitasking OS prevents pre-loading 
graphics in the background, which will have a detrimental impact on page 
transitions. However, the PC version will not have a dongle like the 
Amiga version does. (Who said life was fair?) My guess is that it will 
still fair very well against existing PC packages in any event. 

	Next month we'll take a look at Scala Inc.'s InfoChannel. This 
product takes Scala to the next level by offering remote site 
capabilities. 

************************** SIDEBAR ************************************** 
Commodore Financial Woes 

	For the second quarter ended December 31, 1993, Commodore reported 
a net loss of $8 million. The Wall Street Journal, quoting a Commodore 
press release, reported "In the absence of additional resources and a 
restructuring, the company may become subject to reorganization or other 
liquidation proceedings." 

	I honestly believe the Amiga technology is too good to just 
disappear. Debt restructuring may be a possibility; however, Commodore 
would still need a large cash infusion for marketing and promotion. A 
more likely senario would be another company acquiring Commodore (or 
just the Amiga technology) and continuing to produce Amigas. 

	All of the developers and dealers I spoke with were still 
optomistic about the Amiga's future. Supplies of A4000 are plentiful; 
however, Amiga monitors and A1200s continue to be in short supply. Not 
surprisingly, I have also learned that the U.S. launch of CD32 has been 
postponed.

Following my article on the CD32 (AR 2.10) I found this new CD from Wierd 
Science and simply MUST tell the whole Amiga world about it. As its name 
suggests, it is a CD of networking utilities for the CD32, CDTV, A570 and
other CD Rom devices.

Put simply, this is THE MOST USEFUL CD I HAVE EVER COME ACROSS !! It 
doesn't do anything spectacular, or anything that your or I couldn't 
have come up with, but it does it, does it well, and does it for a 
bargain price!

From a CD32 point of view (for 'tis what I own), it autoboots, sets up 
all of the config stuff for Parnet, Sernet, TwinExpress and some cli-based
file transfer progs. It also disables the reset mode of the CD32 so you 
can take CDs out whilst still using workbench. It uses a heavily 
customised, and quite attractive desktop that is easy to use (I think it 
uses Magic WB). 

The main advantage of using this over setting up a RAD-based workbench are
that it sets itself up quickly, and doesn't use up precious RAM. In fact,
it almost gives you a fully useable (albeit portless) A1200. Using sernet
or Twin Express on my A500+ over a null modem cable means I can have a 
fully fledged network up and running in about a minute - fab!

Also included on the disk are 500 very high quality images of animals, 
cars vistas, people etc, the best image viewers/converters around, a 
large section of the latest Fred Fish disks, a Photo CD viewer (that 
works!) and numerous other toys and utils.

I cannot say it enough (although I've tried), if you have a CD Rom 
machine, and particularly if you have another Amiga, you need this CD. 
It only cost me 15 UK Pounds from a United PD distributor (you should 
be able to get it from any good CD supplier) and has made my computing 
life a lot easier.

Ten out of ten for the Wierd Science Network CD. I want to have its babies!

Keep on smiling, we may be able to buy our Samsung Amiga A5000's yet.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

[This is a review of version 1.0 of Forge, which I received in the 
mail just last week.  This is my overall first impression of Forge and 
how it lives up to the press release in the Apex newsletter.  I will 
assume the reader has a working knowledge of 3D rendering on the Amiga.  
I also won't attempt to teach the reader how to use Forge, or it's 
companion products, Essence volume I and Essence volume II.  All three 
are products from Apex Software, 405 El Camino Real Suite 121, Menlo 
Park, CA 94025, phone number 415-322-7532.  List prices are:  Forge ver 
1.0, $60; Essence I ver 3.0, $140; Essence II ver 3.0, $140.  I have no 
affiliation with Apex Software.]

Apex has added another great 3D rendering product to it's fantastic 
line of tools, Forge.  It's named Forge, suitable since it's a tool to 
forge new textures with Essence.  You must have Essence version 3.0 or 
later in order to use Forge effectively.  Theoretically you could use 
Forge with older versions of Essence or Imagine's own textures, but since 
they weren't created with Forge in mind, like Essence version 3.0 is, 
they are missing internal information that Forge needs to properly load 
them.  It is beyond the scope of this article to reiterate a review for 
Essence, but I will briefly introduce it to those who are unfamiliar.

Essence is a library of algorithmic textures for Imagine, and now 
Forge.  Using fractal noise and a bit of magic, Essence comes up with 
bump maps and color maps to make realistic looking textures that can be 
applied to surfaces in Imagine.  Ranging from crumpled paper to cedar 
shingles, the patterns are seemingly random, yet infinitely precise and 
reproducible.  There are two volumes of Essence as I write this, and who 
knows how many to follow.  Before the release of Forge, Imagine was 
required to tap the powerful textures of Essence.

Installing Forge from a single disk using the Commodore installer is 
painless and quick (it took me a less than a minute.)  Forge requires 
AmigaDOS ver 2.04 or later, at least one meg of memory, and because of 
the mathematically intense nature of Essence and Forge, a math 
coprocessor or 68040 processor.  As an option you can install the 68040 
optimized version, which will take maximum advantage of the 68040 
instruction set.  It is recommended to install it in the same directory 
as Imagine, but not required.  This is especially true if you don't even 
have Imagine.

Forge itself is a simple program, as the textures really do all the 
work.  Forge opens a 16 color (256 for AGA) high res custom screen at 704 
by 441 (using TEXT overscan prefs) and will preview images dithered with 
twelve colors (252 colors for AGA) in a window on this screen.  Forge can 
also render in full 24 bit at most any resolution, generating IFF, JPEG, 
TIFF or PPM files.  Down the right half of the screen are all the 
variables of a texture represented with number and slider gadgets.  When 
moving the slider gadgets, the preview window in the upper left corner 
will update automatically.  Using pull down menus, you can load up to ten 
textures at a time.  You can also animate textures by defining two sets 
of texture parameters and morphing between them.

Before Forge, users of rendering packages other than Imagine have 
missed out on the power of Essence textures.  Now a Lightwave user can 
use Forge to render fantastic textures in full 24 bit and import them as 
a brush map.  Forge will also render in 8 bit grey scale to be used as 
bump maps, but unfortunately it doesn't render altitudes as brightness 
levels but just a grey scale version of the color output.  Rendering 
Essence bumpmaps to import to Lightwave is difficult to say the least.  
When saving 24 bit textures for use in 3D programs it is best to stay 
with color variations and not height variations.

You could render 24 bit brushmaps to use in Imagine, but there would 
be little point since it is much more efficient to allow Imagine to 
render the textures directly.  Forge renders textures about the same as 
if in Imagine, which makes sense, since Essence seems to do most of the 
render work.  You can save an attribute to be loaded into the Imagine 
attribute requestor, and even save a collection of them to be used later.

Even though Forge is a tool, it's amazing how much entertainment you 
can derive from it.  If you're the type to endlessly play with Mandelbrot 
or Julia sets, you'll have that and more with Forge.  Essence not only 
has Mandelbrot and Julia sets, but the TreeBark and BBCourt sets.  You 
can make the most beautiful or the ugliest textures you've ever seen.  
There's even a "Randomize" pull down menu that will randomly vary all the 
texture settings.  Ever wanted a Reptile Skin Workbench backdrop?  Just 
load the "Reptile Skin" attribute from Essence and change the view to 
"Repetition Map."  Render at almost any size and you will have a brush 
that can be tiled for a wild backdrop.  One could make a living selling 
these things to Windows users.

Forge does have limited ARexx support, about fifteen commands.  In 
fact, this is how Forge executes "Randomize" and how it displays to the 
24 bit boards it supports.  Forge can lauch up to ten ARexx scripts with 
their own entry or you can call any ARexx script with a file requestor.  
ARexx scripts can not only be lauched at program start or shutdown, but 
also before or after each sequence or each frame.  With all this, you 
would think that ARexx is an important element of Forge, but to be 
truthful, it could use a bit more work.  One bug I found was if you 
launch an ARexx script from Forge that has an error it will not give any 
error code and once caused Forge to crash completely.

As quoted from the manual: "The AREXX commands themselves will not 
be documented in this manual, mostly because it is much easier just to 
present demonstration scripts for you to examine."  Just the same, it 
would've been nice to at least include a short summary of their 
functions.  There are at least two commands that aren't in any of the 
demo scripts that I found by loading Forge into a word processor.  For 
the record, here are all the commands I know of: QUIT, GETNAME, GETMIN, 
GETMAX, GETVAL, GETSTEPS, SETVAL, DUMPPREVIEW, SHOWSTATUS, PAUSE, 
RESTARTPREVIEW, UNPAUSE, REFRESHSLIDERS, FORGETOFRONT, FORGETOBACK.

The project menu has a selection labeled Iconize, which will open a 
small window of not much more than a title bar on the Workbench.  This 
frees up valuable chip memory for serious multitasking.  Clicking on the 
close gadget of this window will uniconize the program, and abortize any 
rendering if you confirm the requestor.  I wish Amiga developers would 
follow a rule on this point, as some programs quit, some uniconify and 
this one uniconizes.  If "WB Render Meter" is turned on from the prefs, 
it will also open another small window with frames remaining and a 
percent finished meter on the workbench.

The prefs requestor is fairly basic, but includes things that make 
your rendering life easier.  Among the parameters changeable are setting 
screen background color and whether or not you want Forge iconified when 
rendering.  Also in prefs there are three different task priorities, 
allowing you to change the importance of CPU time for Forge when 
rendering, pushed to the back, or front and active (which I think should 
be in ALL programs of this nature.)  This way, Forge won't be sharing the 
important CPU time with your stellar conquest battle simulation program.  
I do wish the prefs requestor had an OKAY button, all it has is SAVE and 
CANCEL.

Forge has a real time preview window with a maximum size of 237 
pixels wide by 249 high.  Real time being defined as constantly updating 
and refining even as you change parameters via sliders.  If your 
processor is fast enough, it only takes a several seconds to see details 
of your changes.  Soon after a change takes place, the window refreshes 
with 32 by 32 pixel blocks, then down to 16 by 16, then down to 8 by 8, 
etc., until it finally fills in details pixel by pixel.  Any time during 
this process you can move a slider and it will instantly update.  This 
system works great if you make a mistake and instantly get the garishly 
colored checkerboard texture (read the Essence manual.)  Using the pull 
down menu you can transfer the preview window to a 24 bit framebuffer 
like Firecracker or Opalvision.

Imagine has the ability to load two objects, or two textures, and 
morph between them.  In the case of animating textures with Forge, you 
would define two sets of parameters and morph between them.  Good 
examples of animation using Essence would be polkadots growing or clouds 
dissapating and reforming.  When using 3D programs other than Imagine, 
you would have to render a sequence of texture brushes, which most 3D 
programs accept as animated brushmaps.  Forge can preview the animation 
either by storyboard or actually showing them animate in a postage stamp 
size window.  The animating preview is done by copying the storyboard 
views to the anim preview in sequence.  You can preview at 30fps and it 
didn't even seem to slow down the real time updating on my machine.

Overall, I like Forge quite a bit.  Like almost any program, the 
first release can always be a bit more refined, Forge has a very solid 
foundation to start.  I don't know of any program like it on the Amiga, 
so it's in a class of it's own.  If you already own Essence, either 
volumes, I highly recommend getting Forge.  It will save much time 
tweaking those texture values.  If you're planning on buying Essence 
soon, Forge is even more important since it is extremely useful in 
finding out what Essence can and can't do.  I commend the Apex team on a 
job well done.

I've tangled with the Fred Fish and AmiNet CD-ROMs on some
local BBSes before.  They're nice compilations, but sometimes
it's hard to find what you're looking for.  NorthWest Public Domain
has its own entry to the CD-ROM market for compilations of PD
material, and they call it Lock 'N Load.

"Hundreds of games ready to run on most AMIGAS" reads the CD
label (rather nice blue tone to it, I might add) and they're right.
This CD is games-only, for the most part.  One of the rather nice
non-game inclusions is a version of Workbench 1.3, 2.0, and 3.0,
meaning that virtually anybody can use this disc and find everything
they need on it.  It also means that CDTV and CD32 users alike can
boot off of it.  This is a rather nice feature.

Let's say you boot off a CD32 like I did.  After a considerably lengthy
wait (Workbench usually goes faster from floppy than this, but I won't
complain too much), you're treated to a rather nice picture of a jet
fighter cockpit with the Lock 'N Load logo above.  (Clever, eh?  It's
firing on another jet...)  The CD32's joypad is supported by a somewhat
helpful program called JoyMouse, which means you can chunk the
pointer around the screen, usually with more accuracy as holding
down shift and doing the keyboard combination.  It doesn't support
a right mouse button on the pad, though, which is sort of silly 
considering all the buttons we have to spare.  Then again, the program 
wasn't written specifically for the pad.  At any rate, there are two 
primary divisons on the disk: Assassins disks and "Mega-Games", which 
could just have easily been called "Everything else".  Anybody who has 
had an Assassins disk knows what they look like-if you don't, they're
floppy collections of, oh, usually 2-5 PD games.  The menu is
accompanied by a decent mod and the game is selected by keyboard.
(CD32 USER ALERT)  The Mega-Games directory is broken up into
some smaller, fairly logical subdivisions, which are also in turn divided,
and so on, until you find the program you want to play.

This is when fun things start to happen.  A fairly good job has been done
to make sure that all of the games will run-I saw an awful lot of Nico
Francois' PAL 1.0 and Jolyon Ralph's KillAGA popping up in the 
scripts that launch when you double click (or single click with the 
joypad) on a game.  Sometimes, it doesn't always work, though.  I had a 
good handful of programs not react well with the script, and a couple 
actually had scripts that failed because of incorrect assigns or commands.
The former can usually be fixed by booting ECS or OCS (I try to make
it a habit of doing so with this program unless I KNOW I'm playing an
AGA game), and the latter...well...you'll have to tinker a bit and not
use the icons.

So how does it rate as a compilation?  If memory serves, about 300
megs or so are used up on the disk.  Not bad.  I wouldn't have minded
300+ megs of other things, but some people may have been upset by
repeats of things they already have.  The assigns are, for the most part,
helpful and welcome.  The bootable option is great, and the CD32
support isn't bad.  Of course, the CD works in ANY SCSI Amiga CD-ROM
drive (actually, probably the IDE ones, too) and has the Parnet software
on it, so it's probably more suited for a full-Amiga user.  The other
option is to hook up a mouse and a keyboard (remember, that keyboard
adapter is $5 at Radio Shack...) on a CD32 and plug away.

I won't bore you with listing the compilation.  There are, of course,
the good and the bad on this.  With the Assassins, you can always
go and look up what the first 150 or so disks held, so that should give
you some indication.  The Mega-Games are, of course, random chance,
but there ARE things worth playing-case in point, Megaball 3 AGA.

This is a disc you've got to look around...Card games are classified
under "Strategy"...which is true, to a point, it's just that I never
thought of it.  "Strategy" clicks wargame images, not Klondike AGA,
but that's just me, I suppose.

One very pleasant surprise was the Spectrum Emulator V1.7...
complete with about 30 games!  Granted, they're not speed-demon-
esque on an 020/14 CD32, but they're not bad, either, and were
quite a bit of fun.  

My final decision?  For less than $25, for someone who doesn't
already own PD compilations, it's a good buy, especially if you're
handy with Degrader or the like.

NPD knows about the assign problems and is fixing them for the 
next Lock 'n Load, scheduled for July or August.  Other than that,
a very well presented, well put together CD.

What is the best way to use numbers? Most people are used to using only
the decimal system, with 10 digits. The theory behind it is that humans
have ten fingers, so miraculously the decimal system became popular. Some
suggested using base 12 instead, which has 2 more digits. the reason
behind this is that 12 is easier to work with in some cases, since it is
easily divisible by 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. Others use base
8 (octal) and 16 (hexadecimal) for programming, but the undisputed
champion of all numbering system is binary, using only 0 and 1. Of course
you could try using unary systems, with only one digit, but then each
number would be even more of a pain to count. :)

Now, let's investigate the magic of binary. Find an unsuspecting person
and ask him or her how high he can count on his fingers. Tell him that
he must show, with his fingers, a given number such that it is not
mistakable. In other words, he cannot say that counting ten fingers will
also be good for 20 or 30, etc. Most people should say that they cannot
count higher than 10 on their fingers without repeating fingers. Respond
by telling them that you can count to 1024!


Here is an 8 bit binary number I saw on a license plate last Friday:
01101001. This number, in decimal, equals 105. Each bit position carries
a different weight. For example, let's look at 105 in decimal.

         1               0               5              = 105

        (1 * 100) +     (0 * 10) +      (5 * 1)         = 105

        (1 * 10^2) +    (0 * 10^1) +    (5 * 10^0)      = 105

Each digit in the number 105 carries a different value based upon the
number 10, which is the base value. The first digit, 1, is multiplied
by 10^2 (10 squared). The 0 is multiplied by 10^1 (just 10 will do),
and the 5 is multiplied by 10^0 (anything to the power of 0 is 1).


Now let's look at the binary equivalent. Each number will be generated in
the same way, except using base 2 instead of base 10.

     0   1   1   0   1   0   0   1                      = 105

    (0 * 2^7) + (1 * 2^6) + (1 * 2^5) + (0 * 2^4) +
    (1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0)       = 105


    FIGURE 1:
            10000000 2^7 = 128       00001000 2^3 = 8
            01000000 2^6 = 64        00000100 2^2 = 4
            00100000 2^5 = 32        00000010 2^1 = 2
            00010000 2^4 = 16        00000001 2^0 = 1

    So, substitute from the table and get:

    0*128 + 1*64 + 1*32 + 0*16 + 1*8 + 0*4 + 0*2 + 1*1  = 105


Here are the decimal and binary numbers from 1 to 16:

    FIGURE 2:
            1   0001                9   1001
            2   0010               10   1010
            3   0011               11   1011
            4   0100               12   1100
            5   0101               13   1101
            6   0110               14   1110
            7   0111               15   1111
            8   1000               16  10000


Now here is why it works this way. In decimal, let's say you have
100. You know that the number before it is 99. And when you get
up to 1000, you know the previous number is 999. In binary, it
works a little more interestingly. Let's say you have the binary
number 1000. this is 2^3, or 8 in decimal. Since binary only has
the numbers 0 and 1, the number before 1000 is 0111, or 7 in decimal.
On the above chart, decimal 16 is 10000 in binary. Subtract 1 and
you get 15 decimal, or 1111 in binary.


Now for more fun. Let's say we have 4 people, named: Mr. Ali, Mr. Fish,
Mr. Luck and Mrs. West. We want to know who will be attending the party.
Each person will either attend (TRUE) or not attend (FALSE). If TRUE,
a 1 is used. If FALSE, a 0 is used. Each person is also ordered
alphabetically. The data is stored in a binary number.

Mr. Ali is the man of honor, so he is attending. TRUE
Mr. Fish was busy backing up his disks with BRU, so he can't attend. FALSE
Mr. Luck hasn't been to the offices in a while, so he is going. TRUE
Mrs. West found a job working out of state, so she can't attend. FALSE

Now in binary, we are storing the answers in the order of the person's
name, alphabetically. So we have a TRUE, a FALSE, a TRUE, and a FALSE.
Above, we defined TRUE as equal to 1, and FALSE as equal to 0. This
makes the binary number 0101 (or F-T-F-T). NOTE! The numbers are stored
in REVERSE ORDER! If we had just 1, it would be no problem. If we add
another numeral, such as 0, it would be 01, so that 1 keeps the same
place (2^0).

Now, the question is, is Mr. Luck going? We have the data 0101, and we
know Mr. Luck is the 3rd digit from the right. We would check the number
0101 against the value used ot define Mr. Luck. Since Mr. Luck is the
third position, he takes 2^2 (2^1 is the second position, and 2^0 is the
first position). Now, 2^2 = 4 in decimal, so that is what we assign to
Mr. Luck. Now, let's convert 0101 to decimal.

    0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 5 in decimal

Okay, our data equals 5. We take 5 and use the AND operation to check it
with 4. In C this might look like: if(DATA && MR_LUCK) or if(5 && 4) in
decimal or if(0101 && 0100) in binary.

Now let's look at the binary comparison:

    0101
    0100
     ^
    This is the position. Since 0101 AND 0100 both have that bit set to 1,
Mr. Luck is attending. Now in decimal, we have 0101 = 5 AMD 0100 = 4, or
5 AND 4. The only way to make 5 is by adding the numbers (2^2) and (2^0),
which is (2^2 = 4) = (2^0 = 1), or 4 + 1 = 5, so we have proven that 4
is included in the numbers of the binary places that add to 5 (see
FIGURE 1).


There is much much more to using binary, and it may be hard to understand
or read at first, but hopefully now you will know how to count to 1024 
with just ten fingers. To give you a hint, try calculating 2^10!


I took this from the Amiga Online Reference Manual (with permission), to
show you what some number conversions look like. Take a look at the
patterns formed in the binary numbers and compare them with the decimal.

I can tell some people are really getting tired of hearing about this
thing.  Some are even calling it vaporware.  It's not...at least, if it
is, it's vaporware that's being marketed by the manufacturer quite
heavily.  I got a fax from Paravision (owners of MicroBotics, remember
them?)  about it.  There's some good news and bad news.

The good news first:  AT keyboard support and a 32-bit SIMM slot are
standard on the SX-1 now.

The bad news:  AT keyboard support and a 32-bit SIMM slot are standard
on the SX-1 now.

Well, it's good because you don't have to pay "extra" for them, although
it has raised the cost of the standard unit some.

It, and the recent unavailability of parts due to Commodore's...whatever
you'd like to call what they've done.

Since the SX-1 requires proprietary chips, and Commodore's inventory
is locked up, Paravision is buying from other sources at inflated prices.

Here's the breakdown, from the fax, of the new pricing, in suggested
retail:

Standard SX-1 (Serial, disabling switch, parallel, RGB, floppy, IDE
internal and external, AT Keyboard, audio in, SIMM, MPEG passthrough,
clock) :              $277

SX-1 with 4 megs RAM: $395

SX-1 with 40 meg HD:  $401

SX-1 with both:       $569

They will be available in quantity the week of June 27.

Paravision also has a new CEO and President:  Robert Maynard, described
by the fax and himself as a "turnaround man", having taken several
companies from thousands to millions.  He looks to do the same with 
Paravision, through strongly hyped-up marketing and "aggressive pricing."
He is shooting to re-create the mass appeal Creative Labs has been able
to generate with their SoundBlaster packages.

Paravision can be contacted at 214-644-0043 voice, 214-644-0227 FAX,
and 744144.2363@Compuserve.com and microbotics1@bix.com on Internet.
They have an 800 number, but I've misplaced it.  My apologies, I'll
tell you when I find it.

(incidentally, my SX-1 is scheduled for about June 16th...)

- THE PRIZE FOR NEXT MONTH -

    The Amiga Report contest is still going on, and it is not too
late to enter. This ongoing monthly contest allows Amiga Report
readers a chance to win software by either solving a puzzle or by
entering a random drawing.

    The prize this month is the Amiga/Toaster Reference Manual v2.221,
from Area52. This is a 1,000 page help system for the Amiga and Video
Toaster, covering the Workbench, AmigaDOS, Lightwave, and more ($34.95).
    The second prize choice is the FutureShock audio CDROM,  which was
produced using Amiga computers by SideWinder. There are some Sidewinder
music modules on Aminet that you may want to look at for a sample of
the audio CD ($12.95).
    Previously we have offered the ARexx Reference Disk by Merrill
Callaway, which was awarded to a previous winner. Contact Whitestone
for more information (505) 268-0678.

    All monthly contests end on the morning of the first of the
following month. Any entries beyond this date will be entered into the
next contest.


- THE MONTHLY DRAWING -

     To enter the random drawing, select a number from 1 to 262,144
and send it to me at one of my addresses listed below, either by
the postal service or email through the Internet.
    Also, you may enter by solving the following puzzle. The winner
of this puzzle will be decided within the same time frame as the
random prize, to allow the contest information to filter through the
networks, and to allow your letters and postcards to come in.


- THE PUZZLE -

    Since people complained that the first contest was too hard, and
that the second was too easy, I made one that anyone can solve with
a little thought. Once you get some of it decoded you will be able
to solve it with ease ::heh heh::!

        Decrypt the following encoded message: 17851 47932

        Each location in the code represents one character in the
    ASCII character set from A to Z. Also provide your method of
    obtaining the answer.


- TO ENTER -

    To enter, simply let your fingers do the talking and write an
email and send it to dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu. You MUST put
the word CONTEST in the subject line of the email header! Otherwise
you run the risk of having your email deleted (don't ask, it is a
long story!) or send a post card or letter to:

        Amiga Report Contest
        c/o David Tiberio
        6 Lodge Lane
        East Setauket, NY 11733

    Is it possible to win via snail mail? You might think that your
chances of winning are better by entering in email (much faster of
course), but last month's winner send in a letter that arrived the
day before his winning number was drawn!

    In your letter or email, please provide the following:

    Your full name and address. Please keep in mind that many of
you may have addresses that I am not accustomed to, so please include
your country or any other information that I would need in case you
win. An email address should also be included, if possible.

    You must also include a brief one sentence overview of the editorial
in this issue of AMiga Report. Just to make sure you are reading it. :)
You must also include the issue number. For example, if you read this in
AR213, then include that in your correspondance. Also, a prize winner
will be determined by a random number generator. Choose a number from
1 to 262,144. The closest winner or winners to the randomly generated
number will receive the prize in the mail. Anyone who does not provide
a number will have one assigned to him randomly.

    All prizes will be mailed within one week after I get my hands on
the published version of AmigaReport. I am doing this for a few reasons.
First, every winner so far has given the correct puzzle solution before
I have received the editon of AmigaReport that announced it. :)
Second, I don't like to go to the post office every day if I can avoid
it. Third, you never know when someone's power supply might blow up
(right Mr. Editor?!).


- RULES AND REGULATIONS -

1. In the evnt that the editor's power supply fries, the contest for
   that month will have its deadline postponed to a later date, to be
   announced. Any contest entries for the random drawing will be added
   to the next month's drawing, to be held once per month near the
   beginning of the month.

2. All prizes are donated. I cannot be held responsible for any damage
   caused by a prize. For example, if you leave your prize on the
   stairs and your grandmother slips on it, I will not pay her medical
   bills.

3. We are not doing this for any profit, and cannot be held responsible
   if we go out of business or are otherwise financially unable to give
   you anything! We are actively looking for submissions from other
   software authors.

4. Good things come to those who read the rules and regulations! Here
   is a tip to help you win: every problem is a trick problem, or gives
   you clues that are not part of the problem itself. Read the whole
   entire contest entry looking for clues. And read my other articles
   for more clues. I give some very obvious clues :).

5. If for any circumstance you are awarded a prize but do not receive
   it, contact me at (516) 476-1615. I will promptly attend to any
   mistakes that have been made.

6. These rules are subject to change at any time without warning!


- THE DISCLAIMER -

    DISCLAIMER: This contest is being provided as a service to the
    Amiga community and all persons involved in running this contest
    cannot be held liable for anything that costs you money or
    lifetime pain and anguish. Rules are subject to change. All entries
    must be received by whenever TBA. Any entries beyond this date
    will be entered into the next contest, if any.


- THE CHANCE YOU WILL WIN -

    Odds of winning are approximately 1:50 for the random drawing and
1:15 for the correct answer to the puzzle, based upon current entries.

    SPECIAL THANKS to SideWinder for donating the Future Shock albums
for inclusion in our contest, along with Merrill Callaway for his ARexx
Reference Disk!

%% Emulation Rambler                                  by @{" Jason Compton " link P8-2} %%
%% Between Jobs....                                jcompton@bbs.xnet.com %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Well, I'm between jobs right now.  Actually, that's not quite true, as
I have MaxDOS sitting here waiting for me and there's a Vortex 486
board that needs my attention.

Both are giving me problems, though...MaxDOS' is probably minor,
while the 486 keeps locking up.  I haven't had a chance to explain
the problem to the necessary parties, though.  I have confidence that
they'll work.

In the meantime, here's a "first-impressions" review and overview of
MaxDOS V1.0.

From Media4 Productions, a company with some very nice stationery,
is MaxDOS, which provides Workbench/AmigaDOS access to 
Macintosh HD floppies and any Mac SCSI device, including CD-ROM
drives and the like through their Mounter program.  The catch is that
you need mfm.device (from the CrossDOS package, standard on 
WB 2.1 and above) for the Mac floppy access.

Installation:  Uses the Commodore installer.  Simple.  Quick.
Effective.

Operation:  Well, it all pretty much centers around the Mounter
program, which is straightforward.  The hardest part is telling it
the device you want to use to read the configuration from (such
as specifying mfm.device for floppies or your relevant SCSI
device for SCSI partitions and the like) and getting the unit
number right.  For floppies, it's 0-3, and for SCSI devices, it's
the SCSI unit number.  Take a floppy as an example.  Put it in
the drive and watch PC0: and your virus checker chew on it,
then run Mounter using mfm.device.  Hit "read configuration" and
immediately and conveniently, all of the relevant facts about the disk
come up (sector size, cylinders, sectors, surfaces, sectors/track and
capacity)  Then you can mount the volume and even create a mountlist
for future reference (thereby skipping the Mounter program altogether).
Not bad.  MF0:, as it is now known, appears and can be accessed as
a legal AmigaDOS device.  Mac files are split into forks: one is the 
filename of the program, the other is the filename with a superscript
2 (in other words, squared).  The data fork, the smaller one, is very
often less than half a k and only identifies the file and a few other
Mac-like things.  For self-extracting archives, it contains the extractor.
The main body of programs seems to escape unscathed.

Problems:  Well, at present, I've tested floppy and my Amiga-formatted
HD with an AMAX: partition.  MaxDOS is supposed to recognize it and
hasn't.  I've told Mr. Landwehr (blandwehr@bix.com) about it, and I
think I'll remind him again, since I haven't received a reply yet.

This, of course, isn't the end.  I plan to try a CD-ROM drive soon, and
to fix the hard drive problem.  I'm merely introducing the topic.

Speaking of introductions, Jim Drew has introduced himself to the Mac
magazines.  He's featured in MacWeek, or at least some quotes are...
like a 486 emulation for the PowerPC 8100 that will run faster than a
Pentium.  Sound incredible?  Sure it does.  He claims that it is based on
his work with emulators on the Amiga...meaning that we see our 486 
emulator before the PowerPC people do.  What will happen?  You'll
have to wait like everyone else to find out.  Insignia Solutions, the
SoftWindows (formerly SoftPC, but that was too scary of a name for
Mac users, apparently), don't seem to believe it's possible.

This is all rather like a soap opera sometimes.  Keep the emulators
warm.

                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

  Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

  The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software, online.

  Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

  Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES.

  35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

  No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

  Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

  Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

  Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

  FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
  Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  

  Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

  The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
  Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
  All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

  Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

  And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

  UNIX "telnet" program from an account you may already
  have on an Internet-connected system. 
% 9600 bps Sprintnet in over 300 cities areas
+ $10 rate prevails at smaller US Cities
# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

/// BIX - Byte Information Exchange             Lots of information!
    -------------------------------



BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and enthusiasts.
While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is the place for 
knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  You're likely 
to find many others in similar situations who can offer advice, give 
technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.


                       *** FULL INTERNET ACCESS! ***

BIX features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription. 


                      ==============================
                      Rates and Connect Information:
                      ==============================


BIX membership costs $13 per month, plus connect time.  There are several 
different ways to connect:

SprintNet*              $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet:**               $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
(SprintNet and Tyment rates shown are for 48 contiguous US states only.)
                                                        
Tymnet Canada:          $4/hr eves/wkends           $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet Hawaii:          $10/hr eves/wkends          $20/hour weekdays   
Telnet(via Internet):   $1/hour, round the clock
Direct dial (Boston):   $2/hour, round the clock (up to 9600 bps)
 
 * SprintNet daytime hours are from 6am to 7pm, M-F, ET.
** Tymnet daytime hours are from 7am to 6pm, M-F, ET.

                20/20 PLAN OPTION (for USA-48 users only):

Volume users can choose the 20/20 Advantage Plan, which is $20 per month
and includes the first 20 hours of access by any combination of methods 
from the contiguous United States.  Additional use is $1.80 per hour 
(additional use for telnet access is $1 an hour).  The 20/20 Plan's cost is 
in addition to the $13 monthly fee.  


                           INTERNATIONAL USERS:

If you wish to connect internationally through Tymnet or SprintNet, 
please contact your local PTT.  BIX accepts prepaid international calls,
direct dial, or telnet connections.  In order to make a "collect" (not 
prepaid) call to BIX, your account must be verified before the charges 
are accepted.  When you complete the registration, we'll mail you a BIX
Membership Agreement by regular US Mail.  Whe you receive it, sign it 
and return it to us by mail.  When we receive it here, we'll authorize
your account to make reverse charged calls.

If you want to access BIX right away, contact your local PTT to set up a 
prepaid account.  You'll pay your local carrier for your calls to BIX in
advance, so there's no waiting period or verfication needed. Or, connect 
at BIX via telnet to x25.bix.com.

SprintNet international calls from most locations are $24 an hour.
Tymnet international charges vary, but are generally between $20-$30 an hour.


                           ====================
                           Billing Information: 
                           ====================

You can charge your monthly BIX membership fees to your Visa, 
Mastercard, Discover, or American Express card.

You may have your company invoiced for one or more BIX memberships with 
a BIX Corporate Account.

                            ===================
                            To Sign Up For BIX:
                            ===================

   Dial by modem 1-800-695-4882 or 617-491-5410 * 
   (use 8 data bits, no parity, full duplex)

   Press a few carriage returns until you see the Login:(enter "bix") 
   prompt, then type  bix

   At the Name? prompt, type bix.amrpt

* Users already on the internet can telnet to x25.bix.com instead.
  At the USERNAME: prompt enter bix, then bix.net at the Name? prompt.
  Once your account is registered, you can connect the same way, except
  at the Name? prompt you'll enter your BIXname and then your password.


Using the above procedure will allow users in the 48 contiguous United 
States to take advantage of our special "5 for $5" offer.  This offer 
lets you use up to 5 hours of evening/weekend time on BIX during the 
current calender month (whatever month you sign up in), for $5.  
Additional time is $1.80 per hour ($1 per hour for telnet).  At the end 
of the calender month, you will be placed into our standard rate plan, 
at $13 monthly plus connect charges.  You may also join the 20/20 Plan 
at this time.

If you have other questions, please contact BIX Member Services 
at (800) 695-4775; send a fax to BIX at (617) 491-6642; or send Internet
mail to info@bix.com.

TITLE

	RCS_TTX - Integrate TurboText and RCS

VERSION

	1.0

AUTHOR

	Daniel J. Barrett
	barrett@cs.umass.edu

DESCRIPTION

	I was inspired by the recent review in comp.sys.amiga.reviews of 
the DICE 3.0 C Compiler, which integrates RCS support into its 
programming environment.  And so, I have written 3 simple ARexx scripts 
that integrate RCS with the TurboText text editor.  One script "checks 
in" the current document, one displays the recent changes in the current 
document, and one displays the change log of the current document.

TTX_RCS is useful both for programmers and for any other TurboText
users.  You can "check in" versions of any text file for safe-keeping, 
not just program source code.

TTX_RCS is currently a simple hack that I designed and wrote in one
evening.  However, it is quite useful, and I tested it even as I wrote 
yet. Yes, TTX_RCS was used to maintain *itself* as it was being 
created. :-) (Thanks to TurboText's interactive ARexx console!)


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	AmigaDOS 2.04 or higher.  (Untested under AmigaDOS 1.3.)
	TurboText 1.03 or higher.
	HWGRCS (From Aminet: /pub/aminet/dev/misc/HWGRCSp8f.lha).
	ARexx.

HOST NAME

	Any Aminet ftp site, such as wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4).

DIRECTORY

	/pub/aminet/util/rexx

FILE NAMES

	RCS_TTX.lha

PRICE

	Free.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

Copyright 1994 Daniel J. Barrett.  The files in this archive may be
freely distributed as long as they are distributed in their entirety.

Later versions of RCS_TTX will probably be placed into the public
domain.  I want to add more features and eliminate bugs (if any) before
then.

TITLE     

     ShowAmiga

VERSION   

     1.1

AUTHOR    

     Dr. Peter Kittel, Commodore Germany
     email: peterk@cbmger.de.so.commodore.com

SHORT     

     An Information System about Amiga by C= Germany

TYPE      

     demo/euro

DESCRIPTION

     The ShowAmiga Information System was uploaded to AmiNet
     demo/euro.  The executable program is ShowF+A2.run (Basic,
     compiled with AC/Basic).  The source text is ShowF+A2.  All files
     should be kept together in one subdirectory.

     This archive contains my "Amiga Propaganda Texts" ("What you
     always wanted to know about the Amiga") in both German and
     English, plus a demonstration and viewing program for them.  The
     program is rather (not fully) secure against false inputs, so you
     could give it a try and let it run in a shop unattended.  This
     implies that it's multitasking hostile by intention.  It's easy
     to create another language version of this all.  It's also easy
     to strip off the control lines from these texts and thus regain
     pure ASCII texts.  And being pure ASCII, it's also easy to update
     the contents of these files always current with new
     products/situations.

     The program runs on practically every Amiga known, on PAL and
     NTSC, I only did not test with 3rd party graphics cards (Topaz 8
     and 9 hardcoded).

HOST NAME  

     Any AmiNet host such as ftp.wustl.edu

DIRECTORY  

     demo/euro

FILE NAME  

     ShowAmiga.lha (79393 Bytes)

DISTRIBUTABILITY

Free, and I invite everyone to spread this as far as possible!

TITLE

	Serial Stratego

VERSION

	1.3

AUTHOR

	Daniel Oberlin

	Current mailing address:
	3A Gaslight Village
	Ithaca, NY 14850

	Current Email:
	fkrj@crux2.cit.cornell.edu

DESCRIPTION

	Allows people to play Stratego, a popular board game, over a
	serial connection.  Gameplay can take place over a null modem
	connection, Modem, or while logged onto a remote host using
	Internet Relay Chat, talk, or write.  The program is unique in
	that it uses a robust packet sending algorithm which transmits
 	and receives packets using standard printable characters, and
 	filters out screen escape codes.  During game play, messages
 	may be sent, and optionally played through the SPEAK: device. 
	Be sure to skim the documentation before trying the program.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

	May be distributed freely.  I would be honored to have this
	placed on a Fish Disk.  The program may not be sold to make
	a profit.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	Runs on any OS.  Uses the SPEAK: device, but this is not a
	requirement.
 
DIRECTORY

 	Found on aminet sites in the directory:
 	pub/aminet/game/2play
 
FILENAME

	SerStratego.lha		48856 bytes long.
