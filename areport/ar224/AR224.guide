It's always something.

As Commodore slides deeper and deeper into...whatever it is they're
sliding into, Amiga Report's been having trouble getting out of the
starting gate.  This isn't making ANYBODY happy, least of all the AR
staff.

So, it's time to shake things up a bit.  

Effective next issue, I will take over the position of Editor-In-Chief
of Amiga Report Magazine.  Robert Niles will stay on as Assistant Editor:
basically, we're pulling a switch.

It's time to announce some other changes as well.

A new European Editor will be named in the next issue, as will special
European correspondents.  Together, they will be the "point men" for
AR in Europe.

At the same time, it has become obvious in the past months that AR is
becoming a very large undertaking.  In light of this, I'm going to make
a change that Robert proposed back in January.  Effective after next
issue, Amiga Report will go to a bi-weekly format.

This is not a decision I make lightly...I've always prided AR on it's
nearly 0 lead time and uniqueness for being so regularly on-time.  But
facing the fact that AR hasn't quite lived up to the weekly deadlines
lately, combined with the realization that this is a really big job,
made me decide to make the change.

The AR Coverdisk will continue.  No worries.

I'm also going to add a feature or two.  One will be a sorely needed
writer's guide for potential submissions.  Another will be "AR Wanted",
a section where readers and staff members exchange ideas on what the
magazine needs.

Finally, I have a couple of messages directed at the members of the
Amiga Report direct Internet mailing list.

First, the new policy on magazine releases is this:  If Amiga Report
does not go out by the Monday following the Friday AR was scheduled
to be released on, a message will be sent out by one of the editors
explaining the difficulty.  No further messages will be sent (not
including the magazine) until a week later, if the problem still
exists.  This should avoid complaints while informing readers
who want to know what the problem is.

Second, for those of you who have directed mail to the mailing list
in the past: please don't.  If you have a complaint, send it to an
editor and the problem WILL be taken care of.  Mailing directly
to the list only causes more problems.

Thanks to everyone for sticking with us.

%%  An Open Letter From Commodore UK                                      %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Over the past few months the speculation about Commodore, and in particular
about the future of the Amiga, has been rife.

I would like to put "the record straight" so to speak, and bring you up to
date as to the latest position.

Our parent company, Commodore International Limited, and its subsidiary
Commodore Electronics Limited, are both in liquidation, under the
jurisdiction of the Bahamian Courts (C.I.L. and C.E.L. are both
registered in the Bahamas).

The liquidators, Delliotte Touche, are actively seeking to sell the assets
of both C.I.L. and C.E.L.

There are a number of bids in place for various combinations of the assets.
Colin Proudfoot and I, along with two senior executives of commodore
International (but not Mehdi Ali) have made a bid, which if successful
will give us the rights to manufacture, sell and market the whole range of
Commodore Products, past, present and future, on a world-wide basis.

We have raised the necessary finance and believe we will be successful
in our to purchase this business. If we are successful, we will give
priority to our core business, the UK and ensure that the loyalty that has
been shown to us will be rewarded.

Our budgets do include a significant level of advertising spoend, which
we will use to the very best effect.

The Amiga CD32, Amiga 1200, Amiga 4000 and CD 1200 will be produced and
sold during the Christmas period.  It is anticipated that if all goes to
schedule, we will be delivering product around the first week of November,
possible the second week.

It is our belief that by far the majority of retailers will be out of 
current stock by the end of September/early October, so there will
only be a short delay before new bundles arrive.

Rest assured, our plans include the best packs we have ever offered.

I know these are trying times for us all, but I give you my personal
word that we are doing everything in our power to ensure that not only
do we keep the Amiga family alive, but that we also lift the brand up
to its righful place at the top of the market where it belongs.

Thank you for your highly valued support, without which we would not have
a business worth fighting for.

Very best wishes

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

EGS Spectrum 28/24
EGS software version 6.2
2 megabytes RAM
Distributed by GVP


This week I received my second EGS Spectrum board. That should tell you how
much I like this board. Previously we had ECS A3000's, and about a month
ago we purchased a Retina board (the original Zorro II board). At the time
the price had just dropped to $330, so I picked one up. When the EGS
Spectrum dropped in price to about $375 I decided to buy one, and a second
to replace the Retina, after I realised how powerful it was on a Zorro III
machine. Please note that I cannot compare the EGS Spectrum to the Retina
on a Zorro II machine such as the A2000 since I do not have one.

EGS is the name of the extension to the Amiga operating system, and not the
hardware itself. Developed by Viona, the software is licensed to various
graphic board manufacturers. I spoke to Kermit Woodall at the Toronto
World of Amiga show and he insisted that EGS can be ported to almost any
graphics board in an extremely short time, and that the license fee for
each board is minimal, so write or call your board manufacturer and request
an EGS port!

Unlike the Retina, the Spectrum appears to operate at the same speed in any
resolution. In other words, dragging a window in a 24 bit screen is about
as fast as dragging it in an 8 bit screen, or a 3 bit ECS screen. Scrolling
is very quick and powerful, even for 24 bit images. EGS can also move large
bitmaps very smoothly, such as dragging a window without bounding boxes!

Some interesting features are the ability to use two monitors on one board,
using the EGS display and the native Amiga display. This would allow you to
have a virtual Workbench where some apps appear on one monitor and some on
the other, and possibly some on both. The mouse will move from one monitor
to the next. I have not tried this setup yet and am not sure exactly how it
works.

The board is also compatible with the EMPLANT Macintosh emulator, and was
quite fast. I was not pleased with the monitor support, but it may be
because I have not tinkered with the screenmodes properly. The Retina
supported "millions" of colors on the EMPLANT, while I have only been
able to access "256" colors using the EGS Spectrum. The Retina
automatically promotes screenmodes to the highest bitplane depth supported
by the OS or board, while the EGS only promotes screenmodes to predefined
EGS modes that have been configured to the monitor. My IDEK DR3114 monitor
has decent support, as does the CBM1950. I cannot comment on multiscan
monitors which will probably access better screenmodes.

EGS will not promote screenmodes like the Retina (although they include
what they call an EGS screen promotor). What it instead does is create new
scxreenmodes that you can use from most programs. For example, I have modes
like the following on Workbench 2.04 or greater:

  : NTSC:High Res                   16 colors
  : NTSC:High Res Laced             16 colors
  : NTSC:Super-High Res              4 colors
  : NTSC:Super-High Res Laced        4 colors
  : LEGSa:EGS 640x480              256 colors
  : LEGSa:EGS 800x600              256 colors
  : LEGSa:EGS 1024x724             256 colors
  : LEGSa:EGS 1280x900             256 colors
  : LEGSa:EGS 1600x1280            256 colors

A board such as the Retina would not have the LEGSa: modes, but it will
promote the NTSC: modes on an ECS machine to 256 colors instead of 16 or
4. These monitor modes are for Intuition, which is what most Amiga programs
run under. EGS modes however can use up to 16,777,216 colors or 65536 colors
in those same screenmodes (with some limits as screen sizes increase). If
memory is a problem, screens are buffered to Fast RAM when not displayed.

Since EGS can be used seperate to Intuition, there are new features
available that are not provided by Commodore via the Workbench. Think of
the EGS system as a new Workbench on your system which runs along with
your other software at the same time, on its own screen. Three major
additions are support for 24 bitplane screens as opposed to only 8 on AGA
or 5 on ECS/OCS, along with automatic dithering of all imagery. If you open
a 1 bitplane screen, using only black and white or monochrome, you can
display dithered 24 bit images automatically on the EGS work area. Third,
EGS has screenmodes that are easier to program for various chip sets and
graphics boards. In other words, programs do not have to worry about
whether a machine is ECS or AGA. Software generally works on boards such
as the Spectrum, Piccolo, the EGS-110, IV24, etc, without modification.

The EGS paint program, SpectraPaint, is a very basic paint program with some
interesting features. While it has some nice effects such as edge detection,
it lacks a true Amiga-style interface. Some of the drawing tools are the
type you would expect to find on a cheap Macintosh paint program, such as
drawing with a diagonal line. I can understand that maybe all features
should be supported, but there are not one but two diagonal line gadgets in
the main toolbox for drawing with, one angled left and one angled right.
I can understand that someone might want to draw with a small circle or
square but dedicating two gadgets to diagonal lines is ridiculous. Hopefully
programs like ImageFX by Kermit Woodall will offer more powerful painting
tools.

EGS also includes some tools, such as a nice screenblanker and a calculator
program that draws algebraic functions in 3D. I just had to mention it for
those of you who are into sine waves, matrices, etc. Eh? :)

EGS works with just about any Amiga program I have tried. It does not
guarantee that you will however be able to access more colors or larger
screen sizes, although I found it fairly good at accepting larger screen
sizes. Programs like Deluxe Paint will run under ECS or AGA, while a program
like PageStream can use the new screenmodes. The ECS or AGA screens will be
draggable, while EGS screens currently are not.

I am not going to say that the EGS Spectrum is the best board or that
everyone should buy it, since I have not compared it to other boards such as
the Piccolo, Picasso II, or Rainbow III. But if you have a Zorro III machine
such as an A3000 or A4000, you should look into this board. For the moment,
it has the best price/performance ratio of all the boards out there. If the
Picasso II or Retina ZIII came down in price to under $400, then they also
should be investigated. I intend to pick up a Picasso II board soon so I
will hopefully be able to compare it to that popular board.

The Retina gained popularity as it was the first board released, and the
Picasso II is very popular due to its draggable screens, but the EGS also
offers its retargetable screenmodes which will hopefully be gaining more
software support in the future. The EGS software will work without a
Spectrum board on most Amigas, using OCS, ECS, or AGA chipsets. Look for
the EGS demo on AMINET or orion.etsu.edu.

If anyone is interested in purchasing an EGS Spectrum 24 bit board with
2 megabytes of RAM, the company I work for sells them for $375, which is
a fairly competitive price. For more information, call (800) 730-0082.

Other than the PD software below, there are few EGS programs. The one I know
of is ImageFX (please note that there may be a specific EGS version).
Soft-Logik has also mentioned PageStream for the EGS, and I am currently
working on a 24 bit character generator for EGS, although I intend to
complete the AGA version first.

%%  graphicRECALL Review                          By: @{" David Tiberio " link P8-4}     %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


I recently saw a demonstration of graphicRECALL, a multimedia package by
FOCUS Gbr. This package is a database and presentation system for images
and animations. I know that it might not have the same features as Scala,
but when you have to call specific images or anims on demand, this is the
best package to use.

Let's say you have customers interested in seeing your work. You have been
doing animations for a few years, and have a large database of your work.
You can use graphicRECALL to produce thumbnail animations (using Art
Department Professional) or playback full screen images on demand. Each
anim or image would be given search keys or comments, and you would ask
graphicRECALL to search for matching images or anims. Then it will
display all matching images and remap the palette to your desired display
resolution.

Another use may be to display items that your company sells to clients.
For example, you might want to show off various cars that your auto
dealership sells, and play a short video of the car driving around. Or
maybe you want customers to be able to access your image database to find
the guy who mugged them last night, or to identify missing children.
graphicRECALL also controls VLAB systems, and grabs Toaster images. It
also works with the AirLink infrared device controller, allowing you to
control VCR's and other recording or playback devices. Audio support is
also included.

After speaking with some customers, I have learned that they are especially
pleased with the package and the support. FOCUS Gbr will custom design the
package to fit the needs of its customers, and supports various third
party hardware products. The author has assured me that it has been tested
on at least one graphics board, all though I will not mention its name
since it is not currently designed to be displayed on non-native Amiga
screens. graphicRECALL uses split multiple screens, while most graphics
boards do not support multiple screens.

I spoke to the author on the phone, and he mentioned that he was going to
be giving a demonstration tonight at his local Amiga user group meeting.
Unfortunately I was unable to attend since I had a dental appointment
(my first cavity ever!), but I will call him again to ask him how it went,
and maybe get some feedback from some of the others at the NYC AMUSE Amiga
user group. Maybe I can convince him to donate a copy for the Amiga Report
contest, and give one of our readers a chance to win another unique
package, but I won't know for sure until I pick up the phone and call him.
I'll clue you in on what happens, in one way or another. :)

graphicRECALL retails for under $100.

If you would like to find out more about graphicRECALL, contact Mark
Tiramani at FOCUS Gbr, (212) 826-1240, or email mtiramani@bix.com

%%  PhonePak Voice/FAX Review                By: @{" David Tiberio " link P8-4}         %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


If you want to have your own personal voicemail and ansering system,
PhonePak from GVP is one of the best choices. This system allows your
computer to answer the phone and accept FAXes, messages, and deliver
listings of services. Other features include telephone extensions and
multiline setups.

This product has been in development for many years, and also has been
available for years, but most people don't realise the power of this
system. With it, you can mimic telephone systems used by many large
companies.

The nice part about this board is that all messages and FAXes are stored
on your hard drive. Most PhonePak users will probably start leaving
their computers on all the time, so that the board can answer the phone.
If the computer is off, the phone works, but the PhonePak doesn't
answer for you. Audio messages can be played back using DirOpus, DSS,
and of course with PhonePak. I also set up a cron that runs the PhonePak
line manager every few hours in case I accidentally exit the program.

The most basic software setup is a simple answering machine. The message
can be one of the included messages, or it can be recorded at 9600Hz with
a digitizer (one is built into the card). The built in digitizer uses
the phone handset as the microphone. Although 9600Hz is rather low, it
does have decent clarity. In fact I have played music over it and it
does sound good.

A more advanced setup allows you to create mail boxes and extensions, so
the caller has to press an extension to transfer to, or automatically
be transferred by the system. Voice messages can be saved, along with
FAXes. When viewing a FAX, an audio message will also be played if it
was recorded by the FAX sender.

The number of extensions is almost limitless. Each one has its own
extension number and parent mail box. You could also design extension
based upon employee names. I like to use my area code (516) as an
extension because it helps people remember it when they call. Also,
I could program it to use the initials of our employees or their first
names. For example, using the initials of Bob xanth, a person would
hit 29 on the phone keypad. Most words are hard to spell out using
numbers, but it can be done. I have too many 0's in my office phone
number, so I can't make up a sensible word. My grandmother though
has a good one; her number (different area code though) spells out
NAB-FOOD, which is what I usually do when I visit her. :) But of
course she doesn't have a clue on how computers and codes work
(apparantly like most of our contest readers... heh). :)

The board can also detect a FAX machine that has called the line and
receive the FAX automatically, such as from a SupraFAX modem, another
PhonePak, or a standard FAX machine. The PhonePak however is paperless,
using IFF files for saving or importing FAXes. It can also import
ASCII text to a FAX, using the included PhonePak font (actually the
font is CGTriumverate at 33 pointsize). The FAXes can optionally be
redirected to a printer.

Another nice feature of the board is that you can enter a DTMF code
on the touch tone keypad of a phone on the system and simulate calling
into the system. This is very nice for testing out how it works.

PhonePak also comes with its own scripting language. Most likely users
will use the ringing and transfer functions, although it can also
schedule events. One thing I would like is to be able to tunr it off
and run my BBS on off hours, which I expect the PhonePak can do
easily just be modifying the number of rings.

One lacking feature is a ZModem protocol. In our modern age of computing,
it would be nice for someone with a computer to be able to call and
upload a file to my computer while I am away.

PhonePak also has a remote access system, using passwords. I can call
from vacation and check messages, delete them, or change the answer
messages that I had recorded. A small trifold card is included which
I keep in my wallet. I also recently added a 1-800 toll free number,
so customers can call my office, or to allow me to check on my messages
remotely. Of course though you need a touch tone phone in order to
do this.

Amiga 3000 users will have problems if they have a REV 9 Buster. I bought
2 new REV 11 Busters, neither of which worked with my system. The
board would not be detected. So I instead bought a 16 bit RAM board and
transferred my static column ZIPs from the motherboard to the RAM
board, enabling the PhonePak to work properly.

Looks like we have another stumper here. After a few entries had been
received, all of them came up with the same answer, which is no where near
what I am looking for. But I assure you that if you figure out how to win,
I will answer immediately!


    - THE PRIZE FOR NEXT MONTH -

CONTEST BEGINS: 7-29-94
CONTEST ENDS: 8-26-94

The Amiga Report contest is still going on, and it is not too
late to enter. This ongoing monthly contest allows Amiga Report
readers a chance to win software by either solving a puzzle or by
entering a random drawing.

The prize this month is the Amiga/Toaster Reference Manual v2.221,
from Area52. This is a 1,000 page help system for the Amiga and Video
Toaster, covering the Workbench, AmigaDOS, Lightwave, and more ($34.95).
The second prize choice is the FutureShock audio CDROM,  which was
produced using Amiga computers by SideWinder. There are some Sidewinder
music modules on Aminet that you may want to look at for a sample of
the audio CD ($12.95).
Another possible prize is SubVersion, a strategy submarine hunt
game by Point of View Computing. Both a Mac and IBM version is included
along with the Amiga version.
We have also been offered some AMINET CD-ROMs and some database
software which have not arrived yet.

Previously we have offered the ARexx Reference Disk by Merrill
Callaway, which was awarded to a previous winner. Contact Whitestone
for more information (505) 268-0678. More prizes will be announced
as they become available.

All monthly contests end on the morning of the first of the
following month. Any entries beyond this date will be entered into the
next contest. In the event that you were announced as a winner and
did not receive your prize, please contact me by email.


- THE MONTHLY DRAWING -

To enter the random drawing, select a number from 1 to 262,144
and send it to me at one of my addresses listed below, either by
the postal service or email through the Internet.
Also, you may enter by solving the following puzzle. The winner
of this puzzle will be decided within the same time frame as the
random prize, to allow the contest information to filter through the
networks, and to allow your letters and postcards to come in.


- THE PUZZLE -

Since people complained that the first contest was too hard, and
that the second was too easy, I made one that anyone can solve with
a little thought. The third problem should have been obvious... the
first word was as big of a push in the right direction as you could
get. Now we will try a more mathematical problem, which is very easy
to solve. If you are not too familiar with matrix manipulations, just
look for the right resources and you will find all the help you need
(help is everywhere!). Of course, this is another one of those trick
problems.

There are two matrices, A and B. Each matrix will have a
value applied to it, and you must determine the answer. The
value is specified by x, and the answers you must provide are
Ax = ?, and Bx = ?.

x = (151647 - 61615)

    [ 7 8 9 ]       [ 1 2 3 ]
A = [ 4 5 6 ]   B = [ 4 5 6 ]
    [ 1 2 3 ]       [ 7 8 9 ]
    [ 0 0 0 ]       [ 0 0 0 ]

What does Ax equal, and what does Bx get you? Also provide
your method of obtaining the answer. I understand that there
may be cultural differences for this problem... not all math is
the same (you should see how my mother does long division!). So
just make a good guess ::heh heh::. With a little research, you
can determine the answers. You may want to look for information
on matrix multiplication.
As a special bonus, the first person to successfully supply the
correct answer will automatically win. If you feel that you
definitely have the answer, get in touch with me with what you have
learned. If you do everything correctly, I will answer to let
you know :).

As an additional clue, the x value has a special code in it that has
to do with area.


- TO ENTER -

To enter, simply let your fingers do the talking and write an
email and send it to dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu. You MUST put
the word CONTEST in the subject line of the email header! Otherwise
you run the risk of having your email deleted (don't ask, it is a
long story!) or send a post card or letter to:

Amiga Report Contest
c/o David Tiberio
6 Lodge Lane
East Setauket, NY 11733

Is it possible to win via snail mail? You might think that your
chances of winning are better by entering in email (much faster of
course), but last month's winner send in a letter that arrived the
day before his winning number was drawn!

In your letter or email, please provide the following:

Your full name and address. Please keep in mind that many of
you may have addresses that I am not accustomed to, so please include
your country or any other information that I would need in case you
win. An email address should also be included, if possible.

You must also include a brief one sentence overview of the editorial
in this issue of AMiga Report. Just to make sure you are reading it. :)
You must also include the issue number. For example, if you read this in
AR213, then include that in your correspondance. Also, a prize winner
will be determined by a random number generator. Choose a number from
1 to 262,144. The closest winner or winners to the randomly generated
number will receive the prize in the mail. Anyone who does not provide
a number will have one assigned to him randomly.

All prizes will be mailed within one week after I get my hands on
the published version of AmigaReport. I am doing this for a few reasons.
First, every winner so far has given the correct puzzle solution before
I have received the editon of AmigaReport that announced it. :)
Second, I don't like to go to the post office every day if I can avoid
it. Third, you never know when someone's power supply might blow up
(right Mr. Editor?!).


- RULES AND REGULATIONS -

1. In the evnt that the editor's power supply fries, the contest for
   that month will have its deadline postponed to a later date, to be
   announced. Any contest entries for the random drawing will be added
   to the next month's drawing, to be held once per month near the
   beginning of the month.

2. All prizes are donated. I cannot be held responsible for any damage
   caused by a prize. For example, if you leave your prize on the
   stairs and your grandmother slips on it, I will not pay her medical
   bills.

3. We are not doing this for any profit, and cannot be held responsible
   if we go out of business or are otherwise financially unable to give
   you anything! We are actively looking for submissions from other
   software authors.

4. Good things come to those who read the rules and regulations! Here
   is a tip to help you win: every problem is a trick problem, or gives
   you clues that are not part of the problem itself. Read the whole
   entire contest entry looking for clues. And read my other articles
   for more clues. I give some very obvious clues :).

5. If for any circumstance you are awarded a prize but do not receive
   it, contact me at (516) 476-1615. I will promptly attend to any
   mistakes that have been made.

6. These rules are subject to change at any time without warning!

7. All entries so far have been using A, and that is why they are wrong!


- THE DISCLAIMER -

DISCLAIMER: This contest is being provided as a service to the
Amiga community and all persons involved in running this contest
cannot be held liable for anything that costs you money or
lifetime pain and anguish. Rules are subject to change. All entries
must be received by whenever TBA. Any entries beyond this date
will be entered into the next contest, if any.


- THE CHANCE YOU WILL WIN -

Odds of winning are approximately 1:50 for the random drawing and
1:15 for the correct answer to the puzzle, based upon current entries.

SPECIAL THANKS to SideWinder for donating the Future Shock albums
for inclusion in our contest, along with Merrill Callaway for his ARexx
Reference Disk!

THIS MONTH'S WINNERS:

    John Tyrrell, of Nepean, Ontario!

    and Allen J Newton, of Albuquerque, New Mexico!


THE PUZZLE:

Everyone thinks that the other code problem was too easy, which
it was. So this month I made it a bit tricky (and I don't want to
hear any complaints that the solutions are too hard)! This is a
transcript of a press conference about a military operation somewhere
in the United States. Your job is to figure out which companies are
involved. In the next few issues I will make the clues gradually
become easier.

    Gore, the Vice President, made the statement.
    He said he would, but very quietly.

    The engineers are locked up on the island.
    They are computer experts.

    They are no longer incorporated, but AmigaGuide is stored there.
    That is why their fort is so valuable.
    The banner on the building reads "BRCH".

    The surface to air missile drowned in the sea.
    Squad A had to move into the area at 5:00pm, as they always do.
    Strategic Operations in  New York handled the affair.
    They landed opposite their destination.
    There is no other way to calm the port.

    The rest will be printed at a later time.


THE WRONG ANSWERS:

We only had 2 submissions. One person suggested that Commodore USA was
the company. Ha! There are 14 companies hidden in the clues.


THE WINNING ANSWER:

The prize winner is Allen J Newton, with 2 of 14 correct!


THE BREAKDOWN:

 -- Gore, the Vice President, made the statement.
GVP is the answer, by using the initials of Gore, the Vice President.

 -- He said he would, but very quietly.
He said he would, softly. It was a "soft would", or SoftWood.

 -- The engineers are locked up on the island.
Alcatraz, former island prison in the Western US. And we all know which
Amiga developer does its development at "Alcatraz", from reading the
first year or so of NewTek advertisements for the Video Toaster. Remember,
the lights are still on at 'Traz.

 -- They are computer experts.
They are pros when it comes to microcomputers, or MicroProse.

 -- They are no longer incorporated, but AmigaGuide is stored there.
To be incorporated means to have limited liabilities. Some companies are
known as "Inc.", "Corp.", or "Ltd.". Well, they are no longer incorporated,
so they are no longer limited to liabilities, making them Unlimited.
And where is AmigaGuide stored? In SYS:Utilities. This company was
Utilities Unlimited.

 -- That is why their fort is so valuable.
Which fort is the most valuable? Maybe Fort Knox, where the United States
keeps all its gold (this is a US military operation according to the press
release). The mystery company is US Gold.

 -- The banner on the building reads "BRCH".
Everyone knows the relation between "IBM" and "HAL", where each letter is
shifted one character. Well, "BRCH" is adjacent to "CSDI" and "AQBG". I
took both and combined them, which would form "ASDG", using the first and
last from one and the middle two from the other.

 -- The surface to air missile drowned in the sea.
The SAM (surface to air missile) sunk. It was Samsung!

 -- Squad A had to move into the area at 5:00pm, as they always do.
The squad is a group of people, in this example I said Squad A, hoping
to remind people of the A-Team (with Mr. T). And they meet at 5pm, or
17:00 in "military time" or on a 24 hour clock. In other words, they are
Team 17.

 -- Strategic Operations in  New York handled the affair.
S.O.N.Y. handled the affair.

 -- They landed opposite their destination.
What is opposite their destination? Their Origin is.

 -- There is no other way to calm the port.
This is the hardest. The "port" refers to the sea port since they were
on an island surrounded by water. But a port can also be a window, such
as a porthole, or a door. The other way is to calm the door instead, or
calm-a-door = Commodore.

 -- The rest will be printed at a later time.
The later time will be sometime in the future, for Future Publishing, makers
of Amiga Format (I think)!

THE APOLOGY:

Sorry that they were so hard, and that a few issues of AmigaReport did
not make it out due to computer and network failures (phone company)!
But the phone company will be able to make up for it in the current
contest. :)

While many of our readers are in some way connected to the Internet, there
are still a large number of users who are not connected to the Internet for
one reason or another. There is a world out there that you are missing!

First, for most users, the Internet is free. People gain access through
school systems (at colleges and universities), through the workplace, or
from public access networks. Some systems have direct connections, while
others use a UNIX to UNIX communications protocol.

USENET has a public messaging service that is similar to a huge message base
connected throughout the world. While some topics may be local to the host
systems, there are thousands of topics to choose from. Some of these topics
include Amiga hardware, applications, programming, emulators, and reviews.
There are about 15-20 different worldwide news groups for Amiga users, with
an average readership of about 50,000 people per news topic. These messages
are read by students, government employees (once a NASA employee was spotted
reading USENET news during a shuttle launch last year), and even Amiga
developers such as Scala, DKB, Commodore, and ASDG. Another nice thing about
USENET is that there is often at least one person who has the solution to
your problem, and usually there are hundreds of people with the same
problems and solutions.

AMINET is a rather large file base, containing thousands of programs and
other files specifically for the Amiga. This is done via FTP sites, which
are common throughout the Internet. While the list of files on Amiga is
about 750k in size, there is at least one site whose file listing is over
9 megabytes in size! That is a large file to download just to see what files
are available! Some sites contain all the Fred Fish disks, while others
contain hundreds of pictures, 3D objects, or audio samples. Many companies
as place software updates or demos on FTP sites. For example, orion.etsu.edu
has a site dedicated for EGS graphics boards, while the tricity site has
every version of the EMPLANT Macintosh emulation software ever released!

ARCHIE will search file sites to find matching filenames from a search
pattern. Unfortunately, there may be thousands of matches, and they may
search files that are on weird FTP sites. It is a powerful system, although
the AMINET system itself is very organized.

GOPHER is kind of like a BBS system with different informational sources
online. For example, one site has hundreds of prophecies translated from
Nostradamus into English.

IRC is a realtime chat line, also including people from all over the world.
The strange part is that some of the people on the Amiga channel are there
almost all the time! The Amiga channel usually has between 20 and 50
people on it at once. Once 50 people are online, the conversations move
along very quickly. Here you can meet various developers, such as former
Commodore engineers, the author of ImageFX, XPK, Term, and even the Prevue
Guide (used by cable companies to show TV listings on an Amiga based
system). Robots such as Mama and Merbot are always online to talk to, send
messages to people not online, or to get files from FTP sites.

MUDS are online games, similar in concept to Dungeons and Dragons, in
realtime. This allows you to play text and sometimes graphics adventures
with people sitting at home thousands of miles away, all unknown to you.
Other games include war games such as Risk, where players fight for land
and armies.

EMAIL is one of the most basic resources available. Here users can send
messages around the world in under 10 minutes, passing from system to
system until they arrive at their destinations. Users can also UUENCODE
files and mail them to each other, or download files from FTP sites to
email addresses. Users can also communicate with pay services such as
GEnie, Portal, and CompuServe. Last of all, users can subscribe to email
discussion lists with topics such as Lightwave 3D, AMOS, and EGS.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  Sidewinder: Future Shock II and others     By: @{" David Tiberio " link P8-4}       %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the past few months I had received two Future Shock II audio CD's from
Sidewinder for contest prizes in the Amiga Report contest. At this time
both were awarded to contest winners, but before receiving the discs I
decided to download some Sidewinder music modules that were available on
Aminet (ftp.wustl.edu). A player or editor is required to listen to music
modules from Aminet.

Although I have commented on his music in a previous article, I would like
to take this time to mention a little bit more about what Sidewinder has
done for his audio CD. The majority of the CD was produced using Amiga
computers, in this case an Amiga 2000 with ProTracker 1.3 and MED 3.22.
15 titles are included, many of which are on Aminet in pub/amiga/mods/sidew
or pub/aminet/mods/sidew:

    Aftershock
    Passion Slave
    Catch It Up
    Slicetacy
    Rainy December
    Tribal to Space
    Reflects
    Tales From the Rave
    Back 2 A Time
    Anastasia
    Transport
    Future Shock II
    Control <Cubic>
    NXL CIO
    Ari - San <Crossroad>

On the back of the CD is a credit to the Commodore Amiga, and a listing of
the hardware and software used by Sidewinder. The cover has a ray traced or
modeled image, with a very nice stone texture. And last of all, the inside
cover is hand autographed, although he may or may not be signing all of
the CD's.

I particularly liked the HouseBeetles song... it sounds like something you
would hear in a beach movie. Rainy December and Rainy September are also
very good, and although Old Smoke isn't exactly a popular music style among
today's youths, it still was put together very nicely.

The Future Shock II audio CD's are $12.95, a very good price for a part of
the Amiga's history.

Commodore US has set up two new phone numbers:

610-666-2595 and 610-666-2728.

However, the person I talked to hung up on me after I asked her two
questions.  I haven't called back yet for an explanation.

Commodore UK's chiefs, Colin Proudfoot and David Pleasance, have
sent a widespread message.  While they do not claim to have
ownership of Commodore, the body of the message makes it very
clear that they intend to try VERY hard to acquire it.

All official channels are still silent on an owner.


Product announcements and news from Utilities Unlimited, taken from
a message from Jim Drew, CEO.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have not had chance to work on much actually.  I met with IBM in Las
Vegas a few weeks ago to discuss the PowerPC emulation, and I meet with
Apple on the 9th of August to discuss the same (Apple just made an
announcement of this).  I have spent too much time with big corporations
besides IBM and Apple (wanting to be exclusive distributors for our
products).
 
So, we are still working on finishing the 486DX emulation.  It is going
through a complete overhaul as we have found a way to make the emulation
use less CPU time with equiv speed results we are getting now.
 
We have finalized 'The EDGE', our video board.  It is 64 bit wide Cirrus
Alpine graphics processor interfaced to a Zorro III slot.  There are some
really nice features of this board... it is 100% backwards compatible,
meaning that we will be able to emulate the Picasso, Piccolo, and EGS
Spectrum video boards (run their software).  Also, since the Alpine chip
supports real video modes, the 8, 16, and 32 bit MAC video modes are
DIRECT... 640x480x32 realtime animation... 80 megapixels per second.
Retail price is tenatively set at $299 with 0K RAM (uses 72 pin SIMMs..
up to 16 megs... 4 required).
 
I just finished a new empser.device that supports hardware handshaking
and baud rates up to 921.6K baud (can you say networking), and I am
trying to finish up the empscsi.device.
 
I have hired an Amiga programmer, who is also a IBM specialist.  His name
is Mark Wignall and he was on the Techtronic's Phaser series printer
design team (firmware and such).  He will be writing the majority of our
PC utilities included with the 486DX emulations.
 
I plan on hiring several more Amiga programmers as we have quite a few
things planned for the fall, and I fear that my role as a programmer will
slowly fade away into the business end (rats!).
 
Oh, another goodie that I have finalized is called 'MEDIA'.  This lets
you use any type of floppy drive guts (including 2.88mb drives) with your
Amiga... Zorro II/III board.  Lets you read/write/duplicate any disk
format... no exceptions (yes, including 800K MAC disks).  No price set
yet..but I would imagine around $149.

I just got back from a vacation in Snowmass, Colorado, where I learned
that it really can get up to 95 at 8,800 feet elevation and the takeout
food is lousy.

Unfortunately, nothing momentous happened while I was away...I was hoping
the Commodore situation would be resolved (kind of like the old "watched
teapot" not boiling...)  Lots and lots of rumors, centralized around
"Samsung won the bidding!" and "Commodore UK won the bidding!"  No
official word, though, and that's what I'm going to rely on.

Duncan Fraser at Commodore Canada West had the same idea.  He even took
a week off.  When he came back, there was nothing new.

It's worth mentioning at this point that, so far as I can discern in
the US and so far as Duncan can discern in Canada, North America's
distributors are out of Amigas.  (BMD, CEI and another Canadian one
he mentioned top the list)

For this reason, Commodore Canada West will be closing, likely within
the week.  The employees are tentatively joining TVI, which shares the
office with C= Canada West.

I secured a couple of interviews for this week's issue.  They're both
with great guys, but unfortunately with great guys who are no longer
going to develop for the Amiga.  Grrrrrrr...

Will anyone please send me a transcript of Amiga User International's
tirade on me?  I sent them a letter months ago and they've apparently
decided to rip it to shreds publicly...

That's it for this week.  Check out our other features.

%% The Voice From Across the Pond		       By Michael Wolf  %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


First of all a big 'hello there' to all readers of Amiga Report.  This is
my first article and I hope that you like it.

I plan to review all interesting new releases from Europe, mainly from
Germany. Some products will be available in the U.S. and some won't be.

This time I will give you a summary of three Motion JPEG boards from
Germany, as well as some info on the first '060 board and some personal,
subjective and biased ;^) comments.

All the information in this article is taken from various ads and articles
I read, plus from a couple phone calls that I made.  The only boards that
I've seen in action were the VideoCruncher and the DSP PAR.  The stats
given may not be 100% correct, but they ought to be close ;-)

Let's start off with the Motion JPEG boards.  At the moment there are two
boards available, the VLab Motion by MacroSystem (many of you know the
VLab framegrabber) and the VideoCruncher by Ingenieurbuero Helfrich (makers
of the Piccolo graphics board).  A third board, the Snapshot Motion by
Videotechnik Diezemann, is due to be released in November at this year's
WOC in Cologne.

These boards are aimed at the semi-professional / industrial video market,
unlike NewTek's Flyer which is supposed to offer a better image quality (at
a price).

Let me make a short excursion to look at the video market in Europe from my
point of view.  Broadcast qualtiy is a prime issue if you want your
production to be on TV.  No serious video studio would rely on non-linear
systems for production (may be for preview purposes, but not for the 'final
cut').  The industrial market is quite small but growing (Yes, and I want
to grow with it ;-).  The Toaster revolution never happened here (no PAL
Toaster, sigh !), and there is no product on the market that offers the
same bang for the buck.  The closest thing is the Fast Video Machine for
PC's and Mac's, and it is priced well above $5000.  Last year when I
visited the states I was quite suprised of the large Toaster user base, all
of them used professionally.

Well, enough drivel, back to the review...

So, what do I needs these boards for ?  Well, conventional video editing is
quite costly.  You have to invest thousands of dollars to set up a decent
video studio.  Video cutting also stresses the video decks, and the only
person who is glad about that is the guy from the service shop when he
gives you the bill. If you want to add spectacular effects you have to rely
on a video switcher such as the toaster, but amazing effects (such as 3D
twirls of live video) aren't possible then either. If you want to record
you precious 3D animations as well then you will need a single frame capable
video recorder, increasing your investement again.

In come the M-JPEG boards.  If you tried to grab your video directly to
your computer, you would have to be able to store around 30MB every second.
Only high end machines (such as the more expensive Silicon Graphics
computers), can handle that much.  The solution is to compress every single
image in real time.  JPEG is a common compression standard for images, but
it has one drawback, it is lossy.  Right now lots of chip sets appear that
allow for JPEG compression in real time (i.e.  full frame video in 25 (NTSC
30) frames per second).  The more you compress the image, the more
information you loose.  You are free on the other hand to decide how much
you want to compress.  Note that if you decompress an image, process it and
compress it again you will loose some quality, not unlike the quality loss
when going through copying generations in conventional video.

To achieve S-VHS (or HI8) quality you will have to use a compression ratio
of around 1:15 (i.e. 30 MB/sec ends up as 2 MB/sec). Most boards can range
the compression ratio from 1:2 to 1:100.

The VLab Motion and the VideoCruncher are both based on the LSI JPEG chip
set, as used on the DSP PAR board.  The Snapshot Motion will be based on
chips by Thoran.  All three boards use standard Amiga hard disk partitions
for storage of the M-JPEG data, the Snapshot Motion will feature an
on-board SCSI host adapter as well.  Hard disk speed and storage capacity
are prime requisites for these board to work efficiently, a sustained
read/write performance of 1 - 2 MB/sec and 500 MB of storage are the
recommended minimum.  High speed DMA SCSI host adapters such as the
Fastlane Z3 and the DKB 4091 are perfectly suited for this task.

Data throughput is a major issue.  The VLab Motion is a Zorro II board, the
VideoCruncher a Zorro II/III board (autosensing) and the Snapshot Motion is
designed as a Zorro III board.  I have my doubts to whether the Zorro II
design of the VLab Motion will suffice for high quality M-JPEG streams,
Zorro III is definetely an advantage.

Video:

All boards obviously allow real time grabbing of video.  While both the
VLab Motion and the Snapshot Motion grab at full 768x576 pixels (PAL) the
VideoCruncher only processes videos at 468x352 pixels (why is a mystery to
me, it is based on the same chip set as the VLab Motion).

All boards capture a YUV 4:2:2 signal ( one colour sample for every
luminance sample), the Snapshot Motion can grab anything from 4:4:4 to
4:1:1, the VideoCruncher can grab 4:1:1 as well.

Audio:

All three boards allow 16 bit audio to be recorded.  The VLab Motion
requires the Toccata audio board, VideoCruncher relies on the Sunrise
AD-516 and the Snapshot Motion will have an audio option on board.

All audio boards can sample from 5.5 to 48Khz.  The Toccata also supports
hardware based audio compression (from 16 to 8 bit with a small loss in
quality). The AD-516 can play back up to 8 tracks, the Snapshot Motion will
be able to play back 4 and the Toccata plays back 2 tracks of audio.

The software:

MacroSystem includes MovieShop.  It supports all basic functions such as
grabbing, cutting and pasting, but no time line editing.  MovieShop has an
ARexx port.  ADPro savers and loaders are included.  You cannt sync video
and audio using timecode, MacroSystem plans to release MovieShop Pro soon,
which, amongst other things, includes a special fx generator.

The VideoCruncher also features no more than a simple editing program,
cut&paste and im-/export functions are common to all boards.  Here again
you can optionally get Diva Pro, a full editing program that is more
intuitive to use.

The Snapshot Motion will included editing software by ProDAD, creators of
ClariSSA, Adorage and the new Monument Video Titler.  It will work as a one
monitor solution.  Editing is accomplished using a PIP representation of
the video.  Again, their editing software can be upgraded to a more
advanced version (see below).

Special features:

All boards have some special features on board.

The VLab Motion includes a Genlock / Bluebox. It syncs with an external
video source and allows you to mix the M-JPEG file and the external video 
using chroma / luminance keying. It also includes a scaler chip to scale
the video when playing back.

The VideoCruncher is equiped with 2 MB dualported VideoRAM, which allows
you to use it as a frame buffer as well. It does double buffering and
supports an 8 bit overlay. VideoCruncher PIP in conjunction with a Piccolo
board allows you to play back videos in a window on a Piccolo screen. The
VideoCruncher also allows you to use the JPEG chips as coprocessors to
de-/encode JPEG images.

The VideoCruncher works well inc conjunction with the PeggyPlus board by
the same company.  The software included with the PeggyPlus allows you to
directly convert a M-JPEG video stream to MPEG.

The Snapshot Motion also features a scaler chip, that can be used while
playing back video. You can even control the scaler during playback, i.e.
allowing you to use it as a magnifying glass, stretch your video or add
those trendy cinemascope bars. The scaler chip interpolates the pixels, so
you will always get a smooth image. It is heavily used by the editing
software.

Also on board is a Genlock / Bluebox, allowing you to layer live video,
M-JPEG video and Amiga images.  Plus the audio board ( 2 track recording, 4
track playback) and the SCSI host adapter.

My opinion:
-----------

Do you really want to know ? Well, all boards serve their purpose.

The VLab Motion, while suffering from the slow Zorro II , is certainly the
best board for video at this price range.  I imagine it competing quite
well against the DSP PAR for example.  This board is the only option for
doing video work on an A2000.  You ought to have your SCSI host adaptor on
an accelerator board though, as not to slow down the Zorro II bus too much.

If you plan to create MPEG streams then the VideoCruncher is a must.  The
direct port to the Peggy Plus board, and the easy M-JPEG -> MPEG conversion
process make these boards an ideal combination. I can't recommend it for
producing video work, mainly because of the poor resolution. You could use
it for proofing your video cut or animation.

The Snapshot Motion is my clear favourite.  Then again, it is only
vapourware so far.  It has all the features you would want for that price
on board, and the used M-JPEG chip set is supposed to be superior to the
LSI solution. Let's wait and see what happens until November.

Let me add two short notes, on concerning M-JPEG boards, the other
concerning new Amiga boards in general.

I read a review in a recent issue of a german computer magazine, concerning
PC M-JPEG boards in the same price range as the three mentioned here.

I will just say on thing: they do max. 384x288 @25fps.

Now concerning the Amiga.  We all know that CBM is virtually dead, and
nobody knows what's going to happen to the Amiga.  The hardware
manufacturers are hesitant to develop Zorro III boards, because the base of
machines is very small and this might not change in the near future.
Videotechnik Diezemann is optimistic, they want to put the Snapshot Motion
on the market.  Rumour has it that other companies (Helfrich and their 64
bit gfx board) will wait and see before the continue putting money into
Amiga developement.

This makes MacroSystem's decision for a Zorro II board (larger user base)
understandable.

Part II
-------

Here are some short infos on various new developements:

AS&S (makers of the Blizzard accelerators and the Fastlane Z3) are shipping
the first '060 board for the Amiga. The Cyberstorm is a modular board
designed for the A4000 (support for the A3000 and A4000T is planned). It is
available as an '040 (40 Mhz, ~35 MIPS) or '060 (50 Mhz, ~90 MIPS) board.
RAM can be expanded on board to a maximum of 128 MB using standard 32bit
SIMMS.

Two expansion boards are in developement. One will feature a fast second
level cache for the processor board. The I/O board expands the system with
a Fast-SCSI II interface (same as the Fastlane), ethernet and a high speed
serial board.

Prices:
Cyberstorm '060/50		$1812
Cyberstorm '040/40		$1250
Cyberstorm '040/0		$ 687	(no CPU, for A4000/040 owners)
second level cache board	n/a
I/O board 			n/a

---

ProDAD (ClariSSA, Adorage) announce the Monument Titler, a video titler
based on the SSA anim format that wors with real time effects. Features
include timeline editing, continous scrolling, improved anti-aliasing,
texures and attributes for the included outline fonts.

ProDAD is also working on a video editing program, Video Media concept.
It is modular and can be expanden with other products such as ClariSSA or
SCALA. It features timeline editing, supports various video protocols
and controls components such as audio mixers.

I assume that a scaled down version will be shipped with the Snapshot
Motion.

Price:
Monument Titler			$156
Video Media concept		$625 (internal), $812 (external),
				$2187 (professional)

Whew, I'm done for the day.

> What projects have you done on the Amiga?

We have so far only completed two Amiga games, namely: Pinball Dreams
(Released March 1992) and Pinball Fantasies (Original Version released
Oktober 1992).  We also made the AGA and CD32 versions of Fantasies
(Both released September 1993).  We also co-developed the PC version
of Pinball Fantasies.  All other versions of these two games has
NOTHING to do with DI part from being based on our original products.

Sad to say with the current status of Commodore I do not see our
selves commiting to another Amiga project after completing Benefactor
and Pinball Illusions.  The reason is very very simple, It takes us 1
year to develop a game and in a years time the Amiga market is not
going to be able ti support us finacially i.e. we would loose money
doing an Amiga game.  

Another reason is that within a years time there is going to be 2-3
machies available on the market that technically is 100-200 times as
powerfull for games as the A1200 and CD32.  And due to the fact that
we are visionaries and want to do the best possible jobb, the current
Amiga hardware can not compete.

> What's YOUR vision of the perfect Amiga solution? [the best answer, the best

1. Somebody with a lot of cash needs to buy commodore.  Currently
   there is talk of a the UK commodore buying the US parent.  This
   would most likely see the death of the Amiga within 1 year as these
   people do not have the money to found new developement, they only
   have one core market (The UK) and they currently have no machines!
   It would take them 2-3 months to get new machines to the UK and
   that would at the current time mean they would loose the X-mas
   market which would make them bancrypt within 6 months.

2. If somebody like Samsung buys commodore, I believe they would be
   best of dropping the CD32 because they will not sell a single
   machine outside the UK when the new japanses machines from SEGA,
   SONY and NINTENDO arrives.

3. They should have 3 base machines on the market:

   1) The A1200 but with 4 MB of Fast ram added on the mother board
      And 80 MB Hardisk as standard. Price 300

   2) An A1200 like the one above but with built in CD-ROM drive.
      Price 450

   3) The A4000/040 with SCSI and CD-ROM drive. Price 1500

4. They should make sure that the AAA chipset gets done and on that
   chipset build three machines like the ones above but with AAA in
   them but the A1200 one having an 68030 and the A4000 on an 68060!

What we want to do with the Pinball Illusions is to finally put in all
the features that we have had to leave out before for diffrent reasons
such as processor power, time our machine capabilities.

This time we have 4 color dor matrix displays (like the real thing),
A score system much like all the latest REAL tables on the market,
with loads of MODES and special bits. We have diffrent display modes,
we have animated features on the tables, and most of all we have
MULTIBALL!!  (we have had 15 balls on screen running in a frame on the
A4000/040, you want get more then two in the A1200/CD32 verison
though).  We also feel this time that the table designs are much
better and have many more features on them so that it will take you
longer to score everything and also it will be even harder to get
scores which are hard to beat!

> As for Benefactor- I admit that it's a fairly new name to me.  Care to fill me
> in on just what it is?

Benefactor is a cross between Flashback, Lemmings and loadrunner,
which s turned out to be nothing like those games at all.  It is a
PUZZLE game palyed in a Platform enviorment.  You are the hero that
on each level have to free the merry men that are trapped arounf the
level, these are two kinds the colored ones that are abel to haelp you
by accessing inreachable areas or build things for you etc etc. The
other kinf is the evil kind that will destroy everything in its way
and walk into any deat trap, these needs to be moved to a coloring
machine so that they can get coloured and help you out.  Once all the
Merry men is at the exit in a colored form you may exit.

> How does Digital Illusions go about tacking projects like Pinball Illusions or
> Benefactor?  How much of the work is done in house, who has what
> responsibilities, etc.?

Currently we are 8 people (3 programmers, 3 graphics artists, 1 music
guy and me as a manager, designer etc)

Each game gets 1 programmer and 1 graphics artisst assigned and then
the music guy and me helps out on all projects.

Currently we are dveloping:

PINBALL ILLUSIONS on the A1200 and CD32

Code: Andreas Axelsson
GFX:  Markus Nystrm

BENEFACTOR on MEGA-CD (Amiga version is finished):

Code: Thomas Andersson
GFX:  Patrik Bergdahl

HARDCORE on MEGA-CD and MEGADRIVE:

Code: Bo-Staffan Lankinen
GFX:  Joakim Wejdemar

All music by: Olof Gustafsson
And additional design on all games by me: Fredrik Liliegren

We usally start out with a vague idea of what we want to do, then we
make a small preview showing the basics of the game, this demo is then
showed to the most interesting publishers.  If any of them gets
interested we will sign a contract, get some money, miss all deadlines
with 6-10 months and then end up seeing our game pirated to death
within 2 days of release.

And that piracy is another reason for dropping the AMIGA, if we solf
as many units of our games as there are people out there enjoying our
efforts we would only be working on the AMIGA!!!

So, why do an emulator?  What made it more fulfilling than a game or a
utility?


Originally, I wrote "Apple 2000" as a for-fun project, to start applying my
new skills in 68000 assembly (which I was learning). I chose the Apple
emulator for varied reasons- I grew up with and loved my apple, I missed
many of the games it had, and there weren't any other useable emulators out
there. Since I knew the Apple hardware and 6502 intimately, and after
writing a couple bare-bone preliminary versions of the emulator in C, I
knew I could do this, I knew I could do well, and I knew I could do it right.

I chose to do this instead of a game because I really couldn't think of a
game worth writing (for my skill level at the time). I don't think the
world wanted a 203'rd version of "Mines". Anyways, if I was to sit down and
port all my old favorite games for the amiga, I'd be working nonstop for
the next 10 years trying to get them done. Instead, with Apple 2000, I
suddenly have some 10,000 programs available, including all my favorites
that I missed for so long. What could be better?

Apple 2000 has another version coming, right? What are we going to see? HOW
are we going to see it (still freely redistributable?) WHEN will we see it?


Yes! Version 1.2 is currently under construction. Some of the new features
completed so far are: selectable speed regulation (Yeah!), support for a
true analog joystick and Atari Paddles, overhaul of the video-subsystem so
AGA / Mode-Promotion / Screen-Grabbers work fine, lowercase text display,
optional two-disk drive emulation, notifications of changed disk data,
replacement of TitleBar with "Status Msg" at the bottom of the screen, a
couple bug fixes, optimized disk image-decompression/loading (under 2
seconds), and of course its faster (but don't expect much more).

It will be distributed (as usual) as Freeware. I expect it will be released
around mid-August. Unless, of course, one of several interested companies
buys this emulation technology from me (hahaha, inside joke :).

Are any more emulators forthcoming?  You've mentioned doing a 64 emulator "the
right way" before.



I don't expect you'll be seeing me release much more for the amiga- I begin
full time work as a game programmer in a couple weeks. Understand that
Apple 2000 was developed in my spare time while I was a student, and now I
will be working on computers all day at work. I don't think I'm going to
come home from working on computers all day to work on my computer all
night. No thanks- Theres lots of other things I plan on doing with that
time.

Doing a C64 emulator "the right way" was -heavily- requested! However, I
ultimately decided against pursuing it. Several reasons: Use of unimplented
6502 instructions (and inconsistent descriptions of them), undocumented
hardware operations, the common use of Raster Line interrupts to change the
display (a mess to handle), my lack of carnal knowledge of the C64, and the
fact that a couple "useable" C64 emulators already exist. In the end I
decided I was not willing to make the huge time investment that would be
required to do it right. And if I can't do it right, I won't do it at all.

What was actually next on the drawing board was the Atari 1200/VCS console
emulation. The big reasons I wanted to do this were because the 6502
emulation engine is already done, most of us "grew up" with the Atari, and
there are no Atari VCS emulators in existance (that I know of). I've
collected lots of notes and manuals on the Atari, as well as sample
cartridges and dissassembled example code. I've even outlined most of the
emulation.

However, soon after releasing Apple 2000, I was being contacted by several
companies and job opportunities were opening up. I knew I had very little
time before I would be working, so my efforts are focused on completely
finishing up Apple 2000 (which is what I'm doing now). However, I still
want to see Apple 2000 maintained and improved in the future. If I am
unable to do it, I'll make sure somebody else can. I'm planning on "passing
the torch" and giving my source code to a few competant programmers who can
continue to do good with it, and perhaps utilize the 6502 engine in other
emulators.

You've been talking for a long time about leaving the Amiga.  Why?  What are
you going to do next?  Is Apple 2000 the last thing you'll do on the Amiga?


I never talked about "leaving the amiga", but more about the "amiga leaving
us". I could see the Commodore was going nowhere with the Amiga, and as
we all know the worst has happened. The future of the amiga is still
uncertain, but looking dimmer everyday. I personally don't expect the amiga
line will be revived- because no large company will spend millions to bail
out an old machine when new generation machines are coming on the market
(its senseless). Any interested company could spend a fourth of that amount
to develop a brand new machine anyways (AAA is probably the only thing
anybody is interested in). But in the off chance that the next generation
amiga's ever see the light of day, I'll keep my eye on it. If not, though,
one has to know when it's time to move on and move forward. I still know
people who swear by and use their Apple's and Atari's exclusively. And they
complain how there is no support, no software, etc. Even if you don't move
forward, technology still does.

I'm keeping my eye on the PowerPC machines that should be rolling out soon.
No- Not the Apple version. I want a computer, not just a Macintosh! I think
the perfect system would be a PowerPC with the AAA chipset. Then I'd have
the stability of a mainstream machine, plus all the great things that made
the amiga so wonderful. Of course, who knows if the PowerPC will succeed om
the marketplace anyways.

But yeah, I expect Apple 2000 will be the first and last serious thing I do
on the amiga. At least I've been able to leave my mark and contribute
something. But I got to move on from writing free emulators to earning a
living. It was bound to happen sooner or later... ;-)

What was the motivation that kept Apple 2000 alive, amidst all of the hard
work and controversy?


Witnessing and realizing the progress of my work was very rewarding.
It's "my baby" that I've nurtured along for sooo long, pouring many late
night sessions into. As I continually refined my emulator and it's
routines, and added more and more features, I watched this program rise
from the murky pool of useless emulators, to become one of the best Apple
II emulators available on any platform. It went from something I just
showed to my friends to something that I felt would be beneficial to the
entire amiga community. The overwhelming public response has continued to
motivate me to maintain it.

What's this about landing a "dream job"?


Well, after releasing Apple2000, I got contacted regarding several job
opportunities. The one that interested me most though was for a large game
software house. I was contacted by one of their Senior Programmers, who,
like myself, wrote a 6502 emulator and was a FireFighter too. Impressed by
what he saw, he extended an invitation and got the ball rolling within the
company to hire me. When I was flown out, I was very impressed by what I
saw- The work, the environment, the other people who work there. It really
is my "dream job". I accepted the position they offered me and I begin work
mid-august. Good things do happen to good people. :-)

Who is your programming role-model?


Jeff Minter, the man behind LlamaTron! It's one of the best games that
exist (and its shareware!). It has everything that an arcade game should:
Noise, Color, movement, speed, playability, challenge, etc. And it's great
to see such talent move up in the world (with his recent version of
"Tempest 2000" for the Atari Jaguar). Actually, everything that Minter has
written has been extremely good, and I intend to follow in his footsteps.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

By now, you're probably wondering what I was getting at last
week about speeding up the A64's emulation.  It's really the feature
that makes the A64 stand apart and scores big points for it.

Save Map
--------

This is how it all begins: the Save Map feature, which allows you to
do just that: dump off the emulation's memory map for the program
being run.  This essentially is a "freeze" file, just like cartridges like
the Action Replay and Final Cartridge III sported for the 64, except
that the map files can only be loaded by A64 in the "load map"
menu.  However, there is something else you can do with a map:
convert it!

Converting
----------

The problem with most emulators is that the program has to spend a
certain amount of time converting code from one processor to another,
before it can even think about doing anything with the instruction being
emulated.  This slows things down.  So, what happens when you convert
the code to the code of the machine you're emulating on?

You speed it up.  A lot.  That's what Convert does.  A lot.

It starts with the map file.  You use the Convert program to analyze it.
Convert will break down the file into 16 blocks of 4k apiece and look at
it to decide if it's made of enough code to make converting it worthwhile.
It tags them and then the fun begins.

First, you can remove any loops the program can find that are just
there to waste time.  Sometimes this speeds up programs, sometimes
it does nothing noticable, and other times it can cause problems.
But you're prompted at each one.

Then Convert works its magic and generates a code file.  This file will
be several times larger than the 64 program, but hey, this is fun, right?

Now load the code file with the "Load Code" option.  Usually, one of 
two things will be apparent.

1.  The program will be much, much faster.

2.  The program just won't work.

I've seen both happen with a bunch of different programs.  It's a per-case
situation.

One program in particular that this works on is GEOS...good thing, too, 
because of the 68000 requirement to use it (GEOS).  It's not a simple
process, but is well-documented.

Other Goodies
-------------

A64 comes with a monitor that can be entered at any time (even during
emulation, although it of course freezes the program being run).  It's
not the best monitor in the world, but it's not bad.

Graphics displays are a very configurable area.  If a program is not
showing up correctly, A64 can attempt to show it to you in various
ways, updating the screen directly or at intervals, with adjustable 
delays and methods of interpreting raster interrupts.  This means that,
with patience, a lot of programs can look picture-perfect.  You'd still
better keep a real 64 around for demos, though.

A64 can emulate a RAM Expansion unit.  This isn't highly useful for
most programs, but GEOS eats it up and runs much faster because 
of it.  Hopefully, the REU usage would counteract the 68000 slowness
on a 68000-GEOS machine...

A64 has been criticized for not supporting .t64 and .d64 image formats.
When I mentioned this to Cliff Dugan, he said he wasn't familiar with
the formats.

Sound!
------

Hey, I almost forgot!  The emulation of the SID chip on A64 is amazing!
It's not perfect, but it's often very close (and is yet another highly
configurable option).  Compared to V2.0, where sound was iffy at best,
this is a welcome change.  I'd play SID tunes proudly on it.

More A64?
---------

Dugan told me that A64 would probably see one more commercial
version.  My hope is that it will be the one that supports demo-quality
graphics.  Everything else will probably fall into place from there.

Analysis
--------

If you liked A64 V2.0, you'll LOVE V3.0.  If you didn't like 2.0, you'll still
like 3.0.

The program is a very good C-64 emulator.  However, it's not nearly a
100% solution to running 64 software.

If the access to 64 software is worth your time and money, so is this
program.

That should do it.  Actually, it's very possible I'll remember to talk about
something in future issues, or finally run GEOS and comment on the
results.

Until then, of course, keep the emulators warm.  Even if someone thinks
that means you have a personal problem.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Second Half of a Second Samurai                     By: Katie Nelson     %%
%% From Psygnosis				       knelson@bbs.xnet.com %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
 
 I know I said that the second half of the Second Samurai review would be out 
 much sooner, but unfortunately, preparing for the next school year and such
 has interfered.  Well, here it is, with no more excuses.
 
 Well, in the first half of the review, I commented on the okay sound to the 
 less-than-okay graphics.  I forgot to mention that there is an AGA version
 available, which I have not yet seen, so the graphics may very well be
 improved in that version.
 
 This second half of the review centers on the style of play of Second Samurai.
 Perhaps the greatest feature is the ability to switch between an array of
 weapon types -- the traditional samurai sword, bombs of various sorts, and
 daggers.  Each has its own range, and therefore each is appropriate at
 different times.  This lends at least a small element of strategy, which seems
 to be lacking in many (most) platformers.  Unfortunately, the method to switch
 weapons involves the keyboard, and therefore may be distracting to those who
 have enough problems coordinating a joystick.  I've found that the best
 solution is to sit back on the couch and control the keyboard by foot.  :)
 
 I have noticed (through many many many deaths...) that this game is intended
 for those with better reflexes and greater landing precision than I.  (Though
 I managed to muddle through it eventually... thank God for passwords!) 
 Perhaps my greatest pet peeve would be the narrow collapsible floors, where if
 you stand on them for too long, you plummet to your death with no chance for
 redemption.  It seems like even the SLIGHTEST pause causes you to fall to your
 doom, but it could be that I was just getting too tense.  For those who like
 that nerve-wracking sort of thing or who are more talented than I am, it
 shouldn't be a problem, and will add to the enjoyment.
 
 The "bosses" (because every platform must have them) in this game could use a 
 bit of improvement for a hypothetical Third Samurai.  Their movements are very
 very very repetitive.  Not only repetitive for each boss, but (almost) all of
 them seem to share the same general movements:  "Bounce either the entire body
 or just the arms back and forth across the screen."  After a while, it gets
 easy for even me to dodge being crushed.
 
 About the last boss... He's rather demented.  Although he looks (and at first
 acts) surprisingly a lot like a large plant that you'll see earlier in the
 game, he is far far far more disgusting.  This part of the game isn't
 something you'd want to show a psychiatrist.  First off, in a Monty
 Python-esque vein, you end up removing the arms of the great beast, leaving
 squirts of blood emenating from his stumps for a short time.  This is followed
 by fighting off the raw maggots he ate for lunch, and punching out some
 eyeballs.  Not to say I didn't find it amusing, though.
 
 So who would like it?  Fans of Shinobi.  Those that must have every platform. 
 And those who don't care too much about graphics (at least in the ECS
 version), who just want good gameplay.
 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
 TIPS:
 
 Some of the most troublesome enemies shoot white and blue balls of lightning
 at you.  Your own weapons don't seem to help, so you have to fight ... well
 ... lightning with lightning.
 
 The brown flying blowfish-looking things are filled with water, and seem to
 only be around where there's a fire in your way.
 
 Watch for the propeller-looking contraptions.  Mechanical flight is better
 than none at all.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


The SX-1 is, as established last week, an expansion box with a lot
of options.  One of these is the promise of turning the CD32 back into
what it came from: an Amiga 1200.  Let's see just how close it comes.

Getting Started
---------------

Well, let's see...that shimmering CD on the screen IS a welcome change
from the old 2.x disk animation, and quite a departure from the 1.x
Kickstart hand.  Now, on the CD32, this screen implies that you're supposed
to put a CD in.  With the SX-1, we know better...we know we've got a
real live Amiga to work with now.  Ok, so now it's time to load Workbench.

Whoops.  There's a slight problem here.  Neither Commodore nor
Paravision include any sort of Workbench with the CD32 or SX-1,
respectively.  You could always use your disks from another machine,
but if my licensing knowledge is up to par, you'd techincally be breaking
the law.

You could go out and buy the disks separately, but there's a much
better alternative.  Two, in fact.

Lock 'n Load from NorthWest Public Domain and (so I'm told) CDPD III
from Almathera both have bootable Workbench 3.0 on the disc.  While
it's not the fastest route in the world, it works and boots the machine...
and from there, you can always copy the files to your SX-1's hard
drive, if applicable.

All right.  Problem one down.  Next!

Getting Around
--------------

Well, life isn't perfect...nobody bothered bundling a mouse with any 
of this, either.  Get one.  (Lock 'n Load has a program to allow minimal
mouse emulation with a joystick or joypad, but for serious use you NEED
a mouse, as the program doesn't support the right mouse button.)

You've got an Amiga 1200 at your fingertips now, with a couple of
differences.

1.  You can't plug in anything PCMCIA or 1200-local-slot.  Most people
would say that the missing PCMCIA is no big loss, but developers are
on the verge of coming out with 16-bit sound and Ethernet PCMCIA
cards.  There's also always the fabled Emplant PCMCIA, but it hasn't
materialized.  As for the local slot: well, you've got the single SIMM slot
offered by those trapdoor expanders, but you don't have FPU or CPU
upgrade capability.  Major downside, but Paravision told me they couldn't
get an 030 to work.

2.  You have a built-in CD-ROM filesystem, but unfortunately your
CD32 will reset if you lift the lid...unless you pick up a little gem called
NoReset from the Weird Science CD-ROM (also available on the next
Amiga Report Coverdisk).  This will enable you to slap in whatever
CD-ROM you'd like and access it from Workbench without screwing
around with buying a filesystem or getting the PD/shareware offerings
to work correctly.

3.  You can theoretically display your work on 4 different screens
without any sort of splitters (providing you have  RGB, composite,
RF and S-Video monitors all lying conveniently near the CD32)

4.  You have a detached keyboard.  (not to mention a detached
floppy drive, if applicable).

Ok, so it's not the most outstandingly elegant design in the world.
But it works, and everything will think you've got a 1200 under
the hood.

RAM Effects
-----------

The Fast RAM option is a great one.  It speeds up the CD32 by
the same amount a 1200 is accelerated (approx. 2.2 times a stock
1200), as you would expect.  This is great for Workbench operation.

However, despite the fact that this is 1994, some games for the CD32
will NOT work with Fast RAM.

Among these are Pirates Gold and Chaos Engine.

Some games will show a significant speed-up.  Microcosm, Liberation,
and Gunship 2000 fall here.

Others are virtually, if not totally, unaffected.  Pinball Fantasies and
Total Carnage are a couple.

There ARE ways around the Fast RAM...you can re-familiarize yourself
with Degrader and use it.  The only other alternative is to alter the memory
jumper inside the CD32 (#3).  Mike Pinson tells me that as long as you
don't SOLDER it on, a switch is fine to install without voiding the warranty.

(I've just been changing the jumper as I need to).

Hard Drive and Power
--------------------

Actually, consider this a review within a review.  Micro R+D, until they
get their specially-made CD32 power supplies, are altering 200 watt
internal supplies to work with the CD32.

200 watts is MORE than enough to handle ANYTHING you could
throw at the CD32.  At the same time, the power supply has some
brightly colored power connectors hanging off of it: two floppy, two
of the hard drive variety.

This is almost enough to make me say that this power supply is
a more viable solution than the upcoming special 50W one, which
presumably will not have these connectors.

Considering how expensive 2.5 inch drives are (Paravision is asking
$120 for the 40 meg drive they sent me on 30-day terms),
and considering how expensive external hard drive cases are (close
to $100 in most cases), a power supply with a hard drive connector
like this would mean that someone using an external IDE or a SCSI+
needs only to have some sort of box to mount their hard drive in,
and nothing more.  Sounds like a project that can be completed
in 2 hours with standard household items (provided you securely
mount the drive, of course) to me.  I've mentioned this to the 
Micro R+D staff, as the 50W supply will likely not have any drive
connectors at all.

The drive more than sufficiently powers a 2.5 inch HD, which works
fine with the CD32.  It's worth noting that it's a big project to get the
drive installed in the SX-1's case, as a LOT of screws need to be
removed and the SX-1 board needs to come out of the housing.
Such is life.

Final comments
--------------

The SX-1 delivers what it said it would deliver back in April.  I
remember my initial excitement when I read the flyer that
came with the CD32.  It's really, for all practical purposes and
barring a missing couple of slots, a 1200 with a CD-ROM.
This opens a vast world and now I can finally view pictures in
AGA (the Retina Z-III still would have been nice to keep, though.)

Of course, the SX-1 is delivering what it said it would deliver
months later and at increased cost, but there's not much that
can be done.

I strongly recommend this product as a viable, usable, and
practical upgrade for the CD32.  With my other hand, though,
I charge developers to challenge the SX-1 with a lower-cost, 
FPU/CPU upgradable product.

And I will sit back and enjoy the benefits to the customer.

I told you I'd get back to reviewing this game, it just took an extra week.

Now: On to playing it!

If you get past IUC's control system, you'll want to walk around and 
interact with the various people and objects around you.  The task of the
game is clear: pay off the tax bill you owe, or die.

So you need to raise some money.  Almost immediately, if you talk to the
right people, opportunities spring up and you find yourself smack in the 
middle of some puzzles to solve.  The puzzles themselves are, in general,
straightforward enough and often just require enough patience to try using
EVERY object on the one you're trying to manipulate.  It also helps to
pay attention to what other characters tell you to do, and to the fact
that Jack is an excellent thief.

The action is interspersed from time to time with cut scenes or snide
comments from Jack (upon passing a house of ill repute, he ALWAYS
says something), which can break up the incessant running around.

My personal favorite pastime is bothering the prostitute outside of the
first bar in the game...the dialogue is hilarious.

While all of this is going on, you'll be playing the game and noticing
something...the music gets really old really quick, and in-game sound
effects aren't exactly prolific.  The graphics, for being an ECS game,
aren't bad, but some rooms require you to pick up an object 4 square
pixels in size that is only on the screen about 1/3 of the time.  Not exactly
easy by any stretch.

I haven't finished IUC yet, but I'm going to try.  It's definitely worth playing,
as the plot is refreshing and so is the character interaction.  The game
rewards persistence by opening up borders more and more, which is
a feature that should bring even frustrated adventurers (like myself)
crawling back, wondering if the answer is in a room they missed somehow...

For a good storyline and plot, Innocent Until Caught is a must-have.
If you have a difficult time dealing with poor interfaces, though, you'll
go out of your mind within an hour of playing.

AUTHOR

	Email: dances@qedbbs.com

DESCRIPTION

	Workbench 2.x AppIcon to "drag-and-drop" delete files.
	Deletes any files and/or directories (and the files in them)
	who's icon(s) are dropped into the Trashmaster AppIcon.  Files
	can be deleted interactively, with confirmation on each file
	(delete, all, abort, and skip).  Disks will be formatted.

	Unlike other similar programs (the ones I have seen, anyway),
	Trashmaster keeps Workbench "in sync".  "Fake" icons generated
	dynamically by Workbench (via the "Show >> All Files" menu
	option) will be removed from the display.  Any open directory
	windows are closed when that directory is deleted.

NEW FEATURES

	Localized strings.  Swedish, Polish, German, Dutch and
	Norwegian and Italian catalogs.  Documentation in English;
	other languages forthcoming (probably in a separate archive).

	In certain instances, icon flickering has been eliminated or
	reduced.

	Options can be specified from the command line in addition to
	the Tooltypes.

	It's a commodity now (no big deal though).  Under 3.0 you can
	pop up the Workbench info requester to change the Tooltypes.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	Requires 2.04 and above of Workbench.  V2.1 required for

    The Duniho and Duniho Life Pattern Indicator

VERSION

    3.40

AUTHOR

    Fergus Duniho

    E-mail: fdnh@troi.cc.rochester.edu

DESCRIPTION

    The DDLI is a personality indicator measures for four different
    sets of preferences that result in a total of sixteen different
    psychological types.  These four sets of preferences are

        How we orient our lives:

            Extraversion vs. Introversion

        How we prefer to gather information:

            Sensing vs. iNtuition

        How we prefer to make decisions:

            Thinking vs. Feeling

        Which sort of lifestyle we prefer:

            Judging vs. Perceiving

    These 16 types correspond to the psychological types that Carl
    Jung described in _Psychological Types_.  They also corresond to
    the 16 Myers-Briggs types measured by the Myers-Briggs Type
    Indicator.

    The DDLI asks you a series of multiple choice questions and
    calculates its results from your answers.  It asks you to rank
    each of your answers on a scale from 1 to 7. It also asks you
    questions on other sets of preferences that are supposed to match
    various combinations of the above four sets. This is so it
    provides a check on itself, as it can be fallible.

    The DDLI comes with extensive support material.  Included are full
    length descriptions of each one of the 16 types, the "Personality
    Type Summary" by Jon Noring, and my own description of the Life
    Pattern personality model.

NEW FEATURES

    Using the data I have collected from people, I have changed (and
    hopefully improved) the questions.  I think the DDLI will be
    somewhat more reliable now.

    When you quit the DDLI with option 6, it will give you the
    opportunity to save your answers before you quit.

    Added to the text that the DDLI displays.

    The DDLI now writes extra text to the raw scores file, and it can
    read raw scores files with extra text at the beginning.

    The DDLI now has you indicate your type by selecting a number
    instead of by writing it in.

    The raw scores file takes up fewer lines, so that it is easier to
    send across the Fidonet.

    FGP2

VERSION

    2.02a

AUTHOR

    Simon Austin (austins@sol2.uel.ac.uk)

DESCRIPTION

    At the start of this Formula One season Autosport magazine started
    running a Fantasy Grand Prix competition. FGP2 is a program which
    allows you to avoid at the tedious working out how many places your
    driver gained on his grid position and just how many points did
    Rubens Barrichello score by coming third. FGP2 has a simple command
    line and takes most of its input in the form of human-readable
    ascii files which can be created on any text editor. FGP2 comes
    with all the current driver/team data files required and can handle
    up to 50 different teams. Example files are also included for the
    files you have to create yourself.

UPDATE

    As of the German Grand Prix, Autosport introduced Fantasy Grand Prix 
    II. This involved a small change to the scoring for chassis and
    engines. Release 2.02a of FGP uses these updated rules and the new
    drivers/teams as detailed in Autosport.

DESCRIPTION

           The "other" way to catalogize your picture-libraries by
      creating new images containing smaller representations
      (thumbnails) of a number of source images e.g.  for use in BBS's
      or for raytracer's texture-libs.An ARexx script without fancy
      GUI,but with features that will allow you to fit all your
      needs.Very flexible and configurable if you really want it to.If
      not,then CatMake will suit you as well as it has meaningful
      default settings.  For the advanced user CatMake allows you to
      write and incoporate personal ARexx-Scripts and to control
      almost anything of what it can do.
      
           Prefs are stored in an editable ASCII-File with lots of
      settings that can only be edited there (as you wont really want
      to set them up every time you use CatMake...Give it a try ;-)

NEW FEATURES

      Many new features compared to V1.0 !
      So many that it isnt possible to mention them here without writing
      a new docfile.
      Highlights include :
      - "Hooks" to implement external ARexx-Code at various execution points
      - optional headerstrings to entitle your catalogs
      - optional "ProccedOnError" will replace corrupt images with a special
        text-thumbnail showing a string (e.g. "Corrupted!") and leaving the
        filename to check the error after catalogizing
      - size and picturedepth may now be rendered under the filename
        (useful for catalogs with small thumbnails / long filenames)
      - custom order in addition to alphabetical sorting
      - Possibilty to call CatMake with argument line and thus running
        CatMake without ANY requester (except error-requesters) which allows
        you to fully automate catalogizing e.g. the bulletins of your
        Picture-BBS after any upload or so...
      - Wildcarding for in/excluding groups of files...Like *.info files from
        CD-ROMs...
      - (semi/full) Automatical recognition of LhAed and PowerPacked files
        with autodecrunching (LhA = first file)

@node P5-6 "MultiVol Mirror V1.0"
@toc "menu"

TITLE

     MultiVol Mirror

VERSION

     1.0

DESCRIPTION

     MultiVol(TM) Mirror makes a copy of or "mirrors" a file to one
     or more volumes as the file is being written the master
     volume. Any "file" that can be opened for writing can be
     mirrored, including the console/shell (input is also
     mirrored). Normally, you would map one master volume (e.g., a
     disk) to one mirror volume (or directory on the same volume).
     The full path to a real file is constructed on the mirrored
     volume(s), as well as file comments and protection.

     All you need to do is set up the mapping of master volume to
     mirror volume -- you can use MVM's drag and drop graphical
     user interface to do this -- and use MVM: before the name of
     the file to mirror (or in a file requester).  It's that easy.

     Using MultiVol Mirror (MVM), you can:

     * partially recover from accidentally overwriting a file
       (getting back an earlier version)

     * completely recover from deleting a master file and disk
       failures, to the extent MVM was used

     * automatically backup any file every time the file is written

     * transparently record shell or console input and output

     * safely use RAM as a fast disk

       With RAM specified as the master volume and your hard drive
       or diskette as the mirrored volume, you can edit a file in
       RAM, benefitting from fast loads of the file.  When you save
       it, it is placed both in RAM and on the hard drive/diskette
       automatically.

     * view the contents of any file as it is being written

     * map more than one master volume to more than one mirror
       volume

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     * AmigaDOS/Kickstart(TM) 2.04 or higher

PRICE

     MultiVol Mirror 1.0 and online hypertext documentation: $45.

DESCRIPTION

    Physics Laboratory in Mechanics is a multimedia program which
    uses an experimental approach to teach high school level
    mechanics. Seven topic areas cover the concepts of Kinematics,
    Newtonian Dynamics, Statics, Universal Gravitation, Work & Energy,
    Impulse & Momentum, and Rotational Motion.  Each topic area has
    beginner, intermediate, and advanced level experiments for a total
    of 21 different experiments.  A laboratory notebook describes each
    experiment and allows the user to simulate the experiment with
    the computer.  The experiment can also be performed by using
    everyday objects found around the home.

    Physics Laboratory in Mechanics allows multiple users to retain
    data in computerized notebooks.  It also includes history segments
    explaining how the physical concepts were discovered, a math
    reference section, a units reference section, and a program to allow
    you to convert units to the MKS system of measurement.  A hall of
    fame with pictures of notable scientists will include an entry for
    the user upon completion of the entire set of experiments.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    Requires AmigaDOS 2.0 or greater, 2 MB of RAM, and a hard disk drive
    with approximately 4 MB of free space.

DESCRIPTION

          Meeting Pearls Vol I is a new CD for the Amiga, which is
     available at a price of 19.80 DM (about $13 US).

     Below follows a small list of some of the CD's contents:
     
          - About 150 Fractals with about 256 colors each in very high
            resolution
          - Many Pictures of our German Amiga Meeting, with some texts
            about each picture, describing which persons you can see.
          - NetBSD for the Amiga, in archived form, but with a lots of
            very useful installation descriptions.
          - PasTeX, completely installed, additionally with fonts for
            Fax and 600 dpi printers.
          - Amok disks 98 to 106
          - Many, many installed programs, ready to click and run!
          - More than 40 MB of files from various CDs
          - DaggeX - ready to run
          - About 6 MB HTML pages
          - Many games, animations, sounds, ...
          
          The CD has an installation script which allows you to
     choose your favourite ASCII reader and your favorite universal
     picture viewer.  People with graphics boards can of course
     enter the viewer for their graphics card and view the pictures
     in high resolution in the many colors available to them.
     
          Some CDROM filesystems (at least the Commodore
     CDFileSystem) have problems if you choose a reader or viewer
     program which is contained on the CD.  In such a case, you can
     choose any reader or viewer program from your harddisk and
     everything should work fine.
     
          The installation script also allows you to copy some
     directories from CD to your harddisk.  Since the plain ISO
     filesystem cannot save Amiga protection flags or Amiga comments
     you can copy any directory with our installer script from CD to
     your harddisk.  The included script will recover those flags
     and comments after it successfully copied the specified
     directory tree.  Of course, this will slow down the copy
     process, but having original Amiga protection flags on your
     harddisk should be worth it.  i.e.  All those pure flags and
     script flags can be recovered.  This is probably the first
     Amiga CD with such a mechanism.
          

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

          Meeting Pearls Vol.  I runs on any Amiga with a working
     CDROM drive, but if you still have Kickstart 1.2 or Kickstart
     1.3, you will have some problems and a lot of programs
     contained on the CD won't run on your system.  We did our best
     trying to maintain compatibility but we do recommend at least
     OS 2.04 or greater.  We also recommend additional ram if you
     wish to view all those nice pictures on the CD.  But many other
     things will still work with 512 KB or so.  A graphics board
     also is very useful, but not required.


PRICE

     Suggested retrail price: 19.80 DM (about US $ 13)

     Shipping outside Germany costs from 15 to 30 DM at GTI and

DISTRIBUTABILITY

          You may make as many copies for private use and may also
     give them to your friends.  But you must not reproduce the CD
     and then sell it without the written licence of the author.

OTHER

          The CDs low price was made possible by the creaters of
     this CD (me and some other people who are crazy enough to spend
     a lot of time and effort to make a cheap Amiga CD) who worked
     for free and did not request any money for the creation of this
     CD.  If you buy such a CD, you only pay the people who mastered
     the CD as well as the dealers.  You neither pay the authors of
     the programs nor the creators of this CD.
     
          Thus we, the creators of this CD, ask for a small donation
     from everybody who likes the compilation of the CD.  Nobody is
     forced to give any extra money.  Meeting Pearls Vol.  I is the
     first CD under the new concept of the sharecompilation.  If you
     want to get more information about this concept, you may get an
     information text from walhalla.ira.uka.de (129.13.59.52), file
     /sharecompilation/info.txt, which tells you more about the
     sharecompilation concept.

                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

  Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

  The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software, online.

  Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

  Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES.

  35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

  No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

  Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

  Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

  Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

  FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
  Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  

  Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

  The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
  Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
  All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

  Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

  And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

Portal Signup or for more information:

   408-973-9111 (voice) 9a.m.-5p.m. Mon-Fri, Pacific Time
   408-725-0561 (modem 3/12/2400) 24 hours every day
   408-973-8091 (modem 9600/14400) 24 hours every day

   or enter "C PORTAL" from any Sprintnet dial-in in the USA,
   or telnet to "portal.com" from anywhere.


  Direct rates also apply to connections made to Portal using the
  UNIX "telnet" program from an account you may already
  have on an Internet-connected system. 
% 9600 bps Sprintnet in over 300 cities areas
+ $10 rate prevails at smaller US Cities
# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

That number again:  408-973-9111.

Portal Communications accepts MasterCard, Visa, or you can pre-pay any

Our host machine is a 386/33 with 20MB of memory, 1GB harddisk and
a CD-ROM drive running in a Novell network. The BBS software is a
Norwegian origin MBBS running in a DesqView windows.

We have now (26th March 1994) over 10000 files online (mostly for
the Commodore Amiga line of the personal computers.)

Every user has an access to download filelist (LAHOFIL.ZIP), list of the
Finnish 24-hour BBS's (BBSLIST.ZIP or BBSLIST.LHA) and every issue of
the Amiga Report Magazine (AR101.LHA-AR???.LHA) even on their first call.

The system has been running since 1989 and is sponsored by the local
telephone company, Vaasan Lnin Puhelin Oy.

BTW, LAHO stands for "LAtomeren Hyrylaiva Oy" = "Barnsea Steamship Co."

Welcome on board!
