I'm off to vacate!!!! So next week I am going on Vacation! Jason
Compton will be compiling AR221 so that there is no interuption in 
your friendly AR service :)

Not much in the news this week. Harv Laser of Portal's Amiga Zone reports
that Tim Walsh of Amiga World is rushing off to the Bahamas to get the
latest scoop on the liquidation of C=. It looks like there is no
settlement on who is going to purchase C='s technology. Several companies
have laid in their bids and the Bahaman court has told C= to accept the
highest bidder.

It looks like we have quite a bit more waiting to do before any *news*
comes out of the Commodore world, but something is going to happen!!

In other news, there's not much of it this week. Either it is going right
past me, or everyone is waiting for the "final word"

Hopefully next week we can bring you more.

Just in case you're wondering, Samsung is still in the picture, as are
others.... *sigh*

Well I'm off to get my feet in the sand...the last few months have been
real hectic...when problems amount, they always seem to come in leaps and
bounds, so this is a much awaited break to just get away for a bit.

Hope to see you all July 1st!!!!

AR Mailing List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No Official Amiga Report Distribution Site in your local calling area? Are
you tired of waiting for your local BBS or online service to get Amiga
Report each week?  If so, have we got a deal for you!

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report
in UUENCODED form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put
on the list, send Email to rniles@hebron.connected.com.  Your
account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact copy.
For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.

Many thanks to PORTAL Communications for setting this service up for us!

P.S.:  Please be sure to include your Email address in the text of your
request message, it makes adding it to the list much easier.  Thanks!

** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!

                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
World Wide Web
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AR can also be read with Mosaic (in either AmigaGuide or html form).
Reading AmigaReport with Mosaic removes the necessity to download it.
It can also be read using programs found in UNIX sites such as LYNX.

Simply tell Mosaic to open the following URL:
http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/People/mjw/Computer/Amiga/AR/MainPage.html

Mosaic for the Amiga can be found on Aminet in directory comm/net, or
(using anonymous ftp) on max.physics.sunysb.edu

Mosaic for X, Macintosh(tm) and Microsoft Windows(tm) can be found on
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu


                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Aminet
~~~~~~
To get Amiga Report from Aminet, simply FTP to any Aminet site, CD
to docs/mags. All the back issues are located there as well.
(ftp.cdrom.com or ftp.wustl.edu are two sites)

Big news for all jealous ECS users and all 4000 users who want more OS
power!

3.1 is now available to (almost) ANY Amiga user!

Almost?  Well, it's not available for 1200 users.  The reason why
remains uncertain.

I know of three distributors so far:

In the US, contact Expert Services at 606-371-9690.

In the UK, contact Blittersoft on 0908 220196.

In Germany, contact Village Tronic. I don't know their number.

The Expert Services prices work like this:

$100 for the 500/2000 version
$150 for the 3000/4000 version

My reaction was "Wow."  That's awfully expensive, considering my 2.1
upgrade was stickered at $75.

It IS the full package, manuals, ROMs, and disks.  Unfortunately, I can't
get a package from Expert Services (without spending the money which I 
can't do right now) so I can't tell you if it's actually worth it or not.

                   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
It's going to be something of a disappointing Consumer Electronics
Show for me...I decided to go primarily to see Commodore.

Well, that's just not going to happen anymore.

So then I figured I'd look for some Amiga developers.  That's not
really going to happen, either...there are a couple of companies that
will be there that do or have done games on the Amiga, but they'll very
likely be demoing things for other systems...

So, my only remaining hope to have a good time is to wander around
and try to find interesting things.  Oh, yeah, and not to let myself get
trapped into anti-Amiga humor.

The press releases I've been getting are great.  One touted the glory of
the "Gunvertor", a universal remote built into the grip of a pistol.  All
for $70.  Wow.  Another came from 3DO, but I was cooking on the grill that
day, and you know, things happen...

A few others have been interesting: Canon's Video Printer (the full info
packet will be coming to me, since I can't go to the demo), GTE's new
CD line (actually, it looked like the same old educational software story),
but I haven't signed on to any seminars yet.  I think I'm just afraid I'll 
miss something else while I'm at one.

So that means I'll be wandering around a lot on Thursday and Saturday.
Anybody else going to be there?  I'd like to meet a few readers...

I managed to get some more news from Paravision:  their 800 number
is 800-588-0043, and they're trying to sell off their inventory of 1200
expansion boards.  They won't do any more production runs unless
someone picks up the Amiga and runs with it.  As of my call Wednesday,
the SX-1 review copies were held up because they didn't have cases.
"Reviewers don't care," I told him, and he said he would send mine out
that night or Thursday.  (He being Robert Maynard, CEO/President)

I've also been talking with US Cybernetics about their new Warp System
transputer line.  Apparently, they'll set me up with a one-week review in
the near future.

That does it for this week.  Hopefully someone will start building Amigas
again soon...

                        GREAT STORIES OF AMIGA ABUSE

                          -- amazing recovery! --



A few weeks ago I asked for stories about amiga's that battled on despite
terrible abuse. My thanks to all the people that answered, even the ones
with the somewhat unlikely stories! I hope I got the right names over the
right stories, my apologies if I got it wrong. A short summary of abuse
that *didn't* lead to machine fatality:

LIQUIDS poured over computer:      *     OBJECTS dropped on computer:
                                   *
Black Cherry yoghurt               *     Computer owner
Beer (twice)                       *     HUGE speaker (twice)
Red wine                           *     Monitor
Rain (twice)                       *
Cat piss                           *
Milk                               *
Tea (twice)                        *     OTHER stuff done to computer:
Hot chocolate                      *
Shampoo                            *     Lightning strike (twice)
Mello Yello                        *     Dropped
Lighter fluid (burning)            *
Coke                               *

Right, now let's have the full stories. Over to you guys:

David Higginsons story is about a C64:

>Managed to get a glass of red wine through the innards of my 64. Never 
>even flinched :).



From Kimmo Veijalainen comes another C64 story:

>A friend of mine accidentally poured half a bottle of beer on the C64's
>keyboard while the machine was running. No problem, he tilted the machine
>and the beer came out from one corner. No reboot, no nothing, it worked
>OK and is still functional :-)

>(Sadly, the mouse died after only 4 months, but that's a minor 
>problem...)



A few stories that happened in my own neighbourhood:

>A friend of mine left his Amiga under an open window. While he was gone, 
>it started to rain... After returning, he switched on the computer, but it
>didn't work. He turned it off again, and lifted it off the shelf, causing
>all the water inside to flow out.
>
>Of course, a wet computer is a bad idea. My friend therefore put it on the

>
>Another friend used to take his a500 with him in his backpack. One day he
>fell, and landed on his back (on the amiga!). It, too, is still in
>excellent working order.



From David Pryce comes an unlikely story of abuse and recovery:

>Well, I was throwing my A500 around a field like a frizbee when it landed
>on a land mine.  It got blown up into the jet engine of a Boeing 747 and
>the fragmented pieces that came out the back just happened to land back

>faster than it ever did before.

Are you sure it happened this way, David?

>No, it didn't.  I'm lying again.  Quick, doc, get my pills...

Here you go...   ;-)



David Hoppers machine survived an earthquake (as did David, apparently!):

>The Quake of '89, I was in Palo Alto.  I had a 40 pound stereo speaker
>fall off the wall and directly onto my A500, a four-foot fall.  It was
>powered on, and just kept going.
>
>I've got a divot out of my Return key to show for it.



Phill Coxon had a problem with his cat:

>A friend of mine came over to check out my new kitten. He happily chased
>the kitten around the house for half an hour. What he didn't realise was

Joel Edward Swans *computer* is fine...

>dual standard Courier HST.  The top grating was bashed in and broken.
>I turned it on and it still runs fine.
>
>Unfortunately the monitor tumbled farther to the floor and broke the tube
>:-(.



Kimmo Veijalainen is back with an unlikely story:

>Once my A500 absorbed a lightning bolt :-) and the disk currently in df0:
>got an unrecoverable read/write error. Nothing else happened.

One would expect the machine to be a smoking mess... How did the lightning
bolt get close enough to your a500 anyway?



Another lightning strike comes from William Silvey:

>Well, Ok... lemme think... Right, my A500 took a lightning hit and all it
>did was kill the 3rd party modem connected... then one day last spring I
>saw that my A1200 was thirsty, so I gave it a drink of milk.  The 500 
>ticks on at a friend's house, the 1200 sits before me now, unscathed 
>[well, I did clean it out]



Clemens Zauner has another flood story:

>My friend and me we are developing a 24Bit Image proc. and while doing 
>this we're drinking lots of tea. I'm using an A500 & an A4000. Yes, one 
>evening I went to fill my cup with hot tea, the full can slipped off my 
>hands - nearly 1 liter of _very_ hot tea flooded my A500 (powered on, 
>as usual).

>It survived ! - need some drying, but it' still working _now_.



Pascal Eeftinck tells about a machine that DIDN'T survive:

>I and a couple of friends went to a copy-party somewhere here in Holland.
>At a certain time the police invaded in search of some titus-game. One guy
>grabbed his 500, ran away and tripped over a chair. One of these friends
>still has his escape-key ...
>
>(Oh, and I poored some coke over one of my previous Amiga's too, cleaned 
>it out, never had problems with it.)



Alex Amsel says:

%% The Retina ZIII 24-bit Video Board                 by Jason Compton %%
%%                                               jcompton@bbs.xnet.com %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Here begins a monumental review in that it is the first non-emulation
hardware I've ever reviewed, and it's the first 24-bit video board I've
ever reviewed.  That in mind, I'll jump right in, with the first thing any
Retina user will encounter...

The Packaging!
-----------------
At first, I thought NoahJi's had accidentally sent me another Toccata
(note: I have dropped the Toccata review because of time restraints).
They've got the EXACT SAME PACKAGE DESIGN, right down to
the fonts on the box and the lightray-design behind the pictures of the
boards at the exact same angle.  MacroSystem does not go all out
when it comes to putting a box together.  To their credit, there is a 
little English on the box.  Not much, though.

To its credit, it is effective enough packaging that does the job of 
getting the product to you.  Sliding the recyclable cardboard box out 
of the jacket with the design and opening it up, reveals the next two 
important pieces...

The Included Software!
------------------------
Two disks come with the Retina ZIII: one is the rather necessary Retina
software (in my case, V2.2), the other is the 24-bit paint program VDPaint.
The Retina software installs using the Commodore-supplied program and
is easy enough to work with.  The paint program is a bit less friendly to
install (not really any included hints) but still not a huge project.  The
paint
program has an 000 and 030 version, as though someone who is buying
a 24-bit video board that cost hundreds of dollars wouldn't be interested
in an accelerator.

At any rate, once the software is installed, you might want to know how to
use it, right?  You bet you would.

The Manual!
-----------
I could have used a lot of words to describe the manual, but I think the
best is: bad.  "Bad" gets right to the point.

It comes as a bound 42-page booklet, which is at least half as big as it
should be.  24-bit video, Workbench emulation and screen retargeting
are not simple topics, and the manual does not do a good job of it.

I called Eric Kloor of NoahJi's on it, and he summed up the problem:
The really nice English manual is copyrighted by MacroSystem US.
Apparently, this is not a cooperative situation and so here we are,
with a manual that seems to have come from the original MacroSystem
edition.

At any rate, the parts up through the installation are fine: it's tough to
screw
up putting a Zorro card in a slot, and there are no special requirements 
for heat or anything of the sort.  It's when you get to section 4, about 
first using the card and setting up the Workbench screen emulation that 
the problems hit.

Problems?
---------
Well, yeah.  Not too bad, actually, after some initial fine-tuning with 
the Workbench prefs.  See, the Retina software relies partially on good 
old Screenmode-for resolution height and width.  My primary problem comes
when I follow the instructions and make the Screenmode sizes match
the size I have selected for Workbench in the software (wait, I'll get to
the software next time).  The screen does not update anything near
correctly-it's not even the right size or colors.  Gadgets aren't where
they're supposed to be.  Needless to say, it's not good and I get mad
when it happens, but I have Screenmode set to 760x470, and Retina
thinks this is 800x480, and it looks great, so I won't complain.
Another problem, not entirely the Retina's fault, is the refusal of some
programs to take advantage of a higher-resolution screen than a
standard Amiga can comfortably handle.  With others, like Final
Copy II and Terminus, some trickery is required to get over programs'
preconceptions, like not being able to extend more than 25 lines on
screen in Terminus unless Console is set to Laced, even if it's a 
1024x768 screen.  FCII requires that you set the Workbench to the
resolution you like, then start with "Same as Workbench."  Not serious.

There are some other basic rules, too:

1.  Anything that takes over the Amiga you may as well forget about, 
since you need to run the RetinaEMU program to retarget video, and
PHYSICAL pass-through on the Retina is an extra-cost option as a 
part of an add-on board.  Of course, you're free to disconnect the video
from the Retina when you're going to use these programs.

2.  Screen blankers and some screen hacks (BusyPointer) don't work.
Same for mouse blankers, but Retina allows a high-res pointer so you
can at least make it small.

Retina's software DOES come with a screen blanker if you're that
reluctant to hit your monitor's power switch.  Personally, I think screen
blankers should have gone out of style when one-piece, one-power-switch
Macs went out of style, but some look nice, at least.

That'll do it for this week.  Next week I'll tell you how it actually 
PERFORMS in day-to-day use.  Until then, keep the JPEGs warm.

30fps Video Capture and Non-linear Digital Editing 
By Douglas J. Nakakihara 

	There are a lot of people who believe that capturing moving video 
on a desktop PC is a fairly easy thing to do.  Just install a video 
capturing board in your PC, connect the thing to your video source, and 
click the record button.  Just like a VCR, right?  Well, not quite. 

	The problem lies in data transfer rates.  Depending on file 
format, a single full-frame of video is at least one-half megabyte in 
size.  So one second of video is about 15MB of data.  A PC normally 
can't transfer that much data to a hard drive that quickly.  Saving the 
data to RAM is an alternative, but cost prohibitive for anything more 
than a few seconds.  To compensate, most boards capture less than a 
full-frame of video.  Until some sort of hardware compression like JPEG 
becomes affordable, for the average desktop videographer, capturing 
full-frame video at 30fps may seem to be just a dream. 

The VLab 

	Well Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore.  MacroSystemUS's VLab card 
for the Commodore Amiga can do 30fps full-frame video capture.  Perhaps 
even more astonishing is that fact that you can even use a cheap 
consumer grade VCR as your video source.  Have I piqued your interest 
yet? 

	VLab accomplishes this amazing feat using their innovative 
Interleaved Frame Recording (IFR) technique.  Basically the VLab 
captures frames as fast as your Amiga can do it.  By making multiple 
passes at the video source, VLab automatically captures more and more 
frames.  For example, on the first pass it might capture frames 1, 16, 
31,...  The second time around, it might pick up frames 2, 17, 32,...  
As you can see, ultimately, all 30 frames for each second can be 
captured!  In this example, it would take 15 passes to capture all of 
the frames.  Obviously, this will only work for video on tape or 
laserdisc.  (Be kinda hard to rewind live video!) 

	The secret to IFR is the selection of a Keyframe, which provides 
VLab with a point of reference on your video source.  Once the Keyframe 
has been identified, VLab only needs to know how many seconds after the 
Keyframe it should wait before capturing frames.  When VLab is capturing 
frames, it knows based on time which frames it needs to capture--
accuracy to a thirtieth of a second is child's play for a computer.  A 
Keyframe seems to occur whenever there is an abrupt change in the video 
signal, like when the camera cuts to a different location or to a close 
up of an actor. 

	The IFR process basically works like this.  First you put your VCR 
in play mode and click on VLab's Find Keyframe button.  VLab will let 
you know when a Keyframe is found, which must precede the start of your 
scene.  (If it isn't simply start a little farther back on the tape and 
try again.)  As soon as your scene comes up, click on the Start Scene 
button.  Now all you need to do is click the Start button, rewind the 
tape past the Keyframe, and play the tape again.  Each time VLab 
finishes a pass of capturing frames, you must rewind and play the tape 
again. 
	 
	The total number of captured frames is selectable by the user.  If 
you're capturing at 30fps, just multiply the length of your scene in 
seconds by 30.  To improve capturing speed and decrease storage 
requirements, you can reduce the capture resolution or capture in black-
and-white.  When doing IFR, make sure you disable your screen saver as 
it may throw VLab's timing off and cause the wrong frames to be 
captured. 

Look Ma, No Hands 

	There are also provisions for automating the rewinding process.  I 
highly recommend a terrific product called AirLink by Geodesic Designs.  
This is an inexpensive infrared (IR) universal remote control for the 
Amiga.  Example ARexx scripts to control AirLink are already included 
with the VLab software.  AirLink can automatically rewind your tape past 
the Keyframe and then put your VCR back into the play mode, at the end 
of each IFR pass!  Essentially, once you've set up the IFR parameters, 
you can click a button and walk away.  AirLink will also work with 
camcorders, laserdiscs, etc., as long as they can be controlled with an 
IR remote. 

Storage Requirements 

	You're going to need a large hard disk to store all of the frames 
you capture.  Although IFR initially saves frames in a compact YUV 
format, at 30fps, the storage requirements can really add up.  I am 
hoping that a provision to convert the captured images to a smaller file 
format after each IFR pass, thus reducing overall storage requirements, 
will be added in the future. 

	For the average user, 30fps may be overkill.  The storage 
requirements alone may discourage its use.  A more manageable frame rate 
is 15fps.  Obviously, motion will not be as smooth as it is at 30fps, 
but it's not annoying. 

Other Features 

	In addition to IFR, VLab will also capture a sequence of frames at 
up to 6fps.  This is sort of like making a single IFR pass at a video 
source.  However, the sequence-capture has a little more control over 
what is captured.  A nice feature is that you have the option of using a 
resolution of one-half, a third, or a quarter of the screen.  This can 
significantly reduce storage requirements.  Obviously, VLab won't even 
break a sweat capturing a single frame of video.  Individual frames can 
be saved in any Amiga format including 24-bit IFF and AGA. 

	VLab has loads of other features including extensive ARexx 
support.  You can also monitor the incoming video source in greyscale in 
a movable window.  Video played fairly smoothly in this window on my 
A3000.  You can't see much detail, so depending on your needs you might 
want to use a signal splitter and watch the video source on a separate 
monitor.  Real time color, contrast, luminance, and gamma controls as 
well as luminance, chromanance, and noise filters. 

	VLab fits into any Zorro II/III slot and does not require the 
video slot.  The VLab Y/C version includes two RCA video inputs plus a 
Y/C connector for Hi-8 and SVHS video sources.  Inputs are software 
selectable.  An external version is available for the A500, A600, and 
A1200. 

Now What Do I Do? 

	Applications for the VLab are only limited by your imagination.  
For example, most desktop video users are limited to morphing--the 
current "hot" video effect--one static image to another.  With VLab you 
can now generate the images needed for moving morphs (i.e., the source 
and target images are moving).  Examples of moving morphs can be seen in 
the movie Terminator 2 and Michael Jackson's Black or White music video.  
For the 3D rendering people, how about the ability to wrap moving video 
onto your objects!  Computer-aided presentations could include video 
segments without the need for VCRs or laserdiscs.  Vlab could provide 
source images for rotoscoping (painting on frames by hand).  A non-
linear digital editing system could also be designed around VLab.  
Bottom line: the ability to affordably capture video at 30fps is going 
to open whole new worlds to desktop video. 

The VLab-Retina Team 

	When the VLab is teamed with MacroSystemUS's Retina display card, 
VLab's features are enhanced.  The video source can be monitored on a 
Retina display in 16-bit color.  There is a noticeable delay in the 
display update, but it does give you a better idea of what will 
ultimately be captured.  Also, Retina comes with a program called 
Makerace that will compile the captured images with sound into an 
animation playable on the Retina.  With a VGA video encoder, it should 
be a fairly simple operation to get the Retina output to videotape.  On 
my Amiga 3000, I was able to play a 320 x 200 animation with sound using 
a 16-bit display at about 15fps.  For even faster playback, read on! 

A Match Made in Heaven 

	MovieMaker ($895 list) from Interactive Video Systems is a non-
linear digital video and audio editing system that comes with its own 
16-bit stereo sound card.  MovieMaker provides a way to arrange and play 
VLab-captured frames full-screen at 30fps, with 16-bit sound to boot!  
MovieMaker works very nicely in an Amiga 3000 and should work better in 
an Amiga 4000, if it has a Zorro III SCSI controller (currently a rare 
species).  MovieMaker operates best with certain hard drive models so 
IVS also offers it bundled with an approved hard drive. 

	Using VLab's IFR, I captured several seconds of video.  I also 
digitized the audio using AES, the audio software that comes with 
MovieMaker.  Then using ADPro, I converted the captured YUV images to 
DCTV format.  Incidentally, ASDG's product ProControl, a front-end for 
ADPro, made this a very easy task and saved me the trouble of writing my 
own ARexx script.  Next I imported the DCTV files into the MovieMaker 
hard disk partition.  (MovieMaker requires its own partition.)  It took 
a couple of tries to get the audio synced properly, but the resulting 
playback was incredible! 

	Using MovieMaker's wordprocessor-like editing functions, I was 
able to manipulate my captured video in nearly unlimited fashion.  Max 
Headroom stutter effects were easy as pie to do.  This VLab-MovieMaker-
DCTV setup seems like a natural for doing MTV-style music videos. 

	Although MovieMaker's output is not broadcast-quality, it is more 
than adequate for home and industrial use.  MovieMaker would also be 
valuable in a professional pre-production environment.  Quick rendered 
3-D animations could be edited and tested with an audio track before 
being rendered in broadcast-quality form.  Also, storyboarding would be 
a breeze with MovieMaker using either static or animated sequences. 

	MovieMaker needs about 100MB per minute of playback.  I would 
estimate that for serious work, you'll need at least a 1GB hard drive.  
Remember, the original source files have to also exist before they are 
transferred to the MovieMaker partition.  Fortunately, 1GB drives have 
becoming somewhat affordable lately.  Note that MovieMaker does not 
require you to dedicate the entire drive, it only needs a partition. 

That's A Wrap 

	At current street prices, a VLab-AirLink-MovieMaker-DCTV package 
will cost you around $1,500.  If you need a hard drive, you'll have to 
add that into the cost too.  This may sound expensive, but I am not 
aware of anything on any computer platform that will match the 
performance and flexibility of this set up--at least in this price 
range. 

AirLink 

	I just couldn't end this article without mentioning a little bit 
more about AirLink.  By itself, this is an awesome device.  It acts as a 
programmable universal IR remote.  All you do is draw a picture of your 
remote using any paint program (you only need to include the functions 
you will use).  Then you point your remote at the AirLink device, which 
plugs into the joystick port, and record the IR signals one at a time.  
Each recorded signal can be associated with any button in your picture.  
The AirLink's IR LED can be triggered by your mouse,  ARexx, user-
defined hot keys, serial and parallel port data, and MIDI events.  With 
AirLink, all IR-remote-controlled devices, like laserdiscs, TVs, VCRs, 
Stereos, CD players, etc. can be at your beckoned call.  You will no 
longer be limited to controlling only those devices that have serial 
port access.  AirLink is perfect for multimedia presentations. 

	You can even trigger other events beside IR, including sending 
data out the MIDI, serial and parallel ports, executing ARexx commands, 
emulating keystrokes and mouse clicks, and executing programs.  It is 
also possible to add eight additional IR LEDs using an adapter connected 
to the parallel port!  An upcoming version of the software will allow 
you to open an AirLink control window on any public screen.  With this, 
you can control your VCR and be doing VLab operations, all from the same 
screen!

    The winner for June 1994 will be published next week.


- THE PUZZLE -

    Everyone thinks that the other code problem was too easy, which
it was. So this month I made it a bit tricky (and I don't want to
hear any complaints that the solutions are too hard)! This is a
transcript of a press conference about a military operation somewhere
in the United States. Your job is to figure out which companies are
involved. In the next few issues I will make the clues gradually
become easier.

        Gore, the Vice President, made the statement.
        He said he would, but very quietly.

        The engineers are locked up on the island.
        They are computer experts.

        They are no longer incorporated, but AmigaGuide is stored there.
        That is why their fort is so valuable.
        The banner on the building reads "BRCH".

        The surface to air missile drowned in the sea.
        Squad A had to move into the area at 5:00pm, as they always do.
        Strategic Operations in  New York handled the affair.
        They landed opposite their destination.
        There is no other way to calm the port.

        The rest will be printed at a later time.


- TO ENTER -

    To enter, simply let your fingers do the talking and write an
email and send it to dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu. You MUST put
the word CONTEST in the subject line of the email header! Otherwise
you run the risk of having your email deleted (don't ask, it is a
long story!) or send a post card or letter to:

        Amiga Report Contest
        c/o David Tiberio
        6 Lodge Lane
        East Setauket, NY 11733

    Is it possible to win via snail mail? You might think that your
chances of winning are better by entering in email (much faster of
course), but last month's winner send in a letter that arrived the
day before his winning number was drawn!

    In your letter or email, please provide the following:

    Your full name and address. Please keep in mind that many of
you may have addresses that I am not accustomed to, so please include
your country or any other information that I would need in case you
win. An email address should also be included, if possible.

    You must also include a brief one sentence overview of the editorial
in this issue of AMiga Report. Just to make sure you are reading it. :)
You must also include the issue number. For example, if you read this in
AR213, then include that in your correspondance. Also, a prize winner
will be determined by a random number generator. Choose a number from
1 to 262,144. The closest winner or winners to the randomly generated
number will receive the prize in the mail. Anyone who does not provide
a number will have one assigned to him randomly.

    All prizes will be mailed within one week after I get my hands on
the published version of AmigaReport. I am doing this for a few reasons.
First, every winner so far has given the correct puzzle solution before
I have received the editon of AmigaReport that announced it. :)
Second, I don't like to go to the post office every day if I can avoid
it. Third, you never know when someone's power supply might blow up
(right Mr. Editor?!).


- RULES AND REGULATIONS -

1. In the evnt that the editor's power supply fries, the contest for
   that month will have its deadline postponed to a later date, to be
   announced. Any contest entries for the random drawing will be added
   to the next month's drawing, to be held once per month near the
   beginning of the month.

2. All prizes are donated. I cannot be held responsible for any damage
   caused by a prize. For example, if you leave your prize on the
   stairs and your grandmother slips on it, I will not pay her medical
   bills.

3. We are not doing this for any profit, and cannot be held responsible
   if we go out of business or are otherwise financially unable to give
   you anything! We are actively looking for submissions from other
   software authors.

4. Good things come to those who read the rules and regulations! Here
   is a tip to help you win: every problem is a trick problem, or gives
   you clues that are not part of the problem itself. Read the whole
   entire contest entry looking for clues. And read my other articles
   for more clues. I give some very obvious clues :).

5. If for any circumstance you are awarded a prize but do not receive
   as a service to the Amiga community and all persons involved in running 
   this contest cannot be held liable for anything that costs you money or
   lifetime pain and anguish. Rules are subject to change. All entries
   must be received by whenever TBA. Any entries beyond this date
   will be entered into the next contest, if any.


- THE CHANCE YOU WILL WIN -

    Odds of winning are approximately 1:50 for the random drawing and
1:15 for the correct answer to the puzzle, based upon current entries.

    SPECIAL THANKS to SideWinder for donating the Future Shock albums
for inclusion in our contest, along with Merrill Callaway for his ARexx
Reference Disk!

                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

  Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

  The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software, online.

  Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

  Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES.

  35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

  No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

  Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

  Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

  Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

  FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
  Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  

  Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

  The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
  Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
  All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

  Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

  And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

  Direct rates also apply to connections made to Portal using the
  UNIX "telnet" program from an account you may already
  have on an Internet-connected system. 
% 9600 bps Sprintnet in over 300 cities areas
+ $10 rate prevails at smaller US Cities
# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

/// BIX - Byte Information Exchange             Lots of information!
    -------------------------------



BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and enthusiasts.
While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is the place for 
knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  You're likely 
to find many others in similar situations who can offer advice, give 
technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.


                       *** FULL INTERNET ACCESS! ***

BIX features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription. 


                      ==============================
                      Rates and Connect Information:
                      ==============================


BIX membership costs $13 per month, plus connect time.  There are several 
different ways to connect:

SprintNet*              $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays

in addition to the $13 monthly fee.  


                           INTERNATIONAL USERS:

If you wish to connect internationally through Tymnet or SprintNet, 
please contact your local PTT.  BIX accepts prepaid international calls,
direct dial, or telnet connections.  In order to make a "collect" (not 
prepaid) call to BIX, your account must be verified before the charges 
are accepted.  When you complete the registration, we'll mail you a BIX
Membership Agreement by regular US Mail.  Whe you receive it, sign it 
and return it to us by mail.  When we receive it here, we'll authorize
your account to make reverse charged calls.

If you want to access BIX right away, contact your local PTT to set up a 
prepaid account.  You'll pay your local carrier for your calls to BIX in
advance, so there's no waiting period or verfication needed. Or, connect 
at BIX via telnet to x25.bix.com.

SprintNet international calls from most locations are $24 an hour.
Tymnet international charges vary, but are generally between $20-$30 an hour.

@node P5-1 "Oberon-A release 1"
@toc "menu"

TITLE

    Oberon-A

VERSION

    Release 1

AUTHOR

    Frank Copeland -- oberon@wossname.apana.org.au

DESCRIPTION

    Oberon-A is a freely-distributable Oberon-2 compiler. Oberon-2 is a
    modern object-oriented language designed by Niklaus Wirth, the creator
    of Pascal and Modula-2, and Hanspeter Mvssenbvck. Oberon-A is an
    implementation of the language for the Amiga computer, ported from a
    compiler written by Niklaus Wirth.

    The archive contains the compiler, a pre-link utility, a linker (BLink)
    and a programmer's environment.  A complete interface to the Amiga
    operating system (version 2.04) and a collection of library modules in
    source code form is provided. Documentation is in AmigaGuide and plain
    ASCII formats. The full source code for the compiler and utilities is
    available in a seperate archive.

    Release 1 is a preliminary release with a limited module library and
    requires testing.

FEATURES

    - The compiler directly generates MC68000 machine code in standard
      AmigaDOS format object files.
    - Both ALink and BLink can be used to link object modules and support
      for other linkers will be progressively added.
    - A garbage collector for memory (with some limitations) is built in to
      the run-time support code.
    - Language extensions include:
      - Escaped characters in strings (big deal :-));
      - Support for BCPL and C pointers.
      - Inline calls to Amiga system libraries;
      - Vararg parameters to pass tag lists to Amiga library calls (next
        update).
    - The compiler is currently CLI-only, but a programmer's environment
      utility provides Workbench access.
    - Interactive and batch compilation is supported.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    Oberon-A requires 1MB of memory and a hard disk is strongly recommended.
    A text editor is required and must be obtained seperately.

HOST NAME

    Oberon-A has been uploaded to AmiNet.  It is available from
    ftp.wustl.edu, archie.au and other AmiNet sites.

DIRECTORY

TITLE

     Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)

VERSION

     Version 2.3a patchlevel 3

AUTHOR

     Original version written by Colin Plumb and various contributors
     Amiga port and enhancements by Peter Simons <simons@peti.GUN.de>

DESCRIPTION

        Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), from Phil's Pretty Good Software, is
     a high security cryptographic software application for MSDOS,
     Unix, VAX/VMS, Amiga and other computers. PGP allows people to
     exchange files or messages with privacy, authentication, and
     convenience. Privacy means that only those intended to receive a
     message can read it. Authentication means that messages that
     appear to be from a particular person can only have originated
     from that person. Convenience means that privacy and
     authentication are provided without the hassles of managing keys
     associated with conventional cryptographic software. No secure
     channels are needed to exchange keys between users, which makes
     PGP much easier to use. This is because PGP is based on a powerful
     new technology called "public key" cryptography. And PGP performs
     the public-key functions faster than most other software
     implementations. PGP is public key cryptography for the masses.

        Please take note that the archive contains a readme file, with
     checksums for ALL files in the distribution and is signed with my
     key! Please be careful, if this file is missing or rigged!


CHANGES

     This version includes many changes compared to the original 2.3a
     release:

     - modified PGP to recognize local (SET vs. SETENV) shell
       variables, too. (Only available under OS 2.04 or later!)

     - the executable is now pure and may be made resident

     - converted the documentation to AmigaGuide-format.

     - added an Installer script (Thanks to Jacob Ellis!!)

     - Whenever PGP needs user input, it will check whether the current
       standard input is interactive. This will avoid infinite loops
       and crashes when started with "PGP -f <test". If the standard
       input is not interactive, PGP will pop up an requester asking
       for the string.

     - PGP is able to read its commandline from a file! (Note: The
       Amiga version is the _only_ PGP version that has this
       capability. :->)

     - I modified PGP to display the last 32 bit of the internal key
       ID, like PGP 2.6 does. This reduces the chance of ID-collision.

     - PGP 2.3a.3 can read and write encrypted texts or signatures in
       PGP 2.6's packet format.


NOTES

        A mailing list concerning PGPAmiga has been created on
     peti.GUN.de. To subscribe, send e-mail to listserv@peti.GUN.de
     with "ADD your_address PGPAmiga" in the message body. You may add
     "HELP" in the next line to receive a command overview of ListSERV.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     none


LEGALITY

        This version of PGP is perfectly legal anywhere besides the
     United States of America and Canada. US citizens will have to wait
     until the Amiga version of PGP 2.6 is finished. An announcement
     will be made here, too.

TITLE

    CycleToMenu - turns cycle gadgets into popup menus


VERSION

    2.1  (6.6.94)


AUTHOR

    Federico Giannici <MC4080@mclink.it>


DESCRIPTION

    CycleToMenu is a commodity that turns the standard cycle gadgets
    into popup menus or "expanding" gadgets. This way, selecting the
    desired option is easier and faster.

    The look and behaviour of the popup menus are highly configurable
    by a font&resolution-sensitive configuration window.

    CycleToMenu works under AmigaOS 2.0 but takes advantage of some
    features of AmigaOS 3.x.

    The archive contains the documentation and localization files in
    five languages: English, Italian, German, Dutch and French.


NEW FEATURES

    - Using an overlay for the configuration window and other rarely
      used functions. Even if the program is slightly longer, normally
      it uses 11Kb of memory less than the previous version!
    - Added the "Centre on current item:" option. It also allows to
      obtain a more MUI-like look.
    - Fixed a bug in the GT_PostFilterIMsg() function's patch. It
      solves also a problem with the "Overscan" gadget of the
      screenmode-requester of the reqtools.library.
    - Added the French language support.
    - Added an optional MagicWB-style icon.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    AmigaOS 2.0.
    AmigaOS 2.1 is required for the localization.


HOST NAME

    Available via anonymous FTP from Aminet,
    for example ftp.luth.se (130.240.18.2).

Norwegian origin MBBS running in a DesqView windows.

We have now (26th March 1994) over 10000 files online (mostly for
the Commodore Amiga line of the personal computers.)

Every user has an access to download filelist (LAHOFIL.ZIP), list of the
Finnish 24-hour BBS's (BBSLIST.ZIP or BBSLIST.LHA) and every issue of
the Amiga Report Magazine (AR101.LHA-AR???.LHA) even on their first call.

The system has been running since 1989 and is sponsored by the local
telephone company, Vaasan Lnin Puhelin Oy.

BTW, LAHO stands for "LAtomeren Hyrylaiva Oy" = "Barnsea Steamship Co."
