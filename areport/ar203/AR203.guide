Is the world coming to an end or just freezing over?  Los Angeles is
shaking violently, the eastern US has been dumped on with snow, and the
midwest is freezing solid.  It hit something like -36 in Minneapolis the
other night, and was down to -15 here in Omaha.  The Twin Cities had wind
chills in the -80 range, and ours were in the -40's.  Egad.  My car will
barely run in that kind of weather!  Spring, where are you???

I've changed jobs again, so as soon as I finish settling in at the new
one, I should be able to devote more time to the magazine.  With the
first quarter of 1994 approaching, we should see some interesting new
products appearing.  Elsewhere in this issue is a re-print of Soft-Logik's
press release for PageStream 3.0.  We hope to see a final production copy
of it sometime in March.  The latest word from Supra is that the voice-mail 
chip for their modems will appear next month, though I doubt it will have 
any direct Amiga support.  But it'll keep third party vendors busy.

Fred Fish's second CD ROM will be out shortly, and more and more games are
appearing for the CD32.  More than I expected anyway.  Maybe I'm still
used to Atari's sluggishness in terms of game releases.  I'm still waiting
for the Asteroids/Missile Command combo cartridge for my Lynx that they 
announced nearly two years ago. ;)

Hopefully, between Jaguar and CD32, we can kick the crap out of the
Japanese videogame makers Sega and Nintendo.  Nintendo's Saturn system,
which is a collaboration with SGI, isn't due out until this coming fall at
the earliest.  That gives Jaguar and CD32 a very large lead on establishing
a market.  Hopefully _marketing_ will take place in both cases, and we'll
see them do really well.  It's time America got back on top in something!

                ** Motorola's 4th Quarter Earnings Up **

   Motorola Inc. reported its fourth quarter earnings rose 87.8% due to
record sales and continued export growth. Reports say that the company's
profits rose to $340 million (or $1.15 a share) in the three months
ended Dec. 31, up from $181 million (or 64 cents a share) for the same
period a year ago. Sales rose 35% to $4.99 billion from $3.71 billion in
the last quarter of 1992.


                    ** NEC, Toshiba Develop DRAM **


   A new low-voltage 16-megabit DRAM (dynamic random access memory) chip
for portable PCs has been developed by NEC Corp. and Toshiba Corp.

   Officials of the companies said the 3.3-volt chips have a 16-bit in-
put and output structure that makes them more efficient, prolonging PC
battery life.

   A Fujitsu Ltd. spokesman Said that firm is developing a similar chip
and plans to begin production in the first half of the year.


        ** PC World and Newsweek Plan Joint Computing Reports **

   PC World and Newsweek magazines have announced that they will jointly
publish four special computing reports in 1994.   The special sections
will focus on developments in the small office, home office (SOHO) com-
puter market. They will be prepared by the editors of PC World. The four
sections will appear in issues of both PC World and Newsweek in April,
June, September and December.

   "We estimate that by 1996, SOHO computer users will account for more
than $15.5 billion in U.S. PC purchases, over 55% of the anticipated to-
tal PC market in the country," says PC World Publisher Rich Marino. "It
is increasingly important for high-tech marketers to reach this growing
market."


             ** Compuserve Lowers Hourly Charges by 40% **

   CompuServe announced this week it is lowering connect charges by 40%
for hourly-priced services, such as forums, travel services, financial
services, reference databases and entertainment offerings.  Reports say
that the lowered charges, which are for those members subscribing under
CompuServe's Standard Pricing Plan, take effect Feb. 6.

   The new rates are $4.80 per hour for 300, 1,200 and 2,400 baud rates
and $9.60 for 9,600 and 14,400 baud rates.

   In addition to hourly-priced services, CompuServe members have access
to more than 50 basic services for a flat fee of $8.95 per month. Compu-
Serve offers access at modem speeds of 14,400 bits per second in many
major cities, the only major online service to do so, and at the same
cost as access at 9,600 bits per second.


      ** Compuserve to Provide Local Customer Support in Mexico **

   CompuServe Inc. also announced this week that it will provide local
customer support and network access to CompuServe Information Service
members in Mexico beginning this spring.

   CompuServe provides local-dial access through its own network nodes
from 17 major cities in Europe and has member support offices in
Bristol, England, Munich, Germany, and Paris. CompuServe also has
licensing or affiliate agreements in Japan, Australia, New Zealand,
Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Israel, Hungary, Chile, Venezuela and
Argentina.


                 ** Nintendo Settles Copyright Suit **

   A copyright infringement suit between Nintendo of America Inc. and
United Microelectronics Corp. has been settled out of court. Terms calls
for UMC to take steps to combat piracy of Nintendo video games, the
firms said.

   The settlement ends litigation of a federal suit filed in 1991 by
Nintendo against UMC, of Hsinchu City, Taiwan, and its U.S. subsidiary,
Unicorn Microelectronics Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif., and several
individuals associated with the companies. In that action, Nintendo
alleged copyright and trademark infringement in the sale of counterfeit
Nintendo video games.

   The case was dismissed "with prejudice," which prevents either side
from bringing another action in the matter.


                 ** IBM Awarded Most Patents in 1993 **

   IBM Corp. reports that it ranked first in the number of patents awar-
ded in 1993 by the U.S. government, marking the first time since 1985
that an American company has headed the list.  IBM received 1,088
patents, followed by Toshiba Corp., Canon KK and Eastman Kodak Co.,
according to IFI/Plenum Data Corp. In 1992, the first four companies
were all Japanese.

   The IBM patents were almost exclusively in the field of information
processing, with an increase in software-related inventions.


                  ** World Workstation Market Soars **

   The world workstation market will more than quadruple in revenues and
grow by more than 10 times in unit sales by the end of the century,
reports Frost & Sullivan/Market Intelligence, the Mountain View, Calif.-
based market research firm.

   The company states that sales will swell from $10.6 billion in 1992
to $20 billion in 1995 and $48.7 billion in 1999 at a 24% compound
annual rate.

   Enterprise workstations will pace the market's growth, increasing
from 32% of all worldwide workstation revenues in 1992 to 51% by 1999.


   ** Magazine Says Pentagon Proposes Limiting Internet Army Links **

   A computer magazine says it has learned U.S. defense officials, fear-
ing the possibility of computer intruders, are moving to limit military
links to the international Internet network.

   The magazine, Network World, reported a plan to add a protective
gateway or relay to the worldwide Defence Data Network (also called
Milnet) has caused an uproar among computerists in and out of the
Pentagon.

   The publication says a notice from the defense department's network
planning group said the gateway's introduction was due early in 1994,
but that so far the plan has not been implemented and Internet users
still have direct links to the Milnet.


                   ** Smart Device Shipments Soar **

   New York-based market researcher, LINK Resources, reports that ship-
ments of all types of "smart" handheld devices -- including high-end
organizers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), personal communicators
and some handheld CD-ROM products -- grew from 600,000 units in 1992 to
779,000 units in 1993.

   LINK Resources forecasts a 45.7%t compound annual growth rate over
the next five years for these devices, with over five million units
shipping to business and home users in the U.S. in 1998.

   LINK forecasts that annual shipments will increase in value from $454
million to $3.3 billion during this period, while the installed base
grows to 9.5 million devices.


             ** Canadian Teen Accused of $500,000 Fraud **

   An unidentified Toronto teenager has allegedly used a computer to
defraud cellular phone network of $500,000 worth of long distance calls.

   Authorities are quoted as saying the teen changed the greetings in
the voice mailboxes so the new greetings could be used to approve calls
billed to the Rogers Cantel Inc. network.

   "About $200,000 worth of calls were billed to a single phone number
over a 17-day period". "Cantel blames Bell Canada's new automated long-
distance billing service, and is fighting with the phone company over
who should pay for the losses."

   An industry analyst estimated long-distance fraud costs North
American companies $2 billion a year, much of it by computer intruders.


                       ** Who's a 'Butthead'? **

   It all started when famed scientist Carl Sagan reportedly complained
to Apple Computer Inc. that he didn't appreciated his name being borrowed
as the internal code name for a new Apple computer.

   Reports say that after receiving the complaint, Apple changed the
internal code name of the upcoming model from "Carl Sagan" to "Butt-Head
Astronomer."

   Sagan supposedly asked the company to stop using his name after an
article about the new model appeared in MacWEEK magazine.

   Reportedly, the Butt-Head Astronomer system -- well, "BHA" for short
-- is one of three Apple models to use the PowerPC microprocessor
developed by Apple, Motorola Inc. and IBM.


                 ** Practical Peripherals Cuts Costs **


   Practical Peripherals this week cut prices by up to $100 on eight of
its high-speed data and fax modems for PCs and Macintosh computers.

   Practical says its PM14400FX PKT pocket modem, formerly priced at
$499, has been reduced to $399.

   Meanwhile, the PM14400FXMT V.32bis desktop modem offering 14400bps
data and 14400bps fax capabilities, was reduced to $259 from $299.

   Other PC modems affected by the price reduction are the PM14400FX,
reduced from $259 to $229; the PM9600FXMT, down from $249 to $219, and
the PM9600FX, from $229 to $199.

   Three Macintosh modems in the price cut are the PM14400FX PKT/Mac,
from $529 to $429, the PM14400FXMT/Mac, down from $299 to $279, and the
PM9600FXMT/Mac, cut from $269 to $229.

   Practical notes all the modems feature DTE (computer to modem) speeds
up to 57,600bps, both Class 1 and Class 2 fax support, V.42 error cont-
rol, V.42bis data compression, send/receive fax and are compatible with
the Hayes standard AT command set. Each comes with data and fax
communications software.


               ** Atari Jaguar Grabs Top Awards at CES **


   Atari Corp. announced this week that the Atari Jaguar 64-bit inter-
active multimedia game system has been named the industry's "Best New
Game System" (VideoGames Magazine), "Best New Hardware System" (Game
Informer) and "1993 Technical Achievement of the Year" (DieHard GameFan).
The awards were presented last week at the Winter Consumer Electronics
Show in Las Vegas. In addition, VideoGames Magazine selected a Jaguar
advertisement as "1993's Best Print Ad" and Electronic Games voted
Jaguar's newest software title, "Tempest 2000," the "Best Game of the
Show."

   "We are excited the industry's premier publications have recognized
Jaguar," said Sam Tramiel, president of Atari. "We developed Jaguar's
64-bit technology to raise the standard for game system performance,
making Jaguar the most powerful, affordable system on the market. It is
an honor to know that the leading trade magazines and their readers
recognize our efforts."

   "We created the 'Best New Game System' award specifically for
Jaguar," said Chris Gore, editor of VideoGames Magazine. "Atari
developed a new game system with innovative hardware and software that
delivers a performance level currently not available in the market at a
price people can afford. It eclipses 3DO as the best bang for your
buck."

   On Game Informer's decision to vote Jaguar "Best New Hardware
System," Editor Andy McNamara said, "With enough raw processing power to
take out the big boys, Atari has a winner on its hands. Of course, it
will need great software, but if games like the pack-in Cybermorph set
the standard, Atari is definitely on its way."

   Atari Corp. manufactures and markets 64-bit interactive multimedia
entertainment systems, video games and personal computers for the home,
office and educational marketplaces. The Sunnyvale-based company
manufactures the Jaguar products in the United States.


         ** Atari Jaguar Poised to Pounce Nationally in 1994 **

   Atari Corp. also announced this week that the company plans to roll
out Jaguar(TM) -- the world's first 64-bit interactive multimedia home
entertainment system -- in the first half of 1994. In addition, Jaguar
and its first four software titles, "Cybermorph," "Raiden, " "Evolution
Dino-Dudes" and "Crescent Galaxy," will continue to ship steadily to
stores in New York and San Francisco.

   "We look forward to extending Jaguar's success in the New York and
San Francisco markets by implementing a nationwide rollout of the pro-
duct in 1994, " said Sam Tramiel, president of Atari. "What is espec-
ially rewarding is customer response to Jaguar -- it's great to see how
people react to the system. We are committed to making Jaguar the
world's number one game platform and this is a powerful start."

   "Sales of the Jaguar couldn't better. All of our units sold out in
one day and we've got a list of more than 100 people waiting for our
next shipment," said Gary Jockers, general manager, FAO Schwarz, San

Francisco. "The new titles we received are selling out as fast as the
systems. Our customers are clamoring to get these new games. Now that
we've got all of the current game titles available for Jaguar, the
demand is only increasing for more units."

   Atari Jaguar is the world's first 64-bit interactive multimedia home
entertainment system and is the only video game system manufactured in
the United States. Atari expect to deliver its Jaguar CD-peripheral in
the second half of 1994 at a suggested retail price of $200.


                 ** IBM Cuts Pentium-Based PC's 10% **

   Prices of all the IBM PCs built around Intel Corp.'s Pentium micro-
processor are being cut by more than 10%, according to officials with
IBM's wholly owned Ambra unit.

   Analysts said the competing PowerPC chip -- developed by IBM, Apple
Computer Inc. and Motorola Inc. -- costs less than the Pentium because
it is easier to make.

   Last month Intel said it will cut prices on its Pentium chip by 14%
to 18% this year to build market share as production speeds up.

   Also, IBM is introducing two new high-performance options for its
Pentium-based systems: a Matrox MGA II+ video card and the Adstar 1GB
hard drive.


                 ** Tandy to Open More Supercenters **

   Tandy Corp. is set to open 24 Computer City SuperCenters and six new
Incredible Universe consumer electronics stores this year. Sources quote
Tandy as saying the stores will add 3,600 new jobs throughout the United
States.


          ** Packard Bell Moves Tech Support to Magna, Utah **

   Packard Bell's technical support operations is moving from Los
Angeles to Magna, Utah. The company also considered sites in Tucson,
Arizona, Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Portland, Oregon.

   Utah state officials said the move will create about 600 jobs, with
the PC maker using 35,000 square feet of space.


                ** First MAC Nubus Hardware Announced **


   Digital Communications Associates (DCA) says it will deliver token
ring and coaxial adapters for Macintosh NuBus machines.

   DCA believes these are the first interface cards available for
Apple's seven-inch form factor NuBus computer systems.

   The MacIRMAtrac NuBus Token Ring and MacIRMA NuBus Coax are network
adapters designed for the Centris 610, 660 av and the Quadra 610, 660 av
series of Macintosh computers. They also work on older NuBus machines.

   The Token Ring card features its own memory for downloading microcode
and to provide higher performance levels. The Coax card features RAM-
based hardware which allows product upgrades through software updates.

   Both DCA products will be available next month through DCA's standard
distribution network. The Token Ring adapter carries a suggested price
of $895. Retail price on the Coax adapter is $1,195.

   Additional information is available from DCA at 800/348- 3221.
International customers may fax product or pricing requests to 
404/442-4364.

PAGESTREAM 3.0 AMIGA
PRESS RELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Soft-Logik Presents An In-Depth Preview Of PageStream 3.0 Amiga!

St. Louis, Missouri (September, 1993)   Soft-Logik Publishing 
Corporation will present an in-depth preview of PageStream 3.0. 
PageStream 3 is a completely new version of the #1 desktop 
publishing program on the Amiga. Adding a comprehensive list of 
features that users have requested, PageStream 3 surpasses its 
competition.

PageStream 3 is the ideal program for any desktop publishing 
project. It can be used to write letters, produce high-end color 
separations and publish complex books with multiple sections and 
chapters. The new trapping and plate control features makes 
PageStream 3.0 a leader in the emerging pre-press field.  

PageStream 3 breaks new ground with a dual paragraph and character 
style system that allows style override, style ripple and object 
styles. The new style system makes applying attributes to text and 
objects easier than ever before.  PageStream's flexible toolbox 
allows users to choose between small, large, vertical and horizontal 
toolbox layouts. There are even floating panels for fonts, colors, 
styles, macros and pages to make editing easier.
 
PageStream 3 offers an incredible array of document formatting 
features. Auto-kerning and auto-hyphenation have been added, and text 
styles are configurable, including changing the shadow type and offset,
and the underline method. The tab feature allows left/center/right 
alignment on any character, and dot leaders (filled tabs) can be made 
with any character.

PageStream 3.0 now supports the PANTONE(R) Color System. PageStream 3.0 
uses this industry standard to provide printed color accuracy with 
guaranteed results.  In addition to PANTONE support, PageStream 3.0 
offers support for spot and process color, and CMYK, HSV, and RGB 
color models.

PageStream has always been the import format champion with numerous 
formats supported. Import a Word Perfect file and export a Final Copy
document. Or import an IFF ILBM and export it as TIFF. Import an Adobe
Illustrator 3.0 EPS file, interpret it into a structured drawing, and 
dissolve it into component shapes and paths.

And the newly added format of translating Professional Page documents. 
Users of Gold Disk's Professional Page desktop publishing program can
now make the transition to PageStream painlessly. Converting a 
Professional Page document for use in PageStream is a simple task. 

PageStream 3 adds the power of ARexx without adding the complexity. 
ARexx scripts can be written from scratch or recorded within the 
program. Scripts can then be played back, without knowledge of ARexx
programming. PageStream 3 features are an extensive ARexx command set 
that will satisfy any power-user.

The PageStream 3.0 publishing system comes with the PageLiner 2.0 text
editor and the BME 2.0 bitmap editor. These programs are linked to 
PageStream with the included HotLinks 2.0, the Amiga data exchange 
standard.

PageStream 3.0 will be available in the first quarter of 1994 for $395. 
Customers who purchase a full copy of PageStream 2.2 after March 15, 1993,
are eligible for a free upgrade to version 3.0 by mailing their registration
card, proof of purchase and $5 for shipping and handling, to Soft-Logik.
Previous purchasers can upgrade for $125 if they own PageStream 2.0 or
higher, or for only $95 if they also own HotLinks Editions. Professional
Page owners can upgrade to PageStream for $175. (limited time offer)


PageStream 3.0 will change the way you think about publishing.


[Editor's Note:  The latest news is that PGS3 is set for release sometime
in March of 1994.  Hopefully it'll actually make it this time.  I'm
eagerly awaiting it!]

DESCRIPTION

     ForceIcon is an utility mainly for users of CDRom drives.
     Since one can not snapshot the position of a volume`s icon,
     nor replace it by a user-defined one, I wrote this utility.
     ForceIcon allows you to set the position of a disk`s icon
     and/or replace it by a different image/icon which doesn`t
     have to be a disk.info file. All types of ".info" files may
     be selected.

NEW FEATURES

     You may copy an entry now, ie.  all the settings for an existing
     entry may be copied to a new entry, so that you may easily create
     entries for CD0:-CD5:  or whatever, without having to re-enter
     all the settings

     of the calculator may be customized. ARexx Port for ease of
     calculating from within an editor. Some functions are able to
     return TeX compatible output. Results or inputs may be copied
     to the Clipboard.

     MUIProCalc comes with a fancy GUI you may configure to your needs.
     Function gadgets may be flipped through using pages so that they
     don`t eat up too much of space. MUIProCalc supports an input/output
     history you may configure so that you may re-insert previously entered
     expressions/results. History entries may be copied to a userdefiniable
     clipboard unit. It features various display/output bases such as decimal,
     hexadecimal, octal, and binary and of course calculation sizes ranging
     from 8 Bit to 32 Bit width. Angles may be displayed as radiants or
     degrees. MUIProCalc offers an ARexx port you may use to calc expressions
     externally. These commands are able to return TeX compatible output
     such as "1\cdot 10^{-5}". It comes with two example scripts for use
     with CED Pro.

NEW FEATURES

     - ARexx Port added so that you may calculate expressions from
       within an editor. Some ARexx functions may return TeX compatible
       output which may be directly used within a mathematical TeX

DESCRIPTION

     MUI-Builder is an application builder for MUI programs.  It will
     allow beginners and other programmers to build their Graphic User
     Interface very easily.

     It generates C or E code for MUI.

     With the many options of MUI-Builder, you will be able to
     generate precisely the part of the source code you really want,
     and not only the whole interface.  This will permit you to easily
     maintain your code whithout losing your previously modified
     program, each time you change your interface.  Moreover you will
     be able to design the inline hypertext guide from MUI-Builder by
     attaching a help text to each GUI-Object of your interface.  The
     builder will be able to create the AmigaGuide documentation
     automatically.

RELEASE

AUTHOR

SHORT

     ReqTools 2.2 - the requester toolkit library

DESCRIPTION

     reqtools.library is a standard Amiga shared, runtime library.
     The purpose of ReqTools is to make it a lot quicker and easier
     to build standard requesters into your programs.  ReqTools is
     designed with Commodore's style guidelines in mind, all
     requesters have the look-and-feel of AmigaDOS Release 2.

     ReqTools features the following requesters:  a query requester,
     a string requester, a number requester, a file requester, a
     font requester, a palette requester, a volume requester and a
     screenmode requester.

     Also included are RTPatch (1.3) and RexxReqTools (1.2e):

     RTPatch is a small program that will re-route functions from
     most popular requester libraries to ReqTools.  Libraries
     currently supported are Arp, Req and Asl.  RTPatch will also
     patch some functions in Intuition to give you improved system
     requesters.

     RexxReqTools gives ARexx users easy access to a large family of
     requesters.  All requesters are easy to use; they require one
     or no arguments.  But the requesters also have a lot of power
     through several optional arguments and through tagstrings.
     RexxReqTools itself doesn't implement any of these requesters,
     it is a link between ARexx and ReqTools.

NEW FEATURES

     ReqTools 2.2:

     (NOTE: All changes listed below are for the Kickstart 2.0 and
            higher version of the library (unless stated otherwise).
            Development of the 1.3 compatible version of ReqTools has
            more or less stopped.)

     o File, font and screenmode are now able to use proportional
       fonts, making them truly font-sensitive.  Palette requester
       will accept and use a proportional font on Kickstart 3.0 or
       higher only.  Note:  this required a small catalog change, so
       be sure to update your catalogs.

     o Added cool LED indicator left of the drawer gadget in the file
       requester (optional).

     o File requester will now make sure 'freq->Dir' and 'filename'
       are up-to-date when a callback hook is called (RTFI_FilterFunc
       and RT_IntuiMsgFunc).  If you want to rely on this please
       check for this _exact_ release of ReqTools (or higher of
       course).

     o File requester will show file sizes in localized form now.

     o Screenmode requester now handles color depths greater than
       8192 colors correctly (will use 16K, 32K, 16M,...  for high
       color values).  Previously the window borders could get
       overwritten, oops :-)

     o Removed hardcoded monitor names from screenmode requester code
       and made screenmode requester construct the name for an
       unnamed mode from the monitor name and dimensions.

     o Bug fix: when the SCREQF_GUIMODES flag is used the screenmode
       requester will no longer show modes that haven't got the
       DIPF_IS_WB flag set.  This fixes the problem of truecolor
       Picasso II modes showing up.

     o Added a temporary workaround for a SAS/C bug (6.50 and
       earlier) creating incorrect code for taglist switches.
       Programs with a missing TAG_END in one of their taglists will
       no longer crash (but are still buggy ;-)

     o Changed rtLockWindow() and rtUnlockWindow() nesting code.
       Should work much better now and allow for infinite nesting.

     o Improved calculation of spacing value in rtGetVScreenSize(),
       will now properly return a spacing of 4 for A2024 monitor for
       example.

     RTPatch 1.3:

     o ASL Intuition message callback function/hook (FRF_DOMSGFUNC
       and ASLFR_IntuiMsgFunc tags) seems to require filtered
       Intuition messages (GadTools) instead of normal IntuiMessages.
       RTPatch now uses GT_FilterIMsg() and GT_PostFilterIMsg() in
       its message callback hook emulation to support this strange
       requirement.  On top of this some software (e.g.  PhotoWorX)
       seems to rely on the fr_Drawer and fr_File fields to be valid
       and up-to-date during the execution of the hook.  In
       combination with ReqTools 2.2 this will now be the case.

     o New argument: 'IGNOREHEIGHT'.  When this is switch is used
       RTPatch will ignore the height setting for the Asl file
       requester and will always use the default ReqTools setting (as
       set by the ReqTools preferences program).

     o In case of a multiselect ASL requester RTPatch will always
       fill in the fr_File field with the name of the first file that
       was selected.  This is not really required, but improves
       compatibility with Term.

     o Set mp_SigTask of dummy message port to NULL and mp_Flags to
       PA_IGNORE.  This is done to avoid all sorts of problems with
       some system snoopers.

DESCRIPTION

    TeXt Plus Professional is a TeX frontend word processor. TeX is a
    professional freeware typesetting programm. The greatest problem of
    TeX for the average user was - up to now - TeX's complexity and the
    resulting difficulty to fast and efficiently create documents. This is
    where TPP starts to work.

    Now you just have to load a form sheet, which has to be modified at
    the respective places only. After this the file is compiled to a TeX-
    file by TPP, which then itself is processed by the TeX compiler. After
    both compilations either the previewer or the printer driver can be
    invoked.

    TPP cooperates with PasTeX, the freeware Amiga implementation of TeX
    written by Georg Hessmann, and with AmigaTeX ((c) Radical Eye
    Software). Among TPP's features are tables, staggered lists,
    mailmerge, footnotes, inclusion of graphics, an ARexx-port (122
    commands) and full OS2.xx/3.xx compatibility. You can make use of all
    functions of TeX, even if they are not supported directly, e. g. there
    is no editor for mathematical formulae, yet.

    TPP combines its user friendliness with the typesetting power of TeX
    in order to open the world of TeX to a totally new group of users.

    TPP is not only a TeX frontend. You can also use it as a normal editor
    and print files via the printer.device.

NEW FEATURES

    - AmigaTeX is from now on supported.
    - user definable menus, keymap, and macros
    - completely localized (available languages: english, deutsch)
    - clipboard support
    - AppWindow, AppIcon
    - 11 new ARexx commands (total number of commands now: 122)

HARD- AND SOFTWARE-REQUIREMENTS

    - Amiga OS 2.04
    - at least. 2 MB RAM
    - at least.1,5 MB hard disk space
      (10MB when working with TeX)
    - PasTeX V1.3 or AmigaTeX

TITLE

    The Duniho and Duniho Life Pattern Indicator

VERSION

    V3.10

AUTHOR

    Fergus Duniho

    E-mail: fdnh@troi.cc.rochester.edu

DESCRIPTION

    The DDLI is a personality indicator that measures for four
    different sets of preferences that result in a total of sixteen
    different psychological types.  These four sets of preferences are

        How we orient our lives:

            Extraversion vs. Introversion

        How we prefer to gather information:

            Sensing vs. iNtuition

        How we prefer to make decisions:

            Thinking vs. Feeling

        Which sort of lifestyle we prefer:

            Judging vs. Perceiving

    These 16 types correspond to the psychological types that Carl Jung
    described in _Psychological Types_.  They also correspond to the 16
    Myers-Briggs types measured by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.

    The DDLI asks you a series of multiple choice questions and calculates
    its results from your answers.  It asks you to rank each of your
    answers on a scale from 1 to 7. It also asks you questions on other
    sets of preferences that are supposed to match various combinations of
    the above four sets. This is so it provides a check on itself, as it
    can be fallible.

    The DDLI comes with extensive support material.  Included are full
    length descriptions of each one of the 16 types, the "Personality Type
    Summary" by Jon Noring, and my own description of the Life Pattern
    personality model.

*** Subj: File_id.diz

I would like to get some info from some of you who run Amiga BBS's.

We are getting ready to put a program on line here at Galaxy that will let 
you use a FILE_ID.DIZ in your uploads. The quesion is, can the Amiga BBS's
support this?????

For those of you who don't know what a FILE_ID.DIZ is, it is an ASCII file 
within an archive that will be extracted upond upload to be placed in the 
discription block. This method has been use by IBM for some time now. It 
will help in several ways.

1. Save time on long distances calles when you upload some files. You will
   not have to spend time writing in discription.

2. You will get better discriptions of files. To aften people are in a hurry
   and just type in a quick discription that means nothing to a lot of users.
   ie; 

        BBGT234.LHA   This is the Latst version
        KISBUT33.LHA  This works real good

   Realy, what are these files for with a discription like that...

3. It would make the Board look more professional. ie;

WABL9312.LHA    28944  01-02-94         _    _       __  ___    _
                                       /\\  |\\   /| || //  \  /\\
                                      /  \\ | \\ /|| ||(< __  /  \\
                                     /--- \\|  \X || || \\_||/--- \\
                                    /                              \\
                                 ÉÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ»

The FILE_ID.DIZ can be put into an LHA or LZH archive by the auther or any
one uploading the files. It is a lot easier sitting off line and typing in
a discription than trying to type one in while your calling lon-distance.
If you want to do it with DMS files you will be able to store it in an LHA 
with the DIZ files. 

Well what do you all think????????????

                             ****************

Many thanks to Robert Glover for posting these messages
from FidoNet in the Amiga Report (latest issue 201).
The drive has received numerous donations/inquiries from Europe
and Australia because of that publication. (This is getting more
international..Where's Hong Kong etc.??)

Total donations as of 1/15/94 are $890.50.  Got a ways to go
folks to purchase the (?A4000T/CD32?) but the fund drive seems
to be picking up some steam. BTW, FFish does in fact already own
an A4000 (shoot!). Suggestions? A CD32 looks to be the most
popular alternative. Please talk this up with all concerned
(Amiga users) and pass the word on to your Users Groups. If you
haven't joined the effort, slip that hand into the pocket and
pull out some bucks, put it into any envelope and send it in.
Let's show what the Amiga community is all about. Check over
some of the programs you have benefited/are benefiting from.
Register them and/or pitch in for FishFund.

* Reminder to everyone PLEASE!!! Pass the word at any Users
Group meetings you attend. This is to be a group effort on
behalf of all the Amiga users throughout the world. Please
donate whatever you can afford - or even better - what you
honestly think FFish's work has been worth to you through the
years. Thanks. BTW, there have been some very nice comments
to/about FFish included in the envelopes with donations.  As I
have been saving these, think I will include them along with the
donation "pot"/CD32 when the time comes. May this be a happy and
prosperous New Year for all - the year of the Amiga.

A company calling itself the International Internet Association, and bill

This week:  Part 1 of the Special Rambling Emplant Bonanza!

As I've been talking about for the last couple of months, I
do indeed finally have an Emplant.  It arrived a week ago Thursday
in a longish white box with the Emplant logo in large, friendly
letters on the cover.  This week begins a long (how long? I don't
know yet) series on my intensive reviews on the Emplant, with
notes, tests, and experiences in no particular order.

The Hardware:  Utilities Unlimited's Emplant, Deluxe model,
V3.7 of Mac IIx emulation software.

The Test Machine:  Commodore Amiga 3000, 2 megs chip/8 megs fast,
68030/25 processor, 120 meg Maxtor SCSI hard drive connected through
3000 SCSI controller, 1950 monitor.

Pandora's Box?  Nah...
----------------------
What did I do when I got home and found the box?  Took it inside and 
opened it, of course!  Inside I found the small, neat Emplant Mac 
emulation binder with the Emplant hardware guide and a disk with the 
Mac software inside.  The manuals look nice, but seem awfully small, 
especially considering that much of the notes in the Mac binder are 
incorrect.  For example, the software version I got was 3.7, the most 
up to date at the time of this writing.  It features, among other things, 
MMU-less operation, but the binder says otherwise.  That's ok, though, 
because the disk comes with emplant.history, a text file tracing all the 
way back to v1.0, "Here's to hoping it works on all systems!"  Under the 
manuals was a sheet of that pink anti-static mattressing stuff, under 
which was an Emplant Deluxe board, under which was another piece of pink 
anti-static mattressing stuff.

Implanting the Emplant
-------------------------------
I dragged my 3000 out of my bedroom and plunked it on the kitchen table.
(great work surface, eh?)  After unscrewing it and perusing the slot-
daughterboard, my first impulse was to put it in the bottom Zorro-only 
slot.  I was struggling with that (it wasn't the greatest leverage 
situation), gave up, and wound up putting it in the Zorro/Video slot, 
since I don't see a big future for my video slot any time soon. That 
wasn't too rough, and nothing else needed to be done, so I put it back 
together. Installing the software is very easy, using the standard 
Commodore install program, and the instructions are pretty straight-
forward.  Once that was done, I did a diagnostic on the board and 
everything tested fine.  Getting the ROM image from an SE-30 that was 
quite literally being used as a doorstop onto my computer involved a 
5-minute modem transfer and a simple requester-setting in the Emplant 
software.  Easy.

About that Emplant software...
----------------------------------------
There's a lot of options on the Emplant Mac setup screen...12, plus
one to start the emulator.  I won't break them down piece by piece,
but I'll comment on ones I found interesting or had problems with...
Task Control:  This is where I had some problems, which I'll get into
later with actually running the System 7.1 software. I had a small
problem with 32 vs. 24 bit, but nothing insurmountable.
Misc I/O Control:  There's an option to set Mouse Emulation to hardware
or software.  I can't tell a difference.

Start Emulator: In general, it would be nice if all of the things in the
other control panels, particularly sound support, could be modified while
the emulation was running...of course, that wouldn't be very genuine
emulation, but it would be a nice feature.

About that System software...
---------------------------------------
Right now, I'm using a 27 meg partition of my drive that I first set up
when I had the use of an A-Max II for several weeks a while ago.  I was
lazy and never ran out of space, so I didn't reformat and repartition my
drive, so I took it from there.  The drive had System 6.0.5 on it, which
I knew would not run in 32-bit mode on Emplant (the CSAE discussion
made it quite clear that 32-bit mode required 7.1).  So I tried to switch
down to 24 bit.  It said that the MMU wouldn't let me.  I could not find
any manual reference to let me switch down to 24-bit mode, so I just
booted directly off of the System 7.1 install disk in 32-bit mode.  That
worked, it just took a little while.  System 7.1 thinks my 3000 is a IIci,
which is just fine by me.  It reports the 5.5 megs of memory I can
squeeze out of Emplant correctly, which is not a universal situation.
I simply installed System 7.1 for a IIx with a pretty minimal setup (I
only threw the Style- and Imagewriter extensions on the HD, since
I doubt I'll be hooking anything else up any time soon.)

System 7.1 itself runs as flawlessly as I can tell...what can I say? It
looks like a Mac.  The screen refresh is definitely not as good as a
real Mac, but still within acceptable parameters.  In other words, it
probably won't drive anyone crazy.  I have had no problems with
color settings, but recommend that the first thing to do is define a good-
sized overscan screen back in Workbench and set the Emplant to use
the NTSC Overscan driver (which you can do in Control Panels on the Mac.)
The game Glypha II didn't like my screen size under good old NTSC.

Drag your screens up and down, then prance that Mac around the town...


                      ------------------------------


Ok, let's face it, one of the neatest parts of the Amiga screen-handling
system is that you can take a screen and drag it up and down.  Including
myself, I've been present for the first week of Amiga ownership for 6
people, and when they find out about it, they love it.  Of course, pulling
down a Workbench screen into a DirWork or Terminus or Dpaint screen is
nice, but how about pulling down a Workbench screen into a Mac screen?
Go ahead!  The Mac screen of course has no standard title bar, but you can use
whatever you set Screen Drag to in Icontrol (even though the Left-Amiga key
acts as a Mac key, it will pass N and M through, letting you flip screens
normally).

This DOES have some side effects, however.  If the screen isn't at the top,
controlling the Mac pointer can get confusing, and I've had problems having
it select title bars.  It's more useful as a "Hey, look what I've got running"
sort of thing.  The Emplant setup screen also gets in the way of all of this,
but that's a minor complaint.


Reservemem?  Reserve THIS!
--------------------------
It's true, Emplant is definitely tweak-ware for the user, and there are all
sorts of ways to try to get Emplant running the best.  Maybe I haven't
done enough of that.  But as it stands now, if I let the program essential 
to Emplant's operation (Reservemem, or in my case Rsrvmemii) run all the 
time, not too many other programs are happy about it.  Usually they are 
things that want to take over the system, such as the game Flashback (or 
indeed most games), but even Terminus and Emplant don't get along: if I 
make a connection, even just using the Amiga's serial port, the system
freezes.  I have not yet had this problem with Ncomm 3.0, but it very 
well may be a choice of devices...at present, I use artser.device with 
Terminus.

Well, hopefully that was a sufficient introduction to my Emplant series.  
Next week I'll actually run some Mac software!  Until then, keep the 
emulators warm.

Ok, not all of them.  After all, I'm only talking about the Amiga, and
I'm sure that they're not ALL here.  But there's a whole lot of them,
and I figured I'd bore everyone to death if I included it in ER proper,
so here it is, the largest single list of emulators in the world that I know

If you want to reprint it, just throw in a little "with permission" blurb

Apple II+ C code                                   ?
Note: I've seen the C code for an Apple II emulator floating around...it
doesn't
compile very well on an Amiga.

GameBoy68000                                       ??
Note: The legitimacy of this is questionable, as I've never seen it run
anything
other than Tetris.  However, someone went through the trouble to write
Tetris in Z80 code, presumably used by the program...


Wow! There you have it, the most complete list I know of.  Please
contact either Angelo or myself with comments, corrections, or
additions.  Keep the emulators warm.

%% Jaguar Games                           Reprinted from STReport #10.03 %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



New games for the Jaguar in 1994 (This is not an official or complete
listing).

                    Return to Zork, by Activision.

The next generation of classic Zork adventures makes its triumphant
64-bit  debut! The closest an interactive computer game has ever come to
cinematic quality production, Return to Zork fully showcases Jaguar's
powerful graphic capabilities by combining a mix of full-motion video
live action scenes, and photo realistic animation. This amazing 64-bit
adventure is filled with danger, intrigue and low cunning. It's loaded
with fascinating puzzles, and a revolutionary interface, an original cast
of real Hollywood actors, more than an hour of spoken dialogue and 200
CD-quality musical themes.

                         Doom, by Id Software

Doom is an ultra-fast virtual reality showcase that plunges you deep into
a brutal 3D world filled with enough graphic violence to earn this
monster its very own warning label. As a renegade space marine, you must
utilize state-of-the-art weaponry and technological artifacts to fend off
legions of gruesome fiends, and use your wits to solve hundreds of lethal
puzzles. Dramatic, high-speed animation and Jaguar's uncompromising
multimedia realism bring this fantastic and grisly adventure to life.

                    Tiny Toon Adventures, by Atari

Leap inside a real cartoon!  Based on the popular Warner Brothers.
characters, this zany platform scroller is a true showcase of Jaguar's
rich animation capabilities. Bad boy Montana Max has a new toy: an Acme
TiToonium Converter. But the only place he can get TiToonium is on a
planet Aurica, and the removal of Titoonium is causing grave ecological
damage to the Toon-filled universe. Armed with an Acme Crazy Net, follow
Buster Bunny, Babs Bunny and Plucky Duck as they embark on a mission to
shut down the Acme TiToonium-Gold Converter--and save planet Aurica.

                European Soccer Challenge, by Telegames

Goooaaaal! The Atari Lynx sports favorite comes to the Jaguar.  This
proven soccer program delivers an expanded season and playoff format, 170
teams and complete team/individual stats. In addition, each player
possesses his own personality and performance capabilities. You even have
the option to make trades. For Sport fanatics, European Soccer Challenge
is a 64-bit kick!

                  Ultimate Brain Games, by Telegames

The popular Lynx mind bender comes to the 64-bit format. Test your moves
against the only system qualified to accommodate all the CPU horsepower
required for a real chess challenge. Work your way to master status on a
full-scale battlefield with classic chess--and checkers, and backgammon.
There's a challenge here for every skill level and member of the family.
Extended features--such as specific game set-up for the computer solution
and digitized graphics--make this product a must for your video game
library.

            Hosenose and Booger, by ASG Technologies, Inc.

Here's one for the sick and twisted. Hosenose has a cold and as fate
would have it, he's managed to sneeze and suck his girlfriend Hotsnot
deep into his brain. In a unique gaming experience that fully showcases
Jaguar's monster graphic capabilities, you'll take a nose-dive into
Hosenose's sinuous nasal passages in search of the lovely yet cerebral
Hotsnot. Through every organ and orifice you'll meet a wild cast of
disgusting characters, including Mickki Mewkus, Logjam Sam, Vicki Virus,
and the Evil Dr. Bile. An off-beat animated adventure only the 64-bit
power of Jaguar can deliver.

                         Club Drive, by Atari

You've never experienced racing like this! Designed especially for the
Jaguar, Club Drive pulls you into a fully rendered 3D environment.  There
are no rails here--just 70 square miles of San Francisco to race through
and explore. Go anywhere as you chase down your opponent in a fast-paced
game of tag through the craggy canyons and frontier towns of the Old
West. Crash and score as you test your wheels in a futuristic skateboard
park--for cars! Experience what it's like to be a toy car and race
through your neighbor's house, around coffee tables and under the
television. It's your chance to do things with a car Henry Ford would've
never dreamed of.

                         Commando, by Microids

Take an in-depth, first-person perspective into the trenches of 64-bit
warfare. As the Officer in Charge of a team of crack commandos, you'll
experience all the rigors of gritty jungle combat through the eyes of a
real soldier as you patrol, set ambushes, destroy key structures, rescue
personnel...and ultimately win one for your Commando team. Jaguar's
sophisticated animation and audio processors bring you front-line combat
so real, extended play  may cause flashbacks!

               Dungeon Depths, by Midnite Software, Inc.

Long ago in an ancient, uncivilized world, man built great castles to
close himself off from the grunts of the earth. And beneath these castles
he built miles of dungeons to imprison you and your repressed minions.
Get ready for a medieval multiple-player role- playing arcade adventure
as you battle "surface dwellers" in an effort to rise up from the
clutches of the aristocracy. With rich, vibrant graphics, this 3D
textured underworld epic makes full use of Jaguar's real-time rendering,
advanced 3D texturing and high-speed animation capabilities.

                     Ultra Vortex, by Beyond Games

Ultra Vortex is street fighting to the 64th power! History has seen the
rise and fall of many warriors. All fell to the power of the Vortex
Guardian, who has dominated mankind for thousands of years. It's 2045,
time again for the Testing. You and nine other able warriors have been
chosen from America's top underground gangs to fight for the right to
take on the Guardian. Drawing on the mesmerizing powers of the Vortex,
you must master deadly street fighting and martial arts skills--including
the lethal "Vortex Annihilator"...destroy a field of formidable champions
and ultimately crush the Guardian!

                     Battlewheels, by Beyond Games

has turned to an increasingly dangerous spectator sports for its
entertainment. Welcome to Battlewheels! Drive solo or team up with as
many  as eight of your buddies for a futuristic demolition derby to the
death. Custom equip your suicide vehicle from the ground up with machine
guns, missiles, flame-throwers...and compete for "kills," cash and glory
against a vicious band of road warriors-- through treacherous deserts and
ghost cities of a bygone era. Yeeehaw!

                         Evidence, by Microids

The magic of the movies meets the power of Jaguar. This 3D interactive
feature combines unbridled 64-bit technology with incredible motion
picture effects. As a young reporter wrongly charged with murder, you
must find a way to escape from prison and expose the party responsible
for putting you behind bars. Full-motion video and digital sound effects
are Evidence of a gaming experience only Jaguar can deliver.

                  Car Wars, by Midnite Software, Inc.

Earth, 2094. Advances in technology eliminated tires, refueling and, in
general, made the roads a safer place--at least within the city limits.
Outside the clean cityscapes--in the Arena, where bloodthirsty drivers
clash in massive road beasts to battle for what is yours, and what you
think should be yours--is where you do your driving. It's a futuristic
off-road carnage bonanza that takes full adventure of Jaguar's stock
graphic processors.

                     Alien vs. Predator, by Atari

Choose your weapon in a 64-bit combat challenge with the stars of these
feature film blockbusters.  Alien's machete-like tail and nasty jaws are
perfect for ripping into any predator.  Predator's sophisticated weaponry
and superior infra-red night vision make it easy to search out your
victims.  The Marine Corporal's massive arsenal and sophisticated combat
computer skills make hunting mutants easy.  Battle through miles of
texture-mapped corridors with stunning digitized character recreations.
Lightning-fast speed provides the ultimate in chase sequences.
Exceptional colors and light shading throw you in the middle of all the
limb-severing action.

                 Brutal Sports Football, by Telegames

Crush 'em, mutilate 'em, splatter 'em all over the field...It's anything
goes in Brutal Sports Football.  No more rules-just pick up the ball and
run for your life as Jaguar's five high-performance processors throw you
on the gridiron with 16 of the most unforgiving mutant teams to ever
separate a cyborg from his generator pack. Compared to this, Pro Ball is
Powder Puff.  Five methods of control, three play modes - an audio/visual
experience that will literally tear you apart.

                      Checkered Flag II, by Atari

Formula racing peaks in real-time 3D action so intense, so realistic,
your skin may actually peel back over your cheekbones. This is
eyeball-dryin' racing action only the blazing speed and power of Jaguar
can deliver.  Customize your car and hit the road against a fierce field
of speed demons.  Cars, buildings and roads are rendered in true
toe-curling 3D. 100 percent authentic effects - crashes are realistic in
both sound and imagery, with parts flying and tires screeching.  Helmet
optional, but highly recommended!

                        Tempest 2000, by Atari

Updated with heart-stopping energy, this arcade classic sweeps into the
21st Century.  Using vector graphics, rapid fire, a fully interactive
starfield and CD-quality stereo sound, the power of Jaguar teleports
Tempest 2000 into the 64th dimension.  Manipulative abilities have been
modernized with new features that include spins and twists not seen in
the original, plus an exciting upgrade to the year 2000 that spotlights
Jaguar's 3D polygon rendering capabilities.

Last week in the article about the Amiga IRC channel, I made the fatal
mistake of noting that Pjotr was the moderator. Thanks to just about
everyone on the channel I found out that I was grossly incorrect.

When you create a group on the IRC you become the "moderator". The Amiga
channel really has no moderator. Each member who enters the group
needs to moderate him/herself. There are a few people who frequent the
group that have special privledges (like kicking those who are annoying
out of the group), but no single person controls the #amiga IRC 
channel.

Thanks to those who took the time to explain this to me.

Continuing the article, thise week we will take a look at Aminet.

Aminet is a huge collection of Amiga freely distributable files
that are 'mirrored' to many other sites. These sites can be
accessed by anonymous FTP. There are over 5000 files on the 
Aminet with the expectation that it will hold over 10000 files
before the end of this year (I'm sure that they are quite close
as it is now). 

Aminet started back in January of 1992 when Urban Mueller took over
a small archive of Amiga files and put them on his system, ab20.
After a while the site grew too large and with the help of Peter
Sjostrom of amiga.physik, the main part of Aminet moved there, with
ab20 being the mirror.

In May of 1992 the university ordered the Aminet archive to be
shut down at amiga.physik. Chris Myers of wuarchive gave Urban
an account and the disk space to move the Aminet archives there.

As featured in AR127, Urban reported that an estimate of over 10000
users frequented wuarchive with over 250,000 files being downloaded
a month.

Aminet is currently centered on ftp.wustl.edu and ftp.cdrom.com but over
12 sites mirror Aminet making access more feasable.

    Hello out there all you Amiga users!  I'm writing this to let
everyone know about bstorm.bga.com - one of the first free CNet-Amiga
systems running over the InterNet (but not the only one).  Users may
login to the BBS via telnet, saving long distance charges.  The BBS
offers over 40 online games, two MUD's, shell accounts, ftp, and soon
IRC to the public.  We are finally moving out of our beta testing phase
with our v.32b SLIP connection.

    The message bases have been inactive recently - something that
will hopefully be remedied as we soon will be supporting lots of high
interest news groups, and FidoNet echos, and the prospect of new
users.  This section of the BBS is still under alot of construction -
and cosysops are needed.  Via FTP, bstorm offers many unique files -
many of which are not currently on Aminet.  Other files are located on
our CD-ROM drive, which rotates the Aminet CD and the "Ultimate MOD
Collection CD" - a CD which offers 667 MB of MODs to the public.
All of this is free to the public!  You may join bstorm today via:

BBS:  "telnet bstorm.bga.com"

MUD:  "telnet bstorm.bga.com 4000"

FTP:  "ftp bstorm.bga.com", login "anonymous", password <user@host>,
      "binary"

GENERAL INFO ON THE GAME

         For starters, I must say this is a fantasic PD strategy game!
         What's even more amazing is the fact that this game was
         written in AMOS. This game really shows off what AMOS can do.
         But enough of that, let's get on with the review of "Colonial
         Conquest".

         If you've ever seen the graphics of "Civilization", that's
         what the planet scenes look similar too. You can't move around
         on the planets surface except for the small box you see when
         you first colonize it. As for the graphics in space, well the
         planets look exactly the same (But hey! It's free so don't
         complain, got it?! =-)

         Choosing things (such as objects to produce) is all mouse
         driven. It makes the game all the more fun because you don't
         waste your time trying to figure out all the buttons on the
         keyboard.

         After starting a nice colony, I started producing ships so I
         could fly to other planets. A nice range of ships are
         available to you. Colony ships are used to carry people to
         other planets. Once their they can create new colonies. There
         are also transport ships which allow transportation of goods
         between the planets. Then you can get into more of the
         fighting ships starting with a cruiser. Basically all it is is
         a small warship. A step up from that is a fighter (a stronger
         version of the cruiser) then a dreadnought (even stronger).
         Last but not least comes the biggest of all ships... the
         BATTLESTAR! This is the mother of all ships for the human race
         IN THIS game. They are 64 times stronger than dreadnoughts!

         When you're just starting out, you don't want to create ships.
         First worry about starting a colony and helping it grow. A
         suggestion is to create food droids then mining droids first.
         Then you can start to create what else you want. There are a
         lot of things you can produce such as: food robots, granaries,
         nuclear power-plants, and planet destroyers.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

         Well I like the graphics first off. The planets could have
         been drawn differently, but I'm sure that would have gotten
         tire-some since there are a total of 26 planets.

         I also like the point-and-click interface. Makes the game a
         lot easier to play. The idea for the game was very creative
         and, in my opinion, you couldn't add a whole lot to the game.

         The docs are well written. One thing I'd like to see is an
         AmigaGuide version of the docs.

         As for dislikes, I can't really think of any. Except for the
         fact you need to use a PAL interface. As for anything else,
         well my mind is drawing a blank.

PRODUCT NAME

        Pirates! GOLD CD-32


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

        A CD-32 strategy/action game of pirating and trading.  The game
takes place during the historical period of 1580-1700 in the Caribbean sea.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

        Name:           MicroProse
        Address:        The Ridge
                        Chipping Sodbury

        Telephone:      0454 329510


LIST PRICE

        I paid $44.95 (US).
        I do not know the list price of the product.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE

                A CD-32.

        SOFTWARE

           None.


COPY PROTECTION

           None!

MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        Commodore CD-32.


INSTALLATION

        No installation....  Just insert the disc into the CD-ROM drive, and
the game immediate loads.


REVIEW

        After owning a CD-32 for a few days, I decided that it was time to
buy another piece of software... for no man can live on Pinball Fantasies
alone.  Going to my almost local Amiga store, I found out that Liberation
(which was my first choice) was sold out.  Then I saw that they had Pirates!
GOLD.  Immediately, memories of the original "Pirates!" on the 64 and on the
Amiga went past my glazed eyes.  I Immediately bought it, and I went home as
fast as the speed limit allowed me and slid the disc into my CD-32.


BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE GAME

        For those of you who are not familiar with this game, here is a short
summary of what is about.  You are a pirate (of course).  The object of this
game is to retire with high social standing, having amassed a large
fortune.  How do you do this?  To acquire wealth, you sack towns and other
ships, and search for buried treasure.  To acquire social standing, you play
the game of politics with the governments in the game (England, France,
Holland, and Spain).  This might involve getting married to a governor's
daughter, doing missions for the government, and attacking that government's
enemies.


GAME CONTROLS

        Game controls in most place are very easy to get used to, and are
actually much easier than in the original game on the Amiga.  I think the
game makes effective use of the control without assigning ALL the buttons to
have individual functions.  Pirates! Gold duplicate most buttons' functions;
for example, the LEFT button on CD-32 control is the same as the RIGHT
button.  Control in combat has been reduced to three buttons for Parry,
Thrust, and Slash, plus the direction button.  This setup is much better
than the original Pirates! controls.


GAMEPLAY

        This game plays almost like PIRATES! for the Amiga.  The four skill
levels and four and six historical time periods still exist, giving the game
a varied feel.  Even at the same skill level and time period, enough random
events happen to make it feel different.

        Sword combat is still the way I've always liked it:  a button press,
a delay, and then a swing happens.  This is a very slow, almost
choreographed combat feel.  Ship-to-ship combat and ship-to-fort combat is
still set up so whoever has the wind and the guns has the advantage.  The
game interface, when not doing any combat specific activity, is simple:  move
your cursor over an item and highlight it.  It's very easy to get used to in
most incidents (see LIKES AND DISLIKES).


DOCUMENTATION

        Well at first I said to myself, "Great -- a 47-page document.  This
might mean it will have detail."  Nope:  it is 25 pages in English and the
rest of the manual is in German.  The manual's information is very limited.
It is enough to inform the beginner about the game, but not enough to
understand what is truly happening in the background of the game.  If you can
read the original Pirates! manual, I recommend it, for it gives much more
information on the game itself.

        But what I truly dislike about the manual is it is glued onto the
CD's box.  So to read the manual, you must have the CD box around.  I hope no
other CD-32 manufacturers do this practice -- it is just plain stupid.


LIKES

        What I like about this game is that the music and sound is very
good.  It gives the game a real "pirate feel."  The music does not interfere
with the sound effects but actually enhances it.  Way to go, MicroProse!

        I like that the CD version has nothing cut out from the computer
game.  I was afraid that the combat would change to more of a "slam the
joypad buttons as fast you can" type combat, but that fortunately did not
happen.  Anything that was in the computer game is still in this game.

        Once the game is loaded up, disc access is almost unnoticeable, music
changes quickly, and information is loaded at a fast rate, making for very
smooth and enjoyable gameplay.


DISLIKES:  ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT ALWAYS...

        Some of the graphics have been slightly degraded from the original
Amiga version.  In some places they are (*GASP*) dithered!  I wished they
would take some of the pictures from the original Amiga game and combine
them to make an almost perfect version of Pirates! GOLD.

        Another thing that annoys me is that you have to walk your character
in a town.  In the original Pirates! you could just pick from a pop up menu.
But now with the "advance" of technology, you have to control your character
and walk him to the location.  Making a quick stop at a town is now a long,
boring walk.

        THERE IS NO MAP OUTSIDE OF THE GAME!!!!  The map of the Caribbean
sea is inside of the game.  While that guarantees that you will never lose
the map, it also ensures you that it is will take you forever to find a spot
on that map.  For myself it would be much faster to look up the location on a
real (paper) map.

        Another complaint, not a limitation of Pirates! GOLD in itself, is
that you can have only one saved game in CD-32 Flash Memory.  This save takes
up 78% of flash memory; so if you know that a friend is coming over to play
Pinball Fantasies, MAKE SURE YOU LOCK THAT SAVE FILE IN FLASH MEMORY.  I
already have had my Pirates! GOLD save file erased once and I will never let
it happen again....


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        It is natural to compare this game to Pirates! for the Amiga.
Pirates!  GOLD CD-32 has better sound most of the time, better interface,
better music, and a little better outside graphics.  Pirates! shines with its
better graphics overall.


BUGS

        Wow, no bugs that I can find.  I am in deep shock:  this is not the
MicroProse that I have known and loved. :-)


VENDOR SUPPORT

        I have not called up the vendor for any reason.  I have not had any
problems yet.


CONCLUSIONS

        Overall, I really like this version of Pirates!.  If you already own
the original Pirates! and just bought a CD-32 and are considering it, I would
say think a little more about it.  But for those people who have never
played one of the mind numbing versions of Pirates!, then this game should
be on your list, for this is one of MicroProse best game series and ranks up
there with Civilization.

        My rating is 4 longswords and 1 rapier out of 5 longswords.  (Four
and a half stars out of five.)

                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 · Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

 · The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software, online.

 · Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

 · Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES.

 · 35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

 · No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

 · Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

 · Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

 · Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

 · FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
 · Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  

 · Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

 · The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
 · Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
 · All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

 · Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

 · And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

%%                    BIX - Byte Information Exchange                    %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and en-
thusiasts.  While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is 
the place for knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  
You're likely to find many others in similar situations who can offer 
advice, give technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.

BIX is divided into areas called conferences, each devoted to a 
particular area of interest.  They range from algorithms to windows,
from writers to Amiga.  Conferences are categorized into groups,
usually referred to as exchanges, so that you can browse through
whatever groups interest you and see a list of the conferences it 
contains.

                  These are some of the exchanges on BIX:

amiga.exchange - the place for Amiga developers and enthusiasts
byte - the full text of each issue of BYTE magazine; source code too 
e.and.l - Entertainment and Leisure; music, pets, games, more
ibm.exchange - everything from OS/2 to PC clones
mac.exchange -  Mac news, support, software, advice
professionals - consultants, engineers, financiers gather here
programmers - some of the best brains in the business!
wix - the Information Exchange for Windows; Windows Magazine online
writers.ex - the professional and amateur writer's exchange


                       *** FULL INTERNET ACCESS! ***

BIX also features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription. 


                      ==============================
                      Rates and Connect Information:
                      ==============================

different ways to connect:

There is no surcharge for up to 10mb of Internet mail per month (sent

thereafter.

                20/20 PLAN OPTION (for USA-48 users only):

Volume users can choose the 20/20 Advantage Plan, which is $20 per month

in addition to the $13 monthly fee.  


                           INTERNATIONAL USERS:

If you wish to connect internationally through Tymnet or SprintNet, 
please contact your local PTT.  BIX accepts prepaid international calls,
direct dial, or telnet connections.  In order to make a "collect" (not 
prepaid) call to BIX, your account must be verified before the charges 
are accepted.  When you complete the registration, we'll mail you a BIX
Membership Agreement by regular US Mail.  Whe you receive it, sign it 
and return it to us by mail.  When we receive it here, we'll authorize
your account to make reverse charged calls.

If you want to access BIX right away, contact your local PTT to set up a 
prepaid account.  You'll pay your local carrier for your calls to BIX in
advance, so there's no waiting period or verfication needed. Or, connect 
at BIX via telnet to x25.bix.com.

SprintNet international calls from most locations are $24 an hour.
Tymnet international charges vary, but are generally between $20-$30 an hour.

  It's unconfirmed at the moment, but there was a story in the Wall Street
  Journal dated January 19, 1994 stating that a company called Sage
  Enterprises was going to buy a company called CBM.  We're currently
  trying to determine if this is in fact the CBM you and I are so fond of.
  Stay tuned for futher details...

From PC Magazine, dated January 25, 1994:


                     CLIENT/SERVER IS LIKE TEENAGE SEX

                · It's on everyone's mind all the time.
                · Everyone is talking about it all the time.
                · Everyone thinks everyone is doing it.
                · Almost no one is really doing it.
                · The few who are doing it are (a) doing it poorly,
                  (b) sure it will be better next time, (c) not
                  practicing it safely.
                · Everyone is bragging about their successes all
                  the time, although very few have actually had
                  any successes.

New users can call and get ANY copy of Amiga Report.  These are considered
"free" downloads, they do not count against any file ratio.  The latest issue
of Amiga Reports can be Freq'ed (FileREQusted) from here as "AR.LHA", as "AR"
or as ARxxx.LHA where xxx is the issue number.  Freq's are valid at ANY time.

For users interested in reading AR, but who do not have access to AmigaGuide,
you can freq ARBUL and get the AR in bulletin form.  This service is provided
for persons who do not have Amigaguide (such as IBM users).  Please note that
any pictures distributed with the "regular" Amiga Reports archive will NOT be
sent with this freq.  This file is not available for dial-in users, but you
can read bulletin #5 with your capture buffer open and get the same file.
