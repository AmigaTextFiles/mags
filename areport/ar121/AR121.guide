    ----------------------


Egad.  You take a week off and stuff starts to pile up.  Honest, I had no
idea this week's issue would end up so big!  Yikes.  It's the largest one
yet.  I've been trying to keep the size under 200K, but this time I just
couldn't do anything about it, not and keep information current.  I left
out most non-Amiga news this week, and didn't run any Usenet Reviews.  And
we're still pushing 225K.

The move went smoothly, and there is a new local Amiga Report distribtution
site, Omaha AmigaNet (check the Where To Find section for details).  Many
thanks to Sysop Andy Wasserman for volunteering his system as a support
site!

There will be no A.M.I.G.A. article this week from Chad Freeman.  At last
report, he was chasing his computer around the yard as it attempted to cut
the grass.  Either that or his fan was producing enough thrust to launch a
747 into orbit, I'm not sure which.  He hopes to have the thing tied down
in time for next week's issue.  Meanwhile, if you have some heavy-duty
tethering wire, you might want to send some his way.

That's it for this week.  Enjoy!

AMIGA HAM ECHO ANNOUNCED


Mario Bonelli, the moderator of FidoNet's AMIGA_CDROM is starting another
echo called AMIGA_HAM. Chatting about anything to do with HAM radio and 
the Amiga. Helping amatuer operators, future operators, or those who just
have an interest.

The echo is not on the backbone yet, but if you wish to join (being placed
on the backbone requires a certain amount of nodes to carry this echo),
please send a Netmail message to:

INOVATRONICS RELEASES CANDO UPGRADE v2.5


CanDo 2.5, INOVATronics' popular multimedia authoring system software,
has added exciting new features which not only utilize the capabilties of
the new Amigas, but allow you to make more impressive applications even
more easily!
  
Some of these enhancements include:
  
   *  AGA Graphics
   *  Stereo Music Files
   *  ASL Commodore Requesters
  
New Main Panel
  
The main panel has been cleaned up and reorganized. The XtraTools menu and
icon have been removed and replaced with a list on the main panel. This makes
it easier to find and use these tools.
  
New Window Editor with AGA Graphic Support
  
The new Window Editor is more clearly laid out. The new "Open the Window
onto..." section allows you to select the screen. You can have your window
open on any "Public" screen.
  
The "Available modes..." button on the Window Editor brings up a requester
allowing your to select from the modes available on your computer. This
requester is similar to your "Screen Mode" preference setting. This method
insures both the greatest possible compatibility with future Amiga
enhancements and your application's ability to run on Amigas with different
capacities.
  
Support for Music Files
  
You can now play stereo music files. You have full control over tempo and
volume. The new InovaMusic.library supports StarTracker, SoundTracker,
NoiseTracker, ProTracker, MED, OctaMED, Oktalyzer, and 15 instrument
Soundtracker music files!
  
Expanded Requester Support
  
CanDo now uses the Commodore supplied ASL File Requester which has many
expanded features such as Save Mode (which allows the user to create
directories), Multi-Select, Filter Drawers, Only Drawers, File Patterns, and
more. These features not only give you greater programming control, but
provide the users of your application a standard, powerful means of selecting
Files and Directories.
  
We even added support for Commodore's "Easy Requesters." These allow you to
prompt the user with a question, have as many buttons as you need or possible
responses, and have the result returned in a function call. This means you no
longer have to setup a SubDeck to ask simple questions.
   
New SuperMover XtraTool
  
This Tool allows you to easily move groups of objects in a single step. You
no longer have to Edit each object individually and attempt to move it at the
same distance as other objects.
  
Full Font Support
  
We now fully support Compugraphic and Color fonts.
  
Command Expansion in the Script Editor
  
You can define your own shortcut sequences to use in the Script Editor. For
example, you can define "wwd" to expand to "WorkWithDocument" when you press
Shift-Space following "wwd".
  
Layout EditorTool
  
Some of you may remember the Layout Editor Tool from ProPak. It is now
included with the released software. It allows you to flow text around
complicated shapes in the window.
  
Using the LayOut/Helper you can wrap text around complicated objects on your
window using a point and click editor. Set your margins, straight or
contoured, enter your text, and the Layout Tool will do the rest. It's as
easy as pie!
  
Amiga Guide Support
  
CanDo's Help system uses the new AmigaGuide help system. Furthermore, you can
even add AmigaGuide help files to your own applications!
  
CanDo 2.5 - Real Programming made Real Easy!
  
Version 2.5 demonstrates Inovatronics' dedication to continually enhancing
CanDo to make it the easiest, most powerful means of making real
applications. Don't get left behind! Order your upgrade today!
  
  
Limited time for no Shipping Charge!
  
If you order by September 30, 1993, the shipping is on us!
  
  
IMPORTANT NEW SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
  
CanDo now requires a Hard Drive, 2MB of RAM, andd 2.04 or later of the OS.
Furthermore, DeckBrowser is no longer included with CanDo. If you have any
questions in this regard, please call us Toll Free!
  
  
CanDo Version 2.5 Upgrade:
  
Upgrade from 2.0          $25.00
Upgrade from 1.6          $75.00
Upgrade previous to 1.6   $90.00
  
CanDo T-Shirt             $16.95

IOMEGA INTRODUCES BERNOULLI DRIVES FOR AMIGA


Iomega Corp. is now shipping two versions of its popular Bernoulli drive
designed for use with Commodore Amiga personal computers.
  
Called the Box 150, the unit is compatible with Commodore computers that are
SCSI (Small Computer System Interface)- capable. Iomega says the 150 megabyte
(MB) capacity of the Box makes it particularly suited for personal video
production.
  
The Box 150 Transportable is an external unit, while the Box 150 Insider
installs inside the Amiga chassis. The Transportable has a suggested retail
price of $1,225, while the Insider will carry a $1,099 price tag. Both models
include a read and write cache, which Iomega says make them up to three times
faster than competitive removable hard drive products.
  
The company says Iomega drives, which use removable cartridges for data
storage that can be removed from the drive and locked up or used in other
Bernoulli-equipped computers, can withstand up to 1,000 Gs of shock. "We
literally tossed a disk from a speeding car at 60 miles-per-hour onto a
concrete highway with 100 percent data survival," according to Paul Losee,
director of Iomega's channel development.
  
In addition to its Bernoulli product line, Iomega also markets minicartridge
tape drives that use both QIC-80 and Irwin-formatted tapes, and a Floptical
drive which used the company's proprietary second generation holographic
technology to read and write data.

                    NEW MIRROR OF AMINET IN CALIFORNIA

Walnut Creek CDROM, makers of the Aminet CDROM, have installed a mirror of
the Aminet archive on their ftp site wcarchive.cdrom.com.  This mirror
contains the entire Aminet archive and is updated every four hours so it
will never be stale.  Uploads made to our mirror will automatically be
included in the main Aminet archive and all the other mirrors.  Please
ftp to wcarchive.cdrom.com and have a look.

If you have any comments about the mirror please address them to
stark@wcarchive.cdrom.com.  Also, since part of our goal is to make
the production of the Aminet CDROM more efficient thereby improving
its quality, we intend at some point to begin running the mirror with
CDROM-like names.  This means that the names would be slightly different
in some cases from the names at the other Aminet sites.  Please also
write to stark@wcarchive.cdrom.com if you have comments about this plan.

Note: Dan Zerkle has made the good suggestion that we set up parallel
      directory structures, one with the aminet names and the other
      with the CDROM names.  How's that for a solution?

RIP SCRIP 'PAINT' PROGRAM AVAILABLE (DEMO)


An exciting new product for telecommunications MIGHT be available 
relatively soon.

This is the RIP scrip language, by TeleGrafix Corporation. Currently
a Canadian is wanting to bring this to Amiga systems. Available to sysops
and the end user as a RIP scrip paint program (for those of you who have
seen Terminus, RIP graghics should be suported in a future version).

RIPscrip is a text based script language for displaying on-line graphics. 
It is a very efficient language in which graphics and the like are compressed
and can be transmitted faster to the end user. A user can "point and click",
selecting whatever commands available on a BBS supporting RIP graphics.
The nice thing about the RIP scrip language is that it is an open protocol
which may be used on a variety of platforms.

Mike Nelson wishes to bring this RIP "paint" program to the Amiga community,
and he needs your help. To buy the development tools he needs $300.00. He 
has provided a "demo" of his future program, which can be found on many BBSes 
(It is currently on In The MeanTime, under the name of RIPGRAF.LHA and can 
either be downloaded on the first call or it may be File REQuested), GEnie, 
Delphi, and Portal, and needs at least 15 people to register to come up with 
the $300.00.

SOFT-LOGIK TRANSLATES PROFESSIONAL PAGE DOCUMENT FORMAT


St. Louis, Missouri (August 10, 1993)  Soft-Logik Publishing Corporation
today announced a change to the feature set of the upcoming PageStream
3.0, a completely new version of the #1 Amiga desktop publishing
program. PageStream 3.0 will have the ability to load Professional Page
documents directly. It will also be able to load PageStream2 documents
and the new IFF DOC format documents.

"Document formats have been dark and secret for too long," said Deron
Kazmaier, the president of Soft-Logik Publishing. "Customers want the
freedom to move their documents between programs, and we are going to
give them that freedom."

For the first time, users of Gold Disk's Professional Page desktop
publishing program will be able to make the transition to PageStream
painlessly. They have been able to use their fonts with PageStream since
version 2.0, and Soft-Logik added the ability to load and edit
Professional Draw illustrations in 1992. Adding support for another
program's documents is an industry first and simplifies switching from
Professional Page to PageStream.

Converting a Professional Page document for use in PageStream is a
simple task. Just choose the Open command from the Project menu and
don't worry if it is a PageStream or Professional Page file. The
Professional Page document conversion module is included free of charge
with PageStream 3.0.

PageStream 3.0 will be available in early fall for $395. Customers who
purchase a full copy of PageStream 2.2 after March 15, 1993 are eligible
for a free upgrade to version 3.0 by mailing their registration card,
proof of purchase and $5 for shipping and handling, to Soft-Logik.
Previous purchasers can upgrade for $125 if they own PageStream 2.0 or
higher, or for only $95 if they own PageStream 2 and HotLinks Editions.

Professional Page users can upgrade to PageStream 2.2 now for only $175
plus shipping and handling, and receive a free upgrade to PageStream 3.0
when it's released.

PageStream 3.0 will change the way you think about publishing.

CALL FOR HELP

SOFT-LOGIK NEEDS PROFESSIONAL PAGE DOCUMENT FILES FOR TESTING!

PageStream 3.0 will have the ability to open Professional Page documents
and save them in PageStream 3's IFF DOC format. To ensure that this
feature works with real-world files, we need ProPage documents to test.
We want it to work flawlessly to make your conversion to PageStream3 as
easy as possible.

While we hope to make it translate 100% of every document correctly, we
cannot guarantee this because the Professional Page document format is
not publicly available. We believe that we have successfully documented
every aspect of the ProPage document format, but we can only verify this
through extensive testing. By testing your files now, we can ensure that
this feature will work properly for you when PageStream 3.0 is released.

To have your ProPage 3 or 4 documents tested with PageStream 3.0, mail
them to:

Soft-Logik Publishing Corporation
Test my Documents!
11131F South Towne Square
St. Louis, MO  63123

Note: We will keep your document files confidential and will use them
only for testing. Nobody outside of our programming and testing staff
will see your files.

SIGGRAPH '93

ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA -- The SIGGRAPH Show was full of surprises from unusual
art to actual virtual reality rides for show goers. Much emphasis was made
on kids, supercomputers, art, and employment opportunities as well.

Games, entertainment, and education were the themes of the show. Trip
Hawkins, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of 3DO, and chairman of
computer game maker Electronic Arts, was the keynote speaker. Childcare was
offered at the show, but many show goes had their children with them as many
of the booths and exhibits featured games or hands-on activities for children
and adults. An entire portion of the show floor was given to Sigkids, an
exhibit of hands-on computer activities by and for elementary age children.

But many of the adults were acting like children at play in virtual reality
exhibits from Silicon Graphics Incorporated (SGI), Evans and Sutherland,
and in an area where interactive art exhibits were displayed. The SGI
exhibit was obviously inspired by the movie Jurassic Park and show goers
where waiting over an hour in winding Disneyland-like lines to enter a giant
box and get a chance to climb into a saddled Teradactyl. Of the groups who
entered the box only three were allowed to actually ride, but the watchers
could see the virtual scene as well.

Evens and Sutherland offered a chance to ride a virtual hang-glider through
a crowded city-scape. Two hang-glider simulations were running and show
goers were helped into body-length slings that hung them suspended in front
of a viewing screen. Their faces were then situation in virtual space. They
controlled their movement through the space via a hang-glider bar grasped
with both hands. Speakers on each side of their heads provided the sound.
Lines were long to ride and riders told Newsbytes the sensation of hang-
gliding was very real despite the comic book appearance of the city
landscape through which they flew.

In an area featuring electronic art, show goers could stop at an elec-
tronic confessional to confess their sins. Based on the confessions of the
Catholic church, the automated religion kiosk, called "Catholic Turing Test"
by Gregory P. Garvey of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, was a thin, shiny, black
plastic structure with a red neon cross at the top and a red kneeling bench
in front. Only large enough for one, an Apple Macintosh SE and Hypercard
were used to create the confessional program which started by asking how
long it had been since you'd been to confession and gave you the option of
typing in a number and choosing either days, weeks, months, or years. Users
selected sins from a menu and were told at the end of the confession what
type of sins they were and how many "Hail Marys" were needed for penance.

Next door was a group of tables where show goers who sat down to relax were
eventually bumped and mumbled at by what appeared to be a giant bowling
ball. Called "Adelbrecht" by Momevideo, Amsterdam, Netherlands designer
Martin Spanjaard, the mobile robot moved around under its own power, bumping
into chairs and people, and changing direction while making beeping and
whirring noises, and mumbling unintelligible speech to show goers.

The "Neuro Baby" was a monitor in a crib that displayed a pink, cartoonish,
buggy-eyed "baby" face that bounced around on the screen and responded to
attendees who bent down to speak into a microphone by the crib. Monitors
near the crib showed people who were waiting in line the responses of the
baby. The baby laughed, cried, said "Hi," rolled its eyes, and even got red-
faced mad when Newsbytes laughed at it. Lines were long to talk to the baby
and it was surprising how many people simply yelled into the microphone.
Naoko Tosa of Ogikubo Suginami-Ku, Tokyo said the voice analysis was
performed by a neural network emulator that converted voice input into
"emotional" patterns based on the wave patterns to which the computer had
been "taught" to respond. A Fujitsu FM Towns multimedia personal computer
was used for the voice analysis, another FM Towns for voice generation, and
a SGI Iris 4D was used to generate the image of the baby.

"The Flock," by Ken Rinaldo and Mark Grossman of San Francisco, California,
was a room of robotic arms hanging from the ceiling and extending just a few
inches above the floor. The arms responded to the movement and voice
intonation of visitors. The arms were unusual as they were partially made
from the dried branches of vines so they appeared to be a strange mix of
organic and electronic material and looked like the limbs of live trees
reaching toward and moving away from visitors. The artists described the
arms as "cybernetic sound sculptures that exhibit behaviors found in natural
groups such as birds, fish, and bats." Acoustic, kinetic, and infrared
sensors on the arms detected sounds and movements and responded. The exhibit
had visitors talking, waving their hands, and walking around these strange
arms. One of the artists was seen to yell and pull at a visitor saying,
"Don't let it touch you" and explained that the arms are fragile and could
be broken by contact. However it was difficult with the unexpected movements
of the long, jointed arms to stay out of the way.

Much talk among show goers concerned supercomputers and virtual reality and
the San Diego Supercomputer Center was represented at the show. The use of
supercomputers for complex techniques such as reconstructing the shape of a
fetus from ultrasound measurements or visualization of global climate
research was emphasized by the San Diego group.

Interactivity was emphasized, not only between people and computers, but
between show attendees. Several locations had tables and comfortable
seating, an international center was available, and even a jobs and message
center was near the show floor. The jobs board took up two sides of the
large four-sized cubical structure that housed it and every inch of space
was filled with jobs postings. Newsbytes was curious to see if the jobs
postings were for positions wanted, but the jobs were all help wanted ads
for graphics artists, designers, and programmers who had graphics experience
from large companies such as Avid and Microsoft as well as from small
companies.

Attendance figures were not available by press time, but the show took up
most of the huge Anaheim Convention Center and it was crowded. SIGGRAPH runs
until Friday in Anaheim. SIGGRAPH '94 has been announced by for July 24-29
at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida.

MORE FRED FISH DISKS ON PORTAL!


                        FISH UP TO #900 NOW ONLINE!
                    That's NINE HUNDRED DISKS, kids :)


Fish Disks #891-900 arrived in our library today. For those of you
who are new here, "go amigafish" takes you to the Amiga Zone's
separate Fred Fish Disk library. You will find ALL NINE HUNDRED
Fish disks there, each in its own collection. Not some of them.
Not just new-ish disks.

ALL. OF. THEM. ALL. NINE. HUNDRED. DISKS.

We have a LOT of disk space here. Unlike some other services whose
names I won't name, we don't have to delete files every 3 minutes
just so there's room for new uploads. WE HAVE A *LOT* OF DISK
SPACE HERE :) so we can keep the entire Fred Fish library online,
24 hours a day, 365 days a year, no matter HOW large that library
grows in the future. That's our promise to you and you can
count on it. Take it to the bank. Don't worry be happy :-)))

"Go amigafish" from any command prompt anywhere on Portal takes
you to the Amiga Zone Fish library.

"Go amigafish;0" to get to the area where the mass contents files
and indexes and indexing programs and their databases (such as
Aquarium and KingFisher and etc.) are kept.

"go amigafish;nnn" where nnn is any number from 1 to 900 to go
to a particular disk instantly.

"go amigafish;p t e" to go to the newest page of disks.

And now, I need your help. Our online disks #881-890 don't have
text versions of the "contents" files. I can't find Fred Fish's
announcement about those ten disks (the ten before the newest
ten that arrived today) anywhere.

If you have the "contents" file that Fred releases, covering
disks #881 through 890, please email it to "harv" here on Portal
so I can put it in the library and split it up and put each of those
ten disks' contents text with their collections.

UUxT 2.1 AVAILABLE FOR FTP


TITLE
         UUxT

VERSION
         2.1

AUTHOR
         Asher Feldman, asher@shell.portal.com  or  Wizard0@cup.portal.com

DESCRIPTION
         UUxT is the ultimate uuencode/decode utility for the Amiga.
         Uuencoding is the process of converting a binary file into ASCII,
         so that it may be transmitted over a text, or "mail only" network
         such as the Usenet.  Many files are posted to the Usenet daily,
         but the must be uudecoded before you can use them.  UUxT
         makes the task of uuencoding and decoding simple, with its
         amiga style command interface.  UUxT now has an Intuition front
         end (UUxT-GUI) making all UU tasks simpler for beginers.
         You can even LhA and uuencode multiple files in a single step.
         (And vice-versa)  (LhA is a popular compression program/format
         that allows you to compress and archive multiple files)  Also, UUxT
         will decode uuencoded files with multiple mail headers and other
         garbage in them.  So you can download multiple part
         archives off the Usenet, and decode them without
         editing out all the headers.  UUxT also allows you to decode
         multi-part archives without joining all the parts together
         first.

NEW FEATURES

         - Added UUxT-GUI, a point and click workbench front end for
           UUxT, making UU tasks even easier. (See UUxT-GUI.DOC for
           more information.)

         - Added Wildcard support.

         - Only known enforcer hit removed.

         - Fixed decoding of split files bug.

         - Fixed encode bug when not connected to a console.

         - More reliable decoding.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
         LhA by Stefan Boberg is required to use the LhA specific
         functions.  UUxT-GUI requires reqtools.library V38 which
         is Copyright 1991/1992 Nico Frangois.  Reqtools.library is
         included.  UUxT and UUxT-GUI work under all amigados revision.

AVAILABILITY

AmiTCP/IP - TCP/IP PROTOCOL STACK FOR AMIGA RELEASE 2.0


TITLE

        AmiTCP/IP - TCP/IP protocol stack for Amiga

VERSION

        Release 2.0

AUTHORS

        The AmiTCP/IP Programming Project Group in Helsinki University
        of Technology, referred further on as AmiTCP/IP Group:

        Tomi Ollila     <Tomi.Ollila@cs.hut.fi>
        Pekka Pessi     <Pekka.Pessi@hut.fi>
        Markus Peuhkuri <Markus.Peuhkuri@hut.fi>
        Jarno Rajahalme <Jarno.Rajahalme@hut.fi>

        E-mail address for the group: amitcp-group@hut.fi

DESCRIPTION

        AmiTCP/IP is the first publicly available TCP/IP protocol stack
        for the SANA-II interface. AmiTCP/IP provides an application level
        socket interface to the Internet protocol suite as an Amiga shared
        library.

        The Internet protocols, commonly known as TCP/IP, consist of user
        level protocols TCP and UDP and IP as the network level protocol.
        There is a wide variety of different network applications and
        services using TCP/IP protocols. The BSD compatible socket
        interface to Internet protocols makes it possible to port existing
        applications with minor modifications.

        AmiTCP/IP connects to the network via SANA-II compatible device
        drivers. SANA-II is a hardware and protocol independent network
        adapter interface specification published by Commodore. Several
        network adapter manufactures have made available SANA-II device
        drivers for their hardware. Currently there are SANA-II drivers
        available at least for Ethernet, Arcnet and serial line
        interfaces. You can connect to Internet with Ethernet LAN, or via
        modem line with Serial line IP (SLIP) optionally with compressed
        headers (CSLIP).

        A typical application is to use (C)SLIP to connect univeristy and
        have multitasking connection:  you can read mails and news,
        transfer files and use IRC at the same time over one modem line.

FEATURES

        1. Standard SANA-II network device driver interface.
        2. BSD-compatible socket interface as a Amiga shared library.
        3. ARexx port for configuration and statistics.
        4. Over 200 pages of documentation including:
                - Installation and configuration
                - ARexx port commands
                - Programmer's manual based on the BSD IPC manual. This
                  is a fairly complete tutorial for developing powerful
                  client/server applications
                - Internal description of the implementation
                - Utility and API function reference guide in AutoDoc form.
        5. Basic applications with source included.
        6. Based on the BSD Net/2 release.
        7. Full source code included.

        While all Internet services and applications (telnet, ftp, news,
        mail) can be accessed with AmiTCP/IP, many applications are still
        under development by us and others. Current release of the AmiTCP/IP
        contains following applications:

        * Telnet - standard program to log on other systems **
        * Ftp - standard program to transfer files between systems **
        * Napsaterm - a VT100 terminal emulator using remote login
          protocol
        * TCP - networking support for GNU Emacs. With TCP you can use any
          elisp-based networking applications (gnus, gopher, irchat etc.)
        * LetNet - a simple filter for connecting to TCP based
          services. Suitable for scripts and testing
        * inetd - Internet super server, which starts other services
          when needed and provides some simple services by itself
        * FingerD - a Finger daemon which prints user information or
          a banner file
        * QWriter - an application to test and benchmark network

        Following network utilities are also available:

        * arp - tool to handle ARP hardware address translation tables
        * ifconfig - tool to control network interface parameters
        * netstat - a ARexx script to get statistical information
          from networking
        * ping - utility to test network connectivity
        * route - tool to display and manipulate routing tables
        * online/offline - utilities to control SANA-II device drivers

        ** = ported by Mark Tomlinson <mark@garden.equinox.gen.nz>
             and Goeff McCaughan <geoff@equinox.gen.nz>

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        AmiTCP/IP can be run from floppy and with one megabyte of memory,
        but as usual, hard disk and more memory makes your life easier.

        Amiga OS release 2.04 or newer is required.

        SANA-II device driver is needed for your network adapter. A test
        device driver, agnet.device, is included with sources. Also the
        freely distributable Commodore A2060 (Arcnet), A2065 (Ethernet),
        SLIP and CSLIP drivers are included. SLIP and CSLIP drivers
        contains bug fixes made by Olaf Seibert.

        LHA utility is required to unarchive distribution archives.

        Most of the source files has been compiled with GNU C 2.3 and SAS C
        6.3. Some utilities and libraries are compiled only with SAS C 6.3.
        However, only the executable files compiled with SAS C are tested.
        Also, the DICE C support is untested.

AMIGA ELM v2.0 AVAILABLE FOR FTP


TITLE

     Amiga Elm

VERSION

     2

AUTHOR

     Andreas M. Kirchwitz
     E-Mail: elm-fan@zikzak.in-berlin.de

DESCRIPTION

     AmigaElm is an "Electronic Mail Reader" which allows you to read and
     write mail. Normally you'll need a properly installed UUCP package
     (eg, AmigaUUCP Plus or Dillon UUCP) to receive and send mails but
     AmigaElm is highly configurable so that you can take a mail-folder
     from a UNIX box, answer the mail and send the answers back to the
     UNIX box.

     AmigaElm is easy to install and to use. The user interface is very
     intuitive and similar to the well-known UNIX-ELM. Beginners can
     control all basic functions with menus and some nice GadTools
     requesters (only with AmigaOS 2.0+). Usage with AmigaOS 1.3 is
     limited to keyboard control. Advanced users can use aliases,
     priorized message tagging, various filename-offers when saving
     messages and lots of options to configure AmigaElm to fit your
     needs. In a system with multiple users AmigaElm allows separate
     configuration files for each user.

     AmigaElm can be invoked in a special "terminal mode" (all input/output
     from/to console). This is useful for running AmigaElm in the current
     shell window or over a serial line (eg, with AUX-Handler).

     AmigaElm offers basic internal MIME (multimedia mail) functionality
     (eg, sending 8-bit-texts and binaries over 7-bit-lines) and supports
     "MetaMail" (a full-featured package for handling all kinds of MIME
     messages -- also available on AmiNet, see section "HOST NAME") and
     "ReqTools" library 2.x (reqtools.library is included).

NEW FEATURES

     Changes since version 1:

.../Message Bases/General Q&A, Announcements, and Help!/The Amiga is DEAD. Why
16026.3.575.2 Amiga declining?

Half of that is Compute's own damn fault for doing very LOUSY
distribution of their Amiga edition, not to mention screwing
up subscriptions for MANY folks who specifically asked for the
Amiga REsource edition. I think Compute's management is just
to blind to see that they slit their own wrists on this one (sorry
to mix those metaphors). If they had simply stopped screwing around
with 436 different versions of every monthy issue, and just made ONE
Compute version and distributed it everywhere.. well, who knows.

>Seems that the Commodore 64 section has more readers, because it will
>continue to be published.

Well who knows why. You'd think that in these days of intersteller
everything that a $100 "disposable" computer that's terribly
slow, has godawful monsterous disk drives, the world's worst
operating system (if you can even call it that).. I guess people
still buy the damn things. But hell, you can buy an Amiga 600
for just pocket change more than a 64 costs these days. Then again..
who knows it exsts?

And there's the rub... Commodore's top management who seems more
concerned about gold-platnig their tennis courts with their
multimillion dollar salaries (some of the highest paid computer
execs in the world work for Commodore, believe it or not),
insulating themselves from their stockholders, not advertising
the best damn personal computer ever made (and I'll argue all
the fine points of this debate with anyone who wants to step up
to bat with me :-) - well it was suggested long ago that
CBM's motto should be "Ready, Fire, Aim!" when it comes to
marketing their product. Still rings truer than ever.

>Can anybody tell me how can all this be possible? Specially with the new
>Amiga 600 selling for only $179? That is less than one half what a

See above.
Possible solutions:

1. Get rid of Irving Gould, C='s Chairman of the board, and his
   cronies.  See Mark Rifkin's "Stockholder" stuff in our Text library.

2. Hire an entire new board of folks who know how to market
   computers in the USA

3. Take that former top mgmt salary and hire engineers and
   reinvest the bucks in R&D

4. Advertise.

5. See #4. Lather, Rinse, Repeat.

6. Get the machine some killer well known big name applications.
   How often have you heard someone ask "But will it run [some big
   name Mac or MS-DOS app software]?" How many people bought
   clones or Macs because the Amiga's best word processors or
   spreadsheets, even if they CAN exchange files with other platforms,
   are completely unknown in the mass marketplace?

Lemme tell ya something.. I recently spent a month at a well-known
Amiga software house writing a manual for them. It was for a Mac
product. Hey, don't hit me, I needed the money. I used the product
while writing its docs, on a 20 Meg Mac Quadra 700 with
mongo hard drives. That machine would sell for about $8000.
When all is said and done, I would prefer to use an Amiga, selling
for a third or even a quarter of that, than that Mac. All the Mac
had going for it was its 24-bit display. Period. Quicktime is
a joke.  Multitasking is laughable on a Mac.  Hell, you can't even
open a shell window and type "dir" if you want to.

No thank you, keep the Mac. And keep the PC with its bloated
windowed operating systems pasted on top an early 80's DOS, that
take 4 or more Meg of RAM just to come up. IBM people get all
wet and gooey just to see icons. We Amiga people have the most
elegant operating system of ANY personal computer on the market.
What we need is a company to back it up and market the thing
in an intelligent way.

Who knows if Commodore can come to their senses. Irving Gould
has been quoted as making a sarcastic remark something along
the lines of "I wish someone would tell me how to sell computers
in the United States." Well after 8 years, it's crystal clear
he doesn't have a CLUE as to how to sell Amigas and it's long
past time he stepped aside, retired to the Banahams and his
gold plated tennis court and turned the reigns of the company
over to some fresh blood with good ideas and the talent
to implement them.

As far as Compute magazine's STUPID decision to can Amiga Resource,
they had THE BEST group of Amiga authors in the business writing
for them, and they did not even know it.

Olaf, I think it's because anyone buying their first computer has four
or five "expert" friends who say "oh, you've gotta buy an IBM
compatible." Not to mention the fact that tons of people just don't
KNOW the Amiga exists. You don't see them in Office Depot and Circuit
City like you do PCs and Macs, sigh/

I'm glad you liked Amiga Resource! I'm sorry to see it go as well. :-(

The Commodore 64 section has a TON of subscribers -- last I hear they
had more than half as many as AmigaWorld does! While Harv's right that
delivery problems had a lot to do with some people becoming frustrated
and dropping subs, the Gazette folks have had the same problems. But
the difference there is that Gazette is the ONLY remaining national
C64 publication in the U.S. Amiga folks had the alternatives of
AmigaWorld, a very good mag, and Amazing (mumble).

>Can anybody tell me how can all this be possible? Specially with the new

Commodore dropped the ball. They didn't advertise back when they had
the money to do so. They should have taken the cue from the Mac a
couple of years ago and touted the fact that the Amiga CAN read your
PC disks from work, and that there are applications that can read your
PC files. But they got overwhelmed by the DOS monster. The Tenex deal
is FANTASTIC, but who knows about it?

It's a rough time out there for the Amiga right now. I really hope to
see a rebound. If CD32 is successful in Europe, it may give Commodore
the cash it needs to climb back up. I really hope it happens.

Its more than that. A few years back, when the 500/2000/2500 pretty
much described the Commodore line of Amigas, the user base was screaming
for Commodore to improve the resolution and color of the Amiga
chip set (which, truth be told, had needed an upgrade since the day
it was released).

Commodore made the disingenous reply that there was no reason to upgrade
the line, since the 500 was selling well.

I could only reply that by the time sales are dropping, its too late.

Guess what? Sales are dropping.

Apple is using a plain old everyday PowerPC 601 chip in their first PowerPC
systems.  Neither it, nor any other announced PowerPC products have any
hardware emulation of the 680x0 instruction set.  Apple has announced that
PowerPC systems will run Mac binaries, but that's done via a soft 680x0
emulator.  With enough of the Mac OS routines recoded as native PowerPC
routines, the performance should be decent.  Don't compare it to a PClone
emulator.  A good portion of the slowdown in PClone emulators isn't based
on the need to emulate an 80x86 processor, but rather, the need to emulate
the PC's hardware registers at the bit level.  Since nothing in the Mac
OS should require any such bit-level emulation (in theory -- I'm sure Jim
Drew's gang could tell something about this in practice), Mac program
should run at full Mac II speed, at least, on PowerPCs.

However, I think it is only fair to point out that the 
instruction set of the PowerPC 601 is quite well suited to 
running emulations of other processors. It has the ability
to think big-endian or little-endian, and (I am led to
believe) has a wide range of bit manipulation instuctions.

I would hazzard to say that emulation of other processors
was a strong design consideration.

I am told they have about 80% of the OS native 601
code. I suppose it depends a lot on _which_ 80% of the
OS is native. However, it is expected that the performance
will be similar to that of a 68040 Mac running at 25 Mhz,
while running the emulation on an 'average' application..
Again, sweeping statements, but you get the idea.

So is the "crew" thinking about porting things these days?
A 601 Amiga before mid-January would not only take a _lot_
of wind out of Apple's sails, it would surprise the whole
industry. And it's about time people had good reason to look
on the Amiga with a certain amount of awe, just like waaaay
back..

/// AMIGA REPORT AVAILABLE VIA THE WORLD WIDE WEB!
    ----------------------------------------------
    By Michael Witbrock
    (mjw@cs.cmu.ed witbrock@x25.bix.com)


Although AmigaGuide is still the best way to browse Amiga Report, the
magazine is  now also available in a form which may be more convenient for
people with direct Internet access.

Amiga Report is being converted weekly to a document readable via the World
Wide Web, allowing immediate access without the chore of dearchiving and
downloading to an Amiga.  Within a day (often less) of its release, each
Amiga Report starting from AR118 will be  converted into an HTML hyper-
document that behaves as similarly as possible to the AmigaGuide version,
and will be made available at this URL:

<a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/People/mjw/Computer/Amiga/OnlineMags.htm
l">
OnlineMags
</a>

For those who don't recognize that, a URL is a Uniform Resource Locator,
which specifies access method and location information for information
readable with WWW browsers such as NCSA mosaic. NCSA mosaic is a self
contained program running under the X window system, and is  available
for anonymous FTP from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in directory /Mosaic.

Even if you don't plan to read AmigaReport by this means, I strongly
recommend that you get a copy of NCSA mosaic and play with it. The
amount of information (in the form of pictures, sounds, text, and mpeg
movies) it makes easily available is astounding, and the program itself
is a marvel of good user interface design. I hope that someone will use
the recent attempts at PD TCP/IP networking solutions and port the
program to the Amiga.

Happy browsing!

/// NEWTEK UNVEILS "THE SCREAMER" AT A PARTY HELD NEAR SIGGRAPH...
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    A public message from Harv Laser


[crossposted to the LightWave and Video Toaster mailing lists]

NewTek held their SIGGRAPH party/product announcement tonite at the
Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park, CA (about 8 miles from the site
of SIGGRAPH at the Anaheim Convention Center).

Approx. 2000 people attended.  It was jammed.  Partygoers were allowed
to tour the Wax Museum at no charge, scarf down appetizers, guzzle down
all the free drinks they could grab with both hands, and then adjourned
to an outdoor area (actually I think it's part of the parking lot) where
a large screen projection system was set up.  Your reporter ended up
standing at the back of the crowd, due to bad planning; there were way
more people than there were chairs.

Then, in sequence, Kiki Stockhammer, Wil Wheaton, Paul Montgomery and
Tim Jenison introduced varous video segments, working up from the
usual Toaster promo tapes, through a video made by a skateboarding
guy, to a lovely and cute little 5 minute 3D-rendered animation called
"Robo Jr.", then into two new Todd Rundgren videos composed mainly
in LightWave but with other Toaster effects (the audience was mixed
on these - some people love Rundgren's stuff and others can't stand
it. I thought his new videos were incredibly impressive and I like
his tunes too... Rundgren was there along with his usual
entourage... well, what can I say. He's an "artiste.") Then some short
promos for Spielberg's new seaQuest tv series were shown.
Finally, Montgomery and Jenison took the stage again (all though the
evenings performances there were constant problems with the wireless
microphones going on and off.. someone in the crowd shouted out
"time you guys made an AUDIO Toaster!"), and introduced the last video
of the night which was very short and quick blast of numbers about
their new product, The Screamer. They then pulled a sheet off a
prototype Screamer on the stage and the camera zoomed in on it and
filled the large projection screen with its image.  From what I
could see, it's a floor-standing tower box, maybe 3 feet high, a foot
wide, and two feet deep, colored grayish silver and red, and one
side of it comes up from the bottom and twists at the top.  It was
quickly spirited away for press interviews and I couldn't get a picture
of it.. I'm sure the magazines will take care of that lack in short
order.

That was it.  No questions were taken. The thing was brought on, shown,
and hauled away in less than 2 minutes. Immediately, a new flyer
started to appear on tables all over the crowd, and I've typed in most
of it for you to peruse below.

Disclaimer: I am not employed by NewTek Inc. I own no stock in the company.
I don't even own a Toaster. They do throw a helluva good party though,
but they almost never plan for enough space to accomodate the ever-
increasing crowds that show up for their affairs. This party was
jam-packed and made quite an impression.  If you're part of the
NewTek cult, you would've enjoyed it immensely.

Begin quoted flyer (any typos or emissions are mine and are purely
due to fatigue :-) :

The introduction of NewTek's Video Toaster Screamer is about to cause
a revolution in the 3D industry.  Now, creating animation can take less
time than you ever imagined possible.  The Screamer 3D rendering engine
elevates the Video Toaster into one of the fastest 3D tools ever created.
High speed RISC processors drive the Toaster's built-in LightWave
animation system to deliver twice the 3D rendering power of a Cray I
supercomputer.

The Screamer is a breakthrough 3D rendering engine designed specifically
for NewTek's Emmy-award winning Video Toaster System.  The stunning
computing speed of the Screamer is a result of an innovative hardware
desgn based on multiple RISC processors. Four parallel MIPS R4400 RISC
processors allow the Screamer to deliver over 600 MIPS system performance.
By running each processor at 150 MHz with both internal and external
caches, the Screamer reaches an amazing 340 SPECMarks.

The Toaster Screamer system comes complete with NTSC video in and out and
takes full advantage of the Toaster's award winning LightWave 3D animation
system.  Already the most popular 3D animation system in the world, the
Video Toaster and LightWave have been credited with bringing 3D visual
effects to weekly television for the first time. With complex 3D effects
sequences in every episode, shows such as Babylon 5 and Steven
Spielverg's seaQuest DSV are setting new standards of excellence.

The Screamer differs from expensive dedicated 3D workstations in the same
way that the Video Toaster stands out among traditional video gear.
The introduction of the Screamer brings 3D rendering power that was
astronomically expensive to a stunning new price point.  At $9,995
the Toaster Screamer offers significantly more rendering power per
dollar than any other 3D system in the world.  The economics of
3D animation have just changed forever.

Specificatons:

Video Toaster Screamer:  $9995 (available 4th quarter '93)
An external rendering engine for the Video Toaster

Processors: Four parallel MIPS R4400 - 64 bit superpipelined RISC
processors

Clock Speed: 150 MHz

Memory: Internal Cache: 32K on each processor
Secondary Cache: Up to 8 MB
Program Memory: expandable to 1 Gigabyte

Requires Video Toaster Workstation

(then followed by the usual Toaster specifications which I'm not going
to type in here).

/// New "SPECTRUM" Board from GVP  AR InfoFile
    ------------------------------------------
    Information Provided by Chris Jones


EGS-28/24 SPECTRUM PRODUCT INFO  -- Preliminary Specs Subject to Change


DESCRIPTION

The EGS-28/24 Spectrum -- the second member of GVP's EGS family of graphics
boards -- is a high-performance, high-resolution, 24-bit graphics board that
will take any Amiga 2000, 3000, or 4000 beyond AGA!  Following the same
philosophy as the first member of the EGS family, the powerhouse EGS-110/24,
this entry level graphics board provides power and performance at an
affordable price.

The EGS-28/24 Spectrum is capable of displaying video resolutions (NTSC, PAL,
and SECAM) as well as workstation-like high resolutions like Next (1120x832).
It also adapts automatically to either a Zorro-II (15-bit A2000) or Zorro-III
(32-bit A3000/A4000) bus and supports Workbench 2.04, 2.1, and 3.0 to take
maximum advantage of its environment. ( Capable of supporting Commodore's RTG
graphics standard when it becomes available.)

For the ultimate in convenience and functionality, the EGS-28/24 Spectrum has
a built-in pass through for the native Amiga RGB display.  When working with
a native Amiga screen, the EGS-28/24 Spectrum simply passes the Amiga display
out to the monitor!  While others may claim to be a one-monitor solution,
there will always be incompatible software that requires the use of a second
monitor- _the_EGS-28/24_Spectrum_is_truly_a_one_monitor_solution__!

As if that weren't enough, our unique MultiGFX(tm) technology allows multiple
EGS-28/24 Spectrum boards to be installed in the same machine, and the device
libraries handle all of the necessary details. Multiple applications can be
running on multiple EGS-28/24 Spectrum boards, each visible on a separate
monitor simultaneously in stunning full 24-bit color at any resolution.  This
is a blessing for those who need to see a lot of different things all at the
same time.  For example, consider the 3D animator who needs to see a high-
resolution wireframe display of the scene being edited, an NTSC (or PAL)
color preview of the animation in progress, and a control panel screen with
all of the needed commands available at the click of a mouse!

The EGS-28/24 Spectrum system uses the new Enhanced Graphics System (EGS)
device libraries.  These device independent libraries allow high-resolution,
24-bit software to be written for ANY graphics board that supports these
libraries. To date, a number of graphics boards on the market already support
the EGS libraries, and all software written for those boards will run on the
EGS-28/24 Spectrum.  Likewise, any software written to support the EGS-28/24
Spectrum will run on any of the other display boards that support the EGS
libraries.  Programmers are no longer committed to a single graphics board;
by programming for the EGS system, programs can run _unmodified_ on any
display board that supports the libraries!

The EGS libraries were painstakingly checked and rechecked by programmers
around the world to make them as close as possible to existing Amiga graphics
calls, differing only when necessary to support new features.  This effort
was taken to make porting applications as easy as possible for programmers.
(Some function calls were make so identical that the only difference is the
addition of an E_ in front of the function name, with all parameters and
return values the same!)

The EGS libraries also provide some new and very useful additions to the
basic array of graphics programming features that native Amiga programmers
are used to, for example: Tear-Off menus, Menu gadgets, and more.

However, realizing that good software takes time, GVP has provided a
Workbench driver for the EGS-28/24 Spectrum.  This driver allows Workbench
to run on the EGS-28/24 Spectrum board in any supported resolution, with up
to 256 colors -- Workbench limits the color depth to 256 colors for itself
and Workbench-compliant software.  Any software that opens its display on
Workbench will automatically run on any EGS-28/24 Spectrum Workbench.  The
only restriction is that no direct Amiga Blitter operations be performed by
programs running on the EGS-28/24 Spectrum display, since the Amiga Blitter
operates on Chip RAM and the EGS-28/24 Spectrum has its own blitter that
operates on the display maintained entirely in its own DRAM. (By the way,
this means that ALL Chip RAM normally used by Workbench is free for other
use.)

It is also important to realize that the EGS display subsystem is entirely
separate from the normal Amiga display.  A two-monitor configuration allows
the EGS-28/24 Spectrum monitor to display a high-resolution display (from a
CAD system for example) on the EGS monitor and the native Amiga output
system to display something completely different, and even from a com-
pletely different program!  An interesting and extremely useful example
would be running a high-resolution paint program in the EGS display while a
video application (like the IV24(tm), the Video Toaster(tm), or
OpalVision(tm)) runs on the native Amiga display.  As pictures are frame-
grabbed and saved, an EGS Paint system can load them in for touchup, while
the video framegrabbing continues--maximum productivity and efficiency!

The EGS-28/24 Spectrum hardware and the EGS system software take the Amiga
platform beyond AGA and into the true-color world of high-end graphics
workstations.  The already installed base of A2000 and A3000 owners, and the
fresh new base of A4000 owners can leap past the limitations of AGA and enter
a new world of high-resolution, true-color, hardware-independent graphics.
Keep in mind that when writing applications for the EGS system, they are not
just for a single graphics board, they will run on any current and future
graphics boards that support the EGS system libraries!

             Developers interested in porting applications
             to the EGS system should contact GVP for
             an EGS Developer's Kit at

FEATURES AND BENEFITS

The EGS-28/24 Spectrum Hardware

FEATURE         BENEFITS

Zorro II /      The EGS-28/Spectrum takes full advantage of whatever Amiga it
Zorro II        is installed in. Installed in a ZorroII bus it uses a 16-bit
Autosensing     interface, and installed in a ZorroIII bus, it opens up to a
                full 32-bit interface for maximum speed and performance.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

option          any Amiga.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardware        The EGS-28/24 Spectrum has a built-in hardware blitter to
Blitter         rapidly move chunks of data from one area of memory to another.
                This makes the EGS-28/24 Spectrum the perfect tool for real-
                time animations and 24-bit paint applications.  Fills, brush
                pastes, region operations, image manipulation can all be
                performed by the blitter leaving the processor free to perform
                other work.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amiga RGB       Other graphics boards often require two monitors (one for the
Pass-Through    Amiga display and one for the custom graphics display), and
Single          some others like the Video Toaster(tm) require three monitors.
monitor         The EGS-28/24 Spectrum has special circuitry that takes the
technology      Amiga display as input and allows software control over whether
                the Amiga or the EGS screen is displayed.  It is truly a one-
                monitor solution.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MultiGFX(tm)    Other graphics boards often expect to be the only graphics
device sharing  board in the system, and if more than one is installed, the
technology      controlling software may become confused.  EGS' device sharing
                allows multiple EGS-28/24 Spectrum boards to function independ-
                ently while the libraries handle all of the work to keep things
                running smoothly.

                ing 4MB or more of 24-bit display memory often flicker because
                the graphics chip is not capable of displaying 4MB of data fast
                enough to be flicker-free. Other graphics boards may claim that
                the extra memory is used to keep multiple screens open at the
                same time. The EGS-28/24 Spectrum uses a smarter technique that
                swaps out non-visible display data to standard system RAM to
                conserve display memory for crisp, stunning displays. Adding
                memory beyond 2MB is inefficient and needlessly expensive.

Retargetable Graphics Libraries

FEATURES        BENEFITS

Fully           Programs written using the EGS libraries will run on ANY graphi

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Complete        All graphics applications in the EGS libraries are treated as
true-color,     24-bit, true-color applications, even if the display device
24-bit          can't support 24-bit. Editing and painting in 8-bit, 16-bit, or
environment     any other mode will still maintain the quality and clarity of a
                24-bit image!

dithering to    lication on an 8-bit screen would result in the 24-bit app-
current         lication failing to open. The EGS libraries automatically
color depth     dither the 24-bit display using extremely fast and accurate
                dithering algorithms to provide a crisp display and allow the
                24-bit application to continue working in 24-bit (ie. all 
                actions occur in 24-bit and are only displayed in 8bit).  If a
                24-bit screen is used later, all of the quality and clarity of
                the 24-bit application is preserved.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scalable        Gadgets, fonts, and all Graphics User Interface items are
GUI             completely scalable. If a smaller display is used, the appro-
                priate items get smaller. If a larger display is used, the
                appropriate items get larger.  All GUI aspects are completely

/// Amiga Tip of the Week
    ---------------------


Note from Robert Niles:

A while back I did an article on how to find files using the LIST command.
Well, we got a reply from amorsin@cs.vu.nl showing us a BETTER way.


From:   IN%"amorsin@cs.vu.nl"  "Morsink AW" 
To:     IN%"ROB_G@delphi.com"
CC:     
Subj:   Comments on AR1.11
 
 
Comments on: Tip of the Week, Amiga Report 1.11
-----------------------------------------------
 

Looking for files...
--------------------
 
Hi. In Amiga Report 1.11 (Sorry, I'm a bit behind...), Robert Niles'
Tip of the Week involved using "list" to find files on a disk. I wasn't
very impressed with his tip :) as there's a much better way... SEARCH.
WB 2.04+ search, that is (version 37.3 and up).
 
Instead of Robert's         "LIST DH0:(#?/#?AR10#?) [FILES]"
 
I have aliased "find" as "search [] file all". To stick with Robert's
example:
                            "find dh0: #?ar#?",
or, without the alias,      "search dh0: #?ar#? file all"
 
is a lot more effective, as "search all" checks all subdirectories. With
the "list" example, you'd have to edit and reissue the command for every
level of subdirectories...
 
If you're not sure on which drive/partition the file(s) you are looking
for is/are located, you can just insert more devices into your command:
 
                            "find dh2: dh1: dh0: #?ar#?"
 
---
Another approach: Use a cron to periodically list all files on all drives
or partitions to a file, e.g.:
 
"list dh2: dh1: dh0: sys: lformat "%F%S" all >dh0:FILES.all"
 
("%S" will get you the name of the file, "%F" its complete path. For other
 options, check the AmigaDOS Reference section in your system manual.)
 
Now you can alias "finda" (find all) as "search dh0:files.all [] nonum" for
truely carefree system-wide file tracking :). Robert's example would become:
 
                             "finda ar"
 
(The pattern matching is implicit as you're searching a file now.)
 
Depending on a whole lot of factors, either method may be faster :).
 
---
Oh, last but not least, I also have an alias for the old (1.3) search
functionality (searching a file for a particular instance of text):
 
"findc" (find contents) for "search [] all nonum quiet", e.g.
 
                             "findc dh0:AmigaReport Niles"
 
(AmigaReport could be either a file or a directory here.)
 
Due to the 'quiet' option, only the names of the files in which the text
was found are displayed. However, without 'quiet', search not only displays
the complete line in which the text occurred, but also every file it is
searching... that's why I prefer 'quiet' output :).
 
Phew... this got to be a little longer than I intended... all I meant to say
was "Using search is more effective", but just in case you decide to edit
this for inclusion in a future issue of AR, I decided to elaborate a bit.
 
Have a nice... Amiga!

/// The Emulation Examiner
    ----------------------
    By Jason Compton
    (jcompton@mlinknet.uucp)


  Or:  How to Amaze, Dazzle, and Taunt Users of Other Personal Computers



Before I begin, I have a few comments to make...

I'd first of all like to thank Robert Glover, editor of this magazine, for
printing the article that I just threw at him without any warning.  He's
given me a chance to broadcast the knowledge and experience and opinions
I've gathered with emulators to the general public, and I get to see my
name in print, too.  Thanks again.

Secondly, I just want to remind everyone that I would REALLY appreciate
any netmail on either emulators or my articles...it would be tough to write
this column without some sort of feedback...once again, my address is
jcompton@mlinknet.uucp.

Finally, I'd specifically like to know if anyone can guide me to either
either an Apple II+ emulator (I once had the C code to it, but it didn't
compile very well...) or an Atari ST emulator that works.  Thanks in
advance.

Now, on with the emulating...in this issue, I'd like to tackle one of the
two most practical and functional routes to emulation: PC Bridgeboards. 
AmigaWorld just ran an article listing and rating all (I presume) of the 
hardware IBM emulators.  I'll do my best not to repeat their work. Instead,
I'd like to take a look at the overall implications of committing to a PC 
Bridgeboard, and what you get out of the sucker in return.

My background on the subject?  I have an A2000 with a Commodore 2286 
8 MHz Bridgeboard and dedicated (no choice in the matter) 5.25 HD floppy 
(and you thought those 5.25 bays didn't get used anymore!), with a 20 meg 
C: partition on my otherwise AmigaDos Maxtor hard drive.  I also do my 
best to learn everything I can about hardware emulators.

In this issue, I'd like to look specifically at the 2/3/4000 bridgeboard
line, since I have experience with them.  I may as well start with my 2286,
which should pretty much cover anything you might want to know about the
2088 (the XT emulator still available through some mail-order outlets
through various promotional packages).  Both use Commodore's Janus program
to do the communicating between IBM and Amiga.  What you get with these 
packages is a hybrid XT/AT keyboard emulation (the BIOS apparently 
thinks it is XT, since the system information program Snooper returns an 
84 key configuration, but that's not QUITE true.), mouse emulation, a 
two-floppy IDE controller, Commodore BIOS, parallel port emulation, and 
CGA and monochrome displays emulated through the Janus software.  This
graphic display is relatively choppy...at a priority of +5 on an 020/14, 
the screen display isn't smooth: usable, but not smooth.  Both offer access
to the IBM slots in your Amiga, although the XT can of course only access 
XT (8 bit) cards.  Both accept coprocessors onboard.  Both are also 
discontinued by Commodore, so prices may vary wildly, depending on how 
much dealers and mail-order houses want to ditch them (I've seen the 
2088 with a 360k drive for $50 in one ad).  These boards are good enough 
if you want to run rather old software, like public domain and commercial 
software from when EGA was an expensive prospect.  And although Commodore
actually encloses detailed instructions for using Windows on a stock 2088
or 2286, I wouldn't touch the idea with a 10-foot pole.  It would be
horrifyingly slow, not to mention silly (why bother with a 320x200, 2 color,
insanely slow Windows when you can just left-Amiga-M back to Workbench?)
These two boards are the most limited of the line: any floppy drives they
use must be directly hooked up and dedicated to the BridgeBoard, so using
DF0: is out.  They also come equipped with only 512k or 1 meg (the
difference between the XT and 286).  However, a relatively simple solution
comes from Alexander Hagen (alexhagn@neabbs.UUCP according to the doc-
umentation), who has written a shareware program to allow Janus-driven
bridgeboards to use Amiga memory as EMS, thereby freeing you from buying a
memory expansion card for your bridgeboard.  His shareware pitch: You only
get 384k of EMS until you register for $30, at which point you can use up
to 32 megs, if you can spare it (both the money and the memory).

This is all well and good, but if you want to go for a system that will
bring you at least near par for the IBM world, you'll want to go at LEAST
to a 386. 

There are two options for this, but that number will soon be down to one.  
Commodore's 2386sx board is one route, which gets you the tried and true 
Janus interface, as well as newfound access to DF0:, very handy if you 
have a high-density floppy there.  The 2386 runs at either 20 or 25 mhz 
(conflicting reports here: AmigaWorld lists it at 20 while I've seen it 
advertised at 25), and again has room for a coprocessor.  Aside from 
gaining speed and DF0:, you don't get any improvement over the 2286, 
although you CAN add RAM to the board itself: but it is a highly specialized
type (This is where AmigaEMS, the program I spoke of above, comes in 
handy again).  But Commodore has apparently dropped out of the BridgeBoard
market they created, and I'm told by my local Amiga dealer that it, too, has
been discontinued, although I continue to see it carriedat low ($200)
prices.  The alternate route is Vortex's Golden Gate 386, which is where my
range of personal knowledge runs out.  Instead, I draw upon the wisdom of
Dave Johnson's article on IBM emulators and sum up what I draw from it.
Vortex gives you the parallel emulation Commodore provides, and goes a step
further, giving you control of the serial port as well, should you so
desire it (rather nice if you'd like to use your modem, I'd think. Or a
serial mouse, but there really isn't a reason for that, since you still get 
mouse emulation).  They also include monochrone EGA and VGA emulation
directly in the software, but undoubtedly at no great speed unless you've
got an 030 or better.  In addition to the nice serial port, Vortex added in
one more goodie:  SIMM support.  Even though that plant in Japan blew up
recently, SIMMs are at least easier to get a hold of than Commodore's
bridgeboard memory, so when prices drop again, it's a much more viable
memory-adding option.  This is good, because Mr. Hagen's AmigaEMS program
won't work with the Golden Gate interface.  That may not be TOO big of a
problem, however, since according to Mr. Johnson, memory can be shared
between the Vortex board and the Amiga: the Amiga can either take up to 4
megs of the board's memory, or the board can claim half of the Amiga's
memory for its use.  Vortex's press release about these boards claims the
memory can be used as both EMS and XMS, probably with the use of DOS memory
managers.

Finally, the top of the line boards: EMC's 486 bridgeboard(basically a 
Commodore 2386sx board with a 486SLC/33 installed, which in turn is 
basically an enhanced 386 with the 486sx commands) and Vortex's 486 
board, also a 486SLC, this time 25mhz.  These boards basically follow the 
patterns of their 386 cousins to the letter, although each comes standard 
with more memory than the earlier models (3 megs for the EMC as 
opposed to 1 meg for the 2386, and 2 megs for the Vortex 486 as opposed 
to 512k for the Vortex 386.) The price wall really hits home on these 
systems-I have no current pricing information on the Vortex boards, but 
EMC lists their stock board at $930 in their own ad.  To go up to 8 megs 
through them takes it to $1135.  To get an 8 meg RAM/170 meg HD 
system, with a VGA switch box (so that you can share a VGA monitor with 
a flicker-corrected Amiga), and a super-crowded 16 bit card (IDE 
floppy/hard drive controller, paralle/serial/game ports and 1 meg SVGA 
display)  is $1520.  A VESA local bus 486/33 with all of that, PLUS a SVGA 
monitor is comparable to that price.  So if you've got the monitor, don't 
mind sharing it, and don't mind the 486SLC (I believe you need to go out 
and get your own coprocessor for that line), it's cost-comparable.  
Unfortunately, you also don't get any floppy drives with it, so unless
you've got a high-density drive somewhere, you're sunk again. I highly
doubt Vortex's packages would come out any cheaper than that.

Maybe that's the point of the article, (which if you've been reading I'm
sure you're dying to hear).  Emulating an IBM is going to cost you more than
going out and buying a clone. There's not much of a way of getting around 
that.  However, if you need to conserve desk space, already have some 
IBM equipment (most notably a display card, VGA monitor,  and spare IDE 
hard drive), and/or think that having an IBM multitask with the Amiga is
just too incredibly neat to pass up, one of these boards might be worth a
look.

Oddities:  Commodore and EMC figure that you don't really NEED a PC 
speaker, and would probably be better off without one, but the 
architecture provides a place to solder one if you really want it.  Vortex 
ships one standard.

Commodore's 2286 board is double-thick, and as such blocks the Zorro II 
slot it's next to.  I can't speak for the other boards, but be forewarned.

(Warning: The next message is a hack I haven't yet tested.  I trust the 
source enough to put it in, as he sells and works on Amigas for a living,
but neither of us are responsible if you melt your motherboard.)

The A2000 has two AT and two XT slots, and one AT slot gets taken up by 
the board, leaving just one 16 bit slot available for a good VGA card and 
hard drive control, right? Wrong.  Commodore was just too cheap to finish 
turning the XT slots into AT slots.  Look carefully.  All Commodore did was 
plug up the AT bus connecter holes below the XT slots.  But it's still wired 
on the AT bus.  Just get some 36-position connecters, desolder the board 
in that location, and solder in the connecters. Voila-4 AT slots, 3 available
so you don't have to buy a multi-IO card, which are more expensive than 
buying their components piecemeal. You'll even probably have space for a 
16 bit sound card, if you like.

Commodore and the EMC 486 give you a standard two-floppy IDE controller,
leaving you on your own to get a hard drive controller.  Vortex gives you a
standard IDE hard drive controller, but leaves you on your own to get a
floppy controller...

That about wraps it up for this week, I believe.  Before I go, a few last 
words:  I apologize for the way I introduced the column last week. The 
opening sentence was about 4 lines long and was REALLY lousy English.  
I think I was just excited. :)

PLEASE give me your thoughts and comments.  My net address is 
jcompton@mlinknet.uucp, in case you missed it the two times above.

Lastly, I should point out that retroactive to the last article, many of the
products and companies mentioned above are trademarks of their respective
corporations.  Any lack of acknowledgement in the course of the article is
not intended as a challenge to these trademarks.  The author recognizes the
trademarks held by these companies.

As a final note, thanks to Katie Nelson for listening to me ramble 
incessantly about emulators and for helping me compare them to real-life 
systems.

         |O |          Version 2 |/_________________________\|
         |_/

*** The Tool & Goal ***

     The Director Version 2 is a powerful text based authoring
system for creating interactive multimedia presentations, slide
shows and animations. Yet, the strength of the program is also
its weakness. Although the process is easy, it needs some
programming skills and careful attention to details. One area
that could be streamlined is button creation for interactive
presentations.

     Professional looking multimedia presentations usually have
3D bevelled buttons that are not hard to create but can be time
consuming create. The Director has a "Button Utility" to use with
pre-drawn graphics but no built-in button creation features...
yet, it does have a full list of graphic capabilities. The
following is an explanation of how to develop a button "library"
that will allow you to create a 3 dimensional looking bevelled
button within your Director script. The command will position,
size and colour a bevelled button and centre a text label on it.
You can even have an optional "button hole."

     For those who don't use the Director as their authoring
system the BASIC language source could be easily translated to
the language of your choice. It could even be adapted for use
with ARexx capable paint & draw programs.

     As you know, on-screen buttons are the main way to
navigate through an interactive presentation. Normally, with the
Director, an author would use a paint program to draw buttons,
save the image(s), and then load it into the Button Utility to
mark out the hotspot locations. This is an easy, largely
automated process.

     Yet, there are a few potential problems with this method. If
you have many different screens of buttons, each one takes up
valuable disk space and waiting for it to load can slow down the
presentation. Also, using a paint program to draw buttons can be
time consuming and tedious, especially if you want to make many
revisions. The solution?  Use the graphic capabilities of the
Director to render the buttons for you.

     To render buttons on screen you could simply make a
rectangle and stick some text on it, though it wouldn't look very
elegant or professional. A powerful feature of the Director is
the external library. A library is frequently used pieces of
code that can be called up in any script with just a few
commands. The MakeButton command described here will render
buttons of any size at any location on any screen format. The
size of the bevel, the location of the text, the colours and
almost any feature can be modified with a few quick numbers.

*** The Essence of Buttonness ***

     To get the impression of 3 dimensions, a button can have
light and dark areas around it that provide the illusion that it
is raised out from the screen. The bevelled look requires some
work because there are five facets (or sides) that include the
button top area, (the part that would be pressed) and four
trapezoid "sides" (two parallel lines joined by angled lines)
that appear to slope up from the screen surface to the edges of
the button top. Shading of the sides, or bevels, is done
according to an imaginary high, leftside light source. The bevels
on the top and left are brighter than the right and bottom
bevels. The use of colour and shades is what gives a button its
"buttonness."

     Generally, the thicker the bevels the "higher" the button
appears (but, if the bevels get too large they loose the
illusion.)  Also, bevels usually appear equal on all sides, as if
the button was looked at straight-on. One way to enhance the
look of a button is to place it in a "buttonhole," such as a
bevelled frame around the button with a slight gap between. This
gives the impression that the button is mounted on the screen and
inlaid into it. Usually the buttonhole bevels have the opposite
colour scheme to make it appear to be further away instead of
nearer. An author must have control over the thickness and
colour of button and hole bevels and the size and colour of the
gap.

     Buttons without a label or picture would be quite useless.
Therefore, to note their function, buttons must have text or
pictures on them. For aesthetic reasons this information
probably should be centred or positioned in some way and should
appear to be apart of the button, ie. text should be constrained
to the button and wrap around inside it if needed. The author
also should be able to control the font, colour, indentation of
margins and other attributes of the text.


*** A Button Library ***

     In general, an multimedia author needs to be concerned about
the three basic categories of location, size and colour.
Location includes the location of the button and the location of
the text within the button. Size is the size of the button, its
bevels, font size, and, if there is a buttonhole, the size of the
buttonhole gap and bevels. Colour includes the colour of button
elements and arrangement and text style and colour.

     When developing a presentation an author will often have
one consistent style for the whole work and will only need to be
concerned with the button size, location, and label. Everything
else could be set once by default or a configuration setup.

     Presented here, the Button Library has four main user
commands:  "MakeButton" takes care of positioning, sizing and
labelling; "ButtonConfig" sets up bevel sizes and the existence
of a ButtonHole; "ButtonColour" sets the colours for all the
various parts; and "ButtonText" sets the font type and some text
attributes. There is also a command called "ButtonReset" to
restore the default values. Only MakeButton actually does
anything, the others simply assign variables. There are also
several other procedures in the library that are not directly
accessed.

*** The MakeButton Command ***

     There are several ways to render bevels. One way is to
create the outline for each facet by drawing a line from one
point to another, resulting in a closed graphic, and fill it in
with the appropriate colour. This is similar to how it would be
done in a paint program. The Director has a built-in feature
that can do this more efficiently. Using the POLYGON command all
you have to do is feed the coordinates for each facet and the
program will render it. After doing this five times you have a
bevelled button.

     Of course, you can't input any coordinates that you want,
you have to be systematic. A bevelled button is composed of two
rectangles, one inside the other for a total of eight corners or
points. The bevel ends are formed by drawing a line from one
inside point of the large rectangle to an opposing outside point
of the smaller graphic. All the points have a relationship to
each other by being equal, less or greater in value than the
others, depending on the location.

     The MakeButton command uses the left/top corner coordinates
and the width and height of the button. A button that originates
at location 10,10; is 50 pixels wide and 25 pixels high and says
"Press Me" would use the command: DO MakeButton, 10, 10, 50, 25,
"Press Me". MakeButton uses the PARAMETER command to grab the
coordinates. It knows that the first two numbers represent the
location of the top corner (10,10) and the second two are width
and height (50,25). These values represent the outside edges of
the larger rectangle. The default thickness for bevels is 5
pixels, so the small inner rectangle can be calculated because it
is 5 pixels smaller on all sides.

     I mentioned that there are a total of eight points to be
calculated. I have numbered these points P1 to P8 going
clockwise around and in from the left/top corner. The math is
very easy but a diagram explains it better than I can:

  x = the starting x coordinate (left)
  y = the starting y coordinate (top)
 p# = the two x & y coordinates
p#x = the x coordinate of the p# point
p#y = the y coordinate of the p# point
 bx = the bevel width
 by = the bevel height

  p1 _________________ p2   Outer Rectangle
    |\_______________/|     p1 = x & y
    ||p5           p6||     p2 = (x + width) & y
    ||               ||     p3 = (x + width) & (y + height)
    ||               ||     p4 = x & (y + height)
    ||               ||
    ||               ||     Inner Rectangle
    ||p8___________p7||     p5 = (p1x + bx) & (p1y + by)
    |/_______________\|     p6 = (p2x - bx) & (p2y + by)
  p4                   p3   p7 = (p3x - bx) & (p3y - by)
                            p8 = (p4x + bx) & (p4y - by)

               The inner rectangle is calculated by using
               the values in p1,p2,p3 & p4 and adding or
               subtracting the bevel width or height, as required.

     When calculating the coordinates, all values are in relation
to the origin that is considered temporarily to be 0,0 or the top
corner of the screen. This way the image could easily be moved
to any location on the screen. After completing the calculations
for the eight points the values are recorded in a 2 dimensional,
8 element array called "PointList". An array is a group of variables
accessed by a number instead of a name. When finished, we have the
relative location for all the points.

     The next step is to draw the polygons. As I mentioned, an
array stores the eight points for the button numbered 1 to 8. To
draw each facet all that needs to be done is pass the point
number and colour to the POLYGON command for rendering. We are
not passing the actual coordinates, only its location in the
PointList array. We do this five times: the button top and four
bevels.

     If a ButtonHole is to be drawn then it is be done first,
before drawing the button, using the same method as above. The
only difference is that the size has to be calculated to be
larger than the button, it also has inverted colours.

     I should note that there is an internal procedure charged
with the dual purpose of setting bevel and gap variables and
adjusting for the screen format. Amiga screen formats have
different pixel aspects (the ratio of width to height) and can
distort images if not dealt with. Hires and Lores screen pixels
are almost square but Medres (640x200) and Interlace (320x400)
are double-high and double-wide, respectively. The Button library
will adjust for this distortion for the bevels so they will
appear to be the same thickness on all sides, regardless of
screen display format.

    The last deed to be done is button labelling. All that is
required here is to calculate the margins of the button and use
an FTEXT command to write the label. The PointList array,
mentioned earlier, provides the margins that are then adjusted
for screen location and indentation. The result is that the text
will always wrap, left to right, in the button area. The
formating codes are inserted into the text string for use with
FTEXT. FTEXT outputs formatted text that can include colour,
font, style and justification changes. Therefore, the author can
use special codes to highlite the text.

    The centre of the from top to bottom is calculated and is
then adjusted for the font height. If the author wants to have it
higher or lower then she or he can modify the FontHeight
parameter accordingly. With this feature the button library is
not limited to buttons, it also could be used to display text.

    The source for this library may look long but if you use
buttons frequently you probably will find that the effort to
type it out is worth the convenience it provides. One word of
warning:  unlike ARexx, the Director is CASE sensitive for
variable and procedure labels. When you type it out be VERY
careful to follow any mIXeD CAsE names. You also will note that
many variables have a "b" at the beginning. This is to protect
against name duplication within your script which could have
unexpected results. When you are finished save it as
Director:library/Button.dlib.



*** Button Things Up! ***

    How to do you use this library?  There are a couple steps
but it isn't too difficult. The first thing is to put INCLUDE
Director:library/Button.dlib" in your script, usually at the
top. To get a default button type:

    DO MakeButton,<Xpos>,<Ypos>,<Width>,<Height>,<"Comment">
Then you have to set up the hotspot by adding the same
position/size parameters to your buttonlist array (see Director
manual, P11-3).

    To change bevel thickness or the existence of a buttonhole
type:   DO ButtonConfig,<BevSize>,<HoleBev>,<GapSize>,<Adjust>

BevSize is the bevel thickness, HoleBev is the buttonhole bevel
thickness & GapSize is the size of the gap. If HoleBev and
GapSize are both 0 no ButtonHole is drawn. Adjust turns screen
format adjustment OFF (0) or ON (1).

    To change the colour you enter:
    DO ButtonColours, <Top>,<Hilite>,<Shade1>,<Shade2>,<Shade3>,
       <Dark>,<Text>,<TextBG>

Each parameter is a colour palette number. Top is the button
colour, Hilite is the top bevel, Shade1 to Shade3 are
respectively the right-side, bottom and left-side bevels, Dark is
the gap colour, Text is the text colour and TextBG is for the
text shadow.

    To modify the text configuration use the command:
    DO ButtonText, <FontNum>, <FontHeight>, <ShadowX>,
       <ShadowY>, <LMargin>, <RMargin>, <Justify>, <Centre>

FontNum is a loaded font from 1-9, 0 makes no changes and 10
resets to default system font. FontHeight is the height in pixels
for the font, or the number of pixels text is to be offset from
the centre (divided by 2.)  ShadowX & ShadowY are the text
background offset in pixels (NONE if 0). LMargin & RMargin are
the margins within the button. Ypos is the number of pixels down
from the top edge (will approximate the centre if 0), Justify and
Centre will each turn justification or centring ON (1) or OFF (0).

    The script called ShowButtons shows how to use the button
library. Like most things, the best way to learn is to play
around. Enhancements of this library could include changable
text, rounded edges, automatic brush placement, display effects,
animation, etc. You could create a utility to save IFF pictures
to modify renderings in paint programs. Also, modification of the
Button Utility, that is included with the Director, could allow
you to interactively draw buttons, similar to a draw program. The
possiblities are almost endless if you want bountiful bevelled
buttons.

/// Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users
    --------------------------------------



                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA or through Tymnet from anywhere in
North America.  If you have an account on another Internet-connected
system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet programs, from
anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users can now Telnet
into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 - Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files, online, 24 hours a day.
   Portal has dedicated a 2.5 GIGabyte disk drive to the Amiga Zone.
   We have virtually unlimited space for files and new uploads. 

 - The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable
   software, online.  All of it.  Every disk.  Well-organized so
   it's easy to find exactly what you're after.

 - Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

 - Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES,
   and many others including Compute's Amiga Resource with over
   4 Megabytes of exclusive Compute magazine disk stuff you won't find
   elsewhere.

 - 35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.  Since Portal has FTP connections we can get
   new freely-distributable software online within MINUTES of its 
   being announced on Usenet.

 - No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.  Start downloading
   files with your first session on Portal. 

 - Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.
   Instead of stumbling around in frustration you can talk to the
   people who design your hardware, who write your software.

 - Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

 - Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

 - FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
 - Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  Usenet feeds into Portal many times each hour.
   There are 14 Amiga-specific Usenet newsgroups with hundreds of
   articles posted every day, including postings by Commodore 
   personnel.  Since Usenet is distributed worldwide, your questions
   and answers can be seen by literally hundreds of thousands of
   people the same day you post them.  

 - Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

 - The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
 - Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
 - All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

 - Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

 - And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

  have on an Internet-connected system. 
% 9600 bps Sprintnet and Tymnet available in over 300 cities areas
+ $10 rate prevails at smaller US Cities
# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Tymnet 9600bps services is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

brand-new  under  Windows  and  significantly enhanced  for  the  Macintosh
version, offer you the creative freedom  and performance you need to design
and produce world-class publications of virtually any kind.

Horizontal and vertical reflection of objects

Intuitive  Control palette to position,  scale, or crop  objects and select

or any handle

Cropping of rotated objects

Text mode of the palette visible in layout or story editor views

NEW UNDER WINDOWS (contained in Mac PM 4.2)

PageMaker 5.0 is, of course, file-compatible on the Macintosh and Windows

platforms, and the new and enhanced features shown elsewhere on this
brochure apply to both versions. In addition, users of PageMaker for
Windows will appreciate these new features, which first appeared in
PageMaker 4.2 for the Macintosh:

FOR PRECISION AND CONTROL . . .

Automatic true typographers' quotation marks

Baseline-to-baseline leading

Multiple-paste command, speeding up step-and-repeat work

FOR VERSATILITY . . .

Page sizes up to 42" x 42"

Option to unlink files

Standalone Dictionary Editor utility

No limit to the number of copies printed at once
 
AND, ON THE FAMOUS PAGEMAKER INTERFACE . . .

"Apply" button in the Indents/tabs dialog box

Keyboard shortcuts for applying styles

Options to save files faster or smaller

Interruptible screen redraw

Double-click shortcut to reset zero point

     PageMaker 5.0 features significant  advances in precision and control,
smooth  integration   with  other  software  and   hardware,  and  expanded
versatility in the  wide range  of printed communications  it can  produce.
With the advent of  version 5.0, product functions are  virtually identical
under the Windows and Macintosh operating systems-so much so that customers
will receive the same user manual for both computing environments.

     "PageMaker  5.0 is the most  ambitious release of  the world's leading
desktop publishing  product," said  Lori Birtley, senior  product marketing
manager. "Its feature set was designed  with a great deal of customer input
and is  based  on more  than  500,000 lines  of  new code.  We've  received
feedback  from more  than  2,500 beta  sites  and evaluators,  and  they're
applauding the new features and speed improvements."

     Birtley  added  that  customer  demand  for  PageMaker  5.0  has  been
extremely high, leading to a record number of upgrade orders. "This product
is one of the most visible examples of our commitment to providing the best
software products for the graphics professional."

     Extensive third-party support reflects worldwide leadership

     As the  world leader  in professional page-layout  software, PageMaker
offers  extensive  support  from third  parties.  More  than  30 books  and
training manuals about  PageMaker 5.0  are being produced.  Some 120  Aldus
Authorized Trainers in the United States alone offer a variety of levels of
end-user  training.  Many independent  developers  are  readying new  Aldus
Additions that will continue  to extend PageMaker's professional publishing
capabilities. And a record number of U.S. and Canadian service  bureaus are
becoming members of the Aldus Authorized Imaging Center program.

     To coincide with the  recent introduction of PageMaker 5.0,  Aldus has
created  special support programs  for service  providers, such  as service
bureaus and imaging  centers. These programs  offer, among others,  regular
technical  bulletins,  toll-free  telephone  access  to  specially  trained
support  technicians,  and discounts  on  Aldus  software. In  addition,  a
specially trained team of  Aldus product experts has been  leading seminars
throughout the country. The seminars give service providers key information
about  the new PageMaker  so they  can be ready  for the  product when they
begin receiving PageMaker 5.0 files.

     In  the  PageMaker  box  itself,  Aldus  has included  its  Commercial
Printing Guide, which offers help in preparing PageMaker files for prepress
production, as well as tips on how to work with service bureaus.

     Superior features meet the highest publishing standards

     PageMaker 5.0  rotates  and skews  text  and graphics  in  0.01-degree
increments,  along with horizontal and  vertical reflection of objects. The
user can also edit rotated text  and crop rotated graphics directly in page
layout  view. The Control palette  affords precise placement  and sizing of
both text and graphics on the page.

     Aldus  has  completely  rewritten  the  PostScript  printing  code  in
PageMaker 5.0. The  product brings to  the market  the highest quality  and
fastest  throughput  for  virtually  any  kind  of  printed  communication.
Printing speeds, including those  for background printing, are up  to twice
as fast  as those of the nearest competitor.  The Print dialog box has been
redesigned to  allow for pages  to be printed  in any sequence or  group of
sequences-a  significant  time   saving.  Crop,  registration,  and   plate
identification are among the printers' marks PageMaker 5.0 offers.  Service
bureaus  and  end-users alike  will benefit  from  its new  custom printing
options. For example, it's  now possible to define and  save print settings
and  to send  multiple files  with different  settings to an  output device
simultaneously.

     PageMaker 5.0 for  Windows includes  many new or  improved import  and
export  filters, such  as Kodak  Photo CD,  DXF, WordPerfect  Graphics, and
Metafile/PICT   conversion.  The   product  supports   OLE  (as   a  client
application) on  both Windows  and Macintosh  systems, as  well as the  new
TWAIN  standard   for  direct  scanning.  The  PANOSE  font  mapper,  which
identifies  a  publication's  missing  fonts and  then  substitutes  other,
available fonts, will also be shipped with PageMaker 5.0.

     Built-in  Aldus  Additions  technology  lets  users  tailor  PageMaker
operations to meet  their specific publishing  needs. End-users can  create
their  own PageMaker  scripts,  while third-party  developers  can use  the
technology  to create Additions that give PageMaker new capabilities.  More
than 20 Aldus Additions  are included with  each version of PageMaker  5.0.
Several-including Expert Kerning,  which automatically adjusts  the spacing
between  characters,  and  Edit   Tracks,  for  customizing  font  tracking
information on  a point-size  basis-enhance the already  strong typographic
capabilities  in  PageMaker.  Other  Additions are  supplied  for  grouping
objects, sorting pages, and creating running headers and footers.

     PageMaker   now  produces   process-color   separations  of   complete
pages-including text and graphics, as well  as imported CMYK TIFF, DCS, and
EPS images. The  number of color  libraries has  been increased to  include
Dainippon, Focoltone, Munsell, Toyo,  and Trumatch, as well as  the PANTONE
spot, process, and Euroscale  definitions. Users can also create  their own
custom color libraries.

     The product  now offers the  ability to  open virtually any  number of
publications simultaneously.  Tile and  cascade  capabilities organize  the
publications on screen.  Customers can  "drag and drop"  text and  graphics
between  open  publications-saving significant  time  and  effort. The  new
Library  palette stores  frequently used  images, again  with drag-and-drop
capability.

System configuration

     Aldus PageMaker  5.0 for  Windows requires Microsoft  Windows 3.1  and
Windows 3.1-compatible hardware. A 486 or 386-based DOS-compatible computer
is recommended,  with 4MB  of RAM,  an 80MB  hard drive,  a high-resolution
graphics adaptor card, and a mouse.

Technical support and pricing

     First-time  purchasers of PageMaker 5.0 will be able to take advantage
of  an innovative  product-support program:  For 90  days from  their first
telephone call  for assistance,  support technicians will  be available  to
them 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. After the 90 days, 24-hour support will
be  offered to  those customers  who subscribe  to the  Aldus CustomerFirst
extended-support program. 

     The  suggested retail price of PageMaker 5.0 is $895 (U.S.). Customers
who purchased version 4.0 (for Windows) after January 1, 1993, are eligible
for   a  free  upgrade  to  version  5.0,  if  they  return  their  product
registration card and the  dated original proof of purchase.  Customers who
purchased  PageMaker  4.0 or  an earlier  Windows  version before  1993 can
upgrade for $150 (U.S.). Upgrades are available directly from Aldus or from
Aldus dealers. Greater  discounts apply  for customers who  have a  service
contract with Aldus.

     Aldus Europe  and Aldus Pacific  Rim will announce  localized language
versions and support and upgrade policies for other markets shortly.

Hello Robert and the gang at Amiga Report,


	I would just like to comment on your article in Amiga Report 1.20
regarding the uploading of files to BBS's.  I am the sysop of FileWorks
and I have been doing the descriptions of files on my BBS like you
suggested since I started it back in April of 1991.  I don't necessarily
follow the naming  conventions, I usually give it the most descriptive
filename I can in 8.3 characters without a version number but I always
give the version number in the description along with the full name of the
program.

	I encourage you and anyone else to give my BBS a call and be able
to determine if you want a file or not at a glance.  Files are available
for downloading on first call.

	Phone numbers are:

		(716) 377-0719 14.4 DS HST
		(716) 377-3695 12-2400 BPS


	Thank you for the great work on Amiga Report.  I enjoy reading each
and every article.  Its always a popular download on my BBS.

Sincerely,

Tom Waterstraat

Subj:   a program you should see/hear



Mr. Glover,

I am attempting to proliferate a freeware program for the Amiga that
implements an entirely new color-organ algorithm, which causes music and
colors to sympathize better than any previous system. This program for the
Amiga is currently the only decent implementation of this new system. The
program is at the various aminet archive sites, but the most recent version
isn't yet. I will append the archive access info and the docfile for the
program. I urge you to see to it that some member of your staff reviews the
program. Any assistance I can offer will be of the utmost priority.

Thanks!

                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Attention midi/Amigans!

I'd like to inform you of a freebie you haven't seen before.
The archive cycluphonics.lzh contains a program called mcf
that takes midi coming into an Amiga and converts pitches
into changes in the color palette of a screen. The program
uses a new algorithm that causes the colors to sympathize
noticeably with the music. It's very pleasant and very
different. I am now in a position to provide e-mail support
for the program at
             rickh@cap.gwu.edu
    or voice (202) 364-4424    USA    anytime.

The archive may be obtained at midi ug dc (local bbs) or

WHAT

The archive cycluph.lzh contains a freeware program for the Amiga called
`midi cycluphonics'. The most recent version as of this writing is the
file mcf3.( mcf4) The archive also contains a variety of gizmos to go with
the program including some pictures I did, an amiga midi library by
Pregnant Badger, and the pic viewer `sho'.

`Midi Cycluphonics' is an implementation of a system I have devised which I
call `cycluphonics'. Cycluphonics generally is a way to correlate musical
pitches to colors or vice versa which is not specific to computers. Midi
cycluphonics was written by Jim Vacarro ph.D. after much begging by me and
after he saw my attempt to do cycluphonics in 16 colors on a c64, i.e. out
of pity(The c64 program is called `colorg', and isn't that bad, actually).

Cycluphonics differs from previous color-organ-like systems I am aware of
in that it maps a color wheel to a cycle-of-fifths instead of a chromatic
or other scale. This method causes the music and the visuals to be somewhat
`sympathetic', as Jim Willis so aptly put it. Because the spacial and har-
monic reationships between the notes on a cycle-of-fifths are quite similar
to the relationships between points on a color wheel, a direct mapping be-
tween the two will result in similar feelings being implied by visuals and
music that are linked cycluphonically. The existence of such a relationship
has been suspected since antiquity.

Mcf3 accepts midi note events, converts them to colors , blends
them if appropriate, and changes the color palette of a screen to the
in-coming music. It is still in the experimental stage and we are learning
as we go, but it does work. The environment it works in is still rather
restricted, but it works well enough for someone to decide what they think
of cycluphonics, and it works well enough for an amigan with midi gear to
do some rather unusual stuff.

The environment mcf3 prefers is an Amiga with an installed midi library,
some external device putting midi note events at the serial port, and a 32
color screen to process the colors of. Mcf3 was written and tested ini-
tially with another Amiga running Deluxe Music as the midi source, or a
cheap midi keyboard, or Miracle keyboard sequences. We have not come up with
a way to run mcf3 on a single Amiga and get visuals and sound simultaneously.
Another problem , which may be solved soon, is that mcf3 expects every
note-on event to have an accompanying note-off event. This is crucial to
note/color blending, but this is not as bad as the single platform challenge.

HOW TO

So ya wanna see some music, eh kid? Turn on your source of midi to the
Amiga. Put a 32 color image such as the enclosed `pics/barsdots' up on the
screen. The enclosed image viewer `sho' doesn't cycle colors, which would
conflict with mcf3, so if you want to use an image that cycles by itself
use sho. Using the mouse, drag the picture down close to the bottom of the
screen. Run mcf3. Mcf3 will put up it's window ( You might also want to run
an editor window of this file initially.) It's a standard ados window
titled MidiCycluphonics with the basic window gadgets. In the window are a
variety of program-specific gadgets. The first row of almost-square gadgets
are ....

    CYCLO    Don't click this one yet. It activates cycluphonics but it
                requires some setup. This one will be hi-lited if it's on.

    SCREEN GRAB  This is the one you have to click before CYCLO. This one
                     grabs the color palette of the top-most screen for the
                     use of mcf3. This is a bit of a hack, since it violates
                     ados protocols. This means you have to quit mcf3 before
                     removing your image screen or you'll guru. Be careful
                     dragging your image screen when you've hit this gadget.

    RESTORE PALETTE  which puts your image's original coloration  back.

    USE C-Y-M  stands for cyan, magenta and yellow. these are the primary
                  colors when dealing with pigments, i.e. subtractive
                  synthesis. This is complementary to RGB which is add-
                  itive synthesis. Jim and I prefer CYM. This one will also
                  be hi-lited to indicate it's state.

    FLUSH COLORS  Mcf3 keeps a running average of all notes currently active.
                    If you don't get a note-off for every note-on, notes will
                    stay in the average forever and the resulting colors will
                    get monotonous. This gadget clears the average. Right now
                    the actual solution to this problem is to use midi info
                    with balanced note-ons and offs, like organ music. sigh.

    REDO COLORS   This gadget causes a recompute of the table mcf3 uses to
                     assign colors to notes. That is, it recalculates the
                     formula (in the window)  hue=blahblahblah. You can get
                     started without worrying about this one.

That's the top row. The ones you need to get started are SCREEN GRAB and
CYCLO, in that time order.

Then there's a line of text in the window, `cycle on event', it says.
This means that the next line of gadgets determines when and how often mcf3
computes a new color and cycles it (fifos it?) into the image. If you click
em all off nothing will happen. If only `note on' is on a new color will be
computed and added whenever mcf3 gets a note-on event. These are additive.
The two clock based ones require non-zero values to be meaningful. A jiffy
is one sixtieth of a second (ntsc). By using note events the cycling will
be faster when the music is busier. By using one of the clocks you get a
constant-rate cycling. The clock counter numbers let you vary the rate.
These guys are also hi-lited when active.

Then there's that zany formula. It's there mostly to compare cycluphonics
to other transforms. It lets you change the basic algorithm of mcf3 so you
can see what you think of cycluphonics compared to some arbitrary mapping
of notes to colors. This is included for the scientifically rigorous, but
the `offset' value, which is initially 0, can be changed without violating
cycluphonics. In fact, it's rather important to cycluphonics. By varying
this value between 0 and 360 you can control the overal color of a piece of
music. If the offset variable is 0, then the note C gets mapped to red. The
rest of the color wheel is then mapped to the cycle of fifths accordingly.
Change the offset to 120 and C becomes green. In other words, this is how
you rotate the two wheels relative to each other. I'll explain the rest of
the formula in some obscure journal someday. Promise.

The lower-most semantic object in the mcf3 window ( pretentious much?) is
the `saturation' variable. It defaults to 12%. Saturation represents purity
of hue. Thats all I know. Play with it. Think of it as art.

So, to get started you put up a 32 color screen image, drag it down so you
can leave it as the topmost screen while you do some other stuff, run mcf3,
click on SCREEN GRAB which steals the color palette of that picture you've
got dragged `down' in terms of screen x,y coordinates but which is still the
topmost screen in terms of ados screens, send your Amiga some midi with
plenty of note-offs, cross your fingers and click CYCLO. Carefully drag the
pic up so you can enjoy cycluphonics. *Something* should happen if you leave
all the other gadgets and variables at the defaults.

CYCLUPHONICS THE CONCEPT

For ages musicians and visual artists have tried to correlate sounds and
colors. Some famous composers have been convinced that middle C is a
particular hue. The artist Kandinski, who was perhaps THE father of
abstract art, was seeking in the visual realm the self-meaningfulness of
music, i.e. the way that music affects the listener without necessarily
relying on audio likenesses of the real world. Aristotle compared the
combination of pitches to the blending of pigments. He noted that a pure
harmonious interval is a distict sound from it's two component pitches,
much as a blend of two pigments results in a distinct new color. Sharp
cookie, that Aristotle. Cycluphonics doesn't care what color middle C is,
as long as it stays a particular color for a while. The choice of what color
middle C is is arbitrary. The choice is yours with the mcf3 `offset'
variable. Rather, cycluphonics is based on a `same difference' mechanism.
A certain type of difference between two notes can be systematically held
to be analagous to a certain type of difference between two colors.
Cycluphonics considers the musical interval known as a perfect fifth to be
analagous to the difference/similarity between two adjacent hues on a 12
hue color wheel, regardless of the note names of the notes or the exact
colors in question. A musical fifth is analagous to a 30 degree interval
on a color wheel. It doesn't have to be more specific than that. By extending
the analogy to say that a cycle of fifths is analagous to a color wheel we
have cycluphonics, a system which can be implemented on a variety of
automata.

The cycle of fifths is taught early on in any formal music course. It is
usually used in stepwise fashion to allow changing the key of a piece of
music in pleasing smooth steps rather than abruptly. It is also useful
in other ways, but it is usually thought of as something you traverse in
steps. It is when you look at the geometry of the cycle of fifths as a
whole, and by interval name from some arbitrary starting point rather than
by note name, that you see it's remarkable `analagousness' to a color
wheel.

The cycle of fifths, starting at C, is......
C  G  D  A  E  B  G flat  D flat  A flat  E flat  B flat  F  and C again.

               C
         F            G
     B flat               D          CYCLE OF FIFTHS BY NOTE NAMES


   E flat                    A


     A flat               E

         D flat        B
              G flat

If this sequence is clockwise around a ring then counter-clockwise is
the cycle of fourths. Any two adjacent notes on this ring are seven
semitones apart, which is the most harmonious interval between two notes
of different names. This interval is called the perfect fifth. This
construct has a number of fascinating properties. Notice that if this is a
ring,then C is opposite G flat. Nearly opposite C on either side of G flat
are D flat and B. These three notes all clash harshly with C, much as colors
opposite each other on a color wheel clash. This similarity of harmonic
geometry is consistent, albeit approximate, all the way around the wheels.
Also, these relationships work with any keynote.

COMING ATTRACTIONS

This section constitutes predicting the future, which is a tricky business,
but here goes. The note-on note-off problem is a bug, but it may be squashed
soon, I hope. I am eager to see an AGA version of mcf. 256 colors would make
a big difference. A friend of Jim's and mine has threatened to do a version
of cycluphonics on his intel-based machine. Controls for mcf could be
included in with the music by dedicating a sliver of the midi info to mcf.
I don't know if there's an anim player that works with mcf. I imagine that
at some point there will be. Jim Willis has strongly suggested that mcf be
made aware of `general midi'. Mcf could recieve features derived from my
investigations into cycluphonic motion. I'd like to see, and may write, a
simpler more demo-like implementation of cycluphonics that loads and runs
on a single stock Amiga without external gear. I'd like to know how to make
mcf as useful as possible to Toaster mechanics. Rather than a color
palette, mcf could control a red green and blue spotlight for live music,
where one musician is producing midi. I've done some work on a stringed
instrument that could do cycluphonics by analog means, sort of a guitar
that plugs into a tv. And on and on. Suggestions are nice, and I appreciate
the spirit in which they are given, but please keep in mind that I've been
thinking about this and related stuff for a long time. What I really need,
and what would be best for the Amiga community, is for people to try mcf3,
make thier own assessment of the potential of cycluphonics, do stuff with
it, preferably for public consumption, and spread the word, i.e. the
archive. As of this writing there has been no public use of cycluphonics.

/// A Call For Help!
    ----------------
    By Robert Niles


A while ago Amiga Report moved to the AmigaGuide format for a variety
of reasons. One of these reasons was so that we could include pictures
within the magazine in a easy, convenient way.

As most pictures are somewhat large, and we really don't want to start
creating an archive that is a burden to download, we would like to ask
someone to create a IFF brush viewing program that we may use here with
the Amiga Report magazine. We wouldn't be able to pay you for your time
and efforts, but we would give you the credit due, and we would be 
extremely grateful!

What we are looking for is this:

- A program that works well within the SHELL environment.
- Be able to take arguments (to load the picture brush file).
- Load and display 2 to 32 color IFF brushes.
- Create a border around the brush, automatically adjusting to the size
  of the brush.
- Have the window draggable and with a close gadget.
- Be as small as possible in size, using as little memory as possible.
- Be compatible with 1.3 systems on up to 3.0 systems.


Can this be done?? 

If so, this will enable us to load up picture files, and use only as much
memory as needed to display what needs to be shown.

Again, we wouldn't be able to pay you, but we do not ask for any rights 
over the program. We would just like to be able to include it within our
distribution archive as needed.

Send questions, comments to @{"Robert Glover or to Robert Niles" link P2-2}.

Thank you,

	Amiga Report

    --------------------


I dunno if any of you listen to NPR (Natioanl Public Radio) in the
morning, but today (Sun, 10Apr93) there was a news interview with a 
bankruptcy judge who let this couple file bankruptcy. The couple's 
$25,000 debt to this bank was dissolved but the bank's computer kept 
sending the couple mail stating that they need to pay this money. The 
judge ordered the bank to clear the couple's name from the computer so 
that they would stop getting these notices. Well the computer kept on 
sending them even though the bank cleared the couple out. After a while,
and with the judge believing that the bank was trying to resolve the 
problem with the computer, the Judge finally issued a court order 
TO THE COMPUTER stating that if the computer did not stop, the computer 
would be in comtempt of court and fined 50MB of hard drive space and 
10MB of RAM.  Well the computer kept it up and so the judge ordered 
THE COMPUTER to give up the 50MB of HD space and 10MB of RAM, later 
the notices stopped, and found with a note from the computer signed 
with a bar code, was a 50MB HD and a strip of chips for 10MB of RAM.
...and who says the court system doesn't work!?! (This IS a TRUE story!!).

Our machine is a 386/33 with 20MB of memory, 1GB harddisk and upcoming
CD-ROM drive. The BBS software is a Norwegian origin MBBS running in
a DesqView window. 

We have over 6000 files online (no CD-ROM yet) containing titles for PC
and Amiga or both like GIF-pictures, music-modules and text-files. The
upload/download ratio is a very lousy 1:100.  (i.e. you upload a 20k file
and may download 2MB).

Messages are mainly written in Finnish, but English is widely used by
Swedish-speaking and international callers.

Download-access will be granted when asked. Also Amiga-areas are available
for those who will need them to avoid 'wars' between PC and Amiga users.
Access to sex pictures and stories are only for persons over 18 years
and given when requested.

Every user has an access to download filelist (LAHOFIL.ZIP), list of
Finnish 24-hour BBS's (BBSLIST.ZIP or BBSLIST.LHA) and every issue of
the Amiga Report Magazine (AR101.LHA-AR1??.LHA) on their first call.

The system is 4.5 years old and sponsored by the local telephone company,
Vaasan Laanin Puhelin Oy.
