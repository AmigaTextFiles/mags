Just a brief, unfortunate update on the world of Amiga journalism outside
the steady confines of Amiga Report:

Datormagazin, the only Swedish Amiga publication, has ceased production.
The publisher cited insufficient circulation as the reason.

Scientific Amigan, the newsletter dedicated to really wild and impressive
applications of the Amiga in real-life research and science will publish
one last issue.  Both of the publisher's Amigas died, in rapid succession,
and the publication had put him in considerable debt as it was.  Readers
may request refunds, but the publisher would really appreciate if you'd let
him keep it since he's lost money by SA as it is...

Amiga Game Zone, which published its third issue in October 1994 but
continually promised a fourth, will publish two more issues before February
1996 and will cease both producing magazines and selling Amiga games.  The
publisher blames the Commodore-Amiga Technologies gap of one year on their
decision.  Readers are being offered credit on their subscriptions towards
the purchase of merchandise sold by AGZ.

With the death of SA and the finally confirmed demise of AGZ, North America
will be back to having only one printed Amiga publication, Amazing
Computing, a 48 page monthly.  Sweden will have none.

However, we're happy to point out that Swedes, Canadians, Americans, and
Mexicans alike will still be able to get Amiga Report, every two weeks, as
usual.

The potential for new enterprisers to step into the void is quite high.
Already in North America, at least two independent projects are underway to
launch Amiga magazines as early as February.  Whether or not they
materialize, we'll be here.

On a more upbeat note, I was thrilled to get word that the first Amiga
4000Ts have been delivered to SMG, the North American distributors for
Amiga Technologies, and will be shipped to dealers overnight, if requested.
These will be the first new Amigas in the New World after a 20 month
hiatus.  Hopefully, 4000Ts will make their way to the rest of the world as
1200s make their way out of Europe.

We will do our best to provide an in-depth look at the 4000T, which to date
is by far the least visible Amiga (with less than 1000 Commodore units
worldwide) but seems to be the key to preserving the Amiga's chances as a
high-end machine.

World of Amiga Toronto is less than two weeks away, and may interfere
slightly with AR's publication schedule.  However, we will complete two
issues in December, for a total of 24 on the year.  (Remember, while the
last issue of the year will be 3.23, ARAuction came out in April, or have
you blocked that brutal period out of your memory yet?) Averaging two a
month isn't bad.  :)

Read up.

[In this case, it's Writer Mail.  Thomas provided one of our insightful
looks at the Cologne Amiga show last issue, and these details just barely
missed our release time for AR 3.20. -Jason]

As a side note: I forgot to mention that I also saw a protoype MPEG decoder
for the Squirrel interface in an external box, I think it played a Star
Trek movie.  Availability or price unknown.

Also, I managed to get the CD-ROM player going with ShapeShifter, for this
I used the empcd.device included with the ShapeShifter archive and the NEC
CD-ROM driver available from (amongst others) the Next Generation BBS.
This is a ShapeShifter support site, Tel.: +49-261-805012 or +49-261-84280.
It recognizes a 'PC' ISO-9660 disc I bought and even the CD32 version of
Impossible Mission 2025.  I don't have any Mac HFS discs yet, but those
should be supported even without the NEC driver on the Mac side.

   Well here are my two cents on the Amiga situation and where I would like
to see things go.

1.  Compatibility, I would like to see some of it retained but not to
include everything.  We all know that the loss of demos and games could be
made up in no time, and if you do not believe that just look at the new
files that come into aminet every day.  A good point of cut off is the 2.04
OS or even the 3.1, as these are the places where the OS really started
straitening itself out.  Aga could be included as long as no one had to
bend over backwards or have to pay through the wallet for it.  Not to sound
condescending but the official word from Commodore with 2.04+ were not to
bang the hardware.  Tough lesson, maybe.

2.  Since we are getting new cpus lets see a better serial port.  RTG is a
definite must too. 

3.  64 bit system, I do not know how feasible this would be but I think
that it would keep amiga on the cutting edge of computers again.  (only
considering home computers).  To make room for the power pc a rewrite for
the OS needs to be made anyway, I sure do now want a non native OS. 

4.  Custom chips, I think that they should be left in.  I hear a lot of
people who complain about what they represent, 1985 technology.  If they
were put on a board so they were removable and RTG implemented, the
ultimate system could be had.  The most troublesome thing that I hear is
how a lot of people want the next amiga to use regular SVGA cards.  
Doesn't it sound like we will then just be following the clones.  When the
Amiga came out it had a 32 bit OS, no one had that, there wasn't a home
computer that could touch the graphics, and lets not forget sound.  Now it
just seems like some people just want to follow the industry.  3d chip sets
seem the way to go to me, now I have no problem with using standard
components and chips that are available, but I still want to be able to do
things like have a ntsc screen and pull it down and view my vga, pal, etc.
screen at the same time.  Basically use standard components to make a VERY
unstandard custom chipset. 

   The only reason that the amiga is still around is that it might be a
little outdated but it is still not far off of the mark, and the machine
was basically designed in 85.  I want the next Amiga that I buy to still be
at the cutting edge 10 years later while clones and macs are still trying
to catch up.  To do this we need AT to really take a hard look at what will
be coming in 10 years and try and put it in the Amiga now so that we can
look other users in the eye again and say can your machine do this, I think
not.   AT lead us into the future, not let us follow!

Subject: Amiga advantages

Reading Nickolas Marentes' article in AR 319 brought back a few memories. 
Memories of last Saturday, actually, when I moved some more stuff from my
old and now unused A500 to my PC.  Apart from the hassle of renaming files
(actually, I think that OS/2 has an LHA or LZH compatible archiver, so I
could have used that, and just pack and unpack with the full names -- but
it's too late for this), I again encountered the one valuable Amiga feature
that I haven't seen in any other OS -- regular expression filenames.  I
mistakenly copied a bunch of files without renaming them, so I wanted to
erase them, but keep the file "list", so I just did "delete a:~(list)" and
it did what I wanted ("a:" is my PC compatible drive).  How I miss this
feature.

Nickolas mentions the MPEG cards for the PC.  In fact, MPC3, the next
multimedia standard (i.e., the minimum hardware necessary for playing new
games) will include a 75MHz Pentium, Quad-speed drive, MPEG and a wavetable
card.  And shortly many PCs will actually arrive in this configuration,
likely for under $2000.  AmiTech will have to work hard and quickly to have
the Amiga show any comparable qualities.

Regarding Jake Hamby's open letter to AmiTech, I have a few comments.  
First of all, regarding the target audience, I think he's a bit off.  I
have no doubt that I know less than Mr.  Hamby when it comes to the
American market, but somehow I'm doubting that Unix users will flock to the
Amiga.  The PC happens to be cheaper and more powerful, and has enough Unix
clones of its own.  With PC ethernet cards being extremely cheap, and very
high resolution/multi colour graphics cards are much cheaper than Amiga
equivalents, and with Unix users typically not interested in any other OS
(good as AmigaDOS may be), I can't see the Amiga as a very attractive
proposition. 

The other targets may well be valid, but they are not in the consumer
market.  If the American public is only interested in power at a low price,
instead of functionality, then I can't see how the Amiga can succeed
(considering the success of the PC, innovation is not what the American
public wants). 

Regarding hardware innovations, I'm again not sure if it'll work.  One can
try, I suppose, but I think it'll be more beneficial to start with standard
technology, like a quad speed CD-ROM drive -- this is cheaper than the ZIP
drive, and the cost for companies to distribute software on CD-ROM is way
cheaper than on a ZIP drive (or even on diskettes).  When the CD-ROM drive
is there, the ZIP could be given as an option, with bundled backup
software.

Okay, I'm already going more with what I want than with what the American
public wants (which I'm not sure anybody really knows).  So the other thing
I want is an upgradable processor, like on the PC.  I admit, a processor
without an MMU won't run UNIX, but most PC users don't run UNIX, and I
don't want it, either.  A low clock 68EC040 will probably cost less than a
fast 68030 (the 68EC040 cost $50 in 1K quantity a year or two ago), and
will probably run faster (just like the 486SX replaced the 386 in the PC
world).  The great thing about the 68EC040 is that you can easily upgrade
by swapping a full 68040 in, or even a 68060 (although a small daughter
board might be required).  This also saves designing a special 68030 board
for the A4000, or using a 68030 board for the 68040 (making memory access
slower than possible for the 68040).

For the above expandability reason I'd also like to see a 68EC030 in the
A1200.  It won't give any significant speed increase over the current
68EC020, but it will be easily upgradable to a full 68030.  Add build in
memory expansion, and you can at last leave the single expansion port for
graphics cards, hardware PC emulators, and so on, cards which nobody today
develops, simply because the port is reserved for processor and memory
expansion.

From: Gabriele Peterle 338446/IF <ray@maya.dei.unipd.it>
Subject: Hello from Italy !

Hi Jason,
a big CIAO to you and all the AR readers!  After I looked at the empty
Reader's Mail column in AR3.19, I decide to write something, so here is my
short opinion about the Amiga today.

My name is Gabriele Peterle (if you don't remember me look at AR2.27). 
Many things have changed since then, something in better, something in
worse.

I see the Amiga's situation has get better (what's worse than be dead ?  ;)
; I think the AT team is working quite good, in particular because they are
a small company.

Obviously I would like to have _now_ a Power Amiga but this is impossible,
thus I will wait until I can (my trusty 500 is at the beginning of "her"
8th winter but her 030/882 hearts are still beating regularly : the doctor
says the pulse are 33.000.000/second; a little over(clocked) but her body
is responding well; she runs the MIle in 0.184 seconds and the MFLOP in
1.136 seconds :D ).

The problems are for the people who want buy a new computer today; the
Amiga is unknown, now more than a year ago, by the large computer users;
plus, the Amiga offer is quite small (in quantity, but not in quality) and
the Mac&Clone offer, instead, is bigger than ever (in quantity, but not in
quality ;).  So if someone of you must jump ship today I don't blame you,
but be ready to jump back when we'll overtake you with our rocket tomorrow
!  ;)

I see the BeBox as a "fire exit"; if there will be a fire (=> no more
Amigas) I'll escape through it, but until then....  ( NOTE: before the
BeBox creation there was no possible escape !  I would be killed by a PC !
).

AT has to work hard in the research, development, production and marketing
sides (and I'm almost sure they will do), and us, Amiga users, have to
support our "friends" (and I'm sure I will do).

AT, I hope to be introduced soon to one of your "powerful girls" !  ;)

..hEy..nO!...WhAT arE yOu doiNg ?  ...gIVe me BACk thE CoNtROl oF The sHIfT
keY...No i'M noT uNFaiThfUl !...oK, ok I pRoMIse iT; I wOn't LEavE YOu
aPArt; You'Ll bE ConNeCTed toGEtHeR !...Ok?........  .....Phew!...  ( my
500 is very jealous!  :)

Again, these are only words, but again I had some fun writing it and it
wouldn't been so if there wouldn't been the AMIGA.

Thanks.
Ciao.
                        Gabriele

@node NEWS2 "Virus Checker"
@toc NEWS

For immediate and sudden rlease.

The source code to Virus_Checker is now for sale to anyone that can offer a
good figure for it. It is in Macro68 style and conforms to the new syntax.

The reason.

After the release of 8.3 I got alot of abusive e-mail messages saying VC
did not do this, and vc did not do that, and the install script does not
work, and hundreds of is this a real release message.

My time is limited at present and I get very little time to even get to my
computer let alone program it. My email is backing up something awful in
my mailbox.

Another reason is that VC is no longer a hobby. A hobby is something you do
that gives you enjoyment. VC does not do this anymore. If it paid for
itself then it may be different.

Whats happening with the keyfiles?

The keyfile will be left in (the pirates will probably take it out anyway
and that is one further reason), if I did take it out all those who
registered would be disadvantaged.  I will still take and send out
registrations as they come in.  I may even release one or 2 more bug fixes
as I get time and add a few more viruses.

This decision was about a month in the making but it has been made.

@toc NEWS

====================================================================
Amiga-Link              PRESS RELEASE               October 25, 1995
====================================================================

          The AmigaLink 2.0 / Envoy 2.0 Networking Package
          -------------------------------------------------

AmiTrix Development announced today that they will now be
distributing the Amiga-Link/Envoy networking package for all Amigas.
Arrangements have been made with Intangible Assets Manufacturing
(IAM), and with ABF Computer GbR, that will see "Envoy 2.0" bundled
together with an updated, fully translated version of "AmigaLink",
to be assembled and distributed by AmiTrix.

Amiga-Link is a complete solution to your Amiga peer-to-peer
networking needs. With the included software and hardware, you can
share your hard drives and printers, as well as run other network
applications.  This package is compatible with all Amiga models,
using the floppy port for maximum compatibility across models,
and keeping other ports available for their intended uses.
Low cost "rendering farms" are now possible.

The Amiga-Link package comes with both the standard AmigaLink
software and also the Amiga Envoy software.  The Amigalink
software's advantage is that it works with AmigaOS1.3, providing
compatibility with older machines, whereas Amiga Envoy requires 2.04
or higher, but provides superior performance, device sharing, and an
API that allows for the development of third-party networking
applications, with many already available.

Amiga-Link provides a less expensive method of peer to peer
networking using compact modules connected to the external floppy
port and linked together with BNC connectors and coaxial cables.
The SANA-II device driver allows all Amiga's (including those
without Zorro-II expansion slots), to be connected in a network
of up to 20 machines, within a distance of 330 feet (100m).
DMA data transfer, at 450,000 bps from network to memory, avoids
CPU contention common to the parallel/serial port networks, and
leaves these ports free for normal use.  This is roughly equivalent
to ArcNet speed, and although slower than ethernet, is less than
half the cost.

The AmigaLink software has GUI tools for Workbench control of
Import & Export functions, network Statistics & Diagnostics tools
for testing and troubleshooting both hardware & software, while a
Printer Spooler program allows for network printer sharing.
Its SANA-II compatibility allows other software to be run
concurrently such as AmiTCP, providing great flexibility when
networking various Amiga's together.  A newly revised English manual
is included.

Amiga Envoy is the standard Amiga peer-to-peer networking software
that was developed by Commodore's Amiga Networking Group.  Its
performance, user-interface and API are consistent with the
philosophy of the Amiga Operating System.  Amiga Envoy provides
a simple messaging interface for the easy development of reliable
network applications.  Included applications enable connected Amiga
computers to share their hard disks, CD-ROMs, and printers
transparently.  Third-party applications can also provide extra
functionality such as electronic mail, remote computer access,
multi-user databases and multi-player games.

New features for Envoy 2.0 include support of AmigaOS 2.04 DOS
packet types (including notification and record locking), support
for removable media, enhanced reliability & robust recovery,
localization, AmigaGuide documentation, and more.

MSRP for the basic 2 unit package is $299.00 US, or $379.00 CAN.

Expansion kits, cable options and accesories are also available.
Dealer and Educational Institution inquiries welcomed.

TITLE

  Disect - Symbolic dissassembler & debugger.

VERSION

  2.0 (11.11.95)

AUTHOR

  Dave M. Alderson
  email: dave@twilite.demon.co.uk

DESCRIPTION

  Disect is a very powerful combined disassembler/debugger program,
  which has been designed to be easy to use. Its power is achieved at the
  expense of memory: the minimum requirement is 1Mb; for larger projects,
  2Mb will be required.

  The debugger allows an executable file, a disk boot-block, a binary 
  file, or an area of memory to be loaded and created as a Process. It is
  even possible to grab an existing memory-resident Process. A Process's 
  instructions can be executed individually, or the Process can be 
  activated, with or without breakpoints installed. System exceptions can
  be trapped before they crash the machine, and program symbols can be 
  read from executable files.

  The disassembler allows a loaded program to be commented, have blank 
  lines inserted, and have it's numbers and addresses replaced with 
  constant or program symbols. All the symbols of Release 3 of the system
  include files are available to the disassembler. A program which has 
  been dissected in this way can then be saved as two source files: a 
  program file, and a support file. The support file will contain EQUs for
  all required constant symbols.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  Disect requires Release 2 of the Amiga operating system; it also 
  requires the ASL library, and GadTools library.

AVAILABILITY

  ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/pub/aminet/dev/debug/Disectv20b.lha (283158)

PRICE

  Requested shareware fee is 20 uk pounds.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

  The version available on aminet is a 98% functional demo version which 
  is freely distributable, but remains copyrighted D.M. Alderson 1995.

  If there are any further queries regarding this software or its usage 
  please email, dave@twilite.demon.co.uk, who will be only too happy to 
  chat with you.

MAC Emulation Professional

November 16th, 1995  -  Official Press Release

Utilities Unlimited International, Incorporated is pleased to announce
it is now taking orders for their latest emulation module for EMPLANT.

The new module is named, "MAC Emulation Professional" and offers a
wider range of Macintosh emulation capabilities.  Although much of
code is based on the previous MAC emulation, the new code is completely
new, smaller, and faster.  Besides the standard features you have
come to expect from our previous MAC emulation, these additional
features make this emulation module worth having:

 * Completely new OS2.x+ style guide compliant user interface, using
   gadtools.

 * Opens on a public screen.  No more custom screens.

 * ASL is now used for all file requesters.

 * Built-in help when using OS3.0 or later.

 * Support for all known 512K-1meg 680x0 color MAC ROM's.  This
   includes ROMS from: MAC II/x/cx/ci/si, LC, LCII, LCIII, color
   classic, Quadra 700-950.  All ROM's work with CPU caches on.
   All ROM's will support an FPU, whether designed to or not.

 * Virtual memory support!

 * MAC OS is partially re-written so it does not constantly busy loop,
   giving the Amiga side more CPU time and allowing lower priority
   tasks to run (such as screen blankers and auto disk changes).

 * Support for EtherTalk and other EtherNet based applications when
   using a SANA-II compliant EtherNet driver.

 * Built-in support for CD-ROM's not connected to EMPLANT's SCSI port.

 * Faster interrupt and exception handling.

 * Enhanced video driver support (larger sizes, more colors).

 * Enhanced file transfer capabilities (ability to set filetype and
   creator, filename filtering, and more).

 * Enhanced multitasking code prevents Amiga serial.device lockups.

 * Enhanced sound support.  You can set the emulation to use the
   Amiga's audio exclusively, or shared (audio channels can be stolen
   by the Amiga if necessary).

 * New custom logic chip improves bus timing, boosting performance
   and reliability of EMPLANT's VIA interrupts, serial communications,
   and SCSI operations.

 * New utilities, and much, much more!

This package includes the new software, updated documentation, and
a new custom logic chip that replaces and existing chip on your
EMPLANT board.

|      GLOBAL         SYSTEM-FILE         NAME         REGISTRY       |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

Amiga programmers have been creating *.library files for over 10
years now, and quite a few times over that period there have been
conflicts between the names of these files. So The International
Amiga Society would like to receive suggestions and comments from
software developers about the feasibility of setting up a global
system file name registry. 

    With a global name registry, before you create a catalog
file, a device file, a library file or any other system file you
would check with the registry whether there was already an existing
file of that name somewhere, and maybe register a file name for your
own use. Ideally such a system would foster greater compatibility
between different Amiga products, both commercial and public domain
products. It would provide a framework for conflict resolution
which does not involve the end user (as it does now), although no
mechanism for this currently exists. And it would remove one area of
worry for Amiga programmers.

    Given that such a registry is of immeditate (although perhaps small)
benefit to the Amiga community, that running it would cost little
in terms of time and resources, The International Amiga Society would
be an ideal vehicle for such a system. It is with this in mind that
we hereby request for appropriate discussion of the issues involved
and any other concerns that you might have to take place. Once the
issues become clear, the IAS will take steps to ensure that such
a system is put in place.

PRESS RELEASE

1. Imagine one of the following :

- You are using one of those small programs that reside in the c: directory
and suddenly the result of the program's execution is something
unpredictable, usually causing destruction of hours' hard work (of course
the same can happen for any other program).  What has happened?  You have
just discovered a bug.

- You are using a program that fulfills your needs in every aspect.  It's
one of those programs that are worth registering (a shareware one) or even
buying (a commercial one).  You believe the author should get some
thanks/cash for his excellent work.

- You just bought a new piece of hardware/software and something is wrong
with it.  The company/dealer which you bought the hardware/software from
must be informed.

- A new program has been released and you want more info about it.  What a
better way than to ask the company responsible for it?  That way you could
also get answers to many questions of yours regarding the actual program
and you might get it delivered at you home, if you decide to buy it.

What do you do in the above cases?

You start searching your F/H Disks for the appropriate manual, and if you
are not lucky enough to have all the manuals well organised, then the night
to come is gonna be a long one.  Bypassing this problem you finnaly find
the manual, so you start searching for the author's/company's contact
address.  But how many times have you found what you were looking for?  I
guess not many.  And when you finally find it, you discover that you have
spent so many hours in searching.

Also, as most of you know, lists of BBS/Newsgroups/Mailing Lists already
exist in the Internet, but now there is a chance of collecting them all
together in one big list, providing also any extra info that might be
missing.

PRESS RELEASE

In the beginning of 1994 "PXL COMPUTERS" of Canada set a goal to create a
team consisting of experts in the fields of programming, art, and music. 
This team was a marriage of immensely creative forces, and was christened
"CLICK BOOM".  It was conceived to cause the revolution in computer games
of tomorrow...

            ....Tomorrow is here.

The very first game from "Click Boom" team to be presented to the world is
a visually stunning combat epic entitled CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.  Distribution
of the game is being negotiated with several major publishing companies.  
Capital Punishment should be in stores toward the end of 1995.

---------------
W A R N I N G !
---------------

CAPITAL PUNISHMENT CONTAINS SCENES OF EXTREMELY REALISTIC VIOLENCE AND
GORE.  "PXL COMPUTERS" DOES NOT RECOMMEND THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE FOR
CHILDREN OR SENSITIVE PERSONS.

The plot:
---------
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT - 1.Vitally harmful severe treatment 
                       or suffering;

You are a warrior about to embark on a most dangerous journey.   Your goal
is to dethrone the evil master of an immense castle.  You begin your
mission in rancid, putrid catacombs of this castle.   However, beware.  The
master is aware of your presence, and has placed guards on every floor.

You must work your way up to the top of the castle, and defeat all who
stand in your way in order to battle the master.  Helping you along will be
the spirit of your deceased mentor.  However, even with his aid, this will
without question be a physically-draining experience.  By journey's end,
you will be injured, bruised, and tired.  But if you think of the price of
failure, this is a small price to pay.  For should you lose a battle, you
will suffer a fate worse than death.   You see, the master does look
favorably upon assassins.

Thus, he has the power to make you immortal, and you will be forced to
serve him for eternity in this most unpleasant environment.  Even worse,
you will be confined to a single room, becoming one of his guards.  And,
that is the CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.

Technical data:
---------------
Capital Punishment is the most technically advanced and by far the most
playable fighting game on Amiga.  It features:

- a specially developed state-of-the-art bob routine with a real-time
  horizontal flip that can animate two large characters, covering a
  combined area of over 30,000 pixels, at a rate of 25 frames per second
- a horizontal scroll of 50 frames per second with acceleration and
  deceleration
- pixel-by-pixel drawn frames of perfectly smooth animation 
  for every character
- dazzling backgrounds in 256 colours from a palette 
  of 16.7 million
- fight against another player via modem over the telephone line.
- upgrading your warrior's moves as you progress in the game
- a unique zone editor that has been created to maximize 
  the combat experience through an advanced collision detection 
  system using four collision zones (head, body, legs, and attack) 
  for every character in every frame
- semi-transparent 3D shadow  that casts itself on the characters 
  and the floor by following the characters' movements 
  at the rate of 25 frames per second. Depending on the distance, 
  angle or position of the main light source, the shadow deforms 
  over walls, staircases, etc.
- additional visual effects such as:
  realistic blood animation;
  red screen flash after every blow;
  screen shakes after a player is punched or falls;
  screen scroll with every move;
- keyboard redefine option
- a stunning soundtrack and sound FX
- many secret things to discover for yourself

----------------------------------------------------------
WATCH OUT FOR A FULLY PLAYABLE DEMO OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT!

             COMING SOON TO A BBS NEAR YOU...

  programs (like ReOrg) not recognize the scsi-drives. It also
  removes the long(!) boot-delay and is able to install a work-
  around for the memory-bug, which can cause a heavy system-crash
  if two SIMMs are installed.

NEW FEATURES

  The registered version (39.3) is able to replace 'PrepareEmul'
  which does not work on most Blizzard 1230 I/II boards.
  'PrepareEmul' is required for ShapeShifter MAC-Emulation (c) by
  Christian Bauer (aminet/misc/emu/ShapeShift*).

  For registration-info get v39.2 from aminet or contact the author.

[From Wonder Computers, information on reaching the World of Amiga show
next weekend without taking an expensive taxi. -Jason]

Here are instructions for getting to the World of Amiga at the Toronto
International Centre of Commerce using the public transit (TTC or Toronto
Transit Commission) from downtown Toronto.  Take a subway to the Lawrence
West subway station.  There, transfer onto the Malton bus (#58B) which
takes you eventually onto Airport Road and actually makes a stop directly
in front of the Tor.  Int.  Centre of Commerce.  Along the way, the bus
driver will ask for $2 as an extra fee for the longer distance required to
go from Metro Toronto to Mississauga (where the World of Amiga is being
held).

===========================================================================
          A Trip To Be, Inc. (or: Mr. Compton Goes To Menlo Park)
                            By: {" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

[We ran this article in AR 3.20...but neglected to create a button for it.
Oops. -Jason]

Schedules and plans can turn out to be funny things.  I was supposed to be
at the Cologne Computer '95 show (commonly, but not really accurately,
referred to as the WOA), but that didn't work out.  I found out, after the
fact, that I could have called in a favor to go out to the Toaster show.

Luckily for me, we've had so many reports for both shows in I almost feel
like I was there.  Equally lucky, the weekend didn't go wasted.  I was able
to change plans and get myself a trip to Menlo Park, home of the suddenly
de-cloaked Be, Incorporated.

For those who aren't aware of Be or their first product, the BeBox, here's
a quick summary.  Be, Inc. was founded in 1990 by Jean-Louis Gassee, who
left Apple as a head engineering exec.  His company set to work to create a
new computer platform on the premise that multiprocessing is a good thing.
To that end, the BeOS was geared to take advantage of up to 8 of them,
initially AT&T's Hobbit RISC, later the Motorola/IBM/Apple PowerPC.  The
BeBox is the first computer to implement the BeOS, and sports PCI and ISA
busses, SCSI and IDE as standard, and a boatload of onboard I/O including
stereo in and out, MIDI, and IR ports.  The box is driven by two PowerPC
603 chips.

Be's staff hit the computer world with a blitz, first at a trade show and
then with extensive information on the net.  With such touted features as a
multithreaded, pre-emptively multitasking OS with all the niceties like
memory protection Amiga users have been asking for and compatibility with
industry standard (read: inexpensive) video cards, monitors, and
peripherals, my interest was caught.  Besides, at the time I heard about
it, the PowerAmiga announcement hadn't been made yet.

So I did some talking with Gassee and he arranged a flight for me.  (It was
on United, which isn't nearly as nice as Kiwi, but I'm not going to get
picky now.)  I arrived at San Francisco airport, took a limo out to the
office building, and went in.

I had envisioned their office might be in a 15-story glass and metal cube
building where all sorts of companies would sneer at me behind closed doors
with all sorts of top secret technology I'd never see.  (This is, after
all, Silicon Valley.)  Fortunately, it was a much more tame building than
that and Be had the entire third floor so there was a minimum of
intimidation.  (There were an awful lot of mirrors on the first floor, but
nothing I couldn't handle.)

So there I was.  Maureen Hendrickson, the office administrative assistant,
fetched Gassee, and off he went to grab Melissa Rogers, Project Manager,
Benoit Schilling, 5-year Be veteran in software, and another gentleman
whose name escapes me.  Gassee and I held a brief meeting, and then I was
whisked off for a short tour of the office floor (very sparsely furnished,
lots of old couches and tables, though.)  Then came the demo.

The BeBox was set up in a special room designated for demos.  They have a
pretty high-quality stereo setup in there, along with a prototype BeBox
case, an old Hobbit-based machine, and the demo unit, housed in an open
case under the table.  The machine was equipped with a PCI GXE #9 graphics
card running at 800x600x256 (presently, the maximum implemented
resolution), a standard ISA PC Ethernet card, and a special keyboard/mouse
ISA card hacked up for temporary use, as there has been a software problem
with the Be's standard ports.  In addition, there was some rather large
amount of disk space and 32 megs of memory.

Screenshots of the BeOS are available on Be's web site (listed later on.)
But a description of the "feel" is in order.  The influence of the Mac
System isn't very hard to find--the general paradigm is the same.  There's
the single-screen desktop, windows that open on it, and tasks that switch
either by clicking on their window or by selecting them from a list,
accessed in the upper left hand corner of the screen.  Amiga users will
feel pretty at home opening up a "newsh", though, a bash variant shell that
has full control over the filesystem.  In fact, the entire OS is so tightly
threaded through the built-in database that, for example, renaming a folder
in a shell will immediately update all on-screen GUI references to that
folder.

My demo "chaperone" proceeded to show off various aspects of the BeBox--the
speed of a Mandelbrot recalculation, the musical capabilities, and the
interprocess clipping.  Then, of course, all of them at once (two
Mandelbrot zooms while two MIDI tracks and a sampled CD track played with
three animation windows running.)  Yes, the system slowed down (you could
watch the processors fall out of sync in the Mandelbrot zooms, since each
processor handles odd/even lines.)  But it kept chugging along, rather
nicely, too.  All the while the old Hobbit box next to me ran a
landscape-generating screen saver that hid an old texture-mapped game demo
that wasn't exactly stable.

Then it was time for more important things, like lunch.  Over lunch, about
a dozen Be employees gathered around.  We discovered that I was the only
person present who hadn't worked for Apple in some way in my lifetime.  Of
course, the "God I hated Apple I'm so glad I'm not there anymore" stories
started flying...and there was something very eerily familiar about them.
Stories of incompetent, overbearing engineering management.  Stories of
over-delayed product releases (Melissa was the Project Manager for Mac's
Copland OS prior to coming to Be.  She told us that her Apple sources
indicate Copland will likely be as late as December 1997.)

I got myself back behind the wheels of the BeBox for a bit longer after
lunch...played around with the GUI and shell (you are arbitrarily limited
to opening up 6 shells.  Sorry to those Amiga folks who like opening up
dozens of shells to see how many you can get, but they just set a limit and
are done with the matter), and then with a Descent-like game in beta stage.
All very fluid.  The TCP stack seemed competent, as was their quickie web
browser that was whipped up in-house.

I spent time talking at length with Joe Palmer, head of hardware for Be.
He described the production process (contracted out to a company who
profited from an Apple loss, buying up a highly modern but abandoned
production facility of theirs) and walked me through the motherboard.  We
also did a lot of talking about the face of the computer marketplace, the
future of the Web, and earthquakes.

Gassee and I had some time to talk again afterwords.  He reiterated what
he's been saying all along, that the BeBox is for computer enthusiasts,
hackers, and those who aren't looking to just run Microsoft Office.
They're not expecting to put a computer in every home, just in the homes of
people who don't want the everyday.  And the cost of admission reflects it,
at least for now--a base unit is $1600, and that comes with essentially
just the motherboard and I/O card, you supply graphics, memory, storage,
and monitor.  Be projects about $2500 for a "reasonably equipped" machine
of 16 megs of memory and the other accessories.  16 megs is definitely a
must, as the 32-meg BeBox--which wasn't running any major items worth
noting--took about 11 megs to boot.  The minimum OS footprint is 4.5 megs.

I talked for a while with CK, Be's head of developer support.  A veteran of
Apple dev support, CK was largely concerned with how to get the next 670
machines to the developers that want them.  (a dozen already have them.)
We also talked at length about the Web and how it made his job infinitely
easier--no more phone calls or mass mailings, just put it on the web site
and be done with it.  The BeBox is definitely for the networked crowd, or
as Gassee put it, "If you come into my shop and want to buy a BeBox, but
don't have an Internet account, I don't want you to buy one."

After about 5 hours in the company of the Be staff and machines, it was
time to call it a night.  I did have dinner with Benoit the following
night, where it was time to buckle down and get to some more meaty issues,
like...

Q: Is Be really going to focus on selling their operating system over selling
machines, as the web site indicates they're inclined to do?

A: Well, Benoit doesn't think so, anyway.  It could easily go either way,
but he and I are in agreement that we just don't see it being overly
attractive to buy an operating system.

Q: How easy/difficult is it to add extra processors to the BeOS, since
you're supposed to be able to use up to 8 in the OS?

A: At least at first, there will have to be specific OS versions for any
extra processors (and extra machines, since there is no provision for
changing processors on the BeBox).  They are considering doing a generic
version that would simply adjust to its environment, but memory overhead
issues come into play.

Q: Are there going to be, say, Unix variants ported to the BeBox?

A: Benoit feels it would be such a difficult task it wouldn't really be
worth the trouble, but the logic analyzers are available to developers if
they really want to give it a shot...

There was also quite a bit of questioning coming FROM Be about the Amiga,
both on Thursday from the staff (including Be's webmaster who wanted to
make sure Amiga users would have access to the Be developer manual) and
from Benoit Friday night.  But that's only fair, they paid for me to pick
their brains.  Quite a lot of the response to their product announcement
came from Amiga users, but the subsequent announcement of upcoming PowerPC
Amiga development has quelled that surge somewhat.

So, the question I've been asked a lot is, "Is the BeBox the next Amiga?"
Well, it all depends on what you think the Amiga is.  If the Amiga is doing
amazing things with relatively limited resources, the answer is clearly
no--Amiga Technologies is shipping machines with less than half the memory
the BeOS needs to BOOT.  If you see the Amiga as simply being an example of
a well-constructed alternative in the computer market, then the answer is
yes, after a sense.  The BeBox isn't going to be touted as a giant-killer,
there are no plans to target Compaq, IBM, Dell, and Microsoft and take them
out of commission.  At least in Europe, the Amiga is aimed a bit more at
these sorts of markets than the Be is.  

On the other hand, the Be has the hardware advantage at the moment--Dave
Haynie has implicitly and explicitly said that the BeBox is a rough example
of where the Amiga SHOULD be now, all things going according to plan and
there not being an extended suspension of Amiga development.

Is the BeBox a good reason to throw your Amiga out the window?  Mine's
staying planted on my desk.  But just when it seemed that the Amiga might
fade away into obscurity for good and the face of Windows would overwhelm
the landscape, Be came out with a pretty impressive bang.  Competition in
the computer market pleases me, and I think it may have been directly
responsible for Amiga Tech's sudden willingness to talk a bit more
specifically about the future.

I saw a lot of good things.  I saw a compact but loose company with a group
of talented people who enjoy working with each other and believe in what
they're working on.  I saw a machine that had a real personality and feel
to it (No, no dragging screens up and down, but it has a feel), a real
viable alternative to the Intel/Microsoft wave, a potential ally against a
common foe, you might say.  And I saw the reason AmiTech's been more open
to their customers.  So the trip was a success, even if I didn't walk out
with a new computer.


The Flip Side: Of course, there are always those details that are worth
mentioning that just don't fit the flow of the article...

Robert Reiswig (who co-authored one of the VTU Expo reports in this issue)
and I got together Saturday night for a drive and a couple of rounds of
Virtual Worlds Battletech.  As far as we can tell, it's still all driven by
Amiga 500s, and there were lots of 1084Ses in sight.  Rob pretty much blew
me away most of the time, but I did finish with 5 kills versus 6 times
killed, and kept my score in the positive numbers.

Two Be employees, at different times, pointed out that one of the things
they remembered the most about the Amiga was the screen dragging.

The BeBox has an application that allows you to monitor the processor
usage.  You can also shut off a processor to watch the load increase
(useful for debugging, I'm told.)  You can also shut BOTH of them off.
Oops.

I didn't get heckled wearing either my Amiga (PC-Task) or Be t-shirts over
the weekend.  Man, it's really different being in the Silicon Valley.

Most people would claim to know quite a lot about Commodore.  There's a lot
of myths, a lot of bullshit, and a lot of lies.  And now, as Commodore
enters a new (final?) era of it's existence, it's probably a good time to
take a good look at where the company came from.

Commodore, like so many of the modern computing giants, didn't start out in
computing at all.  Commodore originally wasn't even in the electrical
retail market, like Sinclair or Amstrad, but in typewriters.

It all started when a young soldier at the USA Fort Dix showed a talent for
unjamming typewriters.  Whilst his piers were busy pretending to shoot each
other and playing war games, Jack Tramiel was sorting out more basic
problems with the army Hermes's.  Not a talent to build an empire on, but
when Tramiel left the army, he set up his own typewriter repair business in
the Bronx.  To supplement his income, he also moonlighted as a cab driver.

Business went slowly but steadily, until Tramiel pulled off a deal with
Czechoslovakia to assemble typewriters in Canada.  The family upped it's
roots and moved to Toronto, whilst Tramiel laid the founding stones of
Commodore International.

Shortly afterward, it occurred to Tramiel that he may as well sell his own
typewriters as someone else.  It cut out the middle man - more profit, less
effort.  So he took over a typewriter manufacturing concern in Berlin, and
added to the growing empire that was Commodore.  At that time, the business
world of the States and Europe was being flooded by cheap mechanical adding
machines from Japan.  Showing off his talent for listening to his
customers, Tramiel moved into the delights of adding machines.

In 1962, the company was successful enough to go public.  Entitled
Commodore Business Machines, Canada, Tramiel was the president, and the
chairman and banker was the president of Atlantic Acceptance Corporation,
C.  Powell Morgan.

Three years later, C.  Powell Morgan was publicly condemned by a Canadian
Royal Commission for "his defiance of all accepted business principles" and
acts of "rapacious and unprincipled manipulation".  Whether this was
justified is a matter of opinion, but the failure to meet payments on a $5
million short-term loan didn't help his case.  Unfortunately (or
fortunately, depending on how you view the story), Morgan died of leukaemia
before he could be tried in court.  The Commission also took a good long
look at Commodore and Tramiel.  It wasn't entirely convince of his
innocence in the Morgan's affairs, but decided not to indict him.  The bad
publicity didn't help Commodore's position in the market, however.  Money
was becoming tight, and the outlook was becoming bleak for Tramiel.

A lifeline came when a Canadian investor, Irving Gould, agreed to buy a
substantial stake in Commodore, in return for the position of Chairman.
The new team of Gould and Tramiel set to work on building commodore's
position.

The adding machine business was becoming a dead duck.  The Japanese had the
market almost sewn up.  As a last-ditch attempt, Gould suggested that
Tramiel take a trip to Japan, and get a little first-hand experience of the
market.  Whilst over there, Tramiel saw, for the first time, the new
electronic desk-top calculator.

Recognising the potential in the calculators, he foresaw the end of volume
sales for mechanical adding machines.  As soon as he returned, commodore's
strategy was shifted away from adding machines, and onto electronic
calculators.

For the first time in months, fortune smiled on Commodore.  It was
Tramiel's company who took the first electronic pocket calculator onto the
market, using a Bowmar LED display, and a Texas Instruments integrated
chip.  Only Clive Sinclair could improve on the design years later, by
significantly reducing the power consumption and miniaturising the whole
package.

Suddenly, everyone went calculator crazy.  Machines, equivalent in power to
those that are now given away free with gallons of petrol and insurance
quotes, were sold for $100+, then a perfectly reasonable price.  Commodore,
by now used to running into problems, ran into a big one.  Texas
Instruments, Commodore's chief supplier of the main chips in the
calculators, took a leaf out of Tramiel's book.  "Cutting out the middle
man", they launched their own range of calculators.  Of course, they used
their own chips at a fraction of the cost, and this had a disastrous effect
on Commodore.

Chips prices dropped from $12 to a buck each.  Commodore had warehouses
full of calculators built containing chips at the old price.  After years
of steadily increasing profits, 1975 showed Commodore making a $5 million
loss on sales of nearly $50 million.  It taught Tramiel and Gould a lesson:
relying on outside suppliers for key components was risky.  Tramiel
commented later: "From there on, I felt the only way to continue in the
electronics business was to control our own destiny."

Easier said than done, at those times; the calculator and semi-conductor
markets were risky and unpredictable.  Gould, once again, came to
Commodore's rescue by personally guaranteeing a $3 million loan, giving
Commodore enough buying power to take over MOS Technology in November 1976.
MOS, a struggling manufacturer of calculator and other semiconductors, was
only one of a series of acquisitions: Frontier, a Los Angeles manufacturer
of CMOS chips, and MDSA, a LCD maker, were snapped up as well.  This give
Commodore more experience in key technologies than firms many times
Commodore's size.  But the important acquisition was MOS Technology, which
became known as MosTek.  With the company came an unknown engineer, Chuck
Peddle.

A year before being taken over, the MosTek team had worked out an
improvement to Motorola's 6800.  They called it the 6502.

Legend has it that Tramiel was accosted in the corridor, one day, by Chuck
Peddle.  Peddle told Jack to, basically, forget about hand-held
calculators.  What about a desktop computer?

"Build it," said Tramiel, and the PET was born, using MosTek's 6502.

The announcement that Commodore were working on a computer was greeted by a
resounding silence.  At that time, early 1976, the US (micro)computer
market was made up of hobbyists; small-time engineers, working on the
kitchen table with soldering irons and home-made displays.

This didn't discourage Tramiel.  Working by his own idiom, "they [the
public] don't yet know what they need".

It's worth pointing out, at this point, that Tramiel could have easily
called the new machine the Personal Electronic Transactor.  But, by naming
it the PET, it tamed a device which was sure to bring out the technophobes
in even the most worldy of America's hobbyists.

The 8K PET was first shown at the Chicago Consumer Electronics Show in
1977.  It met an enthusiastic reception, but not without a
behind-the-scenes rush to get the PET ready for the show.  Chuck Peddle,
responsible for building the prototype, was under huge pressure to get the
machine ready and working in time for the show.  This is a classic instance
of the marketing boys driving the R&D unit.  Peddle crated up the
still-unfinished PET and transported it to the show.  After working for 3
solid days, without sleep, he managed to get the prototype working well
enough to display.

However well the machine itself worked, the word was out.  Within a few
months, Commodore was receiving 50 calls a day from dealers, all wanting to
sell the PET.  This demand for the machine allowed Commodore to dictate
terms to dealers.  Rather than allowing just anyone to sell the machine,
dealers had to demonstrate an excellent credit history, pay a cash deposit
on orders, and show they had a service engineer and a retail outlet. 
Tramiel also concentrated on selling the PET to the US and Europe
educational market.  Demand continued to grow, and Tramiel remembered his
marketing maxim about the middle man.  "Why bother with dealers?" he asked
himself.

Tramiel approached the big retails chain stores, and within a few weeks,
the right to sell Commodore products, which the dealers had fought so hard
to obtain, was practically meaningless.  The dealers were in direct
competition with the household names.

===========================================================================
                       Nova Design Online Conference
===========================================================================

jcompton > Bots and humans, please begin your logs.   Welcome, everyone, to
   the Amiga Report Nova Design Online conference.   Tonight we have Kermit
   Woodall, one third of Nova Design, the company that produces ImageFX
   2.1a, the premier image processing system for the Amiga.  This
   conference, in edited form, will appear in Amiga Report Magazine. 

NovaKermi > Thanks Jason, and other operators, for having us here.  I'd
   also like to thank all of the ImageFX users out there, as well as you
   FUTURE ImageFX owners! 

oleg > novakermit, thanks for joining, and when is the PPC port of IFX
   coming? 

NovaKermi > I assume you mean a Power Amiga port with Native Mode modules
   for ImageFX hooks and effects.  We're not telling.  :)

MrDaniel > When will the next version of ImageFX appear?  What new goodies
   will it have?

NovaKermi > Next MAJOR release of ImageFX is slated for sometime in the
   first half of 1996.  What it will contain is a closely guarded secret. 
   We don't really like to dicuss future features until we're right at
   shipping time as we don't always precisely know what will make the
   release.  This is often due to the fact that we work closely with other
   Amiga companies and with our own programmers right up to deadline on
   cutting-edge stuff that sometimes simply isn't done in time! 

LoboFX > Hi NOVA...  I want to ask you if you plan to have some more
   distribution around the world as the Amiga reaches new markets, like
   LatinAmerica, are you planning this?

NovaKermi > Distribution in other countries is always a goal of ours, but
   it's often simply that no distributor has approached us seriously.  We
   get lots of inquiries but few actually order.  We're in most all major
   non-US countries, but not in all AREAS of those countries. 

Babbage > why does imagefx seem to do some things real slowl?  all written
   in c?  And do you fell the amiga is a secure platform for you and you
   will be sticking with it?  (we hope)

NovaKermi > Some functions in ImageFX may seem slow, but that's because of
   what they are having to do.  As many many reviews have pointed out,
   ImageFX is as fast as it gets in effects!  ImageFX is written in C and
   Assembly.  We're a 100% Amiga company and we're doing very well thanks! 

Seed > Do you feel threatened by Photogenics in any way? :)

NovaKermi > No, why?  Photogenics has a very small subset of the features
   that ImageFX has.  In fact, since it has no ARexx, true region control,
   batch processing, virtual memory, support for non-Cybergraphx cards,
   scanner/framegrabber support, and so on, and since it's focus is on
   painting - whereas our focus is on batched image processing and effects,
   we're two different markets. 

Bagman > Image Studio has an uncrash utility which saves your buffers to
   disk when your Amiga crashes.  Any hope IFX can do something like that? 

NovaKermi > Email me a more detailed description and we'll look at putting
   it on "the list". 

IronDuck > I was going to ask what you think of Photogenics but you already
   seem to have answered that, I don't agree with your views though..  it's
   getting better for every update - AREXX is coming soon, etc

NovaKermi > If you want the best here and now, with much more advanced
   features to be "coming soon", then let's talk about ImageFX.  Eh?  ;)

dlman > I know that this is going to seem like I have been living in a
   concrete bunker away from the rest of the world, but I thought that
   ImageFX was a GVP product, and GVP was out of business, and did you all
   aquire all rights to ImageFX? 

NovaKermi > Heh!  We're the creators of ImageFX.  GVP licensed the rights
   to market it, and we took it back when our contract with them ended.
   Very friendly parting and all that though.  We market it directly now,
   worldwide, and continue to focus directly on the Amiga! 

Trib > Any chance that the next version of ImageFX will have Quicktime and
   AVI loaders and _savers_?  I have talked to Newtek Flyer owners that
   would like to directly convert Flyer clips into Quicktime animations. 
   Also, will we ever see a CyberGraphX version of ViewTek?  ga

NovaKermi > Some sort of support for Quicktime and AVI _may_ happen.  Bear
   in mind that most of the popular compression CODECs used in these are
   either patented or undocumented.  I understand the Xanim guys had to get
   special permission to use even a precompiled object module for thier
   code.  A Cybergraphx version of ViewTek is very likely. 

scottj > Kermit, what are the chances of porting IFX to the BeBox?

NovaKermi > BeBox is HIGHLY unlikely.  Unless someone mails us lots and
   lots of cash.  ;)
 
MrDaniel > I've heard some reports about the 2GO board from Phase5.  What
   do you think of it?  Will ImageFX support it?  Full screen real-time
   50Hz effects would be nice.  :)

NovaKermi > I've heard nothing of the 2GO board as yet.  Ask next time
   around. 

Rioter > What do you guys priority to improve for the next major version of
   ImageFX?

NovaKermi > Specifics?  Specifically more, and better, and updated
   Toaster/Flyer support...  more effects, more automated batching for
   effects over time.  That's as specific as I can be. 

Seed > Is there a 060 version planned?  How does your current code use it?

NovaKermi > '060 support is easy for us.  We're pre-designed to allow
   specific modules for specific processors to be called automatically. 
   Mostly you're talking a recompile to support an '060, but then again,
   we've yet to SEE a real '060 around here yet. 

mark[0] > Have you yet expirimented with or observed your software's
   performance on any RISC processor?

NovaKermi > Nope.  When a RISC Amiga shows up, or a card even, we'll know
   then. 

Harv > hey Kermit, who created that brilliant Amiga guide help system in
   ImageFX2?  Best Amiga app help system I've ever seen.  :)

NovaKermi > Commodore created the Amigaguide help system Harv.  Didn't you
   know that?  ;) ...oh, you mean the CONTENTS of our Help system?  ...heh
   heh.  'twere Mr.  Laser here of course! 

LoboFX > I would like to see some other products coming from Nova, like
   Paint Programs or even a new release of Thomas' EXCELLENT Rend24 (a
   solution for DCTV owners)...  Are you planning new products?  :) ... 
          
NovaKermi > ImageFX contains a paint program...it's the only one we're
   working on.  As for future Rend24's...probably not.  IMP and AutoFX in
   ImageFX handle those needs.  However, we DO have new products planned
   for the future. 

bcampbell> "I have never played with ImageFX that much because my CD32/SX-1
   does not have a hard drive yet.  So I get a friend to convert stuff with
   his copy.  However, I noticed that ImageFX doesn't convert Digiview 21
   bit images.  Will this be fixed soon? 

NovaKermi > Digiview 21 images have loaded fine here and we've never gotten
   a bug report that's proved otherwise.  We loaded our entire test suite
   of DV21's in fact.  If you've got a bad DV21 image, email or mail it to us.

[Intermission in which RobR, Achilles, and Quinto win CineMorph packages]

Timmer > Just wondering if you have any plans to update ImageFX's GUI to
   use a fancy BOOPSI GUI system such as ClassAct? 

NovaKermi > Not in our plans at this time.  We're concentrating on more
   effects and more compatibility with Amiga hardware as well as scanners
   and such. 

Cyberwlf > I am a Photogenics owner since V1.0 and have continually
   upgraded all the way through to V1.2 and also an ImageFX 1.5 user since
   the coverdisk giveaway ;^).  Since buying Pgs1.x I have become
   accustomed to way Pgs does things (GUI) Vs IFX's style of doing things.
   Is it possible a future version of IFX will be like AdPro 2.5 or Pgs1.x?
   And also will you be offering in the future some sort of cross-upgrade
   offer or some sort of offer to make it more affordable to those who cant
   normally afford it.:) And one last question does IFX2.x support CyberGFX
   System and the Cybervision64?  :)

NovaKermi > ImageFX's interface system is highly acclaimed and versitile. 
   We really do not plan to alter this.  I'm not really in the marketing
   side of things here so I don't know about upgrade offers now that the CU
   Amiga deal is over.  ImageFX was possibly the first program supporting
   Cybergraphics, well ahead of PGs, with our own preview module that let
   you preview, paint, and image process on the CyberG. 

dlman > Will IFX support the SGI file formats?  and if so, will it be
   included or a seperate package?

NovaKermi > ImageFX already supports about all of the SGI formats.  SGI
   RGB, Softimage, Wavefront, and something else I believe.  All included. 

Bagman > Will imagefx suport VideoMaster (the pcmcia digitizer from
   HighSoft)? 

NovaKermi > I've never heard of it, let 'em know to contact us and we'll
   try to support it. 

MrDaniel > Will the next version have a nice animation GUI (with miniature
   pictures, a la Scala) that makes it possible to easily edit/compose
   animations?  Will it have full 16/24-bit CGfx support, in previews etc?
   Photogenics 24-bit window based GUI is quite nice. 

NovaKermi > Re: Animation GUI, that's a bit too specific for discussing
   here.  As for 16/24 bit Cybergraphx support, it's had that before any
   other package.  Yes, ImageFX does preview in full color (15/16/24-bit)
   on ANY Cybergraphx system.  We do this in a Windowing GUI that's an
   offshoot of the screen-based GUI of the standard ImageFX. 

Babbage > with not changing what you use as your gui front end, how about
changing the layout a bit, putting propper menus and such, nothing hard,
making it easier to use and find things?  You amybe be concentrating on
effects more, but the gui is still important, its what the users
communicate to your system with =:)

NovaKermi > It's entirely possible for ANYONE to write their own front end
   to ImageFX to make it look more like Photoshop or anything.  Our current
   interface is the result of the needs of the Amiga and the variety of
   addon display cards.  A totally windowing display keeps any interface
   off of DCTV, Opalvision, and a great many other display cards that have
   NO internal support for interfacing with Windowing displays.  If someone
   wanted to write a Photoshop styled interface for ImageFX and sell it
   directly or elsewise, I'd love to talk with them, but our primary
   interface exists for the needs of the vast majority of Amiga owners who
   can only get interfaces working via overlapping screens when they want a
   preview over their DCTV, IV24, Opal, etc. 

Schrade > I just want to repeat the sentiments that the ImageFX GUI is not
   the greatest.  :-/ I would like to see ImageFX use a regular GadTools
   GUI like ADPro does OR at least a GUI like ClassAct.  If you need more
   info on ClassAct, please let me know and I can get you in touch with the
   authors (Tau, caldi, Timmer)

Harv > Why don't you use the newer faster jpeg scheme, kermit, such.....
   as in feck's fastjpeg_aga?  is there a reason?  

NovaKermi > Our JPEG support is based on the IJG's code, although not the
   very latest release, whereas Feck is using his own assembly code I
   believe.  We're trying to stay with IJG though for standardization. 

Seed > Did Escom ever approach you?  Do you think/care about it? 

NovaKermi > We have and continue to talk with Escom.  More I cannot say. 

xterm > 1) What about support for Progressive JPEG?  2) what about future
   [direct] support for OSes such as Win 3.1/95/NT, Unix variants
   (specifically SGI), etc?
   
NovaKermi > As we upgrade to the latest IJG code we'll have progressive
   JPEG.  If you mean porting to Win95, etc, ...absolutely not!  ImageFX is
   Amiga software. 

dlman > Will IFX support DIRECT communication with the PAR and have a
   rotoscope type of interface for animation playback/editing? 

NovaKermi > Only the future will tell how the PAR support will improve.
   We've never seen a PAR here.  The PAR module(s) were written at DPS and
   given to us.  The module(s) lack ARexx support unfortunately.  As we get
   and work with a PAR, support can improve. 

Seed > Is PNG a format you believe in?

NovaKermi > The PNG is out there.  It's apparently going to make a shot at
   being the next GIF.  So long as it's supporters upgrade and maintain it,
   we'll support it. 

scottj > Kermit what happened to the agreement between Amiga image...  
   processing companies to share buffers between their programs?

NovaKermi > The agreement was never universal.  ASDG/ER never responded,
   and they're no longer supporting the Amiga anyways now, BlackBelt
   created some ARexx scripts, but never supported the standard interface.
   Other companies have come and gone, but in the wake of Commodore, it
   seems that few new standards are going to be adopted for the immediate
   future. 

jcompton > This question was sent e-mail from Bohus Blahut, who reviewed
   ImageFX 2.1's upgrade in Amiga Report: "When will you include enveloping
   for your functions?  Lightwave is a great example of the value of
   setting envelopes or "trends", and ImageMaster has them.  Also, can IFX
   batch a single frame repeatedly throughout a sequence, i.e.  an animated
   texture over a still?  (ADPro does it.)" . 

NovaKermi > To my knowlege Imagemaster does not have envelopes, it's their
   Windows product line that does this.  However, this sort of
   functionality is on "the list" and has been for some time.  ImageFX can
   batch a single frame throughout a sequence, via multiple adds in AutoFX,
   or directly in IMP.  Both are batch processors included at no extra
   charge in ImageFX. 

Frotz > OK, I have a vlab motion that i'm not using.  if you pay shipping
   you can play with it for 2 months until I get my 060.  will you support
   it?

NovaKermi > We get loans directly from the OEMs.  Thanks anyways!  As for
   support, what do you want?  Vlab JPEG loading?  We're waiting on them
   for the information and have been for some time.  I've personally asked
   Macrosystems in Germany about this a long time ago, and have re-asked
   via Noahji's personnel.   Borrowing the board isn't the problem.  It's
   knowing what's different about their JPEG format.  We support standard
   JPEGs, and theirs don't _seem_ to be standard and aren't according to some.

Babbage > do you see adpro as being serious competition to you?  And what
   do you think to AT and their amiga upgrade plans (both ppc and non ppc
   base).  Cheers for this irc session to us all btw.  :) 

NovaKermi > ADpro is three year old technology that isn't supported or
   generally sold anymore.  No, it's not competitive.  The Power Amiga
   sounds great.  The new Amiga 1200s and the new 4000 towers are finally
   here (yay!) and are priced reasonably for Amigas. 

Seed > How do you see IFX competing with the SGI rivals?  I like the
   interface ;)

NovaKermi > The Amiga doesn't compete with SGIs.  The speed just isn't
   here.   Sigh. 

LoboFX > OK, what about more configurable GUI ?  I mean changing buttons...

NovaKermi > Our current GUI can run on screens or in windows, on it's own
   screens or any Public Screen.  It works in register color modes down to
   2 colors or on other screens in up to 24-bit color.  You can alter the
   interface to make the menus ordered in any order you like with any
   options you like.   You can assign macros to any menu items already.
   It's in the manual.  Even for ImageFX 1.5 for that matter.  All the keys
   can be edited and assigned macros/ARexx scripts as well. 

MrDaniel > The GUI is the only thing that have kept me from buying ImageFX.
   Its nice for ECS/AGA machines, but I have a CV64 and want my software to
   make full use of it.  You said that anyone could write their own front
   end for ImageFX.  How?

NovaKermi > ImageFX already takes full advantage of the Cybervision 64 and
   runs in full 24-bit color on it. 

scottj > Kermit, how about adding macro recording to IFX?  I know about
   AutoFxbut its not the same.

NovaKermi > ImageFX has built-in macro recording.  Hit !  to turn it on, @
   to turn it off. 

_Ivan_ > will nova design/IFX have the desire or opportunity or however you
   might state that to make their effects/filters usuable as lightwave
   plugins..  kind of like the KPT tools that will be available for the IBM
   version of lightwave, for exmple for postprocessing ?

NovaKermi > Could be, only the future can tell.  (ie: no comment) :)

dlman > Kermi: Does IFX have 32-BIT graphics support?  As far as INTERNAL
   image processing...  If not, how does IFX handle Tranparancy? 

NovaKermi > Yes, internally we support 32-bits and 56-bits for many things,
   including compositing. 

Seed > Will there be full JStream support?  (Digital Broadcaster)

NovaKermi > Full Jstream support is already in ImageFX. 

Cyberwlf > IFX 1.5 has a bug when you halt arexx scripts during execution
it freezes the program (well the GUI atleast :)) ...Is there any fix for
this?  Does IFX2.x solve this bug?  (I assume it is a bug?)

NovaKermi > This is not a bug.  Some ARexx scripts turn the GUI off
   (LockGUI on) and you need to turn it back on.  I keep a macro key
   assigned to do this.  (UnlockGUI)

[In the final prize round, xterm and ericgir won CineMorphs and mark[0] won
an ImageFX 2.1a package]

jcompton > I'd like to thank Kermit Woodall of Nova Design for spending a
   few hours of his time with us, Optic, Schrade, and Camelot for
   moderating assistance, and the dozens of you that stayed up late or got
   up early for this conference.  :)

jcompton > Kermit: Any parting words before we give out the goodies? 

NovaKermi > Hmmm...."So long and thanks for all the fish"?  Nah, that's
   been done...how about, thanks for coming folks!

                           Amiga E: An Overview
  Jason Hulance                                            jason@fsel.com
===========================================================================

  o  Price: 26 (Shareware)
  o  Author: Wouter van Oortmerssen
  o  Current Version: 3.2e

Amiga users are spoilt for choice when it comes to programming languages. 
There are several different dialects of BASIC, especially suitable for
beginners, and Assembly for the speed freaks.  In between lie languages
like C and Pascal.  You can even try your hand at functional languages such
as Lisp and Gofer.

Any new language has to offer something special to stand out from this
crowd.  So what does Amiga E have that makes it interesting?  Well, the
author, Wouter van Oortmerssen, designed E to be a good, general-purpose
language, since he was dissatisfied by the features and performance of C
compilers.  The result was a high-level, procedural language (with some
functional aspects) and an extremely fast compiler.

The first public release of E was v2.1a at the end of 1992.  The past three
years have seen it mature into a complete package of compiler, debugger and
hundreds of example programs.  Some well-known, quality programs have been
created using E, of which two examples are the superb graphics program
Photogenics (by Paul Nolan and Almathera) and the icon editor Iconian (by
Chad Randall).  So whay should you investigate E?

Speed
-----
The speed is the first thing that strikes you when you try out the E
compiler.  Even the longest programs compile in the blink of an eye on a
standard, floppy-based A500, which is quite astonishing if you're used to a
C compiler.  This means that you can spend more time actually writing your
programs, and you can experiment without your enthusiasm being sapped by
the compiler.

What's more remarkable is that speed of compilation is not a trade-off
against the speed of compiled programs, and neither is it due to a cryptic
syntax.

E code looks very much like Pascal or Modula-2 code.  However, E is based
more closely on C, and an E program will run as fast, if not faster, than a
similar C program.  In fact, E programs can even make use of true inline
Assembly, so they need never be slow.

E is no slouch, but this is by no means the end of the story.  The E
language has a number of very useful features, some of which are based on
the better features of other languages.

Exceptions
----------
The idea of exceptions is borrowed from Ada, and they are used to simplify
and separate the code which deals with the various error cases of a
procedure or a number of procedures.  This, as with many of the other
features of E, can greatly increase the readability of a program by making
the real code much more concise and uncluttered.

Automatic exceptions simplify things further by allowing calls to library
functions to automatically raise exceptions if they result in certain
values (a null pointer, for example).  For example, you can protect every
call to AllocMem() with just one declaration, and then you can then use it
without having to check the result.  All your program needs to do is handle
the corresponding exception.

OOP
---
Object Oriented Programming is supported by Amiga E, even though E is in
essence a typeless language.  For the uninitiated, OOP is a set of
techniques which are meant to allow for faster development and easier
maintenance of large programs.  You do not need to use a language which
supports OOP in order to use the techniques, but it's a lot easier if you
do.

Objects, methods, inheritance and data-hiding are the buzz-words of OOP.
All these concepts have been seamlessly introduced in version3 of Amiga E,
with none of the kludges found in some other OOP languages.

The original designers of the Amiga realised that OOP was an important
concept, even before OOP languages were popular.  Many of the core parts of
the Operating System exhibit OOP features.  For example, the data structure
for a process includes (i.e., inherits) the structure of a task, and
processes can be used with functions which operate on tasks.

Lists
-----
Since OS 2.0, many of the Amiga system functions make use of tag lists.  In
most other languages these correspond to arrays, and the problem with
arrays is that they have to be initialised before they can be used.  This
means that the contents of a tag list are necessarily separated from the
function call which uses it.  In E, a tag list is just a normal list
expression, so the contents of the list can be written in the same place as
the function call.

E also has strings (and lists) which can be safely manipulated without
worrying about exceeded their maximum sizes.  These data structures are at
least as efficient as normal strings in C and can be used wherever normal
strings might be used.  This means that there is one less problem for the E
programmer to worry about.

Cons cells
----------
Lisp programmers know all about the power of cons cells and the usefulness
of a garbage collector.  By adopting these features, E allows a certain
degree of functional programming.

As well as being very readable, programs written in a functional language
can more easily be shown to be correct.  In fact, many mathematical
definitions require very little effort to translate them to a functional
language.

Cons cells are very powerful objects which can be used to build almost any
data structure, although they are most commonly used to build linked lists.

A garbage collector is a mechanism for efficiently recycling any cons cells
that are no longer in use.  This means that programmers do not need to
concern themselves with the complex task of managing memory (at least not
for cons cells).

Another Lisp feature that has been adopted is quoted expressions, which
enables expressions to be passed around like values.  The benefit of this
is that the expression can be evaluated (using the Eval() function) at any
time and any number of times.  The resulting value depends on the values of
variables at the time of evaluation, not when the expression was quoted.

Quoted expressions make it possible to have functions like MapList() which
apply the same expression to each element of a list, creating a new list of
the same length.  This makes it easy to, for example, square the contents
of a list.

Unification
-----------
Borrowed from functional languages like Miranda and Gofer, unification (or
pattern matching) can be used with lists or cons cells in E.

Unification assigns values to variables based on matching some template
pattern.  A similar effect would commonly be achieved in other languages by
using a nesting of conditional statements.  The nesting gets quite deep
(and unreadable) if you want to do a complicated match, but with
unification all matches are linear, concise and easy to understand.  The
unification method can also be much more efficient.

Programs like language interpreters or compilers are full of the kinds of
tests that would benefit greatly from pattern matching.  So is dynamic
typing, where structures have tags to identify the type (or types) of the
rest of the structure.  In C you would probably use unions and a lot of
switch statements, but in E you could do the same thing more clearly and
efficiently using lists and unification.

Built-in functions
------------------
There are a lot of useful functions which are part of the E language. 
These serve to simplify many of the standard Amiga system functions (e.g.,
gadget creation) and to provide support functions like those in other
languages (e.g., improved memory management).

The E compiler also incorporates all the function calls from the four main
Amiga system libraries (Dos, Exec, Graphics and Intuition).  These
libraries are opened and closed automatically by every E program, so the
majority of small programs do not need to explicitly open (or close) any
libraries.

Utilities
---------
Included with the Amiga E distribution is, amongst other things, a text
editor (with many E-specific features) and a very nice, source-level
debugger.  Of course, there is a Reference Manual, written by Wouter, which
is aimed at the more experienced programmer.  This is complemented by a
rather extensive tutorial for beginners, but I shouldn't comment further
because I wrote it!

A lot of people have written modules of useful functions for use in your
own E programs.  Two of the best are Async and EasyGUI.  Async provides a
set of replacements for the normal input functions.  The new functions use
an asynchronous buffering technique to speed up reading from a file or
device.

EasyGUI, written by Wouter, provides an extremely simple way of creating
font sensitive and resizable GUIs.  Lists are used to specify the GUI, with
tags like SLIDER to specify a slider.  The layout is specified in very
loose terms.  For example, the tag EQROWS indicates that a collection of
parts of the GUI should be laid out in equally sized rows.  The actual
positions and sizes of each gadget (and group of gadgets) are automatically
determined, even after a resize.  And, although it is not as powerful as
MUI, the module is very small and very fast.

Also worthy of mention is the module FilledVector, which provides a
relatively simple interface to 3D filled vector rendering, using the
blitter.  Several of the example programs render quite complex objects as
animated Workbench backdrops!  Imagine a spinning and moving A1200 logo on
your Workbench, using up hardly any CPU.

Availability
------------
The demo distribution of Amiga E is available from Aminet (in the dev/e
directory) or any good PD house.  It is also available from me, as the UK
registration site (Wouter lives in Holland).

The demo version is the same as the full distribution, except that the demo
compiler is restricted to creating small executables.  This means you can
try out the examples and learn the language using the Reference Manual or
the Beginner's Guide before you decide whether E is for you.

At current exchange rates, the registration fee is 26, on disk, or 23 via
E-mail.  Demo versions and compiler updates are free via E-mail, or cost 3
on disk.  Contact:

                           IPISA '95 Report
  Stefano Agostinelli                                 agos001@pn.itnet.it
===========================================================================

                             IPISA '95
                              Milan
                          18 November 1995

Hi,this text is a brief of IPISA 95.  Please note that this report does not
pretend to be a detailed transcript of IPISA lectures and if I forgot to
mention something (highly probable) is just cause my memory is limited, so
don't blame me for that, just buy me another Gigabyte.  :)

                           Introduction
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~
IPISA stands for "Incontro Programmatori Italiani per lo Sviluppo su Amiga"
(E:"Italian Amiga Developers Meeting").

IPISA 95 was quite big (~400 participants); it's good to see this meeting
growing steadily each year, as well as an increasing quality of lectures. 
Moreover this year participants were graced with two CD-ROMs and a lot of
documentation.

IPISA is organised by a bunch of Amiga fanatics: Roberto Attias, Federica
Colla, Fabrizio Lodi, Sergio Ruocco, Carlo Santagostino, Reinhard Spisser
and Marco Zandonadi. (Good work guys keep it up!)

                        Spotlights on OOP
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This year Dr.  Peter Kittel was the main guest star; more on this later. 
Also from Germany we had Ms.  "Meeting Pearls" Angela Schimdt and Storm C
developers (Mr.Haage and Mr.Partner);from Portugal Mr.Lemos presenting his
portable C OO library Objection.

As said in the subject, OO programming was the main thread:

 o V.Gervasi demoed his great looking EUNice system to handle and mantain
   OO projects via a friendly MUI interface; this system requires using
   Amiga E as development language.  With EUNice the programmer can in
   every moment know what this method does and what parameters it requires
   and so on;this is very very useful in large OO projects when you have to
   deal with many objects.  The only thing I disliked is that it requires
   you program in E; would a version for BOOPSI programming be possible?

 o M.Lemos showed his Objection system which is basically a new
   C library dealing with OO issues; it's rather like BOOPSI but its
   advantage is that is already ported and available for Posix
   systems.Lemos showed a program designed to create state machines which
   used its Objection library.
 
 o F.Zuccollo presented his Media library; a sort of OO way of defining
   file system access (well it's a bit more complicated than that :)
   Zuccollo showed the limitations inherent to dos.library and the Amiga
   device handler design then pointed out how his system could realize a
   more open-minded method to deal with storage access.  Well, it seemed
   very promising but probably he needs to develop it further to show real
   life applications.

                         Other interesting lectures
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 o G.Ghibo' showed its EVPaths: a link library useful for a simpler and
   more powerful access to env variables; this was tailored made for TeX
   compilers that use env vars to define paths (like TEXINPUTS).  This guy
   also worked hard to provide the best Amiga TeX installation there is on
   IPISA CD: more than 300MB of useful stuff,including:

   o TeX 3.14159,
   o MF 2.718
   o METAPOST
   o BibTex
   o Midi2Tex
   o a revised ShowDVI 1.42
   o LaTeX2espilon
   o MusicTex
   o an improved SpecialHost
   o hyphenation for english,german,italian
   o much much more

 o G.Falcioni and S.Guarnieri showed their great (state of art on the
   Amiga) Visual Neurocomputing to deal with neural networks.  It's fast
   and its gadtools interface seems friendly and its very lot configurable.

 o M.Ciccione previewed his Audio Lab 16 v2 an advanced audio application
   that deals with 16 bit samples; it seems very powerful and its tailor
   made to fit audio engineers needs (at least that's what he said :).

 o A.Tasora talked about his Phenomena Forth/RPL modules for Real3D v3; He
   showed some wireframe anims made using these macros and they were
   incredible!  So good they seemed to come from Industrial Light & Magic.
   Phenomena includes 15 modules (Volcan, Fan, Dynamite, Splash and many
   others) and are a real professional work; they will probably be included
   in V4 of Real 3D.

 o A.Longo, BreathLess author and programmer of the italian game team
   Fields of Vision, showed his baby.  Well someone said that Doom isn't
   possible on Amiga....actually BreathLess is much better than Doom!  He
   showed a prerelease version on a vanilla A4000/40 and it was so fluid I
   couldn't trust my eyes; the graphics are really really good,the sound is
   great, speed on a full screen 1x1 is excellent on A4000/40 and he said
   that on vanilla A1200 it's enjoyable.  In fact he said that the first
   release (the version he demoed at IPISA) is not targeted to high-end
   machines, but is especially suited for A1200s in order to address
   initially the largest user base:for this reason he has left out
   PicassoII/CyberGraphX support and cut a bit the resolution of enemies. 
   He added that if initial release sells well he'll be going to release a
   version especially made for high end machines and gfx cards.  Having
   seen what BreathLess is now I think that this incredible italian team is
   capable to make BrathLess become the state of the art Doom clone not
   juts on Amiga but on any computer platform;so if you have an AGA machine
   run out and buy it!  (first release will be out soon (for XMas sales)
   for a price of 69-79.000 Lit (~57-64 DM or ~43-50 USD))

 o M.Puccini, of the italian development team ClassX of X-DVE fame, showed
   his XFA library, a shared library useful to make and play animations
   using XFA format; this format uses interlace cunning and its indeed fast
   (well a lot faster than ANIM-5) and was especially made for video
   playback.  The product includes an anim2xfa converter.

 o R.Solmi talked about his new NetMail program;this program was made to
   handle internet mail and can be easily interfaced with POP3, SMTP, and
   UUCP transfer utilities.  NetMail is ARexx based and offers some
   advanced features like automatic foldering and mime support.

                              Speeches
                              ~~~~~~~~

 o M.C.Battilana, Cloanto's head of Personal Paint fame, was so kind to
   give partecipants a free pre release version of Cloanto Personal Suite
   CD Rom: a cd containing old versions of some commercial programs
   (Personal Write, Personal Font Maker, SuperBase, etc...) and Personal
   Paint v6.4.  He talked about future OSes we're going to see in the next
   few years:mainly Taligent's CommonPoint and Micro$oft Cairo.

 o P.Canali, THE italian hardware guru, talked about his project: a PCI
   bridge for the 68020 (i.e.  A1200).  He explained the trouble in
   designing such a thing and talked about what directions AT can take to
   integrate PCI bus in new Amigas.

 o G.Ligorio talked about compression of images and sounds; he pointed out
   a clever variation of the Huffmann compression especially made to
   compress further IFF-ILBM containing bitmaps compressed with RLE.

                              Guest stars
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~

 o Angela Schmidt talked about the Meeting Pearls history (herstory?:). 
   She showed the new Meeting Pearls III and its new features.

 o Haage & Partner showed the Storm C C/C++ development system currently
   available only in German; they said that the international version will
   be out quite soon and that a demo version will be uploaded on Aminet in
   a few days.  They showed the integration of the development tools:
   compiler,linker and debugger.  C++ compilation is fast,but is not fully
   3.0 compliant (I think); also the compiler has no global optimizer so
   source code is not as good as that produced by SAS/C: however they said
   that differences are in the order of 5%.  This should be addressed soon
   of course.  The debugger seems quite good and offers a more intuitive
   interface than cpr.  All the features are available on a friendly custom
   BOOPSI based interface.

 o M.Lemos see above

                        Dr.P.Kittel speaks
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well he said lots of things and was very cordial with the audience; firstly
he talked about what AT has done,what is doing now and what are future
directions (a SCALA presentation helped him).

What AT has done we all know: they have reintroduced Amigas A1200 and
A4000T).

What are they doing now?  He said they will introduce soon the Q-Drive (a
quad speed PCMCIA CD-ROM reader for the A1200),they will make some small
changes to the OS,they are talking with many companies for strategic
decisions and developments.

In the more distant future: the first issue is to make AmigaOS portable,
the first implementation will be PowerPC based but once they have AmigaOS
available as a portable system they could as well sell it for other
architectures.

Regarding PowerPC he said that they want to design an entire family of
Amigas from the low to the high end.  The high end will be definitely CHRP
compliant, while the low end will probably be not.

He also said that custom graphics chip are already in the works but at an
external company,if possible they will be upgraded in order to give 24bits
screens, chunky modes and 16 bit audio; no it's not AAA, that is "dead" but
some of its features could as well be implemented on the new graphics
chips.

Note that he said that they think that on new Amigas would be the user to
choose this or that graphics subsytem; so I presume that the new chipset
will be available on a PCI card.  Talking about PCI he said that surely PCI
will be available on new machines,so you could use all those speed demon
PCI gfx cards.

Then he talked about ADSP and assured that will be started very very soon
now (he talked about 1 Dec as a reference date);certified developers are
divided in Non-Commercial (100USD/year) and Commercial (300US/year)
sections.  The Commercial ones has to show one existing or nearly finished
commercial product; commercial AT developers get phone support,
non-commercial do not.  All certified developers will have access to
private mailing lists or something like that, while documentation will be
available on the Net for everyone.

Well after that we had some Q&A with him:he was very cordial and
clear in his answers.Things that emerged:
 o AAA and Hombre are dead.
 o The DSP project is interesting and is being considered.
 o ColdFire is not fully 680x0 compatible so it has been rejected
   as a cpu for an interim machine.
 o Alpha workstations are being considered as a possible architecture
   to port AmigaOS to.

                   Review: LightSpeed: A Video Magazine
  Bohus Blahut                             bohuslav.blahut@mail.colum.edu
===========================================================================

    As NewTek's Lightwave 3D program gains increased visibility through
television and film, it also gains a greater audience outside the Amiga
community.  NewTek has ported LW to the PC, and soon to the SGI.  Before
the LW standalone program, many Toaster sales were to 3D artists who viewed
the Video hardware as an expensive dongle for the powerful LightWave 3D.
As always in the Amiga community, the entrepeneur spirit stirred users to
create auxilliary programs and information sources all devoted to this one
program.

    By opening LW to the huge PC market, we are already seeing an increase
in the development outside the walls of NewTek's Alcatraz.  Once you take into
account both commercial development, and the public domain, the sheer volume of
work that has come out in the last year is staggering.  There is also a new
batch of Lightwave users.  How is the 3D artist going to stay informed about new
products and new techniques in the LW world?

    There are several monthly publications that deal with LW, also several
tutorial videos to get you started with the software, but then where do you
go?  This is where the ambitious LightSpeed Video Magazine comes in.
LightSpeed is a monthly video costing $12.95.  I use the word "ambitious"
because it's quite some undertaking to create an all-new two hour video
every month.  In the October issue, the video featured several LW
tutorials, a video taken at SigGraph, a demo video of the commercial
product Impact!, a review/demonstration of Questar's World Construction
Set, and animationr's demo reels.  Also available are companion LightSpeed
floppy disks.  These feature the scene and object files from the current
video.  The flopies are PC formatted, but this should serve no problem to
Amiga 2.0 users who are using CrossDOS.  Some of the filenames were a
little strange looking on my system, but there are utilites available to
ready PC files for Amiga use and vice versa. 

    LightSpeed's approach to producing material is to allow subscribers to
shoot and edit video segments in their own studios, and submit them to the
magazine.  The overall video quality of the individual segments is good,
although I wish that producers would spice up their presentation.  As a
teacher, I know how important it is to keep the interest level up while
teaching.  The tutorials in the October issue target the
beginner/intermediate animator.   Manuel Cotes, creator of LightSpeed,
assures me that future volumes will feature more advanced topics and
projects.  Particularly valuable in this volume is the "Animation Showcase"
It's always good for animators of any skill level to see the work of other
animators especially when we are all working with the same software.  Also
on this tape, I was glad to see not only the demo tape of World
Construction Set (A fractal landscape generator that produces realistic
looking images), but an actual user putting the software through its paces.

    One of the best tutorials on the tape is Kyle Thatch's "It's only 3D"
segment.  Thatch's segment is an intro to scale modeling in LW.  His
delivery is casual yet succinct, and peppered with humor.  His modeling
project takes users through steps to create a Lego brick.  Thatch chooses
the brick because it's got good basic geometry, and "you're likely to find
one buried in your couch." Future LightSpeed producers should look to this
as a template of effective tutoring.

    I would recommend that LW users look into LightSpeed.  It's less
expensive than other tutorial tapes, and since it's monthly it can keep up
with changes in the software.  It's also a unique opportunity to help
forward the desktop video revolution.  Manuel Cotes' assembly of the
segments (with 3D animated bumpers, I might add) of independently produced
video is what DTV is all about.  You can purchase individual issues of
LightSpeed and the companion disks at many dealers, or subscribe annually.

                   Review: FrozenFish August 1995 CD-ROM
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

There are a lot of merits to having the entire Fred Fish disk collection
in CD-ROM format.  One is that a CD-ROM stores a lot easier than 1,100
floppies do.  1,100 floppies that don't change really take up a lot
of space on a hard drive.  It's a significant chunk of Amiga history, and
enables you to look up the contents of Fish Disk 283 and commit them to
memory, just so when you meet the man himself, you can quiz him and feel
somehow superior because you know the answer while all he can come up with
is a blank look.

In case you don't have a CD-ROM drive, though, it would really be nice if
your local BBS or ISP carried the Fish archives.  Your average one-horse,
one CD-ROM PC BBS will probably have better ideas for its single drive than
a Fish CD, but with 7-disc changers gaining popularity and dropping in
price, it's not quite such an uphill battle.  Combined with the fact that a
number of PC CD-ROM filesystems don't deal well with filesystems more
complicated than ISO 9660 Level 1 (which limits filenames to 8+3
characters), it means that just tossing in a random Fish CD might not be
the best solution.

That's what motivated FrozenFish.  Totally ISO 9660 level 1, in 8+3
character all capital letter glory, FZF carries all 1,100 Fish disks to
date in LHA format, plus a small amount of Commodore includes, and about
200 megs of material from FreshFish 9. 

Intended for BBSes, the individual Fish disk files are cataloged in CRC
files only, as the "PI" (product information) files only identify the
disk's number.  A rather long treatise on KingFisher and its application
with these PI files is included.  The new additions from FreshFish 9 are
properly cataloged with full descriptions, however.

Well...there's only so much that can be said about a collection of Fish
disks that hasn't been said hundreds of times before.  The real issue here
is cost for performance, and for $20, it's hard to complain.  Of course,
$20 will also get you GoldFish 1, which is a slightly less complete (since
it's measurably older, it's missing the most recent 100 disks) but in a
much more searchable format, including the de-archived disks, as the
compilation is two CDs.  An Amiga user would be well advised to pass up
this collection, but then, that's the point--no self-respecting Amiga
manufacturer puts "PC Compatible" on the cover of a product unless he's
very serious about it.  The inclusion of the new material makes the disc
just that much more attractive and justifiable.  So harass your favorite
sysop to make room in that 7 CD changer for you.

===========================================================================
                        Review: MegaBall 4 from IAM
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Breakout, Brickbreaker, Arkanoid...whatever the first game you saw in this
genre was, chances are you liked it.  There seems to be an irresistable
element to these games that brings people in droves.  Hordes of beginning
computer students have slaved away to recreate the game on all sorts of
platforms in all sorts of languages.  The premise is so simple...a bar at
the bottom of the screen hits a ball around, which hits bricks at the top
of the screen.  Get rid of all the bricks, you win.

Breakout had the original idea.  Arkanoid made it slick, with the concept
of falling "powerups" to give you special weapons or abilities.  (It seems
to be the inevitable evolution of arcade games that powerups always show up
sooner or later...)  MegaBall improves on the Arkanoid model, giving it a
sense of style and something uniquely...Amiga.

MegaBall hasn't exactly been a secret.  On the contrary, it's been a
shareware game for years, up to and including version 3, from the Mackey
brothers, Ed and Al.  A unique registration offer came to them a few years
back from one Dale Larson (a pizza and a tour of Commodore, where Larson
was in the Amiga Networking Group at the time), and none of them forgot
about the experience.  After doing well in the Amiga market, Larson decided
he wanted to publish a game.  After doing well in the shareware market, the
Mackeys decided they wanted to be published.  And so MegaBall 4 was born.

MegaBall loads on virtually any Amiga system, down to a 1 meg A500 and up
to an Amiga 4000/040.  The game is designed to run in NTSC, but a MODEID
tooltype can be used in conjunction with a special tool, included with the
game, to identify valid screenmodes for play.  PAL users will simply find
that their entire screen isn't being used by the game.  Graphics card users
are encouraged to try, but not to expect great results.  Just a tip:
Multiscan Extra-Low Res looks bad, too.

The brick-breaking idea in MegaBall form is this:  Go up against
multicolored bricks in anything from the standard Breakout rectangle to
Santa Claus shapes.  Grab powerups that may make your paddle bigger,
smaller, give it guns, kill you, change the laws of physics, or a number of
other things.  Delight in blowing up half the screen with special Dynamite
bricks, or watch in disgust as Green Slime bricks breed across the screen
until they touch another brick and clone it.  Wince as Blue Growers make
your task difficult by blowing up into even more bricks.  And, oh yeah, be
sure you stay away from the "powerup" that kills (you).

At the same time, one of 5 music tracks plays in the background (leaving
one channel free for sound effects.)  The tracks and graphics, both ECS and
AGA, were designed by Al Mackey--and a fine job of it.  All 5 music tracks
have a very "arcade" feel to them, giving MegaBall a sense of atmosphere
beyond being a simple genre piece.

If the hundreds of levels included with the game bore you (and it'll take
quite some time), you're welcome to build your own with the Board Editor, a
ridiculously simple program that will turn you into a hero in the eyes of
your jaded MegaBall-owning pals.

Speaking of friends, MegaBall allows for two players, but they take turns
rather than working cooperatively, as games such as CyberSphere allow.

Perhaps best of all is that MegaBall is highly system friendly and
multitasking.  It is, bar none, THE best thing to do with your Amiga during
a long download, taking away an insignificant amount of transfer time (on
my 030/25 A3000) but plugging away at full speed.  And should you need to
check that download or render, MegaBall automatically pauses upon sensing a
screen switch.  If you're REALLY lucky, you'll hear the special "pause"
music track.

MegaBall lacks a few Arkanoidian features, such as multiball play and those
annoying spaceships that come down from the top of the screen to make your
job tougher.  You won't notice, though, as your single ball achieves
lightning speeds or you gleefully send it plunging through half a screen
full of exploding bricks.  You won't notice when you make a level out of
your boss or ex-boy/girlfriend's name and happily blast it to bits.  You
won't notice when you realize it's 3 AM and you should probably get some
sleep...

Your US$30 buys you a loud red box, 3 disks of MegaBall 4, an AFS Floppy
demo disk, and a really great game.  The manual for both MegaBall and the
Board Editor is in AmigaGuide (Aside from his book, Dale Larson is not one
for extensive printed documentation--the printed one page insert is a
record for IAM products), and includes tips for advanced players, notes to
MOD authors who want to make their own works MegaBall-compatible, and the
cheat keys for the game.  If you've been wanting to register MegaBall 3 but
just couldn't get around to it, IAM's worldwide distribution leaves you
little choice but to buy MegaBall 4.

              Review: Dell High-Density External Amiga Floppy
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Hey, you never know where friends can come from.

Ok, so they didn't do it out of the goodness of their hearts, they did it
because Software Hut and Better Concepts asked them to build a whole lot.
But it's done.

Somebody figured out that Dell's external laptop floppy could be made Amiga
compatible with just a little fuss.  One hacked up cable later, the Dell
floppy is now the second best way to get high density disks read on your
Amiga.  (The best would be an internal high density floppy, but Amiga Tech
can't find anybody who wants to make them right now.)

A ridiculously small footprint (Roughly 5 inches long by 4 inches wide) and
slim styling (it's 5 stacked floppies tall) make it a very unassuming piece
of hardware.  The case is an odd smoke grey, roughly the same color as the
CD32, which serves to make it the perfect companion piece for the SX-1.
The Dell has no Amiga floppy passthrough, so it has to sit on the end of a
floppy chain.  There are no DIP switches, either, it defaults to DF2: on
the A3000, skipping DF1: for the other internal bay, presumably.

The drive requires no special drivers but does need Workbench 2.1 to
function properly, and Software Hut recommends CrossDOS 6 Pro for PC disk
reading.  Good idea, too, as operating under the standard CrossDOS with the
Workbench results in an awful lot of CRC errors.  Besides, it's been a long
time since Consultron's seen a lot of return on CrossDOS, and 6 is a
worthwhile upgrade.  We ran into no problems using MaxDOS and CrossMAC for
Macintosh floppies.

Other weak points?  Well, as mentioned before, the cable is a hack.
Specifically, the connector on the drive is only a small card edge with
relatively little stability.  The cable itself is a rather unmatching
beige, ending in wrapped wire and a small circuit board, enclosed in
plastic and hot-glued.  Really, the casing around the board covers
everything, but the only way to tell which way to put the card-edge in the
connector is by the small white sticker on one side of the cable.

A decent solution for the high density problem.  Perhaps disgruntled 4000T
owners, stuck with double density drives, can bribe their internal high
density-owning friends to trade.  And for US$115, it's a bit cheaper than
other drives, including those which require special software drivers to
operate at all.

===========================================================================
                        Review: FreshFish Vol.  10
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

The quarterly series of FreshFish CDs continues.

As part of Fred Fish's move away from floppy disks, a series of regular
CD-ROMs was introduced.  Now that Fred no longer personally compiles the
disk series, it is the most frequent source for their archives from Amiga
Library Services.

Volume 10 features the most recent 100 Fish disks (1001-1100), which will
bring GoldFish 1 (the 2 CD set with the first 1000) owners up to date.  It
also rings in three times as much "new material", freely redistributable
software in the Aminet hierarchy.  The "useful" directory, some 130 megs of
it, includes licensed Commodore include files and classic, essential
software titles.  The remaining 300+ megs are taken up with GNU development
tools and extensive source code.  Searching the Fish library of discs is
supported by the included KingFisher archives.

In other words, the same array the Fish discs normally bring.

A welcome change has come in the user interface, however.  Perhaps taking a
cue from the Aminet discs, FreshFish 10 has an AmigaGuide-driven menu
system for searching and accessing the entire disk, with configurable
preferences for handling the myriad filetypes the disk contains.  An
installation utility helps you set the proper viewers to the different
image, text, and sound types you will encounter.  The menu system makes use
of ixemul.library, which the installer is happy to provide you with.

The CD is still the single best source for Amiga development tools,
particularly with no CATS-like organization churning out CDs for the hungry
programmers out there.  However, this will be changing, as will the
"useful" directory.  These will apparently be spun off to a new series of
CD-ROMs, turning FreshFish into a disc with, well, more fresh fish--a
greater focus on newly available Amiga software.

Those with slow machines, or those who simply hate LHA archives, will be
heartened to know that most of the non-Fish disk software is in dearchived
form, ready to be copied directly off the CD.  This certainly goes a long
way to assist in certain decisions, since rather than dearchiving an 800k
utility simply to get at the documentation to find out what it does, you
have the doc file waiting for your beady little eyes to peruse.  In
addition, much of the software has the .pi file for BBS descriptions,
saving sysops hassle and saving users confusion.  After all, it's not easy
to figure out what EC90-126.6.jpg is unless the .pi file tells you it's the
STS-31 space shuttle, after landing.

Fred Fish continues to deliver a large quantity of important Amiga
resources (647 megs, all told) at a very reasonable cost ($20, or $15 if
you buy a one-year subscription for $60 total.)  Unless you have so many
CDs you decorate the walls with them, FreshFish 10 should be a serious
consideration to keep your library current.

Product: Disect version 1.7
Type   : Debugger / Dissasembler
Author : D.M.Alderson   (DMA)

Disect is a comprehensive debugger / disassembler.  Compared to the main
competition, which must be HiSoft's Monam debugger, it's years ahead in
terms of features. First off is it's symbol handling; point and click to
define various type of symbols; data, instruction, ascii text and others.
Also,  when dealing with instructions, that reference structures via an 
address register, it will display a list of all the available labels that 
fit the offset to be used. It will scan a .gs preassembled symbol file as
produced by Devpac. Macros are included to handle repeated operations and 
so is a memory monitor.  It'll load virtually any type of data file from 
normal executables to raw binary. 

The interface comes as a shock after having used Monam for many years. 
It's full WB2 style layout is Commodore Style Guide compliant & features 
Underscores, Cycle gadgets and Check boxes. Menus are also included, but 
are only accessed when the mouse is in the menu bar, as the right mouse 
button is used to jump to the destination effective address of instructions.

There are however problems with such a rich interface. Mostly the one of 
distractions; you tend to feel it's cluttered at times. Also it doesn't 
handle mode promotion well. The screen is a fixed size so opening on a 
Gfx card at 800x600 results in only the upper left side of it being used,
a large display of memory and source would be nice.

As it stands you get the most out of it when disassembling rather than
debugging. The focus is on the source not the cpu registers, which are
assigned a window at the lower left. Memory is displayed in the lower 
right. All the 68000's registers are displayed but users of higher spec'd 
machines are not catered for; FPU and MMU registers are not displayed. 
68020 address modes and instructions, apart from: CAS, CAS2, CALLM, RTM, 
PACK, UNPK are but again FPU and MMU ones are disassembled into binary 
data. 

Apart from the problems of being stuck in Pal mode and the slight 
clutteredness that it induces this has to be the most versitile tool that 
any programmer will ever use. Even if you own HiSoft's Devpac package and
use Monam it's still worth the sharewere fee because disassembling with 
Disect is far less painless.

Overall, as a simple debugger, it's not as easy to use as others; but if 
you want more than a "simple" tool then this is it.

The latest version of Disect (v2.0b) is available from any aminet site.

@node REVIEW7 "Using the Zip Drive"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                            Using the Zip Drive
  Wolfram Gottfried                                gottfrie@acca.nmsu.edu
===========================================================================

USING IOMEGA'S ZIP DRIVE ON THE AMIGA

     There has been a lot of writing and reviews of Iomega Corporation's
ZIP removable media data drive in the PC and Mac magazines, but finding
information on using this device with the Amiga has been largely a matter
of asking on IRC, experimentation and button pushing.  This article is a
result of my efforts and experimentations, and hopefully will make it
easier for others who wish to make use of this versatile storage device.

WHAT IS IT:

     The ZIP drive is a removable media, high capacity file access storage
device.  For all practical purposes you can call it a removable disk hard
drive although technically it is not traditional hard drive technology.
Physically the drive is slightly wider than the slim-line Amiga external
floppies, about the same width as the old 1010 external floppy but not as
tall.  The disks themselves are about 1/2 wider than a standard 3.5 floppy
and appromixately twice as thick.  The ZIP drive comes in 2 versions, 
either set up for SCSI connection or parallel port connection.  You can't
(to my knowledge) use the parallel port version of the ZIP drive on the
Amiga, however the SCSI version works quite well if your Amiga is equipped
with a SCSI interface.

WILL THE ZIP DRIVE WORK ON THE AMIGA:

     For those who are still unsure - yes the SCSI ZIP will work!  Even
Iomega slips a quick reference to the Amiga in the instructions, giving a
clue as to how to proceed by mentioning low-level formatting the disk that
comes with the ZIP unit (which has PC and Mac software tools).  And that
is pretty much what you have to do, but they don't give any details on HOW
to do this.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

     You don't need any special software for installing the ZIP on your
Amiga if you have OS 2.0 or higher.  All you need is the HDToolBox program
that is included in AmigaOS, or use the hard drive preparation software
for your SCSI controller if it's a 3rd party unit.  3rd party SCSI hard
disk preparation software should also let you use the ZIP with OS 1.3 as
well.  You WILL need a SCSI controller hooked to your Amiga, but a hard
drive is not required.  The ZIP can act as a hard drive if, for some reason,
you have a SCSI controller but no hard disk.  So a SCSI controller (with 25
pin connector or the correct adaptor) and either HDToolBox or 3rd party hard
drive preparation software is all you need.

GETTING STARTED:

     When you buy the ZIP drive it comes with one ZIP disk that contains
Mac and Windows software tools.  If you never intend to use your drive on
either of those machines, you can just reformat that disk.  Otherwise you
may want to consider saving that disk and buying extra ZIP disks (they are
sold in both PC and Mac preformatted format, doesn't matter which you buy
since you will be reformatting them anyway) to reformat into Amiga format.
You'll probably want additional disks anyway.

CONNECTING UP:

     Physically connecting the drive is easy.  Either use the early boot
menus on your Amiga (or some other program that polls the SCSI controller
and reports back the device numbers for devices currently connected to the
SCSI controller), and set the ZIP drive to either device 5 or 6 with it's
built in DIP switches.  If you have both a SCSI device 5 and SCSI device 6
on your system already, you will need to change your configuration around
to free up 5 or 6 for the ZIP drive since it only offers those 2 device
numbers as options.  You'll also need to enable or disable the termination
on the ZIP drive.  If you have some external SCSI devices, make sure that
only the last device in the chain is terminated.  The ZIP documentation
discusses termination fairly clearly.  Just make sure only the last device
is terminated and you should be fine.  If the ZIP is your only external
SCSI device then make sure the termination is enabled.  Hook up the external
power supply and power up the drive and Amiga.  Boot normally and make sure
nothing is acting improper.  If it is you probably need to check your device
numbers and terminations.

FORMATTING THE DISK:

     You'll need to do this for every ZIP disk you plan to use with the
Amiga.  It's exactly the same process as setting up a new hard drive
from scratch, just repeat for each ZIP disk.  You can reformat the disk
that came with the ZIP drive or buy additional blank ZIP disks to use.

  Load up HDToolBox (or other hard drive preparation software).  I won't
  try to give step by step instructions for every possible hard drive
  preparation program available because they are all different.  I use a
  GVP controller and used the GVP FaaastPrep software to set up my ZIP
  disks but the steps are basically the same.  You need to read and save the
  drive configuration (sectors, cylinders, low and high cylinder, etc), 
  low level format the disk, create a partition, write an RDB and then do
  an AmigaDOS format.  I recommend making the ZIP disks one partition
  but if you decide to make your zip disks multiple partitions, make
  sure you make them all IDENTICAL otherwise you'll have to reboot the
  machine for every disk change.  Keep in mind that the Amiga reads the
  disk layout and partition information either from a dosdriver file,
  the RDB of the disk itself or a mountlist entry and mounts the device,
  you can't change parameters for a mounted drive.  Keeping all your
  disks identical in partitioning will let you change without rebooting
  since the mount information will be valid for all of them.

USING THE DRIVE:

     The ZIP drive, once formatted, works just like a hard drive or, more
accurately, a very fast 95 meg floppy.  So using the drive is just like
using any other disk on the Amiga.  There are a few things to watch out for
though:

*  Keeping all the disk partitions the same:  As discussed above, having
   disks with different partition setups could cause problems.

*  Mounting the device:  The ZIP drive will only automount if a disk is in
   the drive when you boot your Amiga.  If you want to have the ZIP device
   available all the time (without having to keep a disk in the drive when
   you boot), you will need to create a mountlist entry or dosdriver file
   so the system can mount the drive without reading the RDB.  Some hard
   drive preparation programs offer the ability to create this file for you,
   otherwise you'll have to write down the information shown when you
   set up the disk for the first time and make your own.  It won't harm
   anything to leave a disk in the drive all the time.  Iomega says in the
   documentation that the drive can be left on all the time without harm,
   and the drive has an automatic spin-down feature which will stop the
   disk after a period of inactivity and automatically spin it back up when
   needed again.  It gets up to speed much faster than a hard drive so this
   isn't really inconvenient.  If the Amiga is booted with a formatted
   disk in the ZIP drive, you can change disks freely (assuming they are all
   formatted the same) because the ZIP drive will remain mounted until the
   next reboot.  If you can't come up with a workable mountlist entry or 
   dosdriver file, just making sure a formatted disk (with an automount RDB)
   is in the drive when you boot will mount it.

*  Booting from the ZIP:  As long as you have formatted a disk, created an
   RDB and installed AmigaOS on the disk, you can boot from the ZIP drive as
   if it were any other hard disk. This could be useful if you need a custom
   bootup or special configuration, but keep in mind that if you boot from 
   the ZIP and then change disks, you'll get the "Please insert volume"
   requestors as if you were running from a single floppy.

*  There is no physical write-protect:  Iomega supplies a software-based
   write protect and password protection for the PC and Mac, but since
   the Amiga just uses it's native file system on the ZIP drive you don't
   get these functions.  In this respect the ZIP acts more like a hard
   drive (which is also doesn't have a hard write-protect mechanism like
   a floppy or tape would).

*  Disk changes: The Amiga handles this very well as long as you don't mix
   formats.  Just eject the disk and the Amiga will pick it up, displaying
   "no disk present" for the ZIP device.  Put another disk in and as long
   as it's formatted the same the Amiga will read it just like changing
   floppies.

*  Networks:  The ZIP drive seems to work just fine through the Envoy
   networking system.  Even disk changes are reflected accurately though
   the network to all systems sharing access to the ZIP drive.

*  Speed:  Iomega says the ZIP drive will do approximately 60 megs/minute
   sustained transfer speed.  On my system I got around 980Kbytes/second
   which is definately close to the manufacturer's specs.  The seek time
   is listed as 29ms, which puts the ZIP drive in the same range as some
   slower hard drives and well ahead of most tape drives.

*  Media durability:  I can't say much on this because I havn't had the
   ZIP drive long enough to make a determination.  Iomega warrants
   the media to be free of defects with a lifetime warranty, but the fine
   print says that this doesn't cover normal wear (read the warranty on
   most floppy disks or data tapes and you'll find the same thing).  I have
   not heard of any problems so far, but it's too new to me to give any
   clear information.

IN CLOSING:
 
     Despite difficulty in obtaining the ZIP drive (demend for these things
is very high and after getting mine I can understand why), I would definately
recommend it for anyone who needs more storage space and/or a backup device.
Having file system access makes it much more convenient than tape for 
retrieving specific files.  The ZIP is fast enough to use like a hard drive,
you can install complete software packages on it and run them from the ZIP,
or store your large data files on it.  The disks are inexpensive (around
$20.00 United States currency) and you can use as many as you need.  For
archiving and backing up, it's much better than using diskettes.

     It may seem like installing one of these drives on the Amiga sounds
complex, but in reality it is no harder than installing a standard hard drive.
If you are familiar with how to do that, then the ZIP will present no 
challenge at all.  It took me less than 5 minutes from the time I opened
the box to have the unit physically hooked up and start formatting. 
Formatting takes a little time.  If Ioemga sold preformatted Amiga disks
for the ZIP drive, installing it would be easier than either the PC or Mac
installation.  The machine I tested the ZIP drive on was an Amiga 2000 with a
GVP Impact II SCSI controller and OS 3.1

                        Amiga Report Mailing List
===========================================================================

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to listserv@itesmvf1.rzs.itesm.mx.

Your subject header will be ignored.  In the body of the message, enter

subscribe areport <your real name>

ie: 

subscribe areport A. R. Reader

The system will automatically pull your e-mail address from the message
header.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!             **

          *** The following is only for Australian readers!  ***

To circumvent the new pay-per-megabyte system for Australian Internet
communication, Paul Reece has been kind enough to set up an AUSTRALIAN-ONLY
mailing list, to save his fellow countrymen some money.

You can join the list by sending mail to:   majordomo@info.tas.gov.au

with the single line (in body of message):

Amiga Report will then be bounced to you.

                          UUDecoding Amiga Report
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

                      Amiga Report Writing Guidelines
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

     4.  Please send us your article in ASCII format.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.

Please stipulate as well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to
the editor.

                  Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users
===========================================================================

                The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
          -------------------------------------------------------

Portal is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-service online SIG
(Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users. We promise, and
WE DELIVER ongoing & aggressive Amiga support!

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in many ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA high-speed modems (you pay for the phone call
if it's not local), or though any SprintNet or Compu$erve indial anywhere
(with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell service!  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help, and you can easily customize
it for your favorite terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1000 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
      once, of any size, with one command.
 * Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, Elastic
      Reality (ASDG), Soft-Logik, Apex Publishing, and others.
 * 40 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 10,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.
 * Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
      related and get quick replies from the experts.
 * Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, AMosaic, LightWave, EGS,
      OpalVision & others feed right into the Zone message bases.  Read
      months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with them.
 * FREE unlimited Internet Email with 5 meg of free storage.
 * A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.
      You can run Amiga Mosaic through your shell and explore the
      vast World Wide Web!
 * Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which you can read
      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine.
 * Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
      never worry "Ooops... Am I paying for this area?" again!
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  And you get FREE unlimited
      usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
      email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
 * Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
      at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
