Writing this is actually harder than I anticipated.  I figured that being
the editor (for a week), I'd want to come up with something profound to
say.  It's not working.

Instead, I'm going to renew an old plea.  WRITE!  Write to us!  Write FOR
us!  We know you're out there, you keep getting the magazine on the
mailing list, we're almost always on the FTP charts, and we've got about
3 dozen distribution sites.  Unfortunately, we'll bore you if there's
nothing in the magazine.  So, to ensure that there IS something, put it
in yourself!

Actually, you don't even have to do the work of putting it in, all you
have to do is write it and send it to Niles.  HE'S the one who has to put
it all together.

It's not hard...my career started with a letter to the editor.  After
getting over the shock of seeing it printed, I wrote the first article in
the long running Emulation Rambler (then Emulation Examiner) column, and
a career of sorts was born.  Try it.  Robert has even been nice enough
to include a real-life US Mail address, so there's very little excuse
for not being capable of submitting articles.

Anyway, on to business.  I think Robert may have forgotten to forward
his mail to me: either that, or there were REALLY no submissions this
week.  I hope it's the former.  I've drawn fairly strongly on
comp.sys.amiga.reviews and my own columns.  But my own observations and
Dan Barrett's staff of freelance reviewers do not a magazine make.

No news on Commodore yet...they're supposed to have a decision deadline
at the end of the month, but they had one of those last month, too, so
I'm not getting overly excited yet.  I tried to talk to Samsung reps
at the CES, but my results were less than ideal, as you'll read in my
CES report...

Finally, sorry it took so long to get AR out this week.  It's been busy,
there was a lot to put in, and I lost the mailer address.  Again, my
fault.

Enjoy the magazine.

AR Mailing List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No Official Amiga Report Distribution Site in your local calling area? Are
you tired of waiting for your local BBS or online service to get Amiga
Report each week?  If so, have we got a deal for you!

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report
in UUENCODED form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put
on the list, send Email to rniles@hebron.connected.com.  Your
account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact copy.
For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.

Many thanks to PORTAL Communications for setting this service up for us!

P.S.:  Please be sure to include your Email address in the text of your
request message, it makes adding it to the list much easier.  Thanks!

** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!

                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
World Wide Web
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AR can also be read with Mosaic (in either AmigaGuide or html form).
Reading AmigaReport with Mosaic removes the necessity to download it.
It can also be read using programs found in UNIX sites such as LYNX.

Simply tell Mosaic to open the following URL:
http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/People/mjw/Computer/Amiga/AR/MainPage.html

Mosaic for the Amiga can be found on Aminet in directory comm/net, or
(using anonymous ftp) on max.physics.sunysb.edu

Mosaic for X, Macintosh(tm) and Microsoft Windows(tm) can be found on
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu


                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Aminet
~~~~~~
To get Amiga Report from Aminet, simply FTP to any Aminet site, CD
to docs/mags. All the back issues are located there as well.
(ftp.cdrom.com or ftp.wustl.edu are two sites)

Ed's note:  Just in case you haven't picked up on this situation from
reading my Retina review, here's the official notice, courtesy of

May 5, 1994, Witten, Germany

	MacroSystem GmbH of Germany Announces
     NoahJi's Exclusive United States Distributor


Jorg Sprave, president of MacroSystem GmbH, located in Witten, Germany,
is pleased to announce the appointment of NoahJi's as the exclusive
distributor of MacroSystem product in the United States.

Technical support, repair, and service will be handled by NoahJi's.
Software updates for the V-Lab and the Retina will also be made
available at a modest charge for current owners of these products.

NoahJi's is the Amiga board division of Micro Reps, Inc. a 10-year-old
distribution company. Eric Kloor, president of NoahJi's, is excited
to begin distribution of the remarkable line of product manufactured
by MacroSystem GmbH.

The Retina Z3, with updated hardware features and astonishingly fast
software, will soon be impressing the US market. In the current issue
of The Amiga Magazine, Germany's largest, 10 different graphics boards
were reviewed. The Z2 Retina was called "nearly legendary, " and in
price/performance comparisons towered above the others. The only more
impressive board in the tests was the new Retina Z3. Both products
received glowing and strong recommendations.

The Toccata 16 bit I/O board, which has been available in Germany for
over 6 months, will now be available for the US market. The V-Lab Y/C
24 bit realtime video digitizer will also join the product mix of
NoahJi's.

An astounding new product that is currently in production and will be
available here in July is the VLab Motion Card. This card is a Zorro
II motion JPEG board for non-linear video editing and playback. The
VLab Motion product contains a digitizer plus a video output device
with YUV 4:2:2 square pixel quality and embedded hardware scaling
and a genlock with chroma keying for real-time blue box effects as well
as the compression/decompression JPEG chipset which runs at 29.5 Mhz
peak frequency. The board has composite and Y/C inputs and outputs,
and also features an expansion socket for add-ons like piggy packed
YUV or RGB component transcoders, and an interface for outputting over
NewTek's Video Toaster. The V-Lab Motion board does not require a time
based corrector and can be combined with existing hard drives and
controllers. VLab Motion also comes with MovieShop, a complete editing
software package that features a hierarchical editor, B/W or color
reference stamps, and a time line editor. Perfect interfacing with the
Retina and the Toccata allow simultaneous recording and playback of
audio and video.

Some letters to @{" David Tiberio " link P8-4}.
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Q. Many readers frequently ask, "Could you please email me the latest issue
of Amiga Report?"

A. Absolutely NOT! Why? I don't get them until a week after they are
released, so chances are when you ask me for it I haven't gotten it yet
either! I just subscribed to the Amiga Report Mailing List, which uuencodes
and emails me the latets issue the day it is released. I merely sent
email to rniles@hebron.connected.com and gave him my return address. He
replied that they have very few subscribers. :)

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Q. Many people also ask about the List of Famous Amiga Uses, a monthly
list of people and companies that use the Amiga. "Could you please email
me the latest version?"

A. Well, I wish I could, but it is over 50 pages long, pushing 100k in
size. Most email is not safe unless it is under 32k in size, although
many systems do accespt larger files (I can get at least 100k myself).
In actuality, I haven't updated it since March or so, and it is about
time I release another one on Aminet. I will keep you all posted, and
promise to make them available by request in the mail. I just have to
figure out an easy way to do it from my mailx program. :)

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Q. "What is your opinion on the situation with Commodore?"

A. When the time comes, I will eventually have to buy a new system. I see
no reason to abandon the platform at this point in time. In fact, we became
an Amiga dealer on the day that CBM annunced its liquidation at the
beginning of April! I am giving them at least until the end of the summer
to see what will happen. In the mean time, I am buying a Macintosh
emulator. I would prefer an IBM system, but I feel that I can set that as
a goal to meet later in the year.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Q. "Why doesn't my Amiga Report display pictures properly?"

A. Well, it appears our fearless editor misread one of the instructions
that I had modified. Originally, the Installer script generated the image
viewer based upon what display program you had available. The new display
driver supports most viewers in one driver, and our editor had not
included that driver with the archive. Hopefully this will be resolved in
the future!

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Q. "Why didn't the AmigaDOS scripts article have working scripts?"

A. Simple. They did work, until my UNIX system ate all the ".key" commands
from mailx, and sent them as "key" commands, which are not valid AmigaDOS
script commands.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Q. "What happened to Omega RIPort magazine?"

A. After saving enough articles for a few more issues, I found that it
was too much work to edit all the articles into a standard format, and
my fingers hurt from typing so much as it is! Maybe if CBM changes hands
this week, there may be a new version out!

I actually got a piece of mail this week, too...

From: jason.eyre@kosone.com (Jason Eyre)
Subject: Editorial
Date: Tue, 21 Jun 1994 19:47:00 -0400
Organization: Kingston Online Services 613-549-8667


        I've been an avid reader of AmigaReport for quite some time and
think that it is an excellent source for information.  But I'm a little
disappointed that there aren't any editorials.  Is there any reason for
this?

[I already replied to Mr. Eyre personally, but it's worth responding here,
too...]

Well, I have always considered the Editor's Desk an editorial source,
even if Robert Niles isn't a rabble-rouser. :)  At the same time, my
compt.sys.amiga column has, to me, all the trappings of an editorial.
If you'd like to see more opinion, though, let us know and we'll try to
help.  At the same time, anybody is free to submit opinion pieces to the
magazine.

I had been looking forward to the CES for quite some time...it had always
seemed like the place to be when you wanted to see new, amazing products.

After all, the Amiga was introduced at one.

So far, I've been a bit disappointed from the computer angle.  Very, very
new computer-oriented products are being shown, the exception being new
software lines like Paramount.  Of course, many of these new lines won't
be supporting the Amiga, since, as a Paramount rep told me, "We're in this
to make money.  We're not doing this to make other people's platforms
attractive."  So much for wanting to be on the ground floor.

The show is broken up into two major areas: the East building, which I
refer to as the "quiet one", featuring large Philips, 3DO, and Gemini
displays, with a host of other consumer electronic devices, a few of
which are actually pretty impressive (and which I'll actually include in
the magazine this week and next), and the North, or "loud one", with
all of the games: Nintendo, Sega, Ocean, Paramount, MTV, etc. etc.  A
few of the gaming magazines have actually set up booths, I guess to make
them seem more journalistic.

I HAVE been walking around, trying to get information, and relating it
to the Amiga if I can.  So I'll try to get the Amiga news out of the way
first.

1.  ReadySoft will be distributing Robinson's Requiem in North America, 
probably around Christmastime.  It's a CD32 title by Silmarlis.

2.  Inferno, another CD32 title, is scheduled for CD32 release around
Christmas, a couple of months after the PC introduction.  (incidentally,
the game looked good on their PC).

3.  Samsung is there, so I figured I'd try asking around.  I went into the
super-special Samsung reception room and left my card and my question,
"Is Samsung bidding for the Commodore Amiga technology?", because nobody
there knew what I was talking about.  A fellow Amigan who I ran into at
the show said that he talked to a Samsung rep who said that Samsung was
still in it and waiting for a response, but since I didn't talk to this
rep I can't be convinced.  On Saturday, I checked back in, and they
still didn't know.

4.  Blue Ribbon was supposedly there, but I never managed to find them.

5.  MicroProse is going to drop Amiga support, in all likelihood.

6.  A rep from Westwood told me to sell my Amiga and "get a real computer."

7.  Ocean bought the license to 6 new EA titles.  Unfortunately, they only
got the UK license (or perhaps only the Europe license.)  I asked David
Size of EA if he knew why they couldn't get the US licenses.  He didn't
know, since he's a game producer and doesn't deal with licensing.

8.  Psygnosis is still supporting the Amiga.  The sequel to Microcosm,
which is now nameless because of a legal dispute, was being shown on
the FM-Towns console (which, incidentally, has a bad controller).  It
looked decent.  Same gameplay, mainly, just in a more open space.

9.  I had a GREAT conversation with a rep from Maxis UK.  She was very
enthusiastic about the Amiga, and while she admitted that they don't
port everything over to it, pointed out that they do the games that they
feel "need" to be on the Amiga.  Unfortunately, I didn't get her name.

(By this point in the show, I had been sent to see so many UK reps I was
considering going to software companies and simply asking, "Excuse me,
is anybody here British?")

That about does it for Amiga news.  On with the show...

1.  Yeah, yeah, The 3DO Company has a huge section.  Actually, they just
have a bunch of meeting rooms and reps, but have sublet a lot of that
space to Panasonic, Samsung, Sanyo, and GoldStar, all of whom have their
3DO boxes present.  They were in the East building, away from other games.

Panasonic:  Still has that "castle-shaped" unit, still has controllers
that shock you through the speaker port (I actually got a few Panasonic
and 3DO reps to admit that they have a problem with it!), and is coming
out with an MPEG module and memory card.

MPEG module:  Latches onto the right side as you look straight at it, a
boring black rectangle.  No release date, no price.

Memory card:  Uses the PCMCIA 1 standard size, but their own proprietary
cards anyway.  The prototype was in a big ugly box about the size of
an ORIGINAL external Amiga floppy drive, except this one was black.
The memory card (128k) is tiny and sticks out of it.  No price, no date.

Also, Panasonic is working on implementing a "second-generation" 3DO
box, which may very well be a cost-reduced, no-expansion-port model.

Panasonic ALSO had a PAL 3DO on display, cleverly hooked up to a PAL
TV so it didn't look like crap to the Americans.  (come on, say it
with me...)  "No price, no date."

Samsung:  Probably has the most attractive unit in existance.  What can
I say, it plays 3DO games.  No price, no date.

Sanyo:  Ugly box.  Plays 3DO games, although the sound seemed to be
lower quality than the others.  That may just be the Sanyo TVs they had
the boxes hooked up to, though.  <shrug>  No price, no date.

GoldStar:  Box similar to Samsung's.  Plays 3DO games. 
No price, no date.

I asked representatives from each company this question:  "What will
be your selling angle?  What will make the consumer buy YOUR 3DO box
over someone else's?"  I think I could have given these answers myself.

Panasonic:  Name recognition, status in the 3DO market, possible cost
reductions.

Samsung:   May include the MPEG module in their unit, but maybe not.

Sanyo:  I'm not really sure, their rep spoke lousy English.  The upshot,
though, was that they would market it and try to bring it in cheaply.

GoldStar:  This guy seemed to have learned English from the Sanyo guy
, and was about as helpful.  Same story.

Also, Creative Labs has a cleverly titled product called the 3DO Blaster.
This is an 8-bit ISA card with the 3DO chipset that, if armed with a
SoundBlaster and a sufficient double-speed CD-ROM drive, will play 3DO
games on Windows or DOS (although the Creative guy seemed puzzled that
anyone would want to play it on DOS.)  The 3DO board passes through the
normal VGA output and adds its own graphics, if the 3DO is in use.
Creative also plans a 3DO MPEG board to go with this.  Date:  none.
Price:  "Well under $500", which we all know probably means $489.99.
They did such an impressive job of showing it multitask, too: they
had MINESWEEPER loaded at the same time as the 3DO.  Oh dear, looks
like the Amiga's been surpassed.

Want my analysis on the situation?  With all the games present, it
doesn't seem like 3DO will be folding overnight.  HOWEVER, I think that
the "new 3" haven't thought their plans through well enough, and I
predict that Panasonic will win unless they misprice their units...
of course, they have already, but that's because they CAN.

Creative's board is a nice idea, but unfortunately is rather silly.
You will be paying roughly the same cost as a new 3DO ($480 at Software
Etc. these days) for just a card that will require you to have a CD-ROM
and SoundBlaster already installed (BTW, all the SB does is amplify the
3DO-generated sound.)  The MPEG board will NOT (that's NOT) be accessable
by the PC, meaning that if you've got a ReelMagic card or would like to
use your 3DO MPEG for a PC program, too bad.  The Creative rep ALSO
admitted that there would be some problems with recognizing different
varieties of MPEG movies and 3DO games, but their hope was that the
white book standard would emerge supreme.  For what looks like it will
be the cost of a FULL 3DO unit, you can buy JUST A CARD that requires
you already have a SB and a double-speed CD-ROM.  Somehow, I think PC
users will take a pass and go for a cheaper, full unit, unless they 
already own both pieces of hardware.  Hopes and promises.

Moving on across the aisle, Philips is putting on a blitz for the CD-i.
Too bad they haven't improved on it.  I will admit, though, they're
trying, and the games are getting more exiting.  Unfortunately, they
all require the MPEG module.  Perfect case in point is Microcosm.

I walked over to where the Microcosm disk was and asked the Philips
rep to start it up.  He did, and the intro began.  I had to admit
to myself, it looked a touch better than the CD32 version, although
the music was not as good.  At any rate, it played for a while, and
I asked (because I didn't know), "This is the base unit?"

The replay:  "The base unit and the Full Motion Video cartridge."

Ah.  THAT put a new spin on it.  Now I was looking at an intro that,
while looking somewhat sharper than the CD32 version, required an 
extra $250 to run.  (The gameplay, incidentally, was not discernably
superior.  It had a first-person perspective, however.)

Philips is trying to permutate the CD-i into lots and lots of new
forms...TVCD-i being one, a 20 inch TV with a CD-i built in.

They're also coming out with a new, low-cost box for $300.  Its
MPEG module will run another $200, for a grand total of $500 required
to play Microcosm.  It's a box, smaller in every dimension than
the CD32, with a medium grey case and little visibility inside the
CD drive.

If any of you have ever seen a CD-i, you've probably noticed that
their controllers are horrible, hard-to use, poorly-laid-out affairs.
Even the Philips guys don't like them.  However, they're coming out
with a new gamepad-like controller for their new line.

Something looked REALLY, REALLY familiar about this pad, but I 
couldn't place it.

Finally, my companion, Katie Nelson, figured it out.  "Why does this
pad look so much like a Gravis Gamepad?"

The Philips rep clamped his hand over his mouth in mock horror and
said, "Well, you just said it.  Yeah, they make them for us."

The upshot from that display:  CD-i has some decent games, IF you
have the MPEG module.  If not...you may as well have bought a CD32,
it's better.
  
Gravis:  (on the subject)  Gravis is coming out with a wicked-huge
flightstick/programmable pad.  This sucker is huge, sporting about
20 programmable buttons, two functions each, a joystick AND a joypad...
for flight-sim enthusiasts, this is home.

Paramount:  A nice big display in the Loud building, featuring some
new Star Trek games and Nana Visitor from Deep Space Nine (who,
incidentally, looks much smaller in person.)

Sir-Tech:  I haven't made it to them yet, but they included a disk
with press releases in the press packet.  THAT, I like.  Too bad
none of them are very relevant to the magazine.

I saw the Gunvertor!  They had a couple of company representatives
there, plus a busty blonde in a tight black bodysuit.  Somehow, I
figured as much.  (If you don't remember the Gunvertor, I mentioned
it a week or two ago.  It's a $70 universal remote in the shape of
a handgun.)

I haven't been able to track down the Amazing Computing people,
which is really a shame, because I was looking forward to talking
with them.

I've got some press releases: some computer/game oriented, some of
just cool items on display.  I'll be entering them over the next
month or so, since only Sir-Tech had the foresight to include a
disk for the press...

Subject: *** CREATIVE COMPUTERS LIE THROUGH THEIR TEETH ***
Date: 13 Jun 1994 16:28 -0400
Organization: DECUServe

This is a warning to all interested parties that CREATIVE COMPUTERS of
Torrance, California, sells their products by telling BALD-FACED LIES about
features and functionality.  I certainly will never do business with them
again and I felt that everybody should be aware of their business
practices.  Here's what happened:

Short version:  

Prior to ordering a software product, I asked very specifically whether or
not the product contained certain functionality, and I received assurances
that it did.  I bought it, and the product does _NOT_ do what they
promised.  CREATIVE COMPUTERS themselves later confirmed this.  Despite the
prior promises, they refuse to accept a return.  I am now pursuing recourse
through VISA.  


Long version:

I recently bought (not from CREATIVE COMPUTERS) a Power Point high density
external floppy drive for my Amiga 1200.  It works great, except for the
fact that the utility I was using for backups (HDBackup, it came installed
on the 1200 when I bought it) did not take advantage of the high density
feature of the drive.  It uses the drive ok, it just writes to the floppy
in its standard double-density proprietary format.  Anyway, since I now
have this high density capability, I thought (silly me) that it would be
nice to have a backup utility that ACTUALLY USED the high densityness of
the drive.  So I read old reviews of backup products and proceeded to call
CREATIVE COMPUTERS to ask them about two products, Ami-Back and
Quarterback. I spoke to a sales-type by the name of JIM HOUSKA, who assured
me in no uncertain terms that Ami-Back does not use the high density
feature of the drive (it turns out it actually does), and that Quarterback
does absolutely write in high density with the Power Point drive (it turns
out it doesn't) and is also the best backup product in the Known Universe. 
So I ordered Quarterback (unaware that its maker, Central Coast Software /
New Horizons, was in the midst of going out of business).  Not only does
Quarterback not write the floppies in high density, it absolutely will
_NOT_ write to a HD floppy in the HD drive at all in any density.  It will
write to a DD floppy in the HD drive, and it will write to a HD floppy in
the DD drive, but with a HD floppy in the HD drive the entire backup bombs
right out.

So I called CREATIVE COMPUTERS, explained the problem and asked for a
Return Authorization number and a refund.  No, I was told, but thanks for
asking.  They actually confirmed that my results were in fact the truth;
the blasted thing didn't work, no way, no how.  I spoke to Jim Houska, the
sales guy who got me into this.  I spoke to "Veronica C.", who would not
give her last name.  I TRIED to speak to Veronica's manager, "Bill M."
(Veronica wouldn't give me his name, either), but Bill doesn't answer his
phone and doesn't respond to his voice mail.  Jim Houska freely admitted
that he had promised me the thing would work ("I really thought it would,
honest", he said).  But no, I could not have a refund.  I explained to them
that since I had purchased this thing with VISA, I had certain rights, and
that I would pursue a refund through VISA.  They seem a bit confused by
this, but didn't change their minds.

So I packed the thing up in mint condition and sent it to their return
department by U.S. Mail with RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, together with a
letter requesting a refund.  I later received the Return Receipt, proof
that they accepted delivery.  A few days ago, I received the package back
(they had obviously opened it), marked "Delivery Refused - Return to
Sender".  Without re-opening it, I returned it to the U.S. Post Office
together with the signed Return Receipt, and the U.S. Postal Service
happily accepted it for return to CREATIVE COMPUTERS.  I am now in process
of having VISA issue a charge back against CREATIVE.  

CREATIVE COMPUTERS WILL LOSE THIS DISPUTE!  I WILL GET MY MONEY 
BACK
THROUGH VISA.  Why they even bother to try this type of tactic is beyond
me.  There are regulations, I do have rights to protect me against such
thieves, and they will lose.  They are not being very "creative" if you ask
me.  What is obvious is that they have only one objective:  sell product
at all costs and by any means, even if it involves lying.  They have lost
at least one customer, and I would advise all you to stay away from them.

Although it's sad and upsetting to see, hear of, or experience these
kind of stories, I am glad they are posted instead of just being swallowed

more powerful than any "comsumer protection" law could ever hope to be.

Companies that screw the customer by making fraudulent statements should
be put out of business. Filing charges cost money, clogs the courts, and
in general wastes resources that could be better spent on other things.
Rather, simply putting them out of business by letting people know about
them is much more effective.

I hope both of you come out of your situations without too much damage
done, and thanks for spreading the word.

BTW, for anyone who's thinking about flaming someone who posts such

 I've had numerous problems with Creative and advise everyone to stay
away from them for the past few years. A friend of mine had a defective
4000 and he sent it back to them for repairs. While it was sitting around
waiting for the new motherboard, the technicians were having fun playing
the games that were on his hard drive. When the board finally came in,
it was shipped back and everything seemed fine until he put a Zorro III
type card and problems occured constantly. I told him that it could be
an old version fo the Buster chip and sure enough, it was. After complaining
to Creative for some time that when it was sent in, it had the leatest revision,
the tech guy said, "Well, to know that you have an old version means you
opened the case and your warrantee is voided so we can't do anything
for you." Well after some serious bitching and threat of a law suit,
they agreed to take it back.
	Also their adds showing fully stocked warehouse is crap. The
picture is back from the Amiga 500 days and they are trying to sell off
their amiga stock and further support the Mac platform.

I have encountered similar problems with Creative Computers, however, all
turned out alright in the end.  I had ordered a Bodega Bay unit from them for
my Amiga 500.  I really was steamed when upon opening the box, (after waiting
for it to come in stock and to ship it), I discovered that it was physically
damaged.  There was a terrible scrape on the side and the cover did not fit
on properly.  Thus, I was not willing to accept it in this condition.  I
telephoned my local UPS office and explained to them I have received my
parcel in a damaged condition.  Their representative asked me to check to box
for any visible damage.  Of course, there wasn't any.  Therefore, I was able
to conclude that Creative likely knew of the damage before hand, and shipped
it to me in this condition.  After telephoning Creative they helped me get a
RETURN AUTHORIZATION, and UPS picked up the defective unit, and eventually I
got a new one that was okay.  I still believe that Creative has a sort of
creepy business practice, and I am still leary about ordering from them,
although I probably would since I live in California and their products get
to me reasonable fast.

    Just wanted to get my two cents worth in.  I also had problems with
Creative Computing.  Last month when I got my Amiga World, I couldn't
believe the prices on some of the stuff.  I called and waited on the line
for one and a half hours before I talked to a human, of the list of items
that I wanted (about 10), they only had one... a 49 cent magazine...
    Imagine my surprise when I opened up this months Amiga World to see
another add by Creative Computing with some more "amazing deals."  Well,
I found something very interesting in there...  they had the DKB 1202
memory board in the add three times with three different prices.  One
box showed  $119 for the board with no description of what was included
with the board, another was $99 for the board with no memory, no math co,
with clock, and another (this is not a mistake) for $79 with a 14mhz math
coprocessor (68881).  Well, I figured I would give it a shot, I called and
got through with no wait.  To my surprise they had ONE left in stock, so I 
ordered it.  Well, I got it, it works, and I know they had to have made a
mistake, because my friend paid $149 for the same deal about 6 months ago.
So maybe that will bring some satisfaction, to know that they screwed up, to 
those of you who got screwed.

Hey, I have a Creative Computers story also...

About six months ago I wanted to buy a hard drive for my 1200.  I ordered 
one from Creative Computers over the phone with my Visa and made sure 
that it was going to be shipped overnight.  I waited for 5 days and 
nothing happened, no call, no invoice, no hard drive.  I called back on 
the sixth day and asked what the problem was and they told me the drive I 
ordered was out of stock.  I asked why they couldn't have bothered 
telling me that when I placed the order so I wouldn't be hanging around 
the house for 5 days waiting for a shipment, and why they made a point of 
telling me that they wouldn't be able to ship it the day I ordered it, 
but it wouldn be shipped in the morning.  Then they told me the drive had 
been on backorder for a couple of months.  I just told them to cancel my 
order and got a snippy "As you wish, sir." in reply.
Needless to say I called another company that same day, ordered the same 
drive for 5 dollars more and got it the next day.
Creative Computers will not be getting my business again.

My purchase of Quarterback was not my first encounter with Creative, I've
ordered things from them before and those orders arrived without exceptional
delays and in working order. But with previous purchases I never had a
problem that required trying to work with their Customer Service department,
or trying to get a refund.  As for Quarterback, I've had several users of
that product make the same suggestion that you make, and I appreciate all
your help.  However, as I understand it, the external HD drive from Power
Point differs from Commodore's A4000 internal drive in that Commodore's
drive is recognized as a native device, whereas the third-party drive
requires that a patch be run during startup, and apparently this is what
causes the problem with some (most?) backup programs which use proprietary
formats.  AmigaDOS itself has no trouble at all writing to this drive.
Nevertheless, your suggestion may in fact allow Quarterback to work, I
don't really know.  My question is this: why didn't Creative's Customer
Service people make that suggestion?  Did they check it out, try it?
They told me they had investigated the question and that there was
absolutely no way to make it work.  I have no way to know if they were
telling me the truth or not.  Whatever, as I said in my original
posting, I packed it up and sent it back, they sent it back to me again,
and I refused delivery right back at them.  It's up to Visa now.

In any case, the replies from others who have related their horror stories
with Creative Computers are enough to convince me that my problem with them
is anything but an aberration.  Based on the replies in this thread, it
seems to me that ANY order with Creative that goes without a hitch is due
to sheer luck.  Despite your good fortune, there is no defense for Creative.

P.S. I just received my Ami-Back.  It works!  And you don't have to go

[Note about Memory World deleted]

Brad,
	I have had several business dealings with Memory World and have
never had a problem with their service.  When I needed to get more RAM for
my SupraRAM board I didn't even know what I needed (ZIPS, SIMS) and the 
person who took my order knew exactly what my board would take and even 
saved me some money by recommending slower chips than what a friend had
told me.  He made his recommendation because he knew the specs of my board
and even explained it all in laymans terms so that I'd understand.

	Also I've had many friends buy products from them and never have
any of the problems you've described.  My guess is that you've just had a
run at extremely bad luck with your equipment <and I know how that sucks>.

     YACCHS - Yet Another Creative Computers Horror Story.  

     The attitude exhibited by Creative Computers is nothing new.  A 
few years ago I purchased an A2000 HD from them, NOT.  In the 
beginning, delivery was prompt - so far, so good.  I booted my new 
machine: I only had chip ram, and the HD didn't show.  Reboot.  
Nothing changed.  Find the Phillips screwdriver and remove the 
cover.  
     
     Imagine my surprise when I saw a virtually empty case - this 
was a stock 2000 - no HD and no extra memory.  I checked the 
box . . . yep, it said Amiga 2000 HD, as did the badge on the CPU.  
The waybill said the package originated in West Chester.  I assume 
that the box was stuffed by CBM and "disassembled" by Creative (who 
resold the components).

     I called Creative - no, I couldn't ship the unit to them and 
still get it back in time to meet my deadline.  "But, you could 
bring it in to our shop," the anonymous voice encouraged me.  Their 
shop was 120 miles away.  

     Reluctantly, I made the long drive north.  At Creative, the head

tech set me up with no questions (no one apologized either). 
Nevertheless,
their original intent lingered, and I've not bought from them since.

     Lately, I've been patronizing DevWare.  Their advertising 
emphasizes video, but they have a good mix of hardware and software 
(including PD).  I don't know their phone, but they have multi-page 
ads in Amiga World and VTU.

Subject: Another Creative Story

Robert:

Here is a Creative Computers story that is fairly short, but puzzling to me 
even now.

I called Creative in April to obtain SBase4 Pro from Oxxi.  They told me it 
wasn't in stock, but should be shipping next week.  I waited a month and 
called Oxxi to see why they weren't shipping.  They told me SBase4 had been 
out quite a while and they had just sent out their last `printing' a week 
ago.  They would be making another shipment in another week.  They asked me 
why I was concerned, and I told them I had ordered from Creative.  They 
said, "Oh, we have had some problems with them." Nothing more specific.

I immediately called Creative to cancel the order.  The clerk asked me if I 
still wanted the other item on backorder.  I searched my memory and 
cleverly asked him what it was (since I couldn't remember).  It was a 
European magazine that I had ordered in November!  After getting somebody 
else's permission (maybe his manager) he cancelled both orders.

I don't understand how Creative can be so incompetent and stay in business.

On a more upbeat note, I finally recieved SBase4 from another mail order 
concern (Savannah, GA doesn't enjoy a Commodore dealer's service).  It 
arrived with a German DML manual (one of two) and a defective disk.  Oxxi 
quickly sent me the English manual, but still hasn't replaced the defective 
disk (I am sure another call will cure that).  Maybe all this is due to 
depression over Commodore's situation, monitor radiation, or something more 
insidious.  Just make sure your publication doesn't catch the disease!

Part Two:  Eye to Eye With the Retina

Wow.  That's a lousy pun.  I hope at least nobody's used it before.

At any rate, this week I'll tell you how the Retina actually PERFORMS.

RetinaEmu and Retargeting
-------------------------

The entire Retina mechanism is activated by a program called RetinaEmu.
This is the program that wakes up the board and tells it to start targeting
opened screens to the Retina display hardware unless specified otherwise.
At its heart is an emulation of the Workbench screen.

So how does that look?  Well, you can put it in 8, 16, or 24-bit color depth.
You can put it in a variety of screen sizes: I stick with the 800x480, 8-bit
depth setting, but it can go higher.  It looks good.  The window updates are
snappy and smooth, the pointer is flawless...in general, it's a formidable
display, better than the delaced view on my 3000's native display.  It is
an ideal place to run programs that have Workbench capabilities but are
otherwise impractical for use: for example, Terminus flickers when it scrolls
on my 3000's display.  Through the Retina, however, it is fairly smooth and
has a bare minimum of flicker.

If you choose to open a Retina screen for a program, be aware that you
MAY be in for some problems.  Some programs just don't come out looking
quite right, like Terminus (which gives a nasty light blue-green border
instead of basic black).  Other programs, like Final Copy II, choke if you
try to increase their color display by more than they like-32 or greater.
Placing Terminus on a public screen, though, greatly improves appearance.

The resolution for any new screen is the default, set in the RetinaEmu program.
You can set defaults for 8, 16, and 24-bit screens, in any of the resolutions
available for the particular mode (quite a few!).  I have had great success 
with this, even on programs that are not terrifically programmed or programs
that still date back to 1.3 compatibility (DirWork looks funny in 1024x768, or
1200x800).

The resolution for these screens can be changed too, through RetinaEmu,
which lists screens it has to open by their name, and recognizes them
internally by this list of items, in the order it checks:

Public Screen name
Window name
Program title

This means that just about everything will register.  You can edit and change
the set resolution at any time, but it won't take effect until that particular
screen is opened again.

As I've said, the overall result is very pleasing.  Windows move crisply,
smoothly, and often in lots and lots of colors.  Screens can be thrown into
new, bizarre screen modes, although their reactions will vary.

Some programs that rely on heavy video-banging won't work well in
their new environment...emulators like the Spectrum, A64, and PC-Task
come to mind.  But for native Amiga applications, it's very effective.

RetinaDisplay:  Show me some pictures!

RetinaDisplay is the packaged program that is responsible for displaying
pictures directly to the Retina.  Among the 10 or so formats supported
are IFF and JPEG, the two most useful of the list.  However, notable in
its absence is GIF.  This means that the Retina needs a program like
Viewtek's Retina version to bring it up to speed with a large amount of
the available pictures out there.

The program itself gets its screenmode from the RetinaScreenMode
utility, with modes down to 320x200 8bit up to 1200x900 interlaced 24-bit
on my 1950 monitor.  (Conspicuously absent from the monitor list is
the 1960.)  You also have the option to display pictures on the Workbench,
but it seems like the settings necessary to get this are elusive: Donovan
at NoahJi's tech support talked me through what I needed, and it still
didn't work.  That's happened to other people he's told as well.  I HAVE
seen it, though, and it's the only way you can scroll pictures: if you let the
Retina open up a screen for the pic, it can't be scrolled.

The quality of the display, of course, depends on your monitor and the
mode the screen is in.  I'm pleased with the results, but am very glad
that Vt_Retina exists, because otherwise a large amount of graphics
would be fairly useless for Retina users.

VDPaint:  Draw some yourself!
-----------------------------

There's really not much reason for me to fully review this section.
I'll tell you why:

1.  I have no other experience with 24-bit paint programs.
2.  They didn't send me a manual.

That being said, I'll at least give you the rundown on VDPaint.

You select the 24-bit screen you would like to draw on using the
good old RetinaScreenMode program.  From there, if you start the program,
a paint screen opens up on a true Retina-only screen, with a message
that contains a bit of German and the warning that the software version
only works on a Retina.  Well, ok, fine.

Control is simple...the right mouse button brings up a window full of option
buttons.  Too bad I don't know what all of them do.  A couple of nice features:
The disk loader supports a sort of thumbnail file format that gets displayed
in a small window on the requester.
JPEGs can be loaded and saved in different compressions, but still no
GIF support here.
The text functions support even the rattiest of old Amiga fonts, and with
shading, too.

Of course, it IS free, so there's not much room for complaint.

One thing that interests me is that, up until now, I've heard of people
getting XiPaint with their Retinas.  I think this is the same program, as 
there is a directory with "XiPaint" in the name...

The operation itself seems smooth, with a wide variety of brushes and some
clever color cycling routines.  Personally, I can't take advantage of this
software.  Please, if any users are making more use of it, send me your
thoughts and I'll incorporate them.

Final comment for the week:  My Retina has been failing to start lately
on a cold boot.  It started out as just requiring about 5 minutes to warm
up before a warm boot would recognize it...now I'm at an hour or so.
Donovan at NoahJi's has a similar problem, but he's usually able to
do an immediate warm boot and get the Retina (both of us are using
3000s).  I can't explain, it didn't happen during my first week of testing.
Neither can he.

Next week, I'll have to wrap up my review with some final thoughts and
comments...and I have to ship it back, too!  I was just getting used to this...
grrr...

- THE PRIZE FOR NEXT MONTH -

CONTEST BEGINS: 6-17-94
CONTEST ENDS: 7-15-94

The Amiga Report contest is still going on, and it is not too
late to enter. This ongoing monthly contest allows Amiga Report
readers a chance to win software by either solving a puzzle or by
entering a random drawing.

The prize this month is the Amiga Online Reference Manual v2.3,
from Area52. This is a 1,000 page help system for the Amiga and Video
Toaster, covering the Workbench, AmigaDOS, Lightwave, and more ($34.95).

The second prize choice is the FutureShock audio CDROM,  which was
produced using Amiga computers by SideWinder. There are some Sidewinder
music modules on Aminet that you may want to look at for a sample of
the audio CD ($12.95).

The third prize to choose from is CG52jr, a character generator
from Area52. This CG includes 15 scalable fonts, and supports various
dither styles, shadows, and other text effects. IFF images may also
be loaded, along with 100 predefined palettes. Text can be genlocked
live or saved as IFF files ($24.95).

Winners may also select CG52 Fonts, which includes 50 scalable
fonts for use with the CG52jr character generator, the Workbench, and
most Amiga applications that support BitMap or CompuGraphic fonts
($19.95).

Previously we have offered the ARexx Reference Disk by Merrill
Callaway, which was awarded to a previous winner. Contact Whitestone
for more information (505) 268-0678.

All monthly contests end on the morning of the first of the
following month. Any entries beyond this date will be entered into the
next contest.


- THE MONTHLY DRAWING -

To enter the random drawing, select a number from 1 to 262,144
and send it to me at one of my addresses listed below, either by
the postal service or email through the Internet.
Also, you may enter by solving the following puzzle. The winner
of this puzzle will be decided within the same time frame as the
random prize, to allow the contest information to filter through the
networks, and to allow your letters and postcards to come in.

The winner for June 1994 will be published next week.


- THE PUZZLE -

Everyone thinks that the other code problem was too easy, which
it was. So this month I made it a bit tricky (and I don't want to
hear any complaints that the solutions are too hard)! This is a
transcript of a press conference about a military operation somewhere
in the United States. Your job is to figure out which companies are
involved. In the next few issues I will make the clues gradually
become easier.

    Gore, the Vice President, made the statement.
    He said he would, but very quietly.

    The engineers are locked up on the island.
    They are computer experts.

    They are no longer incorporated, but AmigaGuide is stored there.
    That is why their fort is so valuable.
    The banner on the building reads "BRCH".

    The surface to air missile drowned in the sea.
    Squad A had to move into the area at 5:00pm, as they always do.
    Strategic Operations in  New York handled the affair.
    They landed opposite their destination.
    There is no other way to calm the port.

    The rest will be printed at a later time.


- TO ENTER -

To enter, simply let your fingers do the talking and write an
email and send it to dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu. You MUST put
the word CONTEST in the subject line of the email header! Otherwise
you run the risk of having your email deleted (don't ask, it is a
long story!) or send a post card or letter to:

Amiga Report Contest
c/o David Tiberio
6 Lodge Lane
East Setauket, NY 11733

Is it possible to win via snail mail? You might think that your
chances of winning are better by entering in email (much faster of
course), but one month's winner sent in a letter that arrived the
day before his winning number was drawn!

In your letter or email, please provide the following, using this
format:

RANDOM_NUMBER postal_address
              email_address

Such as:
4761615 David Tiberio, 6 Lodge Lane, East Setauket, NY 11733
        dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu

Your full name and address. Please keep in mind that many of
you may have addresses that I am not accustomed to, so please include
your country or any other information that I would need in case you
win. An email address should also be included, if possible.

You must also include a brief one sentence overview of the editorial
in this issue of AMiga Report. Just to make sure you are reading it. :)
You must also include the issue number. For example, if you read this in
AR213, then include that in your correspondance. Also, a prize winner
will be determined by a random number generator. Choose a number from
1 to 262,144. The closest winner or winners to the randomly generated
number will receive the prize in the mail. Anyone who does not provide
a number will have one assigned to him randomly.

All prizes will be mailed within one week after I get my hands on
the published version of AmigaReport. I am doing this for a few reasons.
First, every winner so far has given the correct puzzle solution before
I have received the editon of AmigaReport that announced it. :)
Second, I don't like to go to the post office every day if I can avoid
it. Third, you never know when someone's power supply might blow up
(right Mr. Editor?!).


- RULES AND REGULATIONS -

1. In the event that the editor's power supply fries, the contest for
   that month will have its deadline postponed to a later date, to be
   announced. Any contest entries for the random drawing will be added
   to the next month's drawing, to be held once per month near the
   beginning of the month.

2. All prizes are donated. I cannot be held responsible for any damage
   caused by a prize. For example, if you leave your prize on the
   stairs and your grandmother slips on it, I will not pay her medical
   bills.

3. We are not doing this for any profit, and cannot be held responsible
   if we go out of business or are otherwise financially unable to give
   you anything! We are actively looking for submissions from other
   software authors.

4. Good things come to those who read the rules and regulations! Here
   is a tip to help you win: every problem is a trick problem, or gives
   you clues that are not part of the problem itself. Read the whole
   entire contest entry looking for clues. And read my other articles
   for more clues. I give some very obvious clues :).

5. If for any circumstance you are awarded a prize but do not receive
   it, contact me at (516) 476-1615. I will promptly attend to any
   mistakes that have been made.

6. These rules are subject to change at any time without warning!

7. Each line of the press release has the name of a company.

8. All contest entries must be received within the dates listed at the
   top of this page. A new puzzle is published each month.

9. Don't post the answer to public forums!


- THE DISCLAIMER -

DISCLAIMER: This contest is being provided as a service to the
Amiga community and all persons involved in running this contest
cannot be held liable for anything that costs you money or
lifetime pain and anguish. Rules are subject to change. All entries
must be received by whenever TBA. Any entries beyond this date
will be entered into the next contest, if any.


- THE CHANCE YOU WILL WIN -

Odds of winning are approximately 1:50 for the random drawing and
1:15 for the correct answer to the puzzle, based upon current entries.

SPECIAL THANKS to SideWinder for donating the Future Shock albums
for inclusion in our contest, along with Merrill Callaway for his ARexx
Reference Disk!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

THIS MONTH'S WINNERS:

    Carl Laurence Gonsalves - randomly drawn from 13 correct entries,
    guessing the number 139236 from the drawn number of 147601.

    and goodwinm@mail.cs.orst.edu - randomly drawn from 50 correct and
    incorrect entries in our second chance drawing, guessing the number
    214387 from the drawn number of 212164.

    Both will be able to choose as a prize either the Future Shock II
    audio CD-ROM from SIDEWINDER, or the Amiga Online Reference Manual
    from Area52. The ARexx Reference Disk by Merrill Callaway was
    awarded to last month's winner.


THE PUZZLE:

Since people complained that the first contest was too hard, and
that the second was too easy, I made one that anyone can solve with
a little thought. Once you get some of it decoded you will be able
to solve it with ease ::heh heh::!

Decrypt the following encoded message: 17851 47932

Each location in the code represents one character in the
ASCII character set from A to Z. Also provide your method of
obtaining the answer.


THE WRONG ANSWERS:

No one submitted an incorrect answer, of all entries submitted. One entry
suggested that RAW keycodes were used in the puzzle. This is incorrect,
however he did guess the correct answer.

Francesco "Syylk" Munda writes in his correct entry: "Okey, that was easy,
after all. On "Amiga Report" isn't likely to appear "MSDOS GREAT"... :)"


THE WRONG WAY TO ENTER:

from LILLIQUISTJ@delphi.com:

    "Well,  I couldn't get Delphi to post to you but MAYBE now it'll work.
    Anyhow,  I already publically posted the answer to your puzzle. Sorry!
    I had it nicely type out too."

    Well, that's okay! Just try not to do it again! :)


THE WINNING ANSWER:

The prize winner is Carl Laurence Gonsalves, drawn from the winning
answers.

And here is Carl's correct entry, drawn randomly from all correct entries:

>The puzzle was to decrypt: 17851 47932
>
>The answer is: AMIGA RULES
>
>To solve the puzzle I looked at the numbers carefully. You said that "Each
>location in the code represents one character ... from A to Z". I figured
>this meant each digit represented a letter, and the space was a break
>between the words. The first 5 letter word I thought of that had the same
>first and last letters was Amiga, so I wrote down a table like:
>
>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
>  A       G   M I
>
>Then I thought, "Okay, where the heck is he getting the numbers from?"
>Looking up at my keyboard I noticed that the letters A-G-M-I had the

>  A W E R G   M I L
>        S D F     U   O

>
>I then wrote down the second word like:
>
>47932
>RMLEV
>FUODS
>VJ CX
>
>And looking across this the only sensible word I could see was "RULES".

Katie Nelson's correct entry, which was not selected as the winning entry
from the 13 correct entries, adds: "PS-- I like the message."

Arnoud W. Morsink's correct entry, which was not selected as the winning
entry from the 13 correct entries, (but wrong method!) identifies a hint
found in another issue of Amiga Report: "Like you said, it wasn't hard
- i.e., after I read the clue in "Programming Hash Tables":

  ("... this word (which I chose as an example for no particular reason).")
:)"

THE BREAKDOWN:

- Since people complained that the first contest was too hard, and
that the second was too easy, I made one that anyone can solve with
a little thought. Once you get some of it decoded you will be able
to solve it with ease ::heh heh::!

    The fastest way to solve this is to note that the first number, 17851,
    begins and ends with a "1", just like the word "AMIGA". As I stated
    in the puzzle, once you got some of it decoded, the rest should be
    easy.

- Decrypt the following encoded message: 17851 47932

    There are two words, and notice that only 10 digits are used. In this
    code, one digit can represent between 3 and 6 characters.

- Each location in the code represents one character in the
ASCII character set from A to Z. Also provide your method of
obtaining the answer.

    Originally I was going to number my fingers from 0 to 9, and then
    touch type a message. Then I decided instead to use the numbers
    based upon the alignment with the characters on the QWERTY keyboard.
    Since people do have different keyboards, future puzzles will not
    rely on the keyboard anymore! ::whew!::


THE DISCLAIMER:

DISCLAIMER: This contest is being provided as a service to the
Amiga community and all persons involved in running this contest
cannot be held liable for anything that costs you money or
lifetime pain and anguish. Rules are subject to change. All entries
must be received by April 30th, 1994. Any entries beyond this date
will be entered into the next contest, if any.


THE APOLOGY:

I learned from the last contest not to use the keyboard, since it may
be different in some countries than the QWERTY keyboard that I use.
I promise not to do it again (I guess the MATRIX puzzle next month
will be the exception ::hint::).


As Edward Cayce might say, that is all for the present...

%%  C.S.A. Review: ARexx Guide 2.0a           By:  Thomas Voirol         %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

PRODUCT NAME

	ARexxGuide 2.0a


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

	ARexxGuide is an extensive hypertext document in AmigaGuide format
on the ARexx programming language.

	Do not confuse it with the South West Amiga Group's similarly named
"Introduction To ARexx".  This is an entirely different beast.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

	Name:		Robin Evans
	Address:	1020 Seneca #405
			Seattle, WA  98101-2720
			USA

	E-mail:		robin@halcyon.com       on Internet
			R.EVANS6                on GEnie
			r.evans6@genie.geis.com on Internet

	Availability:	ARexxGuide can be obtained from many local BBSs and
			the Aminet ftp sites (util/rexx directory).


LIST PRICE

	ARexxGuide is shareware. This means it is freely distributable, but
if you find it useful, the author asks you to register.  The shareware fee
is $15 (US).

	Registration can be done from within ARexxGuide.  A script asks you
a few questions about your configuration and then assembles a text file
which you can print out and mail in with the fee.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

	HARDWARE

		Each ARexxGuide file is smaller than 75KB, so no extra RAM
		should be necessary.

		A hard disk or a high density disk drive is recommended,
		since a complete installation requires about 1 MB of disk
		space.

	SOFTWARE

		AmigaOS 2.04 or later is required.

		It might work with AmigaDOS 1.3, however, if you have ARexx
		and AmigaGuide or an equivalent of the latter like Hyper.


COPY PROTECTION

	None.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

	Amiga 3000T, 2MB Chip RAM, 16MB Fast RAM
	Kickstart 40.68, Workbench 40.42
	Multiview 40.8
	Picasso II Graphics Board


INSTALLATION

	Installation is a simple copy operation which can be done from
Workbench.  No Assigns or Path additions are necessary.  If you invoke
ARexxGuide from ToolManager or the likes, you should set the current
directory to the one where ARexxGuide resides.


REVIEW

	ARexxGuide starts with a nicely detailed, clearly arranged, main
panel.  From here you jump directly to the relevant chapters.  Several entry
points are given; that is, if you want to find a particular piece of
information, there are usually several different "paths" that will lead you
to it.

	If you are an ARexx beginner, you can browse through the Guide
starting with the Introduction.  The document turns out to be a complete
course in ARexx, at the end of which you will be able to write programs.  No
prior knowledge of the language is necessary.  Even a small history of Rexx
is included.

	The seasoned ARexx programmer also will find ARexxGuide to be an
invaluable on-line reference.  The reference part of this documentation is
divided logically into the chapters "Basic Elements", "Instructions",
"Functions", "Operators", "Commands" and "Error Codes".

	ARexxGuide uses the hypertext capabilities of AmigaGuide
extensively.  This makes for a very lucid tree structure.  You practically
never have to read more than one or two pages of text, and almost every
technical term is cross-referenced through a hypertext link.  Finally,
ARexxGuide encompasses a very thorough index which is the fastest way to
look up the syntax and arguments of a command whose name you already know.

	All pages show the path by which they can be reached in the window's
drag bar.  On the bottom of each page, the Previous, Next and Contents links
are displayed.  All this makes navigating really easy.

	Distributed with the regular ARexxGuide is a requester version that,
according to the author, will display term definition references in a
requester window instead of jumping to the glossary.  The requester version
requires Nico Francois' reqtools.library and Rafael D'Halleweyn's
rexxreqtools.library. However, since that Guide works properly only with V34
of the AmigaGuide utility, I could not try it out.


DOCUMENTATION

	Since ARexxGuide IS documentation, there is not too much to say
about this part ;^).  Nevertheless, all the necessary meta-information (i.e.,
Distribution, Author, Registration and others) is there and easily
accessible.


LIKES

	I like and appreciate the enormous amount of work and care the
author has put into ARexxGuide. It is very thoroughly detailed and provides
almost all knowledge relevant to ARexx.  I have not been able to spot any
mistakes so far.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

	Dislikes I have to find yet.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

	The only product I know that is comparable to ARexxGuide is the
aforementioned "Introduction To ARexx" by the South West Amiga Group.  While
being a nice tutorial also, it lacks in the reference field and is not as
clearly structured.


BUGS

	None found. There obviously were some in the example scripts of the
2.0 release which have been fixed in 2.0a.


VENDOR SUPPORT

	Besides releasing the bug-fixed version 2.0a, the author has provided
a 50KB patch archive to upgrade an existing ARexxGuide 2.0 installation.
Users of slower modems will be thankful that they don't have to download a
whole new version.


WARRANTY

	None mentioned.


CONCLUSIONS

	I rate this product 10 stars out of 10. Honest. Robin Evans has
provided us with an indispensable on-line help for ARexx where Commodore
neglected to do so.

	The $15 shareware fee is fair compensation for the incredible amount
of time and dedication the author has put into this documentation.  I
encourage all ARexx programmers, seasoned or aspiring, to test this fine
product and by all means send the shareware fee to Mr. Evans.


REVIEW AUTHOR'S BACKGROUND

	I program in REXX for a living on IBM mainframe computers running
under MVS/ESA, and I use IBM's very comprehensive TSO/E REXX documentation
on a daily basis.

INSTALLATION


OVERVIEW

	Blitz Basic 2 ("BB2") comes on three compressed disks.  The first
contains BB2 itself and some programs that were published in Amiga Format
magazine as type-ins.  The others contain games, two of which were also in
Amiga Format.  In addition, some Blitz libraries are included, although
you're not told how to use them nor what they do.

	There are also several utility programs.  The first is a (bugged)
program that will convert a bitmap screen, approximately 320 by 200 pixels,
to either bobs or sprites.  The second allows you to set up screens and
graphics for map programs.  You are also supposed to be given a program that
allows you to set up windows icons and gadgets, although I haven't found it
anywhere.

	BB2 consists of two parts - the editor and the compiler, discussed
separately below.  The compiler is accessed from the editor using pull-down
menus.

THE EDITOR

	The BB2 editor is quite basic.  Consisting of no more than 30
commands, it is enough to get programs up and running.  If you don't like the
editor, you could always use your favourite word processor.

The commands available include:

	NEW				Clear program from memory
	LOAD & SAVE			Load tokenised programs only
	DEFAULTS			Modify tab settings, colours, etc.
	CUT, COPY, DELETE, FORGET	Modify blocks
	SEARCH & REPLACE		Find letters/words
	GOTO				Go to a line number

Most important commands include short-hand versions.

	If you select commands too quickly, the editor tends to muck up the
screen.  It won't redraw the screen until you select another option or
scroll the screen.


THE COMPILER

	This is where all your basic programs are turned into (very) fast
machine code, although, due to the fact that compiled code is slower than
pure assembly, programs do not run as fast as professional programs
(although they do come quite close).

	The compiler has two settings:  1-pass mode and 2-pass mode.
One-pass mode produces much slower code than 2 pass mode, as the code is not
efficient.  In addition, in 1 pass mode only, you can exit a program with
CTRL-C.  This is one of the many things that Acid manage to omit in their
manuals.

	The machine code itself is quite small.  The compiler manages to
convert around 200K tokenised text to 64K in 2-pass mode.


THE LANGUAGE

	The language itself is quite good.  You don't need line numbers any
more, and it supports procedures and functions, though procedures are called
"statements" for some reason.  AGA machines are supported with extra colours
and graphics.

	All necessary commands are there - commands for string handling,
mathematical calculations, displaying to screen, bitmaps, speech, samples
(you can play only 128K (6 seconds) worth for each sample), sprites,
windows, menus, bobs and structured programming commands (REPEAT/UNTIL,
WHILE/WEND).  For some reason, they've kept the ON GOSUB/GOTO commands as
well as LET.  I would have thought it was about time we got rid of both of
those.

	However, extra commands and improvements to the language are
available only to those people who subscribe to the BB2 magazine, which for
a very bugged program (see "The Bugs") is not good at all.  This is where
AMOS manages to excel (the only time it really can), as all of its updates
are in the public domain.

	Collision detection is a main problem.  Although fairly accurate, it
will tell you only if you've collided with something, and not which sprite
or bob you've collided with.  This means you've got to slow the program down
by searching for which things you've collided with, using a FOR/WHILE/REPEAT
loop.

	BB2 allows you to access all AmigaDOS ROM routines.  The language
handles bytes, words, long words and floating point numbers.

	The language has got a thing about using the currently activated
object.  Although a fairly good idea, I do feel it would be much easier for
programmers to just enter one extra parameter for where they would like
their objects to be placed.

	Sprites can only be removed from memory if they've been converted
from bobs (for some strange reason).


DOCUMENTATION

	BB2 comes with 2 manuals.  One is a reference guide for most of the
commands available, while the other contains the user guide for programming
and some extra commands that they've added (presumably after they made the
first book).

	Like the program, the manuals are full of errors and mistakes.  CLS
they say can be used in Amiga mode (multi-processing mode) or Blitz mode
(disables multi-processing - games mode).  Try as you might, CLS always
returns an error message when used in Amiga mode.

	One command (ReMap) they've managed to get in the index of the
reference manual but appears only in the user guide.

	The errors messages that they mention at the back of the reference
guide are all the ones that you probably WON'T get - all the important
messages are not mentioned at all, which is very bad.  One of the worst
messages you can get is "ERROR :" (Yes, that is the whole error message).
This normally appears if you try to use a palette before a slice has been
set up.

	At the end of the reference guide is a A500/A1000 keyboard layout of
all the RawStatus codes, which can be quite useful.  In addition, it also
gives a technical insight into how the Copper works, and how the language
handles all the technical aspects of the machine.  In addition, all NewTypes
(like the standard "C" structures) are given.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

	AMOS and HiSoft Basic are the only ones that you should look at
really.  HiSoft Basic is new, so I don't know what it's like.

	AMOS is good if you're new to programming; as unlike BB2, the
language does all the hard work for you.  However, with AMOS, you have to
buy a compiler as extra if you want faster programs.

	However, unlike AMOS, the amount of support given by BB2 is very
small.  As stated earlier, you have to subscribe to their magazine if you
want anything extra.  PD libraries currently stock only one BB2 program (and
you get the code for that with the main program anyway).  However, BB2 can
produce (with hard work and patience) software that is as good as, if not
much better than, software written with AMOS.  See Skid Marks for a
commercial game written in Blitz Basic.


BUGS

	This is the one part that BB2 excels at.

	Bugs in the program are everywhere - the program can crash when
you've loaded the program, when you've exited it, or when running it.  All of
these bugs mean that you have to reset the computer and reload the program
again.  When you load or exit the program, it gives a #80000003 code, and
when running a program, it just crashes.

	The worst cases are when you run the program.  Even though you carry
out the error reduction routine as mentioned in the user guide, the program
will always crash if:

	A)  You try and open a bitmap that is too big for memory.
	B)  You use some I/O command while in BLITZ mode.


CONCLUSIONS

	The program scores marks for having the compiler built into the
editor and for a very fast compiling and running speed.  However, on the
minus side, the program loses points for all the errors in the manuals, the
program crashes, all the error messages not mentioned, and the lousy screen
updates in the editor.

	Overall, BB2 is very good if you want fast arcade games and/or want
to access the Amiga's ROM.  However, you should be patient enough to save
your programs before every run, and to suffer continual re-loading of BB2.

PRODUCT NAME

	Microvitec 1438 Multisync monitor


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

	A 14" colour RGB multisync monitor compatible with all AGA screen
modes, available with or without stereo speakers.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

	Name:		Microvitec PLC
	Address:	Bolling Road
			Bradford
			West Yorkshire
			BD4 7TU
			UK

	Telephone:	(0) 274 390011
	FAX:		(0) 274 734944


	Name:		Microvitec (Deutschland) GmbH
	Address:	Heinrich Hertz Strasse 4
			4006 Erkrath
			Bei Dusseldord
			West Germany

	Telephone:	(211) 920010
	FAX:		(211) 9200115


LIST PRICE

	I paid 300 GBP for the 1438 monitor without speakers.  Some stores
now sell the same monitor WITH speakers for around the same price, so shop
around.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

	HARDWARE

		A 23-pin to 15-pin RGB adaptor is required, since the
		monitor comes with an RGB lead ending in a 15-pin VGA style
		D-plug.  Amiga 4000 owners should already have this adaptor.
 

	SOFTWARE
	
		None.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

	Standard Amiga 4000/030.
	Standard Commodore-supplied RGB adaptor.

	I have also hacked the C= monitor adaptor to fix the AGA banding
problem.  This hardware flaw in the AGA chipset causes noticeable vertical
stripes on screens using the higher bandwidth monitors like Multiscan and
DBLPAL.  The simple fix for this, as posted some time ago on
comp.sys.amiga.hardware by Steve Cutting (Steve_Cutting@guru.apana.org.au),
involves soldering a resistor into the monitor adaptor.  This fix worked
perfectly with my 4000 and 1438 monitor.


INSTALLATION

	The RGB adaptor must be connected to the Amiga's RGB port, then the
RGB lead from the monitor plugs into the adaptor.  The power lead from the
monitor ends in a standard 3-pin "kettle lead" PLUG, i.e., it can be fitted
directly into the main pass-through on the back of an Amiga 4000.  Otherwise
the supplied "kettle lead" must be used.


REVIEW

	The first thing I noticed when I took the monitor out of the box is
the case - it's pretty boring looking.  A bit like an ultra cheap VGA
monitor.  Just below the front of the monitor are the brightness, contrast,
size and centering controls (more about these later) and the all-important
on/off switch.  The monitor comes with its own tilt/swivel stand, but as I
mentioned above, mine came with no speakers.  A nice touch is the three-pin
"kettle lead" plug on the end of the power lead; this means that 4000 owners
can actually use that pass-through on the back of their machines instead of
having yards of black wiring running around behind their desks.

	Installation was no problem.  The strange shiny metal C= adaptor was
plugged in between the monitor and the Amiga, then both the monitor and the
Amiga were powered up using the switch on the front of my 4000 (because I'm
lazy :-)).

	The first thing I noticed when my Workbench screen came up was the
flicker -- I had the screen mode set to "PAL:Hires-Interlaced" previously,
and on the 1438 it flickered even more horribly than it used to on my old TV.
Also, any *non-interlaced* PAL or NTSC mode now flickers a bit more than it
used to.  I put this down to the fact that the 1438 specifications say it
has a low-persistence tube.  No kidding!  But that was just an initial
impression -- now I am used to the 50Hz flicker, and I don't even notice it
any more.  Besides, no one would use a PAL or NTSC screen any more when they
can use the much nicer DBLPAL mode!

	After one quick visit into the Prefs drawer, and I had my DBLPAL
Workbench all set up and ready to impress.  But wait - the top and bottom of
the Workbench had disappeared off the screen, and there were ugly black
borders about 3 cm wide on either side.  No problem, I thought, just adjust
the vertical size, no problem, and the horizontal size...  BUT!  There is NO
horizontal size control - a MAJOR flaw as far as the Amiga is concerned (I
have noticed the same borders when I tried a SVGA monitor on my machine).
In fact, there is no vertical position control either.  All you get is
brightness, contrast, vertical SIZE and horizontal POSITION.  Nothing else.

	But don't panic.  The default C= monitor drivers for DBLPAL and so
on may stretch and move the screen on your 1438, but all that is needed is a
little experimentation with MonEd and a (reasonably) full-screen display can
be achieved.  (MonEd is available on the Aminet ftp sites.)  I recommend
booting up some PAL or NTSC game and setting the monitor controls so that
the screen is centred fairly well on the monitor, and THEN fiddling about
with MonEd to arrange the DBLPAL, DBLNTSC, Multiscan, Super72, etc.,
monitors to give the best screen coverage.  This will ensure that you won't
have to keep adjusting the monitor controls every time you run a
hardware-hitting game or demo.

	Apart from that initial period of driver-hacking, I am very
satisfied with my monitor purchase.  The picture quality of the 1438 is as
good as any monitor I have ever seen, the pixels are sharp, and the colours
really jump out of the screen.  Mode-switching is also very fast.  For
example, I estimate it takes maybe a tenth of a second to switch between a
Super72 screen (great for JPEGs) and a DBLPAL screen.  In other words, the
monitor can re-sync about as fast as you can manually switch screens anyway.


DOCUMENTATION

	A small booklet containing six pages or so of documentation in
each of six languages.  There are the usual guidelines, precautions in
use, etc., and some basic installation instructions (plug the video lead
into the computer's video connector :-)).


LIKES

	I like the sharp and clear picture quality and the fast
mode-switching time.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

	I am disappointed that there is no horizontal size control.  Also,
the quality of the monitor case leaves something to be desired -- it's fairly
cheap and ugly.  I presume these two flaws exist because of efforts made to
reduce the cost of the monitor.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

	I haven't used any other multi-sync monitors for the Amiga.  In
terms of picture quality alone, it is as good as any PeeCee SVGA monitors I
have seen, if not better.


VENDOR SUPPORT

	I have had no reason to contact the vendor.


WARRANTY

	I am unsure of the warranty terms.  In the rush to get the monitor
up and running, the guarantee card went missing :-).  However, the user
manual states that UK users should return the monitor to the supplier (not
the manufacturer) if a fault appears.


CONCLUSIONS

	Overall, this is a very good monitor for the price.  I wanted the
cheapest multisync I could get for the Amiga, and this is it.  Just be ready
with your copy of MonEd, and you will be happy with the 1438.

	I'd give it 4 stars out of 5.  The last star was lost because of the
omission of the horizontal size control and the somewhat grotty appearance.

  The author (Al Fasoldt) is syndicated in *over 100 newspapers*, and is 
a long-time Atari ST fan. (You can tell from the spin he puts on the 
Amiga story, and his anxiousness to pronounce the Amiga dead.)  He avoids 
all the details and facts that imply that the European outlook is better 
than the US outlook, claims of continued production, and several 
potential buyers (with stories ranging from an outright takeover, to 
purchase of the Amiga chipset & OS for licensing to those wanting to make 
Amiga compatibles).
  
  This was AFTER a Rome-NY Amiga dealer corrected the columnist following 
Fasoldt's announcement (on a May 18th PBS talk-show) 'that it was all 
over'.  The author refused to listen to the dealer's facts, instead 
insisting that Commodore was a singularly AMERICAN company and that ALL 
of CBM had already closed it's doors, everywhere.  Also note what seems 
to be stale Atari fanaticism regarding Tramiel, Atari and the Amiga's 
lineage.   If you have access to one of the texts from RJ Mical, Jay

REQUIEM FOR A COMPUTER
Revolutionary Amiga has logged off for last time

 The Commodore company gave up the fight against IBM and Apple 
Macintoshes and closed, probably for good.

 The company had too many debts and too few assets. It had a lot of True 
Believers but not a lot of cash.

 AND SO THE Commodore Amiga Has passed away. It was a brilliant computer, 
more powerful than a PC or a Macintosh when it was introduced nine years 
ago. It displayed stunning color graphics when the best a PC could do was 
an ugly picture or two - and when the best a Mac could do was show a tiny 
black and white image on an absurdly small screen.

 COMMODORE KEPT improving the Amiga year after year. One of the biggest 
changes was a built in emulator that turned the Amiga into an IBM-
compatible PC at any time. Another was the addition of faster chips and 
greater memory.

 
    %% IBM compatibility was an option; not built in, and most of us %%
    %% prefered it that way.  Memory was never a problem either.     %%


 A separate company marketed a device that turned the Amiga into a 
television-picture editing machine at one-tenth the cost of previous 
equipment.

 
    %% A really crude way of short-selling NewTek's VideoToaster? %%  
    %% Or just the ramblings of a person who's never bothered to  %%
    %% find out what the Amiga/Toaster is really all about?       %%


 This brought video editing down to an affordable level for the first 
time and started a revolution, just now catching on among PCs and Macs, 
called desktop video.

 The legend of the Amiga is ripe with stories that sound too tall to be 
true but are factual nonetheless.  One of them is the story of how the 
Amiga came to be a Commodore computer in the first place.

      %% The following is The Word According to Atari Fanatics %%

 THE AMIGA WAS supposed to be an Atari. In the early '80s, a group of 
computer software and hardware designers, including some from the 
original team that created the first Atari models, came together to 
devise a new model that would put Atari on top of the home-computer 
market.


 %% It was an independent company called Hi-Toro.  Not an Atari      %%
 %% subsidiary.  Jay Miner who once worked for Atari was now working %%
 %% for Hi-Toro on their new computer the "Lorraine".  It was named  %%
 %% after the fiancee of one of the engineers.  Atari's role was     %%
 %% limited to it's  vulture-like intent to take over the struggling %%
 %% company, with an insultingly low stock buyout offer.             %%


 It was going to be powerful and friendly, and so the code name of 
"Amiga" - Spanish for "friend" - was chosen.


  %% Almost. Amiga = FEMALE friend, chosen to replace "Lorraine".  %%
  %% It came lexically before APPLE, unlike "Lorraine".            %%


 At that time, Atari was owned by Warner Communications. Atari's rival, 
Commodore, was owned by Jack Tramiel and his sons. In a hectic month, 
Tramiel had a falling out with Commodore's board of directors and left 
the company, pausing only briefly before buying the Atari company from 
Warner.


  %% Reality check: CBM insiders claim Tramiel's intent to buy Atari  %%
  %% was known to him LONG before CBM had any suspicions.  They claim %%
  %% Tramiel intentionally set CBM up to fail, as he was moving to    %%
  %% take over CBM's competitor (Atari).  His seemingly insane        %%
  %% actions before he left CBM now make sense.  CBM never fully      %%
  %%  recovered from his 'bad business decisions'.                    %%
 

 To get back at Tramiel, Commodore raided the Amiga team and hired all of 
them. Overnight, the Amiga switched stables, and the prize that Tramiel 
had set his heart on- an Atari with a dazzling new model-turned out to be 
a company in distress.


  %% Falcon fantasy.  Hi-Toro (now renamed Amiga) accepted CBM's %%
  %% offer because Atari's was a joke.  Companies don't          %%
  %% "get back at" former execs.  They seek profit.  Later,      %%
  %% Tramiel claimed his ST was better than the Amiga.           %%


 NO DOUBT the Amiga as a Commodore fared better than it would have as an 
Atari, but an irony was playing itself out on the week that Commodore 
handed its affairs over to a liquidator.


    %% Funny, European divisions are said to be in normal operation. %%


 Atari, still in the computer business, announced a new deal that would 
put its graphics circuits in IBM-compatible PCs and saw its stock soar on 
Wall Street.

 
 %%Is this like "Atari & IBM entered a joint venture to make the       %% 
 %%Jaguar" when Atari actually PAID IBM to manufacture it's Jaguar?    %%
 %%I suppose anything from .25 would be a soaring improvement.  "Still %%
 %%in the computer business"?  When was the last time you saw an Atari %%
 %%TT or Falcon anywhere?  Atari survives by sales of stand-up arcade  %%
 %%units.  Jaguar is it's last shot at consumer electronics.           %%


 To some, it looked like Jack Tramiel's revenge. But to fans of the 
Amiga, it was just a somber epitaph for a computer that lived a good 
life.

 Rest in peace, Amiga.


   %% Mr. Fasoldt seems all too eager to perform an autopsy while  %%
   %% the patient is still warm.  Not surprising considering the   %%
   %% disproportionate coverage he's given to the Atari in         %%
   %% contrast to the Amiga, IBM and Mac.                          %%

 -------End of annotated article----------------------------------------

 Due to some disreputable reporting, the Amiga's condition has been 
battered.  Amigans are used to this arrogance, but now, at this critical 
time, it is very vulnerable.  We need to address every non-truth, lie, 
slam, and premature declaration of death.  Many less-than-savy Amigans 
are already thinking about moving to another system.  These are the 
people who are most easily mis-lead by "industry pundits" who are all too 
happy to bury the Amiga while it's heart still beats.

  It's up to us to do damage control, since CBM sure isn't going to do 
it.  Public perception and reactions will have an effect on the 
willingness of companies to take over and continue the Amiga family.

 While you're still fresh from reading his article, use your Amiga 
multitasking to write a letter, right now!  Or call.  Considering Mr. 
Fasoldt's disposition, it makes more sense to contact his editor first:

 The Syracuse Herald American/Stars Magazine welcomes comments and calls 
on this issue.  Jim Howe, Editor of Stars Magazine, has a willingness to 
listen to Amiga users' complaints, perhaps to even PRINT them.  His 
office is reachable at:

 The Syracuse Herald American/Stars is owned by Newhouse News Service, who 
syndicates selected columns (Al Fasoldt's is one).  Mr. Beaubette is the 
executive editor. Newhouse's address is:

 If you happen to be one of the people who actually worked on the Amiga,
(or know one of them) please contact Mr. Fasoldt and his _Editor_ @ the
above E-Mail address and phone numbers.  The designers of the Amiga
hardware and system software are in a better position than anybody
to straighten Mr. Fasoldt out.  Note that it's probably just as important
to contact his editor.

NEW YORK STATE AMIGA USERS
The Syracuse area Amiga dealer, Industrial Color Labs, has about a
quarter million dollars of Amiga products in stock.  Since Mr. Fasoldt's
premature claims, they've had a difficult time selling their wares.
You can contact the PBS affiliate which broadcast the interview
with Al Fasoldt.  The "Good Afternoon" show is hosted by Art Levy, who
seems almost smitten by Mr. Fasoldt.  It's better to complain to Jack
Neal, the Executive Producer for WCNY at: 1-800-451-9269
Good Afternoon Call-in: 1-800-451-2414
Other: 1-800-453-2424
If you're ouside their 800 coverage, replace "800" with 315.

thought it was important.  Here is the text from the message Harv Laser

From: Harv@cup.portal.com (Harv R Laser)
Subject: Jay Miner, R.I.P.
Date: Sun, 26 Jun 94 20:16:26 PDT
Organization: The Portal System (TM)

The man known to all as The Father of the Amiga is gone. I just pulled
this posting off his own BBS, "The Mission", posted there today by
his co-sysop.

Those of you who knew Jay or had met him at the many Amiga shows
he attended, please join me in your own private way and remember
this wonderful guy who gave us all so very much.

[Subject ] Jay Miner

Jay Miner passed away June 20, 1994, at the El Camino Hospital in Mountain
View.  The actual cause of death was heart failure, but it was the result of
kidney complications.  A private memorial service will be held in July.

He'll be greatly missed and much remembered.

                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

  Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

  The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software, online.

  Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

  Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES.

  35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

  No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

  Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

  Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

  Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

  FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
  Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  

  Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

  The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
  Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
  All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

  Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

  And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

   408-973-8091 (modem 9600/14400) 24 hours every day

   or enter "C PORTAL" from any Sprintnet dial-in in the USA,
   or telnet to "portal.com" from anywhere.

* plus cost of phone call if out of Portal's local dialing area
  Direct rates also apply to connections made to Portal using the
  UNIX "telnet" program from an account you may already
  have on an Internet-connected system. 
% 9600 bps Sprintnet in over 300 cities areas
+ $10 rate prevails at smaller US Cities
# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

/// BIX - Byte Information Exchange             Lots of information!
    -------------------------------



BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and enthusiasts.
While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is the place for 
knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  You're likely 
to find many others in similar situations who can offer advice, give 
technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.


                       *** FULL INTERNET ACCESS! ***

BIX features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription. 


                      ==============================
                      Rates and Connect Information:
                      ==============================


BIX membership costs $13 per month, plus connect time.  There are several 
different ways to connect:

SprintNet*              $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet:**               $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
(SprintNet and Tyment rates shown are for 48 contiguous US states only.)
                                                        
Tymnet Canada:          $4/hr eves/wkends           $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet Hawaii:          $10/hr eves/wkends          $20/hour weekdays   
Telnet(via Internet):   $1/hour, round the clock
Direct dial (Boston):   $2/hour, round the clock (up to 9600 bps)
 
 * SprintNet daytime hours are from 6am to 7pm, M-F, ET.
** Tymnet daytime hours are from 7am to 6pm, M-F, ET.

                20/20 PLAN OPTION (for USA-48 users only):

Volume users can choose the 20/20 Advantage Plan, which is $20 per month
and includes the first 20 hours of access by any combination of methods 
from the contiguous United States.  Additional use is $1.80 per hour 
(additional use for telnet access is $1 an hour).  The 20/20 Plan's cost is 
in addition to the $13 monthly fee.  


                           INTERNATIONAL USERS:

If you wish to connect internationally through Tymnet or SprintNet, 
please contact your local PTT.  BIX accepts prepaid international calls,
direct dial, or telnet connections.  In order to make a "collect" (not 
prepaid) call to BIX, your account must be verified before the charges 
are accepted.  When you complete the registration, we'll mail you a BIX
Membership Agreement by regular US Mail.  Whe you receive it, sign it 
and return it to us by mail.  When we receive it here, we'll authorize
your account to make reverse charged calls.

If you want to access BIX right away, contact your local PTT to set up a 
prepaid account.  You'll pay your local carrier for your calls to BIX in
advance, so there's no waiting period or verfication needed. Or, connect 
at BIX via telnet to x25.bix.com.

SprintNet international calls from most locations are $24 an hour.
Tymnet international charges vary, but are generally between $20-$30 an hour.


                           ====================

TITLE

    HWGRCS

VERSION

    HWGRCS 5.6.0.1 at Amiga Patch Level _9_

AUTHOR

    Ported, enhanced, and maintained by

    FAX +49 89 850 51 25, I prefer email.


DESCRIPTION

    HWGRCS is a port of GNU RCS 5.6.0.1 done with SAS/C 6.51.

    The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions
    of  files.   RCS  automates the storing, retrieval, logging,
    identification, and merging of revisions.  RCS is useful for
    text that is revised frequently, for example programs, docu-
    mentation, graphics, papers, and form letters.

    For upgraders from the old RCS 4.x on Fish 281/282:

        - HWGRCS supports the RCS_link feature
        - No problems with non-ASCII characters

    Special features:

        - File pattern and response file expansion in all RCS commands.
        - Support for .a,.ag,.asm,.fd,.guide,.i,.mod,.ps extensions.
        - GNU DIFF 2.6, GNU patch 2.1 and a N*rton like LP utility.
        - AmigaGuide. docs.
        - I try to _support_ HWGRCS (See the docs).


NEW FEATURES

    New since patch level 8:

    - .mod extension recognized.
    - LP better documented.
    - 'D' protection bit is handled better.

    Bugs fixed since patch level 8:

    - rcsfreeze works with empty paths in RCS_link correctly.
    - No dummy entries left behind in the task list anymore.
    - $AmigaProtection$ changes should work right on ci now.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    >=V37, >1MB suggested, HD required.


HOST NAME

    Any Aminet site, e.g. ftp.uni-paderborn.de   (131.234.2.32) for users

          If you don't use patch 8 yet, you'll need the following archives
          in addition to the one above to set up patch 9.

    HWGRCSp8f.lha       Binaries and full AmigaGuide. docs
    HWGRCSsrcp8f.lha    The sources
    HWGRCSmanp7f.lha    The ASCII unix man pages for RCS (Note: _7_!)

PRICE

    I don't declare it shareware as it is Gnu SW, but donations/gifts for
    my support are quite welcome! Donations in physical form preferred.
    Support ~ Gifts, especially for commercial users.


DISTRIBUTABILITY

@toc "menu"

TITLE

     SpiroDraw06 - Spirograph(tm?) simulator of the spiral-drawing toy.
                   Simple, fun and addictive!

VERSION

     This is version 06.  Lengthened slider gadgets in the "Set Data"
     window in HI-RES mode to be easier to "grab" with the mouse.

COMPANY

     No company, just an AMINET upload by "yours truly".

AUTHOR

     SpiroDraw06 was written by me, Chuck Kenney.  My particulars
     (address, etc.) are included in the user document in the archive.

DESCRIPTION

     SpiroDraw06 simulates the Wheels-and-Rings-and-Pens spirograph
     drawing toy.  Allows the user to specify different sizes for
     the "Drawing Wheels, Drawing Rings", etc.  The use of a computer
     to generate the SpiroDraw designs actually enhances some of the
     capabilities!  SpiroDraw06 is mouse-driven (MENUs, GADGETs, etc.)
     and provides an easy way to create one's own 'eye-candy'.  It is
     fun _and_ addictive!  SpiroDraw06.lha also contains a very nice
     freely distributable "screen-to-IFF" saver utility written by
     Preben Nielsen (thanks, Preben) so that SpiroDraw designs can be
     imported into "paint" programs.  SpiroDraw06 is shareware but does
     not nag the user in any way and all features are fully functional.

NEW FEATURES

     Lengthened slider gadgets in the "Set Data" window
     in HI-RES mode to be easier to "grab" with the mouse.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     There are no special requirements that I know of.
     SpiroDraw06 has been tested on an Amiga 2000HD (OS 2.1)
     and an Amiga 1000 (OS 1.3).

HOST NAME

     SpiroDraw06.lha has just been uploaded to the AMINET site,
     ftp.etsu.edu (192.43.199.20) and should soon be available on
     all other AMINET sites.

DIRECTORY

     SpiroDraw06.lha and SpiroDraw06.readme reside in the
     "aminet/gfx/misc" directory. 

FILE NAMES

     SpiroDraw06.lha is 58,003 bytes long.

PRICE

     The asking shareware price is the amount sent to me by my first
     shareware contributor (Thanks go to Bill from Glendale, AZ!).
     This requested shareware fee is $5.00 (US).  

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     This program is freely distributable but is a copyrighted (1994)
     shareware program by me, Chuck Kenney.

OTHER

     "SpiroDraw06" is the final release under the name, "SpiroDraw**".
     In the future "SpiroDraw" functionality will be integrated into
     a new forthcoming program, "EyeCandy01" which is currently being
     developed.  "EyeCandy01" will have the capability of drawing
     various other designs (as the name implies) in addition to the
     "SpiroDraw06" designs.  Any future changes/enhancements to any
     "SpiroDraw" features will be implemented in the "SpiroDraw" part
     of "EyeCandy**" only.

     SpiroDraw06, and other programs in progress are coming out of my
     basement as a result of the availability of a truly wonderful
     "BASIC-but-much-more!" compiler, "ACE" by David Benn.  I would
     like to sincerely thank Mr. Benn for renewing my enthusiasm in
     programming and for making it possible for me to make my programs
     available to more than just my friends and immediately family!

TITLE

	AM - Account Manager for muFS

VERSION

	1.0  (first public release)

AUTHOR

	Ingolf Koch
	ingolf@mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de

DESCRIPTION

	Are you running muFS, the Multi User File System for the Commodore
Amiga?  Then you surely have thought of a program providing an easy way to
maintain the users and groups in your system.

	Of course such a program should have a graphical user interface
which allows doing all necessary operations by a few mouse klicks or key
strokes.  Additionally, it should be localized i.e. speaking to you in your
preferred language.

	Then `AM' is the program you want.  It was written to support the
system operator's work by supplying an easy-to-use user interface based on
MUI.

FEATURES

	* localized (currently English, German, Netherlands, Norwegian,
	  Portuguese, and Swedish catalogs)

	* needs and makes extensive use of MUI 2.0 (`muimaster.library'
	  version 7+)

	* supports the following operations on the muFS system files

		- create new users/groups

		- edit any characteristics of an existing user/group

		- delete users/groups

		- temporarily ban a user from the system

	* automatically creates new $HOME directories and installs default
	  files there by executing a user supplied script

	* checks $HOME directories (not functional yet)

	* searches muFS partitions for files with bad owner information and
	  changes them


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	AmigaDOS 2.04 or higher.
	muFS (MultiUser FileSystem) by Geert Uytterhoeven
		(aminet: /pub/aminet/disk/misc)
	MUI 2.0 or higher (Magic User Interface) by Stefan Stuntz
		(aminet: /pub/aminet/dev/gui)
	68020+ useful (but not required)

     author(s) didn't give it a version number).

DESCRIPTION

     awk is a pattern-directed scanning and processing language
     described in A.V. Aho et al., "The AWK Programming Language",
     Addison-Wesley, 1988.

     It makes it possible to handle tasks like changing the format of
     data, printing reports, finding items with some property, and
     adding up numbers with very short programs, often only one or two
     lines long.  An awk program is a sequence of patterns and actions
     that tell what to look for in the input data and what to do when
     it is found. The patterns can select lines with regular
     expressions, comparison operations on fields, variables, strings,
     etc. or a combination thereof. The actions, which look a lot like
     C without declarations, may perform arbitrary processing on the
     selected data.

     Programs written in awk are generally much smaller than they
     would be in a conventional imperative programming language like
     C. Being terse makes awk quite useful for prototyping larger
     programs, too.

     This is a fully functional version of awk as described in the
     aforementioned book. This means that everything works, including
     "internal" pipes. In addition, AmigaDOS patterns can be used on
     the command line. Compiled with SAS/C 6.51.
     
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     The program runs under all versions of AmigaDOS. If you run
     AmigaDOS 1.x and have arp.library installed, it will be used for
     expanding patterns on the commandline. It is not a requirement,
     though. Under 2.x or 3.x, dos.library handles the expansion.

DESCRIPTION

  This list will be used as a forum for Amiga information in the Minnesota 
  area. It is run much like a newspaper or periodical, but less formal.

  Expect to find Commodore information, Minnesota users group information, 
  snippets of humor, and much, much more!

  Traffic ranges from zero to about a hundred kilobytes, but usually about
  twenty kilobytes.  Content is ASCII-text.

  This list is hand-compiled and edited using a text editor, mailer, and a 
  host of hand-written *NIX shell scripts.  The host system, a Sun 
  workstation is accessed the via a 14,400 baud connection by a VT220 
  emulation running on an Amiga 500.

AUTHOR

  This list is moderated by Jesse Mullan, who quotes articles found in the
  Comp.sys.Amiga.* groups, as well as forwarding articles sent to him by
  list-members and others in the Amiga community.
    
WHY

  AmigaNews Mn was created by Jesse Mullan to fill the gap in Amiga news 
  reporting and discussion in Minnesota.  AmigaNews Mn provides a simple 
  way to disseminate information to interested parties, many of whom 
  either do not have access to Usenet newsgroups or do not wish to 
  submerge themselves in the backwash of rumors and flames to find news.

CHANGES

  Due to popular confusion, AmigaNews Mn no longer goes by the name:
  "Amiga Gourp."

NOTES

  Back issues are available upon request.

LEGALITY

  The editor of AmigaNews Mn attempts to follow all applicable laws.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

  AmigaNews Mn is freely re-distributable, as long as credit remains 
  with the original authors.

     Fractint

VERSION

     2.1

COMPANY

     Stone Soup Group is responsible for the pc version of this program.

AUTHOR

    Terje Pedersen (terjepe@stud.cs.uit.no) is doing the amiga port of
    fractint.

DESCRIPTION

     Fractint is a fractal generation program which has been rather
     popular on the PC's for a long time. Now all amiga owners may
     enjoy it too! The Rolls Royce of fractal programs! It has an
     amazing number of different fractal types and even more fractals
     can be generated by a huge amount of script files. It can generate
     3d images as well as 2d images. Mapping fractals on spheres and
     generating images for viewing with 3d glasses is also possible.
     In addition to an amazing number of other things!

NEW FEATURES

V2.2:
  Added sound.

  The stereo 3d option was missing from '3d view options'.

V2.1:
  Some options was missing from several requesters.  fixed.  The
  interface generation is improved somewhat.  Now the input boxes is
  all of the same size!

  Now using reqtools screenmode requester.

  The cycle colors buttons is replaced by Load and Save palette.

  Amigaguide now pops up if you press the Help buttons or press
  help-key when the fractint screen is active.

  Some fractals runs 30-40% faster!

  I removed the FASTMEM flag so it will work on a computer with no
  fastmem.
  
  When color cycling (shift,alt,ctrl)-F1-F10 was supposed to give
  some nice color ranges.  Now it does!  (at least on AGA..)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
          
     Any amiga with WB2.04.

DESCRIPTION

  D.A.S Module Player is a player specifically designed for high end users.
  Special attention has been given to efficient handling of modules
  in lists. Modules can be sorted and handled with such attributes as
  name(+revese), date(+reverse), style and author. For better
  handling modules can also be divided to two groups within every
  list and can also be played according to those groups.
  Adding modules to list is easy since DASMP can take care of modules 
  already eisting in list and modules newer than current list.

  Modules can be extracted from virtually any external archives such
  as LHA and ZIP. XPK and PowerPacker packed modules can also be used.

  Since DASMP requires MUI, the Graphical User Interfce of the player
  is totally under user control. 
  User control over other features of DASMP can be squeezed to three words:
  6 configuration pages. Module specific configurations include things
  like module duration, author, style and date.

  Inoverall DASMP is very complex system giving user a possibility to
  use features he needs and forget the rest.

  What DASMP is not: 
  DASMP is not small and is not ment to be a replacement for those cute 
  little players floating around nets. DASMP is ot ment to be used on
  non accelerated a500 or a2000.

NEW FEATURES

  S3M modules supported. This EPL is fixed A LOT since last release
  and now works. ScreamTracker III modules support 16 digital channels.
  D.A.S.MP can play these modules in multitasing. Quality is selectable
  by user, the higher quality the higher CPU usage.

  FT modules. FastTracker 6 and 8 channel modules. Quality selectable.

  Full FAST ram player for ProTracker modules. Only 128 kb CHIP needed.

  Main program has severalenhancements including RE-DESIGNED MAIN
  WINDOW.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS


  KS 2.04, WB 2.1, Magic User Interface 2.0 (MUI).
  MUI20USR.LHA is available on aminet. Older versions of MUI aren't 
  sufficient.

@toc "menu"

TITLE

     Peti's Amiga ListSERV

VERSION

     Version 3.0

AUTHOR

     Written by Peter Simons <simons@peti.GUN.de>.

DESCRIPTION

         ListSERV is a software package to handle and maintain mailing
     lists, based on the well-known UNIX LISTSERV tool. With this
     daemon, users can easily subscribe or unsubscribe mailing lists,
     requests the frequently asked questions (FAQ) or index all mailing
     lists available on the machine.

         The archive contains all programs required to set a mailing
     list up plus a brief description in AmigaGuide and TexInfo style.
     Full source and RCS files are provided, too.

FEATURES

     - ListSERV's important parts are written in ARexx and thus can be
       modified to fit your special requirements.

     - ListSERV may add a signature to any article posted to the list.
       Each mailing list may have its own signature, so you can state
       vital information there.

     - ListSERV automatically sets the "Reply-To:" entry in the mail
       header to the list's address. Therefore, replies to articles
       delivered via the list will be sent back to the list again. Users
       can simply reply.

     - ListSERV supports totally secret and encrypted mailing lists,
       using the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) package. You can set up
       confidential mailing lists that can be used for development of
       commercial soft-/hardware.

     - ListSERV supports FAQs.

     - ListSERV allows you to archive all traffic of a mailing list.

     - and more...

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Kickstart 2.04 or later is required. Futhermore, an working UUCP
     or TCP setup might be useful. :-)

DISTRIBUTABILITY

        ListSERV is shareware. However, you may distribute the ListSERV
     archive as you want but you MUST NOT charge ANY money for the
     distribution. Inclusion in CD ROMs or similar collections require
     my explicit permission.

%% The Emulation Rambler                              By: @{" Jason Compton " link P8-2} %%
%% A quick Make-It 486 bit...                      jcompton@bbs.xnet.com  %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I told you I'd run a review on the Make-It 486 upgrade chip in the C= 286
bridgeboard.  I've done so.

I couldn't get it to work.

First off, I don't suggest you even TRY unless you're good at handling
boards.  Having already successfully taken apart the 2286 board is another
big plus, because it's not easy.

Why not?  It's got a nasty daughterboard which is held on the main board
by three sets of connectors.  Tight connectors for a close board.

The Make-It 486 resides on a small circuit board.  The processor socket to
receive it is under the daughterboard.  Begin to see the problem?

It's damn hard to get that 286 chip out, even with the included puller
tool.  Once you do, putting in the 486 board is easy, if you get the
direction right.  But putting the daughter back on...it just doesn't fit,
not without bending the board to the point that I was afraid it might
crack.  So I tried to get it settled as well as I could and power up.

The computer reported that janus.library couldn't be opened.  The
BB wasn't being recognized properly.

I'll watch for success stories, but for now, the Make-It 486 seems like a
nice idea, but not implementable for us.  (Someone on c.s.a.emulations
suggested ribbon-cabling the daughterboard and putting it somewhere else.
Neat idea, but it may not work.)

Our host machine is a 386/33 with 20MB of memory, 1GB harddisk and
a CD-ROM drive running in a Novell network. The BBS software is a
Norwegian origin MBBS running in a DesqView windows.

We have now (26th March 1994) over 10000 files online (mostly for
the Commodore Amiga line of the personal computers.)

Every user has an access to download filelist (LAHOFIL.ZIP), list of the
Finnish 24-hour BBS's (BBSLIST.ZIP or BBSLIST.LHA) and every issue of
the Amiga Report Magazine (AR101.LHA-AR???.LHA) even on their first call.

The system has been running since 1989 and is sponsored by the local
telephone company, Vaasan Lnin Puhelin Oy.

BTW, LAHO stands for "LAtomeren Hyrylaiva Oy" = "Barnsea Steamship Co."

Welcome on board!
