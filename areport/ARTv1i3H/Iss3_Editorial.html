    <p><big>N</big>ever depend on computers. This issue is late for a combination
      of reasons, mostly because of a HD crash that forced me to start
      over with an already tight schedule. Never depend on your site
      adminstration's backup schedules either, do your backups
      independently. Failures always happen at the worst possible
      moment.</p>

    <p>To make up for the long delay, in this issue we a have a lot of
      interesting stuff. An article revealing some of the secrets
      behind the often-heard-of but little known development tools <a
	href="FlexBison.html">flex and bison</a> (or lex and yacc), a <a
	href="C.html">new column about C programming</a>, the first part
      of an <a href="AmigaE_1.html">AmigaE course</a>, an <a
	href="ARexx_1.html">ARexx tutorial</a>, and more <a
	href="Installer_3.html">Installer tips</a> and <a
	href="BOOPSI_2.html">BOOPSI magic</a>.</p>

    <p>While Amiga Technologies still keeps us waiting for anything
      tangible, be it in the way of hardware or even concrete
      information about the future, the independent developer scene is
      still going strong. Every once in a while I'm about to lose the
      hope of Amiga surviving, but usually it doesn't take more than a
      quick look on Aminet to see that the platform is very much
      alive. A big thanks and good luck to all the people who are
      keeping it that way. Many exciting new programs have appeared
      since the last issue, some of them mentioned in the <a
	href="Pointers.html">pointers</a> section. I'm sorry I can't
      list them all, but that alone would be almost a full-time job ;)
    </p>
