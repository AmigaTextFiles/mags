    <h2>What version of the Installer are you using?</h2>

    <p>This time I am taking a bit of a break from doing the Play16
      installer example.  I wanted to talk abit about the different
      versions of the Installer.  As I mentioned in my second
      article, two different divisions of Commodore contracted out to
      Sylvan Technical Arts for the installer.  CATS contracted then
      to do an installer for Kickstart 1.3 and 2.0, while the contract
      by Engineering was for 2.0 only.
    </p>

    <p>As a result, there are quite a few different versions of the
      Installer out 
      there. The problem is that they all do not support the same
      commands. Though 95% of all the Installer scripts you run across will
      work with just about any version of the Installer binary, it
      seems that a few of the more complex and bigger PD packages take
      full advantage of all that it has to 
      offer.  This includes using some of the commands that are not
      supported by some of the different versions of the Installer.
    </p>

    <p>The new X-Windows package for the Amiga, AmiWin, uses the
      commodore Installer.  He uses the BITAND command and this seems
      not to be supported in many version of the
      installer. (AmiWin20d.lha on Aminet in gfx/x11) The CyberGraphX
      installer uses the 'newname' option for a 'copyfiles', this also
      seems to have problems on some installers.
    </p>

    <h2>Versions</h2>

    <p>Here is a list of Installer versions that I have collected over
      time. If you have a version that I am missing, if you could
      please uuencode it and email it to me at installer@vgr.com that
      would be great!  To check to see what verison of the installer
      you are running get into a cli/shell and type: 'version
      installer full' . If you installer is Imploded with Imploder
      then you will not be able to get a version string from the
      cli/shell. You will need to run the installer with a script and
      select the 'About' button.
    </p>

    <p>Imploder is a program that 'packs' or compress executables and
      still leaves them in a runable format.  The big advantage is
      that it saves room. When you put together a distribution disk
      and you are running out of room many people use Imploder to
      implode the installer binary and cut the size in about
      half. Imploder can be found on Aminet as: imploder-4.0.lzh in
      the util/pack directory.  Even Commodore sent disks out with the
      installer binary Imploded.</p>

    <p>The imploded sizes in the following table are after using
      Imploder 4.0 with the default settings.
    </p>

<pre> 
  Version String                Size     Imploded
  installer 1.24   ( 1-09-92)   115144   62684
  installer_2 2.9  (23-03-92)   111504   60056
  installer_2 2.12 (15-05-92)   113224   60936
  installer_2 2.15 ( 3-08-92)   113740   61300
  installer_2 2.17 (13-02-93)   113532   61236
</pre>

    <h2>What Version to use?</h2> 

    <p> What version should you use? Well if you can get version 2.17
      off an Commodore Install disk that might be best.  2.17 seems to
      do everything.  The next best bet it to grab Installer-1.25.lzh
      in util/misc of aminet.  This archive really has version 1.24 in
      it. This is what most Commercial programs come with and seems to
      run just fine.  Also 1.24 can be found on Fred Fish 870.
    </p>

    <h2>NOTE</h2>

    <p>If you do not already have the "Installer" program in your "c:"
      directory, it would be a good idea to get your Install Disk (the
      one that comes with the Operating System Disks), and copy the
      Installer from there to "c:" _or_ at least place it somewhere in
      your path.
    </p>

    <p>Also pointed out in the last issue by the Editor
      (something that I should have done) is that you _should not_
      hardcode a path to the installer in the tooltypes. Instead
      just have 'installer' for your 'Default Tool' in the installer
      script icon.
    </p>

    <p>Well that is about it for this installment ... hoped you
      learned something!!  If you wish to get more detailed
      information there is an Installer archive in/on the Fred Fish
      Collection that covers the _older_ 1.24 installer.</p>
