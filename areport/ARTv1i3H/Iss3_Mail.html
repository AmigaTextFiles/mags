    <p>
      I have just read you Issue 2 of the  ARTech  and  I  can
      just say: FINE!
    </p>

    <p>
      Although there are  not  much  articles  (The  copyright
      notice   looks  bigger  than  the  articles  8)),  its  very
      interesting. Where can I get the "pointerdefs.h" ?? 8))
    </p>

    <p>
      It could be interesting if you could include a reference
      guide for Amiga-Programmers. I always had the problem to get
      examples sources and documentations for special hardware and
      software.
    </p>

    <p>
      Examples:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Where can I get sources of an example implementation of  a
	Halftone-Dithering?  Who  comes  to the idea, looking at the
	Sourcecode of  "SpecialHost  for  AmigaTeX"  which  includes
	nearly all dither-routines?
      <li>How to get a documentation for SCSI programming?  Did  you
	really  know that under "http://www.abekrd.co.uk/SCSI2/" you
	find a complete reference?
      <li>Where to get a documentation for a scanner?
      <li>Where can I find good examples of  programming  Msg-Ports?
	Whats the filename in this archive?
      <li>Where to get documenation for a XXX-algorithm and where can
	I find example sources?
    </ul>

    <p>There are many other questions. A list  which  could  be
	completed every issue would be nice.</p>

    <p>
      An article how to make good AmigaGuide dcumentations and
      online  helps  and  when  to use them, would also be nice, i
      hate bad docs!
    </p>

    <p><em>
      Good suggestions. Would someone like to volunteer to maintain a
      such a reference?

    <p>
      I have read both the issues of ARTech and
      found it to be interesting. Can you please
      make the articles a bit long and self-contained
      instead of splitting them in parts?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Congrats for the good work.
    </p>

    <p><em>
      From now on, back issues will be updated to contain links to the
      continuation articles. This will of course only work on the
      official AR Tech Journal WWW sites.

      Hello,<br>
      This is very strange. When I click on the Issue 1,April 07, 1995 archive HTML, instead
      of trying to download the file I get what looks like binary information on the screen. I'm
      using netscape but for some reason it's reading it as ascii instead of knowing to download it.
      I've never experienced this at any other site. Perhaps it's not correctly archived?
    </p>

    <p><em>
      This is an unfortunate problem in WWW servers and browsers that
      do not recognise an LhA archive as binary data. The easiest
      remedy is to turn on loading to local disk before following the
      archive link. This is the "load to local disk" option in Mosaic,
      and the "d)ownload" command in Lynx. In Netscape, click on the
      link while holding down the shift key.

      Hello all,<br>
      Thanx for putting together a good Amiga programming source of info.  I 
      only have a few suggestions.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>What about a series of 'Beginning to program on the Amiga' articles?
	Using different languages (not just C).
      <li>Comparison of different programming languages?
	Amiga-E, LISP, ARexx, etc...
      <li>Hardware section?
	How to put in that extra floppy.  How to autoconfig that memory.
    </ul>

    <p>
      Keep up the good work!  :)
    </p>

    <p><em>
      I hope you like the Amiga E course starting in this issue. Any
      hardware experts out there interested in writing some articles?
    </em></p>
