    <hr>

    <p>In ARTech issue 2, I asked you, the readers, what aspects you
      feel are the most important in a good program. I got 31 answers,
      far too few to really count, but it might give some idea of the
      things users expect regardless.
    </p>

    <p>Below are the choices, listed in order of importance. The score
      is the average score in the replies, with the range of 1 to
      5.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Stability                                     [4.97]

    <p>8 of the respondents were from USA, 5 from England and Italy, 4
      from Germany, 3 from Sweden, and 1 from Finland, Australia,
      Netherlands, Poland and Canada each.</p>

      and BBS's both getting 5 people. One person got ARTech from
      Compuserve.</p>
