AR Mailing List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report
in UUENCODED form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put
on the list, send Email to listserv@bbs.xnet.com and in the body of
the message put:

ADD <mailaddress> armag

ie: ADD rniles@goofy.com armag

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an
intact copy. For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming
messages.

Joining the Amiga Report Coverdisk list is just as easy, but REQUIRES
that your mail site be able to handle messages in excess of 600k.
Place the following in the body of a message to listserv@bbs.xnet.com:

ADD <mailaddress> ardisk

ie: ADD rniles@goofy.com ardisk

Many thanks to X-Net Information Systems for setting this service up
for us!

** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!

                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
World Wide Web
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AR can also be read with Mosaic (in either AmigaGuide or html form).
Reading AmigaReport with Mosaic removes the necessity to download it.
It can also be read using programs found in UNIX sites such as LYNX.

Simply tell Mosaic to open the following URL:
http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/People/mjw/Computer/Amiga/AR/MainPage.html

Mosaic for the Amiga can be found on Aminet in directory comm/net, or
(using anonymous ftp) on max.physics.sunysb.edu

Mosaic for X, Macintosh(tm) and Microsoft Windows(tm) can be found on
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu


                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Aminet
~~~~~~
To get Amiga Report from Aminet, simply FTP to any Aminet site, CD
to docs/mags. All the back issues are located there as well.
(ftp.cdrom.com or ftp.wustl.edu are two sites)

UUEncoding/Decoding (thanks to Bob Tomasevich for the quick tutorial)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is uuencoding and uudecoding?
----------------------------------
uuencoding is converting a binary file into text (ASCII) which can be
sent through mail or Usenet.  uudecoding is reversing the process
(e.g. converting the file back to binary).


Why would I want to do this?
----------------------------
You have to send a binary file to a user who does not have
FTP access, or the user is too lazy to FTP the file.


What is the normal procedure?
-----------------------------
1. Convert the binary file into ASCII, using uuencode.
2. Send the file, through email, to the user.
3. The person on the receiving end gets the email, which may
   be split into parts.  If the email is split into parts, the
   parts must be combined, in the order received, into one file.
4. Receiving person converts the file back into binary, using uudecode.


What does a uuencoded file look like?
-------------------------------------
The start always has:

    begin 644 <encoded file's name>

So, for the file happy-happy-joy-joy.txt, it would look like:

    begin 644 happy-happy-joy-joy.txt

The encoded file begins right after:

M1TE&.#=A@`+@`9<````$`*QB15=2.+&/@R(Y)XM8.=J]H+*%7BL6#8]F6EP_]
M*$=E5"L?L-Z8A-:#60\@$,9P27-4-YB#;4HY)U!L9KZNE\O"O["#;8]82SDF>
M&[%J4FI',.&:E`48#="4@SE41M61<R`@%R$\,9:.?&!Z=NWM_\V';H-D1TI`=

.. more lines like the above ..

M>(`)N(`-^(`1.($5>($9N($=^($A.((E>((IN((M^((Q.(,U>(,YN(,]^(-!+
&V"\"`@`[&
``
end              <-- the end of the encoded file
size 151341      <-- size of the original file


So, how would I do this on the Amiga?
-------------------------------------
There are many uuencode/decode variants out there, but most usually
have kept the old UNIX command line, which can be confusing to novices,
or, require you to remove all mail headers and other, non-uuencoded text.

Luckily, Asher Feldman took the time to write UUxt.


What is UUxT?
-------------
It is a program which performs both the uuencode/decode operations in
one executable, AND, can also pack/unpack LhA archives.


Tell me more.
-------------
The UUxT archive contains UUxT, the CLI version, and UUxtGUI, the
Workbench interface.  I will give a short summary of how to use
both.  Detailed instructions are included in the UUxT archive.

  CLI Version:
  ------------

  Running UUxT without any options gives the following:

     UUxT Version 2.1a Copyright (c)1993 Asher Feldman
     USAGE: UUxT [option] [archive name] <LhA archive name> <file(s)>
     options: a - encode           l - LhAencode
              x - decode           u - LhAdecode

  showing the format of the command line and the valid options.


  Some example command lines:

  1. Normal encoding - UUxt a filename.uue filename-to-archive

  2. Normal decoding - UUxt x filename.uue

  3. LhA archiving and encoding -

            UUxT l filename.uue filename.lha file1 file2 ...

  4. Decoding and LhA unarchiving - UUxT u filename.uue

  For LhA encoding and decoding, you will need LhA by Stefan Boberg.


  Workbench (GUI) Version:
  ------------------------
  Below is a ASCII rendition of the UUxT-GUI window (from UUxtGUI doc):

  (1) Clicking on this brings up a requester to select the file you want
      to perform the operation shown in gadget (5).

  (2) You can manually type here the filename of the file affected by the
      operation indicated in gadget (5).

  (3) Used only for encoding, brings up a requester to select where the
      encoded file should go.  Selecting an existing file will cause the
      existing file to be replaced by the encoded file.  You can also use
      this requester to create directories.

  (4) You can manually type the filename of the file to be the encoded file.

  (5) The operation to perform on file shown in (2).  The operations are
      the four provided by UUxT (uuencode/uudecode/LhAEncode/LhADecode).

  (6) The name of the archive created with the LhAEncode option.  Ignored
      when any other operation is selected.

  (7) Does the encode/decode/LhAEncode/LhADecode and pops up a requester
      indicating if the operation was successful or not.


I need this!  Where can I get it?
---------------------------------
If you use the Internet from a local BBS, you may find it there.  If not
you can FTP it from wuarchive.wustl.edu, in the directory

                          pub/aminet/arc/UUxT.lha

It should also be on the Aminet mirrors.


Thanks for the explanation!  How can I reach you if I have questions?

Time just keeps ticking away...and the end is always a month or so ahead.

The Amiga keeps sliding along, despite a horrifying wait that is
stretching into legend.  When this is all over...we won't forget it for
a long, long time.

Commodore stock certificates look like they might be best as collector's
items...disappointing, really.

As for developments...well, there are always those.  This time, we've got
the exclusive transcript of the CEI Conference on Portal, which Amiga
Report organized.  Alan Buxey is supposed to extend my invitation to
David Pleasance for his own, so time will tell how that goes.  Another
German company has allegedly entered the fray, but we'll see what happens
there.

Observant readers will have noticed that there's a new subheading for
the magazine: Commercial AR.  This was the "Selling selected products"
I spoke about earlier...sort of.  I'm still finalizing details
(payment methods) with Micro R+D and Quasar Distribution, but David
Tiberio has taken Area 52 mail order, and I have agreed to run a price
list here with the understanding that he re-invests a portion of AR-
generated profits in the magazine, in the form of obtaining review
equipment, making phone calls, and the like.  I have tried to make
it unobtrusive but fairly easy to find if you want it, and at the same
time minimizing the size.  Please, tell me what you think.

In the meantime...try to enjoy yourself.  If you're an IRC fan, check
out the Announcements section.  If you want to read some of my reviews...
they're here as always.  Or, if you like 30k of conversation, read the
Portal conference.

Actually, I'd feel best if you read all of it.

Enjoy.

HyperCache Pro V2.0 now works with AmigaDOS 3.1...William Near had an
early version that didn't.  The fix is free of charge from Silicon
Prairie, and includes a better GUI.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

CEI got itself into a wire news report recently, with comments about how
Amigas are becoming incredibly hard to find to meet the US demand for
them...something painfully obvious to Amiga users everywhere, but nice to
see in the general press.  It brings things one step closer to being
jump-startable once someone gets the Amiga goods.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

CEI held a conference on Portal this Tuesday.  Its transcript and the
participants (67 all told) are available in this issue.

BIX is actively pursuing CEI for a conference (Once again, Amiga Report
will be acting as the intermediary for the conference.  As an aside, Amiga
World's Tim Walsh took part in the Portal conference, but Amazing
Computing was not represented, despite over a week advance notice of the
event.)  CEI was also working on arranging for a conference on CompuServe.

On that note, I have asked Alan Buxey to give David Pleasance my home
number and a 24-hour-a-day invitation to call to arrange a similar
conference, but Pleasance has not been reachable at the Maidenhead office.

If someone with contact with Pleasance reads this, my voice number is
printed in the magazine, and the offer still stands.

A third company, a German computer manufacturer, has joined the bidding.
Escom was the name given by Jim Meyer, the editor of ViewPort magazine.
So far, that's all I know about it.

From Alan Buxey, Man on the Streets of Great Britain:


The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) networking club has now been
running for over 2 months. Its aim is to get the common household owner
onto the Net as easily as possible. And to help them into net.life by
giving them "sponsors" - people who will help them around a bit and give
them some info.

The club comprises of a WWW site - almost totally open to all people
(even none club members), an FTP and telnet site (only for club members)
and various other pages. There is also a set of pages covering the TV
schedule.

One of the most exciting ideas of the club is "interactive
communication". several of the companies television and radio shows can
be contacted via email -> and some are contactable WHILST THE SHOW IS ON
AIR. This enables you to do anything from putting a request for a song
on a radio show, to sending in your most recently done picture to an art
program -> all in real time. No more phone in competitions, the future
will be "best picture in 1 hour on <this topic>" etc ;)

Now, this is all very well for the average Net user, but what has this
to to with the Amiga? Well, apart from the fact that the Amiga would be
great for the graphics competitions etc, the whole system is going to be
designed with an easy to use front end system.

Unfortunately, less than a month ago, this front end system was going to
be for PC's, Mac's and Acorn Archimedes machines only. After a large
number of requests - and press interest from people like myself, the
Networking Club has realized that there are a LARGE amount of Amigas on
the Net _already_ and that although the Acrhimedes may be highly used in
schools (hence the support), the machine that most of the kids have back
home will be an Amiga. Demon Internet were ready to confirm this data.

Now, Dominik von Malaise a chief systems developer for the BBC
Networking Club has stated that the Amiga front end package is in
development and will be ready for next spring (earliest).

= A New way to connect to Portal: any speed, $2.95/hr, 24 hours a day =

If you live in the Continental USA (the lower 48 states),
You now have another alternative for connecting to Portal.  This letter
contains a lot of info.. please read ALL of it to avoid confusion.
It is worded so that the novice user will understand it.

As you probably already know, you can connect to Portal in these ways:

1. Dial direct to Portal's San Jose, CA modems. (You pay for the
   phone call if it's not local).

2. Dial your local SprintNet number and connect with "c portal" and
   pay the usual SprintNet charges (typically $2.50/hour for evenings
   and weekends, and higher during "prime" business hours, or you can
   buy bulk hours under the Portal Pursuit plan for Sprintnet.)

3. Telnet to "portal.com" from another Internet-connected host, with
   no hourly charge at all.

One of these 3 ways works for most people. However some of you do not
want to dial long distance, and do not have another Internet account
and do not have a local SprintNet number.... if this sounds like
you, then read on:

You now have another way in to Portal and it DOES NOT replace any
of the above methods.  It is a new way in ADDED to the above methods.

            *             *            *
You can now connect to Portal via the Compuserve data network. Before
you read further, be aware that YOU DO NOT NEED TO JOIN THE CIS
SERVICE ITSELF TO LOG INTO PORTAL ON THEIR DATA NETWORK!
            *             *            *

You will simply use their data network's local number, at ANY login
speed it supports, to connect to Portal, like you would use SprintNet.
You do NOT need to buy a CIS account.  So don't. :-)

All billing will be direct to your Portal account BY Portal.
You see it each time you log off.  You can start using this new
login method if you want to right now.  It is operational right now.

Logging in this way will cost you $2.95 per hour, 24 hours a day,
365 days a year. There is NOT a higher rate for "prime time" usage.
This same rate applies at ANY login speed: 300, 1200, 2400, 9600,
or 14.4Kbps, all day, all night, every day and night.

        HOW TO FIND YOUR LOCAL CIS DATA NETWORK NUMBER:

Call 1-800-848-8980 with a telephone. Press option 2.
Follow the voice prompts to find your local access number.

Once you have the number, here is how to connect to Portal with it:


      Instructions for connecting via Compuserve Data Network
      -------------------------------------------------------

1. Set your serial interface to 8N1 (8 bit data, no parity, 1 stop bit)

2. Dial the local Compuserve number

   To get your local Compuserve number, call 1-800-848-8980,
   select option 2, and follow the instructions.

3. After the modem CONNECT message, enter "<RETURN>"

4. You should see a "Host Name: " prompt.

   With some communication software, this prompt will be garbled.
   If it's garbled, enter "+<RETURN>" (plus key then return key)
   and the correct "Host Name: " prompt will appear.

5. At the "Host Name: " prompt, enter "portal<RETURN>"

6. This will connect you to Portal. When you see the
   "Enter service or help: " prompt, follow the normal Portal
   login procedure.

7. There are some shortcuts you can use when connecting to a specific
   Portal service. The table below shows what will happen if you enter
   additional information at the "Host Name: " prompt:

     Enter              Action
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  "portal,online<RETURN>"  connect directly to online system login

  "portal,shell<RETURN>"   connect directly to shell system login

  "portal,uucp<RETURN>"    connect directly to uucp system login

  "portal,ppp1<RETURN>"    connect directly to ppp system login

  "portal,slip<RETURN>"    connect directly to slip system login

  "portal,pop1<RETURN>"    connect directly to pop system login
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Canadian users - details are still being worked out for you to use
this new login method.  Stay Tuned.

            "Musings", Aric R. Caley
            "AmItalia", Gabriele Peterle
            other 'Amiga Fan' stuff ...

Hello, everybody!

I read AR for about 1 year now. And as you may see, I'm a german Amiga
owner. So, please forgive my english, which is not so well.

Especially, I can't agree with Aric's ideas of how to 'save' the Amiga!
It's much easier than many of you think it is, 'cos it's just business!
And business doesn't demand further tons of Amiga's like they exist
nowadays. I don't think, flooding the world with ... yes, OLD Amigas is
the solution to make the future of our Amiga a better place.  :-)

Commodore did wait much to long to offer a new model with better
capabilities of graphic, sound, CPU-Power. I think, the only way to
restore the Amiga's state as it was in good, old A500, A1000 and A2000
times, is to sell a totally new machine with 24 Bit graphics, 16 Bit
sound and a new, fast CPU like the PowerPC 601. Well, the 68060 is good
enough, too. But I'd prefer the PowerPC due to the future and the
competition with others like Apple.

I was one of the very first Amiga owner's. I spend all my money 1986 and
bought a brandnew computer (architecture). And why? You all should know
it: one computer - all posibilities! (Graphic, Sound, Custom-Chips, ...)
That's the reason why I would buy another Amiga. I don't have to buy
sound-card's and graphic-board's. Every Amiga was born with 8 Bit sound.
So, every software can fall back on this ability! And so it is with all
the other Amiga stuff: what's in every Amiga, that can be used by every
Software! No silly driver's, for each board another driver. But the last
years, there's a similar trend like it ever was with the PC's. Now, you
can buy many graphic-card's for the Amiga. And every card needs a special
Software. Is that the future of Amiga? I hope not.

And to avoid such a development, there has to be new Amigas without the
need to buy several card's which includes dependency of small companies
... -> GVP :-(

I still have my Amiga 1000! PAL, ECS, 2MB Chip Mem, 68020, 68881, OS 2.1,
100 MB HD. And I'm still happy with it! But in case a new Amiga with
features like I mentioned above come out, I'll spend all my money again!
And I know several other Amiga owners just waiting for such an Amiga!

Don't produce new Amiga models like the A500, A2000 or A3000! They were
just a small step ahead. No new generation of PERSONAL Computers like the
Amiga 1000 was it!


Hmmm ... this should go to Commodore, I think. Amiga Report should make
a survey to ask
1. how many Amiga users are there? (at least)
2. what Amiga models do they have?
3. how much money would they spend for a new, perfect Amiga model?

In my case I would spend about DM 5.000 ($ 3.500) for it. What about you?

Have a nice day!   :-)


-   I, personally, am not in a position to spend $3,500 on a new Amiga
    system...but I'll gladly take one for review.

From: Paul@Grafix.wlink.nl

After reading numerous AR's and many enthusiastic letter from fellow
Amiga-lovers I decided to add my own two cents, (sorry to coin that corny
phrase). Why? Because I finally accepted that if the Amigian  doesn't talk
about Amiga's himself, no-one will. I the past I always assumed the 'big-shots'
from C= would do that work for me, reasoning: "It's their job, I suppose they
know more about it than I do". Unfortunately my trust in the people that were
leading the company that produced the machine I lost my soul to weren't the
kind of people I held them to be. While C= was in it's death struggle I, for
some time, still didn't lose confidence that it all would get well. Then there
was a period of time that everything went black, C= seized to exist... I must
add that at that time, I could not care less, since a lot of the people that
would loose their jobs apply to the saying: "Good riddance to old rubbish".
Unfortunately also a lot of good people lost their place in the future of the
Amiga and were forced to join other companies; Scala to name one.

But now, a sprinkle of hope is finding its way back with the plans of C=UK, or
rather "Amiga International" trying to get the Amiga back on track again. Let's
hope that finally rising from the ashes of C= a company comes to existence with
management that really believes in the Amiga, and does the marketing for the
Amiga that should have been done ages ago.

A lot of things have been said about David Pleasance, and he has said quite a
few things himselve in the past that should better not be repeated here (he
tends to see things a bit too much on the bright side) but one thing can be
said for him; He sure believes in the Amiga, he's certainly not in it for the
cash. Further more, he's our only hope for the moment, and he is somebody who
_does_ act now to try and secure the Amiga's future. If he gets the deal, I'll
be very glad, for two reasons: The first one being that at least there will be
hope again, and last but not least, finally a man that believes in the Amiga
will be at the helm of the company. His statements about renaming the company
to Amiga-international, sub-licensing the architecture and keeping in touch
with the users ensure me that he is a man of vision, I hope he also is a man of
his word. That we'll have to see in the future.

Love a machine? Get real!

Some people find it hard to understand the love that I have for something as
lifeless as a machine. I can understand that, it must look very silly to other
people to see a grown man so involved with what they consider a
"big-boy's-toy". It's more than that though. Studying computer-science I
stumbled upon the Amiga now more than eight years ago as it was introduced to
me by a schoolmate.

Since that moment this machine has been a constant factor in my life. If
anything, a computer is a accumulation of abstract thoughts, from the ideas
that the hardware-scientist had when dreaming up the chipset up to the visions
of the software-guys while creating the operation system. Getting to know your
computer, all you do is find one idea after another, some might even be
compelling, like MS-DOS is to me. But once in a while you find something that
makes you go "Hey.. that's _smart!_". You will understand what my overall
feelings were when I started exploring the Amiga and started programming it.
Finding one jewel after the other made me fall in love with this computer.
Wouldn't you? If you met a pretty, slim and smart lady, that even has her
moments of humor (remember Fred and Wilma?) in a world of fat gray dressed
women wearing ties only talking about work? I guess I've proven my point ;-)

As of this moment I can do nothing but sit and wait... will the return of the
Amiga be a victory? WILL there be a return? Will it finally become a computer
that is regognised for its power and ease of use? Will it be marketed?

Or will my next computer be a SGI...
(Don't expect me to take a step back!)

David, you are my last hope.. Please(ance) go ahead, and make my day!

-    There are other people involved than Pleasance...but it's your
     opinion and now everybody else knows it.  :)

Harv: WE ARE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMIGA'S FUTURE.
   OUR GUEST TONITE WILL HOPEFULLY HAVE SOME FRESH INFO FOR US.
   HE IS A MAN WHO MAY VERY WELL END UP BEING THE MAKER OF AMIGAS.
   SO WITHOUT ANY MORE OF THIS...
   I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU, PRES. OF CEI, MR. ALEX AMOR. WELCOME,
   ALEX... IF THER ARE OTHERS WITH YOU, PLEASE INTRODUCE THEM TO US?
CEI-Alex: Thank you Harv!

Harv: NO INTROS?
CEI-Alex: No intros.

Harv: AS MODERATOR, I WILL ASK THE FIRST QUESTION.
   ALEX - WE ARE ALL AWARE OF THE SEEMINGLY ENDLESS "BIDDING" GOING
   ON... INVOLVING YOUR COMPANY.... DAVID PLEASANCE OF C=UK....
   AND OTHERS....
   CAN YOU PLEASE TELL US EXACTLY WHER THINGS STAND RIGHT NOW,
   HOW MANY BIDDERS THERE ARE AND IF YOU CAN SAY WHO THEY ARE?
CEI-Alex: To date I am aware of at least three parties who are
   interested in acquiring the Amiga technology, they include the UK
   management team, a German concern and ourselves.

lance: is there any truth to a card being mfg to pop into a pc?
CEI-Alex: No, there are a lot of rumors but nothing definite on a pc card.

lance: all i want is one simple answer did a deal go thru in favor of the
   Amiga being continued?
CEI-Alex: NO, a final deal for the acquisition of C= is not complete...
   the reality is that who ever buys c= will end up manufacturing Amigas..
   It makes economic sense.

RLStockton: When do you expect to know who has made the winning bid?
CEI-Alex: Final negotiations are ongoing...a decision is expected towards
   the end of October. I wish it could be completed sooner,but you know...
   the lawyers.

Harv: [[ BRIEF INTERRUPTION, WELCOME TO KEN DYKE AND DAVE "HAZY"
   HAYNIE, FORMER COMMODOR EENGINEERS! PLEASE WITHHOLD
   HELLOS FOR NOW. THANK YOU ]]

RLStockton: isn't that the same thing we heard in August?
CEI-Alex: You didn't hear that from me..  we have no choice at times but
   to laugh at the rumors.. I remember when Samsung had completed the deal
   hehehe.

PKB: Alex... if you win... what are your plans for the loyal amiga users
   and users groups?
CEI-Alex: Its' obvious that the core group of Amiga loyalist are a great
   asset to who ever ends up owning the technology.  Each and every Amiga
   owner can become a salesperson for the Amiga.  The new company needs to
   dedicate resources to assist the owners and individuals who make up the
   Amiga community.

Robert-DuGaue: First of all, Hi Alex! We all appreciate you taking the time
   to chat with us!  Ok, this will probably cover a lot of questions right
   off. :-)  Should CEI come out on top of the bidding, what are your plans
   for the Amiga?  Likewise, do you have backup plans should CEI come up
   second?
CEI-Alex: The first item of business is to fill the huge gap left by C=,
   this means restarting production of the A4000T (Yes T) and the A1200.
   In addition it is extremely important to jump start the engineering
   team and move the technology forward...things like 3D Risc and RTG are
   crucial if the Amiga is to survive in the long term.

Kermit: Thanks for being here tonight Alex. My questions: could you outline
   for us your future plans (hopes/dreams) for new Amiga technology, the
   Amiga market, and for developer relation and support?
CEI-Alex: Your question is all encompassing.....
Kermit: (I do my best)
CEI-Alex: It's easy to look at C= and learn from their mistakes... The
   following are important to being successful with the Amiga:
   Engineering, User-support, Marketing, and a staff dedicated to a product
   they believe in.  Each of the above topics require hours of explanation.

dtiberio: Will you license/OEM the motherboards so that small developers
   like myself can sell "clone" amigas? It is important to do it in a way
   that machines can be built as easily as 486's are built now.
CEI-Alex: I would not rule out licensing the technology and the Amiga...
   Commodore's mistake (one of many) was to keep the technology almost
   behind closed doors.  The more users the merry.

Harv: TIM (ED. OF AMIGA WORLD) WELCOME! YOUR TURN.

TimWalsh: Alex, some rough numbers please on the inventory that exists...
   CD32, A4000, A1200, monitors, 8-bit stuff.
CEI-Alex: TIM, does the word ZIP mean anything to you?  There are some
   CD32 around the world mostly PAL, but that's it.

jcompton: There are so many things...ok, I'll pick one.  Right now, I've
   got a CD32 streaming tunes out on my stereo.  You didn't really say
   anything much about them.  Do I and thousands of others around the world
   get stuck with $400 CD players?
CEI-Alex: No Jason, far from that, the CD32 still remains a viable product.
   as you are probably aware there were over 100k units sold without proper
   support or accessories.  There remains a strong demand for the MPEG unit
   which should go into production fairly quickly...once positive movement
   is seen within the developers we expect to see a number of new CD based
   products.

lance: the questions here around the beltway in DC is this...Laptops,
     timeliness of risc tech, friendliness in marketing, software support
     from current and future publishers and finally is there any real hope
     to believe in the Amiga?
CEI-Alex: The bottom line is the Amiga technology still makes sense.  What
   was the last time someone played with Windows?  There are a number of
   opportunities for the existing Amigas and new products in the futures...
   NO PC can deliver the perfomance on an Amiga 1200 or CD32 for anywhere
   near the price.  And on the other side of the spectrum can you imagine
   doing video on a PC?
lance: WHAT ABOUT A LAPTOP?
CEI-Alex: With the current technology (according to the engineers), it is
   unreasonable to release a laptop without a car battery attached.  The
   new technology which is inhouse at C= will allow for the production of
   laptops in the future.
soft-logik: [I'd settle for a laptop with a 120v AC cord]
hazy: Comment: With RTG in place, you could make a laptop using OTS
   parts, sacrifice non-RTG compliant SW.

Dpaint-Demon: Alex, I know one of the most frustrating things being an
   Amiga owner is to tell people of the technology and have them ask Omega?
   What's that a Clone?  What avenues will you take in advertising. TV,
   Radio, the such, and what sort of reservses in advertising are we
   talking?
CEI-Alex: I know how fustrating that is.  The only way around that is to
   let the general public know what Amigas are all about...  That's usually
   accomplished through the magic M word...  MARKETING!
   To start AGGRESSIVE campaigns in tradeshows, and printads....
   slowly develop the market and exploit the niches... what was the last
   time you saw Commodore advertise in VIDEO or VIDEOGRAPHY?
   Or even AW?

DeckApe: Alex: a two-parter:
   1) Money: C= lost millions. Does CEI have the financial horsepower to
   first BUY C= then RUN it without hocking all of grandma's jewelry?
   2) CEI itself: a publicly held corporation? Is stock available for
   purchase?  (I know my C= stock is worthless except as a collector
   item, but...)  If CEI DOES end up owning C=, is there a way I can once
   again "own a piece of the rock"?
CEI-Alex: C= was profitable, but those who operated made in unprofitable...
   CEI has acquired the financial backing (read partners and investors)
   not only to purchase C= but also to fully funds marketing, engineering
   and new products.
   Part Two:  CEI is currently a privately held company. The investors view
   a public stock offering two years down the road if we are succesful.  By
   the way C= stock make wonderful wall paper especially in bathrooms.

Izzy: what kind of restrictions will be placed on you from the creditors if
   you win the bid? (or is it an outright purchase of technology?)  What,
   if any, side deals do you have planned? (ie. C= UK, Newtek, Scala...)
CEI-Alex: The creditors have no control over anything.  This deal will be
   similar to a chapter 7 us bankrupcty.  The assets of C= will be sold to
   the highest bidder and there is no need to look back....
   As "side deals" are concerned we view that the more people who are
   willing to utilize the technology the better.  We have excellent
   relationships with both Newtek and Scala and look forward to
   working with them in the future.

Harv: Alex I have a two part semi-unrelated question for you and it goes
   like this.. (1) rumor has it some former employees of the C= philippines
   plant are "pirating" amigas on the production line. what do you know
   about this if you can say and...  (2) is it all or nothing for you and
   Pleasance (C=UK bidder) or is there any chance you will split the prize,
   e taking uk/europe,  you north america?
CEI-Alex: Unfortunately, the rumor of the Philippines is not true.  The
   banks that currently control the plant do not let individual in or out..
   As far as UK's team I have always kept an open door for any proposals
   that make sense and assists in the continuation of the Amiga.

Jumpdisk: Does your bid include the entire Amiga line (1200, 4000, cd32)
   and how does it differ from C=UK?
CEI-Alex: The bidding process is a closed one.  I do not know what the C=UK
   is bidding.  But, as far as the CEI bid it includes all technologies,
   current and past, products, licenses, etc.

Rabel1: The current WB3.1 is being sold for $100-$150 at a few outlets..Any
   plan on distributing WB3.1 at a more reasonible rate to more outlets?
CEI-Alex: Currently, the 3.1WB is basically a pirated copy... since the C=
   infrastructure fell apart many individuals have violated certain
   copyrights and patents.  Part of the plan is to introduce a new version
   of the operating system properly and price it reasonably....in order to
   avoid confusion it could be release as 3.2.  This of course would be one
   of the first products to hit the stores.
Harv: Alex - if I may jump in here, are you saying that the 3.1 being sold
   by Expert Services is illegal? I think they would beg to differ with you.
CEI-Alex: No, I'm not pointing the finger to Expert.. there are a number of
   sources selling copies of the diskettes and ROMs with xerox manuals.
Harv: Alex, okay thanks because Expert warned of pirated 3.1s themselves.

Wizard0: Alex,thanks for coming and good luck with your bid. Dave Pleasance
   has stated that if C= UK wins, they will be unable to release AAA.  What
   is your view on this, and do think AAA is still viable?  Also any truth
   to the rumored 3D-RISC C= was working on?  Will we ever see something
   better then AGA?
CEI-Alex: I spent sometime with the C= engineers and can tell you that I
   don't believe AAA will make the light of day the technology is old and
   obsolete (circa 1991)....C= engineers have been working on 3DRISC which
   appears to be a winner.. Our efforts will concentrate on this technolgy.

Luis B.: saludos Alex. What are your plans for distributing the Amigas
   besides US? And how are you going to distribute the Amiga in Puerto
   Rico? I hope you do not do what C= did. NO support, cheaper to mail
   ordered them than buy them locally, but then, no warranty..  I am not
   talking $300.00 difference, we are talking $1000.00 diference.
Harv: (Luis is in Puerto Rico, if that's not obvious :)
CEI-Alex: In order to sell our investment package to wallstreet we created a
   world wide distribution system based on independent distributors
   throughout Europe and the Far East.  To date we have received over 50
   applications from companies interested in distributing, marketing and
   supporting the Amiga from around the world.  PR will receive the support
   and service which its Amiga's customer's deserve.

hazy: I just had a question or two to call on the AAA vs. RISC issue.
   One might wonder if the current engineers' recommendations against
   AAA is based on the fact that no one involved with AAA is actually left
   at C=, rather than its suitability versus a RISC project that is [a] not
   Amiga compatible in the least, and [b] not yet in silicon.  The RISC
   project certainly makes a better CD32. I don't necessarily believe it
   makes a better A4000, at least not yet.
CEI-Alex: Hazy, as always we will keep an open mind.. I fully believe that
   we need to bring back talent from the past and take a close look at
   the future.. Having one or two new products in the four years never made
   sense to us... Determining the next step for the Amiga is important.. I
   would like to see RTG, faster machines, more slots and all the goodies..
   Remember, I not only sell Amigas, I use them too.  The processor issue
   has to be addressed and I would rather due it sooner than later.

hazy: There's also some question about the RISC project as a game machine,
     when compared to Sony Playstation or Nintendo Project Reality.

KenD: [3DRISC is]better, but not good enough - IMHO
Harv: KEN DYKE, ANY OTHER COMMENTS AS A FORMER C= ENGINEER? GA.
KenD: Sure.  As some advice to CEI, I strongly suggest that they take a
   close look at some of the other soon-to-be-released game platforms
   before betting the farm on 3D RISC.  I know what 3D RISC was supposed to
   be capable of, and my current position lets me play with many of the new
   machines on the way.  Let's just say that I have my doubts as to the
   viability of 3D RISCespecially given that it is not yet in silicon. The
   upside of course is that it can still have design work done on it.  I
   would rather see that stuff in a computer than in a console, anyway.
CEI-Alex: Yes...  The major market for the Amigas is the low end personal
   computer and the high end video.  I certaintly would not bet the farm on
   the CD32...  This is what Mehdi did and we have all seen what happen...
   I think we should move towards a more powerful desktop and perfect our
   low end home computers... The CD32 is an important multimedia delivery
   platform.

Harv: ANDY FINKEL (ALSO EX-C=) HAS A COMMENT. GO AHEAD ANDY?
Andy - Finkel: Thanks.  One comment...the Amiga OS will certainly port
   faster to the AAA than to a non Amiga chipset... and the OS is part of
   what makes a computer an Amiga.

CarmenR: Alex: If push came to shove in the bidding game, would you
   consider joining with C=UK to prevent the technology from going to a
   bidder who doesn't want to continue the Amiga line?  And what do you
   think the odds are of 'push coming to shove' ?
CEI-Alex: Carmenr, we have always left the door open to working jointly
   other interested parties.  After having some discussions in the early
   part of the game they left me with the feeling that they wanted all or
   nothing... For this reason we have worked indenpendtly.

jcompton: MODERATOR INTERJECT:  For clarity, Alex, who currently holds the
   top bid, and as of when is the information?
CEI-Alex: My understanding that as of two weeks ago CEI had the top bid..
   At the same time C= was not able to deliver all the goods and we have
   been asked to resubmit a new bid for the deliverables.

TheDuck: i never see any mention of the 3000, regardless of the direction
     that you take, will it include the inclusion of the 3000? ie: AGA
     compatibility etc? thanks
CEI-Alex: Duck, The best way to address compatibility with older Amigas is
   to offer an aggressive upgrade program that makes sense to all....  The
   small number of 3000s on the market do not make it feasible.

RLStockton: First, I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to us.
   1.  Will there be Amigas on sale this Xmas season?  2. Good luck with
   your bid!
CEI-Alex:I know you dont want to hear this, but at this time the likelihood
   of Amigas being in store shelves by Christmas is none.  Our current
   schedule calls for machines in Late Feb 95.
Harv: :(
jcompton: Just in time for St. Patrick's Day.

TimWalsh: Alex, you've mentioned DevCons. When ?
CEI-Alex: Tim, Devcons will be held almost immediately after acquisition
   both in the US and in Europe.  Getting developers back on line is one of
   our most important missions!
RLStockton: excellent news!
DeckApe: Good to hear!

jcompton: Back to backwards compatibility.  Anyway, any Amiga user doing
   just about any sort of OS or chipset upgrade runs into problems, but
   with 3DRISC under your command, what sort of loss are we looking at?
   Total? Partial?  That, and when is the Amiga VIP dinner going to be held
   if you win?   :)
CEI-Alex: Jason, its too early to tell.  Our first goal is to bring back
   the current Amigas and to start working towards the next step (68060),
   increase performance and fix up some of the problems of the 4000.  After
   that we'll get old and new engineers and determine the new path.
KenD- Software would be a total loss, I'm afraid.  Different chipset,
   different CPU.
CEI-Alex: Jason, to follow up... The processor issue will have to be dealt
   with.... I do not know what the answer is.

dtiberio: First, are you working with Samsung on the CBM bid?
CEI-Alex: Dave, Samsung appears to be out of the running...

dtiberio: If you get the bid, will you work with 3rd party developers such
   as NewTek in order to INTEGRATE newer technologies in the Amiga
   (is that a pun)?
CEI-Alex: Yes on the Newtek question. We will work and support all third
   party developers. Even people who make help systems hehehe.

Dale - Cozort: The Uk group says that they can get A4000s and A1200s out
   by end of November. Care to Comment?
CEI-Alex: If you believe that I have property in the Everglades and a
   bridge in Brooklyn I like to sell you.
Dale - Cozort: May I follow up?
CEI-Alex: Yes.
Dale - Cozort: What are the obstacles to that happening? The long pole?
CEI-Alex: Three things...procurement...procurement....procurement....
   Parts are simply not available and many require long time periods.

RickB: How long can this bidding last. When do you think it will be final?
   and What city will Amiga Inc. be located if you WIN? Good luck!!!
CEI-Alex: I believe we are in the final stages of the bid process, remember
   Samsung, Phillips, etc. have all dropped out.  The new Amiga technology
   company would be based out of the Philadelphia area.  There is a good
   group of dedicated individuals that understand the Amiga and where it
   should go.

Harv: ALEX - WILL IT BE "AMIGA INC." OR DO YOU WANT TO SAY? OR WILL
   MFG BE DONE UNDER THE NAME "CEI"? WHAT WILL THE NAMEPLATE/
   CARTON SAY?
CEI-Alex: Harv, the working name is currently Amiga Technolgies
   International, but as you know this can change.

Prolific: I read on Usenet that Commodore's Westchester assets have been
   sold.  Does your financing plan include acquisition of the CAD systems
   necessary to physically design new hardware?
CEI-Alex: The assets that are necessary to restart engineering operations
   currently reside in the Norristown facility. Our bid covers these items.
Prolific: I thought they had been sold.
CEI-Alex: No, the items which were recently sold at the West Chester
   facilities were old engineering duplicates and obsolete equipment.
hazy: Comment: All the good engineering equipment went with the
   engineers to Norristown.
jcompton: REWARD FOR ANYONE WITH INFORMATION LEADING TO THE PURCHASER
   OF THE FLOOR SCRUBBER.

Izzy: 1: What kind of timeline do you see for implementation of your plans
   if it's not settled until end of Oct?  2: If so, what would be the
   priorities? (ie. 4000T's 1st, 1200's 2nd, new WB 3rd, etc...)  3: Also,
   what size of staff can you start off with? (and from where?) 4: How
   about packaging a coupon for a free mental stress reduction program with
   new Amigas?
CEI-Alex: The new WB almost immediately, the A4000T and 1200
   simultenously these should be hitting the store shelve new St Pattys
   day (in green of course)..
Private from jcompton to CEI-Alex- Stole my idea, did you?
Izzy: Any chance to get Lucky Charms mascot for Amy? :)
CEI-Alex: As staff is concerned we expect to restart operations with a
   coregroup of approximately 70.  CEI ran advertisements in the
   Philadelphia area for employees and received over 1500 resumes.
   I believe we have a good pool to pick from.
KenD: Comment: I think the biggest problem CEI will have is a lack of
   senior engineers to help bring new people up to speed on the system.

xeglon: Ok!  1st) Thanks for the bid! (HAIL! HAIL!)  2nd) What kind of
   marketing can we look forward to for the amiga platform?? I.e.  focus,
   US projects, etc.. Any scoop?
CEI-Alex: Our first year of US marketing expenditures are $20M with the
   majority being implemented once the product line is complete and
   backlogs have been filled... Marketing will be directed towards the
   niches,  let us become stronger in our markets with slow penetration
   into the general markets.

soft-logik: What kind of pricing strategy do you see for high-end Amigas?
   Will the 4000 ever be price competitive with 486 clones?
CEI-Alex: The price of the 4000 needs to be decrease while its
   performance increased...The A4000 will never be as inexpensive as
   the 486s, we should always win when it comes to cost versus
   performance.

Luis B.: In a world of PCs/Macs price wars, how competitive the Amiga is
   going to become? Are we going to see Amigas '040 for less than
   $1000.00?? And what is going to happen once Motorola decides that
   the 68xxx line is going to be closed?
CEI-Alex: As I mentioned the Amiga will have to adopt another processor
   soon.... The sooner the better.  This decision will have to be made by
   engineers who fully understand the Amiga.

Luis B.: Are you going to let the engeneers dictate the future of the Amiga
   or like old C=, marketing is going to say so???
CEI-Alex: I believe it has to be a cooperative venture between customers,
   engineers, marketing, and third party developers.

Harv: ALEX... LEMME KNOW IF YOU FEEL LIKE PASSING OUT. AND WE'LL END IT.
CEI-Alex: Harv, lets do another 15 mins or so, if its ok with u.

TheDuck: Alex, not to harp, but on the subject of upward compatibility,
   will the 4000 be compatible with new technology or will it be suplanted
   by yet another machine?... i think you just answered that one... but as
   my 1000 was quickly suplanted by the 2000, and as my 3000 was  quickly
   suplanted by the 4000, im a little leary of what to buy...
Harv: THAT'S PROGRESS, DUCK.
CEI-Alex: Its important for the developers and user to try to maintain as
   much compatibility as possible.. but remember in order to end up with
   the most powerful machine possible at some point in time we will have
   to migrate to another processor.
Harv: GO BUY A 1995 CAR WITH THE COMFORTABLE KNOWLEDGE THAT
   THEY'RE ALREADY DESIGNING THE 1999 MODELS
KenD: Harv: Yes, but 1999 cars will still run on gasoline and can use
   existing roads. :)
TheDuck: unfortunately not always so, remember unleaded gasoline?  :>

LUIS: 1.  What could possibly be in OS 3.2 thatit has to be released so
   soon? 2.  As a non engineer who has been waiting for two years for
   AAA, lets have it, AGA is no better than IBMs.  3.  If you do make a
   new machine, how about more slots and possibly a tower version
   release at the same time as the desktop model?
CEI-Alex: Number One, releasing the new WB will demonstrate that this
   is a new company with new goals, it is also an enhancement over the
   3.0 with better printer support, better command sets and a small step
   towards RTG.... On the second count, take a look at a 486 based PC
   running animations and then compare it with the Amiga 4000 even
   after so many years... there is no comparison.... As with the third
   question, more slots, more slots.. more slots... we have prototypes of
   the Amiga 4000T and boy what a nice machine.

Harv: ALEX I HAVE ONE COMMENT: AN AMIGA WITHOUT EVEN A SMALL HARD
   DRIVE IS HELL. PLEASE KEEP THIS IN MIND FOR THE 1200 STRATEGY.
   FLOPPY-ONLY SYSTEMS JUST AREN'T TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY COMPUTER
   SHOPPERS. (OFF SOAP BOX)

jcompton: Hmm.  That means it's my turn.
CEI-Alex: Jason, I do not know who got the floor sweeper.
jcompton: Ok, Alex, two parts since it's my last shot of the night.  1...
jcompton: Are there any major (or, hell, even minor) US electronics/
   computer retailers that you've got interested?  Software, Etc. was ready
   to sell CD32s, so I was told by employees, but then C= blew up...
   places like that seem fairly important...
CEI-Alex: Jason, all kidding aside, I have been working on opening up
   new avenues for the Amigas.  An agreement is in place to sell CD32s
   in 12,000 outlets if we are succesful.
DeckApe: Drool.
hazy: Comment: Many deals were made to get Amiga into new markets.
   Ali managed to kill them all. THERE IS A MARKET!

jcompton: 2.  As for the operating system:  When we talked last week,
   you fairly enigmatically mentioned "AmigaDOS 5.0", and the chance of
   an outside OS...so what, exactly, does all of that mean?
CEI-Alex: As for question number 2, we need to move the operating
   unto new platforms... the actual name nor number are really important.
   As you know if we can implement RTG and better cross platform
   compatibility it would enhance our products.

jcompton: Followup coming:  Lots of people on Usenet want to know
   if Windows NT is under consideration.
CEI-Alex: Jason, remember I'm not an engineer. To date not to my
   knowledge. NT Not Today... Not Tommorrow, Maybe Next Time.

RLStockton: If you can say, what were the parts of the deal that CBM was
   "unable" to deliver that forced you to redo your bid? ....and will you
   come back here in 60 days or so and talk to us again?  ;-)
CEI-Alex: The Phillipine inventory remains under the possesion of the
   creditors.
CEI-Alex: Love to come back and make an announcement.
DeckApe: <We'll even buy ya the valium for the next visit! LOL!>
CEI-Alex: Thanks, I need it.

CaptnBilly: Will parts for 2000's etc. be available soon?
CEI-Alex: CEI currently has a large inventory of A2000 parts.  Call your
   local dealer and let them know.
Harv: alex, my local dealer is frank "creative" khulusi

CarmenR: Alex.... Do you have plans to/will you be able to mention the
   smash success of programs like Babylon5 and SeaQuest in your marketing?
CEI-Alex: Good question Carmen, I don't know.. We'll have to let the
   marketing types check into that.

Wizard0: Will there be faster version of the A4000 released?  25Mhz just
   doesn't cut it.  (I'd also like to buy a cheap and fast new cpu card :)
   Also, is networking built into 3.2?
KenD: Comment: Maybe CEI should license the Warp Engine. They rock. :)
CEI-Alex: It makes sense to introduce a number of faster versions of the
   A4000.... First the 40Mhz followed by a 68060 when it becomes available.
   3.2 does not have networking built in.  We fully understand the
   importance of networking and plan to persue those avenues unlike C=.

Dsx: -- 1.  From your perspective, please name say 3 pros and cons for
   CEI's involvement over C= UK...and...  -- 2. (last question) If you were
   *JUST* an amiga enthusiast in the US, who would you prefer getting it
   CEI or C=UK? And Why?
CEI-Alex: THAT'S A LOADED QUESTION.....
Dsx: Thanks.
Harv: DSX - #2 SHOULD BE OBVIOUS. C=UK HAS FLATLY STATED THEIR PLANS
   TO CONCENTRATE ON THE UK MARKET FIRST AND FOREMOST.
CEI-Alex: When wearing a politician hat I cannot make negative comments
   about our competition.... but I can tell you that we have developed a
   market. in the past few years, I understand the mistakes of C= and
   understand the Power of the Amiga.  I not only sell the computers, I
   use them too!
DeckApe: "I'm not only the Hair Club President, I'm a client too" (sorry)
hazy: Comment: The last C= manager known to use an Amiga at all was
   Henri Rubin, who was replaced by Bill Sydnes. Strangely enough, the
   problems started around then...
Harv: (I remember an interview in MicroTimes with former C= President Tom
     Rattigan wherein he proudly said "I don't even have a computer in my
     office.")
CEI-Alex: If CEI is succesful I can assure you that the US market will not
   be ignored.  I firmly believe that you must be succesful in the market
   to be sucessful in the world.

dtiberio: Will you OEM future Amiga motherboards? You didn't answer
   last time :)... Second, what is your relationship with Paravision as far
   as the bid goes?
CEI-Alex: Yes, motherboard will be available through an OEM program....
DeckApe: YES!
CEI-Alex: In regards to Paravision we do not have a bid relationship
   with them... we simply purchase and distribute their products.

Dale - Cozort: Do the liquidators appear to have any concept of how
   much the last five months has decreased the value of what they
   are trying to sell?  Is there any sense of urgency on their parts?
CEI-Alex: IMHO No,No.  Remember, they have no interest in the Amiga
   or its users, only paperwork.


jcompton: That does it.

RLStockton: Alex: We hope to talk to you here in a few weeks with good
   news for all of us. Thanks again for your time.
dtiberio: Will you hire Dan Barrett to do your print ads?!
Harv: ALEX.. WE CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR GIVING US TWO HOURS OF
   YOU VALUABLE TIME.
jcompton: I'd like to personally thank everyone for coming...particularly
   Alex Amor, for flagrantly violating his bedtime to be here with us
   answering slews of questions...

Harv: --------------------END OF FORMAL CHAT MODE------------------

[For those of you who made it this far, you may enjoy the bathroom break,
edited out of the main body of the conference:]


CEI-Alex: One Second PLEASE...Nature Calls!!! :)
Harv:                       [BRIEF INTERMISSION]
Izzy: HoooT!  HoooT!
DeckApe: WIZZ BREAK!!!
PKB: good info!!!!
jcompton: I'll join Alex in the virtual men's room...
Harv:                       [BRIEF INTERMISSION]
SkyPilot: COOL STUFF!
CaptnBilly: Queque Pasa?
DeckApe: <As toilets flush worldwide!>
Izzy: Alex either gots looong arms or a computer in his bathroom!
CEI-Alex: I'm quick..............:)

%% Pyramid Swifty Mouse Review                  By: @{" Jason Compton " link P8-1}     %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Well, an overview, really.  It's tough to drive a mouse into the ground
enough to review it fully (unless it's a Commodore mouse, in which case it
takes a month or so)...

These mice last longer.  Actually, even if the brand name is unfamiliar,
you may very well own one of these models...the style is white, glossy
plastic with a two or three button configuration (this one is three),
and the entire top is rather gently curved.  Some models (not this one)
have an Atari/Amiga switch, if you're still an ST type of person.

The major points to make?  The mouse works.  Rather well, really...the
resolution is fairly high and the response is great.  I have used the
two-button make for over a year without complaint, and this three-button
version promises to be more of the same.

The mouse is worth the purchase for the packaging alone...it originates
in Taiwan, and is clearly the product of non-English speakers doing
blind translation...hence the inspirational quote on the bottom of the
box, informing us "A detecting mind never rests,/It's not unlike a finely
tuned musical instruments;/It demands attention, practice." [sic]

Not even Micro R+D, the distributors, know what they're talking about.

Of course, the third button is useless until you arm yourself with a
commodity to take advantage of it, but they're numerous.  No problems
there.

The upshot: For less than $25, this is as good of a mouse as you're
going to get.

%% Body Blows AGA Review                            @{" Jason Compton " link P8-1}     %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Team 17's beat-em-up classic, Body Blows, has seen several sequels and
been received very differently in all incarnations.  Always, the obvious
comparison was between this game and arcade Street Fighter 2, and it
didn't always measure up in reviewers' opinions.

Oh, did I mention that this game is a budget re-release?

Anyway...Team 17 is a pretty well known developer in the Amiga game world,
and they've recently come under fire on Usenet over the bane of the Amiga
user: Hard drive installability.  It seems that a lot of games are made
intended for what must be interpreted as the archtypical Amiga user...the
A500/1 meg owner.

Now, I don't know about everyone else, but I was an A500/1 meg owner for
about 2 months and I decided I couldn't take it anymore, so I got more
memory, then a HD, then a more powerful computer, and so on...

But back to the story: Martyn Brown has been doing a lot of defending
Team 17's classics like Alien Breed for their hard drive unfriendliness.
Apparently, as a concurrent sign of good faith, Body Blows AGA is fully
hard drive installable!

And not just measly hard drive installability.  It's so compliant and
nice that it plays off of a ParNetted hard drive partition.  Now that's
hard drive installability.

Want another bonus?  It plays in NTSC (well, pretty much, anyway) as well
as PAL (play it in PAL at all costs: I'll explain why later...)

Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?  Yeah, it is.

I'm not a huge huge fan of the beat-em-up genre...after all, there's only
so much depth to it...and it often breeds bad feelings between friends.
So, if you're going to hurt interpersonal relations, you'd better do it
with a good game.

Body Blows AGA is a good game.  The backdrops are rather nice (not
exquisitely beautiful, but good enough), and the characters look cartoony
yet deadly.  All the trappings of SF 2.

PAL/NTSC it is...but you lose a few pixel lines at the bottom of the
screen in NTSC, and the game runs faster.  And the game runs plenty fast
enough...the computer often beats the hell out of you easy enough in PAL,
so only go NTSC if you think you're the Body Blows king.

I'm a bit disappointed in the lack of CD32 joypad support in this game.
While most of the moves are decent enough with a joystick..."Smoke if you
got 'em", as the phrase goes, and I hope the rest of my SX-1 compatriots
get mad as well.  But, a joystick works fairly well, even if you do whip
it around a bit more than you might like.  It's a game about desperate
acts, after all.

T17 brought over a few goodies from later Body Blows games, particularly
Tag Team mode, which prolongs the agony for much, much longer...

The manual could do with a bit of work, if just to make it look a bit less
harsh (black lettering on white glossy paper), but for UKP 14, BBAGA is
nothing to pass up, if you enjoy electric sadism.

%% Review: Meeting Pearls CD-ROM Volume 1      By: @{" Jason Compton " link P8-1}      %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

It's charming, in its own way...a group of Amiga enthusiasts get together
to fill a huge hard drive with stuff.  Amiga stuff, of course.  Neat
things, useful things, useless things...pretty much up to the discretion
of those present.  A big party of sorts.

The object: This CD-ROM.  A "sharecompilation", which is a bit of a
strange concept.  The upshot is that all of the material on the CD-ROM
is free, or at the most shareware.  As such, a minimal fee should be
charged for the CD-ROM itself.

This one comes in at US$13.  To put it into perspective, most new audio
CD releases are about US$15 or $16.  This puts MP into just about
everyone's price range.

That being established, the only question is this: is the compilation
worth it?

I feel it is.  It's no Aminet CD-ROM.  I personally feel that the
inclusion of Mosaic pages was a bit awkward, and some software doesn't
quite seem to run correctly direct from CD.  But there are pearls to
be had by everyone, and Angela Schmidt's pals have done a pretty good
job of filling a CD-ROM.

Quite a bit of recent Aminet software found its way here, so for some,
this will be sufficient.  For die-hard completists, a more cohesive
collection would be in order.  But if you want to get your feet wet
with Amiga CD-ROM, or just have a few bucks to blow and like searching
for treasure, pick up a Meeting Pearls.

Come on...I mean, fractals, fonts, and NetBSD, all on one disc?  Can't
beat that for less than $20.

Suggested price: DM 19,80/US $13

@node P1-7 "Using XPK Compression"
@toc "menu"
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Using XPK Compression                     By: @{" David Tiberio " link P8-4}        %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

XPK is a compression program that stores files using a variety of methods,
including compressors such as NUKE, PowerPacker, and Imploder. While in
many ways similar, the advantage to XPK is that it supports more file
formats than other compressors, due to plug in modules (shared libraries)
that are written for XPK to use. If you are using Imploder or PowerPacker,
you should have no problem switching to the more flexible XPK.

But before going into the nitty gritty, there is also XFH, which is vital
for fluid OS integration. XFH allows the OS to use compressed files in
realtime, in the same way that PPLoadSeg works by modifying the LoadSeg
routines of the OS. This means that you can compress programs, C commands,
libraries, fonts, etc, and have them decompress to memory with using drive
space or manual decompression.

XFH requires XPK to perform its wizardry. The only drawback is that XFH
will produce a second icon for every icon in a compressed file system.
This allows you to access your partition's compressed files, as well as
access them transparently. In other words, they will appear as though
they are not compressed when in fact they really are.

Let's say we set DH0: as a compressing partition. We can select
individual files to be compressed using XPK, or we can ask XFH to
compress every file copied to that partition through XDH0:. Now,
if we list a compressed file in DH0:, it will show the smaller file
size, but it will not be accessible since it is a compressed archive.
But if we list a compressed file in XDH0:, it will not appear compressed,
and will show the original file size, although it really is compressed!
Access will be slightly slower, and some directory listings may not be
fully accurate (according to my tests), but it does work rather well.

Now XPK is going to look in its list of libraries for the correct
compressions or decompression method. If you have powerpacked or
imploded files, make sure you get those libraries. If you want to use
native XPK formats, NUKE is the most versatile format, even when
compared to powerpacker and imploder. There are also encryption
mthods such as IDEA, and optimized audio compression such as SQUASH,
which performs better compression on audio samples, music mods, and
other audio, than most other compressors.

XPK can be controlled using programs such as DirOpus (see my article
in an earlier Amiga Report which discusses how to set custom buttons
from DirOpus). All I do is click on a file or list of files from Opus
and select XPK to compress or XUP to decompress them. But recently I
purchased a new hard drive, so I am now decompressing most of my files
in order to gain more speed. But when my last 50 megs is used up, I
will surely revert back to XPK, even on my 16mhz 68030, which has decent
performance. A 68040 will surely have excellent performance.

%% Review: DirWork 2                                By: @{" Jason Compton " link P8-1} %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Please, indulge me in a bit of storytelling.

Back when I first became an Amiga user, years ago, my BBS handle was "The
Diskmaster."  After a few months with a 500, I found out about a program
named "DiskMaster".  Cute...so I finally saw a copy running.  Yeah, it
was nice, but nothing I really needed on my 500/1 meg...so I left it at
that.

As I added memory and a hard drive, it began to look like a nice idea. So,
I checked out a ShareWare offering called DirWork.  Rather nice and
configurable.  So I used it.

Eventually, Chris Hames, (author of other favorites like PC-Task and
Degrader) went commercial with DirWork, Version 2.0.

To say that I'm pleased is a bit too easy, but I'll say it.

I'm pleased.

DirWork 2 comes in a fairly unassuming grey box, with a spiral-bound
manual and the DirWork goods on disk.  Run the standard Installer,
pick whether or not you want ARexx and optional configurations and the
like, and you're jammin'.

At its heart, it's still DirWork as you knew it...on the surface.
However, to say that it is much more configurable would be like saying
that a Warp Engine is faster than a 1000.

Hames provides a pack of configurations, ranging from a modern DirWork
look, to the DirWork 1.62 look, to a DiskMaster look (named Tall, but I
know better)...to a clown.

Yep, and there's more.  Examples are included to illustrate how DW can be
used as a dock-station or a simple information tool or a Genlock
controller.  an

Oh yes, DirWork is nice.  Hames has also thrown in a MOD player for good
measure, meaning DW is that much closer to "Ultimate-Stand-Alone-Utility"
status.

But nothing's perfect.

DW has retained built-in recognition of PowerPacked files, but for some
reason has not extended that to XPK-compression, which is disappointing.
Basically, that means I'm sticking with MultiPlayer for my mods.

My second concern is with the configuration editor...Hames has done a
very good job of simplifying what was once a rather intimidating config
editor and turned it into something that's simply overwhelming.  However,
this is greatly tempered by the included sample configurations, so anybody
serious about messing with DW's look can get a good feel for the system
by examining the provided examples.

I'm happy.  DW has been and will remain an important part of assembling
Amiga Report, in keeping my files and notes organized and in ready reach.
It's a worthy offering from a wonderfully prolific Amigan.

[DISCLAIMER:  Michael speaks about Commodore UK and David Pleasance as
though they have successfully bought out the Amiga.  They have NOT, and
he should not be interpreted as such.  -Ed]

Here I am, back with some more news from good 'ole Germany.

First of all I ought to apologize for being so quiet for the last couple
of weeks, but I was busy finishing of my first music video (I gained lots
of experience, and made no money...  ;-).  I also managed to get one of the
last A4000/30's for a really decent price, so now I am happily hacking away
on my AGA machine.

So, Mike, tell me what's happening.
-----------------------------------

CBM Germany has been liquidated this week, which is a shame because it
means that Dr.  P.  Kittel is no more for the german comunity.  (Dr.
Kittel has been in charge of german translatiosn, customer support and
more.  He's been with CBM for a long time, and could always be found on the
net as a helpful fairy for Amigans in need.)

The Cyberstorm board by AS&S has begun to ship (so far the 68040 version
only, I expect to get my hands on one soon), programming guidelines to
optimize performance on a 68060 have been released also.  This ought to do
it until Amiga Int.  releases the RISC specs for the next generation
Amigas.

Back to Amiga Int.  then (This is D.  Pleasance's Amiga Int I am talking
about).  He seems to be comitted to continuing the Amiga line of computers,
but some of his comments have been the cause for some worries.

He stated that he plans to can the AAA chip set because it would take 18
months (with increased man power) to port the OS to support it.

On the other hand he expects to ship first RISC Amigas to developers within
6 months of his succesful takeover.

So, are these famed RISC Amigas real Amigas then ?  Is it possible to port
Amiga OS to a RISC environment within 6 months (If it would take 18 months
to do AAA support) ?

The speculations for these RISC Amigas are going towards a Windows-NT
machine with PCI bus system.  I just wonder why I should buy an Amiga then,
I might just as well get one of those PowerPC clones that will be coming
out soon (Motorola has just announced two PowerPC board designs with PCI
for a very reasonable price).

Others say that the new Amigas will have a more powerful graphics chip set
based on a RISC, that also allows for realtime 3D shading.

I guess only time can tell us what Mr.  Pleasance is really up to.  One
thing is for sure though, I don't really care for Amigas without Amiga OS.


As I hinted above, it is very difficult to get A4000's now, they seem to be
all sold out.  It looks like everybody who makes money on Amigas stockpiled
them.  You can still find some dealers that have A4000's, but they sell
them for ridiculous prices.

Especially A4000/030's are wanted, I guess this has something to do with
the release of the Cyberstorm.  Mr.  Pleasance better get his factory up
and running soon, there is a high demand on the market (...  and don't
forget Christmas).


Oh, one last note.  I just read an article in german magazine concerning
new types of RAM Chips that can actually keep up with modern processors:
EDRAM (Enhanced DRAM), SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM), CDRAM (Cached DRAM) and
RDRAM (Rambus DRAM).  EDRAM for example allows for 2-1-1-1 bursts on a
cache hit (33 MHz bus, 3-1-1-1 burst on a cache miss), and costs around the
same as 16MB of conventional DRAM + 256K second level cache.  The other
systems allow for a similar performance, EDRAM however is supposed to be
the simplest to adapt current designs to.

Isn't this the kind of inovation that could make Amigas more attractive
(Can you imagine next generation Amigas with 15ns RAMs ?).  Just a thought.


This is it for today.  My next article will be a bit longer and cover the
Cyberstorm 040 board and (hopefully) the Photokina exhibition in Cologne
(our counterpart to the NAB exhibition).

And the motto for today is:

"May you live long and prosper."

The World Amiga Union is a no-profit hobbyist's organisation for Amiga
enthusiasts. Founded in September 1994, the Union attempts to maintain the
high moral of the Amiga users, as well as stopping Amiga piracy, encourage
more people to support cheap PublicDomain/ShareWare software, and possibly
influence future developing of the Amiga technology.
   Everyone with an interest is welcome to join the union as a 'coordinator'
in his/her own country or state. Please read the file WAU_Constitution.txt
for more information about the technical details of the WAU.
   One of the most important missions the WAU has taken upon itself is to
maintain the moral of the Amiga users, make the bonds even stronger than
they are, and support what Jay Miner, sometimes called 'the Father of the
Amiga', thought would be good for this computer and its users. Jay Miner,
who sadly passed away on June 20, 1994 in El Camino Hospital, California,
was the one who ensured that the A500 was shipped with 512k RAM instead of
the 256k Commodore would have chosen, and who is responsible for the high
moral that exists among the Amiga users today. WAU attempts to maintain this
high degree of self-confidence that exists among the Amiga users today, but
is threatened to falter due to the recent economical problems at Commodore.
   The WAU will also attempt to gain the population of the Amiga community
by providing information to anyone that is willing to accept a standards
change. This does NOT mean damaging the sales of any other company in any
direct way, such as false propaganda and cheating of customers, but to
provide facts about the system.

         World Amiga Union Constitution
         ------------------------------


#1. The World Amiga Union is open for everyone that agrees to the paragraphs
    in this document. To accomplish a change in the constitution, write to
    the address below and the matter will be discussed.
#2. The World Amiga Union and everyone therein shall care for that the Amiga
    community holds together and maintains a high internal moral.
#3. The World Amiga Union is against all acts of piracy, as this is driving
    away the developers. Any act of piracy will be reported to authorities.
#4. As long as it is capable of keeping business going, Commodore will be
    the company supported by the World Amiga Union. If Commodore is not
    capable of producing and selling Amigas, the World Amiga Union must act.
    In case that this happens, a crisis situation will be announced and the
    World Amiga Union will attempt to find a suitable company to produce the
    Amiga range of computers. At the moment, though, the World Amiga Union
    supports Commodore and hopes that they will accomplish their task.
#5. The World Amiga Union is a no-profit organisation driven by the members.
    This means the more we work, the more we can accomplish.

That was the area code list in its first form. Later, when errors are
corrected, every city in every country will get an individual number:

               A:B/C/D

A and B are specified above. C is a number for each state in each country
and D is for each city and town. This cannot be accomplished with very much
help. So if you live in any other country except Finland, please send in an
area list for your country. Make it as complete as possible, following the
format described above (A:B/C/D).
   I'm certain that this list isn't exactly error-free, so if you find an
error in it, please tell me! Also, you might find that your country is
missing from the list. If so, inform me immediately!
   What is the list good for, then? Well, firstly it provides me with an
easy way to book users and maintain the WAU database. Secondly, it gives us
all a quick and easy way of telling exactly where on the globe we are. There
are only two bad things with it, firstly it's a hell of a job to do a
complete list of every city in the world, and secondly, it only covers a
fraction of the galaxy...

   And just in case you didn't get the message: I NEED HELP. There's no way
I could make the complete list with VERY much help from people around
everywhere. So please make a list of your own country and mail it to me. I'm
doing Finland, so don't worry about that, but any other country is fine,
just notify me so no one has to do unneccesary work.

    Becoming a member of the World Amiga Union
    ------------------------------------------


There are three main types of members in the WAU. In this document we will
go through them one by one and you can see for yourself which suits you
best.

-1. Inactive member.
      Everyone in the whole world that owns an Amiga is an inactive WAU
member. You don't need to do anything to join the WAU at this level. You can
state that you belong to the WAU, and you can send in a member form and be
added to the WAU database. You can participate in all WAU meetings (held on
FidoNet and Internet newsgroups) and you can affect the way the WAU works by
sending a letter to me. At any time, you may remove your record from the WAU
database by sending a letter to me stating that you wish to be removed.

-2. Active member.
      When you send in your member form and get added to the WAU database,
stating that you wish to become an active member, you will receive the
latest news updates from the WAU with your welcome letter. As an active
member, you have the right to start pro-Amiga-petitions and campaigns in the
name of the WAU. You must, however send a letter informing that this is your
intention at least two (2) weeks before the petition starts. Your ideas will
also be listened to more carefully than to those of an inactive member,
since you prove that you're willing to give more of your time to the WAU.

-3. WAU Coordinator.
      A coordinator's mission is to spread public WAU texts and information
is his/her area. A coordinator may appoint subcoordinators in his country,
which will be given an area of their own to maintain. A coordinator must
answer to questions asked by intersted people. This might sound like a very
difficult and heavy job, but you are not required to do anything else than
spread the public WAU texts to local BBSs and local network echoes. As a
coordinator, your mission is also to collect names and letters in WAU world-
wide petitions. (The only thing you need to do here is again to spread the
petition announcement and to receive letters from the parttakers in your
area, then forward them to me.) A coordinator must have access to either the
FidoNet, or preferrably Internet/UseNet. A coordinator must also be able to
UUEncode/Decode binary files for mail transfer.


You are not required to do anything as a inactive or active member, but as a
coordinator, you have to perform certain duties, as described above.
However, it is completely up to you how much time you give this membership.
If you are a coordinator your minimum duty is to receive and spread the
public texts that will be mailed to you through netmail. If you wish, you
can translate the English texts into your country's language.

   Note that being a member with 'lower status' does NOT mean you are less
worth than another member. These types exist only because we need to
distinguish between a member who is eager to participate and a member who
just wants to hang on without doing very much work.

All updated userlists, area codes, information and announcements will be
posted to several newsgroups in the Internet/UseNet and FidoNet. Also, they
will be spread as text files through some file networks, but this is still
unclear. If you don't have access to any of these newsgroups, mail me and
tell me which network you have access to, and I'll see what I can do.
Otherwise you'll have to wait for each message to reach your BBS through
file networks and by user-to-user spreading.

%% 68060 Upgrade Software Guide                      By: Ralph Schmidt  %%
%% Tips and tricks for speedsters...            laire@uni-paderborn.de  %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

0) Advanced System & Software will sell the first 060 accelerator,
   namely the Cyberstorm 060, rather soon and wants to achieve a smooth
   integration into the Amiga.
   Therefore we hope that software companys and pd programmers
   will adopt their software to deal with the 68060.

1) Inststructions supported by the 68040 but not by the 68060 directly that
   can hurt performance:

 o divx.l (64bit divide)
 o mulx.l (64bit multiply)
 o fdbcc
 o fscc
 o movep
 o There are other instructions that are not supported or have to
   be emulated but these aren't relevant for user applications.

2) Instructions supported by the 68060 in hardware that are emulated on
   the 68040:

 o fint
 o fintrz

3) Emulation limitations

The emulation can't reliably emulate unsupported instructions
that access the (ssp) in a way that it contradicts the basic
definition of a stack. (ssp)=sp in supervisor mode.
I don't think anybody is using such constructs in his software
but I want to mention it to stop anybody from using these:

div{u,s}.l              -(ssp),dr:dq
mul{u,s}.l              -(ssp),dr:dq
f<op>.p                 -(ssp),fpn
f<op>.p                 fpn,(ssp)+
f<op>.{b,w,l,s,d,x}     -(ssp),fpn
fs<cc>.b                -(ssp)
fmovem.x                -(ssp),dn
fmovem.x                dn,(ssp)+
f<op>.x                 fpn,(ssp)+      ;Underflow,SNAN exception
f<op>.{b,w,l}           fpn,(ssp)+      ;Enabled OPERR



4) Other software problems.

  o Don't use Aztec C.
    It is not compatible with the 68060.
    Popular applications with this problem: CED 2.02,CED 3.5,Mand2000D
    *I fixed this by patching Supervisor()*,
    so don't worry about your programs but
    don't use it in future software if possible.

    Here's the bad Code:

        btst.b  #4,$129(a6)             ;check for 68881 flag in AttnFlags
        beq     1$                      ;skip if not
        lea     2$,a5
        jsr     -30(a6)                 ;do it in supervisor mode
        bra     1$
    2$
        clr.l   -(sp)
        frestore (sp)+                  ;reset the ffp stuff
    ;The 68060 FRestore stackframe is 12 bytes long but it only created
    ;a NULL frame with the size of 4 Bytes so the Stack is wrong afterwards.
    ;RTE->jump into unknown regions...crash
        rte                             ;and return

5) New Stackframe format

   These informations are only interesting for Debugger programmers
   and kernel hackers.

   o 3-Byte in the 1st Longword = 0 then NULL Stackframe.
     xxxx00xx   ;1st Longword of the FPU stackframe
     xxxxxxxx   ;2nd Longword of the FPU stackframe
     xxxxxxxx   ;3rd Longword of the FPU stackframe
     xxxxxxxx   ;PC
     xxxx       ;SR
     d0-a6      ;Registers


   o 3-Byte in the 1st Longword !=0 then BUSY Stackframe.
     ffffffff   ;Busy Fake Longword
     xxxxxxxx   ;FPCR
     xxxxxxxx   ;FPSR
     xxxxxxxx   ;FPIAR
     fp0-fp7    ;FPU Registers
     xxxxxxxx   ;1st Longword of the FPU stackframe
     xxxxxxxx   ;2nd Longword of the FPU stackframe
     xxxxxxxx   ;3rd Longword of the FPU stackframe
     xxxxxxxx   ;PC
     xxxx       ;SR
     d0-a6      ;Registers


6) MMU Table differences

   The 68040 and 68060 mmu tables are almost the same but there is
   an important difference. For the 68060 the MMU-Tables have to
   be placed into non-cached ram!!!!!!!
   So if you manipulate the mmu-table you have to mark the pages
   with your added tables as non-cacheable.
   Another difference is that the Cyberstorm software uses the
   area $ffff8000-$ffffffff for itself.
   You are NOT allowed to change the mmu-table that this area
   is touched in any way. This can lead to serious crashes.


7) Barfly 1.09 is the first Assembler/Debugger that supports the
   68060. It can be found on aminet:dev/asm/barfly1_09.lha

  Deluxe Pain IV has proved to be extremely popular, due to the unique features
only Electronic Farts gives you. Now Deluxe Pain V gives you even better
features, and even more enjoyment. Here are just some of the incredible things
you can find in DPV:

- New real world pens
  Earlier versions had limited modes, such as Smear, which covered your body
with your own blood, and Blender, which cut parts of your body into really
small pieces. Now you also have several real world pens, all of which can
enter your body in surprisingly painful ways. In addition you get sharpened
pencils, to be thrust into even more unsuspecting body parts. The new Chalk
mode sprays chalk into your eyes. This way you won't see where the pencils
are going to enter your body, and will be even more pleasantly surprised.

- Improved Cut and Taste
  With DPV you are no longer limited to cutting your body into the same boring
shapes. With the new and improved Cut and Taste, you can carve any part of
your body into any original shape that you like, then cut it and put it into
your mouth, for full enjoyment.

- Improved Spray Gun
  Now you can also decide the centre of the spray, and what size of bullets
will be used.

- Much much more

  We are sure that all our trusted customers will get out of their hospital
beds and rush to buy Deluxe Pain V.

TITLE:
    DoAllData

VERSION:
    1.01

AUTHOR:
    Sven Dickert (s_dickert@ira.uka.de)

DESCRIPTION:
    DoAllData (short DAD) will allow for comfortable handling of
    all sorts of data.  It establishes an AppIcon on the
    Workbench and any icon that you put on this AppIcon
    (drag-and-drop) will force the start of the viewing-,
    playing-, unpacking or any other action that can process the
    icon's data type.  With version 1.01 you can define a logfile
    that you may use as standalone-script.  DAD runs executables
    without suffixes.

FUTURE
    None, if no one pays the shareware fee.

    * comfortable way to set the icon's position on WB
    * DAD will work with magicnumbers instead of suffixes,
      so DAD will cover more datatypes.
    * launching scriptfiles
    * own editor for the tooltypes, so DAD will run with 2.04
      in a better way.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
    * at least Kick & WB 2.04, it works best with 3.0 up

TITLE

  CFX - the Crunched File eXaminer


VERSION

  5.533 - New worldwide OS2+ release


AUTHOR

  Bob Rye (bob@miggins.apana.org.au)


DESCRIPTION

  CFX is *the* filetype analyser for the Amiga. Developed over
  a period of 4+ years, CFX currently can identify literally
  hundreds of Amiga (and other platform) filetypes. You can
  for instance ask CFX to list all of the executable files on
  your entire harddrive, or maybe only *.lha archives.
  Whatever. CFX acts and runs just like a larger, and more
  intelligent "Dir" or "List" replacement, but is so much more
  useful. Don't let the title "Crunched File eXaminer" fool
  you: this isn't just for crunched files.


HOST NAME

  CFX should be available on all Aminet sites

  For Example :

   Scandinavia  ftp.luth.se            130.240.16.3

     33615 Bielefeld
     Germany

     email: torstenk@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de

DESCRIPTION

     ASpringies is a simulator which allows you to interactively create and
     edit a system of masses and springs.  The parameters of the masses and
     springs (such as mass elasticity and spring K) as well as those of the
     surrounding system (such as air viscosity and gravity) can be changed.
     These systems can be loaded and saved into a file.

     I guess you could use ASpringies for real work, but it's really
     intended to be a time waster.

     ASpringies is the Amiga port of the program 'xspringies' by Douglas
     DeCarlo.

     Features:
       - Smooth, double buffered animation
       - Context sensitive hypertext help system
       - MUI (Magic User Interface)
       - includes source code

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     - Kickstart V37 (2.0) or above
     - MUI (Magic User Interface, version 2.2 or above)
     - A Floting Point Coprocessor (FPU), or standard 68040 and above

    AmigaNet: 39:157/101.15
    NLA:      14:105/2.15

DESCRIPTION

    `phonebill' is, simply said, a log file analyzer. What it basically
    does is scan log file(s) generated by a terminal program or a mailer,
    extract all information about calls you have made by using your modem,
    and store this in its own (short) format. After extracting the calls
    `phonebill' can generate various reports in which you can find
    information on duration and costs of the calls.

    Here is a small list of the main features:

     * Very flexible user-configurable rates, supporting exceptions for
       certain days and dates. Handles fees and time units with up to 9
       decimals (e.g. $1.2344657 dollars per 30.225678 seconds).

     * User-configurable log scanners: `phonebill' by default supports
       various log files, but for any log file that is not supported the
       user is able to create a scanner. The following is a list of log
       files that are already supported:
          * AutoPilot
          * CyberPager
          * GPFax
          * JrComm
          * MagiCall
          * MicroDot
          * Multifax (both v2.0 and Multifax professional)
          * NComm
          * Term action log and Term call log
          * Terminus
          * TheAnswer
          * TKR-BTX
          * Trapdoor
          * Trapfax
          * UUCP TimeLog

     * Log files can be automatically truncated if their size exceeds the
       maximum size.

     * Generates miscellaneous reports: statistics, total costs, ....

     * Context-sensitive online help.

     * Requires Kickstart 2.04 or higher.

     * Supports new 3.0 features (new look menus, ...).

     * Nice `Amiga User Interface Style Guide' conformant user interface.

NEW FEATURES

    The following is a list of the most significant changes:

     * Localized.

     * Moved from built-in scanners to user-configurable scanners. The
       only built-in scanner left is `GPFax' (which is binary log file).

     * Improved the rates: extended the limit of 4 decimals for units and
       seconds to 9, support for different rates in different time
       periods, you can enter more than one date in a date exception by
       seperating them using a `|' character, first and second unit have
       made place for a listview in which you can configure as much units
       as you wish.

     * You can set a different carrier detect time for each host, or use
       the default carrier detect time as desired.

     * Support for hosts with more than one phone number by seperating
       the numbers using a `|' character.

     * New user-interface featuring `gtlayout.library' by Olaf `Olsen'
       Barthel. I found this the best compromise between a plain and fast
       gui like the old `phonebill', and a slow but very configurable gui
       like `MUI'.

    Workbench 2.04 or higher.

     Colonial Conquest II

VERSION

     1.00

COMPANY

     None

AUTHOR

     Christian Mumenthaler
     mumi@mol.biol.ethz.ch

DESCRIPTION

     Colonial Conquest II is a complex space strategy game for one or two
     persons.  The aim of each player is to colonialize a maximum of the 26
     earth-like planets that are shown on the universe map.  Every planet
     has its own surface composed of oceans, forests, mountains, deserts
     etc where different machines (power-plants, irrigation robots, space
     port etc) have to be built to guarantee a rapid grow and a high
     production of the colony.  People can direct the machines or work as
     scientists which will make the technology level rise and allow new
     inventions (battlestars, planet scanners, energy cannons etc).  Each
     player will have to explore the universe, build war ships for space
     battles and troop transporters for the invasions of other worlds.  The
     game is easy to handle as it has an intuitive, mouse-based interface.
     It also has decent graphics with some rendered HAM images.

NEW FEATURES

     Colonial Conquest II is a sequel to Colonial Conquest.
     Many bugs have been removed and hundreds of details
     improved. The new and outstanding features are:

     - Intelligent computer opponent.
       In the one player mode, the computer will simulate a
       highly aggressive alien race that colonizes planets,
       explores the universe, performs coherent attacks, invades
       planets and uses the surviving population as slaves for
       a maximum material production.

     - Espionage. Spy satellites can now scan planets or view
       them from space.

     - 50 different alien life forms that can be discovered.

     - Army forces have to be constructed to defend planets or
       invade others.

     - Lots of new objects & space ships.

     - Title music, more graphics.

     - Background story.
       When playing in the two player mode, a new aim can be
       to be incorporated in a huge empire that is not interested
       in the small colonies at the begining. Empire points are
       distributed among the players for discoveries, production
       and fleet force. The first player who has reached a certain
       amount of empire points is incorporated and wins the game
       which means that the two player do not necessarly have to
       annihilate eachother.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Colonial Conquest is a PAL game, but it works on NTSC machines
     too (vertical screen scrolling). Besides this, it should work
     on ALL Amigas with MORE THAN 1MB of RAM.

     Use Left-Amiga + A to multitask.

TITLE

        MultiFileSystem - share multiple file systems under a single
                          device name

VERSION

        1.1

AUTHOR

        Nicola Salmoria  <MC6489@mclink.it>

DESCRIPTION

        Thanks to the versatility of AmigaDOS, we are able to use many
        different file systems on our disks. The most popular is of course
        CrossDOS (tm), but many other file systems can be found in the PD.
        Adding a new file system to the Amiga is simplicity itself: just
        copy a file in L:, provide a suitable mountlist, and there you go.
        This works flawlessy if every physical unit is accessed by a
        single file system, but if multiple file systems share the same
        device, some problems arise:

        - You have to call the same unit with different names (e.g. DF0:
          and PC0:) depending of the kind of disk inserted.

        - When you insert a PC disk, the Workbench shows a DF0:???? icon,
          and vice versa; this can be very annoying especially for owners
          of more than one drive.

        - When a file system is busy (for example during a DiskCopy), the
          other file systems can still access the disk; this goes against
          the concept of "inhibiting" a device.


        MultiFileSystem solves all of these problems. It isn't a file
        system in the usual way: it is an interface to other file systems.
        When you mount it, you tell it which file systems it should use;
        afterwards, when a disk is inserted, MultiFileSystem will
        recognize it and pass the commands to the appropriate file system.
        This means that with a single device name, for example DF0:, you
        can access any conceivable file system!

        You are not limited to floppy drives, of course: I successfully
        installed MultiFileSystem over a 128Mb magnetooptical drive.

NEW FEATURES

        Fixed all reported bugs. It seems that version 1.0 didn't work
        with the Mount command supplied with Workbench 2.1. This
        incompatibility has been removed so version 1.1 should work on
        all systems starting from Workbench 2.1 upwards.

        New DiskCopy and Format patches, which make operations easier:
        DiskCopy automatically picks the correct file system on the
        destination disk; Format shows a requester asking the user to
        choose which file system to use.

     Email: ecarroll@maths.tcd.ie
            ecarroll@cix.compulink.co.uk

DESCRIPTION

     SnoopDos patches a variety of AmigaDOS library functions that
     are commonly called by other programs and allows you to monitor
     the activities carried out by those programs.

     For example, you can see what files a program is looking for,
     what fonts it opens, and any special libraries or devices that
     it requires. This is often invaluable when you are trying to
     install a new application which has complex or inadequate
     documentation

NEW FEATURES

     Many features have been added to SnoopDos since version 1.7.
     Here's a brief list of the most important additions:

       o  Over 20 new system functions are supported
       o  A full GUI provides easy access to all options
       o  The output format can be customised using a new format editor
       o  Output that scrolls off the window can be recalled
       o  Messages sent by ARexx scripts can be monitored
       o  Commodity support lets SnoopDos run in the background
       o  Clipboard support lets you cut and paste output
       o  Programs that use ixemul.library for i/o can be monitored
       o0 A packet debugger lets programmers monitor all DOS packets
       o  Over 100 ARexx commands provide for unattended operation
       o  Online AmigaGuide help covers all aspects of operation

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Kickstart 2.04 or above is required.

     Some new features work better if the debugging utilities Sushi
     and SegTracker are installed, but these are not essential.

PROGRAM SECURITY

     Several bogus versions of SnoopDos have appeared in the past
     two years. These have been disguised as legitimate updates while
     harbouring trojan horses or other undesirable intruders. The most
     recent such release, labelled 2.0, is still generally available.

     To help guard against this happening in the future, all new
     versions of SnoopDos will be signed using PGP (Pretty Good
     Privacy) by Philip Zimmermann. This allows anyone who is in
     possession of my PGP public key to verify that a particular
     release genuinely came from myself and not from a third party.

     PGP is not required to use SnoopDos; it merely allows you to
     verify that you have a legitimate and unmodified copy. You can
     download PGP from the /pub/aminet/util/crypt directory on
     Aminet. The filename is PGPAmiga2_3a.lha.

     My PGP public key is presented below for convenience. This key
     will work with all future releases of SnoopDos.

     If you have installed PGP, save this announcement to a file and
     then type "PGP <filename>" to install my key on your PGP keyring.
     You can then verify the integrity of SnoopDos by extracting the
     SnoopDos archive and typing "PGP Readme.first SnoopDos". See the
     PGP documentation for more ynformation on verifying signatures.

     Note that my public key is never included with the main SnoopDos
     archive -- if it was, then anyone modifying the program could
     also modify the key and escape undetected.

DESCRIPTION

     This is a new version, see below!

     When using guides for all programs, it's often confusing where the
     icon for a specfic guide is. This is asuming that you are like me and
     keep all the guides in a place specified by the env:amigaguide/path
     variable.
     It can be recommended to do this and maybe use a compressed
     partition that is optimized for text compression.
     When you have this directory, Masterguide can be put to work. It
     will scan the directory for guide's and if asked, drawers, and put
     them in one big guide. The guide itself will not be included, but
     an amigaguide-link is made.
     The MasterGuide can be made anywhere you want, the full path
     (given as an argument) will be used.
     All guides can then be called from masterguide.
     If asked, masterguide will work recursively through a directory
     structure.

NEW FEATURES

     It is now possible to give multiple path's to be searched.
     It is possible to include ASCII files too (OS3+ only).

SPECIEAL REQUIREMENTS

     Arexx and rexxsupport.library
     And for the program to be any use, some guides.

TITLE

     EditKeys

VERSION

     1.61

AUTHOR

     David Kinder

DESCRIPTION

     EditKeys allows you to edit or create keymap files
     (They are found in the Devs/Keymaps/ directory of the
     boot disk). When you press a key on the Amiga's
     keyboard, the key press is translated by the keymap
     file that the system is using. For instance, British
     Amigas use the keymap 'gb'. Different keymaps can be
     found on the system disks supplied with your Amiga.

     All aspects of a keymap can be changed with EditKeys
     to give either minor or radical alterations; you
     could e.g. redefine the numerical keypad to produce
     strings of up to 255 characters. You can define or
     remove dead keys, modifiable keys, whether keys repeat
     when held down or not, whether Caps Lock causes the
     key's output to be Shifted, etc.

NEW FEATURES

     Changes from 1.5:

     * Enforcer hit removed.
     * New 'Put Char' menu item, which allows the insertion
       of any character into the editing string. This is
       very useful when changing keys to produce characters
       that do not usually appear on keymaps (e.g. characters
       with a numeric value < 32).
     * If 'Create Icons?' selected, when saving a keymap a
       new icon will only be written if an old one does not
       exist.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Kickstart 1.2 required, Kickstart 2.04 or higher
     recommended. If running Kickstart 1.3 or lower,
     arp.library is required to be in the LIBS: directory.

DESCRIPTION

    HWGRCS is a port of GNU RCS 5.6.0.1 done with SAS/C 6.51.

    The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions
    of  files.   RCS  automates the storing, retrieval, logging,
    identification, and merging of revisions.  RCS is useful for
    text that is revised frequently, for example programs, docu-
    mentation, graphics, papers, and form letters.

    Special features:

        - File pattern and response file expansion in all RCS commands.
        - Support for .a,.ag,.asm,.fd,.guide,.i,.mod,.ps extensions.
        - GNU DIFF 2.6, GNU patch 2.1 and a N*rton like LP utility.
        - AmigaGuide. docs.
        - I try to _support_ HWGRCS (See the docs).


NEW FEATURES

    Bugs fixed since patch level 10:

    - rcsfreeze works with long logs
    - $VER$ should never again give problems with repositories


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    >=V37, >1MB suggested, HD required.

     AmiGate - FidoNet<->UUCP gating software

VERSION

     1.1

AUTHOR

     Glumsoevej 21 st.tv.
     2700 Broenshoej
     DENMARK

     email: brj@boble.ping.dk

DESCRIPTION

     Basically AmiGate will convert your UUCP news/emails into FidoNet
     echomail/netmail and the other way around. That's it.

     Short feature list:

      o Public or private gating.
      o Fully FidoNet FTS/FSC compliant.
      o Direct support for DLG user.data.
      o Mailing list -> Echomail conversion.
      o Crossposting can be ignored. (Eg. only posted to the first
        matching area.)
      o MIME-support (also for quoted-printable).
      o Will not post to moderated areas but instead send email to
        moderator.
      o FidoNet bouncing. Will inform sender if something goes wrong.
      o Optional accounting for emails.
      o Total customization of how to port the headers in UUCP
        messages.

     Even if you don't have a FidoNet address, using it together with
     Spot (a very nice FidoNet editor by Nico Francois) is a pleasing
     alternative to the mail and news readers available on the Amiga.
     (Please note that this is my personal opinion ;-)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     o Kickstart 37.175 or higher.

     o AmigaUUCP v1.17 or higher. 1.16 will work but generates dubious
       headers.
        All binaries, sources, and man pages for 1.17b4 are available
        for anonymous ftp from Hopper.ITC.Virginia.EDU:/pub/amiga and
        for BMS from adastra.cvl.va.us.

     o traplist.library version 4 or higher.
        ftp.luth.se:pub/aminet/comm/fido/TL_LIB.lzh

     o FidoNet editor/tosser of your choice. Spot recommended for
       private use.
        ftp.luth.se:pub/aminet/comm/fido/Spot13.lha

     o Probably won't be of much use without a modem.
