===========================================================================

It's been a fortnight of ups and downs-actually, downs and ups.

About a week and a half ago, unconfirmed reports started appearing that
Amiga World, one of the oldest Amiga magazines in existance, would be
ceasing publication.  And, sure enough, the reports were confirmed.  Amiga
World's April 1995 issue, already delivered to subscribers, will be the
last issue.

No goodbyes appear in the issue, because word of the cancellation came
AFTER the issue was completed.

This, of course, has sparked considerable conversation, particularly in
North America, which now only has ONE monthly Amiga print magazine-Amazing
Computing.  It also has the interesting side effect of making Amiga Report
the second-highest circulated Amiga magazine that originates in the US.
:)

But even as Amiga World dropped from the picture, new light appeared.  The
liquidator for Commodore International has selected Escom's bid for
Commodore's assets as the contract bid for the auction.  This means that,
once an auction date is set, all interested parties get together in a
building and bid on the contract until someone wins.

This, of course, is good news.  It means motion and progress for the
proceedings.

Our pledge to put out a magazine within 6 hours of a buyout confirmation
is still valid.  I will confirm it, though, with either the C=
International liquidator or the party who claims victory...and both, if I
can manage it.

Things may not be so bad after all.  Of course, they would have been
better if this had happened long ago, but you can't have everything.

Until things get even better, enjoy what we've got, which is at least a
chance in hell.

First, I wanted to thank you and all of the rest of the staff of AR for putting
out such a great online mag.  It's a pleasure to read it.  I look forward to
even more of AR (especially since Amiga World is gone)!

Now, I've got a big question for you........  I was wondering if you might
be able to supply me with an e-mail address for Alex Amor and David
Pleasance.  I would more than appreciate it if you could find those
addresses!

        Thanks very much,

-   Well, neither Amor nor Pleasance have direct e-mail addresses.
    Commodore UK can be reached as cbm@cix.compulink.co.uk, and CEI has
    asked that their e-mail address not be released publicly yet, so I'll
    pass anything you want sent to them along.

Creeping silence comes upon this land
Now my friends beware as you walk

Strange beasts hoot and grunt 
Outside the barriers of reality
As cold as nite 'tween the stars
More black than souls of the dying
We come upon the strange refuge 
Inside and out
In truth and doubt
Welcome to the Darkseid

Let me take you on a short trip back in time.  We control the vertical we
control the horizontal (unless youve got a 1084s ;) ).dedeedodoo
dedeedodoo dedeedodoo welcome to the twilight zone, the shadowy boundary
between fact and fiction, between C= and Cei, between knowledge and
guesswork.  Watch as the scene unfolds.....

We see a young boy reading his favourite magazine, the words C64 user are
clearly evident at the top of the page.  The magazine is showing the new
wonder machine, it like the C64 is built by Commodore.  But whats this it
costs almost a grand and its not C64 compatible, shock horror, fear and a
sudden realisation that it means none of his games will run.  He wont be
able to play IK, or Gauntlet, or OutRun or KnightLore or Alien8.  What
will he do now.....  Gradually the sceen fades out and time slips forward,
we see the new wonder machine evolve (shouldnt that be devolve ?  :) )
from the A1000, into the creamy 512 Amiga 500 running Workbench 1.2.  It
sold many units and became the home games machine, easily out performing
the Atari St and lesser 8bit machines.  Gradually over time it changes and
develops gaining worbench 1.3, a new model the 1500 then the 2000 business
machines then a spurt when it becomes a cd type machine, one of the first,
ahead of its time.  New and improved models followed the 3000, the fated
600 and the current wonder machines the 1200, 4000-30/40 and the cd32.

Now up to present date the picture shows a company in trouble development
of new goodies on hold.  Rumours and 'information' abound, with specs for
new machines flying about.  The Hombre Chip, The AAA chipset, Hp-Risc,
DSP, CD1200, Windows NT.  The facts indicate that when (Optimistic :) )
the new company release a new machine that it wont really be an amiga.  UH
OH.....  cue scenes of people slashing their wrists cos they cant play
Cannon Fodder on the new machines.  Anyone see the parallel here ????  (no
the new Amiga wont be a parallel processor type) Hang on, wouldnt 4 020s
with an 030 as a controller provide a boost in raw power?  anyone tell me
?  The new Amiga be it AAA or HP-Risc will probably be Multi Platform,
gasp shock etc etc.  As can be seen the Amiga Os is portable, look at the
Amiga clone...  info in a previous AR, Draco.  It doesnt use the same
hardware but bung a grahics card and you can run virtually all serious
AMI_Apps (Inc Gigamem arf arf virtual memory geddit ???  :) ).

Change is inevitable, I for one hope that the new generation machine is
ready sooner than later (Id settle for ready at all :) ).  We had a market
that basically was erroded by complacency, bad marketing (A600 what a
great idea NOT !!) and the rise of the console, and not forgetting Doom of
course Doom made the Pc viable as a games machine overnight, albeit a very
very expensive one....  We have C64/Spectrum/Amstrad/BBC/Psion emulators
on the Amiga, whilst they may not be quick they work...  The new machine
should be able to return the same results we have at the moment on the
1200 with its drastically more powerful/zippy cpu, plus 68020's dont cost
that much,so why not bung one on the motherboard as fall back, esp for the
game console variant.  And with the custom chips as a subchip on the cpu,
current Amiga stuff will very probably run....  (heres hoping).

@node NEWS5 "The Wild Week at the Commodore Liquidation"
@toc NEWS

It was truly a wild week in the Commodore liquidation proceedings.

Early Thursday, word came to me from a reliable source that Escom (the
German-based PC clone maker who has expressed interest in the Commodore
asstes) and the liquidator had reached an agreement to make their bid the
contract bid.  That contract would then be subjected to a public auction
process, at which all interested bidders would have a chance to top each
other's bids, and the highest bid would win the contract for the delivery
of Commodore's assets.

But a few hours later, it was revealed that this ALMOST happened, but was
aborted because of a bizarre set of circumstances.  Escom had instead made
a deal, two weeks earlier, with Commodore Germany's liquidator to purchase
the "C=" and "Commodore" trademarks for $1.4 million, and pulled out of
the C= International deal since they had what they truly wanted, the
trademark.

However, the International liquidator and the US courts did not feel that
Commodore Germany had the right to sell the Commodore trademark.
Furthermore, one of the remaining bidders threatened to pull out of the
International liquidation if the trademark was not part of the package.

The US judge threatened Escom and the C= Germany liquidator with legal
action.

On Friday, Escom and the Commodore International liquidator reached a new
agreement.  Essentially, their contract has now been established as the
contract bid.  If they do not obtain the Commodore assets in the
liquidation auction, they will hand the Commodore Germany trademark
over to the winners.

This is the breakdown of the details, as described by Dan Stets'
Philadelphia Inquirer article:

"Escom's contract bid is for 6 million dollars, not counting the 1.4
million they have already spent on Commodore Germany's trademark.  Escom's
offer includes $3.5 million for Commodore's core assets, an additional $1
million for its German assets, $500,000 for Dutch assets and $1 million
for the manufacturing inventory remaining in the Philippines, where
Commodore used to build its computers."

The consortiums lead by both David Pleasance of C= UK and Alex Amor of
Creative Equipment, International are expected to bid at the auction.
Other potential bidders will be notified when a date is set, which may be
as early as a month away.

At last...progress!

[Dan Stets' recent articles from the Philadelphia Inquirer and a Friday,
March 10 conversation with Franklyn R. Wilson, chief liquidator of
Commodore International, generated this report.]

==========================================================================

[No, this is not a joke or a fake, unfortunately.  -Jason]

TechMedia Publishing announced that it will cease publication of AmigaWorld as
of its April 1995 issue. The continuing impasse in the Commodore
liquidation--now in its 11th month--was cited as the primary reason. With no
firm prospects for new ownership of the Amiga, and no new Amiga technology
introduced during the past two years, the company felt it could no longer
justify publishing the magazine. Current AmigaWorld subscribers will be offered
a choice of two other IDG publications, both of which contain editorial content
relevant to the needs of Amiga users. An official letter detailing these
choices will be mailed shortly to all subscribers. First published in July 1985
to coincide with the launch of the original Amiga 1000, AmigaWorld is proud to
have covered what many believe to be the most exciting and innovative personal
computer ever developed. We thank all our many readers and supporters for their
dedication over the past decade.

Early reports indicate that current AW subscribers will be offered Amiga
Computing (Amiga Computing's publisher was recently acquired by IDG, AW's
parent) or Digital Video.

@node NEWS4 "Coleco Adam Emulator announced"
@toc NEWS

Nino Brunori - Visionary Unlimited!

    This is a preliminary technical description of the basic functions of
the ADAM computer and the Coleco/ADAM Emulator.

    February 25, 1995

    When the beta version is ready this message will be re-released to the
rest of the Amiga community.  Although this is a basic description of my
work, it still has a lot of my R&D, my intention is to excite the Amiga
community and show that the Amiga can emulate yet another cool computer
with ease and show that we are still the pioneers in the computer
mainstream, that in order to keep Amiga alive we need to develope more
versatile software and hardware.  Coleco screwed themselves, and Commodore
wasn't much better.  We need to help each other, and I need your support
in the development of this product, idea's for improvement, developement,
and BBS distribution.

    This emulator will be able to run all Coleco programs, but because of
obvious differances, hardware is simply impractical to impossible.

Here is a short breakdown of the ADAM computer.

ADAM Original (Revision 80):

8K Rom, 64K mem, 16K Video Mem
3.58 Mhz, Video 10.7 Mhz
2 160K Disk Drives, 2 256K Digital Data Drives (High Speed Tape using
specially formated cassettes), 300 Baud Modem, Serial/Parallel Card, Extra
64K Mem, Daisy Wheel Printer, Auto Dialer, Atari Emulator, 32K Max
Cartridge Software, Digital Joysticks, Digital Paddles, Special Driving
Module, Roller Controller (TrackBall), Super Action 4 Button Controller.

ADAM Description of Hardware and Emulation
------------------------------------------

Audio:        ADAM consists of 3 separate voices and 1 white noise.
              Emulation will be a step back in time for Amiga, but very
              easy to do.


Cartridges:   ADAM uses carts up to 32K, hardware restrictions forces me
              to make a backup of each cartridge and transfer them to the
              Amiga in order to use them.  Emulation for this software
              will be simple because these carts never accessed Disk
              Drives or the Keyboard.


Controllers:  The Coleco controllers are the hardest part to emulate, all
              options available are the usual up, down, left, right,
              fire 1 also fire 2, fire 3, fire 4, spinner x, spinner y,
              and a 12 digit keypad.  I have an idea as to it's emulation,
              but it's a closely guarded secret.  The Emulator will be
              able to use all Coleco Controllers, the exception with the
              Roller Controller is that the power supply runs off the
              machines with an adapter, I will supply voltage requirements
              for the controller for usage.


Clock Speed:  3.58 MHZ will be no problem.  Emulation will set timing to
              normal no matter what speed the Amiga runs at, a variable
              speed will be added to the external shell.


Drives:       Disk Drives were 51/4 DSDD 160K completely useless in todays
              society, the Digital Data Drives were High Speed Digital
              Audio Cassettes formated to 256K and were essentially disks
              in the form of Cassettes but a little slower, they had
              directories with 0-255 at 1024 bytes each block = 256K.  The
              emulator will emulate 2 digital data drives but dynamically,
              it will load a 256K data pack file in memory R/W will be in
              memory and at the end of a session any writes will be made
              to the file at the users discretion ie...  With an alert
              that the data pack has been changed.  Access time will be
              Amiga ram access speed, the faster the better.  All pack
              files and cart files will be loaded through the Emulator
              shell and a requestor.


Keyboard:     The Keyboard has 75 Keys, everything is on the Amiga
              Keyboard and some.  Emulation will be no problem.


Memory:       64K Ram is not much from the Amiga, Expansion memory went as
              high as 1/2 Meg.  Most of the software on the ADAM used only
              64K, but there were a few other programs that did use the
              64K expander for their personal use, with the high speed
              256K ram data packs, I'll limit the to the extra 64K.  Total
              128K mem. Which only kicks in through the Emulator shell.
              Added all together 2 256K drives + 128 + emulator = at least
              1 meg to run, there should be no Amiga users out there still
              running off 1/2 Meg, if there is, they don't deserve my work!


Printer:      The ADAM's famous Daisy Wheel Printer, a loud obnoxious
              device that print 120 Words a minute, 16K buffer.  This
              piece of krap is not worth the 2 foot waste of space to
              emulate, so all print goes to the PRT: device.


Ports:        Serial/Parallel Port this option was a $50.00 board that was
              in limited supply, anyway there's no need whatsoever to
              emulate it.  The ADAMLink 300 Baud Modem had it's own
              special connection port.  The Auto Dialer, another piece of
              garbage like the ADAMLink used pulse dialing, check this
              out!  Turn ADAM on, put in software, hit reset, 2 minutes
              later software is booted, call up menu another minute,
              select number, pulse dial and then pick up the phone.  Best
              case scenario takes 5 minutes to dial someone.  The guy who
              thought of this one should have stayed in the cabbage patch
              dept.  The Side connecter expansion port is impossible to
              emulate without hardware, on the ADAM it was used primarily
              for the Atari 2600 emulator and the Auto Dialer, on the
              ColecoVision it was also used for the ADAM computer add on.


Video:        ADAM's Video consists of 16K memory buffer for patterns,
              256x192 and 15 colors for Border and Pixels also 32 separate
              sprites.  Emulation will be difficult because of the way in
              which ADAM setup and used it's video chip.  In studying the
              ADAM video scheme it seemed more like a hack but was
              revolutionary for its time.  The video itself was set up
              with 8x8 patterns with a 2 color state.  This makes out a
              32x24 8x8 patterns or 8 * 32 = 256, 8 * 24 = 192 which
              ultimately means you can only have 2 colors every 8 pixels,
              this is why most Coleco games never had colorful
              backgrounds.  Another drawback was only 4 Sprites to a
              horizontal line.  The Emulator fixes all of the downfalls of
              the the ADAM's video hardware architecture and greatly
              improves on them.

Any call to hardware not supported will return an error return code.


Summary
-------

    This whole program was almost scraped.  I recieved about 7 email
letters of support, one from california.  I was suprised because I was on
an IBM board and all of a sudden, WHAM, I got mail.  Anyway, I was
planning to use the original operating system for this emulator, then
after more R&D I found why should I translate the output of the operating
system and all of it's restrictions when I can just rewrite the EOS seeing
that the Jump tables call the functions and not the program itself.  See
ColecoFig1.iff for more info.  All which led to the development of ARTIE,
(ADAM Real Time Instruction Emulator) a highly optimized set of routines
that replaces the ADAM operating system and interfaces the ADAM output to
Amiga's output.  This code is the finishing touches before beta release.

    It was this code plus all my time in school which had set the release
date from last summer till 2 or 3 months from now.  That's Coding, Debug,
and Tweaking.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

    This information is being released now in order to gauge the Amiga
community's response to another emulator for our great beloved machine.

    Visionary Unlimited!  will be looking for a few good beta testers.  A
limit of 5 beta testers will be used for the preliminary release.  All
beta testers will have to show proof of ownership of a Coleco Adam
computer (Possibly codes results from a simple program?) and will be
registered and have to return detailed bug reports on a timely basis.

    If you're interested in being a beta tester for the Coleco/ADAM
emulator, Visionary Unlimited!  would like to hear from you.  There's two
ways to get in contact with VU!

1     Last! Amiga BBS
      (305) 456-0126

      Leave a message to the SysOP that you'd like to be a beta tester
      for the Coleco/ADAM Emulator.  You'll be notified when beta test
      versions are ready.

2     Reply to pday@gate.net with your request to be a beta tester.  
      Please put the keyword BETATESTER in the message description when
      replying.  You'll get an answer back and be given a time frame for
      beta release.

    If you are interested in the Coleco/ADAM Emulator, but do not want to
be a beta tester, that's alright!  Leave a short message at either two of
the systems above, stating you'll just be interested in the Emulator, with
your name and address.  If there's enough response, there will be a
product flier mailed to all, otherwise it will be announced on the
InterNet and a short blurb will appear in the two leading Amiga magazines.

@node NEWS7 "Emplant "e586" PC Module Released"
@toc NEWS

This past week, prepaid customers of the Emplant PC module dubbed "e586"
began receiving their packages.

The Emplant PC module, designed for the popular Emplant emulation system,
represents the second emulator released for that system, Emplant Mac being
the first.

The PC module is presently shipping without a BIOS.  Utilities Unlimited
had indicated that a custom BIOS and/or a popular existing PC BIOS would
be included, but for now owners must turn to finding their own images,
available from sources such as American Megatrends.

Amiga Report has been told it will receive an evaluation package.  More to
come when it's available.

Harv: BEFORE WE START...  A POLL....  IF YOU OWN A TOASTER SEND A T.  FOR
      STANDALONE LWAVE SEND AN L.  FOR BOTH SEND TL.

Harv: L
JNeisch: T
Drakon: T T
AVID: TL
RichKoster: t
DonH: L
RickB: t
JeffH: AT
RickJ: TL

Harv: OUR GUEST TONITE HAS BEEN CALLED "THE WORLD'S SMARTEST TOASTER GUY."
      I'M SURE YOU ALL KNOW WHO HE IS PEOPLE PAY MANY HUNDREDS OF BUCKS TO
      HAVE HIM TEACH THEM TOASTER/LW STUFF TONITE YOU GUYS GET A REAL
      BARGAIN :) INTRODUCING MR.  LEE STRANAHAN.  TAKE A BOW. 

Stranahan: Well, thanks to Harv from having me.  I'm broadcasting live
      tonight from my desk at my new job with Area 51, the special effects
      company that my brother co-founded.  (Sitting in front of my 275 Mzh
      DEC Alpha, btw) We're currently working on a show called SpSpace,
      which will be on Fox this fall.  In the past, I've worked for and
      with NewTek, produced a series of video tapes, and done a very
      successful (and LONG) training tour in conjunction ith Avid Media
      Group.  We logged over 80,000 miles last year, so if you want any
      restaurant advice, ask!
          
RickB: Do you have any news on the releaase date for 4.0 Flyer?

Stranahan: Flyer release - no official word - do you want an unoficial
      guess?  Early-optimistic-as-all-get-out guess, Mid-March.
      More realistic - Early to mid April

RickJ: ? does the Flyer paint work on a 2000?

Stranahan: TPaint will work fine on the 2000 in 4.0 - not working yet in
      3.9

JeffH: Can you mix and match ScreemerNet Alpha - Mips CPUS under one License...

Stranahan: No on S-net as far as I know, but that kinda thing has changed
     before.

[*** Connection was lost for a minute, so I may have missed a question...]
     
DonH: Will all versions of LW4 be distributed on a single CDROM?

Stranahan: All version of LW will include a CD-ROm and a few floppies with
      the program on them

RichKoster: Lee, what things are you personally doing with LightWave on Fox's
     new "Space" show?

Stranahan: I'm an animator - I started 3 days ago and I've put out three
     shots, so...  I'm doing ok - The main models and surfaces have pretty
     much been done already.  The look is very nice so far - very non-CGI,
     more modeley.  The guys I work with - my brother, Tim McHugh, Matt
     Merkovich, Karl Denham, and Scott Wheeler - have done a great job so far

RickB: You left Newtek.....when.....why......and are you still working
     with them like at NAB?

Stranahan: About three weeks ago, to move back to LA and start to write,
     produce and direct projects, and no - I am working for DPS at this
     NAB.  Will be showing their PAR products and LightWave (It looks like
     - no details yet)

DrGandalf: Will the 4.0 version of LW use Essence (or equivalent)
     textures, or will we have to wait longer? 

Stranahan: LW's plug-in structure should certainly allow that By the way -
     on LW's release date, here's another guess It won't be 1st Quarter -
     I could be wrong, but I think it will just miss

Harv: Okay...  Lee....  as an ex-newtek insider...  and with the supply of
      slotted amigas drying up...  and the buyout dragging on and on...
      what are their plans for the card?  eventually...  they will have no
      new boxes to ship them for.  where are they headed?

Stranahan: Well, there are acutally a number of interesting possibilities
     there, but I can't really taslk about them...  The 4000 market is
     already very dry and they are at a premium But - NAB is just around
     the corner I can tell you this - I'm not sure what they are going to
     do, and I don't think that they are exactly sure either -

Harv: are you intimating they will show a non-amiga toaster at NAB? 

Stranahan: Things change rapidly at NewTek, and no firm decisions have
     been made about any unannounced products or adaptations of existing
     products.  And - I also can tell you that you won't see a non-Amiga
     Toaster in the sense that we think of the Toaster - as Tim said at
     the Video Toaster Expo.
     (and I know because I wrote it) - the future of NewTek is 1)
     LightWave and B) The Flyer...and that's also its present...

Harv: I have a related question for AVID - Jim...  with AW going away, (I
     know this is only today's news)...  are we gonna see VTU fatten up
     quickly do you think?

AVID: I don't think we'll benefit much from the demise of AW.  We pretty
     much have all the ads that fit our magazine that also advertised... 
     in AmigaWorld. 

RichKoster: Are you able to keep writing and doing seminars?

Stranahan: Yes - i should have more time to write, in fact, since I will
     be traveling less and Jim and I are planning a tour for late summer -
     LW only, most likely.  Oh wait One hint and rumor - if we do a tour,
     I plan on including a CD-ROM in the tour materials, With all my
     training frames on it, and about 200 megs of texture maps that I've
     created.  And more stuff.

JeffH: Will NT LW use open-gl? If not, when? Will there be a Flyer card for NT
     machines?

Stranahan: No on open GL for now - possibly by years' end - and there
     could be a non-Amiga Flyer in theory

DrTed: Basic Flyer questions...  When widely available???  Will it work well in
     A2000 or A3000's???

Stranahan: Flyer will work in 2k or 3ks fine - I think 4.0 will be out in
     April, but that is not offical in any way....

Harv: Lee I presume you have meshew's Light-ROM.  i'm interested in your
     candid opinion of it.  For $30 I thought it was fairly wonderful.

Stranahan: No, I don't have it actually

Harv: oh. well get one! :)

Stranahan: I'm sure I will! 

DonH: What are some of the NEW features of LW4? Anything revolutionary?

Stranahan: The price/performance is revolutionary And the new Plug-in
     system is AWESOME - will allow creation of very powerful tools In
     addition, there are some cool new things like Glow..  AND - here's a
     world premiere announcement NewTek has licensed with Elastic Reality
     (formally ASDG) and is including ER's HIIP technology in a number of
     products including LW and the Flyer.   Which means LW will be able to
     load and save all the file formats that ADpro did

Harv: yow!

DrGandalf: :)

Harv: and HIIP is... ?

Stranahan: HIIP - is Host Independent Image Processing.  The engine behind
     ADPros loaders, savers, and image sizing/bitplane reduction stuff SO
     - LW will have that stuff built in - which is a BIG plus.
     This SHOULD be in 4.0 - the contract is signed

Harv: so like you tell lw to load a jpeg or a gif and it just goes and does
     it?

Stranahan: Exactly Harv - or save in AVI anim format or Cineon

Harv: excellent

Stranahan: or reduce the pallette, etc...  That's a pretty big cool
     announcement, IMHO - I worked to get that going at NT...

Harv: I knew ERI had an announcement coming but couldn't squeeze it outta
     anyone there.  you just trumped them :)

Stranahan: That might not be ERI's announcement

Harv: oh. [nevermind]. they said it was "amiga development news." shrug.

Stranahan: But it might - not sure

JeffH: LW Layout, modeler will still be wire frame until they start using open-
     gl?...  What will the first plug-ins will be first?

Stranahan: Right - still wire...

JeffH: Who will have the first plug-in for sale?

Stranahan: Not sure what Plug-ins will be first- but NewTek is also in
       negotiations with a very well known and cool graphics software
       company to develop a plug-in set.

DrTed: Will my old 2000 with 50 Mhz Mega-Midget Racer 50 Mhz 882, 2 meg 32
      bit, 9 Meg 16 bit RAM, and Toaster # 000089 run LW4 adequately, or
      should I plan something more???? 

Stranahan: Well, for what projects?

DrTed: Modelling, rendering, single frame animation....

Stranahan: I can tell you that the PC will be 'better' then the Amiga
      version in some ways - the surfaces panel has a on-screen preview on
      Win NT versions, plus the abilty to change color of wireframe
      objects in layout Plus run at EXTREMELY high res - like 12k by 1k or
      whatevere If you like that sort of thing But the Amiga version will
      only be good enought to do stuff like seaQuest, B5, etc etc In other
      words, the Amy version is plenty good...  But them Alphas is
      QUICK!!!

DrTed: Naw...  NTSC field rendering will be enough for me...

Drakon: Trying to do a roll top desk type thing.  any easy way of getting
      the top to roll back

Stranahan: Yeesch - ok - I see where you're going...  Well, the real way
      would be to move the sections indivdually, I think...

Drakon: yeah but geting all sections to roll back in sync is a pain

Stranahan: Get one motion path set, and then clone the object, shift
      frames...  That would help...  Make it easier...

DrGandalf: You need a "follow me"

Drakon: I keep losing it at the beginning

Stranahan: You might need to parent it to a null...  Move the null up on
      the Y And then rotate the null Does that make any sense?

Drakon: yeah, let me think about it for a bit. 

Harv: Lee - the LW 3.5 dongle.  .....  pass thru holes....  as you know,
     they dont passthru nuttin....  will this ever be addressed/fixed?
     it's very annoying.

Stranahan: Well, the 4.0 version for Amiga and PC will require a dongle

Harv: a new dongle that passes thru correctly?  Or the same dongle I have
     now?
    
Stranahan: I fought hard against this - I don't know a popular graphics
      program on the PC aside from 3DS that requires a dongle I lost - and
      I think they plan to keep the same dongle

Harv: if you have any pull with them, tell them to re-dongle it to joy
     port #2 if it has to have a dongle at all.  thanks.

Stranahan: There's no pull with them on this - the decision is basically made.

Harv: sigh :(

Stranahan: My argument was that lack of a dongle hasn't killed Photoshop, or
     Illustrator or Premiere or or or... But Tim is set on this point...

RickB: I am trying to help a friend with a flyer He has a 2000 with a GVP
      040 board with 32 megs of ram when we installed the flyer it boots
      to the screen where the bottom image of the switcher shows and then
      the amiga power light flashes and it crashed any clues??? 
      
Stranahan: Too many possibilities there, sorry - there has been very little
     2000 system testing in house at NewTek. Almost all 4000 system, so....

RickB: everything else (other programs work fine....toaster 3.5 works fine)

Stranahan: Sorry I can't be more help - but I just don't know

DonH: Is the NT version the same as the Win32, Win95 version?  Is there
     a change in FOG so that it is variable vertically? 

Stranahan: basically the same, but there may be multiple versions (like
     486 v Pentium) compiled to take advatage...

DrTed: Back to the Flyer...  For a real working system in my A3000...  to
      produce half hour shows...  What should I really expect to spend for
      how much hard drives, RAM, needed peripheral components???

Stranahan: RAM isn't an issue.  How much footage makes a half hour show
for you?

DrTed: say at five to one shooting...

Stranahan: OK Let's say you throw out (don't digitize) half that That's an
      hour to an hour and half digitized A couple of 9 Gig drives should
      work fine 9 Gigs times 6 minutes = 54 minutes per drive Roughly Plus
      an audio drive. That's maybe 7-8 grand for drives, I think...

DrTed: Additional components???  ( like TBC's were for the Toaster???)

Stranahan: You need a TBC.  And a sync source - call it $200 for a black
      generator

DrTed: Like a personal IV in the same machine???

Stranahan: To provide stable house synce - TBC IV should be great Maybe a
      Mackie 1202 audio mixer. That helps. That's about it.... 

DrTed: (oh...  how much for flyer???)

Stranahan: $4995 list. Actual mileage may vary.

JeffH: Will Allen be adding envolopes?  I need more envolopes!!!  Like in
      the Texture section.
 
Stranahan: There are some new envelopes and Plugins could theoritically
      add many more And new surface features are easy with plug-ins.

RickJ: lee, a 2000, gvp 030,18 mg Toaster Flyer, & Retina...  the Retina
      locks up...

Stranahan: yeah that makes some sense, perhaps...

RickJ: ADPro 2.5 save to retina locks, any ideas?

Stranahan: Adding new cards will do that...does it work with the card out
      but with the software installed?

RickJ: the amiga locks the retina not at all The Retina worked prior to
      the Flyer

Stranahan: Again, sorry - but no idea there....I know there'a Retina at
      NewTek so they can at least test it...

Harv: I'm gonna sneak in one bonus question (from the crowd..  a late
     arriver) Lee: more render modules for LW.  specifically an OpalVision
     rendere?  coming in 4.0?  yes?no?  any others?

Stranahan: No plans, but could be added through plug-ins...

RickB: OK Lee Tim told me of a program that will you manipulate the caches
      in the drives is there any other programs that will let us do this
      or will we have to wait for Newtek to get it to us in 4.0 and how
      many flyers do you think have shipped to date?  thanks for
      everything!!!

Stranahan: Well, the third party often beats NewTek on things like this
      unless NT gets it out quickly...  As for number sold Let me put it
      this way - The big non-linear editor on the block is the Avid NT has
      sold about half as many Flyers as Avid has sold system - and it
      isn't even in a final version yet!
      The Flyer (in terms of numbers) is already one the most popular non-
      linear editors on the market...

RickB: Will the drive issue be better any sooner?

Stranahan: The drive issue is better now...

RickB: yes but the dealers are not letting it out!

Stranahan: AND - Avid is on Mac/PC - we're on a computer that isn't being
      made currently...
      So - it's been very successful - and 4.0 is a BIG step up...

Harv: I WANT TO THANK LEE STRANAHAN FOR GIVING US SOME OF HIS VALUABLE
     TIME TONITE.  HOPE YAWL FOUND THE ANSWERS USEFUL.  THANKS LEE,
     ESPECIALLY FOR DOING THIS IN THE MIDST OF MOVING YOUR HOME BASE.

AmiTCP 4.2
AmiTCP/IP Group  (amitcp-group@nsdi.fi)
NSDi - Network Solutions Development Inc. Oy
P.O. Box 32 
FIIN-02151 ESPOO
Finland

Demo with inital nag-requestor available from AmiNet:

Purchase price ~$58.00 U.S. Dollars

Regular Price ~$100 U.S. Dollars

Requirements:
AmigaOS 2.04+
1 megabyte RAM
2 megabytes hard drive space
Sana-II network drivers 


Summary:
AmiTCP is a nice product.  The pricing is high, especially given the lack
of integrated utilities.  As a comparison, there are several TCP/IP
packages for other systems that offer more built in (OS/2 Warp now ships
with an Internet packages, with built in mail, newsreader, etc) and for
about the same price or less.  The manual lists many available
applications and where the latest ones can be found, but they require
further installation, and in some cases, more fees.

The manual is very good, though there are a few areas that I feel could be
improved upon.  Installation was not that hard (but I have installed 3
prior releases of AmiTCP), novices may have a harder time.  I would
suggest that any novice have with them or on the phone someone familiar
with at least TCP/IP, and preferable AmiTCP. 

I am currently using it for CSLIP access, and it works well.  I will
attempt soon to network my other 3000 to this one, using Ethernet.

[Last minute note - since I first wrote this, I have spend about a week
trying to make this work.  I have been unsuccessful so far, but I have not
ruled out hardware problems with one of my boards.]

I feel it was well worth the $50 I paid, but I would have thought much
harder about spending $100.  If graphical Internet utilities were included
and auto-installed, such as a newsreader, a World Wide Web reader, mail
etc.  I would not be as adverse to the price.  As it stands now, you will
need to install these (along with any associated programs) yourself.  Some
programs are very easy to install, others, much harder.

Review:
AmiTCP is an implementation of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP) for the Amiga.  Up until now, it has been freely
distributable, but with release of version 4, Network Solutions
Development Inc.  is selling it as a commercial package.

Earlier versions of AmiTCP were easy to set up - after you had set it up
before.   Idiosyncracies such as install scripts creating files that
needed to be edited by hand afterwards, and in having to change the
contents of three files in order to use a dynamic IP address (as many
Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) are set up).  Scripts abounded to
handle some of these chores, as did utilities to access the Internet. 

When version 4 arrived, I was eager to install it.  The first thing I
noticed was the neat, spiral bound (thank you!  - there should be a
special part of purgatory for people who send manuals that are glue bound
so they won't lay flat and be usable as a reference) printed manual.
Quite a change from the earlier computer files. 

The installation program (using the standard Commodore Installer) was
easier to use than before.  One thing that was not easier was trying to
enter the licence number off the licence card.  The licence code you are
required to enter is 33?   letters, numbers, and characters in a small
font that makes it hard to distinguish several characters.  I spend more
time trying to get this typed in than in the rest of the install!  It was
hard to tell whether that characters is a lower-case "l", or a numeral
"1".  Similar problems occurred with "o" and "zero".  And the code is case
sensitive, further compounding the agony.

But the code finally matched the computers criteria, and the install
continued.   The install will automatically launch you into the
Configuration program.  This is where I think most novices will have the
most trouble.  The manual makes a valiant attempt to explain the concepts
and vocabulary to understand and use such an interface.

I entered my needed information (in this case, a Compressed SLIP, (CSLIP)
account through a local access provider.) Most providers should be able to
tell you what you will need: basically, your IP number (if not assigned
dynamically), your destination address, netmask, and Domain Name Service.
If you are installing on a permanent network, your system administrator
should have the needed information.  I created an account for myself and
set up the CSLIP interface.  Again, I did not find this hard - but this
was the third version of AmiTCP I had installed.  I would not say the
manual is bad in this area - in fact, its one of the best TCP/IP manuals I
have read, but it still could use a little improvement toward the novice
user.

Its troubleshooting list does not list several possibilities that I have
had personal experience with, and have helped several others with the same
problem.  For instance - when I first got my local account, I could not
get AmiTCP to work.  I could use the "ping" utility (which measures the
time it takes to send a small packet to another computer and return) but I
could not use anything else. 

[It turns out the "SLIP" my provider was selling was really "CSLIP" (and
since they give the Windows software pre-configured, it had slipped (no
pun intended) their mind that they were running compression.]

(In my instance above, an experienced network administrator commented that
it sounded like they were set up with CSLIP - because "ping" uses TCP
packets, but that other programs utilized a different transport layer -
and that that was the one that was compressed by CSLIP.)

AmiTCP release 4 has a basic set of tools to access the Internet, although
some have been spruced up a bit.  There is a telnet client, but
"Napsaterm" will probably see much more use.  Napsaterm is a vt100
terminal that opens its own windows, and is friendlier than the
shell-based telnet.  (Earlier telnets with earlier versions of AmiTCP were
reputed to be buggy, so I developed a habit of using napsaterm for its
greater reliability as well as its greater usability.)

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) has been replaced with "ncFTP", a much
friendlier and smarter client.  NcFTP has the nice feature of dropping a
random hint on each execution (for those few who don't read manuals)

The manual details quite a few "third party" Internet programs that run
under AmiTCP, as well as where the latest version can be downloaded from
the AmiNet, a huge collection of Amiga software.  This is a nice feature,
and will be very helpful to those who do not yet know anything about
AmiNet (always the place to look for something) but it seems as if they
are using this as a substitute for developing/packaging these utilities
into AmiTCP.

Some of these utilities integrate quite easily and painlessly.  Others are
much more difficult, and since they are all developed separately, there is
not a standard interface.  Many require additional programs (Such as MUI,
etc.)

In my opinion, for the market AmiTCP is aimed at, with the price that is
being asked, it should have a mail reader/sender, Usenet newsreader, and a
World Wide Web browser as minimum tools included.

The manual spends a good portion of time explaining the product, and the
Internet.  Proper net etiquette (netiquette) is mentioned, and the basic
explanation of the TCP/IP suite is one I wish I had when I was learning
about the Internet and is better than some reference books I have
encountered.

For what it has now, I have to give AmiTCP high marks.  Its documentation
is very good (leaves certain companies decidedly in the dust (no names,
but who has a 70% PC network market share?).  I have encountered no
noticeable bugs.

I feel there are still areas that need work, especially in the area of
included utilities.  When AmiTCP has these included utilities, I would
consider it to be a mature application that has successfully developed far
from its early roots.

                 (610) 586-5706 (fax)

PRICE: I paid $195 U.S., this includes $5 S&H

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:  Amiga 500/2000/CDTV

SYSTEM TESTED ON: Amiga 2000 (Rev 4.4), ECS chip set, GForce '030
                  accelerator @ 50 MHz., 1 meg CHIP + 6 megs FAST memory,
                  2 standard floppy drives, Quantum LPS270S hard drive
                  with Trumpcard Professional controller, Workbench 3.1

PACKAGING: The box contained the MegACHIP 2000/500 board and a 13 page
           manual


FEATURES (according to the manual):
* Doubles the amount of RAM accessible to the custom chips
* Fully compatible with the Video Toaster - Toaster Paint and Lightwave
* Fully autoconfig, uses config space that is reserved for use as CHIP RAM
* Lets you upgrade your Amiga to stay current with the latest technology
* Fully compatible with Workbench 2.x and the ECS Denise chip
* Lets your system multitask much easier with graphic intensive programs
* Fully compatible with the MultiStart II ROM board

INSTALLATION: This is what I did with my A2000 to install the MegACHIP
board.  The A500/CDTV procedures will be slightly different. 

You must begin by removing the keyboard, mouse, and all other peripherals
from the computer.  Next, remove the case and power supply/disk drive bay.
The old Agnus chip must be removed from the socket on the motherboard
before the MegACHIP can be installed in its place.  In the past, I have
had about a 50% success ratio in removing old Agnus chips with the cheap
tool provided by Grapevine - you really should use a professional quality
PLCC chip puller.  I took my machine to a computer store and had the
technician remove the Agnus chip for me.  It only cost $10 and it saved a
major headache if the socket had been ruined in the home removal process.
Years ago, when I removed my original OCS Agnus to replace it with the Fat
Agnus (1 MB), the chip was in the socket quite firmly (mostly the dust
over the years had "welded" it in place) and some of the contacts on the
socket were messed up after using the cheap chip puller.  It cost $60 to
have a new socket placed on the motherboard!  I learned my lesson the hard
way, so consider yourself forewarned.

After the Agnus chip has been removed, and if you had only 512k CHIP RAM,
you must either change two jumper settings or one jumper and one solder
connection depending on the revision of your motherboard.  If you already
had 1 MB of CHIP RAM then no changes need to be made.

The manual states that you must hold the MegACHIP board in a certain
orientation in relation to the motherboard, but I found this to be
incorrect.  The socket adapter on the bottom of the board can only go in
the Agnus socket one way, so if you pay attention then you'll have no
problems with this step.

Now you must connect a spring action clip to either pin 36 of the Gary
chip or pin 48 of the 68000 chip.  I used the 68000 chip's pin because I
already had another clip attached to my Gary chip (a MultiStart II Board)
and I didn't want to hassle with two clips on one chip.

Finally, reassemble your Amiga and you're ready to go!

OTHER STUFF: The MegACHIP comes with 1 megabyte of memory on board which
acts as the second megabyte of CHIP RAM.  The 13 page manual is concise
and easy to follow.  It also includes a single page of trouble shooting
which covers the most common problems when trying to install the board. 
The only trouble I had when installing the board was when I first tried to
boot the computer for a test.  The computer would not boot the first time
I turned it on, so I checked the clip's connection on the 68000 chip and
re-seated the MegACHIP in the Agnus socket.  After doing these two steps
the computer booted normally.  I now have approximately 1.8 MB of CHIP
RAM, after booting, on my system versus the 780k which I had previously. 
One note to A500 owners, the MegACHIP will NOT work if you have a RAM
expansion board installed in the trapdoor that takes more than 512k of
RAM.  You should use an A501-type RAM expander in the trapdoor and use
another RAM expansion board for your other FAST RAM.

SUMMARY: The MegACHIP board is easy to install, with the hardest part
being the safe removal of your old Agnus chip.  The added CHIP memory
allows you to run more applications at once and is a big help in the DTP
and DTV areas.  If you take into consideration the price of the 8375 Agnus
chip and the 1 MB of RAM that are included on the MegACHIP board, it's a
pretty good deal.

PRODUCT NAME

	NetBSD-Amiga 1.0, official release version from November 1994.

	[MODERATOR'S NOTE:  This is an update to Markus's previous
	review of NetBSD, kernel version 635, found in our review
	archives in the file software/unix/NetBSD.  - Dan]


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

	Freely distributable Unix-alike operating system for Amiga computers.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

	Name:	The Regents of the University of California, Berkeley
		and many contributors.

		Amiga port by Markus Wild of Zurich, Switzerland, with major
		contributions from Bryan Ford and Mike 'mykes' Schwartz.

		Merge with NetBSD-1.0 and major reworks applied by 
		Chris Hopps.


LIST PRICE

	Freely distributable under the NetBSD disclaimer; see the COPYRIGHT
NOTICE section, below.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

	NetBSD 1.0 is a final release, so all information below is static.
New drivers and support for more peripherals is under development and is
probably implemented in a new release of NetBSD-current.

	SYSTEM HARDWARE

		An accelerated Amiga (68030, 68040) with a working MMU 
		(memory management unit).  This includes most accelerator 
		boards (e.g., Commodore A2630), the Amiga 3000, and others.  
		A working FPU is required.
                NetBSD does support the 68040 processor.
		NetBSD is untested on 68020 environments.

		The stock A500, A1000, A2000, A1200, and A4000/030 computers
		have no MMU and so will not run NetBSD.

		Requires at least 4 MB of contiguous Fast RAM.
		8 MB or more of contiguous 32-bit RAM is recommended.

		Requires at least 15 MB hard drive space for a minimal setup.
		100 MB hard drive space needed for a full installation.
		Actual use of NetBSD may require much more space; for
		example, a serious developer may need 500 MB or more.

	HARD DRIVE SUBSYSTEM

		Amiga NetBSD supports the following hard-drive systems:

			Amiga 3000 and 3000T internal SCSI host adapter.
			A2091 SCSI host adapter for A2000.
			GVP Series II SCSI host adapter for A2000 and A500.
			PPI Zeus SCSI host adaptor for PPI 040 board
			Magnum SCSI host adaptor
			CSA SCSI host adaptor 
			Supra SCSI host adaptor
			IVS SCSI host adaptor
			IDE Adaptor of A4000 and A1200
			(and some others)

		Currently NOT supported:

			Any PIO adapter such as Oktagon and ALF.

		Almost every SCSI hard drive is known to work with Amiga
		NetBSD.  This includes the range of Quantum drives, Seagate,
		Wren, DEC, Fujitsu and IBM.

		SCSI tape drives (QIC, DAT) and SCSI CD-ROM drives (ISO and
		Rockridge extension) are supported.

	GRAPHICS

		Standard Amiga ECS and AGA chip set.
		Retina Graphics Board is supported.
		(Experimental drivers exist for other boards - see below.)

	SOFTWARE

		The bootstrap loader works with almost any version of AmigaDOS.


COPY PROTECTION

	None - as far as your Amiga is running with it.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

	Amiga 3000 with 2 MB Chip RAM, 16 MB Fast RAM
	Fujitsu M2623F (400MB), Apple CD300, 2 Conner CFP1060S, HP DAT
        HP35470A
        Picasso II graphics board
        A2060 ArcNet board
        A2065 Ethernet board

INTRODUCTION

	["TTY-fighters attacking!" Con Solo shouted.]

	For your own interest:  I may use technical words which are very
common in Unix environments but meaningless to people who have never used
such a system.  Amiga NetBSD may help you to enter the world of Unix, but
you will need third party help, such as Unix reference books and guidelines.

	Amiga NetBSD-1.0 is the first freely distributable Unix for Amiga
systems, and enables the user to run a fully qualified Unix environment on
his own machine.

	NetBSD takes over the Amiga, so it is not possible to run it
concurrently with AmigaDOS.  So in this review, you will see references to
the "Amiga side" and the "NetBSD side" to indicate which operating system
(UNIX or AmigaDOS) must be running to accomplish a particular task.  In
general, if a reference is missing, I am referring to the NetBSD side.


INSTALLATION

	[Vitamin enriched for your reading pleasure!]

	Amiga NetBSD is not intended to be installed by a novice in
terms of hard drive systems on Amiga.  You definitely need to know how
to work with AmigaDOS HDToolBox.

	But first, where to get Amiga NetBSD?

	Before getting any of the archives, PLEASE get the FAQ (Frequently
Asked Questions) List, which should reside at the same places as NetBSD
itself.  This list informs you how to install Amiga NetBSD, how much space is
needed, how to set up your hard drives, and much more.

	If you have Internet access, you can ftp the needed archives from
ftp.uni-regensburg.de (the main site for Amiga NetBSD, there are
mirrors all over the world) from the directory:

		/pub/NetBSD-Amiga/docs

	The site is also reachable via WWW:

		ftp://ftp.uni-regensburg.de

	Also, some of the Aminet ftp sites mirror the NetBSD archive.
PLEASE DO CHECK your local mirror.  NetBSD is *not* integrated in the AmiNet
archive, and hopefully never will - for several reasons. All official
NetBSD-1.0 mirrors should also distribute the Amiga binary distribution.

	NetBSD is LARGE. You will need at least 10MB of "gzip-ed" archives to
have a standard NetBSD environment... and even more if you intend to work on
the kernel.

	If you have no Internet access, then it is a LOT more difficult to
get Amiga NetBSD.  Maybe you should ask someone to help you on Usenet
(comp.unix.amiga), either by sending you a tape or letting you copy it
directly from his/her hard drive.  It's worth the effort.

	NetBSD-Amiga 1.0 is made available on the "Meeting Pearls Volume II"
CD-ROM obtainable from your Amiga dealer.  

	NetBSD-1.0, the official release, contains a binary and source
distribution for the Amiga, as well as the official INSTALL text.  So any
CD-ROM containing the official NetBSD-1.0 distribution should contain the
Amiga distribution as well.

	You do not need a tape drive, but this is recommended, as it
eases the process of installing NetBSD.  If you have either Ethernet
or PPP access, you probably will want to get only the basic kit at
first.  This includes tools for Ethernet and PPP running TCP/IP; thus,
you can get the rest of NetBSD using a (local) network.

	Also, the basic kit contains a Kermit transfer program, so it
is possible to get the required archives via modem or a null-modem
cable.

	You need an 15MB partition for the root filesystem which is created
under NetBSD using a floppy disk as installation filesystem.  This way the
installation is way easier than previous releases.

	If you are careful, and if everything runs fine, you can start the
kernel using the supplied "loadbsd" tool.

	You will hopefully see the Copyright information, and then some
numbers about your system memory.  Then the kernel's built-in 'autoconfig'
logic detects the installed boards, such as graphics boards and SCSI host
adapters.  Finally, the root filesystem should be detected and the system
boots into single-user mode.

	You are running Unix on your Amiga now!

	Now you need to play system administrator on your very own system.
You need to format the other disk partitions and copy the /usr tree from the
distributed archives.

	Once you have done the initial installation, the rest is easy to do.
Get the ksrc archive if you intend to compile the kernel yourself. A
generic kernel and the sources for it are supplied, too.


REVIEW

	The review is split into two parts: technical discussion and general
overview.


HISTORY OF AMIGA NETBSD (technical)

	NetBSD-1.0 is based on the last public release of BSD 4.4-Lite (the
networking-2 release) by the University of Berkeley, as well as integrating
some ideas from 386BSD.  The Amiga port is largely based on the initial HP300
code distributed with 4.3BSD-NET2, and has become part of the official
NetBSD-1.0 source tree.  Further NetBSD ports in the line will include support
for Mac, Sun3 and Sparc, DEC and other.

	This port was done by Markus Wild in June 1993, and is based upon the
original HP port.  As Markus Wild has a great deal of knowledge of Unix
systems, his first efforts were to compile the basic tools needed for the
Unix environment.  This was done on the AmigaDOS side with GCC 2.4.3, which
he ported himself to AmigaDOS some time ago.  His famous ixemul.library
finally found a successor.

	After doing the initial port of the kernel (the basic
operating system of Unix environments), the next problems were the
basic root filesystem and hard drive support.  Here, Markus was aided
by the Amiga Mach port, worked on by many other people, which had a
working SCSI driver but no freely distributable Unix server.

	All in all, this was a lucky constellation, and Amiga NetBSD was
ported in less than a month!

	Having compiled the entire root filesystem, followed soon by
an easy port of GCC 2.4.5 was very easy, the kernel could then be
compiled under NetBSD itself, along with the rest of the environment.
Amiga NetBSD has been published and distributed over the Internet to
interested developers and supporters.  A mailing list was created, and
bugs, features and wishes have been discussed.  Amiga NetBSD has a
living future.

	At the time writing this, NetBSD-Amiga has been fully
incorporated and merged with the NetBSD-current source tree for the
kernel.  This yields into a stable and even commonly supported kernel
with many more features.

	Current maintainer of the Amiga part of the NetBSD-current
tree is Chris Hopps.  Major development is done by Michael Hitch,
Niklas Halquist and Markus Wild.  Many others do contribute their
work.


OVERVIEW

	You may wonder why a Unix environment is needed for the Amiga.
Well, this is a serious question, but there is no real answer.  The
users and developers of Amiga NetBSD have various uses for it:
interest in doing the port, use of Unix programs at home, easy support
and easy access to University resources, etc.  They share their love
of pure Unix environments.

	Currently, Amiga NetBSD takes over the Amiga, so it is not possible
to run AmigaDOS programs under NetBSD using all the resources of Intuition
and Exec.  This may change.

	It is possible to mount (read-only) Unix File System (UFS)
partitions on the AmigaDOS side.  This helps you to copy files from
NetBSD to AmigaDOS.  You can also mount (read-only) AmigaDOS
filesystems on the NetBSD side.  This allows the two sides to share
common resources (i.e., TeX fonts, compiler include files, and much
more).

	Amiga NetBSD is a true multitasking and multiuser operating
system and allows system sharing in an intelligent way.  Running in
conjunction with existing Unix environments (i.e., at a university),
it is possible to connect the Amiga running NetBSD to networks via
Ethernet and PPP using a true TCP/IP stack protocol.

	The X11 window system is available in a version of X11R6.  It uses
shared libraries (yielding smaller binaries).  X11 on Amiga NetBSD requires
a third party graphics board such as the Retina or cirrus based boards like
Picasso II, Piccolo and Spectrum, but a monochrome version would be feasible
for the standard Amiga display. A color X server for ECS or AGA is currently
not implemented.

	Amiga NetBSD is binary compatible with some other UNIX system.
Even more, future NetBSD versions will support various third-party binaries,
such as SunOS, HP-UX and possibly Amiga Unix executables.

	Supported drivers are:
	(list not complete!)

	o	SCSI for hard drives, QIC tapes, CD-ROM, and DAT tapes.
	o	Internal IDE adapter A4000 and A1200
	o	ECS and AGA console driver with overscan resolution (VT200).
	o	Retina console driver with different resolutions (VT200).
	o	ASCII keyboard (qwerty) driver, possible to load localized
		keyboards.
	o	Mouse with up to 3 buttons 
	o	Joysticks with up to 3 buttons (no real use yet).
	o	Internal serial port up to 38400 baud for terminal or modem.
	o	PPP and SLIP TCP/IP driver for serial port connections.
	o	Internal parallel port for printers.
	o	A2065 and Ameristar Ethernet boards.
	o	Floppy disk drives
	o	Audio (at least for more than a simple audio bell).
	o	Retina graphics board driver for X11

	Currently not supported:
	o	Multi-serial boards such as the A2232 and GVP I/O Extender.

	Experimental drivers are available for:
	o	Cirrus based boards: Picasso II, Piccolo, Spectrum
	o	Fastlane SCSI driver
	o	MFC-II multiserial board
	o	Ariadne Ethernet


DOCUMENTATION

	The documentation which is needed to install Amiga NetBSD is the
above-mentioned Amiga NetBSD INSTALL text.  The official INSTALL guideline
is provided with every NetBSD-1.0 distribution.

	There is no documentation but the standard man pages.  These online
manual pages help you to use the basic tools, such as the shell or formatting
disks.  The problem is that you need to have NetBSD running first.

	As Amiga NetBSD is a full flavored and full grown Unix system, you
need third party documentation to provide help for system administration and
basics.


LIKES

	The installation process has been eased quite a lot.  A floppy
serves as initial filesystem to boot.  Slightly automated, the binary
distribution can be installed from almost any media - even network and
AmigaDOS partitions.

	I like the very incredible fact that Amiga NetBSD is STABLE.  My
Amiga runs Amiga NetBSD-1.0 for months now, and I have not had any kernel
panics.

	And as it is FREE, there seem to be many more productive users and
developers than ever for an Amiga Unix system.

	At one of the last Amiga events in Germany, the Amiga Internet and
Usenet Meeting '95 in Karlsruhe, Amiga NetBSD was used on 10 of the attended
150 machines.  During the meeting, the Ethernet driver for Ariadne was
introduced, and the networking tools, such as ftp, telnet and even IRC were
used at the meeting itself (with about 70 machines connected to the local
network).

	I like the fact that I can compile almost every neat UNIX tool such
as gnuplot, tcsh, emacs, TeX with almost NO effort.  Mostly there is even no
change in the Makefile needed -- just compile it!

	What I also like is the fact that I can learn to administrate a Unix
System of my own.  This is harder than one might expect.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

	I dislike the fact that the developers are spread round the world -
but alas, this is *Net*-BSD :-)


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

	I have been using Unix environments for more than 7 years now:
mostly as a standard user, but also as software developer and system
administrator.  This was mostly at my University and a company I worked for
some years ago.

	Comparing Amiga NetBSD to any other Unix platform is an interesting
problem.  Let's start with the Unix systems available for the Amiga:  Amiga
Unix and Amiga Minix.  Unfortunately I must say, I have not worked with
either of these systems enough to do a full comparison.

	Amiga Unix is a the best SYSTEM V R4 port I have ever seen before the
Solaris OS for Sun Sparcstations was shipped.  It is a commercial product and
comes with printed manuals.  It has many advantages to Amiga NetBSD as yet,
because it is older and has been used for a long time now.  It is stable but
has its problems.  The current situation of the Commodore Inc. yields
to the conclusion that AMIX is no longer supported.

	Amiga Unix has switchable consoles and supports multi-serial cards,
X11, and audio features.  It does not support SCSI host adapters other than
A3091 and A2091 (a GVP driver seems to be available though).  Sources to
important parts of the kernel are missing, so it is almost impossible to add
CD-ROM support.

	Amiga Minix is a very good port of Minix based upon the theory of
Prof.  Tanenbaum.  I don't know if one can actually compare Minix to
NetBSD:  I believe one shouldn't.  Minix was developed to show how to make
an operating system.

	Amiga Linux is still under construction.  The group around Hamish
MacDonald has some minor advantages over the NetBSD community, but only
recently the networking code and more important the graphic support has been
implemented.  They also have to deal with the "strange" features of the
original Intel 386-based kernel code - Linux is developing more and more a
horizontal layer for more platforms.  I wish them good luck:  we can use the
competition.

	It is not possible for the NetBSD community to make use of any of the
Linux code due to their use of the GNU copyleft.  NetBSD is distributed
under the Berkeley copyright (see end of article for a copy), which
essentially allows free use of sources, as long as the University and its
contributors are granted proper credit in any documentation and/or
advertisements.  So the consequence of this is that the Linux groups can use
NetBSD code if they want to, but not vice-versa.  Amiga Unix sources can't
be used, as they're copyrighted by Commodore, although they would be quite
useful to get support for the multiport serial board, for example.

	Amiga Mach seems to have died due to the lack of a freely
distributable Unix server.  As CMU has had problems distributing their own
server, Amiga Mach never had a working environment.  Luckily the work made
for Amiga Mach could be used for NetBSD.  Also, it looks like the entire
Amiga Mach group has switched to NetBSD; anyway, Niklas Halquist still
intends to port the Hurd Unix server.

	This leads us to compare Amiga NetBSD with other Unix platforms,
such as Sun OS, Ultrix MacUX and AIX.  This is a very difficult task, and I
don't really want to do this.  Simply let's say that NetBSD is as easy to
handle as Sun OS (for Sun3) and more simple to use than Ultrix (Digital).
It is funny to see that Amiga NetBSD is more stable than IBM's AIX ever was,
but AIX is by far more complex of course.
	
	I should at least say that Sun3's are the platforms to which NetBSD
actually can compare best.  Both are based upon Motorola M68K CPUs, and both
do not require very special hardware.  Of course, Sun OS is older and
wiser.  A Sun3/60 or Sun3/80 has almost the same amount of RAM and speed as
a normal A3000.

	Why I don't want to compare those Unix implementations?  The
machines they run on are some 100 times faster than any Amiga.  These other
Unix implementations are enhanced to deal with very specific hardware and
are intended to run for several users at the same time without problems.


BUGS
	
	A project like NetBSD has bugs.  I reported all my bugs to the
NetBSD community and even tried to fix some myself.


VENDOR SUPPORT

	No such support.

	You need to have Usenet access at least, if you want to stay in
contact with NetBSD developers. If you persuade your favorite Amiga magazine
to publish more articles about NetBSD-Amiga, it would sure help us!


WARRANTY

	None. Absolutely none. Even if you destroy your hardware.  You have
been warned.  Warning also applies if you get addicted on NetBSD :-)


CONCLUSIONS

	The product offers a fair way to turn your Amiga system to a real
Unix workstation:  a true multitasking and multiuser system for a cheap
price.

	Professionals might consider this product as a big advantage for
their needs.  And as it is freely distributable, it has to be compared to
the original Amiga Unix, of course.

	On a scale of 0 to 5 stars, I give Amiga NetBSD 4 stars.

                              @{" Sean Caszatt " link SEAN}
==========================================================================
                               
Hello again, Amiga game fans.  This time, rather than devote a whole column
to one game, I've decided to do some mini-reviews of a few recent Amiga and
CD32 games.

It's been a rather slow time for game releases.  [Nevertheless, in Europe,
Amiga game sales beat all others in the Christmas season!  -Jason] Some
games from the Christmas season may have been overlooked by those caught
up in the hype of games like MORTAL KOMBAT II and RISE OF THE ROBOTS.
Here's 3 that may have gotten past some of you, but didn't quite make it
past me.

SHAQ FU - (Amiga)
It must be nice to have enough fame and money to have a videogame created
about you.  Shaquille O'Neal, the current NBA media darling, is the star
of this very flawed beat 'em up.  (Why a basketball player is the focal
point of a fighting game is beyond me.) This game has problems any way you
look at it.  It's on 6 disks and is not hard drive installable.  It's
plagued by poor control and tiny character sprites.  It's also not very
fun to play.  If I were famous enough to have people wanting to make a
videogame about me, I'd at least make sure that it was fun to play when it
was done.

(Ratings out of 10)
Playability: 3	-  Graphics: 4	-  Sound:6  -  Overall: 4
Video Mode: NTSC		Manufacturer: Ocean/EA

DRAGONSTONE - (Amiga/CD32)
This role-playing/action game seemed promising at first but was a
disappointment upon further inspection.  Basically, there's not a lot to it.
You move around and solve puzzles (very simplistic ones, I might add) while
constantly fighting off various creatures.  It's very repetitive, not much
to look at and not something I'd want to play very often.  However, it might
serve as an introduction to the basics for a first-time adventure/action
player.  That is, of course, as long as you let them know that there are
much better adventures awaiting them down the road.  A noble effort that
falls on its face.

Playability: 5  -  Graphics: 5  -  Sound: 5  -  Overall: 5
Video Mode: PAL			Manufacturer:  Core

JUNGLE STRIKE - (Amiga/AGA/CD32)
This is the sequel to 1993's very popular (and very well done) DESERT
STRIKE.  EA opted to license the work on JUNGLE STRIKE out to Ocean.  As a
result, the graphics aren't quite as refined and smooth as they were in
DESERT STRIKE, but the gameplay is intact and that's a big plus.  The
action's still pretty much the same as in D.S.  except now you get to
venture outside the helicopter and take control of a hovercraft and a
stealth fighter as well.  The control is still a bit tricky, but once you
get the hang of it, you'll be having a blast (literally).  For some
reason, the game boots in PAL, but the screen is formatted for NTSC.  The
result is a big, blank area at the botton of the screen.  It a minor
distraction that doesn't take anything away from one of the best action
games to come along since, well, DESERT STRIKE.

==========================================================================

PRODUCT NAME

	Liquidation of Commodore International, Ltd.


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

	A product that everyone feared would eventually come, and it finally
came upon us mercilessly.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

	Name:	Bahamian Courts, with some help from various legal eagles


LIST PRICE

	Anywhere from $19 million to about $100 million (US), depending on
whom you ask.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	HARDWARE

		Strong nerves.

	SOFTWARE

		Lots of patience.


COPY PROTECTION

	This product is protected from successfully operating by a couple of
fools named Mehdi Ali and Irving Gould.  I would rate this copy protection
as unacceptable.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

	This product has been in extensive testing on over 4 million Amigas
worldwide.  Many users were so exhausted from testing that they just decided
to sell their machine and migrate to a different platform.


INSTALLATION

	I never installed this on my system, honest. It just somehow made
its way there.  I suppose you could describe its installation as simple as,
say, a computer virus.


REVIEW

	Well, what can I say.  For at least a year before it actually
happened, I anticipated this product's hitting the Amiga market.  During this
time, I almost began regarding it as another one of those vaporware products
that we Amiga users have become so accustomed to.

	When the liquidation finally hit the market, I must say that I was
quite disappointed.  The whole thing was full of bugs, and hardly ran at
all. In fact, now, about 9 revisions and updates later, it still doesn't
seem to deliver what was originally promised, which of course was the
possibility of a capable company manufacturing and marketing the Amiga line
of personal computers.

	Though the developers of this product still seem relatively
enthusiastic about its possibilities, I am beginning to seriously doubt the
liquidation's viability in the current Amiga market.  In fact, I would go as
far as suggesting that the market might have been better off without such a
product being available in the first place.


DOCUMENTATION

	Documentation is extremely poor.  If it weren't for a few good
supplements, such as Amiga Report, there wouldn't be any documentation at
all.  (Kudos to the editors.)

LIKES

	I can't say that I like anything about this product.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

	I dislike the lengthy, seemingly endless proceedings that never seem
to end, and that every time there seems to be the proverbial light at the
end of the tunnel, it just turns out to be an oncoming locomotive.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

	Not much to compare this thing to; but if you're interested, go to
your local library and look up "Pan American Airlines."  They were also a
once-great company that didn't quite make it.


BUGS

	Full of bugs.  Simply doesn't work.


VENDOR SUPPORT

	None.


WARRANTY

	None - expressed nor implied.


CONCLUSIONS

	I would not recommend this liquidation to anyone.  It doesn't
perform as promised, doesn't even work, and it costs too much.  It also
causes many of your fellow Amiga owners leave you for little-endian
pastures.  Stay away!

[CyberGraphics is a new "Workbench Emulation" system for several video
boards available for the Amiga.  Since at the AR offices, we've been
unable to obtain a video board, I asked for some writeups on the system.
What I got were a LOT of benchmarks... -Jason]


Heard you are looking for infor on the Cybergraphics WB Emulation
software..  well here's my 2 cents worth. 

I decided to check out the new Cybergraphics shareware software on my
Spectrum, and compare it to EGS 7.1.  I used Intuispeed 1.5 and here are
the results.  A few things I should mention though are that the second and
third tests were performed with NTSC LACE 8 colour WB screen for both
driver packages.  The first test on the EGS was with a 1024x768x8 screen
and the first Cybergraphics test was with an 800x600x8 WB screen.  Also
each time I tested the Cybergraphics drivers the test only seemed to work
in a 640x400 'box' in the top left corner, this may point out a bug in the
Cybergraphics driver or Intuispeed.  If you have any comments or questions
please contact me at skipper@io.org.  BTW I failed to mention all the
tests were performed on the same machine with a 2Mb GVP EGS Spectrum in
ZIII mode.  I should also add I was pleased with how well Cybergraphics
seems to perform and only found one program that conflicts with it,
IPrefs2Fast.

[And Wartmann's contribution, using a Picasso II board.  "VT-Emu" is the
Village Tronic Picasso software.]

Hi,

I've tryed a little bit with CyberGFX:

256 Colors, same Resolution :

MaxonCAD, Big A1-drafting, complete redraw :

CyberGFX        VT-Emu

  12s            15,5s

PageStream 3.0d, whole A4-Side with 3 BitMaps + text :

   8s             7s


The menus under CyberGFX are *much* faster than with VT-Emu or Intuition.

I couldn't resist to do a benchmark with Intuispeed :

There is one thing which troubles me : The slow screen switching under
CyberGFX.  Under VT-Emu it's nice to mix 2-16 color screens with 256 color
screens with the advantage to switch fast between the low-colored screens.
Often I dont need any high-color screen for my actual work.

There is a light !  Speed is *NOT* all.  It's much more important for me
that I can write Software for our A4000 with GVPSpectrum and it runs under
my own Picasso as well.

@node REVIEW7 "Aminet Set Review"
@toc REVIEW

==========================================================================
                           REVIEW: AMINET SET 1
                             @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
==========================================================================

Some people hold that information is power.

If so, the Aminet Set 1 is a nuclear reactor that fits in a double-jewel
box.

The Aminet is something that has for the most part quietly become a huge
repository of Amiga information: games, hacks, utilities, music, and, of
course, online magazines.  There's a romantic story of its growth from a
50 meg partition on an Amiga 3000 to the international monolith it is
today, but that's not the subject of this review.

Besides, you can find that story, along with roughly 900 other documents,
on the Aminet Set 1.

Aminet CDs have been more or less quarterly for over a year now.
Apparently, though, there was demand for more than just the newest
releases-people wanted the boatload.

And a boatload they get.  Broken down into 4 CD-ROMs categorized along
Aminet's primary divisions, and with the newest releases tossed on Disc A
along with "dev"s and "util"s, the Aminet Set gives over 2 gigs of
compressed data (estimated at 4 gigs uncompressed) to its buyers.

The now-familiar AmigaGuide interface for accessing the CDs is present,
allowing the whole of Aminet as of January 1995 to be accessed at will.
While AmigaGuide isn't the prettiest thing on the face of the earth, the
method is sound and efficient, and allows quick access to what you're
looking for, through the Aminet Search utility.  Of course, everything is
structured along the exact same paths as Aminet, so you can browse it with
the method of your choosing.

Complaints?  Very few.  One is that it's missing two back issues of Amiga
Report (as Aminet was up until very recently), but that's nobody's fault
in particular.  Had I been in charge, I might have orgnized the discs
slightly differently, particularly on Disc A, in consideration for BBSes
which have only one CD-ROM drive.

The price is hard to beat-for 59DM (US$40), you're getting one serious
mixed salad collection of software.

Of course, the flip side is that you'll never use all of this material.
But in a pinch for an obscure file, your friends will love you.

Certainly, you can get CD-ROMs with more MODs, more pictures, more
3D-objects...but you probably won't get 4 CDs with such a sampling for
less money.

@toc FTP

TITLE

     C-Shell (csh)

VERSION

     5.40

AUTHOR

     Andreas M. Kirchwitz (csh 5.20+),
     based on csh 5.19 by Urban D. Mueller

     E-Mail: csh-fan@zikzak.in-berlin.de

DESCRIPTION

     C-Shell is a replacement for the AmigaDOS command line interface.
     Many builtin Unix-like commands, very fast script language, file-
     name completion, command-name completion, comfortable command line
     editing, pattern matching, AUX: mode, object oriented file classes,
     abbreviation of internal and external commands.  Supports multiple
     users.

     C-Shell is easy to install and to use.  Online help for all
     commands, functions and various subjects.  ARP-free!

NEW FEATURES

     Changes since version 5.39 (summary):
      - Fixed error message for builtin command "copy": if no special
        error message was available, always the string "(no mem)" was
        output.
      - New placeholders "-1" and "-2" for builtin command "window".
      - Increased maximum value for window dimensions from 1023 to 32767
        for builtin command "window".
      - Environment variables LINES and COLUMNS override window bounds
        from Amiga console.device.
        (if env vars are set, no CSI sequence is sent)
      - Builtin command "mem" now shows size of largest available memory
        block.
      - Various minor changes/enhancements to existing commands.
      - Miscellaneous minor bug fixes.

@toc FTP

TITLE

   ZShell

VERSION

   2.3  (09.02.95)

AUTHOR

   Up to version 1.3:
   Paul Hayter

   From version 2.0 to 2.3:
   Martin Gierich  (uj3w@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de)

DESCRIPTION

   ZShell is a small (30K), fast and powerful Shell with many (65)
   builtin commands. So it replaces most of the commands in the C:
   directory (like LIST, COPY etc.) what effects in saving disk space
   and reducing disk accesses. There is no way around ZShell for
   those who do not have a harddisk or still have Kickstart 1.2/1.3 .

   But it is useful for those with a better Kickstart and/or
   hard disk, too, because for example it has powerful editing &
   history, file name completion, review buffer, some Kickstart
   2.0/3.0 specific features and a lovely LIST command.

   ZShell is inteded for shell users who do not need a script
   file execution which is as complex as a programming language
   (simple script execution with IF, ASK, SKIP etc. is supported).
   I tried to make usage nearly like the AmigaDOS Shell with some
   features known from UN*X Shells but without a confusing variety
   of options ("LIST -R" and "LIST ALL" both work).

   For programmers ZShell has things like showing EXEC-lists and
   the task list, memory dumping and execution checking.

   You can switch off the internal command-line-editor to use
   ZShell with console handlers like KingCON.

   Features:
   * Usage is similar (or better) to the standard AmigaDOS shell.
   * Supports the standard housekeeping commands which are builtin,
     so no disk access is necessary.
     eg. list, dir, cd, assign, delete, copy, move, path, info, type
   * A total of 65 builtin commands.
   * About 30K small (pure assembler code, source included).
   * Starting from Workbench (!) or CLI. No installation needed.
   * File name completion by simply pressing TAB; shows all matches.
   * Review buffer to see again what scrolled out of the window.
   * Some commands and debugging features for programmers.
   * Command line editing better than OS2.0 Shell.
   * Support of OS2.0+ and OS3.0+ specific features.
   * DIR and LIST both sort (by default) and show filesizes.
   * Wild cards and recursive processing.
   * Makes itself resident for quicker starting and memory saving.
   * Real (!) RUN and NEWCLI command that reenters ZShell quickly.
   * Can iconify itself.
   * Simple 'MORE' type text viewer.
   * Online Help function and AmigaGuide documentation with examples.
   * Can create and show Hard- and Softlinks.

NEW FEATURES

   Support of OS2.0+ specific stuff (MALELINK, MAKEICON,
   ASSIGN ADD, Application-Icon etc.).
   Totally rewrote PATH, COPY, DELETE, PROTECT, MOVE and JOIN.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

   None.
   (Works with every Kickstart and does not use
   disk-based libraries.)

DESCRIPTION

    Anyone using the Amiga probably runs into public screens sooner or later.
    Perhaps you are reading this on a public screen right now? Public screens
    are very handy. However, public screens are not as configurable as the
    workbench screen. Most programs that are able to run on a public screen
    have more or less options to configure the looks of the screen they run
    on, but programs capable of adding nice patterns or pictures to the
    screens' background are very rare. The programmers are not to blame, since
    it would be a waste of HD space if every program had all these options
    built-in. Wouldn't it be nice if there was just one small commodity
    capable of opening configurable public screens whenever an application
    needs one, and closing the screen automatically after the application is
    done? This is where `ScreenWizard' steps in.

    Features:

     * `ScreenWizard' consists of a stand-alone preferences program, and a
       small commodity. Once the program is configured, only the
       commodity needs to be resident, eating up very little memory.

     * Screens are opened and closed just as if the screens were opened by
       the programs themselves. So now you can give your favourite editor
       a nice background (instead of the standard boring grey look),
       without the hassle of opening/closing screens yourself (which is
       most common for other public screen managers).

     * Background pictures, as well as background patterns are supported.

     * Very configurable screens: palette, displaymode, drawing pens and
       more, all these can be set after your personal taste.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    Workbench 3.0 or higher.

===========================================================================

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to jcompton@bbs.xnet.com and in the body of the
message ask nicely to be added to the list.

ie: Please add me to the mailing list for Amiga Report magazine.  My
     addresss is <your net address>.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!             **

To circumvent the new pay-per-megabyte system for Australian Internet
communication, Paul Reece has been kind enough to set up an AUSTRALIAN-ONLY
mailing list, to save his fellow countrymen some money.

You can join the list by sending mail to:   majordomo@info.tas.gov.au

==                        UUDecoding Amiga Report                        ==
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

==                    Amiga Report Writing Guidelines                    ==
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your

                The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
          -------------------------------------------------------

Portal is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-service online SIG
(Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users. We promise, and
WE DELIVER ongoing & aggressive Amiga support!

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in many ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA high-speed modems (you pay for the phone call
if it's not local), or though any SprintNet or Compu$erve indial anywhere
(with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell service!  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help, and you can easily customize
it for your favorite terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1000 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
      once, of any size, with one command.
 * Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, Elastic
      Reality (ASDG), Soft-Logik, Apex Publishing, and others.
 * 40 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 10,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.
 * Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
      related and get quick replies from the experts.
 * Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, AMosaic, LightWave, EGS,
      OpalVision & others feed right into the Zone message bases.  Read
      months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

 * A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.
      You can run Amiga Mosaic through your shell and explore the
      vast World Wide Web!

      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine.

      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
      never worry "Ooops... Am I paying for this area?" again!
 * The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)  An 
      entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  And you get FREE unlimited
      usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
      email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
 * Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
      at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
