/// From the Editor's Desk                        "Saying it like it is!"
    ----------------------


We have a new writer this week, who will hopefully become a regular face
around here.  Brian Gawor is the author of our new Zen and the Art of
Desktop Publishing.  It's a very entertaining and informative article.
Even if you don't get into DTP, you should read it.  It's good!

I'd still like to find a few more people interested in regular, or semi-
regular contributions.  I welcome all submissions, so if you have something
you've written, or something you'd like to write, drop me a note.  I'd
like to hear from you!

The Commodore Shareholder Movement is moving right along.  You'll find a
short update from Mike Levin.  Please take a look at it, and pass this info
along to everyone you can.  We'll be having more updates as they become
available!  Remember, get this information out.  If we act together, we can
force Gould and Ali out and turn Commodore into a respectable company again.

I was in Software Etc the other day, and happened to ask the manager if
they had any plans on carrying CD32.  He flatly said NO.  He says Commodore
is a bad business risk.  Same with Atari.  They also have no intention of
carrying the Jaguar.  I can understand them not wanting to carry an Atari
product.  Remember the Lynx?  Well, everybody was carrying it at first --
Toys R Us, Software Etc, Babbages, Electronics Boutique, etc.  Then Atari
decided to cut the price way down, and left everybody with overpriced units
they couldn't sell.  Dealers had to take a big loss to get rid of them, and
swore never again.  Furthermore, the computer dealers have been screwed
again.  Atari has discontinued all Falcon development, and all efforts are
going into Jaguar.  So their 'magnificant' (yeah right) Falcon is sitting
high and dry until Jaguar is out the door in force, which is sometime in
January (maybe).  I feel really sorry for people that have bought Falcons.
And I'm sure glad there's more support for the Amiga!

But anyway, the manager at Software Etc did venture to say that if CD32 and
Jaguar sell well in the USA, they will consider picking up the lines.

/// CPU Status Report                     Late Breaking Industry-Wide News
    -----------------



                      ** Sun to Invest in NeXT **

   Sources say that Sun Microsystems Inc. is ready to invest in Steve
Jobs' NeXT Computer Inc. It's reported that Sun will invest $10 million
in NeXT for 1.5% of the company's stock and access to NeXT technology. A
Sun spokesman told the press the partnership involves Sun investing in
NeXT's object-oriented software development, but declined further
details.

   NeXT initially produced workstations that ran the company's NeXTStep
operating system software, but later withdrew from the hardware business
to focus solely on the NeXTStep software.

   Last spring, Dell Computer Corp., Epson America Inc. and NEC announ-
ced plans to ship products with NeXTStep installed. Hewlett-Packard Co.
also has marketed some PCs with the NeXTStep inside and NeXT's products
also have been backed by Canon Inc. and IBM.


                ** Micron Semi Intros 1MB SRAM Chips **

   Micron Semiconductor has announced engineering samples of its one meg
static random access memory (SRAM) chips for use as cache memory in per-
sonal computers.

   The company says the chips are available in 64kb x 16, 128kb x 8, and
256kb x 4 organizations. The chips use a center-pin power and ground
design Micron says allows faster operation and minimizes noise at the
higher speeds.

   Micron also claims the chips are designed specifically for cache me-
mory in workstations, file servers, desktops, and portable PCs, and will
be available in both five- and 3.3-volt versions.  The five-volt chips
are available in speeds as fast as 12 nanoseconds (ns) and the 3.3-volt
versions in speeds as fast as 15 ns.


           ** Microsoft Co-Founder Buys into Ticketmaster **

   Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, has agreed to buy a majority
share in the parent of Ticketmaster Corp, a leading computerized ticket-
er that serves 2,500 clients in 40 states, Europe, Canada and Australia.

   Paul Allen retired a billionaire from Microsoft in 1983 at the age of
31 and is a major shareholder in America Online, a computer-based infor-
mation service.

   It is thought that Allen probably has some sort of link in mind to
connect Ticketmaster's computerized ticketing and the tens of millions
of personal computers that can tap into it through Amercia Online.

   Sources say that Allen invested well over $300 million in Ticketmast-
er and will probably become Ticketmaster's chairman.


      ** Computer 'Unfaithfulness" Leads to a Divorce Petition **

   An Israeli man seeks a divorce, alleging his wife was unfaithful be-
cause of her use of "filthy computer games."

   Reports say the unidentified man said in a written plea to a Tel Aviv
rabbinical court, "My wife watches a lot of porn movies and what's more
she likes to cheat on me in her thoughts by playing filthy computer
games."

   He added, "There is no difference between a woman who has a physical
relationship with other men and a woman who imagines it."

   The petition called the wife a "theoretical adulteress."

   If the court accepts that the woman has committed adultery, divorce
is granted automatically in Israel where rabbis have a monopoly on mar-
riage, divorce and burial for Jews, practicing or not.


    ** New York Computer Business Owner Arrested for Virus Threat **

   The owner and a technician of a Manhattan computer business have been
charged with threatening to unleash a computer virus that could potenti-
ally do $500,000 in damage to a New York business owner.

   Michael Lafaro, owner of MJL Design, surrendered this week to Nassau
County (New York) police for his role in the plot to force a complaining
client to pay his bills in full.

   The MJL Design technician, John Puzzo, was arrested Nov. 12 after he
removed the virus he allegedly installed at Forecast Inc., a video fur-
niture company in Westbury, N.Y.

   Police said that William Haberman, owner of Forecast, bought a compu-
ter program from MJL Design on Nov. 10, but after complaining to Lafaro
about its effectiveness, he made only a partial payment.

   Lafaro then allegedly had Puzzo install a computer virus and sent
Haberman a message saying that if full payment was not received, the
virus would destroy all data on the computer on Nov. 15. If that hap-
pened, the action would have cost Haberman about $500,000 in damages.

   After contacting police, Haberman was told to pay Lafaro on the con-
dition he Puzzo return to Forecast to remove the virus. When the techni-
cian did this, he was arrested.

   Computer tampering became a felony in New York on Nov. 1.  Coercion
was already a felony.  Each crime carries a penalty of four to seven
years on conviction.


       ** Ambra Targets Power Users With PCI-Based Pentium PCs **

   Ambra Computer, the US IBM spinoff launched last August, has announ-
ced a new line of Pentium computers based on the PCI local bus. The new
PCI-based machines are highly customizable, and targeted at the budget-
conscious enhanced or "power" user, according to Craig Conrad, a company
spokesperson.

   At the low end of the new Ambra DP60 PCI lineup is a machine that of-
fers a 60mhz superscalar Pentium processor, a 340-meg hard drive, 8 megs
of memory, a 256k processor cache, a 3.5-inch diskette drive, seven ex-
pansion slots, six storage bays, a PCI graphics accelerator, and a 14-
inch Super VGA color monitor. Also included are MS-DOS, Microsoft Win-
dows, a mouse, and a keyboard, for a total price of $2,799.

   A high-end model, priced at $3,499, substitutes a 440-meg hard drive
and 15-inch flat-square monitor, while adding a double-speed CD-ROM
(compact disc - read only memory) drive and Diamond Viper PCI graphics
accelerator complete with 2-meg of video-random access memory (VRAM).


         ** Rebate Offered on ClarisWorks and Quicken Bundle **

   Claris Corp. this week announced a rebate offer on ClarisWorks for
Windows.

   Customers who purchase ClarisWorks for Windows bundled with Intuit's
Quicken finance program will receive a $50 rebate directly from Claris.
The offer will be available in the U.S. through Jan. 31, 1994, when the
bundling promotion ends.

   The ClarisWorks-Quicken for Windows bundle is currently available at
Claris' authorized resellers for a suggested promotional price of $129.
With the rebate, the price to the user comes down to $79.


    ** Apple, Two Others to Distribute Catalogs on Compact Discs **


   Distributing mail-order catalogs on Macintosh-compatible compact
discs is the goal of a project dubbed En Passant being launched by Apple
Computer Inc. and two other companies.  Reports say Apple will distri-
bute its first disc to 22,000 homes and 8,000 businesses next month.

   Offered on the CD-ROM discs will be products from 21 catalogs, in-
cluding Lands' End Inc., Patagonia Inc., L.L. Bean Inc. and Tiffany &
Co., as well as Apple.

   The disc is designed to run only on Macintosh systems, but backers
says if the test is successful, Apple will design a similar marketing
system for the computers running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating
system.

   Working with Apple will be Electronic Data Systems Corp., which will
provide a phone exchange system for the venture, and Redgate
Communications Corp., which will put together the disc contents.


   ** Apple, Fujitsu to Work Together on CD-Rom Software Projects **

   Apple Japan Inc. and Fujitsu Ltd. are going to work together to de-
velop compatible applications for Apple's Macintosh and Fujitsu's FM
TOWNS platforms, first by exchanging proprietary program data.

   Reports say Apple and Fujitsu also will trade data on the distribu-
tion of CD-ROM titles to foster a growing multimedia environment.


               ** Aldus Ships FreeHand 4.0 for the Mac **


   Aldus Corp. this week announced it has begun shipment of Aldus Free-
Hand 4.0 for the Apple Macintosh, a major upgrade to its advanced
graphic design and illustration software program.

   The software's new capabilities include enhanced text controls, in-
tuitive color controls, a streamlined user interface, extensive graphic
capabilities and multi-page layout functions.

   Aldus FreeHand 4.0 for the Apple Macintosh is System 7 - savvy. The
recommended system configuration is any Apple Mac IIci series or great-
er, PowerBook, Macintosh Quadra, 8MB of RAM, a 120MB hard drive, a mouse
or a drawing digitizing tablet with stylus.

   Availability and pricing Aldus FreeHand 4.0 for the Macintosh costs
$595. Registered users of prior versions can upgrade for $150.


                      ** New Macintosh Products **

   Here is a brief look at some new Macintosh products on the market:
File Clerk software, ColorScript Laser1000 printer, PowerBook 145B Plus
Pack, Americans in Space CD-ROM, new Adobe Typefaces.

   Nisus Software announced File Clerk, software due this fall designed
to make it easier to track down information on data-packed Macs.

   To organize and retrieve files, users navigate through a hierarchy of
keywords assigned to files, selected through pop-up menus. These des-
criptive keywords are pre-assigned to files using File Clerk. The file
selection list shrinks as more keywords are chosen in a search. This
list can be filtered by creator, volume and creation/modification date
as well. Once found, the file, whether text, graphics, sound or video,
can be previewed or launched. Suggested list will be under $100. For
more information, call 619/481-1477.

   ColorScript Laser1000 - QMS is shipping a $12,499 color laser prin-
ter, and claiming a price that is half that of competing products. It
features four-color 300dpi laser printing, color matching capabilities
and PostScript Level 2 emulation. It prints 24-bit-color images as
halftones, instead of as continuous-tone color images, with a printing
speed of two to eight pages per minute. Sixty-five resident typefaces
and 12MB of RAM are standard. Mobile, Ala.-based QMS can be reached at
800/523-2696 or 215/633-4300.

   This PowerBook 145 package, distributed through such channels as Cir-
cuit City, Montgomery Ward, Best Buy, Staples, and Officemax, combines a
4/80 PowerBook 145B with an internal Global Village Powerport Bronze
send/receive fax/modem and a software bundle. The software includes

terminal emulation software. Prices in the retail outlets are expected
to be between $1,549 and $1,699. For info, call Apple at 800/776-2333.

DESCRIPTION

Adorage is a 2D animation package, offering a range of video-effects from
simple fade-in and fade-out to more complex effects such as page-flips and
explosions.  Selection and implementation of these F/X is icon-driven and
very easy.  Adorage partially supports the SSA (super smooth animation)
standard which allows the playback of animations up to 60 fields per
second, and is AGA compatible.  Adorage scene transitions are very fast due
to algorithms developed for this purpose.

FEATURES 

     * 3D effect groups (spirals, cubes, comet,...)
     * user definable parameters for most effects, creating a
       virtually unlimited number of parameters  
     * Icon driven user interface is very user-friendly, even for
       beginners
     * Supports AGA and automatically configurs for the
       processor type present
     * Most effects (even 3D effects) don't require
       pre-rendering
     * Very fast, even on slower Amigas
     * Great number of effects


RECOMMENDED 

Workbench V2.X+, Kickstart V2.04+, 3MB RAM, Hard disk

DESCRIPTION

Faster than any other anim-player, thanks to especially developed
algorithms which are definable for different configurations.  Clarissa
automatically optimizes anims so that they can be played back at the
highest possible speeds.  The SSA animation format eliminates most of the
problems normally encountered when playing back 2D and 3D animations (slow
play back, jerky movement, etc...)

FEATURES 

     * 30% Higher playback rate as opposed to other
       anim-players
     * Integrated virtual memory feature (which works even
       without an MMU) allows playback and editing of large 
       animations.
     * Cut and Paste function, with graphic display of
       animations, allows easy editing
     * Dynamic anim-clipboard functions allow for inserting or
       deleting of frames or ranges of frames, creating pauses
       within an animation and many more professional 
       manipulations
     * 20% speed increase when loading or saving anims
     * Lace compensation calculates the animation in half the
       vertical resolution and plays back in full resolution,
       giving a 50% increase in speed when creating
       animations.
     * Stand alone anim-player included. This player is a CLI
       command, usable from within every multimedia package.

         » 24-Bit Realtime Animation Playback with Sound Support «
                              From Terra Nova

Magic Lantern is a program designed to create, edit and display delta
compressed animations in real time.  It takes as input IFF picture
and sound files created from other sources (such as DPaint, Imagine,
Lightwave, Real-3d, etc) and creates animations that run on various
frame buffers in up to 24 bit color.  Magic Lantern plays sound
effects through the Amiga sound chip.

Once an animation is created, it can be edited; such editing might
include adding or removing sound effects and frames, or moving frames
around.  All of these functions are accessible through a very
friendly, Workbench 2.0 compliant graphical user interface, and/or an
ARexx port.  Lantern also provides a means to create animations that
are larger than available memory, and a separate utility to play them
back from disk.

The ARexx port was designed to allow the user to do anything that
he/she could do through the graphical user interface; this allows the
user to create powerful, automated scripts for batch processing or
other uses which the developers of Lantern did not foresee.

Magic Lantern includes highly optimized assembly language routines
for playing back animations on supported display devices, including
frame buffers which store pixels in chunky format.  The program also
provides numerous compression options which allow the user to
optimize animations for size, playback speed or both.  Due to its
modular nature, Magic Lantern can be updated to support new display
devices as they become available.

Features:

· Supports the Retina in 8, 16 and 24 bit modes
· Supports the Picasso II in 8, 16 and 24 bit modes
· Supports the Opal Vision in 8, 15 and 24 bit modes
· Supports the GDA in 8 bit mode
· Supports the Amiga custom chipset, including all AGA modes, DCTV,
  HamE, etc.
· Over 10 different compression algorithms
· Synchronizes sound to the animation
· Can enforce a playback rate
· Hard drive playback of animations
· ARexx port, assembly language animation routines, breaks up
  animations into IFF components, much more.

Coming soon:  Support for Spectrum, Picallo, Merlin and EGS!

Magic Lantern is now available from Terra Nova Development for $95
(US funds, check or money order), postpaid.  California residents add
$6.89 state sales tax.

@node P1-4 "VxP500 Video Record and Playback Processor"
@toc "menu"


              » VxP500 Video Record and Playback Processor «


   At Comdex this year, AuraVision unveiled the VxP500 Video Record and
Playback Processor, a product that incorporates far-reaching PC video
processing functionality in a single chip.

   Also at the show, Creative Labs, Dolch Computers, Diamond Computer
Systems, and a dozen other vendors have introduced the first PC video
boards to be based on AuraVision's new integrated circuit (IC).

   Microsoft, Adobe, Asymetrix, Xing Technologies, Mathematics, Canyon,
and Lenel have announced software support for the chip. SGS-Thomson, C-
Cube, and Zoran have also hopped aboard the AuraVision bandwagon, deve-
loping reference designs for building complete PC compression systems
with the VxP500.

   The new VxP500 supplies all the capabilities of a traditional board-
level video processor and more, explained Steve Chan, president and
founder of AuraVision.

   The chip is equipped with hardware acceleration capabilities that al-
low full-motion (30-frame-per-second) video to be displayed at full-
screen resolution without the usual visual degradation, said Mark
Hopper, sales director for the Fremont-CA-based startup company. The
product also features a unique time scaling feature that eliminates the
"jerkiness" of motion common to other systems, he maintained.

   Although separate audio hardware is still needed, the VxP500 allows
simultaneous capture of video and audio in real time, added Tommy Lee,
senior applications manager. In contrast, other processors require video
and audio to be captured in different sessions.

   Also unlike competing video processing systems, the VxP500 supports
color keying as well as chroma keying, according to Lee. Color keying
refers to overlaying graphics on top of video, while chroma keying
refers to overlaying video on top of graphics.

   By integrating all video processing into a single IC, the VxP500 sup-
plies cost savings to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that will
in turn be passed on to end users, Lee said.

   The price of the VxP500 to OEMs is less than $100, and boards based
on the chips will sell to end users for as low as $300, he estimated.
"In comparison, (other) boards now on the market cost $400 or more, and
the quality of their output isn't nearly as high," he asserted.

   The VxP500 can capture video in RGB, Palettized VGA, YUV, and YUV
com-pressed formats under Microsoft Video for Windows, and in RGB, YUV,
and Palettized VGA formats under AVI. Support is provided for all AVI
video codecs, including JPEG, MPEG, Indeo, Cinepak, and Captain Crunch.

   The VxP500 also supports VGA, NTSC, and PAL input, and VGA, NTSC, and
Control/L (LANC) videotape output. NTSC support is available for both
the composite video and S-Video formats. The chip permits display of up
to 16 million colors at up to 1024-by-786 resolution, he said.

   AuraVision's hardware zoom technique allows the picture to be
expanded without graininess, he explained. The use of vertical
interpolation reduces "motion artifacts," or ghosts, and also promotes
more realistic colors.

   Video for Windows software, available to OEMs for bundling with
VxP500-based boards, makes it possible to capture audio from a separate
sound board into a .wav file and to combine the video and audio in an
interleaved format for synchronized playback, he said.

   The chip's time scaling feature comes into play when a system lacks
sufficient bandwidth to store 30-frame-per-second video, according to
Lee. Video processing systems deal with this situation by dropping some
of the frames. Time scaling is designed to drop frames in a smooth and
even way.

   In a press conference at Comdex, Orchid Technologies rolled out a
whole family of VxP500-based boards, including the Vidiola Pro/D full
digital video editing; the Vidiola Pro/C for "cuts only" video editing
without hard disk video storage; and the Vidiola Premium, a daughter
board supplying MJPEG (motion JPEG) compression and decompression.

   Aside from Orchid, Creative Labs, Dolch, and Diamond, other OEMs
announcing VxP500-based boards at Comdex included U-Max Data Systems,
Micro Star, Hauppauge Computer Works, CEI, GVC Technologies, VisionEx,
Micro Star, ASCO Corp., Leadtech Research, Lung HWA Corp., and Resonant
Research.

   In addition to Microsoft's Video for Windows, the following third-
party software is available to OEMs for bundling with the boards:
Premier for Windows and Photoshop from Adobe; Compel and MediaBlitz!
from Asymetrix; Lenel's Multimedia Manager; Xing Technology's Picture
Prowler and MPEG Prowler; Mathematica's Tempra Pro authoring package;
and ICap video capture software from Canyon.

   The VxP500 is the first product to be released by AuraVision, a com-
pany established by Chan in July 1992. Chan had previously served as
corporate VP and general manager at Chips & Technologies, VP of
engineering for Headland Technology, VP of ASIC design for LSI Logic,
and staff engineer at Ampex Corp.

@toc "menu"


             » Philips Confused Over Matsushita CD-I Reports «


UNION CITY, NEW JERSEY, U.S.A., 1993 DEC 1 (NB) -- Despite widespread
reports to the contrary, Tokyo headquartered Matsushita Electric
Industrial Company, says it has no intention of abandoning the Compact
Disc-Interactive (CD-I) format.  Matsushita appears to have made a
long-term commitment to the manufacture of the 3DO player and CD-I
manufacturer  Philips said it finds Matsushita's statements confusing.

Telegraaf, an Amsterdam newspaper, claims a research and development
director at Matsushita said CD-I was "dated" and was being abandoned in
favor of the newer 3DO format. Several other publications are echoing
the report as well.

However, Matsushita says any reports concerning the abandonment of CD-I
are erroneous. Company representatives emphatically stated that
Matsushita has not stopped developing CD-I and has no intention of
stopping CD-I development.

Representatives from Philips said they are confused as to why
Matsushita feels a need to make a statement concerning CD-I, either
positive or negative. They say the statement is even more puzzling
considering the fact that Matsushita has never brought a CD-I player to
the US market, despite its repeated displays of prototype units at CD-I
trade shows.

A representative at Matsushita told Newsbytes the report appears to be
amisunderstanding. However, the New York Times said Wall Street analysts
are advising clients to sell their 3DO stock now, at a loss, because of
concern that 3DO might not be able to live up to its high claims.
Software developers for the 3DO platform have quietly expressed similar
concerns to Newsbytes.

San Mateo, California-based 3DO, started by Electronic Arts founder
Tripp Hawkins, went public this year without a product and was
enthusiastically greeted by Wall Street. Matsushita picked up the
manufacture of the hardware for the platform and is manufacturing it
under the brand name Panasonic. Contrary to its flying start, 3DO
appears to be struggling. The company reported losses so far this year
and is now in a quiet period upon the issuance of more stock.

CD-I was introduced nearly three years ago, but now has a broad base of
titles available and also offers playback of popular movies on CD
through a partnership with Paramount. Philips is also advertising
heavily in the form of "infomercials" concerning the CD-I player and
products. 3DO is using a similar approach to advertise its product, but
only four titles are available for the unit to date though more are
promised soon.

Niagara Amiga (Users) Group N.A.G. (Canada) - BIG THANKS
Julla O. Kouppinen (Finland) A long distance thanks very much!

(This is finally getting international.... Where's Hong Kong??)

Interesting, some of the donors who feel thanks enough to reach into their 
pockets and join the drive.  Total donations as of 11/14/93 are $436.50. Got 
a ways to go folks to purchase the (?A4000T?). There is pretty reliable info
that FFish does in fact already own an A4000 (shoot!).  Suggestions???  
Please talk this up with all concerned (Amiga users) and pass the word on to 
your Users Groups. If you haven't joined the effort, slip that hand into the 
pocket and pull out some bucks, put it into any envelope and send it in.  
Let's show what the Amiga community is all about. Check over some of the
programs you have benefitted/are benefitting from.  Register them and/or 
pitch in for FishFund. 

* Reminder to everyone PLEASE!!!  Pass the word at any Users Group meetings y
ou attend.  This should be a group effort on behalf of all the Amiga users
throughout the world. Please donate whatever you can afford - or even better,
what you honestly think FFish's work has been worth to you through the years. 
You think speed kills?  Try apathy!  Let's make this thing happen. Thanks. 
BTW, there have been some very nice comments to/about FFish included in the
envelopes with donations.  As I have been saving these, think I will include 
them along with the donation "pot"/A4000T when the time comes.

*** Subj: HACKER ON THE LOOSE!!!!

I would like to warn all of you of a BAD hacker (there are good ones and I'm
proof of that).  He decided to break into my system (probably using a word
cypher though he won't admit to it).

I got luck and caught him while he was online and here is the excerpt of the
log:


ME>so who guessed my password :)

HIM>hhehe, just your friendly neighbor hacker, oh, and a real hacker doesn't
GUESS passwords

ME>:) So either someone who found it somewhere like where though :)

HIM>oh, a good hacker  doesn't reveal his secrets either, and I hate you dam
amercian sysops, you guys stay home to much, 

ME>?

HIM>ah nothing

ME>So Mr. cracker (hackers are useful :) who are you anyway, not that I'm
upset since I knew that the password would get broken sooner or later... 
Main reason there is nothing but BBS stuff on this machine :)

ME>well, please to term me a cracker, I am not, I go by the name, "The Moz", I
assume you will be hearing a lot about me in the coming days, as I have
figured out a method to infiltrate ANY amiga based BBS, but seeing how nice I
am I haven't destroyed anyting. I have been doing this for about a half year
and just now when an american sysop cauht me a couple of days ago I decided to
go to town, not wrrying my little precious face about when the sysops might be
up

ED: Anyone who breaks into a system that is protected from unlawful entry is a
cracker.  IE Safe CRACKER.

ME>:)  No, wont bother me anyway...  If it is a hole in DLG I can believe it. 
not bothered to see if there is one.  Yea I cought ya two ways... one I don't
log in remote anymore because I don't have that need (I'm here enough to use
the local terminal) and second it is the holidays so I was wondering why it
seemed someone was calling back a few times (like a bad LD connection).

HIM> it is holiday?

ME>Turkey day here in US.  I have paid vacation from Yesterday, today and then
the weekend (4days).

HIM> oh btw it is not a hole as you put it in DLG, this method I have come to
use on DLG E! CNET and my personal favorite Xenolink

ME> OK.  So you have a word cypher or something then?

HIM> oooooh, no no, much simpler he he, but I digress

ED: Only other thing I could think of is a hold in TRAPDOOR.

ME> OK.  Well anyway, I guess I'll have to make it more fun next time.  BTW
there won't be much to find on the BBS cept PD stuff.  I don't get into
cracking preaking or pirating.  Just a good ol' clean BBS.  The A4000 and
the A500 on the next desk are where the goodies are stored (all 700megs not
including two 1.3 gig tapes).

HIM> are you ready to play The Moz's "Let's make a deal?"

ME> ??

HIM>This is the deal, ok, I can get into your system no matter what you do,
this is fact, I do not destroy systems, I take files, look around and
leave. ok got that, this is the deal, you will not mention this to anyone,
as I monitor all DLG/ and sysops echos (yes your echo :), If I find you do,
I will (hate to say it) delete everything on your hd, no prelblem since you
have backups you say, but I will also insall my time-release viruses and
sooner or later you will tire of backing up, so.... you say nothing, and I
promise never to return to your system

ME>I don't take kind to threats.  Since I am clean.  I will simply call FCC,
BELL and INTERPOL and leave it up to them.  As for backups and tapes, well go
ahead.  I have 10 backups of the BBS dated a week apart and I will simply
install a previous one eacy time and the virus will never show up.  Now that
you have warned me.  That is exactly what I will do (for the BBS software).  I
can back up files seperatly and since I'm too busy to bother downliading and
unarching all files in the BBS I will never catch your virus. My users may but
not me.

ME>Sorry.  Had you asked simply for to mess around without me knowing that you
were getting in (that is if you get in and I don't catch you then there is not
much I can do except say, Moz got in again ah well.  But now that you have
threatend me.  I don't think I can take that lightly.

ME> Ah so now I know :)

HIM> no what?

ME> :) Oh I don't know.  Whatever.  I just got my new secure digital phones
for voice now I guess I gotta get rest of stuff secure :)

ED: I forgot to tell him that one of my customers is US Secret service.  They
will love it when I tell them I got a euro hacker breaking into one of my
systems!

HIM>he he, yes I have all your users password, just thought I'd let you know.
Did you hang up on me??

ME>I don't take to threats and if threated I call frends who have power to
hurt those that threaten.  You have their passwords?  How?  I will have to
check the logs again but I don't see any downloads from CLI ...

HIM>I deleted your logs

ME>You did?  Na, I'm not sure about that.  If you did then you left the logs
exactly right from the last time I allowd somone to transfer a file from
CLI :)

ED: he did not know I rewrote XPRTRANSFER and a few other programs to create
their own logs of usage.  He did delete my TRAPDOOR and normal DLG and DLGMAIL
logs.

HIM> hmm, well I'm gonna say how I did it, nut anyways, I will explain to you
why I threaten you, you see, if this method gets out, other hackers will
figure it out as well, I and I know many hundreds of sysops don't want this,
this is why I ask you know to say anything, if you do, the method MAY b
discovered, as of now, I am very sure I am the only one who knows how to do
this

HIM>hello

ME>Sorry got distracted looking at my logs again :)  No, I will not leak such
things.  I don't like to propagate insanity and that is exactly what would
happen... Now if this were how to break into MAXIMUS or some other IBM board
:) nope, only amiga sosrry

ME> :)  I mean then it may pay to get back at the IBM guys :)  Nah, I'm not
that cruel either.  I'm the type that could write a virus but instead try
to do some other clever stuff at the low level (useful)...

HIM>hmm, well anyway, I am glad you understand, but I'm not sure, there are
other systems, that I have hacked, and did not get a chance to clean-up my
work, so the word maybe getting out soon. I will ask if I may finish the
download on the file

ED: check your files guys.

ME> The file?  which file?

HIM> I was downoading the dlg_099 bbs archive, I have mostofit already

ME> I would rather you do not.  It *IS* my BBS minus the security keys.

HIM>I already have manypeoples security keys, I just want the newest version
of DLG, I ru Xenolink, but I like to mess around with DLG

ME>The newest is 1.0 and that is what I'm running now.

HIM>can you give me the archive?

ME> It is not archived.  I installed it from the disks I just got.

HIM>ah, it would be nice to have the  disk archives :)

ME>:)  Yea not sure I want to archive those since I know they will have my
keys in them and they also may be hidden on the disk in other places.  You
know those DLG boys they were veminent about pirating their stuff.

HIM>yeah ok well I understand, I just didn't want to go hack another DLG board
for it, but I guess I will have to eh? Oh by the way, I like your lha.key "For
everyone" haaha

ME>Yea I need to change that.  I got that from someone before I realized that
the keyfile was ripped.  I will probably drop back to 1.38 since it works well
or I will try to get the UNIX version to compile again.  I got close the last
time. 

HIM>well, I guess if you will not give me the dlg disk, I will be leaving, on
to yet another system, maybe DLG HQ
:) 

HIM>:)  If you can get it from there then I guess you deserve to have it in
your posession!  No, I'd rather not distribute the BBS.  If it were some
other application, maybe, but the BBS is kinda vital (same can be said
about my C compiler).

HIM>hehe yes, I've been looking at the c source for your gwterm and I guess
your starting a rIpterm, 

ED: A mistake I had copied the entire dir to the BBS when I transfered an
older version to the BBS.  If he looks closly he will see the executable does
not match the sources.

ME> Yea.  It's been postponed by another program (a more commercial venture),
however this holiday will get me some time to work on it and some of the other
PD/share/free programs I have.

HIM>do you have the bbs number for tpt tech?

ME>Hold.  I know it is in nodelist
403-347-3262 is HST

HIM>this is cannpij pidj dpij

HIM>this is canada??

ME>Yes 403-347-3269 is v32 not sure if it is .bis 14.4 I think it is.

HIM>ah nevermind, let's just say Canada's phone system is a little more
"ambitous" for my taste

ED: Damn.  I was hoping he would try so I could tel TPT to double capture all
logs.

ME>:)  Yea I hear ya.  I'm not sure how much longer ma-bell and all the other
junk (sprint/mci) will finally decide to catch up and attempt to be modern.
 Its a joke to see how bad the security of those systems are.  And living
here in Ft LauderDale I've discovered that a guy down the street has been
listening in on other folks cordless conversations (not that I also do that
:) but he has equipment to also TALK on the same freqs and thus if someone
leaves their hand set off the charger, well then he could make some free
phone calls :)

HIM> he he, well I guess I will be off, I may come and "visit" sometime in the
future

ME> Just leave a note if you get in.  If you are able I cannot really stop
you, but I'd just like to know if you did.  You don't have to say when but
just so I' wont get confused when I see that I dropped to dos when I havent :)

HIM> well, I'll leave your logs alone next time

HIM> OK.  That'll help.  Thanks for being honest about being the one who
did... Of couse if you really have all the passwords how do I know this is
really you :)  ANyway... You never did say how you got in...

HIM> haha and I never will (Actually when all my funis over, I will be
anonymously netmailing all bbs authors and a "fix")

ED: all authors?  so is it a TD thing or a BBS thing?

ME> OK.  That should be adquate.  Sounds like your just having fun.  Just
don't make it too expensive on the phone companies here.  I don't want to see
my phone rates go up! :)

HIM> eh, I pay for my calls. 

ED: Then why was he scared to call canada?

ME> OK.  Well then it is really for the fun of it then eh.  OK.. WIll let you
go find another system.   Thanks for not taking too much from this one.

HIM> :0

So now that you have seen this I wonder how many other systems he has gotten
into.

I have called the FCC and the local BELL (Actually got someone on the
holiday!).  And I will be talking to my friends in some of the other federal
departments (esp Secret Service) as the last thing I need is someone trying to
break into my systems.

To prevent phone phreaking and credit card fraud, I have informed MCI and BELL
of numbers I call, what times and for how long on both data and voice.  I have
frozen my credit cards and all other credit.  Don't need them anymore since I
now have a more steady paycheck :).

I have changed my BBS so that even I do not have SYSOP or drop to dos
capabilities.  This will BITE when I want to change/add/delete menus or
validate files, however I will be writing some utilities to allow me to do
this only on this machine.

This guy has me really pissed.  First he guesses (cracks guesses cyphers all
the same) a really good password, then he tries to rip off my software, then
he threatens me which all causes me to remove my own privledges (remote sysop
accesses) just to protect me from him.

Well I will have to wait and see if he gets in again.  In the mean time I have
protected the BBS by making it so NO-ONE, not even myself, has the right to
drop to dos.  NO-ONE, not even myself has the right to the SYSOP MENUS to
change/edit a user account so they can drop to dos.

As for the VIRUSES, I have a way around that as well.  Even if he gets in, he
will not be able to change any of the BBS's executables (no it is not C:LOCK,
or C:PROTECT since I know you are reading this echo). I'll keep this one
underhat.  All I will say is that only I will be able to protect the
executables this way.

I'm one who likes low level system stuff so I will be writing some special
software to monitor breakins (the XPRTRANSFER and other loggers were written
to monitor some of my co-sysops in IOWA and they just happen to see what was
going on so there will be other tasks I will write to monitor and log
discretely other activities such as dos command execution and what tasks
spawned other tasks and such.

So be warned that there is someone out there trying to crack in and steal your
software!

I'm waiting to see this guy come back and mess with this system.  I love
dealing with law enforcment agencies.

    ------------------------

PRODUCT NAME

        Frontier (also known as Elite II)


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

        Frontier is a space exploration/trading/shoot-em-up game that is a
sequel to "Elite," a very successful program available for a number of
computing platforms.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

        Name:           GameTek UK (Konami is also mentioned)
        Address:        5 Bath Road, Slough,
                        Berks SL1 3UA
                        England

        Telephone:      None supplied
        FAX:            None supplied


LIST PRICE

        I paid $69.95 (Australian) for this product from a local computer
software shop.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE

                1 MB of RAM is required.

                Works with all Amigas.  68020 CPU and upwards provide
                smoother animations and better detail, but the gameplay is
                supposedly the same on any CPU.


        SOFTWARE

                Works under all Kickstart versions.  The program does not use
                the operating system, and will not multitask.

                The program requires a stack of at least 70,000 bytes, but
                most people feel safer with a stack setting of 100,000 bytes.


COPY PROTECTION

        "Look up a word in the manual" protection.

        The program is hard drive installable, but works from floppies.  The
program is a single executable.

        Save-game data can be saved on any read/write device.  (Floppy, hard
drive, recoverable RAM disk, etc.)

        The copy protection mechanism gets a rating of "acceptable":  you
notice it, but it is not too bad.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        Amiga 4000/40
        2MB Chip RAM, 4MB 16bit Fast RAM, 16MB 32bit Fast RAM
        Kickstart 39.106, Workbench 39.29
        1.1 gigabytes of hard disk space


INSTALLATION

        The program may be played by booting on the master floppy disk, or it
can be copied to the hard disk by any normal Amiga mechanism (drop the icon,
use the Copy command, or use a directory utility program such as Directory
Opus).

        This is a very simple operation.  Anyone who has used an Amiga for
more than 30 minutes should be able to cope.  I created a Frontier directory
on my GAMES:  partition, and copied the executable and the six "saved game"
files into this directory.


REVIEW

        Years ago, my father raved about a game he was playing called
Elite.  I didn't take much notice, at the time, until I saw it available
for the Amiga.  I purchased it and was entranced.  Although I didn't get
anywhere near the rank of Elite, due to an unfortunate conflict between the
game and my Amiga 1000, I did have a great deal of fun and "wasted" many
hours playing the game.

        Late in 1992, the British computing magazine "The One" had an
interview with David Braben, the programmer of Elite, and revealed that he
was working on the successor to Elite, with the inspiring title of "Elite
II."  The working title was revised to be "Frontier" sometime in late 1992.

        Rumours of this game's existence and "imminent release" were rife
within the comp.sys.amiga.games newsgroup, but the official news was always
bad, with unexpected delays, and broken release-date promises galore.  Then,
the Frontier demo was uploaded to the Aminet ftp sites and much ooh-ing and
ahh-ing (and slamming of the demo for being lame) was to be heard.  The demo
turned out to be the opening sequence for the game itself, and sparked off a
huge discussion in comp.sys.amiga.games.

        Eventually, news came from people who had actually seen and played
the game.  The rush was on; and after a few weeks of scouring the local
scene, I finally acquired a copy from a local computer software shop.  The
installation was a breeze; once done, I put the original disks away in their
box, and set about playing the game.

        Commander Dac, in charge of his shiny inherited Eagle Long Range
fighter, snapped into existence.  Firing away with his powerful engines, he
took off from the spaceport on the planet Ross, and was promptly shot down
by hordes of angry police ships, sent by a militant base commander who was
offended by my lack of manners in not asking for take off clearance.

        Game time: two minutes.  Real time: five minutes.  And I was toast.
A quick succession of restarting the game, and wild attempts to evade
authority always ended up with my being declared a criminal and getting shot
down by the atrociously piloted police ships.  I decided that asking for
clearance to take off isn't just a formality, it's the LAW.  Later on in the
game, when I accrued some fines for doing something considered illegal, I
managed to evade the police ships and escape; however, I was spontaneously
killed for not obeying the police, whilst minding my own business beside an
asteroid, trying to blow it to smithereens.  The moral is PAY YOUR FINES!
The game isn't lenient here:  you either pay your fines, or you die.

        Frontier is based on the same principles as Elite.  You have a
spaceship with a Hyperdrive, and you carry cargo from one planet or
spaceport to another, hoping to make a profit in the process.  On the way,
you meet with other spacefarers, most of whom look at you and decide that
you're easy pickings, and start shooting first.  They do not desist until you
obliterate them or they destroy you.  Space combat is an integral part of
the game.  During the early stages it is very difficult to fight other
spaceships - your firepower is limited to a 1-MWatt pulse laser that fires
once every 5/8ths of a second, and you have no shields to protect you from
the clumsy pilots of other spaceships.

        Later, combat becomes less life-threatening and more tedious.  With
a 20-MWatt beam laser, you rarely get touched before you've atomised any
prospective opponents.  However, "rarely" doesn't mean "never."  Sometimes,
you get only a blip of a warning, and you're suddenly breathing space, and
the dreaded "Game Over" tombstone is on your screen.

        Tactics and weaponry play an important part in the game.  I find
combat to be quite a simple affair these days with my 4-MWatt continuous
beam laser.  Some people think combat is too easy, and they even go back to
1-MWatt pulse lasers to have some challenge.  I think they're ego-tripping
though.

        Getting to where you want to go is one of the main problems with
Elite.  Your interplanetary systems can get you going only a few thousand
kilometers per second.  Distances within solar systems are realistically
portrayed in Astronomical Units or AU's (one AU is the distance from the
Earth to the Sun, or about 150,000,000 kilometers).  Travelling more than 50
AU's is a tedious process.

        The system map is a scalable, three-dimensional representation of the
various stars, planets, satellites and space stations in your star system.
The mouse controls your point of view.  Zooming is accomplished using the
function keys F7 or F8, or by clicking on their icons on the screen.
Everything "works" in the system map - you can watch moons orbiting planets,
and planets orbiting stars, and other spaceships going about their
business.  All of this functionality is fairly intuitive.  Braben has
supplied an option to reverse the left/right up/down function of the mouse
if "real motion" confuses you.  You can zoom in to look at planets, and then
look at the surface of the planet and see starports.  Orbital starports or
orbital cities are also displayed, with movement in real or accelerated time
so you can plan how to get there in the least amount of time.

        Frontier's galactic map is huge.  The galaxy is about 75,000 light
years across in this game, and the central part of the galaxy has many star
systems within a light year of each other.  Navigation is fairly simple, but
there doesn't seem to be much out there to look for outside of the Core
systems and the Imperial sector.

        The responsiveness when updating in the system display is very
pleasing.  Details such as gas-giant rings are visible, with background
scenery (space dust, stars, motion indicators) selectable on or off, in the
main program options page.  Zooming in on planets, asteroids, space stations
or other spaceships is all possible.  So is communication, but this aspect
of the game is very limited.

        The premise of Frontier is trading between the two star-faring
groups - the Core Systems, centred on Sol, and the Imperial Sytems, centred
on Achenar.  The Imperials are wholly capitalist:  almost nothing is banned,
and police protection must be purchased.  Lots of contraband items are
available - drugs, slaves, weapons - and life can get hectic, due to the
increased pirate activity in Imperial space.  The Core systems are more
"refined" and actively clamp down on drug-runners and slave dealers.  Do not
go to a Core system with a hold full of slaves!

        Each faction has a ratings system - the Imperial side choosing
serfs, squires, prince and that sort of thing, whilst the Core systems have
Colonels and Majors etc.  Acquiring medals, awards, and passes is almost
essential to advance in the game.

        Ship types are many and varied, ranging from 4 tonne planet hoppers,
with only interplanetary drives, to 2,000 tonne cargo behemoths (which turn
really slowly, and chew through fuel like it was going out of fashion).

        A very large ship will cost you about 500,000 credits.  Considering
you start off with 100 credits, this might take a while to acquire (if it
weren't for the bugs... see below).

        Some trade runs are extremely profitable, and these sort of runs
will be your bread and butter for the first few hours of the game.  You
upgrade your ship with bigger and better weapons, defenses, and add-ons such
as scanners, radar viewers for scanning other ships, Electronic Counter
Measures to foil missiles, automatic hull repair systems, and Large Plasma
Accelerators (weighing in at 900 tonnes!).

        The game supplies you with a seemingly endless stream of hopelessly
piloted enemies who seek to destroy your ship.  With adequate shields and
a steady hand, you can wipe out most opposition easily.  But not all
opponents are braindead.  Some are plain deadly, and running away would be
the best option when you encounter them with their shielded ships and
20-MWatt beam lasers.

        Frontier has a huge scope, but most players I know have expressed
some disappointment that 99% of the galaxy is either unexplored or
uninhabited.

        In this review, I haven't discussed the special missions you can
take, the "small parcel" deliveries, paid passenger services, assassination
offers, military missions, mining asteroids, mining planets, blowing up Lynx
bulk Ore carriers, the way the police Vipers tend to crash into each other,
the penalty for not having atmospheric shields, or how simple it is to die
repeatedly in situations that are seemingly standard fare.  I do hope I've
given some useful information to some people though.

        The bugs can be irritating.  The flight simulation is excellently
handled with Braben's smooth 3D graphics engine.

        I like this game a lot, and recommend that any ex-Elite players
check out this game.


DOCUMENTATION

        Frontier comes with three manuals and a quick reference card.  A
reference manual, 106 pages long, provides most of the information about how
the program interface works, and a guide to what functions are available,
enhancements and upgrades to ships, weaponry, and miscellaneous devices.

        A 40-page "Gazetteer" contains descriptions of several dozen star
systems.  It also contains clues about the game.

        "Stories of life on the Frontier" is 82 pages long.  It contains
several chapters of short stories about various characters in the game.  I
haven't read this manual much, but what I have read indicates that it
contains clues about possible game strategies and locations of interest.

        The quick reference card indicates how to start the game, what the
various icons indicate, and situations in which the icons do become
available.  The game controls are minimally explained.

        There is no further documentation on the two disks.

        I found the documentation to be of adequate quality.  There are a
number of glaring typographical errors and incorrect pieces of information.
Most of the information you need to play the game is buried in the game
manual, which lacks an index (but does have a table of contents).

        I would say that the documentation is aimed at people who have
played this sort of game before.  I didn't have any specific problem other
than the lack of an index.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

        LIKES:

                I really liked the processor support for 68040's.  The
        program is smooth and responsive on my computer, and works without
        having to disable caches, play with memory settings, or turn off
        the AGA chipset.

                Hard disk installability was a key selling point.  I have
        reached the stage where I refuse to purchase programs that will not
        load onto my hard disk.  This is a problem specific to the Amiga
        computing community.  The PClone users of the world aren't treated
        to idiotic floppy-disk based games and protection schemes, and
        haven't been for years.  I'm pleased that Gametek marketed the game
        in this format.

        DISLIKES

                I dislike the Save Game "requestor," which consists of a
        screen full of drive names and directories.  AmigaDOS "Assigns" are
        invisible.  Finding saved-game files is a matter of knowing which
        drive to look at, and finding the directory.  I resorted to saving
        games into a recoverable RAM drive and then copying the saved games
        back to disk when I finished playing the game.

                David Braben originally programmed the game so that it was
        "system clean", and would exit back to the AmigaDOS operating system
        when you quit the game.  For some inane reason, the game was
        distributed with this feature disabled, so the only way to exit the
        game is to reboot your computer.  Very unfriendly.  The program
        doesn't multitask, since it takes over the display, but neither does
        it clobber what is already running on your system.  A patch exists
        (by Teemu Suikki, tsuikki@cc.lut.fi) which enables you to modify the
        Frontier executable, and quit back to the operating system.  I
        highly recommend this patch.

                I am constantly disappointed with the number of program bugs
        that my version (1.00) has. Apparently later releases (up to 1.05 at
        the time of this review) have fixed some bugs, but other bugs
        remain.  Most can be circumvented, but some of them require you to
        go back to a saved game, or have the ability to ruin the gameplay,
        by giving you unlimited sums of money if you do certain bug-affected
        sequences.  A word of warning:  money is a signed value, and
        anything over 214,000,000.00 Cr will "roll over" to negative values.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        Frontier is a logical extension to David Braben's Elite; and as
such, the game most resembles Elite.  It could also be compared to Warhead,
StarFlight 2, Universe 2, or any of the other "pilot a space ship and trade,
whilst killing anything that moves" sort of games.


BUGS

        There are many bugs:  far too many to enumerate.  One Usenet poster
was disappointed that any attempt to hyperspace into to Beta Lyrae causes
the program to crash (replicated on the IBM version of the program).

        There is an annoying bug with the Bulletin Board showing items from
the Stockmarket.  This can be circumvented by accelerating time until the
next day, when the Bulletin Board will be reset.

        Many people report not being able to "take off" from planetary
surfaces, even though they have refueled their internal engines.
Apparently maximum time acceleration will get you going, but your ship may
suffer considerable damage as it crashes through various obstacles (walls,
buildings, mountains, etc.)

        There are a number of bugs involving money.  One planet "sells"
usually expensive items for negative amounts of money!  Take one tonne of
material, and they GIVE you 3,000 credits.  Very silly.  Another bug lets
you sell your ship for the going rate, but not complete the transfer -- you
get to keep the money but not change the ship.  Do this a few hundred times,
and you can make a hundred million credits in a few minutes of furious
mouse-clicking.  Surely ruins the game though.

        One ship has an unfortunate knack of being able to aim its turret
laser at itself.  Excellent way to commit suicide.

        There are many more.  Most of them can be avoided, and the general
advice given in comp.sys.amiga.games is to SAVE THE GAME a lot, unless you
want undue heartache.


VENDOR SUPPORT

        I haven't contacted the company, and doubt the efficacy of a support
request directed at a British company, coming from Australia.


WARRANTY

        There is a registration card that does not mention any kind of
warranty.


CONCLUSIONS

        I like the game a lot.  It recaptures the feel of Elite, with some
upgraded graphics and a much larger galaxy to explore.  I hope that David
Braben comes out with the (rumoured) add-ons to this program, since most of
the galaxy is unexplored and lifeless.

        The 3D graphics engine used in the game is very smooth.  Certainly
this is what I expected of something like Wing Commander (which was a great
disappointment on the Amiga).  The introduction sequence (available as a
"Frontier Demo") is quite neat, and I'm sure it sold more than a few copies
of this game.

        I'd have preferred to have had a properly tested game, with the
major bugs removed, but I still recommend that people go out and buy the
game.  It's a whole lot of fun.

/// Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users
    --------------------------------------



                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 · Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

 · The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software, online.

 · Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command.

   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES.

 · 35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

 · No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

 · Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

 · Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

 · Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

 · FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
 · Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  

 · Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

 · The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
 · Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,

 · And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

Aaargh!

It's getting difficult to keep up with all of the CSAE conversation
these days.  In a nutshell:  nobody seems to know exactly what patents
Readysoft may or may not have been or are infringing upon, lots of
people are mad at Jim Drew for either no discernable reason or because
he believes in putting patents on software, and I STILL don't know what
happened to  A-Max III.

So I'll move on to other things...

You may have read about the Quadra 610 DOS-Compatible rumor two weeks
ago in CPU Status Report.  Maybe you read the full-feature article
confirming it last week.  In case you didn't, Apple has announced a
Quadra with a full 486/VGA board installed.  It allegedly has a shared
clipboard (we'll see just how practical that is) and both sides are
accessable with a dual keypress (Left Amiga-M?).  Ever since I read the
first file two weeks ago, it set me to thinking.  Now, with the
confirmation, I'm thinking even more.  Why would Apple do something like
this? Why would they release a dual-platform machine after all that
work on PowerPC?  PowerPC, the chip that was supposed to do all of this
wonderful cross-platforming, right?  In my estimation, Apple Computer is
doing one of two things:  1. It is either  trying to soak its customer
base for every penny it can get, selling a cross-platforming computer
now so they can turn around and sell a PowerPC cross-platformer in a
year, claim it's something that everyone needs, and take more thousands
from people who just bought the Quadra 610.  Nasty and un-Commodorelike
though it be, it's good business sense for Apple, and a distinct
possibility. The other possibility is that PowerPC simply isn't
everything that it's been hyped up to be, and Apple knows it, and has
released a 486/VGA board as a sort of apology.  After all, we've been
hearing about PowerPC for a year, but the first word about this computer
came to me two weeks ago. (Oh, just as a note: the 486/VGA board is
said to be "under $500", meaning $499.99, no doubt.  I have to admit:
that's less than the current Amiga solution.)

Like I've said, this is the time for Amiga cross-platforming to take
center stage...it's obviously something the computer community wants to
hear about.  We've been doing it since the first XT bridgeboard came
out. Let's remind them.

A quick benchmark for ya:

Yep, we lose.  Actually, some of the other benchmarks aren't as bad...
Centris 040/20                                Amiga 3000 (030/25)
   SoftPC                                            PC-Task
 SI: 16.1                                          SI: 1.6

Yep, we lose this one.  Not all of the benchmarks turned out with this
much difference, which I attribute to the difference in speed as well as
SoftPC's 286 emulation.  It IS faster.

/// Zen and the Art of Desk Top Publishing
    --------------------------------------
    By Brian Gawor



Disclaimer:  This article contains little on zen philosophy, except
that which is applied through common sense reasoning (zen philosohy).

How can the average person reach thousands of people effectively with a
few hours of work and some good text?  What concept has changed the
entire publishing business in the past few years?  What would spur a
high school student to read an entire manual dedicated to "dumb" people
by David Pogue in a week?  Desktop Publishing, both a scourge and a
savior to thousands of people.  In fact, the author of this column
predicts that every person in the United States that has enough gumption
to sit in front of a computer will do some form of desktop publishing
before they die.  There were 14,588 postings on the America Online
Desktop Publishing message board last time I checked, and more converts
are entering the field every day.

Since everyone will do it anyway, I'm going to share some of my
mistakes. I am the editor of a news publication which I produce entirely
on a few Macintosh computers.  Before anyone decides that this column
is worthless because it was written by a user-friendly-computer-using
person with little experience, let me make a confession.  This
user-friendliness is the worst curse I have.  It allows me to embellish
my work with complex images and layouts that do nothing but confuse my
readers.  This is the biggest mistake any beginning desktop publisher
can make.  The fact that I am not a professional means nothing -- I have
hundreds of dollars of shareware software written by 12-year-olds.  I
am constantly criticized because I am still learning.  This may be the
biggest asset any one can have in this field.

The term 'layout' comes from the process that used to be needed to
create a publication; actually physically manipulating bodies of text,
etc.  Keyline, paste-up, typesetting, and other terms used a few years
ago are fading away. This is due to the advent of easy to use,
easy-to-purchase, and easy-to-learn computer systems that take entire
job markets and throw them out the window in  a few years.  Progress has
allowed an underexperienced punk like myself to make brochures,
pamphlets, ads, business cards, etc. after just a few months (weeks) of
learning.  The only problem is that very few of us have any idea what
we're doing, outside of what we learn through application.

A layout has two major purposes.  To inform the reader, and to catch
their attention.  These two goals must always be kept in mind when
laying-out a publication.  They bear an inverse relation to each other. 
When a publication gets too informative, the reader puts it down. 
Sorry to break it to everyone, but America could never pride itself on
attention span.  In fact, every newspaper story in the country is
written so that all the really important information is in the first
paragraph, or the first sentence if the writer is any good.  Then, facts
are listed in descending order of importance, because the author by no
means expects the reader to finish the story.

If a layout gets too eye-catching and creative, too disarming, often
ease of information is lost.  If a publication becomes too gray (filled
with text, devoid of graphics and pictures), no one will pick it up.  So
an intricate balance must be set.  This is the hardest job a desktop
publisher has:  How to use all this intricate, creative technology to
display, and possibly enhance the meaning of an authors words.

This can be accomplished with well-placed pictures or graphics; things
not too completely overbearing to detract attention from the story (no
cover shots,  etc.).  The best graphics to use in desktop publishing are
original (nix on clip-art) works with good contrast.  Editorial
cartoons and such should fit these criteria.  Everyone looks at the
cartoon first, and if it is interesting enough, they may continue on to
read the story that accompanies it.  Pictures should take up full column
lengths of horizontal space.  Any text rap on a news article is bad
text wrap.  Many a lay-out competition I have bombed by forgetting this.

Keep the words straight if they are meant to be taken straight.  Go
ahead and embellish on a spread, or other less structured environment. 
Hand the rough lay-out to a friend.  If they struggle even a bit to read
where a story move along, there is something wrong.

Where do you learn layout?  From readomg existing, successful
publications.  They are read for a reason -- they're easy to read!  This
is the invisible  hand of DTP.  Search for the personality of your
publication.  This will be  apparent in the words, in the themes, and
sometimes in the magazines lying on  the tables of the writers who
contribute.  A layout can do amazing things for  the mood of a piece. 
Don't tell me everyone buys Spin and Wired, and Ray Gun just for the
words.

These magazines are part of the Deconstructionist movement, which I
would like to say I follow in my work.  Beautiful is not always
beautiful. Sometimes ugly is beautiful in the 90's.  The editors of some
of theses magazines do very enterprising things to get the effect these
"on the edge of sanity" effects.  I have been told that sans seriff
fonts (Helvetica, anything Roman) can be greatly accentuated by printing
them out on a bad printer and tracing around them  rough up the edges
of you work.  But remember the golden rule:  Keep it readable, keep it
clear.

These are just a few of the questions all DTP's are faced with:  "What
am I  going to do with this text", and "how do I get people to read
this?"  Take a look at what you read, keep the work simple but
eye-catching, and don't make it to the printer at 11:45 when the job
needs to be done at noon.  It makes them really nervous.

/// Internet Mail to Commercial Systems
    -----------------------------------
    by Robert Niles
    (rniles@imtired.itm.com)


Whether you are part of one of the major commercial systems, like
Compuserve, Delphi, Portal, America Online, etc., it helps to know 
that you can communicate with friends, relatives, and associates no 
matter what online service they are on ...or you are on.


If you have access to Internet email, whether you are on a commercial
system, or not. Then you can send email to most anyone on one of the
larger systems.

Here's information on how to send mail to the commercial services:


 - America Online (AOL)

Users on AOL, PC-Link, or Promenade can be accessed using their
screen name as the username and adding @aol.com as the domain.
For example: User "Robin F" would recieve mail addressed to
robinf@aol.com


 - AppleLink

AppleLink users can be addressed via internet email as:

username@applelink.apple.com


 - AT&TMail

Send to:

accountname@attmail.com


 - BIX (Byte Information Exchange)

Simply send email to username@bix.com


 - Compuserve

The most commen way to send mail to a user on Compuserve is to
simply change their account number containing a comma to the same
number but containing a period (Compuserve users have a "user ID"
usually in the format of something like xxxxx,yyy, such as
78422,482) and add @compuserve.com

ie: 78422.482@compuserve.com


 - Delphi

Sending mail to a user on Delphi is quite simple. Simply add
@delphi.com to their username, ie: rob_g@delphi.com


 - GEnie

Simply append @genie.gies.com to the username, ie:
d.duck@genie.gies.com

 - MCIMail

MCI has three addressing structures. Knowing the format of
the receipient's online name helps

accountname@mcimail.com
mci_id@mcimail.com
full_user_name@mcimail.com


 - Portal Communications

For the most part you can easily send mail to a user at Portal
by using the following convention:

username@cup.portal.com  (ie: rniles@cup.portal.com)

At times a user does not frequent the "Online" system, but instead
uses the Portal Shell. To send mail to a user on the shell send to:

username@shell.portal.com  (ie: rniles@shell.portal.com)


 - SprintMail

SprintMail was supposedly going through some changes. So the format
to them is not certain. I called SprintMail and talked with
one of their representatives. He didn't know, and told me I might
want to talk to someone who manages the Internet. I talked to someone
there and they weren't sure. I'll do some more fishing around and see
what I can come up with.



For information on how to send email from a commercial system to
another, or any other site on the internet, contact the customer
representatives on your system.

/// BIX - Byte Information Exchange             Lots of information!
    -------------------------------



BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and enthusiasts.
While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is the place for 
knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  You're likely 
to find many others in similar situations who can offer advice, give 
technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.

BIX is divided into areas called conferences, each devoted to a 
particular area of interest.  They range from algorithms to windows,
from writers to amiga.  Conferences are categorized into groups,
usually referred to as exchanges, so that you can browse through
whatever groups interest you and see a list of the conferences it 
contains.


                  These are some of the exchanges on BIX:

amiga.exchange - the place for Amiga developers and enthusiasts
byte - the full text of each issue of BYTE magazine; source code too 
e.and.l - Entertainment and Leisure; music, pets, games, more
ibm.exchange - everything from OS/2 to PC clones
mac.exchange -  Mac news, support, software, advice
professionals - consultants, engineers, financiers gather here
programmers - some of the best brains in the business!
wix - the Information Exchange for Windows; Windows Magazine online
writers.ex - the professional and amateur writer's exchange


                       *** FULL INTERNET ACCESS! ***

BIX also features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription.

/// Usenet Review:  RCS 35 MHz 68040 accelerator for Amiga 2000
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    By Adisak Pochanayon
    (pochanay@cae.wisc.edu)


Well,

        It finally happened.  After being on a waiting list for four months,
I finally got my long awaited and much anticipated 35 MHz 68040 Fusion Forty
accelerator from RCS Management of Quebec, Canada.  It was beginning to take
so long to get my board that at first I was worried that RCS had gone out of
business and stole my money.

        Well, I was mistaken and I owe RCS a large apology.  I was the happy
owner of a 28 MHz Fusion Forty 68040 board for several years and I am now
the extremely happy owner of the 35 MHz beast.

        This is a screaming board.  Using AIBB 6.1 for speed tests and my old
28 Mhz 68040 Fusion Forty as a comparison base I get the following results.

TEST           28 MHz FF      35 MHz FF      A 4000

FTrace         1.00           1.26  *        0.90  -
CplxTest       1.00           1.26  *        0.89  -


* = winner of category for speed.
- = loser  of category for speed.

        As you can see, in a comparison of the three 68040 contenders, the
35 Mhz 68040 Fusion Forty from RCS did not lose in a single category.  As a
matter of fact, the only categories where it didn't win were graphics
categories where the A4000's 32-bit path to CHIP memory and 3.0 ROM calls
(graphics library is rewritten for 3.0) aided it.  However, in general, the
A4000 lost out most of the time to both RCS accelerators.

        Notice that the Fusion Forty 35 is in general twice as fast as an
Amiga 4000.  This is mostly due to its special 64-bit memory subsystem.
This is a very fast interleaved memory system which allows high speed burst
access to memory.  From what I understand in speaking to the people at RCS,
it lets the 70 ns SIMMs I have in my board work as fast as 40 ns SIMMs in
other boards (like GVP's).  The memory performance of the the Fusion Forty
35 is almost five times faster than the A4000 and twice as fast as the
older Fusion Forty.

        However, RCS is coming out with a memory accelerator for the Amiga
4000 that will be using this same memory subsystem.  It is supposed to
double the performance of the 4000 and from what I have seen on this
machine, I don't doubt that claim one bit.

        What do I think of my new board?  I'm in heaven!!!  I waited four
months but this baby was definitely worth the wait!  I have 16-megs of
killer fast speed memory on a screaming 35-MHz accelerator.  After several
months of waiting and $100 of phone calls, I am sitting pretty.  RCS was a
little slow in getting the board out, but they had some design problems early
on that they have overcome.  When I did call them, they explained the
problems they were having.  Also a recent move slowed them down in getting
some equipment out.  However, they are now getting ready to go full speed
ahead with their 68040's at 35 MHz and the Amiga 4000 memory accelerator
(code named Excaliber or something like that).

        RCS *IS* finally shipping this long awaited product.  They are
currently backordered and only shipping to those who prepay but if you are
waiting for a board, your wait is almost over.  Mine is!!!

        But do I have any gripes about the board?  Well, the manual is a
little skimpy... actually, it's on disk except for the installation
instructions.  However, installation couldn't be simpler.  You just plug in
the board, run a simple program and add a single line to your
startup-sequence.  My board contains the plug & go ROM's, so weird rebooting
is necessary like with the older 28 MHz boards (if you didn't upgrade the
ROMs that is).  I guess a manual is almost redundant.  When I first booted up
though, only 8 megs of my 16 appeared.  A simple call to RCS cleared things
up and now all 16 megs appear on boot-up.  RCS does have great support for
their products!

        This appears to be a very fast and solid product.  I would recommend
it heartily as the fastest accelerator for the Amiga I have ever used!

        RCS has a new address and phone number:

                RCS Management
                6755 Taschereau Blvd.
                Suite 211
                Brossard, Quebec
                J4Z 1A7
                Canada

                (514) 926-3755

I am in no way affiliated with RCS other than being a satisfied customer.
E-mail me if you have questions.

CC:     
Subj:   AMIGA VS IBM


I work with IBM's all day.  I use an IBM PS/2 Model 77 66mhz 486
with XGA/2.  At home I also have an IBM Reply 55sx-486SLC 50 mhz.
For those of you who are thinking of switching.  There is no comparison
between IBM and Amiga.  I have 12 megs on my work machine and it works
fine but it is definitely slow despite it's "fast" chip and SCSI-2 and
XGA-2.  Its an architecture comparison.  What is local bus but just
a modification so that they can run their bus at the speed of the chip
, this however after 3 or more devices brings your machine to a crawl.
Why switch?  Software maybe.  I personally wish for Excel for Amiga but
I seriously doubt it will happen.  The architecture of the Amiga with
its coprocessors etc make the machine of choice Amiga.  The operating
system is much better than Windows.  Windows stinks.  I had 4 programs
running and I could barely switch between them without major hard disk
thrashing.  Very slow switching.  Slow program execution. (many would
argue however, "compared to what." their aren't many Windows programs
that have matches in the Amiga world.)  DOS is at least 20% slower 
running under Windows.  OS/2 is ok but it still is slow swapping and
you have to have 18 meg to do anything then have 30 or so disk space
for storage to run.  Think about these things Amiga 500 multitasks
with floppies and 512k better than my IBM 486-66mhz in Windows or OS/2
with 12-megs and 300meg hd with XGA-2.  It comes to peer pressure I
guess, but remember Windows is new to the average user many using
Windows still exit programs before running another because it slows
the system down.  IBMers are new to GUI's and Multitasking they think
Windows is great.  Show them your machine and tell them the specs.
a 68000 machine that came out a little after the AT still works as
great in the OS as Windows or OS/2 (Forget NT they're pushing it as a
client server not an OS.  Disk I/O great everything else rates like OS/2)

  Supra Corp. announced that they have no plans on marketing a voicemail
  product for the Amiga, however, a Mac version is currently shipping, and
  a PC version is under development.  "We would certainly be open to 
  discussion with third party vendors about developing voice products for 
  the Amiga," a Supra Corp. representative said.

  Supra also plans to release a V.FC, 28.8Kpbs modem in the near future.
  A tentative release date for this product is January, 1994.  No price
  has been announced.

Every now and then a good one comes along....

From the Macintosh Roundtable on GEnie - Cat. 40, Topic 5, msgs 239-240

From M.STEFANI [MCH]

   Before I make any purchase, I generally like to make a list of 'pros'
and 'cons' to aid me in the final decision.  Some of my thoughts:

       == TOP TEN REASONS TO STILL CHOOSE AN ATARI OVER A MAC ==

   10) Just one model in production (Falcon) makes selection a 'no-
       brainer.'
   9) Tramiel's multimedia computer development in a 'class by itself.'
   8) Still sports the largest collection of 'masochistic' programmers.
   7) Less time wasted reading thick, glossy monthly periodicals.
   6) No portability 'problems' due to no portable notebooks or laptops.
   5) Extensive collection of 'two' games available for the amazing
      Falcon.
   4) Limit of one dealer per metropolitan area promotes close friend-
      ships.
   3) One-piece design featuring 'mushy' keyboard way ahead of it's
      time.
   2) Ergonomically-placed joystick ports good practice for fumbling &
      cursing.
   1) Who really needs all those CD-ROMs anyway?
