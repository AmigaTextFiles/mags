Another couple of weeks, and...

Hey, stuff's starting to happen!

True more or less to what we heard in Amiga Technologies' last burst of
information promising lots of European conferences and press releases,
we're seeing distribution channels established worldwide.  While we lack
press releases, deals in the US and Australia are being completed, and a
Spanish distributor is announced in this issue.  When harassed for press
releases, Gilles Bourdin has been pleading his workload to explain their
lack of existance.  In the same vein, we have been unable to schedule an
IRC conference with him.

But, to make up for it somewhat, AmiTech will be showing itself at the
Video Toaster Expo in November.  Not bad.

We've also got a Web page-although it's in German.  http://www.amiga.de.
Actually, a couple of enterprising (and bored) Amiga users discovered that
much of the English translation is available at
http://www.amiga.de/uk/infos, but there are no links that would lead the
casual reader there just yet.  While nothing the reasonably experienced
Amiga user doesn't know, having the resource is always reassuring.

What do we have lined up as entertainment in the coming weeks?  Well,
reviews are always key, and the pressure is on Amiga Technologies to
provide us with a shot at their new-old Amiga models-which, incidentally,
are already being sold (1200s, anyway) in stores in the UK and Germany.

An IRC conference with Nova Design, the team behind ImageFX, should be
coming in November, and of course there is always the prospect of an Amiga
Technologies conference.  (As an aside to Amiga developers, AR is always
interested in the idea of organizing a conference to spread knowledge and
interaction with users of your products.  Drop us a line if you'd like to
set something up.)

We'd also like to entertain applications for a Games Editor, since Sean
Caszatt has lost interest in keeping up with that position.

Watch this space, we're watching out for you.

Jason

Subject: Letter Dr. Kittel

To:peterk@combo.adsp.sub.org
Subject:BeBox !!!!

Dr. Kittel,

In 1981, I walked into the Computer Store in Santa Monica.  Seated therein
was this pimpley faced kid just banging away at the keyboard of an Apple][
to his hearts content.  I knew little about small computers but did use
6502s in the lab @ jpl, so I bought one.  Loved it.  Then came the MAC. 
Hated it.  Too much money ($2500) for what was in it!  Then
Atari...bleeekkk!!!

Then, in mid 1985, Byte Mag reviewed the A1000.  Unbelievable!  I bought
three; two as gifts Oct '85.  Then an A2000.  Used it to develope my EEG
NeuroFeedBack system that uses the A1200 w/ harddrive, extra memory and
FPU.  I will continue to use the A1200.  I will get them USED.  Do you
think I would pay $949 for one????

Along comes the BeBox!  Wow, I can get three of these for about the same
price that I paid for the A1000s; plus or minus a few bucks.  An AT
A4000T/60 is obsolete, reduntant and headed for oblivion by comparison.  In
my humble opinion, knocking $1000 would just about make it.  And with AT's
attitude about the USA market, BeBox's future sparkles here in the USA.

  Sorry,

  Chuck Davis....

Hi Jason,

This is a response to Robert Marier's letter in AR317.  After reading
Roberts letter about his display-problems, I immediately recognized the
symptoms.  I have a GVP A1230 '030 50Mhz accelerator and had the same
problems initialy.  However, before I bought the thing, I asked around on
IRC and some guy said he also had that accelerator.  He told me it worked
okay, but in order to keep it working, he had to keep a big fan pointed at
it all the time...  :)

In other words: the flickery lines problem is caused by the 68030 CPU
getting too hot.  To solve this you can put a mini-fan inside the A1200.

I bought a small (approx.  3.5 x 3.5 cm) 12V fan and a mini-jack contraplug
(a plug where you can put a walkman earphone in).  The fan was placed (with
tape) under the ventilationshafts, in front of the '030 cpu.  A hole was
drilled in the back of the Amiga for the contra-plug and the fan was wired
to it.   This way you can simply power the fan with a standard AC/DC
adapter.  It might of course also be possible to draw the power from the
PSU, but my technical knowledge doesn't go that far.  :-)

To get the air flowing inside my Amiga, I also drilled some holes in the
right side of her <g>, right next to the diskdrive.

That's it! Hope this will help Robert and other "overheated" Amiga owners out
there..

---------------------------------------------

Resurrecting an annual tradition, the World of Amiga show will be held
again in 1995 at the Toronto International Centre on December 8, 9, and
10th.

The official show hours are:

   Friday     6:00pm - 10:00pm
   Saturday  10:00am -  6:00pm
   Sunday    10:00am -  6:00pm

Wonder Computers, Inc., organizers of the 1995 WOA in Toronto, are
currently soliciting distributors, retailers, and user groups to exhibit at
the show.

There will be two active seminar rooms for the duration of the show, and
they are booking steadily - most notable seminar topics include the
Internet and multiplatform emulation.

So, clear those dates on your calendar!  The biggest Amiga show in North
America since 1993 is about to happen, and you can be a part of it.  See
the new Amigas from Amiga Technologies (Escom), and new software and

                               ANNOUNCEMENT

           We're a group of Amiga owners engaged in building the

                     INTERNATIONAL AMIGA SOCIETY (IAS)

   a world-wide association of Amiga practitioners, owners, developers,
 dealers and believers in the ideals and future of the Amiga platform.  In
view of past experiences and present-day circumstances we feel it necessary
 to explore all possible ways of protecting our investment in money, time,
 skills and dedication and furthermore use available technologies to forge
  an intelligent and effective form of association between all interested
parties.  Our first aim is to create a world-wide database of all existing
   user groups so we can communicate among ourselves with e-mail and/or
                     mailing-lists and other devices.

 We are herewith inviting everyone reading this to communicate our request
        to their user group and to send the following information:

                           1.SnailMail address

TITLE

  Arctangent's Graphics Pack, Volume 14 (ArcsPack #14)

VERSION

  1.0

AUTHOR

  Bowie J. Poag

  EMail: bjp@interaccess.com
  IRC: Arc

DESCRIPTION

The 14th volume of an already gigantic array of absolutely BEAUTIFUL
hand-painted backdrop patterns intended for use with NickPrefs' WBPicture
(Workbench 2.x), WBPattern (Workbench 3.x) and MUI.

Unlike my competitors, my work doesn't SUCK.  Furthermore, the patterns
don't have an annoying red slash through them, nor do I ask any pointless
Shareware fee from users who simply want to make their Workbenches and MUI
programs look professional, highly polished and respectable.  ArcsPack is a
quick and seamless way to drastically improve the look of virtually
everything about your system--from Startup-Pix to show during reboots, to
Workbench/MUI patterns and backdrop imagery.

Tired of sifting through endless heaps of crappy graphics, looking for the
perfect backdrop for your Workbench, or the perfect texture for your MUI
applications?  Wish you had a beautiful show-off screen to smoothly fade in
while your machine reboots, instead of staring like a brain-dead PC user at
a blank screen?  For those of you who want to give your Amiga a dramatic
top-to-bottom facelift, ArcsPack is the perfect solution.  This archive
represents but one volume in a library of such imagery I've been creating
for the past year.  Regardless of your tastes, from sleek and corporate to
gaudy and tacky, there's something in every volume of ArcsPack for
EVERYONE!  Plus a few little hidden bonuses on occasion.  :)

A wide variety of additional colour palletes are included for you to apply
to the patterns of your choice, as well..On a similar note, each pattern
has one or two variations on the original theme, so you can pick the
-exact- pattern of your liking, instead of being stuck with just one type
to choose from.  Take any of the dozens of patterns, make it BoO-BeRRy BlUe
or 10,000 Watt PumPKiN OrANGE!  Its up to you!

And to top it all off, its FREE.  I've turned down several offers from PD
and Shareware companies to publish and sell my work commercially simply
because I believe strongly in giving something *back* to the Amiga
community.  ArcsPack is MY way of saying thanks, and encouraging others to
get off their duff and make a difference, for all of us.

                            ------------------------

 o All ArcsPacks are fully compatible with Workbench 2.x, and 3.x, and
   look absolutely groovy if used in cooperation with Magic Workbench and
   NewIcons.

 o 100% Compatible with ALL Amigas, from bottom-of-the-barrel 7 Mhz A1000's
   all the way up to 66 Mhz A4000T/060 powerhouses.

 o It's 100% Fat-Free, and only 10 Calories per serving!

 o Its * F R E E * !

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

None, but AmigaDOS 3.1 and a machine with at least 1MB Chip Ram is strongly
reccomended.

AVAILABILITY

All volumes of Arctangent's Graphics Pack (ArcsPack) are available from any
Aminet mirror worldwide, i.e.  ftp.wustl.edu, and are located in either
pix/wb or pix/icon, depending on the intelligence of the Aminet admin of
the site where you're at.  ArcsPacks are usually found in pix/icon, despite
having absolutely nothing to do with icons.  Go figure.

PRICE

  Absofrigginlutely FREE! A gift from me to the Amiga community! Enjoy!

@node NEWS8 "Ami-FileSafe (AFS)"
@toc NEWS

Upgrade your Amiga's performance and reliability with new system software
-- replace FFS with a faster, high data-integrity filesystem.  With
Ami-FileSafe (AFS), your directory listings will be smoothly displayed, and
software accessing the disk will run faster.  More importantly, AFS ensures
your data is safe from invalidation caused by machine crashes and
accidental reboots.  AFS is always validated -- you will never have to put
up with invalid disks again.  The consumer version is limited to one 650mb
(or smaller) HD.  The professional version, perfect for video and audio and
other intensive use, includes support for HDs to 9gigs and multi-user
security.

Independent tests reported by CU/Amiga magazine show AFS using 7-11% less
disk space, with write times up to six times faster, and read times up to
twice as fast as the best previous file systems.  CU/Amiga tested AFS
reliability by resetting, powering down and removing SCSI cables while
writing to the drives.  "Not once through all these heinous eye watering
tests could we corrupt the AFS partitions!"

US list prices are: Consumer $40, Professional $99.95.

AFS FAQ, 03-OCT-95

Ami-FileSafe (AFS) has generated enormous interest.  The purpose of this
FAQ is to answer the questions we've heard many times, and to provide you
with more information about AFS.  This FAQ was prepared by Dale L.  Larson,
el Presidente of Intangible Assets Manufacturing (http://www.iam.com).  It
is accurate to the best of his knowledge at this time, but AFS is a new
product to IAM, and it is a sophisticated piece of software.  This is the
first preliminary edition of the FAQ, so it is subject to change, we
disclaim responsibility for any errors and lies, etc.

Q: When/Where can I get AFS?

A: AFS is published and supported by Fourth Level Development.  Intangible
Assets Manufacturing (IAM) is the exclusive distributor for North America
(While FLD is the exclusive distributor for IAM products in Europe).  IAM
makes AFS available through Amiga dis tributors and dealers (both local and
mail-order), as well as direct (i.e., mail order).  IAM received its first
major shipment of product earlier this week, and shipments were sent to
many dealers immediately.  So if your dealer doesn't stock it, ask her to!

Q: What is the current version of AFS?

A: 2.2.

Q: How much is AFS?

A: There are two versions.  AFS Consumer (also called AFS User) is US$40,
AFS Pro is US$99.95.

Q: What are the limitations of the Consumer version?

A: The Consumer version can only be installed to a single partition, and
that partition must be on a drive which is less than 650mb capacity (not a
partition of 650mb, a drive size of 650mb).  You cannot install Consumer
onto a 10mb partition of a 700mb disk .  You may have other drives and
other partitions in your system.  The Consumer version also contains no
multi-user support.

Q: Why are those limitations in Consumer?

A: This is basically a marketing decision, but one which is forced on us. 
AFS is a highly technical product which requires a great deal of
development resources.  We cannot support those resources with sales of
User alone.  So we selected limitations on User that would allow those who
truly cannot afford Pro (and who do not need multi-user support, which was
also expensive to develop) to get use of AFS User, but require those with
more sophisticated systems to buy Pro, paying a fair price for the
software.  Note that the benefits of AFS go up with the size of your
harddrive -- a 1gig drive takes much longer to validate than a 200meg
drive!

Q: What is the policy to upgrade from the User/Consumer version to the Pro
version?

A: In the US, the cost of the upgrade is the cost of the difference in
price plus $10 ($70).  You must send in your original disk with payment,
then you will be mailed a new Pro disk.  This process should take about
7-10 days, but is unavoidable due to serial numbers, etc.

Q: Where can I read an independent review of AFS?

A: Dave and Dale both say AFS is cool, so what more do you want to know? 
For you doubters, the September 1995 CU/Amiga did a two-page review, Amiga
Computing has a review in their October 1995 issue, and other reviews are
being written.  Since AFS is evolving fast and magazine reviewers often
look at a product more than four months before an issue gets to
subscribers, most of the limitations found by reviewers have already been
addressed.

Q: When will DiskSalv3 understand AFS?

A: Dave is working hard on this support, and has been doing so throughout
the summer.  We expect to be shipping something by January of 1996.
(Please note that earlier dates which have been publicly announced did not
come from Dave or IAM -- this is IAM's first public statement on the
subject.)

Q: What is the policy to upgrade DiskSalv3 to AFS-supporting?

A: IAM's commitment to the Amiga is clear -- DiskSalv3 has been upgraded
through four freely redistributable patches during the last year (the
current version being 12.19).  The upgrade to support AFS will probably not
be a freely redistributable patch.  However, it is our intent to ensure
that loyal customers of DS3 are well-treated, and that you will get a
better a deal if you buy DS3 now and upgrade later than if you put off your
DS3 purchase.

Q: What about ReOrg?

A: Yeah, we will take care of that one specifically, and a few other tools,
too.  We aren't ready to announce the details yet, so please don't ask, but
we plan to make an announcement in the next month or two.

Q: What's this about AFS Floppy?

A: There is a floppy-only version of AFS.  It is unlikely to be released as
a stand-alone commercial product, but you may get it bundled with other
products.  For those of you with floppy-only systems, or those who want to
try AFS on floppies, this is an excel lent bargain.  MegaBall4, the new
game from IAM, will include AFS Floppy as a free bonus disk!

Q: Is there a demo?

A: Yes, there is a demo version of AFS which can be installed to a very
small partition to give you a sense for whether you want to buy the
commercial product.  The demo isn't always available in the same revision
as the currently shipping AFS (right now it's demo 2.1, production 2.2),
since obvious ly it is the lowest priority of the four versions.  An older
version demo was on a recent cover disk.  IAM has no more information on
where to get a demo at this time, but we'll put one on our FTP server when
we get one.

Q: Will AFS work with removable media like Zip and SyQuest drives?

A: Yes.  The Consumer version will work, too, as long as those drives are
the only one AFS is on and the drives have less than 650mb capacity (which
is the case for all current models).  Fourth Level Development has special
removable media support tools which they bundle with drives.  These
packages are not yet available in the States, but we are aware of the
demand.  Without that software, you have to do the same thing you would
with FFS on removable media -- HDToolbox, etc.

Q: How reliable is AFS?

A: It's pretty darn reliable.  Read the magazine reviews.  September's
CU/Amiga said "AFS doesn't invalidate disks.  During the course of our
tests we reset whilst writing files, powered down when the buffers were
being flushed and pulled the SCSI cable out of the drives.  This is just
asking for trouble, but not once through all these heinous eye watering
test could we corrupt the AFS partitions!"

That should be good enough for most people, but here is a little more
detailed and technical information...

FLD says "AFS has been written to take advantage of the atomic theory
of filsystem construction.  This means that no data pointers are changed
unless the validity of the data at which it is to be pointed has been
checked as far as is practically possible.  AFS has been written to take
advantage of the basic physical features of all hard drives.  In
particular, the amount of time which is taken for capacitance levels to
drop in the event of a power outage to the extent that data can be
corrupted.

Both the MaxTransfer and the DMA mask need to be properly set to ensure
that the maximum integrety is obtained from the system.  The AFS
documentation includes detailed information on how to set them. For
systems that follow these guides, FLD is aware of no instances of data
loss with AFS since pre-release version 14.7.  The system has been
exhaustively tested by independent evaluators, none of whom have
experienced data loss. Any bug reports made to FLD are carefully tracked
and treated.

In the event of memory corruption, the only known result has been the
loss of data within individual files or directories which have been
caused in consequence of programs corrupting memory.

In the event of an attempt to corrupt the filesystem cache, AFS converts
the filesystem to read-only, protecting your precious data.

With pre-release/beta version 14.3, there existed known and documented
limitations with the use of some software. Those limitations were fixed
before the release of AFS, but unfortunately, someone who had been sent
the beta version used some of the software on the list not to use, ran
into problems, and posted that they had caused corruption on an AFS drive."

As someone who gets a lot of calls from OFS/FFS users desperate for
DiskSalv3, I KNOW what kind of data loss you can get from the standard OS
filesystems. And how crippling invalidation can be.

I can also say that nothing is completely safe, which is why everyone
should make regular backups, regardless of the filesystem that they use.

TITLE
         ShadowStart

VERSION
         1.3

         Shadowfox@IRC

DESCRIPTION
         ShadowStart is a small utility that should be called from 
         the startup-sequence.
         If the activation-key is pressed down a requester pops up,
         asking you if you want the WBStartup-drawer, the 
         User-Startup script or both to be disabled.
         This means, you can bootup a "clean" Workbench, 
         without any programs in WBStartup or User-Startup executed!
         And also a new shell-window can be opened for changing 
         things befor executing the startup-sequence.
         (Sourcecode is included.)

NEW FEATURES
         Before any key checks are performed ShadowStart checks if the
         SYS: partition is currently being validated.
         If yes, Shadowstart waits 3 seconds and checks the disk
         state again.
         When the validation is finished, ShadowStart automatically
         continues with its normal execution.
         The main effect of this feature is that startup execution will
         be delayed until the SYS: partition is validated
         (no more disk-trashing on startup).
         The validation check is always performed, if the activation-key
         is pressed or not.

FUTURE
         Ideas and suggestions are always welcome!

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
         Two version of ShadowStart are included,
         one for Kick/WB 3.1 and one for Kick/WB 2.0+.

         ENGLAND

DESCRIPTION
    ImageStudio is an image processor written for the casual
    graphics user who wishes to convert or manipulate various
    graphics formats on a modest Amiga system. The program
    tries to cover the most commonly performed operations
    like colour reduction, scaling and dithering in an easy
    to use Workbench2 style interface. Most of the commonly
    used file formats can be loaded or saved.

    Image processing, by its very nature, requires large amounts
    of RAM - ImageStudio includes its own virtual memory manager
    which works on any Amiga to reduce the amount of RAM required.
    A powerful ARexx interface is also included which has been
    made easy to use by allowing the user to develop new scripts
    entirely within ImageStudio.

    * Virtual memory
    * Fully featured, easy to use, ARexx interface.
    * Upto 100 levels of undo / redo
    * Loads / saves IFF-ILBM (palette based upto 256 colours,
    HAM6, HAM8, extra halfbright), IFF-DEEP, GIF, BMP, PCX, JPEG,
    TIFF, Targa, SGI, PNM (PBM, PGM, PPM), QRT, EPS, datatypes.
    * Adjust colour balance (brightness, contrast and gamma).
    * Online AmigaGuide help.
    * Includes 68020+ optimised version.
    * Requires no third party libraries or utilities.

NEW FEATURES
    o Added support for TIFF, IFF-DEEP, SGI, PNM (PBM, PGM, PPM),
      QRT and datatypes.
    o Colour preview.
    o Added `UnCrash' utility for recovering virtual memory
      swap files after a system crash.
    o A printed and illustrated manual is now available separately.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
    ImageStudio requires:

    * Workbench 2.04 or above.
    * Around 1MB of free memory.
    * Several MB of free hard disk space (for virtual memory).

    First public release.

AUTHOR

    Ola Lundkvist
    Email: d1wizo@dtek.chalmers.se
    URL:   http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/~d1wizo

DESCRIPTION

    This is a compilation of three little simple nice games I've
    written in the last few years. Major general features:

    * One or more players, playing againts each other
    * Playability
    * Fun
    * Addictive
    * 100% Systemfriendly and multitasking
    * Simple but funtional graphics
    * No sound (so you can listen to your favourite music or whatever)
    * AmigaGuide documentation
    * Starts from WB or CLI
    * Written in C (using Lattice/SAS C 5.10)

    The games included are: BlackBox, FourInaRow & Tangle.

    BlackBox
    This is an improved computer version of the boardgame with the
    same name. For 1-6 players. BlackBox is fun and uses almost no
    CPU time. Runs on any Amiga.

    Tangle
    This is a Tron like game for 0-4 players (yes you can watch the
    computer play against itself). Great fun. Very configurable
    (configurations can be saved in tooltypes, at present uses 53
    tooltypes). Needs 2.04 or later, but an old version that runs on
    1.x is also included (though it is not at all as good).

    FourInaRow
    This is the result of me studying algorithms. A very nice version
    of Four in a row, or Four wins. 0-2 players. Plays fairly good
    and fast, I would say. (That is - beats the crap out of all other
    four in a row games I have seen.)  Included a version that uses
    2.04, a less featured version for 1.x and a windows (yuk) version
    (which you may use or delete, whatever pleases you most).

REQUIREMENTS

    Should work on any Amiga. 2.0 or better recommended
    (versions for 1.x with less features included).

AVAILABILITY

    WizoGames is available on Aminet as the archive "WizoGames.lha"
    in the game/2play directory:

    ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/game/2play/WizoGames.lha  (167265)

PRICE

    WizoGames are shareware. I give you WizoGames and you give me your
    own software. People who don't write own software may donate $5 -
    $10 to get registered. Students or people without an income are
    allowed to use WizoGames for free. More information is available
    in the archive.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

    WizoGames are ShareWare and is Copyright 1992-95 Wizo. These are
    basically freely distributable as long as no profit is made.
    Detailed information on distribution is available in the archive.

               NR3 4BJ
               ENGLAND

DESCRIPTION

    An editor for use with the Formula One Grand Prix or World Circuit
    game (published by MicroProse Software).  It is very easy to use,
    with a standard 2.0 look graphical user interface (even on KS 1.x!)
    and on-line help should you need it.

    Allows you to alter most of the in-game setup, including computer
    car performance, car/helmet/pitcrew colours, car fragility and many
    other things (and I MEAN many!).  Sound samples can also be replaced,
    cockpit graphics changed, and lap records and setups printed.

    Changes can be saved directly to a copy of the game which is running
    in memory, or to main file used by the game for a more permanent
    change.

    F1GP-Ed breathes new life into an ageing, but excellent game.  1994
    and 1995 example datafiles supplied for those who don't want to
    mess about.

    The program itself is auto-enhancing, which means that it will run
    on a basic A500 with KS 1.2, but will make use of KS 2.x or KS 3.x
    specific routines on suitable machines to make itself even better.

NEW FEATURES

    This version is a big improvement on the previous shareware release,
    (2.04) with an improved modular user interface, several bug fixes
    and lots of new features (too many to list here).

    Grant Reeve's PatchF1GP V1.8 and Toni Wilen's GPPatch V2.20 are now
    incorporated in the F1GP-Ed executable.

    One notable addition is the ability to increase the smoothness of the
    game from 8 to, a lifelike, 25 frames per second (requires fast Amiga).
    Other update speeds also available for less capable Amigas.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Formula One Grand Prix or World Circuit commercial game published
     by MicroProse Software.

@toc NEWS

For immediate release 

Amiga Technologies GmbH makes its first formal U.S.
appearance at the Video Toaster User Expo '95 

October 3, 1995, Sunnyvale, CA 

Video Toaster User is pleased to announce that Amiga Technologies GmbH, the
ESCOM subsidiary currently developing and manufacturing the Amiga computer,
will make its first appearance in the U.S.  as an exhibitor at the Video
Toaster User Expo '95. 

Earlier this year, Amiga Technologies bought the assets of Commodore
including the technology to develop and manufacture Amiga computers.  Now
they are coming to the video industry's only show dedicated to the Video
Toaster, LightWave 3D and the Flyer to unveil their plans for
manufacturing, third-party product development and distribution in the U.S.

"During a recent visit to Germany the principles of Escom and Amiga
Technologies shared with us the plans they have established for the Amiga
in the U.S.," said Dwight Parscale, NewTek CEO.  "We are very enthusiastic
about the future for the Amiga and believe their participation in the Video
Toaster User Expo is a strong sign of their commitment to this market.  We
are excited about the potential to make these creative tools available
again."

"We anticipate an even greater turn-out for the second annual Video Toaster
User Expo due to this recent addition of Amiga Technologies as an
exhibitor.  This is what our readers have been waiting for," said Video
Toaster User's Events Manager, Ann Pulley. 

This year's Expo will bring thousands of video enthusiasts from around the
world to the Universal City Hilton & Towers November 1-4, 1995.  Four days
of training seminars (Nov.  1-4) concentrating on the Video Toaster,
LightWave 3D and the Flyer will be presented in conjunction with three days
of exhibits (Nov.  2-4) by the industry's leading manufacturers and
developers of third-party products for the Video Toaster and LightWave 3D
market. 

Avid Media Group is the leading authority of information for professionals
in the personal video production and 3D animation markets, with a focus on
the Video Toaster and LightWave 3D.  Avid Media Group's expansive product
line includes magazines, newsletters, custom publishing, trade shows, and
seminars.

@toc NEWS

NSDi and AmiTCP/IP statement

There has been numerous rumours about the status of the Network Solutions
Deveopments Inc.  (NSDi) operations and developments of AmiTCP/IP.  This
message is aimed to end all such rumours and provide the Amiga networking
community with up-to-date information about the matter.

The rumours are caused because of our invisibility on the Amiga news
groups.  There has been a simple reason for this, we just have had no time
to follow the news.  We hope to change this now.

AmiTCP/IP Distribution, dealership, etc.

NSDi was formed little over a year ago to make AmiTCP/IP available on
commercial Amiga market.  Up to now the commercial AmiTCP/IP has been only
available through direct orders from NSDi.  Now we are happy to announce a
distribution deal with Village Tronic Marketing GmbH, the makers of such
products as Ariadne ethernet boards and Picasso II graphics cards.  Based
on the contract between NSDi and Village Tronic (VT), VT will manufacture,
market and sell AmiTCP/IP all around the world using same Channels as they
are using for their other products.  In addition to that, all new dealers
are welcome to take their part of the AmiTCP/IP market.  However, we
require that the dealer will provide techical support for their customers.

Our WWW site contains the Village Tronic contact information.

We still continue to sell AmiTCP/IP directly, too.  Email to <info@nsdi.fi>
for latest ordering information and an order form.  Currently we do the
shipments once a week, so please allow about 10 days for delivery.

Technical Support

Technical sopport for the customers is available through email to
AmiTCP-Support@nsdi.fi.  We have also provided support for the AmiTCP/IP
4.0 Demo users, but the paying customers are first on priority.

We have had some more or less severe problems with our email because of our
IP service provider.  From 12.9.  to 19.9.1995 they managed to lose every
single email message destined to nsdi.fi because of a configuration error
in the mail server software.

If you have sent in email during that period, and have not received an
answer, please resend your message.

Our response times during the summer have been too long, partly because of
the mentioned problems, and partly because of summer vacations etc.  Now
the response time should be few days, maximum.

NSDi WWW site

Our Web pages are now available on URL http://www.nsdi.fi and they now
contain the latest information.  If you have any links to our old URL
(http://www.xgw.fi/biz/NSDI), please change them to point to the new place.

Our Web pages are "under construction", so no flames, please :-)

NSDi FTP service

We used to have our "home" ftp site at kampi.hut.fi.  This service is being
shut down by the university.  By now Aminet should contain all the
interesting files that were on kampi.hut.fi.  Anyway, there is a need for
an AmiTCP/IP specific ftp site for distributing fast patches and other
inforation not intended, or meaningful, to the general public.

Currently this service exists on www.nsdi.fi:/pub/amitcp.  We hope to have
a proper alias (ftp.nsdi.fi) soon.  By now there are not too many files,
but our intention is not to collect a "library" there.  Aminet serves
better for that.

Next release (4.3)

Next release is 4.3, and it will be available within few weeks.  It will
include bug fixes and some new features, like a cool dialer capable of
handling any possible dialing needs you might have.  Also included are
faster ftp transfer routines.

The new release will be available as a free patch to all existing
customers.  The availablility will be announced to all registered customers
via email (which we failed to do when 4.2 was released) and through these
newsgroups.

That's about all this time,

[No, it's not directly relevant to the usual sort of thing that goes on in
Amiga Report.  But I think that it's interesting to keep abreast of these
sorts of developments in the sister market to the Amiga.  That, and CMD,
publishers of Commodore World, are considering doing an Amiga magazine, and
a show of support and interest in such a publication from the Amiga
community can't hurt. -Jason]

CMD is pleased to announce that we are developing a new line of
accelerators for the Commodore 64 and 128 computers.  The Super64CPU series
design is based on the Western Design Center W65C816S microprocessor which
was used in the Apple IIGS and is currently employed in the SNES (Super
Nintendo Entertainment System).  The new series is scheduled to debut in
February 1996 with two models: the Super64/10 (10 MHz) and Super64/20 (20
MHz).

Both accelerators will operate on Commodore 64 and 64c computers, as well
as in 64 mode on Commodore 128 and 128D models.  Acceleration will be
switch-selectable as well as software-selectable.  An additional switch
will allow you to completely disable the accelerator or select between
Standard and JiffyDOS operating modes.  Other announced features include
64K of fast static RAM, 64K ROM, and a built-in pass-through port for
connecting compatible cartridges and RAM devices.

Devices that will be compatible with the Super64CPU's include:

     * Commodore 17xx series REU's
     * CMD RAMLink
     * Berkeley Softworks' GEORAM
     * Commodore 15xx series drives
     * CMD HD & FD series drives
     * CMD SwiftLink

Super64CPU accelerators will provide high-speed with many software
applications including GEOS, telecommunications & BBS programs,
productivity and utility software, as well as most BASIC programs.  Retail
prices are estimated to be $149.95 for the Super64/10, and $199.95 for the
Super64/20.

ESCOM Company Profile

 _________________________________________________________________

ESCOM AG - Half-yearly report  30. June 1995

  RWE MOBILFUNK GMBH ACQUIRES 12.5% OF ESCOM

  NEW MULTIMEDIA-COOPERATION WITH RWE TELLIANCE

  ESCOM GROSS TURN-OVERS UP 32 % IN FIRST HALF-YEAR '95

ESCOM WILL TAKE POVER THE RWE-Concern's country-wide TELLIANCE
telecommunication chain with 50 outlets so strengthening its presence in
this field important to multimedia etc.,

Mobilfunk GmbH wil get 12,5 % of ESCOM AG zu beteiligen.  The shares will
come from the private shares of ESCOM founder Manfred Schmitt...

   MARKET-POSITION

ESCOM has fully reached its turnover goals in the first half of '95
increasing its gross compared to last year by 32% to 1,2 Bil Marks.  During
te remaining of this year new growth indications are coming from the UK
where in May 95 ESCOM acquired 170 ex-Thorn-EMI stores with 30 more coming
before year's end.  With these ESCOM will own a very tight distribution
setup in Europe's 2nd biggest market.  This new direction toward the
multimedia market was stenghened by the acquisition in April of the
Commdore and Amiga technology.  The first products were showcased at the
Berlin IF show and received a great deal of interest, so much so that the
1995 production is already sold out.

   TURNOVER

The retail computer sales underwent in the first six months of 95, a
noticeable slow-down, particularly in Germany.  A relevant reason for his
was next to the weak consumer economy the annnouncement of the release by
September of WINDOWS 95 which led to market insecurity.  Despite this ESCOM
succeeded at increasing its consolidated gross from 879 Mil marks for the
same period last year to 1,157 Bil Marks an increase of 77%, etc.  etc.

INVESTMENTS

Investments in the first half of 95 totalled 14 Mil marks, 5 up on previous
year mostly in the expansion of our distribution network, and a further 17
mil marks in the acquisition of Commmodore and Amiga.

EMPLOYEES

The number of employees grew from 1,138 to 2,891 mainly due to the
expansion of our distribution facilities particularly in the UK.  In
Germany as of June 30 1,394 people were employed.

PROFITS

At the end of the first half of 95 ESCOM had pre-tax losses of 4 mil Marks
as opposed to a profit of 6 mil last year.  his was due to falling margins
in the computer market and the cost of increasing our distribution setup,
particularly in the UK, as well as the startup costs for the new production
of machines and their development.

OUTLOOK

The investment in the broadening of the distribution, the entering into the
new multimedia market have priority during this current year.  Particular
attention being given to the UK market and the revival of Commodore/AMiga
production.

A noticeable uplift in he market (Windows 95) and he development of our
retail facilities as well as our preparedness for the Xmas season as well
as the introduction of new multimedia products points to an increased
confidence that our aim to increase our total turnover for the year 95 by
40% to 3,1 bil Marks (as opposed to 2,1 bil last year) will be within
reach.  Furthermore the increased capitalization agreed by the board in
July has been duly registered with the Commerce Dept, the new shares will
be credited in a 5:1 relation to our shareholders by the middle of October
95 and will also be introduced at the Frankfurt and Dusseldorf stock
exchanges.

ESCOM AG - FROM PCS TO MULTIMEDIA

With 2,300 employees.  2 bil Marks turnover and 410,000 PCs sold in
1994, ESCOM is a leading computer seller in Europe.  When in 1986 Manfred
Schmitt started adding computers to his organ and instrument shop he could
not have forseen a how successful the business would turn out to be.  By
1990 there were 1O shops in the Frankfurt area.  As the Berlin wall came
down he looked east and thanks to a joint venture with a Dresden enterprise
he was able to start manufacturing PCs, while in 1992 the administartive
headquarters.  were moved to Heppenheim and a year later the first central
warehouse.

Until 1993 the majority of the businesss was carried out in Germany with
only 20% abroad.  This changed when a Dutch retail chain was acquired at
the end of 1993 and a first step undertaken in the UK.  These two markets
are now, with the German one, the principal places of business for ESCOM. 
By the middle of 95 there were now 167 ESCOM outlets in the UK, 36 in
Holland and 140 in Germany making the turnover abroad about 50%.

PRODUCT RANGE AND DISTRIBUTIUON NETWORK

ESCOM today has 5 manufacturing centers.  Besides Heppenheim and Dresden
PCs are also made in Prestwick, Scotland, in Brno (Czech Republic) and
Amsterdam.  Yearly manufacturing capacity is over 1 million units...

Due to its own well-tuned distribution network and retail-outlets ESCOM can
bring new products to market very quickly and by augmenting its outlets,
get very close to customers.

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES

With the takeover of Hako AG ESCOM gained access to the stock-exchange in
1993.  In the folwing year atrategic alliances were formed with Siemens
Nixdorf Information Systems AG (SNI) who today hold 10% of the share
capital.  The cooperation with SNI means that very fast access to new
technologies, a relevant criteria for reaching a leading position in
multimedia.

Another partner is Quelle Schickedanz AG with 25% participation and the
latter's distribution outlets substantially adds new elements to widen the
distribution capacity both domestically and

GOALS AND MULTIMEDIA

By acquiring Commodore and Amiga ESCOM is positionning itself most
favourably in the new multimedia market.  For the development,
manufacturing and distribution of Commodore and Amiga products ESCOM
founded a subsidiary, Commodore BV in Nieuw-Vennep, Holland, and Amiga
Technologies in Bensheim...

@node FEATURE1 "History of the Amiga"
@toc FEATURE

===========================================================================
                    THE UNOFFICIAL HISTORY OF THE AMIGA
  Konstantiniadis Manos                           konem@prometheus.hol.gr
===========================================================================

1982 ----
     A small development team, named Hi-Toro, chose the codename "Amiga"
for a games console that will beat the Atari.  The team responsible for the
development of the "Amiga" had 4 members: Jay Miner , RJ Mical, Dave Morse
and Carl Sassenrath.

     In the beginning they sold other products to win the repsect of their
customers and to earn them some money while devloping the Amiga.  One of
their first productions was "JoyBoard" a controller that you used by
sitting on it!  There were many games for that, but the best was "Zen
Meditation" in which you have to stay absolutely still.  (Does the word
"Meditation" means something to you?  Guru Meditation?  ...  YES!  They
used to say that if anything goes wrong the only way to relax was by
playing Zen Meditation!)

    The codename "Amiga" was not choosen by luck.  (Jay Miner didnt like
that name at the beginning) A story tells us that the team didnt want to
have a computerized name, such as SCOA16/II, because they didn't want to be
easily identified as a computer development team.

     The codename "Amiga" was the spanish name for girlfriend.  They
continued this tactic and to the custom chips that they made (Agnus,
Portia, and Daphne).  For the main CPU they used a Motorola 68000 (16bit),
the best CPU available in 1982.  Slowly their games machine was getting
shape...

1983 ----
     Rumours about a super-computer, with the codename Lorraine (the first
Amiga, named for the HiToro president's wife) were travelling across the
USA.  1983 was the year that all the custom chips were built.  RJ Mical
(the coder of the intution) wanted a cheap games machine, but the others
wanted the best computer.

     Jay Miner was dreaming about a machine like the Amiga 2000, one with
lot of expansion slots.  Jay Miner cooperated with Ron Nicholson who gave
the idea of the blitter.  HAM was Jay Miner's idea after a visit to some
flight simulators (there was a chance to leave HAM option outside of the
first Amiga).  $7,000,000 had already been spent on the Amiga project.

1984 ----

--- January 1984

     C.E.S.  (Consumer Electronics Show) took place at Chicago, USA.  The
team introduced an Amiga (well...  a huge pile of chips and wires...) with
the hope that they would find someone to invest in their project.  On
January the 4th Dale and RJ Mical made the first Amiga Demo ever, the
famous "Boing" demo, a sphere with red and white rectangles on it, bouncing
on the screen.  The "Amiga" was only shown to selected "customers" and all
the processing was continued secretly.

--- June 1984

     The Amiga Inc.  team was trying to find a company to buy their
technology and to employ them, since they had run out of money.  Many
companies were interested in the custom chips of the Amiga, such as Sony,
Apple, Philips, HP, etc.

     Atari's president, Jack Tramiel, who had just left C=, because he
purchased Atari secretly, was trying to get his revenge by buying Amiga
inc.  He lent Amiga Inc.  $1,000,000, to be payed back one month later. 
When the month was almost up, it became apparent that Amiga Inc.  would not
be able to pay him back, so he offered 98 cents per share for the company.
0Amiga Inc.  thought that this was unacceptable, so they looked for someone
else to buy them.  Just 2 days before the deadline, C= came in and began to
talk to Amiga Inc.

     They managed to get C= to raise its bid to $4.25 a share, and just
before the deadline ended C= gave them $1,000,00 to pay back Atari, on the
condition that they would get to buy Amiga Inc.

1985 ----
    --- July 23

     The year that the "dream machine" came out when Amiga 1000 introduced
in Lincoln Center at New York.  Many people say that this was the date that
changed the future of computers.  (Multimedia ...  back in 1985!)

    --- September

     The Amiga 1000 shipped to its first customers.

                            -===- Amiga 1000 -===-

                       Processor : Motorola 68000
                                   7.14mhz (less than 1 mips)
                    Custom Chips : (3): Portia, Agnus, Daphne
                             RAM : 256k Ram(*) / 512k Maximum (*2)
                              HD : Optional ($1000 = 20mb (!))
                              FD : 1  3'1/2" - 880kb

                 [(*): The Very First Amiga used 128k ram!]
                 [(*): Later expandable to 8.5mb !        ]

     It was the FIRST computer to use more than 16 color output as a
standard feature (4096 colors / HAM6 [Hold And Modify]).  It was also the
first computer with preemptive multitasking OS.  It already had 4 channel
digital stereo sound and the first computer to ship with a mouse as a
standard.

     The kickstart was loaded from floppy.  The price was about $2000 in
the days where singletasking PC's (286) cost about $4000.

     It only had one external expansion slot because Commodore wanted to
keep costs down.

     At the same year the first issue of "Amiga World" made its debut. It
was the first Amiga magazine...

1986 ----
     The Amiga 1000 was finally launched in the UK.

     The team beginned working on a new amiga model.  They wanted it to be
more expandable, with a lot of slots and they wanted the slots to be
AutoConfig.  They had to argue with C= once again, because the autoconfig
slots cost 50c more.

     Two prototypes of the new model were developed.  One in the Los Gatos
(USA) and one in Braunschweig (Germany).  C= also wanted IBM compatibility,
so both teams tried to do the best to emulate an IBM 8088.   Jay Miner
didn't like the idea.

     Finally, the emulator came out from Germany.  The "SideCar" was a
$1000 product, basically an IBM XT without a keyboard that was plugged into
the side of an Amiga 1000.  The product that Los Gatos was producing it was
a $200 accelerator, for an IBM PC software emulator.

     Los Gatos helped the German team a lot with the emulator's software.

     The Los Gatos began working on a new "dream machine", no one knew
exactly what at that point.

     The very same year, Mehdi Ali, was employed at Commodore as a
consultant for Dillon Reed by Irving Gould.

1987 ----
     Finally the new amiga model was on production The name was just the
simple as A2000.  The Amiga 2000 was bigger than the A1000 and extremely
expandable, with 5 Zorro II slots [5] (Zorro II) plus a video slot.


                            -===- Amiga 2000 -===-

                       Processor : Motorola 68000
                                   7.14mhz
                    Custom Chips : (4): Agnus, Denise, Paula, Gary
                             RAM : 1mb Ram / expandable to 9mb
                              FD : 1  3'1/2" - 880kb

It has been launched in the UK for 32000 (later 31500).
     The kickstart was finally in ROM.  A2000 was a base for other Amigas,
being released on various world markets, as the A1500 [A2000 with two 3
1/2" drives], A2000HD, A2500/20, A2500/30, A2000HDA/100, A1500 plus and
A2000Plus.

     Later the same year, the Amiga 500 was launched (3599 in the UK). 
It was the same as the Amiga 2000, with a compact design (keyboard and cpu
in the same box) and no internal slots.  Both the machines had a new
graphics mode, the EHB (Extra Half Bright), that gives 64 colors on
screen.

     The operating system was 1.2.  The Amiga 500 was the first really
affordable machine.

     Scala founded in Norway.

1988 ----
   Jack Tramiel, returns, as Atari takes Commodore to court, by claiming
that it had given money to research the Amiga.  The judge supported
Commodore, however.

1988-1989 ---------

     Minor changes, to the chipsets.  Agnus became Fat Agnus, and later,
Fatter Agnus, which can control 1mb chip Ram.

1990 ----

     The first fully 32bit system, with a 68030 and the ECS chipset (fatter
agnus), named the A3000, was launched in the UK for 33000 (later 32000)..

                           -===- Amiga 3000 -===-

           Processor : Motorola 68030 / 68881FPU (later 68882)
                       16mhz (later 25mhz)
        Custom Chips : (4): Fatter Agnus, Denise, Paula, Gary
                 RAM : 2mb Ram / expandable to 18mb [2mb chip - 16mb fast]

     The Kickstart was 2.0.  It had an onboard SCSI controller and Zorro
III slots.  It was also available on a tower model, the A3000T, and a UNIX
model, the A3000UX.  A flicker fixer was also included so that the A3000
could easily be plugged in a VGA monitor.

     A few months later, the A500+ was released.  It was a European model,
with ECS (Enchanced Chip Set), 1 Ram (expandable to 10mb), and Workbench
2.0.  The price was about 3399.

     Both the systems had graphics mode of up to 1470x580 (4colors). 
Kickstart 2.0, was a step forward.  It occupied 512kb ROM (1.3 was just
256kb), but there was not very much backwards compatibility with 1.3.  The
compatibility problem was not Commodore fault, however, but the fault of
bad programming by coders.

1991 ----
     The first multimedia CDRom system, CDTV, was launced in the UK for
3599.  The CDTV was an A500 and kickstart 1.3 with a CD-Rom drive.  CDTV
wass the shortened version of Commodore Dynamic Total Vision (codename:
"babe" as they were designing it for 9 months :)).  Commodore hoped to
sneak it into the homes of computerphobes.  Commodore also didn't put the
Amiga logo, anywhere on the CDTV.  As a result, CDTV failed to catch the
public's imagination, partly because it was 3200 more expensive than an
A500, and partly because the software was disappointing.  This year no more
than 50 CD disks went on sale, but the games was no better than the floppy
disk versions.  The CDTV was operated by a user-friendly infra-red remote
control.  Later the same year the option of turning the CDTV on a full A500
computer was available.  Maybe the market was not ready yet for that
multimedia revolution.

[A570, a CDROM drive for A500 released, before the end of the year.  The
[major [problem was that all this years Commodore had a stable system.
[They had to do a major system upgrade

*1992* ------

    --- March

     A600 launched in the UK for 3399.  The CPU was still the Motorola
68000.  So whats the difference between A600 and A500?  First of all it had
a surface-mount technology (lower cost for Commodore).  RF and Composite
output were also added.  It was also the first Amiga with an IDE controller
(2 1/2") and a PCMCIA slot.  The major disadvantage was that it did not
have a numeric keypad.  An A600HD was launched later that year.

     Rumours about a new Amiga, with an advanced chipset, able to support
up to 16.7 million colors, were true!  Commodore announced the release of
the new AGA chipset (Advanced Graphics Architecture).

    --- September

     At the world of Commodore Show (Pasadena California) in September 11,
1992, Commodore introduced the first machine with the AGA chipset.  As
Commodore announced it was "the company's most significant new technology
advancement in its Amiga line since the product's introduction in 1985."

     At the W.O.C.  they also announced AmigaDOS TM Release 3 Operating
System and "AmigaVision TM" Professional Authoring System.

    --- December

     The first machine with the new AGA technology was the A4000/040
launched in the UK for 32100.  (USA $3699).

                           -===- Amiga 4000/040 -===-

    Processor : Motorola 68040 / 25Mhz
 Custom Chips : (6): Super Gary, Super Ramsey, Super Amber, Lisa, Alice,
                     Paula.
          RAM : 6mb Ram [2mb Chip/ 4mb Fast]

     They replaced the SCSI controller with an IDE one (they included a
SeaGate ST3144A 3.5" 120mb HD - The HD was preformatted, with an 8meg
Workbench partition and a 116 Meg Work partition).  The floppy drive was a
dual speed high density one.  They also used the SIMM technology for the
memory upgrades, but all fast ram simms must be on the same type.
(Commodore used a 4mb SIMM for the internal 4mb)

     At the Christmas of 1992, the low-end AMIGA 1200, an A500 like Amiga
with the AGA chipset, was released as a low-cost machine, with full 32 bit
technology and 2mb Chip RAM.  The machine nearly missed the vital Christmas
season, and although it did just make it, not enough parts had been ordered
to build an adequate number.  Christmas 1992 is a disaster.  No one wants
an ECS machine and few can get one of the new "AA" systems.  (now called
"AGA")".  David Haynie, an ex-engineer at the Pensylvania production plant,
states at his movie, named "The Deathbed Vigil".

     The AMIGA 1200, was one of the most successful AMIGA computers.  It
launched in the UK for 3399 (USA: $599).  It also had the IDE controller
and the PCMCIA slot of the A600, plus a 32-bit trapdoor expansion.  It
included Amiga Dos v3.0.

          RAM : 2mb Chip Ram , expandable to 10mb total Ram. [8mb Fast]

     Both Amiga 4000 and Amiga 1200 used the AGA chipset, able to display
256 colors on hi-res displays, from a palette of 16,7 million colors.
There is also a HAM-8 mode able to display 256.000+ colors (very close to
24bit display!).  Compared to the old ECS chips the new AGA chips are very
fast, even on 256 colors!

     Both Amiga 4000 and Amiga 1200, make use of AmigaDos v3.0!  AmigaDos
3.0 adds CrossDos as standard (a useful commodity that helps you read and
write on PC disks).  It supports all the new AGA graphic modes.  WB 3.0
also supports "datatypes," a new facility that allows programs to access
data in an unlimited number of formats, as long as you install a datatype
that understands the format.  Another useful adition is the Localization,
so WB3.0 and programs using it can easily be on multiple languages.  A lot
of usefull programms such as Multiview (a viewer for every datatype) and
Installer (a easy to use install utility), are also supplied.  A new
filesystem is also included, the DCFS.  (Directory Caching File System).
You could also now use what every picture you like for a window or
workbench background.

     A4000 with the Motorola 68040 wasn't so cheap that everyone could
afford it.  So a little bit later, Commodore launched the cheap-version of
the A4000/040, the A4000/030, with a Motorola 68EC030.

    Commodore was a very profitable company, especially in Europe and it
had a major power in computing, especially in Germany.  But what happened
these years on the story background?  Commodore wasn't producing any
hardware (except the basics) and they also cut the production of the A500
plus and later the A600.  Why?  Well, no one really knows...

*1993* ------
     --- March

Well... First issue of Amiga Report, online magazine ! :)

     --- September

     The very last machine of Commodore, the CD32, a games machine,
launched in the UK for 3299.  It was the worlds first 32bit console.  It
had a double speed CDRom Drive, 2mb Chip memory, AGA chipset and the option
of a FMV (Full Motion Video) module.  But once again the machine didnt make
it.  It had many sales but not as many as they were needed to save the
financial problems of Commodore.  Most of the games released were just CD
conversions of the original A1200/4000 ones, with no extra CD music, or
FMV.  The Commodore situation was awful...

     CD32 was the first (and the last?) machine using as standard,
Kickstart3.1.

(Released later as an upgrade for all Amiga machines.)

*1994* ------

     Commodore had a financial damage of $107 million dollars by the end of
1993.  But the Amiga was still a very popular machine.  In 1992, Commodore
sold about 800.000 Amigas (17% more than 1991) and in 1993, it sold 20%
less.

     Big problems made Commodore lose all that money : Fall of Amiga
periherals sales (Monitors,Printers etc.), the US $ and its price fall on
the major economic markets) and ...  Me*di A*i (president of the
Commodore).

    --- March

     Commodore, has announced that they were having financial difficulties
which might result in bankrupty or liquidation.  Commodore had lost $8.2
million.  The stock fell to 0.75 per share.  The New York stock exchange
halted trading of Commodore stock!

    --- April

     Until the middle of April, Commodore was still producing A4000s,
A1200s, and CD32s, and the engineers continued development of the new AAA
chipset.  AAA was meant to be a big improvement over AGA.  24bit Graphics
[resolutions up to 1280x1024], 16bit CD quality audio and other interesting
things.  AAA was never truly finished.

     During the second half of April the production of Amigas stopped.  The
Philippines factory closed, but left behind a big stock of Amigas.  The
Scotland factory also stopped the production.  Many employees were told by
the management to hunt for new jobs...

*April,22 1994* ---------------
   15 people were dismissed from West Chester (PA), and the Commodore
Semiconductor Group was closed.  15 people were also dismissed from the
Norristown factory.

*April,26 1994* ---------------
    Engineering closed.  The site in West Chester, once supported by 1000
employees, now had only 22 people left on it.

*April,29 1994* (Friday) ------------------------
     Commadore International filed for liquidation in order to be proteced
from its creditors Friday April 29, 1994, at 4:10 P.M.

Commadore's official statement follows:

   "Commodore International Limited announded today that its Board of
Directors has authorized the transfer of assets to trustees for the benefit
of its creditor and has placed its major subsidiary, Commodore Electronics
Limited, into voluntary liquidation.  This is the intial phase of an
orderly liquidation of bothe companies, which are incorporated in the
Bahamas, by the Bahamas Supreme Court."

     "This action does not affect the wholly-owned subsidiaries which
include Commodore Business Machines (USA), Commodore Buisiness machines LTD
(Canada), Commodore/Amiga (UK), Commodore Germany, etc.  Operations will
continue normally."

     But how can the branches work without the head, of engineering that
designs and builds the new hardware and software ?

    Few of the stuff knew about the bankrupty, till the next day when they
arrived at W.C.

*April,30 1994* ---------------
   CEI announced that they would still supply and distribute Amigas and
should be able to meet demand, something that today seems wrong, as there
wasn't any stock available during the next months.

*May 1994* ----------

     Rumors, rumors and rumors.  Samsung was interested in buying Amiga,
but they dropped when they found out that other companies interested
offered less money than they did.

*June 1994* -----------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|     Jay Miner, passed away June 20, 1994 at the El Camino Hospital In   |
|  Mountain View. The actual cause of death was heart failure, but it was |
|                the result of kidney complications.                      |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Many ex-Commodore employees moved to work for other companies such as
Scala (for example Dave Haynie that will oversee all computer related
hardware research and development activities in Scalla offices).

     CEI placed its bid for Commodore.

*July 1994* -----------

     Amiga Convention 94, took place in Quebec, Canada.

     The liquidators had finally received four proposals to buy Commodore,
Those being Amstrad, Philips, Samsung and Commodore UK.  But the Bahamian
court rejected the proposals to move the proceedings to New York City, that
was closer for any company interested for Commodore.

*August 1994* -------------

     Commodore set 2 phone numbers for getting informations about the
current proceedings of the liquidation.

*September 1994-October 1994-November 1994*
-------------------------------------------
     Rumours about, Nestle, Atari, Sony and other companies willing to buy
Commodore.

     More rumours for the day that the liquidation will commence.

     This day is continously jumped from month to month.

     CEI seemed to be more interested than any others and that is
represented by the online conferences held by Amiga Report, on Portal, BIX,
and Delphi.

     CEI finally offers a big amount of money as long as the liquidators
give Commodore to them right away.

*December 1994* ---------------
     World Of Amiga Show held in the Webley stadium in UK.  C=UK claimed
that they are prohibited to talk about the buyout publicly.  David
Pleasance informed everyone that CEI had lost their financial baking-up
status.  CEI never confirmed that.

*January 1995* --------------
     Rumors on UK magazines that C=UK got the highest bid.  CEI again
gives a new bid to the liquidators.

*February 1995* ---------------
     CEI announced that they were signed an agreement with IBM to have them
manufacture Commodore products, for them if they win Commodore.

     Escom seems to be interested in Commodore.

*March 1995* ------------
     Techmedia Publishing, stopped the publishing of Amiga World, the
world's first Amiga Magazine.  The primary reason was the 11 months
Commodore liquidation and the magazine's low circulation.  The last issue
of Amiga World was April 1995.  The cancelation came after the issue was
completed so you will not find any goodbyes and things like that on April's
issue.

     On the date that Amiga World's death is announced, the first issue of
Amiga Link online magazine is released.

     Escom (a German based PC-clone maker) and the liquidator had reached
an agreement to make their bid the contract bid.  The contract bid was for
$6 million, not counting the $1.4 million they have paid for getting the
Commodore's Logo from Commodore Germany.  Other offers were made for other
parts of Commodore.

At last the judgement day of Amiga (or the auction date), was set.  It was
April, 20th 1995.  The companies that made it till that day were Commodore
UK, CEI and Escom.

*April 1995* ------------ 1 year after the liquidation...  Geez!  Time is
short.  ;)

Escom finally made it!

----------> Cut from Amiga Link - Buyout <---[Thanks Zool!]----------------

     In the auction on April 20, only two companies had bid, Escom and Dell
.
Escom was the German computer retailer, and Dell is a big American computer
company.  CEI, long thought to be a bidder, had thrown in their hat with
Dell, so that Dell would work with CEI on the Amiga, although CEI would be
the ones running the show in respects to the Amiga.  Escom's bid was the
starting bid of approximately 5 million dollars, as well as the money they
spent on the C= trademark, approximately 1.3 million dollars.  Dell made a
bid at 2 PM of an undiclosed amount.  However, that bid was rejected for
Escom's bid, because it had conditions attached to it, whereas Escom's bid
was unconditional.

     After the auction ended, and Escom's bid was accepted, Dell continued
to work on, trying to make a more suitable bid.  Their second bid was a $15
million bid, with the condition that they be allowed a 30 day waiting
period to look at the Amiga and decide if they wanted to keep it.  If they
decided not to keep it, they would forfeit their $1 million deposit, and
the whole process of getting another bidder would have to go on again.

     In the hearing on Friday, April 21, the Creditor's Commitee wanted to
accept Dell/CEI's bid.  However, Escom felt that was unfair, because Dell's
bid was placed after Escom's bid was accepted.  There was much legal
wrangling, but finally, the judge asked that during the recess the parties
try to work out an agreement.  After 3 hours, the court re-adjurned, and
Escom said that they would agree to raise their bid by $6.5 million, to 12
million dollars.  Although that was less than Dell/CEI's bid of $15 million
dollars, the Creditor's agreed to drop the objection to stop Escom winning
the Amiga, because Dell could back out of the deal and then they'd have to
go through the process again.

[...]

     Escom has sales of approximately 2 billion dollars last year.

[...]

     Commodore UK did not place a bid at the auction, apparently because
their backer dropped out.  However, Colin Proudfoot of C= UK and Escom have
both stated that in 2 weeks they will be holding talks as to Escom either
liscencing Amiga technology to C= UK, or, more likely, buying C= UK.

     Escom has said that they will work with Amiga developers, user groups,
and the Internet to support the Amiga.

     The Phillipine plant and stock in it wasn't included in the auction,
but it will most likely be sold to Escom for $1 million soon, because it
may actually be illegal to sell it to anyone other than Escom.

*May 1995* ----------

     Escom held a conference in May 30th.

     Escom announced the beginning of a new era for Amiga machines.  First
of all Escom created a new division, called Amiga Technologies.  Their
first priority is to resume the production of the machines.  They are
expecting the new Amigas to be out on September 1995.

     They announced the production of an Amiga 4000/060 in a brand new
Tower case and the A4000/040 in tower also.  In October they will produce
Amiga 1200s.  They have also signed contracts with Scala, so with every
Amiga you can get for free a Scala MM300.  The RISC technology should be
researched in 1996.

     Well...  lets hope to see our Amigas back again on the top.  :) Lets
hope that Escom will make the right movements and correct management and to
not copy the Commodore's mistakes.

LONG LIVE AMIGA! Only Amiga Makes It Possible!

===========================================================================
                             ESCOM UK ATTITUDE
  Andrew George Elia                                   odin@dcs.qmw.ac.uk
===========================================================================

[Originally posted to comp.sys.amiga.misc, and of considerable
interest...Mr. Elia is not a corporate spokesman, but his views as
something of an insider are worth reading.-Jason]

Hi guys!

It`s about time we started to give Escom (not necesarrily AT) a good
kicking.

I have been working in one of the Escom stores for the past four months
with the hope that I would be participating in some way towards the
re-introduction of the Amiga.  If nothing else, I might be able to do
something from the inside or even get a staff discount.  It seems that I
assumed that Escom UK would be just as willing to welcome back the Amiga as
the German parent company.  Big mistake.

When I first applied for the job, I was asked to sit a test which contained
things about memory access times, and IRQ values.  When I got the job I
would have had to go to a training session led by reps from Intel, and IBM.
I didn`t (couldn`t) go.

The bottom line is that I have contacted every single department in our
head office, and they don`t know a thing!  In fact, some of them tried to
tell me that Escom bought the name and ditched the rest.

The reason that I am inflicting this on you all is that Amiga Shopper and
Amiga Format (November issues in each case) state that Amiga Technologies
have told them that Escom stores WILL be selling Amigas.  I contacted a
certain person in AT, and he informed me that this would not be the case
because negotiations with Escom had failed.  You may or may not know that
both Intel and IBM have pumped a hell of a lot of money into the new Escom
stores.  I have a feeling that they have objected to having Amigas in the
stores (primarily because it proves that Intel processors are kludged 70s
crap, and IBM have blatantly tried (and failed) to copy
AmigaDOS/Workbench).

Worringly, AT told Amiga Shopper that the staff in Escom stores know the
Amiga product well and are ideally suited to selling them.  This is
blatantly untrue.  Not only do 70% of Escom staff consist of former
Rumbelows staff (ie.  gormless box shifters), but those that I have spoken
to seem to be quite antagonistic towards Amigas.  As for knowing anything
about them from either a software or hardware point of view, you have to
see their ignorance to believe it.  They REALLY don`t know what they are
selling.  This seems to apply to the 30% of new staff who are wholly PC
nerds.  The branches I have talked to confirm that they get tonnes of Amiga
enquiries.  I have found out from the Amiga Format letters page from
October (I think) that some shops have been denying that they had anything
to do with Amigas all along.  In fact my own collegues drop customers like
hot potatoes the moment they find out they have Amigas.   Fortunately, if a
customer hasn`t already left the shop (some do so without bothering to ask
-unsurprising considering the response they others give) I put the record
straight.

Basically, I think it`s suicide for Escom stores not to deal in Amigas,
their software and hardware.  Although Escom and AT want themselves to be
considered separate entities, the link has already been established.  If
the public can`t SEE Amigas, they will find it more difficult to make a
decision about buying one.  For goodness sake, if you are near an Escom
store, don`t be afraid to go in and ASK about them.  If they give you the
wrong answer, put them straight.  Don`t let them give you any rubbish about
what they think is happening.  They simply don`t know.

I have to confess that I hold a relatively menial position at Escom (higher
only than the window clear and the guy that collects the rubbish bins).  As
such I am trying to get some management staff to back me up.  I`ve already
compilied a survey which I`m planning on faxing over to every store in
London (and elsewhere if necessary) to try an accumulate some evidence of
demand for Amigas in Escom stores.  I just have to wait for managerial
approval.

By the way.  If it is true that AT are ditching the AAA chipset, they
should get their heads examined.  Another thing: AmigaDOS is for the Amiga,
so why the hell do they want to develop it for machines with a more limited
architecture ?  Here`s an idea: why not develop AmigaDOS for the Amiga ?
Smart people.

I challenge anyone from either Escom or Amiga Technologies to prove what
I`ve said is wrong.  I hope I am.  I HAVE sent E-Mail to Gilles Bourdin
twice, and had no reply.

This is my first offering to the general public, as I usually only write
for a small local Amiga newsletter.  If I get the time, and if I get good
response from this, I may make further game reports.  Feel free to email
me!

New games are planned for release soon.  Some of the new titles include
Dungeon Master II and the long awaited Alien Breed 3D.  Due to Escom's
decision-making, AGA is now the way to go.  Expect most games to be
AGA-only from now on.  Plan to upgrade, I'm sure you won't regret it.  I
myself plan to get an Amiga 4000 Tower and an SX-1 expansion module for my
CD32.

By the way, let me know what you think of having reviews written out like
this, rather than in the old compartmentalized format.  If enough people
like this, I will write my column in this format in the future.

SPECIAL REPORT

This month I've decided to make my column a special report, due to the fact
that what I'm reviewing is commercial, shareware, and news, all at the same
time.  What is this amazing thing, you ask?  Well, here is the announcment:

TEXT ADVENTURES ARE NOT DEAD!

Much to the contrary, they are still alive and well, thriving in a growing
shareware market.  There are people who take their time writing such
adventures at home, and upload them to the Internet and BBSs, all around
the world.  I will take a look at how they create such games and how you
can play them, a bit later.

HISTORY OF TEXT GAMING

In the earliest days of computers, even before screens, there were computer
games.  Of necessity, these were text games, because graphics has not been
implemented yet on most terminals.  One of the oldest games in existence is
Advent, or Adventure.  It was written on a mainframe computer in the mid
70s, and is generally attributed as being the first text adventure game. 
It began the Golden Age of text games, lasting from the mid 70s to the late
80s, and is still being played, in various versions, nearly a quarter
century later.  Ruling over this Golden Age was the undisputed King of Text
Games, Infocom.  Their first game, Zork, which was based upon Advent, was
released in 1980.  They released nearly 3 dozen text adventures over their
lifetime, and they were played by millions.  But then technological
breakthroughs in the mid 80's allowed low cost advanced personal computers
to be brought to the public.

Realistic graphics and sound, made their way into many homes in the mid
80's, causing many people to believe that text-only gaming was obsolete.  
The great and mighty maker of text games, Infocom, slowly ground to a halt,
and was bought by Activision in 1986.  They gradually turned from making
text-only games to graphic/text, and by the '90s, all new 'Infocom' games
use graphical interfaces.  The other, smaller companies switched to making
other types of games, or went out of business as well.  Sadly, these new
games, and many others, lack the gripping gameplay of those in the earlier
days of computing, disappointing many players of the old games.

But now there are other programs out there, that allow you to make your own
Infocom-style adventures, and others that give an improved interface to the
old Infocom games, as well as allowing you to play any of these new games
people have created.  These programs exist for all styles of computers,
from Amigas to Macs, PCs, Unix machines, even palmtop computers.  This is
possible, because the Infocom style of creating games was extraordinarily
well thought out and portable to any computer.  Called Z-Code, games can be
created in this style, and be easily played by anyone with a interpreter. 
These games are not playable on their own, but this is a small loss.  The
interpreter programs come with tons of options, and quite a few things to
make issuing commands easier.

WHAT IS Z-CODE?

Z-Code is the special language, designed by Infocom, that all Infocom style
games are written in.  It is quite flexible, powerful, and is able to be
ported to almost any computer in existence with little difficulty.  There
were several different versions of Z-Code, incorporating improvments as the
computers and games grew better.

Version 1: The earliest Zork and a few others around 1980.  Antique.  All
games from Versions 1 and 2 were converted to Version 3.

Version 2: Much the same, with several minor improvements. Also Antique.

Version 3: Standard: Most of the Infocom games were originally released in
this format.  Many games can still be found using it.  Vast improvements
over Version 2.

Version 4: Plus: Minor improvements, doubling the possible size of a game,
and increasing the vocabulary word size. 

Trinity, Bureaucracy, Nord&Bert, and A Mind Forver Voyaging are Version 4
games.

Version 5: Advanced: This is the other commonly used version, with many
improvements some additional commands, and sound and mouse support.  Most
shareware games are created in Version 5 format.

Beyond Zork, Border Zone, and Sherlock are Version 5 games.

Version 6: Graphical: The last official Infocom Z-Code version, it allowed
games with pictures, such as Shogun, Zork Zero, Journey, and Arthur. 
*NOTE: Version 6 games are not supported by many interpreters, if any.*

Versions 7 and 8: Enhanced: These versions were created by shareware
authors, and allow for much larger games.  Some interpreters support these
versions, but as of yet, I have seen no game that uses them.

SO WHAT ARE THESE PROGRAMS ALREADY?

Well, one program I have seen to allow you to write these games is called
Inform, written by Graham Nelson.  It is a mature, efficient program that
more accurately could be called a compiler, because you write the game in a
text format, then run it through Inform to get the playable Z-Code version.
It even comes with several sample games, though you must already have an
interpreter.  Though a bit intimidating to some people, once you explore
Inform, it is an easy program to use, and one I heartily recommend.  Inform
exists for many types of computers, and is available on the Internet for
FTP from

ftp.gmd.de in /if-archive/infocom/compilers/inform

There are other programs out there to create Z-Code games, but I have not
seen any of them yet.

As for interpreters, I know several.  Known as Z-Code interpreter programs,
or ZIPs for short, they are much more flexible than the old Infocom
interpreter.

Infocom, by the InfoTaskForce, is a wonderful interpreter, allowing you to
play almost every official Infocom game, as well as all shareware games. 
It comes for many computers, including Amiga, PC, and Mac.  Better known as
ITF, it is my interpreter of choice.  It is available also for FTP from

ftp.gmd.de in /if-archive/infocom/interpreters/itf

There is also another, called ZIP.  A small file, it handles the newest
versions of Z-Code games, versions 7 and 8.  It is also reputedly more
stable than others.  Get it from

ftp.gmd.de in /if-archive/infocom/interpreters/zip

[ITF also supports V7 and V8. -Jason]

The third interpreter I know of is PInfocom, available for Amiga, PC and
several Unix systems.  It is based on an early version of ITF, and is
prettier, but plays less of the Z-Code versions.  I do not know where it is
available from.

WHERE TO GET MORE GAMES

Activision released two packages known as the Lost Treasures of Infocom,
Volumes I and II.  These contain 20 games in Volume I, and about a dozen in
Volume II.  Together, these consist of most Infocom games ever made, so it
is an invaluable package.  You can probably buy them used somewhere-and
since the data files are machine-independent, it doesn't matter if you
obtain an Amiga, PC, or Mac version as long as you have an interpreter.

I doubt any more commercial games are being released in Z-Code format, but
that may change in the future if companies take note of the devoted fans
out there.

ftp.gmd.de is the main archive for new adventures, as well.

BUT I DON'T HAVE INTERNET ACCESS!

Well, if you at least have a modem, I should eventually upload these
interpreters, the Inform compiler, and some games to Whidbey Winds BBS.

The purpose of this list is the following: To keep the software development
on the Amiga, the users must concentrate on products providing good
services.  By services I mean, a technical support, bug fixes patches
regulary sended to the customers and new release planned in the futur.

Why buying a software not longer supported or enhanced ?

That's the purpose of this list.  Buy the right software done by companies
which care about the Amiga business.

I CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ERRORS AND/OR OMISSIONS.  However, every

                       REVIEW: OPUSFTP AND FTPMOUNT
  Scott Boutwell                                     demoman@teleport.com
===========================================================================

Well this is my first attempt at writing anything for Amiga Report such as
a Review.  My intention for writing this is pointing out a VERY easy way to
access FTP with Opus.  These programs have been the BEST method of using
FTP I have found so far.  I don't care for alot of the FTP Clients
currently for the Amiga, but have found I REALLY enjoy using FTP with Opus.

I'll list address information and where to obtain a copy of these at the
end of this review.

Well first off I'd like to take a look at OpusFTP.  This jewel is a product
of GP Software and was written by Andrew Dunbar and Dr.  Greg Perry.  
According to the documentation that comes with this fantastic product it
will be included with the release of the next FULL upgrade of Opus (5.2)
toward the end of 1995.  First off OpusFTP requires some software to work,
namely AmigaDOS 2.0+, Directory Opus 5.1+ and a TCP/IP connection.  The
TCP/IP connection can be done with AmiTCP/IP version 4.0+, or with MLink.

Installation is VERY simple, just click on the Install Icon.  For those
that don't trust the installation scripts moving the files to the
appropriate places will take just a few moments.  Edit the ftp.config file
to add the 3 permanent address's you wish to have and your ready to go.  So
this is really quick and easy to set up.

The Demo version that I tested only allows for 1 user entry and 2 anonymous
entries in the address book.  The Demo version also is limited to a single
FTP connection but the Full allows for any number of simultaneous
connection.  According to the author it also doesn't have a working abort
button.

Reload Opus and the NEW commands will be available in the Function editor.
With these you should be well on the way to using FTP from Opus.

For those that want a little more control there is a (currently limited)
ARexx port.  It handles about 8 commands, but there may be more ARexx
support in a Future version.

There are 2 preconfigured versions of FTP toolbars one in text and an image
based one.  One problem I did have with OpusFTP was with the Preconfigured
Ftp-Image toolbar.  It was too narrow to allow a user to grab it and move
it around the screen.  I solved this by creating my own and in the process
got creative and designed a bunch of buttons for Internet for myself.  So
this was really not much of a problem.

Once you have things set up start up your TCP/IP connection and click on an
address in the address book.  The FTP site will pop-up in a lister window,
just as if it were a Drive on your machine.  You can read, view, copy,
rename and delete files according to the abilities you have at the FTP site
you are connected to.

Most FTP sites will work with OpusFTP but there a some that will not.

Those that will not are:
 VAX/VMS
 VM/CMS
 Some OS/2 server work, others will not.

Those that have been tested and work are:
  Unix (all flavors)
  Amiga
  News-OS
  PC's runnin Novell NetWare
  NeXT
  Windows NT
  Macintosh
  Some OS/2 servers

There are minor bugs with OpusFTP at the present, like incorrect
Timestamps, and having to quit OpusFTP manually (Note: Even if you quit
Opus itself.) As I said they are Minor bugs.

I've found this program VERY reliable and love having the ability to
navigate the net from under Opus.  This way if I don't like the interface I
use for FTP, I have no one else to blame but myself.

Another problem I did note is that there currently is NO way to obtain a
FULL version of this program listed in the Docs.  I guess we will have to
wait for the release of version 5.2 of Opus to get this fine program.  I
also guess we will have to purchase version 5.2 to get this program rather
than being able to purchase it as an add on.

The next product I'd like to look at is FTPMount written by Evan Scott.  
Note the version I looked at was version 0.7 obviously still in BETA form
but it does work.  It also can be used with Directory Opus, but was NOT
intended ONLY to be used with Directory Opus.  It is intended to be an FTP
file system rather than another FTP client.  Which means you can set up
common FTP sites to permanently appear in file requesters.  Because of the
FTP protocol (RFC 959), there are some limitations that apply to FTP: these
prevent it from supporting all file system actions fully.

A couple of these are:

       Only one file may be open at a time for a given site.
       A file may only be open for reading or writing, NOT both.
       Seeking is not possible.
       Case sensitivity.
       Unix soft links are ALWAYS assumed to be directories.
       The '.' and '..' have been filtered out.
       Comments are not supported.
       Protection bits cannot be modified.
       MakeLink is not supported.

(Note: These limitations are a trimmed down version of the Authors comments
in the Introduction)

Also there are NO types of sites that don't currently work with this system
to my knowledge and none listed in the documentation.

Requirements: Documentation suggests using AmiTCP/IP 4.0+, at this point
I'm not sure whether or not it will support MLink.  To really be useful
this is a MUST.  It also needs AmigaDos 2.0+.

Installation: Is simple, there again is an installation script but manual
installation is fairly easy as well.  And the author details enough
information about how to do it, that if you are familiar with AmigaDOS at
all you should be able to accomplish this.

The source code is included with the release, thanks Evan for doing this. 
For those of us that are just beginning to code it helps to have some
examples to break down and look at.

This program was a bit more than I was looking for to add FTP to Directory
Opus.  It is however the ONLY method of adding it to ALL versions of
Directory Opus as well as other disk based file managers.

Looking at both programs in comparison...

Use: I'd have to give it to OpusFTP.  It's very simple to use and to
understand how to get it working.  I have not accessed a site so far that I
haven't been able to access with OpusFTP.

Installation: While both have installation scripts that are about equal in
ease.  Manually OpusFTP is easier to install.  It's really a NO BRAINER to
get this up and configured.  If you ever created a button with Directory
Opus you should have NO problems.

Compatibility: When looking at how the programs stand up against one
another in being able to be used by other programs.  FTP mount wins HANDS
down, since OpusFTP is intended ONLY to be used with Version 5.1 of Opus.

Documentation: Both have very well done AmigaGuide files that cover
installation and usage.  The manual installation of FTPMount could have
been a bit clearer but it gets the information across to install it.

I guess it would really be up to what the user is looking for here.  
Whether they are looking for something that is a quick and easy gadget for
Opus or something they can access from anything.  Although OpusFTP has an
Arexx interface, it is VERY limited at this point, making access by other
programs not very good.  But since it was intended for Opus, it does what
it was intended for.

My personal choice was OpusFTP, since I don't really have any use for
Mounting an FTP site to my AmigaDOS.  Both programs are excellent and faily
simple to install.  Grab a copy of either from AmiNet.

@node REVIEW2 "Review: IMANDI Pro from Egad International
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                REVIEW: IMANDI PRO FROM EGAD INTERNATIONAL
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Difficult as it may be to believe, there are apparently people out there
who make money using their Amigas.  Or who use their Amigas to make money.
Or who simply happen to utilize an Amiga somewhere in their business, to
track sales, keep inventory, write invoices, that sort of thing.

If you're one of these lucky people, you may want to give IMANDI Pro a
look.

IMANDI (Inventory Management AND Invoicing) is designed to make the
bookkeeping process easier in its two title areas.  You'll need OS 2.04 or
better, 1.5 megs of RAM or more, and having a hard drive and 020+ would be
a nice idea.

IMANDI will open a custom screen based on your Workbench screenmode, but
seems to be limited to about 640x400 usable size.

It's relatively easy to get started.  Depending on what your priorities
are, you will want to start either in the Customer or Inventory database.
Presuming you want to start by entering your products first, you'll be
confronted with the Inventory Editor, where you can create as many
databases as you choose with as many items as you choose in each.  Your
fields are straightforward (part name, description, your cost and the
price, quantity sold and units, quantity on hand and recommended restock
amount, weight, supplier, and tax and discount flags), and are entered with
the keyboard.  There is also a text field below the entries that tracks
inventory changes (restocks and purchases).

After dealing with your inventory, you'll want some customers.  Frequent
customers can be saved as individual files, so you can track their total
purchases, contact information, credit card number, and the like.  You can
also give them customized tax rates on parts, labor, travel, and mileage,
to suit their location, and grant them special discount status.

The "Prefs" feature doesn't, unfortunately, cover such usual items as
screenmode and colors.  Instead, there are a number of global variables to
deal with, such as labor cost (both on-site and in-house), travel costs,
tax rates, default discount rates, shipper lists, and the terms-of-sale.

Once this has been dealt with, it's time to create some invoices.  You can
either edit a previously saved invoice or generate a new one-both use the
same process.  The Customer, Header, Invoice, and Inventory Editor windows
all pop up at once.  You can essentially fill them out in any order,
however, going from Header to Customer to Inventory (to load a product
database) to Invoice seems most logical.
You enter the salesperson's name, PO number and Part numbers, if
applicable, invoice date (automatic) and shipping date, shipper and FOB,
and the terms (Sale, Net 30, etc.)

Then select your customer, go to the Invoice editor, and sell them items
(you can enter partial names and have the editor search and complete them
through the database).  You can also bill for labor, travel, mileage, or
enter text strings ("babble" entries).  Press F6 to print, and you're off.

Shipping support is a bit weak-you enter the shipping amount when you
select the print option, but IMANDI will not calculate it for you.  The
string that tells your customer how it is being shipped is just that-a text
string with no other value.

Now, about the printing...

IMANDI comes with three PageStream files and accompanying printouts of the
three basic invoice types IMANDI supports (which basically vary only in the
option to turn discount display and Year-To-Date sale display off).  The
idea is that you either duplicate the invoices given to you in the IMANDI
package (which aren't exactly high-quality printouts and come folded in
half) or print your own using PageStream, adding your corporate logo and
information however you see fit (since IMANDI doesn't support any direct
way to include this information, but there is plenty of room in the
upper-left hand corner of the invoice to place it.)  The printing options
seem rather spartan, essentially only allowing you to print to PRT: or a
file.

What else is there to do?  Well, the Inventory Editor allows you to
generate 3 types of reports: Inventory reports, Page reports (individual
item printouts), and Value reports (amount sold versus cost of items on
hand).  Again, you can print to PRT: or a file, spartan but reasonably
effective.

What's there to like?  Well, it is an effective solution for me, for
example, faced with the occasional necessity to generate an invoice for
consulting or journalistic work without the need for excessive bookkeeping
or detail (such as accounts payable or receivable: the terms of sale are
just a text entry, not a piece of data interpreted by IMANDI.)  For
example, IMANDI will tell you when it's time to stock more Pop-Tarts, but
they won't tell you if Herman's Breakfast Emporium is delinquent in his Net
30-1.5% 60 Pop Tart account.  You can always look through invoices you've
generated for Herman's and find out what he owes you, but it's not
automated.

The user interface is very intuitive and to-the-point, and the manual
(which is also available in context-sensitive AmigaGuide on disk) explains
each text field and button in the program.

On the other hand, there are some quirks that make IMANDI a bit tarnished.
For one, it's written in CanDo, meaning it's no speed demon.  While
response was decent on my 3000/030, using a memory-enhanced but
unaccelerated A500/600/1000/2000 may not be as feasible as it sounds.  The
interface isn't configurable.  The windows are not resizeable yet they take
up the entire width of the screen.  There is a documented option to
zip-shrink the Customer Editor (the largest, well over half the screen),
using F9.  However, there is no logical explanation for this nor any way a
user would "stumble" on that solution.  The lack of advanced accounting may
also turn some off.

It's very difficult for business software to find a sense of identity in
the Amiga market.  IMANDI is quite good at inventory management and
acceptably capable of generating invoices, but is not going to be a
full-blown accounting system for your business needs.  As part of a suite,
however, or for the small business with accounting needs that can be
handled easily by hand, IMANDI makes a good investment.

===========================================================================
                         FIRST LOOK: VOODOO E-MAIL
                           By @{" Addison Laurent " link ADDISON}
===========================================================================

FIRST LOOK:  Voodoo E-Mail
This is a "first look" - a opportunity to see what is coming soon. It is not a
full review, and the program is not being examined as extensively nor with the
expectations as a program being reviewed that has been released.  There are
features that will probably be implemented before release, and bugs/problems
fixed.

Product:
Voodoo - The Multimedia E-Mailer
Projected registration price:
35 USD, 50 DEM, or 150 FIM
Demonstration version to be available on AmiNet after release for 30 day
evaluation.

Author:
Osma Ahvenlampi
Osma.Ahvenlampi@hut.fi
http://www.niksula.cs.hut.fi/~oahvenla/voodoo/

Background:
E-Mail is possibly the most understandable, most used side of the Internet. As
the internet has aged (progressed could be a contested term by some of the
older-timers) more applications have been developed, more ideas and standards
have evolved as ways to trade information, complete files, etc.

Several years ago, Internet e-mail was almost completely ASCII text, and if a
non-ASCII file were to be transmitted via e-mail, required the use of
conversion programs to convert these to ASCII, and back to binary when
received.

Ideas and standards have been proposed and tried to handle these demands.

Several Amiga programs have recently been developed or are in the development
process so we can utilize the latest tools of the Internet to interchange
data.

To support the MIME standard, Osma Ahvenlampi is in the process of developing
Voodoo.

First Look:
Voodoo is a E-mail program, being developed with the new @{" ClassAct " link REVIEW3B}
GUI development API.

The projected release date is currently December 1995.  According to the
documentation, there will be a registered version, with enhanced abilities,
and a demonstration version which will be redistributable.

While Voodoo is not yet ready for release, it is a quite functional program, 
one with most features implemented and working.

It is not a complete e-mail system.  It is, instead, a E-mail reader.  Other
programs must be configured to receive and send e-mail.  The configuration
I use is @{" AmiPOP " link REVIEW3B} to retrieve my mail from my local ISP, and SMTPpost
from @{" InetUtils 1.4 " link REVIEW3B} to send mail.

Voodoo has MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) support, allowing for
transparent attaching of files to e-mail.  This is a great improvement over
the UUencoding and UUdecoding of binary files and either sending seperately or
appending to mail.

The user needs only to click on the "attach" icon, then using the requester,
pick the file(s) to attach.  Voodoo uses datatypes to identify and display 
attached files with incoming mail.  

Voodoo is shaping up to be a quite functional, useful program.

The final program is still being formed and finalized, but in the last two weeks,
several releases have come out, polishing parts, implementing more features.

Release should be very soon, both from the appearance of the beta test, and
the notes in the archive.

@node REVIEW4 "Review: CD-Write from Schatztruhe"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                     REVIEW: CD-WRITE FROM SCHATZTRUHE
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Neat gimmick or worthwhile utility?

I'm still not sure I've decided.

CD-Write's intention is not to change the laws of physics, enabling your
garden-variety CD-ROM drive to write to what by all rights is a read-only
medium.  Instead, by introducing a new filesystem and device driver,
CD-Write redirects what AmigaDOS interprets as "writes" to a hard drive, so
that added, deleted, and modified files, icon positions, and the like are
"saved" for future use.

Once the (quite straightforward and well-explained in the manual)
installation is completed, you gain a new drive (CDW0:), and all CDs
inserted generate two Workbench icons-one the original (CD0: or
equivalent), the other prefixed by "CDW-", the CDW0: drive and the one
you'll want to interact with to take advantage of the package.

Aside from this duality, the operation of CD-Write is transparent and
essentially seamless, the only snag being that any time you "write" to your
CD-ROM, you'll get an accompanying clunk on your hard drive, and any time a
new CD is inserted, your special CD-Write hard drive directory will be
scanned for information, and that information will be utilized by the
filesystem, be it icon positioning, added files, whatever.

Practical application?  Well, for the user who likes ultimate
configuration, the ability to save tooltypes, new icons or positioning, add
scripts, and remove unsightly unnecessary programs (or icons) is going to
be a welcome addition to what is probably a very custom Workbench.  For BBS
or FTP site operators (and multiple CD drives are supported, according to
the documentation), the ability to remove undesired files (for example, if
you don't offer access to Aminet's game directory to newly validated
members of your BBS, for example, you can simply let registered users
access CD0: while the newbies only get the CDW0: that is missing that
directory), integrate new versions or add software to a single directory
structure (say you get a new version of Deluxe Galaga and your users would
rather just see it in the Aminet game directory than have to scan another
filebase for it, you can simply "copy" it over), or just plain screw around
with the CD's configuration would be a plus.

The author, Ralph Babel (and you'll never forget his name since he names
all of the utilities and the filesystem after himself) also suggests that
it could be used to remove virus-laden programs from the CD.  My personal
opinion is that anybody stung by a CD-ROM virus would probably have done
far worse to the CD before they think of CD-Writing it out of existance,
but that's just me.  The concept of using CD-Write to assist in the
creation of a new revision of a CD is also one offered (and considering
Babel's association with the assembly of the Meeting Pearls CD, one
referred to in the manual text, I'm not surprised.)  I'm not one to take up
such a task, but I can see how it would be useful.

To-the-point information is included to aid the user around certain
filesystem-and-CD-ROM-standard quirks, such as the handling of RockRidge
extensions, although such incompatibilities are unlikely to raise their
ugly heads too often.

What sort of performance hits do you get using CD-Write?  The manual
diplomatically says, in effect, that speed varies depending on the speed of
the hard drive.  But CD-Write is very efficient in its usage-most deletion
operations, for example, take up less than 100 bytes, including entire
directories.  My example of deleting the entire Aminet game directory on
Aminet 7 cost my hard drive less than 200 bytes and (using a totally
unscientific stopwatch test) about .1 seconds of access time when the CD
was inserted.

Of course, all the changes are temporary.  Utilities are included to undo
changes, or by mere brute force, the entire scope of changes can be deleted
by simply deleting the hard drive subdirectory containing the changes for
the individual disc.  And, of course, the information is still accesible
through regular CD0:.

So, where has this gotten you?  An essentially seamless method to customize
CD-ROMs, with little performance loss and storage cost, is here.  Do you
need it?  That's your decision.

==                      Amiga Report Mailing List                        ==
===========================================================================

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to listserv@itesmvf1.rzs.itesm.mx.

Your subject header will be ignored.  In the body of the message, enter

subscribe areport <your real name>

ie: 

subscribe areport A. R. Reader

The system will automatically pull your e-mail address from the message
header.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!             **

          *** The following is only for Australian readers!  ***

To circumvent the new pay-per-megabyte system for Australian Internet
communication, Paul Reece has been kind enough to set up an AUSTRALIAN-ONLY
mailing list, to save his fellow countrymen some money.

You can join the list by sending mail to:   majordomo@info.tas.gov.au

with the single line (in body of message):

subscribe ar

Amiga Report will then be bounced to you.

==                        UUDecoding Amiga Report                        ==
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

==                    Amiga Report Writing Guidelines                    ==
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

     4.  Please send us your article in ASCII format.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.

Please stipulate as well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to
the editor.
