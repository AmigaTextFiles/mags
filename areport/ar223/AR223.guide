%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I would like to take a little time...um, er space here to thank Jason
Compton and David Tiberio for the help that they both have given me, and
for making Amiga Report such a great magazine. 

Jason has spent quite a bit of time working with companies trying to
get products to review. He also has started the AR CoverDisk, the new
listserv for email subscriptions to Amiga Report, and has been there
to take control and get Amiga Report out when I've been over burdened, and
away on vacation. He's done much more to make this online magazine the
wonderful piece of work it is. :)

David Tiberio as well has helped out tremendously. Out of his own pocket
he has provided the Amiga Online Reference Manual for the Contest, and the
money to mail out the prizes. David also wrote the installer script, and 
the display script that we use with Amiga Report. With all this, he still
takes quite a bit of time writing articles for AR and keeping the contest
puzzles interesting!

I sincerely appreciate their efforts! Thanks!

I would also like to thank SideWinder for donating the Future Shock II
audio CDROM, Point of View Computing for donating Subversion 1.0, Merrill
Callaway for The ARexx Reference Manual, and finally Walnut Creek CDROM
for donating the Aminet CDROM. All of which are prizes that are given away
to winners of the AR Contest.

Last, I would like to thank all of you that contribute to Amiga Report
with articles, ideas, and information. I would REALLY like to thank all
of you who simply read Amiga Report. All of you make this happen!

A month of many thanks!

Problems with Commodore's Creditors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Amiga Report 27 Jul 94

The liquidators appointed by the Bahaman courts have received four
proposals to buy Commodore. Those being Amstrad, Samsung, Philips, and
Commodore UK.

But problems exist. The lawyers for Commodore's principal creditors 
(those being Prudential Insurance Company of America, Anchor National Life 
Insurance Company, and Daewoo Telecom and Daewoo Corporation) would like 
to have the bankruptcy proceedings moved or at least have parallel 
proceedings opened in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.

The main creditors want this for two reasons. One under Bahaman law,
creditors have an advisory role, while in the U.S., the creditors would
have more say over the disposition of assets. Two Bahaman law only permits
liquidators to go back three months before bankruptcy to judge and
possible reverse management actions involving assets, while American law
permits the liquidators to go back a year. The creditors have questions
regarding the actions of Commodore, especially the actions of Mehdi Ali.

The Bahaman court has rejected motions from the creditors to move the
proceedings to New York. So the creditors are asking the U.S. Bankruptcy
courts to seize jurisdiction or open parallel proceedings.

Another part of the tangled web seems to be with some of the prospective
buyers. They are concerned about the amount of debt owed by Commodore,
which is approximately $145 million.

NewTek and Prime Image Enter Worldwide Markets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Topeka, Ks., February 18, 1994 - NewTek, the company which launched the 
desktop video industy with the introduction of the Video Toaster, and 
Prime Image, a leader in transcoding time base correctors, synchronizers,
standards converters and still video stores, have announced an agreement
that will let the Video Toaster bridge worldwide video standards.
 
The agreement brings together the Video Toaster with Prime Image's 
Passport 4000 device that offers a digital video signal handling 
capabilities such as conversion to international video standards including
PAL, SECAM, PAL-M PAL-N AND NTSC 4.43.  The Passport 4000 also offers time
base correction/synchronization.
 
"NewTek has built a billion dollar industry on the strength of Video 
Toaster technology," said Bill Hendershot, founder and president of Prime
Image, Inc. "Prime Image's customers around the world have let us know 
there's tremendous pent-up demand for the Video Toaster in diverse video 
format applications.  given this demand and given the standards conversion 
technology Prime Image has pioneered, it's a natural fit for Prime Image 
and NewTek to work together."
 
"I was very impressed how well the the Passport 4000 immediately 
complements the Video Toaster," said Tim Jension, founder, owner and 
president of NewTek.  "The Video Toaster equipped with the Passport 4000 
is going to bring desktop television production to vast new markets."
 
 
The Passport 4000 converts from one standard to another with a new "pass 
through" interpolation technique that does not degrade the signal.  The 
Passport 4000 also offers time base correction/synchronization, digital 
effects, and adds AT bus expansion slots for the Amiga 4000. The time base 
corrector/synchronzier can transcode composite or Y/C out and features an 
ultra-stable freeze frame/field. 
 
NewTek + Prime Image = Emmy2
 
Hendershot invented digital time-based correction 20 years ago.   Prime 
Image has built on this core technology and expanded its application 
throughout the video industry.  Jenison invented the Video Toaster and 
introduced it in 1990 and it quickly became the standard for inexpensive,
broadcast quality television production.  The engineering Commmittee of 
the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences have awarded the Emmy for 
Technical Achievement to both NewTek and Prime Image.
 
The products are currently shipping.  NewTek (booth #11050) and Prime
Image (booth #17184) will be demonstrating the products at the National 
Association of Broadcasters Convention in Las Vegas, March 21-24.

NewTek, Inc. announces ScreamerNet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Las Vegas, March 20, 1994 - NewTek, Inc., the company that brought 
professional video and animation production to the masses with the Video 
Toaster introduces ScreamerNet for LightWave 3D users.

ScreamerNet is the evolution of the Screamer rendering hardware 
announced last August.  "As we pursued development of the Screamer 
hardware it became evident that high speed processors were quickly 
becoming commodity items."  said NewTek President Tim Jenison.  "Rather
than NewTek trying to keep up with the hardware wars we decided to release 
software that will allow LightWave users to select the rendering machine 
of their choice."

ScreamerNet is a rendering software package that allows LightWave 3D users 
to take advantage of the rendering power offered by workstations from a 
variety of vendors. The software is Windows NT compatible and will support 
hardware that utilizes Intel, MIPS and DEC Alpha processor chips. 
ScreamerNet's suggested retail price is $1995 and will support up to eight 
machines.

"LightWave 3D has become the animation package of choice for most of the 
cutting edge action shows in Hollywood," stated Jenison. "Television 
programs such as seaQuest DSV, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Babylon 5 
and RoboCop are using the Video Toaster and LightWave 3D to push the 
envelope of visual effects. With the introduction of ScreamerNet they 
will have access to the rendering power they need to completely redefine 
the standards for effects in television and film production."

"As the makers of revolutionary products like Video Toaster and the new 
Video Toaster Flyer,  NewTek means high technology at an unbelievably low 
price point," said NewTek's Marketing Director Donetta Colboch. "While 
ScreamerNet represents a dramatic breakthrough in 3D rendering 
price/performance, it's designed and priced for the professional 
animation facility."

NewTek will be showcasing the ScreamerNet software at the National 
Association of Broadcasters Convention, March 21-24 in Booth #11050.

NewTek stuns NAB with the introduction of 
the Video Toaster Flyer tapeless editing system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Las Vegas, March 20, 1994 - NewTek, Inc., the pioneers of the desktop 
video industry, announce the Video Toaster Flyer, the first D2 quality 
tapeless editing system.  With the Flyer priced at $3995, NewTek once 
again shatters the price/performance standards for broadcast quality 
video production just as they did with the release of the Video Toaster
in 1990. 

"When we originally conceived the idea for the Video Toaster it was to 
provide all the tools necessary to create broadcast quality television 
at a price almost anyone could afford." said Tim Jenison, NewTek 
President. "With the introduction of the Video Toaster Flyer we have made
the tools even more accessible, reducing the cost of production by an 
order of magnitude." 

The Video Toaster Flyer is the result of more than seven years of intense 
research and development.  The Video Toaster Flyer offers D2 quality video 
and CD quality audio editing in a tapeless, non-linear environment.  The 
Video Toaster Flyer tapeless editor allows the user to dial in the video 
quality, up to lossless D2 quality.  All video data is stored on computer 
hard drives that allow the user to access particular segments 
instantaneously without having to shuttle from one point to another as in
traditional tape editing. The system employs an easy to use, drag and drop
storyboard interface.

The breakthrough technology in the Video Toaster Flyer is NewTek's 
revolutionary new VTASC compression algorithm.  VTASC sets a new 
standard for hard disk based video compression by combining D2, broadcast 
quality video with unprecedented compression ratios.  NewTek is currently 
in discussions with a number of vendors looking to license VTASC and 
Video Toaster Flyer technology.

The Video Toaster Flyer continues NewTek's tradition of providing easy to 
use, broadcast quality video production tools, at unbelievably low prices.
The complete Video Toaster Flyer system provides the ability to 
incorporate all of the tools from the Video Toaster; digital video 
effects, paint graphics, titles and animations directly into productions 
edited from one simple interface. For Toaster LightWave 3D users, the 
tapeless editor will allow the blending of moving video easily and 
seamlessly into animated video productions.

NewTek will be demonstrating the Video Toaster Flyer at the National 
Association of Broadcasters Convention, March 21-24 in Booth #11050.

Video Toaster Developers' Conference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Las Vegas, March 20, 1994 P NewTek Inc., developers of the Video Toaster 
and the new Video Toaster Flyer, today announced plans for a national 
Video Toaster Developers' Conference. The Conference will be held in Los 
Angeles this fall as part of Avid Publications' Video Toaster Expo. Avid 
Publications is the publisher of Video Toaster User magazine.

RItUs the right time for a developers' conference.S according to NewTek 
President Tim Jenison.  RWith the upcoming release of our D2 quality non-
linear editor, the Video Toaster Flyer, the Toaster really becomes a 
complete video production studio that fits on a desktop.  We see great 
opportunities for third-party development of additional tools for the 
system.  Professional producers can expect to have the FlyerUs lossless D2
quality output working in conjunction with the edit controllers, decks, 
and effects devices they already use." 

The conference is an important milestone for the Toaster, said Jim Plant, 
President of Avid Publications. An entire industry has exploded around 
the Toaster since its release three years ago, and with new products like 
the Video Toaster Flyer, the growth in this market will accelerate even 
faster than analysts have predicted.

AugmenTek announces MultiVol Mirror v1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MultiVol(TM) Mirror makes a copy of or "mirrors" a file to one or more
volumes as the file is being written the master volume. Any "file"
that can be opened for writing can be mirrored, including the
console/shell (input is also mirrored). Normally, you would map one
master volume (e.g., a disk) to one mirror volume (or directory on the
same volume).  The full path to a real file is constructed on the
mirrored volume(s), as well as file comments and protection.

All you need to do is set up the mapping of master volume to mirror
volume -- you can use MVM's drag and drop graphical user interface to
do this -- and use MVM: before the name of the file to mirror (or in a
file requester).  It's that easy.

Using MultiVol Mirror (MVM), you can:

* partially recover from accidentally overwriting a file (getting back
  an earlier version)

* completely recover from deleting a master file and disk failures, to
  the extent MVM was used

* automatically backup any file every time the file is written

* transparently record shell or console input and output

* safely use RAM as a fast disk

  With RAM specified as the master volume and your hard drive or
  diskette as the mirrored volume, you can edit a file in RAM,
  benefitting from fast loads of the file.  When you save it, it is
  placed both in RAM and on the hard drive/diskette automatically.

* view the contents of any file as it is being written

* map more than one master volume to more than one mirror volume

* AmigaDOS/Kickstart(TM) 2.04 or higher needed


MultiVol Mirror 1.0 and online hypertext documentation: $45.
 INTRODUCTORY OFFER (until Nov. 1, 1994): $30.

All prices are in U.S. currency.

Shipping/handling is $3.00 in the U.S., $5.00 elsewhere. WA state
residents add 8.2% sales tax.  Terms are checks or money orders drawn

From: John McCoy <JMCCOY@WordPerfect.com>
Subject:  Amigaman vs. Creative

With all the negative reports coming in about Creative Computers, I 
thought I would write in and share one of the many positive experiences 
I have had with Amigaman.

I called them up and ordered 4 CD32 titles and a replacement Joypad. 
They said it would ship on monday (2nd day Fed Ex). On wednesday my 
order hadn't come, but I thought I would wait another day before I 
called them about it. On thursday it still hadn't come, so I called 
them at the 1-800 #. According to the guy taking orders my order had 
shipped on monday. Thinking my order must have gotten misplaced by 
Fed Ex I asked for the tracking #. He gave me another number to call 
and get that information. When I called the other number for the tracking
number, they found that a mistake had been made and my order didn't ship 
on monday. The lady said sorry and promised me that they would ship it out 
that day with next day delivery at no extra charge. That alone was good 
enough for me, but much to my surprize when I got the package on friday 
(the next day) they had also included a Fresh Fish Gold CD for free. It's
companies like this that make Mail Ordering a pleasure. If your upset 
with Creative may I suggest going with Amigaman!

Aaargh.  There's nothing worse than waiting.  It's bad when you wait for
something good, it's bad when you wait for something bad.  It's even
worse when you're not sure whether what you're waiting for will be good
or bad.  That's just terrible.

But that's the point we're at.  The people who know aren't talking, the
people who don't know keep asking the same questions and formulating
rumors which only confuse matters.  Worse yet, we don't even know if what
the people know is even anything significant!

This Commodore business is driving me nuts.

I wondered, not too long ago, what it would take to convince non-Amiga
developers to join the fray, either for the first time or after they'd
abandoned it earlier.  Now I'm wondering what it will take to convince
CURRENT Amiga developers to stick with the game to see what the next
round will be like.

Unfortunately, I haven't the faintest idea.  Huge projects are still
undertaken by Amiga developers, and there are still small ones as well,
but there's just not much of anything to talk about right now.  Talk
comes and goes, but nothing is resolved.

No news from Duncan Fraser.  I'm still waiting for him to call me with
information, when/if he gets any.

And that's about all there is to do...wait.

                               - - - - - - - - -

I got a new job recently.  Starting soon, I'll be reviewing games for
the US print magazine Amiga Game Zone.

Oh, sure, this isn't the first time a writer in Amiga Report has appeared
in another magazine (Douglas Nakikihara's articles show up all over the
place, and we reprint his from another magazine to begin with.)  Still,
it's a first for me, anyway.  As I find myself doing all too often,
I'm waiting for a package from the editor so I can get started...

[Ed: *grin*]

I do an inordinate amount of sitting around waiting for things to arrive
so I can do something about them.

                               - - - - - - - - - -

A company called CD Solutions has developed a new monitor, compatible with
the Amiga's video demands.  It is a 14 inch monitor, .28 dot pitch, and
maxes out non-interlace at 800x600.  It says it can handle NTSC or PAL
inputs, but the spec sheet does not make it clear if that means composite
or RGB input.

The cost is $550.  This is a bit much: I thought the A1962 monitor was
expensive at $500, but this is taking it beyond the point of 
acceptability.

In my conversation with John Millich, it became clear that he doesn't 
quite grasp what the Amiga community was all about...he seemed to slowly 
realize that we don't all own Toasters.  I'm supposed to get a chance to 
see the monitor for a couple of hours in August.  Maybe I'll be blown 
away.  We'll see.

                               - - - - - - - - - - -

That's it for this week, I have nothing more clever to say.  Hang in
there, at least until we hear something new.

Description
-----------

This is the second colour bubble jet Canon has made, the first being 
BJ-800. It is about two feet by nine inches by six inches in size.  It 
has a 100 sheet paper feeder and can hold ten envelopes.  It has five 
buttons which make the control panel (Power, On-Line, Form Feed, Colour 
Control, and Paper Control) plus twelve dip switches for font control 
and other things.

Cost
----

650 Canadian Dollars  -- about 600 American
10 Canadian Dollars for a Cartridge
9 Canadian Dollars for 3 refill bottle

Features
--------

It has eight printer fonts including draft, and to change them you have to
move three small dip switches.  It has four separate ink cartridges (BCMY)
and a separate print head which are both very easy to setup.  Each 
cartridge can hold 9 Ml of ink which dries 80 times faster than the HP
DeskJet ink.  It also has a paper tray that pulls out from the front side
to catch finished papers.  It prints up to A4 paper and has a nice paper
feeding system which is quiet and accurate.  It also has a Black boost
for dark clear text.

Needed
------

CanonStudio - This brilliant program by Wolf Faust is a must for using the
printer since it includes printer drivers and a Iff printing program. For
my printer I used an old version I found on an Aminet CD, version 1.55, 
but it worked perfectly. I'll have to get the full version later.

Paper - Regular 20 pound 8 1/2 x 11 will work but for graphics I found 50%
cotton paper worked much better. I haven't had time to try clay coated 
paper but the same I saw was most impressive.  The best result are on back
print film which is printed on the rough side flip horizontally then the
ink will sink though to the smooth glossy side. Of course it costs $.50 a
sheet but for that quality why not?

Results
-------

After having he printer for almost a week I have to say I am still
impressed with the text and graphics outputs.  After living with a 24-pin
Star Rainbow 2420 for three years I was used to banding, but there is
little if none.  Only pure black graphics have noticeable banding.  Text
output was crisp in PageStream and Final Copy II, even IBM programs run
under CrossPC worked great.  I used the BJ-800 drivers for Workbench that
were part of the CanonStudio package and Epson LQ-2550 for PageStream.

For the best outputs I used CanonStudio to boost gamma up eight, red up 
fourty, and used Halftone A-16 dithering.

I have ADPro 2.5 and found its results to be disappointing, if anyone has
better printing schemes tell me

Overall
-------

If you want to do graphics and text buy this printer it will not let you
down in quality and cost.

Greetings  to all Amiga Report readers.  My name's Celso Martinho
and  I'm  a  very  proud Amiga user from Portugal.  For those who
don't  know, Portugal is small country in Europe, near Spain.  We
were  supposed to be in the World Cup '94 but the Portuguese team
had really bad luck in their last qualification game.  Ahem!  :-)

Jason Compton told me to write an article or two for AR.  He said
that  I would probably like it.  Well, here I am writing whatever
comes  to  my  mind.   If  you don't like what you read here then
complain to jcompton@bbs.xnet.com :-).

First, let me try to explain to you the general situation here in
Europe concerning the Amiga:

The United Kingdom dominates the market.  In fact, they sell more
Amigas  in  the  UK than we sell PCs in Portugal.  Amiga it's the
personal  computer  that sells more over there (yes, it's true!).
If  you  speak  with an English Amiga "guru", you don't see stuff
like "my Amiga does this and your PC doesn't, blah, blah...".  C=
UK  has  made  a  tremendous  great job and was really successful
transmitting  the  Amiga  potentials  to the consumers.  If C= UK
buys  the  Amiga technology, I see a bright future for the Amiga.
Most  English  Amiga  users  have  low end systems like A1200s or
A4000/030.   CD-32  is also a best seller and knocks down Sega or
Nintendo  by  a  long  distance.   By  reading  UK  magazines and
contacting  many  shops  from  London, we can obviously tell that
there  are  a  few  areas  in  which  the  Amiga  is not yet very
explored.   For instance, the communication and Network areas.  A
curious  thing  about England is that they seem not to worry much
about the C= situation.  That demonstrates the confidence that C=
UK  has  earned  from their clients.  Another positive point, and
this has to be with the culture it self and with the high average
way of living, is that the piracy percentage is very low.

The  Amiga is also well implanted in France.  It's very difficult
to  hear  news  from France, they are very discrete.  They have a
few  magazines that I read occasionally.  C= France seems to make
some  advertising in TV and other medias.  There are a few French
Amiga  software producers.  I've seen excellent games coming from
the  Eifel  tower  country and many high quality PD software.  In
what  comes to communications and Networking, you can't find many
Amiga  users  with  Internet access (remember, complains to jcomp
ton@bbs.xnet.com  :-).   Their  biggest  information  bulletin is
Minitel,  a  Videotext  network.  It's so big that you can find a
Minitel  terminal is almost every house.  I can access to Minitel
via  the Portuguese VTX.  I was browsing a little bit and I found
many   Amiga  corners,  some  very  interesting  like  electronic
magazines  with  software reviews, etc...  There is also a French
IRC channel for Amiga sometimes.

Now  Germany.   You  can't  imagine  the quantity of high quality
professional  commercial  software that Germans produce and don't
release outside Germany.  As for what we see, I don't need to say
much.   Just  take a look at MUI, Magic Workbench, Tools Manager,
TERM   and   many  others.   There  are  definitively  many  good
programmers  in Germany.  But software is not all, there are also
a lot of hardware producers.  Germany is also known in Europe, if
not  on  earth,  as  the country where the telecommunications are
more  developed.   The  Internet  .de  domain  is filled of Amiga
users.  The IRC channel amiga.ger is always there :-).  No wonder
that  ISDN-Master,  the  first  ISDN card for the Amiga is coming
from  Germany.   Of all the countries in Europe, Germany is where
the Amiga hardware is more cheap.

Finland,  the  home  of  AmiTCP,  the best TCP/IP package for the
Amiga, completely free.

Austria,   home   of   TrapDoor  development,  the  best  Fidonet
Frontdoor/Utilities for the Amiga.  Shareware.

Belgium,  country  of  Nico Francois.  His name's really Nico ???
:-)

Spain  is a NULL pointer these days.  I bought my first Amiga 500
there  though.  There is no Commodore representation in Spain for
a  few  years now.  I know that there are a few Amiga usergroups.
It's  really sad.  I remember seeing spectacular games from Spain
in the earlier days of Amiga.

Holland,  home  of  Amiga  E.   The  Netherlands  is surprisingly
smaller  than  Portugal.  People from there seem to like Portugal
very  much  (really  don't  know  why :-/).  Anyway, gives me the
chance to know what's going on over there every Summer :-).

Portugal,  we  have  a  few  good programmers.  A friend of mine,
actually,   a   neighbor,   made  a  file  recovery  program  and
successfully commercialized it in the UK.  It would be impossible
to  have such success in Portugal.  We have a lot of Amiga users.
C=  PO.   screwed  up  since the beginning.  PCs were giving them
more  money than Amigas so they advertised PCs and let the Amigas
sell by them selves.  Now there are no PCs and C= PO.  is a small
office near Lisbon whit one employe responsible too tell that the
administrator  (the  other staff member) is not at the moment and
you  can  leave  a  message.   I  know  that  C= Italy ran C= PO.
somehow.   I  wonder how C= Italy is going these days :-/.  There
are  a  few  dealers  here  in Portugal, they buy everything from
England  and  the  US.  I know at least 3 friends of mine wanting
A4000/040s  and  not  having  a  place to buy them.  CD-32 didn't
exist.   I  was  invited and went to the presentation show of the
CD-32  unit.   Very nice, I said to myself.  If they put CD-32 in
shopping  centers like Segas and Nintendos, they have a very good
chance  to get out of the hole they're into.  I still have the CD
that they offered me at the expo but I couldn't find a CD-32 unit
in my town to experiment it....

I  have  obviously  missed  many places from Europe.  This is the
overview  that  *I*  have  from  Europe.  If you feel offended or
forgotten,  be  happy to write your feelings and send them to AR.
They will be most welcome, I'm sure.

I'm  now  going  on  holidays.  When I get back, the Amiga rights
will probably be owned by some other company.  Is the Amiga going
to survive after so many time without any research ??  Is the AAA
dead  even  before  it's  born ??  I guess time will answer this.
Meanwhile,  I'm  very satisfied with my A4000.  If the Amiga dies
and  the A4000 fails, I still have my A3000.  If the A3000 fails,
I'll  have  my  A1200.   And  if the A1200 fails, I guess I'll be
without  any computer until the Amiga is reincarnated if the form
of  something  else  that  doesn't  have  a sticker saying "Intel
Inside" :-)

C ya all soon or never again,

%% Emulation Rambler                                  by @{" Jason Compton " link P8-2} %%
%% The A64 Package V3.0                            jcompton@bbs.xnet.com %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Things come full circle, I suppose.  About a year ago this time, I debuted
this column with a small review of three products.  One of them was The
A64 Package V2.0.  I won't bother repeating it here,  but I won't need to,
because A64 V3.0 is a very new and different product from its predecessor.

Background

Let's face it.  A lot of Amiga users, myself among them, are 64 converts,
who for whatever reason decided to stick with the Commodore brand name
when it came time for them to pick a more powerful computer.  I had told
myself that I'd still screw around on the 64 when I got the Amiga.  That 
didn't happen.  But I still had everything, including a software 
collection spanning 6 years of 64 use.  Shame to put all that to waste,
but inconvenient to have a separate computer system set up.  This is 
where emulators come in: space- conscious, and, if you're lucky, 
effective.

A64's premise

Questronix (well, Cliff Dugan, they seem to be one in the same) has put a
lot of work into making this thing run properly.  A64 is, just like a 
real 64, based around a BASIC and a Kernal ROM.  Because Commodore's ROMs
are copyrighted, though, and Dugan wanted the emulation available to 
everyone, he physically wrote his own ROMs for the A64.  (not a small 
task!)  However, for increased software compatibility, it is suggested 
that you pull the ROM images from a real 64 and have them on tap, just in
case.

A64 comes with a small beige box.  One end is a parallel connector, the
other is the 64's serial port.  To this, you can hook up any legal 64 
serial device (like a disk drive or printer) and use it in A64.  In 
addition, the 64 emulation can use the Amiga's serial and parallel 
ports, and can assign legal AmigaDOS paths as 64 floppies.

While A64 is running, the Amiga side is totally disabled.  However, the
emulation can be frozen, allowing access to the Amiga side, with the
keypress Alt-Alt.  (incidentally, the keyboard is emulated in a fairly
logical manner, unlike A64 1.0, which had users trying to reach the DEL
key for the Inst/Del key on the 64.  It resembled the 64 keyboard more
closely, but was horrible in practice.)  From here, quite a few things 
can be changed about the emulation: The way the screen and sprites are
displayed, how raster splits are being treated, and even a 64 monitor
mode can be entered.  There are also some very interesting options
here, the best being Save Map, but I'll get to that in a future issue.

Putting A64 to Work

So, when it's finally time to put A64 to work, let's say you've dug up a 
1541 floppy and have hooked it up.  There.  All set.  Now you have to 
find a piece of 64 software to put in it.  Once you start loading it, 
you can go over this checklist to make sure it will work (and believe 
me, you'll have time considering how long it takes the 1541 to load 
things)

1.  Does this program have a fastloader?
2.  Does this program have a copy protection scheme that's going to do
    nasty horrible things to my disk drive?
3.  Is this program a demo?

If the answer is yes to any of these questions, you can be fairly certain
that you're probably not going to get what you wanted.  Fastloaders tend
to kill A64, clunking copy protection often freezes up, and most demos
are coded with methods A64 isn't used to seeing.  (a friend of mine was
a demo/intro coder on the 64, and virtually everything he's written shows
up incorrectly)

Anything which is straightforward with no big graphical tricks runs just
fine: and in this there ARE games included.  However, one of the biggest, 
most often appearing graphical problems come with raster splits that
change character banks: if you know what I mean, great.  If you don't,
it means a trick that lets the 64 use two different sets of characters on
the same screen.  Usually, A64 only picks up on one or the other.
That means that part of the screen will look garbled, because what's
supposed to be there is data contained in another character set which
would have made it look pretty.

Navigating and getting stuff
-----------------------------

Of course, I spoke earlier about the A64 interface box, that allows you
to use 64 devices, and the ability to use AmigaDOS paths as disk drives.
You'll want to take advantage of the Amiga device capability, because
the speed difference is phenomenal (and you think 880k floppy drives
are slow...you'll BEG for them once you use a 1541 again for a time).
A program called 64Tools helps out here, allowing you to copy between
sides (WARNING: NON-MULTITASKING WHILE COPYING!) and doing various
manipulations to the files, particularly stripping the load address (two 
bytes at the start of 64 files).  The transfer is slow, but if the files 
are used often, the savings are well worth the trouble.  Using a modem 
to download files (a 64 term, of course) to the hard drive directly 
should be a treat as well.

Compatibility?
------------

I went over the basic rules earlier.  However, it is worth mentioning 
that A64 supports Isepic files with an included patch, and can support 
GEOS on 68000 machines ONLY.  I have not had a chance to test either, 
but will try to dig up a copy of GEOS to run on a friend's 500 soon.

Compatibility can really only be found on a case-by-case basis.  It is
my experience that any program, if it can load correctly, will run.  How
well it runs or how good it looks can be another story entirely, and 
depends a lot on how much the user plays with the graphics options.  
Using these options allows you to set screen refresh rates, sprite 
refresh rates, raster interpretations, color schemes, and more.  There 
are a LOT of possible settings, and finding the one just right for the 
game you've been wanting to play for 5 years may take a little time.

Next week, I'll talk about how to get more speed from the A64, and offer
a few more thoughts on the product.

Until then, keep the emulators warm.

Part 3:  Emplant and a conclusion

Well, I slapped the Emplant back into my machine (I had taken it out
because I suspected the Retina board was preventing it from 
configuring.  I touched on this problem in an earlier section.  NoahJi's
tech sometimes has an autoconfig problem with his Z-III as well, and
we both own 3000s.  We can't explain, though.)  and took it for a whirl.

I wish I'd done it sooner.

This is pretty.  Very, very pretty.

It comes at a cost, though.  The Retina, like all other 24-bit boards that
Emplant supports, can't show other 24-bit screens at the same time.
Jim Drew himself pointed this out.  Oh well.

Throwing the Emplant into 256 colors...
-----------------------------------

Hey, come on, I only own a 3000, I've been using the Emplant and A-Max IV
in 16 color modes for months now.  I've lived, it's been ok...but I've 
known the display refresh wasn't terrific.

With the Retina Z-III, it is now.

Jim Drew himself recommends the Z-III as the fastest board for Emplant
use.  I can't confirm this, since this is the first 24-bit board I've 
done work on, but I CAN say this.

It's fast.  The pointer zooms smoothly around the screen.  No more 
flashing. No more 3000 scan-doubled breakup.  Just zooms along like a 
Mac should.

For some reason, the Emplant always seems to start up in 256 Greys.
No matter, just switch it over to color...

Very, very nice.  I can't keep repeating it, so I'll just talk about how a 
few programs perform...

GIFConverter
-------------

Well, it views GIFs and converts others just fine, although I have run
into some memory problems.  (Incidentally, I get about an extra 512k
for the emulation now that it's going through the Retina's video).  The
colors are right, the display is snappy...it works, mate.

Spectre
-------
I figured it would work, since it works on the standard Emplant output.
Yep, it works here, too...VERY, VERY prettily and with great screen
updating.

Mac BZone
---------

This is a BattleZone clone...another 3D vector game.  Again, very
good performance, despite the fact that a requester...oh, excuse me,
DIALOG BOX ("request" sounds too unpleasant for the Mac crowd)
comes up and informs you that the game works much better in 2 or
16 color mode.  Looks fine in 256 to me...very nice, smooth graphics.

Rescue!
-------

A takeoff on Star Trek: The Next Generation, this game looks pretty
good in 16 colors anyway.  I was hoping, though, that with the Retina
it would REALLY impress me, especially because it would move so
much smoother.  Well, for some reason, it thinks that it's running on
a black and white Mac, and loads itself accordingly.  That's a shame,
and I can't figure out why it's happening.

That brings me to an important point: I have yet to find a way to shift
the display BELOW 256 colors.  You might wonder why I'd want to...
some Mac games demand it.  I can't help it.  There's apparently
no way to do it, though.

Setting up all this good stuff...
----------------------------

Making the Emplant and Retina Z-III get along isn't the easiest thing
in the world, though...you need to use the Retina screenmode select
programs to inform it of what sort of screen you'll need the Emplant
to open, otherwise Emplant won't be able to get going.  It's not
HARD, but it's a bit time-consuming.

Benchmarks!
-----------

Ah, yes, you knew they were coming, didn't you?  Courtesy of
Speedometer, here are the rules:

All tests are run 5 times on a 256 color screen with no Amiga background
programs running.

No Mac programs are running other than Speedometer.

Results are indexed to a Mac II at 1.0.

Retina Z-III Resolution                         Score
640x480                                         1.814
1024x768                                        1.794
1280x1024                                       1.766

Retina sundry...
----------------

In this section are things that I never had a chance to explore, either 
because of lack of time or experience.

The Retina Z-III can run applications designed for the Harlequin graphics
card. This should excite people who wanted the power of that hugely 
expensive piece of hardware.

AnCoS Jr. is included.  This acts as a sort of takeoff of ADPro's FRED and
allows 192x144, 16.7 million color resolution.  AnCoS 2.0, sold 
separately, is much more powerful, "replaces applications like the 
Personal Animation Recorder entirely", and both versions do not need the
Retina to work.

RACE, an animation creation system, allows for both lossless and lossy
animations.  It features functionality in any screenmode and depth, RAM
and HD spooling, and the multipic.library, letting you use several
different picture file formats (still no GIF support, though!)

I could have told you more, but they didn't send me the RACE manual.

In Conclusion...
----------------

The Retina Z-III 24-bit graphics card is, overall, great.  The Workbench/
Intuition emulation is surprisingly good and flexible, the picture viewing
is excellent, and it actually supports some sort of animation.  Its 
performance with the Emplant does both cards justice and rounds out the 
Mac side's operation.  Its included paint program is good-at least that,
for free.

It's not perfect, though.  At a price of $800 for the 4 meg version (used
in my tests), it's not for everyone...probably not for the user who will 
only use it for one specific purpose.  The lack of GIF support is a bit 
surprising, but surmountable using Viewtek or the like.

The manuals...well, hope for the best.

I guess the ultimate question is, "Will I be sad to see it go?"  Well, of
course.
I was having a blast with an $800 piece of equipment I didn't pay for.
Seriously, though, it has been a welcome addition to my 3000 and will
be missed.

SUBJECT:    Monthly Amniga Report Contest Puzzle and Rules
AUTHOR:     David Tiberio
EMAIL:      dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu
DATE:       6-7-94


    The solutions to the previous puzzle will be ready for the first
week of August. Basically we have only one correct submission, who
guessed 2 out of 14 possible answers correct. I was very displeased
by the number of submissions. I know the puzzle was hard, but it
wasn't THAT hard!

- THE PRIZE FOR NEXT MONTH -

CONTEST BEGINS: 7-29-94
CONTEST ENDS: 8-26-94

    The Amiga Report contest is still going on, and it is not too
late to enter. This ongoing monthly contest allows Amiga Report
readers a chance to win software by either solving a puzzle or by
entering a random drawing.

    The prize this month is the Amiga/Toaster Reference Manual v2.221,
from Area52. This is a 1,000 page help system for the Amiga and Video
Toaster, covering the Workbench, AmigaDOS, Lightwave, and more ($34.95).
    The second prize choice is the FutureShock audio CDROM,  which was
produced using Amiga computers by SideWinder. There are some Sidewinder
music modules on Aminet that you may want to look at for a sample of
the audio CD ($12.95).
    Another possible prize is SubVersion, a strategy submarine hunt
game by Point of View Computing. Both a Mac and IBM version is included
along with the Amiga version, and The Aminet CDROM by Walnut Creek
CDROM.
    Previously we have offered the ARexx Reference Disk by Merrill
Callaway, which was awarded to a previous winner. Contact Whitestone
for more information (505) 268-0678. More prizes will be announced
as they become available.

    All monthly contests end on the morning of the first of the
following month. Any entries beyond this date will be entered into the
next contest.


- THE MONTHLY DRAWING -

    To enter the random drawing, select a number from 1 to 262,144
and send it to me at one of my addresses listed below, either by
the postal service or email through the Internet.
    Also, you may enter by solving the following puzzle. The winner
of this puzzle will be decided within the same time frame as the
random prize, to allow the contest information to filter through the
networks, and to allow your letters and postcards to come in.


- THE PUZZLE -

    Since people complained that the first contest was too hard, and
that the second was too easy, I made one that anyone can solve with
a little thought. The third problem should have been obvious... the
first word was as big of a push in the right direction as you could
get. Now we will try a more mathematical problem, which is very easy
to solve. If you are not too familiar with matrix manipulations, just
look for the right resources and you will find all the help you need
(help is everywhere!). Of course, this is another one of those trick
problems.

        There are two matrices, A and B. Each matrix will have a
    value applied to it, and you must determine the answer. The
    value is specified by x, and the answers you must provide are
    Ax = ?, and Bx = ?.

                     x = (151647 - 61615)

                     [ 7 8 9 ]       [ 1 2 3 ]
                 A = [ 4 5 6 ]   B = [ 4 5 6 ]
                     [ 1 2 3 ]       [ 7 8 9 ]
                     [ 0 0 0 ]       [ 0 0 0 ]

        What does Ax equal, and what does Bx get you? Also provide
     your method of obtaining the answer. I understand that there
     may be cultural differences for this problem... not all math is
     the same (you should see how my mother does long division!). So
     just make a good guess ::heh heh::. With a little research, you
     can determine the answers. You may want to look for information
     on matrix multiplication.
         As a special bonus, the first person to successfully supply the
     correct answer will automatically win. If you feel that you
     definitely have the answer, get in touch with me with what you have
     learned. If you do everything correctly, I will answer to let
     you know :).


- TO ENTER -

    To enter, simply let your fingers do the talking and write an
email and send it to dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu. You MUST put
the word CONTEST in the subject line of the email header! Otherwise
you run the risk of having your email deleted (don't ask, it is a
long story!) or send a post card or letter to:

    Amiga Report Contest
    c/o David Tiberio
    6 Lodge Lane
    East Setauket, NY 11733

    Is it possible to win via snail mail? You might think that your
chances of winning are better by entering in email (much faster of
course), but last month's winner send in a letter that arrived the
day before his winning number was drawn!

    In your letter or email, please provide the following:

    Your full name and address. Please keep in mind that many of
you may have addresses that I am not accustomed to, so please include
your country or any other information that I would need in case you
win. An email address should also be included, if possible.

    You must also include a brief one sentence overview of the editorial
in this issue of AMiga Report. Just to make sure you are reading it. :)
You must also include the issue number. For example, if you read this in
AR213, then include that in your correspondance. Also, a prize winner
will be determined by a random number generator. Choose a number from
1 to 262,144. The closest winner or winners to the randomly generated
number will receive the prize in the mail. Anyone who does not provide
a number will have one assigned to him randomly.

    All prizes will be mailed within one week after I get my hands on
the published version of AmigaReport. I am doing this for a few reasons.
First, every winner so far has given the correct puzzle solution before
I have received the editon of AmigaReport that announced it. :)
Second, I don't like to go to the post office every day if I can avoid
it. Third, you never know when someone's power supply might blow up
(right Mr. Editor?!).


- RULES AND REGULATIONS -

1. In the evnt that the editor's power supply fries, the contest for
   that month will have its deadline postponed to a later date, to be
   announced. Any contest entries for the random drawing will be added
   to the next month's drawing, to be held once per month near the
   beginning of the month.

2. All prizes are donated. I cannot be held responsible for any damage
   caused by a prize. For example, if you leave your prize on the
   stairs and your grandmother slips on it, I will not pay her medical
   bills.

3. We are not doing this for any profit, and cannot be held responsible
   if we go out of business or are otherwise financially unable to give
   you anything! We are actively looking for submissions from other
   software authors.

4. Good things come to those who read the rules and regulations! Here
   is a tip to help you win: every problem is a trick problem, or gives
   you clues that are not part of the problem itself. Read the whole
   entire contest entry looking for clues. And read my other articles
   for more clues. I give some very obvious clues :).

5. If for any circumstance you are awarded a prize but do not receive
   it, contact me at (516) 476-1615. I will promptly attend to any
   mistakes that have been made.

6. These rules are subject to change at any time without warning!

7. Focus not on A, but instead on B!


- THE DISCLAIMER -

    DISCLAIMER: This contest is being provided as a service to the
    Amiga community and all persons involved in running this contest
    cannot be held liable for anything that costs you money or
    lifetime pain and anguish. Rules are subject to change. All entries
    must be received by whenever TBA. Any entries beyond this date
    will be entered into the next contest, if any.


- THE CHANCE YOU WILL WIN -

    Odds of winning are approximately 1:50 for the random drawing and
1:15 for the correct answer to the puzzle, based upon current entries.

    SPECIAL THANKS to SideWinder for donating the Future Shock albums
for inclusion in our contest, along with Merrill Callaway for his ARexx
Reference Disk!

%% The SX-1 CD32 expansion from Paravision          by @{" Jason Compton " link P8-2} %%
%%                                               jcompton@bbs.xnet.com %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

After what seemed like a lifetime of waiting (but was really just 2
months), my review SX-1 finally arrived.  Well, not before I got the hard
drive and memory, and not before I straightened out that it wasn't 
intended for Amiga Game Zone, but hey, I've got it and it works.

How well does it work?  First, let's open the packaging.

The Packaging
-------------

Nothing like simplicity.  A white, thin-walled cardboard box about the
footprint of a piece of notebook paper and about 2 or 3 inches tall.  On 
the box is a black label identifying the product, the included options, 
and displaying the Paravision/SX-1 logo.  (incidentally, the logo is 
fairly ugly, but that's not a big concern.)

Pull open the box, and what do you get?  The SX-1, and (if you're lucky)
a 15-page manual.  If you're NOT lucky, you get a 4-page manual.  Feed it
to the dog and call Paravision asking for the 15-page one, since the 
4-page is virtually useless.

The SX-1 itself is another rectangular box.  It's made of metal, the same
strange dark grey color as the CD32, with a white Paravision/SX-1 logo on
it.  That's all for decoration.  One side has the CD32 U-shaped connector
(more on that later) and around the other three sides are the ports that
make the SX-1 useful.

The Manual
----------

Ah, yes, very, very important.  Like I said, the 4 pager was horrible.  
The new 15-page version is quite a bit better and tells you just about 
everything you need to know.  It's smallish, about the size of most game
manuals and the like, and not intensely durable since it's made completely
out of regular paper stapled together.  But it's functional and tells you
what you need to know.

The Options
-----------

You paid for them, here they are, with my own comments about the way they
work.  Listed in the order they appear on the box, they are:

Serial Connector:  A 9-pin model, meaning that if you're a die-hard Amiga 
user, this is new to you.  It's not a problem, just get a cable or 
adapters (available at a Radio Shackish store) and attach them.  It works.
Located on the right side of the CD32.

Disable Switch:  Interesting that they listed this second.  This will 
disable everything except the RGB port, the memory expansion, and the
clock.  Personally I think this was a poor combination of things to leave
running, but more on that later.  Located on the back, near the middle.

Parallel Connector:  A standard Amiga parallel port.  What more needs to 
be said? Located on the back.

Video Connector:  The RGB port.  A great boon to CD32 users tired of the
inferior RF or composite outputs (not everyone has SVideo capabilities),
with 1084s and 1950s and 1960s and 1942s just dying to have CD32 games
pumped into them.
HOWEVER, those multisync monitors require the RGB/VGA adapter box.  This
wouldn't be a problem if the RGB port wasn't located on the left side, 
very close to where the CD32's power supply plugs in.  It takes a bit of 
bending to get the adapter box and power supply cable to exist together, 
and I would have rather that it didn't.  Aside from that, the video output
works just fine.  It claims to work with FMV, but as I don't have an FMV 
module I can't test it.

Floppy Connector:  Standard Amiga variety, works.  Configures the first
drive as DF0:.  Located on the right side, pretty logical because you can
then set the drive on top of the SX-1 and CD32.  (The back would have 
worked just as well, but there's only so much room...)

IDE Interfaces:  There is the 2.5 inch internal variety and a 3.5 inch 
external connector.  I have a 40 meg drive from Paravision sitting here,
but I haven't plugged it in because my power supply wouldn't accomodate 
it and a floppy. (More on that later)  

Hopefully, a new power supply from Micro R+D will arrive before I have to
send the hard drive back to Paravision.  The 3.5 inch external IDE is 
something I haven't encountered before.  Paravision says they've 
commissioned cables to be built.  More on that as I learn about it.  The 
external connector is located on the back of the SX-1.

AT-101 keyboard interface:  Lets you plug in standard IBM keyboards and
use them.  Located on the right side.  I haven't had a chance to test this
yet.

Audio Input:  A 6-pin mini-DIN input to allow mixing audio over the CD32's
output.  Haven't had a chance to test this either, but it's really only 
good for Karaoke enthusiasts...although I'm sure the analogy could be 
extended to presentations as well.  Located on the right, and physically
a part of the U-connector (again, more on that later)

Internal SIMM slot:  Lets you use a standard 32-bit SIMM, up to 8 megs 
(4 if you have a FMV module).  Works just fine, although I had some 
problems getting the SIMM properly seated and discovered Kickstart 3.x's
"Defective Expansion" screen.  The 4 meg SIMM from Paravision is now 
sitting there, resting nicely and providing me with a speedup for some 
games.  (More on the effects of Fast RAM in the next issue)

MPEG Passthrough:  A part of the U-Connector (which I'm ALMOST ready
to talk about!)

Real-time clock:  Hey, it's nice to have.  It works, using the standard
clock battery.

NOW, the U-Connector
--------------------

Commodore's FMV module was designed to rest physically INSIDE the CD32,
on the right of it, under the vent grates.  To that end, a U-connector is
used, so that the board still interfaces with the CD32 expansion slot.  
The same concept is used in Paravision's U-connector, so that the SX-1 
and the FMV module can share the same machine.  (This is where the audio 
in is located)

While I can't comment on its functionality with the FMV module, I can 
comment on its implementation physically.  It's bad.  The connector is not
firmly attached to either the SX-1 or the CD32, and wobbles considerably
when you're trying to install the SX-1.  In fact, every time I've needed 
to plug it in, I've had to angle my CD32 upwards and match up the 
connection that way.  I've also pulled out the SX-1 and left the 
U-connector behind (and I wasn't yanking on it, I slid it).  It's not 
more than a nuisance, but it makes handling the unit more difficult and 
more time consuming.

Taking a Look at the SX-1: Externally
-------------------------------------

It looks like whoever designed the SX-1's case (either the product 
designers or Robert Maynard, credited as "Package Design") tried very 
hard to make the SX-1 look like a logical extension of the CD32.  For 
those of you unfamiliar with the CD32's design, it's just over a foot 
wide on top.  Midway through, the case is split for the CD drive's lid,
located on the left.  The expansion connector is on the right, meaning 
that the CDSX combination, as I've chosen to call it, looks like a 
flipped-over L.  The color matches nearly perfectly, marred a bit by the 
fact that the CD32 is flat colored plastic while the SX-1 is metal and 
has a satin sheen to it.

The SX-1 looks like it was supposed to fit just right in the space 
extending back on the right side.  It's just a bit too wide, though, 
and some of the SX-1 hangs off of the right edge of the CD32, but it's 
only a couple of millimeters. On the left, it hangs over the split enough
so that the CD32's lid rubs it slightly.  Oops.

The Guts of the SX-1
--------------------

Inside, the SX-1 is a fairly crowded place.  Of major interest are the
2.5 inch IDE controller (located on the left, farther back than the RGB
port, which means they should have traded places) and the 5 jumpers 
located a bit to the right of them.  These are fairly important.  In 
order, here's what they do.

1.  Determines the size of the SIMM in the SX-1.  Should be on for a 2 or 
    8 meg SIMM, off for a 1 or 4.  (Controls banks for the memory)

2.  Determines the size (again) of the SIMM.  Should be on for a 4 or 8 
    meg SIMM, off for a 1 or 2.

3.  Memory control: Enable/disable.  On disables, off enables. 
    (Paradoxical, isn't it?)

4.  Power On Delay.  Adds 10 seconds to the boot time to allow clunky hard
drives time to spin up.  (It's worth noting that the SX-1 has a noticable
boot delay even when this option is NOT activated)  On delays, off boots
"normally".

5.  Right Alt control.  Apparently, Paravision feels that there are a lot
of AT keyboards without a right Alt button, so this option allows the 
right Control button to be used as right Alt.  (I've NEVER seen a keyboard
like that) On says you've already got 2, off says you need the right 
Control emulation.

Pinouts
-------

For the interested, Paravision lists the pinouts of the parallel, floppy,
external IDE, serial, RGB, AT Keyboard, and audio ports in the manual.

POWER!
------

Not just for the egomaniacs, it's a serious concern.  The CD32 has a weak
power supply.  This means that, according to Paravision, unless you get a
better supply, you should never combine the FMV module, floppy drive and
hard drive (in other words, pick one.)  However, Micro R+D is building 
power supplies to alleviate the problems.

Fun Facts
------------

I'm drawing this first part of the review to a close.  However, here are 
some fun facts to keep you interested until next time.

1.  Casualties of  Product Design:  The two people I talked to in May 
    about the SX-1 both no longer work for Paravision.  One was a 
    designer, the other was the president.  Another designer of the SX-1
    is also no longer employed by Paravision, meaning that Yan Sun is the
    sole remaining SX-1 designer in Paravision's employ.

2.  Joanne Dow, editor of Amiga Exchange and a frequenter of the Amiga
    Usenet newsgroups, did contract work on the SX-1 software.

3.  Despite Paravision's sometimes rabid response to being confused with
    Microbotics (their ex-president called me up one morning, demanding 
    names of Amazing Computing authors because of the fact that Paravision
    never informed AC of the ownership switch), Mike Pinson, a Paravision
    employee, Product Specialist and overall good guy who represents 
    Paravision on the nets still has the Internet account (listed in the 
    manual) of "microbotics1@bix.com".  :)

4.  Because I was shipped an SX-1 addressed to me but addressed to me
    as a rep of Amiga Game Zone, I had to convince everyone I wrote for 
    Amiga Report, not Amiga Game Zone.  About a week after it got cleared
    up, I was asked by AGZ's editor to do game reviews, and I accepted.  
    Ironic, isn't it?

5.  When the disable switch is set to disable the options, the Kick 3.x
    preboot menu won't come up with both mouse buttons held down.  Mike
    Pinson was surprised but couldn't explain.

That's it for this week.  Until next time, keep the CD32's warm.

DESCRIPTION

D.A.S Module Player is a player specifically designed for high end users.
Special attention has been given to efficient handling of modules
in lists. Modules can be sorted and handled with such attributes as
name(+reverse), date(+reverse), style and author. For better
handling modules can also be divided to two groups within every
list and can also be played according to those groups.
Adding modules to list is easy since DASMP can take care of modules 
already existing in list and modules newer than current list.
    
Modules can be extracted from virtually any external archives such
as LHA and ZIP. XPK and PowerPacker packed modules can also be used.
   
Since DASMP requires MUI, the Graphical User Interface of the player
is totally under user control. 
User control over other features of DASMP can be squeezed to three words:
6 configuration pages. Module specific configurations include things
like module duration, author, style and date, volume, preload and
fade speed.
    
In overall DASMP is very complex system giving user a possibility to
use features he needs and forget the rest.

What DASMP is not: 
DASMP is not small and is not ment to be a replacement for those cute 
little players floating around nets. DASMP is not ment to be used on
non accelerated a500 or a2000.

NEW FEATURES (Since 3.1)

14-bit Stereo Mixing routines for MTM/S3M/FT players. Lots of
enhanced features. Added SCANDIR option. Better dasFAST player with
Surround and Mono playing options for normal PT modules.
  
Works with MUI 2.1. Previous versions will not work with MUI 2.1.
Enhanced and more intelligent installer script.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS


KS 2.04, WB 2.1, Magic User Interface 2.0 (MUI).
MUI20USR.LHA and MUI21USR.LHA are available on aminet. Older than
2.0 versions of MUI aren't sufficient.

DESCRIPTION

JukeBox is a program to play compact digital audio discs by emulating
a graphical user interface similar to common CD players. It provides a
command line oriented, fully programmable ARexx user interface as well.
It will work on CD-ROM players plugged to a scsi-hostadapter or CDTV.

JukeBox will open its windows on the workbench (or any other public
screen) and do its best to allow a font sensitive layout. The main
goal during development was to create a very comprehensive, self-
explanatory utility.

   Features:

   Full Intuition interface
   ARexx port
   Fully programmable
   Keyboard shortcuts
   Supports any release of AmigaOS
   French, dutch, italian and german localization
   with Workbench 2.04/2.1/3.0
   Any screenmode or depth supported
   Windows on workbench or any public screen
   Tested with Enforcer and MungWall
      
   Common CD player functionality
   Catalogization, label and title recognition of your own discs.
   Shuttle-wheel for pickup positioning
   Play/Pause, Fast Forward/Backward, Shuffle Play, Repeat Mode,
   Skip Track Forward/Backward, A-B cuts
 
REQUIREMENTS
 
AmigaOS 1.2, 1.3, 2.04, 3.0, 3.1 or later. The use of release 2.x
or 3.x system software is strongly recommended. arp.library
recommended for use with any OS release former to 2.04. This
library is not included.
 
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
 
SCSI host adaptor and a CDROM player device. Currently supported are NEC,
TOSHIBA, MATSUSHITA, TEXEL/PLEXTOR, CHINON, TEAC, SONY, Apple, Commodore
CDTV and A570, Mitsumi drives with Alpha Data Tandem CD+IDE. A generic
'ANSI' player module supports other drives as well if they conform to
the ANSI SCSI-2 specs.

DESCRIPTION

     DFA is the ultimate address tool for you and the Amiga
     computer. DFA supports email addresses, dialing of phone
     numbers, grouping of addresses, different types of printing
     addresses, online help, application icon/window and much more!

     DFA has an Arexx port, font sensitive windows and can be fully
     directed by keyboard. Native languages are supported as soon
     as Workbench 2.1 (and above) is installed.

     Nearly every aspect of DFA is customizable now, so you may
     configure "your own" DFA.

     This is version 2.1, a minor upgrade to version 2.0.

     DFA is an SASG product! Shareware, binary only.


NEW FEATURES

     DFA is an SASG product now. According to this fact you may
     enjoy all advantages that come along with the SASG. For
     detailed information, please see the registration/information
     programm that comes along with this distribution.

     The quite ugly, seperate toolbox is gone. Instead of this
     you'll find a beautiful gadget panel inside the DFAEditor main
     window.

     New "secret" mode for the status texts of the DFAEditor.

     French locale support

     Several bugfixes, especially the "bug" that caused DFA to
     crash on some systems (68000/Kickstart 37.xxx) is removed. By
     the way this problem was caused by a bug in the
     gadtools.library!


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     DFA needs at least Kickstart/Workbench 2.04 to run.

     It takes advantage of the new features included in version 2.1
     (Locale  support)  and  uses even some features coming with OS
     3.0 if available.

     DFA is made to run on all all systems, starting with the A500+
     and ending up with the A4000(T).

     More than 512KB of RAM and a harddisk are recommended.

     See documentation for additional information.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     DFA is NOT PD.  It is shareware.  The author keeps the
     copyright over the whole package.

     The public version of DFA (without the keyfile!) is freely
     (re)distributable, but noone is allowed to sell the program
     for more money than to cover just the costs of copying.

     In any case noone may charge more than Fred Fish claims
     for one of his "Library Disks"!

DESCRIPTION

        Deft II is a new version (completely re-programmed as I haven't

        Briefly, Deft II is an utility to modify the default tools of
        your icons : you give to it a set of paths, a set of old/new
        default tool couples, and Deft II will recursively scan all
        these paths to change the default tools of your project icons
        according to your preferences.

FEATURES

        * a MUI GUI with all the consequent convenience for the user
        (keyboard shortcuts, appwindows, etc)
        * multi-paths handling for scanning
        * multi-default tools for replacing
        * wildcard using for the default tools to replace
        * preferences saving
        * ARexx port support
        * online help
    
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        * OS release 2.04 or newer
        * MUI v2.1 properly installed

HOST NAME

                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

  Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

  The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software, online.

  Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

  Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES.

  35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

  No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

  Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

  Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

  Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

  FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
  Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  

  Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

  The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
  Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
  All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

  Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

  And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

  UNIX "telnet" program from an account you may already
  have on an Internet-connected system. 
% 9600 bps Sprintnet in over 300 cities areas
+ $10 rate prevails at smaller US Cities
# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

the Commodore Amiga line of the personal computers.)

Every user has an access to download filelist (LAHOFIL.ZIP), list of the
Finnish 24-hour BBS's (BBSLIST.ZIP or BBSLIST.LHA) and every issue of
the Amiga Report Magazine (AR101.LHA-AR???.LHA) even on their first call.

The system has been running since 1989 and is sponsored by the local
telephone company, Vaasan Lnin Puhelin Oy.

BTW, LAHO stands for "LAtomeren Hyrylaiva Oy" = "Barnsea Steamship Co."
