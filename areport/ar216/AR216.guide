We're BACK!!!

Along with the "liquidation" of C=, my computer decided it was time to
blow a few chips, capacitors, and what-not. First I found out that my
power supply went out. Big pain, so I sent off for a new one as soon as I
could. It arrives, and the power leads that plug into the harddrives were
messed up....they don't power the harddrives. So I get out this old
external HD box that I had and connect the two harddrives to it, grap an
old ribbon cable, attach the HDs to it, and then I find out that the
hardrive that I used to boot the computer is not working as well. Ieeeah!!
That means that I don't have all the utilities that I used to have, no
AmigaGuide, no editor, no mountlists to boot up the other partitions on
the second harddrive, no mailing list file so that I could inform everyone
on what was happening to me. 

I don't have to mention that at this point, my hair was falling out of my
head with no help from my white knuckled hands.

Somehow since my computer is on all the time, it found out that C= was
having problems, and my computer in despair, called it quits. Either that,
or the lightening storm we had earlier did the trick. I dunno.

Well, these last few weeks, I've been pulling out every trick from the hat
to get things back in order. Well, in order enough to at least produce
Amiga Report. Then I have over 700k of messages, C= info, articles, and
what-not to sort through, read, ponder, etc. and place all the pieces into
a somewhat orderly fashion to get AR out.

Funny what a few problems can do to you. :)

Well, as you all know C= decided to liquidate. What does that mean?
Simply put it means that C= as we have known it will no longer exist.

What does that mean??

I'm not entirely sure. C= isn't completely disolved. The distributers have
plenty of stock to keep the sale of Amigas going for some time yet. What's
more is that there is ALOT of talk about some big Asian company wanting to
buy enough of C= to continue to produce the Amiga line of computers. This
company (as best as I can gather) seems to be the company called SAMSUNG.

I really don't know what that will mean >>if<< they actually do take over
the production of the Amiga, but even if this doesn't happen, the Amiga
isn't dead. It will be quite a while for that to happen. Even if nothing
ever happens to the Amiga again as far as production and such, there is
quite a large user-base out there...one that can't be pushed aside or
ignored. I have a feeling that we will be around for quite a while.

Hang in there...news is developing, and we'll keep you informed on what we
find out.


In the meantime, I'm glad to be back, and I'm glad to have you all back
with me. During these last few weeks, I have had TONS of mail from around
the world --- from all of you, giving me support. 

Also, please be advised that I'm a little bit behind in updating
the mailing list, dealer's list, and such. I should be caught up
by next week.

And until then, enjoy!

No Official Amiga Report Distribution Site in your local calling area? Are
you tired of waiting for your local BBS or online service to get Amiga
Report each week?  If so, have we got a deal for you!

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report
in UUENCODED form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put
on the list, send Email to rniles@hebron.connected.com.  Your
account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact copy.
For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.

Many thanks to PORTAL Communications for setting this service up for us!

P.S.:  Please be sure to include your Email address in the text of your
request message, it makes adding it to the list much easier.  Thanks!

** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!

                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AMIGA REPORT - MAY 12 1994

Friday April 29, 1994, at 4:10 PM, Commodore announced that:

"C= International Limited announced today that its Board of Directors
has authorized the transfer of its assets to trustees for the benefit
of its creditors and has placed its major subsidiary, C= Electronics
Limited, into voluntary liqudation. This is the initial phase off an
orderly liquidation of both companies, which are incorparated in the
Bahamas, by the Bahamas Supreme Court"

April 22, 1994 15 people where dismissed from West Chester, and the
Commodore Semiconductor Group was closed. On the 26th of April
engineering closed. Only a skeletal staff of about 22 remains.
3 people at the UK operation. 2 in Germany, 3 in the Phillipines.

New York Stock Exchange has de-listed Commodore Int (CBU)

CEI will contine to distribute Amigas to dealers, and should be able
to meet demand, and continue full service and support. Distributers
in other regions have reported sufficient stock to continue shipping
to dealers.

Rumors reamin! One being that Commodore will simply be selling off
technology to creditors, the second being that there is a possibility
that an Asian company will buy the technology from Commodore and
continue production and developement of the Amiga line. No official
announcement by Commodore has been made.

AmigaWorld --The Leading Amiga Publication--

Reinforces Position of Strong Support in Market

Peterborough, NH (May 3, 1994)  AmigaWorld, the independent, monthly
consumer publication for users of Amiga personal computers, has announced
today that recent events at Commodore Business Machines in no way affect
AmigaWorld's commitment to the market.

Responding to news on Friday, April 29, that Commodore was going out of
business, AmigaWorld Editor-in-Chief Daniel Sullivan stated, "Regardless 
of any change in the status of Commodore's operations, AmigaWorld will
continue to provide coverage of the Amiga market for its readership.  We
believe there are sound reasons to remain in the Amiga market -- namely, 
an installed base of five million Amiga computers worldwide; a dedicated
AmigaWorld readership of loyal, enthusiastic users; and an innovative,
proactive group of third-party developers."

Sullivan added, "We also feel certain that the technology will survive the
liquidation of Commodore through licensing agreements with interested 
third parties -- of which there appear to be many. This is an excellent
opportunity for the Amiga community to take charge of its own destiny and
set a direction for further development that Commodore has not been able 
to provide."

The AmigaWorld staff views this situation as an opportunity to provide an
even greater level of service to its readers and advertisers. With
Commodore's departure from the market, customer service will become an 
even greater priority at AmigaWorld.  The staff will continue to support
everyone involved in the market through such means as phone support and
on-line feedback. By providing strong customer service and up-to-date
market coverage for readers, AmigaWorld hopes to be the catalyst for 
future growth and development in the Amiga community.

AmigaWorld Magazine is published by TechMedia Publishing, Inc., an
International Data Group company. IDG is the world's foremost publisher of
computer-related information and the leading global provider of 
information services on information technology, with over 194 computer 
publications in 62 countries.

WhiteStone presents the ARexx CookBook and the ARexx reference disk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-The ARexx Cookbook by Merrill Callaway

A Tutorial Guide to the ARexx Language on the Commodore Amiga
Personal Computer

* TUTORIAL APPROACH -- Not another reference manual, The ARexx Cookbook 
is a step by step app- roach to learning ARexx, in graduated lessons 
from simple stand alone programs to complex interprocess control 
programs. Along with presenting good programming techniques, a thorough 
treatment of parsing, string handling and arrays insures that the readers
will have the equipment to write any ARexx programs they need.   This 
book makes ARexx easy!  Anyone can learn ARexx!

* USEFUL PROJECTS -- Real programs that do useful tasks make up all the
examples. You will keep the programs you learn on!  Beginners,
intermediates, and advanced users of ARexx will find useful programs as
well as inspiration and ideas here. There are programs to sort your data,
pick out a list of words without duplicates, turn your text editor into a
full blown word processor with Thesaurus and Grammar checker, scale IFF
images to fit your screen, search large text files, and more. Along the
way, you'll learn many powerful programming techniques so that you can
write any program you need for your own custom environment.

* AREXX AND POSTSCRIPT -- There are no other books dealing with ARexx
controlling PostScript, but this extremely powerful combination is
presented clearly by The ARexx Cookbook.  The projects include a slick
utility to print envelopes right from the Shell or CLI.

* MULTIPLE REFERENCE INDEX -- Page numbers for the Hawes and the Commodore
ARexx Manu- als, as well as for the manuals of the application software
mentioned in the text occur both in the index and in the margins of the
text.   Every ARexx instruction and function and every application program
command is referenced thoroughly.

* COMPANION DISKS -- All programs in the book, as well as many more are
available on two disks:    The regular Companion Disk; and a new disk just
for Desk Top Publishers for creating Indices and Tables of Contents using
TurboText and any DTP package that will export ASCII text.

* PURPOSE -- "The purpose of The ARexx Cookbook is twofold:  To bring less
experienced Amiga users quick- ly up to speed in ARexx; and to provide 
some really useful ARexx programs that can be easily adapted or used as is
for real world applications.  This book provides some interesting, useful,
and fun things to do with ARexx that make learning it fast and painless.  
ARexx truly is wonderful, and with a minimum of study, is easy to use.  
Everyone who uses an Amiga computer deserves to become proficient at 
ARexx, because it opens the real power of the Amiga multi-tasking system.
I wrote this book because I went through some of the same frustrations 
you may be experiencing trying to start to use ARexx.  Wading through a 
language reference manual is not the fun way to learn ARexx, but I 
persevered because I sensed it would be worth it. Much sooner than it 
looked like at first, I reached a level of competence that now allows me 
to customize my Amiga operating environment in ways I only dreamed of 
before.  The ARexx Cookbook was written to help some of you get over 
your initial fear of programming and to accelerate your climb up the 
first hump of the learning curve, and to lead you to the level where you 
can begin to use the full power of your Amiga.  For others, at a more 
intermediate stage, the book is an immediate source of useful code (and
inspiration) that you can use to make your own programs in ARexx to 
customize your Amiga applications." (from the Preface)

* ABOUT THE AUTHOR -- Merrill Callaway is the author of the monthly ARexx
Column in Amazing  Computing magazine.  He holds degrees in Applied
Mathematics and Fine Art from Brown University.  A former aerospace
Logistics Engineer with extensive technical writing and programming
experience, he has devoted his full time to the Amiga since 1990.   He
lives in Albuquerque,  New Mexico.

* WHAT THE CRITICS SAY -- "...Callaway goes to great lengths in his
explanations to help you  truly  un- derstand ARexx.  [He] has done a
wonderful job at making it as easy as possible."  Douglas J. Nakakihara in
MicroTimes 3/8/93 (Silicon Valley's leading industry newspaper.)  Deemed
"Best Buy" by Amiga Shopper, the U.K.'s premier Amiga magazine.

Message from Great Valley Products
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Although Commodore International has filed for voluntary liquidation 
and production of new Amiga's has essentially stopped, that does not 
mean the entire installed base will disappear overnight.
     
GVP will continue to support the Amiga market, it's products, and even 
one or two new releases.  It is natural to expect a decline in the 
third-party Amiga market, but it would be foolish to ignore the 
potential market that exists in the installed base.
     
It's been a rough road, and it will get rougher, but it's not time to 
jump ship just yet...

Intangible Assets Manufacturing Continues Strong Support of Amiga Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Drexel Hill, PA (4 May, 1994)  Intangible Assets Manufacturing, a software
development and consulting company in the Amiga marketplace, announces
that Commodore Electronics Ltd.'s voluntary liquidation in no way affects
IAM's commitment to the Amiga.
 
IAM's president, Dale L. Larson, stated, "The Amiga is important.
Commodore is irrelevant."
 
Larson elaborated, "Even if Commodore disappears and no one else picks up
production of the Amiga, there is a large existing base of machines which
will remain valuable for many years.  We intend to help current Amiga
users to get the most from those systems. Further, we believe that
licensing agreements or other arrangements will likely allow production of
new machines by someone."
 
IAM's currently available products include Amiga Envoy -- an Amiga
peer-to-peer networking package.  IAM expects to make an announcement of a
new Amiga book soon, and has other major projects in the works for the
coming year.

More Low Cost Emulation Fun with the Bridgeboard Adding a VGA Card!

For those of you who read my article on the great $19.75 used
A2088 Bridgeboard, this article is a bit of a followup.  
I hope you all enjoy it.  

Test Platform: 

Commodore Amiga 2000HD
A2300 NTSC Genlock
A2090A HD Controller
SupraRAM 2000/2
A2088XT Bridgeboard
Tecmar XT Expansion 
44MB Rodime HD /21 MB Miniscribe HD

A Bad Day... 

I was having a bad day.  Not just any old bad day, but some
lowlife went and snipped all the DRAM off of the used accelerator I wanted
to buy.  That classified as a Big Day for This Amiga User.  It was to my 
surprise that my good friend and PC fan, Tim, showed up with a a small box
that said "Add On Cards" with a garish multicoloured rainbow pattern on 
the outside.  Inside was a VGA card, a leftover from his 486, now decked 
out with SVGA and million-colour palette. 

The card was an Oak Technologies 256K VGA card, which according to
Tim, will show 640x400x256 colours.  My bad day was starting to turn good. 

The Game Plan
The game plan was to install the VGA card into my Amiga's "secondary bus 
system" or the PC slots left of the Bridgecard.  Then, I'd get full VGA 
capabilities on my XT side, allowing me to show all those great pictures 
of Anna Clarke someone sent me. 

What's wrong with the Amiga side?  For you folks who read my previous 
article in AmigaReport, I have an A2000.  No AGA, no 24 bit board, just 
good old ECS.  And the nice 256 colour GIFs turn out kind of bland and 
dithered converted out to HAM or NTSC:HiResLaced.  Plus, I was getting 
sick of a little hesitation caused by the translation of PC CGA emulation
to Amiga side graphics.  Screwdriver and VGA card in hand, I was ready to
begin.  

The User's Manual

I think I once told someone I hated Commodore's Amiga manuals.  Well, I 
hate PC clone manuals more.  Let me quote to you a typical page of this 
VGA card's 30 page instruction book: 

	"While you want to get into ET (Chinese Program), please
	 insert utility diskette into drive A... 

	 ...if screen dimension didn't adjust well please type... 

	 ...Drive Diskette Can Support: The Windows 3.0" 

I must admit the rest of the manual is in better English, but this
reinforces the inferiority-stereotype of PC clone quality.

Installation

The usual five screws came out of the 2000's case, and I removed one of 
those little metal plates.  (What use are they once they leave the Amiga?)
Next the VGA card was taken from it's antistatic protection bag and 
inserted into the second slot from the left, an 8 bit.  (The Oak card 
supported 16 bit, however, I have only an XT bridgeboard which uses only 
8 bit slots) From the back panel, I selected my monitor, PS/2 type and 
replaced all the screws. 

The monitor I used was a Scott SVGA Monitor, 14" with a nice tilt and 
swivel base, and I connected it to the DB15HD port on the back.  
Additionally, the card will also support a Digital type 9 pin connection
for 16 colour operation with digital EGA and CGA type monitors. 

Everything booted fine, and shortly after, the OAK VGA BIOS message came 
up, followed by the usual Commodore Bridgeboard BIOS notices. Wow! No 
keyboard action.  Up went the usual Janus PCWindow and I could type again.
It felt exactly like a clone.  Cool crisp VGA screen. Flickering 
underscore PC cursor.  Lack of windows.  

Great, what's it useful for? 

The main advantage for most Bridgeboard users will be the functionality of
having VGA level graphics on the PC side.  Most PC programs now demand 
either VGA graphics or Windows, which needs VGA as a base graphic adapter.
For my system, it is less useful because of my 8088 XT processor, but most
will find it will allow many more applications, operating systems 
(like OS/2) and games to run on the Bridgeboard. 

CSHOW-I can now show all those pictures under CSHOW.  Full 256 colours!  
Even if I can't get 640x400x256, I can still get 320x200x256 and 
368x400x256, plus a half decent 640x400 emulation.  I can even use the 
second monitor to show pictures while I'm working on my primary 1084S 
display.  

Windows NT-Oh yes, Windows NT is running very nicely.  Yup.  Just great, 
in fact, I think I saw a login prompt yesterday. :) 

FRACTINT-Yes, it's slow, but my 4.77 MHz XT Bridgeboard can run FRACTINT, 
one of the best fractal processors availible.  (The Waite Group's Fractal
Creations book is an excellent value, along with a copy of FRACTINT) And
since the PC side uses no Amiga processing time (especially now that it 
has it's own monitor) I can leave the fractals chugging along at a merry 
pace, serving as a wallpaper.  Of course this took an expensive SVGA 
monitor to get...  

FrameWork III-My copy of Ashton Tate's wonderful FrameWork III can now 
run in 80x50 lines.  Perfect for typing great amounts of text in and 
reading large manual files.

Conclusion

Take any VGA card you get! It's a useful and handy tool to add to your 
Bridgeboard, no matter what model-XT, AT, 386.  They've become very cheap 
lately, and you'll add yet more functionality to what I believe is the 
most interesting peripheral availible on the Amiga 2000-the Bridgeboard.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% The BBC Networking Club                                             %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

*What is the BBC Networking Club?*

The BBCNC exists to promote the Internet (a world-wide communications
system using computers and phone lines), to schools, colleges and any
who have not used the Internet before.

It also exists to allow the BBC to explore the Internet as a
broadcasting medium. That does not mean we will be supplying video
programmes on demand! It does mean we are hoping to offer useful
information resources for the Internet and encourage the BBC to be
directly accountable to Internet users for its output and policies.

Why doesn't the BBC have information about all programmes on the
Internet? Why don't you have Ceefax on the Internet?

The BBC is a very large organisation and currently it is committed to
making TV and Radio programmes. We hope that as knowledge and use of
the Internet increases within the Corporation, lots more useful and fun
material will become available. The BBCNC will do its best to bring
this material to you. But it will take time and lots of hard work.

*What is the BBC charging for Internet access?*

>From the 11th May, if you want to use our service to connect to the
Internet within the UK, then you will first need to buy a starter kit
and after that pay a subscription fee. The starter kits come in three
'flavours'. For PC's and their clones, it will cost UKP 25.00, for
Acorn Archimedes computers, it will cost UKP 35.00. Thereafter it will
cost UKP 12.00 per month, payable quarterly by direct debit, cheque or
credit card.

*What about Amiga users?*

We have gone for Mac and PC software first of all because these seem to
be the most widely used hardware platforms. Acorn Archimedes machines
are widely used in schools and colleges within the UK, and these are a
major focus for our activities. We will start to put together Amiga
software as soon as time and money allows . . . and we will let you
know by the end of May when that should be.


*How will it work?*

You will need a computer and a modem. A modem enables your computer to
communicate to other computers using the telephone system. Once you
have installed the starter kit software on your computer -- and you
will be able to call our telephone help line if you are having problems
-- you will need to open a registered letter from us with your special
password. With the password, and your system set up properly,  you can
connect to our bulletin board, called Auntie. 

>From Auntie you can download further software to your computer which
will enable you to explore the Internet as a whole. This software will
include the so called "TCP/IP" software necessary to use the Internet
as a whole.

There are places called Points of Presence (PoPs) around the country
into which a Club member will be dialing. These are distributed so that
wherever possible you will be making a local telephone call. The Points
of Presence will be found first of all in Cambridge, London, Bristol,
Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh. Initially, only about 35% of the
population will be within a local call charge, but as more people join
the Club we will be extending the number and range of PoPs accordingly.
Bringing a PoP on-line in Belfast is a priority.

We aim to keep the ratio of Club members to dial-in modems better than
30:1.

*Why this two stage process?*

Because software to use the Internet can be quite difficult to set up.
We are trying to help people get a feel for using their modem and our
software before they are more adventurous. You will be able to use
Auntie as a place to ask other people how to do things. 

*What else will be on the bulletin board Auntie?*

A bulletin board is an electronic space within a computer where you
read and leave messages with others, as well as browse information.
Auntie will become a place to talk to other people. We will be bringing
all sorts, from politicians to poets, the famous to the infamous, onto
Auntie to let you communicate with them directly.

*Is Auntie going to be free to those  already on the Internet?*

She will be until the middle of May, but after that Internet users will
be asked to pay UKP5.00 per month. We hope to set up some scheme
whereby groups of people within an organisation can pay a block fee.
However, we will still be presenting almost all material for free
access to the Internet as a whole. So if you use the Internet and
decide not to join Auntie, you will only miss out on the conferencing.

*Is the BBC trying to take over the Internet?*

Not even the BBC is big enough to do that! The Internet belongs to
no-one, and it can be very anarchic. We might be helping you to connect
to it, but once you're out there crusing through the world's computers,
whatever you find is up to you. The BBC takes no responsibility for it.

The Internet is also the fastest growing means of communication in the
world. Internet use is becoming the mark of a developed and prosperous
society and the BBC feels that people in Britain should be able to
learn more about it. We would also like to use our world-wide name to
work with those countries abroad, especially in Africa, where Internet
access does not really exist.

*Why, when I pay my license fee, should I have to pay more money for
Internet access?*

It would be great if the license fee did cover Internet access for all,
but it doesn't. It is set down in the BBC charter that the BBC can
innovate and educate, and that is what we are trying to do. BBC
Education is responsible for setting up this venture, and once the
running costs of the BBCNC have been paid, all the extra moneys we get
will go towards paying back our start up costs. These are about
UKP78,000. Once these moneys are paid back, we should be bringing down
our charges. The quicker people join the Club, the quicker we will be
able to lower the fees. We hope!

*Who do I contact if I want a subscription?*

You can fax 081-993-6281, or send a letter to BBC Networking Club, PO
Box 7, Broadcasting Support Services, London W3 6XY. You cannot, yet,
contact the organisation we are using to handle subscriptions
(Broadcasting Support Services) through e-mail, but you will be able to
before too long. Please note that if you try and send them letters
beforehand, you will not be answered until the beginning of May. We
will not be taking money from the public until we are completely
certain that our software works to our satisfaction.

*Who do I contact if I just want to find out more about the Internet,
modems and networking in general?*

You can send for a fact sheet, which includes details of other Internet
access providers, and what to look for in a modem, by writing to BBC
Networking Club, BBC Education, White City, 201 Wood Lane, London W12
7GS.

During office hours you can call this office for general -- not
technical - enquiries. The phone number is 081-576-7799.

PRODUCT NAME
   SKIDMARKS

BRIEF DESCRIPTION
This is a one or two game where you race around different
off road tracks. Kind of like super off-road.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION
   Acid Software.

LIST PRICE
   around 33 U.S dollars

SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
   HARDWARE
      Should work on all Amiga's, the more memory the better.

   SOFTWARE
      None.

COPY PROTECTION
On disk copy protection for the 2 track disks and AGA
car disk. None for the program disk.



MACHINE USED FOR TESTING
   Amiga 1200 with 2megs of Chip Ram

INSTALLATION
This game can be played straight from floppies, or you can
install the game disk on your hard drive. For better or worse
the 2 track disks it comes with cannot be installed. Oh well.

REVIEW
Why is the game called SkidMarks? Well, let me tell you. As
you race around the track all the cars and tracks leave, you
guessed it Skid marks! It's fun taking a nice clean track and
totally destroying it! If you race the same track again, the
skid marks stay. After your fun one that track, time to mess up
the next one!
   
This is a fun one or two player off road driving game. The
2nd player can use the 2nd joystick or a null modem or the
modem. The game even comes with it's own phonebook!

First thing you do is choose your car type and color, and
the computers car type and color if you which. I could only
choose 2 different car types due to memory restraints which is
no big deal.

You then choose the difficulty level. Higher difficulty
equals faster cars, which equals more work on control.

Then you choose the type of race. Practice, in which you
choose  any track a race by yourself. Match race, this one you
race against the 3 computer controlled cars.
The final race option, you race all the tracks and the vehicle
with the best time wins.

The car control is quite easy to understand. Push forward on
your joystick or the fire button to accelerate, left and right
to steer, and backward to go backward, and brake.

The cars are very well animated. Raytraced using 800 frames
for each car! The track scrolling is very smooth. The track
graphics are large and well done.

The game comes with 2 track disk, each disk having 6 tracks
to race on, they very from dirt, pavement, and snow.


DOCUMENTATION

I would have liked better docs, explaining the difference
between the vehicles.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

All in all this is a very well done game, I like the
graphics and sound, and the different sounds the tire makes on
the different tracks. And of course, the cool skidmarks.

What I didn't like was the rather sparse manual, but thats
no big thing.

COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

This game is similar to Super Off-Road. but much better.



BUGS

For all of us in the U.S. boot in pal


VENDOR SUPPORT

I've had no reason to contact Acid Software.
 
CONCLUSIONS

This is a nice game to add to your collection. I recommend 
buying it. I think the user interface could use a bit more
polishing as well. The manual mentions the possibility
of a full blown AGA version. For those of us that own an
AGA machine, to wait for an uncertain release, or buy it now
and get the AGA version if and when it comes out.
Decisions, decisions.

Hopefully to all readers of Amiga Report.

Annoyed when you walk into a Chainstore that has all the computers on 
display with Mario bouncing around the Nintendo, Sonic rolling about 
the Seag, spinning-things on the PC and the A1200 just sitting there 
asking for a disk ? Do the shop a favour and pop a little disk into 
the drive containing the AGA Point Of Sale demo.

Amiga Animation at Disney 
By Douglas J. Nakakihara 
 
	Disney has always been known for top quality animation.  Nearly 
everyone has been touched in one way or another by a Disney creation and 
we are all familiar with their cast of classic characters.  To some of 
us, they are almost friends.  It only seems fitting that the Amiga, a 
powerful animation tool, would find a niche at Disney, specifically at 
the Television Animation arm of Walt Disney Pictures and Television. 
 
	In an environment where artists have painstakingly created 
animation masterpieces by hand, the Amiga is revolutionizing the 
process.  The man behind this revolution is Kelly Day.  He has managed 
to convinced the powers that be that the Amiga is a viable and usable 
tool for doing what has traditionally been--and still pretty much is--a 
totally manual process. 
 
	Kelly has been with Disney for about four years.  Although, his 
name may not be familiar to you, his work might.  His credits include 
such movies as the Rescuers and Duck Tales, as well as the made-for-TV 
cartoons Talespin, Dark Wing Duck, and Goof Troop.   He is currently 
working on a new animated cartoon series called Bonkers. 
 
	Kelly's computer set-up consists of an Amiga 3000 with a 1950 
multiscan monitor and an Amiga 2500 with a 1084 monitor.  Both computers 
are equipped with Syquest removable media disk drives, IVS's Trumpcard 
SCSI controller cards, and Ethernet cards.  The Amigas are connected to 
a Novell local area network using the netware product from OXXI, Inc.  
Additionally, the two Amigas are networked directly together via the 
SCSI controllers using the SCSI-SHARE product from IVS.  This allows 
direct file sharing between the two computers.  Talk about connectivity! 
 
TRADITIONAL ANIMATION 
 
	To really appreciate the benefits the Amiga provides, it is 
important to understand how animations are created traditionally.  
Before an animation can be made, a storyboard must be created.  A 
storyboard is a series of black-and-white hand-drawn pictures, called 
"panels," depicting important moments (also known as key frames) in the 
animation.  The full dialog and other direction notes are written under 
each panel. 
 
	Animations are created assembly-line style and there are basically 
three types of people who work on the project at this point: character, 
prop, and background designers.  The character designers are in charge 
of anything that is living, and the prop designers cover non-living 
objects that move.  The background designers draw the static elements in 
a scene.  For example, say the animation was to be about a man picking 
up a stick in a room.  The background designer would draw the room, the 
character designer would draw the man, and the prop designer would draw 
the stick.  Get the picture?  Of course, some lines may be crossed if 
you have a talking broom or chair! 
 
	The Disney designers study the storyboard and then draw black and 
white line art pictures called "models."  For instance, if one of the 
main features of the animation was a car character, a designer would 
draw the car from various perspectives.  This gives the actual animators 
a three-dimensional idea of what the car looks like.  There is one other 
designer called the color designer, who creates colored models of the 
characters, props, and backgrounds. 
 
	What is interesting is that the Disney designers don't draw the 
final animation, they only provide the "look" of the cartoon.  That's 
right, the work the public actually sees is not technically the actual 
work of Disney designers.  Because a 20-minute cartoon requires nearly 
29,000 frames to be drawn and painted, this work is usually farmed out 
to animation studios located in other countries where labor is cheaper.  
Normally, an army of animators is used to make the final product.  These 
studios are sometimes independent and not related to Disney. 
 
	When the animation is actually being created, the animators base 
it on the key frames in the storyboard.  In other words, they are only 
given specific information as to what certain frames should look like.  
However, they must also create the frames that are needed in between the 
key frames.  This is sometimes called "tweening."  The designers' models 
that are provided with the storyboard are used as reference information 
to help these animators tween. 
 
THE AMIGA'S ROLE 
 
	So how does the Amiga fit into all of this?  Well, Day basically 
uses a 3-D rendering program to create characters, backgrounds, or 
props.  Once all of the objects are created and properly oriented, he 
can position the camera and print the model on a laser printer.  He can 
literally print the scene from any perspective by simply changing the 
camera view!  For one project, Kelly had to create Goofy's living room.  
Once the room was created in the 3-D program, he printed multi-
perspective background pictures of the room without ever having to draw 
it.  This saves tremendous amounts of time.  The traditional method 
would require each model to be drawn by hand. 
 
	Though Kelly has used various 3-D rendering programs in the past, 
he now relies on Playmation from Hash Enterprises.  Playmation's spline-
based objects are ideal for the output needed.  All scenes are rendered 
to high resolution IFF files.  If you watch cartoons you will notice 
that things are usually a single color outlined in black.  As a result, 
in contrast to the normal 3-D rendering objective of photo-realism, 
objects cannot have any shading--they must be a flat single color.  To 
achieve this, all of the objects are set to reflect 100 percent of the 
ambient light.  Color selection is also very important as objects that 
overlap or are connected must be different colors.  Each side of a cube, 
for example, would have to be a different solid color. 
 
	The rendered picture is then run through a program called Trace.  
Trace is a utility program that comes with Gold Disk's Professional 
Draw, a structured drawing program.  Structured drawing programs are 
used to create high quality output, usually using a Postscript output 
device.  Output quality of structured drawings is determined solely by 
the capabilities of the output device.  Output quality is significanlty 
superior to that of bit-mapped graphics whose resolution is normally 
tied to the display resolution and usually contains a lot of jaggies 
when printed. 
 
	Trace turns the picture into a ProDraw clip that is an outline of 
the original picture.  Trace only draws lines where a color changes from 
one to another.  This is one of the reasons it is important not to have 
any shading.  So if you had a red teapot with a blue handle, Trace would 
separately outline the teapot and handle.  If the handle and teapot were 
the same color, both objects would be outlined, but there would be no 
separation between the pot and handle. 
 
	Once Trace is finished, the clip is loaded into ProDraw for 
printing on a Postscript printer.  This may all seem rather complicated 
but since ProDraw finally supports ARexx, Kelly has written an ARexx 
script to handle nearly everything.  Once all of the frames are 
rendered, Kelly can trace and print each frame automatically with no 
human intervention.  The final printed product is virtually 
indistinguishable from it's hand-drawn counterpart. 
 
	Kelly is also very proud of the fact that he is one of the only 
designers that sometimes includes fully-animated frames for tricky 
sequences.  As discussed above, this work is normally done by the 
animation studio, but any help that he can provide will obviously make 
for a better final product.  Since the scene is already defined in three 
dimensions, all he has to worry about is the path of the camera and the 
timing.  Playmation has a very unique and powerful way of accomplishing 
this using a time-line metaphor. 
 
	When previewing an animation on screen without background, he 
often draws various references directly on the display screen using a 
wipe-off marker.  He indicated that this was much faster than trying to 
genlock the animation over a background .  In other words, it's a quick-
and-dirty way to get the job done.  I've always said that laziness is 
the mother of invention! 
 
	Normally, computer-generated animations are not directly used in 
cartoon animations.  However, a cartoon episode he worked on involved 
the characters playing a video game.  In this case, the lower resolution 
computer output was required.  As a result, an actual Amiga generated 
animation was mixed into the cartoon. 
 
ANIMATIC STORYBOARDS 
 
	The above process is not the end of the Amiga's abilities.  Kelly 
also uses the Amiga to create "animatic storyboards."  Normally there 
are three acts to a 20-minute cartoon and the traditional storyboard for 
each act is several inches thick.  Although, great effort is made to 
include as much information as possible in the storyboards, much 
interpretation is left up to the animation studio as to what the final 
cartoon should look like.  Since each panel in the storyboard represents 
various amounts of time, it is non-linear and the "feel" of the cartoon 
is absent.  The animators are missing the timing of the events and this 
can affect the cartoon's humor. 
 
	An animatic storyboard is a video of the storyboard synced with 
the cartoon's soundtrack.  This gives the animation studio much more 
information about what is desired and how events should be timed.  The 
result is remotely similar to the old slideshow with sound presentations 
they used to show us in grade school. 
 
	To digitize the soundtrack, Sunrize Industries' AD1012 12-bit 
sound board and their Studio 16 software is used.  The storyboard 
pictures are brought into the Amiga using Progressive Peripheral's 
Framegrabber.  Once the sound and pictures have been digitized, the two 
elements must be synced together. 
 
	Gold Disk's Showmaker is used to control when pictures are 
displayed.  However, because he was working with so many frames, Day 
found that Showmaker's input method was very tedious and time consuming.  
As a result, he wrote his own customized input program that saves data 
files in Showmaker format.  Kelly's program not only shows the SMPTE 
time code, but also the film length in feet, a reference methodology 
used by many animators. 
 
	By multitasking Studio 16 with his own program, Kelly can view the 
graphical representation of the soundtrack's soundwave and sync up the 
frames accordingly.  If he needs to know what is happening at a 
particular point in the soundtrack, he can just highlight the portion of 
the soundwave he wants to hear using the mouse and play it. 
 
	When the storyboard is ready to be recorded, the Amiga 2500 runs 
Showmaker to display the frames, and Studio 16 on the Amiga 3000 plays 
the animation soundtrack.  The two computers are kept in sync using an 
independent SMPTE timecode source.  The SMPTE signal is fed 
symultaneously into both Amigas.  The AD1012 in the Amiga 3000 has a 
built-in SMPTE connector; however, on the Amiga 2500, the timing signal 
must be fed into a MIDI interface, so an external SMPTE-to-MIDI 
converter box is used.  The show is recorded onto videotape in real 
time. 
 
	It is important to note that although Day is using two Amigas, 
Showmaker and Studio 16 could be multitasked on the the same computer, 
accomplishing the job using a single Amiga!  Moreover, except for the 
lower sound quality, the Amiga's internal 8-bit sound could also be used 
in lieu of the 12-bit sound board.   
 
	Though the animatic storyboard is not animated per se, it does 
provide timing and give the sense of movement that the traditional 
storyboard lacks.  This makes the communication between the Disney 
designers and the animation studio more effective.  Costly mistakes that 
could require things to be redone might be avoided.  As most computer 
users will attest to, it is infinitely easier to have someone show you 
how to do it, rather than having to read the manual. 
 
	What is really impressive about what Kelly is doing is that all of 
the hardware and software is off-the-shelf stuff.  Moreover, he believes 
that the day for full production of cartoons using only computers may 
not be too far off.  After seeing what he has been able to accomplish, I 
don't doubt it for a second.  Kelly has discovered a more effective way 
to tackle the huge task of animation.  When animation companies start 
realizing the profit potential with using Amigas, look out--the flood 
gates will be opened.

For the past month, I've seen the "Amiga no good for music" thread 
undulate on comp.sys.amiga.music, and I've mostly ignored it.  
Occasionally, though, I drop in and read a random message just to see if 
anything of worth bubbles up.  Most of the time, its nothing really 
interesting, but this time I noticed something worth commenting on.  The 
question someone asked basically went like this: "Amiga makes it possible, 
huh?  Well, show me at least one professional musician who uses Amigas for
sound in the studio."

Well, awhile back, I sent out a request to Usenet to contact Amiga 
musicians for interviews on what they do in Amiga music.  The response I 
got was pretty satisfying-- about 30 musicians contacted me, and a few 
still trickle in.  I received mail from amateurs, professionals, dabblers,
and experts-- some use the Amiga soley for trackers, others for 
professional video, and one who replied has even been a part of writing 
the music for Lemmings.

My apologies, however, go to the people I contacted, since things here at 
school got a little too hectic for me to really follow through with the 
interviews.  Perhaps I can continue with the interviews over the summer or
next semester.  But, before all that started, I managed to contact at 
least one musician.  His name is Eric Gieseke, otherwise known as 
Sidewinder.

Who's Sidewinder, you ask?  Well, look back through your volumous 
collection of Amiga Report-- and in AR214 you'll find in the news section
an announcement/advertisement of his latest CD, "Future Shock 2."  It was 
produced by Sidewinder himself, using the Amiga for CD quality sound, and
remixed on DAT at Rock House Studios.  Even the cover art was rendered on 
an Amiga 3000!  "Future Shock 1," his previous release, is available on 
cassette soon to be remastered on CD.  To me, all this makes Sidewinder 
fit the description of "professional musician."

Sidewinder's been writing music on the Amiga for about 7 years, starting 
with Sonix 2.0.  ("Really quite pathetic stuff I suppose," he said.)  A 
few years and 50 songs later, he discovered the trackers-- MED 1.1 and 
ProTracker-- while living in Indonesia.  And since 1991, he's released 
about 100 .MODs and has a few more unreleased.  Only about 40 of those 
tunes have been imported to the internet on Aminet, in his own directory
"mods/sidew."  The rest of them reside on the GEnie StarShip BBS.  (And 
I really wish someone would import the rest of them to the internet!  
Hint, hint, hint! =) =) =) )

The kind of music he writes, I think, is amazing.  His .MODs are some of 
the best music I've heard anywhere, let alone on the Amiga.  He tends to
do mostly techno-ish pieces, but to define him by that label is an 
injustice.  His works tend to be pretty danceable but don't exactly fall 
into the same monotony which is the hallmark of a lot of rave and techno 
artists.  He shows a versatility and inventiveness in his songs that I 
really admire, being a rookie in the Amiga .MOD scene.  He takes the 
elements of techno and dance and jazz and world music and swirls them 
all into unique mosaics of style.  From the sweet ambient melodies of 
"Beyond_Dreams" and "Jasmine" to the high energy techno of "Anestesia" 
and "RadioRevolution"-- Sidewinder's works have become featured selections
on my hard drive.  Sidewinder uses the media of the .MOD to its fullest, 
grabbing bits and pieces like samples from the world around him to create
wonderful new sounds.

And speaking of the world around him, Sidewinder himself has been around 
the world.  "I'd say that the WORLD is my best influence since I've 
traveled and lived on every continent in the world other than Antarctica,"
he said.  Also, he mentioned the Amiga .MOD and demo scene as his other 
major inspirations, as well as "real world" techno musicians like Moby, 
Aphex Twin, and Prodigy.  Oh, and throw in the muses of "liquor and pizza"
and you've got a good picture of Sidewinder's inspirations.

Today, 25-year-old Eric Gieseke, a.k.a Sidewinder the Camel Jockey 
Extraordinaire, lives in San Antonio, TX.  You can find him on the staff 
of the GEnie StarShip as the host of the music conference, every Thursday
night @ 10pm EST.  I have no clue where to find his .MODs on GEnie 
StarShip, but as for the internet, try the "/pub/aminet/mods/sidew" 
directory on Aminet.  As for the CD, contact Sidewinder Productions at 
this address:

          SIDEWINDER PRODUCTIONS
          8611 Cape Valley
          San Antonio TX 78227

The disc is about $12.95 plus shipping and handling, and although I 
haven't gotten a copy for myself yet, I'd highly recommend it.  I've 
heard most of the songs on it as .MODs, so I can't wait to hear them 
as studio recordings.

"Large and glowing amounts of A1200 optimism from the UK."

There I was being all despondent about the Amiga dying with the A500
when all of a sudden, A1200 owners started springing up like
squirrels out of hibernation. It seems the good old days are back in
Europe with more A1200s than you can comfortably shake a rather
large stick at ! I`m sure that some people are pissed with where the
BigC have gone, (and where they should be going now), but the rest of
us are using the very best of what`s out there and are making things
even better. Once more Amiga is the computer to have.

Isn`t it time we gave Commodore a break and redirected our energy to 
help people make the right choice in a bewildering computer market. 
All you have to do is get people you know to buy Amiga too !!! Forget 
the A4000 and consider that you can pick up an A1200 - 85Mb HD and a 
German M-Tec board, taking you up to 6Mb RAM with a 68030 processor, 
all for stlg700. Now do you see the light ? Simply point people in the 
correct mail order direction & remind them that their computer will 
be so fast that they will have to glue it to their desk.

Even more good news is it that I have never seen piracy at such a
low level on the Amiga (about time too). Perhaps the Amiga community
passing through unstable waters has in some way shaken off the
parasites, leaving the truly dedicated owners to start things
afresh. Probably not... Probably more to do with the fact that there
is a wealth of well tested and playable software from the A500
available at ridiculously low prices.

Now for a story. Let me tell you about my "humble" A1200 sitting next 
to a 486 DX - 25MHz 4Mb SVGA with soundcard. (Which cost THREE times 
as much may I add). During this direct comparrison of the machines in 
operation while they lived next to each other for a year, (which was 
not a useless technical specification comparrision writen down on 
paper), you will be pleased to know that the cheap & cheerful 
Commodore held it`s head up high - and on many an occasion laughed 
hysterically at the PC. To say that the IBM clone was having 
compatibility problems is like describing a tidalwave as moist. Also, 
the software it was running under Windows still required so much 
extra hardware to make it all worth while that even this stlg1000 plus 
PC was falling over. It is not good to have your Windows Swapfile go 
on holiday when switching to a different application in your 
supposedly multitasking environment.

It seems the more MicroSoft try to make the IBM clones fully 
compatible in the current nightmarish mess of conflicting standards, 
the more the systems become prone to crashing. Maybe they should 
rename Windows 4.0 Chicago to Windows 4.0 Quicksand. MicroSoft might 
be heading towards being the only software corporation in the world 
but bear this quote in mind...

"Just like genetic diversity which prevents an epidemic from wiping
out a whole species at once, diversity in software is a good thing."
- Clifford Stoll.

I have seen an A1200 emulating Windows through a module system as 
someones University project, but to be honest do we really want that ?

I am not saying the PC isn`t good, just take a look at Word6 or Doom. 
What I am saying is that after a year of bickering about which 
machine is the best, myself and my friends are learning to see the 
advantages of each. We all agree, the A1200 is *the* homecomputer.

Spread the word.

Maybe it's the strain.  Week after week, day after day, wondering whether 
or not Commodore will wake up the next morning as a company.  Wondering 
what will become of the Amiga line of computers.

Maybe it's just gotten to be too much for me and I've snapped.

Then again, maybe not.

Maybe I'm just looking at the more positive things.

Maybe it's that a friend just sold her 486/66 for an Amiga 4000/040. (Ok,
yeah, she is getting a bridgeboard, but I'll take my victories where I 
can get them.)

Maybe it's that the UK Top Ten CD games chart has 8 slots, including #1,
filled by CD32 games.

Maybe it's that the CD32 is RSN in the US, and is actually being given a
fighting chance by some game magazines and Commodore advertising.

Maybe it's that Commodore may just have made it through the worst of 
times, what with their life being spared to date and all.

Or maybe it's things like this:  Yesterday, I took a friend of mine, Dave
Alexander, to MicroTech Solutions, my local Amiga store.  I'd been meaning
to for a long time: He's been a Mac user for years and has done video 
production and the like on them: nothing incredibly intense, but he's 
used video-out boards and presentation/titling software.

The biggest disappointment of the day was that the entire suite of Toaster
equipment was gone, off at a show.  That wasn't really the most important
part, though: I knew the Toaster was out of the range of money he was 
willing to spend.  It DID leave Scala, which is what I intended to be the
main attraction.  For a good 20 minutes, he watched Scala demos as the 
sales guy (trivia note: the same one who sold me the 2000 I had when I 
began writing for AR) demonstrated how the program worked.  He was 
transfixed.

"This is MUCH better than Persuasion." -Dave Alexander

Scala MM300 was running on the A4000 they had there, which was decked to 
the gills...EtherNet, an EGS Spectrum, Emplant, 14 megs of memory, some 
ungodly huge hard drive, 040/25, etc.  MM200 was running on the 1200, and
it was that computer that we wound up focusing on: after all, everything 
was still running at an awfully comparable speed in those demo scripts. 
He asked me about prices and we set up a few theoretical systems.

Yeah, we left without him buying anything other than a Video Toaster User.
Still, though, it was a moral victory, and he punctuated the trip by 
saying this: "Why is Commodore not doing well?"

I really couldn't answer.  Why not?

Here is the second puzzle used in the second Amiga Report contest.
Along with it you will find one possible solution and the winner!


THE PUZZLE:

       The ASCII table contains the alphabetic characters from A
    to Z, in sorted order. This character set is the basis for many
    languages, and should be common knowledge to anyone reading this.
    However, there exists a commonly used set of 26 characters, using
    these letters, in non-sorted order. Each character appears once
    and only once. In this non-sorted set, some of the characters do
    appear in alphabetic order, however there exist two characters
    which appear in reverse-sorted order. Where is this set found,
    and what are the two characters?


         To enter, simply let your fingers do the talking and type up an
    email and send it to dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu, or send a post
    card or letter to:


THE WRONG ANSWERS:

        ROT13 (NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ) is not correct.
    Although it is not in perfect sorted order, in a way it is. There
    are two characters in reverse-sorted order, namely Z and A at the
    middle two locations. However, the puzzle states that "some of the
    characters appear in sorted order", while ROT13 has nearly all of
    them in sorted order.


THE WINNING ANSWER:

        The prize winner is Daniel Lapine, drawn from the winning
    answers. And he entered by snail mail too!

            "The code is called the Murray (commonly known as the
        Baudot) code.  The two letters in reverse order are N and M."

                        - from a previous winner who describes it best!

        Or commonly known as the QWERTY keymap. Some characters are in
    sorted order, such as FGH JKL OP, etc. However, the N and M are in
    reverse sorted order on the keymap! Another entry suggested the
    German kaymap, which contains the Z and Y in non-sorted order as
    the QWERTY keymap has the N and M.


THE BREAKDOWN:

        - The ASCII table contains the alphabetic characters from A
       to Z, in sorted order. This character set is the basis for
       many languages, and should be common knowledge to anyone
       reading this.

            Hopefully to set a standard term, so I don't get entries
            like "the Martian alphabet has only 8 letters" and stuff
            like that.

        - However, there exists a commonly used set of 26 characters,
        using these letters, in non-sorted order.

            This being the keyboard on most Amigas.

        -  In this non-sorted set, some of the characters do appear
        in alphabetic order, however there exist two characters which
        appear in reverse-sorted order.

            This being the QWERTY keymap and the letters N and M,
            which most people correctly identified.

        - To enter, simply let your fingers do the talking and type
        up an email and send it to dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu.

            This phrase was purposely put in as a clue: "type up".


THE DISCLAIMER:

    DISCLAIMER: This contest is being provided as a service to the
    Amiga community and all persons involved in running this contest
    cannot be held liable for anything that costs you money or
    lifetime pain and anguish. Rules are subject to change. All entries
    must be received by April 30th, 1994. Any entries beyond this date
    will be entered into the next contest, if any.

        2. ARexx Reference Disk by Merrill Callaway.

        3. FutureShock II audio compact disc by SIDEWINDER.


- THE PRIZE FOR NEXT MONTH -

    The Amiga Report contest is still going on, and it is not too
late to enter. This ongoing monthly contest allows Amiga Report
readers a chance to win software by either solving a puzzle or by
entering a random drawing.

    The prize this month is the Amiga/Toaster Reference Manual v2.221,
from Area52. This is a 1,000 page help system for the Amiga and Video
Toaster, covering the Workbench, AmigaDOS, Lightwave, and more ($34.95).
    The second prize choice is Merrill Callaway's AmigaGuide based
ARexx Reference Manual. This is from the author of the ARexx Cookbook,
and a journalist for Amazing Computing magazine ($24.95).
    Also, as a third prize, we are offering the FutureShock audio
CDROM,  which was produced using Amiga computers by SideWinder ($12.95).

    All monthly contests end on the morning of the first of the
following month. Any entries beyond this date will be entered into the
next contest.


- THE MONTHLY DRAWING -

    To enter the random drawing, select a number from 1 to 262,144
and send it to me at one of my addresses listed below, either by
the postal service or email through the Internet.
    Also, you may enter by solving the following puzzle. The winner
of this puzzle will be decided within the same time frame as the
random prize, to allow the contest information to filter through the
networks, and to allow your letters and postcards to come in.


- THE PUZZLE -

    Since people complained that the first contest was too hard, and
that the second was too easy, I made one that anyone can solve with
a little thought. Once you get some of it decoded you will be able
to solve it with ease ::heh heh::!

        Decrypt the following encoded message: 17851 47932

        Each location in the code represents one character in the
    ASCII character set from A to Z. Also provide your method of
    obtaining the answer.


- TO ENTER -

    To enter, simply let your fingers do the talking and type up an
email and send it to dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu, or send a post
card or letter to:

This Emplant/A-Max IV string is, perhaps, running a bit long.  I plan
to offer my Amiga-side benchmarks this week, then sum it all up
in the next week or two and offer my final evaluation.  Right now,
I'd like to thank Jim Drew of Utilities Unlimited and June Brown of
ReadySoft for providing the boards in the first place.

Qualitative...
--------------
A friend owns a Mac LCIII.  He's the one who provides me with a large
amount of the Mac software I run in these reviews, and he told me to
run Mac BZone (a BattleZone, the old arcade game, clone.)  I showed him
its performance on my system and he was thoroughly impressed.
Mind you, he had to run FPU emulators to get it to work, but nonetheless,
he was surprised at the results on both emulators.  From my experience,
it winds up how the benchmarks suggest it should:  faster on the A-Max IV
in black and white and faster on the Emplant in 16 color.  I will say 
this: The Emplant tends to do gameplay slightly better than the A-Max IV.
Largely, it is due to the faster 16-color performance on my ECS chipset,
and it may have something to do with mouse and "unconventional"
routine support, such as with the game Star Wars: clearly not a system-
friendly application, but Emplant is playable while A-Max IV stutters 
quite a bit with the mouse translation.  On a broad scale, however, 
(general application work and the like) I make out no real speed 
differences between the two...in fact, surprisingly, MacMan Classic (a 
near-perfect PacMan clone) runs almost identically on the two systems, and
it uses color.  Strange, but then, so is multitasking Macintosh emulation.

Quantitative...
----------------
Ok, so which machine lets you do what you want on the Amiga side while
it runs?  Most importantly, can you just leave it running and do something
else while the Mac sits idle?  Emplant's method of handling it is a 
selectable task-priority for an unselected emulation.  ReadySoft, through 
checkbox options, lets you decide how system time will be allocated, the 
optimum situation for the Amiga being that all unused time goes back to 
the Amiga, especially while not selected.  I didn't expect the performance
to differ much, actually, in terms of making time available for the Amiga.
I was right.  In looking at the AIBB modules (I will make them available to
anyone who is interested, just ask), on tests run on the following systems:

A-Max IV, priority 10
A-Max IV, priority 0
Emplant, priority 0
Stock A3000/25 (multitasking disabled)

with multitasking enabled for the emulator tests and the Mac Bzone
intro screen running on the Mac emulation, -1 priority set to unselected
for Emplant and the "turn-over-all-unused-time" option set on A-Max.
No other programs are running anywhere else.

The results are pretty close to equal.  There were a few exceptions, but
I wouldn't read too much into them:

Counting ties and treating the A-Max 10 and 0 priority together, A-Max
actually won most of the tests.  The 0 priority A-Max won more than the
priority 10 A-Max did (understandably):
Flops, TGTest, EllipseTest, LineTest, BeachBall, and InstTest

Emplant took WritePixel only, but it is worth mentioning LOUDLY that
the majority of the tests were very, very close.  Only a couple of tests
have strange results:

On TGTest, both A-Max trials had a 1.  Emplant was close behind at .96,
but the clean 3000 took a .9.  Strange.  Similar results occurred with
Ellipse, but the Emplant was a mere .01 off the A-Maxes, and with
LineTest, which has A-Maxes at 1, Emplant at .99, and the 3000 way
down at .83.  This was not the sort of thing I expected.

Emplant was the only test that didn't take a 1 in TranTest: it had a .93.

So what do I make out of all of this?  Taking the tests and the 
performance of the machines into account, there's really not much of a 
difference. A few of the tests come up with noteworthy results, but the 
overall effect is very similar.  When it's time to give up time, both 
emulators do a good job.

A-Max IV serial files?  Apparently, a good thing.
----------------------------------------------
If you remember, I posed the question "What good is directing serial
output to a file?"  Maxwell Daymon (mdaymon@rainbow.sosi.com) knows
more about it than I do, so I'll let him tell you.
[begin quote]

> Can someone explain the practicality of this to me? 

Sure, we use one of two devices: Our $2,000 laser printer (600dpi) or an 
$86,000 Linotronic imagesetter (>2000dpi)

In order to use the Linotronic, we have to output to a file which many 
Mac programs don't like to do. They ASSUME (Quark 3.1.1) that the 
Linotronic is hooked up (via Appletalk) or you're a worthless pig who 
doesn't deserve output. Thank Readysoft for this feature!!!

Also, I don't want to have my laser printer hooked up to both ports, and 
I prefer using the Amiga port - so being able to select an Amiga port is 
also very helpful for programs/drivers that don't *demand* Appletalk.

Anyhow - they are very useful features when you consider service bureau 
output considerations.
[end quote]

There you have it.  Serial files explained.

Bringing it all to a close...
-------------------------

Believe me, this has been a fun run.  I believe I've done a pretty good 
job of showing the strengths of each emulator as the series has gone on.
Now, though, I think it's time to wrap things up and offer some final
analysis and conclusions.  So I'll do it in the next issue. :)

Seriously, coming soon should be reviews of the GoldenGate II board,
the SX-1 (not truly an emulator, but I'll pretend and you'll play along),
and the Vortex 486/50 board.

Thus, within two weeks, the Emplant/A-Max IV saga shall draw to a close.
Oh, expect random comments about them to flow in future issues...you'll
see the occasional benchmark or quote or two, some performance reports,
maybe even a couple of really useful Mac programs on the new Amiga
Report coverdisk.  We'll see.

Until then, keep the emulators warm.

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

  Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

  And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

  UNIX "telnet" program from an account you may already
  have on an Internet-connected system. 
% 9600 bps Sprintnet in over 300 cities areas
+ $10 rate prevails at smaller US Cities
# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

/// BIX - Byte Information Exchange             Lots of information!
    -------------------------------



BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and enthusiasts.
While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is the place for 
knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  You're likely 
to find many others in similar situations who can offer advice, give 
technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.


                       *** FULL INTERNET ACCESS! ***

BIX features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription. 


                      ==============================
                      Rates and Connect Information:
                      ==============================


BIX membership costs $13 per month, plus connect time.  There are several 
different ways to connect:

SprintNet*              $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet:**               $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
(SprintNet and Tyment rates shown are for 48 contiguous US states only.)
                                                        
Tymnet Canada:          $4/hr eves/wkends           $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet Hawaii:          $10/hr eves/wkends          $20/hour weekdays   
Telnet(via Internet):   $1/hour, round the clock
Direct dial (Boston):   $2/hour, round the clock (up to 9600 bps)
 
 * SprintNet daytime hours are from 6am to 7pm, M-F, ET.
** Tymnet daytime hours are from 7am to 6pm, M-F, ET.

                20/20 PLAN OPTION (for USA-48 users only):

Volume users can choose the 20/20 Advantage Plan, which is $20 per month
and includes the first 20 hours of access by any combination of methods 
from the contiguous United States.  Additional use is $1.80 per hour 
(additional use for telnet access is $1 an hour).  The 20/20 Plan's cost is 
in addition to the $13 monthly fee.  


                           INTERNATIONAL USERS:

If you wish to connect internationally through Tymnet or SprintNet, 
please contact your local PTT.  BIX accepts prepaid international calls,
direct dial, or telnet connections.  In order to make a "collect" (not 
prepaid) call to BIX, your account must be verified before the charges 
are accepted.  When you complete the registration, we'll mail you a BIX
Membership Agreement by regular US Mail.  Whe you receive it, sign it 
and return it to us by mail.  When we receive it here, we'll authorize
your account to make reverse charged calls.

If you want to access BIX right away, contact your local PTT to set up a 
prepaid account.  You'll pay your local carrier for your calls to BIX in
advance, so there's no waiting period or verfication needed. Or, connect 
at BIX via telnet to x25.bix.com.

SprintNet international calls from most locations are $24 an hour.
Tymnet international charges vary, but are generally between $20-$30 an hour.


                           ====================
                           Billing Information: 
                           ====================

You can charge your monthly BIX membership fees to your Visa, 
Mastercard, Discover, or American Express card.

You may have your company invoiced for one or more BIX memberships with 
a BIX Corporate Account.

                            ===================
                            To Sign Up For BIX:
                            ===================

   Dial by modem 1-800-695-4882 or 617-491-5410 *

   Press a few carriage returns until you see the Login:(enter "bix") 
   prompt, then type  bix

   At the Name? prompt, type bix.amrpt

* Users already on the internet can telnet to x25.bix.com instead.
  At the USERNAME: prompt enter bix, then bix.net at the Name? prompt.
  Once your account is registered, you can connect the same way, except
  at the Name? prompt you'll enter your BIXname and then your password.

States to take advantage of our special "5 for $5" offer.  This offer 
lets you use up to 5 hours of evening/weekend time on BIX during the 
current calender month (whatever month you sign up in), for $5.  
Additional time is $1.80 per hour ($1 per hour for telnet).  At the end 
of the calender month, you will be placed into our standard rate plan, 
at $13 monthly plus connect charges.  You may also join the 20/20 Plan 
at this time.

DESCRIPTION

        Scheduler is a database, and appointment reminder utility 
    for the Amiga running OS2.04 and above. It allows you to keep
    track of all your friends, relatives, and business associates.
    It contains name, address, company name, 4 phone numbers, and
    a notes area. It works with most modems, so you can dial their
    home, work, or any number you wish. It supports CallerID so
    when someone is calling you it will search the database and
    show you who is calling! *The registered version contains a 
    call-logging feature that logs all calls coming in (with 
    CallerID) and out (dialing with Scheduler). It also lets you 
    setup several groups of entries, so you can categorize
    your database. Have your friends in a group named 'Friends' and
    family in 'Family'.
        The Calendar half of Scheduler makes it a very powerful reminder
    utility. It shows you a graphic look at your month's schedule by
    showing you how much of your month, even day is being spent! You
    can set alarms for any occasion.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    + Needs AmigaDOS 2.04 or greater

NEW FEATURES

    + All Bugs Fixed from 1.0

a CD-ROM drive running in a Novell network. The BBS software is a
Norwegian origin MBBS running in a DesqView windows.

We have now (26th March 1994) over 10000 files online (mostly for
the Commodore Amiga line of the personal computers.)

Every user has an access to download filelist (LAHOFIL.ZIP), list of the
Finnish 24-hour BBS's (BBSLIST.ZIP or BBSLIST.LHA) and every issue of
the Amiga Report Magazine (AR101.LHA-AR???.LHA) even on their first call.

The system has been running since 1989 and is sponsored by the local
telephone company, Vaasan Lnin Puhelin Oy.

BTW, LAHO stands for "LAtomeren Hyrylaiva Oy" = "Barnsea Steamship Co."
