It's the Magic Month, September.

Remember, this was the month we were told Amigas would first be available.
And, in a rather non-concrete form, it looks like preparations are being
made to get them out, with a UK press/dealer conference to generate
interest and an announcement of the array of pack-in software that will
come with each machine.

Gilles Bourdin of Amiga Technologies told me today that 100,000 A1200s have
already been sold in pre-orders.

Of course, on the other hand, only the continent of Europe has any sort of
solid distribution network.  In North America, we are still waiting, just
as the Australians are.  God only knows what the intrepid South American
and African Amiga users are thinking now, to say nothing of AR's readers in
Kiev.

AR's getting rather old, and it's time to shake things up from time to
time.  After all, it was pointed out to me last night that, with AR 3.16,
there have been 89 issues of Amiga Report.  That is a lot of magazine.

Am I tired of it?  Nah, not at all.  But sometimes it's nice to get a new
logo (thanks again, Gareth) or switch the icon (courtesy of Philip
Vedovatti).  In fact, we've been playing with all sorts of ideas for AR.
An independent reader has taken it upon himself to release a graphical HTML
version of AR with each new release to Aminet (Thanks, Josef@IRC).  As for
AR proper-well, there are only so many neat things you can do with
AmigaGuide, but plans are in the works to come up with a modular system to
add little "multimedia niceties" onto the magazine.  I won't do anything if
the work involved detracts from the quality and content of the magazine,
but it's something worth exploring.

For all the talk we've done about supporting the Amiga over the past
months, the fact remains that if Amigas and Amiga products don't sell, the
market collapses.  Included in this issue is not only a collection of news
and reviews on recent products, but the return of paid advertising.  A
group of Amiga companies decided it was worth their while to pay the AR
expense account this month in exchange for a chance to reach the Amiga
public.  I can't make you, but I'd like to ask that you at least take a
couple of minutes to flip through our advertising text.

Speaking of talk, there was quite a bit of it at Amiga Convention '95.  A
show report appears in this issue.  It should pretty well close out my
summer of travel, but the prospects for a late autumn/early winter North
American Amiga show are good.  Any European show organizers interested in
flying me out as a speaker are, of course, more than welcome to contact me.
:)

One last thing-while contact information is nearly impossible to get, it
has been confirmed that a company known as ISE has been contracted to do
all Amiga hardware and software development, on demand, from Amiga
Technologies.  They have already been in contact with a number of Amiga
engineers and developers, but no hirings have been reported yet-largely due
to the apparent requirement that engineering be done in Germany, ISE's
home.

become quite popular for many FAQ's!

Hello Jason....

I have been an Amiga Report reader for some time now (my archive goes back
as far as AR201, but I remember well, the pre-Amigaguide days).  I have
often thought of writing you, as you seem to be an authority in most Amiga
matters these days.  But, due to lack of time, vocabulary (and general
ambition), I've waited until now.  Until I had a problem that seemed
important enough to warrant a request for help.  Let me explain.

I originally had a one year subscription to the now defunct American Amiga
Magazine "Amiga World", published by IDG.  I actually received a few issues
prior to their demise and rather enjoyed them.  Then I received a postcard
in the mail indicating that "AW" was being discontinued, and that the
remainder of my subscription would be fulfilled with my choice of either
some kind of Amiga 3D graphics/Video magazine or "Amiga Format", one of
IDG's European Amiga mags.

I selected "Amiga Format", and actually received one issue--the prior
month's issue--but hey, a magazine I hadn't read already.  Well that was
back in July.  I have recieved nothing since then.

Have your heard of this phenomenon?  Were you a subscriber to "AW"?  Would
you happen to have an email address for IDG?  I do have an address for IDG
in the UK, but I thought I'd check with you and your readers first.  If
possible, would you be able to mention this in your next issue of AR to see
if I'm the only one getting this treatment?  I'm wondering if I am in the
same boat with a lot of other people.......

Keep the hard drives spinning.....

Subject: Amiga Report Reader Mail Feedback
Date: Wed, 30 Aug 95 12:29:00 EST

Jason,

I've just read the reader mail of AR315 for the second or third time and
I'm writing to comment on the concerns of Amiga users out there.

First of all, we all share in David Bias' frustration I'm sure, but I
believe we must remain optimistic that Escom wouldn't spend millions on
something just for the hell of it.  They would be looking to make money out
of it someway or another.  Judging on what has happened in the past years
(nothing), what they do can't be so bad.  They can't be that stupid not to
listen to Amiga worshippers worldwide at least a little.

Second, I think all of us at one time or another have tried to turn someone
towards purchasing or converting to Amiga.  Some Will, Some Won't, So
What............Some Will!.  Then what happens to our integrity when WE
throw in the towel.  We need to stick together.  Even though the Amiga
never becomes 'the chosen' machine of the future, if all that comes out of
this is a little worldwide Amiga community with continued hardware support
from Escom, Who Cares.  What would be the value of the Amiga platform if
everyone used it ?  We all know that something's value comes from it's
scarcity.

Third, we the users need to support the platform by not using pirate
software.  I believe if people had faith in the Amiga, they would fork out
money to buy software.  Right now I suppose the people's faith depends on
what Escom does in the short term.  Let's hope it's something good.

Last but not least.  As far as marketing the Amiga goes, I guess Escom's
got a challenge on their hands.  My suggestion to them is AMWAY....What?, I
hear you say, yep, good 'ol little Amway.  They turned over approximately 6
billion dollars US last financial year and big companies are beginning to
take notice.  Look at what they did for MCI.  The good thing about them is,
first, they've already established 2 million distributors worldwide with an
average growth of 20% per annum.  That's unheard of in the corporate world.
Second, they do the marketing for you and with the aid of shopping channels
in the near future (I think a CD32 set-top box might be useful here), the
Amiga could be on every television screen around the globe.  Third, you pay
Amway out of the profit you make from sales. 

I think Escom should seriously consider this suggestion before they miss
the boat and someone else jumps onto the AMWAY bandwagon.  And if you're
all wondering, yes I'm an Amway distributor who loves the Amiga.

Faithfully,

Thierry Dureau,
Melbourne Australia.

Jason,

In response to the letter from David Bias (AR 3.15) about the demise of the
future of AMIGA, I am generally in agreement.  It is unfortunate that even
with the aquisition of AMIGA by ESCOM the AMIGA will soon be a fading light
in the expanse of a computer sky.  The US should definately add this
creature to it's Endangered Species List.

I still own (2) Amigas and will continue to use them until they can no
longer serve me.  It pains me greatly in saying this.  Deep in my heart of
hearts, I guess I felt this coming on, but have suppressed it for as long
as I could.  I will have to look to another platform to fill my future
needs.  (There I've said it :( )

With the advent of Win95 (ouch - that hurt) people are being bombarded with
it's (supposedly) uniqueness - HAH!  And this is what will be remembered as
the OS for their needs.  Noone will know or remember Amiga OS's greatness
because it will be lost with the passing of time.

I'm afraid ESCOM's only interest is squeezing the technology for all they
can get from it and then tossing the rind in the garbage to be hauled away
to the nearest landfill.

The Amiga will live in my memories and I will recall it's service to me
with great fondness from time to time.  Just as I recall many pleasures
from my childhood - they are now only memories - and in a like way so will
my Amiga.

===========================================================================
                         DREAMS OF A LOW END AMIGA
  Nickolas Marentes                                STAUROS@OZEMAIL.COM.AU
===========================================================================

Primary limitations of the existing design

CPU Speed
While the Amiga has some very good custom chips supporting the CPU, several
applications do not benafit as much from these enhancements.  Applications
such as ray tracing and texture mapping are primarily CPU intensive tasks.
The IBM PC's are much better at these due to their fast 486 and Pentium
CPU's.

System Presentation
To most non-amiga people, the appearance of the A1200 leads them to believe
that it is nothing more than a larger C64.  They immediately develop the
impression that the system is nothing more than a toy computer specifically
designed for games.  If one was to place on display the A1200 alongside an
ancient IBM PC/XT and ask a group of totally computer illiterate people
which computer they feel is the more powerful, most of them will say the
PC/XT.  Unfortunately, people DO judge a book by its cover.


Concept Design No.1

Module 1:
A CD based games console much like the CD-32 with the optional expansion to
a video CD player or Set-Top box via a trapdoor expansion bay.  The unit
should be narrower across the front but deeper towards the back than the
original CD-32.  The inclusion of an infra-red remote pickup for an
optional remote control so that the unit can be used as part of the home
entertainment system without ugly joystick cables dangling everywhere.  The
mainboard can be the same spec as in the CD-32 but with a faster CPU and
4Mb RAM for improved processing speed to better compete with the range of
new games consoles coming out from the competition.  This unit would appeal
to anyone who simply wants a low cost game console and/or a video/audio CD
player with the capability for expansion to a full computer using Module 2.


Module 2:
A unit with the same width and depth as module 1 but double the height. 
This unit clips onto the bottom of module 1 to give the appearance of a
small mini-tower type computer with a top load CD-ROM drive.  Module 2
should include, memory expansion, parallel/serial ports, real time clock,
an internal 3.5" hard disk, a front mounted floppy drive and at least 2
internal expansion slots (basically all the extra components required to
bring it up to A1200 spec).  Front mounted connectors for a detachable
keyboard and mouse (supplied with Module 2) and rear mounted connectors for
printer and serial ports.

The entire unit could be coloured the same as the original CD-32,
"techo-black".  The power supply may be shared between the two modules or
possibly module 2 could come with it's own internal supply designed to
power both.  This design allows people to start off at a minimal expense
and upgrade to a full A1200 later while still retaining a degree of
professionalism in the final configuration.  It also means all future Amiga
users will have a CD-ROM drive as standard opening the doors for more
CD-ROM based software to be developed.  It also means the Akiko chip with
it's planar-to-chunky graphics conversion will be available to all new
Amiga's allowing for all future software to take advantage of improved
texture mapping capabilities.  This design should be relatively low cost to
produce while still providing a powerful complete system, all using the
tried and proven AGA chipset.


Concept Design No. 2

This design uses the existing A1200 and adds an expansion unit which sits
underneath the monitor.  Anyone who remembers the original Tandy/Radio
Shack TRS-80 Model 1 design, will recognize this design.

The unit would sit directly behind the A1200 with all cables from the A1200
passing underneath the unit.  An expansion board that plugs into the A1200
trapdoor adds a faster CPU, the Akiko chip and acts as a bus expansion
buffer that leads to a high density connector replacing the knock-out panel
on the back of the A1200.  The expansion box would plugs into this.

Inside the expansion unit will be a power supply (which also powers the
A1200), memory expansion sockets, several Zorro expansion slots and space
for a front loaded CD-ROM drive (high enough so that it clears the A1200
when opened).

If an enhanced A1200 is released later with a faster CPU (A1300?) this same
expansion box could be used but the new machine would provide this bus
expansion connector as standard.  The case styling should be made to match
the A1200 so that it looks part of the system and not a third party
"bolt-on".

The benefits of this design are the same as in Design 1.

If anyone has any questions about my ideas (Escom...you're invited!) please
feel free to leave me an E-mail message on STAUROS@OZEMAIL.COM.AU and start

Newsgroups: comp.emulators.misc
Subject: Amiga emulator available (not a hoax!)
Date: 30 Aug 1995 11:59:20 GMT

I have uploaded uae-0.1.tar.gz to sunsite.unc.edu:pub/Linux/Incoming. The
file should move to pub/Linux/system/Emulators in a few months time.

"UAE" stands for "The Unusable Amiga Emulator".  It is a partial software
emulation of the Amiga hardware.  It is far from usable, since some vital
features are missing, and it is way too slow.  However, it should put an
end to arguments that it can't be done.  There is quite a bit of room for
improvements, I expect a full (usable) emulation can be done in about five
years time.  Don't complain, C64 emulators need a P90, too, to run at full
speed, and an Amiga is somewhat more complex.

Although this is not a hoax emulator, it can't do more than that: It can
currently just display the Kickstart logo.  I have not been able to get the
disk support working yet.  Maybe someone would like to help me, I am rather
busy with other projects.  The sources are there...

UAE runs on Unix systems with the X Window System.  I am developing it
using Linux, but I have also been able to get it to run on a HP Apollo and
a Sun Sparcstation.  You need a C++ compiler, or you have to make small
modifications to turn it into a C program (nothing major).  You also need
to transfer a Kickstart ROM image to your PC.

The following parts are emulated:
  - MC68000 CPU: Almost done, some rare instructions (ABCD, ...) are not
    emulated yet.
  - Blitter: If there's no bug, it ought to be complete.
  - Copper: Not much to emulate here
  - Timers: I think these are fully working, too.

Not done properly:
  - Playfield (display) hardware: Only black & white graphics, no dual
    playfield support, no HAM.
  - Sprites: None.
  - Sound: None.
  - Mouse, Keyboard, Joystick: None.
  - Timing: The CPU and blitter cycles are counted, but I have not bothered
    yet to adjust the timing to match the characteristics of a real A500

  - Floppy disk: Broken.

I think the hardest parts are done, except the disk support, debugging and
speed improvements.

Just as a side note: Maybe it might be easier to turn this into an Atari ST
emulation first, and debug that.  I think the ST has considerably less
hardware complexity.  If some ST experts would like to work on that, please
feel free to contact me.

Otherwise, mail me if you have comments, bug reports or enhacements.

Bernd Schmidt

  ======================================================================
  Amiga-Link                PRESS RELEASE                August 25, 1995
  ======================================================================

             The Amiga-Link 2.0 / Envoy 2.0 Networking Package
             -------------------------------------------------

AmiTrix Development announced today that they will now be distributing the
Amiga-Link/Envoy networking package for all Amigas.  Arrangements have been
made with Intangible Assets Manufacturing (IAM), and with ABF Computer GbR,
that will see "Envoy 2.0" bundled together with an updated, fully
translated version of "Amiga-Link", to be assembled and distributed by
AmiTrix.

Amiga-Link is a complete solution to your Amiga peer-to-peer networking
needs.  With the included software and hardware, you can share your hard
drives and printers, as well as run other network applications.  This
package is compatible with all Amiga models, using the floppy port for
maximum compatibility across models, and keeping other ports available for
their intended uses.  Low cost "rendering farms" are now possible.

The Amiga-Link package comes with both the standard AmigaLink software and
also the Amiga Envoy software.  The Amigalink software's advantage is that
it works with AmigaOS1.3, providing compatibility with older machines,
whereas Amiga Envoy requires 2.04 or higher, but provides superior
performance, device sharing, and an API that allows for the development of
third-party networking applications, with many already available.

Amiga-Link provides a less expensive method of peer to peer networking
using compact modules connected to the external floppy port and linked
together with BNC connectors and coaxial cables.  The SANA-II device driver
allows all Amiga's (including those without Zorro-II expansion slots), to
be connected in a network of up to 20 machines, within a distance of 330
feet (100m).  DMA data transfer, at 450,000 bps from network to memory,
avoids CPU contention common to the parallel/serial port networks, and
leaves these ports free for normal use.  This is roughly equivalent to
ArcNet speed, and although slower than ethernet, is less than half the
cost.

The AmigaLink software has GUI tools for Workbench control of Import &
Export functions, network Statistics & Diagnostics tools for testing and
troubleshooting both hardware & software, while a Printer Spooler program
allows for network printer sharing.  It's SANA-II compatibility allows
other software to be run concurrently such as AmiTCP, providing great
flexibility when networking various Amiga's together.  A new revised
English manual is included.

Amiga Envoy is the standard Amiga peer-to-peer networking software that was
developed by Commodore's Amiga Networking Group.  Its performance,
user-interface and API are consistent with the philosophy of the Amiga
Operating System.  Amiga Envoy provides a simple messaging interface for
the easy development of reliable network applications.  Included
applications enable connected Amiga computers to share their hard disks,
CD-ROMs, and printers transparently.  Third-party applications can also
provide extra functionality such as electronic mail, remote computer
access, multi-user databases and multi-player games.

New features for Envoy 2.0 include support of AmigaOS 2.04 DOS packet types
(including notification and record locking), support for removable media,
enhanced reliability & robust recovery, localization, AmigaGuide
documentation, and more.

MSRP for the basic 2 unit package is $299.00 US, or $379.00 CAN.
Expansion kits, cable options and accesories are also available.

@toc NEWS

TITLE

    fMSX Amiga 0.6

AUTHOR

    Hans Guijt (h.guijt@inter.nl.net)

DESCRIPTION

fMSX Amiga emulates an MSX computer on an Amiga.  This version finally
includes disk support, which means that it is suitable for several jobs:

- BASIC programming using the in-built MSX-BASIC.
- Doing serious work such as accounting or wordprocessing.
- Playing games.

Software is not included with the package, but many packages (mostly games)
can be found on FTP sites:

    ftp.saitama-u.ac.jp			/pub/msx/
    stargate.imagine.com		/pub/MSX/
    ftp.funet.fi				/pub/msx/
    riaph.irkutsk.su			/pub/

Currently some 147 ROMs, 10 MegaROMs, and over 200 disk-based games have
been or will be uploaded!

Of course fMSX Amiga is fully multitasking, runs in an intuition screen,
and has a font-sensitive user interface.

NEW FEATURES

Drive support!  This means that you can now use disk-based games, or write
BASIC programs *and* save them before you turn off your computer!

Drive support requires some form of PC drive support on your Amiga.  The
logical choice would be CrossDos, but other solutions such as messydos are
also supported.  In addition, it is not necessary that the emulated drive
is actually a physical drive; it could just as well be a hardfile or a
RAD-like device.

Another new feature is support for using MegaROMs.  Although not many are
available right now these games are generally of higher quality than the
normal ROMs or the disk-based games.

The GUI was given a complete overhaul.  Many more preference options and
buttons are now available and are remembered between sessions.

The highspeed mode is more robust, although it is not yet perfect.

Of course the customary speedup was also done.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

Required are:

- Amiga OS 3.0
- 68020 processor
- 400 kilobytes chip ram
- 700 kilobytes other ram

Recommended:

- 68030 processor, at least 25MHz
- Those 700 kilobytes of 'other' ram had better be fast ram!

Note that fMSX Amiga does *not* require the AGA chipset.  In fact, it
should run on any chipset upto and including graphics cards, although this
has not been tested.

AVAILABILITY

fMSX Amiga 0.6 is available from any aminet site, such as:

ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/misc/emu/fmsx_0.6.lha (114682)

PRICE

It's absolutely free. 'Gratis en voor niets' as the Dutch say ;-)

DISTRIBUTABILITY

fMSX Amiga 0.6 is publically supported freeware.  If you are interested in
the source, and you're not afraid of function pointers and huge amounts of
assembly intermixed with C, you can request it from me.

If someone wants to do a special version (and I can think of several
possibilities, such as a version that uses the MMU for optimized Z80
emulation, or a version that runs on a Cybergraphics card), contact me.

I am posting this for a friend (contact information below);I know this is a
long shot, but if never hurts to ask--

Wanted: 12 Commodore Amiga A1200 Computers
        Any Hewlett Packard DeskJet 560C Printers

Inner-City Arts is a non-profit arts organization which offers visual and
performing arts classes to the under-served, ethnically diverse elementary
school children who reside in the area of downtown Los Angeles known as
"skid row."

The mission of Inner-City Arts is to keep the spark of creativity alive in
young children facing extremely difficulat circumstances while building
self-esteem and connections between art, school, family and community.

On September 22, 1995, Inner-City Arts will hold an arts festival to
introduce 150 new children to its facility.  As part of this Festival For
Youth, we would like to offer computer design experiences.  We are looking
for a donation of 12 Commodore Amiga computers and printers to be used at
the Inner-City Arts Center on September 22nd.  Any permanent donation is
tax-deductible, and will go directly to our budding media center where

TITLE

  ShapeShifter

VERSION

  3.1

AUTHOR

  Christian Bauer

  EMail: bauec002@goofy.zdv.uni-mainz.de
  SMail: Christian Bauer, Langenaustr.65, 56070 Koblenz, Germany

DESCRIPTION

ShapeShifter is a multitasking shareware Macintosh-II emulator for the
Amiga computer.  It allows to run Macintosh software concurrently to Amiga
applications without hardware add-ons or modifications.

Some of the emulation's features:

 - Color display up to 256 colors on AGA Amigas (16 colors on ECS)
   and up to 16,7 million colors on graphics cards
 - No MMU required, even runs on A1200
 - Macintosh hard disks can be simulated in Amiga files or Amiga
   hard disk partitions
   [unregistered version has no hard disk partition support]
 - Can use Amiga floppy drives, serial, parallel and SCSI ports
   from the Mac
   [use of SCSI not possible in unregistered version]
 - Mac HD disks can be read directly with an HD floppy drive,
   Mac 720K disks can be used with any Amiga floppy drive. To use
   Mac 800K disks, you have to own CrossMAC and an original Mac
   drive
 - Multichannel sound output and parallel-port sound digitizers
   supported
 - Access to Ethernet networks
 - Text clipboard sharing between Mac and Amiga
 - File handler to access Macintosh volumes from the Workbench
 - Speed comparable to a real Mac with equivalent hardware

The most important changes in V3.1:

 - The SCSI routines have been completely rewritten. If you continue
   to encounter incompatibilities with certain SCSI devices, it's
   most probably a hardware or driver problem.
 - AppleScript runs
 - EtherTalk is fully supported
 - ShapeShifter can now use external video drivers. To make a start,
   a "Retina Z3" driver is being supplied.
 - The graphics refresh in Amiga Bitplanes modes is faster.
 - "MacMem" is now integrated into "PrepareEmul".
 - DeviceDisks can now be used with removable media.
 - The 68060 FPU is recognized correctly
 - The "ShapeShifter PRAM" file format has changed. But a file in
   the old format is recognized automatically and converted on the
   next shutdown.
 - Those who own "CrossDOS" or "CrossMAC" and a Macintosh 800K disk
   drive supported by CrossMAC can read and write Macintosh 800K DD
   disks with ShapeShifter (truly spoken, this always worked with
   ShapeShifter). AMAX and Emplant formatted 800K disks can also be
   accessed, then.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

OS2.1, 68020 processor, 4MB of RAM, HD floppy drive recommended.  A copy of
a Macintosh 512K or 1MB ROM and the Macintosh system software are not
included, but required.  The ROM can be read off of a real Mac by using a
supplied program, the system software can be bought from Apple.  Note,
however, that reading the ROM is only legal if you have bought the ROMs or
own a real Macintosh.

"The spoken word applies"

Speech Petro Tyschtschenko

We are pleased to be here in the UK, one of our most important markets, to
have the opportunity to talk directly to the Amiga press.  We will talk to
our dealers and the developers tomorrow.  We know that this press meeting
should have taken place earlier.  Please understand that we were very busy.
We have set up the operations and the material for production.  During this
time, we have achieved many things.  Let's talk about this now.

Some of you surely know how long and difficult the takeover of Commodore
was and how much this one year of latency hurt the Amiga market.  Building
up everything again was also a difficult task for us.  Especially the
financial and logistic situation.  Without the support from our
mothercompany ESCOM AG, nothing would have been possible.  We actually
revived the Amiga in two important steps: First by acquiring the assets of
the former Commodore for more than 10 million Dollars secondly by starting
it up again, which requested again several times the initial investment. 
Other main difficulties we encountered were to get specific parts and
components for production.  D-RAMs are on allocation, Amiga keyboards,
floppies and SCSI harddrives have long lead times.  Tailor made parts are
difficult to get and they cost more than in the old Commodore times.

Our first objective was to get Amiga products back on the market as fast as
possible.  To achieve this goal in an acceptable time, we decided to build
the A1200 and A4000T without modifications.  We have however included the
new version 3.1 of the Operating System for the A1200.

Ladies and Gentlemen, please be aware that the A4000T allready is a
complete new product.  There have only been produced 200 units worldwide by
former Commodore.  There will not be modifications on the casing for this
year.  The design proposals that were presented in Frankfurt are only a
possibility for the models coming later.  Please be aware : If we had
decided to make enhancements immediately, there wouldn't have been machines
on the market for the Christmas season.  This decision does not mean in any
way that we are going to stop research and development.  Enhancements will
be made on current machines for sure.  I'll talk about this again later.

But now I would like to present you the actual status of our operations.

We are a german company located in Bensheim, 30 miles south of Frankfurt. 
Our production, assembling and material providers are located in Europe but
the world is our market.  Our team has grown tremendously to reach 39
people since May 31st, with the new addition of Virtual Products.

We are a flexible, agressive, motivated, transparent and dynamic team.  We
can react very quickly to new situations, we take our strategic decisions
faster than the competition does.

What is our team doing on distribution ?

Distribution

John Smith already told you about the UK distribution.  One piece of
information you will surely be interested in is that ESCOM shops will carry
Amiga Computers in the United Kingdom.

The employees in these shops used to sell Amigas and we want to use their
store traffic again.  This will be an excellent additional sales tool to
spread Amigas in the UK.

We will also support the Amiga dealers who have the best knowledge of the
platform and who can provide excellent service to customers.

Distribution outside the UK.

The Sino market, which includes mainland China, Hong-Kong, Macao and Taiwan
is covered by our chinese joint-venture.

In North America, we already have installed a dealer network but are still
looking for a potential distributor.  Somebody who is willing to support
and invest in our product.  We are actually looking for a partner more than
just a distributor.

Production

GOOD NEWS : We are still on schedule to produce Amigas for availability in
September.

And even better news, we will have a real european manufactured product.

The Amiga 1200 will be produced in Bordeaux, France.  Our successful
negotiations with Solectron, one of the world leader of sub-contract
manufacturing, guarantees a european high quality standard.  Quality is
very important for us, we want to reduce defective returns to a minimum.
That's why we focused on Europe rather than far-east.

The Amiga 4000T motherboards will be produced in the United States, near
Philadelphia.  The units for Europe will then be assembled in the ESCOM
facilities in Germany.  The american units will be assembled in
Philadelphia.

We have made an agreement with a european monitor manufacturer.  He will
provide a monitor especially adapted to be used with the Amiga.  The
monitor is a high-quality multisync monitor that can scan horizontal
frequencies from 15 to 38 KiloHertz.  The plug of that monitor is also
adapted to the video output connector of the A1200 and A4000T.  I think
this is exactly what is needed for all Amiga resolutions.

As announced at our previous press conference, our plan is still to build
100 K A1200's and 20 K A4000T's until the end of this year.  These figures
are based on existing orders and on customer based forecasts.  I'm quite
sure that this gives us the assurance that the whole production will
actually be sold.  A large percentage of our A1200 production will be sold
alone in the UK.

Servicing

The repair and spare servicing will be centralized in our service-centre in
Braunschweig, Germany, in coordination with the representation points in
each country.  The technical dealer support will also be handled here, as
well as the distribution for computers and monitors in Germany.

Our service plan is very simple : we don't repair, we only make components
exchanges.

Future plans, developments

As I promised before, I will now tell you about our future plans for
research & development.

First, we plan to enhance current models.  We are thinking of faster
processors and chip integration for the beginning.  We are going to
integrate the 68060 chip for the A4000T this year.  For the entry-level
model, we are looking at an external CD ROM addition and more RAM onboard
the bare units.

We are also planning to use the CD 32 concept for developments of
set-top-box systems.  The set-top-boxes will open new markets for Amiga
products.  Set-top-Boxes could be produced in variants for cable-TV,
satellite-TV and for telephone line communication and also be used for
home-shopping and home-banking.  I'm convinced that this market is
tremendous and will push the Amiga technology into millions of households.
Software publishers should be interested in writing software for such a
widely spread platform.  The Amiga architecture is optimaly suited for
set-top-systems because of its low demand for ressources like RAM or
processor power and because of its multitasking and realtime abilities, in
summmary, the Amiga is the most cost effective platform for set-top-boxes.


It is still under investigation which RISC platform will be used as basis
for the Amiga of the future.  At this point, we cannot say more about this
issue, thank you for your understanding.

IFA Berlin

From the 26th of August to the 3rd of September, we will be present
at the IFA, one of the biggest consumer fairs in Germany for TV,
communications and multimedia. 500 000 visitors are expected this year and
we use the occasion to make our comeback with the Amiga in Europe. Virtual
Products I-Glasses and Commodore will also be presented to our visitors.
May I point out that the Amiga version of the I-Glasses will be much
cheaper than the PC version because it doesn't require the VGA-to-composite
conversion box, since the Amiga 1200 already has a composite output.

Ladies an gentleman, I hope this event was informative and I hope inspiring
for you.  We are now at your disposition if there are any questions you
would like to ask us.  Thank You for your attention.

Amiga Technologies
Speech by John Smith


I Would like to add my welcome to everyone here today which of course is
the first public conference in the UK.

For those of you who possibly do not know me I am John Smith and I have
been appointed the UK Sales Manager for Amiga Technologies UK.

I was previously with Commodore for 7 years, the last 2_ years of them as
National Sales Manager.

You will observe from the Agenda that I will explain briefly about the
product we will be selling and through which channels we will be selling
them..

I am obviously biased towards the Amiga - very happy to be selling it
again, and look forward to It's re-emergence and it gaining the recognition
it richly deserves.

However, I am fortunate in being able to sell other products along side the
Amiga that come from both inside and outside the Commodore branding.

The first of these, which is outside the Commodore brand, is Virtual
Reality product in the form of I-Glasses.  There will be two versions
available.  The first we can term the video version.  This type will work
with anything that has a composite video output - so it will obviously work
with Amiga but also Sega Saturn, Sony Playstation - your VHS video player
etc.

They act as a personal display screen and display the image equivalent to
that of an 80" screen in which you can be totally immersed.  In fact your
very own cinema!  You can see your games in 2D or 3D with games that have
support for I Glasses .  Films like Tommy from the WHO are currently being
produced especially in this 3D format.

The second version, the PC version has the additional head tracking system
with it and will therefore display not only in 3D but will allow you to
immerse yourself in your own virtual world.  It also gives surround sound
and these glasses weigh from only 8oz in total.  Very light and have been
ergonomically designed with members from the university of Edinburgh to
help avoid eye strain etc.  They are the only glasses we know of in fact
that are designed with spectacle wearers in mind.

The pack will come complete with games and be available during September.

We have Denis Premiski of Virtual Products with us today who will explain
more about the product and prospective market for I Glasses shortly.  Under
the Commodore Brand we will have available MS DOS PCs.  There will be an
initial special limited offering of a Pentium 60 mini tower multimedia at a
very competitive price.  It will come complete with Hard Drive, CD ROM, 8
megabytes of memory and software.

We will then launch the Commodore Golf series.  "GOLF" is a name that is
understood throughout Europe so we feel is a very acceptable name.  Our
minimum entry level will be the Pentium 75 and again will be a full
multimedia product including a quad CD ROM drive- sound card etc.  There
will also be a Pentium 100 version.  This product has been designed
exclusively for Commodore by Frog design and will be of top quality and
build.

It will be supported with 12 months on site warranty.

There will also be a full compliment of Commodore branded peripherals like
quad speed CD drives - loud speakers -mice etc.  all colourfully packed and
competitively priced.

Back to Amigas

I will have available an excellent Amiga 1200 pack with software for the
end of September as the entry level machine and also a higher but very
competitively priced 170MB hard disk drive pack.

It will include productivity software like Database -Spreadsheet- Word
processing package- Paint package and games.

We will of course box it in our usual eye catching manner.

There will be the Amiga 4000/040 pack with a 1 Gigabyte hard drive and 6
megabytes of memory and later, during November a 4000/060 pack.  Top
quality software again will be included.

All Amigas will have the latest version of the operating system,version
3.1, which has been optimised to improve system performance.

I will also have a new Amiga multisync monitor that vertically scans from
15 to 38 Khz which will avail itself to all Amigas from A500 upwards that
have a RGB port..

Where will I sell them?

These products have various routes to market not least being through the
independent via the distributor.

Whilst we still have to dot Is and cross the T's we will have 2
distributors this side of Christmas .  Negotiations are almost complete. 
Looking to 1996 I propose one or possibly even up to two more distributors
around the main Christmas period.  These distributors obviously will
support the full range of our products and be cognisant of the Independents
requirements.  A higher percentage of the product available this Christmas
will go through the Independent channel.  As again we maintain support for
the loyalty they have shown throughout the ten years of Amiga.

It is my responsibility to sell our products here in the UK and also in
Australia, India, Malta and Israel.

High Street

The High street is of course also important to aiding our success and once
again we are very close to finalising contracts but expect to see our
product there through people like Comet and Tandy.  The high street has
changed somewhat since Amigas were last freely available because we do not
have Rumbelows anymore and have seen them replaced by Escom stores who
specialise in PC's and communication products.  It is envisaged that they
will sell our Amiga brand.

VAR

Value added resellers who specialise in the Audio visual arena and who give
us access to TV production companies and other niche markets are obviously
important for the Amiga 4000 product.  We will look to top companies like
Premier Vision, Scala, Pentre Technologies etc.  to fulfil this sector of
the market.

Corporates

The corporate sector is an area that will be looked at with regards to MS
DOS product.  Personally, I only had a small contact with the PC arena
during my time at Commodore and I am of course aware of how quickly this
changes especially as Commodore has not sold PC's for over 3 years.  This
market will be addressed and we will probably look towards some kind of
joint support with the VAR,S to take this sector in hand.

We have already sold the majority of our production, it is now a question
of allocation and that transfers the pressure back to Petro.  Please ensure
we get all our product and importantly when we want it.

To summarise - Amiga is back, along with other new exciting products
available from the end of September.  We look forward to the Xmas period
and believe that between all of us we can make it a pleasurable and
profitable market once again.

On behalf of Amiga Technologies UK, Thank you for your attention!

AMIGA TECHNOLOGIES UK

Amiga Technologies at the IFA fair in Berlin

Bensheim, 15/08/95

From the 26th of August to the 3rd of September 1995, Amiga Technologies,
together with Virtual Products and Commodore, will be represented by a
booth (hall 26.A, booth 11) at the "Internationale Funkausstellung" (IFA)
fair in Berlin.  This will be the first time since the liquidation of
Commodore that Amigas will be presented officially to the public at a fair.

The Amiga 1200 and Amiga 4000T as well as the CD32 products will be
displayed in different configurations and running several applications. 
Amiga Technologies will be happy to accomodate third party developpers and
manufacturers at its booth to show the wide range of professional solutions
available for the Amiga computer.

The Amiga 1200 is the entry-level computer of the Amiga productline.  It
features 2 Megabyte of RAM, within which the Amiga operating System fully
multitasks.  The smart design of this computer allows animations and sound
in a perfect quality at a price never seen before.  Another advantage of
the Amiga 1200 is its expandability.  The user can gradually upgrade to
faster processors, more memory or larger harddrives.  The software bundle
included provides standard software needed for most tasks like Multimedia,
Wordprocessing, Spreadsheet, database and even the game players haven't
been forgotten with two excellent entertainment titles.

The Amiga 4000 T is the high-end model of the Amiga Line.  It features 6
megabytes of Memory with can be expanded to 18 megabytes onboard with
standard SIMMs and more using expansion cards.  It is fitted with a 540 Mb
or 1 Gb SCSI harddrive and has six 32 bit Expansion slots, inlined with
four ISA and two video slots.  Thanks to the wide choice of expansion cards
available on the market like 64 bit graphic boards, emulation boards,
multi-serial expansions or MPEG boards, the possibilities of the Amiga 4000
T are nearly unlimited.  The onboard SCSI interface allows the use of
popular standard SCSI devices like streamers, scanners, CD-ROM drives etc.
There is also a processor slot that can hold CPU accelerator cards for more
powerful processors like the new Motorola 68060.  Such a processor card
will be available for the Amiga 4000 T in November 1995.  The SCALA
multimedia authoring software will be shipped with every Amiga 4000T.
Together with this software, the Amiga 4000 T enables the user to do
professional multimedia presentations out of the box.

The CD 32 console, based on the AMIGA 1200 technology, is fitted with a
double-speed CD ROM drive.  The storage capacity of this media, combined to
the graphics and sound abilities of the Amiga gives an unmatched quality
for games and multimedia applications.

Product Announcement: Cloanto Personal Suite
Quality Amiga CD-ROM

This CD-ROM includes Personal Paint and Personal Write from Cloanto, SBase
4 Personal (from Oxxi), Personal Fonts Maker 1 & 2 (Cloanto), 27
professional Kara color fonts (Kara Computer Graphics), Cloanto's DirDiff
(file synchronization and replication software) and PNG Toolkit, plus 1/2
Gbyte of pictures, animations, stereograms, stereogram animations, Amiga
fonts, printer downloadable fonts and texts.

This is one of the first "different" Amiga CD-ROMs.  The Personal Suite
CD-ROM contains no public domain or shareware software.  Everything is
high-quality.  Our goal was not to fill a CD-ROM, but to find some of the
best in different fields, with a preference for material not available on
other Amiga CD-ROMs.  The commercial titles are the latest versions
available, with full AmigaGuide manuals (English and German, with some
titles also in Italian and French).

The capacity of the CD-ROM made it possible to include an enhanced version
of Personal Paint with extended documentation.  Famous Amiga artists like
Jim Sachs and Karl Bihlmeier participated with a selection of their best
Amiga art.  Also included, a compilation of animations by Eric Schwartz,
for the first time in IFF ANIM format.  More people contributed to put
together more quality material than could be named here.

The CD-ROM is packaged in an elegant metal box.

The Personal Suite CD-ROM is scheduled for shipping on September 15, 1995.

@toc NEWS

Sep 1, 1995 --- Soft-Logik Publishing

Digita and Soft-Logik are pleased to announce that Digita software
applications have been selected by Amiga Technologies to be bundled with
new Amiga computers.  The bundle will include special new versions of
Wordworth, Datastore and Organizer.

Wordworth is the best-selling Amiga word processor in history and will help
increase excitement about Amiga computers.  The version to be included is
Wordworth 4.0 SE and is exclusive to the Amiga computer bundle; it will not
be sold in stores.

Datastore is Digita's new personal database, first introduced in the autumn
of 1994.  Organizer is a new personal information manager (PIM) that was
released in the spring of 1995.

The inclusion of these programs with new Amiga computers demonstrates that
Amiga Technologies is serious about productivity software.  With over
100,000 people destined to receive copies of Wordworth, Datastore and
Organizer with their new Amiga computers this Christmas season, Digita's
programs will continue to be among the most popular Amiga application
titles.

@node NEWS13 "TekMagic Takes Over GVP Products"
@toc NEWS

GVP's decline was no secret.  Over the past couple of years, phone support
vanished, product releases became erratic and the rumors of GVP's demise
circled wildly.

Finally, GVP held a "going out of business" sale, auctioning off its
product line to the highest bidder-specifically, M-Tec of Germany.

After months of preparation, the "New GVP", TekMagic, has resurfaced in
Pennsylvania and has picked up where GVP left off.

M-Tec management at TekMagic informed AR that new product would go into
production in September and October, starting with GVP SIMMs and 1200/4000
accelerators, along with the G-Lock and DSS-8 sound sampler.

On the drawing board is a new 030 accelerator for the Amiga 2000 with
72-pin standard SIMM memory.  Also planned is a refit of the A530
accelerator.

TekMagic also expects to re-manufacture the TBC+, EGS Spectrum, I/O
Expander and 4008 SCSI card.

TekMagic can be reached at (610) 522-9350 voice, (610) 522-9354 fax.

@node FEATURE1 "DirOpus 5 Survey"
@toc FEATURE

===========================================================================
                        DIRECTORY OPUS 5  -  SURVEY
===========================================================================

Part One - Should I fill this in?

If you feel you have anything valid to say about Directory Opus, please
complete this survey.  The survey is open to people regardless of whether
they currently own the program - we are as interested in gaining new users
as pleasing the current ones.  The only requirement is that you are
_constructive_ with your ideas and critisism.  Apart from that, _all_
responses will be considered and discussed.

Please send all completed replies to

        E-Mail: <d5survey@hampschl.demon.co.uk>

Part Two - Purpose.

1. To gather information about what people want to be added and changed in
   the next update of Directory Opus.
2. To find out if there are any particular areas where people require help.
3. To destroy any misconceptions which people have about the new versions
   of Directory Opus.


Part Three - The Organizer.

The survey is being carried out by me, Leo Davidson, with the help of
various other people involved with DOpus.  For what it's worth, I am
conducting the survey as an independent, but with the suppport and
authorisation of GPSoftware.  My motivation for carrying out this survey is
the improvement of a program which I use and love.  The results of the
survey will go back to GPSoftware as input for the next version of DOpus,
but if you want to remain anonymous, I will respect your wish.

If you have something negative to say about DOpus or GPSoftware, go ahead
and say it.  I won't personally be offended, although I may turn around and
explain why I feel what you've said isn't valid, if I feel that is the
case.  If what you say is valid, perhaps it will result in things changing
for the better.

We're not asking for your opinions with the expectation that they are all
good ones!

If you would like to contact me, you can do so via:

        E-Mail: Leo Davidson <leo@hampschl.demon.co.uk>
        IRChat: "Nudel" in "#Amiga" on Effnet and Undernet.

Please send all completed replies to

@node FEATURE2 "DirOpus 5 Conference"
@toc FEATURE

===========================================================================
                        DIRECTORY OPUS 5  -  CONFERENCE
===========================================================================

In late August, Amiga Report Magazine held an IRC conference with Jon
Potter, author of the DirOpus 5 directory utility package. 

This transcript is Copyright 1995 Amiga Report Magazine and may not be
reprinted without permission.

(After introductory notes, Jon was asked to make an opening statement.)

jonp: Only that all questions have to include their 19 character serial
  number :) And hey, thanks for coming, you wild and wacky bunch :) Oh
  yeah, Nudel has a survey for everyone to fill out too For constructive
  criticism.

[The survey is available in this AR as well. -Jason]

HammerD: two questions: 1) Did you add lister backdrop pattern ability yet?
  :) and 2) is there a limit to the size of the lister icons?  the stock
  ones look terribly small on gfx card screens...

jonp: 1) yes :) and 2) in 5.11 there's a 64x64 pixel limit, which will be
  gone or at least raised in the next version

HeadQuake: Is there any chance of InterNet FTP support in/from DirOpus ?
  (FTP command with server choice, UL/DL buttons.  ((a TCP/IP version of
  Dopus maybe..  so I can DL gif pics and view 'em direct..  :) ))

jonp: There is an Opus FTP module available now on aminet (in /biz/diropus
  or /biz/dopus or whatever it's called)

Tau: OpusFTP.lha comm/tcp 94K 1 An FTP Module for Directory Op

jonp: This is a freeware "demo" of the full-blown FTP module which will be
  part of the Opus 5.2 upgrade It supports pretty much all you'd want an
  FTP module to support, and doesn't even need its own buttons to run it
  (the standard Copy/Delete/etc buttons work fine) As far as any further
  Internet support goes, we're open to suggestions...

NAN: Maybe this question is a little early but: You have strong views on
  piracy.  How do you as a developer feel with the piracy still going on
  and the current situation of the Amiga market?  Is Opus directly affected
  by this?

jonp: Opus is badly affected by piracy but I think that's true of any
  software.  Piracy is inevitable, but it's too easy to get complacent
  about it.  It's wrong and there's no other way to look at it.  In the
  case of the Amiga I think people who pirate are particularly stupid.  The
  computer is barely hanging on by its teeth as it is; if it wasn't for the
  developers keeping it alive it'd be bye bye baby.

ElViSp: jonp two questions....Is the Dopus 5 survey on aminet official, asI
  have lots of things to say about dopus5.11 and speaking of registration
  codes...how do you feel about the registration code generator found on
  several bbs's ??

jonp: The survey is officially "approved and supported" :) Talk to nudel
  for more information about it, but we're interested in any comments you
  have As far as the registration code generator goes, see my answer to the
  previous question.

MrX: Are you planning on releasing an updated version of Mouse Bounce :) -
  What other major new features will be implemented into 5.2?  and are you
  dedicated to the platform?

jonp: rofl :) Yeah Mouse Bounce 95 will be out soon :) 5.2 will be a fairly
  substantial upgrade

Nudel: Survey answers will be put into an AMigaguide for Jon + beta testers
  to look over and read, however anyone who doesn't want to be named won't
  be.  So call it semi-official :)

jonp: The major features are too numerous to list and also we're not sure
  exactly what they'll be yet.  But for example, there's the FTP module,
  and there's changes to the program to make things like the FTP module,
  LHADir, etc easier to write and use

MrDaniel: When will the next version be out?  And whats new in it?  (I'm
  assuming there will be a next version...  ;) ) How many copies of DOpus5
  have you sold so far?

jonp: 5.2 will be released probably at the Cologne show in November.  Other
  changes include GUI improvements (borderless button banks with alternate
  images for the Toolmanger freaks :) lister backdrop patterns arexx
  changes..  basically most things people have been complaining about and
  the occasional bug fix here and there :)

HammerD: Are you working on a HOT-JAVA web browser that could be launched
  from dir opus?  :-)

jonp: no comment :) but I will say that if I were, it could certainly be
  launched from dir opus :)

HeadQuake: Have you had any contacts with Amiga-Tech?  How do you like
  their "plans" for the Amiga _computer_?  Also, will DirOpus come on
  CD-ROM anytime soon?  (I'm much more intelligent than HammerD..  right? 
  :)

jonp: We've had some contact with AmigaTech recently, specifically the
  English branch.  They seem to be just like Commodore were :) I doubt
  DirOpus will come on CD..  it's not big enough to warrant it, despite
  what some people might say..  and not that many Amiga owners have CDs
  yet.  And I'm sure you're much more intelligent than HammerD :)

Nudel: BURRITO-Opus is almost finished.  But don't tell anyone, it's top
  secret and the launch will be bigger than Win'95.

JigSawMan: I do not have version 5, but am considering upgrading from
  version 4.  What is the "replacement" of workbench feature I've heard
  about?  What further capabilities does this add instead of just running
  along with workbench?

jonp: Opus could always replace Workbench if you were so inclined..  by
  that I mean it could always do everything Workbench did.  However the
  main thing about Opus 5 as far as Workbench replacement goes is the
  ability to display icons.  You can make it look almost exactly like
  Workbench if you like.

jcompton: Except the About window is much more interesting.

jonp: And if you do, there's certainly no need to run Workbench as well.
  Hence, it's replaced.  It's a lot better than Workbench too :)

MisterX_: Just 1 question.  Considering the huge user base of the PC, are u
  considering a PC version of DirOpus?

jonp: We are..  and have been for ages.  I actually got halfway through a
  version of Opus 4 for Windows a couple of years ago, but I didn't like
  the way it was going..  and Inovatronics had some problems at that stage
  (and since then :) But I wouldn't be too surprised to see an Opus for
  Win95 pop-up in the future.  Opus96 maybe :)

MrDaniel: Will the next version support CyberGraphX?  (Picture viewers,
  anim players etc...) (Btw..  I also much more intelligent than HammerD.;)

jonp: Frankly I doubt it.  I'm sure there are plenty of viewers and players
  out there for CyberGfx already, what would the point be in reinventing
  the wheel?  It's impossible to support every graphics system..  although
  CyberGfx does seem to be somewhat of a standard But it's ridiculously
  easy to configure Opus to use external viewers if that's what you want
  Opus does, at last, seem to work properly with CyberGfx btw :)

Long_Shot: Two Questions: Will the 5.2 update be distributed the same as
  the 5.11?  If a PC version comes out will there be cross platform
  upgrades?

jonp: At this stage 5.2 will be a pay-for upgrade, but won't be too
  expensive.  The other question is a marketing one, and Greg's not here at
  the moment.  :)

Aesculape: Jon, you mentioned the ability of DirOpus5 to display icons as a
  Workbench replacement.  Does DirOpus 5 work with NewIcons icon images? 
  Also, with DirOpus4, when you display an icon image, the NewIcon image
  displays, but the colors are wrong.  Has this been fixed.

jonp: NewIcons is somewhat of a kludge system and I'm not at all surprised
  that it doesn't work with Opus 4.  As far as Opus 5 goes..  when it first
  came out, everyone who used NewIcons complained that it didn't work with
  Opus 5 Now the complaints seem to have stopped..  so I'm assuming that it
  does work now :) But I don't use NewIcons and never have..  maybe someone
  else here knows more about this?  The only real problem with NewIcons is
  the palette If you're running Opus5 on the Workbench screen there
  shouldn't be any problem

Nudel: Apparently, NewIcons do work for the Lister ToolBar icons.

Troels: Jon, have you seen DirMaster for OS/2? :-)

jonp: No I haven't.  I've heard that it's almost a direct Opus 4
  conversion..  I'd like to see it.  I think it's a bit rude of the author
  not to send me a copy actually.

AdamH2: Thanks for your support of Amijam.  Is there an upgrade policy for
  people who bought the cover disk version of DirOpus 4 (as was indicated?)

jonp: AFAIK the coverdisk upgrade offer is valid indefinitely..  I can't
  remember what the price was, and I think you would have to go through the
  distributors in England

Nudel: It was around 35 pounds when I upgraded from the cover disk in the UK

Tau: if you "replace WB" with DirOpus, what happens to workbench.library? 
  aka.  AppIcons and AppWindows, and WBInfo()?  Does SwazInfo work together
  with DO5?

jonp: workbench.library is in ROM so it doesn't go anywhere..  Opus
  intercepts all the AddAppXXX() calls and emulates them, so you don't
  notice any difference.  SwazInfo works fine apparently though it doesn't
  trap Opus' own Icon information requester..  yet..  but I did give the
  info to swaz and he said he'd do something about that.

amigaman: if and when you make the jump to the pc do you plan to continue
  to support the amiga..  and what kind of future do you think the amiga
  has..  thanks ..  also opus 5 is very good work and thanks for the
  program support..

jonp: I'll probably support the amiga for as long as the platform is viable
  Or until I take up gardening :)

Nudel: ...or POTTERy... :)

Tau: the question was how long you consider Amiga viable ;)

jonp: As far as a future goes, frankly I don't think it looks very good.
  Escom would have to do something really radical to prolong its life much
  further, and they don't seem to be.  They seem like Commodore all over
  again.  But it might be too early to judge, I'm keeping an open mind. As
  long as I can afford to run my motorbike on Opus sales I'll consider it
  viable :)

Long_Shot: Comment: DOpus 5 did not start working with NewIcons, we just
  gave up.  Question: Will we ever be able to edit and use more than 16
  colors?

jonp: re: NewIcons..  I'll look at it before 5.2 is released..  I'm just
  loathe to install it since it's impossible to get rid of it again
  afterwards.  I would follow your question up with : Do you really need to
  use more than 16 colours?  :) You can have the screen with as many
  colours as you like, but why would you need more than 16 for Opus itself?
  well, image buttons aren't limited in colour :)

Tau: jonp, actually, it's not.  it's just a program after all, you don't
  have to copy the (sucky) icons over your old ones.

Nudel: LockColors etc can be used to set all the other pens, if you need it
  for any reason.

MrDaniel: Do you laugh or cry when you use FileManager in Windows?  Is it
  possible to run Dopus5 on the Workbench screen?  Is it possible to open a
  24-bit CGfx DOpus screen?

jonp: I don't use FileManager in Windows :) But seriously..  FileManager is
  ok for what it does..  it was never meant to be very powerful, and it
  does that very well.  The Win95 explorer isn't much better btw

Nudel: It does not being very powerful very well.

jonp: DOpus5 runs fine on the Workbench screen, I'm doing it at the
  moment..  it's actually designed to work that way (though you don't have
  to).

Tau: agreed, filemanager definitely does stand in your way in a very
  effective manner

jonp: I don't think it would be possible to open a 24 bit screen for Opus
  but if your Workbench screen is 24 bit there's no reason it wouldn't work
  on that (that I know of)

moster: Compliments for a great piece of programming - My question: Have
  you tried to include a particular feature in OPus5 but which you had to
  give up ?  If so - What?

jonp: There's lots of things I'd have loved to have put in Opus5 Time was
  the main problem..  things like LHA support should really have been
  built-in, but there just wasn't the time for it.  Although I specifically
  try NOT to build too much into Opus..  people complain that it's too big
  already.  They'd prefer to have an external 50k program instead of an
  extra 10k in the main program :)

Tau: how about supporting the ObjectArchive concept?

jonp: Tau: whassat? :)

Tau: ObjectArchive.lha  util/arc    48K  31 Access archives (lha, tar...)

JohnG: Can Opus be the next OS for PowerPC Amiga or other platforms (as
  HRP)?

jonp: Opus isn't an OS by any means, it's just an app..  there's no reason
  why it couldn't be the next Workbench though

AdamH: This is more GPSoft than DirOpus <g> but do you know if Greg is ever
  going to release the long awaited GPFax update?

jonp: He'd love to..  I've seen it and it's pretty hot Unfortunately Opus
  is taking too much time at the moment But look for it early next year if
  not by Christmas this year

ash: Is there an DOpus5 specific FTP site in the works?  There was one
  mentioned awhile ago.  And have you had to upgrade your number plates?
  :) GA.

jonp: I've actually got a site running now, but it's on such a slow link
  that I haven't told anyone about it You can check out the dopus home page
  at http://birch.apana.org.au/ though if you like :) And no, I haven't
  upgraded the number plates :) There's also a mailing list btw, if you
  want to subscribe to it send mail to majordomo@birch.apana.org.au and put
  "subscribe dopus5" in the message body.

wmaddock: I know this isn't about Dopus, but there have been some
  questioons about Timm Martin, Author of SID.  For those that are
  interested, do you know anything official about his status?

jonp: I don't, know..  I've never had any sort of contact with him at all.
  He was always sick though and I heard a rumour that he'd died, but it
  might have been just a rumour.  I hope he's still out there, the Amiga
  needs all the developers it can get...

amac: Jon, have you considered being able to print buttons/functions with
  ASCII text?  This would allow people to put functions and buttons in mail
  messages and the like.

jonp: I have actually..  the never-released Opus 4.5 had the ability to do
  that.  It might make it back into 5.2 actually..  I'll put it on my list

Nudel: The button files are small enough to UUEncode into a message without
  any problems.

jonp: Yes but for publishing in magazines or something, it wouldn't hurt...

Intex: Have you been considering allowing the use of more than one user
  menu (similar to 4) - and is there anyway for dopus to search for for
  what toolsmenu/appicon are present - on mine it only recognises additions
  to these after it has ran

jonp: Opus 5.2 will most likely have multiple configurable menus, I'm not
  quite sure about this though It's impossible for Opus to find out what
  AppThings were added before it is run..  Workbench doesn't make that
  information publically available So the only way to get hold of it is to
  patch the library functions and grab it on the way in If you don't want
  to run Opus all the time you can still get it to work by doing a "loadlib
  dopus5.library" in your user-startup Since it's the library that actually
  handles that stuff

_Bernie: I heard that DOpus5 misses some useful features of version 4.  It
  acquired many new options, but it lost some other.  is this true?

jonp: It lost a few, but I question how useful they were..  and one thing
  it lost (SoundTracker support) is back now (against my better judgement)
  There were a few useful things that have gone back in for 5.2 though..
  it was more a question of me forgetting to put them in rather than
  deliberately leaving them out :)

BuZz: trivial question. but how big is the source code for dopus. :)

jonp: the main program is about 1.5 megs, libray is about 500k and the
  modules are mostly around the 30-40k mark

Jkay: I'm curious about your link with Inovatronics ...  are you the SOLE
  owner/marketter of Opus now?

jonp: I always was the sole owner of Opus..  the copyright is now held
  jointly by me and GP [as in GPFax] Software.  Inovatronics were only ever
  the publisher, they never had any rights to it

Nudel: MWB_DOpus_7.lha will be on aminet soon, and it'll have new ARexx
  scipts, some assembler semi-modules (WinCopy commands and stuff) as well
  as all the icons.

Josef: Sorry if this was already asked, but do you plan on implementing any
  sort of TCP/IP related utilities directly into DOpus (for DCC, FTP, etc,)
  besides the arexx scripts?

jonp: There is an FTP module on aminet, ask Nudel for more information

amac: A nice question for the Amiga Report.  Where should
  suggestions/requests for features be sent.  I've emailed you directly
  before, but should it go to Greg, now?

jonp: It's best to mail Greg directly (zzgperry@mailbox.uq.oz.au)..  or
  subscribe to the mailing list (majordomo@birch.apana.org.au) and post
  them there..  but direct to Greg is best

Nudel: Or send your ideas in with the survey.

@node FEATURE3 "Amiga Convention '95 Show Report"
@toc FEATURE

In mid-August, Amiga Convention '95 was held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
Hundreds of Amiga users came from all over Canada and the US to gather for
great Amiga deals and the chance to meet other Amiga users and luminaries.

The two-day event was anchored by Canadian dealer/distributor Wonder
Computers, who occupied one of the short sides of the rectangular show
floor.  Along the long wall were various dealers and manufacturers,
including Oby's Amigo Computing Shop, Pre'Spect Technologies, National
Amiga, GfxBase, and AsimWare Innoventions.  Phantom Development occupied a
table more centrally in the room, and IAM had their section in the Wonder
display.

The organizers put much of the focus of the show's organization into a
competition for demos, music, graphics and 3D objects.  While I was unable
to attend any of the competitions, the organizers plan to release the
winning entries to Aminet shortly.

Speakers gave presentations to the crowd as well.  Dale Larson gave a
lengthy keynote speech in a tuxedo and sneakers, sharing his outlook on the
Amiga market including sketchy details of his interview with ISE, the
company contracted to do Amiga development for Amiga Technologies.

I gave an even longer (nearly an hour and a half) talk on emulators,
featuring the game Giana Sisters for the Frodo C-64 emulator.  Nearly
everything went smoothly, a welcome change of pace.

Al Mackey, Amiga artist, gave a stunning presentation with Brilliance.
Within 5 minutes, Al created a cartoon-quality character.  After that, the
audience was stunned into silence.

The International Amiga Society project, outlined in AR 3.15's feature
M-PLAN, held a small IRC conference with a short list of invited Amiga
users including Dave Haynie, as well as an assembly of AC '95 attendees, in
an international attempt to drum up support for the Amiga marketing
paradigm outlined by Giorgio Gomelsky.

Nearly every presenter there had an eye-catching display or two.  Wonder's
sheer volume as well as the V-Lab Motion display set up by Rick Sulpizio,
Canadian distributor, drew attention.  In addition, Dale Larson and myself
set up shop behind the Wonder tables to sign autographs.  Phantom
Development kept busy showing off the demo of Hell Pigs, a new
action-adventure game designed by Classica, roughly authored in the
Sierra/LucasArts style.  In addition, "release version, non-boxed" copies
of the editor Digital Quill were available for sale.  Oby's sold a number
of copies of Gloom thanks to their networked game setup where passerby
could blow blood and guts all over the floor.  AsimWare's Paul Reeves
played a seemingly endless round of Super Stardust CD32 on an A4000 to
demonstrate the CD32 emulation of AsimCDFS 3.x to shoppers.  National Amiga
had the distinction of being the only dealer with the foresight to have a
catalog onhand, as well as being the only dealer with an online HTML
catalog available to attendees thanks to the two A1200s on their table.  In
addition, some attendees brought systems that got notice, namely John
Paden's A3000, which sported a CyberVision card.

Peter Cherna, former Commodore OS engineer and presently employed in PC
development at Scala showed up for the final hours of Amiga Convention.
After Dave Haynie's videotaped greeting to the crowd in which he outlined
his "must-do" list for a new Amiga line, Cherna, Dale Larson, myself, and
Greg Scott from National Amiga participated in a panel discussion.  The
bulk of the questions were directed at Larson and Cherna as ex-Commodore
employees, asking questions about the future relevant to developments of
the past (such as OS upgrades and development).  Needless to say, Greg and
I got annoyed in a good-humored sort of way.

Attendance was paid and, as such, measured exactly.  The final turnout
numbers were not pleasing to the show organizers, who blamed a lethargic
marketplace.  However, since the attendance almost certainly was less than
AmiJAM '95, a show in a smaller marketplace that had better promotion, the
answer is more likely to rest in the work done to bring in users.

Still, the end result was that a lot of dealers and users went home
happy-and that's what bringing the Amiga community together is all about.

===========================================================================
                            REVIEW: IMAGEFX 2.1
  By Bohus Blahut                           bohuslav.bohut@mail.colum.edu
===========================================================================

Recently, registered owners of ImageFX 2 (IFX) received a free upgrade to
2.1.  It introduced significant enhancements to an already superlative
image processing program.  Adding to the numerous image compositors already
in the original release are "softlight" and "hardlight" compositing, also
support for Cybergraphics, Retina, Video Toaster, HPScanjet, and Primera
printers.  To me the most important addition is CineMatte.  This is IFX's
intelligent blue screen compositor.

For the uninitiated, image processing programs specialize in manipulating
imagery; be it drawn, scanned, rendered, or grabbed from video.  For the
Amiga/DraCo, there are several such programs, but IFX stands out in several
ways.

First, ImageFX is one of the most capable paint programs on the Amiga.  I
use IFX with an OpalVision 24-bit display card which has its own paint
program, OpalPaint.  Though OpalPaint is a longtime favorite of mine, I
find IFX's paint abilities to be so flexible and the results so beautiful,
It's often the only thing that I use.

Another essential IFX feature is its regional processing feature.  You
create a shape that acts as a stencil for processing effects.  If you
wanted to tint a person in a picture blue, you'd simply freehand draw a
shape around the person in the picture, then hit the Balance key and crank
up the blue.

All image processing (IP) softwares perform certain essential functions
i.e.  gamma correction, sharpening, cropping, scaling etc.  They also
convert pictures from one format to another, usefull for porting your work
over to other platforms.

An important IFX ability that is unfortunately rare in other programs is
macro recording.  You simply record your mouseclicks, and your actions
become a macrofile.  For those uncomfortable with Arexx, this is a real
timesaver.  If you perform a function twice, it's worth creating a macro. 

You can apply these macros and other included scripts, onto moving images
using AutoFX.  AutoFX is simpler to use than IMP, IFX's previous batch
processor.  You select groups of images, create a list of scripts to
execute, and off you go.  While IFX's effects are impressive on a still
picture, wait till you see them in motion!

What distinguishes one IP software over another is its special effects, and
IFX has some beauties.  IFX 2 brought in dazzling effects like lens
reflections, emulation of painting styles, lightning, textures, ripples...
The list goes on.  All of these effects have several configurable
parameters eliminating that "signature" look.  In a program like Lightwave,
you can no longer use lens reflec- tions without giving away that you used
Lightwave.  IFX allows you to build your own reflections, and other
effects.  IFX even includes a simple to use morphing program at no extra
charge.  All of these elements make IFX a necessary addi- tion to you video
arsenal, especially since the introduction of CineMatte.

A year ago, I was assistant director and visual effects supervisor on a
film called Hollow.  We shot several blue screen scenes of a female
hologram.  We wanted her to be composited (combined) over a background and
the effect called for the actress to be transparent and ripple a little
bit. 

Using Vlab Motion, I recorded both the blue screen and the background
elements, and saved them onto my hard drive as Jpeg fields.  I spent the
next nine months doing the compositing with varying degrees of success. 
The prob- lem is that when the computer does blue screen compositing, it
wants a specific color value to key out.  Since this was a real world blue
screen, a whole range of blues needed to be keyed out.  While the IP
softwares allow you to specify a certain variance off of your original
color, once I got the variance up high enough to eliminate all of the blue,
parts of the actress would key out too.  I thought that the answer was in
using an alpha channel, but the formation of al- phas from this particular
video just wasn't precise enough. 

Enter CineMatte!  Designed specifically for Blue and Green screen
compositing, CineMatte is "intelligent" enough to examine a picture and
decide what's blue or green and key it out.  It's so simple!  This is what
computers are supposed to do...  make our lives easier.  CineMatte can also
save out alpha channels to use elswhere.  I will likely use this feature in
the final itineration of this effect.  By outputting alpha channels and
convolve blurring them in IFX, when I composite the pictures they'll have a
cool blue fuzzy edge.

If you'd like to see what this effect ended up looking like before
tweaking, see the Vlab Motion demo video.  There are several other
excellent examples of what ImageFX can do to video.  With its macro
recording capability, my film and video life has gotten a little simpler
and automatic.  If only I could get IFX to drive out and shoot videos for
me.

@node REVIEW2 "Review: On the Ball" 
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                            REVIEW: ON THE BALL
                          By: @{" Katherine Nelson " link KATIE}
===========================================================================

On the Ball is a great personal information manager from Oregon Research
that can be found for about $35US.  Its many features include a calendar, an
appointment manager, a To Do list, an address book, and a notepad.

The Calendar:
------------

The calendar can be viewed either by the week, month, or year.  On the week
view, all appointments are shown within their time slots.  On the month
view, the text "name" of the appointments are shown on the appropriate
days, and on the year view, all dates that have appointments are
highlighted.

While not in use, On the Ball appears as a small calendar on the Workbench
screen.  This calendar shows the current month, with appointment days
highlighted.  The current time also shows at the top of the calendar, and
the current day is also shown.  Clicking on this calendar brings up either
the appointment manager, the To Do list, the address book, or the notepad,
according to whichever was viewed last.  If the appointment manager
appears, it will flip to the current date.

All the pens used in the calendar and other windows are selectable from the
current Workbench colors, allowing one to customize On the Ball to taste,
which is a nice feature.

The Appointment Manager:
-----------------------

The appointment manager allows one to add, update, delete, or search for an
entry.  The entries consist of a text "name", the start and end times, the
repeat types, and the reminder.

The repeat types are quite versatile, with options such as "No Repeat",
"Daily", "Every Four Weeks", and several in between.  Also, the appoinment
can repeat on forever with one of the patterns, or only a specified number
of times.

As stated above, the appoinments are shown on the calendar.  They can be
printed out in any of the calendar views using the small "P" button on the
right side of the window frame on the calendar view.  Using print from the
appointment window will only allow one to print the appointments that are
selected, and one can only select appointments that appear on the same day.

A nice feature that could be improved is "tagging".  It allows one to
catagorize appointments, and view either all appointments, only untagged
appointments, appointments with a specific tag, or specific tagged
appointments and untagged appointments.  Noticeably lacking is the ability
to view items from 2 tags or more without viewing all.  The only way I've
been able to view items from 2 different tags is to create a third tag, and
copy all appointments from the first two tags, and tag them with the third
tag.  This is time-consuming and inconvenient, but hopefully the problem
won't crop up often, or perhaps future versions of On the Ball will allow
multi-tag viewing, or the ability to put more than one tag per item, rather
than having two copies of the information.

Finally, a reminder is available that can be set to appear on the Workbench
at a specified number of days/minutes before the actual appointment.  The
reminder has a "snooze" capability, for those who are too busy (or too
lazy) to acknowledge it the first time around.

The Address Book:
----------------

The address book has all the standard fields (with Country), plus the
ability to have up to 20 phone numbers.  With fax machines and beepers
becoming more and more common, this is a nice feature.  Internet addresses
can also be stored there, provided they have 24 characters or less.

Tagging is also available here, which allows one to separate business
contacts from friends and family.  Again, the tag viewing problem makes it
difficult to see all people except those belonging to a specific catagory.
But again, hopefully future versions will take care of this problem.

A "note" can be attached to any entry.  The window for entering the note
has all the same features as the notepad, as mentioned below.

Sorting can be done on any of the fields, so if one wants to see only the
people with addresses in Sweden, it is an easy thing to accomplish.

The print feature has many options, including the ability to create mailing
labels, or simply print a table of addresses.  In either case, one can
select the fields to be printed from a list of those available.

The Notepad:
-----------

The notepad has much the same format as the To Do list, with searching and
the same method of printing.

Other than that, it's a notepad.  The notepad has all the expected
functions.  It even has find/replace capability, which is nice, but
probably unnecessary.

The To Do List:
--------------

The To Do list is much more simple than the appointment manager, but this
is to be expected.  The window has a list of "To Do"s according to due date
to scroll through, or to search.  (There is also an option for no due
date).

While a reminder and a repeat function are not available, tagging is,
allowing one again to separate personal from business.  These can be viewed
in the same tag combinations as the appointments.

Printing is available, but only through the To Do window, by selecting the
items to print.  A calendar option is not available.  Something I would
like in future versions is the ability to print the appointments and the
"To Do"s on the same calendar.  I would like to have to only look in one
place for my schedule and such.

Overall:
-------

Oregon Research states in the manual that they are in the process of "a
major upgrade to both the program and the documentation." Hopefully, the
new version will include the features I have listed above as "missing". 
Unfortunately, no date was given for the expected release of the newer
version.

This is a great package for the money.  It is much cheaper than its
counterparts for the Mac and PC, and while it may not look as "slick", it
is still quite attractive and certainly useful.

@node REVIEW3 "Review: Brilliance: Real Time Solutions Tutorial Tapes"

===========================================================================
          REVIEW: BRILLIANCE: REAL TIME SOLUTIONS TUTORIAL TAPES
               By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON} and @{" Katherine Nelson " link KATIE}
===========================================================================

Back in 1993, Horizon West Productions came up with a 3-hour video tape
series dedicated to Brilliance-specifically, demonstrating its ease of use
and power in specific, real-world areas such as logo creation and
animation.  Each tape is roughly one hour in length, designed and presented
by Larry Shultz.

Aside from a short introductory and concluding segment where Shultz
addresses the viewer, the screen constantly displays Brilliance as it is
being used, uninterrupted except for a few instances when the film is
edited ahead to avoid such annoyances as the rendering of 150 frames of
animation.

The tapes are not beginner-level material and presume a certain familiarity
and comfort level with Brilliance.  The issues being addressed are supposed
to be those of the video professional, trying to design and create projects
using Brilliance.

Tape 1
------

The first video focuses on two-dimensional static logo creation.  Shultz,
in real time (hence the name of the series) designs two logos-one, a
fictional corporate logo for "Scarab", consisting of a cleverly
color-filled flying beetle and appropriately nifty font and a fictional TV
news segment, "Health Beat" intro screen.  While it's clear that some
forethought has gone into each project (such as color selection for the
gradient fills), the end results clearly demonstrate that, with a steady
hand and some planning, very nice logos can be created in about 30 minutes.

Tape 2
------

The second tape revolves around animation-specifically, re-creating the
roughly 5-6 seconds of introductory animation shown at the beginning of
each tape, an effect involving a paintbrush that paints out the
"Brilliance" logo.

This tape, more than the first one, presumes some experience with computer
and Amiga animation.  Terms largely go unexplained and while the method is
clear, the individual mouseclicks go unexplained (for example, if you don't
know what "tweening" is and why he clicks "reset" before doing anything
else, too bad.)

The project is an excellent walkthrough to basic animation technique and
illusion with Brilliance, as the issue of synchronization and rotation are
discussed.

Tape 3
------

The final tape focuses on logo creation using nice fonts and Brilliance
effects ranging from the ridiculously simple (such as outlining a font in
a pink scale of increasing intensity to generate a neon effect) to rather
clever and complicated (such as using an arc-animation to generate a
reflective ripple effect without the aid of an image processing package.)

Most of the generated logos picked up some animation, creating a marriage
of sorts between the techniques learned in the first and second tapes.  The
explanation of the morph effect used on one logo was rather poor, but the
stencil effect and aforementioned ripple animation were well documented.

In Summary
----------

As a whole, the package definitely does the job of showing Brilliance in a
real-time problem-solving environment, with overall confident presentation
from Shultz.

Any artist confident with basic design and color techniques can probably
skip the first tape without missing much.  The second tape is an excellent
presentation, but unfortunately consists of a single project and really
needs the more applied uses in tape 3 to fully cover the animation angles.  
Tape 3 is the best of the bunch, getting right to the point and showing a
number of clever effects without delay.  Some are quite simple, but look
excellent on video.

Obviously, more work went into the projects shown on the tape than the 30
minutes they take on average to recreate for the viewer.  As an educational
tool on the package, however, the Real Time Solutions series does the job
quite well.  It does not present Brilliance as a cure-all graphical design
system, but does show you how to create a number of effective images
without leaving its confines.

For US$20 per tape (NTSC only), you'll have to make your own decision.
Tape 1 is an excellent introduction to basic design techniques, but not
everyone needs that.  For a complete primer on animation, 2+3 will do fine.
For a design and animation course, 1+3 will do the job.

                             By @{" William Near " link WILLIAM}
===========================================================================

SOFTWARE:  Final Writer 4

MANUFACTURER:  SoftWood Inc.
P.O. Box 50178
Phoenix, Arizona  85076
(800) 431-9151

DESCRIPTION:  Word processor/desktop publishing program

PURCHASED FROM:  SoftWood Inc.

PRICE:  I paid US$33 direct from SoftWood Inc.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Amiga running Workbench 2.x+, a hard drive and at
least 2.5 MB of RAM

SYSTEM TESTED ON: Amiga 2000 (Rev 4.4), ECS chip set, G-Force '030
accelerator @ 50 MHz., 2 MB CHIP + 8 MB FAST memory, Quantum LPS270S hard
drive with Trumpcard Professional controller, Picasso II RTG (2 MB)
graphics board, Workbench 3.1

PACKAGING: The box contained three floppy disks and a brand new Final
Writer 4 manual

INSTALLATION: The update to Final Writer 4 uses the Commodore Installer
program to create the new version of Final Writer on your hard drive.  This
makes the whole upgrade process simple and painless.

NOTE: I am only going to cover the differences between Final Writer 3 and 4
in this review.  It would make the review quite lengthy if I were to cover
every feature of the Final Writer program.

CHANGES: These are the major changes made to Final Writer 4:

* Movement within a document -- Page Click Tabs have been added to
represent the page numbers of your documents at the top of the document
window.  They look like those little tabs that you use in a filing cabinet
to separate folders.  If you have ever seen a Magic User Interface
application that uses this feature then you know what I mean.  By clicking
on any of the tabs you can move directly to any page within the current
document.  When the first row of page numbers reaches the right-hand side
of the screen, a second row is formed directly behind the first.  This is
an excellent addition to the program and it makes the process of jumping
between pages very quick and easy.

  Section Click Tabs have also been added at the bottom of the document
window to represent various sections of your document.  By clicking on any
of the various sections you can move directly to the corresponding part of
your document.

  In the new Information/Status Bar there are two sets of arrows.  The two
up arrows are used to move to the top of the document or up one page in the
document.  The two down arrows are used to move to the bottom of the
document or down one page in the document.

  Finally, you can just click on the page number display in the new
Information/Status Bar and manually enter a page number to jump to within
the requestor.

  Any of these movement features can be toggled on or off at anytime.

* Most of the menus and requestors have been rearranged to eliminate the
messy sub-menus that were present on previous versions of Final Writer.
All of the Preferences requestors are now in the form of Click Tabs.  This
is very intuitive and easy to use. 

* Information/Status Bar -- this bar, which can be toggled on and off,
appears at the bottom of the window.  It displays: line and character
position, page number, date, and time. 

  Clicking on the line or character position buttons will display the View
Preferences requestor.  Clicking on the date or time buttons will insert
the current date or time into the document at the current cursor position.

  The up/down arrows and the page number display were described earlier in
this review.

* User Button Strip -- this strip contains the usual icon representations
for the various actions that can be performed on a document.  Now this
strip can be placed at the top, bottom, left, or right edges of the
document.  By clicking on the Next User Button Strip icon, you can access
up to eight user-defined button strips located behind the main strip.

* Type attributes can now be set selectively instead of all at once as in
previous versions of Final Writer.  There are also plain, bold, italic, and
underline buttons on the User button Strip for easy text attribute changes.

* Grammar Correction -- finally Final Writer includes a grammar checker!  I
have been waiting for this feature since using Excellence!  in the past.
You can set the various rules that the grammar checker will adhere to, such
as: strict, business, and casual grammar rules; reporting consecutive
nouns, prepositional phrases, and split infinitives.  There are forty-six
different Rule Types that can be individually toggled on and off, such as:
spelling errors, capitalization errors, punctuation errors, double
negatives, etc.

  When a grammatical error occurs, a requestor containing two windows will
give a detailed explanation of the error and some suggested corrections for
that error. 

  The grammar checker in Final Writer 4 is quite powerful and it most
definitely puts other such programs to shame on the Amiga platform.  It is
an excellent addition to an otherwise fine product and it is also one of
the main reasons I upgraded from Final Writer 3.

* Document Readability (Statistics) -- this menu choice will analyze your
entire document and return statistics and a readability rating.  The
statistics include: paragraph, word and sentence counts, and noun/verb
groups.  The readability rating is provided in the following forms: Flesch
Reading Ease Score, Flesh Reading Ease Grade Level, Flesch-Kincaid Grade
Level, Coleman-Liau Grade Level, and Bormuth Grade Level.

     Just for curiosity, here are the ratings for this review:
          Flesch Reading Ease Score:          61.13 Standard
          Flesh Reading Ease Grade Level:     8.88 8th-9th Grade
          Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level:         8.68
          Coleman-Liau Grade Level:           11.76
          Bormuth Grade Level:                10.30

DISLIKES: When loading in old Final Writer documents the settings for the
3D look and the ruler on the left side of the document window seem to
disappear.  I wish there were a way to make these attributes take effect on
any imported document, instead of having to reset these attributes and then
save the document.

The printing is still slower than a slug and the whole machine drags when
loading in a document or the Final Writer 4 program itself.  The pulldown
menus consistently fail when using MagicMenu (PD), so I had to disable this
program before running Final Writer 4.  This could be caused by something
in the code for MagicMenu, but Final Writer 4 is the only program I own
that has this problem. 

The Type Layout requestor is awkward to use.  Most of the options remain
ghosted until you click on a check box at the right for that specific
attribute.  I find this to be quite annoying when trying to change a
certain attribute of the text in question.

SUMMARY: I like Final Writer 4 much more than any other Amiga word
processor that I have used in the past.  As in the past, all of your Final
Copy II and Final Writer documents will load into Final Writer 4 perfectly,
so there is no need to worry about loss of formatting, etc.  Final Writer
is still definitely one of the top two word processors for the Amiga and
it's still improving thanks to Softwood's dedication to their products.

===========================================================================

The Amiga has never really been a leader in desktop publishing.
Development has always been primarily focused on games, video, and lately
multimedia markets.  However, Stylus has come back with a redesigned
version of their product "ProVector" in the form of a productivity package.


The Stylus Pro-Pak actually consists of four distinct programs:

· ProVector 3.0
    The structured drawing program (certainly the focus of the package)

· StylusTracer
    Converts IFF ILBM and TIFF bitmaps to IFF-DR2D or Adobe Illustrator

· PSImport
    Imports and decomposes PostScript, EPS, and Adobe Illustrator EPS

· RexxRequest.
    An ARexx command host that gives gadtools.library functions to ARexx
    programmers


* Installation

The Stylus Pro-Pak uses the Standard Amiga Installer Utility and the
installation script is very well implemented.  In Expert mode (my preferred
mode), not only does it allow you to choose and verify what you want
installed, it will tell you exactly how much disk space the options will
take.  If you are not satisfied, you simply reselect what you want
installed.  There is no need to abort and start the whole process over
again as some other scripts would require.  You can keep altering your
choices until you finally decide what configuration will be acceptable.

The package comes with the manual for the 2.0/2.1 version of ProVector and
a very sharp context sensitive ProVector 3.0 on-line help system.  Given
the quality and extent of the included AmigaGuide based help files, I just
don't see much point in the manual.  Being able to position the pointer on
any given button/window, pressing help, and instantly getting such a
comprehensive on-line help makes the slightly dated manual a non-issue.


* StylusTracer

The included bitmap tracing utility, StylusTracer, is an extremely powerful
tracer.  Gold Disk's Trace program is an embarrassment by comparison. 
StylusTracer loads IFF ILBM (2-256 color, HAM, 24-bit) and TIFF bitmap
images.  The program worked on my CyberGraphX screenmodes in up to 256
colors, and surprised me when it even opened on an Amiga HAM6 screen (I'm
sure HAM8 is even better) StylusTracer supports dithering to increase the
number of apparent colors, and can use color or grayscale palettes.  If you
aren't doing color work, grayscale offers a very clean image, especially
with the AGA chip set.

There are a number of image processing features that help to convert any
given bitmap to a form conducive to tracing.  Conversion is available to
and from black & white, indexed color, grayscale, and full-color (24-bit).
Seven different smoothing options are there to tackle various image
problems: average, median, blur, gradient, region, minimum, and maximum. 
The program also offers a generous complement of image processing features:
posterize, remove isolated pixels (very nice before tracing a dirty scan),
sharpen, edge detect, thin, scale, invert, strip bits, brightness,
contrast, and gamma.  Having all these tools immediately available makes
the process of tracing much less painful.  Coupled with undo ;-), you can
really experiment with various options quickly.  Simple painting options
are also available including pixel by pixel editing at any magnification
level.  The program will save the image back out as an IFF file (so you
actually get a TIFF to IFF ILBM file format converter in the process).

The trace options allow you to specify precision, curve fitting, whether or
not you even want curves or just straight lines traced, and how you want
objects handled (with or without holes) and so on.  You can export traced
data as IFF DR2D, or Adobe Illustrator with or without a preview header.  I
had no problems using data exported to Adobe Illustrator format on various
Macintosh machines running the software.

If you are not satisfied with a trace, you can keep tweaking options and
retracing until you find settings suit the particular bitmap.  A logo is
probably going to demand significantly different settings than an
illustration.  Further, you can actually watch as it traces so you don't
have to wait out the entire process before you know whether the options
were adequate.

[Graphic card users should note that StylusTracer currently assumes that
256 color screens have an 8-bit per gun palette.  Most of the graphic cards
currently available for the Amiga only support 6-bits per gun, so opening
the program in 256 color grayscale causes a problem.  It won't dither the
colors (it thinks it has them all) and your granularity is high.  Reducing
the screen down to 64 colors will cause the effect to disappear since the
program will then be dealing with the actual grayscale the card produces
and dither appropriately]


* PSImport

PSImport is one of the included modules that is called from the ProVector 3
"Import »" menu.  ProVector scans the PV_Import directory for such external
modules and automatically adds them to the "Import »" menu upon loading.

Rather than loading EPS files and placing a bounding box or jagged bitmap
preview, Stylus has decided to provide a utility that actually attempts to
decompose the EPS (or PS) file into a usable vector drawing again.

There is a problem with this, however.  Some EPS files, especially those
created by Gold Disk programs, have some problems that cause PSImport to
choke.  In the case of these files, you can't even simply accept the
graphic as a bounding box to try its luck at running the file.

However, files from other sources generally ran very well.  One particular
advantage to this method is that all printers can use valid EPS clip art
with ProVector.  Normally, you can only use EPS clip art with PostScript
printers or with programs that interpret the PostScript to a form another
printer understands.  Even with programs that do this interpretation, they
do not allow editing or correcting such clip art in the process.


* RexxRequest

While other programs have their own solutions for implementing GUIs in
ARexx macros, the Stylus Pro-Pak gives the user a stand-alone host utility
that can be used for any ARexx macro.  It can even be used in place of the
customized systems that have generally been provided until this point.

An AmigaGuide database which is optimized for OS 3.x, but still runs with
AmigaGuide v37 (OS 2.x) is included.  Although it is primarily a quick
reference, the entire package comes with many ARexx macros.  Almost all of
the included ARexx macros provide extensive real world examples of how to
implement ARexx scripts using RexxRequest.


* ProVector 3

ProVector is a fast program.  Drawing, manipulating, and using the program
is a pleasing experience.  Since gradient fills can slow the process
(although no more than any other program doing gradients) they can be
turned off while still keeping full color fills and patterns available.
You aren't restricted to an "all or nothing" preview approach.  There are
four levels of preview: wireframe, color, pattern, and gradient.  Each one
adds to the previous level (for example, pattern does not forsake color).

At first the drawing method seemed quirky to me.  It is unlike Adobe
Illustrator, ProDraw, or most other drawing programs.  However, I picked up
on the process very quickly (within a few hours) and found it to be much
more natural and "organic" feeling than other programs.  ProVector3 is much
more suited to a traditional illustrator than a person who thinks in terms
of tangents and mathematical velocities of lines while designing.  In only
a few days I was getting better results, and in less time, using
ProVector's drawing tool compared to ProDraw's.  Going back to ProDraw is
like going back to pushing instead of driving.  It reminds me of the
transition to the "quirky" Amiga from the PC back in 1985.  Also, in
ProVector, you can press the backspace key to delete points in order from
latest to first if you make a mistake or would like to refine the drawing
without starting over again.  This is one of those "how did I ever live
without it?" features.

Along with the regular suite of drawing tools, ProVector has useful options
and constraints to the tools.  Circles and ellipses can be constrained to
specific slices, the rectangle tool has become the polygon tool.  You only
need to specify how many sides you want and it creates the polygon.  With
simple ARexx macros, you could create professional IFF DR2D charts and
graphs directly between the programs, and even time-based charts across
separate layers.

Some of the particularly useful features include an undo/redo of up to 256
levels, object zoom (which zooms in on a specific object), select NOT
(selects all those items not currently selected), custom crop mark
placement (not just 'on' or 'off'), and the special effects that can be
applied to objects.

The object manipulation options such as warp, skew, and other DO fold,
spindle and mutilate are particularly useful since they should you the
result as you work with the object.  Of course, with the undo/redo, even
this isn't "needed" but it's very nice to see the results before you
confirm the action.

Fonts can be changed after the fact (just select the text box and choose a
different font) and Adobe Type 1 fonts are directly supported.  Fonts can
specifically be marked on a per item basis for downloading.  This saves
memory and printing time if you do not need to download ALL your fonts
simply because you are using one that your printer doesn't have.

Gradients can have up to 65,536 colors per fill, not just two.  Further,
each color pair can have as many as 256 (non user defined) intermediate
colors to define the gradient.  Gradients can be filled as linear, conic,
radial, and bound to the shape of the object.  Transition speeds of the
gradient are even more flexible (fast, slow, constant, fast/slow,
slow/fast, etc.)

ProVector also supports layers, up to 256.  Each layer can be shown,
hidden, edited, and locked independently.  For large projects this is a
wonderful feature.  You can open many projects at the same time, memory
would seem to be the practical limitation here.  Professional 'musts' such
as color separation, under color removal, black generation, and per color
trapping are all available with ProVector.

Output options are available (and external, so more can be added) for
PostScript, Preferences (Printer), HPGL, Adobe Illustrator EPS, IFF ILBM
(2-256 colors and anti-aliased 24-bit).  The results have been excellent.

ARexx support for these programs is very strong.  I can see being able to
add 'tool palettes' very easily and naturally to the programs with
utilities such as ToolManager (Stefan Becker).

This isn't to say there aren't a few snags with ProVector.  There is no
'pasteboard' off the main page.  If you drag an item off to the side, it
will still exist, but you can't see it.  You can drag it back if you click
where you left it (or select all the objects on the page and then select
NOT and center) but I believe another solution would be easier and more
intuitive.

Tooltypes and many of the ARexx tools currently only deal in inches.  The
ARexx macros can be modified, but I think an all around improvement to
measurement context sensitivity would enhance the program.  If you are
someone who deals mostly with inches, you're okay.  I'm a pica person.  :-)
You can still use other systems, and modifying the commented ARexx macros
is certainly no difficult task, but the fact that tooltypes are inches only
is counter-intuitive.

Zoom mode leaves parts of the page undrawn that weren't specifically in the
Zoom box, even if they would fit in the window.  I see no reason why parts
of the pages that technically exist are not drawn in certain zoom
situations.  However, under normal circumstances, this behavior is not
often exhibited.

Finally, feeding the program corrupt or incorrectly written DR2D files
could cause some problems including crashes or strange behavior.  Handling
bad DR2D files should be as graceful as possible, because there is at least
one major Amiga DTP package still being developed that still writes bad
DR2D files.


* Conclusions

It's refreshing to see a capable, functioning, supported, professional
application like ProVector for the Amiga.  ProVector 3 is one of the few
Amiga programs that has been given the prefix 'Pro' that actually deserves
it.  It's a powerful structured drawing system with a strong suite of
utilities and an extensive ARexx facility.  Although the entire package is
close to the upgrade price for comparable packages on other platforms, it's
certainly in the same league.  Unfortunately, I've only been able to touch
on ProVector 3, a single review just doesn't do the product justice.

===========================================================================

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to listserv@itesmvf1.rzs.itesm.mx.

Your subject header will be ignored.  In the body of the message, enter

subscribe areport <your real name>

ie: 

subscribe areport A. R. Reader

The system will automatically pull your e-mail address from the message
header.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!             **

          *** The following is only for Australian readers!  ***

To circumvent the new pay-per-megabyte system for Australian Internet
communication, Paul Reece has been kind enough to set up an AUSTRALIAN-ONLY
mailing list, to save his fellow countrymen some money.

You can join the list by sending mail to:   majordomo@info.tas.gov.au

with the single line (in body of message):

Amiga Report will then be bounced to you.

==                        UUDecoding Amiga Report                        ==
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

==                    Amiga Report Writing Guidelines                    ==
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.  Please stipulate as
well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to the editor.

                The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
          -------------------------------------------------------

Portal is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-service online SIG
(Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users. We promise, and
WE DELIVER ongoing & aggressive Amiga support!

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in many ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA high-speed modems (you pay for the phone call
if it's not local), or though any SprintNet or Compu$erve indial anywhere
(with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell service!  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help, and you can easily customize
it for your favorite terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1000 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
      once, of any size, with one command.
 * Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, Elastic
      Reality (ASDG), Soft-Logik, Apex Publishing, and others.
 * 40 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 10,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.
 * Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
      related and get quick replies from the experts.
 * Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, AMosaic, LightWave, EGS,
      OpalVision & others feed right into the Zone message bases.  Read
      months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with them.
 * FREE unlimited Internet Email with 5 meg of free storage.
 * A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.
      You can run Amiga Mosaic through your shell and explore the
      vast World Wide Web!
 * Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which you can read
      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine.
 * Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
      never worry "Ooops... Am I paying for this area?" again!
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  And you get FREE unlimited
      usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
      email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
 * Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
      at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
