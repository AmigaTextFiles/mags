===========================================================================

Another issue of AR, and once again it is my lot to have to remind everyone
that as far as the Amiga acquisition goes, nothing worth mentioning has
happened yet.

So, life goes on.  I've been trying to relax lately by watching the
patterns generated by the MindEYE, the neat new device that is the
successor to the old MindLight.  The MindEYE takes the sound around it and
mathematically turns it into a limitless variety of visual displays--some
boring, some stunning.  It takes some playing around with the (very
powerful) software to get the hang of it, so that review will wait for a
later issue of AR.

Meanwhile, I'm off to Cologne, Germany, where I'll be at the Computer '96
show on Friday and Saturday, as the guest of Schatztruhe, the publisher of
the Aminet CD-ROM series and much more.  I know I'll be meeting a lot of
friends and readers there, and look forward to it a great deal.  It'll also
be a chance to have my first look in 11 months (since the WOA Toronto '95)
at Phase5's PowerPC technology, and my first-ever chance to see StormC in
action.

Before I let you loose on Amiga Report, I'd like to stop a moment to answer
a rather brutal attack on my person from Amiga Monitor, a new online
magazine.  While I have nothing personally against Amiga Monitor (I'm
happier when AR isn't the only major English-language online magazine) or
its editor and founder, Michael Webb (a nice individual who I met on a
CompuServe conference this summer), the magazine puts editorial stock in
one Samuel Ormes, a contributor to the magazine.

Mr.  Ormes, who many might remember from his "Sam Report"s, (most infamous
among them being the 1995 posting that positively stated that CEI had
completed the purchase of the Amiga from the Commodore bankruptcy), alleges
that I have, among other things, "sold my soul for a paycheck", in
reference to my consultant contract with VIScorp.

At first, I found the charge too outrageous to deserve comment.  But after
receiving some e-mails asking me to respond, I think I'd best get this over
with.

Since I first became a writer for Amiga Report in 1993, I've poured
countless hours of my life, at my own expense, into the Amiga, its
advocacy, and the support of its users, through Amiga Report and in other
forums.  No, that work has not been without its payoffs.  I have greatly
enjoyed the satisfaction I get when I know that tens of thousands around
the world are served by Amiga Report and its content, delivered more or
less promptly to them at no charge.  I like getting e-mail from people
thanking me for being a helpful resource.  I like being able to talk with
movers and shakers in the Amiga market to see where things are going--what
products are upcoming, who's working on new games, what hardware product is
going to be the talk of the town for the next few months.

And yes, I have enjoyed those times when I've been able to put my knowledge
and experience in the Amiga market to work for me.  In the past, I worked
for Wonder Computers Inc.  of Canada, and acted as a consultant for a law
firm pursuing a suit indirectly related to Commodore.  Presently, I act as
Communications Manager to VIScorp in preparation for the Amiga acquisition
the company is working on, and also handle elements of operation for a
video and 3D graphics firm.

I will make no apologies, to Mr.  Ormes or to anyone else, for any of this.
Personally, I feel great pride that my work on the Amiga has proven a
useful asset.  It makes claims that "The Amiga is dead" or "You can't make
money with an Amiga" seem that much more ridiculous.  As for somehow
abandoning or betraying people because I am gainfully employed as a direct
result of my Amiga knowledge, that is patently ridiculous.

When situations seem difficult, there are those who are willing to work
towards a better tomorrow, and then there are those who choose to blame
others for their misfortune and do nothing to improve their situation.  I
think my record as a servant to the Amiga community speaks for itself and
needs no further comment.

Thank you for bearing with me on this.  Enjoy the issue, and I'll see (some
of you) in Cologne.  Katherine Nelson and I will be in Toronto for the
World of Amiga 1996 in mid-December, so I hope to see my North American
friends and readers there as well.

-Jason

PS: Thanks to AmiCon for a great time at the Midwest Amiga Expo.  I
apologize for not having a show report for AR readers, but to be really
honest, I saw very little of the show as I spent almost the entire time in
conversations, answering questions and such.

Also, my apologies in general to those who have requested mailing list
changes lately.  It's been tough getting time to sit down and make the
needed alterations.  If you're looking to subscribe, the majordomo can do
it automatically.  Details are in the magazine, right @{" here. " link MAILLIST}

As a final note, yes, I DO plan to finish a number of the "multi-part"
reviews that I've left hanging up in the air.  On the list are Final Calc
and the Blizzard 1260.  All when time permits...

Subject: Apollo 1240 review

Hi Jason,

I want to thank you for your recent two-part review of the Apollo 1240
accelerator in Amiga Report.  Like many other Amiga owners, I'm in the
process now of assembling a powerful-enough system to tide me over until
Viscorp/Phase 5/Pios and the other players can produce the next generation
of Amiga computers.  I would never call myself a cutting-edge person, as I
seem to acquire a technology several years after it's been on the market. 
For instance, I am typing this letter right now on an Amiga 1000 with hard
drive, 2.1 operating system, and 4 megs of ram.  It's not spectacular, but
it gets me by.  But with the lack of Amiga research and development over
the last three years, when my new 1200 system is fully assembled, I will
have a nearly state-of-the-art Amiga!  I'm elated, but it's also a very
weird sensation.  I recently took advantage of the SAS Institute's SAS/C
"giveaway" and plan to throw my weight into the freeware/shareware arena as
soon as the system is assembled and I figure out how the compiler works. 
Every little bit helps, right?

Getting back to my reason for writing, as much as I liked your review, I
have still not completely decided which board to purchase.  I really *want*
an 040, and until recently figured Phase 5's new 1240 T/ERC would suit me.
Then I realized that when they say "tower", they mean they used an existing
motherboard, and the contraption is so big that it may only fit in a custom
expansion adapter like the one in Micronic's (sp?) 1200 expansion tower.  I
was hoping Phase 5 would have put all the large compo- nents on one side of
the board, so it would fit much better when I hack my 1200 motherboard into
a PC desktop case.  Mounting the motherboard on 1-inch standoffs isn't an
option, so I've gone back to the drawing board.  I'm looking for more
information on Apollo products, and maybe you or your readers can help?
For starters

1) Exactly who manufactures these boards?  Your board was supplied by
Datakompaniet in Norway, but reading their web page, they seem to be just
an Amiga distributor/vendor.  (My Norwegian is rusty ;-) Does the
manufacturer have an email address and/or web page?

2) Can you point me to any other reviews of the 1240 and it's SCSI adapter?
Some detailed information, especially on the speed and compati- bility of
the SCSI unit, would be welcome.  I'd be grateful if anyone could send me
photocopied reviews from Amazing Computing, UK Magazines, or even smaller
Amiga newsletters.

3) You mentioned in your review that the mouse pointer had a habit of
locking-up intermittently.  Since then, have you any idea if this fault was
limited to your test system, or if it's representative of all Apollo
1240's?  Have any other 1240 owners noticed compatibility problems?  Speci-
fically (and I get some of these questions from a nice Blizzard 1230 faq
;-), do software failures ever reset the clock?  (I assume it has a clock.)
Does it ever have problems accessing the hard drive (or the early startup
menus) after a warm boot or cold boot?  Is the processor socketed or
surface-mounted?  I assume the board takes advantage of all instruction and
data, burst and cache modes, and fast simms (60ns or better)?

4) One major concern is the lack of a disable option, but even though this
is not included, I wonder if it isn't possible in a crude way through some
combination of wires attached to a few lines on the expansion connector
that would simply disable autoconfig during a cold boot?  This is something
I would like to ask Apollo's engineering team.

If you or any of your readers can help me wrestle with these questions, I
would love to receive some email.  And if you have an Apollo product, how
about posting a review to comp.sys.amiga.reviews?  ;-)

Thanks,

Todd Oberly
taoberly@delphi.com


   I addressed Todd's issues in e-mail, but a few things bear mentioning.
   ACT, the Apollo series manufacturer, does not have any online contact
   points at present.  As to a crude disable--I'm not qualified to judge on
   that, but regardless, it's not the same thing if you have to hack it up.

Hi-

Just some food for thought:

Being a recent addition to the Amiga_on_the_Net Family, I have started to
discover that a rather annoyingly large proportion of new applications tend
to require MUI or similar interfaces.

Perhaps I am looking at things the wrong way, but surely one of the main
advantages the Amiga has over other (and I never type the names on MY
Amiga) types of computer is that the operating system is trim taut and
functionally terrific.

So why the trend to bog down the system with MUI type background apps?

If thats what you people want then go out and get [insert seven letter word
meaning a hole in wall to see through] and run it on one of those other
doorstop things!

So please all you developers/programmers out there, sure make your
applications MUI/whatever compatible, but please, please don't make it a
neccesity.

Jon..


   MUI is a big point of contention among a lot of Amiga users.  The fact
   is that a lot of applications these days are turning to third-party
   interface standards or "helpers", such as MUI and ClassAct.  Some regard
   MUI as one of the few things that keeps Amiga applications looking
   modern and attractive, others regard it as a scourge.  Personally, I've
   learned to live with MUI and appreciate that it does, indeed, make a lot
   of applications look better than their non-MUI contemporaries.  -Jason

up with the hassle of figuring out how many DM's are in a Canadian dollar
or mailing away a cheque.  The fact that's I have have bad experiences in
the past does not help either.  wouldn't it be nice to just TRADE programs
over the internet?"

  To clarify this...  say I develop a shareware game and decide that people
can register it for $20.  Later I download a game from the Aminet (written
by Bob) and I love the game, however, it's only the first level and Bob
wants $20 for me to register it.  But, say Bob has played my game and
really likes it and wants to register it as well.  Wouldn't it make more
sense for me to TRADE a registered version of my game for a resistered
version of his?  This way, no money would be involved and it all can be
done over the internet.  It would be EASY and SAFE.

  This is where ChequeMarcs come into play.  Jonathan Gapen wrote an
interesting article in Amiga Report talking about shareware developers
using E-Cash.  Well, let's forget regular money altogether and create
ChequeMarcs.  In the above situation, what if Bob loves my game but I don't
care for his?  The trading system won't work then.  If Bob wants to get a
registered copy of my game, he just pays me 20CM.  This 20CM now does me no
good in the REAL world but I could spend my 20CM on another shareware
program.  Or, I could save my 20CM and wait until someone else registers my
game so now I have 40CM and can now afford to register Fred's great new
utility (which costs 35CM).

  The great thing about this system is that involves no real money and
still stimulates shareware development.  After all, I'd be much more
willing to develop shareware programs for the Amiga if I knew that it would
give me credit to register some of my favorite shareware programs.

The Needs: (What do we need to start using ChequeMarcs?)

  First, we need a group of people to organize the project (I've come up
  with the general concept but I am FAR from qualified to work out all the
  tiny details myself).  This is my main focus for now.  If you want to
  volunteer please e-mail me at mpiva@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca

  We need to set up some sort of online bank to handle the "money" (and, of
  course, people experienced with security on the Internet to protect the
  "money" from hackers).

  Then we need to advertise ChequeMarcs to the Amiga shareware developers,
  convincing them of the benefits of using such a system.  Note to
  developers: I'm not asking you to ask for ChequeMarcs instead of regular
  money but use them as an alternative.

The Problems:

ChequeMarcs, like all innovative ideas, are not perfect right from the
start.  There are some obvious problems with my idea.  Some of these
problems include: if there aren't any ChequeMarcs in existence right now,
where will they come from.  If you earn ChequeMarcs by people registering
your programs, how do you earn ChequeMarcs if you're not a developer.  I am
aware of such problems but I believe the idea is still a good one and these
problems can be solved.  I already have a few ideas to solve some of the
problems but I would rather discuss such things with the Organizing Team
first.

Why "ChequeMarcs"

There's a few answers to that question.  Obviously "Cheques" and "Marcs"
are forms of money.  The term "Checkmark" has definite Amiga connotations.
So, I put them together and got "ChequeMarcs".  Also, I personally think
that "ChequeMarcs" is more of a creative name than something like "AmiCash"
or "AmiCredits" or something similar.

===========================================================================
                            Question of Support
  Robert Pigford                                       cyrano@goodnet.com
===========================================================================

Whom should I be supporting with my Amiga-stuff purchasing dollars: The
local shopkeeper or the advertisers and developers in the only remaining US
Amiga magazine (AC/Amiga)?

Both are important, of course.  Without the developers, one could argue
that there would be nothing for the local shop to sell.  And don't all
retail sales of things flow some money back to the developers?  In fact,
the money's already gone to the developer at that point; I buy product from
the dealer who got it from a distributor who got it from the
developer/manufacturer.  The developer's had his money for quite some time
once I take the product home.

But AC/Amiga is worth supporting, IMHO.  If we want a greater-than-48-page
issue again, there need to be more advertisers.  Even though most readers
buy the magazine for the editorial content, it's the ads that pay the
bills.  We, as Amiga users, need to be telling developers and manufacturers
that we saw their adverts in AC/Amiga, and back that up with hard dollar
purchases.

I recently pulled out all my old Amiga magazines.  I have Amiga World
running back to December, 1991, when I bought my first Amiga, an A2000HDP.
I have every AC's Tech ever published (and all the coverdisks).  I even
have the odd issue of .info and Amiga Video/Graphics lying about.  The
variety and content in those old magazines is amazing.  Many of the
techniques and ideas still have practical application today.  I read some
of the product announcements and beat my head against the wall that I
didn't buy them when I had the chance (of course, I didn't have the money
at the time...).

How many computer magazines can you say have information that's still
useful today?  The PCWorlds and whatnot are merely showcases of the latest
& greatest.  Rarely is there something to help you really get more
effective use out of your system.  The Amiga magazines, however, are chock
full of ideas and techniques and suggestions and methods -- all aimed at
making our favorite computer more friendly and/or useful.  That creativity
is what makes the Amiga community so powerful.  That power is why I still
have an Amiga and continue to spend money to upgrade it.  That's where the
value in an Amiga magazine is.  That's why I don't want to lose AC/Amiga.

So what am I doing about it?  Well, for starters, I'm stepping back through
my software and making sure I'm registered on all the shareware I actually
use; that will help the private developers.  I'm upgrading all my programs
to their latest versions (as much as possible, anyway); that will help the
commercial developers.

I've given myself a budget for Computer Stuff every week/month, which I
spend at my local Amiga shop (Wentek Computers in Scottsdale, Arizona,
(602)483-7200).  The proprietor, Rob Wendling, has always been friendly and
helpful to me, and he keeps stuff on the shelves to browse.  That's
important to me -- I like to browse and impulse buy once in a while.

I'm writing letters to the developers and manufacturers of all the stuff
I'm buying and using now, letting them know how I learned of their products
and that I want them to support AC/Amiga with advertising dollars; AC/Amiga
is my primary source of new Amiga-related information, and I turn there
first when looking for information on an upcoming intended purchase.

And finally, I'm trying to do something to help increase the volume of
editorial content in AC/Amiga by writing for them.  I've been cutting my
teeth by writing for the MECCA newsletter, and have some ideas to submit to
Don Hicks, managing Editor of AC/Amiga.  I've requested a copy of their
Writer's Guide, to prepare myself more fully.  I don't know if I'll
actually be published or not, but at least I'm trying.

Through it all, of course, I'm actively supporting my user's group (MECCA).
I participate in the regular meetings, and host a technical presentation
every so often.  I share my recent Amiga experiences (good and bad) with
the group.  I help others with their technical troubles.  I participate --
that's the key.  Many members are in fact active in several local clubs,
and I applaud them.

So I started this message with questions of 'whom do I support?'.  Funny
how the answer turns out to be myself.

By supporting all these organizations with my dollars and my energy, I help
sustain and improve the Amiga community and market.  It's a logical
economical cycle: When products in a given market sell well, more vendors
are enticed into that market.  The volume of available products goes up,
which gives me more options for my purchasing dollar.

It's a positive cycle, don't you think? 8^)
So what are you going to do?

Dear Amiga Community Member:

Please help us, we've been censored!  We at IAM are offering new low sale
prices on our Amiga products, but we are now even more dependent than ever
on word-of-mouth to help us sell them.  For the last six months, IAM has
been running a full-page advertisement in Amazing Computing, the last
general-interest Amiga print magazine left in North America.  Our ad gives
information on all of our products.  As of the December, 1996 issue, when
we were to announce a new product and major discounts on other products,
Amazing Computing will no longer allow us to pay to advertise our full
product line in their magazine.  Details of this story are available on our
Web site, but the most important issue for us is that we have to get the
word out about our new low sale prices. 

The Amiga community is too important to be torn apart by arguments or
grudges, or to be hampered by censorship.  We still ask our North American
customers to continue supporting Amazing Computing, just as we ask them to
support all Amiga publishers.  Call or write to Amazing Computing today.

TITLE

  Executive

VERSION

  2.00 (October 28, 1996)

AUTHOR

  Petri Nordlund (petrin@megabaud.fi)
  (http://www.megabaud.fi/~petrin/)

DESCRIPTION

  Executive brings real multitasking to AmigaOS. Executive is a
  UNIX-like process scheduler for Amiga. It also has plenty of
  other features previously available only in larger operating
  systems.

  Executive improves the responsiveness of your Amiga. One CPU
  intensive application no longer causes the whole system to crawl.
  You can start many CPU intensive applications and the system
  still feels as if it would be totally idle.

  The Executive package also includes many useful client programs
  that let you control tasks and monitor what is going on in your
  system.

  The core of Executive is a scheduler that recalculates task
  priorities based on system load average and task's recent CPU
  usage. The scheduler will give high priority to interactive
  tasks and low priority to CPU intensive tasks.

  Lets say you are printing a document from a word processor. You
  can't do much else while the document is being printed. This
  isn't multitasking. With Executive you could also do some heavy
  rendering and C-compiling in the background at the same time.
  You could surf the web with your favorite browser without even
  noticing all these programs running in the background.

  Executive consists of a server and clients. The server is run
  in the background and it takes care of scheduling, CPU usage
  calculations and many other things. Some important features of
  the server:

    - precise (1/1000 seconds) CPU usage timing
    - six different scheduling algorithms
    - load averages
    - process identifiers
    - process group identifiers
    - accounting
    - focus - task with active window gets more CPU time
    - MultiUser support

  The client programs are:

    Acct            Accounting daemon
    ALoad           Display load average or CPU usage
    ALoad3D         Display load averages in 3D
    Commander       General task manager
    Ctp             Extended ChangeTaskPri
    Dashboard       The mother of all meters
    Kill            Extended Break
    Lastcomm        List last commands executed
    Meter           Display system information
    Nice            Run programs with lower scheduling priority
    Ps              Process status displayer
    Pstree          Display child-parent relationships
    Renice          Renice a task
    Sa              Display accounting statistics
    Stat            Display some misc. information
    Timer           Time shell and Workbench programs
    Top             Display information about top CPU tasks
    Uptime          Display system uptime and load averages

  Executive is fully compatible with all Amiga computers running
  AmigaOS release 2.04 or newer.

  Executive is the highest rated item of shareware CU Amiga
  magazine has ever awarded at 98%.

NEW FEATURES

  - Schedulers have been improved and a real multi-level feedback
    queue scheduler, found on most UNIX systems, is now available.

  - New client, Dashboard, lets you open multiple windows and
    interactively create all kinds of meters on them and adjust
    their parameters. Everything is user configurable.

  - PatchControl and ScreenNotify support.

  - CPU usage can be displayed with Amiga's power LED.

  - The server and some clients are now commodities. Scheduling
    can be disabled and enabled without restarting the server.

  - ExecutiveAPI is a new low-level API for application programs
    that wish to directly control scheduling.

  - Tasks can now be scheduled as a group, if necessary.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  AmigaOS 2.04 or newer is required to run Executive.

AVAILABILITY

  Any Aminet site, for example:

  ftp://ftp.luth.se/pub/aminet/util/misc/Executive.lha

  Executive has a WWW-page which has links to several Aminet
  sites and also some nice screenshots. The URL of the page is:

  http://www.megabaud.fi/~petrin/Executive.html

PRICE

  The freely redistributable version doesn't lack any crucial
  features so it can be used without registering. Registered
  users get process accounting, ALoad3D and Meter clients and
  5 additional scheduling algorithms. Registration fee is $15
  and it's also accepted in many other currencies.

distribution without a license apparently is now impossible, unless it is
from a charitable institution.  Shareware software must have a license from
Unisys, and the software must include two limitations: 1) the GIF component
must not be usable until the software is registered and 2) the software
must kill itself after 30 days of unregistered use.  Both 1+2 are a

Convergence International                                     Press Release
11th November 1996                                                 CIPR-001

            New user group, Convergence International, is formed

A new user group for users of non-Wintel computers, has been recently
created.  Convergence International was formed with the intention of
bringing together the non-Wintel community to present a unified front to
face the Wintel threat, as well as looking to the future and supporting the
emerging Network Computer and Set Top Box technologies.

  Convergence International's main aims are to:

(a) Support users of non-Wintel computers
    By providing extensive technical information, advice on software and
    hardware, and helping new users, Convergence International will offer
    support for new and existing users of non-Wintel computers (including
    Acorn, Amiga, Apple, and PowerPC, please see below for a full list).

(b) Promote intercompatibility
    Convergence International aims to bring the minor computer companies
    together to fight the powerful market share of IBM compatibles,
    something which no small company can hope to take on alone.
    As part of this working together we believe these platforms need to
    be intercompatible, handling files from the other supported platforms,
    as well as recognising all major international standards. To help this
    cause Convergence International has a sub division, the Convergence
    International Development Group (CIDG), which will work on producing
    programmes simultaneously for supported platforms, as well as file
    format convertors, development tools, and other useful utilities.

(c) Highlight the strengths and successes of non-Wintel technology
    By providing information on supported platforms, Convergence
    International will create a reference for people looking to purchase
    a computer. We intend to produce a library of system set ups, detailing
    required hardware, software, and add ons, to perform a wide variety of
    tasks. Demonstrating to purchasers that non-Wintel technology can
    accomplish the end results they desire, often more efficiently and
    easily, will encourage users to switch from Wintel. After all, the
    majority of people are not interested in the type of computer they use
    as long as it does the job they bought it for.

Convergence International invites users of supported platforms, and people
interested in associated technology, to join the group.  Membership is

               (Draft - please see web site for latest version)

Below is a list of questions we are frequently asked by those who are new
to Convergence International.  If you have any questions that are not asked
below, feel free to contact us at convergence@rocket.demon.co.uk.

Why the name "Convergence"?
Why converge, then?
Why is Acorn always listed first?
How much does it cost to join Convergence?
What do I need to join Convergence?
What about your API I've heard mentioned?
Will Convergence work closely with the manufacturers of supported platforms?
I'm a dealer, why is Convergence of any interest to me?
I'm a manufacturer, what about me?
I'm a developer, what about me?
I'm a user, what about me?

Why the name "Convergence"?
---------------------------
Convergence symbolises the coming together of Acorn, Amiga, Apple, BeBox,
and other non-Wintel users, developers, manufacturers and dealers, under a
single banner.  Convergence hopes, that by uniting these groups of people,
and by helping each other, we will stabilise the non-Wintel market and
allow it to grow.

The name "Convergence" symbolises the coming together of the Acorn, Amiga,
Apple and BeBox operating systems under one hardware standard, the PowerPC
Platform.  The PowerPC Platform is a key part of Convergence's desktop
computer marketing strategy.

The name "Convergence" also symbolises the converging of household
appliances, namely the television, communications and cable industries
under the Set-Top-Box and Network Computer technologies of the future,
which will bring a new age of competition, in a brand new market.

Why converge, then?
-------------------
Convergence is necessary when you have a great force that is affecting many
smaller enemies.  In this case, the Wintel/Microsoft monopoly is having, in
our opinion, a pronounced effect on the rest of the computer industry that
is both damaging and unhealthy.  We must unite and stand together if we
hope to make the Wintel/Microsoft monopoly less pronounced, and their
competitors flourish.

Why is Acorn always listed first?
---------------------------------
This isn't intentional!  :) There was some debate in our early days what
order they should be listed in.  Eventually, we agreed alphabetically was
the best way, as then there is no bias.  Naturally, Acorn comes before
Amiga comes before Apple comes before Be, so Acorn, Amiga, Apple, Be is our
preferred order.

How much does it cost to join Convergence?
------------------------------------------
Nothing.  Convergence is a free to join user group.  Membership does not
commit you to anything, and how much is contributed is left up to the
individual members.

All we do ask (and this is by no means a requirement) is that you
contribute something to the group, by either joining in on one of regular
IRC conferences (channel #Converge on EFnet), participating in one of the
ongoing group user projects, help with development, or translate a portion
of our website into your language.

If you don't have enough time to contribute, then you can help simply by
displaying our banner (due soon) on your website with a link to our
website, or by advertising your membership to Convergence International
plus our webaddress on your E-Mail and News signatures.

What do I need to join Convergence?
-----------------------------------
Presently, you need an online connection via the Internet.  However,
support channels are being built up for BBSs (Support BBSs connected via
ConvergeNet network), plus recently renamed Convergence Report will be
distributed as widely as possible, and can be sent by post if you send a
disk and postage to us.  You can, of course, include submissions or work of
your own on this disk, to contribute to the group, and this would be highly
welcome.

What about your API I've heard mentioned?
-----------------------------------------
Presently, we are developing a multi-platform API system that will allow
developers to write their software and unleash it to a wide variety of
platforms simultaneously.  We are presently in negotiations with another
group to participate in the development of their own API, to avoid an
unhealthy split of two rival APIs.

The outcome of the negotiation will determine if we continue work on our
own version or co-operate with their own and share rights and
responsibilities equally between the two groups.  We will let you know the
outcome.

Will Convergence work closely with the manufacturers of supported platforms?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, yes.  We will monitor closely the activities of our supported
platforms, and do our best to help.  We hope to establish a healthy
dialogue and communications between Convergence and those manufacturers,
developers and dealers.

I'm a dealer, why is Convergence of any interest to me?
-------------------------------------------------------
Convergence understands that your profit margins for standard
IBM-compatible PCs are low and shrinking, and it's a cut-throat market.  We
realise you'd rather sell platforms with a higher margin, but are
frightened they won't sell and you shouldn't stock them.

Convergence is trying it's best to attract as much interest as possible to
these platforms, and to divert attention away from the more mainstream, low
margin, systems.

By supporting Convergence and seeing it is successful in it's aims, you are
helping to increase sales of non-Wintel computers, increasing your profit
margin and thus your profits.  Convergence will take care of the issues of
supporting the hardware and software, avoiding the users coming back to you
all the time and hogging down your support department (if you have one).

Please feel free to join Convergence, and display our banner on your
website.  Please help us help you!

All dealers who join are awarded the honorary Convergence Preferred Dealer
award.  We're working on a better name and logo right now.  We'll even
provide some support for you on the WWW if you don't have your own webspace
yet!

Of course, it's your job to keep up the support and respect the non-Wintel
platforms.  If we receive bad reports, you'll lose the award fairly
quickly.  If you work hard and keep up the support, you'll gain respect and
our support.

I'm a manufacturer, what about me?
----------------------------------
If you're a manufacturer, you already know how Convergence can be of help.
We are encouraging growth and competition in the industry, which will help
your product sell in higher volumes, rather than more common and mainstream
hardware and software.  This means increased sales and profits.

Again, please join and display our banner on your website.  We need you to
help us help you!

Convergence-joined manufacturers are Convergence Preferred Manufacturers
and get a free listing in our Manufacturers section (due soon).

I'm a developer, what about me?
-------------------------------
If you develop for one of the platforms for profit, you know your profit is
much lower than the mainstream alternatives.  You still do it, as you'll
know you'll enjoy it, and that those platforms deserve to succeed.

But your profit margins are shrinking.  You are faced with a dilemma now. 
You must switch.  Or do you?  With our multi-platform API, you will be able
to develop for all the non-Wintel machines simultanenously.  One
development group, one budget, multiple platforms.  This means a tremendous
boost in sales.

Now you have two options: earn a decent wage and still not support the
mainstream platform(s), or jump ship and help the monopoly which almost
crushed you before.

Help us help you, join and display our banner on your website, software
manuals, etc!  We'll make the rest easy.

And of course, you will be mentioned in our developers list as a
Convergence Preferred Developer!  We'll even take care of WWW support if
you don't have your own site yet.

I'm a user, what about me?
--------------------------
You are by far the most important of all categories!  You're the people,
the general public, who buy from those above.  You can make a tremendous
difference.  Keep supporting those who are supporting the non-Wintel
markets, YOUR markets.  They're helping you, so help them!

Unite together!  Stop attacking the Acorn, Amiga, Apple, Be - they're not
your enemies!  They're in as much trouble as your platform is.  Instead,
band together and help each other!  Remember who and what your mutual
threat is.  Support each other, support the non-Wintel platforms in MCIBTYC
(My Computer Is Better Than Your Computer) arguments, don't just boast your
own - support them all!

We must band together now and unite if we are to succeed.  Together we are
stronger and can do much more to avert the threat the Wintel monopoly is
posing to the computer market.  Analysts say it, the press say it, those
sueing Microsoft say it: the market needs competition in order to survive,
evolve and grow.

We need your help.  Please join us and help make it happen.  We're not in
this for money.  We're in this to help the users, developers, dealers and
manufacturers that depend on competition keep going.  We're thinking of the
workers, the employees, those whose lives may depend on the income from one
of the groups that are being cut back because of a fierce monopoly.

And if you are one of those we're helping.  If you work for one of those
developers, manufacturers (computers or peripherals), dealers or are a user
or business who depends on those developers, manufacturers and dealers,
them join with us and help us succeed!

                            Midwest Amiga Expo
  Pat Larkin                                    74246.1077@CompuServe.COM
===========================================================================

[Thanks to the Gateway Amiga Club for sharing this article with us.  The
GAC FLAK newsletter often reprints Amiga Report articles, so we're just
catching up. :) -Jason]

This is your far-flung correspondent reporting on the Midwest Amiga Expo
in metro Columbus, Ohio.  Seven of us from ASK gathered in the pre-dawn
gloom for the trip and finally got on the road about 8:30.  We pulled
into the parking lot of the Westerville South High School right at the
stroke of noon, only to find we had to walk all the way around the school
in the _very_ nippy wind -- we had caught up with the cold front that had
passed through Louisville the night before.

Once inside, I knew we were in for a treat -- a large room with a dozen
or more tables lining the walls and a large central area, all covered
by groups of people several layers deep.  I estimate there were well over
150 there when we arrived.  I had brought along my ancient Polaroid SX-70,
and got some halfway decent snaps.  There were a couple of guys from our
sister group, Gold City of Fort Knox/Radcliff, KY; Shawn Randolph of
Silent Paws Productions assembling a portable A1200 with color LCD screen;
two shots of master Amiga artist and animator Eric Schwartz (one showing
one of our group, but Eric blinked) sitting at his shiny new A4000 Tower
and huge 20" TIMM monitor; and Joshua Dinakaran of Wonder Computers
International, all the way from Canada.  I left the snaps with our scanner
professional -- sure hope I get the scans back in time to put some of them
in ASK's November newsletter!

Eric and his dad, of Weingarten Gallery in Dayton, Ohio, had lots and lots
of old and not-so-old hardware and software and quite a few CDs and videos
of Eric's work.  The CDs and videos sold out by 3 PM.  They sold quite a
few T-shirts bearing Eric's work as well.

The Jesrani family, of Columbus' own Compuquick Media Center had the largest
(and busiest) set of tables piled high with all manner of goodies.  One of
our number added a 68030 accelerator/ram card for his A1200 to his load of
booty from this booth.

Another of our troup came away with an A2386 Bridgeboard from the Neather
Realm Software table, after learning that he could upgrade it to '486 or
even '586 clone performance.  The man is a (computer) speed freak!

There were many user groups represented.  Amicon, our hosts, and groups
from Michigan, Tennessee, Kentucky and of course St. Louis.  The folks
at the Gateway table were just getting ready to leave for a wedding by
the time I got to their table, but I managed to pick up a copy of the
November GAC FLAK (another _very_ nice issue!).  Cool mugs, too; are
they the color-changing type?

A little after 1 PM, the crowd thinned CONSIDERABLY.  I wondered if there
were some really big game starting until it was pointed out to me that
the Toaster/Flyer demo by Steve Easly started at 1.  Oh.  Well, at least
now I could reach the tables and see what all there was to see.

In what I thought was a brilliant move, one Saul Hoffman had his loaded
A2000 sitting on a table next to a sign reading "Sick Amiga Workshop --
Suggestions Welcome."  The poor thing wouldn't boot properly and about
80% of the software on the hard drive(s) wouldn't run.  Many people
stood about and made dumb suggestions until we finally hit on something.
Turns out he had been running a web browser (Voyager, I think) and
apparently the image cache had overflowed and corrupted his hard drive,
including some system software.  We got it to boot properly from a floppy,
and all the software on it ran fine, while the hard drive versions still
froze.  By the time I wandered on, enough had been restored from the
backup on the handy internal Syquest 44 that SID would run, making the
rest a piece of cake.  (I love happy endings!)  *B^)

It was great putting faces to several people I knew only as names on email
or in exchanged newsletters, though the Amicon people were too busy to
talk much, and everybody else was too busy scrambling to grab all the
goodies they could before it all disappeared.  I did manage to nosily ask
about attendance.  The Amicon people hadn't done an official count, but
unofficial estimates placed paid attendance at "well over 250" by 5 PM, so
they shouldn't end up suffering from the experience (except for fatigue).

Finally, richer by several pieces of hardware, many CDs, videos and software
packages and a couple of T-shirts (and poorer by several hundred dollars),
our group wended its happy way home, arriving only thirteen hours after we
left.  We were sorry to have to miss Jason Compton of VIScorp and Don Hicks
of Amazing Computing, both scheduled to be there the next day, but it was
time to move along home.  On the whole trip, the navigator was responsible
for only about two and a half wrong turns, none disastrous.  On the whole,
it was a BLAST!

Really makes me look forward to Gateway's Amiga '97 show next March -- that
one should be even BIGGER!!!

===========================================================================

It's happening - the long summer drought of Amiga games is finally coming
to an end.  Many thought that it was all over for the Amiga, and the games
market had died a death.  Certainly most of the big US software houses has
moved onto greener PC pastures, but the gap left by them has been filled by
the small, independant companies.

Vulcan Software, the UK-based mainstays of the Amiga games scene, look set
to dominate AR's reviews section with several titles currently under
development.

JetPilot, a flight simulator (bet you worked that one out yourself), will
probably be the first of the titles to be released.  Billed as "The
Realistic Flight Simulator", the claim can be believed if the number of
keypresses available count for anything.  JetPilot is scheduled for release
around the start of November, and we will be reviewing it as soon as we
can.

Tiny Troops ("Where War is Fantastic!") should be with us at the start of
Decemeber.  If the slogan reminds you of Cannon Fodder, the game probably
will too; tiny aliens slog it out in MicroMachines-style landscapes.  From
the previews we have, Tiny Troops is shaping up well, combining war-game
tactics with fast action.

Hell Pigs looks to be the Amiga's biggest ever graphic action adventure,
shipping on 22 floppies.  More exciting still is the planned CD-ROM
version, complete with Full Motion Video, actor-spoken speech and an 18/X
certificate on the box.  From the pre-release screenshots, Hell Pigs is
looking pretty tasty, and hopefully the gameplay will match up when it's
released in January 97.

Finally, Breed 2000 - a working title which may yet change - is a
redevelopment of Damian Tarnwasky's shareware hit Breed 96.  When Amiga
Report reviewed Breed 96 earlier this year, we rated it highly with
comments such as "polished and classy", "a belter of a game" and "easy to
play".  We therefore wait with baited breath for the commercial version,
and we think you should too.

Vulcan have also announced their web site is now fully up and running,
complete with playable demos of most forthcoming titles.  If you can, make
sure you visit Vulcan WWW at http://www.vulcan.co.uk.

Aside from Vulcan, there's an exciting new release from Apex Software
entitled "Blobz".  Based heavily on the Psygnosis's classic Lemmings series
of games, Blobz sets the player as a god over several ...  er ...  blobs
that, for some reason, need to get from A to B without being killed.  From
the demo on Aminet (game/demo/blobz.lha), Blobz is an addictive,
well-written game that should appeal to anyone who had even a passing fancy
for Lemmings.  We should be bringing you a full review in the next issue.

Other interesting game demo's on Aminet include a Wipeout clone,
Slipstream, which is really nothing more than a demo of a game engine, but
very promising nonetheless.  We also have information on Uropa² from Austex
software; again, a review is pending.  All this plus the imminent release
of Chaos Engine 2 from Warner ... 

Our advice is - don't hang up that joystick yet.

@node FEATURE3 "Amigas In Iran"
@toc FEATURE

===========================================================================
                              Amigas In Iran
  Paymaan Jafari                                         rdc@dci.iran.com
===========================================================================

   First of all, It's better to introduce myself; I am Paymaan Jafari,
Founder of PALAPAL Amiga Programmers Group(0098-21-3153445), & Forum-Op
of NONIBM forum of MAVARA BBS(0098 21 8740815) Tehran, Iran.

   Our group and I have designed, programmed, and made control, medical,
etc.  systems for about 6 years just using our beloved Amiga.

   I remember Commodore used to have a branch on Iran, till about 4 years
ago, and although it was just importing Amigas here, it was helping us to
get our machines as easily as possible.  And suddenly Commodore went away
and its branch changed its business to other computers, mainly IBM-PC
clones :(.

   At first we were shocked.  Until that day, we were arguing to PC & MAC
users about the detail and power of AmigaOS and mostly about the hardware,
CPU (I believe Motorola is best in making CPU, both for users and
programmers.) and finally, the architecture of the Amiga.  We were already
victorious in these fights.  There was no technical reason they could use
to show we are wrong!  Just some usual things we all have heard from these
types of users, like: "If the PC is bad, why are so many people using it?"
or "If the Mac is bad, why does it cost so much more?" and the like.  :)
All weak reasons.  We even tried to show our university professors what a
strong OS & Hardware Amiga has, and tried to do all our hardware and
software projects on Amiga.

   After retreat of Commodore, Amiga's prices began to get higher and
higher, and more people went toward those low-cost Pentiums and DXs.  Other
Amigans and me tried to get information, software and magazines from around
the world to supply users, to recover our Amiga Community moral and to
bring users back to our beloved platform.  Some came back, because DOS and
Windows are really hard to use, especially for users who have worked on an
Amiga, but low prices and that damn DOOM game, no useful Persian font and
direction compatibility (our caligraphy is right-to-left, but numbers &
math are written left-to-right), also the PC bad standard font and char
table that uses Amiga control codes for normal chars, causing problems in
showing them in normal Amiga Console devices, made others to stay on PCs. 

   To solve our problems we have need of information about new libraries,
new capabilities of OS and other info any programmer needs.  But I have
just 2.04 autodoc series and no idea where in the world I can find
up-to-date information.  We had no speedy connection to the internet, and
the embargo was another problem.

   Amiga users branched to 3 types or groups: professional
animators/musicians who were already the main film/TV-adverts/clips
generators, these people have no problems, they easily bring required
systems by themselves (it is no problem for a person who is returning to
the country to buy and bring a full system), and they are always successful
in making the best products in TV.

   Second group was programmers (us) :-).  Everything was against us!  No
copyright laws, no support from the former Commodore, (even when it was
alive), no documents, nothing, nothing, nothing...!  Some of us tried to
get required information by ourselves.  I myself tried to buy AutoDocs and
connect to programmers and Commodore itself, to catch the info. 

   I bought the full AutoDocs from USA, but CATS never accepted my
subscription and this made me supportless (others too!).  Even with all of
these problems, our team made some great software/hardware that were based
just on the Amiga.  A language laboratory controlling system, a micro
resistance meter (for Sharif Industrial University, Tehran), 3 or 4 medical
systems; a gamma ray photographer,...  and finally 2 of us made the
PolymerAnalyzer, it won the 3rd place Innovation prize in 1994/5 (1374
Solar year from Hejrat, our time base.) and all of the systems were a
little hardware plus a assembly code written by my dear friend Majid
Heidary, and just an A1200!!!

   Third group are normal users, gamers, kids,...  they are main part of
Amigans here, but we can't rely on them.  This group can easily change
their way, seeing a DOOM may cause them to sell the high-price A1200 and
buy a low-cost Pentium120 to play DOOM and WarCraft!!!.  Students are
better than gamers, but lack of educational software is a problem.  There
is no low-cost analog electric software (like SPICE), Math software (like
Derive) and other topics you know.  Desktop publishers have all gone to the
MAC or PC side, cause there is *NO Persian DTP Package* here, and no DTP
packages support right-to-left (also some other minor differences) for
their publishing.

   After 2 years without any useful relations with other Amigans around the
world, we tried to support our country's Amiga users by ourselves, by
exchanging information, shareware/PD programs, magazines (AReport mainly :)
) and news.  To do this, two of us increased our activity on one of the
best Iranian BBSs, called MAVARA, so they accepted that an AMIGA forum was
a need, and created that and a file Library too.

   I got to be its operator, and suddenly, we gathered all Amiga users
there, providing them their needed info and files.  Through INTERNET
connections, we found our best info and shareware resources and these were
so good, cause if we want to use commercial software, there is no
authorized dealer and we are forced to use pirated copies (that I extremely
hate.)

   All we have done, was just to keep our beloved Amiga alive, and to show
people how well its made, but it is not the time to delay, it is the time
for competition, with all of our capabilities, to pass this critical
period.  Till now, the hi-tech design of Amiga has made it stay alive, but
time passes, and computer technology progresses too fast, and if we don't
move, it'll be to late too win the competition. 

   We need VISCorp's support.  Iran has a extremely high capacity for
selling Amiga, many more than other countries, if it imported here by a
company, not people.  If all text based programs, like DTP, text editors
and even vector and bitmap painting packages consider a right-to-left
option for text (with some descriptions about control codes), then I
estimate we could force almost all publishers to use Amiga as their base
system.  We have made some commodities, but if the software itself support
this option, it'll be more functional.

   Also, I would like to ask programmers to contact us for persian
localization of their software (also we can do arabic translations).  The
last need is about shareware support.  We can do money transfer to
programmers, but if and only if they consider a lower shareware fee for
countries like us where the money rate is lower than theirs.  And they also
have to support those users through us, just like other users.  This may
sound not so good, but it helps shareware authors to be supported.  For
this, all Amiga users around the world will get low-cost good programs,
because our costs are very lower than other countries too.

   I'll be at anyone's service who wants to know more about us.  Here I'm
going to appreciate some good friends;

    Mr.  Compton, who has made this great magazine, Tachyon, Sibbi, TjardE
    (On IRC) and many others who helped me to prepare my WWW, AmiTCP, Mlink
    to work, and any other Amiga Lover/User/Programmer/Artist :)

                  Internet Payment Systems - An Overview

===========================================================================

I started this Internet Payment System article some time ago, while
volunteering my time as part of the Amiga Development Fund Team.  The
purpose of the ADF is to support programmers of freeware and shareware
software in their enhancement of the Amiga Platform.  Well we want a
Internet Payment System that a Amiga User could call up and donate cash to
their favorite project/programmer.  Well as it turns out, I found lots of
places that deal with Internet funds in some form or another.  But most of
them only worked on various PC or Mac type computer systems.  There are a
couple of banking systems out there that support Unix type systems.  But
NOTHING for the Amiga !! 

So what are Internet Payment Systems?

While this idea doesn't seem complicated or unique it has created some
security issues for the customer involved.  Companies such as Digicash and
CyberCash have jumped on this issue by creating Internet Payment Systems,
or more generally, Electronic Payment Systems (EPS).  The systems that are
being developed incorporate the conventional forms of monetary
transactions: Cash, Check, and Credit Card.

-----------------------------------------------------------

What different markets exist today for internet payments?

Private purchases : These may include everything purchased for some people
who are very concerned about Big Brother, or special gift items that a
customer doesn't want his/her spouse to see.  There are a variety of
reasons and times that people may want to keep their purchases private.
Under these cases an electronic form of cash provides the required
anonymity.  Most of the proprietary systems out there right now are privacy
oriented.

Small purchases: These include pay per view articles and information,
one-time access to a commercial websites, or a download fee for a piece of
software.  These charges may be on the magnitude of a dollar or less.
These purchases are too small to warrant the costs of a credit card
transaction.   First Virtual is the real leader in micropayments.  Recent
developments in this area include the release of the Micro Payment Transfer
Protocol (MPTP) standard from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) on
November 22 1995. 

Medium and large purchases: These include items that customers normally
purchase with credit cards at stores.  They can range from under $10 up to
thousands of dollars.  This market will most likely be dominated by credit
cards.  The purchases are large enough to warrant the relatively high cost
per transaction of a credit card.  Security concerns are being actively
addressed by both Master Card and Visa.  In autumn of 1995 Visa and
Microsoft teamed up and released the Secure Transactions Technology (STT)
encryption standard.  At the same time Master Card, Netscape, CyberCash,
GTE, and IBM introduced Secure Electronic Payment Protocol (SEPP).  In
February of 1996 they teamed up and released a joint draft standard Secure
Electronic Transaction (SET) was projected to be completed by this summer.

----------------------------------------------------------

What's on the Web today ?

 The 2 most common payment methods on the internet today are: 

Phone in orders : Many companies are only using the Web as a billboard for
the company and its products.  If a person wants to order an item they are
given a 1-800 number to call.  An operator processes the order just as if
the customer saw an advertisement on TV or in a magazine.

Credit card orders : Customer use a web based CGI form to fill out their
order information and provide their credit card number.  Netscape 2.0
introduced Secure Sockets Layer (SLL) technology to protect the card
numbers.  Users are often advised if they are using an older browser that
does not have SLL built in, to phone in their order.  Still, many people
are very concerned about internet security and are reluctant to send their
gold card numbers with their $5000 credit limit into cyberspace. 

Major Internet based payment systems in use today are:

First Virtual confirms every purchase with an e-mail to the customer to
verify the validity of the transaction.  The only number sent over the net
is the customers First Virtual ID code.  They have the largest number of
merchants and information vendors by far. 
 
CyberCash has you download a CyberCash wallet which is similar to the money
handling software from the other firms.  They are supported by multiple
banks and merchants. 

Digicash which is handled by Mark Twain Bank and used by a variety of
merchants on the WWW.  It is based on creating a cash & quote which
consists of 64 bit numbers that are passed from the customer to the vendor,
and back to the bank for verification. 

The NetBank, Home of NetCash transfers funds through a series of
non-encoded numbers that are e-mailed to vendors.  Strings of numbers are
assigned certain values when they are issued. 

 -----------------------------------------------------------

Internet Payment Systems Challenges

The biggest challenge for Internet Payment Systems is finding customers and
vendors who are willing to risk investing in a product that is currently in
its introduction stage.  What this has created is a chicken and egg effect.
Banks and software companies can't get customers without vendors, and they
can't get vendors without customers.

Security factors are perhaps the biggest deterrent for individuals
interested in making on-line purchases.  Most people fear giving their
credit card numbers, phone numbers or addresses not knowing who will be
able to retrieve that information without their consent.  It is interesting
to note that most people don't even give it a second thought when
purchasing items with a credit card over the phone, but to ask them to do
it from their PC makes them very uncomfortable.  New developments in credit
card security Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) are taking this fear away
by adding encryption to scramble the card number so only the vendor and
customer can read it.

Privacy is a significant factor in some of the payment schemes.  
Cyberpunks feel that privacy is paramount.  However, the public has become
comfortable with credit cards and debit cards.  Private cash has a
potential market, but it may not be as large as people today are thinking.

-----------------------------------------------------

Electronic Cash and the Web 

Systems such as Digicash and NetCash allow the customer to deposit cash
into a bank account then use that cash to purchase items off the internet.
Digicash customers receive an encoded 64 bit number for each nickel they
convert to e-cash, which is then transferred to the users hard drive.  The
customer can then transfer the cash to vendors on the internet (as long as
the vendor accepts this form of payment).  The vendor then returns the
e-cash to the bank in exchange for real money.

Disadvantage of the Web and Electronic Cash ;

Digital dollars are uninsured : For example, if you hard drive were to
crash, your e-bank goes under, or hackers were to decode your numbers,
there would be no way retrieve your lost cash (just as if you dropped a $20
bill on the street and lost it).  Since the bank does not link the money to
your name they would have no way to reimburse you.  However, Digicash's
e-cash is recoverable if your hard disk crashes.  In that case the customer
would have to give up his/her anonymity to get the e-cash replaced by the
bank. 

Advantages of the Web and Electronic Cash ;

Privacy : Electronic cash is untraceable.  The bank does not link the
numbers to a particular person, therefore it is impossible to link payment
to payer.  The customer does not have to worry about being added to dozens
of mailing lists.  Unless of course, the customer has ordered actual
merchandise that needs to be sent to their home, instead of information
that can be sent over the internet. 

Limited liability : A customer can only loose as much money as they are
carrying.  People may be more willing to deal with electronic cash and only
risk the $20 in their electronic wallet than to send their $5,000 goldcard
number across the net.

 --------------------------------------------------

Credit Cards and the Web 

Credit card systems will operate much in the same way as they currently do.
The customer will be able to use their current credit card, if desired, to
purchase items directly from the vendor.  The main difference is that the
major credit card companies have developed an encryption standard called
Secure Electronic Transaction (SET).

With SET the merchant does not receive your credit card number.  Rather,
they receive a token, which is passed on to the bank who then uses the
token to get the actual number, authorizes or declines the transaction,
then sends the merchant an authorization number.  The merchant is assured
that the card is good, and completes the transactions.  All of this is done
with public-key encryption to assure authenticity of the parties.  Also,
with SET the consumer receives a certified digital receipt for the
transaction.  In essence, SET transactions will not just be AS secure as
traditional transaction, they will actually be more SECURE. 

Disadvantages of Credit Cards and the Web ;

Lack of privacy : Unlike cash transactions that are anonymous, credit card
transactions link your name to the account.  Therefore, the customer will
not be able to maintain the anonymity of a cash transaction.  They also run
the risk of having their name added to a bunch of mailing lists.

Advantages of Credit Cards and the Web ;

Your money is securely in the bank : If you would happen to loose the card,
the account is still linked to your name.  Therefore, unlike cash systems
there is a way the bank can verify your account balance and the money
itself is not lost. 

There is no need to open a new account : Unlike cash systems which require
the user to open a new account with a bank that is currently set up to
handle this type of transaction, with the credit card system the customer
would be able to keep the bank account and credit card they currently have.
This is a very important factor in the early stages of web commerce. 

-----------------------------------------------

Checks and the Web 

Schemes to transfer electronic checks across the web are not as well
developed as the other forms of fund transfers.  Checks could be something
as simple as e-mailing a message to a merchant authorizing them to draw
funds from your account, with digital signatures and certificates attached.
In many ways a check system is a compromise between a credit card system
and a cash system.  CheckFree, NetCheque, and NetChex are the major players
in the check market. 

Disadvantages of Checks and the Web ;

Privacy : Although not near as bad as credit cards, checks would still
reveal data about the customer. 

Advantages of Checks and the Web ;

Processing: Electronic checks can be processed the same as current checks
are processed, through the Automated Clearing House.  They would look
different, but they are still just checks. 

Making Change : Electronic cash can not be written for just any amount.  
If you get a $25 number string from NetCash and want to buy something for
$5 you have to send your number string back to NetBank and ask for change.
They then send you a $5 string and a $20 string.  A check system would
allow the user to specify the exact amount of the transaction. 

Your money is securely in the bank : Customers don't need to worry about
losing anything as they would in a cash system. 

 -------------------------------------------------

Visions of the future 

The Internet payment market belongs to the companies that can get a
convenient and secure method to everyones computer the fastest.  Once an
initial lead is clearly demonstrated, the standard will attract more
vendors which will attract more customers, which will attract more vendors,
and so on.

The Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) standard from Mastercard and Visa
appears to have the lead.  Although it is extremely new, it has the backing
of Microsoft, Netscape, CyberCash, GTE, and IBM.  The public already
possesses and understands credit cards.  It's not a new account, or a new
bank to deal with.  It's just a new way of sending the card number.  Once
the public believes the encryption is safe or receives a guarantee that
they will not be held responsible for fraudulent hacker purchases, then
there will be no stopping the standard.  The initial lead will cause
vendors to scramble to get on board and will create a more competitive
market for customers.

An encrypted credit card system is great for medium and large purchases,
but will not satisfy the needs for small and private purchases.  This
leaves a niche market open for one of the proprietary software companies
who are now fighting for a lead.  Who will that company be is impossible to
say.  But it is a reasonable guess that it will be one of the firms listed
above. 

 ------------------------------------------------------

Advice for you while on the Internet

Allow payments thorough as many channels as possible.  They can not afford
to turn away any customer who does not have the specific type of electronic 
cash  system software platform.  The more systems they hear of the more 
systems that will be supported. 

Open a merchant account with each of the leading payment system companies,
most offer good deals to attract new business.

Keep a close eye on the market and watch them scramble against their
competitors.

What I would like to see Happen ;

I would like to see Amiga system users join the Amiga Development Fund
team.  There they could donate time an funds supporting programmers that
could port PC/Mac software to the Amiga.  Check out the ADF web page at
http://afrodite.hibu.no:8001/paulken4/adf/index.html

Also the Free Software Union has a mailing list where they just began an
Amiga porting issue area.  This is new so they need programmers and users
with ideas.  To subscribe, your e-mail should goto
majordomo@fsu.clsp.jhu.edu and have a blank subject line and a body
containing only subscribe fsu-amiga.  You can check out the FSU via the web

@node REVIEW1 "Review: Diavolo 3.4 PRO"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                          Review: Diavolo 3.4 PRO
  Ivo Kroone                                             ivo@pimpernel.nl
===========================================================================

Naming a backup program "Diavolo" (Devil) is probably the worst name anyone
can think of for a backup program.  Who in their right mind would trust
his/her priceless data to the Devil?  After using the program for 2 weeks I
for one would.

Hardware used for testing:

Amiga 3000T/040 (2MB chip, 8 MB fast)  Amiga 500 plus (1MB chip, 2MB fast)
KickStart 3.1                          KickStart 2.04
1.4 G harddisk space                   520 MB harddisk space
Toshiba 4.5 speed CD-ROM               A570 single speed CD-ROM
built in SCSI controller               Supra XP ByteSync SCSI controller
          both with a Wang DDS/DAT-streamer model 3100 0.02 SCSI

UNPACKING AND INSTALLING

Making a living out of the Amiga means data needs to be backed up very
safely.  I opted for a Wang 3100 DAT streamer (officially "DSS DAT drive"),
capable of storing 2 G on one tape at a speed of 20 MB per minute.  Buying
a tape streamer also meant choosing software.  The choice was between
AmiBack, Quarterback, BackMan and Diavolo.  Development for both AmiBack
and Quarterback seems to have ceased anyway so they were not a real option.
Tape streamer support in BackMan (shareware!) is very limited compared to
Diavolo.

Clearly Diavolo is developed by a real Amiga freak.  The program uses the
standard Commodore installer utility, Magic Workbench (but does not depend
on it), a font sensitive GUI, drag and drop file selection, XPK compression
libraries and internal multi tasking.  The user interface is ace!

While installing the program will suggest to make an emergency boot disk. 
If the entire harddisk crashes, this disk can be used to boot from, run
Diavolo and restore the data.  The installer script includes a plug for
Magic Workbench, asking to install a demo version.  The script will ask the
user to install/replace some libraries.  Wether the user has a VLab motion
board or not, the VLab motion support library will be installed.  Perhaps
the program can check for that board first and only install the library if
needed?  Installation does not include personalization.  The unique serial
number is already "burned" into the program on the original disk.

USING DIAVOLO

Backups can be made to disk (both HD and DD), removable media (such as ZIP
or EZdrive), an AmigaDOS file or tape steamer.  Backups can be compressed
using any XPK compression library.  The default settings have suggested
compressors for each CPU.  A password and/or encryption can also be
applied.  When using a device that already compresses the data itself, one
should not have Diavolo compress the data as well.

Sources can be AmigaDOS volumes, AFS volumes and even custom file systems
like Macintosh or NetBSD partitions.  Using the MAC handler is it is even
possible to backup a Shapeshifter disk file wise.  Partitions have to be
mounted for Diavolo to see them.  To avoid useless icons on my Workbench I
have both my Shapeshifter and NetBSD partitions not auto mounted, therefore
Diavolo cannot see them.  The program did, however, see the shared
NetBSD/VMM virtual memory partition (which is also not auto mounted).  The
author suggests using a utility like SCSImounter to fix this problem.

Selecting files to be backed up (from any AmigaDOS compatible medium) is
very simple but can be made very complex on demand.  A directory tree with
MagicWB style 8 colour icons for volumes, drawers and assigns can be used
to visually select files.  Files can be selected individually, per
directory or per volume.  Using the advanced selection options one can make
filters to include or exclude files by date, archive bit, filename or
pattern.  These filters can be saved to disk or be edited using a text
editor for later use.  The manual provides examples on how to create such
files from scratch by hand.  A none AmigaDOS partition can only be backed
up and restored as a whole.

After backup archive bits can be set automatically.  After storing a CD-ROM
on tape it took some effort to convince Diavolo to stop displaying a "disk
is write protected" request for every file.  Hard- and soft linked files
and/or directories can be backed up as such on demand.

BACKUP TO DISK

When backing up to disk Diavolo will calculate the number of disks needed
for that backup.  When using compression this estimate will be the maximum
number of disks.  Of course all drives connected to the system can be used,
including high density drives.  While backing up bad sectors on a
destination disk can optionally be skipped so the disk can still be used. 
As Diavolo is a multi tasking program, the user can alter the backup
configuration while making a backup.

BACKUP TO FILE

A backup to an AmigaDOS file can be useful to compact a lot of small unused
files into one big file.  Also a none AmigaDOS partition can temporarily be
stored as an AmigaDOS file.  The standard options like compression and
encryption can still be used.  If a volume is full while writing a file
Diavolo will allow the user to continue that file on a different volume!

BACKUP TO REMOVABLE

Lacking a removable drive I was not able to try this option.  According to
the author of Diavolo is big advantage of directly writing to a removable
instead of writing a file to a removable is speed.  If a backup doesn't not
fit on one removable disk multiple disks can be used.

BACKUP TO TAPE

Diavolo is without a doubt the best backup program when it comes to
configuring for tape steamers.  Every tape streamer related parameter is
configurable making sure the program makes the most out of the hardware. 
Diavolo can "interrogate" a tape streamer and thereby configure all
parameters automatically.  The well written English manual explains every
single parameter but clearly states that auto config will always be better.

Diavolo's strongest point is tape streamer support.  Because of the linear
nature of a tape, the contents of a backup are written to harddisk for easy
access.  Every backup should be given a name for future reference.  Before
writing any data to the tape a window pops up showing the contents of that
tape showing the backup name, date and size.  The user can either append a
backup or overwrite the last backup(s) on the tape.

When backing up to tape the system gains speed while working.  After
setting the best buffers and task priorities for my hardware according to
the manual, the average speed when storing the Fujitsu harddisk in my A3000
to tape is 12 MB per minute.  Using the Amiga 500 with Quantum harddisk
this speed was reduced to 5 MB per minute.  I also backed up an Amiga 1200
harddisk via the AmigaTalk network, resulting in a speed of 1 MB per
minute.  As this is a floppy port based network this low speed can be
blamed entirely on the network hardware.  Backup from CD-ROM (one can fit 3
filled to capacity CD-ROMs on a single DDS tape!) also works without any
problems.  I tried this both using the Toshiba 4.5 speed CD-ROM in the
A3000 and the A570 in the A500.

Using both data (3M 90 minutes and Sony 90 minutes) and audio (3M 120
minutes) DAT tapes the result remains the same.  The audio tapes did not
show any more errors while comparing but I've been told that most DAT
streamers simply don't recognize audio tapes as valid tapes.

RESTORING DATA

Every backup can be compared to the original afterwards.  If using verify
when backing up to disks this is not very useful.  A tape however can only
be verified after writing all data.  While comparing a report is produced
showing which files differ from the tape according to file content, header
or date.  Regrettably this process always crashes half way on my Amiga 3000
(always a different GURU number).  As it works flawlessly on my Amiga 500
as well as on a friend's Amiga 4000/040 I blame my A3000, not Diavolo.

While restoring an existing file, this file can either be overwritten or
renamed.  Diavolo having internal multi tasking also allows the user to
configure restore settings while already restoring!

Reliability when restoring from disk is excellent.  Diavolo needs tracks 0
and 79 for vital information about the disk.  Every other track may be
invalid and Diavolo can still continue to restore the readable tracks. 
While restoring bad files, sectors or disks can be skipped.  Diavolo will
always try to restore every last possible bit of data.  Even when the index
is missing and only one single disk of a backup set remains, the data from
that single disk can be restored (providing at least tracks 0 and 79 are
readable).

Just like reliability from disk, tapes are surely not forgotten either.  If
the index on harddisk gets lost, it can be rebuilt from tape.  Of course if
both tape and disk are partly unreadable that part of the index cannot be
rescued.  If a tape itself is unreadable it is upto the streamer to decide
what options remain.  Diavolo has little control over the process inside
the hardware so this is very much up to the user's particular hardware.

MISCELLANEOUS

Diavolo PRO comes with a scheduler and daemon to auto backup data.  My
computer is not online 24 hours a day and personally I prefer to backup the
harddisks whenever I feel like it.  Regarding in superb quality of the
backup program itself I have no reason to believe that the quality of the
scheduler and daemon is any less.

Some German programs (i.e.  MultiFax, Retina software) have poor or half
translations.  Except for the German text on the box, this English version
of Diavolo has not a trace of any German text string in it.  The English
manual is very well written; it is clear, contains useful examples with
pictures and a handy "question and answer" appendix.

Updates and patches can only be obtained via Computer Conrner because of
the serial number in the software.  Despite of what the manual says the
NATHAN mailbox cannot longer be reached.  Further more the address of the
author has changed to: korndoerfer@t-online.de

Diavolo is notorious in the illegal software circuit.  Versions with nasty
viruses have been around as well a versions that will backup but never
restore data.  The author of Diavolo did everything possible to create the
absolute best backup software for the Amiga todate.  Diavolo comes in a
standard and pro version, both at very reasonable prices.  Destroying the
fragile Amiga market by spreading failing copies of a program is not Elite,
it is the worst kind of user a platform can have.

CONCLUSION

A couple of years ago Quarterback and AmiBack were good packages but
Diavolo clearly passed them by a long shot.  The shareware program BackMan
is a jewel in its own right but cannot compare to Diavolo when it comes to
reliability and support for devices like removables and tape streamers.

Diavolo is without a doubt the best backup program for the Amiga.  The user
interface has the looks and feel one expects from a 1996 Amiga program.
The program can backup everything and will store it on every medium
supported by the Amiga hardware.  Even if the backup medium itself fails,
Diavolo will do everything it can to restore whatever data is left.
Diavolo is the kind of program trust my precious data to, regardless of the
name!

Likes:
- reliability
- excellent SCSI tape streamer support
- user interface
- ability to backup non AmigaDOS partitions
- author's devotion to Amiga

Dislikes:
- name
- program size (with over 500k it will hardly load AND store tape contents
  in memory of my Amiga 500)

Price:

340,-).

DEMO VERSION

  None.

SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

  HARDWARE

    SCSI controller required.

  SOFTWARE

    A CD-ROM filesystem, such as "CDFileSystem" as found on the 3.1
    Workbench disks.

COPY PROTECTION

  None.

MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

  Amiga 3000/25, 4 MB Fast RAM, 2 MB Chip RAM.
    Maxtor 120MB 7210SR internal hard disk.
  NEC Multisync-II multisync monitor.
  AmigaOS 3.1.
  CDFileSystem filesystem version 40.9 (used at first...)
  AmiCDROM filesystem version 1.15 (... and then replaced by AmiCDROM)

INSTALLATION

  Because the unit itself is external, you will have to connect it to your
SCSI controller somehow.  On my Amiga 3000, this is easily done using the
'system' cable that comes with the CD-ROM unit.  If the unit is to be
connected to another device on a daisy-chain, a SCSI 'peripheral' cable is
required.  Such a cable is not included with the AppleCD 600e package.

  If the CD-ROM is the last device on the external chain of SCSI units, it
has to be equipped with a 'terminator'.  The terminator is a resistor that
tells the SCSI controller that this is the last device on a given chain of
devices.  A terminator that plugs right into one of the AppleCD's two SCSI
busses is supplied with the package.

  In order for the Amiga to communicate with the unit, a software
filesystem has to be mounted.  Users of Workbench 3.0 and above already
have one in the L: directory.  This filesystem is henceforth referred to as
'CDFilesystem'.  Although this filesystem is capable of dealing with CDs
made for the Amiga, it lacks certain features third party filesystems
display.  Users who wants unlock their CD-ROM unit's full potential should
look for a filesystem replacement.  (Note: The user manual mentions Audio
CD, CD-ROM, CD-ROM XA, CD+I, Photo CD, Video CD, CD+MIDI and CD+G as
compatible Apple 600e CD-ROM formats.)

  In theory, the installation process should be a breeze.  Just plug an
appropriate SCSI cable into the last device on the (external) daisy-chain
and attach a terminator if the CD-ROM is the last piece of equipment on the
chain.  But then, this is in theory.  This process showed to be more
troublesome than first expected.  More on this later.

REVIEW

  'This should be pretty much painless', I thought while connecting the
SCSI cable to my Amiga 3000, 'Just plug in the CD-ROM, power up the
computer and mount CD0:.'.  Yes, it _should_ be pretty much painless, but
then there is Murphy's Law.  I followed the instructions step by step as
prompted by the manual, turned on the AppleCD 600e and then the computer
itself.  Nothing.  Then nothing.  Then the "Insert Workbench floppy"
animation.  'Great.  The hard disk won't boot.'.  I powered down everything
and double checked the terminator and the SCSI cable.  Everything did seem
to be in order, so I decided to power up the computer again with the CD-ROM
turned off, just to check whether or not my Amiga would boot from the hard
disk like it had during the last three years.  No problem, everything
worked like a charm, just like it always had.  'Oh well', I said, 'I'll
figure out why the computer won't boot with the CD-ROM turned on at first
later.'.  Anxiously, I wanted to mount the CD filesystem.  I turned on the
CD-ROM unit again, this time during the boot.  As soon as the Amiga had
finished the boot sequence, I put a CD in the slot and mounted CD0:.
Again, nothing.  No icons showing up on the Workbench desktop, no device
entry for CD0: reported by "C:Info".  It appeared like my CD-ROM was
configured as SCSI ID 3 by default.  CDFileSystem on the other hand expects
the CD-ROM to use ID 2.  I changed the unit's ID to 2 as described by the
manual.  This is done by pushing the tip of a pen into a small hole on the
back of the unit, just like you set the time on most digital wrist clocks.
I powered up the CD-ROM again, mounted CD0: again and...  it worked!

  I took a brief look at my Amiga's hard disk LED.  'Now what' I cried out,
getting tired of all these new problems piling up like unpaid bills on the
kitchen table.  The LED.  It was flashing.  Every three seconds, that damn
thing flashed!  No hard disk activity and still, it flashed!  I later
learned that this is normal behavior of CDFileSystem.  The filesystem is
polling the CD-ROM unit to check for new CDs being removed and inserted,
pretty much like the Amiga checks for floppies (thus the clicking sound). 
Everytime a poll is made, the hard disk LED flashes.  This may sound odd,
and it is if you like me don't know about the A3000's hard disk LED
actually being a "SCSI" LED.  The LED displays the SCSI controller's
activity meaning every action undertaken by any SCSI unit, may it be
internal or external, will be reflected by the "hard disk" LED.  (This
"problem" was solved by a lot of helpful people responding to an article I
submitted to two USENET Amiga newsgroups.)

  Still, one problem remained.  When I for some reason had to reboot the
computer without a CD in the AppleCD 600e unit, nothing happend.  Annoying
yes, but I soon found out that the computer would boot from the hard disk
as soon as I put a data CD into the unit or after waiting perhaps half a
minute.  I wasn't content with this solution, however.  This shouldn't
simply be.  Some intense e-mail correspondence with Claus Pedersen, Denmark
sorted things out.  To quote Clauss: "Having a normal ISO CD placed in the
drive, usually shortens the wait period".  So what is the cause of the
period of waiting then?  Well, it has to do with the CD-ROM unit looking
for a boot strap.  If no CD is placed in the unit, it'll continue to search
until it timed out by the SCSI controlled.  However, if a CD is inserted
during this process or before it even started the CD-ROM will stop looking
for boot straps unless, of course, there is one in which case it will boot
from the CD instead from the hard disk.  As I don't have access to any
bootable CDs right now, I havn't had a chance to test booting off CDs. 
(There are other means of getting around this problem.  Since this is a
review I won't go into any details here and now.  Please get in touch with
me if you have any questions regarding this matter.)

  I thought I'd wrap up the review with some benchmarks I made.  I ran this
script using CDFileSystem version 40.9, then AmiCDROM version 1.15 and
finally AmiCDFS version 2.37 (unregistrated).

Date
Copy sprintsos1:games/entertn1/depth.zip RAM: QUIET
Date

  The CD used for the benchmarks is 'Super OZ Shareware Volume 1'.  Sorry
to say, I had no Amiga CD available with files larger than one megabyte so
I had to use a friend's CD instead.  The file "depth.zip" is 1452051 bytes
large.

CDFileSystem version 40.9 takes 21 seconds to complete this operation,
which translates to approximatly 67 KB/second (1452051 / 21 / 1024).

AmiCDROM version 1.15 takes 4 seconds to complete this operation, which
translates to approximatly 354 KB/second (1452051 / 4 / 1024).

AmiCDFS version 2.37 takes 21 seconds to complete this operation, which
translates to approximatly 67 KB/second (1452051 / 21 / 1024).

  A quad speed CD-ROM _should_ be able to read 600 KB/second (4 * 150). 
Obviously, this isn't the case with any of the filesystems I've tested.
The performance may however boost with different CD0: mountlist parameters.
This hasn't been tested because no filesystem's documenation mentions
AppleCD 600e preferable settings.

DOCUMENTATION

  71 pages of printed assistance is what Apple has put into the package,
besides all commercial pamphlets, warrenty cards et cetra.  The
documentation probably covers everything the average Macintosh users needs
to know, from installing the hardware itself to installing the supplied
Macintosh software.  Being an Amiga user, it is hard to rate the
documentation.  On one hand, I could say that the manual is real lousy not
mentioning any of the problems I experienced, on the other hand I could say
this product is intended for users of Apple computers.

  In short terms - an Amiga user may need additional sources of related
documentation to get everything up and running.  Something like this
review.  :)

LIKES

  Once you get to know it, the Apple 600e CD-ROM unit does what it is
supposed to do with no quirks.  'No less, no more' as some would put it.  A
more interesting discussion would be the interface between the CD-ROM and
the Amiga, i.e.  the filesystem.  Whatever the CD-ROM is up to must be
matched by the filesystem.  Now if the filesystem can't keep up with the
CD-ROM in some aspect, we do have a bottle-neck.  'A chain isn't stronger
than its weakest link' as the Swedish saying goes.  This is also the case
with the filesystem you intend to use for the CD-ROM unit.

DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

  Just as I can't find much about the unit itself to like, I don't find
much to dislike neither.  I repeat myself - the unit does what it is
supposed to do with no quirks.  One thing I think should be improved
however, is the location of the headphone jack.  The outlet is placed just
underneath the CD slot which makes it hard to access when the slot is in
its 'outward' position.

  The unit has its power transformer built-in.  In case you own the
original Commodore 1541 5.25" floppy drive, you know what I'm getting at. 
Since the transformer is internal, the unit tends to be quite warm after
some time of usage.  In the case of the C1541, this caused problems when
certain circuits in the drive expanded and shorted out when in contact with
other components.  I don't think this is the case with technology of the
mid 90's, but then again, nothing is wrong with precaution.  Not to mention
the unit gets really dull with a built-in transformer.  (Note: the C1541's
sucessor, the C1541-II has an external transformer.)

COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

  Since I never had the chance to play with CD-ROM equipped Amigas before
besides the CDTV and its cousin the CD32, there isn't much to say here.

BUGS

  At the time of writing no bugs have been found.

VENDOR SUPPORT

  Apple has something they calle 'Apple Assistance'.  You register by
sending your Apple subsidiary or distributor a provided registration sheet.
As soon as Apple validates your registration you get 90 days of free
support per phone, plus either three free issues of Swedish magazine
'Svenska MacWorld' (Swedish MacWorld) or a 45% discount on a full year
subscription of the very same magazine.  Offers similar to this may vary
from country to country.

WARRANTY

  The chain of stores I bought my Apple 600e CD-ROM unit from gives one
year of product warrenty.  Apart from this warrenty, Apple has a world wide
warrenty, also limited to one year.  Apple's warrenty applies to every
country on the face of the Earth, provided you have a proof of purchase
from an authorized Apple dealer.

CONCLUSIONS

  I'm pleased with my purchase.  I've wanted a CD-ROM for my Amiga 3000 for
years, but external SCSI CD-ROM units have always been rather expensive
compared to e.g.  internal IDE CD-ROM units.  This all changed on that
magic sale.  :) The AppleCD 600e works just the way you expect it to work
once you know what normal Amiga 3000 SCSI behavior means.  No quirks, no
fuzz.

===========================================================================

Imagine PD 3D- 
  A CD rom of public domain objects for the Amiga and PC modeler/renderer 
Imagine 3D published by Impulse.

  Graphic Detail
  4556 South 3rd Street
  Louisville, KY 40214
  vox/fax: 502.363.2986
  net: michael@iglou.com

  Graphic Detail has been producing CD roms for the 3D and graphic artist
for some time now.  Amiga Report has reviewed Light Rom volume 3, a similar
volume to Imagine PD 3D, a multiplatform collection of PD objects and
textures for NewTek's LightWave 3D.  This disc contains many of the same
objects converted for use in Imagine.

  The objects are mostly available on the Internet, but the disc brings
them all together for your convenience and ease of use.  Also, since the CD
is multiplatform capable, users of both Amiga Imagine, and PC Imagine can
make use of the disc.  The objects are divided into categories i.e.
Anatomy, Animals, Aviation, Botany, Buildings, Computers, Fonts, Furniture,
Household, Kitchen, Land, Logos, Music, Phones, Robots, Ships, Space,
Sports, Video, Vehicles, Weaponry and more. 

  The objects range in quality from amateur-ish to excellent quality scale
models, all in Imagine format.  Where necessary, the models include IFFs of
textures.  Some of the best models are in the "space" directory, populated
mostly by requisite numbers of craft from Star Trek, Star Wars, etc.  A few
more excellent space models are tucked in the "showcase" directory.  The
showcase features models by the same artist.  Some of the most outstanding
is by Carmen Rizzolo, who has created several outstanding Star Trek models.
I've seen many of Mr.  Rizzolo's animations on the Internet, and recall his
outstanding Arexx contributions to Centaur Development's OpalVision.  If
you use an OpalVision, your Arexx directory is empty without Rizzolo's
handiwork.

  While many of these objects are fun to manipulate and animate, remember
that many of the model designs are subject to the original creator's
copyright.  Most objects include text files detailing how to contact the
modeler.  Also, since most of the objects in the "space" directory are
modeled from existing designs of movie space ships, this precludes you from
using them in any commercial applications, or even your demo reel.  This
shouldn't prevent you from using these models as a starting point for your
own work.  If you're an aspiring modeler, the best way to start out is by
emulating the work of others to define your own style. 

  Also included on the CD is a library of 950 textures in Jpeg Format
originally found on Graphic Detail's 2CD Texture Gallery collection.  There
is an "indexes" directory containing 16 color hi res IFF (and 24bit Targa)
previews of all of the textures by category.  Again, the textures range in
quality, but the ones that are good are quite good.   I'd recommend working
many of these textures over in a paint/image processing program like
ImageFX before applying these graphics to your model work.  Many of these
graphics are quite small, some are from video framegrabs, and all are
Jpegged (which affects overall image quality), but if you apply these onto
a moving model, then these textures will work out fine.

  Of interest in the "textures" directory is a series of bumpmaps created
by R.  McVey (creator of the New Icons WB replacement set, also reviewed in
AR), and features a particularly weird readme file.  3D programs capable of
bumpmapping use greyscale images to "fake" raised and shadowed areas on
objects without actually changing their geometry. 

  Bumpmapping implies detail without actual modeling.  Again, it's a good
technique to use if the viewer will not be dwelling on a particular model.
If the model is on the move, and you apply motion blur, this will hide many
sins.  These bumpmaps tile seamlessly.  Remember, though, that if you tile
a pattern too much, the human eye will pick up on the repeating grid of
patterns.  McVey wisely created the bumpmaps in 4 bits, since often times
8bit details isn't particularly necessary.

  Note, however, that many of these objects require the textures from the
original distribution of Imagine.  This means that those of you who are
using versions of Imagine that were bundled coverdisks will need to buy the
full version of Imagine.  Some objects will also require the Essence series
of textures.  Included are the Essence attribute files for objects that
need them.

  While the disc is well organized, I wish that Graphic Detail had carried
their LIghtROM model further into the production of this CD.  The LightROM
discs have 24bit and 16 color preview thumbnails of all of its objects.
Without the convenience of these thumbnails, you will need to load each
object that you might want to work with into Imagine, and render out your
own previews.  Also, I find it a little odd that the scene featured on the
cover of the disc isn't actually on the CDrom.  It's a frame from a
LightWave scene called "Boomer" and blows up Lightwave's over-used
SpaceFighter object.  It's a good explosion scene, and it's a shame not to
see it here.

  It looks like these objects will load quite nicely into older versions of
Imagine, but it would be nice to see objects included that address some of
Imagine's newer abilities i.e.  Blobby modeling. 

  It's nice to see Imagine owners getting some attention.  With so much
attention focused on Lightwave (even though NewTek's attention isn't
especially focused on the Amiga these days), it's unfortunate to have
programs like Aladdin 4D, Cinema 4D, and Imagine.  These programs make good
use of the Amiga's abilities and still make us all capable of doing
respectable work.  If you are a new or a seasoned Imagine user, this CD
will come in handy.  While there is a range of quality in the overall
contents of the CD, the average Imagine user will undoubtedly get some use
out of it.

===========================================================================

Light ROM Gold

  A CD ROM collection of Objects, Textures, and utilities for NewTek's 
Modeler/Animator LightWave.  

  Graphic Detail
  4556 South 3rd Street
  Louisville, KY 40214
  vox/fax: 502.363.2986
  net: michael@iglou.com

  The Amiga has a rich history of an exceptionally active shareware/public
domain community.  After NewTek's release of the revolutionary Video
Toaster, and the subsequent success of LIghtWave 3D, the Amiga community
responded with megabytes upon megabytes of re-distributable objects.
Instead of you shaking down the Internet trying to find these objects,
Graphic Detail's Light ROM series has become a vital resource in hunting
these objects down.

  There have been three volumes in the LightROM series totalling over 6,000
objects.  Volumes came out every six months or so, and were cummulative;
volume three contained all of the objects from volume one.   This means
that volumes one and two on my shelf aren't really useful any more.
Graphic Detail must have agreed with me because Light ROM 4 will contain
all new material.  Hence Light ROM Gold.  This "Gold" disc has the best of
the previous three collections in anticipation of this all new volume 4.

  Material on this CD is culled from the Public Domain, though several
items are exclusive to the CD.  The contents of the CD are laid out twice:
once for LightWave 3.5 users, and again for LW 4.0 and up users.  LW 4.0
and later has a little-used facility: the Content Directory.  This works
much like setting up an "assign" in your Amiga's startup sequence.  Simply
input CD0: as your content directory, and you can wave bye-bye to that
pesky "object not found" window.  LW 3.5 users can simply load up their
scenes off of the CD by going to the disc's LW3_5 directory.

  This is a multiplatform CD, and with LightWave's migration to PC, SGI,
and now Mac and Sun, an investment in this CD can really pay off no matter
where you work.  The objects are categorized into Anatomy, Animals,
Aviation, Botany, Buildings, Furniture, Holidays, Groceries, Logos, Music,
Robots, Ships, Sports, Space, Toys, Vehicles, Video, and more.  Upon
entering these categorical directories, you simply choose a scene file, and
all of the objects and textures will load into LightWave.  There's also an
"objects" directory that has objects with no associated scene files.

  To aid you in object selection, there's a directory full of rendered
mini- thumbnails.  These are usually a 3/4 view of the object in living
color.  Also indexed in "thumbnails" is another directory of interest: the
"Showcase" directory.  This directory features the work of various
LightWave artists.  These include work by Dean Scott who has created
replicas of the Babylon 5 station and associated ships.  Also you can
peruse the work of Erik Flom who's demo reel is so excellent, that I use it
as an example of superior work in my video class. 

  Also on the CD is a tutorial directory with a massive textfile of
tutorials, and some tutorial objects teaching metaform concepts.  Also,
peer into the LightWave Plug-ins directory.  This is one of the new
features of LW 4.0 and up.  Plug-ins are sub-programs that work from within
LW.  They do everything from sophisticated texture mapping, to adding
complex collision detection to LightWave.  There's an Arexx directory with
some of the best Arexx work ever written for the Amiga.   These Arexx
scripts automate the creation of objects, move entire scenes and change all
associated paths, even automatically explode objects and create the
animated scene path!

  Wow!  What's not to like?  Not much.  The CD is well organized, and the
majority of objects are of outstanding quality.  Even the objects that are
a little simplified serve as excellent starting points for your own work. 
Many is the time that I've had a deadline breathing down my neck, and I've
been able to reach over and grab a LightROM, and use an object there as a
template for my own work.  Get this disc and, like me, you can eagerly
anticipate LightROM 4.

  Bohus Blahut- Modern Filmmaker                           bohus@xnet.com
===========================================================================

Multimedia Backdrops- 
  A CD rom with 100 backdrops intended for multimedia and video in 24bit IFF, 
Targa, and Tiff formats in both NTSC (752 x 480 [Toaster FrameStore size]) and 
PAL (768 x 576) sizes.

  Graphic Detail
  4556 South 3rd Street
  Louisville, KY 40214
  vox/fax: 502.363.2986
  net: michael@iglou.com

  This multiplatform CD contains duplicate directories of 100 multimedia
backgrounds in three popular formats, cutting down your need for conversion
software.  These backgrounds are usually composed to allow for text in the
foreground, and are there to add some visual interest to the overall
composition.  These backgrounds are usually fairly abstract and drawn in
muted colors so as not to call much attention to themselves.   It used to
be that if you wanted to spice up your presentation with special
backgrounds, you'd have to budget in time to create something on your own.
Then, CD roms like this one came along with the promise of lightening the
load, but does it?

  All 100 backgrounds are indexed in an "indexes" directory, each with a
color thumbnail representation.  Once you've chosen the image that you
require, you load it from the IFF, Targa, or Tiff directory.  The backdrops
are stored in both NTSC and PAL sizes, with the images in the NTSC
directory measuring in at 752 x 480, which is the same size as a Video
Toaster FrameStore.  This makes these backgrounds perfect for use in
ToasterCG, Montage 24, AlphaPaint, ImageFX, Monument Designer, etc..  
Aside from video titling, multimedia softwares like Scala and AmigaVision
could make good use of this disc.

  A good number of these backdrops look like they started life as 6-bit HAM
images.  For use in Amiga specific applications, one could reduce some of
these "24bit" pictures back down to HAM or perhaps even 256 colors, but for
use in video you'll probably need to work some of these backdrops over. 

  I performed a color count in ImageFX on some of the grainier textures in
the collection.  On the average I got around 100,000 colors; half of the
color resolution of 8-bit HAM.  Since these pictures aren't depicting
anything with wide ranges of color, 100,000 distinct colors would normally
be enough.  However, these pictures have quite a lot of posterizing in
them, so despite the color count, there aren't any fine gradation of color
in the images. 

  To get these textures to where I wanted them, I performed an IFX Gaussian
Blur or two.  You may just want to use these textures as a basis for
something that you'll create.  Some of the backdrops look like they'll tile
fairly well for applications like Web design, animated backdrops, and use
in 3D modeling and animation.  There's a good assortment of marble
backdrops with vertical marble bars for text, nature themed backgrounds,
abstract shapes, and shots of the earth. 

  While the thumbnails go a long way to help the user choose an appropriate
background for the project, it would be beneficial if the files had
individual names, and perhaps were in categorized directories.   As it
stands now, the files just have numeric monikers.  I'm more likely to
remember that my favorite background is METAL.IFF than 056.

  All in all there seems to be an even split between the good files and the
grainy ones.  Yeah, there's a bunch of good images, but if you've got your
heart set on a particular file that isn't one of the 24bit chosen few, you
may have some work ahead of you.

@node REVIEW6 "Review: DirOpus 5.5 Part 2"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                        DirOpus 5.5 Review: Part 2
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Last issue, we examined the basics of DirOpus 5.5, the extremely extensive
file management package.  This time around, I'd like to look at some of the
specifics of the configuration to give you a feel as to how it can work for
you.

There are a number of configuration windows in DirOpus, owing to just how
much you have at your disposal to work with.  (I cringe to think what
planning out the software must have been like.)  In a way, DirOpus 5.5 can
be looked upon as partially a clearinghouse for an assortment of functions
that previously only came from a combination of commodities.

"Docks" or "button bars" can be created at will, in whatever quantities you
like.  And unlike some docks, they can be iconified, edited, or closed from
their own toolbar.  DOpus 5.5 comes with a sampling of these constructs,
and the built-in editor is extremely straightforward to use.

Your "Environment" editor allows you to change some basics of the
interface's operation--how big default windows should be, what the
screenmode should be, what the pattern on the screen should be, etc.
Setting screen and WBPattern options can be confusing at first since you
will need to make use of the original Workbench tools in some cases, but it
becomes straightforward after one or two tries.

Under "Environment" are a set of configuration options to set up built-in
filetype recognition and action, the configuration for the User Menu (a
pulldown menu in the title bar), and a set of event scripts (so you can do
useful or funny things when certain things occur, like the insertion of a
disk or the opening of a window).

The real power in all of this configuration is the ease with which you can
get DirOpus to do your bidding, thanks to a set of built-in commands.
Instead of having to call AmigaDOS or external programs, DirOpus will run
an internal routine in response to a button press or a menu call.  Some of
these are certainly not indispensible, being superceded by superior and
just as easy-to-use programs already out there.  Still, having them readily
available in the option scroller, and easy to integrate thanks to the
configure tools, is quite a benefit.  Then there are those quite a bit more
reasonable to use (does anybody really understand why the AmigaDOS format
command is so awkward?)

Overall, the great thing about using DirOpus5 is the sense of
limitlessness.  Your actions on the Workbench are no longer limited by the
need to finish certain tasks before being able to work in other windows,
thanks to the multithreading.  The amount of pull-down menus you can create
is basically without bound, as are the options you can put in there.  Open
as many button bars or drive listers as you like.  It's this sort of thing
that makes Amiga users enjoy their computers--the feeling that nobody is
telling them that they're trying to do something that they shouldn't want
to.  But DirOpus 5.5 is more than just a statement, it's a really unique
combination of file and directory management tool, Workbench enhancer, and
commodity replacement, all in one.

Worth mentioning at this point is the exceptionally well done manual.  For
starters, it's huge, over 250 pages with a decent index.  But the
explanations and descriptions within are very straightforward and easy to
comprehend.  And it makes nailing out the nuances of configuration a lot
easier.

Is it for you?  Like I said in my first review, DOpus 5 takes some getting
used to.  Particularly if you have a well decked out system already, you
may be reluctant to retool your configuration to use DOpus 5's built-in
enhancements.  Yes, it uses a good chunk of memory.  Memory is also pretty
cheap these days, and I'd say that the performance benefits are worth the
cost.

DirOpus 5.5 is a unique piece of Amiga software, and you'd be doing
yourself a favor to give it some serious thought.

                        Amiga Report Mailing List
===========================================================================

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to majordomo@ninemoons.com

Your subject header will be ignored.  In the body of the message, enter

subscribe areport

The system will automatically pull your e-mail address from the message
header.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!             **

                          UUDecoding Amiga Report
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

                      Amiga Report Writing Guidelines
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

     4.  Please send us your article in ASCII format.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.

Please stipulate as well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to

                    CalWeb: The Home of the Amiga Zone!
===========================================================================

AMIGA ZONE MOVES TO CALWEB!

THE AMIGA ZONE MOVES FROM PORTAL TO CALWEB INTERNET SERVICES

For over ten years the Amiga Zone has been an online resource, home,
community, oasis, for Amiga owners.

For over ten years I've made my living running the Zone and supporting Amiga
users all over the USA, Canada, and the world.

Five years ago when American People/Link pulled their own plug, we had to
find the Zone a new home and we found a good one on the Portal Online
System. 

Well, it's happened again.. Portal has informed all of its customers that
its ten year history as an online service and Internet provider is coming to
an end on Sept. 30, 1996.  This is very sad, it's short-notice, and the
decision is completely out of my control, but it's also irreversible.  

Portal is changing its entire business plan from being an ISP to selling an
accounting system to other online services.  

So be it. It's sad, but like I said, the Zone went through this before and
now we'll go through it again, and come out the other side better and wiser.

THE AMIGA ZONE IS MOVING TO CALWEB INTERNET SERVICES.

CalWeb (http://www.calweb.com) is a two year old Internet provider located
in Sacramento, CA.  It has a good sized customer base, and very
knowledgeable support staff. 

It's also run by a long time Amiga owner who has been a friend of mine for
many years.

The world of modeming has changed much in the last ten years.  In 1985 you
had very few choices and you had 1200 baud.  These days, everyone and his
dog has an ISP running and a web page

But the vast majority of those providers don't know an Amiga from a hole in
the ground, and could care less about Amiga owners.  Say "AWeb" or
"IBrowse" to them and they'll say "Omega?  Amoeba?  What?  Huh?  They still
make those things?"

CalWeb is different because it's the new home of the Amiga Zone.

In October 1996, a new custom front-end menued system will be added to
CalWeb to host the Zone.  It'll have features for Zone users that neither
Plink nor Portal ever had nor were they willing to add.

The tradition of a friendly online Amiga community, run by long time Amiga
owners, users and lovers will continue. 

Message bases, huge file libraries (we plan to move over the 20,000+ files
we have on the Zone on Portal to CalWeb, MANY of which you'll never see on
Aminet or anywhere else), live nightly chats, vendor support and our famous
prize contests will continue.

We've given away tens of thousands of dollars worth of Amiga prizes in the
last ten years.  No one else even comes close. 

I urge any and all of you who were on Plink, or who are now on Portal or
who may have left Portal..  or even if you were never on either but used or
still use another online service to join CalWeb for the Amiga Zone.  I
personally promise you the best online Amiga community we can possibly
build.  You will not be disappointed.


CalWeb has arranged a special signup offer for you!

Call:
 1-800-509-9322
  or
 1-916-641-9320
  or telnet to calweb.com, login as "guest", and follow the prompts. 

You can join CalWeb for US$19.95 flat, a month.

CalWeb takes major credit cards or you can establish a monthly invoiced
account if you don't have plastic.

The signup is FREE.

To get this deal you must say "THE AMIGA ZONE SENT ME" when you call or
signup online. 

I hope to see lots of you join CalWeb.  You can telnet into it from
anywhere for no hourly charges at all.  Your $19.95/mo fee covers
everything and also gets you ten meg of storage which includes hosting your
own personal web page.  Naturally, when the Zone opens there, you'll have
unlimited use of all of its features and areas.  Never a "money meter"
clock to worry about.

Your personal or business CalWeb Web pages are maintained by you via FTP. 
It's pretty slick.  You can make a net connection to the server with any
Amiga FTP client, put your files onto it, the permissions are automatically
set (no "chmod-ing" required!) and flip to your running browser and see the
changes instantly.

The Amiga Zone's new home is already up at:

         http://www.amigazone.com

running on CalWeb's server.  Ckeck it out!

Please feel free to write to me at harv@amigazone.com or harv@cup.portal.com
if you want more information.

Remember to say "THE AMIGA ZONE SENT ME!" when you join.

A splendid time is guaranteed for all.  

Please plan to join us in the Amiga Zone on CalWeb!
