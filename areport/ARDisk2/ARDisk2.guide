Notes From the Editor
By:  Jason Compton (jcompton@bbs.xnet.com)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

All right, here we are, Issue 2 and plugging along nicely.  I've even kept
my promise to make it AmigaGuide.

Of course, it's still not polished and perfect yet, and I apologize.  I'm
not the greatest at getting around to prettying things up.

Thanks to everyone for sticking with Amiga Report through two of the most
delayed issues in our history.  All I can say is: it'll never happen 
again.  Sorry it did in the first place.

Thanks also to everyone who responded so positively to AR's first
coverdisk.  Hopefully, this issue will keep you just as satisfied.

In other news...nobody has any solid news about Commodore.  Unfortunately.

In AR-related news, Amiga Report was featured (briefly) with a screen
shot in August's Amiga Shopper magazine...I haven't seen it yet, but I'm
told we're mentioned in a brief piece on Internet magazines.  Still, a
screenshot is a screenshot, and as far as I know marks the first time AR's
been mentioned in a true-print publication.  It won't be the last, though,
since I've just accepted an offer to review games for Amiga Game Zone.
Rest assured, I'll do everything I can to promote my "home" magazine.

Keep reading, and enjoy the stuff on the disk.

Jason

An excellent "catchall" commodity, sporting several Intuition enhancements,

means that I've removed the non-English documentation/catalogs/installs

2.  UPSey 1.1 (Colin F. Thompson)  
---------------------------------

Submitted directly by the author.  UPSey, a commodity, will convert ZIP
codes to UPS Zones.  Useful if you're doing a lot of business with UPS,
obviously.  Does not include cities other than San Diego, but detailed
instructions are included for creating your own databases.

3.  XenoStar Demo (AGE Entertainment Software)
----------------------------------------------

Remember SiniStar in the arcades?  THIS IS IT.  Well, it's about as close
as it can get, except that the voice isn't QUITE as scary as I remember.
An incredibly fun, incredibly PLAYABLE game.  Don't miss it.

4.  Reactor (Bowie J. Poag)
---------------------------

Instead of the blue picture from last issue, Poag blows something up in
shocking red.  At least, it looks like he's blowing something up.  Done
again in his distinctive style.

In closing, all I want you to do is have fun with the software and get
it out to other people who will have fun as well.  That's really what 
this computer thing is all about, isn't it?

Another AR disk will be forthcoming.  Submissions and suggestions are
always welcome.
