%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Commodore is still in business. The employees there working away, even
working on the future AAA machine. They are still getting their paychecks.
Commodore is still producing A4000s, A1200s, CD32s, and other devices.

That's what I >>do<< know. What I don't know is how C= is taking care
of their financial difficulties. Supposedly they have been meeting with
their creditors. We just don't have any news on what exactly is going
to happen.

Alot of rumors have been spread around, mentioning take-overs, buy-outs,
and all sorts of speculative things. The best I can tell you from the
information I am getting is that C= will continue...maybe a bit slower,
until they get some sort of financial help.

I doubt there will be a buy-out. Most likely another company will help
with C= 's finances. I'm thinking Hewlitt Packard here. Commodore has
been working with them in the past, and it looks like they will be
working with them for some time yet. 

So hang in there...and PLEASE don't believe everything you read!
Heck! Discount my comments if you wish. But the best bet would be
to just stick with what Commodore puts out officially.

In the MAY issue of Internet World, Amiga Report was mentioned.
If you haven't seen it, I suggest you un out now and get yourself
a copy. Aaron Weiss (mw12@crux2.cit.cornell.edu) did a fantastic 
job placing the Amiga among the members of the Internet.
Aaron went through and described just about everything of interest
to Amiga users in the article, from Networking to the World-Wide-Web.

I would personally like to thank Aaron, and Internet World as well.

P.S. Aaron said to look for jokes on some of the screen shots.

OK.....I'll shut up...you just enjoy!

Hello.  I've decided to change the title of my editorial column to this,
compt.sys.amiga, since it was more clever.

To start, the CD32.  Ahh, what a nice machine.  A group of friends were
kind enough to buy me one for my birthday.  Luckily, they were kind
enough to buy Liberation as well, otherwise I'd have a $400 CD player.
Inside was the notorious coupon, good for Microcosm and Chaos Engine,
in "6-12 weeks for processing".  Grrr.  Ok, well, I'll give CEI a call to
see if the situation is better than that (the coupon was from CEI).  Ring,
ring. I ask the question, and eventually get the answer that it's 6-12 
weeks and they're backordered.  Actually, what it boils down to is that 
it's 6-12 weeks, backordered because Commodore hasn't sent them ANY yet.
They reserved the right to change the titles, too...lucky them, since they
have no titles to give away at all.

I had a point in the middle of all this.  Actually, a question.  I'm 
trying to get in touch with MicroBotics about their SX-1 expansion that 
gives a CD32 a serial, parallel, disk drive, etc. port along with a couple
of IDE controllers, RGB port, a SIMM slot, and the all-important audio in 
for karaoke enthusiasts.  Unfortunately, the Texas automated operator 
tells me that the number which Amazing Computing, my local dealer, and
Amigaman claim belongs to MB: 214-437-5330, is not a working number.
Same goes for their fax line.  Now, neither I nor anyone else I've 
talked to thinks they're suddenly out of business, but I would like to
get a hold of them soon, so if anyone can guide me, please do so.

To answer a few rumors, namely that no Commodore stocks were 
available for sale Friday because of a change of corporate ownership...
C= traded as usual this past Monday morning.  So much for that
report.

I've gotten a few more answers back about 24-bit boards...but no
boards yet.  GVP and DKB have told me "Not right now"-GVP 
because all of their review Spectrums are out, DKB because they
don't have any Talons available for review in the first place.
MacroSystems US and Expert Services have both told me yes,
but have been rather slow in furnishing any dates, let alone
hardware.  No answer from Centaur about the OpalVision.

That does it for random thinking this week.  Keep someone warm.

%% The Power of Positive Thinking!                    by Dennis Julien %%

Remember the days of old  when  you  could log  on to most  any  bulletin
board system and engage in a hands down, one on twenty battle  with MSDOS
users and emerge victorious?  I do.  There  was  nothing more  satisfying
that pounding away at the keyboard, on a mission to educate; a calling to
elevate the Amiga to the level of admiration it deserved,  and  a  worthy
system it was!   I remember the resulting awe once  information  such  as
'4096 colors' and 'multitasking' had been divulged.   EGA, and  even  VGA
seemed pale in  comparison.   4-channel stereo sound,  a  graphical  user
interface, and a special chipset for processing duties were all qualities
that could be proclaimed endlessly...

    Of course, that was several years ago.   A  new leaf has been turned.
The Amiga, once known as a  'games machine'  is now  a  video  production
machine.   The IBM,  once known as a stiff,  business-executive  tool  of
slavery, is  now  a  platform  yeilding some of the best games, graphics,
and sound tools around.  Slowly but surely,  the  archaic  Intel  systems
of days gone by have evolved into a very powerful and formidable opponent
for the beloved Amiga.

    "Bah!  Untrue...", some of the remaining Amiga die-hards can be heard
shouting.  I am one of them.  Unfortunately,  the  reality begins to sink
in.  Of course, despite the leaps and  bounds  the  Intel-based  machines
have achieved, I still prefer my old Amiga 500.  However, I have  had  to
reorganize my relentless attack of the IBM...   Doom?   Who cares.   I've
got MegaBallAGA,  so take that!   Such comments are familiar to the loyal
Amiga owners unwilling to let go.   Commodore isn't in financial trouble!
They've been selling CD32 units at over 20,000 per month in Europe!   The
fact is  that  Commodore does appear  to  be  facing  some  very  serious
troubles, and because of it I've had to fight  off  more  arguments  than
Howard Stern will likely have to face to become governor.  Here is a good
template for all those still insistent on arguing the cause of the Amiga:

1) Price:  Mention price at every turn.   Around here, the A1200 is  $499
           without tax.  Neglect to mention that  this doesn't  come with
           a monitor or HD.  Tell them 2 megs of CHIP  RAM  is  equal  to
           at least 4 on the IBM.  They'll never know!

2) Professional Use:  Always include  things  like,  "Hey,  it  was  good
                      enough  for  Wayne's  World!"  in   the   argument.
                      Quickly  change  the subject  if it  comes up  that
                      IBM systems are used everywhere, for everything.

3) WorkBench:  WorkBench is still the best operating system around.   Use
               tidbits like the funtions available  using  icons,  screen
               flipping, commodities, etc.   Utilitize the  senselessness
               of Windows in your attempts to assimilate.

4) Compatibility:  Emulation is a key factor.  Mention  that both IBM and
                   Macintosh disks can be read  by  the  Amiga.   Mention
                   that both systems can be  emulated.   Mention  nothing
                   about price or glitches with emulation.

5) Lie:  Finally, lying is of the utmost  importance.   "I can run  15-20
         programs in the background, download  a  file, print  a  report,
         copying files from harddrive to disk,  and  play  a sound module
         without *any* slowdown..."  (Demonstrate only a module and maybe
         a directory listing on a 68000 for best results...)

    Inevitably the next little while will be a new beginning or beginning
of the end for Commodore.   It  would  be a  terrible shame to see such a
great computer fall to a tragic end, and more notably, it would be tragic
for  me  to  have  to spend my days using MSDOS.  You can do your part by
plugging the Amiga  here  and  there.   I  read somewhere about calling a
number for Electronics Boutique to annoy  them  into  carrying  the CD32.
Ironically enough, I went into newly opened store  in  my  hometown,  and
there was no Amiga software to be found.  Asking if there would be any in
the future, I was met with a "Probably.   About  20  people  have been in
during the last few days asking for it and the CD32."  Really?

    With this article coming to a close, you may still be wondering where
the point to all of it is.  To tell you the  truth,  I'm  not  sure.   "A
Clockwork Orange" is playing in the background,  and  I'm bored.  I think
the moral however, is this:  While Commodore may  be  buckling, the Amiga
community is still willing to support their computer.   It  is  important
that the Amiga continues to thrive with the help of hardware and software
developers, along with the help of a quite-large userbase...

The Amiga Report contest is still going on, and it is not too
late to enter. This ongoing monthly contest allows Amiga Report
readers a chance to win software by either solving a puzzle or by
entering a random drawing. The prize this month is the Amiga/Toaster
Reference Manual v2.221, from Area52. This is a 1,000 page help
system for the Amiga and Video Toaster, covering the Workbench,
AmigaDOS, Lightwave, and more ($34.95 value). Also, as a second
prize, we are offering Merrill Callaway's ARexx Guide, a disk based
hypertext manual about using ARexx ($24 value). All monthly contests
end on the morning of the first of the following month. Any entries
beyond this date will be entered into the next contest.

To enter the random drawing, select a number from 1 to 262,144
and send it to me at one of my addresses listed below, either by
the postal service or email through the Internet.

Also, you may enter by solving the following puzzle. The winner
of this puzzle will be decided within the same time frame as the
random prize, to allow the contest information to filter through the
networks, and to allow your letters and postcards to come in.

         The ASCII table contains the alphabetic characters from A
     to Z, in sorted order. This character set is the basis for many
     languages, and should be common knowledge to anyone reading this.
     However, there exists a commonly used set of 26 characters, using
     these letters, in non-sorted order. Each character appears once
     and only once. In this non-sorted set, some of the characters do
     appear in alphabetic order, however there exist two characters
     which appear in reverse-sorted order. Where is this set found,
     and what are the two characters?


To enter, simply let your fingers do the talking and type up an
email and send it to dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu, or send a post
card or letter to:

        Amiga Report Contest
        c/o David Tiberio
        6 Lodge Lane
        East Setauket, NY 11733

In your letter or email, please provide the following:

Your full name and address. Please keep in mind that many of
you may have addresses that I am not accustomed to, so please include
your country or any other information that I would need in case to
win. An email address should also be included, if possible.

You must also include a one sentence or "short answer" explanation
of the editorial content from the editor, Rob Niles, or any stand-in
editor, in the issue in which you read about this contest. You must
also include the issue number. For example, if you read this in
AR213, then include that in your correspondance. Also, the prize winner
will be determined by a random number generator. Choose a number from
1 to 262,144. The closest winner or winners to the randomly generated
number will receive the prize in the mail. Anyone who does not provide
a number will have one assigned to him randomly.


     DISCLAIMER: This contest is being provided as a service to the
     Amiga community and all persons involved in running this contest
     cannot be held liable for anything that costs you money or
     lifetime pain and anguish. Rules are subject to change. All entries
     must be received by April 30th, 1994. Any entries beyond this date
     will be entered into the next contest, if any.


Odds of winning are approximately 1:40 for the random drawing and
1:15 for the correct answer to the puzzle, based upon current entries.

SPECIAL THANKS to Merrill Callaway for donating a copy of his ARexx

Dear Robert,

I'd like to say how annoyed I get when I download some neat sounding file 
from AMINET only to find that when I unarc it, out comes an IFF image which 
is to say the least:-

           H    H U    U  GGGG  EEEEEE  !!
           H    H U    U G    G E       !!
           H    H U    U G      E       !!
           HHHHHH U    U G      EEEE    !!
           H    H U    U G  GGG E       !!
           H    H U    U G    G E
           H    H  UUUU   GGGGG EEEEEE  !!


Recently I downloaded some info on how to rig up IBM floppys to Amigas.  When 
I unarced it out popped this picture. A 2408 x 3196 pixel 2-colour IFF image.  
Unfortunately my poor A2000 with 1Mbyte of Chip ram (4meg fast) spat the 
dummy at this and refused to show it because there was not enough CHIP RAM.  
I took the picture to work and loaded it into Graphics Workshop on my 486 PC 
and displayed it.  Believe it or not, it was nothing more than a scanned 
picture of a hand drawn diagram showing pin connections between the AMIGA 
drive port and the pins on the header of the PC drive!  It could easily have 
been done in ASCII and saved me some agro but the guy had to show everyone 
how cleaver he was and SCANNED it in with his scanner.

This is not the first time this kind of thing has happened but I hope it will 
be the last.  Through Amiga Report I would like to send a plea to all those 
happy little Vegemites out there who own a scanner.  If you must scan a 
picture then PLEASE use a realistic resolution.  Scanning an A4 page 
at 300 dpi is not realistic because you'll end up with an image that is 2480 
pixel wide!  The screen is only 640 wide! If you scan at 50dpi, then an image 
of an A4 page will be around 413 pixels wide which I will be able to display.

It really is a bit rich having to admit that my PC was able to display the 
images when my AMIGA couldn't.

I'll start this week with what has unfortunately become a rare visit to the 
realm of IBM Bridgeboarding.

Rock around the doubled clock...
------------------------------

GMR Productions/Vortex Worldwide is (I hope) proud to announce that they
make a 486SLC2 50mhz bridgeboard for the Amiga now.  It sports the
usual Vortex BB equipment (IDE HD controller, software screen emulation
to 16 col VGA [I have no idea if they've gone AGA], serial/parallel/mouse/
keyboard support, SIMM slots, and the ever-important onboard PC
speaker), 2.5 megs of RAM and a rather fast SLC2/50 chip.  The price?  
Well, until May, it's $999.  Not exactly a drop in the bucket, but not an
entirely bad price for a bridgeboard.  Call them at 718-967-1509 for more
particulars.  

I should have a review of this board for you very soon, since a friend
has decided to chuck her 486/66 for a 4000/040 and this board.
But for now, the MacWars are calling.

A-Max IV and the art of running it
--------------------------------

As promised, here's an up-close look at A-Max IV's control window, all
11 buttons of it..
Video:  Allows you to configure your various video devices (standard Amiga
video and whatever display cards you may have) and their screenmodes
for A-Max use.  Here is also where the screen refresh options lie:  
instead of Emplant's frames-per-second selections, you get two "radio 
buttons" and a gadget.  The "Accurate" radio selection is the recommended 
one, presumably for authenticity, and the "Optimised" button can speed
operation but distort display.  The option gadget "paranoid" is for use
for Mac programs that do not display at all-it will fix the problem but
slow the overall performance.  "Optimised" and "paranoid" allow you to
change the rate at which the screen is refreshed.

Memory:  A-Max allows for Amiga memory to be shared between the
emulation and Amiga-at least, the emulation gets it on demand.  It
doesn't have to, however-the "Use External Memory" option decides it.
If you choose to lock in a memory size, be it for a program which reads
free memory in an odd way or just because you've never liked to share,
you can allocate specific amounts of memory to the INIT sequence and
to the booted system.  The last option, "Best Fit" is described as making
as much free memory available as possible at the expense of using
slow chip memory.  I haven't noticed much either way.

Multitasking:  Here, the priority may be set.  ReadySoft recommends you
not go above 15: I keep it at 8 for most things.  Wait in Foreground, in
essence, makes sure that if the Mac is selected but not doing anything,
the Amiga gets the unused system time.  It has a box for input of the
timeout delay.  The option Wait in Background makes sure that if the
Amiga is selected and the Mac is idle, the Amiga gets the system time.

Simple enough.

General:  Just an option to select whether or not unrecognized double
density floppies should be formatted IBM by the Mac and whether a right
mouse button click should be interpreted like a left or like a 
double-click.

Device:  This is where the Amiga devices desired for A-Max are assigned.
In addition to the hard drive and DF0, by default the "file device" A-Max
Utilities is listed.  File devices are AmigaDOS files which by default
reside in a DEVS: directory which the MacOS thinks are 800k disks.
A-MaxUtilities has the File Transfer IV program in it.  The file devices
are created by A-Max's double density floppy conversion program.  The
menu also allows selection of mounted and booted devices and the
ability to delete old file devices and the like.

SCSI:  Pretty much a run of the mill "pick the SCSI IDs in use and give
us the driver" menu.  It also allows you to select the type of memory the
emulation will use to communicate with the SCSI device.

Networking:  The option to configure the driver for your Ethernet card
or the like for A-Max's benefit.

Serial/Parallel:  Configures A-Max's port emulation.  Since A-Max comes
with a Mac Printer and Modem/MIDI port, you can choose that the Modem
and Printer support come from either the Amiga ports, the A-Max ports,
or file, in which case all the port's output is directed to an AmigaDOS 
file.

Can someone explain the practicality of this to me?

Save:  Save your configuration
Start A-Max IV:  No-brainer.
Quit:  See "Start A-Max IV"

Dueling Filetransfers...
-------------------
Both A-Max and Emplant provide for transferring files back and forth
between the Amiga and Mac sides.  Interestingly enough, the process
is started on the Mac side with A-Max and the Amiga side with Emplant.
For Emplant, there are two buttons: one from the Mac to the Amiga,
one from the Amiga to the Mac.  Selecting Amiga to Mac brings up the
usual Emplant file requester, at which point a file is selected to 
transfer. Once this is done, the action switches to the Mac side, where 
the user finds somewhere to put it.  If the Mac to Amiga option is picked,
the process is much the same, except that the action immediately switches
to the Mac to choose the file, then back to the Amiga for a path 
destination.

A-Max's process is launched from the Mac, using the aforementioned
File Transfer program in the file device.  The interface allows for more
choices:

Optional translations in text, MacPaint, MacBinary, or PostScript and 
allows you to manipulate the all-important data and resource forks.  The
requesters work much the same way on A-Max as they do for Emplant.

What do I think?  I think the A-Max program works slightly better: I have
run into a few executables which Emplant's transfer turns into plain 
documents. A-Max hasn't done that.  Both are restricted to one file at a 
time, which is not something many people are happy about.

Dueling BENCHMARKS!
-----------------------
I know, I know, you've probably had more Speedometer benchmarks than
you care to think about printed in this magazine, right?  Well, how about
I spare you from the print.  How about I include them as screen shots?
That's right, for your "multimedia" enjoyment, I've included a couple
of screen grabs of the Speedometer comparisons done with Slurp.
The shots are of the Emplant because, interestingly enough, Slurp doesn't
recognize the A-Max screen.  Here are the conditions of the test:

All benchmarks, save video, are done 5 times.  Video are done 3.
No other Amiga programs are running in the background, save WB.
Emplant is running at 0 priority (if you remember, its maximum)
A-Max is running at 0 and 10 priority (indicated in the test)
Benchmarks are conducted with the screenmode black and white.

@{" Show Benchmarks " system "display pic.000"} 

Now...there are a few things you'll notice.  Actually, four.  The Math
composite score for Emplant is much, much larger than A-Max's, and
three math benchmarks come out looking hugely in favor of the
Emplant.  I am not a benchmark expert, nor am I a real programmer.
I can say this, though, with a large degree of confidence.  One of two
things is happening.  Either Emplant's emulation has some incredibly
efficient routines for these tests, or Speedometer is getting reports 
which, by accident or by design, are horribly erroneous.

Next time around, I'll run tests of the Amiga's free time while the 
emulations do something or another Mac-like.

Despair and Graphical Analysis: The Bad Boys of Mac Emulation
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Remember them?  They're the programs that wouldn't run under Emplant.
Well, they don't under A-Max either.  Actually, when I tried to extract
Despair under A-Max, I got errors, leading me to believe that it was 
really corrupted after all.  But Graphical Analysis shows the same 
problems as Emplant:  corrupted text that makes it worthless.  (It DID 
work under A-Max II)

Sound-Trecker:  Now why would I want to play MODs on a Mac emulator?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
I can now confidently report that Sound Trecker works on both Emplant
and A-Max.  A-Max, just as Emplant does, loses so much Mac time to
the job of playing the music that just moving the Mac pointer fast throws
it off.  The problem is slightly more noticable with the Emplant, however.
The A-Max also allows more time to the Amiga user than Emplant does.
Remember, of course, the A-Max was at Priority 8 (my usual).

Emplant and A-Max IV and honesty
--------------------------------
One of the interesting things about Emplant is that in the "About
This Macintosh" screen, the emulation refers to itself as a Mac
roughly equivelant to its processor.  To my 3000 030/25, that
means calling itself a Mac IIci.  Not far off, I'd say.  On the other
hand, however, ReadySoft figured they'd go right to the throat and
seemingly identify everything as a Mac Quadra 950.  So much for
subtlety.

Putting the Mac out of its misery
---------------------------------
Every now and then, for whatever reason, one of these fine products
is going to crash pretty bad, to the point where the emulation is locked
up and doesn't want to shut down normally.  Emplant provides a 
"TURN POWER OFF" Amiga-side option, which will basically yank
the plug on the emulator as though it were suddenly turned off.  Not
a great idea, but better than a lockup using up tons of memory.  A-Max
IV supports the use of control-alt-esc to quit programs (including
Finder) on the Mac side.  I'd have to say the Emplant wins through sheer
brute force and effectiveness, but the option to selectively do it is 
nice.

A PowerPC sandwich, anyone?
-----------------------
I've been picking up some rather interesting pieces of news about the
PowerPC.  Ronny G. Nordvik (nordvik@edb.uib.no) has this to say:
"An Amiga 4000/040 with Emplant (Without X-calibur accelerator) is by 12
of 18 tests results better than an Power Macintosh (PowerPC 8100/80).

SoftWindows sucks, Ok you can run small programs, but with 1.2 MB free
RAM you cannot run bigger ones. Total memory for the PowerPC was 16MB.

My suggestion is WAIT WAIT WAIT, do not buy PowerMacintosh............"

How does he back it up?  (can anybody feel the benchmark coming on?)

[Sorry, no screenmarks were given for the PPC, as well as no FPU
routines, but that's because the PPC doesn't HAVE one.]

So where does the end-all be-all in emulation computing, the
PowerPC, lose?  Right off the bat, it loses in CPU rating, 14 to
11.  It loses Towers, Queens, etc.  I count 10 of 16 ratings (I
don't believe in the Speedometer average benchmarks) the
Emplant wins in.  Which computer is offering the cross-
platforming here again?

Another interesting PPC comment:  the theory behind "Will
my software be compatible, and do I HAVE to get a new
machine or upgrade?" is, "Oh, well, we'll package both a PowerPC
and a 680x0 version in every piece of software for the next
x years!"  Are these the same software companies that
sell separate DOS and Windows programs?  Not to mention
paying for extra re-compilings and disks along the line, PowerPC
could easy out-maneuver itself into being unwieldly and
distracting, making running an Emplant or A-Max IV look easy.
One can only hope.

One last thing:  I don't have enough new material for a
continuation of my Apple2000 review this week, but I
will re-print the author's net address.  Contact him with
any questions or comments, particularly if you have hardware
specs for old computer peripherals (like 64s, Apple IIs, etc).
He's Kevin_Kralian@sacbbx.com.  64 information is of particular
interest, as the popular demand is leading him to that emulator
next.  Anything you could provide him would be useful.  He's
also always on the lookout for Atari 400/800, TI, or Atari
VCS specs and information (I, personally, am pulling for
the VCS emulator, but that's just me.)

I thought that, in all fairness, I would clear a few things up.
Apple2000 does NOT, at present, support parallel or serial.
It does not support 80-column mode.  Kralian has told me he will
put these things in if people can send him the specifications
for the hardware used to obtain these things on the Apple.
No Apple floppy support, either.

That does it for this week.  Enjoy the picture and keep the
emulators warm.

MOTOROLA SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCT INFORMATION on the MC68060

Product Brief

Forth-Generation 32-Bit Microprocessor

The  MC 68060 is a  superscalar,  high-performance,  32-bit microprocessor
providing a  low-power mode of operation.  The MC68060 is fully compatible
with all previous members of the M68000 family.  The MC68060 features dual
on-chip caches,  fully independent  demand-paged  memory  management units
(MMUs) for  both instructions and data,  dual integer execution pipelines,
on-chip floating-point unit (FPU),  and branch target cache. A high degree
of instruction execution parallelism is achieved through the use of a full
internal Havard architecture,  multiple internal buses, independent execu-
tion units,  and dual instruction  issue within  the instruction execution
controller.  Power management is also a  key part of the MC68060 architec-
ture.  The MC68060 offers a low-power mode  of operation that  is accessed
through the LPSTOP instruction,  allowing for  full power-down capability.
The MC68060  design is fully static so  that when circuits are not in use,
they do not draw power.  Each unit  can be disabled  so that the  power is
used only when the unit  is enabled and executing an instruction. Figure 1
illustrates a block diagram of the MC68060.

                            INTEGER UNIT

The MC68060's integer unit carries out logical  and arithmetic operations.
The integer unit  contains an instruction  fetch controller,  an execution
controller,  and  a branch  target cache.  The superscalar  design  of the
MC68060  provides  dual execution  pipelines in  the intruction  execution
controller, providing simultaneous execution.

The superscalar operation of the integer unit can be disabled in software,
turning off the second executionpipeline for debugging. Disabling the
superscalar operation also lowers power consumption.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
INSTRUCTION FETCH CONTROLLER

The intruction fetch controller contains an instruction fetch pipeline and
the logic that  interfaces to  the branch  target cache.  The  instruction
fetch pipeline consists  of four stages, providing the ability to prefetch
instructions in advance of their actual use  in the instruction cache con-
troller. The continous fetching of  instructions kepps the instruction ex-
excution controller busy for the greatest possible performance.  Every in-
struction  passes through each of the four  stages before entering the in-
struction execution controller.  The four stages in the  instruction fetch
pipeline are:

1.  Instruction Address Calculation -- The virtual address of the instruc-
    tion is determined.

2.  Instruction Fetch -- The instruction is fetched from memory.

3.  Early Decode -- The instruction  is pre-decoded  for pipeline  control
    information.

4.  Instruction Buffer -- The instruction and  its pipeline control infor-
    mation are buffered until the  integer execution pipeline is  ready to
    process the instruction.


BRANCH TARGET CACHE

The branch target cache plays the major role  in achieving the performance
levels of the MC68060.  The concept of  the branch target cache is to pro-
vide a mechanism that allows the instruction  fetch pipeline to detect and
change the instruction stream  before the change of flow  affects the  in-
struction execution controller.

The branch target  cache is examined for a valid  branch entry  after each
instruction fetch address is  generated in the intruction  fetch pipeline.
If a hit does not occur  in the branch target cache, the instruction fetch
pipeline continues to fetch instructions sequentially.  If a hit occurs in
the branch target cache,  indicating a branch taken instruction,  the cur-
rent  instruction  stream is  discarded  and a new  instruction stream  is
fetched starting at the location indicated by the branch target cache.


INSTRUCTION EXECUTION CONTROLLER

The instruction execution controller contains dual integer execution pipe-
lines,  interface logic to the FPU,  and control logic for data written to
the data cache and MMU.  The superscalar design of the dual integer execu-
tion pipeline provide for simultaneous instruction execution, which allows
the processing more than one  instruction during each machine clock cycle.
The net effect of this  is a software  invisible pipeline capable  of sus-
tained execution rates of less than on machine clock cycle per instruction
for the MC68060 instruction set.

The instruction execution  controller's control logic  pulls an intruction
pair from the instruction buffer every machine clock cycle,  stopping only
if the instruction information is not available or if an integer execution
hold condition exists.  The six stages in the dual integer execution pipe-
lines are:

1.  Instruction decode -- The instruction is fully decoded.

2.  Effective address calculation -- If  the  instruction  calls for  data
    from memory, the location of the data is calculated.

3.  Effective address fetch -- Data is fetched from the memory location.

4.  Integer execution -- The data is manipulated during the execution.

5.  Data available -- The result is available.

6.  Write-Back -- The resulting data  is written back to on-chip caches or
    external memory.

The MC68060 if optimized for most  integer instructions  to execute in one
machine clock cycle.  If during the instruction decode stage, the instruc-
tion  is determined to  be a floating-point instruction, it will be passed
to the  FPU after  the  effective address  fetch stage.  If data  is to be
written to either the on-chip caches or external  memory after instruction

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
execution,  the write-back  stage holds the data  until memory is ready to
receive it. Temporarily holding data  in the write-back  stage adds to the
overall  performance of  the  MC68060 by not slowing  down pipeline opera-
tions.


                            FLOATING-POINT UNIT

Floating-point is  distinguished from  integer math, which deals only with
whole  numbers  and fixed  decimal  point locations.  The  IEEE-compatible
MC68060's FPU computes numeric  calculations with a variable decimal point
locationThe MC68060 features a built-in FPU that is MC68040 and MC68881/82
compatible. Consolidating this  important function on-chip speeds up over-
all processing and eliminates interfacing overhead  associated with exter-
nal accelerators.  The MC68060's FPU operates in parallel with the integer
unit.  The FPU performs numeric calculations while the integer unit conti-
nues integer processing.

The FPU has been optimized  for the most frequently  used instructions and
data types to  provide the highest possible performance.  The FPU can also
be disabled in software to reduce system power consumption.


FLOATING POINT EMULATION

The  MC68060 implements the most  frequently  M68000 family floating-point
instructions,  data-types, and  data formats  in hardware  for the highest
performance. T he remaining instructions are emulated in software with the
M68060FPSP  to provide  complete IEEE  compatibility. The MC68060FPSP pro-
vides the following features:

- Arithmetic and Transcendental Instructions

- IEEE-Compliant Exception Handlers

- Unimplemented Data Type and Data Format Handlers


                          MEMORY MANAGEMENT UNITS

The MC68060 contains independent instruction and data MMUs.  Each MMU con-
tains a cache memory called the address translation cache (ATC).  The full
addressing range  of the MC68060 is  4 Gbytes (4,294,967,296 bytes).  Even
though most  MC68060 systems  implement a much smaller physical memory, by
using virtual  memory techniques,  the system can  appear to have a full 4
Gbytes of physical memory  available to each user program.  Each MMU fully
supports demand-paged  virtual-memory  systems  with  either 4- or 8-Kbyte
page sizes.  Each MMU protects supervisor areas from accesses by user pro-
grams and provides write-protection  on a page-by-page basis.  For maximum
efficiency, each MMU operates in parallel with other processor activities.
The MMUs can be disabled for emulator and debugging support.

ADDRESS TRANSLATION

The 64-entry, four-way,  set-associative ATCs store recently used logical-
to-physical  address translation  information as  page descriptors for in-
struction and data accesses.  Each MMU  initiates address  translation  by
searching for a descriptor containing the  address translation information
in the ATC. If the descriptor does not reside in the ATC, the MMU performs
external bus cycles through  the bus controller to  search the translation
tables in  physical memory.  After being located,  the page  descriptor is
loaded  into the ATC,  and the address is correctly translated for the ac-
cess.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                       INSTRUCTION AND DATA CACHES

Studies have  shown that  typical programs  spend much of their  execution
time in a few main routines of tight loops.  Earlier members of the M68000
family took advantage of  this locality-of-reference phenomenon to varying
degrees.  The MC68060 takes further advantage of cache technology with its
two, independent,  on-chip  physical chaches,  one for instruction and one
for data.  The caches reduce the processor's external bus activity and in-
crease CPU throughput by lowering the effective memory access time.  For a
typical system designm  the large  caches of the MC68060 yield a hery high
hit rate, providing a substantial increase in system performance.

The  autonomous nature  of the  caches allows  intruction-stream  fetches,
data-stream fetches,  and external  accesses to occur  simultaneously with
instruction execution.  For example,  if the MC68060 requires  both an in-
struction access  and an external peripheral access and if the instruction
is resident in the in-chip cache,  the periphal access  proceeds umimpeded
rather than being queued behind the  instruction fetch.  If a data operand
is also  required and it is resident in the data cache, it can be accessed
without hindering  either the instruction  access or the external periphal
access.  The parallelism inherent  on the MC68060 also allows multiple in-
structions  that do not  require any  external accesses to execute concur-
rently while the processor is performing an external access for a previous
instruction.

Each MC68060 cache is 8 Kbytes,  accessed by physical addresses.  The data
can be configured as  write-through or deferred  copyback on a page-basis.
This choice  allows for optimizing the system  design for the high perfor-
mance if deferred copyback is used.

Cachability of data  in each memory page is  controlled by two bits in the
page descriptor.  Cachable pages  can be either write-through or copyback,
with no write-allocate for misses to write-through pages.

The MC68060  implements a  four-entry write buffer  that maximizes  system
performance by  decoupling the  integer pipeline from the  external system
bus.  When needed, the write buffer allows the pipeline to generate writes
every clock cycle,  even if the system bus runs at a slower speed than the
processor.

CACHE ORGANIZATION

The instruction and  data caches are each organized  as 4-way set associa-
tive, with 16-bite lines.  Each line of data has associated with it an ad-
dress tag and  state information  that shows the  line's validity.  In the
data cache,  the state  information indicates  wheter the line is invalid,
valid, or dirty.

CACHE COHERENCY

The MC68060 has the ability to watch or  snoop the external bus during ac-
cesses by other bus masters,  maintaining coherency  between the MC68060's
caches and external memory systems.  External bus cycles can be flagged on
the bus as snoopable or nonsnoopable.  When an external cycle is marked as
snopable,  the bus snooper checks the caches  and invalidates the matching
data.  Although the  integer execution  units and the  bus snooper circuit
have access to the on-chip caches, the snooper has priority over the exec-
ution units.


                              BUS CONTROLLER

The bus  is implemented as  a nonmultiplexed,  fully synchronous  protocol
that is clocked off the rising edge of the input clock. The bus controller
operates  concurrently with  all other functional  units of the MC68060 to
maximize system throughput. The timing of the bus is fully configurable to
match external memory requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                            IEEE 1149.1 TEST

To aid the system diagnostics, the MC68060 includes dedicated user-access-
ible test logic  that is fully compliant with the IEEE 1149.1 standard for
boundary scan testablility,  ofter referred to as Joint Test  Action Group
(JTAG).


                      POWER CONSUMPTION MANAGEMENT


The  MC68060 is  very power  efficient due to  the static logic  and power
management designed into the basic architecture. Each stage of the integer
unit pipelines and the  FPU pipeline  draws power only when an instruction
is executing, and the cache arrays draw power only when an access is made.
The FPU,  secondary integer execution pipeline,  branch target cache,  and
instruction  and data  caches can  be disabled to reduce overall power us-
age.  The 3.3-V power  supply reduces  current consumption  by 40-60% over
that of microprocessors using a 5-V power supply.

The MC68060 has additional methods for  dynamically controlling power con-
sumption during operation. Running a special LPSTOP instruction shuts down
the active circuits in the processor,  halting intruction execution. Power
consumption in this standby mode is greatly reduced.  Processing and power
consumption can be resumed by  resetting the processor or by generating an
interrupt.  The frequency of operation  can  be lowered to reduce  current
consumtion while the device is in LPSTOP mode.


                                PHYSICAL

The other night my wife and I were watching TV in our living room, we 
live in a little village outside of Zurich Switzerland, we were watching
the American news program "Dateline" on NBC SuperChannel, a Pan European
station that was recently bought by NBC the American Network.  At the 
close of the program the presenters asked that the viewers to Phone in 
their opinion, voting yes or no on a certain story.  They gave out the 
phone numbers to call and then they gave an Internet address.  This was
a phenomenal thing,

The program was inviting us sitting halfway around the world to 
participate. In that instant the program went Global. The world became a
little smaller, a little more alike, a little less different.

Now I know that for more than a few years a lot of you have been using
Internet E-mail much like your regular mail and not giving it a second 
thought.

The reality is a little different though.  For you Internet E-mailers are 
experiencing the future.  You are living on the edge of the technology.
You are pushing the envelope.  Just the like the person from "Dateline" 
who had the idea to include an Internet address.

It is often said on the Internet nobody is any color or sex or 
nationality.

The Internet life is truly an singular experience.  Seeing that Internet
address on that TV show made me think of a line in a song which goes  
"Imagine there's no countries, it isn't hard to do." Because in an instant
there weren't any.  Maybe because we all sit alone at our Keyboards we 
don't always see.   In a way we are living the dream of our Utopian 
futures?

You could think of it like this.  It's 1840 in the Old West and your
mud hut of a town just happens to be one that is part of the Pony Express
route, so you get mail delivered to you once every three days but all the 
towns that lay to the east and to the south have to wait weeks for any 
mail.  You know there's a beacon of light hanging on your porch because 
your house is on the river bank and that's where all the boats come by.

Because you went to a University or worked for a company which offered
a service, the Internet, you thought was Unique and now is common place.
But I'm here to tell you, it's still Unique.  The beacon on your porch 
might be bright, bright bright. But the rest of the world is still dark.
Most of the people aren't on the route.  You can sit there and say," 
Someday everybody will get there mail like this."  The rest of the world
hardly even knows it exists. 

But it's only a matter of time.  So when you send E-mail, for every
important reason or trivial little thing you can think of, consider 
yourself "a futurist."

%%                Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users                %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

  Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

  The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software, online.

  Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

  Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES.

  35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

  No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

  Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

  Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

  Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

  FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
  Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  

  Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

  The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
  Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
  All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

  Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

  And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

Portal Signup or for more information:

   408-725-0561 (modem 3/12/2400) 24 hours every day
   408-973-8091 (modem 9600/14400) 24 hours every day

   or enter "C PORTAL" from any Sprintnet dial-in in the USA,
   or telnet to "portal.com" from anywhere.

* plus cost of phone call if out of Portal's local dialing area
  Direct rates also apply to connections made to Portal using the
  UNIX "telnet" program from an account you may already
  have on an Internet-connected system. 
% 9600 bps Sprintnet in over 300 cities areas
+ $10 rate prevails at smaller US Cities
# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

That number again:  408-973-9111.

/// BIX - Byte Information Exchange             Lots of information!
    -------------------------------



BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and enthusiasts.
While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is the place for 
knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  You're likely 
to find many others in similar situations who can offer advice, give 
technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.


                       *** FULL INTERNET ACCESS! ***

BIX features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription. 


                      ==============================
                      Rates and Connect Information:
                      ==============================


BIX membership costs $13 per month, plus connect time.  There are several 
different ways to connect:

SprintNet*              $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet:**               $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
(SprintNet and Tyment rates shown are for 48 contiguous US states only.)
                                                        
Tymnet Canada:          $4/hr eves/wkends           $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet Hawaii:          $10/hr eves/wkends          $20/hour weekdays   
Telnet(via Internet):   $1/hour, round the clock
Direct dial (Boston):   $2/hour, round the clock (up to 9600 bps)
 
 * SprintNet daytime hours are from 6am to 7pm, M-F, ET.
** Tymnet daytime hours are from 7am to 6pm, M-F, ET.

                20/20 PLAN OPTION (for USA-48 users only):

Volume users can choose the 20/20 Advantage Plan, which is $20 per month
and includes the first 20 hours of access by any combination of methods 
from the contiguous United States.  Additional use is $1.80 per hour 
(additional use for telnet access is $1 an hour).  The 20/20 Plan's cost is 
in addition to the $13 monthly fee.  


                           INTERNATIONAL USERS:

If you wish to connect internationally through Tymnet or SprintNet, 
please contact your local PTT.  BIX accepts prepaid international calls,
direct dial, or telnet connections.  In order to make a "collect" (not 
prepaid) call to BIX, your account must be verified before the charges 
are accepted.  When you complete the registration, we'll mail you a BIX
Membership Agreement by regular US Mail.  Whe you receive it, sign it 
and return it to us by mail.  When we receive it here, we'll authorize
your account to make reverse charged calls.

If you want to access BIX right away, contact your local PTT to set up a 
prepaid account.  You'll pay your local carrier for your calls to BIX in
advance, so there's no waiting period or verfication needed. Or, connect 
at BIX via telnet to x25.bix.com.

SprintNet international calls from most locations are $24 an hour.
Tymnet international charges vary, but are generally between $20-$30 an hour.


                           ====================

                           ====================

DESCRIPTION

    HWGRCS is a port of GNU RCS 5.6.0.1 done with SAS/C 6.51.

    The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions
    of  files.   RCS  automates the storing, retrieval, logging,
    identification, and merging of revisions.  RCS is useful for
    text that is revised frequently, for example programs, docu-
    mentation, graphics, papers, and form letters.

    For upgraders from the old RCS 4.x on Fish 281/282:

        - HWGRCS supports the RCS_link feature
        - No problems with non-ASCII characters

    Special features:

        - File pattern and response file expansion in all RCS commands.
        - Support for .a,.ag,.asm,.fd,.guide,.i,.ps extensions.
        - GNU DIFF 2.6, GNU patch 2.1 and a N*rton like LP utility.
        - AmigaGuide. docs.
        - I try to _support_ HWGRCS.


NEW FEATURES

    New since patch level 7:

    - DIFF/PATCH AmigaGuide. docs.
    - Reference directory support.
    - New Amiga keywords.
    - Local environment variables are checked.
    - Directory/Process specific configuration options.
    - Filename patterns to ignore are configurable.
    - .ag AmigaGuide. extension recognized.

    Bugs fixed since level 7:

    - RCS_link is always ignored as filename now with pattern expansion.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    >=V37, >1MB suggested, HD required.


HOST NAME

    Any Aminet site, e.g. ftp.uni-paderborn.de   (131.234.2.32) for users

PRICE

    I don't declare it shareware as it is Gnu SW, but donations/gifts for
    my support are quite welcome! Donations in physical form preferred.
    Support ~ Gifts, especially for commercial users.


DISTRIBUTABILITY

@toc "menu"
TITLE

     C-Shell (csh)

VERSION

     5.37

AUTHOR

     Andreas M. Kirchwitz (csh 5.20+),
     based on csh 5.19 by Urban D. Mueller

     E-Mail: csh-fan@zikzak.in-berlin.de

DESCRIPTION

     C-Shell is a replacement for the AmigaDOS command line interface.
     Many builtin Unix-like commands, very fast script language, file-
     name completion, command-name completion, comfortable command line
     editing, pattern matching, AUX: mode, object oriented file classes,
     abbreviation of internal and external commands.  Supports multiple
     users.

     C-Shell is easy to install and to use.  Online help for all
     commands, functions and various subjects.  ARP-free!

NEW FEATURES

     Changes since version 5.35 (summary):

      - Supports MultiUser (shows current user in titlebar).
      - Builtin command "chmod" (protect) allows setting of
         user/group/others bits in a UNIX-like fashion.
      - New builtin commands "chgrp" and "chown".
      - Fixed bugs in builtin commands "path", "rm", "rehash".
      - Builtin command "diskchange" allows multiple drive names.
      - New builtin function @age_mins(), modifications to @age().
      - Now requesters appear on same screen as CSH's window.
      - New meaning for builtin variable "_abbrev", now ALL commands
         (even those in the DOS search path) can be abbreviated --
         not only builltin commands.
      - Fixed layout bug in "dir -k" and "dir -i" (classes).
      - Builtin command "dir" supports UID/GID and group/others bits.
      - No requester "please insert volume ..." when you press return
         and your current directory is on an "unmounted" volume
         (eg, a removed floppy disk).
      - New meaning for "dir -z" and builtin variable "_dirformat".
      - Source code now "indent" clean.
         (some warnings on first run, but no errors)
      - Builtin command "qsort" allows case-sensitive sorting.
      - Various changes/enhancements to existing commands.
      - Miscellaneous bug fixes.

     IconPack
 
VERSION

AUTHOR
 
     Tom Ekstr|m (litoek@kielo.uta.fi)
 
DESCRIPTION
 
     IconPack is a complete collection of replacement icons
     for Workbench 2 and 3. They are designed to look good
     on a standard four-colour, high resolution, non-
     interlaced screen. They are of the same shape and size
     and use the same colour scheme of gray, black, white
     and blue as the original icons.
     IconPack contains icons for all standard Workbench files,
     plus icons for some popular PD/shareware programs, hard-disk
     related tools, and all usual datafiles (such as pictures,
     textfiles, music etc.)

     IconPack also includes the Iconizer utility to make the
     installation of images from one icon to another as effortless
     as possible. Iconizer changes only the imagery of icons, not
     affecting the tool types, position, etc.
     Source and destination icons can be selected either according to
     a script, or manually with appwindow/file requester support.
     Sporting a font-sensitive, graphical user-interface, Iconizer
     lets you see the new image and the original image side-by-side,
     before the installation, and lets you install or reject icons on
     an icon-by-icon basis.
     A script for Iconizer is provided that installs the icons from
     IconPack to you workbench.
 
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
 
     AmigaDOS version 2 or later. The installer requires at least
     version 2.04.

DESCRIPTION

        CLIExchange is a CLI replacement for standard CBM utility called 
        Exchange which is used to manage commodities. The only difference 
        is that Exchange has a graphical user interface while CLIExchange

TITLE

     TTR - The Tagline Ripper v.1.3 (release 1)

AUTHOR

     James W Savage
     Internet: bryce@gothic.demon.co.uk
     Fidonet: 2:2501/307.13 @ Centronics BBS

DESCRIPTION

     You're into email, you've seen those amusing little lines tagged onto 
     the end of messages. Isn't it tedious editing by hand and putting 
     them into a file line by line? Well, now you don't need to. TTR rips 
     taglines from every message in your message base, removes the lines 
     that looked like tags but weren't, and leaves you with a file purely 
     of amusing quotes. All you need to do is remove the boring ones.

     TTR is fully GUI driven and uses the 2.xx+ ASL file requester. Even 
     my cat can do it.

NEW FEATURES

     They're all new, it hasn't been released before!

HARD- AND SOFTWARE-REQUIREMENTS

TITLE

  April V1.0

AUTHOR

   Nick de Jong
   FidoNet 2:285/404.31

DESCRIPTION

        April is a new FidoNet-compatible tosser and editor for the
   Commodore Amiga line of personal computers, specifically aimed at
   points.  Alot of time was used to make April as user-friendly as
   possible, without making her too slow or too inflexible.  Together with
   a mailer like Trapdoor or Welmat it's now simple to set up a good
   working pointsystem...

        Some of the features of April are a new format of the messagebase,
   a well thought-out userinterface, the speed and the enormous amount of
   options to configure April the way YOU want.  There are quite some
   alternatives for April at the moment like GCCHost, Pointmanager, Foozle
   and Chameleon combined with TrapToss, Confmail or another tosser.  But
   April beats them all in speed, features and ease of use.  You can use
   the newest FidoNet-technology like 4d addressing, multibossing, linking
   of messages based on the MSGID and REPLY kludges.  4D-filenames like
   those that are supported by TrapDoor can be used, and the configuration
   can be done completely with a very comprehensive GUI.  There is a very
   complete and easy to use random system available.  The memory that
   April is allowed to use and the diskspace the messagebase is allowed to
   use is fully configurable, and April works in all kinds of display 
   formats like Interlace, Pal, NTSC, Overscan and 4 or 8 colors.


NEW FEATURES

     - Finally no longer beta
     - Some graphics enhancements
     - Some new archive options
     - BrowseFlags are showed in title
     - A re-export added
     - Import info added
     - New tree graphics
     - Tree is configurable
     - About 70 ARexx commands added
     - Option 'go to lastread at start'
     - Event commands
     - ClipBoard for messages (eg for multiquotes)
     - Archive flag added for messages that are archived
     - External cli now is of type 'AUTO/WAIT'
     - To next Subject chain when at the end of current chain
     - Aprils install option now adds some example external menu items
     - Receipt flag added
     - 'del = del + next' option added
     - Pulldown menus now ghosted when not selectable
     - YEmpty for some space at the bottom of the April screen for a
       dock or something similar.
     - Numerous bug fixes

HARD- AND SOFTWARE-REQUIREMENTS

        April runs on all members of the Commodore-Amiga family,
   independant of the Kickstart version they use.  She supports PAL as 
   well as NTSC and has been tested on all processors, from 68000 to 
   68040.

   She works as well in interlace as in non-interlace.  1MB is necessary,
   more is recommended to make proper use of April.  1 diskdrive is
   necessary, a hard-disk is recommended.

   To get a working pointsystem, you need the following programs:

       Program                         Example

    1) Tosser                   April
    2) Editor                   April
    3) Mailer                   Trapdoor, Welmat
    4) Arcer                    LHA, LZ, Zoo, Lharc, ARJ, ARC, Zip

DESCRIPTION

     Forth is an interactive software development environment,
     normally tailored for embedded controller and machine
     control applications.  With JForth's comprehensive Amiga
     system interface, Forth now excels at platform software
     development.   Originally created to provide precise control
     of observatory telescopes, Forth contains both an interpreter
     AND a compiler, combining the best features of both systems.
     The interpreter affords interactive access to all language
     features; programs are compiled into native 68K code.  JForth
     programs are compatible with all AMiga models and OS
     versions.  AGA support (3.1) is currently in beta test.

     This is a demo version of the JForth Professional 3.x
     software development system.  It includes a complete
     JForth interpreter/compiler which is fully-functional
     but limited in the size of executable code it will
     produce.  Also, the demo will NOT create standalone
     programs (the commercial package will).  This demo
     version also offers an "Introduction" which can be
     optionally viewed at startup.
     
     The demo interpreter/compiler includes a disassembler,
     assembler, as well as a source-level debugger.  While
     the demo package does not provide the JForth "include"
     files (similar to C's ",h" files, JForth calls them
     ".j"), MANY are pre-compiled and accessible in the demo
     program.  Similarly, the demo can also call many Amiga
     shared-library functions, as they have been pre-compiled
     for you (the demo package does NOT support adding more...
     the commercial package can call any Amiga library func-,
     tion, even custom libraries).
     
     Additionally, there is a compiled example program which
     demonstrates the JForth interface into graphics, menus,
     HAM mode, gadgets, etc.
     
     There are several source files provided, including an
     IFF file viewer, word/line counter and others (all will
     compile within the working space limitations imposed by
     the demo).  Additionally, several tutorials are provided
     for users new to Forth and/or JForth.
     
     Also provided is V1.11 of Textra, the user-friendly
     Amiga GUI-based text editor.  This is the same editor
     which accompanies the JForth package and can be
     integrated with JForth (even the demo) via ARexx.
     (Later versions of Textra are available and are
     completely backward-compatible with JForth).
     
     Finally, as an example of a JForth standalone,
     graphics-based productivity application, Mike Haas'
     1993 "LCD Calculator II" is included.

NEW FEATURES OF JFORTH PROFESSIONAL 3.x

    - Amiga DOS 2.0 includes and library support, 68040-compatible
    - ASL file requester
    - ANIM and ANIMBRUSH IFF extensions to the Picture system
    - ARexx support toolbox simplifies writing command driven
        host applications
    - Mike Haas' Textra editor (v1.11) integrated with JForth
        via ARexx

Our host machine is a 386/33 with 20MB of memory, 1GB harddisk and
a CD-ROM drive running in a Novell network. The BBS software is a
Norwegian origin MBBS running in a DesqView windows.

We have now (26th March 1994) over 10000 files online (mostly for
the Commodore Amiga line of the personal computers.)

Every user has an access to download filelist (LAHOFIL.ZIP), list of the
Finnish 24-hour BBS's (BBSLIST.ZIP or BBSLIST.LHA) and every issue of
the Amiga Report Magazine (AR101.LHA-AR???.LHA) even on their first call.

The system has been running since 1989 and is sponsored by the local
telephone company, Vaasan Lnin Puhelin Oy.

BTW, LAHO stands for "LAtomeren Hyrylaiva Oy" = "Barnsea Steamship Co."

Welcome on board!
