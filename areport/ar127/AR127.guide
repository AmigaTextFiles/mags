    ----------------------


Don't ya hate it when you have something to write, but nothing is coming
to mind?  Usually, I can think of something to put here, even if it's just
a brief overview of things.  Tonight I can't seem to come up with anything.

I want to apologize to our Internet subscribers.  Last week, the system
where the mailing list was sent from was experiencing problems.  The list
finally went out, but a few days late.  With luck, everything will be fine
this week.

A note on Netmail.  I have been receiving quite a bit of Netmail through
FidoNet lately.  I wanted to let people know that the system I call for
this mail is having trouble with outgoing mail (actually, it's a bug in
DLG I'm told), so I have been unable to respond.

A few people have been offering to write reviews for Amiga Report.  I'd
like to say that I invite anyone to submit material.  I'm happy to accept
work from anybody who cares to contribute!  If you do send stuff, please
send it to my Portal Email address if you're using Internet mail.  But
ordinary mail should go to my Delphi account.  The way the two mail systems
are setup make it easier to deal with larger messages on Portal.  Thanks!

Cable TV's Big Day in Washington


WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The cable television industry's attempts to roll-back rate
regulation are being heard in Washington. 

At a US House hearing in which Democrats complained about rising rates in the
face of a law passed last year to lower them, Republicans said they would try
to repeal the same law. And at the US Supreme Court, four justices agreed to
hear an appeal of the law's "must carry" provision lodged by Turner
Broadcasting System Inc. 

The 1992 cable re-regulation law was passed over a veto from former Republican
President George Bush and opponents, including the cable industry's trade
groups, had long predicted it would result in rate increases. At a hearing
before the subcommittee of Democrat Edward Markey of Massachusetts, Texas
Republicans Joe Barton and Jack Fields said that is just what happened, and
Barton said he would introduce legislation to repeal it. 

But Markey and the panel's Democrats refused to back off. They lectured interim
Federal Communications Commission Chairman James Quello on the need to stop
unjustified rate hikes. Quello replied that the commission is now surveying the
effects of the law with the 25 largest US operators, and predicted it will find
that most rates have, in fact, gone down. Quello added that the September bills
are just the first step in a long process mandated by the law. 

Local governments which feel the new rates are out of line can challenge them,
cable companies can appeal those challenges to the commission, and consumers
may still get rebates on overcharges, back-dated to September 1. He also warned
that if complaints prove true, the industry will again be open to the charge
that it is the "monopolistic evil empire" of the telecommunications world. 

Meanwhile, at the Supreme Court, four justices agreed to review Turner
Broadcasting System vs. FCC, a case now numbered docket 93-44. That is a
challenge to the "must carry" provision of the 1992 law, under which small
cable systems must reserve one-third of their channels for local broadcasters,
even if they must drop popular cable programming for home shopping stations.
Turner had sued against the provision claiming it violated operators' free
speech rights under the First Amendment, but the challenge was rejected by an
appeals' court. 

The "must carry" provision is tied to a "retransmission consent" provision,
under which popular local stations can force payment from cable operators to
carry their signals. Unless agreements were negotiated by October 6, many
operators said they would stop carrying some local network affiliates. And in
agreements worked out so far between networks and operators, the operators are
agreeing to clear additional channels for new cable offerings created by the
networks. 

The one exception is CBS, which has no plans to produce a cable network and
recently dropped its demands that operators pay it 10 cents per home per month,
at least for the next year. The result is to help networks like CNBC, owned by
the NBC television network, and hurt networks like CNN, owned by Turner,
because Turner does not have a network of local stations. "Retransmission
consent" is the one aspect of the new law even Rep. Barton said he does not
want repealed. 

The real irony is that technology is making all this moot, observers note. The
500-channel systems being built by major operators like Time Warner and TCI
will eliminate any problems with a scarcity of channels. And the entry of local
phone companies into the business, recently authorized by a US District Court
in Virginia, would provide competition which would eliminate the rate
regulation provisions of the 1992 act.

Wireless Network At 20 Mbps


CALGARY, ALBERTA, CANADA -- Wi-LAN Inc., has announced its first products - a
line of wireless Ethernet local area network (LAN) equipment that company 
officials claim can carry data at speeds up to 20 megabits-per-second (Mbps), 
or twice the speed of conventional wired Ethernet. 

Frederick Rogers, president of Wi-LAN, told Newsbytes the high speed is
possible because of the modulation technique used. The products are based on
spread-spectrum technology that transmits data using radio frequencies. The
technology was developed at the University of Calgary and AGT Ltd., the
telephone company serving Alberta. 

Wi-LAN said the fastest of its new products is the 20-Mbps Wi-LAN 902-20, which
can plug directly into the Ethernet network interface card of any computer. It
modulates and compresses data from the interface card and transmits it to
another Wi-LAN interface. 

The 902-20 is due to begin shipping in January, Wi-LAN said. By March, Rogers
said, the company plans to add a LAN gateway using the same technology. The
gateway will attach to a wired LAN and provide communications between computers
on the wired LAN and those equipped with the Wi-LAN wireless interfaces. 

It will also be attachable to a network server, allowing computers equipped
with the company's wireless interfaces to communicate with the server by radio
frequency. That will mean new stations can be added to the LAN without any
wiring, the company said. 

The suggested retail price for the Wi-LAN 902-20 is US$1,495.

Computer Associates Wins Trade Secret Case


ISLANDIA, NEW YORK -- A US District Court jury in Denver has awarded Computer 
Associates International Inc., $8.5 million in damages after concluding that 
Denver-based American Fundware Inc., stole trade secrets from the large 
software firm. 

The damages include $4.245 million in compensation for lost royalties and an
equal amount in punitive damages. Mike McElroy, vice-president - legal at
Computer Associates, said he believes it is the largest amount of punitive
damages ever granted in a software trade secrets suit. 

The verdict shows that the courts are prepared to enforce property rights in
software, McElroy said. 

CA sued AFW over PC Fund and Fundware, financial software programs sold by the
Denver company. The court upheld CA's claim that sizeable portions of the AFW
packages were copied from software that AFW licensed from Stuart P. Orr &
Associates, a company CA bought in 1983. 

The Stuart P. Orr software was written for minicomputers from Data General
Corp. PC Fund and its successor, Fundware, run on IBM and compatible personal
computers. All were written in the COBOL programming language, and according to
McElroy, significant portions of the source code were identical. 

McElroy said that after CA filed the trade secret lawsuit in 1986, AFW tried to
cover up the copying of the software by changing some of the code. 

The jury ruled that AFW breached its 1979 contract with Stuart P. Orr and
misappropriated trade secrets from Stuart P. Orr and CA. 

AFW no longer sells PC Fund. Computer Associates has asked for an injunction
against the further sale of Fundware, McElroy said, but the jury does not have
the power to grant an injunction. The judge in the case must rule on that, and
has not yet done so.

DEC Japan Intros Beta Japanese Windows NT


TOKYO, JAPAN -- Digital Equipment Corp. Japan (DEC Japan), has released a 
beta copy of the Japanese version of Microsoft's Windows NT. The program 
operates on the company's personal computers, including the AXP 150 and
the DEC PC. 

Three kinds of Windows NT packages are offered for the Japanese market. The
developer's kit is intended for programmers working on the AXP 150. The retail
price is 957,000 yen ($9,570) - the same price as the original English version
released in May. The program will be sold until the end of November. 

The upgrade kit consists of a CD-ROM, firmware, an ECU kit, and documentation.
It is priced at 70,000 yen ($700). An OADG keyboard that offers compatibility
with IBM's DOS/V PC costs an additional 5,000 yen ($50). 

A beta version of the Japanese Windows NT package for general users costs
1,604,000 yen ($16,040). The developer's kit is also included in the bundle.
Customers of the beta versions will be provided with the finished versions at
a later date, free of additional charges. 

With the release of the beta versions, DEC Japan has started accepting test
users of the program. DEC Japan will provide the program to 200 users of the
DEC PC (with a 33 megahertz 486 processor or above). The test users need pay
only 6,000 yen ($60) for the disks and the manuals. 

DEC Japan has also begun providing support services - covering installation and
consultation for the Japanese version of Windows NT - as part of its
multi-vendor customer services.

Unix Expo - Object Technology More Than A Language


NEW YORK, NEW YORK -- Moving to object technology takes a lot more than 
just learning an object-oriented programming language, concurred 
participants in a roundtable discussion at Unix Expo last week. 

"The worst way to start is to just go out and buy a language," said Marie
Lenzi, president of Cyrix Corp. and editor of Object Magazine. "Instead, what
you need to do is establish an object mindset," she added, in a session called
"Object-Oriented Programming for Non-C Programmers." 

The first area to focus on is object analysis and design, Lenzi told an
audience of programmers that ranged in background from Smalltalk to Fortran and
Cobol. 

Other areas to be considered, outside of the development language, include the
object database, and the administration and management of objects. Object
databases are quite a different animal from relational databases, she noted. 

"In object technology, an object is an object throughout analysis, design, and
development. All we do is say `Persist' and the object sits itself on the disk,
instead of doing the `dance of the seven veils' to get itself on and off the
disk as we have to do with relational databases," she commented. 

People who make good candidates to become object-oriented programmers include
abstract thinkers, "true engineers who really understand what's going on inside
the machine," experienced script writers, and people who work well with visual
tools, according to Lenzi. 

"I agree with Marie that you're not doing OT programming just because you're
using a language that happens to be object-oriented. OT is more a way of
thinking about a problem," said Randy Howie, vice president of engineering at
AIT, a company that has been providing OT consulting services for the past
eight years, mostly to federal agencies and large newspapers. 

OT is best suited to problems which call for simplification of complex data, he
suggested. In one application, recently readied as a proof of concept for NASA,
AIT developed an object- oriented query tool for use by scientists who needed
satellite data. 

The problem in this situation was that satellites tend to store information on
time and place in different ways, said Howie. Some satellites store the
information as arcs, and some as a series of contiguous rectangles, he
explained. 

To circumvent this problem, AIT "modeled concepts like time and location as
objects that could translate a scientists' way of expressing time and location
into the satellite's way of expressing time and location." 

Agreed Gene Bonte, vice president of product management at Object Design:
"Today, objects are hot, so (you're seeing) object-oriented oleomargarine. But
OT is not a universal panacea." 

OT has made its first strides in the engineering design market, he said. "The
reason is fairly simple. The data is complex, and the data model that OT
supports fits the data model for these applications very well," he maintained. 

OT is also making rapid progress in the telecommunications field, mainly
because OT and telecommunications both share an orientation toward Unix and
C/C++ programming, he added. 

Now that the difficulties of using OT in distributed computing are starting to
be overcome, the technology is emerging in the area of business reengineering
and client-server technology as well, he said. 

Regardless of the applications field, users should go through four sequential
stages in implementing OT: figuring out whether OT will be useful, developing a
pilot, creating a "first product," and finally expanding into additional
products. "Otherwise, you'll get into big trouble," cautioned Bonte.

Merisel To Buy ComputerLand Franchise Div


EL SEGUNDO, CALIFORNIA -- Just four months after announcing the lay off of 
6.5 percent of its workforce, ComputerLand has signed a letter of intent to 
sell its Franchise and Distribution Division to Merisel. The two companies 
have also announced the formation of a "strategic relationship." 

However, the companies say that terms and conditions have not been finalized.
Once completed, the new Merisel ComputerLand subsidiary will be managed by the
current president of ComputerLand's Franchise and Distribution Division, Martin
Wolf. 

Merisel will also become the preferred supplier of software and hardware
products under a volume purchase agreement to ComputerLand Corp. According to
the companies, ComputerLand will then continue, under a long-term deal, to
provide the new company with "purchasing, distribution, systems and other
services currently supplied to ComputerLand franchisees and Datago affiliates."

Definitive agreements have yet to be signed. The deal is also awaiting receipt
of regulatory approvals, although it is expected to be completed before the end
of 1993. 

Under terms of the deal, Merisel will pay up to $110 million for the US
ComputerLand Franchise and Distribution division, with an initial cash payment
at closing of $60 million. The purchase price gives Merisel the rights to the
ComputerLand name in the US. 

ComputerLand says it will "temporarily retain the rights to use the name for a
limited period and will eventually change its name, although it will continue
to own the rights to the ComputerLand name internationally." 

Announcing the deal, Merisel Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael D.
Pickett, said: "The proposed purchase of the ComputerLand Franchise and
Distribution Division is intended to enhance Merisel's customer intimacy
strategy, and provide the benefits that come from doing business with a
full-line distributor focused exclusively on selling to resellers." 

William Y. Tauscher, Computerland's CEO and chairman, said: "This agreement
will help us focus on our core business, providing products and services to
corporate end-users. It also improves our cash position substantially." 

According to a statement issued by ComputerLand, the transaction "will greatly
strengthen the balance sheet of ComputerLand, which has been thinly capitalized
since the July 1992 acquisition of TRW's Customer Service Division and the
acquisition of ComputerLand franchises or establishment of company-owned
operations in most US major markets during the past two years." 

In May, Newsbytes reported that, while ComputerLand was expanding in Russia and
the Baltic, it also announced plans to lay off of 6.5 percent of its work
force, or about 170 workers.

Dell Intros Pentium-based Desktop Prototype


AUSTIN, TEXAS -- Dell Computer Corporation has rolled out a Pentium-based 
desktop prototype PC that incorporates Intel's Peripheral Component 
Interconnect (PCI) local-bus. 

The system was demonstrated at the annual management conference of the
Microcomputer Managers Association being held in New York. Dell's chief
Technology Officer Glenn Henry says that while Dell currently offers other
industry-standard local-bus technologies, the company thinks PCI is the most
attractive long-term solution. 

Both companies say PCI offers advantages over other local-bus implementations
or proprietary architecture's, including its ability to work with processors
such as 486 and Pentium chips, an open standard that includes over 120 system
manufacturers and I/O card suppliers. They also point out that because PCI bus
devices are not directly attached to the processor bus, the processor can
continue to operate while the PCI peripheral is accessing information from the
system's main memory. 

"While many other local bus technologies only allow one peripheral to operate
at a time, PCI has the advantage of allowing multiple peripherals to operate
independently," Henry said. 

Intel says that PCI technology will enable vendors such as Dell to offer what
they call "auto-configuration." That's the system's ability to automatically
recognize when a PCI-compatible add-in board has been installed and will
reconfigure itself to accommodate the card. Intel says that PCI is also
designed to handle future design advances in the Pentium architecture. 

In outlining its strategy for Pentium-based systems and PCI technology, Dell
said that user benefits for such systems include high performance data storage
and retrieval through a PCI SCSI disk subsystem, high performance video and
graphics capability through a PCI video subsystem, and easy of upgrading to
future PCI expansion through flexible system designs. 

Dell also predicts high performance PCI local area network adapters and other
communications peripherals, full motion video adapters compatible with PCI, and
technology that integrates telephone technology with computers for business
communications applications such as video conferencing on the desktop computer.

DevWare Video & Atomic Toaster Announce Merger


DevWare, Inc., the California based direct marketer and distributor of
software and videotapes for the Amiga, and the Atomic Toaster, the Salt Lake
City, Utah-based Video Toaster Systems dealer, seminar instructor, software
developer and video producer, have announced they will be joining forces to
bring Video Toaster systems and related add-on products to new customers not
being reached by other Video Toaster dealers.
  
This new merger will combine the respective strenghts of Atomic Toaster and
DevWare.
  
Atomic Toaster has been designing and configuring Video Toaster systems,
supporting the creative and technical needs of its customers, and conducting
innovative training seminars for its corporate and university clients since
late 1990. Over this period, they have learned that anyone can sell a product
or a group of products, but it is how all products work together in a system
that makes their customer's productions successful. This is why they came up
with the Atomic Toaster Catalog, the indispensible resource and reference
guide for the Video Toaster industry, produced the Audio Production For The
Video Toaster instructional video, and developed the first product in The
Scene Machine series, Crouton Tools.
  
DevWare Video, launched in late 1992 as a division of DevWare, has quickly
become the largest reseller of videotapes, books, and educational software
for North American Amiga users, and one of the largest resellers of
commercial software for animation, graphics and video purposes as well.
  
"Our concern was how we extend our abilities and gain entry into the
expanding Video Toaster industry, and be able to properly support the
products we delivered to our customers," said Scott Pincus, President of
DevWare. "When we learned that Atomic Toaster wanted to expand their
business, it seemed like the perfect merger of our abilities." 
  
"We knew that we were probably the greatest authority on how key software and
peripherals worked with the Video Toaster to become the most effective
systems for customers. Questions referred to us by NewTek and attendance at
our seminars were proof of that," said Harold Russell, President of Atomic
Toaster. "But we didn't have the capability to profitibly expand our
operations, and more importantly, handle the volume of business which would
result. DevWare offered us that solution with their marketing, distribution,
product purchasing, and fulfillment capabilities."
  
As a result of the merger, DevWare will market Crouton Tools, Audio
Production for the Video Toaster, the Atomic Toaster Catalog, future products
in The Scene Machine Series, and other new products developed by Atomic
Toaster through its DevWare Video division to end users, corporate and
university customers, and dealers. Atomic Toaster will provide creative
technical support, seminar training and continued development of The Scene
Machine modules and other products for the Video Toaster, as well as provide
technical support for other commercial software titles licensed by DevWare
Video.
  
DevWare, through its DevWare Video division, is an international licensor,
marketer and distributor of commercial software and instructional videotapes
relating to the Amiga computer and Desktop Video markets.
  
Atomic Toaster, located in Salt Lake City, Utah, has more than 20 years
experience in commercial video production and has been configuring Video
Toaster Systems for customers since the Video Toaster was first released.
Recently, they opened a California office to sell Video Toaster systems and
training seminars to corporate accounts and video producers in the greater
Los Angeles area.
  
DevWare is also a direct marketer of third-party Amiga software, hardware and
Public Domain for the Amiga and MS-DOS markets. Lower-priced niche software
licensing and distribution is done through its DevWare Toolchest division.



                      ------------------------------

(8) MB are required to render high resolution morphs.
  
A hard drive is required with less than 4 MB of RAM, and highly recommended
otherwise.
  
DevWare will market CocoonMorph through its DevWare Video division. Atomic
Toaster, located in Salt Lake City, Utah, and now working with DevWare Video
as their Video Toaster sales and new product development division, will
provide technical support for CocoonMorph.

marketer and distributor of commercial software and instructional videotapes
relating to the Amiga computer and Desktop Video markets.

DESCRIPTION

	A new "polymorphic" ANSI BBS package for the Amiga.

FEATURES

	The main feature of this BBS software is that it is 100% online
	configurable.  The sysop may create his own structure of menus,
	choosing himself the keys to press, which makes each BBS unique and
	"polymorphic".  There is no need to compile menus. Everything is
	built-in, available even on terminal nodes, and very easy to use.

	One "novice" can start a new BBS "from scratch" in less
	than 1 hour.

	The menus are created in a tree-like structure.  The
	SYSOP chooses the keys and links them to one of the 28 functions
	available. Each key has its own access level for reading and
	writing.

	Other nice features are:

	Multi-users, multi-nodes, 100% editable online, 10 sets of texts

DiskExpander V2.1 Announced


TITLE

        DiskExpander

VERSION

        version 2.1

AUTHOR

        Jaroslav Mechacek & others

DESCRIPTION

        DiskExpander is a brandnew tool which may DOUBLE the capacity of
        your hard disk and your floppy disk(s).

        DiskExpander is a program which multiplies your
        "virtual" disk space. It does so by compressing each file during
        writing (in real time). If you access the file later for
        reading, the file gets decompressed at once.

        After installing DiskExpander, you will be able to continue
        your work without making any changes to your environment. Unless
        you change the configuration of DiskExpander you will never again
        have to restart it manually.

        DiskExpander uses the XPK standard (by Urban Dominik
        Mueller & others) and lets you choose the most
        suitable compressor, e.g. (just two of many included XPK
        compressing libraries):

        Method  Packing  Unpacking   Packing  Unpacking   Compression
                Memory   Memory      Speed    Speed       Ratio
        -------------------------------------------------------------
        FAST      92 KB       0 KB  426 KB/s   1048 KB/s        32.7%
        NUKE     192 KB       0 KB   35 KB/s    613 KB/s        45.2%

        (statistics from the standard XPK Benchmark System
         [A3000/25 with SCRAM, AmigaVision being packed])

        You can use any XPK compressor library. DiskExpander doesn't
        even need to have the XPKMaster.library (for reasons of memory
        consumption). All actions of DiskExpander are fully transparent.
        You will notice only a very slight delay during file operations.
        You don't have to worry about your files. If files are already
        better packed (e.g. lha-packed files) DiskExpander won't pack
        these once more.

        There are also some tools in the DiskExpander package. Namely:

        * DEStatistics which gives you the proof how your files
          have been packed and which compression libraries have been
          used.

        * DevicePacker which helps you to pack or unpack entire
          directories, partitions or even entire hard disks/floppy
          disks. It can be also useful to convert files which have
          been packed with an obselete compression library and pack
          them with a more sophisticated compression library.

        All programs have a graphical user interface but can also get
        started with command lines.

        DiskExpander is a carefully tested program. There have been
        hundreds of testers worldwide.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        none - ANY Amiga and Kickstart/WB

        (There are some libraries which may require more than 512K memory!)

	ambitious person who wants to modify the source, recompile it,
	etc.

	which may not exceed $1.00 (American).

	I hereby give permission to any second party to modify the
	source and redistribute it for non-profit purposes.  Also
        this new distribution must include the original text files
	included in this distribution.  Mention must be made of me, 
	the original author, by the second party when releasing this

.../General Q&A, Announcements, and Help!/Looking for a faster modem?
16026.3.603.1 Try this one: $99
9/29/93 15:46 46/2046 Harv

I ordered the LineLink 144e modem from Mac Warehouse on Tuesday
this week. They told me it was out of stock and they expected a shipment
in soon. This morning (Thursday) half an hour ago it was delivered to
my front door. Total cost $99 for the modem plus $3 for Airborne
Express overnight shipping.

The modem's box was securely packed in a larger outer carton.

I was shipped exactly what I ordered and received it in perfect
working condition in a very timely manner. mac Warehouse's phone
order takers were courteous and did not leave me on hold for long
periods of time.

The modem itself is a white metal box, not very fancy or
pretentious looking, about 6" wide, about 8" deep, about 1.5" tall
with five LEDs on the front panel. The rear has the standard
RJ11 phone and line jacks, a standard RS-232 female port, a small
power switch, and a hole into which one plugs the small AC power
adaptor.

Included is a 30 page manual, a disk with Mac terminal software,
a Mac serial cable, and the AC power brick.

I unplugged my old modem, used the same Amiga serial cable I've been
using since 1985 to connect the modem, connected the power brick,
ran Baud Bandit, dialed in and here I am.

All things considered I would rate this purchase as a excellent
bargain, and rate Mac Warehouse as an excellent company with whom to
do business (I have absolutely no affiliation with them whatsoever
and I've NEVER bought anything from them before).

I don't know how long they intend to keep selling this modem for
$99. At that price it represents an absolutely incredible bargain
and if you've been slogging along with a 1200 or 2400bps modem
waiting for the price of 14.4K modems to come down to a reasonable
level, your wait is now over.

Call Mac Warehouse and order one of these. They're at 1-800-255-6227.
The modem's order number is BND0249. They take all major credit
cards and again, Airborne overnight express is $3 additional.

Again, I have NO connection with Mac Warehouse at all except I am
now an extremely satisfied customer.

Area: AMIGA                                   Date: 25 Sep 93 23:21:38
From: Jeff Grimmett (1:202/739.1)
To  : All
Subj: Amiga Echo Disk -=Deux=- Status Report

@MSGID: 1:202/739.1@FidoNet 3e737566
Well, I hear the masses clamoring for news on AmigaDisk 4, like maybe when it
will finally be out... right now, I have a basic problem with it: so far, I
have yet to find a suitable distribution method and player!  Isn't it amazing,
here we are on THE multimedia machine, and yet I'm having trouble here...

Originally, I planned on using Impulse's Foundation 2.1.  It had the virtue of
being paid for, something dear to my heart.  I put together a sample disk and
started testing it out.  I found out several things:

   1. The player itself is over 500K!  AUGH!
   2. The player does NOT like 512K chip ram systems.
   3. The player does NOT like A1000s.
   4. The player seems to do OK with 3.0 and AGA.
   5. Can't put buttons on HAM pics.  Small but annoying.

OK, sez I, I've been considering Scala.  I borrowed it from my former roomie
and found out the following:

   1. Fantastic program!  Well worth the $300 except...
   2. To my dismay, the player requires a dongle!  NO freely
      distributable player!!!

Scratch ScalaMM.

Now, I'm about to buy a copy of DeluxeVideoIII.  I used to own it, it worked
well, and did everything I wanted it to do on my 3000.  I can get it CHEAP. 
It comes with a freely distributable player, and I think the transfer util is
also redistributable. If so, this will make installation a snap for everyone,
too.  My only real worry is AGA and AmigaDOS 3.0.  We'll see in a very short
time.  I plan on sending a sample disk to Asha and have her try it out on her
friend Dawn's machine (a 1200) to see if it works.  If it works, I can have
disk 4 out the door in a week or less and disk 5 will be right on its tail.  I
plan on hatching these disks via the Sky Amiga Network for widest
distribution.

Now, the question remains:  if DVIII doesn't work, what then? CanDo was used
for the original disks, I beleive.  Perhaps someone has a used copy for sale? 
I am NOT rich, and can't afford to buy it for just one project, which is more
or less why I would buy it.  The current licensing agreement for the player is
a bummer, too.

OR:  I am willing to entertain other suggestions.  Is there a PD or shareware
util for coordinating such things?  Remember, it MUST be 1.3 friendly!  I
figure around EchoDisk 10 we can drop that requirement, but for now we still
have a few 1.3 holdouts, so we have to consider them.  Otherwise, I'd already
have a player assembled using ToolManager 2.1 :-)

This is very frustrating.  I have the titles, the credits, and the title
screen all done.  I have pics.  All I need is a presentation tool.

Figured everyone would appreciate a status report.  Thanks for your
contributions, everyone!  OK, here's the info for those who don't know:

(_/hat's  right  folks,  time once again to get your XapShots and
digitizers  out  and create a photo of yourself to be distributed
throughout the known universe!

The  idea  behind  the Amiga <Echo> Disk is this:  we have here a
community  of  words  and phrases formed by personalities that we
have  no way of attaching to an actual face.  The Amiga Echo Disk
is  a  collection of such 'photos' in IFF format, viewable on any
Amiga  throughout  the  land.   This gives you a good idea of who
you're "talking" to.

The  first  set  of  EchoDisks  contained  a  pic  of Asha in her
infamous  bustier, Yours Truly redeaux in one fairly tame and one
fairly  bizarre interpretation, Orin amidst his creations, people
posing  with thier computers, people walking past the camera, and
other  more  creative pics.  Along with each pic were text-format
bios  of  the person (self-authored) and some even had extra pics
or  sound  samples  (Jeff  Johansen's  Workbench, for instance --
out-a-sight!).  The disks were distributed as a set and driven by
a CanDo deck, usable on any Amiga.

Now,  almost  a  year  after release, we are once again gathering together
pics, sounds, and sights related to the people that form this, the AMIGA echo!

WHAT TO DO

Easy!    Send  your pics to myself or to Orin Palmer (criteria to follow along
with addresses)

HOW TO DO IT

Preferably,  pics  should be in IFF format, HAM included.  If you
don't  have  a  digitizer  handy,  a  snapshot  will do -- we can
digitize   and   return   these   pics.      IFF-24's  and  other
high-res/high-color  pic  formats  are  acceptable,  but  will be
reduced down to HAM.

WHAT TO PUT IN IT

Hey,  it can be a simple pic of yourself at the family picnic, or
you  can  get  way  out gonzo creative!  I've seen some excellent
pics that were done with the original subject and then enhanced in
some  way.   Put yourself in an Imaginary scene, in the middle of
your  workbench,  or your face on Arnold Schwarzenegger's body --
just have fun!

Additionally,  sound  samples of your voice, favorite sound byte, or whatever
can be integrated into the disk.

Along  with  all  this,  please  include  a  self-written  bio or
introduction  to  yourself.    It  doesn't  have  to be long, nor
flashy, nor witty, just write what you feel like writing.

WHO SHOULD SEND IT IN

If  you're  reading  this,  you're in!  Just because you're not a regular
doesn't mean you don't count!

Also,  just because you were on the first disk collection doesn't mean you
aren't welcome the second time around!  Time has passed! People change!

WHERE TO SEND IT

IFF's  and  HAM  pics  should be sent to myself, either as a file attach to me
at 1:202/739, or via Snail Mail to:

                          Jeff Grimmett
                        3152 Kemper St #5
                      San Diego, CA  92110


24-bitters,  XapShot disks, video tapes, flat pics should be sent to  Orin
Palmer either as a file attach to 1:202/739.10 or via US Snail to:

                           Orin Palmer
                       540 Naples St. #28
                     Chula Vista, CA  91911

Suggestions  for  the Amiga Echo Disk <Deaux> are appreciated, as well  as
questions on unclear parts of the "official" AmigaDiskII blurb (what you're
reading).

****

All for now!

/// World of Commodore Amiga Show Report
    ------------------------------------
    By Dan Zerkle
    (zerkle@cs.ucdavis.edu)



Part 6, Interviews on Show Floor


This is part 6 of my report from the World of Commodore Amiga
show held in Pasadena, California, on September 10th, 11th, and
12th.  This section details interviews I conducted at the booths
on the show floor.  I will continue to post sections each night
or so until I finish.


READER COMMENTS

First, some comments from the readers about previous sections of
this report.

From Yves Perrenoud (pyves@nuga.alphanet.ch) comes this comment
about the sound on MPEG discs:

----------- (BEGIN QUOTE) -------------
The sound from the MPEG disks is compressed using a standard
similar to the one used for the MiniDisk (ATRAC : Adaptive
Transform Acoustic Coding). It is based on physiological studies
of the human ear (it's sensitivity varies according to
frequency).
------------ (END QUOTE) --------------

He had a lot more to say about this.  That was the short version. 
For the long version, contact him at his e-mail address.

One of those "three guys" who ended up the the motel with Harv
and me wrote to explain who they were:

----------- (BEGIN QUOTE) -------------
Steve Herring 	- Producer
Anthony Fiarito - Grip
Chris Hufnagel (me, chuff@ee.pdx.edu) - Grip

The show we were taping is called "Cyberspace 3-D" and deals with
all aspects of technology (Even Amiga).

We did interviews of many people and products at the WOC.  Did
some taping at JPL.  Did a taping at Virtual Worlds (Robotech
center) and got cancelled for Foundation Imaging.  

The show will air in Portland, OR, Virginia (?), New York, and
other places.

If you need more info let me know and I'll get you the e-mail
address of the producer.   
------------ (END QUOTE) --------------


PORTAL COMMUNICATIONS

Well, Portal didn't have a booth at WOCA.  They did, however,
send Harv Laser, so I'd better mention them.

Portal is an online service.  It has file download areas, message
areas, and online chat.  It offers full-blown access to Internet
services such as Usenet, electronic mail, ftp, Internet relay
chat, telnet, and so forth.  If you are a North American without
access to all these, Portal is probably the best way to get them.

In addition, a large part of Portal, called the "Amiga Zone," is
dedicated to Amiga users.  The Amiga Zone has various important
Amiga personalities online, and you can "chat" with them online. 
It also has a vendor area dedicated to companies that sell Amiga
products.  It has a large collection of Amiga files for download,
including the entire Fred Fish collection.

Best of all, it carries comp.sys.amiga.announce.

Portal costs $19.95 per month, plus a one-time startup charge of
$19.95.  You can connect to it through Tymnet, Sprintnet, or the
Internet (via telnet).  There is no "per-minute" fee, except any
fee charged by your network.

If you do join Portal, mention that it is because of the Amiga
Zone.


ANTI GRAVITY PRODUCTS

I thought that this medium-sized booth was a just a dealer, as
they had stacks of products from various companies for sale.  I
found that they were more when Jeremy Birn saw my badge and
started describing their special products.

"Snap Maps" are 24-bit IFF texture maps intended to be used in 
3-D rendering programs.  In addition to coloring polygons, they
can cut out shapes of various objects.  This saves a tremendous
amount of time over modeling these object completely with
polygons.

There are two Snap Maps packages.  the "Fields and Foliage"
library has grass, ivy, leafy branches, flowers, and so on.  The
"Materials and Fabrics" library has cloth, wicker, nets, and
other man-made stuff.

I saw a couple pictures generated with the Maps.  They were used
to generate a picture of a fern leaf.  It looked pretty good.

Along the 3-D line, they also offered the Humanoid Human
Animation Designer.  This is a kit consisting of four 3-D models
of the human form:  a man, muscular man, woman, and child.  These
models are fully articulated and can be used to generate motion
such as walking, running, changing facial expressions, and the
like.

I was quite impressed with the demonstrations of these models. 
This package contains the most realistic, detailed electronic
model of the human body I've ever seen.


WARM AND FUZZY LOGIC

Warm and Fuzzy Logic had the most controversial product at the
show.  This product is "LightRave."  It is a hardware module that
allows you to run NewTek's 3D graphics package, LightWave,
without the need for NewTek's Video Toaster.

LightRave adds a few features to LightWave.  With it, you can
render to a normal Amiga screen or to a 24-bit graphics card. 
There is no trouble using it in PAL mode.  It can render directly
to GVP's ImageFX image processing program.  It is faster than
rendering with a Toaster installed.  It will work with any Amiga
computer with enough memory.

Of course, to use this, you have to find a copy of LightWave
somehow.


EUPHONICS

One of the most interesting new products at the show was the
Lightworks Graphics Synthesizer from Euphonics.  This is a
hardware/software combination package that is a little hard to
describe.  It lets you engage in what I call "performance
graphics".

Basically, Lightworks lets you display actively changing graphics
in conjunction with music.  These graphics can be patterns,
pictures, or anything you want.  The graphics can change in
response to scripts, audio input, MIDI input, or an active user. 
Many of the supplied patterns are intended to be genlocked over
live video.

The package includes a controller box with eight sliders.  These
can be used to control almost any part of the display.

On display was one fancy geometric pattern changing its pallate
in response to audio input.  Another was a graphic display
indicating the bass, midrange, and treble response to more music.

The package is intended for music technicians and disk jockeys. 
You really have to see it to understand how it works.  I have
only mentioned a few of the features.  In the hands of a capable
artist, it could have considerable potential.

Part 7, Interviews on Show Floor


This is part 7 of my report from the World of Commodore Amiga
show held in Pasadena, California, on September 10th, 11th, and
12th.  This section details interviews I conducted at the booths
on the show floor.  I will continue to post sections each night
or so until I finish.


DIGITAL CREATIONS

The folks at Digital creations had three new products and seemed
quite proud of themselves.

First and foremost, of course, was Brilliance, their paint
program.  This program works in all of the Amiga's graphics
modes, including HAM-8.  It has a wealth of features, including
considerable animation abilities.

Most of you have probably seen the advertising for this program,
which shows a magnificent painted lagoon scene.  Now that the
program is shipping, Digital Creations shows the entire picture,
including the fish swimming about under water.  The promotional
material opens up to form a big poster of this picture.

Digital Creations has another genlock.  This one is called the
SuperGen SX.  It is a high-performance tool designed to handle
the more sophisticated graphics modes available on the newer
Amigas.  It has one slider apiece for the background and the
graphics, plus a switch to quickly disable itself for when it is
not needed.  It has both S-Video and composite inputs and
outputs.

Their most interesting piece of hardware was their video slot
box, available in late October.  This is a mini-tower case with a
230 watt power supply containing four video slots!  Once you hook
it up to your Amiga, you'll be able to use up to four devices
that make use of the video slot.

Some video slot boards are "active."  Only one of these may
function at a time.  The slot box will turn off all but the one
you select.  "Passive" boards, which just listen to the signals
on the video slot, may operate at the same time as other boards.

The box also holds three ISA slots (PC-AT style) with power and
ground only available.  Some time base corrector cards can be
placed in these slots.  It also has room for extra tape and disk
drives, which may be connected to the power supply.  It should
list for about $895.


VIDEOPOLIS R&D

Pat Keith and his son were showing off Videopolis' new product,
called the Video Palace.  This is another mini-tower case, but
this one holds an Opalvision card.  You can use it with any
Amiga, including those with no regular internal slots.  On
display was a 1200 showing an animation running on the Opalvision
card.

The case has a 200-watt power supply and can be used to hold
other things, such as a hard drive.  Mr. Keith said that he
planned to add a lot more features to the product.

The Video Palace was on sale for the show for $1200 and included
the Opalvision card.  Mr. Keith said that it was shipping and
would be sent out within 48 hours of receiving an order.


U.S. CYBERNETICS

RISC technology is clearly on the way to the Amiga, and it's not
going to wait for Commodore to figure out how to do it.

U.S. Cybernetics was showing off their prototype processor cards
carrying Inmos chips.  One model uses the T805 processor for 4.3
MFLOPS performance, while the other uses the T9000, for 50
MFLOPS.  The chips are designed to operate in parallel, to work
in conjunction with each other and with the Amiga's main
processor.  With an external box, up to 40 processors may be
installed.  If used properly, in parallel, this will give full-
blown supercomputer performance.

Programs have to be especially written to take advantage of this
technology.  U.S. Cybernetics has a development system to let
programmers write programs in Parallel C.  The programs currently
being ported to the system include Pegger, Vista Pro, ImageFX, TV
Paint, Real 3D, and Cinemorph.

I happen to have a minor in computer graphics and extensive
experience in parallel processing, so this is quite interesting
to me.  For many applications, having multiple processors does
not speed up computation much.  However, ray tracing can be
tremendously accellerated with good parallel processing.  For
instance, with well-written software, a scene that takes 2 hours
to ray-trace on an Amiga 4000 could be completed in about seven
minutes by a box with ten of these processors.  Maybe faster.

At this time, U.S. Cybernetics is not selling their RISC boards. 
It is only interested in talking to developers who will port
software to the system.  Unless you are a developer, please
don't contact them yet.

The low-end version should be available around the end of
November.  It will list for about $750.


AVID PUBLICATIONS

Avid Publications were giving away free copies of their Video
Toaster User magazine, of course.  A subcription to this will
tell you everything you ever wanted to know about how to produce
neat stuff with NewTek's Video Toaster.

In addition to the regular magazine, they are coming out with a
16-page newsletter called LightWave Pro.  This is full of advice
for people using NewTek's 3-D graphics animation program,
LightWave.  If you contact Avid, they will send you a free sample
copy.

I had a particularly infuriating exchange with one of the people
behind the counter.  She saw my press badge and properly
recognized a fellow in the media:

"Have you heard any big announcements?"

No, why?

"We've got a big scoop!"

What?

"If you don't know, I'm not going to tell you.  You're
competition."

Aw, c'mon....

"No way."

I was ready to chew tacks in frustration after that.  I think I
know what it was now, though.

/// Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users
    --------------------------------------



                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA or through Tymnet from anywhere in
North America.  If you have an account on another Internet-connected
system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet programs, from
anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users can now Telnet
into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 - Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

 - The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software, online.

 - Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command.

   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES.

 - 35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

 - No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

 - Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

 - Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

 - Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

 - FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
 - Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  Usenet feeds into Portal many times each hour.
   There are 14 Amiga-specific Usenet newsgroups with hundreds of
   articles posted every day, including postings by Commodore 
   personnel.  Since Usenet is distributed worldwide, your questions
   and answers can be seen by literally hundreds of thousands of
   people the same day you post them.  

 - Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs

   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
 - All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

 - Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.

# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Tymnet 9600bps services is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

That number again:  408-973-9111.

Did you ever feel overwhelmed by the endless stream of technical jargon and 
acronyms that pervade the electronics industry?  Well, you're not alone.  
Acronyms have been around since the very first days of computers, with the 
ABC and the ENIAC, and programming languages with FORTRAN, T0 and COBOL, and 
even in companies with IBM and UNISYS.  Computer scientists wonder why 
they're having such a hard time writing programs that don't cause major
accidents.  Well, its obvious, isn't it?  The average computer scientist has 
so much brain power expended on remembering all this silly stuff that they 
couldn't code their way out of a paper bag!  I mean, even software designed 
to help make better programs has an acronym, CASE!  Unfortunately, unless 
NASA (hey, there's another one!) is planning on using the Hubble telescope 
to brainwash the entire planet into getting rid of all this pesky stuff, we 
as part of the computer nerd community must learn to live with it.  Of 
course, we at AMIGA, in the interest of keeping our own acronym and helping 
you remember yours, have compiled this rather inane acronym list for you to 
print out and keep in your wallet, so you can finally stop worrying about 
the difference between SCSI and IDE...

/// The InterNet via Email
    ----------------------
    by Robert Niles


Those of you that only have email access to the InterNet might feel a bit
limited at times on what you can do. In reality, you have more options
than you think. Last week we talked about how to use FTPmail, a system 
in which you can easily get files, even if you only have an InterNet 
email account. This week we'll talk about using InterNIC's WHOIS
(Netfind).


What is Netfind? 

There are various ways in which to find someone's email address. You know
of a friend that has an address, but whatever it is, you have forgotten.

One way is to use InterNIC's WHOIS program. InterNIC keeps a listing of
users on the InterNet who have registered with NIC. InterNIC doesn't only
keep a database of users on the net, it also keeps site and organization
information as well.

How do I use it?

Quite easily! All you have to do is send a message to 
mailserv@rs.internic.net, and on the subject line enter: WHOIS username
Where the username is the username of the person in which you want
information on. Also username can be substituted with an organization
name such as "itm.com".

Example:

To: mailserv@rs.internic.net
Subject: whois rniles

Additional "whois" commands can be placed within the message body, but no
message body is needed to process the request. The mailserver processes 
email requests at least once a day and will send the information you
requested to your email address.

Of course the easiest way to find someone's email address is to simply call
them up and ask them, but if that is not an option try the above.

Next week we'll talk about how to use Archie via the internet.

/// Federal Inquiry on Software Examines Privacy Programs
    -----------------------------------------------------
    By John Markoff



 The New York Times  *  Tuesday, 21 September 1993  *  Business Day
 ------------------------------------------------------------------

 SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 20 -  In a Government investigation with
 implications for free speech and privacy in the information age, a
 Federal grand jury in San Jose, Calif., has issued subpoenas to two
 software publishers selling versions of a program that protects the
 privacy of electronic mail and other computer data.

 The investigation appears to focus on whether the program has been
 illegally exported in violation of State Department regulations
 that control the sale of weapons and other technologies whose
 export the Government believes may compromise national security.
 The relevance of such regulations in the post-cold war era is the
 topic of growing debate in Washington, where communications and
 computer executives plan to testify before Congress on Wednesday.
 [Page C3.]

 The software program, known as Pretty Good Privacy, or P.G.P., was
 written several years ago by an independent programmer in response
 to Federal threats to crack down on the distribution of encryption
 software which is used to protect computer data by converting them
 into secret code.  No one can read the encoded information without
 access to mathematical keys - one that is publicly known, a second
 known only to the recipient of the coded message.

 The program has since been freely distributed around the world,
 used on thousands of personal computers and work stations.

 Receiving the Federal subpoenas were Viacrypt, a Phoenix company
 that plans to sell a licensed version of P.G.P., and Austin Code
 Works of Austin, Tex., which is selling a version of P.G.P. for
 other software developers to incorporate their own programs.  The
 grand jury subpoenas, which the companies received Sept. 9, ordered
 them to supply all correspondence and records related to the
 international distribution of P.G.P. and other information related
 to computer cryptography.

 A Customs Department official refused to comment on the case today.
 William P. Keane, the assistant United States attorney who signed
 the subpoenas, confirmed that there was a grand jury investigation,
 but said he could not comment.

 Both publishers said they had no plans to sell their products abroad.

 "I think they're more concerned with our intentions than what we've
 done," said Leonard Mikus, president of Viacrypt, which is a
 division of the software company Lemcom Systems Inc. of Phoenix.
 "They're on a fishing expedition, but this could become a landmark
 case that sets the limits that distinguish between electronic and
 conventional publishing."

 Battling the N.S.A.

 The investigation is the latest round in a growing battle in recent
 years between the National Security Agency and a variety of groups
 in this country, including high-technology companies, computer
 researchers and civil libertarians, over the role of coding
 software in protecting computer data.  The N.S.A., whose role is to
 monitor electronic communications around the world, has
 consistently acted to block the adoption of new technologies that
 would make its mission more difficult.

 But the widespread availability of high-speed digital communication
 links and inexpensive personal computers may make it impossible to
 enforce technology restrictions in the future - as the widespread
 international dissemination of P.G.P. has already indicated.

 President Clinton alluded to the problems of controlling
 distribution of software technology in a speech last week promoting
 the North American Free Trade Agreement.

 "Nothing we do in this great capital can change the fact that
 factories or information can flash across the world, that people
 can move money around in the blink of an eye," the President said.
 "Nothing can change the fact that technology can be adopted, once
 created, by people all across the world and then rapidly adapted in
 new and different ways by people who have a little different take
 on the way that technology works."

 Question of Legality

 Government regulations, enforced by the State Department, make it
 illegal to export cryptographic software without a special
 munitions export license issued for weapons sales.

 Those restrictions have angered many computer industry executives
 who argue that encryption software is the crucial technology
 underlying a variety of information-age services, ranging from
 secure electronic mail to computerized payment of bills.

 Last year, a number of United States software companies,
 represented by the Software Publishers Association, a trade group,
 struck a deal with the N.S.A. permitting them to export software
 that contained coding functions.  Those codes, however, are
 believed to be easily cracked by the N.S.A. The P.G.P. software
 under investigation is thought to defy most N.S.A. code-cracking
 efforts.

 The legitimacy of the export regulations is also disputed by legal
 scholars who argue that they restrict freedom of speech.

 "There is a First Amendment right to speak in a encrypted way,"
 said Eben Moglen, a professor of law and legal history at Columbia
 University who is familiar with the case.  "The right to speak
 P.G.P. is like the right to speak Navajo.  The Government has no
 particular right to prevent you from speaking in a technical manner
 even if it is inconvenient for them to understand."

 Protection from Code-Breaking

 P.G.P. has been controversial since it was written by the
 programmer, Philip Zimmerman, because it uses a coding formula that
 many researchers believe powerful enough to protect information
 from even the National Security Agency's high-speed code-cracking
 computers.  The formula was developed by three well known computer
 scientists: Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adelman.

@toc "menu"


/// Usenet Review:  Llamatron
    -------------------------
    By Thomas Baetzler
    (s_walter@irav1.ira.uka.de)


PRODUCT NAME

        Llamatron 1.0


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

        Llamatron is a totally spaced-out shoot'em up game in the vein of the
classic William's arcade machine "Robotron" for one or two players.  To
quote from the accompanying ReadMe file:

        "Llamatron takes the Robotron idea and distorts it in a Yakly
        fashion, adding loads of new stuff and plenty of furry beasties in
        the Llamasoft style."


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

        Name:           LLamasoft
        Address:        49, Mount Pleasant
                        Tadley
                        Hants RG26 6BM
                        United Kingdom

        Telephone:      ++44 7356 4478


SHAREWARE FEE

        The author requests you send in 5 Pounds Sterling (UK) or more.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE

                None.  There are two versions of the game:  one for 512 KB
                and one for 1 MB or more of Chip RAM.  Llamatron works fine
                in both 68000 and 68030 mode.  I was not able to test
                compatibility with the 68040.  David Kinder reported that it
                works on the A1200.

        SOFTWARE

                To be able to run LLamatron on Kickstart 2.x and 3.0 systems
                or in 68020 or 68030 mode, you'll need the archive
                "fixllama.lha" from the "games/patch" directory of the
                Aminet ftp site.  You might also need the VBR utility
                (included in this review) or something similar to reset the
                vector base register of your CPU to the start of Chip RAM.

                Beware:  there are hacked versions of Llamatron floating
                about.  To use the patch, you'll need the original archive
                which contains two loaders and two data files.  You can find
                a suitable archive on the AB20 or AMINET_0693 CD-ROM discs,
                in "AB20/GAMES/ACTION". The hacked version included on
                Almathera's Demo CD-ROM will not work.


COPY PROTECTION

        None.  Llamatron will boot just fine off a floppy disk or load from
hard disk. I was even able to compress the main game file using the XPK
package, which saved me approximately 100 KB of disk space.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        My test setup includes:

        o       Amiga 2000, ECS chipset, Kickstart 2.04, Workbench 2.1
        o       Commodore A2630 68030 accelerator with 4 MB of 32-bit memory
        o       Picasso II graphics card


REVIEW

        Jeff 'The Yak' Minter has been a household name since the golden age
of home computing, back when the Commodore 64 was a hot machine.  He always
used to perplex players by taking a completely sane game idea and twisting
it until it had become totally crazy.

        Llamatron fits this description quite nicely.  It's the basic
Robotron game, with you buzzing around trying to fend off hordes of meanies
and saving your proteges in the process.  But as things turn out, you're not
a super-hero, but a fast spitting llama, and you're up against enemies like
phone booths, cigarette papers and screaming Mandelbrot sets.

        The game can be played by one or two players, and one or two
joysticks can be utilized in one player mode.  Using one joystick, you move
around spitting in your current direction, and you can lock this direction by
pressing the fire button.  Using both joysticks, you can play in the original
Robotron mode, where one joystick controls your movements while the other
directs your fire.  For beginners, there is a "droid" mode in which a
computer player assists you.

        The basic rule of the game is:  "If it moves, shoot it, and if it
doesn't move, it's an obstacle that must be destroyed".  An exception to this
rule are the various beasties waiting to be saved by you.  Move close to one
of them, and it'll follow you, and you'll get extra firepower for a short
time.  Saving the last beastie on the screen will give you a three-way
firepower extra.  If collecting the extra is the last thing you do in a
level, it'll be awarded to you in the next level.

        All levels start out with you at the center of the screen, and
various meanies out there to catch you.  Blast all of them into oblivion, and
you'll advance to the next level.  Your goal is to advance to level 99 and
destroy the Ozric Tentacle to get to Herd Heaven on level 100.  As you
progress, you'll encounter certain types of level over and over again.  On
the "Herd Levels", you'll have to try and save your beasties from the evil
brains that turn them into yucky mutant beasts.  On "Rain levels", you'll
have to catch all of the floating umbrellas to stop the rain while dodging
the usual set of adversaries.  Do well, and you'll be rewarded much-needed
extras, like super firepower, bouncing missiles, and (above all) extra lives.
Difficulty in the starting levels is low, but it increases steadily.  Almost
everybody manages to get to level 5 once they've familiarized themselves
with the control, and after a few games they're possibly up at level 10.
Beyond that, it starts to get nasty, and by level 25, it's sheer murder.

        The graphics are well done, by Commodore 64 standards.  On the Amiga,
they're definitely nothing to write home about.  From the first instant,
you'll be able to tell that this game wasn't done by Psygnosis.  But then,
this doesn't matter at all, since while playing you don't have the time to
look at them anyways.  Zap and blast effects are plentiful, however.

        The sound is limited to sound effects in demo mode and while playing
the game.  Jeff recommends to turn it up loud!  You might give it a try if
you want to drive your neighbors (roommates, parents, etc.) up the wall.
It's what you'd expect from a twisted brain:  screams and moans and
explosions, and even a bleating sheep.

        If you add it all up, you get a fiendishly difficult shoot'em up with
average graphics and some strange sound effects.  And yet, it all combines
to make a very addictive game that keeps you glued to the computer until
somebody arrives and demands that you stop the awful racket you're making.
Maybe it's the Minter factor that makes us return to this game again and
again.


DOCUMENTATION

        The original archive contains a large "ReadMe" file written by Jeff
Minter.  Besides the basic game instructions, it contains Jeff's explanation
of why games look the way they do, and much plain rambling.  If you're into
that kind of stuff, you'll surely enjoy it.

        The "fixllama" archive contains detailed instructions on how to
apply the patch.  Basically, you're just installing new loader programs.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

        Llamatron takes over the Amiga completely, which is fundamentally
evil from today's point of view.  Expect to get into big trouble if you run
Llamatron while other applications are writing to a disk.

        Highscores aren't saved, so you'll have to resort to Polaroid
pictures if you want to record them for posterity.

        Having Llamatron run unter the OS would sure be nice, but I just
can't imagine Jeff Minter writing OS compliant code.  And since he's quite
possibly off to program the Jaguar or the soon-to-be released Cray XMP
handheld, don't expect him to rewrite Llamatron using the lowlevel.library.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        If you're interested in other interpretations of the basic "Robotron"
theme, check out "Marketroid" on AmigaLibDisk (Fish Disk) 155.  It's Leo
Schwab's entry for the 1987 BADGE "Killer Demo" Contest, and it's still fun
to watch.  And yes, this runs fine on a 68030 Amiga running OS 2.04.  After
all those years!


BUGS

        Llamatron doesn't open its own screen, but tries to grab the memory
from the Workbench screen.  If you're in PAL mode, everything is fine.  If
you run Llamatron from a NTSC Workbench, you can't see some of the bottom
lines of the display.  Using other display modes will quite possibly crash
the program.  I am using a special startup script that resets the VBR and
switches to a standard PAL display before starting Llamatron to avoid
trouble.  Using a saved screenmode Prefs file, and the VBR utility, my
script looks like:

        screenmode use palmode.prefs
        vbr >NIL: ?             ; WARN if VBR is != 0
        if warn
                vbr >NIL:       ; toggle the VBR from Fast to Chip RAM
        endif                   ; and vice versa.

        This works quite nicely if no foreign windows are opened on the
Workbench.  Trying to switch screenmodes while there are non-Workbench
windows on the Workbench screen will prohibit the display mode change,
possibly resulting in a crash.

        The loader patches in the fixllama archives fix an incompatibility
problem with Kickstart 2.0 and above.  They were written by David Kinder.

VENDOR SUPPORT

        I have registered my copy of Llamatron back in 1991, and back then I
received a nice Zarjaz poster and a Llamasoft newsletter.  I don't know for
sure whether they are still in the Amiga business, but you might give it a
try.


WARRANTY

        None.


CONCLUSIONS

        A judgement of Llamatron has to be subjective.  Either you like the
game, in which case you'll find it brilliant, or you don't like it at all.
I happen to like it quite a bit.  There's nothing like 5 minutes of sheer
mindless blasting to unwind after a hard day's work.

        I rate it four golden furry creatures (out of a total five).

/// Aminet hits 5000 files
    ----------------------
    Reprinted from Comp.Sys.Amiga.Announce


Today, September 24 1993, 20 months after its foundation, Aminet has hit
a total number of 5000 online files. I'll seize that opportunity to talk
about how Aminet became what it is today, give you a few statistics about
current usage and size, provide some outlooks and finally thank the many
people involved in the creation of Aminet.


THE HISTORY
-----------

What would you expect to become of a software archive that is run on a
borrowed 25 MHz 68030 computer at the end of the world (ie.  Switzerland)
with only 50MB of harddisk space available for uploads?  A giant flop, of
course.  Well, this is how Aminet started.  How can it be that it didn't
just die before anyone ever heard of it?

The secret is that it's not just any archive, but an Amiga archive.  And
Amiga users are unlike the users of any other computer in the world.  In fact
it is the user community that keeps the Amiga alive and kicking now that it
has lost the technological lead it once had.  And it was the user community
that made that tiny little archive one of the biggest success stories on the
history of Internet.

When in January 92 I took over the small archive that the local students'
club (ICU) ran on a computer donated by Commodore Switzerland, I saw that
40 users logged in per day. I was impressed. Hey, that was happening
unnoticed while we were using that computer for mail, news and FTP. But
hell, 40 users a day are 280 per week, that's quite an audience, worth
taking some effort.

So I wrote the .readme collector, still the one thing that defines our
archive.  It generated the RECENT and SHORT file every night. And amazingly
many uploaders took the extra work of writing the special .readme files
needed to generate those file lists.  Slowly, the site started getting
popular.  Then, in April, came the ab20 shutdown.  People were desperate to
get a replacement, and many turned to amiga.physik.  Too many in fact.  We
had to install a user limit. And 50MB of disk space may have been appropriate
for a small unknown site in Switzerland, but for taking over all traffic
the job from the 250MB ab20 which had ruled Amiga FTP before?

This could have been the quick death of a promising archive since the
majority of users would have had to use another.  But not on the Amiga.
I asked my friends on the #amiga channel of IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
whether they had the resources to run a mirror of our site.  One of them had:
Peter Sjostrom.  First of May 92 was the moment when amiga.physik became
Aminet, a collection if interconnected FTP sites. I wrote some mirroring
scripts that allowed very frequent updates and forwarded uploads made to
his site in Sweden, making the two sites nearly equivalent.

This helped with our bandwidth problem, but the hard disk space was still too
small; we had to throw away files all the time to make room for new ones.  We
had no money for a bigger disk.  But we had the user community.  I placed a
message in the login text, and within a month we had enough cash for a 1.5G
harddisk Mike Schwartz cheaply bought for us in the USA.  Half of that money
came from Walnut Creek Inc., the company that had made the ab20 CDROM.  Quite
a courageous step back then, nobody knew what would become of Aminet.

Still, far more people wanted to log into amiga.physik than could, but more
and more people started mirroring our site, even if they only could afford to
keep the most recent 50MB online.  That finally brought Aminet on the road to
success.  More downloads created more uploads, which created more downloads
and so on. Breakthrough.

With the increased number of uploads, my workload got bigger and bigger, but
I got help from Chris Schneider when I needed it. Aminet started running
smoothly for quite a while.  Then came the catastrophe:  Because of the
significant traffic our site created alone, we were ordered by the university
to shut down the archive at amiga.physik in June 93.  Fortunately, Chris
Myers from wuarchive offered me an account and enough disk space so I could
move the Aminet main site there.  Isn't the Net a wonderful thing?  Now we
can easily administer an archive 6000 miles away from our home country.

Just recently the A3000UX that used to be amiga.physik found a new home at
EUnet, where it is now available to general public again, but only as a
mirror this time.

This is what happened so far, it's the violent history of the first 5000
uploads.  In a way I'm glad we can expect the next 5000 to be a lot less
exciting :)

THE FUTURE
----------

There's a few things still coming up:

  - Find servers. No need to log into some FTP site and download the
    index file in order to find out where a specific file is. Some kind
    of Aminet-archie.

  - ADT 2.0. This is going to be a very easy-to-compile, easy-to-use
    frontend to Aminet. O plan to strongly encourage its use once it
    is finished. It will also include AmigaDOS, mail server and find
    server support.

  - Unification with the Fish series. Fred and I are currently talking
    about merging our two series,

  - More BBS accesses for users of the CD-ROM without net access who
    would like to contribute.

                 Internet traffic local thereby.

The donors       for donating about $900, saving Aminet from an early
                 death

Walnut Creek Inc for paying another $800, and making available the CD so
                 cheaply, and giving free CD's to uploaders.

@node P4-6 "BIX"
@toc "menu"

/// BIX - Byte Information Exchange             Lots of information!
    -------------------------------


BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and enthusiasts.
While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is the place for 
knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  You're likely 
to find many others in similar situations who can offer advice, give 
technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.

BIX is divided into areas called conferences, each devoted to a 
particular area of interest.  They range from algorithms to windows,
from writers to amiga.  Conferences are categorized into groups,
usually referred to as exchanges, so that you can browse through
whatever groups interest you and see a list of the conferences it 
contains.

These are some of the exchanges on BIX:

amiga.exchange - the place for Amiga developers and enthusiasts
byte - the full text of each issue of BYTE magazine; source code too 
e.and.l - Entertainment and Leisure; music, pets, games, more
ibm.exchange - everything from OS/2 to PC clones
mac.exchange -  Mac news, support, software, advice
professionals - consultants, engineers, financiers gather here
programmers - some of the best brains in the business!
wix - the Information Exchange for Windows; Windows Magazine online
writers.ex - the professional and amateur writer's exchange


************FULL INTERNET ACCESS!************

BIX also features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription. 


================================

 - West Chester, PA
   ----------------
   It's confirmed.  Jim Dionne announced his resignation during a conference
   with developers at the World of Commodore show in Pasadena a few weeks
   ago.  Effective September 20, 1993, Jeff Stilley is the new General
   Manager of Commodore U.S., and Dionne's position as president will not be
   filled.


 - Duluth, GA
   ----------

   Primerica Corp. has announced its intentions to purchase the remaining
   73% of Travellers Corp. that it does not already own.  This will make
   Primerica one of the largest financial asset management companies in the
   country, with assets estimated at 100 BILLION dollars.  That's five times
   larger than Wal Mart, and nearly ten times larger than Coca Cola, for
   comparison.


 - Renton, WA
   ------------

   A rumor making its way through the grapevine has it that Bill Gates
   received a speeding ticket a short time ago.  The next day, the officer
   issuing the ticket had been fired.  So much for justice...


 - Tracy, CA

   A new product may possibly come out on the market. Called "The VODEM".
   The Vodem project is a project that seeks to use a patented device 
   called a vodem (VideO DEModulator) to send info over Cable TV at speeds 
   of 40-160MB/hr.  The Vodem project is specifically dedicated to providing 
   a truly free one-way feed of internet mail and Usenet news.  Commercial 
   applications may follow. Unlike all of the other technology, the Vodem 
   requires a purchase of the device itself, should be about $150, possibly 
   less. "Everything else I've seen costs between $600-$1500 or more."

Oliver North, in a speech September 22, 1993, said:

"The average term length of a member of congress is approaching 15 years,
and the average term length of a convicted criminal is less than three.
We've got that backward."

Our machine is a 386/33 with 20MB of memory, 1GB harddisk and upcoming
CD-ROM drive. The BBS software is a Norwegian origin MBBS running in
a DesqView window. 

We have over 6000 files online (no CD-ROM yet) containing titles for PC
and Amiga or both like GIF-pictures, music-modules and text-files. The
upload/download ratio is a very lousy 1:100.  (i.e. you upload a 20k file
and may download 2MB).

Messages are mainly written in Finnish, but English is widely used by
Swedish-speaking and international callers.

Download-access will be granted when asked. Also Amiga-areas are available
for those who will need them to avoid 'wars' between PC and Amiga users.
Access to sex pictures and stories are only for persons over 18 years
and given when requested.

Every user has an access to download filelist (LAHOFIL.ZIP), list of
Finnish 24-hour BBS's (BBSLIST.ZIP or BBSLIST.LHA) and every issue of
the Amiga Report Magazine (AR101.LHA-AR1??.LHA) on their first call.

The system is 4.5 years old and sponsored by the local telephone company,
Vaasan Laanin Puhelin Oy.
