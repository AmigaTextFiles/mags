Wow.

That's really all I can say when I look at Amiga Report these days.  So
I'll say it again.

Wow.

As of Amiga Report 1.04, April 9, 1993, the editor, Rob Glover, considered
a 120k issue to be rather large.  AR listed only two dealers and two
distribution BBSes.  Straight text.  A press release for PageStream 3.0.
Rumors of the Amiga 5000.

AR 1.10.  More dealers, same format...rumors of the Amiga 1400.

AR 1.15.  Hey, now we're getting somewhere.  Robert Niles' arrival means
AR goes to AmigaGuide (little-known fact: Niles, even as "technical
editor", was the guy AmigaGuiding the magazine all along, which is really
the hardest part...now I make Copy Editor Katie Nelson do it, as I
discovered upon taking over the editorship that I'm not particularly good
at it.) A non-US BBS is on the list, which is 4 BBSes long.  Oh yeah, AR
still carried NewsBytes.

Fast forward to the present.  Amiga Report has dozens of official
distribution BBSes, has repeatedly been the #1 AmiNet download on weeks it
is released, and our dealer directory is so big we've separated it by
continents.  Oh yeah, and we manage to find enough material in 2 weeks or
so to put out a magazine which often breaks the 200k barrier.

So we've had to cheat and kick it down to 2 weeks.  For that, I do
apologize...I myself remember looking forward to its arrival on Friday
nights or Saturday mornings every week.

Anyway, I had a point, and it's this: I'd like to thank everyone who has
been a part of Amiga Report up until now-specifically the readers.  There
are thousands-some say tens of thousands-of you out there now.  You're the
only reason we're doing this, because AR is certainly not a cash cow, as
our writers will attest to.

And to those writers, who have so generously given up their work free of
charge-thank you, and keep it up. :)

Why stop now?  There's no place to go but up, as long as you keep reading.
We'll find things to talk about.

Speaking of which:  Be sure to check out the details of the CEI conference
on IRC this Wednesday (the 23rd) at 10:30 PM GMT (5:30 PM EST).

As for CEI, they've been up to a few things lately.  They started selling
off the items they bought at the C= US auction in September.  On the menu
are CDTVs, CDTV-IIs (CDTVs with built-in floppy), 1950 monitors, and even
some C= 65s.  Some 3400 motherboards (predecessor to the 4000) have been
found, and they even have a 3000+ or two (probably not for sale, though.)

Watch for Games Editor Sean Caszatt to join the staff in the near future. 
Sean, editor of Amiga Entertainment Monthly, has agreed to end AEM and join
Amiga Report.  We look forward to his contributions.
  
On the buyout front: No word from C= UK lately other than this:  The
DevCon that they were planning for before the WOA show at Wembley will be
rescheduled to February 1995, but they do want to hold a half-day session
the first day of the show to get everyone together.

For CEI- they had people in the Philippines last week checking the
available inventory.  In short, many boxes are mislabeled and a significant
portion of the inventory itself is damaged: returned 1200s with "failed"
test tags and the like.  CEI wants to adjust its bid to reflect their
disappointment, but still would like to sign their contract by Wednesday.

Stick with us: we'll keep on top of it.

Jason

P.S.  Many of you have asked for an Amiga Report Index.  There are
currently at least two in the works, and I'll try to get at least one of
them before the end of the year.  It will definitely include all
AmigaGuided issues (1.14 to present).  We'll include 1.01-1.13 if we're in
a very good mood.

*** I'll be on vacation in December.  Starting December 10 and lasting
until the first week in January, I will be at a different address.  I will
still be able to check the voice line, but faxes and mail to the currently
listed information will not reach me.  For that time period, use
1203 Alexander Ave.                       FAX: 708-741-0689
Streamwood, IL  60107

(E-Mail will still reach me)

Hi, Jason I just wanted to drop a note to you and your staff to let you
know what a great job you and your staff are doing to keep the Amiga Users
informed on the lastest product and news about the Amiga.  I wish that you
worked for amiga world and maybe they would have a good mag.  I have used
the Amiga since 1987.I was the subject of an article in the old Commodore
magizine in July of 1988 about using the Amiga in Video production.  I
firmly beleive that the amiga is the best computer for video production and
Mutimedia.  My company now Provides companys with infomation systems based
on the amiga, needless to say we are trying to hang on until something is
resolved with the current state of confusion.  Let's hope the the attorneys
involved with the handling of this feel they have made enough money and can
get on with it, so that people like myself can continue to use the amiga to
run a company that has a lot of potential in this new age of the
information highway.  Once again thanks for amiga report, and the best of
luck to you and your staff.  Keep up the great work.

    Darkseid wrote a fairly enjoyable note basically about Microsoft doing
something for the Amiga some day in the future.  I feel the need to voice a
dissenting opinion about that.  Support of a company like Microsoft is
something I personally would oppose on political grounds, as they have yet
to involve themselves in my life.

    I think a brief hop down memory lane is in order.  I remember reading
that Microsoft wrote a version of Basic for the Amiga.  I also remember
that it was not very good.  Was it A Basic?  I've used (like everyone else
has) their products on other platforms.  They do the job, cost a fortune,
and have an appetite for resources.  They also crash, some more than
others, but they crash in a very uninformative way.  The question of "what
did I do?" never gets answered.

    I personally think that Microsoft's employees aren't going to be given
either the go-ahead or the information to put to use the OS or the chipset
to its proper form.  For instance: I'd be willing to bet Microsoft is the
only company capable of messing up multitasking (okay, yes, there are
programs like Caligari which interrupt multitasking, but it is legal as an
exec call), and I'd also bet that a spreadsheet from them wouldn't take
advantage of a math coprocessor (as opposed to something more integrated,
like one in the CPU).  If Microsoft wrote Amiga software, we'd get a lower
standard by buying their stuff.

    Of course, there's the other thing: Bill Gates seems to have more power
over the world than Clinton does over the USA.  If his software became an
Amiga presence, I fear it would become yet another reason not to buy an
Amiga.  I don't want to think that Microsoft has as much credit for the
computer world as we know it, but it does.  By inviting a monopoly
presence, we are going to trouble the splendid diversity which I have
always relished in the Amiga community.  However, I am not afraid of
Microsoft entering the market.  If they write good software, so be it, but
they are up against some real gems (take your bows Amiga programmers, you
deserve it), and something tells me they will really have to change their
style to enter the Amiga market and go anywhere.

Future!?

If there will be a future for the Amiga there is some things that are very
important.  Read on Alex, David and anyone who may be in charge of the
future of Amiga.  Here we go:

1.CD-ROM:
  There must be GOOD CD-ROM options for all AGA owners!  A PCMCIA solution
  is good, BUT it must be at least 100% CD³² compatible!  Another solution
  to the problem is a SCSI-II CD-ROM and a turbo/memory card.  But then
  good software for CD-ROM must exist from Amiga International (or what
  they company will be called).  CD³² games, photo-CD etc.  etc., you name
  it, it must work!
    The A4000 owners who need CD-ROM with CD³² and FMV must get a chance to
  get it cheap.  A SCSI CD-ROM and a FMV/Akiko-card should be a pretty good
  thing to go for.  The Card must have TV and S-VHS cable output and the
  FMV must be able to be outputted in the TV/S-VHS output, the normal
  monitor and in both at the same time.

2.Turbo/memory:
  The 030 cards fore the A1200 is far to expensive and the 040/060 for the
  A4000 is very high priced!  Get the prices down.  Talk to Motorola, buy
  them out (dream on:-) ) or whatever.  We need cheaper high speed CPUs.
  The PC market got it and the Amiga needs it to survive!  Also an A4000
  with 060 is needed!  SCSI-II options for A1200 (with turbo/memory) should
  be nice.  A new A4000 (called A4000B or something) with better (and
  faster) memory, CPU (030 50Mhz, 040 40Mhz, 060 50/66Mhz), fSCSI-II should
  be the right thing to do NOW.  MagicWB and Magic User Interface!?  Get at
  good look at them...

3.Prices:
  The Amiga is too expensive! Get good deals out. Here is one
  example:

  * A4000/040 (with a new and better 040 card running 40Mhz and high speed
    memory).
  * CD-ROM (but not FMV)
  * 10 megs of memory or more
  * Final Writer 3.0
  * 4 good games (including least one on CD)
  * 2 months free access to InterNet (modem link)
  * A modem (14.4k or 28.8k)
  * A good monitor (C1940->)
  * Magic WorkBench (too cheap and to good to be left out)
 (* Emplant card for PC/Mac)

  All this for £1400.  Mac owners will change platform quick!  This how it
  should be...
     The cost for an A4000 shouldn't be so much higher that a PC/Mac is a
  better economic choice.

4.Software:
  Lower the prices a bit for games (including CD games).  Lets say loose a
  £5 and put a roof at £25.  To compete with music CDs, books, movies and
  other stuff like that, there must be good prices.
    Those pirates cracking games, they could be very useful as real coders!
  They sure as hell knows a lot about the Amiga and coding.  Use them
  instead of break them.  And all those traders, bust 'em.  They do not
  know anything useful anyway...  Look out for the 'ELITE' BBS's and those
  fools who copy CDs!
    Get good 'serious' software out!  All that MicroSoft products like
  Excel, but with the look and feel of Final Writer and the Amiga.  No
  windows here!  Work as closely as possible with the guys from Scala,
  NewTek and others.  Get SAS to make good C and C++ compilators again.  Or
  if they won't.  Buy SAS C for the Amiga and get those who worked on it to
  work for you.  They are too much needed to go away.

5.Future Amigas:
  Don't make a Windows Amiga.  I won't buy one.  And I don't know ONE
  person who would...  No matter which RISC you choose.  Make it a real
  Amiga with an Amiga OS, Blitter, Copper, WorkBench and the whole lot.
    What about that Amiga Card for the PC?  What the hell are you doing?
  The PC DOSEN'T got what it takes to run like the Amiga.  Crap memory
  system!  No copper, blitter, this means a new monitor !  And they
  keyboard is pure shit!  And not to mention to crappy busses!  And that
  Intel thingy!  DO NOT MAKE IT!  Lower prices on the A4000/040 is much
  better.  And get a PPC/Pentium card for it.  And don't forget that if it
  gets cheaper, who the hell will by an Amiga?  And who the hell wants a
  PC!  Get real...

6.InterNet:
  Get good deals for Amiga owners to get InterNet at home (modem link or
  direct link).  Get the necessary software and make other companies aware
  that the Amiga or on InterNet to stay!  Mac and PC are the much ahead
  today :-(
   A InterNet/Multimedia kit for the A4000 should be useful.  DSP for FMV
  and MPEGs from InterNet.  Much better sound (mainly for internet) and
  Akiko.  Put a SCSI CD-Rom to it and mark it for the cost of a expensive
  soundcard and CD-ROM for the PC.  You get an InterNet connection as
  'extra'.

7.The users:
  The best users in the world.  And don't you ever forget it!  Listen to
  what they have to say.  They know what the public wants and what the
  public can pay.  They can tell you what to improve and what to avoid.
  Give us good support and it will pay.  Belive me!

8.Commercials:
  Beside the usual TV and Magazine stuff you should think about getting
  known for real!  Get as many TV stations, film/special FX makers to use
  the Amiga and SHOW IT!  Get some Super Amigas (060 66Mhz and super
  graphics card (Boasted Toaster?)) to be the number one in computer
  rending.  That is what I call getting people's eyes open!

9.Other things then pure Amigas:
  I want the credits for this and all what that means.  OK?  I think that
  the Amiga CD32 could be used in a different way...
   A few days ago I saw Pioneers LaserDisc system, Karokee and Hi-Fi.  What
  about a product including LD, FMV and CD32 (with 28Mhz 020 and 4 MB fast
  for better games and PhotoCD)!  Make it work with CD-movies, PhotoCD,
  LaserDisc, Normal CDs and Amiga CD32 games.  Make it able to control the
  eq., TV (colour, contrast etc) and things like timers.  It will be a
  smash hit!

That's all for today.

Since you put a new issue out lately I suppose you got a lot of mail but I
thought I would drop you another line to tell you that your newsletter is
looking better all the time and I consider it the premium source of info in
the US on AMigas (or the world for that matter).

Also I would like to add an article idea: many are purchasing used AMIGAs
now (myself recently - a 2000 030)and have no idea what we cand do with is
or add to it.  Can you use VGA like the 1200?  What is possible?  This
would be a great on-going article about the many machines now being resold
to new users.  Also the 1000.

In closing I would like to mention that I work for a company that makes
floor scrubbers (Tennant - in Minneapolis) so be careful what you say about
them.  Do you want GIFs for your collection?

===========================================================================
==                          Darkseid's Opinion                           ==
===========================================================================

[The opinions expressed herein are Darkseid's fault.  Amiga Report's
editorial staff takes no responsibility for him.  :) -JC]

If I remember correctly the Sega Megadrive/Genisis use a Motorola 68000 as
their base processor along with a few 6852s and a few custom chips.  The
Amiga family use the 68000 series, 68060 anyone ??.  Now if Ive read
correctly, Commodore Uk under David Pleseance, MBO is being backed by the
Chinese.  This particular firm knocks out Sega compatible clones, at a
greatly reduced price, without infringing any copyrights.  What say the
tech heads get together and build a cross platform that can run Sega carts
/cds and Amiga cds/floppies.....  AMEGACD64 anyone ......  Maybe Im being
paranoid but then again..........

The risc based floor scrubber....  Lew Eggebrecht has announced a new
development in the processor.  With a new gate array design the scrubber
can now run at 4.2 mips (Meter ImPecably Scrubbed) and with the new fpu can
use 3d routines to clean well into the corners.  Unfortunately teething
problems have led to the inline cd drive being scrapped due to it jumping
tracks when the scrubber is running at full capacity.  The 68060 is being
considered for a budget model, this how ever will only be able to run at
3.13 mips due to restrictions in the dma (direct Mopping access) and a
hereditary fault in the vram adaptor (it cant get Mtv).  The new risc
scrubber is being tentatively called the Fs1800rs and will come with power
steering, air conditioning and alloy wheels as optional extras retail price
is expected to be in the region of $1250.99.  ;)

The 68060 and its uses for the future.

A 4000/60 is an attractive prospect, its specs say it is at least 45-50%
more powerful than the 040, say ...  what happened to the 050?...  As per
usual, motorola are releasing the standard clock speeds, but I would say
some naughty people will clock em up a bit with new timer chips, see most
of the 1200 ram/accelerator cards, mind you they are running well within
their operating tolerances but it could, no will shorten the life span of
the chip.  Back to my topic, most US (oxymoron methinks) will be most
familiar with the Amiga through the Video Toaster, which goes to show it
takes more than a fast cd drive and speakers to make a multimedia machine.
Whereas Eurousers (Hmmm goood combination) will be more used to it as a
games/work machine.  For the games player, the 060 aint gonna make a blind
bit of difference, well not for a few years yet, mind you flight sims would
be simply stunning and Frontier (Excellent 'game') would be completely jaw
dropping 68000-020 is impressive but that whooooarrrhhggghhhh.  Work users
ie home dtp/video titling again not that much of an impact, maybe if you
are heavily into 3dart/rendering (and win the lottery ;) ) it would make a
difference.  The place where it 'will' make most waves is inside the
toaster, I know you can get the screamer ($12,000.00 >8^O) or the Oven both
of which are very quick.  The 060 however will slot onto the mother board
taking up less room and for all those who got mmu/fpu less 68lcs provides a
great way of powering up your machine (030-060 whoo baby).  The power the
new chip gives 'could' mean that the time spent rendering could be slashed,
Sgi machines are very good at that, the 060 cant quite match them but smart
people do all the work during the day and naff off home at night leaving
the machine to render away quite happily overnight.....  So to sum up, for
now the 060 is an expensive luxury, most users won need it, but if youre
serious about rendering, or its your job and you dont have some sort of
accelerator already the 060 could be what you need.  As for me, well Im
only a student, running one of the last 1.3 500s (soon to be wb2.04), and I
sont have much cash, Ah well I wonder would the bank let me mortgage my
liver or kidneys...........

[Yes, we realize the Screamer isn't really available, but he doesn't.  -JC]

The macs use the 6800x0 motorola chips as their cpu.  The powermacs use a
risc chip as their cpu, they run most of the old software as well as the
new specially written applications.  The Amiga uses the motorola 6800x0
chips as well, does it not follow that the Amiga risc could 'borrow' the
powermac cpu for use in 'the next generation' or perhaps to help in the
design of the AmigaRisc.  The AmigaRisc in my opinion (for what its worth)
is a good idea but I feel that the custom chip setup which gives us the
flexibity (unless youve got wb 1.3 ;) )we 'enjoy' is still appropriate so
rather than designing a super quick cpu which has to do it all ala the
powermac/pc or pentium (boooo hisssssss) that the ARC (amiga risc chip)
should consist of a modularised unit, with Denise/Gary/Paula/Agnus et all
being built into the ARC which would allow the power/speed of the cpu to be
used for the processing and not being slowed down by having to generate
beeps and throw memory around, compare a 286 pc to a 500, to see what I
mean, the pcs chip has to do all the work and thus is sluggish (the chips
are similarly aged) whereas the 500 although slower (in clock speeds) can
keep up and unlike the pc has windows (1.3 heheh) and can multitask, no
please wait printing garbage.....  I hope you can see what Im getting at
here.........

                      The Gateway Amiga Computer Show
                             ----------------
                          Report by Geoff Miller

   The Gateway Amiga Computer Show was held in St.  Louis, MO on October 29
to the delight of many Amiga owners throughout the Midwest.  Even though it
was actually just a gathering held by the St.  Louis area user group, it
was very well executed and had a large attendance.  It was, of course, the
only North American Amiga show held this year!

   Here's a quick run-down of the attendees: Amiga Game Zone magazine (of
course), Amiga Library Services (Fred Fish's son was manning the booth,
having brought as many CD-ROMs as could fit in one suitcase - he flew
here!), Simple Stat Graph, Fairbrothers, Video Assistance Company &
Comp-Ani Video, Data Management and Research, Pure Logic Software (they had
their cool Wolfenstein 3D engine running on an accelerated A1200), Memphis
Amiga Group, Oregon Research (new products included Termite, a new terminal
program), Data Grafix, Noahji's (no show?), Lab Software, Cedar Computer
Center, River City Technologies, Gateway Amiga Club, Innovision Technology,
Scharp Products, Digital Imaging, Bytes for a Bit, CUCUG, Soft-Logik
(PageStream 3.0, anyone?), Digital Castle, Fastrax, PJ Nordman FX,
Whitestone Publishing (AREXX Cookbook), Flasar's Recyclables, Micro Media,
A-Z Used Computers, Intangible Assets Manufacturing (Commodore software
engineer Dale Larson was the keynote speaker - he was also promoting his
book Connect Your Amiga!), Plato Computers, FERAL, Desktop Images, DC
Productions, MicroMedia, TFSnet, and ECI Computer Exchange.  (Whew!)

   There were classes held for AREXX, DPaint, DTP, and the Toaster.  Prizes
were given away on the hour (the grand prize was a Picasso board, won by
the show's chairman!).  There was even a consignment table for show
attendees.  Many people were seeking Amiga hardware of any kind (1200s,
4000s, monitors, accelerators, etc.).  CD-ROMs were very prevalent at the
show, which is an encouraging trend.  All in all, the show ran pretty
smoothly and was good fun for everyone involved.

                The Original Amiga Disk Recovery ToolTM

                        Now Better Than Ever!

DiskSalv 3 is the first commercial version of DiskSalv.  Developed by Dave
Haynie and published by Intangible Assets Manufacturing, it is the fourth
major revision of DiskSalv, and it offers features never before found in
DiskSalv or other Amiga disk utilities.  While it would be difficult to
list every new feature of DiskSalv 3 in a reasonably short announcement
letter, new features include:

* A Hot New Look

  The DiskSalv 2 user interface has been completely reworked.  While the
  best features have been retained, much has been improved.  The font
  sensitivity is better than ever -- why should a utility tell you which
  font you must use?  The overall look is cleaner, with graphical queues
  throughout that enhance operations without making undue demands on your
  system's memory or pretending to be a video game.  Gadgets and help texts
  are context sensitive.  Device selection throughout is drag-and-drop,
  though of course enhanced list selection is still available for the
  asking.  Interactive AmigaGuide links are provided for every gadget and
  menu function, available at the press of the HELP key.

* An Ounce of Prevention...

  A disk can now be checked for troubles without actually making any
  repairs, for extra confidence.  Deleted directories, files, and data can
  be permanently erased for added security, program releases, etc. 
  Traditional full or incremental backups are supported, in the same style
  as DiskSalv's recovery functions.

* ...And a Pound of Cure

  You still get traditional DiskSalv functions, only better.  Undeletes can
  often be performed in-place.  A fully redesigned filter mechanism
  supports pattern matching on full pathnames, file notes, dates, file
  sizes, and/or protection bits.  Pattern matches can be used to include a
  file in a scan, exclude it, or stop a scan on a match.  Any number of
  filter groups may be active at the same time, and such groups may be
  loaded from disk.

* When Time Counts

  A new intelligent prefetching disk cache, buffered file I/O, and improved
  internal design makes DiskSalv faster than ever.  The scroll bar
  calculations have been refined for greater accuracy.

* There's Nothing to Lose

  Device description editing and volume searching functions have been
  greatly enhanced.  DiskSalv can freely convert between its internal
  device format, standard Amiga ASCII format (DOSDrivers files), and Rigid
  Disk Blocks (the standard autoboot format).

* Going by the Book

  A complete, on-line AmigaGuide manual is included to aid both beginner
  and advanced user.  Details range from the basics through a complete
  theory of operation.  Decriptions of all DiskSalv file formats and
  associated C Language "include" files are also supplied.

  Environmental awareness is a DiskSalv tradition.  Back in the DiskSalv 1
  days, Dave encouraged folks to "register" the shareware by sending money
  to Greenpeace.

  After careful consideration of the environmental impact of printed
  manuals for frequently updated computer software, we have decided to
  provide only AmigaGuide documentation.  We believe that you will
  appreciate having completely up-to-date documentation with hypertext
  links and will appreciate our contribution to the health of our Earth.  
  Additionally, the entire DiskSalv package is reusable, so there won't be
  anything you have to throw away or recycle without getting at least one
  more use from it.

**SPECIAL NOTE: This offer replaces the "semi-commercial manual" for
                DiskSalv 2 offer made in the DiskSalv V11.27 release.
                Everyone who ordered the DiskSalv 2 manual will get
                DiskSalv 3 instead.

                If you purchased DiskSalv 2 with the expectation of printed
                documentation and are unhappy with receiving DiskSalv 3
                instead, we will cheerfully issue a full refund on receipt
                of your returned software and a note explaining your
                disatisfaction.

The following is information authorized for print by SoftWood, Inc.

FinalCalc (FC) is a high-end spreadsheet that aims at providing the Amiga
with something to compete with the top spreadsheets in the 'outside world'.

Its main formula recalc engine has been written to be significantly more
powerful than the current generation of spreadsheets.  The engine always
does a 'natural' recalc.  i.e. formulas are evaluated in the order of their
inter-dependancies, no matter how complex, making sure that the result of a
formula is correct.

The recalc engine always runs in the _background_.  The user never waits
for FC to recalculate.  You keep on editing cells while FC chugs along in
the background, catching up and updating the display as you work.  This is
very smooth and has to be used to be believed.  Even with this, the recalc
code itself is very fast anyway, recalculating only what has changed or
needs to be recalculated, not the entire project.

FinalCalc's user interface is designed to be both easy to use, and
power-user friendly.  Everything is keyboard/hotkey driven as well as mouse
driven.  Almost every function, requester, feature can be controlled from
the keyboard without using the mouse.  The user interface can come up on
any screen mode and use any Amiga font, even changing the screen mode
and/or the user font on the fly.

FinalCalc supports multiple sheets per 'Project'.  (a project can consist
of 1 to 254 sheets, each containing a maximum of ZZZ (18277) columns and
65000 rows.)

I won't go into more details now.. but FC has very powerful printing
features, great 2D and 3D graphs, more than 630 arexx/script commands, and
tons of features.

If you have any questions or comments... I'm here.  (smile)

Khalid.

We will mail information and upgrade offer later this month.  Here is
what's new in FW3:
- drag and drop text editing
- type and spell--option to spell check as you type
- dictionary hyphenation option
- easy page numbering without the need to know about master pages
- easy header/footer setup without the need to know master pages
- enhanced text selection including triple-click, quad-click, shift
  extended selection, and enhanced text selection while dragging mouse
- "no warning" auto-save option
- polygon and beizier special shape drawing tools
- selective display of master page items on first only, all but first, and
  all pages of section
- enhanced page number formatting
- more precise "snap to" grid for graphics and text blocks
- ability to use more than one language for spelling and typing (requires
  purchase of extra dictionarys)

Most of the new features have to do with making FW easier to use.

Final Data was written in-house by SoftWood. Final Data is an easy-to-use,
flat file data manager--it is not intended to stack up against SBasePro.
Its purpose is to provide a simple, yet powerful way for people to
orgainize and print lists of information on their Amiga.  It is ideal for
tasks such as:

- name and adress lists (friends, customers, business contacts, etc.)
- collections of any type (video, CD, stamp, coin, etc.)
- reference material such as titles of books and periodicals
- home inventory, bills, birthday reminders, and appointments

Final Data is not a relational database manager.  Although many databases
can be open at the same time, each database contains one file and knows
nothing about other databases.

A Final Data database appears on the screen as a table with rows and
columns similar to the way a spreadsheet looks.  Viewing a database in this
manner lets you look at a lot of information at the same time.  Columns may
be narrowed or widened by dragging a column's border with the mouse.

Data is entered into cells in a similar manner as entering data into a word
processor or text editor.  As you go from cell to cell entering data the
program verifies that the information you enter is consistent with the type
of information expected.

Final Data can arrange data in any desired sequence.  A unique feature
gives you the option of sorting either an entire database or only selected
rows.  The search and replace feature lets you make changes in the same
manner as in a word processor.

You can print a database in either label or columnar report format.  Final
Data prints reports complete with page headings that included title and
page number.  Reports may also be printed with totals and row counts.

Labels can be defined in a variety of user-defined formats.  Labels can be
printed from one to many across a page.  Final Data uses a printer's
built-in fonts for maximum speed and readability.

Final Data was programmed fromthe beginning with ARexx in mind.  There are
over 75 Final Data ARexx commands that you can use to develop scripts.
There is also a user-defined ARexx menu you can use to acess your scripts.

@node P2-6 "IRC Conference Rules"
@toc P2

===========================================================================
==          Rules for the IRC Conference with Alex Amor of CEI           ==
===========================================================================

The IRC conference with CEI will be November 23, 10:30 PM GMT (5:30 PM
EST), unless something major pulls Alex Amor out of the office.  All
interested should meet in IRC channel #amiga, where I will invite you into
the conference channel from.

Thanks to Mr.  Harman (Boodah on IRC) for writing these rules up for the
IRC conference. 

Rules for the IRC conference with Alex Amor:

To keep this conference as organized as possible we ask that you follow
some simple rules.  We'd like to see conferences like is in the future and
it is doubtful that CEI company officials will want to return again if the
environment that they encounter is noisy, obtrusive, and rude, and it
certainly wouldn't do much to encourage other companies to hold IRC
conferences, either.

To maintain order in the channel, it will be moderated.  Only those persons
who are designated as channel moderators or channel monitors will have
channel operator status.  Any attempt at hacking ops on a netsplit will
result in immediate deop/kick/ban from the channel for the duration of the
conference.  Please don't spoil it for the rest of us.

Voice status will be given by Jason Compton who will be the head moderator
of the channel.  To ask a question, /msg him with a subject followed by a ?
The purpose of sending him a subject will be so that he can weed out
questions that have already been answered.  Please limit your subjects to a
few words so that Jason doesn't have to take the time to read things while
trying to monitor the channel.  Also, message Jason *ONCE*, not multiple
times.  Violation of this rule will result in kick/ban from the channel.
Due to the number of conference attenders expected, most likely individuals
will only be able to ask one question.  Also, exepect that not everyone
will be able to ask a question due to time constraints.  Jason will inform
everyone if time permits for another round of questioning from conference
participators.

     *****There will be no private messaging of Mr. Amor*****

Any /msg 'ing of Mr.  Amor will result in immediate kick/ban from the
channel for the duration of the conference.  Once again, please don't spoil
it for the rest of us.

Please keep in mind that all of us wish to see conferences like this take
place in the future.  This conference will be the first of its kind and we
need to take great care to ensure that it progresses with a certain level
of decorum.

===========================================================================
==  COMDEX/Fall '94                                     By:  Harv Laser  ==
===========================================================================

COMDEX/Fall '94 (the world's largest computer convention, possibly the
world's largest convention of any kind) is going on this week in Las Vegas,
Nevada USA.  Appx.  200,000 people are attending.  The casinos are really
empty and the hotel rooms are all about double or triple their usual
nightly rates to make up for the computer trade's apparent allergy to
gambling. 

The main hall at the L.V.  Convention Center is dominated by the boring
stuff (IBM, PowerPC, Lotus, Borland, Apple, blah blah etc.  who cares) but
the interesting stuff is at the other venue, the Sands Hotel Convention
Center.  (The Interface Group, the outfit who puts on COMDEX bought the
Sands a couple years ago and spent megabucks building the huge convention
center behind it).

Even that wasn't big enough so they converted the underground parking
garage into a whole 'nother exhibit hall floor in the complex.   COMDEX
used to take place in six or 20 hotels all over town but now all of the
exhibits have been conglomerized into just the LV and Sands Convention
Centers.  Of course, probably every hotel in town has "private suites"
where various corporations wheel and deal and wine and dine their customers
and potential customers.

(Parenthetically, I've always wondered how Bill Gates, the uncrowned "King
of COMDEX [tm]" gets in and out of the show halls.  I've never seen him.. 
I suppose maybe they've built a series of secret underground tunnels to
spirit him in and out, or perhaps he drives a beat up Volvo alone into the
parking garage wearing a wig and fake beard ala Michael Jackson when he
wants to visit Disneyland and go unmolested by raving lunatic fans)

So today I schmoozed and schlepped my way thru the "Multimedia" floor of
the Sands part of the show, aisle after aisle of hundreds upon hundreds of
corporate booths, some huge, some a single table, some famous, some from
companies I never heard of. 

Some were doing "boffo biz" as they say in Hollywood, while at others, one
might see a couple of forlorn looking guys in suits standing there staring
off into space wondering, perhaps "why isn't my product attracting the
babes?"

Everything and anything Computer-related can be found at COMDEX, from huge
ridiculously expensive hardware arrays right down to silly little desk
items with smiley faces on them.

I did spot three companies who are known to the Amiga community at large
and thought I would comment on what they were showing...

NewTek

They're showing ONE product.  LightWave, for Amiga, PC, and SGI machines. 
Same price for all of them: $995.00.  Everyone here knows what LightWave is
so no need to explain it.  While there may have been other Amigas at
COMDEX, the one in NewTek's booth was the only one I saw today

(and its monitor was turned off). 

Huge screens and monitors were running tapes of the various tv shows where
LW has been used: Bab5, seaquest, etc.  etc.  Lee Stranahan was working at
one station doing demos but the crowd was nothing like I've seen at NewTek
booths at other shows like SIGGRAPH (where the crowds are 10x more
render-oriented than they are at COMDEX).

Elastic Reality (formerly ASDG) Inc.,

Had their Mac, PC and SGI machines and were showing ER, the morphing
package on each of them.  The booth was quite crowded and demos were being
performed by various employees such as Bruce "CygnusSoft" Dawson, Jeff
"JRAGraphics" Almasol, and others.  On the monitors was a looping demo tape
of various films, tv shows, and commercials that ER has been used to create
effects for.  It was quite crowded and drawing a lot of attention.  Keith
"TRexx Professional" Williams has departed the company for parts unknown :(
and big bossman Perry Kivolowitz had left Vegas yesterday, so I missed
yakking with him.

Apparently ER Inc.  has been doing a lot of hiring lately evidenced by all
the new faces I saw working their booth.  They have overgrown their current
offices and are looking for a new one, a sign of success.  No Amigas in
their booth, though :( but Rick Unland was :)

(Rick was formerly with Commodore and for a while was involved with the
CDTV project under Gail Wellington's lead..  he's also worked for any
number of other Amiga products companies and is a good guy).

Play Inc.

This is the company you may or may not have heard about which is a merger
between a bunch of ex-NewTek folks (engineers and p/r people) and Digital
Creations, and Progressive Image Technology, the hardware outfit who made
all of DC's stuff like DCTV, SuperGens, etc.  This is Play's first trade
show booth, and they are showing their first product.  It's a PC product. 
It's called "Snappy". 

"What the hell is that!?" you ask as you scratch your head.  Well I'll tell
you.  It's a digitizer.  A FrameGrabber.  It plugs into the PC parallel
port, runs on a 9-volt battery, grabs any video source in 1/60th of a
second in 1500x1125 24-bit color resolution (yes, that res is correct) and
can save out to disk in the form of BMP, PCX, TIFF, GIF and JPEG formats,
in 1500x1125, 640x480, or 320x240 sizes.  It's a tiny unit, about the size
of a pack of cigarettes, it's portable, and they're bundling with it
special versions of Fauve Matisse and Gryphon Morph.  The whole thing
retails for $199.95 and it'll be in stores in late December this year.

Kiki Stockhammer, famous for years in the Amiga community for sitting on a
chair wearing a headset microphone and demoing the Toaster for hours on
end, is now sitting on a chair, wearing a headset microphone, demoing
Snappy for hours on end.  :).  Mark "the man in black" Randall was yakking
it up with booth visitors.  Laura "I was the NewTek girl before Kiki"
Longfellow was working the reception desk

(I was surprised to see her working for Play Inc.  for no particular
reason, but was pleased too, and she was looking VERY fine ;)

If I had a 386 or better PC with a buncha RAM and disk on it I would get a
Snappy.  It's a slick little device and it really produces beautiful, very
hi-res, very NON-jaggie results in the blink of an eye.  It is, if you
will, a 1994 DigiView/DCTV for PeeCees.  Comparisons are painfully obvious,
especially when viewed in the perspective that Play Inc.  is a combination
of former NewTek people andcurrent Digital Creations people.  But Snappy is
a slicker product than either of those were, and it contains Play's first
piece of custom silicon which Mark was proudly showing off like a rare coin
in a box.  Other Random Thoughts on COMDEX in no particular order...

-Mark Randall handed me what is the first "3D" business card I've ever
seen...  open the card and the die-cut word "P L A Y" pops up from inside.
(Do these people know how to spend money or what!)

-I had read a newsburp on Clarinet a couple months ago about how COMDEX had
"outlawed" Adult-oriented software at their shows.  Apparently they changed
their minds and then some.  The Multimedia hall had at least ten different
vendors (maybe more, I didn't stop to count) who were selling "adult" (or
"porno" if you prefer) CD ROM software of every description.  ALL of these
booths were crowded.  You open the COMDEX program guide (a FAT book that
weighs 3 lbs) and it tells you that COMDEX is not a selling show.  It is a
trade show for dealers, distributors, the press, mfr's reps, etc.  etc.
EVERY one of the CD ROM booths was selling product like mad.  And while
Adult CD ROMs have typically been GIF files, this is the first time I've
seen them in Kodak PhotoCD format, so of course I bought one to take home
for further inspection ;)

-These shows are expensive!

Just to walk into the exhibit halls costs $75.  But hardly anyone pays $75
to get in because practically every booth exhibitor hands out free entry
passes to their customers.  I got in on a free pass courtesy of IBM :)

How about $1.75 for a can of coke and $3.50 for a hot dog, everywhere
inside the show at all the food stops.  This is typical for large trade
shows but it's still outrageous. 

-I sat in on a couple demo sessions at some booths (mainly to rest my back
and feet after having lugged around 20 lbs.  of brochures and magazines and
other junk in a bag like everyone else) and got some free software which is
of course Windows stuff that I can't use but what the hell, someone will
want it.  One of the neatest things I saw was, believe it or not, a new
Kid-oriented CD ROM being published by the cable tv Discovery Channel.
This thing was absolutely delightful, filled with humor, surprises, and
excellent graphics and I was impressed.  There are some people out there
who know how to make quality CD ROM stuff with imagination.

-Getcher Free Magazines Here

Picked up a number of free copies of various rags, and also signed up for a
number of free subscriptions.  When you go to these huge trade shows there
are invariably any number of magazine publishers who will give you a one
year free sub just for filling out a form and checking a million little
boxes (like telling them how many billions of dollars worth of computer
stuff you're responsible for buying each year).  So I picked up a free
one-year sub to New Media and Morph's Outpost, and a couple others.
Morph's publisher has a brand new magazine out called "Blaster" and they
were handing out tons of free copies of the first issue.  This rag is a bit
hard to describe but I guess they're aiming it at the older skateboard set
who is into anything with the prefix "Cyber-" on it, and who appreciate the
finer points of Beavis & Butthead's subtle humor and who know what a modem
is.  I sat down and had a couple $1.75 cokes and read through it and it's a
pretty decent little rag so look for it on newsstands soon if not now.  Ya
might enjoy it, if the wild typesetting and graphics doesn't give you a
permanent migraine.

Well I could ramble on more but that's enough.  I'll be back in Vegas in
January for CES (The Consumer Electronics show) which I find to be
generally a lot more entertaining than COMDEX, and at which there is a much
better chance of actually seeing more than one Amiga in a two million
square foot exhibit hall.

(feel free to stick this posting in your user-group newsletter, online
magazine, bathroom wall, bird cage, or whatever..  just keep my name on it
which your parakeet can use as a target.

@node P2-4 "The Paranoia Story"

===========================================================================
==  The Paranoia Story                  By:  Ken Pierce                  ==
==                                           AGE Entertainment Software  ==
===========================================================================

    Because of the large amounts of personal email I've been receiving
asking what is going on with the game Paranoia, AGE Entertainment Software,
DEM Software and myself, I have decided to go public with the complete
story of Paranoia from day one.

    In May of 1993, Jim Georgeadis (the Paranoia head programmer) and
myself were working together at a computer store (Ace-Tech Computers in
Calgary, Alberta) and had been for some time.  We had bantered back and
forth the idea of doing a game together for a while, and we were sort of
playing with a beat-em-up concept as a PD release.  This game was to be
released at AmiJam'93 in Calgary, and was a TRUE example of the troubles we
would face in the future.

    The game was delayed and delayed, until AmiJam was upon us, and Jim was
quite literally working on the game in the Ace-Tech booth.  I had done some
cheezy Ren & Stimpy graphics, and we had added R&S sound effects to the
game as well.  The engine, though, was far from complete (although the game
was fun to play).  Eric Schwartz was one of the guest speakers at that
show, and re-did the graphics for the game (his were much nicer than mine,
I must say) but alas the game was never finished, and thus never released
into the public domain as we intended (although we did show it AmiJam and
it did get quite a response).

    Still, at least Jim and I knew we could work together on a project, and
we started talking about sitting down and doing something /serious/.  We
discussed the different possibilities, and Jim seemed to have a burning
desire to do a serious beat-em up.  I didn't think there was much of a
market for it, though, so we scrapped it.  From there we had to decide
where to go.  Jim also had a desire to a 3-D RPG of some kind, and I
thought there may be a market for *good* RPG since there had been so few
lately.  Thus began work on "the game", and tests to see if it was
possible.

    After about a month, Jim had a working copy of the engine up and
running, and we could see this thing had some potential.  It had crap
graphics, no name, no plot, no theme, no sounds, but it did have some line
drawn walls (filled with a really grotesque shade of orange) and a stick
man with a big red head that chased you arouund (Mr.  Stickman, who may
still be in Paranoia to this day).  The game worked in a step-mode way
(like Dungeon Master), and we thought we could get away with that if we
just made sure the game reeked of suspense and atmosphere.

    Work continued on the engine, and we started talking about possible
plots.  We thought of the standby D&D style plots, but scrapped those
because it had been done to death, and eventually stuck on a game which
would be like "playing" the movie Aliens.  We wanted to have the player
feel helpless and distraught while running through a maze, not knowing
what's around the next corner and being chased by vicious critters all the
way through.

    At this time, a demo came out called "DWAGA".  It was an AGA based
dungeon walking demo, which had smooth scrolling walls.  We looked at the
way the programmer of that game had done his engine (which we had
mentioned, but written off because we thought it would be too slow) and
decided that maybe smooth scrolling walls were the way to go.

    Jim began work on the next revision of the game engine.

    As he did that, I began to think of plot possibilities, keeping the
Aliens theme in mind.  That was when the basic plot of the game was worked
out.  You were on this ship, and it had been attacked by aliens.  The
aliens had boarded the ship, and you had to find a way off the thing.  It
was simple, but effective, and offered the opportunity for lots of puzzles.

    Now, Jim had the next revision of the engine done, and it looked ugly,
but effective.  At this point, we needed some real graphics.  I contacted
Bryan Ewert, who is a 3-D animator in the Calgary area.  He was on a hiatus
from work, and agreed to work on the project with us.  He did a few test
renders for us so we could see how his work was, and we liked it, so work
began on the interiors.

    At this point, I figured one thing that could add atmosphere to the
game would be several exterior animations at key plot points in the game. 
These would have a typical sci-fi flavour to them, and would help to keep
the different segments of the game attached.  They would also help to
explain some key elements of the plot (like how the aliens got on board in
the first place).

    I explained my concept for these animations to Jim and Bryan, and both
were quite excited by the possiblities offered.  Bryan, though, didn't want
the task of designing an alien and terran fleet of ships, so I told him I'd
come up with a rough idea of what I thought things should look like.  In
the meantime, he continued work on the interiors which were coming along
very nicely and Jim continued working on the game engine, which still
needed a lot of tweaking.

    This was around the same time that I was beginning to think we may have
something very special here, and it may be something that could really
leave its mark on the Amiga community.  This is when I began posting
messages into Fido AmigaGames describing the game, and when I started
receiving mail asking me for more information.

    Slowly, the walls were being finished and Jim was implementing them
into the game.  At this point, though, we started to realize how limiting
Chip RAM can be when working with these types of graphics.  We made some
design changes to the engine, and work continued again.  The new engine
wasn't as smooth as the old one, but it took a lot less RAM (it would've
barely worked in 2MB of Chip RAM the old way).  I wasn't happy about the
trade-off in performance, though, and asked Jim to try to find a way around
it.  With the new engine, though, Jim told me that the game could be done
in "4-6 weeks", assuming of course, that Bryan could keep up his current
pace with the graphics.

    I finished up my drawings (in DPaint) of what I thought the alien and
terran crafts should look like, except the freighter (which will come
later), and Bryan had a look at them and, for the most part, liked them.  I
also wrote up technical documents explaining how the ships "worked", and
this is the point where I began to think a bible may be necessary to keep
us from screwing up continuity in the game.  Besides, it could be quite a
help in writing the manual later on.

    It was also around this time that I approached my girlfriend, Lisa
Priebe, to do the music for the game.  She received some quick training in
OctaMED, and began work.

    Somewhere in this time frame, we showed the early demo (called
AlphaTeaser) to the Amiga Users of Calgary at a meeting.  It went over
well, and I still get asked about the game from local people because of
that meeting.

    Eventually we were coming into December of 1993, and the public was
getting kind of impatient while waiting for the game.  Still, I kept
adamant in my posts, saying that it wouldn't be released "until it was
done".  I was still disappointed that we had missed our September and
October deadlines, though.

    In December, I lost my job at Ace-Tech (which is an even longer story
than this one), but wasn't too concerned about it.  I figured I would be
able to hold out long enough for the game to be ready, and then with any
luck we'd be on our way to success and stardom in the Amiga games market. 
Then came January.

    In January of 1994, Lisa and I broke up.  This stalled the music
(which, quite frankly, hadn't gotten far), and stalled me.  I went into a
deep, dark depression, and at that point development (except for some
tweaking on Jim's part) pretty much stopped.  There was little, if any,
communication between Bryan, Jim and myself, and Paranoia was at an
effective standstill.

    In the beginning of February, I came out of my depression, and work
began on Paranoia again.  Still, Bryan had started doing some very serious,
and very time consuming work on an animation with JW Lees Developments, and
eventually had to drop out of Paranoia.

    Still, though, even with Bryan gone, the game progressed at an amazing
rate.  Jim had managed to pull off some astronomical acheivements in the
game engine, and things were looking good.  At this point, we started to
discuss sequels to the game more seriously, and worked out a plotline which
would cover three games. 

    In the first game, the player would simply escape from the ship.  At
the end of the game, he would be seen landing on a nearby planet.  In the
second game, the player would be on a colony on the planet, and everyone
would be dead.  The player would have to figure out the mystery of what
happened on the colony while trying to find all the parts to repair a
damaged communications array and send a distress signal to someone so he
could be rescued.  At the end of the second game, he would be rescued, and
taken back to Earth.  In the third game, he'd have to go to the alien
homeworld where he'd be part of an attack squad which would be out to
destroy the alien civilization.  This last game contained lots of moral
dilemmas for the character to go through.

    After discussing these sequel possiblities with Jim, I sent out another
message on the nets discussing Paranoia, and its future sequels (assuming,
of course, that Paranoia was a success).  This was when things on the net
*really* began to buzz.

    There was still a lot of stuff to do on the Paranoia engine, though, so
we figured we'd finish what was on the plate, and then deal with the other
problems later.

    This was around the same time that Don Kittle came into the picture.  
Initially, Don and I were just friends.  Don had broken up with his
girlfriend around the same time I'd broken up with mine, and the two of us
hanging around together had helped us each to work our way out of our
depressions.  I knew Don was into rendering, so I asked him to pick up
where Bryan had left off in the graphics department.  At this time, just
about all that was left to do were the exterior animations, and I already
had diagrams for what they were all supposed to look like done.

    Don began working on some stuff that night, and by the next day, I had
the first render of a Hoarder Infestation Pod sitting on my hard drive.  I
was happy with the results, and he seemed happy with the project, so he was
officially "on the team".  We still didn't have any music, but Brad Lazaruk
(another friend) had heard us mumbling about sound effects on the Paranoia
mailing list.  He sampled some gunshots and sent them to us, and they made
it into the game in no time.  There were also some other sound effects from
sources all over the place which were being put into the game.  They were
inconsistent, and at times, simply poor, but it was better than nothing. 
And besides, they were just for testing.  We'd resample all the sounds we
needed later on.

    Also at this point, Lorne Laliberte paid a visit to Calgary from
Manitoba.  Him and I had sent mass volumes of email back and forth about
Paranoia, and knowing that he was a writer, I wanted him involved.  I
decided that Lorne was the person who would write the background story and
manual for Paranoia.  As soon as I let him know that I wanted him to do it,
he started work, and the email REALLY started to flow.

    By this time, though, money had started to run a little low (I had been
out of steady work for some months...I had managed to get a few temp jobs
in there, but nothing steady), and I had to give up my apartment.  I had
the option of moving back to British Columbia, which would have really
hampered Paranoia development, but reduced my living costs substantially,
or finding a place to stay for less money in Calgary (actually, no money).
I asked Don if I could crash at his place, and he said yes.  I didn't
realize at the time what a strain this would put on both our personal and
professional relationships.

    There were still a few weeks before I was set to move out of my
apartment, though, and so development on Paranoia continued at a breakneck
pace.  The final control panel (or next to final control panel in the end)
was in place, buttons were working properly, and the game engine was still
running at a good speed on a stock 1200 by the time I was making the move.

    I moved into Don's place, and for the first few days, things were fine.
Work was getting done on Paranoia, and I had managed to re-establish my
email feeds and had caught up on my mail.  Work on the bible continued,
including technologies, and the Paranoia universe was coming together
nicely.  Lorne's work on the story was coming together well, too.

    Shortly after moving into Don's place, though, something changed.  Don
wasn't around for long periods of time, and quite frankly, I saw him less
when I was living with him than before I moved in.  It didn't take a genius
to figure out that he was uncomfortable with the situation.

    Also, he had been going to meet with Jim regularly to work on the game.
That, to me, was fine, though because at least something was getting done
on Paranoia.

    Around here was when the teaser demo was (finally) finished, and sent
out.  That teaser demo refused to work on 68000 based machines.

    Some weeks passed, and eventually the tension got so bad that I started
spending nights at my girlfriend's house, and only went back to Don's place
during the days to do the work I needed to do.  Still, after about a week
of this, I decided to spend another night at Don's in the hopes of being
able to accomplish more (four or five hours a day isn't a lot of time) the
day after that.

    Jen dropped me off in front of Don's building, and I went in.  I
unlocked the door, but when I tried to enter the deadbolt was locked.  I
didn't have a key to the deadbolt, so I tried ringing the doorbell and
banging on the window.

There was no response.  Eventually I gave up, and started the long (and
cold, since I didn't have a jacket with me) walk over to Brad's place,
where I spent that night fighting off my allergic reaction to his cat.  The
next day, I went into Don's place and did the work I needed to do.  I left
before he came home that day.

    For the next while after that, I spent the nights at Jen's and the days
at Don's, which was inconvenient, but helped alleviate the stress.  One
day, I wasn't gone when Don got home from work.  After that day, he started
locking the deadbolt during the day.  That meant that my clothes, computer,
close to every possession I own, was locked away from me.

    I went in one night when Don and Jim were there, and grabbed my clothes
and took them to Jen's.  I didn't say a word to him in the time I was
there, and he didn't say a word to me.  That was when things got really
bad.

    I also saw the work they had been doing on the game at that point, and
had some problems with some of the stuff that had been done.  I let them
know the problems I had with the things they had done, and got into an
argument with Jim.  He said something to the effect of "well, why didn't
you say something earlier", to which I responded that I needed to know what
was going on before I could tell them what I thought of it.  Afterwards,
Jen showed up, and I left with her.   The argument was never resolved.

    I couldn't call Don, because I couldn't bear to talk to him with
everything that was going on, but I had to, because he had all my
possessions at his place.  I called Jim one day, and talked to him, and Jim
told me that there was no doubt that I was going to have to move out of
Don's.  I wasn't surprised at that.  That was the same day that another
mutual friend told me how Don was telling him that I was using his place as
a "garbage dump".

    I called Don at work, and told him that I had to talk to him.  I met
him at his place that night.

    We talked for a while about the various goings-on with the deadbolt and
everything else, and then we talked about the game.  He told me that him
and Jim had decided that I wasn't fulfilling their needs as a "publisher"
for the game, and that they had decided to form their own company to
produce the game.  He said they had already sent out press releases and
made an announcement on the nets to the effect that I was out and they were
in.  They had already formed the company (called DEM), and had already
contacted the european press about the game.  He said they didn't "slam"
AGE, but when he showed me the press release they had sent, I didn't see
how he could say that.

    Still, at that point, the friendship was more important to me than the
game, and I told Don that.  He explained to me that it was "never their
intention to screw me over", and that I would be receiving a royalty from
the game.  The amount was never (and has never been) discussed.

    I moved my essentials (especially the computer) out of Don's place and
into Jen's.  I was still confused about what was going on, in terms of
Paranoia and Don's and my friendship.  I still haven't heard anything from
Jim to this day, aside from little bits of chit chat here and there when
we've run into each other.

    At this point I had to leave town for my brother's wedding, but my suit
was locked in Don's apartment.  I stopped at the airport (where Don works)
and asked him if I could get a key to the deadbolt at his place so I could
get in to get my suit.  He told me that he didn't feel he could "trust me",
and that his computer was sitting there with Paranoia.  He told me he
didn't want me there without him being there.  This not only hurt me, but
insulted me, because I had thought I'd made my position pretty clear to him
during our face to face conversation a few weeks prior.

    That night, I went to Don's, and got the suit.  He asked me when I'd be
getting the rest of my stuff out of his place, and I told him I'd do it as
soon as possible.  Then I went to my brother's wedding.  I was gone for a
week.

    The rest of my belongings were still at Don's place through this time.

    When I got back, I saw Don briefly when Jen and I stopped by his place
to drop off an invitation to a Halloween party at Jen's place.  I was
friendly, Jen was friendly, and Samantha, another friend who was with us
was friendly.  Don took the invitation, thanked us, and never showed up for
the party.

    Don not showing at the party wasn't a shock, but the email I received a
few days later was.  I'll quote it here:


 DK> Hey;
 DK> 
 DK> I think it's kinda shitty the way you've basically 
 DK> assumed me to be a warehouse for your stuff.  Please 
 DK> remove it all by Thursday, November 3, 1994 or I'll 
 DK> have to dump it in the yard...

    At this point, I finally snapped and sent back a long reply telling him
how I felt about everything that had happened.  Jen borrowed her father's
truck, and we went there on the evening of Wednesday, November 2nd.  He
turned us away, giving us a feeble excuse that he was about to go to bed,
so we came back the next day.  Another friend of his was there that day,
and I never set foot in his apartment.  He put it in the hallway, and my
friends and myself loaded it into the vehicles and left.  I haven't seen,
spoken to, or emailed Don since.  From what I understand, Jim has been out
of town, although I haven't heard anything from him in quite some time,
either. 

    Another friend was telling me about how Don had said I, "never
contributed anything" to the game.  Quite frankly, I don't know if Don
believes that or not, because Don wasn't around in the early stages where I
did most of my work.  I will admit, that I wasn't as involved in those
later stages, but full blame for that can't lie on me.  I was never told
what was happening at any point in late development even when I directly
asked.  I'd receive runaround answers which didn't solve anything.  That
was when I made the decision to go public.  Royalties or no royalties (and
I *can* use the money), I was tired of being slammed both publically and
privately by these guys when they had no right at all to do that.  Don
tried explaining to me how I legally don't have a leg to stand on because
copyright law in Canada is so vague, but what I don't think Don or Jim
realize is that if I did decide to go to the courts with it, Paranoia would
probably die there because the work (and copyrights) would be split into
chunks.  I have friends in the legal profession as well, and they're very
well versed in Canadian copyrights.

    I don't plan on going to the courts with this story unless I absolutely
have to, because quite frankly I can't afford it, and neither can they.
I'm not a vindictive person, and I am moving on with new AGE developments.
I do feel I've spent a year and a half of my life devoted to Paranoia,
though, and that I do deserve compensation for that time. 

    This game has been the destruction of two of my best friendships (or
what I *thought* were my best friendships), and I'm not writing this
article simply out of spite.  I'm writing it, because my name has been
attached to all the hype and anticipation which Paranoia has received.
Quite frankly, Paranoia, as it sits right now is incomplete.  It's probably
around 70% done, and I don't want people to get the idea that I "approved"
this product as being done in its current state.

    I was told by Don and Jim that they wanted to get the game out to
market by Christmas, at all costs (including the release version being
buggy...and never having been playtested by anyone outside the development
team), and I don't want to be the one blamed for its shoddy construction. 
I've also been told by both Don and Jim consider the Amiga to be a dead
platform, and that Paranoia will be their only game on the machine.  They
like the machine, but they don't want to support it because there isn't
enough money in it.  They also scrapped the ideas for the two sequels for
the game, they said they had no interest in tying the game together with a
big plot (or taking a chunk out of their profits with a big storybook) and
they had no interest in doing a CD32 or AGA version of Paranoia.  These are
all things which were put a little more politely in their press release
(which I would've included had I still had it), but which are all in there
if you read it (it was posted to Fido AmigaGames sometime ago, perhaps some
reader has a copy of it in their archives?).

    I just wanted to set the record straight, and give my side of the
story.  I welcome an equivalent diary of events from Jim and/or Don.

    I'm sure that I've probably forgotten a lot of things in this story,
but I think everything major is in here.  A lot of things can be done in a
year and a half, but apparently Paranoia wasn't one of them.

    AGE is going to stay in the Amiga market, and their will be future AGE
products.  The next one is already in early development, and I hope to go
public with some details as to what it'll be in the near future.

    I'll keep this promise to the Amiga public, always.  A game will not be
released through AGE Entertainment Software unless it is something that I
as a game player would play.  The last time I saw Paranoia, it was not
something I would play.  It was something I would fiddle with, but not
something that would absorb me the way a good game should.

    Stay tuned, folks, because this one isn't over yet.  Thanks for your
support, and keep listening on the nets because I'll be back with a new

==  Emulation Rambler:  CrossMAC/MaxDOS             By:  @{"Jason Compton" link P8-1}  ==
===========================================================================

It feels good to ramble once more.

On my agenda lately have been the two Macintosh filesystems, MaxDOS 2.0
from Media4 Productions and CrossMAC from Consultron.  In a way, it's a
battle of new vs.  old...Media4, while not strangers to software
development or the Amiga, are making their first attempt at a commerical
product.  Consultron, on the other hand, is responsible for essentially
defining MS-DOS filesystems for the Amiga...you know them well if you own
CrossDOS or Workbench 2.1 and above.

The goal of both programs is the same: to provide
as-transparent-as-possible access to Macintosh floppies, hard drives, and
A-Max/Emplant hybrids for AmigaDOS.  The requirements are a decent
graphical interface to get to where you want (Macintosh devices mounted as
AmigaDOS device), and, most importantly, functionality.

Let's cut right to the chase.  Both MaxDOS and CrossMAC do the job.  I
have no major complaints about their primary operation.

There.  Done.  I can stop now, right?

Well, ok, I'll tell you what the differences are.

Mounting the Mac stuff:

CrossMAC and MaxDOS get your devices mounted in fairly similar ways.  A
graphical interface asks you to select a drive, then a partition.  MaxDOS
requires you to know a bit more than CrossMAC does about your system (the
unit number of your SCSI hard drive, but it's a number between 0 and 6, so
you can only be wrong so many times...) but they both get the job done.
Another primary difference is that while MaxDOS will automatically
generate a mountlist entry to your specification, CrossMAC will go so far
as to automatically place the device in your user-startup.

Reading the data...or is it the resource?

Mac files are stored in two parts: a "data" fork and a "resource" fork.
If you'd like the technical explanation, check out the program manuals.
In short, one tells the Mac what the program's all about and the other
tells it what to do with it.  The system, in short, is responsible for the
reason you can double-click on virtually anything on a Mac and get a
program to pop up...or, the flip side of the coin, the reason it's so hard
to do something with a file if it DOESN'T make a program pop up...

Anyway: Both programs need some way to represent this on the Amiga, so
they show them as two separate files.  MaxDOS calls the resource fork for
the file "blah" as "blah" with a superscript 2 after it.  (Yes, I know I
can type alt-2 but I'd like to ensure that readers everywhere get the
drift.)  CrossMAC calls it blah.rs.  Either way, you get the point.
You'll primarily be interested in the data fork, but more about that
later.

Floppy, floppy, floppy...

It's interesting to note that MaxDOS needs Consultron's mfm.device to read
high density floppies.  (If you've got CrossDOS or Workbench 2.1 and
above, you've got mfm.device.  If not, you'll need to get it from
Consultron.)  MaxDOS can also handle all makes of Amax and Emplant
floppies.  CrossMAC, not to be outdone, also goes to the length of
allowing the use of A-Max hardware (I/II or II+/IV) to read low density
Mac floppies: either of the external drive type for A-Max I/II or the
shared-drive type for II+/IV.  Again, both do the job.

...But, I could care less about the resource fork!

Not surprising.  MaxDOS allows you to filter out data or resource forks or
just show both by commodity control.  I was unable to find such a feature
on CrossMAC.

How does this all look, anyway?

Both programs incarnate their disks as Workbench icons, which open into
standard windows, and so it goes.  CrossMAC will show all files, unless
hidden (another trick of the Mac operating system which can be
circumvented with these programs) as icons: either data icons, resource
icons, or their own 2-color icons taken straight from the Mac if they're
applications.  This is where some of CrossMAC's extras come into play, but
I'll get to those in a second.  With MaxDOS 2.0, there will be no icons,
so a "Show All" is prudent.  However, with MaxDOS 2.1, arriving "any day
now", the Mac icons will be displayed.

CrossMAC's extras: Not for the squeamish.

Consultron has included some goodies in their program that MaxDOS doesn't
counter.  Their usefulness...well, it'll vary on a case-by-case basis.

The first is VHex, a simple hexadecimal-code viewer which all Mac drive
data files default to.  (i.e., double-click on a Mac data file and you'll
get VHex.)  It's fairly primitive, nothing that DirWork doesn't do, but it
is nice to have as a default tool.

The second is Res_Extractor.  Remember what I said about resource forks?
This will allow you to pull those bits of code that tell the Mac what to
do out of the resource forks and look at them.  It's neat, even if you
don't understand it.

The next is Mac_File_Salv.  Not having any corrupted Mac disks, I wasn't
able to test it, but this program purports to try to save damaged files
from damaged disks.  Nice to know.

File_Type_Manager should be used only by astoundingly confident people.
It will, essentially, allow you to tell what was previously a MS-Word
document that it's now a font.  Of course, it won't WORK, but you can do
it.  A huge database of possible filetypes comes with, and you can change
them.

All of these are certainly nice to have, and don't hinder CrossMAC by any
means.  But they're also not necessary, and can be done with more
confidence on a true Mac.

So, what's the point, Jason?

The point is that both of these programs work.  CrossMAC is the more
polished of the two, but it's also got a $20 higher pricetag.
Functionally, they're indistinguishable.  My feelings at the end are
mixed.  The products are quality, and I recommend that if you need one,
you check prices and what functions you want and make your decision.  But
at suggested prices of $150 for CrossMAC and $130 for MaxDOS, you may also
want to give some thought to just going whole-hog and buying an Emplant.
It's considerably more expensive: about $330 will get you the deluxe
version, and then you need to dig up ROMs and System software, but you
also get the Mac programs themselves, not just file portability.

The choice, as always, is up to you.  These programs would make terrific
Amiga pack-ins, and I hope both Consultron and Media4 pursue that
possibility when this damned buyout is over with.

===========================================================================

Running on a 2 meg 1.3 500......

Haven't been able to run it on AGA but I don't expect any real differences.

The plot, young Ruff Rogers has lost his marbles down a rabbit hole, he
gets sucked down the rabbit hole by the head bad guy Dr Tinpot.  Tinpot
gives Ruff a gun and challenges him to get his marbles back, he of course
will do evrything to stop him mwoooo hahahahahahah *maniacal laughter*

Thus begins the game....  Well its a platformer, yayyyyy whooooooo another
platformer.....  ;^).  Well hang on a mo, this platformer has guns..... 
8^)))))) not just machine guns, but rocket launchers, lasers and joy of
joys FLAMETHROWERS HEHEHEHEH.

The game follows formula, x levesl per themed world with a big nasty at the
end....  Hmmm doesnt look to good now does it...  But wait, does it play
well, YES it does, the graphics are simply gorgeous (even on a 500 8^) ),
the sound is well, sparse if you turn the music off , and I did cos Im not
that found of dance/rave music sparse but effective, control is well..... 
peachy with Ruff throwing his well animated little body around with fluid
ease.  The levels are solidly designed, good layouts with almost no blind
leaps into the unknown (well there are a few but they are just to get at
extra goodies) platforms look solid and inertia and gravity for all the
sprites seems bang on, well bar the piranas on world do which seem to swim
like greay (drat...) greased lightning....  annoying.

  The enemies are varied enough from world to world indeed from level to
level, they have different attack patterns, some patrol platform and when
they 'see' you run/grab/shoot at you (ho hum sounds samey), but and this is
a big but, they are so well layed out that if you think you can beat them
easily, this game is not rambo or sonic (tm) go charging in and you'll get
youre ass soundly whupped, 3 hit points and 2 lives coupled with a maniac
charge does not make for a long game.....

Pick ups vary, from power ups for your current gun, to red hearts to
restore a hit point (should you actually lose one), to gold hearts to boost
all youre health back up and give you an extra one to play with (to a limit
of 5).  Bonus points are scattered around in themed graphics, fruit in the
forest world gems in the mines etc etc, then of course there are the
different coloured marble Red Green and Blue, each level has a set amount
to collect (of each colour) when that limit is reached singulary the
remaining marble turn to coins (more on that in a mo) when all 3 are
completed the exit opens and you may leave to the next level/world.  Coins
are dotted around the landscape, and are dropped by dead baddies, 100 gives
Ruff an extra life, mega coins with a colour in the centre clear your
marble count, so picking one up is a good way of either getting off the
level quick/getting loads of coins.

Extra lives can be picked up, switches tripped, bombs set of, forcefields
turned off and on with keys.  It boils down to one excellent game with only
a fewminor niggles.  In world 2 I keep hitting a bug when I jump out of
water and a fish hits me Ruffs sprite hang so I can fire but I cant move or
turn...  ngghhhhh It always happens when IM DOING REALLY WELL TOO !!!
mutter mutter also some parts of the levels are near impossible to get
through without losing a lot of hit points, very annoying.

Well, all I can do now is reccomend the game, I dont particulary like
platformers but this one has caught my attention, even if I cant get off
level 2 due to a silly bug (or is it just me).  Well designed, well
executed, hard to fault, play it I think you'll like it......

PRODUCT NAME

   HighSpeed Pascal ("HSPascal")

   The bulk of this review is about version 1.10; however I have included
some additional information about the new version 1.20 that was released in
late September/early October 1994.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION

   An Amiga Pascal compiler that is very nearly 100% compatible with Turbo
Pascal 5.0.

   Postage is currently 2.00 UKP within the UK, 4.00 UKP in Europe and 7.00
UKP anywhere else.

SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

   HARDWARE

      512K RAM required.  I recommend 2MB RAM or more.

      I recommend a second floppy drive or a hard drive.  Hard drive
      installation requires 1.5MB of hard drive space.

   SOFTWARE

      Workbench 1.3 or higher required.

COPY PROTECTION

   None.

MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

   Amiga 4000/030/882 - 25MHz
   2MB Chip RAM, 4MB Fast RAM
   124MB Seagate Hard Drive
   405MB Samsung Hard Drive
   Microvitec 1438 Multisync Monitor
   AmigaDOS 3.0

INSTALLATION

   V1.10 requires manual installation, which is best carried out by
dragging the directories/files from the floppy to the required location on
the hard drive.  V1.20 includes an Installer script that makes life a lot
easier.  The installation requires about 1.5MB of hard drive space.

REVIEW

   My first impressions of this package were good.  Upon opening the box, I
encountered two very nicely put together manuals and a HiSoft disk wallet
containing the four disks: two for each version of the compiler.  (V1.20
comes on two disks, containing all the 1.3 and 2.0+ files in archives.)
There is no empty space inside the box, unlike a lot of other commercial
utilities.  When everything is put inside, the box feels quite heavy and
well filled, which somehow gves you a feeling of getting value for your
money.  :-)

   Anyway, after a painless installation, I got my first view of the HiSoft
editor.  For Devpac3 users, the HighSpeed Pascal editor will be instantly
familiar, as it is virtually identical, with only a few changes in the
settings menus (after all it is a Pascal compiler, not a 68000 assembler
:-)).  The editor supplied with V1.20 is slightly different.  Although is
appears the same on the surface, most of the menus have been re-arranged,
with some old options being either renamed or removed and replaced with new
options.  After a year of using V1.10, I am a little lost in the new editor
layout, but it does have advantages over the old editor's and is totally
AmigaDOS 3.0 compliant.

   For those who have never experienced a HiSoft editor before, here is a
quick rundown on what to expect.  The editor runs on the Workbench screen;
so if you can, you should probably run Workbench in some high resolution
mode, unless you like editing source code in medium resolution.  The fonts
used for the source code display and menus are user-definable, which is a
good thing.  There are several menus with quite a few options/sub-menus to
deal with, and some of the menu choices lead to new windows containing
cycle gadgets and string requesters for even more configuration options.
As far as I know, even the 1.3 version of the compiler features 2.0+ style
screen gadgets via hard coded gadget routines.

   V1.20 note: You no longer need to use the Workbench screen.  It can use
the Workbench screen, open its own screen in any screen mode your Amiga can
generate, or even run on a public screen.  To test this last feature, some
of this review, like this paragraph, was written with HighSpeed Pascal
running on the public screen opened by Powerpacker 3.  Being able to open
its own screen is also useful if, like me for instance, you like having a
colourful Workbench but also want fast scrolling through your source code.
No problem: just make HSPascal open its own 2 or 4 colour screen and you
have the best of both worlds.  I assume that it will even work on third
party display boards that add their screen modes into the system mode list,
though I can't test this for myself (would someone like to donate a 24-bit
graphics card?).

   The editor is so good at its job that I use it all the time as a general
text editor.  OK, it's not as good as a dedicated text editor, but since
these tend to cost just as much as the entire HSPascal package, I'll stick
to using the HiSoft editor.  Of course, if you prefer using another text
editor to edit your source code, you can do so.  You can then either load
the source into the HiSoft editor and use the in-built compiler options to
compile the code, or you can just use the CLI interface to the compiler,
which is VERY similar to the DOS interface for PC Turbo Pascal.

   So, once you've got your source code on disk and ready to compile, how
well does HighSpeed Pascal cope with that?  "Very well" is the answer. 
HSPascal implements virtually all of the Turbo Pascal 5.0 functions, with
only the scalable typeface support and some PC specific things missing,
like the memory overlay management commands.  Oh yes, the inline assembler
uses 68000 code rather than 8086 code.  :-)

   There are a few little compatibility problems that are related to the
differences between the Amiga and the PC, mainly in the DOS unit.  However,
they are documented in the Technical Reference manual.  Some other problems
are not.  For example, the standard PC DOS shell is a 25 line display.  On
an Amiga, the Shell display is any height you like.  Thus a Pascal program
written on the PC expecting a 25 line display may well cause a garbled
display on the Amiga.  Of course there are ways around this, like using the
inbuilt function to test the size of the Shell display before writing to
it.  Note that most problems will occur when using Pascal code written for
use on a PC, or if following Pascal tutorials from Turbo Pascal textbooks,
all of which assume that Turbo Pascal is a PC only product (which,
technically, it is).  If you are not concerned with the portability of your
code, you can happily ignore any differences between PC and Amiga and just
get on with writing code.

   So, what about those programmers who would like to include, say,
Intuition routines in their programs?  Well, HighSpeed Pascal does not
directly support Intuition nor any Amiga system functions other than those
needed to emulate Turbo Pascal functions.  Thus, whilst disk handling is
fairly well done, graphics handling is primitive and audio support
apparently non-existent.  However, a full set of Includes are provided (for
AmigaDOS 1.3 and 2.0 with HighSpeed V1.10, or for AmigaDOS 1.3 and 3.0 with
HighSpeed V1.20) so anyone with knowledge of system programming could use
HighSpeed Pascal to create system accessing programs.  For anyone who wants
to write programs like this but who does not know anything about
programming the system directly, you really should steer clear of HighSpeed
Pascal.

   What market is HighSpeed Pascal aimed at?  It would seem that primarily
it is intended for those programmers who need to write standard Turbo
Pascal compatible code without going near a PC, and as a secondary
function, by providing hooks into the operating system, it can be used by
Amiga programmers who might otherwise choose to use C, Assembler, or any
other language.  Personally, I bought it when my Electronics Degree project
became too much for PCQ Pascal to handle.  For my needs, writing a 7000+
line piece of Turbo Pascal code, HighSpeed Pascal was the ideal compiler,
allowing me to write code that I knew, with a little bit of care when
writing the DOS related routines, would function identically on both my
Amiga and the University PCs, and I didn't need to so much as look at a PC
to write the code.  In seven months of program development, I only used a
PC during the last month as part of the final testing/debugging phase of
the project.

   Supplied as part of the package is MonAm, the HiSoft debugger. 
Unfortunately, it is designed to be a 68000 debugger and as a result you
will require some knowledge of 68000 assembler in order to get the most out
of this utility.  To aid debugging, programs can be compiled with debugging
data embedded in the executable, which allows the debugger to display
functions and procedures by name rather than by some arbitrary identifier.
Additionally, you can display the 68000 code alongside the Pascal source
and single step through the code.  It must be stressed that MonAm is NOT a
Pascal debugger, and as the manual states, "One thing to consider before
groping around inside your program with MonAm is that many bugs can be
discovered much more easily by simply looking at the source code."

COMPILATION SPEEDS

   The following times show how long HighSpeed Pascal takes to compile
various length pieces of code, when the source code is stored on hard drive
and the executable file is written to the same hard drive.  Note that V1.10
and V1.20 are almost identical in compilation speed, with V1.20 being
slightly slower (around a second or two) for long files.  Of course, since
V1.20 uses the AmigaDOS 3.0 includes and link library, which are larger
than the 2.0 equivalents, the extra data handling required for these
support files may be the cause of the speed differences.

        Program Length (KB/Lines)       Compilation Time

        Minimal program                 less than 0.5 second
        20KB/500 lines or less          less than 3 seconds
        160KB/7000 lines                9 seconds

   The "Minimal program" is the shortest possible (I think) Turbo Pascal
program:

        PROGRAM x;
        BEGIN
        END.

This test shows the time overheads incurred by the compiler and linker.

   In the third case, the program consisted of a skeleton main program with
most of the code contained in 13 user defined units, along with one
pre-defined unit.  In total then, 15 disk files were used to compile this
program; yet even with all the disk accessing required, compilation was
still very fast indeed.

   The limited (!) number of results is due to two things.  First, I don't
have all that many Pascal programs available to test, and second, most of
the programs I do have are so short that they compile in about 1 second. 
Unless you are writing a huge program or are compiling from floppy to
floppy on a 0.5MB 7MHz 68000 Amiga, HighSpeed Pascal lives up to its name.

DOCUMENTATION

   The 202-page User Manual (spiral bound) contains information about the
use of the software.  The 278-page Technical Reference (spiral bound)
containing information about the inbuilt functions/procedures, and some
information about general Turbo Pascal syntax.  An on-disk README file
contains the latest information about the specific software versions/disk
contents, etc.

   The quality of the printed manuals is very good indeed, and unlike most
companies producing Amiga compilers, HiSoft realise the best form of
binding for a software manual is the spiral bound method.  No more
straining with one hand to keep the manual open at the page you want,
whilst trying to type with your other hand.  The contents and index
sections are on the whole very well done, allowing you to find what you
want very easily.

   The Technical Reference is NOT a Pascal programming guide.  You will
need to know at least how to program in Standard Pascal before using this
compiler.  What the reference DOES tell you is the syntax of every function
and procedure provided either within HighSpeed Pascal itself, or in the
supplied units (DOS, Graph etc.).  It also describes the basic syntax of
the Pascal constructs like REPEAT..UNTIL, CASE, IF..THEN..ELSE etc.  and
also the format of the various pre-defined variable types.  In short, it
describes all you need to know to write code using the HighSpeed Pascal
extensions to the basic Pascal language.  Of course, if you already have
experience with TurboPascal 5.0 on the PC, you should be able to dive in
and write code without much use of the Reference.

LIKES

   It is a very well programmed utility that is, as far as I can see,
completely Style Guide compliant.  It works without complaint regardless of
what commodities I have installed, and as far as the editing and compiling
of source is concerned, it has shown itself to be VERY VERY stable.  Of
course, once you run a compiled program either from the Shell, the
Workbench or from the Run option, HSPascal can do little if the program
causes a system failure, but that is not a fault of HSPascal.

DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

   It is a pity that HiSoft did not extend the TurboPascal function set to
add Amiga specific functions, such as the automatic creation of Intuition
windows, menus etc., in the same way that BlitzBasic allows you to create
Intuition interfaces with little effort.  A missed chance by HiSoft I
think.

   There is no on-line help available.  Although the printed manuals are
excellent, there are times when on-line aid is more useful.  (CD-ROM owners
see below).

CD-ROM OWNERS READ THIS

   The following is copied from a letter I received from HiSoft.

   "The HiSoft Language CD-ROM will contain the latest versions of all
three language packages; each system is supplied ready to run from the CD,
with installation programs to install the individual programs onto your
hard disk.  Full on-line documentation for each package using AmigaGuide is
also included." Note: 'all three language packages' refers to Devpac,
Pascal and BASIC.

   No price or release dates are known at this time, but it is good to see
HiSoft promoting the serious use of CD-ROMs on the Amiga.

COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

   As far as Amiga Pascal products go, the only other compiler I have used
is PCQ Pascal, which was public domain and is now, I believe, shareware. 
Since PCQ supported only the Standard Pascal command set, and since it
relied on using other PD products like A68K and Blink to create the final
executable program, it cannot be fairly compared to a commercial
TurboPascal compiler like HSPascal.

   Compared to TurboPascal 6.0 on the PC, HSPascal wins on looks, since
Turbo 6 does not have a Windows interface.  As far as compilation of code
goes, both compilers seem to work as well as each other, although I think
HSPascal is somewhat faster in compiling (subjective opinion only).  As an
Amiga user, I prefer using HSPascal, and only use TurboPascal if I have to
be sure that my code will work on a PC, and even then I would only use it
to test the code *after* I had written it using HSPascal.

BUGS

        None that I know of.

VENDOR SUPPORT

        I have not had to contact the vendor at all.

WARRANTY

   A 30 day period from the date of purchase is provided free.  If you
require further support from HiSoft, you must pay for it.  Two schemes
exist: the Silver Support and Gold Support schemes.  Silver Support costs
19.95 UK Pounds and is a one-off payment.  This gives you access to
technical help from HiSoft, and also provides access to reduced cost
upgrades (see the List Price section).  Gold Support costs 39.95 UK Pounds
PER YEAR, but offers free incremental upgrades (i.e.  from V1.1 to V1.2
would be free, but from V1.x to V2.x would not be).  Both schemes cover all
HiSoft products you may own without having to pay any extra.  Thus someone
with HSPascal, Devpac and Hisoft Basic could get support for all three by
paying just once.  If you have already registered another HiSoft product,
HSPascal will be covered by that support registration, you only need return
the registration card to activate the support.

CONCLUSIONS

   If you require a fast and reliable Turbo Pascal 5 compatible compiler
for your Amiga, this is the only choice.  If you are just starting out with
Pascal programming, you may prefer the simpler and cheaper PCQ Pascal
option, and perhaps purchase HSPascal at a later date.

   Overall this is an excellent utility and is a worthy companion to the
other great HiSoft products available.  (I'm not connected to HiSoft by the
way; I just happen to like their products.)

I was once a student of physics, so I think I was decently enough prepared
to review this product.

What I wasn't prepared for was the use of (shudder) bru by the installer
program for this 4-disk program.  Yes, bru.  For those of you unfamiliar
with it, it's the program behind HDBackup, the sabotage Commodore placed
in Workbench 2.x and above to make you think you could back up your hard
drive and retrieve it.  So, I had to dig out my old WB disks in order to
get the program installed...

But enough complaining.  Once it actually WAS installed, it was time to
get to business.  PLIM resides in its own directory and is actually two
programs, to represent parts one and two of the program (merely a division
of the subject matter.)  They cover kinematics, dynamics, statics,
universal gravitation, work and energy, impulse and momentum, and
rotation.

The program itself is written in CanDo, and in rather unpleasing 640x200
and fairly low color.  But the interface has been set up intelligently and
is well laid-out, describing the particular experiment being taught,
clueing the student to select an equation, and then proceeding with the
simulation.  The buttons are certainly easy to distinguish and intuitive
to decipher.

The subject matter itself is presented well, although (as with all
educational software) is certainly only a suppliment to a full-blown
class.  3 experiments (easy/medium/hard) are given in each subject area,
with a logical progression between them.

One of the better parts of the program is the history and picture section,
with a summary of the basis of the experiment and either its creator or
the scientist who developed an important concept behind it.  The pictures
are primitive, but are at least a diversion.  Sounds and music are
included, and are also very basic.

The concepts are presented well, even if the experiments sometimes run
slowly-I found myself waiting a rather long time to draw 5 dotted circles
in a orbit experiment.  My only real complaint with the material presented
is that there should be more of it: expanding the scope beyond mechanics,
at least in future products, would be appreciated.  It seems only natural
to present electricity and magnetism on a computer, does it not?

In short, Lori Vinciguerra seems to know a great deal about physics and is
very interested in presenting it in an educational way.  In this, she has
definitely succeeded.  However, there are quite a few rough edges on the
program that prevent it from being a real grabber.  Allowing instructors
to develop their own experiments certainly wouldn't hurt, either.

Hats off to OWL Software.  It takes bravery to try educating people with
Amigas.  It takes talent to actually pull it off, too.

@node P2-2-1 "NetBSD 1.0"
@toc P2-2

I am pleased to announce the availability of release 1.0 of the NetBSD
operating system, a freely available and redistributable BSD system that
runs on a variety of hardware platforms.  NetBSD 1.0 is based on 4.4BSD
Lite and Berkeley Networking Release 2 sources.  It includes support for
shared libraries on most architectures, the enhanced Berkeley Fast File
System (which supports 64-bit file sizes and clustering), rock-solid
networking code, and a fair amount of binary compatibility with other
operating systems.  A list of significant changes since the last release is
present in the "CHANGES" file in the distribution.  The list is far too
long to include here.

Release 1.0 of the NetBSD operating system is distributed with complete
source code and is available from the distribution sites listed at the
bottom of this message.  At this time, binary releases for the following
architectures are available:
        Amigas
        i386-family PCs
        some m68k-based Macintoshes
        PC532
        SPARCstation (sun4c) -class machines

In addition, a binary release is expected, but not yet ready, for the
HP9000/300 family of workstations.  Though the NetBSD 1.0 source tree
includes support for DECstations, some Sun 3 models, and some VAXen, those
ports are not far enough along to merit a complete binary distribution.

Within the next few days, installation and release notes for each of the
ports mentioned above will be posted to the appropriate mailing lists
and/or newsgroups for those ports.  If those notes don't answer any
questions you might have about NetBSD, you should probably subscribe to one
of more of the NetBSD mailing lists, and ask there.  For information on
what lists are available and how to subscribe, mail majordomo@NetBSD.ORG
with an empty message body.

Enjoy!

TITLE
        XPR Kermit

VERSION
        2.37

AUTHOR
        Stephen Walton, Frank da Cruz, Marco Papa
        swalton@galileo.csun.edu

DESCRIPTION

        XPR Kermit is an implementation of the Kermit file transfer
protocol written as an Amiga external protocol (XPR).  This means that any
terminal program which follows the XPR specification can use XPR Kermit to
transfer files using the Kermit protocol.  The Kermit file transfer
protocol is very robust, and is the only major protocol which can transfer
binary files over lines which do not transparently pass all 256 8-bit
characters.  It is also very widely available on everything from ancient
minicomputers with 16K of RAM to the latest supercomputers.
        For more information on Kermit, Amiga users should refer to the
book "Using C Kermit" by Frank da Cruz and Christine Gianone.

NEW FEATURES
        Version 2.37 of XPR Kermit fixes an embarrassing bug which meant
XPR Kermit never freed the memory it allocates for file transfers.  The fix
was simple; thanks to John Ata for reporting the problem.  ALL USERS of XPR
Kermit should get this latest release.

DESCRIPTION
   MUI-Builder is an application builder for MUI programs.  It will allow
   beginners and other programmers to build their Graphic User Interface
   very easily.

   It generates C, E or Oberon code for MUI. (soon to come : Modula2)

   With the many options of MUI-Builder, you will be able to generate
   precisely the part of the source code you really want, and not only the
   whole interface.  This will permit to maintain easily your code without
   losing your previously modified program, each time you change your
   interface.

   Moreover you will be able to design the inline hypertext guide from
   MUI-Builder by attaching a help text to each GUI-Object of your
   interface.  The builder will be able to create the AmigaGuide
   documentation automatically.

NEW FEATURES
   - Notifications support (creation and test of the notifications)
   - New tree display
   - New external generators (a library provides some functions to help the
     programmers !)
   - More objects supported (Menus, PopObjects ...)
   - improved objects
   - More style guide compliant

DESCRIPTION
  GTDriver is a program to control serial graphic tablets and serial mice
  with your Amiga.  Version 1.0 of GTDriver supports the following tablets:

- Summagraphics MM
- Summagraphics Bitpadone
- CalComp 2000
- Cherry
- TekTronix 4957
- Wacom

and the following mice:

- Microsoft mouse
- Mouse System mouse

If your tablet or mouse emulates one of the previous models you can use it
with GTDriver (if not, contact the authors to have your device supported in
the next release of the package).

GTDriver has many parameters that can be configured using the prefs program
GTDOptions.  Among the parameters you find the emulation type, the baud
rate, the dpi tablet resolution, the dimensions of the clip region, etc.

GTDriver has two working modes: 'driver mode' and 'server mode'.  In
'driver mode' the pointing device of the tablet becomes a mouse
replacement, and you can use the tablet with any program.  If you have a
digitizing puck, it may have more than two buttons.  However, only three
buttons are supported in 'driver mode'.  The third button is mapped to the
third Amiga mouse button (that is supported by few programs).

'Server mode' is intended for programmers only.  You can write your own
programs that use GTDriver in server mode: in this way GTDriver will not
control the screen pointer, and will send complete tablet information to
your program in a documented format.  By using GTDriver in 'server mode'
your software can take full advantage of any tablet feature.

GTDriver supports user-defined tablet buttons (called pseudo-buttons or
p-buttons).  A p-button is a rectangular area on the tablet, to which an
arbitrary key combination has been associated.  Whenever you press the
stylus on a pseudo button, its key combination is sent to the active
program just like you were pressing it on the keyboard.  As many programs
use keyboard shortcuts to select tools and menu items, you can define sets
of p-buttons even for programs not explicitly written to work with
GTDriver.  For example, you can use Deluxe Paint or DynaCadd with a graphic
tablet without having tool bars on the screen, without selecting menu items
and, most of all, without the software being aware of GTDriver!


FEATURES
  - Message port with support for many commands;
  - Two working modes: 'driver mode' (mouse replacement mode) and 'server
    mode' (direct control for programmers);
  - Support for user defined pseudo-buttons on the tablet; a pseudo button
    is associated to a keyboard sequence so that button masks can be
    created to control software that isn't aware of GTDriver (Deluxe Paint,
    etc.);
  - Font-sensitive AUISG-compliant preferences program (GTDOptions);
  - Enforcer and Mungwall test for both GTDriver and GTDOptions;
  - Dvi, Amigaguide, ASCII and ANSI text documentation;
  - C source example to show how to program GTDriver in 'server mode';
  - Deluxe Paint 4.5 pseudo-button mask included;

HOST NAME
  GTDriver is available for anonymous FTP on Aminet sites such as
  ftp.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4).

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
   GTDriver needs at least Kickstart/Workbench 2.04 to run.  A fast CPU
   it's not required but the driver may have better performance with it.

PRICE

To become a registered user you have to send us a registration fee and your
full name and address.  More details are explained in the package
documentation.

If you like `GTDriver' and use it, please register yourself, helping us to
enhance this product.  If you don't think this program is useful enough to
pay for it, please, at least e-mail (or mail) us your suggestions, so that
we can make improvements.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

GTDriver is NOT PD.  It is shareware.  The authors keep the copyright over
the whole package.

The unregistered version of GTDriver is freely (re)distributable, but none
is allowed to sell the program for more money than to cover just the costs
of copying.

In any case noone may charge more than Fred Fish claims for one of his

TITLE
 The NewIcons Package

AUTHOR
 The programs and documentation were written by:
     Nicola Salmoria (MC6489@mclink.it)

 The icon artwork was drawn by:
     Roger McVey (r.mcvey@genie.geis.com)
           
 The documentation and installer were written by:
     Philip A. Vedovatti (vedovatt@u.washington.edu)

DESCRIPTION

 NewIcons is a revolutionary enhancement to the graphical user interface
 (GUI) of the Amiga computer.  On an AGA machine, the NewIcons package
 allows users of AGA systems to view icons on their Workbench, independent
 of the Workbench palette settings.  Icons up to 256 colors can be utilized
 on the standard workbench.  A comprehensive set of NewIcon images is
 included in the package for all the standard Workbench files as well as
 several other images.  The images were drawn by the artist well-known for
 his isometric icon sets, Roger McVey.

 Included in the NewIcons package is DefIcons, which will display the
 appropriate icon for dozens of different file types that don't have icons
 attached to them.  Deficons recognizes IFF, JPEG, and GIF files, source
 codes of various languages, packed file types, mountlists, printer and
 monitor drivers, and much more.

 Both NewIcons and Deficons work on OS2.0+ systems as well (with a 16 color
 icon limitation on non-AGA machines).

 Other features include:

        o  Icons can easily be created from IFF brushes using your
           favorite paint program.  The icons will appear on your
           workbench screen in the _exact_ proper colors, no matter
           what your palette is set to (using AGA). 

        o  If you click on a "fake" icon, the Workbench "Execute
           Command" field will have the user defined default tool
           already typed in for you.

        o  Fix that CrossDos icon to look like a standard NewIcon
           image.

        o  Unique icons for RAM disks and CD-ROMS that don't have
           icon images.

        o  Comprehensive set of NewIcon manipulation utilities to
           maximize the appearance of your Workbench.

        o  Extensively beta tested.

        o  Full AmigaGuide documentation and automated installer
           script.  Your old icons will NOT be deleted!

        o  A supplemental icon set will soon be released with over
           400 NewIcon images.

        o  NewIcons and DefIcons work independently of each other,
           so you can install which features you want to use.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
 NewIcons and Deficons will work on any Amiga system using OS 2.04 or
 above.  OS2.x users have a 16 color icon limitation; AGA users can use
 icons up to 256 colors.  A hard disk drive is recommended.

                            UUEncoding/Decoding
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
             (thanks to Bob Tomasevich for the quick tutorial)

What is uuencoding and uudecoding?
----------------------------------
uuencoding is converting a binary file into text (ASCII) which can be sent
through mail or Usenet.  uudecoding is reversing the process (e.g.
converting the file back to binary).

Why would I want to do this?
----------------------------
You have to send a binary file to a user who does not have FTP access, or
the user is too lazy to FTP the file.

What is the normal procedure?
-----------------------------
1. Convert the binary file into ASCII, using uuencode.
2. Send the file, through email, to the user.
3. The person on the receiving end gets the email, which may be split into
   parts.  If the email is split into parts, the parts must be combined,
   in the order received, into one file.
4. Receiving person converts the file back into binary, using uudecode.

What does a uuencoded file look like?
-------------------------------------
The start always has:

    begin 644 <encoded file's name>

So, for the file happy-happy-joy-joy.txt, it would look like:

    begin 644 happy-happy-joy-joy.txt

The encoded file begins right after:

M1TE&.#=A@`+@`9<````$`*QB15=2.+&/@R(Y)XM8.=J]H+*%7BL6#8]F6EP_]
M*$=E5"L?L-Z8A-:#60\@$,9P27-4-YB#;4HY)U!L9KZNE\O"O["#;8]82SDF>
M&[%J4FI',.&:E`48#="4@SE41M61<R`@%R$\,9:.?&!Z=NWM_\V';H-D1TI`=

.. more lines like the above ..

M>(`)N(`-^(`1.($5>($9N($=^($A.((E>((IN((M^((Q.(,U>(,YN(,]^(-!+
&V"\"`@`[&
``
end              <-- the end of the encoded file
size 151341      <-- size of the original file

So, how would I do this on the Amiga?
-------------------------------------
There are many uuencode/decode variants out there, but most usually have
kept the old UNIX command line, which can be confusing to novices, or,
require you to remove all mail headers and other, non-uuencoded text.

Luckily, Asher Feldman took the time to write UUxt.

What is UUxT?
-------------
It is a program which performs both the uuencode/decode operations in one
executable, AND, can also pack/unpack LhA archives.

Tell me more.
-------------
The UUxT archive contains UUxT, the CLI version, and UUxtGUI, the Workbench
interface.  I will give a short summary of how to use both.  Detailed
instructions are included in the UUxT archive.

CLI Version:
------------

  Running UUxT without any options gives the following:

     UUxT Version 2.1a Copyright (c)1993 Asher Feldman
     USAGE: UUxT [option] [archive name] <LhA archive name> <file(s)>
     options: a - encode           l - LhAencode
              x - decode           u - LhAdecode

  showing the format of the command line and the valid options.

  Some example command lines:

  1. Normal encoding - UUxt a filename.uue filename-to-archive
  2. Normal decoding - UUxt x filename.uue
  3. LhA archiving and encoding -

            UUxT l filename.uue filename.lha file1 file2 ...

  4. Decoding and LhA unarchiving - UUxT u filename.uue

  For LhA encoding and decoding, you will need LhA by Stefan Boberg.

  Workbench (GUI) Version:
  ------------------------
  Below is a ASCII rendition of the UUxT-GUI window (from UUxtGUI doc):

  (1) Clicking on this brings up a requester to select the file you want to
         perform the operation shown in gadget (5).
  (2) You can manually type here the filename of the file affected by the
         operation indicated in gadget (5).
  (3) Used only for encoding, brings up a requester to select where the
         encoded file should go.  Selecting an existing file will cause the
         existing file to be replaced by the encoded file.  You can also
         use this requester to create directories.
  (4) You can manually type the filename of the file to be the encoded file.
  (5) The operation to perform on file shown in (2).  The operations are
         the four provided by UUxT (uuencode/uudecode/LhAEncode/LhADecode).
  (6) The name of the archive created with the LhAEncode option.  Ignored
         when any other operation is selected.
  (7) Does the encode/decode/LhAEncode/LhADecode and pops up a requester
         indicating if the operation was successful or not.

I need this!  Where can I get it?
---------------------------------
If you use the Internet from a local BBS, you may find it there.  If not
you can FTP it from wuarchive.wustl.edu, in the directory

                          pub/aminet/arc/UUxT.lha

It should also be on the Aminet mirrors.

Thanks for the explanation!  How can I reach you if I have questions?

                The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
          -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-
service online SIG (Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users.

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in various ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA area banks of high-speed modems (you pay for the
phone call if it's not local), or though any SprintNet indial anywhere in
the USA, (with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell account.  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help and you can easily customize
it for your terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1000 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
      once, of any size, with one command.
 * Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, Elastic
      Reality (ASDG), Soft-Logik, Apex Publishing, and others.
 * 38 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 10,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
