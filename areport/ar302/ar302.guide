With the ringing in of Amiga Report's third year, we decided it was time
to do some housecleaning-namely, shortening those BBS and Dealer listings
that were taking up a considerable amount of space.  Don't get me wrong,
we're more than happy to list them, but it became clear that as the
listings grew, they were getting larger and larger...

As I look over what Amiga Report is today, and look back at what it was
years ago, I can't help but be happy.  We've taken a good idea and turned
it into a great magazine.  (And the price can't be beat!)  And by "we", I
mean the selfless writers and editors, as well as the countless readers
who continually show their support.

In case you missed the survey last issue, or didn't feel motivated enough
to fill it out, please take another look.  You might feel a bit
differently...

Ok, now to the inevitable buyout matter.  Last reports indicate the
following:

Both the C= UK-lead and CEI-lead bids are on the table.  Both had deposits
down, but CEI has taken back their deposit following the expiration date
of their bid.  Apparently, the bid is still being treated as valid anyway.

The Commodore Semiconductor Group (CSG, formerly MOS Technologies) has
been completely liquidated and the management-lead buyout has created a
new company.  More news will follow.

January 16th marks the last day claims may be made on Commodore US
(Commodore Business Machines, Inc.) in order to get a "piece of the pie."
(C= US was liquidated in early September, and was the owner of the
infamous floor scrubber.)

Are things starting to look bad?  Well, in a word, yes.  I still have high
hopes that a buying company can take the Amiga and turn it into something,
well, at least as good as it was before.  Whether or not they can do it in
time, of course, is an entirely different matter.  But when they take
their shot, we'll be here to watch.  And help.

In other news, be sure to check out CompuServe's press release.  They seem
to think that GIF is the greatest thing since free online magazines.

Also, for Australians out there who have been affected by the new
pay-per-meg from outside of the country, check out the Mailing List
distribution section of the magazine for information on a new Australian
listserv.

That about does it.  Enjoy.

Jason

P.S.  Be sure to check out ARArchive, the AmigaGuide frontend for all Amiga
Reports.  Thanks to Robert Resiweig for compiling it.  A full article index
will be out soon.

Also, next issue we will FINALLY have the listing for a new AR Coverdisk.

Well, we've slimmed down the magazine a bit...  In fact, we saved about 30K
by shrinking the BBS and dealer area...  The section on how to UUDecode the
magazine is also much much shorter.  Hopefully, this will help to keep the
size of the magazine from becoming quite as large as the last couple
issues.

Depending on the outcome of the Grand Gala Survey, some other sections
(Esp. Press Releases, it looks like) will have to lose a little weight.

At any rate, look for the results of the Workbench Wish Lists in the
Features section, along with a few questions about hardware for another
survey.

The Magic Workbench vs. New Icons survey results will be printed in the
next issue.

Until Later...

]n any followup article, please include the information that the Clipboard
format used is not the typical TXT format which means you can't cut & paste
external to Final Data. I sent Softwood a letter about this.

    Of course, all of this even assumes that there is a NEW workbench and
a NEW Amiga, doesn't it?  One SMALL suggestion I do have is that Amiga
Report put out a "SPECIAL/EXTRA" edition as soon as something has been
resolved on the Amiga court proceedings.  You are better prepared to 
reliably pass the news on to everybody than any other source that I know 
of.  I surely hope that something is resolved soon, while there are still 
some software and hardware companies still willing to support the Amiga, 
and while there are still a lot of us Amigans around.
    Thank you for Amiga Report.  I enjoy reading it.  It gets me the news
fast and reliably.  Keep it up.  Best wishes to you & thanks again.

[We plan to put out a small issue no more than six hours after we are
certain the buyout has been completed. -- Ed]

                * A journey into recursive multitasking *
                             from Helios
                         Revision 1 on 11-1-94

Note: This is how to manage to multitask with 400 or more tasks easily... 
So, dont expect any practical advantages from it.  It also shows a bug - or
a feature - of unix piping in AmigaDOS...

Requirements are: A working pipe command in command path!  Maybe you also
need OS2.0 or above....

Ok, lets begin...  here we go...

Save all you necessary data, as the amiga may want to reboot suddenly
during our experiment.  :-;

Open a shell!  And then type:  cd ram:

Note this ^^^ one is absolutely recommended!!!!  Otherwise you may get some
trash on your harddisk :-)!!!  But note, there is no risk of data loss on
the harddisc anyway...

And now you may want to load some sort of CPU monitor!  I use DashBoard for
that purpose!!!

Type:  get _pchar

If you get | as answer move forward otherwise type: set _pchar |

Then all what you have to do is type:  pipe |

and look whats going on then!!!  I think this one is quite funny...  You
will see recursive multitasking...

When memory is eaten up, cancel all those requesters that may come up and
after all that, when your amiga is still alive type:  dir

And look what you get...

My question to all: WHY THIS DOES HAPPEN?????  Does this happen with every
pipe command or only with the one I use???  (If you could not reproduce
this, I will tell ya want pipe command I use...)

[If anyone knows, please send the answer to Martin Steigerwald at

AmiNIX press release - Todd Vierling (amigagod@grove.ufl.edu)

As of Sunday, January 1, AmiNIX is now available to the public.  This is a
project that has been 3 months in the making, and here's a few sections of
the AmiNIX FAQ to answer some questions about it.  Please do remember that
the current version is only a gamma release and is by no means finished;
however, I plan to keep working on AmiNIX for as long as I own an Amiga
(which should be a very long time).  For people without access to the
Internet at this time, I apologize for not having a Fido or BBS site for
the system.  I do hope to have one by the 1.0 full release version.

1.1. Overview

     AmiNIX (abbreviated AX) is a new implementation of BSD UNIX for the
Amiga computer.  It runs on any 680x0 series processor, and does not
require either an MMU or FPU.  It does not have the superstrict protection
that NetBSD or Linux have, and is not designed for that; AmiNIX is designed
for UNIX compatibility on few-to-one-user systems and for restricted remote
use (via rksh and the like).  Though I hate to use Macintosh terms, AmiNIX
is an ``extension'' that gives UNIX ability to AmigaOS.

2.1. Processor requirements?

     AmiNIX will run on any 680x0 series processor on an Amiga computer.

     At the current time (release 0.9.1), only the 68020+ kernel and 68020+
C library with 68881/882 floating point is available.  By release 1.0, all
the options will be available.

2.3. Operating system requirements?

     AmiNIX will run under any AmigaOS revision from 2.04 (V37) on.  More
abilities will be available to later-version systems (locale for V38+,
non-muFS multiuser for V39+, etc.), but 2.04 will be sufficient for most
users.

3.1. WHAT ABOUT X?

     I'm answering this, so please, don't ask me.  (This is the #1
question I get.) Once AmiNIX reaches release 1.0 and I have finished
networking, I will begin work on porting X-Windows.  X will use the EGS
windowing system as its interface, so if you have a graphics card that
supports EGS, X is already supported.  EGS is optimal for supporting
X-Windows because its GUI is almost identical to that of X, and so the
actual X library can be much smaller and more optimized than its regular
UNIX implementation.  I plan to have X finished in mid-1995.

4. Where is it!?!?

4.1. WWW site

    The official AmiNIX WWW site is available at the URL:
    http://bay.circa.ufl.edu:8000/aminix.html
 This site is the official primary distribution site, and has the latest
copy of AmiNIX available.  If you are a beta tester (or wish to be one),
you need to use this site to access the beta archives.  If you wish to
become a beta tester you will need a Site ID; choose the "Apply for a Site
ID" option and fill in the appropriate information (you will need forms
support for this).

4.2. Mailing list

     The mailing list for AmiNIX (announcing releases and major changes
only; not a public mailing list) can be accessed by sending an e-mail
message to: amigagod@grove.ufl.edu with subject line (or first text line)
"aminix add your@mail.address".  You will receive a confirmation
indicating that you have joined the mailing list.

[This is the infamous "GIF Patent" press release.  There's a lot to digest
in there, but the upshot is this-I hope you like JPEG. -Ed.]


AGREEMENT FOR USE OF GRAPHICS INTERCHANGE FORMAT(SM)


This Agreement is entered into as of the effective date set forth below
between CompuServe Incorporated, an Ohio corporation ("CompuServe"), and
the other undersigned party to this Agreement ("Developer").

Section 1.  Grant of Rights.  

1.1.  Effective upon Developer's payment of the initial license fee
described in Section 2, CompuServe hereby grants to Developer a
non-exclusive, worldwide: (a) license to use and exploit GIF(SM) to make,
have made, use and sell Products solely within the Field of Use; and (b)
sublicense to use and exploit the Licensed Patent to make, have made, use
and sell Products solely within the Field of Use.

1.2.  CompuServe will provide Developer with a single copy of the most
recent specification for GIF(SM) and any updates to such specification
that are released by CompuServe during the term of this Agreement.  Once
an updated version of the GIF(SM) specification has been released by
CompuServe, Developer should incorporate the updates contained in the new
specification into its Products as part of Developer's ordinary release
cycle.

1.3.  Developer understands that CompuServe and Unysis Corporation are the
owners of all patents, copyrights, service marks and other intellectual
property embodied in the Licensed Technology.  In connection with its use
of the Licensed Technology, Developer shall take all steps reasonably
required by CompuServe and/or Unysis Corporation to acknowledge and
protect their respective ownership interests in the patents, copyrights,
service marks and other intellectual property interests embodied in the
Licensed Technology.   Developer further agrees not to take any action
that would impair the respective interests of CompuServe and/or Unysis
Corporation in the Licensed Technology.

1.4.  Developer may not use, copy, modify or distribute the GIF(SM)
specification, except as expressly permitted by CompuServe.  Developer may
make three copies of the GIF(SM) specification for back-up purposes only,
provided CompuServe's service mark, copyright and other notices and
legends are included in such copy.  Developer shall not alter or delete
any of the notices or legends contained in the GIFSM specification and any
updates thereto.  Developer agrees to provide the following notice on
Products or in any Product documentation: "LZW compression and
decompression methods are licensed under Unysis Corporation's U.S.  Patent
4,558,302 and equivalent foreign patents.  Additional technology embodied
in GIF(SM) is licensed from CompuServe Incorporated.  Graphics Interchange
Format and GIF are service marks of CompuServe Incorporated."

1.5.  Developer shall not grant any customer the right to use a Product
until such customer has been registered by Developer as a user of the
Product and customer's rights to use such Product are governed by an
agreement with Developer providing that (a) the customer's use of such
Product will be primarily for accessing the CompuServe Information Service
and for manipulating and viewing data received through the CompuServe
Information Service, and (b) the customer will not alter, enhance or
redistribute any Product.

1.6.  This Agreement does not provide Developer with title to or ownership
of the Licensed Technology or any service mark of CompuServe, but only the
license granted herein.  Developer may only grant its customers a limited
right to use Products.

Section 2.  License Fees.

2.1.  In payment for the licenses granted herein, Developer shall pay
CompuServe a one-time initial license fee of $ 1.00 which is due in full
upon the execution of this Agreement and a fee per Disposition equal to
the greater of (a) 1.5 percent of the selling price per Disposition or (b)
$.15 per Disposition.  Unless otherwise provided herein, all license fees
and other amounts payable hereunder by Developer shall be paid to
CompuServe in U.S.  Dollars within ten (10) days after the end of each
quarter.  Quarterly periods may be defined at CompuServe's discretion.

2.2.  Developer is solely responsible for payment of any taxes resulting
from Developer's use of the Licensed Technology, except for taxes based on
the income of CompuServe or Unysis Corporation.  Developer agrees to hold

@toc FEATURE

===========================================================================
==  Results: The Workbench Wish List Survey       By:  @{"Katherine Nelson" link KATIE}  ==
===========================================================================

Well, here it is.  What everyone...well... a lot of people have been
waiting for! (:))

               The Results of the Workbench Wish List Survey
               ---------------------------------------------

Please note: Although I am only going to list suggestions that received
more than one vote (or this article would be just way too huge, and it's
big as it is...), ALL suggestions from all 92 people answering the survey
will be sent to the new Amiga company as soon as it exists.

The largest number of votes that any one suggestion got was 57.  The
scaling used to show reader preference will therefore be based on a percent
of 57.  The most popular suggestion will have a vote of 100%, and so on.

In case of a tied number of votes, the suggestions are in random order, so
don't think I didn't like your vote. :)

  %                               Suggestion
-----  --------------------------------------------------------------------

100.0  Better appearance through *included* icons and backdrops.  (These
       include different pictures, more elaborate patterns, etc.)

 79.0  8+ color Workbench standard (preferably 16+) with icons using this
       many colors

 75.4  Allow users to add (easily) Menus, Submenus, Items to Menus, and
       Hotkeys

 49.1  User-definable Docks and AppIcons (such as ToolManager, NeXT, etc.)

 49.1  Make all of Workbench as configuable as MUI applications are, with
       user-defined gadget look/size, font prefs for different
       applications, etc.

 47.4  Icon and Backdrop (esp. Icon) colors should not be dependent on the
       position of the color in the WB palette.  They should color-guess if
       the actual color isn't available (like NewIcons system)

 43.9  Menus should be (or have an option to be) popup and sticky (like
       MagicMenu)

 42.1  Retargetable Graphics

 31.6  More unix like AmigaDOS shell, but with scroll bar, file name
       completion, *-type wildcards, mouse-controlled copy and paste (like
       KingCON)

 31.6  Real memory protection and error checking that could be disabled if
       necessary

 26.3  Drop down or Popup menus instead of cycle gadgets (like CycleToMenu)

 22.8  Easy to use Virtual Memory - You just tell it how much you want, and
       it handles the rest (like Macintosh)

 22.8  Include datatypes for iff, dr2d, smus, faxx, wav, voc, snd, tga,
       tiff, raw, fli/flc, epsf, mpeg, pict, jpeg, gif, html, anim, pcx,
       avi, cdxl, au, avi, bmp, postscript fonts, 3d objects (from
       Imagine, etc.)

 22.8  Full-featured ARexx port for Workbench, especially including the
       ability to open drawers automatically

 22.8  Fully multitasking, multithreaded Workbench  [I'm surprised more
       people didn't vote for this]

 19.3  Include a print spooler w/drag and drop and ability to rearrange
       order of printing or cancel

 17.5  Better Icon Editor (like Iconian) with ability to cut, copy, and
       paste brushes, and ability to scale down pictures into icons

 15.8  Add more pens to intuition (i.e. Inactive Window Title Bars,
       Inactive Window Titles, Action Gadget Backround) and ability to
       assign any color in the palette to them

 15.8  Have a menu or a list brought up by hotkey of all running screens
       and hidden windows, and be able to jump to one by selecting it or to
       quit it

 15.8  Interlaced (possibly animated) pointer for non-AGA machines and AGA
       machines, hires pointer, and an animated and easy to edit
       busypointer

 15.8  Rescale sliders, window borders, and gadgets according to aspect
       ratio of the screen resolution, so the vertical bars are not 2X as
       big as the horizontal ones on interlaced machines

 15.8  More printer drivers should be included, that run the printers at
       full dpi, and have better color printer support

 14.8  The Workbench should look like NeXT machines

 14.0  Have more default icons, incl.  for different datatypes, and an easy
       way to change them

 14.0  Animated requesters/user messages with the ability for programmers
       to add their own animations for within their programs, and for user
       to change the animations in the Workbench ones

 14.0  Better font sensitivity in Workbench and included utilities

 14.0  More of a 3d and beveled look for windows (like Sysihack at the
       least) and shadows behind windows

 14.0  An "undelete" command, disk/hard drive repair/optimize/defragment
       program (DiskSalv or DiskDoctor as a start)

 14.0  Be able to bring windows to the front by just clicking on them once,
       or as an option only, Sun Mouse abilities

 12.3  The 8 colors of an 8 color Workbench should not be changed to the
       upper four and lower four when the # of colors are increased.  This
       makes the icons look weird.

 12.3  Drag and drop capability from Workbench to application, between
       applications, and from an application to the Workbench

 12.3  Create a trashcan that sits on the Workbench and really deletes when
       an option is selected from the menu (as a failsafe) (like on the
       Mac)

 12.3  No more Topaz-8! [!!!]

 12.3  Greater HotKey support, and ability to navigate all of Workbench and
       most programs with keyboard only (like in Windows)

 12.3  Use PFS file system, and have ability to boot from PFS disks (1.8%
       specifically do not want PFS)

 12.3  Use the "Help" key in Workbench to demonstrate/explain basic
       operations and to have an AmigaGuide tour of the system.  (There
       would be different Help modules that could be deleted if unnecessary
       to save space)

 12.3  Built-in support for a middle mouse button, giving it a user-defined
       action (shift-select, cycle screens/windows, rename a file)

 12.3  Voice recognition software if audio digitizing equipment is present

 12.3  Be able to change all colors of the Workbench in the palette
       preferences, not just 8

 12.3  Standard multifilesystem where a PC disk could still be accessed by
       calling DF0:, Mac disks the same way (Like multifilesystem)..  Only
       one icon per disk

 10.5  Bring back the speach tool, but new and improved, perhaps with other
       languages supported

 10.5  Font support of Postscript and TrueType fonts.  Also, datatypes so
       they could be viewed in their entirety in MultiView

 10.5  Ability to play sound effects or execute a program at specified
       system and/or time events, perhaps with ability to pick randomly
       from a short list

 10.5  Be able to iconify all screens and windows (perhaps have another
       gadget on the window border/screen title bar)

 10.5  No isometric icons

 10.5  Whether by software or by hardware, the disk drive SHOULD NOT CLICK.
       [I'm surprised more people didn't suggest this, too...]

  8.8  Be able to resize windows from any side, not just the right-bottom
       corner

  8.8  Built-in system support for CD, Syquest, and Tape Backup drives

  8.8  Full Postscript

  8.8  Include a clock w/out window borders (like TinyClock) that could
       also be configured to only have a digital readout on the title bar,
       could be set to always be front/back, could be iconified, and could
       have a separate time from the system clock

  8.8  Disk cache

  8.8  Calculator improvement - fractions, degrees, radians, trig, convert
       between bases, percent

  8.8  PhotoCD reader or datatype for PhotoCDs

  8.8  Visual clipboard (like Mac) w/ability to cut/paste pictures, sound,
       and text

  7.0  Include reqtools.library and other shareware libraries as standard,
       or create/improve sytem libraries so they are not necessary

  7.0  Make the Workbench more object oriented (Similar to NeXTStep but
       more real-time and with a more responsive user interface)

  7.0  Ability to quit WB and have all commodities, etc. automatically
       quit.  If a project/document is not savved, have a requester ask you
       if you wish to save before closing...  (Software shutdown)

  7.0  When "Insert Volume X" requester appears, have ability (through the
       requester) to assign that volume to a directory

  7.0  Easy to set up Multi-User File System

  7.0  Ability to show a specified or random picture shown at bootup (make
       the Amiga logo as the shipped default)

  7.0  A single control panel to cover all commodiites/hacks (with ability
       to add) to make configuring the look of your Workbench easier

  7.0  Automatic activation of screens after Amiga-M

  7.0  Better text viewer that uses scroll bars instead of space bar, etc.

  7.0  Bring back the phrase "Guru Meditation" (with a message, not a

       somewhere else to put it

  7.0  Have ESC translate to Cancel and RETURN to OK when using any
       requester

  7.0  Ability to boot up and have selected windows already be open for you

       monitors and the IBM world (800X600, 1024X768, 1280X1024)

  7.0  A priority manager and task remover that can also list open screens,
       open windows, what exactly is loaded into memory (like ARTM, except
       without the occaisional computer crash when a task is removed)

  7.0  Popup menus like MagicMenu, except the menus would be specific to
       what the pointer is hovering over, and perhaps even different shapes
       for each type of object it points to (Intelligent Pointer)

  7.0  Switch from AmigaGuide to HTML (more standard, more "information
       superhighway"ish, more colorful w/inline pictures

  7.0  Scalable icons for different screen modes/sizes (icons for an
       interlaced Workbench look wrong on an non-interlaced Workbench

  5.3  When you click "Cancel", have it really cancel on the first time,
       instead of having 5 more requesters

  5.3  The mouse should not "hang" in MultiView when it is loading a node
       in an AmigaGuide file

  5.3  Overall speed of MultiView needs to be increased

  5.3  Include better fonts

  5.3  Datatypes should support editing (when text, AmigaGuide, HTML, etc.)
       read and write operations so they could convert any file format into
       any other file format (of the same general type, like graphics,
       sound, etc.)

  5.3  Workbench should not load a default icon for each file in a window
       if they are being viewed by name

  5.3  Complete and total mouse emulation by keyboard (in all programs),
       using the keypad for directions

  3.5  Animated/calculated backdrops (like xfishtank)

  3.5  A standard C++ fontend and developers' package for AmigaDOS, so the
       programmer can use constructors and destructors & have the compiler

       something more in-depth for experienced ones

  3.5  Left-handed mouse capability

  3.5  If a directory is moved by dragging the icon into another directory,
       have a requester to confirm this action, so it's not an accident

  3.5  Have a prefs GUI for devices to be mounted (would move them to/from
       Storage), assigns to be made at startup, Monitors to be supported
       (also moves them), and things to be put into WBStartup and commands

  3.5  Ability to read Mac disks built in (we can already read IBM disks,
       why not go all out?)

  3.5  Have the size of a drawer listed in "view by name", where like the
       Mac, it just updates the size as it calculates it, instead of
       delaying showing the drawers by calculating it first

  3.5  In view by name, have the small Mac triangle gadgets at the drawers
       to get the tree effect

  3.5  Be able to snapshot the ram disk icon

  3.5  Improve the clean-up command to place icons close to their original
       position in the window, instead of moving them all over the place

  3.5  If default icons are being used, have icon file read once and re-use
       as necessary instead of multiple reads.  (Put default icons into
       ram: as an option?)

  3.5  If you don't have enough ram to open a new application/document, the
       system should check to see which applications are running that you
       are not currently using, and give you the option to close one or
       more of them to free up enough memory.

  3.5  Have the ability to clean up in an alphabetized order, or a
       drawers-first order.

  3.5  When using Copy, have a progress indicator (a bar, preferably)

  3.5  Have a special alert when formating a hard drive

  3.5  Have some sort of "lock" so selected files can't be deleted

  3.5  Some type of uninstall program that gets rid of libraries/fonts/etc.

       cursor, etc. for all programs to use

  3.5  Support for non-paletted (15/16/24 bit) or semi-paletted (HAM6/8)
       Workbench screens.

  3.5  When using datatypes to display a picture, and picture has more

       close as possible.

  3.5  Allow the information displayed on the title bar to be configurable,
       i.e., user can choose to show 1 or more of: date, memory, time, #
       screens open, cpu usage, cps rate for downloading, etc.

  3.5  Shared libraries that simulate GUI calls for other OS's by calling
       Intuition.  (XWindows, System 7, and MS-Windows libraries) (Would
       ease porting of applications)

       be standard on all Amigas)

  3.5  Nicer looking prefs GUI.

  3.5  Full-featured "find file" from desktop, where drawers and windows are
       opened for you to get to the file

  3.5  A decent, standard palette for each color level for the Workbench.
       Perhaps have Grey, Faded, Normal, and Bright versions.


A few (a very few) of the comments that I received are mentioned here.
These were picked semi-randomly from groups of similar comments.  One
person's name was lost when the message was forwarded from Jason Compton to
myself, so I apologize in advance for not being able to give full credit
for his/her statement...


"The Amiga GUI is the most intuitive and easy to use GUI out there...
however there are dozens of little things about it that keep sticking their
heads up.  Maybe a life long Amiga user would have gotten used to it.  But
I've only had my A4000/030 for just over 1 year.  Before that I was an avid
MS-Windows user..."   -- David Zvekic

"....dealers have their workbenches set up in the worst possible ways.
[i.e. - 4 colors, ugly icons, clicking drive, etc...]  If I didn't see an
Amiga at a friends house FIRST before seeing it at the store, I probably
never would have bought one."   -- David Zvekic

"I want to be able to use any application with my keyboard, without using
my mouse.  Microsoft Windows meets this requirement.  Don't ask me to
install third party packages like MUI for keyboarding."  -- Quang Ngo

"...they should take a good close look at the Silicon Graphics equivalent
to the workbench on their newest OS.  It used drag drop, multiple view
modes, and exceeds the well done solution used currently on the Mac."
-- Ralph Vinciguerra

"Make the upgrade available swiftly and cheaply, no more than $50-$100.
Seriously.  Most people won't fully develop for the new OS if hardly anyone
has it."  -- Paul Nolan

"...Ii think improvements should be made in improving the functionality and
performance speed of the workbench, and not in pretty wallpaper.  Every
effort should be made to improve speed and ease of use.  Looks is of minor
concern."  -- Rene Beekman

"The style guides and RKM manuals should be updated, improved...and
ENFORCED!  By this I don't mean that programmers should have to get some
sort of license to publish software for the amiga, that would make
development unattractive.  Perhaps instead, a glowing sticker with the
words 'Amiga Approved Software' should be offered to developers who release
a package that conforms to system standards..."  -- Maureen Erin Siddall

"One of the main concerns of current and future computer owners is the
availability of software, it is therefore in the company's best interest to
encourage the proliferation of PD, shareware and commercial software
development.  One way to achieve this is to offer programming tools,
documentation and examples either as freeware or at minimal cost to the
average programmer.

I would also concentrate on better application development rather than
creating an enormous operating system. Though this may impede software
development time, a smaller OS offers several other advantages such as:

  o   The programming learning curve would be shortened because of its
      relative simplicity.
  o   Applications would not be bogged down by the OS consuming resources.
  o   Minimized risk of compounded errors as would be induced by a large
      OS.
  o   Less resource requirements (ie. less processor time, hard drive space
      and RAM consumed etc.).

....In the end it should be as easy to use as a Mac and yet should still remain
as appealing to hackers, coders, demo-makers, artists, game-players, video-
makers and hardware enthusiasts as every model has been since the original
A1000."  -- Jean-Pierre LeBel

"A good idea would be to make a...set of icons, using the NewIcons
system, but with non-isometric graphics. (this does not impose 2d look)
Graphists should have a look [at] NeXTSTEP icons."  -- Jean-Alexis
Montignies

"...just like OS/2 Warp has Internet support, so should Workbench.  I 
know that future (or current) versions of WB have network drivers, but with 
Internet becoming more important, the Workbench should support it.  This 
Internet support should include those who need dial up SLIP/PPP access as 
well as direct LAN hookup.  If not part of the OS, CEI should contract
someone to make an integrated Internet package.  It is very difficult to
get all the current software to work in unison.  I wish there was a
"Internet in a Box" for the Amiga."  -- <name lost in mail forwarding>

" In PC-Windows common resolution used for screen display is 800x600 in 256
or with better GFX cards 16.7 mil.  colors.  Of course, much utilities
support 16.7 mil.  colors.  Also it is not unlikely seeing pictures in
1024x768 or 1024x1024.  In AMIGA-WB default icons are adapted to be used in
640x256 and when you switch in INTERLACE they look horribly ugly !  It
would be the best to make it at least 640x512 (same size of pixels in X and
Y aspect).  But the higher resolution and higher number of colors-the
better.  Look at MAC-system 7.x.  It also works in very high resolution as
default.  It is important to keep the speed even when working in higher
resolutions." -- Zvonko Tesic

"I'd also like to remind everyone...that adding "more" to Workbench isn't
necessarily better.  While it is in need of an upgrade, one mustn't forget
that its speed, flexibility and ease of use are probably its best features
(along with low overhead multitasking, of course...).  :)" -- Ken Pierce


And finally a statement that speaks for most of us, I'm sure:

"My other wish to Your Wish List is that there would BE the new Workbench.
And the new Amiga.  That's even more important than my first wish."
 -- Sebastian Witkowski


Next issue I will outline what COULD be the "Perfect Workbench", on the
basis of the letters I received and the experience I had for 1 1/2 years in
the jungle of selling PC and Macintosh software, and hearing their
complaints and praises...

Also included will be the list of the most-often used Shareware or PD
utilities.

See elsewhere in the magazine for the beginning of a LIMITED Hardware Wish
List survey...  I don't know if I could do something like this again.  :)

@node FEATURE2 "A Brief History of Amiga Report"
@toc FEATURE

===========================================================================
==  A Brief History of Amiga Report                  By:  @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}  ==
===========================================================================

Introduction - This brief history has been compiled solely by me.  Most of
the information is from direct experience with the magazine...the
information from the issues before I was involved with it are pulled from
my observations of the issues in question.  Besides, most of the people
who might get offended don't read the magazine anymore anyway.



Somewhere in Time - Robert Glover becomes enamored with Atari STs, and the
various online Atari online magazines.

Mid 1991 - STReport, one of the aforementioned Atari online magazines,
forms AMReport.  I've read AMReports recently, just for fun.  The format was
all ASCII, there were all sorts of ads interjected for fun, and was
apparently posted on c.s.a.misc.  It apparently goes through some changes
and disappears abruptly.  At least, it disappears abruptly from Portal's
archives, and I can't find more than one issue anywhere else.  In the end,
it didn't survive.  (It's considerably shorter than current ARs...)

March 19, 1993 - Undaunted by the failure of AMReport, Mariano (Editor of
STReport) "allows" Robert Glover to start up the weekly Amiga Report,
since he thinks he owns the rights to #?Report.  Anyway, Glover, who has
just recently forsaken the ST for an Amiga 1200, tries very hard to make
AR worth reading, but never shakes his Atari loyalty, constantly
reprinting from STReport and making references to how great Ataris are.
AR starts with all sorts of people on as editorial staff: A Technical,
Graphics, and Contributing Editor can be found in the first issue.  Of
course, there are only two distribution BBSes at present, so the going is
slow.  The first issue consists of little more than a huge, rambling
thread between Jim Drew (then Vice-President of Utilities Unlimited) and a
bunch of ST users-one of whom actually threatens Drew with legal action
from Atari for his planned ST emulator.  Many issues to come will consist
of lots and lots of reposts from GEnie, until the GEnie people complain
and Glover totally drops any reference or acknowledgement of GEnie,
causing a rift only recently repaired.  The magazine is still straight
ASCII.

May 28, 1993 - Robert Niles joins AR as "Assistant Technical Editor",
bringing In the Meantime, AR's third distribution BBS.  

June 25, 1993 - Thanks to Robert Niles, Amiga Report goes to AmigaGuide
format.  Niles is now actually doing the work of putting the magazine
together, even though he's just a "Technical Editor"...

July 30, 1993 - Jason Compton's first column, The Emulation Examiner
(later Rambler) appears.  AR is up to 10 distribution BBSes.

September 10, 1993 - By this issue, 1.24, all of the original editorial
staff (except for Glover) are gone.  Thanks to Michael Witbrock, AR is now
on the World Wide Web.

November 1993 - Glover has (finally) stopped listing the people involved
in other "ST-" offshoot magazines.  They didn't exactly do anything for
AR, anyway.

January 21, 1994 - Amiga Report has taken on a slightly revamped design.
In this issue, 2.03, Glover talks about hoping to devote more time to AR
in the near future.

February 4, 1994 - Issue 2.05, and Glover leaves Amiga Report.  Robert
Niles, who had been serving as Assistant Editor (the only editorial
position left), agrees to take over Amiga Report.  His "acceptance
editorial", though, speaks of hard times and even a possible abandonment
of Amiga Report to come if things don't perk up for the struggling
magazine.

February 11, 1994 - Issue 2.06, Rick Gideon becomes Assistant Editor.  He
lasts exactly two issues.  Jason Compton is named Emulation Editor.  

February 25, 1994 - Issue 2.07, Jesper Juul becomes the first European
Editor.

May 20, 1994 - Issue 2.16, David Tiberio becomes Associate (later
Contributing) Editor.  AR has 35 distribution BBSes.

August 22, 1994 - Issue 2.25, Jason Compton takes over as Editor-in-Chief
and Robert Niles turns into the Assistant Editor.  Michael Wolf takes over
as European Editor.  AR will go biweekly, to beef up the issues and lessen
the load on the editors.

September 29, 1994 - Issue 2.28, Amiga Report holds the first-ever online
conference with a bidder for the Amiga technology.

October 10, 1994 - Issue 2.29, Katherine Nelson comes on as Copy Assistant
(Later Copy Editor, eventually Assistant Editor), taking over the hard part
of the magazine (i.e.  actually putting everything together in AmigaGuide
format.)

October 24, 1994 - Issue 2.30, Amiga Report undergoes its biggest layout
overhaul since it started in AmigaGuide over a year previous.  It's met
with mixed reactions, but it's here to stay.

December 4, 1994 - Issue 2.32, Amiga Report holds a world-first IRC
conference, with a record-setting amount of participants.  Print magazines
around the world request reprint rights.

The Present - Amiga Report has just added Sean Caszatt as Games Editor.
AR is one of the few remaining online sources for information, and is
finally gaining acknowledgement from print magazines.  An estimated 10,000
people read the magazine on every inhabited continent.  A floppy
distribution network is in the making.  Things actually look pretty good.

Who needs a Graphics or Technical Editor, anyway?

An interview with Amiga software engineer Chris Ludwig at the World of
Amiga Show in London on December 11, two days after he and the other
members of the surviving Amiga development team finally left their jobs.

AN: You're probably the last person to work for what was once called
Commodore Business Machines?

CL: Actually there's one person still working there, that Jeff Frank, head
of hardware engineering and his job at the moment is to liquidate any of
the hardware that's left at Norristown.  That may have changed since
Friday.   Friday was the last day at Commodore for myself and for a lot of
other people as well.  There were 16 of us, engineering staff.

AN: You were continuing work on a new system?

CL: There was not a lot of development going on, mainly because the
resource wasnt there, there was not a lot of money to be spent.  We didnt
have quite the number pf people we needed.  There were some software ideas
being toyed with, there were some hardware ideas being toyed with, but
there was no steady development goal...

AN: We were here last month at the Future Entertainment Show and we were
told that the HP Risc chip had been chosen as the basis for future Amiga
development.

CL: That is correct.

AN: Mr Pleasance told us this morning that the fact that work has now
stopped means that some new agreement will have to be drawn up with HP in
order to re-start development.

CL: Yes, but having said that, the deal that we had with HP was a solid
one, and I don't think there going to be a problem there.  They've got
every reason in the world to want that to go through with whoever
continues the Amiga.

AN: Was Lew Eggebrecht still working with you?

CL: Towards the very end he wasn't there full time, he was just consulting
to us, but when we needed him we could just call him.

AN: He knows the HP architecture really well?

CL: Somewhat well.  We did have a resident expert, Dr Edward Heppler, the
guy who designed the RISC 3D system, and he was there to the end.  And
he's committed to it so I'm sure that if something happened we'd get him
back on board.

AN: Did the Amiga design team take that decision to go to HP RISC or was
it a Commodore decision?

CL: It was a Commodore decision.  We spent a lot of time looking at
available processers and trying to decide which one best met the needs
that we had in mind for the future of the platform.  We chose it based on
a number of different concerns: - first of all, compatibility with
existing products.  HP, because of their having bought out Apollo
(constructeur de stations graphiques) have an interest that their
processer is 68000-compatible, so theres a 68000 compatible emulation mode
for the PA-RISC

AN: Does that exist already?

CL: Yes, that already.

AN: Is that emulation in hardware?

CL: Its both, basically.  The instruction architecture is similiar to
68000 in many ways and ther's some software emulation tricks that can be
done as well, so between those two pieces it makes migrating easy.  It
doesn't guarantiee compatibility, it's not like Power PC where you have
compatibility that's basically out-of-the-box, they haven't got that
finished and I don't know that they will, but it makes the migration path
much shorter, there's a lot less that has to be done in re-coding.

AN: HP is doing that work themselves?

CL: That's correct.

AN: So that will make it a lot easier to create something resembling
AmigaDOS portable onto the HP RISC?

CL: Exactly.  That was one of the principal reasons for choosing the HP
chip.  Other reasons were:
- we wanted a chip that would allow us a greater degree of control in
implementing our own ideas for the 3D half of the work..  For example you
can go and buy, for PowerPC for example, if you want to be a PowerPC
hardware OEM (Ed: ,original equipent manufacturer, ou autrement dit un
fabricant qui prends un produit de base d'un autre fabricant et l'utilise
pour crieer un autre produit) the PowerPC core, which is a little square
portion of the die and then they give you the L-shape around the rest of
the die in order to add in your hardware.  That's how it basically works
if you want to have a PowerPC-based chip of your own.

AN: But no PowerPC user has yet done that, they're all using the basic
chip as it comes.

CL: Yes, exactly.  It's been done with other chips.  But we wanted to have
our own die, our own semi-conductor work on the same die as the HP-RISC. 
With the PA-RISC, unlike the PowerPC, we're actually allowed to have a
free rein over the whole die, so that we can take a HP-RISC core and
basically put in pieces that we want, take out pieces that we don't want,
add instructions, which is very important for us.  We've had a lot of work
spent on designing new instructions which allow us to have really
fantastic 3D performance, and the PowerPC wouldn't have let us do that,
the HP stuff does.

AN: So you're creating a custom HP-RISC for the Amiga.

CL: Exactly, that was the plan, we're basically creating a custom PA-RISC
chip based on the PA-150, the latest one, that would allow us to have
really fantastic performance.

AN: How far have you got with that work?

CL: We've got software simulations of the chipset running.  We did
software simulations of some of the four pieces and they worked, so we're
satisfied that...

AN: Would those four chips come into one at a later stage?

CL: You mean the Amiga chips?  Yes.  Essentially, in that one core we'd be
taking the planned sound enhancements for AAA as well as all the graphics
enhancements that we've designed for the RISC release and obviously the
CPU port there as well.  You'd still need a digital/analog converter at
the end that does the colour tables for the back end of the video, but
those are standard parts, it's not something that we have to design
ourselves, and you've basically got a one-chip solution, that's scalable.
Another reason for choosing the PA-RISC was that the PA-RISC is designed
around allowing you to have a multi-processer system, with other
processors acting as enabling processors.  So that for example we could
have a one-chip solution which would be very low cost for games sytems for
example, that was just our version of the custom PA-RISC, but we could
have higher-end systems where our chip is actually just a sub-processer
that's doing graphics work and another PA-RISC is doing the!  major
computation, so you've now doubled the through-put of the system and you
still get all of the graphics performance that you have but your
competition haven't on the PA-RISC chip, so you've got really tremendous
performance.  And you can scale that architecture to get quite high-end
systems.

AN: Does that go as far as controlling transputers?

CL: It's not quite the same as transputers, it's not infinitely scalable.
Transputers obviously give you a lot more scalability in that direction.
But its a more tight integration as well.  From a software perspective
it's easier to code for because you're basically spawning off the graphics
sub-tasks to the other chip, it's basically designing it as if you were
working with a one-chip solution.

AN: So how much time would be needed to finish it.

CL: We're looking at 18 to 20 months from inception.  When somebody gets
the deal and says 'Go forward' and the money's there it'll take about 18
months.  It's the whole chip design that needs to be done and software
support has to be done...  it'll take some time.

AN: And that's not variable depending on the resources that you put behind it?

CL: Well of course it is, but not to a great extent.  That's probably the
fastest it could be done.  But the amount of resources required isn't
tremendously huge compared to what we've had in the past.  It's certainly
a do-able thing.

AN: Apparently Windows NT would run on this.

CL: Sure, Windows NT runs on PA-RISC and we're not taking anything away
that would prevent that.

AN: So tell us what AmigaDos would look like on such a machine.  In what
way would it be able to retain the AmigaDos that we know.

CL: The plan is simply to port AmigaDos to the chip.  So Exec will be
ported, graphics will be ported, Intuition will be ported, all portions of
AmigaDos that currently exist will be ported, the idea being that the
system will be wholly an Amiga, with the capability of running Windows NT
as well.  Because it's a PA-RISC there will already be native compiled
versions of NT.  You're basically talking about a box that can run two
OS's.  Three if you count HP's system.

AN: The new AmigaDos would not be compatible with existing software.

CL: That's correct, people would have to re-compile their existing
software.  But, again, because of the chips degree of compatibility with
the 68000 line that shouldn't be a gargantuan effort.  It should be about
as straightforward as it is for Apple people to recompile in order to get
their current 68000-based applications to run on PowerPC.

AN: Is all this something that can realistically be done now if someone
ends up buying the Amiga?

CL: Absolutely.  It's a matter of ensuring that there's some vision at the
top of the company in order to let something like this go through.
Commodore has too often in the past been in the situation of having
designed very cool products which just at the very end of the life cycle
after we've spent all the money on them don't actually make it to market
because the people at the top have a lack of vision and when they see the
finished product say "Oh no, they wouldn't wanna buy that." But I don't
think we'll see that with the potential buyers.

AN: This work you've been doing is one of the major assets of Commodore
and we suppose that's why the liquidator kept it going.  That means that
anybody who buys Commodore will be able to continue this project.

CL: Absolutely.  It really depends on how the buy-out happens.  Anyone
who's buying the whole company will get the rights to build this computer.
But there's been talk that the liquidator may be deciding to sell off the
company piecemeal which would mean that if someone wanted to pick up just
this technology they could come in with a smaller figure than the full
value of the company, and somebody else could buy the right to use the
names Amiga, etc.

AN: Do you think that people who have been working on this will be able to
come back if the sale happens fairly quickly?

CL: If it happens fairly quickly I feel personally quite certain that
people who were involved would be interested in coming back.  It depends
on how long it takes.  In six months from now if nothing's happened I'm
sure they'll all have jobs and they'll probably be quite happy with them.
Its maybe not going to be the same spark that we had with Commodore, but
you never know.  If the money's good, you've got wives and children...

AN: Mr Amor said on Portal the other day that he wasn't sure which RISC
chip to go for.  He said the Mac and the PC were pulling towards the
PowerPC, but talks had already gone on with HP.  He didn't seem to be
firmly fixed on this idea of an HP-RISC chip.

CL: The truth is that he's had very little contact with the engineering
staff.  He's been around once or twice but beyond that things have been in
a vacuum.

AN: You've had more contact with oher teams?

CL: Yes, definitely.  We've had more contact with teams that have gone
away now.  At one point Samsung were a potential buyer.

AN: Amstrad?

CL: Yes, but that was a long time ago.

AN: Philips?

CL: Correct.

AN: All these people are apparently going to have another possibility of
making a last bid.

CL: Sure.  I think that having got rid of the engineers and Christmas
obviously being dead now, it means the value of the company has probably
been reduced quite a bit, and people who lost interest before may be more
interested now that the price has gone down.

AN: We heard some months ago that Samsung were not really interested in
continuing the Amiga computer line.

CL: It's difficult to say.  They were obviously interested in the
engineering know-how that we had and in a number of the hardware designs
that we had.  Whether or not they were interested in continuing the Amiga
as a product line is difficult to say.

AN: Do you have a personal favourite buyer?  Who has most impressed you? 
I'll try not to let anybody hear your answer (AmigaNews Ed: David
Pleasance was in the same room during part of this interview but was
talking with Jim Drew and other people).

CL: All I can really say is, whoever takes over the company I hope they
have a driving instinct and vision to bring forth the best that the
platform has to offer.  I worry that people may have a short-term view of
what to do with the platform, that some of the buyers will have a
potential of just wanting to do a kind of smash and grab operation.

AN: You think there are some like that?

CL: I think so.

AN: Do you think there are some serious ones as well?

CL: Yes there are some serious ones.

AN: Would you include CEI and the English Commodore team?

CL: Yeah...

AN: You're not very sure.

CL: It's difficult to say.  I think that the UK team have a real clear
idea of where they want to go, and that's very important.

AN: The Amiga has done very well in the sense of its technological
specialities.  How may of those would you be keeping with this new system,
like draw-down screens, video compatibility, this sort of thing.

CL: Obviously the chip-set's gotta be video compatible.  One of the major
reasons for making sure that we have a low-end version of the chipset is
that it would be usable in video games, set-top boxes, and low cost
multimedia presentation devices like a cheap television set-top bo, so
it's gotta have video compatibility.  The blitter portion of the engine
will retain peroccupatibility with current blitter stuff.

AN: Scrolling the way we've got it now?

CL: Yeah, yeah, we'll have scrolling.  A number of the current video modes
will be available or at least emulated, aand then the the new video modes
I think you going to be surprised with.  There's some great modes.

AN: Sprites?

CL: We're probably going to toss sprites altogether.  If you look at how
games programmers write games today, very few of them are actually using
sprites any longer.  They use just one sprite for the main character and
they toss out the rest; just because the overhead for sprites, while it's
minimal, it's so much easier these days to, especially if you're porting
to PC compatibles, to not have to deal with the sprite issue.  It just
makes more sense to dispose with it altogether and use the real estate
that we gain to enhance the 3D abilities.

AN: Is the AAA chipset definitely out?

CL: I don't know that it's definitely out.  Dave (Haynie) spent a lot of
time getting a system out that would, at least from a hardware
perspective, work I think the ig problem with it is that from a
feature-set standpoint it really doesn't buy us enpough in the short-term
to be useful in the short-term and in the long-term we're better off
trying to leapfrog the feature-set entirely so that we have something new
and innovative, and that's why we focused on the RISC-3D stuff.

AN: The specifications of the AAA seemed pretty impressive from the
average Amiga user's point of view, and now you're talking about
leapfrogging.  Is the Custom RISC really that much better than AAA?

CL: Oh yes, definitely.  From what we know reading IEEE magazine and
playing with them our system will beat the pants off a Saturn (Sega's
coming console).  We've designed it around being a really fantastic
system, exercising the best of the resources that Commodore's always had,
basically designing our own chips rather than going out to someone else
and just using an off-the-shelf chip.  We've got some really good stuff
planned.

AN: So you can envisage having a wide range of Amiga products, from the
games player to the professional user, in the real tradition of the Amiga
which has been so hard to market...

CL: Yes it has been hard to market.  That's it.  It's one of our assets,
and getting rid of it by just concentrating on one end or the other would
be a mistake.

AN: So you've got built in there all sorts of texture mapping and other
capabilities?

CL: Yes.  Basically the blitter has grown features that allow it to do
texture mapping, that allow it to do shading like the new consoles, but
faster and with higher quality video modes, so that we've got a greater
resolution than the consoles have, because at the high end we're going to
need that resolution.  We've got completely programmable pixel rates, as
you know that's basically a feature that started with AA, that AAA grew
some, and this basically continues that growth path so that we'll be able
to do a large number of graphic modes.  We have true colour modes
(24-bit), we have some fairly innovative colour reduction modes, similar
to HAM but a bit different, we have YUV modes so it'll be much more simple
for us to do PhotoCD support, we've also got some 32-bit modes where we've
got a transparency channel as well.

AN: 24-bit colour on screen in high resolution?

CL: Yes, sure.  Obviously that's not the kind of mode you'd want to use
for a games system, because it takes too much bandwith, the graphics take
up too much space, but it's there because the same chipset could be used
in a high-end system to provide a true-colour, high-resolution desktop
interface.

AN: How much of that system is in this one central chip that you're
talking about.  Is there an external graphics sub-system?

CL: It's all in the one chip.  Everything is in there except RAM, ROM, and
the RAMDAC for the colour tables.

AN: What is the cache situation?

CL: There's an internal cache for the PA-RISC and then there's some
external cache space as well.

AN: One of the big problems of the Amiga is the lack of memory protection.
One programme crash can bring down the whole system.  Will that be
eliminated?

CL: Obviously if we're going to go to the trouble of porting the OS to
another chip then we have the opportunity at that point to get rid of all
the problems that we've had to live with in exec.  We would have done it a
long time ago but certain internal features of exec made it difficult to
do.

AN: It will be one of the advantages of losing compatibility!

CL: Exec won't be an easy port because it's written entirely in assembly
code but it's a small, tight core so it shouldn't be too difficult.

AN: What sort of a clock speed would this turn at?

CL: Whatever clock speed the Pa-RISC chips are available now.  I know
they're doing 100MHz, so...

AN: What sort of upgrade path is foreseeable for the 4000?

CL: At the moment in-house there are no designs for anything beyond 25MHz
'040.  I think what we're looking at as a likely prospect would be OEM'ing
somebody else's add-on CPU card design and then building those into the
box, just as a short-term solution.  It's definitely true that we need to
have a 4000 with higher specifications on the market and that gives us a
quick way of doing that.

AN: What was your function the Commodore team?

CL: I was hired on about three and a half years ago to do multi-media
standards.  Basically I managed the IFF standard, handling registrations
for the forms and so forth and tried within the organisation to bring in
standards from the outside world and develop our own standards where there
weren't already standards in place, and then get developers to adopt the
standards.  Unfortunately as usual in Commodore there was very little
resource to expend towards these efforts so not a lot came of it, but we
had some good work.  For example CAMDI (Commodore Amiga Midi Driver),
which is essentially a MIDI library-style system for allowing MIDI
applications to share access to the MIDI ports so that there is automatic
merging of the MIDI data.  From that work a host of people ended up with
another library called Real Time Dat Library which provides the
synchronisation and timing information from a master clock source which
can be generated by the library itself or come externally from ti!  me
code devices, and then this master clock is distributed to sub-tasks that
want it.  So for example you can synchronise multiple animation playbacks
simultaneously with sound playback because Real Time Library helps all the
allocations to keep track.

AN: Isn't all this work going to be lost when you change the CPU?

CL: No, the plan is to bring it all over.  That's one of the reasons it's
going to take 18 months.  A good thing is that having picked an already
existing RISC core, even while the hardware work is progressing much of
the software work can be started immediately because you can go out and
buy an HP Workstation today with a PA-RISC chip in it.  Basically we'll
have software simulation of graphics sub-systems and whatever graphics
abilities are available on the workstation, to the extent that they can
emulate, will be used.  It's going to be completely different because what
we have in our own hardware is obviously going to be much faster, but from
our perspective, developing system software, that doesn't matter much and
we'll be able to programme a significant portion of the OS without having
the graphics end of the chipset done.  We know what the graphics chipset
is going to do and we can write software that emulates that.

AN: So developers will be using an HP workstation to create the future
Amiga.

CL: Precisely.  It has to be that way because 18 months sounds like a long
time when you're thinking about how long it will be before somebody's
hardware is released, but if you're a software developer, as you well
know, 18 months doesn't seem like much at all in order to learn a whole
new system and to come out with some decent software for it.

AN: Amiga developers will probably have a hard time learning to programme
for the new machine, won't they?

CL: I think you'll find that we'e tried to maintain the basic chip
philosophy.  It's obviously not going to be compatible on a register
level, so people who have been hitting the hardware all along are going to
have to learn all over again!  But if you're doing system programming then
I don't think you've got anythiung to worry about.  You should be able, at
the end, without doing much more than simply recompiling your software,
have something that works.  That's the goal.  We have a huge base of very
good software out there.  But I think you'll find that even in public
domaine this is where people go ahead because they wanna be first...

AN: One last question.  If this new Amiga was produced in two years time,
what would be its main advantages over the Mac and the PC?

CL: I think that one important point is that the machine will come as a
base with outstanding graphics performance.  As a system to do 3D
rendering, a as system to do commercial video work, you're going to find
that our system will be able to compete just as well as Amigas compete
today.  In 18 months to two years time, when the PCs are coming to where
we are today, we'll have gone forward another generation.

===========================================================================
== Marbleizing Your Amiga                            By:  Eric Rainbolt  ==
===========================================================================

This article is for all of you who want to do something creative with your
Amiga's standard and rather boring, some might even add PC'ish, offwhite
paintjob.  Well, you can change that and make something really cool, and
this article is about what I did and the methods I used.

First of all, I have to say that I am no great world recognized artist by
any comparison.  The process that I am about to describe here is simple
enough for any and all amigaphiles to do.  It should cost less than $25
bucks, will provide visual pleasure a lifetime, and will make your Amiga
look very hip.  ( like it isn't already ) ;)

The first thought to come to mind is what kind of texture and what kind of
colour do I want to use?  I decided on a marble texture; now I had to
decide between Danube Blue, Tiffany Rose, Ivory, Black Onyx or Florentine
Green.  Since my favourite colour is the colour of money, I decided to use
Florentine Green.  Actually, I couldn't decide at the art supply store, so
I bought all the colours.  Florentine Green is made up of all the colours
you would see on a dollar bill, looks pretty sharp as a marble finish also.
I also think some psychologists think green is a good mood enhancing colour
to view, so what the heck, the decision was made.

I bet you are wondering where you can get one of the "Marbleizing Kits",
but just hold your horses for a little bit, and I'll tell you at the end of
the article.  By the end of this article you should be completely set and
educated in the fine art of marbleizing.

I hope you are convinced by now, if not, this just might not be for you,
but I encourage you to read on, the application process is pretty
interesting.  ( Who says paint has to go on with a brush?  )

It is simple to marbleize your computer.  At first I was disappointed that
the marbleizing kit said "Not recommended for plastic surfaces.", but I
tried it anyway, and I can tell you, this stuff is stuck on like a painted
bowling ball, it doesn't come off easy.  All that is in the marbleizing kit
are some acrylic paints, something called "extender", something called
"thickener", a torn up sponge, a feather for putting on the marble veins
and a sponge brush you can use for applying the basecoat ( in my case this
was licorice black ).  You have to acquire some clear polyurethane sealer
for a smooth marble-like finish when you are all finished painting also.

The first step I did, and I did this the night before I started painting (
approx 1.5 hours depending on how good of a job you want to do ) was to
prepare the plastic surface by using a very fine grade sand paper.  I did
three parts; actually four if you consider the keyboard separate.  I
lightly scratched the surface of all the plastic I intended to paint.  I
used horizontal sweeps and then vertical sweeps to try and give the surface
a texture that would really help the paint grip.  After I did all the
surfaces on my monitor, my A3000, the keyboard and my printer, I thoroughly
wiped all the dust off and removed all the grease and dirt with some glass
cleaner.  Surely, any household cleaner will work, as long as it doesn't
leave any oil or wax on the surface ( stay away from products like Pledge
or WD-40; I'm sure you have the idea.) I already started becoming impressed
when I noticed my 3000 brightened up and looked like it was fresh from the
box.  I then took some 3" masking tape and taped off the monitor screen,
the serial plates on back, and all the connectors. 

The next evening, I started applying the basecoat.  The marbleizing kit
gives you enough paint to cover 12 square feet.  This was plenty, and I had
some extra when I finished basecoating my IDEK 17" ( this sucker is huge )
monitor, the 3000, the keyboard and my BJ-200 printer.  The basecoat colour
was labeled 'Licorice Black'.  It looked pretty black to me, and when I was
finished I was debating on just leaving it black.  It started to look real
cool all black, and I liked the idea of having a Stealth 3000.  But then
again, I had a goal in mind, and that was to go through with the
marbleizing.

It is a good idea to let the paint dry for 24 hours, although the acrylic
paints feels pretty dry after two hours.  I should mention at this point
that cleanup is easy.  All the paints are water-based acrylic, so even if I
got it on my clothes, I was able to easily wash it out.

Also, I elected not to use the sponge brush supplied with the kit.  I think
it would be a better idea if they included a brush to get at all the tight
spots, like the vents on the monitors and the fins on the front of the
3000.  A half inch to an inch soft brush is my best recommendation.  After
I was done basecoating all the surfaces and turning that boring white into
an evil looking black colour, I put all the pieces aside and spent the rest
of the evening hooking up my trusty 500 and checking my e-mail and reading
the news.

The next evening I began the actual marbleization process.  This takes a
bit longer than basecoating, especially if you are nervous about it.  The
idea is simply to put the stuff on, and nervousness actually helps make it
look better.  The first thing you need to do is set up your palette.  I
used a cookie baking sheet, but anything that isn't absorbent and no
smaller than a plastic plate will work.  What you do is squeeze some paint
in an irregular fashion all over the plate, the kit calls it Marbleizing
Colour A, but it's basically the colour most of your marble is going to be,
for Florentine Green Marble, Marbleizing Colour A was Summer Sky.  Next you
spaghettize { like spaghetti } Colour B on top of Colour A ( about 1/2 as
much as Color A ).  Then you add a little bit of white ( about 1/32 as much
as you used Colour A ).  The next step in making your palette is to pour on
as much thickener ( a clear solution ) as colour A and half as much
extender solution. 

The thickener makes the colours mix in an opaque fashion and the extender
solution makes the colours mix in a translucent fashion - like real marble!


Ok, now you have a load of paint ready to go on your palette.  I recommend
that you blur the colours together by tipping your palette forward and
backward and sideways.  This way, the colours mix and give you a realistic
marble colour combination.

The next thing you need is a sponge with certain parts of it finger torn
off to give the sponge a rougher texture.  A good sponge size is about 2"
by 4".   You then wet the sponge, clench out any excess water and then
gently rest the sponge, without pushing down too hard, on the palette of
colours.  The sponge will then have enough paint on it to do about 5-10
applications.

What you do is press the sponge on the surface, lift off cleanly, and then
rotate the position of the sponge and do it again, responging some areas to
give a very irregular and non-uniform colouring to the surface.  The best
place to start is probably on the back or underside of the computer or
monitor to get some practice.  Also, starting in the upper left hand corner
of a side is a good practice.  Pretty soon, you'll be amazed at the
results.  If the sponge begins to fade, simply refresh the sponge by
pressing it onto the palette.   Every once in a while you should clean your
songe by rinsing it with water.   Redoing sections over again enhances the
irregularity and makes it really look real.

After you are done sponging the whole computer, simply let that dry for
about 2 hours or until the paint feels pretty dry.  Then you can begin the
real interesting part of "veining" your marble.  Real marble usually has
veins of mineral running through it, and the veins are normally apparent on
the surface.  To imitate veins in your marble, you simply take a feather (
any common bird feather will do ) and a little white paint and some
thickener and extender.   It's better to use more thickener and extender
than paint to give the marble lines a real appearance.  Simply make a small
palette of these three ingredients and stroke the feather through the
palette until you have some soaked into the feather.  Gently and nervously
work your way across the marble finish.  Veins in marble usually appear
pretty much parallel to each other, so try to keep your veins pretty much
parallel.  Never make them intersect because this could ruin the look.  Be
very creative and apply as many veins as you like.  Some parts you can give
more veins than others.  Whatever catches your eye is probably the best.
If you can find a picture or two of real marble ( which is supplied in the
kit ), you can get some pointers on how to properly paint the veins.

So, it is as simple as that.  It is again advisable to let the parts
thoroughly dry ( 24 hours ) before performing the last step which is
putting on the clear polished appearance.

You can use an non-yellowing varnish or polyurethane finish.  I preferred
to use the spray can variety and one standard can does the whole job
nicely.  It stinks, so make sure you warn other members of the household. 
Spray the entire surface and let dry for another day.

I guarantee to you that no matter how lousy of a job you think you might
have done, if you ask other people's opinion, they will think it's great. 
I personally think the monitor looks best since it is the biggest piece of
equipment.  It has the prehistoric rock and modern technology mix that
looks cool.

I'm really glad I did this to my 3000.  It really makes it stand out and I
think your Amiga will like you better if you give her a paint job.  Plus,
as an added bonus, forget about writing down the serial numbers ( which
will never make your computer turn up if it ever gets stolen ), just tell
the cops that it was a marble computer and it will probably be found pretty
quick. 

This was a pretty fun thing to do, it looks great, and it was pretty cheap.


Here are a few more tips before you begin.  If you are really worried that
you might screw up, you can apply the varnish or polyurethane after each
step, this way you can just wipe off what you just did and restart.  Also,
since I was going directly over plastic with the acrylic paint I thought a
primer might be best.  I did the 3000 with a primer coat and the monitor
just with the marble paints.  I must say that it sticks equally well ( I
can't chip the paints off either ) with or without the primer.  If you have
more time and money, possibly use the primer, but all I'm saying from my
experience it does not seem not necessary.  Use your own judgment on
deciding if you need a primer.

I just got finished tonight, and I took great joy in reassembling my 3000,
since it was too sticky to use this last day.  It took two days and three
nights to compete.  I got by just fine on my trusty A500 in the meantime
though.  I'm still amazed at the power of that little machine.  I might
just go ahead and marbleize her too.  ( I have 3 of them actually ).

Marbleizing turned out to be the coolest way to add texture and colour to
the Amiga.  If you decide you want to add some external beauty to your
Amiga, you can get the kits from some art supply stores, althought it took
me over a month to find one.  If you can find any around you ( I live near
Chicago, and I only know one store that has the kits ), I can possibly
order a whole bunch depending on how many fellow Amigans are interested,
and ship them out to you direct.  The price is $29 U.S.  dollars for the
kits and $2 dollars more if you wanted a standard size can of polyurethane,
and another $5.00 for shipping.  $10.00 shipping for international
shipments.  If I have any money left over I will consider donating it to my
favourite charity - me :).

I will also offer a money-back-gaurantee ( you pay shipping charges ) for
any unopened kits ( they are sealed in plastic ) in case you change your
mind.  I'll just send your check back.  Since I am very low on venture
capital, I'll need to ask for advanced payment before I make the big order.


You can contact me either at anon0188@nyx.cs.du.edu ( a.k.a The Guru ) or

You can also call me or fax me ( upon request; 2 calls required ) at this
phone number 1-618-549-2708.

This is a limited offer.  Since I am a full time college student right now,
I'd rather take orders and organize the entire shipment and send them away
all at once.  I could order enough from the store and have them shipped by
the end of February.  I'll be accepting orders until the 18th of February.
After I make the big order, I'll return any late sent orders/checks back to
the sender.

The Marbleizing kits come with the following materials:

                1 Marbleizing Sponge
                1 Marble Veining Feather
                1 Poly Sponge Brush
                1 Instruction Book
                1 bottle of Thickener
                1 bottle of Extender
                4 bottles of Marbleizing paints

I'll also include some fine grit sandpaper and a good brush to complete the
kit.  You'll just need some water, a plastic plate, and some polyurathane
sealer ( if you don't get it from me ).

The colours for the individual kits are as follows in the chart below:

Kit Name        Basecoat        Marbleizing     Marbleizing     Vein Color
                Color           Color A         Color B 

==========================================================================

Florentine      Licorice        Summer Sky      Tartan Green    WickerWhite
Green

Black Onyx      Licorice        Licorice        Charcoal Grey   Platinum 

Ivory           Wicker White    Gray Shadow     Straight Blue   Dove Grey

Danube Blue     Sky Blue        Blue Bell       True Blue       Gray Mist

Tiffany Rose    Cotton          Berries 'n      Raspberry       WickerWhite
                Candy           Cream

I've listed them in the order that reflects which I think is the coolest
colour for computers.  It's actually a tie between Black Onyx and
Florentine Green.  Both look real cool, although the others are not at all
bad either.   It really depends on your personal taste.

If you are able to find the kits at a local store or you made up your own
combination and marbleized your Amiga, I sure would like to hear back from
you also.

In March, I think I'm thinking about starting up a part time business from
my home doing this for local computer owners.  I've already dreamed of
selling this service for about $250.00 dollars.  It really adds alot of
style to your computer and the effort is really worth it.  Too bad most
customers would probably bring in IBM clones, but heck, at least they can
be made to look cool.

My system: A3000 030/882 8 Megs Ram, 17" IDEK Monitor, CD32 w/FMV.

I love Amigas, always have, always will.  Please feel free to write me and
tell me how much you love your Amiga and I'll make a collection.  If you
think Amiga's are the greatest, then you are already my friend and comrade.

Aminet, that huge online bastion of Amiga software available to anyone with
FTP access, is wonderful.

It's also tough to get to if you don't have FTP access.  Even if you do,
unless you have a T1 line or better, you might tire of downloading
EVERYTHING all the time...

Enter the Aminet CD-ROM series.  As the name implies, there's been more
than one.  Largely, this is caused by the fact that Aminet's just too big
to fit on one CD-ROM...that, and it's constantly being updated.  This
edition, dated November 1994, features all of Aminet's music, the most
recent uploads since Aminet 3 (the Aminet discs are more or less
quarterly) and the "best" Aminet has to offer.

Taken from the back of the jewel box, the breakdown is as follows...

1700 Songs
1600 Applications
250 Games
100 Demos
100 Pictures
80 Animations (Including an almost-complete Eric Schwartz collection)

Even though they don't admit it, they also have all of the Amiga Reports
from that time period, except 2.26, which for reasons unknown to man has
never been validated there...

Anyway, the CD is considerably more friendly to navigate than your average
FTP client.  An intricate system of AmigaGuide documents lead you through
the disc, going so far as to decompress files and, in the case of some
types of files, running the appropriate viewing apparatus on them.  (Amiga
Report can be accessed on this CD without ever typing a character, for
example.)

A very powerful and fast (considering the CD media) search program will
compile its own AmigaGuide list of all applicable files when it is
invoked, allowing you to click merrily away at whatever it is you want.

The music section itself is impressive...using MultiPlayer, the AmigaGuide
interface will randomly pick a song to play for you.  The 230 megs or so
of music are guaranteed to please.

Of course, all of the archives exist in the regular Aminet directories if
you choose not to use the AmigaGuide interface-for a BBS, perhaps.  The CD
is not self-booting for CDTV/CD32 to keep the cost down, which,
considering the end price (keep reading) is a good thing.

The organization on this disc is amazing.  I cringe to think of the work
put into the AmigaGuide interface alone.  Urban Mueller, head
administrator of Aminet, deserves some respect.

And some money.  The Aminet CD is sold in two different forms: A "Share"
edition, meaning you pay bottom-dollar for the CD (About DM 20, or US$13)
but only the distributor and the manufacturer (Stefan Ossowski's
Schatztruhe, who also pressed the Meeting Pearls CD) see any of that.  A
"Gold" edition (About DM 30, or US$20) gets about US$2.00 to Urban and
friends (the rest being swallowed by those pesky distributors and
dealers).  The concept behind the Share version is that you send Urban and
pals whatever you see fit, while the Gold gives them your money off the
top and clears your conscience without having to write an extra check.

If you own a CD-ROM drive, and don't maintain an Aminet mirror, the Aminet
CD line is a must-have.  The value is outstanding, this particular CD is
wonderful to use, and if nothing else, it's a good way to keep old issues
of Amiga Report around.

@node REVIEW2 "Assassins CD-ROM Review"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
==  Review: Assassins CD by Weird Science            By:  @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}  ==
===========================================================================

Game compilation CDs are considerably more interesting to review than
font/clipart creations...especially if the games are good, and even more
if the design is nice.  In all of these areas, the Assassins CD is a
success.

A bit of background first.  If you've ever seen an advertisement for a
PD/Shareware disk seller, you've seen mention to the Assassins line of
floppies, basically a couple hundred disks with freely redistributable
games on them.  Having a modem and net access, it's never been very
attractive to me.

Of course, having all 200 on one CD, with a full graphical interface,
bootable from the CD32, is a completely different story.

The story is this: The CD comes ready-to-run on basically any Amiga, all
the way down to CDTV.  A title screen, animation, and music greet you,
followed by a menu choice to either use the Workbench (for Parnetting or
just direct access to the CD) or their graphical menu system.

Don't pass up the menu system, even if you're not using a CD32/CDTV.  It's
quick, attractive, and most importantly will do what all CDs of this sort
should be required to do: tells you what you need to run it!  The built-in
scripts, should you choose to play, put your machine into the proper
configuration for playing the game.  I have yet to find one that fails.

The menu system breaks down games into six categories, in which are
alphabetical listings and indications, if necessary, that a game is AGA
(well, it says NOT CDTV, which you can interpret to mean AGA...)  Usually,
some sort of description is available using the interface.

There really isn't much left to be desired.  The Assassins disks are also
compressed and stored on the CD, so as not to be wasteful with space or if
you're planning to pull them off onto another Amiga.

This is good stuff.  It's simple enough so that anybody can get it up and
running instantly (games don't even choke on my SX-1's fast RAM, which
means they covered all of the bases), and has enough games on there that
you're destined to find SOMETHING that meets with your approval.  


***  NorthWest Public Domain, the provider of this disc, has a deal for
Amiga Report readers.  NPD will sell the disc at the price of
US$16.95 to anybody who admits that they read AR.  Shipping to North
America is US$2.00, US$5.00 elsewhere.  (AR has nothing to do with this
deal, and we don't profit from it in any way...)

===========================================================================
==  Clip Art and Font CD-ROM Roundup                 By:  @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}  ==
===========================================================================

Weird Science Clip Art CD-ROM

Aimed at both Amigas and PCs, the 560 megs on here cover a vast range of
formats, from PageStream to Print Shop, with the obligatory load of black
and white IFFs and a generous helping of EPS images.  One nice addition is
the rather large selection of color IFFs and brushes.  For some reason,
most of the color IFFs revolve around animals, and the brushes are
largely either Disney characters or images you might find in a store...

The disc also includes utilities for the Amiga and PC.  The Amiga utils,
largely (if not totally) lifted from the Walnut Creek Aminet CD-ROM (as
the README file suggests) revolve around decompression.  The PC side
includes its own uncompression programs, as well as a couple of low-level
paint programs.


Weird Science Fonts CD-ROM

The logical companion to the above, this 580-meg CD surprisingly enough
has the same utilities directory, you can find the standard Adobe, CG, and
PostScript selections, as well as the "standard" Amiga type, color fonts,
PageStream, PCX, and ProDraw fonts.

The selection is huge, no question about it, but some of the files,
inexplicably, are compressed with LHA.  No huge complaint here, since
after all it means you're getting more font for the space on the disk, but
it strikes me as odd considering that there's still a good 70 megs or so
free...


BCI Clip Art and Font CD

Whereas the Weird Science CDs double-target the Amiga and PC markets, the
BCI CD is presented as Amiga-only.  The clip-art comes in IFF, EPS, and
PCX (which doesn't exactly rule out PC-use), all of it black and white,
and the fonts are Adobe and PageStream-only.  A rather convenient file-
and directory list are included on the main directory, as is a rather
extraneous CRC list.  

Within 540 megs or so is a large enough collection to keep anyone busy for
a time.  


Micro R+D CD-ROM Volume 3-"Publisher's Companion"

This CD is the only one brave enough to stake its Amiga identity clearly
enough to actually use mixed upper-and-lower case lettering.  The 133-meg
package headlines the 600 Amiga Font package, 670 fonts in both PostScript
and CG format, 1200 EPS images, and (of course) a complete boatload of
black and white IFFs.

And, as a bonus to the desktop publisher who doesn't want to spend all of
his or her time desktop publishing, about 20 games are included on the CD.
A nice gesture, and some of the games (MegaBall, in particular) are
actually pretty good.


So, you're looking for an upshot to all of this?  Any of the above four
CDs are going to give you enough to load up your FONTS: and graphics
directories.  The Micro R+D CD was a bit surprisingly small, but also
seems to have the largest "standard" set of fonts in the 600 Amiga Fonts
package.  The BCI disc is well balanced, although the clip art leans
towards the EPS category.  The Weird Science CDs are cornucopias of
whatever could be found, in any category, and not all of it will be useful
to everybody.  But, with such similar prices, the decision is largely up
to the end user.

@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
==  Review:  Fresh Fish CD-ROM Volume 7              By:  @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}  ==
===========================================================================

So, what do you do if you're Fred Fish, founder of a legendary floppy-disk
line and prolific purveyor of CD-ROMs?

You keep making them, of course.  Fresh Fish is Fred's line of CD-ROMs for
people who are looking for something rather specific in a CD.

In this case, if you're looking for Fresh Fish, you're probably a
programmer, or at least somebody who will make something useful out of the
hundreds of megs of GNU source code and Commodore development tools
(V37-V40 of the NDUK material as well as the old RKRMs from a Fred Fish
disk.)

To keep you busy in the meantime (and fill up space, but shhh, don't tell)
are the entire catalogs of all Fish disks (and other CD-ROM lines), the
comp.sys.amiga.reviews FTP site snapshot, and a good 100 megs or so of
"useful" programs (conveniently and familiarly set into an Aminet-like
hierarchy.)  In short, this is the way Fred keeps taking the submissions
he originally became famous for, but now there's no hassling with
floppies.

As a source for development tools, includes, libraries, source, etc. you
can't go wrong.  Entire language compiler packages can be found here.  The
Commodore stuff isn't bad, either...after all, it's not like you can call
up CATS looking for it.  The fact that everything (except some C= material
and some other restrictions) is packed-and-ready for BBSes helps as well.

If you're just looking for "cool stuff on a CD-ROM", though, there are
better choices.

@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
==  Review:  GoldFish CD-ROM Volume 1                By:  @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}  ==
===========================================================================

So, you're Fred Fish, compiler of a wildly successful line of floppy
disks.  What do you do now?  I mean, you have a thousand of them, enough
is enough!

What else?  Slap the whole thing on a couple of CD-ROMs and call the
floppy line quits.  GoldFish does exactly that.  In both unarchived and
archived (BBS-ready) setup, you've got all 1000 of the works.

As you might hope, you can use a decent search program to find what you're
looking for, just in case you don't want to drag out magazine listings
from the past 8 years or so just to get a hold of a program...

What else remains to be said?  The two-pack cleverly comes in a single
jewel box, which flips open to reveal both CDs.  (Only egotistic
productions like Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals use those nasty,
inefficient, and storage-system incompatible double-width packs for two
lousy CDs.)

It might just be my imagination, but this set of CDs has a slower response
time on my CD32's drive than any other disc I've ever put in there.  It
might be a result of the often long directories.  Or, quite possibly, it's
my imagination.

If you find that your local BBS'es selection of Fish disks just is too
inconvenient (or, say, they don't have one) and you want a 9-year saga of
history on two small platters, this is a good collection to go for.  And
if you get bored with the selection, you can play with the nifty jewel
box.

===========================================================================
==  Review:  GoldFish CD-ROM Volume 2                By:  @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}  ==
===========================================================================

Just as GoldFish 1 is to Fish disks, so is GoldFish 2 to Fresh Fish
CD-ROMs.

By that, I mean that GoldFish 2 is a compilation of "The good stuff" from
Fresh Fish discs 1-7.  Unlike buying a single Fresh Fish, this two-disc
set represents more of a general-interest taste.  In addition to the
development tools and such, much of the content is again in "Aminet-ish"
form, and content.  About 400 megs worth uncompressed.

It's a package to consider if you're looking to expand your programming
horizons as well as pick up a few hundred megs of "other" enjoyable and
handy programs.  As a marriage between the two, GoldFish 2 is one to pick.
Still, the same warning I made about Fresh Fish applies: If you're not
going to use the hundreds of megs of source code and libraries, you can
probably get a better deal for yourself elsewhere.

P.S. Fred used a different single-width jewel box to hold both CDs.  This
one is less intuitive and easier to screw up the paper inserts with.

TITLE

    Phonebill

VERSION

    3.2

AUTHOR

    Raymond Penners <raymondp@stack.urc.tue.nl>

DESCRIPTION

    `phonebill' is, simply said, a log file analyzer. What it basically
    does is scan log file(s) generated by a terminal program or a mailer,
    extract all information about calls you have made by using your modem,
    and store this in its own (short) format. After extracting the calls
    `phonebill' can generate various reports in which you can find
    information on duration and costs of the calls.

    Here is a small list of the main features:

     * Very flexible user-configurable rates, supporting exceptions for
       certain days and dates. Handles fees and time units with up to 9
       decimals (e.g. $1.2344657 dollars per 30.225678 seconds).

     * User-configurable log scanners: `phonebill' by default supports
       various log files, but for any log file that is not supported the
       user is able to create a scanner. The following is a list of log
       files that are already supported:
          * AmiTel
          * AutoPilot
          * CyberPager
          * DreamTerm
          * GPFax
          * ISDN Master Telephone log
          * JamMail
          * JrComm
          * MagiCall
          * MicroDot
          * Multifax (both v2.0 and Multifax professional)
          * NComm
          * Off-line Amiga
          * Term action log and Term call log
          * Terminus
          * TheAnswer
          * TKR-BTX
          * Trapdoor
          * Trapfax
          * UUCP TimeLog
          * XenoLink

     * Log files can be automatically truncated if their size exceeds the
       maximum size.

     * Generates miscellaneous reports: statistics, total costs, predicted
       costs ...

     * Context-sensitive online help.

     * Supports new 3.0 features (new look menus, ...).

     * Nice `Amiga User Interface Style Guide' conformant user interface.

     * Supports `traplist.library'.

NEW FEATURES

    The following is a list of the most significant changes:

     * Added scanners for AmiTel, Off-line Amiga, DreamTerm,
       ISDN-Master-Telephone-Log.

     * Added a new cookie for fido-style addresses to the scanner.  If
       you have `traplist' installed the address found will be used to
       find the real name and phonenumber of the host.  You'll need to
       configure the "Nodelist path" (see miscellaneous settings).

     * Phonebill has become a commodity.

     * Added: if you want to rescan the log files you won't have to go
       through the trouble of removing the signatures with a text editor,
       just use the new `Rescan logs' menu item.

     * New: option for disabling writing signatures to the log file

     * New: report presets (for the scan range and groups).

     * New hosts can be automatically added by supplying the rate(s) with
       a pattern to match certain area codes.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    Workbench 2.04 or higher.

DESCRIPTION

     This is a standard ("Preferences") Amiga printer driver for Stylus
     Color inkjet printer from Epson. It features resolutions up to
     720x720 dpi, with optional MicroWeave printing (an Epson feature
     that uses overlapping passes to reduce banding). Resolutions are
     selected by the Preferences density setting:

        Density 1       180x180
        Density 2       360x180
        Density 3       360x360
        Density 4       360x360, MicroWeave
        Density 5       720x720
        Density 6       720x720, MicroWeave
        Density 7       720x720, MicroWeave (identical to Density 6)

     The driver implements horizontal and vertical whitespace stripping,
     as well as Epson compression mode 2 ("TIFF v4.0 packbits mode") to
     minimize the amount of data that must be sent to the printer and
     improve printing speed. A beta tester reported speed on an Amiga
     3000 comparable to that of a 66MHz 486 with Epson's MS-Windows
     driver.

     The driver implements a very simple color correction (perhaps more
     appropriately called density correction) for 720dpi modes to
     prevent them from printing excessively dark.  This gives results
     similar to other drivers on the same printer (for example, the
     PageStream 2.x LQ2550C driver).  We are currently developing
     version 2.0, which will feature improved color correction to
     provide more accurate colors and better gradation. 

NEW FEATURES

     Version 1.1 includes a StylusColor preferences program for
     Workbench 2.04 and later that allows selection of bidirectional
     mode, disabling of the 720 dpi density correction, and allows
     selection of MicroWeave in densities which normally don't use
     that option (1, 2, 3, and 5).

     1.1 is a free update for registered owners of version 1.0. Email
     sales@endicor.com with your serial number and a request for an
     upgrade, and we'll email 1.1 back to you. Thanks to The Flying
     Circus BBS (phones 210-521-8061, -8062, -8063), we now have a BBS
     product support area. Send private mail to "Endicor" with your
     serial number and request access to the product support area.
     Once you have access to the Endicor area you can download updates.

     If you wish to have a new 1.1 disk shipped to you, send a check for
     US$4 to our address above with a note requesting 1.1 and noting
     your serial number.  The $4 covers the cost of the disk and manual
     plus shipping. 

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     - Workbench 1.3 or higher. (2.04 and later required for the new
       features in version 1.1)
     - An Epson Stylus Color printer (of course).

PRICE

     Regular price is $44.95.  We are please to announce that the $34.95
     introductory price has been extended through the end of February,
     1995, in order to allow those ordering from our new distributors
     to take advantage of the introductory price.

     Texas residents must add sales tax (6.25%). San Antonio
     residents add Texas and San Antonio sales tax (totals 7.75%).
     Shipping and handling is $2, or $4 for UPS Second Day Air,
     or $9 for UPS Overnight.  We can offer electronic delivery for
     orders prepaid by check or money order, in which case there is
     no shipping charge. Please contact us for details.

     We can accept payment by check, money order, or COD ($4 extra).
     Sorry, we cannot accept credit cards at this time.  We are
     working to find distributors who can.

     All prices in US funds. Please contact us by phone or email for
     international orders. You may wish to use electronic delivery to
     save on shipping.

     When ordering by mail, please include: Name, shipping address,
     postal address, phone number, and method of delivery. If you
     include an Internet or FidoNet email address, we can use it to
     notify you of updates rather than using traditional mail.

OTHER

     The driver takes advantage of Stylus Color features not present

DESCRIPTION

    The FARM proudly presents the PD (Public Domain/Playable

    ROKETZ is AGA only gravity/thrust game. If you haven't played
    games like TurboRaketti or Gravity Force 2, here is a little
    something about the goal of the game:

      After equipping your ROKET with various weapons and upgrades,
    you are transported to a battleground, where you can race the
    marked track for best results and/or shoot down your opponent,
    which can be either your friend (split screen action) or CPU
    controlled adversary. The one to survive is the winner. 

      The battleground has different obstacles:
    gun turrets, pulsating forcefields etc. not to mention the
    gravitational force, that is constantly dragging you down.

    Now some features:
       Fully ray-traced ingame graphics 
       Two or one (even zero - CPU vs CPU) player mode
       Furious split-screen action.
       Realistic playing environment
       2 user configurable ships (4 in full version)
       Dozens of deadly weapons and useful special powers
       Statistics, that keep count of everything

==                        UUDecoding Amiga Report                        ==
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

==                Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users                 ==
===========================================================================

                The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
          -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-
service online SIG (Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users.

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in various ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA area banks of high-speed modems (you pay for the
phone call if it's not local), or though any SprintNet indial anywhere in
the USA, (with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell account.  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help and you can easily customize
it for your terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1000 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
      once, of any size, with one command.
 * Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, Elastic
      Reality (ASDG), Soft-Logik, Apex Publishing, and others.
 * 38 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 10,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.
 * Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
      related and get quick replies from the experts.
 * Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, EGS, Picasso,
      OpalVision & others feed right into the Zone message bases.  Read
      months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with them.
 * FREE unlimited Internet Email with 5 meg of free storage.
 * A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.
 * Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which you can read
      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine.
 * Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
      never worry "Ooops... Am I paying for this area?" again!
 * The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)  An 
      entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  And you get FREE unlimited
      usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
      email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
 * Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
      at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
