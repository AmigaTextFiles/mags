    ----------------------


Remember a few weeks ago when I lamented the lack of some serious business
software for the Amiga?  Well, much to my surprise, there are no fewer than
FOUR point-of-sale systems for the Amiga!  I received a letter from Mr. Joe
Rothman, pointing out that The Accountant, Best Business Systems, Service
Industry Accounting, and Retail Escort are all very good POS packages.  In
fact, I hope to print a review of Retail Escort in a future issue.  Many
thanks to Mr. Rothman for this information!

Speaking of letters, I received a letter from a (what's the word?), um, 
less-than-pleased reader of Amiga Report.  He had received the issue on
one of Amiga Animation Magazine's cover disk, and thought we were res-
ponsible for compiling those disks.  We are not affiliated with any other
Amiga publication, any online service, or any "company" other than STR
Publishing.  We are an independent, not-for-profit magazine run for the
benefit of the Amiga Community.

With that said, I would like to point out that in our Copyright Section,
found at the end of each magazine, it strictly states that Amiga Report
cannot be distributed by for-profit oranizations, which include magazine
cover disks.  We have not been contacted about permission to include our
magazine on Amiga Animation Magazine's cover disks, and we do not authorize
it.  If you read Amiga Animation Magazine and find any issues after Amiga
Report #1.16 on their cover disk, or any magazine cover disk, please send
me Email with the name and date of the publication, and the phone number
and address to the editorial office.  The ONLY charge anyone should expect
to pay to receive Amiga Report are charges from whatever online service
they call to download the issue, and/or any long distance telephone
charges.  It's not that I don't want the magazine on their disks, just that
I want their readers to know that we are not affiliated with that magazine.

More good news -- we have just received the newest release of VirusZ,
version 3.08.  This program will now kill the dreaded F**K virus, that
monster revlealed a few issues ago.  Look for this program soon on a
BBS near you!

With that out of the way, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the hard
work that my staff and various contributors have done for Amiga Report.
We're now into the seventeenth issue, and without you guys, we wouldn't
exist!  You guys are doing a great job!  Extra thanks go to one of our
Technical Editors, Mr. Robert Niles, for the new AmigaGuide format.  Thanks
to him, I might even figure out how to setup documents in AmigaGuide!

SECOND ROUND APPLE PRICE CUTS ON QUADRA, SERVER, POWERBOOK

CAMPBELL, CALIFORNIA -- Apple Computer is again announcing price cuts of
29 to 24 percent on its Macintosh Quadra, Apple Workgroup Server, and
Powerbook notebook computer line. The company is also offering rebates of
$100 to $200 on selected products in its Performa computer line.

The Macintosh Quadra 950 systems have been reduced up to 29 percent,
the Apple Workgroup Server 95 computers have been reduced up to 20
percent, and the Powerbooks have come down 7 percent to 34 percent.
The company has set up toll-free lines to answer consumer questions
about pricing and availability.

This is the second round of price cuts Apple has announced in less
than a month. In June, Apple announced price reductions selected
Macintosh Centris 610 models, Macintosh IIvx models, Powerbook 180s,
Apple Onescanners, and the Applecds compact disc read-only memory
(CD-ROM) drives.

Turmoil at Apple has been in the headlines. The company lost its
lawsuit against Microsoft over Windows, replaced its chief executive
officer (CEO) John Sculley with chief operating officer (COO)
Michael Spindler, who promptly announced lay offs of 2,500
employees, has frozen employee wages while cutting the pay of top
management, and there have been hints Apple is for sale.

Bob Puette, president of Apple USA said concerning the current round
of price cuts: "The price reductions, and the Performa rebates, are
part of our overall company strategy to take aggressive actions in
order to increase our market share."

Apple said it expects lower earnings for this half of the year and
industry analysts say pricing pressures from the IBM and compatible
personal computer (PC) market coupled with the success of Microsoft
Windows are the cause. The company's earnings statement is on track
for release the middle of this month, company officials added.


                      ------------------------------


APPLE SALARY CUTS AND FREEZES, EARNINGS AWAITED

CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA -- Apple Computer representatives have confirmed
reports that the company has frozen all employees salaries, except top
management, who will receive a five percent pay cut. This
announcement was made to company employees on Monday when Apple
announced a reorganization that included cutting of 2,500, or
about 15 percent, of its workforce.

The company has been in turmoil beginning early last month with
hints that it was for sale from Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
John Sculley. Sculley stepped down as CEO later in June to
become the company's traveling search-light for new technology
opportunities. But now there are hints Sculley will not return
to Apple when his sabbatical ends in August.

Analysts say intense pressure from the IBM and compatible
personal computer industry, in the form of the graphical
Microsoft Windows 3.1 and the PC price wars, is what is
squeezing Apple. June was also the month Apple officially lost
the suit it brought for $5.5 billion against Microsoft over the
Windows user interface. Apple did say it plans to appeal, but
no word of any further action has been forthcoming.

In June, Apple said stockholders could expect lower earnings
for the second half of its current fiscal year due to profit-
cutting price wars. Apple's stock has dropped one-third in
value overall since the beginning of the year. Many analysts,
however, including those at California Technology Stock Letter,
are seeing Apple's stock drop as an opportunity for investors.
Confidence in the company is high, they say, and they are
urging their readers to buy as much of the stock as they can.

The wait now is for the company's second quarter earnings
statement, which company officials say is on track for about
the 15th of this month.

SANYO SUFFERS 12.5-BILLION YEN LOSS

TOKYO, JAPAN -- Sanyo Electric recorded a major sales slump in May. The
loss is estimated around 12.5 billion yen ($114 million), and is expected
to grow to 20 billion yen ($180 million) by November.

Sanyo Electric's mid-term 1993 sales were 500 billion yen ($4.5
billion), which was down 9 percent from the same term last year.
Air conditioners, VCRs, and audio visual equipment did not
sell well and sales of these products were 5 to 8 percent
lower from the previous year.

Another reason for Sanyo's sales loss was the rapid appreciation of
the Japanese yen. The yen went up by about 20 yen (20 cents) over
the previous year, causing Sanyo a sales loss overseas.

Sanyo has sold equity to save 8 billion yen ($70 million)
but the loss was bigger than expected.

The firm has been trying to reduce expenses and labor costs
in order to ride out this situation. It will cut 3,000
employees by the end of 1995 and has switched to cheaper
overseas manufacturing.

LOW-VOLTAGE CMOS CHIP ALLIANCE

WASHINGTON, DC -- National Semiconductor, Toshiba, and Motorola have
jointly announced plans to form an alliance to produce the next
generation of low voltage CMOS or complimentary metal oxide semiconductor
microchips for laptop computers.

The goal of the alliance is to jointly develop electrical and
physical compatibility standards.

The new three-volt microchips are intended for use in both high-
performance "green" (environmentally friendly) desktop computers
and workstations where heat generation is a constant problem, and
in laptop, notebook, and palmtop computers which used to operate
at the five-volt standard, but are rapidly moving to the lower
power-consumption and lighter batteries possible when using
three-volt components.

The projected market for low voltage logic chips is $500 per year
by 1997, according to information supplied by the companies.

FIRST COMDEX/CANADA OPENS IN TORONTO

TORONTO, ONTARIO, CANADA -- The first COMDEX/Canada show and conference
started its three-day run today at the Metropolitan Toronto Convention
Centre.

An edition of the huge COMDEX show whose fall version dominates the
computer trade show calendar in the United States, COMDEX/Canada is
already a major event on the Canadian scene. Its main competition
will be the Canadian Computer Show, an established event that takes
place each fall in Mississauga, Ontario, a Toronto suburb.

Some in the industry speculate that the marketing might of the
US-based Interface Group, which runs COMDEX, could threaten the
venerable Canadian Computer Show.

The Interface Group claimed more than 300 exhibitors and projected
some 20,000 attendees at COMDEX/Canada this year. That is up
significantly from last year's total of about 120 exhibitors and
roughly 9,500 visitors at the PC Expo and LAN Expo shows that
Interface Group combined to create COMDEX/Canada.

It is still small, however, compared to the Las Vegas COMDEX, which
attracts more than 100,000 exhibitors most years.

In his introductory remarks, a pep talk that has become standard
fare at COMDEX shows, Interface Group Chairman Sheldon Adelson said
his company plans to launch further international COMDEX shows, in
Europe and the Pacific Rim, quite soon. At present the only other
COMDEX outside the United States is in Brazil.

The company has previously run COMDEX shows in Europe and Japan,
but dropped them.


                      ------------------------------


BIGGEST EVER CARD CRIME IN TAIWAN CAUSES ALARM

TAIPEI, TAIWAN -- Taiwan's biggest electronic financial crime ever has
revealed a number of weaknesses within the island's financial industry
and led to intensified calls for more secure financial facilities.

Cheng Chin-lung, a 34-year-old programmer who developed computer
programs for five financial institutions' ATM networks in Taiwan, is
alleged to have used his inside knowledge to hack the networks to
produce a total of 7,174 forged cards from 64 card issuers.

The losses involved are unknown, but officials have frozen US$1.9
million "petty cash" in Chin-lung's current account, as well as a
similar amount in his sister-in-law Hsiao Mei-yun's account.

Cheng was a software programmer with Universal Electronics and
Computer (UE&C) between 1989 and 1992. He was also in charge of the
company's hardware maintenance operations during that period.

According to officials with UE&C, Cheng is alleged to have acquired
all the ATM card numbers and their associated PINs which were used
during October of last year.

Officials say that the fraud has brought a number of potential
problem areas to light, primarily the contracting out of computer
programming work to outside companies by local banks.

The problem cannot be solved overnight. According to the Ministry of
Finance, only about 30 percent of all local financial institutions
have the expertise and resources required to design computer
programs themselves; the rest entrust programming either partly or
completely to external companies.

On the Taiwanese ATM system, which is thought to be similar to
systems used in the US and Europe, when a card is inserted into a
cash machine and its PIN entered, the PIN is validated by decoding
the PIN and account details recorded on the card's magnetic stripe.

If the details are incorrect, the card is retained. Only if the PIN
is validated are the details of the transaction, together with the
PIN, transferred over a secure data line to the Taiwanese Financial
Information System Centre (FISC). Data transferred between the ATM
and FISC is scrambled.

Experts are suggesting that Cheng intercepted the data streaming
into the FISC, but after the data had been unscrambled. Banking
officials claim that in the absence of a confession from Cheng,
they cannot discover at what point he intercepted the card and PIN
data, nor how he did it.

As a result of the fraud, the Taiwanese Ministry of Finance has
requested all card issuers in the country to re-issue new cards to
their cardholders, and add special verification codes to the
magnetic stripe on the cards. While this will prevent Cheng's
information from being used again, it may not stop the fraud from
happening again if the data stream is intercepted at the FISC.

The Ministry of Finance has also taken the unusual step of
requesting that card issuers revise their conditions of use to
take account of a fraud occurring in their own operation and admit
liability for any losses, as well as provide compensation in such
cases. Experts suggest that this precedent could result in similar
variations in agreements on a world-wide basis.

Taiwanese card issuers have also stated they intend to greatly
accelerate the speed with which they plan to transfer to smart card
technology with their ATM cards. The card issuers are currently
working with Bull Taiwan on developing a smart ATM and credit card
for issue some time next year.


                      ------------------------------


COMDEX/CANADA FEATURES MULTIMEDIA KEYNOTE

TORONTO, ONTARIO -- Multimedia technology has real applications in areas
such as desktop videoconferencing, news distribution, and various kinds
of retailing, Robert Carberry, president of IBM's Fireworks Partners,
told a large audience at the opening of the first COMDEX/Canada show and
conference.

"The applications of multimedia technology are not a Field of
Dreams -- build it and they will come," Carberry said, referring to
a widely quoted line from a popular American movie -- "but you can
apply it to very real business problems today."

Carberry illustrated his points with video clips, some of which
were reminiscent of Apple Computer Chairman John Sculley's
Knowledge Navigator video, a staple of trade show keynotes, and
press conferences.

He showed an executive using a personal computer to conduct a
desktop videoconference with a colleague, sending and receiving
electronic mail from a personal digital assistant in an airport,
and checking news and travel information on a screen in an airplane
seat back.

The screen in the airplane seat back is a limited reality today, he
said: IBM has already installed "flying local-area networks" in six
commercial jets.

Carberry also pointed out that with telecommunication networks now
acquiring the ability to transmit data at 1.5 megabits per second
-- the same speed at which data can be retrieved from a compact disc
read-only memory (CD-ROM) -- new openings for real-time information
delivery are appearing.

He cited as an example the creation of audio compact discs on
demand, using writable CD technology. IBM is already involved in a
pilot project with an audio retailer. This system would let a music
store download any title a customer wanted from a central server,
making available more titles than the store could keep in stock
physically.

Video on demand, making movies available to the home when you want
to watch them, is another possibility, Carberry said.

Fireworks Partners is investing in a variety of such areas,
including multimedia content creation, distribution, implementation
services, and retail applications, he said.

Launched in January, Fireworks Partners took in IBM's multimedia
systems and integration business, its Person-to-Person
multimedia videoconferencing group, and its Atlanta-based
Multimedia Publishing Studio.

The company, a unit of IBM's Personal Systems business, is
responsible for worldwide marketing of IBM multimedia products and
services. It will also back promising multimedia development by
entrepreneurs outside IBM, and form joint ventures with other
companies, officials said.

AMINET LIBRARY NOW ON CD-ROM


The Amiga Aminet archive is available now on CDROM.  The disc contains the
entire Aminet from amiga.physik.unizh.ch as of mid-May 1993.  It also contains
the old AB20 archive and most of comp.sources.amiga and comp.binaries.amiga.
We had to leave off some of the older comp.binaries.amiga files because the
disc was too full.  There is a total of 650 meg of stuff on this disc.

The disc is in Level-2 ISO-9660, which means that filenames are up to
32 characters, single case.  We made sure the filenames are unique in
the first 8 chars, so this disc will work okay MSDOS too.  The disc has
index files for several MSDOS BBS's.

The disc contains thousands of programs, including utilities, games,
development tools, graphics, business software, hardware documents,
sound and music programs, and much more.  If you want to check out what
is on this disc, the readme and index files are available via anonymous
ftp from cdrom.com in the directory /cdrom/cdroms/aminet.

ACE BASIC COMPILER V1.1A AVAILABLE FOR FTP


TITLE

	ACE  -  Amiga BASIC Compiler with Extras. 

VERSION

	v1.1a        

COMPANY

	Private developer.

AUTHOR

	David Benn
	Usenet: dbenn@leven.appcomp.utas.edu.au

DESCRIPTION

ACE is a PD Amiga BASIC compiler which, in conjunction with A68K and Blink
produces standalone executables. No special run-time shared libraries are 
required.
 
The language is a large subset of AmigaBASIC but also has many extra features
not found in the latter such as: turtle graphics, recursion, SUBs with return
values, structures, arguments, include files, a better WAVE command which 
allows for large waveforms, external references, named constants and several
extra functions.

In total, ACE currently supports some 150 commands and functions. 

ACE is still under development, but is quite usable in its present form.

NEW FEATURES AND BUG FIXES

New features since v1.02 include CHDIR, FILES, SLEEP, SWAP and ALLOC. The 
latter is a hassle-free memory allocator. ACE automatically frees all 
memory allocated via ALLOC even if a program aborts due to an error or after 
a user break (ctrl-c).

An ADDRESS data type has been added, ARG$(0) now returns the executable's name,
string arrays can have element size specified and inline assembly code is now
supported. The OPTION command allows compiler directives to be set/reset    
in a program. 

Bug fixes involved CLOSE, CLS, BIN$, OCT$ and some string functions. The 
latter were overwriting a shared buffer in some cases. 

See docs/history and readme.first in the ACE archive for details on these
and other changes. 

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	ACE has been tested on machines ranging from an A1000 running Wb 1.3
	with 512K of RAM to a 68030 machine running Wb 3.0 with 5M of RAM. 	

	For moderately large programs to compile however, 1M is required.

	I run ACE on an unaccelerated A500 with 3M of RAM and a 52M 
	hard drive under Wb 2.04.

   ask nicely.  AniMan is multitasking and runs in the foreground or
   background, listening for your voice commands even while other programs
   may be running.

NEW FEATURES

   This final version of AniMan incorporates improvements requested by many
   users.  Full advantage is taken of AGA animation capabilities.  Menu
   operations have been improved.  Documentation is provided in AmigaGuide

About the author . . .

        Dr. Marrs has been the author of monthly articles on ARexx in the
Northwest Amiga Journal ("ARexx: REXX for the Amiga") for the last year and
a half and has conducted classes on beginning and intermediate ARexx. It is
from these that he began to shape the content of this book.

        In a research career in semiconductor materials and processes, he
has used computers of all genera and many species. Starting with scientific
programs written in FORTRAN on ancient mainframes, he has also programmed
in BASIC, FORTH, C and Modula-2. Interested in programming languages in
general, he became intrigued by ARexx when it was introduced by Bill Hawes
around 1987.  He began to weave the operation of everything on his Amiga
together with ARexx and developed an appreciation for the programming
environment it represents.

        In writing programs of increasing complexity, he discovered many of
the subtle characteristics that the simple syntax of the REXX language
belies.  Developing the foundation of the language and enhancing it with
attention to subtlety and detail, this book makes writing simple programs
with some elegance more accessible.

FASTCACHE V1.0 AVAILABLE FOR FTP


TITLE

	FastCache

VERSION

	1.0

AUTHOR

	Philip D'Ath	(pid@waikato.ac.nz)

DESCRIPTION

	FastCache is a fully associative hard drive caching program.  It
	increases the performance of hard drives.

	Following is an extract of the features from the manual.
               * Fully associative cache (one of the best algorithms)
               * LRU cache replacement policy (one of the best)
               * Can handle multiple drives
               * *Should* be able to handle removable media
               * All cache settings are determined at run time
               * Optional write retention
               * Does not require large continuous chunks of memory
               * Uses a hashing system to locate data (one of the best)
               * Performs both forward and reverse prefetching
               * Will utilize the blitter to move data, if possible

               I have spared little effort in writing FastCache.  It uses some
          of the best algorithms (and more often than not, most complex
          algorithms) for nearly everything.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	KS2.0 preferred and supported, although appears to work under
	KS1.3.  Minimum of 256K of memory required, but the cache will be
	strangled (and a fast processor will be required).  512K of memory
	or better is recommended.  The more memory the better.
	Special versions are supplied for 68000 and 68030 processors.
	And of course, some form of drive that supports seeking is
	required.

HOST NAME

	ftp.th-darmstadt.de and other AMINET sites

DIRECTORY

	/pub/aminet/disk/cache

FILE NAMES

	fcache10.lha

PRICE

	$US20, $A20 or $NZ20.  Payment will be accepted by cheque
	in one of the nominated currencies.  The US and Australian
	prices may appear artificially inflated compared to the New
	Zealand price.  This is to cover the exchange costs of
	converting it to $NZ, and possible communications.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

	This software is distributed under the shareware concept.  The
	prospective owner is granted a 3 month trial period to evaluate
	the software.  FastCache is (c) 1992 by Philip D'Ath.

DESCRIPTION

     Textra is the User-Friendly text editor for the Amiga.
     It contains a fully-Intuitionized GUI as well as an
     ARexx interface with 50+ commands.  The package
     interfaces with the WB2.0+ asl font requester,
     supports multiple windows with cut, copy and paste
     between them.  Undo and Drag-select with left mouse
     button, background printing and ARexx script exec-
     ution, user-settable preferences which can be saved,
     all supported.  The editor displays fast text and
     continuous-movement vertical and horizontal scroll bars.

     The package contains full, detailed documentation,
     30+ Arexx scripts (including an interactive tutorial)
     and a hard disk installer program.

     Scripts are provided to integrate Textra with
     JForth Professional 3.x, HSPascal and Paul Kienitz's
     Q-Blue Offline Mail Reader program.

NEW FEATURES

     Textra 1.14 sports a status line indicating current
     cursor position or select range location.  The ARexx
     requester is improved, allowing 10 strings, utilizes
     additional function keys for single-key launching.
     All alphabetic keys, as well as the HELP key, are now
     user-configurable; each may be bound to any Textra script
     or internal Textra command via the CTRL key.  Double-
     clicking any ( ) < > [ ] { } character locates the
     balancing character (forward searches conducted for
     balancing double-quote characters).  User-definable

TITLE

   Voice Command Line Interface (VCLI).

VERSION

   Version 7.0

AUTHOR

   Richard Horne (RHorne@cup.portal.com).  Comments or questions welcome.

DESCRIPTION

   This is the final version (7.0) of Voice Command Line Interface (VCLI)
   which will execute CLI commands, ARexx commands, or ARexx scripts by
   voice command.  VCLI allows you to launch multiple applications or
   control any program with an ARexx capability entirely by spoken voice
   command.  VCLI is multitasking and will run in the background, listening
   for your voice command even while other programs may be running.

NEW FEATURES

   Many improvements requested by users have now been incorporated.  VCLI
   now has its own ARexx port so that its internal functions and options
   can be controlled by ARexx command.  Menu operations have been improved.
   Documentation is provided in AmigaGuide format.  This is the fastest
   version of VCLI yet, and it fully supports DSS 8, Perfect Sound 3, Sound
   Magic (Sound Master), and Generic audio digitizers.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

   VCLI 7.0 requires AmigaDOS 2.0 or higher.  An audio digitizer is also
   required (DSS 8, Perfect Sound 3, Sound Magic or a generic digitizer).

HOST NAME

   VCLI 7.0 is available via FTP at all Aminet sites, such as
   ftp.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4).

DIRECTORY/FILE NAME

   VCLI 7.0 is located at pub/aminet/util/misc as VCLI70.lha.

16511 10-JUL 02:17 General Information
     A4000, Bridgeboards, Etc.
     From: LINDQUIST    To: ALL

I am thinking about selling my A1200 and PC clones and integrating
everything into a 4000/030 box.  Needless, to say, I have quite a few
questions...

1.  How are the drive bays arranged in the 4000.  If I ditch my 386-PC,
    I will be pulling my High Density 5.25" and 212 Meg Western Digital
    4200 (FH 3.5") for use from a bridgeboard.  Can I fit my FH 3.5 drive
    where the factory drive is normally, and put the factory drive in the
    second floppy spot?

2.  How's my slot arrangement for Bridging?  I plan to install a Diamond
    Stealth VRAM card in a bridge slot, as well as any controllers that I
    may need.

3.  Is it true what I here that the Commodore 386 bridgeboard won't let you
    use the Amiga Serial/Par ports?

4.  Will I have any problems mounting a stock Teac 5.25 High Density in a
    4000 and running it through the standard Amiga floppy cable?  Can I use
    this drive on the Amiga side too (CrossDos)?

5.  If I hook my already formated and partitioned IDE hard drive to the 4000
    IDE connector will it recognize my DOS partitions for the Bridgeboard
    intact, or will I have to put on a bridge-side (PC) IDE controller to
    do this?

6.  How difficult is the Commodore 386 bridgeboard to install?  I have heard
    some not too good comments about it installation wise.  I build and
    repair generic clones as part of my job, are all of the jumpers
    associated with customizing PC-Oriented functions or making it coexist
    with the Amiga half of the box?  If it's all just PC oriented stuff, no
    prob, otherwise..

7.  I understand that If I use any of my 3 Zorro Slots that I can't use one
    of the PC slots (March AW).  Where does the bridge board plug into
    exactly?  Somebody once told me that it took one of your Zorro and one
    of your ISA slots, is this true?  If so, wouldn't using the Zorro slot
    invalidate one of your ISA slots, use one of them, and then leave with
    just one left?

8.  I plan on adding an Emplant board eventually, does anyone know of any
    incompattibilities between this and a bridge card?

9.  What type of Memory does the Commodore 386 card take?  I have a whole
    boatload of 1x9 SIMM's in my pc (8 megs worth), can I transplant these
   on over?

Thanx in advance.  Erik Lindquist.


A resonse to his questions...


16512 10-JUL 02:37 General Information
     RE: A4000, Bridgeboards, Etc. (Re: Msg 16511)
     From: SPKENNEDY    To: LINDQUIST (NR)

 The 386 BB is really not that difficult to install, I hate hardware
installation and it only took me about an hour to completely install.

It is true that the 386 BB does not allow you to use the Amiga Ser/Par but
a serial/par card is really inexpensive for the IBM. You can even get them
with VGA and IDE controllers.

The BB takes 256x4 or 1x4 Page Mode Zip rams -- so your 1x9 simms will not
work. Basicly you have to buy BB ram from you C= dealer.  The BB is a full
card - It stretches from one Zorro Slot all the way over 1 AT slot. In the
3000 it does not block off any slots although my VGA card did.

Subj: Re: Terminus!!!


        I just recently tried Terminus 2.0 out and I must say while I like
some the new features a lot, I STILL MUCH prefer Term 3.3 overall.  And the
really GREAT thing about Term is that it is updated practically every other
month...not once in TWO YEARS.  Ok, that wasn't really fair since Terminus is
a complete rewrite but still that was a LONG wait for JrComm users.



    A FEW features that really makes Term shine that TERMINUS doesn't have:

        * Ability to use ANY Amiga Screen Resolution.
        * Unlimited # of numbers per entry for same system in Phone Book
        * Ability to assign 8svx sounds to many functions.
        * Ability to use Amiga Voice synthesis for important notices.
        * QuickDial menu
        * Ability to Remap translation tables.
        * FAST!Macros to use mouse on any system.
        * External Emulation libraries.
        * MUCH Better 'xfer window.
        * No $40 fee.

        These are just a few reasons I thought of off the top of my head for
erasing Terminus the same day I tried it out.  And it wasn't just because it
costs $40 to register...Several of the features above I wouldn't want to do
without, notably the screen resolutions (for better Retina compatibility among
other things) and the sound and voice selections, which really make Term an
interesting terminal program.  This isn't to say Jack's program isn't a great
terminal program...just that I would suggest for everyone to really compare
the two before rushing in to register Terminus.  I can see why 68000 users
would prefer Terminus though, but other than that....

Subj: Good News

I just wanted to post some positive information; so many posts are doom and
gloom.

The Amiga reseller that I work at here in Huntsville is doing very well.  We
are selling significantly MORE Amigas this year than last year. MOST of them
are Amiga 4000/040.  We have sold many more A4000s than A1200s.  Many of
these A4000 purchases are by people/companies who have never owned an Amiga.  
They bought them for the Video Toaster 4000 or for other graphic applications.

  I don't know if it is actually 3.5 times faster but the floating point
processor in the 68040 is significantly faster then that of the 80486.
Here is a few entries from an extensive benchmarks list I got a copy of not
to long ago...(the benchmark was for floating point transcendental
functions)

 Cray Y-MP C90                      Unicos         cc              0.55

  Just had to stick the SGI and Cray on there!  Anyway, this is a partial
listing from a larger post which (I believe) was originaly off the
internet.  As you can see, in this test which is makes heavy use of
transcendental math (did something like 200,000 sine values and multiplied
them together) the A4000 (a 25Mhz 68040) outpreformed a 66Mhz 80486DX2 but
just barely.  Thats impressive if you consider the difference in clock
rate!  The 486 was more than double the clock rate!  In addition, as I
understand it, the A4000 does not support burst to/from its memory which
may or may not have slowed the 68040 in this test.
  Now if you were to compare a 33Mhz 68040 to the 66Mhz 80486DX2 you would
see an even bigger gap!  The reason for the difference in speed is simply
that the FPU design in the 68040 is simply more efficient then that of the
486.  As I understand, Intel had greatly improved the FPU preformance in
the Pentium.  I wonder if Motorola has made improvements to their FPU for
the 68060???  At any rate, I have similar benchmarks from other sources
that report similar findings...

Hey Amiga Users out there !

To stop all senseless dicussions about technical details or pricing of the
new  'Amiga 32 CD console', here are pure, confirmed facts.

They are truely from Dr. Peter Kittel, C= Germany.
If you don't believe me, take a good look into 'de.comp.sys.amiga.misc'.
This is where his posting is from.

Now, for all who have major problems with German or who unfortunately
don't  have access to this newsgroup, I put his posting into these
newsgroups,  adding some translations.
As I'm not a master of English (and as I don't have my dictionaries with

/// Emplant Update!
    ---------------


 A message received from Jim Drew...

 
 Updated June 26th, 1993


 EMPLANT received class B FCC verification August 24th, 1992.

 Information reguarding the product "EMPLANT" from Utilities Unlimited,
 Inc.  This information is freely re-distributable and may be used in any
 form as long as the contents are not altered.

 What is EMPLANT?
 ----------------

 EMPLANT is a hardware/software product that is designed to allow the
 emulation of virtually any computer using the Amiga.  A simple software
 driver and ROM(s) from the computer to emulated are all that is required.
 Features and software compatibility will depend on the software driver.


 About the hardware
 ------------------

 The hardware holds the key to emulation speed.  Every effort was made to
 make the hardware virsatile enough that we should never have to upgrade
 it to handle the emulation of forth comming computer systems.  For this 
 reason, we have included components that may never be used, however, 
 this does insure the fact that we are prepared for the future.  

 The MAC series of computers, although different from one another, share
 the same basic technology.  We can replicate this technology by emulating
 the MAC's custom chips through a reliable hardware system.  All timers,
 interrupts, and clocks are handled on a hardware level so that speed is
 identical (or even faster) than the real computer being emulated.

 Support for custom EPROMs, static RAM, and SIMM modules makes our hardware
 compatible with all existing methods of storing a computer's operating
 system.  This versatility also allows us to create adapter boards if some
 new method of OS storage becomes available.  The EMPLANT hardware has four
 empty 32 pin ROM/RAM sockets provided for use with operating systems that
 are stored in DIP format (such as 128K MAC+ ROMs are).  These sockets
 can also be used to store your own utility software in EPROM format.  We
 plan to release a utility package that will be literally "at your
 fingertips".  Another option is to fill the four sockets with static
 RAMs, giving you up to 2 megs of extra RAM that you could write protect and
 make auto-booting, which would be handy for floppy-only customers.

 The hardware comes in two forms: a plug in card that occupies one of the
 Zoro II/III slots on your A2000/2500/3000, and a plug in card that fits on
 the expansion bus on your A500/1000.  For the A500/1000 version, there is
 a pass-thru that allows you to plug in your existing equipment.

 The Apple Nu-Bus expansion ports are not emulated through hardware because
 they are now RAM-based device drivers which operate faster than a MAC's own
 hardware.  We will be producing NuBus adapter sockets that allow the
 use of standard MAC NuBus products to work in a Zoro II/III slot.



 HIGH SPEED MAC SERIAL PORTS/APPLE TALK SUPPORT

 The MAC serial port is not emulated, it is duplicated - using the exact same
 standard dual high speed serial interface IC.  Apple Talk is completely
 supported through this port like the MAC, via a 8 pin mini-din connector.
 This dual high speed serial port can be used on the Amiga side as well,
 allowing the connection of two serial devices operating independantly.
 Communication speed on these ports are a maximum of 230.4K baud, which is
 the speed at which Apple Talk runs.  Maximum modem speed is generally
 limited to 57.6K baud.


 SCSI INTERFACE

 A simple, autobooting SCSI controller using NCR53C80 high speed
 controller IC.  Capable of pseudo-DMA transfers up to 1.1 megs per second.
 Support for up to 7 SCSI devices including CD ROMs, tape backup units,
 and hand scanners.  This SCSI interface can be used on both the Amiga
 side and the MAC side, independantly or simotaneously.



 About the MAC II emulation software
 ------------------------------------

 FULL COLOR, MULTITASKING, MAC II EMULATION! 

 Up to 16 colors can be displayed using the standard OCS/ECS Amiga video
 output, and up to 256 colors can be displayed when using an AGA capable
 machine.

 Full color can also be emulated with various 8bit and 24bit video boards.
 Support for the Retina video board allows up to 16 million colors to be
 displayed!!  We are current working on other video drivers for boards such
 as: Merlin, Resolver, Domino, Rainbow and others!  

 ALL emulation modules created for the EMPLANT system will share one
 very important feature...they will multitask with the Amiga's
 environment.  That's right, just pull down the MAC screen, or flip to the
 back with LEFT-AMIGA-M/N and you still have complete access to your
 Amiga! ...and the MAC stays running at full speed!  Speaking of speed,
 a 25Mhz A3000 runs the emulation at exactly twice the speed of a *real*
 MAC IIx computer!

 The MAC IIx emulator software is relatively simple since the majority of
 the emulation is done on a hardware level, giving both better compatibility
 and equally important, emulation speed.

 The software reads the MAC ROM SIMM module that is installed on the EMPLANT
 board, dumps the ROM image into a block of memory, and patches the image
 to run on your Amiga.  One intelligent move on the part of Apple was to
 define "global" variables for their operating system.  This makes it
 relatively simple to move the code around without a lot of hassles.
 Since the MAC IIx is a 68030 based machine, it has a AMU or PMMU to map
 memory into various locations.  Using a 68020/30/40 with an MMU allows
 virtually 100% compatibility when running MAC software on the emulator.
 Another big advantage of having a MMU is the tremendous speed increase
 of the video display drivers.  The MAC's video data is in 'CHUNKY'
 format, and the Amiga's video data is in 'PLANAR' format.  These two
 formats are completely different, so the emulation converts the MAC's
 video data into data that the Amiga's display hardware can use....all
 in real time, thanks to the MMU.  

 Support for virtually ANY SCSI device such as hand scanners, Ethernet
 cartridges, hard drives, SyQuest units, Magneto-Optical units,
 DATs, film recorders, CD-ROMs, etc. is provided via the EMPLANT's
 SCSI port.  You can also use AmigaDOS formatted devices (which
 become MAC formatted by the emulation).  Amiga devices such as
 hard drive partitions, recoverable RAM drives (RD0, RAD, VD0, etc.),
 and MS-DOS partitions can all be used under the emulation.  Up to
 14 different devices can be used at the same time.

 The MAC 400/800K disk format is emulated by using the already successful
 SYBIL hardware package.  High density (1.44mb) floppys are supported via
 the CBM 1.76mb drives.



 Future emulation
 ----------------

 Since the EMPLANT's hardware is so versatile, a completely new and 
 different computer can be emulated by just changing the emulation
 software patch and the ROM(s).  MAC QUADRA, Mega ST, and IBM AT
 (386/486) emulators are planned in the future.



 Price and availability
 ----------------------

 Current retail price for the basic EMPLANT system is $279 + shipping.

 Basic EMPLANT system with High speed serial ports/Apple Talk support
 is $349.00 + shipping.

 Basic EMPLANT system with high speed SCSI interface is $349.00 +
 shipping.

 Deluxe EMPLANT system with both high speed serial ports/Apple Talk
 support AND high speed SCSI interface is $399 + shipping.

 All EMPLANT packages described above come with the MAC IIx emulation
 software and necessary device drivers.

 The EMPLANT systems are shipping now, however, we are in a back order
 situation with shipment priority based on the order date.

/// Directory Utilities Great and Small
    -----------------------------------
    By Robert Niles


Simply put, moving large amounts of files around a hard drive can be,
well, a pain at times. Especially when you're doing it through the 
CLI. Even now with Commodore's 2.x (and higher) Workbench moving files 
(even those without icons) is certainly much easier. But sometimes 
even that isn't enough, you want to get the "big" picture.

Directory Utilities can make managing a harddrive and your files much 
easier. You can see ALL (for the most part) the files at once, pick 
out a group of them, to copy, delete, move, add comments, whatever. 
These "DU"s work better "ergonomically". Not only for management of 
files, most of these let you do other things as well. Press a button 
to load your favorite word processor, paint program, or even a game. 
Archive or Unarchive files with a few mouse clicks. View a picture by 
dobule-clicking on it. Same thing with sound samples, MODs, and whatever
else the authors of these programs place in your hands.

Which brings us to the many directory utilities out there. Most of you 
are familiar with OPUS, and DiskMaster which are on the commercial 
side of the market place, but there is a nice lot of these "DU"s to 
choose from on the PD and ShareWare side. We'll take a peek at these, 
and hopefully give you an idea of which ones would suit your needs, or 
maybe just to give you an idea of "why" you might want to use one.

I'll only be covering five of these programs here, but there are many 
more, with different features to comply with your tastes. The reviewed 
files below can be found on most @{"commercial online systems" link P4}, 
on many BBSes, or if you can't find them anywhere else they are 
available to download or to File REQuest on @{"In The MeanTime" link P2-1-2}
(The names of the files as they appear on "In The MeanTime are in 
parenthesis).

The first four can be used with OS 1.3 or higher.



DirWork v1.3 (DIRWORK.LZH), by Chris Hames

A very small DU at 42156 bytes. It features 56 buttons in which you 
can configure to do or run just about anything currently on your 
system. Has all the basic copy, delete, sound, show buttons, even does 
system and bootblock virus checking. The display gives you the WB2.0 
feel, and has a screen blanker to boot. A very good program, 
especially considering its size.



Click DOS II v1.10 (CLICKD2.LZH), by Gary Yates

Another small DU but without the bells and whistles that you find in 
alot of these programs. This one sticks with the basics (display pics, 
reads ASCII files, move, delete, copy files, etc. Seems to be written 
for those with limited memory reserves.



SID II (SID20.LHA), by Timm Martin

This is one of my personal favorites, mostly known since SID 1.06 it 
has been completely rewritten and works well with OS1.3 and higher. 
Customizable from the palette to the buttons. All all the basic 
functions as buttons. Great 2.0 style and feel. Has a shrink gadget 
for those times in which you want it "there" but out of the way. One 
of the best features is the PARENT gadget being along the side, just 
move to either side and click, very quick, and you don't have to hunt 
for the PARENT button. 



DOS Manager v1.0 (DOSMANGR.LZH), by Joergen Stohr

Nice clean look to this one...not cluttered with a wall of buttons. 
You have four buttons at the bottom in which you click on to reveal 
more options. The program has the basics (OK, they all do), and you 
have some buttons you can customize to your specific needs.



DAN v1.2 (DAN.LHA), by Danny Y. Wong

This DU can need OS2.x or higher. Sporting 45 user defined buttons, 
bytes, time, memory available, and the rest of the basics. Nice clean 
interface.




As you see alot of these have the same features but take a look at 
them because they all vary differently and some might suit your tastes 
more than others. Directory Utilities are probably the most used 
of all the utilities out there!

/// Send in the Clones!
    -------------------
    By Marcus J. Albers
    (malbers@ns.ccsn.edu)



           SEND IN THE CLONES PART 2:  I THINK I'M A CLONE NOW!

Last week, my article contained mini-reviews of some clones of arcade games
that are currently somewhere on the Net.  We looked at clones of Pac-Man
and Space Invaders, two classic arcade hits.  This week, let us look at
classics that gained fame in the home computer realm.
 
*** Boulder Dash ***
 
Anyone who had a Commodore 64 knows what Boulder Dash is.  For those of you
who lead deprived childhoods (or owned a PC), Boulder Dash could very well
be the Lemmings of the 1980's.  You control a little bug named Rockford
that is trapped in diamond mines.  You dig around the screen, collecting
the amount of diamonds needed to open the exit to the level, while trying
to avoid falling boulders, butterflies, slime-molds, and other deadly
characters.  I am sad to say that I have yet to complete the entire game,
but I keep on trying.  Boulder Dash spawned two sequels:  Boulder Dash II
and Rockford, as well as a Boulder Dash Construction set.  And now all you
people who sold your old 64's (I've still got mine) can have the fun again
on your Amiga.
 
Cave Runner
 
This is by far the most faithful translation of the classic.  The levels
even look suspiciously similar.  The only real difference is the fact that
the bug has been replaced with a Pac-Man type of character (no, he doesn't
eat up the dirt and diamonds).  I found this to be very entertaining
because the levels are so similar.  Most of my old strategies still work.
It was very much like having the old game right there.  One of the neat
little things that I liked about the original Boulder Dash that doesn't
appear in this version is that when ever you would leave Rockford sitting
doing nothing, he would turn to you, cross his arms, and start stamping his
foot in impatience.  I have yet to see that kind of behavior from the
character in Cave Runner, but it is a minor complaint, perhaps not even a
complaint.  It is a good game, none-the-less.
 
Mr. Brownstone
 
This has a general basis in the old Boulder Dash game.  This game has even
more of a puzzle element than the original, though.  The main objective
remains the same: collect the diamonds to open the exit.  But in this
version, the digging carefully to avoid falling boulders has been replaced
for the most part by opening doorways.  On the levels, there are switches
that can be utilized by the level to operate a number of doors on the level
depending on from which angle you touch the switch.  You use the switches
to open the doors on the level in the correct order to get to the diamonds
on the levels.  Careful for doors that are acting as "key-stones" keeping
a pile of boulders at bay.  This version is very addicting, and in some
ways better than the original.
 
By the way, both of these versions are in PAL mode.  I have yet to find a
Boulder Dash clone that is in NTSC Standard (sorry 1/2 meggers).
 
And I have heard from the author that there may be a demo release onto the
Net of a new version of Boulder Dash for the Amiga, sporting 32 colour
screens, many, MANY levels, support for loading in levels from other
Boulder Dash clones, and much, much more.  I don't know when, if it will,
be put on the Net, but I it materializes, you will hear about it here.
 
*** Omega Race ***
 
Although this classic appeared in the arcade, it gained fame as one of the
best games written for the ancient VIC-20 home computer.  I got to play it
on a demo model set up in a store a long, LONG time ago.  It compared quite
admirably with the arcade version (which remains one of my favourite arcade
games).  The arcade version also was one of the first sit down style games,
along with Star Wars and Turbo.
 
Amega Race
 
This is the one and only version that I have been able to find for the
Amiga (although I have heard another version is rumoured to be on the Net
somewhere).  And an excellent one it is, too.  The graphics are faithful
to the original, with the elegant wire-framed ships and the appearing
boundery markers.  Game play is extremely smooth, but I found the keyboard
controls to be backwards, at least in my mind.  Once you get over this
minor inconvenience, the game play is extremely rewarding.  Unfortunately
for people without PAL mode capabilities, Amega Race doesn't run on an
OCS Agnus chip Amiga.  The author states that he is not planning on
releasing an NTSC Standard version, because is would call for a lot of
redrawing of graphics so that it looked good.  Guess its time to get an
upgrade, eh?
 
*** Tetris ***
 
Who doesn't know about this game!  One of the hottest games in the history
of video games, it is also among the most cloned.  I have at least seven
different versions of the game, some very much like the original, others
somewhat different.  I'll give you a short rundown of the ones I have used.
 
Tetron
 
This is the best of the bunch.  It has options galour, it has a very slick
2.0-looking interface, and is very smooth all over.  It has an option that
I have yet to see in any other Amiga Tetris clone-a two player mode.  This
seems to be one of those games that gets about 200 times better when you
are competing against another person.  It has options for next piece
preview, fast or slow drop, and other things.  It also appears to be multi-
tasking friendly, although it seems to take up quite a chunk of my one
megabyte of memory.  The only draw back, again, is that this game only runs
in PAL mode.  It will run in NTSC mode, but all of the option gadgets are
located on the bottom of the screen, and are completely invisible when not
in PAL mode.  Otherwise, an excellent conversion.
 
Size-Tris
 
This is a nice little Tetris game that can easily be played while your
Amiga is doing something else (*only Amiga*).  This game appears in a small
window on the Workbench screen, and takes up very little memory.  The
screen size is completely arbitrary, and the game takes the shape of the
screen, i.e. you can have the high and thin screen like the classic game,
or you could size it to look like a fish tank.  The game pauses when the
screen is deactivated, and resumes upon reactivation of the window.  It
doesn't have many options, but is great for that night when you are down-
loading that one megabyte file at 1200 bps.
 
Columns
 
This semi-popular game is a clone of a clone.  The game Columns is based
on the basic theme behind Tetris, and was made popular by Sega when they
distributed it with they're Game Gear portable system.  The idea is similar
but the implementation is quite different.  You are presented with the
familiar empty well, but instead of different shaped pieces falling from
the sky, there are straight, multi-coloured pieces to deal with.  The
straight pieces consist of three verticle, multi-coloured blocks.  The
colours are rotated up and down the piece with a press of the action button
or key.  The object is to get three or more similar colours touching in
some way, whether it is vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.  The game is
nearly as addictive as Tetris, if not a bit more challenging, especially
on the faster levels.  Oh, yes.  This game is also quite multi-tasking
friendly, and doesn't take up much memory.
 
Next week, we wrap up this talk of clones with a look at clones of newer
games, including Street Fighter II (yes, there is one out there), and
Arkanoid.  See ya next week.

                                ESSENCE II


In August of 1992, Essence I was released for Imagine. Essence I is a set
of sixty-six algorithmic textures. These algorithmic textures add a new
dimension to working with Imagine. They range from Counter, which lets you
apply an image of an LCD display to an object, to Fractal Noise, a set of
textures which can be animated (i.e. swirling cloud cover for a planet
object). These algorithmic textures opened up a new realm of possibilities
with Imagine.

Now, nearly a year later, Apex has released Essence II. Actually, Essence 
II isn't in the stores yet. I talked with Steve Worley yesterday and he 
told me that right now Essence II is being offered to existing Essence I 
owners. Essence II will be in the stores in 2-3 weeks. Also, yes, Apex is 
looking at converting Essence II to Real 3-D format, and no, they are not 
planning a Lightwave version at the present time. This is because Lightwave
does not support external textures. So, just what is Essence II and how
does it differ from Essence I? 

I guess the best source of information is Apex itself. The lattest issue 
of the Apex newsletter is basically an announcement of Essence II along 
with a few other projects Apex is working on. I thought you might be 
interested in hearing about Essence from the person who developed it so 
I asked Steve if I could quote the Apex newsletter.


  "Many features in Essence Volume II are similar to Essence I. The
  textures work with Imagine .9 through 2.0, have built-in capabilities
  like fade control, the -1 color disabling feature, and built-in error
  messages....most of the textures now include a bump mapping ability...
  eighty percent of the textures have some sort of altitude effect built
  into them, as opposed to Essence I in which only about ten percent of
  the textures will bump-map. A second change was to decrease the use of
  obscure parameters like Amplitude ratio." 

  "Included with Essence Volume II are well over 100 attribute files which
  can immediately be applied to your objects. There's also a library of
  on-disk pictures of many of these [attribute files] so you won't have to
  render them to get an idea of what they look like."

  "While many of the Essence I textures were based on "fractal noise",
  Essence II has many textures with a different type of appearance, best 
  described as an organic, randomly-tiled surface. This type of texturing
  is literally, state 0f the art in 1993, with Apex being the first company
  to use this new type of texture basis. Nobody using an SGI or a PC or a
  Mac has these!... In a year you'll be seeing textures with this style
  being used by others, but right now Apex has the monopoly over these
  unique textures."


According to the newsletter, Essence II has several groups of theme
textures.  Some of these are:

Space Textures:

"Gasplanet, Planetring, Cyclone ("It makes a great Red Spot for Jupitor..."

Organic Textures:

"A set of 'organic' surfaces with altitude mapping which will let you make
everything from snak skin to parched, leather-like hide." 

I'm already trying to imagine (pun intended) what the CycleMan or Humanoid
objects would look like with a lizard-skin texture applied to them!

Bumpy Things:

Stucco, Pitted, Crumpled, Burnished

Water Effects:

Waterdrop, Raindrops, Seawaves, Caustics "The animated light patterns seen
on swimming pool walls"

Other Textures:

Radarscope, Fiber, Faceted, Bumparray, Clusterbump, Crust, Flagstones,
Fleck, Julia, Plasma, Polkabump, Scales, Shingles, Vein, Woodgrain to name
a few of the textures.

Apex describes Essence II as "The most powerful texturing algorithms
produced for any rendering platform" and from what I've seen I believe 
they are correct. Now if they will just convert Essence II to Real 3-D
format...

"Essence II requires Imagine and an Amiga with a FPU (such as a 68881 or a
68040 CPU)."

REVIEW

        As af player of war simulations with figurines as well as the old
SSI battle simulations on my Commodore 64, I have found a love for being
able to control a squad of warriors completely.  I can put them in
situations that no sane person would do, and just see what happens.  I
can do more than just run and shoot.  I can use a couple of warriors and put
them in the heat of battle to act as decoys as the rest of my men go rushing
into the complex and break the prisoners out.  And there are usually a
number of ways of accomplishing the given task.  When I read the
documentation for Act Of War, I knew that this was the game for me.

        Act Of War is a war simulation "in the tradition" of games like
Laser Squad and Rebelstar.  The player controls his/her squad of warriors,
which are faced with a situation and an objective.  In Act Of War, you are
able to play against either a computer opponent or a human enemy.  A lot of
strategy goes into the execution of any scenario.  It is not simply "fire
and forget."

        Play for each character is split up into a number of actions or
moves.  Each separate character has a number of actions available such as
movement, opening doors, or firing upon an enemy.  The characters take turns
making all of the moves.  This simulates real-time action, and can be used
to allow for things like injuries by decreasing the number of moves that the
injured character has.  Much realism can be figured into such a system, and
it is a completely fair system.  When firing takes place, both combatants
get an equal chance to fire; i.e., if a character fires upon an enemy during
his turn, the enemy gets to fire back, even though it is not technically his
turn.

        Act Of War is a completely open-ended simulation.  It could be said
that the game is simply a play system, around which the actual simulation is
built.  When the game is registered, you are sent a mission designer that
allows you to create graphics, types of characters, and types of weapons
that are used.  Everything can be changed.

        Another very nice thing about Act Of War is that all of the game
functions can be accessed either either from menus or by keyboard.  This is
nice for people who do not have easy access to both the keyboard and the
mouse do to their setup, or for people that have a bad mouse and would
rather use the keyboard.  Its also nice not to have to flip through menus to
access a certain function quickly (like changing weapons).

        Graphics are excellent.  The are very colourful and well drawn, even
though there area lot of greys used with the science fiction basis of the
included missions.  The sound is also very well done.  But this must be
attributed to Team 17, for Dave got permission to uses the samples from Team
17's great arcade shoot'em up Alien Breed.  The weapon reload sound is
simply amazing.  Because of total flexibility with sound, graphics, and
character attributes, it is possible to make a scenario that utilizes tanks,
planes, and even spaceships!  Takes you back to the days of Wargames
Construction Set for the C64.

        The artificial intelligence system that Dave designed is hard to
beat, even on the "easy" level.  The enemy characters don't just move
randomly, nor do they simply follow and shoot (the smarter ones at least).
Some even go so far as to set up barricades and wait for other characters.
This allows for a fair amount of strategy to be used in taking care of the
enemy.  Will he stand and fight, or will he retreat when he gets too much
damage?  Of course, nothing is as challenging as playing against a good
human opponent.  The only thing that I dislike about this is that for two of
the three scenarios included, it is very hard to have a two player game.
The lack of the human factor is what makes these two scenarios possible.
The third is very playable as a two player game, and of course there is the
scenario designer.


DOCUMENTATION

        The documentation is in the form of a soft-copy manual that may be
printed.  I haven't printed it out yet; but from the size of the
documentation file, it looks fairly massive.  It covers everything from
basic play functions to explanations of each and every control mechanism.
There are also separate files for each of the three scenarios, allowing the
player to access the information on the current scenario quickly without
having to page through the main document.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

        What did I like:  the graphics and sounds, the included scenarios,
are very well done, the tried and true play system, and the AI system.

        What didn't I like:  the fact that some scenarios cannot be well
done by two players.

        On suggestion is the addition of a modem link for two player mode.


CONCLUSIONS

        I give this game a 9.5 out of a possible 10.

/// Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users
    --------------------------------------



                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA or through Tymnet from anywhere in
North America.  If you have an account on another Internet-connected
system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet programs, from
anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users can now Telnet
into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 - Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files, online, 24 hours a day.
   Portal has dedicated a 2.5 GIGabyte disk drive to the Amiga Zone.
   We have virtually unlimited space for files and new uploads. 

 - The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable
   software, online.  All of it.  Every disk.  Well-organized so
   it's easy to find exactly what you're after.

 - Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

 - Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES,
   and many others including Compute's Amiga Resource with over
   4 Megabytes of exclusive Compute magazine disk stuff you won't find
   elsewhere.

 - 35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.  Since Portal has FTP connections we can get
   new freely-distributable software online within MINUTES of its 
   being announced on Usenet.

 - No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.  Start downloading
   files with your first session on Portal. 

 - Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.
   Instead of stumbling around in frustration you can talk to the
   people who design your hardware, who write your software.

 - Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

 - Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

 - FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
 - Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  Usenet feeds into Portal many times each hour.
   There are 14 Amiga-specific Usenet newsgroups with hundreds of
   articles posted every day, including postings by Commodore 
   personnel.  Since Usenet is distributed worldwide, your questions
   and answers can be seen by literally hundreds of thousands of
   people the same day you post them.  

 - Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

 - The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
 - Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
 - All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

 - Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

 - And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Tymnet 9600bps services is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

/// Another Moronic, Inane and Gratuitous Article
    ---------------------------------------------
    by Chad Freeman
    (cjfst4+@pitt.edu or cjfst4@cislabs.pitt.edu -- Internet)
    (cfreeman -- BIX)

     Greetings, fellow Amigoids!  Well, your fearless leader (or rather his
computer) was off to parts unknown last week (a word of advice: never buy a
cheap surge protector from K-Mart), so your usual AMIGA was replaced by
something even more inane, I'm sure.  But have no fear, your jester is back
with some more comic relief for your dull and dreary lives (who needs the
comedy channel, right?).  And this week we start off, as promised, with my
hand-picked winner of the FAPLEAMIGAC (First and Probably Last Ever
A.M.I.G.A. Contest, pronounced 'bleh!').  Coincidentally, our winner was also
our only entrant.  Oh well, that's why it was 'probably last ever,' of
course!  But anyway, let us set the stage for our fair author.  After our
fearless hero was shown the wonders of Amiga Park, the scene cut to Nerdy
faxing the schematics for Amigas everywhere, and eventually being faxed
himself.  And so we begin, with:

          ****************
          * DAN LINDER'S *    <- ( name in lights)
          ****************

Amiga Park, the Final Chapter


   Suddenly, a call.  The phone, connected through a GVP PhonePak 2000+ to
an Amiga, answered.

   "Hello, you have reached Amiga Park.  In the classic tradition of the
Amiga community, we are late in opening.  Please call ba..."

   Beebleflats tore the phone from the receiver.

   "Hello, who is this?" he asked.

   "This is that guy with the Arab name (I can't remember it, either...) and
I'm being attacked!!!"

   "Hold on, start from the beginning..."

   "Well, you remember when Irving electrocuted himself?"

   "Yeah, that was pretty funny...."  Beebleflats chuckled to himself.

   "Well, he didn't die!  Somehow, using spare C64 and A500 parts, he
constructed an exoskeleton for his demented mind and turned himself into...
G O U L D Z I L L A !!!!" he shouted, with a tone of panic in his voice.

   "I knew he wouldn't just die or move to the Bahamas!  All right, I'll
bring my team of engineers at once.  But, you must promise me something!"
cried Beebleflats.

   "Anything!  Do you hear me, ANYTHING!!!"

   "Alright, you must promise to give me back the net worth of Commodore at
closing, you know, the $0.12?"

   "Do you know how much that is in post-Clinton, now Perot times?  That's
almost too much to spend on my life!  But all right, I'll give it to you!
Just hurry!"  There was a click, and the Amiga enthusiasts were on the move.

   "Into the helicopter, NOW!" Beebleflats shouted.

   Once at the site of Gouldzilla's rampage, the Amigans quickly remembered
that it is easy to destroy a Gould.  Pulling out a $1.00 bill, they taunted
him until he followed them, straight into the ocean, electrocuting himself
all over again.

   Later, with a great deal of reservedness, that guy with the Arab-sounding
name handed over the $0.12, which was found to be worth
$0.1E100000000000000 in 1993 Clintonian money.  Such was the rebirth of
Amiga, and they spread all through the land, confirming that age-old
suspicion...  Amiga had found a way.


                      /* The End */



Thanks Dan, for as wonderful an ending as I originally wrote (of course!),
however unrelated to Jurassic Park it may have been.  But alas and alack, the
time has come to move on to other things...

There was a hot new terminal program released last week, and your friend
the Official Blue Level Commodore Beta Tester was able to preview in time for
this article.  No, I'm not talking about Terminus from Radigan, but rather
Terminally Ill from the Foo Brothers.  This terminal program is so
outstanding, it will replace all terminal programs on any platform forever.

I mean, even His Nerdness Bill Gates will buy an Amiga just to use this
program! And why is that?  Well, if you've tried Terminus, you know its a
wonderfully flexible program, but BOY is it a pain in the arse to configure
properly! Well, with TI configuration is no longer a problem.  TI uses
emissions from the joystick port of your lowly Amiga to actually read your
neural emissions, and actually configure itself based on what it reads from
your brain (WARNING:  avoid this procedure if drunk, and don't even THINK
about it if on hallucinogenic substances!).  Yes, that's right folks, your
entire directory will be inputted into the program, along with your
passwords, choice of screen colors, and anything else you can THINK of (get
it)!  And operating the program is just as easy; you simply think about who
you want to call, what you want to do, etc., and it does it ALL
automagically!  How's THAT for convenience (and you thought handles on toilet
paper packages was going too far!).  That's right folks, you'll never have to
worry about ANY of those annoying things that go along with
telecommunications again; typing endless password sequences, remembering
complex menu structures, the program does it all.  'Well, how much memory
does this take?' you ask.  Well, using sophisticated memory management and
compression techniques such as MPIG 3.2, TI actually takes NEGATIVE memory!

That's right, TI actually ADDS anywhere from 50 to 100k to your memory pool
while running!  How's THAT for efficiency! 'So where's the hitch,' you
wonder, and rightly so.  Here it is: the shareware fee.  Its rather steep at
$7000 (seven thousand) dollars, and unfortunately if you DON'T register the
program will give you steadily more violent bodily seizures until you turn
into jell-o (lime, of course).  I have seen it happen, its not pretty.  But
all in all, I'd say its WELL worth the money, especially since as a Blue
Level beta tester I paid not one red cent for it!

Ah well, the time has come again to be going.  Of course we leave you with
the Joke of the Week (now in capital letters!)...

Guy 1: Why did you build a house without windows?
Guy 2: Bill Gates threatened to sue if I did.

Let me remind you all that if you have a submission for The Joke of the Week,
write it in and, if I like it, I'll put it in and mention your name. 

And with that, adieu and adios, hasta la vista, bon voyage, and aloha!  Tune
in next week for another exciting episode of A.M.I.G.A., the only article
that dares you to explain exactly why there's so many slow schools out
there....

1 INTRODUCTION
--------------
Welcome to Terminus 2.0, a highly capable and flexible, if not seasoned
telecommunications tool for the Amiga personal computer system.  Terminus
is a completely rewritten replacement for JR-Comm 1.02a.  It is not an
update.

Initially, JR-Comm was going to be updated as scheduled to include XPR and
ARexx support.  But, quite frankly, JR-Comm's major limitation was that it
lacked the proper design to add new features easily.  With the release of
AmigaDOS 2.04 it became apparent that a complete rewrite was the only
solution.  As a result, Terminus is essentially a second generation
product, hence the 2.0 version number.  

Terminus also conforms, where possible, to the recommendations outlined in
the "Commodore Amiga Style Guide" for Release 2 of the Amiga operating
system while still retaining compatibility with the 1.3 release.  However,
all future releases of Terminus will be compatible with the 2.0 (or later)
operating system release only.


     1.1 FEATURES OVERVIEW
     ---------------------
     The following are the major features present in Terminus 2.0.

	  -    Reentrant program design for multiple sessions using one
	       copy of program code in ram.

	  -    All internal functions multitask.

	  -    Can be iconified.

	  -    The entire program is keyboard navigable.

	  -    Comprehensive script language implemented as a small BASIC
	       interpreter.

	  -    Automated script record feature to create login scripts.

	  -    ARexx and XPR support.

	  -    Display system uses custom scroll routines for fast scroll
	       rates and interleaved bitmaps to eliminate flicker during
	       scrolling without the need for a 68020 or higher cpu.

	  -    TTY, AMIGA, IBM COLOR/MONO, VT52, VT102 AND VT220 terminal
	       emulations.  All emulations are as complete and as accurate
	       as possible.

	  -    Console definition files to easily change Terminus between
	       different terminal configurations.

	  -    XMODEM, XMODEM-CRC, XMODEM-1k, YMODEM, YMODEM-1k, YMODEM-g

Overview
--------
One of the things Workbench 2.0 (and 3.0) is still missing is a printer
spooler. PrintManager is just that. There are some other programs that 
try to implement a spooler on the Amiga, but:

 PrintManager is a system wedge, so it will work with every program, not
  just ones explicitly written to take advantage of it;
 The wedge is installed at parallel or serial device level, so PrintManager
  will really work with EVERY program: no matter if it uses PRT: or directly
  the printer device, no matter if it's printing text or graphics. Even
  programs that use directly PAR: or SER: can be cached using the DEVICE
  ToolType.
 Only printer device calls are cached, so modem and net users will not
  experiment performance loss.
 PrintManager has a nice, font sensitive graphic user interface (GUI) and
  supports localization under Workbench 2.1 or later.
 You can print files directly from PrintManager, using either the AppIcon,
  or the AppWindow, or a menu command.
  Under Kickstart 2.x only text files may be printed; under Kickstart 3.x
  datatypes.library is used so you can print anything which is recognized by
  MultiView.
 The printer-specific raw data can be saved to a file. That file may be
  printed at a later time via PrintManager itself, or brought to another
  computer (since it contains raw data, you just have to send it unchanged
  to the printer). For example, you may prepare an article at home and use
  the expensive laser printer at office to print it.
 After a system crash or reset, unfinished printings are automatically
  recovered. This feature may also be used to prepare raw data and print it
  at a later time.
 A Form Feed may be automatically inserted between printings.


REQUIREMENTS

        OS 2.04 or later
        Hard disk is not required but strongly recommended
        Printer ;-)

The aim of the game:
-------------------

Do  you  run  your  system  under  another  screenmode than PAL or NTSC, for
example  EURO72 or an AGA specific screenmode?  Have you ever tried to start
a  game or demo from within this screenmode?  Have you ever been angry about
those programmers who do not stick to the system friendly way of programming
thus  producing  programs  which  are  not aware of the screenmode they were
started out of?

Do  you  have an Amiga with 68010, 68020, 68030 or 68040 processor?  Did you
ever curse those socalled coders whose programs crash your computer when you
didn't  disable  the  processor's  caches and forgot to move the vector base
register to $0.l?

Lame programming is the desease, RunLame is the cure!

RunLame is a Kick2.04+ tool, it will NOT work under Kick1.0/1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4!
RunLame  is  100% reentrant Assembler code, so you can set the pure flag and
make it resident. RunLame is startable from Workbench.

RunLame  takes  some  options and a commandline as argument and executes the
given commandline, just after having opened an optional little PAL screen in
the front, having moved the VBR to $0.l and having disabled all caches (also
external  ones),  burst  modes, copyback mode on 68040 processors.  When the
commandline  has  been  executed  the  screen  is closed and the processor's
caches  (burst, copyback, VBR) state is reset to the same as before starting
RunLame.   When  all  parameters  and  options  are omitted, RunLame opens a
graphical user interface on the default public screen.

Summerizing  we  can say RunLame is a multitasking friendly temporary system
degrader  which  may  let  some  bad  behaving  programs  run in your system
environment  (but  can't  give  any  guarantee).   If  some  of those `lame'
programs  don't  run  though  RunLame  has  been  used, they are on a higher
lameness-level,  which  can't  be fixed by RunLame (this is definitely not a
bug of RunLame).

I do write demos myself and you can believe, I DO KNOW how to write a proper
startup code.  Nothing more is RunLame, just an external startup code.

/// Usenet Review:  AsmOne v1.02
    ----------------------------
    By Tomas Nilsson
    (No Email address available)



PRODUCT NAME

	AsmOne version 1.02


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

	Name:		Rune Gram-Madsen
	Address:	     DMV - Verlag		(the distributor)
			     Postfach 250
			     D-3440 Eschwege
			     Germany


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

	A fast assembler/disassembler and debugger for 68000 code.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

	HARDWARE

		A half meg of memory is enough to start with, but larger
		programs require more memory.

		It works fine with any Amiga CPU available today (60000
		through 68040).

	SOFTWARE

		It runs under any Kickstart version (tested under 1.2 through
		3.1).

		The freely distributable req.library makes your life easier
		but is not required.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

	All available Amiga models with various Kickstart versions.  Memory
on these machines varied from a machine with 0.5 MB Chip RAM to a machine
with 2 MB Chip RAM and 6 MB Fast RAM.

REVIEW

	AsmOne looks very similar to the old K-Seka, but don't be fooled.
Under the surface of the program there is a very powerful assembler with
lots of options.

	To start with, it asks you to specify your "work memory."  This is a
fixed value in kilobytes.  Within this workspace, your source is placed
together with the assembled program.  All external files such as include
files will not be placed here.

* Writing a source file

	There is no need for some kind of external editor.  It's built in
and it's _FAST_!  It supports the basic cursor movements together with some
extra commands (such as jump 100 lines up/down).  There is block
mark/copy/save to disk/lowercase/.../...  options.  Search/search+replace,
mark place/jump to marked place... etc.

* Assembling speed

	Assembling is astonishing fast.  (Speed results for a 500 KB
disassembled file originally written in C took 10.5 seconds to assemble.  In
comparison, Devpac takes 38.2 seconds.)  If you are using include files,
that's no problem.  AsmOne does not read the files again if you don't ask it
to.  This speeds up assembling a lot on a floppy disk system.  On a fast
hard disk, it doesn't matter that much; but anyway, it's almost twice the
speed if you assemble a file with lots of include files on a standard Amiga
3000.

* Bug killing

	There are some different type of error tracing methods, but the one I
usually run is to stop assembling at an error.  If an error occurs, the line
that it occurred on is displayed together with an appropriate message.

	The assembled file can be written as an object file or be run in
memory.  The link file is somewhat broken.  If you choose to run the file
from memory (it's the normal way to do it), you can either just run it as if
it were run from disk, or run it in the debugger.

* The Debugger

	Running your program from the debugger is the real strength of
AsmOne.  In debug mode, you can see your source (as it was written in the
editor).  At the rightmost part of the screen in debugging mode are the
normal registers (D0-D7/A0-A7/SSP/USP/SR/PL/PC).  Now you can choose several
options.  The most normal is to set some kind of breakpoint somewhere within
the code.  This can be done by either setting a address or a label, or just
marking a position using the cursor.  Now, run the program.  It will stop at
the marked position.  From here is it maybe now interesting to check the
failing part of the code.  Now, you might want to know what some of
registers are pointing to.  Well, you simply add a watch(er).  Some examples
of watches are A0; A0+4; D0; $60000; (D0*3)+D1 and so on.  The watches can be
interpreted in several ways such as pointer to binary.  Now you can step N
instruction(s).  By tracing the source down like this, you can find any error
in a quite simple way.

	Since there is a built-in-debugger, it handles all faults your
program might come up to (such as TRAP-F) without a Guru.  A fun side effect
of this is that if the AsmOne code itself somehow gets destroyed, its own
debugger breaks in.

* Programming

	AsmOne is not system friendly in the same way as Devpac.  You can
freely walk around in the memory poking around to see what you might find.
This can be done either in hex+ASCII, plain ASCII, or as disassembled
memory.  You might feel, as I do, that you are on top of everything.  It's
just to peek'n'poke around just as you like and sooner or later you will
(hopefully) find your annoying bug.  AsmOne itself is programmed this way to
be fast, but unfortunately it's sometimes too fast using some rude memory
access methods.  If you're running the Enforcer together with AsmOne's debug
mode you will, each time you step an instruction, get an Enforcer hit on
address $8 to $48.

* The Program Itself

	Unlike any other assemblers (except K-Seka), you can either work with
the menus or work in a command-line mode.  All commands are short and simple
to use.  Examples are "A" (Assemble), "AO" (Assemble with Optimize) and
"h.l$60000" (look at memory address $60000 in hex mode and display it in
longwords!).  Most of these commands can be found in the menus.  One of the
commands that can't be found in the menus is the built-in calculator.  It
can calculate most of the normal programming operations such as AND, OR, NOT,
and the normal "+-/*" operations.  Results are displayed in hex, decimal,
ASCII and binary.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

	The parts that I really like are the speed of the editor/assembling
and the great debugger.

	The parts that I dislike are that it can not run at any screen wider
than 80 bytes, it can't edit more than one source at a time, and that it
can't run batchfiles upon assembling (like linking a source automatically
after assembling).


BUGS

	Well, there are no major bugs, but there's a LOT of minor bugs.  For
example, if you want to look at memory in longwords you can use "h.l
$50000".  But if you're using "h.l a0" the memory will be shown in byte
format.  I can live with this though.


CONCLUSIONS

	The product is great, especially for its speed (as I've told you
before :)).  I'll give it a 4 out of 5.  It would be a 5 if the bugs were
removed!

	My final word is: yes you should buy it.  (If you can:  it's not sold
in all countries.)  I've been using it for a long time now and I have never
regretted that I tried out this program.

Subj:   Amiga CD32

Hi Rob.
 
Just a quick note to say "thanks!" for Amiga Report, and for all the work
that goes in to producing it. Must say I _love_ the new AmigaGuide
format. Makes skimming before a thourough read a breeze!
 
The following appeared recently in comp.sys.amiga.misc, and purports to
be the translation of a message from C= Germanys Dr Peter Kittel, who in
turn was reporting the announcement there of the `Amiga 32 CD console'.
Make of it what you wish! ;) (Call it rumour for now though...)
 
Oh, before I add the text file, a couple of other things. First, the story
about hidden modem taxes is _completely bogus!_. This same story was
thrashed out in the online journal, "Telecom Digest" a few weeks ago, and
all those "in the know" agreed that it's cleverly fabricated hocus-pocus. As
I remember, neither "The San Jose Herald", nor "Congressional spokesperson
Bonnie Houck", nor even "Clinton Administration spokesperson J. R. Dobbs"
exist! Other parts of the story were also proved to be fake, but I don't
remember all the details. (Sorry). Secondly, in an earlier mag. someone
mentioned the fact that the A5000 rumour had been published in the UK
magazine "Amiga Mart". Amiga Mart is a complete rag, containing mostly
classified ads for pirated software, and greetings from cracking groups, and
is barely worth the inferior quality "toilet paper" it's printed on. The
fact that they picked up on the ancient Internet A5000 april fools joke
gives it no more weight. The photo they published was of a PC motherboard!,
with a bit of paper stuck on the cpu, poorly labled 68060. In the same issue
they published a story about a mail order company selling the A600 for a
record breaking low price of 185UKP. Wrong! Checking with the company, it is
the HD upgrade pack for the A600 which is 185UKP, the A600 is the same old
price. Most of the rest of their copy is taken straight from "Amiga Report"
word for word! (I hope they have your permission!)
 
 
Cheers!
Matt.

Subject: Amiga CD 32 - facts by C= !!!

Hey Amiga Users out there!  To stop all senseless dicussions about
technical datails or pricing of the new `Amiga 32 CD console', here are
pure, confirmed facts.  They are truly from Dr Peter Kittel, C= Germany.
If you don't believe me, take a good look into 'de.comp.sys.amiga.misc'.
This is where his posting is from.  Now, for all who have major problems
with German or who unfortunately don't have access to this newsgroup, I
put his posting into these newsgroups, adding some translations.  As I'm
not a master of English (and as I don't have my dictionaries with me),
the translation will be a bit free (and with mistakes), but I hope it
will be good enough to get the point.  Have fun.

Yesterday, there was a press conference in Munich referring this machine,
and we were allowed to talk about it.  :-) Yes, this machine is reality.
What was printed in the 'Otto' catalogue, is certainly nearly right, only
two details are somehow wrong (we are sorry about this, but I'm innocent
because I had nothing to do with it).

1. Unfortunately, there's *no* RGB output.

2.  A RAM expansion with further 2MB will be only, if ever, included in
the announced computer expansion box, but not in the basic machine.

Now, here's the official press text, which was given to the press at the
conference:

Introducing the Amiga CD32, Commodore brings full 32-bit performance to
the games world.  A new age of entertainment electronics has begun.
Technology and 'playing fun' perfectly combined in one machine.  Amiga
CD32 with it's 32-bit CPU and it's 32-bit accelerated graphics offers
outstanding graphics capabilities.  The brilliant colour is created by
having 256,000 colours on screen the same time, out of a palette of 16.8
Milion.  With this new technology, a speed and a reaction time is being
achieved, which will make 'playing fun' become a real experiance.  The
CD-ROM drive with top-loading mechanism is easy to operate.  When CD is
being inserted, the Amiga CD32 starts automatically.  Four CD stardards
are available:  audio CD, CD+G, CDTV and Amiga CD32.  The CD technology
offers concert quality music, with digital stereo sound at a sampling
rate of 44 khz.

The included game pad allows the player a precise control using
ergonomically designed buttons.  The sensitive game controller reacts
immediately.  The Amiga CD32 defines a new price/perfomance standard in
the game console market.  In Autumn '93, the MPEG video-module for more
than 70 minutes of video will be available as an option for an
outstanding price.AMIGA CD32-Full-Motion-Videomodule offers 1:1 TV
quality at 30 frames per sec.  The Amiga CD32 product will be available
in August 1993 via Commodore dealers and via the five biggest mail order
companies.  It will be delievered with a game controller, the necessary
connection parts for a TV set or a monitor and an Amiga CD32-aware new
game.  Due to copyright reasons, the title of this game can't be
announced yet.  At the date of release, 17 Amiga CD32 titles will be
available.  Till the end of the year, further 30 interresting AMIGA CD32
titles are planned, from the categories jump&run, simulation, strategy
and action.  These games will be also available via Commodore dealers.
Companies have announced comatatble CDs, which will be available from
their distributors.

Ahh, what a work.  Hope you will like this new thing and that we will see
full reviews in the magazines soon.  An that it will hit the shops soon.
I think I gonna buy one.


                      ------------------------------


Thanks for the kind words, and for the translation, Matt!  When you
mentioned Amiga Mart printing stuff from Amiga Report, no, they did not
have permission.  However, the A5000 rumors in that case don't really
matter.  I actually don't remember where they came from (the Internet
I think), so it's not a problem.  Though it would have been nice if Amiga
Mart had at least mentioned where they got it. ;)

The info on the CD32 is most welcome!  I sure hope Commodore USA will
confirm this information soon.  A lot of people are waiting with baited
breath (what IS baited breath anyway???) for some reliable information.

Orlando, FL -- A new disk-based magazine for the Atari ST/TT/Falcon
computers was announced last week. "Atari United" is said to be a technical
journal as well as an all-around magazine.  The publication will ship
each month on a floppy disk with custom front-end software.  Subscription
prices have not yet been determined.

Washington, DC -- The Clinton Whitehouse goes online.  Well, sort of.  You
may now send Electronic Mail to the President on most of the major online
services... ClintonPZ on America Online, 75300,3115 on CI$, WHITEHOUSE on
GEnie, Whitehouse at Fidonet Node 1:2613/333, clinton-hq@campaign92.org on
the Internet and White House on MCI Mail (MCI ID: 589-5485).  Prodigy
expects to have a White House Email address sometime this summer.  You are
not, however, guaranteed a response from the White House -- and certainly
not online.  At this point, all Email is sent on floppy disks by a
representative of each online service, arriving at the White House on foot,
as it were, courtesy of the US Post Office.  Messages with valid postal
addresses then receive a hard-copy reply from a White House worker or
volunteer.  "Our goal is to have messages responded on online by the fist
of the year," said Jock Gill, White House liaison to online services.
