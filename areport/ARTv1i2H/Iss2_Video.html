    <h1 align="left">Using Three Amiga Computers Simultaneously To
      Make Music Videos</h1> 
    <h3 align="right">Lee Roskin &lt;krish@cup.portal.com&gt;</h3>

    <p>I make music videos using an A500, an A1000, an A1200, a Hi8
      genlock, a Hi8 video camera and casette recorder at the same
      time.  The productions are like a recorded performance with no
      overdubbing or editing involved.  I have a semi-converted PAL
      A500 that I use for my music source.  I play Mods that I got
      online and from the Ultimate Mod Collection CD (using EdPlayer)
      through an Amiga Audio Expander ( from Contraption Industries)
      and record onto the master Hi8 tape along with the video
      material.  In recent months I have used the A500 to control my
      CD-Rom drive to play audio CD's (using AsimTunes software).  The
      music that I like to use is Techno and from commercial CD's I
      like to use what is called Trance.  The audio is also connected
      to a Mind Light 7 device which is connected to the A1200.
    </p>


    <p>The A1200 runs the Visual Aurals Music Animation System which
      is the Mind Light 7 real time audio digitizer and Visual Aurals
      software from Geodesic Productions, Deluth, GA (404-8220566).
      The Mind Light 7 captures the incoming music and sends the
      information to the second mouse port and
      Visual Aurals turns that into a truly fantastic animated light
      show that responds to the music.  The keyboard of the 1200
      controls the parameters of the lightshow which allows almost
      unlimited modifications of the visual material.  The lightshow
      puts patterns, colors, objects and graphics on the screen which
      respond to the music and the control of the operator.  The
      Visual Aurals system is about seven years old (now being
      re-developed by Geodesic) so I have use the 1200 under the
      Original Chip Set on boot-up.  The RGB output of the lightshow
      is viewed on a monitor and passed onto a SuperGenSX genlock by
      Digital Creations.  The RGB material is mixed with composite
      video material input from an A1000.  The relative amounts of the
      mixture is controlled by the operator by means of the background
      and graphics dissolves sliders on the unit.
    </p>


    <p>A Live! real time video digitizer is connected to the A1000
      which is running software by Invision which controls the colors
      and special effects of the Live!  digitizer.  The keyboard of
      the A1000 activates color maps which I have created and assigned
      to various keys and a trackball controls such things as color
      cycling and special effects.  The Live! is digitizing in real
      time video material coming from a video camera.
    </p>


    <p>I use a Canon A1 Digial Hi8 Camcorder which is aimed at a video
      monitor which is showing the composite video output from the
      genlock.  In other words the camera is shooting video feedback
      which has been modified by the A1000 and mixed with lightshow
      material from the A1200.  This is a little hard to explain with
      words and to understand.  The S-Video output from the genlock is
      recorded on a Sony Hi8 video casette recorder which is monitored
      on the monitor which the camera is aimed at.  It's a little
      confusing but when everything is adjusted the effect is quite
      interesting.  There is a video feedback loop that is being
      modified by the lightshow and the video digitizer.  It works.  I
      use several controls on the camera to get the effects I want
      such as focus, zoom, shutter speed and exposure (I haven't
      gotten around to "white balance" yet).
    </p>


    <p>I have a lot of controls available and the effect is, I think,
      quite fantastic -- what used to be called "psychedelic" which
      goes well with the Techno Trance music.  I create background
      graphics for the lightshow (which cycle colors to the music)
      using Brilliance and ImageMasterRt.  I've made many hours of
      music videos in this manner which I have put on to VHS tape
      which very few people are interested in but I like to look and
      listen to them very much.  I think the effect would be really
      fantastic if it were projected on a very big screen at a disco
      or live music performance.
