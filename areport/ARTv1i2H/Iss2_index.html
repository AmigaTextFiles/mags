    <h5>Views, Opinions and Articles presented herein are not
      necessarily those of the editors and staff of Amiga Report
      Technical Journal, hereafter ARTJ, or of FS Publications.
      Permission to reprint articles is hereby denied, unless
      otherwise noted.  All reprint requests should be directed to the
      editor.  ARTJ and/or portions therein may not be edited in any
      way without prior written permission.  However, translation into
      a language other than English is acceptible, provided the editor
      is notified beforehand and the original meaning is not altered.
      ARTJ may be distributed on privately owned not-for-profit
      bulletin board systems (fees to cover cost of operation are
      acceptable), and major online services such as (but not limited
      to) Delphi and Portal.  Distribution on public domain disks is
      acceptable provided proceeds are only to cover the cost of the
      disk (e.g.  no more than $5 US).  CD-ROM compilers should
      contact the editor.  Distribution on for-profit magazine cover
      disks requires written permission from the editor.  ARTJ is a
      not-for-profit publication.  ARTJ, at the time of publication,
      is believed reasonably accurate.  ARTJ, its staff and
      contributors are not and cannot be held responsible for the use
      or misuse of information contained herein or the results
      obtained there from.  ARTJ is not affiliated with Escom AG.  All
