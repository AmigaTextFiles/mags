<p>Recently, I had an argument with a friend about program optimisation. I
thought a great utility he had made could be made user friendlier, and
thus, in my view, much better, by adding some extra strings in it. The
friend thought these would just be a waste of memory, however little they
would take.</p>

<p>We've had this kind of arguments before, when he has wanted versions of
programs optimised for his CPU model, "to save those few cycles". Most of
the time, I think this kind of tweaking is just ridiculous. Who is going
to miss a few bytes of memory, or a couple of CPU cycles each second, when
the majority of users have both to spare? Of course, he thinks the same
way of me, claiming that I'm on the way to bloated code.</p>

<p>This is an example of the diversity of goals people have while developing
programs. Some think it a win if they can shave off 30 bytes from their
15k utility, some wouldn't care the slightest if it took twice as much.
Some think a graphic user interface just slows them down, while others
hate "cryptic" command line arguments. There are people who never use
advanced features in a program, but like it goodlooking, while another
group don't pay attention to the aesthetics, as long as the software can
fill their every need.</p>

<p>There are only two aspects I think everyone agrees on. A program should
not crash, and it should not be slow. I believe no one would argue against
these two points, but I can not be sure. Does someone out there disagree?</p>

<p>We programmers have a hard task in trying to satisfy as many as possible.
Especially in a field like Amiga, where the users are few to start with, a
developer can not afford to turn off a significant group of potential
users. Because of this, I would like to ask all of you, developers and
users alike, what is it that you expect in a good program?</p>

<p>I know many of you are very tired of surveys, but I think this is a
different one. Please, take a couple of minutes to fill out the form later
in the issue, and send it to artech@warped.com, with a subject of "User
preference survey". I played with the idea of making this survey a WWW
form, or even an ARexx script, but due to the variety of medias ARTech is
distributed through, a conventional ASCII letter will probably work best.
Sorry. Maybe you'll see some cool forms later.

<p>Last, while definitely not least, I would like to apologise for the long
delay between the first ARTech issue and this second one. I can not say
that things would have been hectic here, because they have not. After
taking over the job of editing ARTech from Greg Block, who began this
magazine, I was faced with the serious of problem of not having any
articles to fill a magazine with. The problem remains. Because of this, I
want to take this opportunity to ask you, the reader, to contribute to
ARTech. We are not just a programmer magazine, we are a magazine for every
technically oriented Amiga user in the world. Tell us what you do with
your Amiga, and how you do it. The address is the same as before,
artech@warped.com. I wish to give all of you an interesting magazine, one
worth reading. Help make it possible.</p>

<p>Yours,<br><br>

 Osma Ahvenlampi, editor of Amiga Report Technical Journal.</p>
