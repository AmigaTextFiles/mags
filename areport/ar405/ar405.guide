Walker, new.  Schmitt, out.  Jost, in.

What's going on here?

As many of you may have heard by now, Amiga Tech showed their new Amiga
Walker prototype machine at March's CeBit.  A very unconventional case hid
a somewhat conventional 030/40, AGA based Amiga with some very new
features, such as a PC industry Super I/O chip and a new CPU/Expansion bus.

After staggering losses in 1995, Manfred Schmitt departed Escom.  He has
been replaced by Helmut Jost.  Jost ran Commodore Germany and left in 1993 for
Escom's Sales and Marketing position.  He subsequently left Escom in late
1995 to run IBM's German PC sales division, but is now back, this time at
the helm of Escom.  Meanwhile, company founder Manfred Schmitt is
presumably free to retire at a young age or pursue his dreams elsewhere.

What does this mean for the Amiga and Amiga Technologies?  No mention of
what his policy towards AT might be has been made.  Amiga Technologies
employees seem cautiously optimistic that this change may bring good things
to the company.

In the past fortnight or so, the Amiga community got two new relatives.
The new baby, the Walker, is an odd shaped piece of machinery, but it's got
the right bloodline.  The new patriarch, Helmut Jost, is a question mark.

But let us here at Amiga Report be among the first to welcome both to the
party.  It really can be a fun place sometimes.

Speaking of fun, enjoy the issue.

Jason

PS-- How many of you realized that our 100th issue passed without comment?
It was very tempting to have a flashy, dramatic celebration, but then I
remembered the last magazine to brag about its 100th issue.  Amiga World
was cancelled a few months later.  So we'll stick with the low-key
approach.  :)

From: bono@post.almac.co.uk (Bono)

Jason,

As with the majority of mails you undoubtedly receive, I am going to start
by saying...  Wow!  After having heard about AR for a long time from a
variety of sources I eventually, and somewhat sceptically, downloaded #401
and was utterly blown away, by the overwhelming graphics, great print
quality, glossy paper, 50% advert content, and paid-by-the-letter writers.
No, I'm being serious, it's what AR doesn't have that makes it so special,
just look at price as an example.  I pay about $10 every month for a
particular Amiga magazine and what do I get: all of the above and worse. 
Only 6 reviews of any use at all, and the majority, (I speculate)
influenced by a very nice corporate lunch.  (not like I'm a cynic or
anything.  :) 

I look at my $10 worth and compare it with my 10-second-phonecall copy of
AR.  Need I say more?  Please keep up the good work, the whole Amiga
community in indebted to all the writers and editorial staff at AR, a very
big Thankyou on behalf of all of us.

All the Best,
Alastair Angus (Bono)

     Well, you're welcome.  It makes me proud to know that AR is considered
     in the same, or a better, caliber than the print magazines that abound
     out there.  I would like to point out that while I can't speak for
     previous years, I think the current crop of my print colleagues out
     there are a pretty honest bunch who fully understand the impact of
     their commentary and their responsibility to the market.  -Jason

From dturner@bhk1.bhk.l.chiba-u.ac.jp Thu Mar 21 21:30:08 1996

Reading the editorial comment in the latest edition of AR, I feel inclined
to agree about the situation of the Amiga.  Being conservative about
products in the computer world doesn't work that well - especially if you
don't have a computer that has a good reputation.  The Amiga has to WIN
people over - people that are probably using the Win95 platform.  To do
that, it has to be shown that the Amiga has comparable technology and low
prices.  Generally, the Amiga does not require as powerful resources as the
Win95 world, but the recent release of AT's version of the A1200 and A4000T
have shown to be overpriced even for current Amigans.

The brutal reality about the Amiga is that it must develop into a hardware
setup that mirrors many of the easily available PC parts.  Things like
floppy drives, hard drives, memory - everything must be similar so that
Amiga prices can be comparable to the millions of IBM clones being sold.
Furthermore, AT should present a variety of models that have slightly
different specifications.  For example, have 3 or 4 different processors,
memory setups, hard drive capacities and so on.  Then simply have different
names.  This gives the potential Amiga buyer the impression that there are
a variety of different models.  Moving to a new platform when there are
only two models available (even if older models exist) gives the impression
that the market is small.  This is all about marketing.  Generally, it has
worked well for Apple, who has simply changed the badge name on some of its
Macs (using basically the same equipment) to achieve a broader range of
computers.

This would also enable the introduction of more computers over the year -
without the huge cost of a completely new machine.  For example, a version
of the A1200 should now be out with an accelerator card in the expansion
slot, a 500 meg HD, and 6 Meg of ram.  This would fill the gap between the
current A1200 and the A4000T as well.  As far as the cost would go, AT only
has to add a few more parts, and vary the price accordingly.  The work
hours are almost nil.

In todays computing world, computer manufacturers have to provide
solutions, not just the machine.  In the days of Commodore, many people
were buying Amigas, and then later going out and buying accelerator cards -
this shouldn't have been necessary.  Commodore should have provided
competitive solutions themselves.  At least with AT they are collaborating
with third parties (eg.  Phase 5) to reduce their own expenses, yet ensure
that the initial Amiga they sell is a good product.  Commodore was too
pig-headed about developing their OWN product.

AT can do more, on this front as well.  More models, cheaper prices, and
the use of at least Escom in Europe to promote the Amiga will give AT a
footing, and then they may have the support to really start expanding the
Amiga market.

Regards,

Duncan Turner.


     On some fronts, AT has begun to do these things.  Let's hope the trend
     continues. -Jason

Jason,

As the editor I'd like to thank you for the truly execellent you and the
other staff at AR for producing this cool magazine.

As I don't have access to UseNet at WORK, (Who want to pay for Internet
when you can get it for free...) I am unable to make this request via the
UseNet.

Since my daily bread and butter comes from working on the DREADED and
pathetic PeeCee, but one thing it has which is truly excellent.  That is
Visual Basic, among a few. 

As I am doing development/maintenance on in-house developed systems, I'd
love to know:

    ** Are there ANY programming tools like Visual Basic on Amiga ?  **

I feel the current lack of a decent database development system, is
breaking the speed at which the Amiga can be considered a real machine for
business.  Whereas the PC has invaded Amiga terrritory on every single
front, most noteably the absance of Amigas on shelves for a long time has
made the PC gain a foothold in the Graphics arena.  To name but just one. 
Recently I paged through an American "3D-Artist" mag, on a few pages there
were mentions of the Amiga.  Or as it was put in one of the articles about
the development of Computer Gfx : "The Amiga was the PC which has started
graphics on non-SGI systems."

Well, as I said before.  We need some decent Database development software.
I mean, really HEAVYWEIGHT stuff, like VB4.0, even Visual Basic V3.0 will
do, thanks a lot.  Not even to mention things like Delhpi.  Whereby the
creator of the software, using this AmigaVisualBasic will distrubute
fully-working run-time versions of the program, like compiled AMOS files.

I am aware of SuperBase 4 for Amiga which I undserstood was quite powerful.
But is there still support for it?  [Yes, but not a lot. -Jason]

We aren't all fond of devlving deep into the likes of the Amiga ROM
manuals, let alone stuff around in endless pages of code.  I'm talking
C/C++ now.  What a waste of development time.  It should of course, also
support some form of SQL.  Support for Servers isn't a necessaity.  Just be
able to use your modules over a shared network.  Something like the
Access-SQL will be verrrry, very nice to have.

Please, I'm standing on my knees.  I'm begging the Amiga developers
community.  Consider a tool like this, as the PC is an absolute NIGHTMARE
to work on.

Greets,
Mike Erasmus

From: fass003@ariel.macarthur.uws.EDU.AU (Anthony Ikeda)

Here is my idea.  Why can't the Amiga be card based, by this I mean
allowing the various ports to be an option for example the Serial,
Parallel, external drive, scsi and midi ports could each be supplied on a
card that slips in the back like the FMV card for the CD32.  Therefore the
FMV could also be included with the card.  This could be known as the Amiga
Studio.  Perhaps the serial and parallel ports could be separate but the
others are options that fit together.  I mean how many people are going to
use these as soon as they get their Amiga????  Maybe you think this is
stupid but if it will reduce the cost of the Amiga I think it's the best
option.

     Well, it all depends on whose cards you're using.  If you're building
     custom cards, it's probably going to wind up more expensive in the
     long run.  If you're talking about plugging industry-standard cards
     in, that's another matter.  PCI is supposed to be coming on
     PowerAmigas, which would make this sort of architecture easy and
     obvious.  Until then, however, it seems AT will be stuck with custom
     boards.  -Jason

Hi Jason!

I am writing in response to the reader mail in AR4.03 concerning the
Derringer 030 and OS3.1

I have an A2000 with a CSA Derringer 030/33 with 8MB of RAM installed.  I
am running v1.0 of the D3 utility with no problems under OS3.1.

Has the reader checked for incompatibilities in his utilities/commodities
that he runs upon bootup?  I am running MCP 1.05 (020 version) and
ToolsDaemon.  I maintain complete ability to use all arguments of the D3
utility.

Just letting you know that it is possible to run the D3 utility under
OS3.1...

Dear Katherine

I am searching for a program, PD or commercial, which will allow me to join
animation files created in DPaint (OP-5 format).

CyroUtil's CombineANIM, 1989, works perfectly for two very small files.  It
appears that the program is unable to take advantage of all CyroUtil's
CombineANIM, 1989, works perfectly for two very small files.  It appears
that the program is unable to take advantage of all of the available fast
ram.

I would be pleased to receive any information or advice relating
to this matter from readers of ar.

Many thanks

===========================================================================

Many Many bitches, moans, complaints.

Many MANY flames. 

Many Amiga users thought that Escom/AT had a magic wand and after the long
buyout process and auction E/AT would fix everything overnight. 

It hasn't happened and anyone that thought E/AT would do feats comparable
to Jesus himself have been fooling themselves.   Let's look at some simple
facts and then put yourselves in AT/Escoms shoes. 

Commodore started it's decline long before they went bankrupt in 1994,
losing marketshare and developers as they sat on their rumps.

Liquidation started in 1994 and lasted an entire year.  Other companies
forged ahead, more developers lost, more users lost. 

April 1995.  Escom wins auction with a 10+ million dollar bid.

Escom starts sorting through the mess left by Commodore's demise.

Within the 10 months they have owned the technology:

- Hire the needed Amiga personnel.
- Form Amiga Technologies.
- Reconstruct a dealer network.
- Find distributors in various countries.
- Choose a manufacturing line for the machines.
- Retool that line for Amiga products.
- Negotiate the addition of software to be included in 
  the Magic Pack.
- Reintroduce the A1200 and the A4000T.
- License the Amiga Technology to Viscorp.
- Chose the PowerPC chip as the next CPU for Amigas.
- Start Developing the new machine and cooperate with Phase5
  to get the job done.
- Introduce the Amiga Surfer pack a all-in-one package to get
  your amiga online.
- Introducing a new machine with more processing power
  and expansion.
- Attended numerous shows/expos pledging their support for
  the Amiga and showing off their offerings.
- Held Developers meetings to try and draw back/keep developers
  on the Amiga.

This list isn't all encompassing of course as I don't know everything that
goes on at AT.  Just with the things I've listed here, AT has been HARD at
work in the last ten months for the Amiga.

Think about the above list for a while and what AT has done for the Amiga.
It is a lot in 10 months of buying the remains of a liquidated company.

The one thing that is a major gripe point is *price,price,price*  

How many companies could accomplish the above with out taking on an
enormous amount of debt/cost?  NONE.  If AT continues to price their models
high it will destroy the Amiga, if they bring their price down as they
become more and more stable everyone should be happy.  (some are never
happy though)

If it weren't for the price, what has AT done that is so *bad*???
Absolutely nothing.  They haven't played every card perfectly but they have
done some very good things for the Amiga in 10 months.

Think about this, if Dell had bought the Amiga Tech there would be no new
Amigas at *any* price. 

I ask all Amigans to look at the *whole* picture when looking at Amiga
Technologies.  Applaud them for bringing back the Amiga, developing new
Amigas, taking a chance.  Write them about the high prices and suggest to
them your ideas and opinions where you think they could improve. 

Quit looking at the half of the glass that's not full and look at the glass
that is full of many accomplishments.  A pessimistic Amiga community sucks.
We have enough people beating on the machines we use/love than to have
ourselves give into it also.  I'm guilty of it once in a while too.

WHAT IS OFF PISTE?

[It's produced using Amigas.  That's what the press release is doing
here...  -Jason]

Off Piste is an alternative urban youth culture mag (on paper, in English),
focusing on topics such as music, entertainment, computing/communication,
youth travel, subcultures, and philosophy.  It is written and designed by
skilled young talents who report directly from the core of what's happening
around the globe.

THE FIRST ISSUE FEATURES THIS:

-THE TRUE SPIRIT OF SATANISM
Off Piste Editor Frode Erikson takes an in-depth look at the ideology
behind this rapidly expanding and church-burning subcult.  He talks with a
member of the Church of Satan in the U.S, and interviews a Christian
theologist to get his viewpoints.

-GRAFFITI ARTISTS - JUST VANDALS WITH HANDLES?
Can sprayed walls be looked upon as artistic images, or is it just
vandalism, like the general public like to believe?  Our UK correspondent
Simon Carless investigates the issue on a trip to Washington D.C.

-URBAN LIFE IN DURBAN AND CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA
Hasty impressions by Norwegian freelancer Tor Ketil Solberg from a
continent which is mostly known for starving young children and civil wars.

-STAND-UP POETRY
Stand-up Comedy become immensely popular in the 80's, bringing us stars
like Eddie Murphy and Billy Crystal.  Stand-up Poetry is the new hip thing
of the 90's.  In N.Y., there are already 10 cafe's devoted to this new way
of expressing lyrical art.  Off Piste's correspondent in Copenhagen, Martin
Serup, reports on how this new scheme has been brought into action in
Europe.

@toc NEWS

Manfred Schmitt removed as Escom CEO
Translated from Die Welt by Sven Tegethoff (cheetah@ius.gun.de)

             Managing director of "Escom AG" forced to resign

Founder of discount-retailer for computers draws consequences from last
years high losses - Helmut Jost announced to be the successor.

Berlin - After high losses of 125,000,000 DM, the managin director of the
computer company located in Bochum, Manfred Schmitt, is going to leave the
company by the end of the month.  Yesterday, Escom announced that the board
directors appointed Helmut Jost as the new Managing director from the first
of April.  43 year-old Mr.  Jost was already active once in Escoms board of
directors from 1993 to 1995, before taking over the management of IBM's
PC-business.

An Escom spokesman in Heppenheim said, that Escom-Founder Schmitt had
offered his position by his own wish after the huge deficit, and annouced
he wants to take the full responsibility.  Escom, with a turnover of
2,350,000,000 DM, were following some ambitious goals, but went out of
financial breath on them.  Schmitt pushed the building up of an own retail
chain in Great Brittain, for example.  Though these investments seemed to
be the strategically correct steps into foreign markets, they took too much
capital, and didn't bring enough income.  The english PC market proved
itself to be just as tired as the German one nowadays.  Generally, the weak
demand and the enourmous drop of prices on the PC market forced down
Escom's turnover and margins.  Escom-Chief Schmitt's Multimedia-Plans also
proved as too high.  Their potential partner RWE Telliance, a daughter of
electricity provider RWE, retired from their interest because of Escom's
financial situation.  Banks and shareholders promised the company
100,000,000 DM of financial support (60,000,000 DM from a raise of assets),
to overcome the financial bottleneck.

The telephone company from Kiel by the name of "Hagenuk", which Manfred
Schmitt privately bought out from the "Preussag" in Oktober, caused further
Irritations among Escom's stockholders "Quelle" (25%) and "Siemens Nixdorf"
(SNI, 12.5%).  It was Schmitt's plan to let the company sell cellular
phones via his Escom shops, about which the aforementioned two shareholders
didn't agree at all.

Even after his retirement to the board of shareholders, Schmitt is still
currently holding 23% of Escom's assets.  Escom's share price rised up to
13DM yesterday, after 12.7 DM on Tuesday.

DESCRIPTION

  StormC

  The versatile programming system for you and your Amiga! 
  ========================================================

At the COMPUTER 95 we were introducing our brand-new C/C++ development
system called StormC.  It is a highly integrated software development
system, containing an editor, compiler, linker, debugger and a RunShell
with some very special features.

The heart of StormC is its project management tool, which differs from the
traditional MAKE because really every part of the project including source,
includes and documentation can be managed by it and represented
graphically.  The very fast editor displays key-words colourfully.  This
option gives the programmer a good control while he is typing the source
code, because it is a kind of syntax check and it improves the readability
of the text.  The StormC compiler handles ANSI C and C++ code and generates
optimised code for the whole Motorola 68xxx family (including 68060 and
68881/882).

The RunShell is a run-time system that monitors the running application and
prevents it from crashing the system.  It also offers resource tracking,
i.e.  it controls the use of resources by the program and handles cases
where it neglects to free them.

Another feature of the RunShell is the option to start the debugger.  This
can be done during (!) the run-time of the program.  So you don't have to
decide for debugging before compiling.  The debugger is integrated into the
editor.  This means that while you are debugging and setting breakpoints
you are working in the editor.  The structure and the colouring of the
source code are still there.  This is a very handy feature that makes
debugging a fast and easy process.

explained his selection of Nova Design: "We had many other offers, but
Nova's commitment to the Amiga, and the high-quality-at-a-reasonable-price
attitude that they've shown with ImageFX, convinced me that they were the
right company for Aladdin."

Before releasing Aladdin 4D, Nova Design will modernize and enhance the
interface, re-write the manual, and add a few new surprises to breathe new
life into this already superb Amiga product.  Aladdin 4D 5.0, expected to
ship in early third quarter 1996, will be available to registered owners
for a special upgrade price.

Nova Design remains excited about the future possibilities of the Amiga
market.  While some companies have chosen to abandon the Amiga, Nova Design
continues to provide new and innovative software to Amiga users worldwide.

@node NEWS13 "The Amiga Walker Prototype"
@toc NEWZ

The Walker

While we don't have any CeBit reports ready for Amiga Report yet, the
biggest news was the Amiga Walker prototype on display.

Amiga Tech isn't far enough along that they're showing off PowerAmiga
hardware yet.  The Walker is a stopgap measure, one more AGA machine to
carry the line across.

The design is quite unconventional.  The Walker a black appliance, totally
unlike a desktop computer.  Pictures have been placed on Aminet and on the
Web.

Walker Specsheet

While IRC conferences, speculation, and FAQs have abounded, not all of the
information in them has been complete or accurate.  So Amiga Report went
straight to the source--Michael Metz, Amiga Product Manager at Amiga
Technologies.  He provided this quick look at the specifications of the
Amiga Walker.

Here's a short summary:

1. 68030 Processor w/ 40 MHz (EC)

2. 2 SIMM sockelts for max. 128 MB of RAM on board

3. AGA Chipset 

4. Additional SuperIO Chip w/
   a: PC HD floppy support
   b: EIDE support (perhaps up to 4 devices)
   c: 2 * fast serial device with FIFO
   d: Enhanced parallel port with bitronic support

5. Bay for internal DD (880 KB) floppy support

6.  Complete motherboard at 40 MHz access (except for AGA) for fast memory
    access

7.  New designed system bus which will be compatible to the PPC AMIGA.
    This system bus will include all needed signals regarding PCI and ZORRO
    III.  The slot itself needs a doughter board where third party
    manufacturers may expand the system to a CPU and a ZORRO or PCI bus.

8.  The AMIGA comes with a quad speed CD ROM, a hard drive and 5 MB of
    memory (1 MB chip mem which may get expanded to 2 MD and 4 MB Fast memory
    on SIMM socket.

Because of a very new design, the AMIGA may get expanded from a mini tower
to a big tower by just taking off the upper part with the CD ROM and the
floppy and inserting slices for further expanstions (hard drives, zorro
slots, PCI slots, more floppy drives etc.).

The new system will run on a 40 MHz base with a bridge to the AGA chips.

The design is meant to be accepted by new users.  The idea was that each
user has a very intense relationship to his AMIGA so the design should be
something which supports this relationship.  Pictures are available on the
net.

@node NEWS14 "eWorld Shuts Down"
@toc NEWS

[Commodore and Escom haven't been the only companies who have been hurt by
the computer industry.  Apple's cutbacks included shutting down eWorld,
their online service.  This is the letter its users received to deliver the
news.]

Fellow eWorlders:

As promised last Friday, I am writing this letter to update you further on
what is happening here at eWorld.  While we're still working out some of
the details about our future, we wanted to give you information as soon as
we could so you can start making your plans. 

The first thing I want you to know is that we are indeed closing down
eWorld on March 31st, 1996.  While all of us here and in Apple management
acknowledge the wonderful community you have created here, it's important
for everybody to understand that in this rapidly-evolving information
industry, change is a constant.  We have to respond to market and business
realities, and we have to be constantly on the lookout to make sure we make
the right, long-term decisions. 

The way we see it, the smartest move for Apple to make is to greatly expand
our presence on the Internet.  And the best way to structure that presence
is with a portfolio of web sites and services for particular customer
groups-not a general online service like eWorld.  All of us here know that
this will be a blow to some, and an inconvenience for many of our members.
And I want to personally say that I am sorry for that.  But we studied this
issue long and hard, and believe it's the right move. 

The second thing I want you to know is that we're working to make the
transition out of eWorld as easy as possible for you.  First, we have in
place a mail forwarding program that should facilitate you receiving e-mail
messages and attachments until July 1st, 1996.  All you have to do is let
us know where you will be establishing your new Internet or online
presence, whether through an Internet Service Provider or other online
service (we'll have more info on how to do this later).  Second, we are
making available to you-at a good price-the Apple Internet Connection Kit
(AICK).  With AICK, you have an easy-to-use, all-in-one kit that can get
you connected to the Internet in as little as 15 minutes.  Third, as we
said earlier, we are going to be significantly increasing our overall
Internet presence.  You'll see new pages on a variety of exciting new
subjects-including our innovative QuickTime Live!  page that allows you to
participate in Apple WebCasts, an interesting new interactive way to
experience entertainment events.

We look forward to sharing more transition details with you shortly.  We
are literally working on these issues on an hour-by-hour basis.  You have
been very loyal to us here at eWorld.  We truly appreciate your commitment
as we work out the final transition issues over the coming days.  As the
week progresses, we will be posting a detailed Q&A covering the options
available to you. 

In the meantime, I have scheduled an auditorium conference tomorrow, March
5, at 6:30 pm PST where you and I can discuss this transition and I can
answer questions as best I can at that time.  Please join me for this
discussion (Shortcut=stage 1).

Your patience and understanding is appreciated in more ways than you think.
Please watch this spot for further updates. 

Our best,

Diana Keith, Director of Internet Productions.

@toc NEWS

ANNOUNCEMENT: NFA/SAdENESS Software AGA EXPERIENCE Vol 2 CD COMING SOON!

Since the release of The AGA Experience Volume 1, we have been inundated
with requests for a follow-up, so here it is!.  If you own an AGA Amiga, or
own a Graphics card - this is the CD for you!!!  This is the first (well,
second really) CD dedicated to A1200/A4000 owners, and features the very
best AGA-only software since the release of The AGA Experience Volume 1.

The AGA Experience Volume 1 was loved by the reviewers, and its owners.
Here is a selection of the review scores it achived in the Amiga press:

  93%  - Amiga Format (Format Gold!).
  90%  - CU Amiga.
  90%  - Amiga User International.
  90%  - Amiga Shopper.
  8/10 - Amiga Computing.

Reviews for Volume 2 to follow.. Great things are expected ;-)

Some of the main features, and improvements since the first CD are as
follows:

- EXCLUSIVE COMMERCIAL DEMOS.  We have contacted many of the Amiga's best
  software companies and they have created special demos of their best
  titles just for us!  These include a demo of the BRILLIANT Capital
  Punishment - with special speech samples, and a 1-player vs computer
  game, with 2 different characters!  An EXCLUSIVE demo of the GREAT XTreme
  Racing!  Including a special track made for us (which even includes our
  logo on the track!!).  Also included are several goodies for Xtreme
  Racing owners - like the lemmings patch and several graphical
  improvements!  We also have a great demo of Nemac4 - the latest
  3DTexture-Mapped Amiga game.  Including special 060 fixes for you lucky
  060 owners!!  You'll also be the FIRST to see the great new AGA flight
  and combat sim - Microlyte warriors!  Plus other goodies like exclusive
  Worms levels, a demo of Pinball Prelude, a demo of Watchtower, a demo of
  BlitzBombers and much more I have probably forgotten!

- EXCLUSIVE HTML DOCS AND AWEB.  Yvon Rozijn has created us a special
  version of AWeb, and we have created some exclusive HTML Internet-style
  documents!  You will see full-colour pictures, and you can even run some
  of the CD's highlighted programs directly form the interface!

- NFA PRODUCTIONS. Including The GREAT Word diskmags!

- READY-TO-RUN.  Most of the contents run straight from the CD.  There is
  no need to spend ages extracting disks.  Well over 500meg of ready-to-run
  hot utilities, diskmags, text files, demos, games and much more.  Only
  those titles which NEED to be compressed have been, these include Demos
  and slideshows which have to be stored in DMS format.  Extracting these
  is as simple as double-clicking an icon in Workbench.  IMPROVED since
  Volume 1 - there are now MANY less DMS archives to mess about with!

- MAGIC WORKBENCH colour scheme and icons.  We have spent months making
  this CD the very smartest looking CD available today.  Almost every
  program has a suitable MagicWB icon.  We have even created custom
  Ray-Traced icons for the CD, any Amiga owner is guranteed to be
  impressed!  IMPROVED since Volume 1, with all the drawers in a clearer
  lay-out and neater look.

- LICENSED Amiga Report Diskmags.  The entire 1996 collection so far -
  ready-to-view.  A great resource for any Amiga owner.

- LOADS of MagicWB icons, backdrops etc.  All you need to add a
  professional appearance to your Workbench.

- HUNDREDS of programs never before seen on CD.  Mostly downloaded from
  BBSs from around the World, and straight from the Internet.

- ALL AGA Amiga Doom clones since the release of Volume 1.  If you thought
  Doom was impossible on the Amiga - take a look at this CD for a real
  surprise!  INCLUDING, wait for it,, a demo of Alien Breed 2 - The Killing
  Grounds!  You won't believe your eyes!

- THE LATEST AGA mega-demos.  If you like being impressed by your Amiga,
  you'll find a great selection of demos on offer.  There are many which
  that are so new, you won't have even heard of before - let alone seen!  
  INCLUDING a massive 15Mb+ WILD PARTY Demo!

- FULL COMPATIBILTY INFORMATION.  We have listed where possible the
  compatibilty requirements for the various demos on this CD.  It will tell
  you required RAM, Processor and even whether it will exit back to
  Workbench!  When you load a demo, it will tell you the requirements and
  give you the option to 'RunIt' or 'Cancel'.  All you Amiga owners with
  030+ will LOVE this feature!!  ;-)

- HIGH-QUALITY artwork and packaging.  You'll be more than impressed with
  the quality of the Amiga-created artwork and packaging!  MUCH improved
  since the release of Volume 1!

- VIRTUALLY 100% indexed.  There is now a more comprehensive index file,
  with most things fully described.

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT
======================

After considerable deliberation over various alternatives, the future of
Amiga Review magazine has been finalised.  We apologise for the extremely
long delay in publication of the next issue, and thank you all for your
patience.  We did not want to go to press on another issue without being
able to annouce the future of the magazine.

The APRIL issue, which will go on sale mid-April, will be the last issue of
Amiga Review as a stand-alone magazine.  It will be the normal size and
price.

The good news is that we will continue to cover the Amiga scene in a brand
new publication call Multimedia and Desktop Video.

The first issue, June/July 1996, will be published on May 22nd.  This new
publication will cover Amiga, Mac and PC multimedia and desktop video
applications.  Several leading Amiga software packages are now out on the
PC and other platforms (including Lightwave and Scala), so discussion of
these programs will expand to cover other hardware.

PLEASE NOTE: A dedicated section of the magazine will focus exclusively on
Amiga products, including non-multimedia and video related software and
hardware.  All of the major advertisers from Amiga Review have committed to
moving across to the new magazine - so you will still be able to keep up to
date.

Continuing Amiga Review as a stand-alone magazine has been very difficult
for some time now.  We struggled on through 1995, hoping things would pick
up.   However the sudden jump in paper prices around July and a gradual
fall in readership and advertising through-out the year, put an end to any
hope of improving the situation. 

IPC have indicated there is still a possibility they will pick up exclusive
distribution of the Amiga in Australia.  We hope they do.  However, the sad
reality is that regardless of what Amiga Technology have planned for the
platform, software development has slowed to trickle and it is our belief
that things are now unlikely to turn around in the short term.
Nevertheless, the Amiga remains one of the least expensive entry level
computers, and is still cost effective for 2D/3D animation, non-linear
digital video editing and titling, and live presentation graphics.

If the Amiga scene does pick up, having Amiga coverage in a broader
publication will extend the opportunity to grow the market.  In a best case
situation, the Amiga section could one day be split off into a separate
magazine once again.

SUBSCRIBERS will automatically receive Multimedia and Desktop Video, unless
we are notified otherwise.  You may also transfer across to PC Review
magazine.   Regardless of which magazine you decide to receive, the total
number of issues remaining will apply.  Of course, if you're not happy with
this offer, we will cheerfully refund the balance of your subscription due.
We hope you will at least consider receiving the first issue of Multimedia
and Desktop Video before making a choice.

As the editor of Amiga Review, I have seen some incredible events in the
world of Commodore and the Amiga - enough to fill a good book (Hey, there's
an idea!).  The last 14 years have been enjoyable, although it was a great
shame that only at the end of the magazines life did I have the opportunity
to make improvements to Amiga Review (like having it produced on the Amiga)
I had hoped to see for so long. 

Multimedia and Desktop Video will tap into one of the most interesting
aspects of desktop computer technology in this decade.  I enjoy sharing the
potential of interesting technology with others.  As an Amiga user, you are
no doubt fascinated by this area of computing too.  I'm sure you'll find
our new magazine informative and worth while.

I am happy to discuss feedback to this change in this forum or by email.

Andrew Farrell

         Announcing World Construction Set V2 for the Amiga

Questar Productions is pleased to announce continued development for the
Amiga line of computers with the prerelease of WCS V2.

WCS V2 is full of professional features suitable for use by animators,
geologists, foresters, cartographers, architects, engineers, game
developers, teachers, students and anyone with an interest in earth
sciences and art.  It has powerful tools for those who need them, but with
its new wizard technology even a novice can get great looking pictures
fast.

WCS V2 prerelease is shipping now.  In appreciation of the support Questar
has received from the Amiga community, the price for Amiga WCS V2 is
considerably less than the price for WCS V2 on other platforms.

Amiga users who order WCS V2 prerelease will receive a FREE upgrade to the
final version, complete with new manuals.

Meanwhile World Construction Set V1 is still available -- but only for the
Amiga.  WCS V1 received rave reviews while breaking new ground in powerful
terrain creation and animation.  It's a great way to start using WCS if
you're on a budget, and it's upgradable to WCS V2 should you need the
additional power in the future.

We think WCS V2 is the best terrain animation program available on any
platform.  WCS V2 includes these advanced features:

- Spline based keyframe animation with over 100 animatable parameters,
  including motion, color and ecosystem parameters.  Create landscapes that
  change over the course of a few minutes, a day, a week, a hundred years,
  or even millions of years within a single animation.

- Interactive editing and display of parameters with a graphic interface
  that shows the camera view, an overhead view and a spline-based timeline
  editor.

- MUI-based interface takes advantage of large screen displays with
  resizable windows you can arrange the way _you_ want.  We have found MUI
  to be fast and stable, and it has helped us concentrate on giving you
  great terrain animation features while presenting a very powerful
  interface.

- Highly detailed rock textures complete with stratification and folding.

- 3D evolving clouds.

- Waves, breakers and reflections on the water.

- Automatic beaches with support for tides.

- 3D-shaded scaled image textures for very realistic trees and plants even
  close-up.  A variety of foliage is included and you can even create your
  own custom trees.

- The ability to render any number of DEM files in a single project -- even
  the entire earth!

- A coordinate system that knows the earth is not flat and always takes the
  curvature of the earth into account.  Mountains appear realistically from
  over the horizon as you move.  Orbits are automatic.

- LightWave 3D scene and object export for combining LW objects with WCS
  landscapes.

- WCS V2 even gives you the sun and moon!

Questar first developed WCS on the Amiga, we like the Amiga, and we are
continuing our Amiga support with WCS V2.  We also support other Amiga
developers by using Amiga software for business, graphics, manual
production and video editing.  We are proud of the advances made with WCS
V2 and we think it will make a great addition to your graphics software
toolkit.

We ask for your continued support of World Construction Set on the Amiga. 
WCS V2 Prerelease is now available through dealers and distributors.  If
your favorite retailer does not have WCS in stock, have them contact us:

The new owner of the code is David Dustin.  Dave lives here in
New Zealand not far from me and now has the code and is looking over it.

The previous sale is now null and void as I did not receive any
money from them in time.  The contract I signed with them means
nothing.  If anything should surface that is using this other code
then please inform me so I can put a stop to it.

Dave will write a bit in here shortly to inform you whats going on.

                       -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

>From Dave:

I have purchased the source-code and rights to further develop
`Virus Checker' by John Veldthuis, and pending final settlement,
hope to have a new version available within 4-6 weeks.

It will take me a while to familiarise myself with the code, and do
conversions to my system, but from the initial examinations I
foresee no real problems.


Some background information about myself:

I am a devoted Amiga developer, and have been since the A1000's
first hit New Zealand's shores.  I have owned pretty much all of the
Commodore range, and still use many of the machines.

I had been a registered developer with CBM since 1990, but have been
programming long before that.  I am proficient in Assembly, E, C/C++
and a number of "useless" languages.

Those who registered with John will still be classed as Registered
Users with me (once I get the list from John), but will require
"re-registration" with me, but at no cost.

More information will be made available in an announcment once I get
things worked out.

In the mean time, I would like to ask you, the users, to please
complete the following questions so that I may better understand
what is wanted from the future `Virus Checker'.

===========================================================================
                           Scala IRC Conference
===========================================================================

LOG from the IRC conference with John Chang, Tech Support Manager, Scala US. 
From Thursday 21'st of March 1996. Independantly organised

JPChang | Thanks to everyone for coming and waiting patiently.  As you may
   know, CeBIT closed as of yesterday.  From the few pieces of news, I
   understand that Scala was a big hit.  We'll see what the press has to
   say in the coming weeks and months.  A number of notable Amiga
   publications were in attendance.  So things are looking very good.
   Welcome all.  Thanks for coming back and glad you've been patient.
   That's it.  Let the questions, comments, complaints, ideas, begin!

Blast_SSP | Thanx for coming again Johnny first.  :) Sorry Johnny for being
   a bit off topic, but Dave Haynie...  What is his status ?  Is he still
   working at scala or has he resigned?  And to what platforms is Scala
   still doing MM/IC ?  Like what are you doing and what are you planning
   on doing?

JPChang | Dave Haynie still works for Scala and has no intentions of
   leaving.  There was some rumor running around that AT had offered him a
   deal and that he would be moving to Germany.  Not true.  He may do some
   consulting for AT on the side, but that's about it.  MM and IC is still
   available for the Amiga and of course, will soon be available for the
   PC.  Other platforms are being considered, but no decisions yet.  We
   still have low-level business activities with AT, but we may have to
   wait until the first prototype Power Amigas become available to port our
   new "BackBone" technology to the Amiga.  BackBone is our new and much,
   much, much improved software technology.

[Dave Haynie IS, and has been for months, a contract employee of Amiga
Tech.  His primary responsibility is helping AT define a specification for
a PowerAmiga.  He's doing it from the comfort of his New Jersey home.
-Jason]

NiteFlite | With Dave Haynie's involvment with the PowerAmiga, Amiga Techs
   development of the Walker and PowerAmiga, etc.  ...  is there a chance
   Scala will change their minds on this "wait and see" approach with the
   Amiga.  It sorta is a slap in the face.

JPChang | I don't see how its a "slap in the face".  We could conceivably
   do a port of BackBone to the ECS and AGA platforms, but by the time we
   release the software, most will be working with the new Power Amiga
   platforms.  Truthfully, we can't count on the existing market to cover
   the cost of R&D, marketing, sales, distribution and support.  Power
   Amiga, on the other hand, promises more.  Including cross-platform
   compatibility.  Please keep in mind that we are a business and we have
   comitments to our investors.  Also, some assume that Scala is very
   profitable, etc.  While I can't actually disclose numbers, this is
   simply not true.  We will continue to do everything possible with the
   Amiga market and work more dilligently with AT.

KarmaComa | Will there be a version of Scala with CyberGraphX support (or
   atlest not only 15kHz PAL/NTSC) for Amiga if you decide to stick with it
   (the Amiga)?  And; what's this about a Scala set-top box?  Info?  ETA?

JPChang | We've discussed this in prior IRC sessions, but the fact is that
   we can't do EGS/RTG support with the existing code that we developed for
   our Amiga products.  Its possible to do with our new BackBone technology
   and more than likely, will be possible with the Power Amiga platform.  I
   seriously doubt if we can do it for the existing ECS/AGA systems.

MrDaniel | Note: Scala runs in most AGA screen modes, even >15kHz modes. 
   Like for example DblPAL, Multiscan etc.

JPChang | As to the set-top box, we are writing the playback/authoring
   software for General Instrument Digicipher II box for Primestar.  A
   direct satellite service similar to RCA and USSB DirecTV.

Blast_SSP | It's me again Johnny :) This new Scala backbone...  Is it your
   plans on calling all Scala produced with the new backbone 1.0 again and
   so forward ?  Instead of continueing the 5.00+ version numbers ?  Why
   did you call the PC version 1.00?  Was it because of you see the new
   BackBone as some kind of a ReBirth?  :) Thanx for your answers :))

JPChang | It was marketing's decision to call it MM100, as it is the first
   version available for the PC.  Yes, it would be our first product with
   BackBone applied.  Also, it help tech support distinguish which product
   the user is talking about.  If he says MM100, we know he means the PC
   version, if he says MM400, then we know he's talking Amiga.

HeadQuake | Evening.  :-) PC MM100, compared to other so called MM
   authouring applications on Wintel machines..  what are the Scala
   advantages?  How will you market MM100?

JPChang | Well, first things first, it doesn't run under Windows, which has
   its advantages and disadvantages.  The advantage is that we can use the
   hardware much more efficiently, than Windows or Win '95 can.  All the
   wipes you expect of the Amiga, can now be applied to the PC version.
   Well, its reasonably close.  Nothing quiet performs like an Amiga.  :)
   The bad news is that we can't take advantage of all the Windows
   resources like MCI, DDE, OLE, etc.  Not that its a great loss in my
   opinion.  :) If you've played PC games, you know how fast and powerful
   the graphic speed and animation is.  As we all know, a Windows based
   application program, simply can't achieve that.  Simply because Windows
   limits these types of capabilities.  I believe Scala will be the first
   multimedia presentation program to take advantage of all these game
   graphic techniques.  MM100 and IC100 will come with literally HUNDREDS
   of wipes!  While the nearest Windows based multimedia app may give you
   at most, 100!  You can even create your own wipes, either using
   "Picture" wipes or using the scripting language.  As to marketing, well,
   considering that we don't have as much money as Microsoft, who does, we
   have to use gurella(sp) tactics.  We have to take advantage of the
   kindness of magazine reviewers, use the Internet and of course do as
   many "grass roots" campaigns at tradeshows, expositions, etc.

Blast_SSP | Ok.  here comes me again :) When will any new demo version be
   out for any platform?  When will any new VERSION be out on any plat-
   form?  What version number is it ?  When is MM100 out ?  And what's the
   pricing of MM100, IC100, MMx00 (Amiga) and ICx00 (Amiga) ?

JPChang | We're working on the demo version for MM100 for the PC.  It will
   be distributed throughout the Internet and we are thinking of doing a
   demo CD-ROM for in-store merchandising.  Both MM100 and IC100 for the
   PC, is expected to be released on May 1st of this year.  MM100 for the
   PC has a Suggested Retail Price of $249 USD, IC100 is $2,500USD and
   $1,000USD for the IC Player.  MM400 is $399USD and IC500 for the Amiga
   is $2,500 and $800USD for the IC Player.  You can find all of this
   information and more at our website at http://www.scala.com or
   http://www.scala.no.

MrDaniel | Tell us what happened after Rick Salmon plugged in his A1200 at
   the multimedia seminar in Washington DC, three years ago.  :) GA.

JPChang | Well, it was pretty neat.  Everyone turned around to see Rick
   plug the computer into the socket and the audio line-in jacks to the
   mixer and the composite output to the projector.  Rick already had
   "ScalaTime" set up on autostart.  So, you got the usual "This is a
   journey into sound...  After it was over, I think everybody was stunned.
   Then came some applause.  Then Rick proceeded to show everyone the power
   of the Amiga and Scala.  Like I said, in the newsgroup, Scala and the
   Amiga was the only one to get a near standing ovation.  :) Oh, yes.  We
   got plenty of inquiries.  :))

HeadQuake | How about TCP/IP support in MM100/(IC100) (?) Having one server
   (Pentium) doing CPU/disc work, and have many players/clients (486's). 
   Also, please tell us how a 'normal' working day for you at Scala US is
   like.  :) (a lot eh?)

JPChang | Yeah, all you need is to have the DOS based TCP/IP hardware/
   software and that's all there is to it.  Since it's peer-to-peer you can
   load/save to any drive, although we do assign volumes.  For example, if
   you have the server array, say 10 GB, called BFG and its assigned driver
   letter Z: You can set a directory by doing set scala_dir=BFG: Otherwise,
   you can do peer-to-peer by using ScalaNetto transfer files from BFG to
   the individual drives on the players.  My working day...  First thing in
   the morning is to go through my voicemail.  Do callbacks for the urgent
   ones.  I usually try to do a callback all at the same time, but many
   live in different time zones, so I have to wait for the Californians to
   have their first cup of coffee.  Then I answer eMail, newsgroup
   messages, America Online messages, CompuServe messages.  Then its
   whatever needs to be done during the day.  Which includes call in
   technical support, inside technical support (training), then projects. 
   Then there is the studying at night.  Gotta keep up with all the trends,
   new hardware, new software, etc.  Its a lot but someone has to do it.

Blast_SSP | Will MM/IC PC have some kind of dongle or other hardware
   protecttion?  Like the AMIGA version has ?  It has got to have some kind
   of protection right ?  Or will you maybe do SGI style protection?  If
   you know what I mean that is :)

JPChang | MM will not have a dongle, but IC will.

Blast_SSP | well I was wondering more about making some kind of SGI styke
   protection..

JPChang | No.  The dongle will be the standard ones like HASP and the like
   for the parallel port.

Harv | hey John Chang - did you work there when I reviewed the original
   Amiga Scala for .info magazine years ago?  (came in a green box with a
   guy climing up a ladder).  wonderd if you read my review.  :) feel fre
   to upgrade me anytime, John :(

HeadQuake | The ladder is still there. (MM400) :)

JPChang | I did read your review Harv, but I joined Scala shortly
   thereafter.  Erm I think it was June of '90.  Or maybe it was '91?
   eMail me your address Harv and I'll see what I can do.  :)

Spock | I have a wierd question here: Why can Scala MM300 run in one meg
   chip, 2 fast, but not 2 chip, one fast?  Also, what kinda fades do you
   get with 2 meg chip/020?

JPChang | Erm, I think its a memory allocation thing.  Also, if you attempt
   to run a 2MB wipe, it usually hangs or crashes.  :(

Spock | What kinda wipes aren't available with one meg chip I should ask.

JPChang | As to wipes with 2 MB, I think you get all of the "push" type
   wipes or any wipes that have two images up at the same time.  Erm, I
   think with an '020 or faster onboard, you get to use the "Ants" wipe and
   the "Dissolve" wipe.  More importantly, you get real smooth, no pause
   scrolls and stuff like that.

HeadQuake | Would MMU and/or FPU ever be of any use with Scala MM/IC ?

JPChang | On the current Amiga products, no.  No need for an MMU or FPU. 
   We thought about changing the code to support an MMU for virtual memory
   support, but found it was too difficult, rotten performance and very
   unstable.  Sigh.

MrDaniel | Assuming there will be a Scala PowerMM400, will it be fully
   multitasking with the Amiga, have a AREXX interface etc...  Or is
   Backbone a complete, "handle it all" operating system?

JPChang | No, no, BackBone will be complimentary to the Power Amiga OS.  
   So, you'll still have ARExx, clipboard, intuition, etc.  Keep in mind
   that BackBone is scalable, we can add or remove features as necessary. 
   As you may know, MS-DOS needs all the help it can get.  :), thus the
   robustness of BackBone, more specifically MMOS (Multimedia Multitasking
   Operating System).  With the Power Amiga OS, I suspect we'll use MMOS
   only to handle EXes and "glue" to the file system and graphics, but
   that's about it.

<question seems to be missing>

JPChang | Hiya Commando.  Umm, yeah it is possible to do scaling or zoom
   type wipes.  We can't make an image wrap around an object and spin away
   and stuff like that, but you will get real "fly-ons" and "fly-offs" and
   other really cool wipes.  If you get to see the PC version, you'll see
   the wipes that could be available for the Power Amiga version.  Which
   brings me to another subject, I wonder if the Power Amiga OS, will ever
   have a 3D chipset API (Applications Programmers Interface)?  Only time
   will tell.

HeadQuake | (CyberGraphics 3.0 (Amiga PPC RTG) will do 3D routines etc.)

JPChang | Ah, well that answers that.  Hmm, I'm sure we'll come up with
   some interesting stuff.

HeadQuake | Just curious John, WHY did you buy an Amiga?

JPChang | When I was younger, I wanted to get into advertising and I knew
   that computers were going to play a big part in that.  The advent of
   Desktop Publishing saw to that.  So, in 1985, look what was available? 
   There was the Mac.  Yeah it was cute, but had a small screen and was
   only in B&W.  Then there were IBM PC-ATs and the clones.  16 colors and
   lousy DOS programs.

@node FEATURE2 "The $5.00 Clock Fix"
@toc FEATURE

===========================================================================
           The $5.00 A4000 Clock Fix (A Tale of Joy and Sorrow)
   By: Craig Nori                                           cnori@usa.net
===========================================================================

I recently discovered that the clock on my A4000/030 was failing to keep
accurate time.  The following is the fix I came up with in order to correct
this situation.  BE WARNED!!  THIS FIX REQUIRES THAT THE SYSTEM BOARD BE
REMOVED AND SOME SOLDERING BE DONE ON THE BOARD.  NO WARRANTY IS IMPLIED OR
GIVEN AND ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE USE OF THIS FIX IS UP TO THE OWNER OF
THE BOARD.  IF YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE USE OF A SOLDERING IRON,
DON'T EVEN THINK OF ATTEMPTING THIS FIX!!!  ALL RESPONSIBILITY IS LEFT TO
THE READER!!!!  ANY REMAINING WARRANTY FROM THE MANUFACTURER WILL MOST
CERTAINLY BE NULL AND VOID.  IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU MESS UP YOUR MACHINE,
IT IS NO ONES FAULT, OR RESPONSIBILITY, BUT YOUR OWN.  If that hasn't
discouraged you so far, perhaps my experience with this fix will.  But more
on that later.

After pulling the top cover off, I got my trusty multimeter out and
discovered that the lithium battery, BT176, was dead.  I decided that
replacing the dead battery with the same type would only result in my
having to do the replacement again at a later date as the battery wore
down.  A better solution, I thought, would be to install a battery holder
for easy battery replacement.  The first step was to get the old battery
out in order to find a suitable replacement.  Understand that the following
steps assume two things.  First, you are going to use proper ESD protection
in doing this fix.  (If you don't know what ESD protection is, should you
be doing this fix?  Probably not.) And second, my 4000 doesn't have a
processor card plugged into the system board.  The 68030 chip is on the
system board so you might have to remove the processor card as well, at the
appropriate time.  This fix involves the following steps:

1. Remove the top cover.
2. Inspect for battery BT176. It is a silver coin shaped thing on
   the left edge of the system board just ahead of the mouse and
   joystick ports. Etched in the top is a big + (plus) sign and 3V
   meaning a 3 volt battery. If you can't find it as described,
   put the cover back on because these directions do not apply.
3. Remove the internal hard drive and cable.
4. Remove all Zorro cards.
5. Remove the riser frame. This is the strip of metal holding the
   riser card down. There are two screws, one at the front and back.
   NOTE the slots on the frame where it rests on the riser card.
6. Remove the riser card.
7. Remove the front panel.
8. Remove the front drive bay and cables.
9. Unplug any remaining cables from the system board.
10.Remove the 9 screws holding down the system board and remove it.
11.Get out your solder sucker and remove the battery from the system
   board. There are 3 connecting points.

After completing the disassembly, with the battery in hand, I headed down
to the nearest Radio Shack and found a coin type battery holder and new
battery for my ailing Amiga.  The catalog numbers for the replacements are:

Cat# 270-430 Battery Holder
Cat# 230-162 3 Volt Coin Battery

The cost to me was right at $5.00 USD.  The new battery is physically
smaller than the old one, but not to worry, it works GREAT.  The legs of
the new battery holder aren't a perfect match, so I CAREFULLY bent and
formed the legs to match the fresh holes made by the old battery.  The
orientation of holder is the + pins along the left edge of the system
board.  I soldered the holder in place, slipped the new battery into the
holder, and reassembled my Amiga using the above removal instructions in
reverse.  The new holder looked like it was always meant to be there.  I
reset the time, powered off the system and waited about 15 minutes to power
back up.  When I did the time was correct and it looked like another
successful repair was completed.  My clock was working and I now could
easily replace the battery in the future.

A happy ending you say?  I thought so too until I realized that my speakers
were making a faint whistling noise and all the lights on my external modem
were on.  I tried to get some noise from my speakers by firing up Octamed
Player.  It started up, then the system crashed with a GURU.  Needless to
say, my heart sank into my shoes, and a little tear started to form.  I
couldn't think of anything I could have done to cause such a disaster.  In
a panic, I raced into the next room and tore through several of my Amiga
magazines, searching the ad's for a price on new CIA chips.  My mind tends
to multitask better when I panic and several thoughts were going at once. 
Should I attempt surface mount repairs on my own?  Straight soldering of
the chips or surface mount sockets?  Where could I send off my Amiga for
repair?  Could I live without my machine during the repair time?  My cries
of agony caught my wife's attention.  After explaining to her what had
happened, she suggested that I take a deep breath, drink a beer, and walk
away for a bit.  Good advice, I thought, but then she is smarter than I am.

I took that deep breath and cracked a cold one.  Sitting and drinking, the
events of the project started stepping through my mind.  One thing I did
mentally note, as I was disassembling my machine, was that some of the
system board mounting screws were loose as I was removing them.  The plan
was to make sure that they were all tight during the re-assembly.  I wanted
to make sure they were, as this was important to the grounding of the
board.  And you know, the loose screws were in the same area as the CIA
chips.  My heart was working its way back up to knee level when I started
pulling everything back out of my Amiga.  When I got the system board back
out, I flipped it over and there it was.  On the land patterns near the CIA
chips was a small splotch of solder.  I carefully scraped it off and
crossed all fingers and toes as I put everything back together.  I powered
up and watched my modem.  One light on as normal, so far so good.  Starting
Octamed Player resulted in music coming out of my speakers.  In stereo!
Nothing was permanently damaged and it all worked out fine.

My theory is, that during the last days of Commodore, quality control was
not at a very high standard.  Perhaps the loosening of the system board
screws was an acceptable fix for a sloppy soldering job.  And my tightening
of the screws caused the solder to short the CIA lines.  At least that's my
story and I'm sticking to it.  Hardware hacking can be fun and rewarding. 
It can also be disaster and heartbreak.  Or in the case of this project,
BOTH.  Which brings me to the moral of this rather long tale: BE CAREFUL
and DON'T PANIC!  And if you must panic, as in my case, remember to step
away for awhile if things don't go right.  Lastly, BE CAREFUL.  Did I
mention you should BE CAREFUL?

===========================================================================
                           A TWIN APIW Overview
  Porter Woodward                     Porter_Woodward@internet.kronos.com
===========================================================================

[In recent times, quite a bit of effort has been expended by people who are
trying to figure out just how to use the very modular construction of
Windows applications to work to the advantage of the rest of the computing
world who would rather not run Windows itself.  One of these approaches is
outlined here, submitted for AR by an alert reader. -Jason]

There is currently an application out for some other platforms that is
called the "TWIN APIW" (yes I know it's a silly sounding thing).  It's
actually pretty remarkable.  It allows one to run Windows binaries on a
non-windows machine!  Yes, you read that correctly.

Currently they have OS/2, Macintosh, NetWare, and Unix versions
precompiled.  However, they are making the package available (both source
and binary) for personal/noncommercial purposes for FREE!  As you can
imagine, this has created quite a stir with Microsoft.

Although, many of us would deny it with our last dying breath that there is
nothing Windows can do that we would want to, this could be a major chance
for the Amiga, and other platforms in general...  A quote from their web
site might be useful, and better explain just what this thing is...

*******************************************************************
TWIN APIW Overview

Willows APIW Cross-Platform Development Kit (TWIN APIW) is a set of tools
and libraries that extends the number of platforms upon which Microsoft
Windows&trade; API-based applications may be developed.  With the TWIN
APIW, developers may now use a single set of sources to develop and deploy
applications for Windows, UNIX and the Macintosh.  Additional platform
support is currently under development, please contact info@willows.com for
additional information.  Portable Source code is available for TWIN APIW
which allows those that are proficient and interested to port TWIN APIW to
other platforms themselves.  Willows Software has programs in place to
assist those developers wishing to port applications, or the TWIN APIW
itself, to other platforms.

TWIN APIW includes the libraries and tools necessary to bring Windows
API-based applications and dynamic link libraries to alternative platforms.
The product includes debug and optimized versions of the library to help
you work in both environments.  TWIN APIW also includes shell tools to port
sources, resource compilers that allow you to include menus, bitmaps and
icons in an application and a module definition compiler for building
shared libraries. 

TWIN APIW Architecture 

Willows TWIN APIW is made up of three major components: 

     Willows Library 
     Willows Drivers 
     Willows Binary Interface 

The Windows compatible application interacts with the Willows Library the
same way that the application works in a Windows environment:

     calling API functions 
     receiving messages 
     loading resources 
     launching other Windows applications. 

The Willows Library interacts with the Willows Driver layer:

     making requests for graphical, window, or system operations 
     receiving responses or asynchronous messages. 

Existing Windows applications and modules interact with the Willows Binary
Interface to access the native implementation of the Willows API across all
platforms.  This layer accepts all Windows API requests to allow a
non-native application to achieve native performance.

TWIN APIW is capable of recognizing binary Intel objects such as
third-party DLLs, Visual Basic controls (VBX), drivers (DRV) and custom
controls.  This unique facility allows the inter-mixing of source and
binary modules within an application.  This feature allows developers to
bring their applications to market faster by not having to wait for the
third party vender to port the object to non-"Wintel" architectures. 
Resource files, bitmaps and icons may continue to be used without change. 
Applications may continue to load resource from existing DLLs, without
modification.

Features 

   Win-Help Support via TWINView
                             Multi-tasking

So, primarily it is a development tool.  However, if the Amiga was included
in this sort of initiative - developers could no longer keep claiming it is
too time consuming to _port_ to the Amiga.   Additionally, we could gain
the facilities to process Windows apps as "native" apps.

This is a powerful thing.  I urge the Amiga community not to pass up this
chance.  We won't loose our OS, but our OS will gain the capability to use
Windows stuff if we wanted to!  It would only strengthen the Amiga's market
position.

If someone asks, "Does it run Windows?" we can respond "Yes"

If someone asks if the Wintel box can run AmigaDOS, No.

We could gain an expansive, extensible system from this, and a level of
flexibility never before seen on any computer system.   Additionally, as
mentioned before, people could no longer claim they can't spend the time
and money to develop for the Amiga (serious apps only).

I think this news is too important to ignore.  For more, technical

@node FEATURE4 "Amiga Joker Survey"
@toc FEATURE

===========================================================================
                  Surprising results of a huge survey
 Ralph Debusmann                                       rade@coli.uni-sb.de
===========================================================================

German games magazine "Amiga Joker" (AJ) has recently made a survey about
their readers' Amigas, and the results of it are pretty surprising.  10000
readers took part in the survey of the world's biggest Amiga magazine.  The
first result of it was the release of "Primal Rage", which had been
postponed by Warner due to considerations that not as many Amiga owners as
necessary have 2 Megs of RAM.

As not all results of the survey are of interest for a international and
non-AJ-reading public I'll only give you the (IMHO) most important and
surprising facts.

- most readers have an A1200 (54%), 12% possess a new Amiga Technologies
  (AT)-A1200.  43% own an A500(+) or A600, 9% have an A2000 and about 10%
  have an A4000.  Dunno where the CD32-owners are, I guess they had to pick
  "A1200 w/CDROM" on the chart ....

- very few readers are interested in buying an AT-A1200 in the near future
  (5%), but 35% are interested in "coming models" like the new Amiga
  announced on the AT-webpages "http://www.amiga.de" - 23% even say they
  are not only interested but *plan* to buy a "coming model".

- Only 7% of the readers also own an PC-clone.  This supports my opinion
  that many Amiga owners only still cling to their Amiga because they have
  not seen and played about with today's PeeCees too much.  If they did,
  many would already have left the Amiga in no time (especially when it
  comes to games) :-(

- another interesting figure is that 67% have their Amiga for over a year.
  But (to my surprise) there are also 33% who have recently bought one.

- 46% of the readers claim themselves to be "advanced", 38% even say they
  are "experienced".  Only 16% are "novices" :) I guess we are lightyears
  ahead of Peecee-people in this aspect.

- 54% claim to have more than 30 originals, 28% have up to 20 originals
  (the rest has up to 5 or up to 10)

- most prefered genres are: strategy (73%), adventures (60%) trading (54%)
  and "3D-dungeons" (D**m-alike, 53%).  I think these are more German
  preferences, as I guess players in the UK prefer footie-sims and arcade
  games.  

The remaining breakdown by category:

Action (47%)
Sports (46%)
Multiplayer (42%)
RPG (37%)
Technical Sims (36%)
Arcade (28%)
Thinking (16%)

- 96% of the readers buy their games after reading the magazine (AJ), 63%
  support their "opinion-building" by reading the reviews in concurring
  magazines.  33% claim their opinion influenced by adverts, 42% also buy
  by "mouth propaganda".  This somewhat implies -> bad reviews -> bad
  sales!  I guess this wouldn't be so drastical if we had more and better
  game demos like the PeeCee-crowd has.  This virtually always sucks on the
  Amiga - we get too few demoversions and if we get them, they are often
  too short, just one level or so to get a real impression.

- 84% buy their software via mailorder, only 56% buy in shops, only 7%
  claim to get pirated games.  This number seems to be not too
  representative IMHO :-(

- To the most important part - the configuration of the readers' Amigas
  ...

42% have a CD-ROM (mostly double-speed), 26% plan to buy one
86% have a HD, 4% plan to buy one
9% own a graphic card, 5% plan to buy one
16% own a HD-floppy, 18% are interested in one and 4% plan to buy one
35% own a joypad
82% have upgraded their memory, 7% plan to do this soon
(50% have 4 Megs, 30% have even more mem)
42% own an accelerator card (mostly 030s), 21% plan to buy one 
88% own a second floppy

So, please make your own conclusions after reading this.  For me it is
astonishing that 86% have a HD and 82% have expanded their memory, and that
not only from 512KB to 1M in their 500 ;)

That's one reason for games like "BIING" being such a huge success in
Germany (it required more than 3 Megs of mem and a HD).  Also please note
that in the near future 68% will have a CD-ROM and 63% an accelerator card.
And please think about how much more people would upgrade if enough great
games would force them to!

My conclusion is that for Germany, probably the biggest market for Amiga
software, you could go along well with games on CD-ROMs or at least
HD-only-games which also require extra mem.  THERE IS A MARKET!  And I
repeat, if for example "Day of the Tentacle" would be ported or TFX the
number of reasonably upgraded Amigas would increase even more.

As a small addition I'd like to add the present game sales-top ten in
Germany:

1. SWOS 96
2. Obsession
3. Gloom Deluxe (020 needed)
4. Breathless (AGA needed)
5. Worms [2 meg CHIP highly recommended]
6. Soccer Stars
7. XTReme Racing (AGA needed)
8. Super Tennis Champs
9. Flight of the Amazon Queen
10. Black Viper

Where at least number 3 and 4 demand a bigger machine than the stock A500.
See you can actually SELL AGA-titles if they are good enough.

In the UK HMV-charts SWOS also is No.1, Worms No.3, followed by a big bunch
of Playstation titles.  So in the UK the situation doesn't seem to be as
good as in Germany.

I wouldn't conclude that this is situation is like paradise.  We all know
that 030s aren't state of the art (to express it carefully).  But hey,
these figures are MUCH BETTER than I supposed and I hope this will change
the minds of game company bosses a bit.  It has already changed Time
Warner's minds :)

@node REVIEW1 "Review: Blizzard 1260 Accelerator"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                   Review: The Blizzard 1260 Accelerator
  John Scotto                                           jscotto@wazoo.com
===========================================================================

The Blizzard 1260 is an accelerator for the Amiga 1200 built by Phase V
Digital Products of Germany.  It is distributed by Softwood in the United
States.This is (to my knowledge) the first Amiga 1200 accelerator utilizing
the Motorola 68060 cpu.  The 68060, for the non-technical among us, is
Motorola's answer to the Pentium.  The 1260 as I received it has a surface
mounted 68060 clocked at 50 MHz.  The board also has a single simm socket
which accepts one 72 pin simm.  Due to the very small size of the board and
the angle at which the simm lies, only single sided simms can be used
according to the manufacturer.  The board has one jumper which is used to
enable/disable remapping the kickstart roms to fast ram.  There is also a
connector for Phase V's scsi connector which was not yet available as I
wrote this review.

My overall impression of the board's construction in favorable.  The 1260,
unlike many A1200 accels, fits fairly easily into the "belly slot" of the
A1200.  The simm socket is an easy to use standard connector and is fully
auto-configuring.  The board does come with disk which has a new 68040
library and a 68060 library.  There is also an installer to put these into
the appropriate directories for the user.  The manual suggests installing
the software and ram before the board is connected and that is what I did.
The trickiest part is still physically connecting the accelerator but as I
alluded to there is enough spare room to allow the user to push the 1260 in
without too much trouble (one only need open the belly slot not the 1200's
case).  Excluding manual reading the total time for installation was about
five minutes at the end of which my system was configured thus:

  A1200 with OS 3.0
  850 meg IDE hard drive(internal)
  High density floppy (internal)
  Blizzard 1260
  18 megs ram (2 chip/16 meg simm on 1260)

And away we go.....

In a nutshell this thing is fast.  I was previously used to a 68030@50 Mhz
which is no slouch but the 1260 made the machine visible faster at booting,
starting programs and executing instruction.  Measuring just how fast is
somewhat of a problem as there is no Amiga benchmark utility which
understands the 68060.  However, for those of you who want benchmarks here
is what Sysinfo 3.23 says:

  38.9   mips
  27.89  mflops
  8.05   times the speed of an A3000/030@25MHz
  2.04   times the speed of an A4000/040@25MHz
  30.62  times the speed of a basic A1200
  *cpu is read as a 68040@392 MHz*

The last line should indicate that Sysinfo results are to be taken with a
grain of salt.  My subjective opinion is that Sysinfo underrates the
68060's performance.  As I was unable to get AIBB 6.5 to run without
crashing the machine, thats all I've got for the bean counters out there. 
Now I'll give the less precise measurements of system performance that have
convinced me that Sysinfo is wrong.

Once installed my boot time went from about 15 seconds with the '030 to
about 5 seconds.  As I call up a number of progs on start, to include Magic
WB, virus checkers, a commercial cd filesystem, mouse utility and etc.,
this was fairly impressive.  Final Writer 4.01 loads in a second or two
even when called via ToolsDaemon (which adds a small delay) and seems fully
compatible with the 1260.  Final Calc results are the same.  I tried three
web browsers (AWeb, IBrowse and AMosaic) and each worked well with AWeb
fairly leaping along with the 1260.  Even a cumbersome program like Thor
operated visibly faster.  Gloom operated very well and was exceptionaly
smooth in full screen, maximum resolution mode.  Aladdin AGA and a pd game
called Parrot Island required the 060 be disabled in order to run (did I
forget to mention that you can fall back to 020 via a key combo at startup?
:^) Finally came the big tests.

I am not a graphic artist and do not "render" anything on my machine.  I
have no LightWave comparisions to give you but I do have both PC-Task 3.1
(reg) and Shape Shifter 3.3 (reg) on my computer.  To my mind the 1260
would be made or broken by how much it helped me effectively use my
emulation packages.  First PC-Task - this PC 80286 emulator was useable but
dreadfully slow on my 030.  Now with the 1260 Windows 3.1 boots as quickly
on my 1200 as on my laptop (DX2/50).  Word 6.0 takes only a few seconds
longer on the 1200 than on the laptop.  Nothing earth shattering but very
respectable for software emulation.  In short PC-Task on the 060 is very
useable and acceptably fast.  Second - ShapeShifter 3.3 - this Mac emulator
ran fairly quickly on 030.  Now it runs even more quickly (surprise).
Operations seemed to occur about as quickly for me as on my friend's
Quadra.  In 16 color mode cpu operations are swift but there is a
noticeable lag caused by screen updates since the Amiga's graphics chips
are not affected by the cpu upgrades a point I will return to later.  I did
have make one change to my Shapeshifter configuration.  I cannot get the
utility PrepareEmul to work properly if called in my startup-sequence - it
endlessly loops.  I now must call it via a shell and thenlaunch SS.  Aside
from this quirk SS seems to work as well as before but considerably
quicker.  In short I am well pleased with my emulation capabilities now
that the 1260 is installed. 

In summary the Blizzard 1260 is well built, easy to install, transparent to
use once the included software is installed, and generally compatible with
my software at least.  The exceptions that I have noted above are both
games.  If you want speed this provides it in spades.  What it does not do
is change the AGA chip set's capabilities.  If your primary need is more
colors on screen this board will not help you.  If you need computing power
the 1260 is for you.  I like this board and consider it money well spent. 
Ahhh...he finally gets to price.  Yes I have avoided this because in the
realm of Amiga speed has always been expensive and there does not seem a
rhyme or reason as to how to gauge relative value here.  Suffice it to say
that you can expect to pay $900.00 (US) + shipping costs.  If all you need
is a little more speed to play Gloom thats pretty expensive.  If you want
to build a powerful rendering farm then its cheaper and faster than an
A4000.  If you are like me - well I've gained a fast Amiga, a faster Mac
and a reasonably fast PC to boot!  You draw your own conclusions.

Now I realize this is not an exhaustive trial such as a professional
reviewer would do.  However, I believe that I am an "average user" or at
least reasonably so and that the subjective view is what most people want
anyway.  Mips, mflops and megahertz do not mean much to most users and I
have tried to give my first impressions to other "average users".  In the
ensuing weeks I will keep testing the 1260 for compatibility with more
software and some hardware too and will send the results to AR (if they'll
have any more from me that is).  I leave you in the hope this has been of
at least peripheral value to you.

@node REVIEW2 "Review:  Personal Suite CD-ROM from Cloanto"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                Review: Personal Suite CD-ROM from Cloanto
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

It STILL amazes me how far the Amiga CD-ROM industry has come in just a few
short years.  Besides the largely failed CDTV experiment, there seemed to
be some Fred Fish disk collections...and not much else.

Then, spurred in the commercial market by CD32, and by Aminet CDs on the
compilation side, things began to take off.  The art of the shareware
CD-ROM has been pretty well explored, by Aminet, Fred Fish, and others such
as the Meeting Pearls crowd.  On the other end of the spectrum, we've seen
multi-disc collections from Almathera.  Games are still released on both
floppy and CD format, although CD32's premature demise as a going concern
has curbed the expansion of gaming CDs.

Now, slowly but surely, CD-ROM is finally gaining the sort of legitimacy
for commercial applications that it has enjoyed for years on other
platforms.  A major step in this direction is the Personal Suite CD-ROM
from Cloanto, the shining beacon of Amiga development in Italy.

Personal Suite sets out to be just that--a collection of utilities an
individual user will find a great deal of use for.  Headlining the CD are
the "Personal" applications: Personal Paint 6.4, Personal Write, and
Personal Fonts Maker from Cloanto and Personal SBase 4, from Oxxi.  Also
included are a set of Kara fonts, Cloanto's DirDiff tool for watch-dogging
and protecting extremely large file copies, and the PNG datatype.  To round
out the CD, a collection of Amiga artwork and animation is supplied, as
well as some classic novels, which have all of a sudden become a very
popular item for CD-ROM compilers.

Personal Suite ships in a container very much like a film can--a metal tin
just big enough to hold the CD.  No paper.  All documentation is online in
AmigaGuide format, in the Big Four Amiga languages, English, German,
French, and Italian.  The majority of the books are in English, with a
small assortment in Italian.

It is the hope of any CD such as this to be more than the sum of its parts.
But to understand if this is the case, it is best to take a look at the
parts first.

Personal Paint 6.4
------------------

Clearly, the headliner of the headliners.  Personal Paint has come a long
way, and it is essentially the only game in town for 8-bit (and below)
paint applications that is still undergoing development, DPaint and
Brilliance being abandoned programs.

PPaint is, at heart, a paint and animation program with a great deal of
features.  Most notable is support for a wide range of filetypes for
loading and saving (including datatype support under OS 3.x), and the
built-in image processing features, allowing any one of a great deal of
present effects or programmable convolves to be applied to an entire image
or any user-definable area, a process as easy as picking an effect and
"lasso-ing" a region.

The new version provides support for graphic cards through the display
database, and I was considerably impressed by its performance on my Retina
Z-III running CyberGraphX.  The speed, and solidity of the display, was
astounding.

In addition, the new manual offers helpful tips and tricks for Amiga
artists, including advice on dealing with the varying sizes of pixels in
the Amiga environment versus the rest of the world.  PPaint allows you to
force square pixel usage.

Such features as multiple-level undo, built-in virtual memory, and the
DPaint-paradigm multiple function buttons (filled/unfilled objects, for
example) are all welcome.

PPaint alone pretty well makes the CD-ROM worth the price of admittance.

Personal Write
--------------

Personal Write is an odd one.  It is billed as a word processor, but to my
mind it fits better in the category of text editor.  Still, few text
editors allow flexible Postscript output and rudimentary grammar checking.

I suppose what throws it off is a total lack of WSIWYG.  Instead, a display
very much like that of the text editor of your choice greets you.  But
PWrite allows mail merging.

The interface clearly hearkens back to an era of OS 1.3, despite the
updated 1995 copyright notice.  No concept of a display database exists,
instead you can choose to toggle interlace, A2024 mode, and the like.  I
did find that a forced promotion to a 640x480x16 CyberGraphX screen worked
acceptably.

PWrite isn't really as comfortable to use as most text editors.  For
example, text highlighting is not done by merely clicking and dragging, it
is a mode that must be toggled.

The one saving grace of PWrite is its ability to translate ASCII data into
a number of international and cross-platform modes.  It's worth a look, but
it won't be the document generator of choice here any time soon.

Personal SBase 4
----------------

Oxxi software has become pretty hard to get a hold of lately, so a line on
one of the few databases for the Amiga is a worthwhile cause.  Like Twist
2, and unlike Final Data, SBase is a relational database.  In
oversimplified terms, this means that data in one file has access to data
in another file, which can be used interactively and cooperatively in such
applications as forms and invoices.

There's a lot of learning to do if you're going to get a relational
database to jump through hoops for you.  Still, the potential to do some
great work is there.

The manual includes a guide to get you up and running somewhat comfortably
in 15 minutes, but that's only the beginning.

Personal Fonts Maker, Personal Fonts Maker 2
--------------------------------------------

PFM pretty much announces what it is--a tool to generate your own bitmapped
fonts.

Not being a typographer, it's admittedly difficult for me to comment on the
relative usefulness of such a program.  I've always been quite happy with
the existing wealth of fonts, but can see the appeal to having access to
modifications.

PFM2 adds color capabilities and the ability to use a larger (in fact,
unlimited) bitmap.  Unfortunately, it is hardcoded for AGA, and will not
promote to a CyberGraphX 256 color screen.

PFM similarly suffers from being built from an old interface, however.  It
does not properly promote.

The neatest, and highest-level, tool is the Printer Driver Modifier,
allowing you to mess with escape codes sent to your printer.  Use only if
you know what you're doing.

A number of fonts are included as object lessons and examples, and for your
general use.

Artwork, Books, PNG Toolkit
---------------------------

Any artwork collection with Eric Schwartz in it is ok in my book.  Of
course, you'll want to check out the E. S. Productions CD-ROM for the
complete story.  Legendary Jim Sachs is featured, as are Karl Bilheimer and
Dr. Chip.

The books?  Classics are great.  AmigaGuided in one big file for your
reading pleasure.

PNG is the GIF-replacement standard Cloanto helped develop after the GIF
patent fiasco of recent times.  It is only fair to credit Cloanto for the
amount of work put in documenting the various unsavory actions of Unisys
and Compuserve throughout the GIF saga, encouraging the support of a new
standard.  Both the datatype and a developer's kit are included.

The Verdict
-----------

Personal Suite street-prices around US$70 (or about UKP 50).  What are you
getting for that price?  In all honesty, two high-quality productivity
packages, one of which (Personal Paint) is a very mature and powerful piece
of software.  SBase is showing a bit of age and disrepair, largely where
the interface is concerned, but is still a useful package.

You get two commercial applications which, while useful, have definitely
seen better days.  Personal Fonts Maker is functional and really can be a
useful tool, and while Personal Writer is worth a look, it won't be
superceding Digital Quill any time soon.

Kara fonts are nothing to sneeze at.  Consider yourself lucky to have
access to them.

Rounding out the CD to a comfy 646 megs are the additional artwork, fonts,
and books.  No complaints here.

Top that with an AmigaGuide interface linked to the applications, full
manuals in multiple languages, and it seems to be a steal.  It is.

My hat is off to Cloanto for paving the way for more CDs of this quality.

                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Ah, it's good to ramble once more!

As of late, I've been playing lots of games on Kevin Kralian's Apple2000
emulator--long out of development, but still a very stable piece of work.
Right now I'm building a career as an Allied Intelligence Agent in Beyond
Castle Wolfenstein.

But that hasn't taken up so much of my time that I haven't had a chance to
check out some other offerings in the emulation world.  A wealth of new
8-bit machine emulators are out there just dying for a mention.

TRS-80 Model 3 emulator by John Fehr
------------------------------------

Like all good emulators, this was a study in nostalgia for the author.

The TRS-80 Model 3, a favorite of hardware hackers, is one of those
machines just on the edge of the computer explosion in the early 80's.  In
this day and age, however, it is implemented as a "virtual screen" on an
NTSC High Res screen, where you are free to assign up to four disk drives
(virtual, of course) to load up DOS and various programs.

Like most 8-bit machines out there, the support on the net is growing and
if you do a little digging, you'll be sure to find a treasure trove of
software just waiting for you on an FTP site.

The emulator also has the interesting distinction of being the first
emulation ever implemented on a BeBox.

Atari800 by David Firth
-----------------------

Actually a port from the Unix version with some minor changes, Atari800 is
a fairly complete, but very resource hungry emulator of the Atari 800
computer, long hailed as an early work of Jay Miner's genius.

Unfortunately for Amiga users, the translation from high-power Unix
workstation to Amiga desktop computer leaves the Amiga starving for more
horsepower to keep up with the C-compiled program.  Even though it seems to
properly promote to CyberGraphX modes (providing some speed improvement),
on the 030/25 A3000 it is so slow as to be unusable.  An 040/25 under AGA
is little improvement.  There was the signs of potential when we tried it
out on a Draco, however.

The 800 is such a neat machine I picked up one for my very own recently,
for a blowout price.  It never got the widespread support of the Commodore
64, but has a lot going for it, including being the platform that spawned
Alternate Reality.

I have made some inquiries with the author as to the possibility of
integrating an assembly 6502 emulation into the emulation to provide a
speed burst, but to date nothing has come of it.  The entire source is
available in the package, however, and I welcome anyone who will take it
upon themselves to either further encourage Mr. Firth to enhance the Amiga
version, or to make the changes themselves.

David Firth can be reached at david@signus.demon.co.uk.  The Atari800
emulator can be found in:

feel bad if you don't get in first try.

A-CPC by Kevin Thacker
AmiCPC by Ludovic Deplanque
---------------------------

The Amstrad CPC line was quite popular, apparently, in the UK.  Being an
American, I've never physically laid eyes on it...which makes it all that
much more appealing to have it as an emulator, since it's a machine I may
never get to touch but through the magic of software, it lies at my
disposal.

Both programs set out to emulate this machine.  A-CPC allows for the 464,
664, and 6128 configurations (with enhanced model support in the registered
version), and AmiCPC emulates a 6128.

Seeing that I am at a disadvantage when it comes to information about this
machine, I instantly prefer to use Mr. Thacker's program, as it is far
better documented in English.  Only minimal documentation in English is
provided with AmiCPC, although more comprehensive (or at least longer)
information is provided in French.

Both authors advise the use of at least an 030 processor, although A-CPC
allows for 68000 users at their own risk.  

My experience on an 030/25 tells me that while I would be more comfortable
with a faster processor, I'm not too badly off.  However, mode promotion is
not very healthy for either emulator.

A surprisingly large collection of software is out there on the net for
these machines.  Definitely worth a look.

Amoric by Jean-Francois Fabre
-----------------------------

When I started to get interested in emulators, one of the appeals was the
ability to run new software for current platforms, such as the Mac.
Another was to recapture lost youth through C-64 and Apple II emulators.
But when I came upon the Sinclair Spectrum emulator, I realized there was a
very important third appeal--using machines I might never have a chance to
use elsewhere.

I briefly commented on this in the CPC section, I know.  But with the
Spectrum and the CPC, I had at least remotely heard of the machines in one
passing form or another.  But I had never in my whole life heard of the
ORIC Atmos, the machine emulated in Amoric.

From what I've gathered from Mr. Fabre's testimonial and my own experience,
the Oric is roughly analagous to a middle ground between a Vic-20 and a
Spectrum.

The Oric is a fun little machine, in the Z80/AY-3-8912 vein like its
contemporaries, the Spectrum and Amstrad.  

(As an aside, does anyone have any theories or explanations as to why
European 8-bit computing seems to have revolved around the Z80 while
American 8-bit computing revolved around the 6502/6510?)

Amoric includes a method to pull Oric software off of the original tapes.
In addition, a large archive is floating around out there for the picking.

The Oric is an interesting cultural study if nothing else, as it was a very
French phenomenon.  Personally, I don't associate the nation of France with
computer gaming much, but here you have it.

The emulator itself seems quite stable on a number of programs.  I find the
interface a little uncomfortable and am disappointed in the lack of
promotability, but you can't have everything, I suppose.

Amoric is available on any Aminet site, misc/emu.

The author can be reached at fabre@cert.fr.  An Oric web site can be found
at http://arlesienne.ensica.fr/LOCAL/ORIC/

Ah, there you have it.  Four new 8-bit machines to emulate away on.  I know
they'll keep me busy for quite some time.  Into the Eagle's Nest, anyone?
How about some Cabal?  Or I could just go back to Hitler's bunker one more
time...

                Review: Shapeshifter 3.4 by Christian Bauer
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

I really have no excuse for not getting to this sooner.

ShapeShifter, in just one short year, has become the new de-facto standard
for Macintosh emulation on the Amiga.  And really, it only took a few
months.

When released by Christian Bauer last year, ShapeShifter sent shockwaves
through the Amiga community.  A shareware Macintosh emulator?  The full
version a mere US$50 or so?  No hardware to buy, and it works more or less
as well as Emplant?

Yes, really.  And since that initial release, ShapeShifter has paved the
way for the continuance and spread of Mac emulation on the Amiga.  At the
same time, its open architecture has encouraged third-party developers to
improve on it.

ShapeShifter consists of a shareware demonstration program, offering all of
the features of the main program except one--the ability to use whole hard
drive partitions as Macintosh partitions.  This is a notable restriction,
as this is the fastest method of access, but not an insurmountable one, as
SS supports the slower "filedisk", a large AmigaDOS file containing a
virtual partition.

To function, ShapeShifter requires a 512k or 1 meg Mac ROM image.  While
virtually every Mac has a different ROM, ShapeShifter supports most of the
flavors, and these ROMs can be found on currently used 680x0 Mac
models--meaning there is not likely to be a supply shortage any time soon.

Unlike the Emplant, no direct hardware method is provided for imaging the
ROMs in the Amiga itself.  Instead, the legal theory is that you purchase
the ROMs and take the image from a real Mac using the included utility.  In
effect, your purchased ROMs are the "legitimacy" for ripping the ROMs from
an office machine or the local computer store.

ShapeShifter, like other multitasking Amiga emulators, requires a special
boot program to remap a small section of memory.

SS allows the configuration of one or two monitor use (if you have an
external graphics card).  It allows you to use the Amiga Workbench (largely
for show, as it is not a very fast option), a standard ECS or AGA
screenmode (rather slow in more than 2 colors, more so than Emplant was),
EGS or CyberGraphX.  In addition, the specification for an external video
driver is included, and to date there have been several, including one
speeding up AGA performance (at the cost of additional fast RAM) and one
allowing use on an A2410 card.  The Amiga pointer can be substituted for
the Mac's.

ShapeShifter supports Amiga high density floppies as Macintosh compatible.
Some problems have been reported with the Dell high-density floppy, but
when CrossDOS 6 is present (as is recommended for proper Dell use), these
seem to clear up.

SS allows the use of a direct SCSI connection for CD-ROMs and the like.

Memory constraints are similar to those found on SS's predecessors, Emplant
and A-Max IV.  Count on losing a few megs to emulation overhead.  In
addition, 040+ users are strongly nudged towards using the 1 meg ROM.
Graphics cards require fairly large allotments for proper buffering.  Under
all these circumstances, therefore, consider 10 megs of RAM to be a
functional minimum.

Direct Amiga serial and parallel support is available, as is the ability to
use Amiga networking hardware.  It is even possible to run MacTCP in
conjunction with AmiTCP, but I have not personally attempted this.

In action, ShapeShifter floors me.  To be fair to Emplant, SS is not as
impressive as Emplant is in native Amiga screenmodes, except monochrome.
But once a graphics card is added, SS really shines.  The continuing
support and expansion of ShapeShifter to accomodate more cards and more
systems has been quite impressive, however, in stark contrast to the
"Emplant PCMCIA" fiasco.

One of the real benefits to being a ShapeShifter user is the ready support
found worldwide.  A number of "starter filedisks" exist, including the
freely distributable System 7.0.1 and 32-bit extension, to get novice users
up and running with minimal fuss and without having to deal with floppy
headaches.

As ShapeShifter has recently become Draco-compatible, it seems only fair
that the benchmarks should be reserved for such a copious display of power.
At this time, our Draco benchmarks are not yet available, however.  We hope
to have them ready soon.

If you're at all interested in Mac emulation, you owe it to yourself to
check out ShapeShifter.

   The Creative Magic of Ron Thornton:  Spacecraft Surfacing Techniques
  Bohus Blahut - Modern Filmmaker                          Bohus@xnet.com
===========================================================================

Part II

In issue #4.04 of Amiga Report we began the review of this two videotape
set.   The first tape: Spacecraft Model Design, is a two hour video
tutorial hosted by Ron Thornton, president emeritus of Foundation Imaging.
This first tape stays primarily in LightWave 3D's modeler, and outlines
techniques in constructing a Babylon 5'esque spaceship.  The tape does an
excellent job of leading the intermediate modeler through steps to get a
render-efficient, yet good looking model.  The tape also sets up video #2
in the series: Spacecraft Surfacing Techniques.  Does tape #2 live up to
the quality of the first offering?

The answer is a resounding "yes".  All that's laudable in the first tape is
in ample measure in tape two.  Thornton uses Photoshop and LightWave on the
PC to create all of the surfaces for the model, but what's important here
is not the software or the platform, but the techniques that he shares.  I
was able to complete the spaceship using a combination of LightWave 3.5 and
4.0 for the Amiga along with ImageFX 2.1 to replace PhotoShop on the video.
I'm fairly adept with both softwares, but for those who aren't, I'll
include some Photoshop to ImageFX jargon conversions in this review.  A
future article may include all of the changes that I made to the video's
techniques to accommodate Amiga users.  I used an '060 DraCo with 32 megs
of RAM to run both softwares at the same time.  (gotta love that
multitasking.)

Included with both tapes is a helpful guide card that lists the topics of
the tape in order along with real-time counter information.  For those of
you using a real-time VCR, simply zero your VCR's counter at the beginning
of the tape, and you'll be able to whiz to specific references according to
the card.  For those of you who lack this VCR feature, it's useful at least
to know what order things go in for when you are scanning through the tape.

As I suggested in my last review, skim the tape first without actually
sitting at a computer.  There are a few occasions where Thornton's
surfacing goes in a specific direction, with no explanation, but is usually
explained a few minutes later on the tape.  To avoid these kinds of
creative surprises, have a good general knowledge of the flow of the tape
before you even warm up the computer. 

There are two major components in any 3D model: the object's geometry, and
the object's surface.  LightWave takes a different approach to surfacing 3D
objects than other major softwares.  Many other pieces of software
incorporate surfacing design into the modeling stage. 

Once you've constructed your wireframe object, you use surface tools in the
software's modeler to apply surface color and texture.  The drawback to
this approach is that often you cannot see how your model will interact
with the lighting in your scene until you actually import the model into
your scene and render.  If there are any modifications, you must bring that
model back into the software's modeler, and go to work.  This also makes it
difficult to get a "feel" of how your models look together in an
environment until you actually bring everything together in the software's
stage layout.

LightWave allows you to apply surfaces in the Layout portion of the
program.   This makes tweaking easier, also allowing you to see more
quickly overall adjustments in the scene's environment.

If you were to look around yourself, you could categorize every surface of
every object that you see (note to Mike Danger: how DO you do it, man?) by
it's color, it's diffuseness (the way that light plays across the surface),
and it's specularity (it's shininess).  There are several parameters to
surfaces, but Thornton uses these three elements alone to get a gritty
"mech" spacecraft look.

At Foundation Imaging, they know the value of being frugal with system
resources.  Though they have replaced their Amiga network with many high
powered PC stations now, there's no reason to be wasteful.  Efficient
models mean more time to experiment and be creative, more time to render
longer and more intricate scenes.  Those of you with '030 machines will
appreciate Thornton's approach to render-friendly modeling. 

Thornton chooses a good order to accomplish tasks in this video, in that he
starts with the most intricate tasks first, to build up the user's
technique.  We spend a good deal of time in the creation of the first
imagemap.  Later elements build on these techniques, and so Thornton makes
the most of our time together by glossing over points that would be
redundant.

Since much of the model is composed of structural primitives (simple shapes
like tubes and cubes), much of our surfacing work will involve creating a
flat image in a paint program, then bringing it into LightWave and wrapping
it around a cylinder or a box.  We start, though, with one particularly
tricky part to surface in this model: the wing section.  This part of the
ship is a metaformed pair of wings and rear fuselage.  Metaforming is a
fantastic modeling tool introduced in LightWave 3.5.  It allows one to take
simple shapes i.e.  a few boxes, and smooth them into organic shapes.
Effectively it's like placing a hard geometric object in a wind tunnel, and
wearing it's edges away. 

While surfacing the wing, I found several flipped polygons in the wing's
modeling.  Polygons, when flipped, don't render correctly, appearing as
holes in the finished product.  I used some techniques that I learned from
the first tape to rectify this problem.  In Modeler, pick a few polygons in
the wing, then click OPTION- SEL CONN [select connected].  The whole wing
section should be highlighted.  Click POLYGON- ALIGN and this will flip all
polygons the same direction.

If you were to create a square shaped mech surface for the wing, it would
get hopelessly distorted when applied to the wing shape (square peg, round
hole, etc.).   This is why Thornton uses the model to determine its
surfacing.  By facing the wing section towards Layout's camera, we can get
a good idea of the wing shape.  Also, be setting the Camera's zoom factor
to a huge 70, we can see the model with no perspective distortion.  We
render this out and save to disk, then load up this template into ImageFX.

In the spirit of efficiency, this model doesn't use any 24 bit textures.
It gets its rich look from a pair of 256 grey scale maps, and a four color
image.  Theoretically you could complete this model using an ECS amiga with
Dpaint III, but I wouldn't recommend it.  AGA Dpaint will probably do the
job, but I heartily recommend that you use ImageFX.  Its combination of
image processing, and superlative paint and touchup tools make this
surfacing biz a polygonal piece of cake.  In several ways, I was able to
actually improve on Photoshop's techniques due to dedicated tools in IFX
(Kermit, are you listening?).  In fact many essentials that Thornton
accomplished through multiple menus seemed downright awkward compared to
the few keyboard shortcuts that I used.  Of course, I am much more familiar
with IFX than Pshop, so this may be an unfair comparison.

Once loaded into IFX, we begin by breaking up the wing into squares that
will serve to look like panels.  A point that Thornton stresses is that
many 3D artists just slap panels down anyplace, and that makes their models
look very plastic.  As he stretches the straight line tool, he goes into
some of the reasoning and design behind his choices in panel placement.
Once the wing is divided into logical panels, he uses Contrast and Value
adjustments (like on your TV) to alternately lighten and darken various
panels.  I expanded on this technique by occasionally putting a subtle
gradient in a panel, and also playing around with the ROUGHNESS slider in
all of IFX's paint tools.  This gave the effect of a mottled panel that
perhaps had been replaced, and was made from different metal than the rest
of the ship. 

Once the panels are divided up, Thornton uses some brushes he created in
Pshop to airbrush streaks of dirt onto the model.  Here's one way to
achieve these streaks in IFX.  Go into a blank buffer in IFX.  Load one of
IFX's included brushes into the buffer as a picture.  Let's use the
soccerball (football for you purists) as an example.   You'll note that
it's a little greyscale picture on a black background. 

Now load up a picture of some kind, and load the soccerball as a brush
using BRUSH- LOAD BRUSH.  Click in the picture somewhere.  You get a
stamped version of the picture that you saw earlier, a soccerball on a
field of black.  Now choose the AIRBRUSH drawing tool (it looks like a
spraycan), and pick a red out of your palette, and stamp the brush down. 

Now there's a red soccerball in your picture.  Adjust BLEND and ROUGHNESS
sliders and take note of the effects that you get.  Here's how it works:
the greyscale brush acts a sort of alpha channel.  White (RGB 255, 255,
255) areas of the brush receive 100% of the paint color that you've chosen.
As areas of the brush get darker, those areas receive less and less paint,
until you reach black.   Black (RGB 0,0,0) areas receive none of the paint
color and are effectively invisible. 

A clear example of this is the IFX brush "big ball".  This is a circular
gradient that is bright white at the center, and gets darker as it radiates
outward.  This is the basis of the IFX technique for making streaks. 

In PALETTE, create a grey scale palette that starts at white and SPREADS to
black.   How many steps this range should be depend on how subtle you want
the steps between colors to be.  I found that around 8 steps was
sufficient.  Highlight one end of this color spread, and with the RANGE
cycle gadget set to R1, click RANGE then click the other end of your color
spread.  You'll see little pips appear in the colors in your range, and now
this particular color spread has the identity: R1.

Double click on the corner of the CIRCLE TOOL that contains the FILLED
CIRCLE.   This accesses every draw tool's options.  In the TYPE: gadget
select GRADIENT fill, and if it's not already selected, choose R1 as the
range to use.  If you make a long thin circle, you'll see the outline of
the circle, and a line attached to the pointer.   You can imagine your
cursor as having the leftmost color of your range attached to it.  (Many
users mistakenly believe that the lightest color is always assigned to this
gradient placement selector.  Calling it a 'hotspot' indicator is a
misnomer.) The palette "reads" from left to right, and so colors in a
spread that are to the left are "first".  In our case, we have white
attached to our cursor.  In this scenario, your mouse click will be the
point of purest white.  Other colors in your range will radiate out from
your click point until you reach black. 

In a smallish buffer (I used a black buffer that was 30 x 10 pixels) create
a long thin circle that stretches off of your buffer, so you have the
bottom half of this thin circle on your buffer.  Click the cursor at the
top of this half circle, and you'll have a gradient that is white at the
top and fades to black as it stretches to the bottom. 

Make several of these in various thicknesses and lengths.  Again, you may
want to experiment with various settings in the ROUGHness slider.  Crop
these little buffers close to the streaks without actually chopping into
the detail that you're creating.   Pick them up using the scissors tool,
and save them as brushes using the BRUSHES- SAVE AS BRUSH menu item.  If
you skim the tape, you'll notice that Thornton uses a big blob (similar to
the "big ball" brush mentioned earlier) to depict engine dirt on the wing
section of the craft.  I used a combination of "big ball" with a blob that
I made, combined with the included brushes "sponge" and "smoke".

Once you've created these dirt streak brushes, apply then with the
airbrush, and a black palette color.  I also recommend that you turn the
BLEND slider in the AIRBRUSH options (double click spraycan) down to
between 20 and 40%.  This allows you to have subtle variation with the same
brush through multiple clicks.   Load your streak brushes into IFX using
BRUSH- LOAD NEW BRUSH and choose between them using BRUSH- SELECT BRUSH. 

You can use Thornton's technique of selecting regions on your wing section,
then airbrushing dirt onto these stenciled off areas by doing the
following.  In your region selector, choose whatever type of region you
intend on using i.e.  BOX and select a region in your picture.  In REGION
OPTIONS check off "ENABLE PAINTING", and paint away.  In order to choose
your next region, you must go back into REGION OPTIONS and disable "ENABLE
PAINTING" before moving on.   This range selection- masking- painting-
process will grow into an efficient routine that will become second nature
by the time you've finished this tape. 

Another time and labor saving technique is to work on only half of the
texture map, then mirror it where it is symmetrical.  It obviously depends
on your needs, but for most people, the repetition in the pattern will
hardly be noticeable while the model is in motion.  One could also mirror
the partially finished panels, then work on each side individually to yield
at least some time savings.  Once you have your greyscale paneling and
dirtying down finished, you'll save this as you diffusion map.  This tells
LightWave how light will play across your model.  Darker grey areas will
appear to be darker in color and so on. 

One could place this greyscale picture directly onto the model, but by
having the map reside in the diffuse channel, this means that you can
choose any color or combination of colors for the surface color, and still
retain all of the detail of the specular map.  Thornton takes advantage of
this to add some pinstriping to our model.  Another advantage is that if
you want a whole fleet of these ships, you can have a single diffuse map
loaded into LightWave's memory, but have several different 4-color maps
applied to the various ships in the scene to offer a sense of variety.

The Diffuse Map also acts as a guideline for the Specularity Map.  Thornton
shows you how to take the Diffuse Map and heavily contrast it to yield the
Specular.   LightWave's Specular channel allows you to load an image map
onto a model that controls how shiny a model will be.  Brighter panels will
be shiny while the dark dirt streaks will be matte.  Thornton even goes
through including little white dots throughout the model that will appear
as very shiny.  Though almost imperceptible to the eye, the mind will pick
up on these little flecks of shininess as parts of the ship that have
little dings and dents and flecks of paint missing.

Once you've completed the wing's surfacing, you have the knowledge of the
techniques to finish the rest of the model.  Thornton makes rather short
work of the rest of the model.  It'll still take the modeler some time to
create all of the image maps featured rather quickly in the rest of the
video.  Not to worry, Thornton does give the viewer intermediate screen
shots of his work, along with periodic color renders, so that the viewer
can follow along. 

Once finished with the custom image mapping, the rest of the task is left
up to the LightWave modeler's best friend, Fractal Noise.  This creates the
overall metallic grit on the rest of the model fairly quickly.  Though only
a 90 minute tape, these techniques will make good on the viewer's in-depth
investment of time.  Though I'd set aside a morning to follow these
techniques, I spent the better part of a day exploring these methods in
other types of modeling.

Again Desktop Images delivers a fantastic instructional tape at a knockout
price.   I'm only sorry that it's over.  I'd love to see a tape that dealt
purely with the basic aesthetics and design topics only touched upon
briefly by Thornton in these tapes.   Other good topics, especially if one
could get more presenters of the calibre of Ron Thornton, would be 3D
cinematography, effective lighting, special effects, and perhaps more
intermediate modeling that isn't targeted specifically toward making
spaceships.

This is a hearty recommendation to the modeler looking to increase his
professional and personal modeling to get these tapes now.  As I mentioned
last time, I'll post a picture of the completed model on the Web.  I don't
intend to release my LightWave model of the ship because I think that the
LightWave community would benefit greatly from every modeler making their
own version of this ship.  Instead of littering AmiNet with multiple copies
of the same ship, let's try to create new and exciting models using these
techniques and share those instead.   I can hardly wait to see the first
non-spaceship non-submarine application of some of these techniques.

===========================================================================
                     Review: Zoom FaxModem V.34X
  By Jeremy Nixon                                    jeremyn@injersey.com
===========================================================================

How do you choose a modem?  How do you even tell the difference?

There I stood, in Computer City, staring at a wall of modems.  I wanted a
28.8k, V.34, external modem.  At least half the options qualified, with
prices ranging from about US$150 to $300.  Anything over $200 was
immediately ruled out.

The "helpful" sales associate informed me, quite seriously, that it is
"impossible" to use a Mac modem on a PC, or vice versa, regardless of what
sort of cable you have.  "They just don't work that way--they have
completely different programming."

I thanked BrainBoy for his help and sent him on his way, daring not mention
that I have neither a PC nor a Mac.  The sales staff, apparently, was not
going to be of much help.

After much box-reading and option-weighing, my choice was the Zoom FaxModem
V.34X.  I have to admit the reason was a combination of price and nice
packaging.  I paid US$169, on sale; the price was listed (in Computer City)
at $199.

The modem doesn't come with a cable, so I had to get a 25-to-25 modem
cable, too.

SPECIFICATIONS

As you probably know, if you read the specs on any six V.34 modems, you
will begin to have a sense of deja vu.  The Zoom supports all the stuff
you'd expect it to support: speeds up to 28,800bps.  V.34, V.FC, V.32bis,
V.32, V.22bis, Bell 212A, V.22...well, you get the point.  Fax (Group 3,
Class 1 and 2) up to 14,400bps with V.33, V.17, and on and on.  Flow
control with RTS/CTS, XON/XOFF, etc.  DTE speeds up to 115,200bps.  Auto
speed sensing.  V.42bis and MNP5 compression.  MNP10EC error correction.  
Non-volatile memory.

About the only thing it doesn't have is built-in Caller ID.  You can get an
upgrade kit for that, though I don't know what it entails.

You also get several blank disks--er, I mean, free offers from online
services, including AOL (of course), Compuserve, and GNN.  And some DOS
software, in case you've got a PC sitting next to your Amiga.

INSTALLATION

Quite easy.  Plug the modem cable into the modem, plug the other end into
your serial port, plug the power cable into the modem, plug the other end
into an outlet, and you're off.

DOCUMENTATION

The Zoom comes with a nice manual of 56 pages.  Parts of it deal with
installing the internal version into a PC and thus can be skipped.  You can
also be walked through the procedure of choosing an init string, in case
you're not familiar with AT commands.

The ten-page troubleshooting section seems comprehensive, though I haven't
had to put it to the test.

You also get a nice chart of AT commands, including the modem's default
settings, which comes in handy if you already know how to use them and just
need to look one up.  And beginners will welcome the six-page glossary of
terms.

One interesting fact about the manual: nowhere does it specify what kind of
modem it's talking about.  The word "Zoom" appears only in a line-drawing
of the modem.

GETING UP AND RUNNING

I don't know if this is unusual, but the Zoom worked perfectly the first
time I tried it.  I looked through the manual and assembled an appropriate
init string for Term (AT&F&C1&D2W1), set my serial port speed for 38400
(more on this later), dialed, and there was my UNIX account.

For PPP, I used the same init string, changing the &D2 to &D0, which
assumes the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) is on.  That worked just fine, too.

The only problem I encountered was when using PPP, and I've seen several
questions relating to this on the newsgroups.  When you first power up the
modem, several lights come on, one of which is CD, for carrier detect.  I
believe this to be a byproduct of the default &D0 setting (which can be
changed).  When you attempt to start the PPP device, it dumps out with an
error.

I found that starting Term, and allowing it to send its init string to the
modem (with the &D2), the CD light would turn off, and I could then quit
the program and use PPP.  A better workaround would be to change the
modem's default settings, but I use my UNIX shell account about 95% of the
time anyway, so I didn't bother.  The point is, if PPP gives you an error,
look for that CD light.  This isn't a problem specific to the Zoom, of
course.

PERFORMANCE

I'm pretty happy with the Zoom's performance.  But, as with any modem, you
have to set your DTE (computer-to-modem) speed on your serial port to a
speed your hardware can handle in order to obtain the best results.

On my machine, the best speed I can get is 38400bps.  If I try to drive the
modem any faster, the transfer rates drop like a brick, because the Amiga's
serial hardware just can't handle it.  I suggest you try a variety of
speeds to see what your machine can do; I've heard from several people who
can use 57400 just fine, and one who can even use 115200, though on an
Amiga I'd have to see that to believe it.

Basically all I use the modem for is to call my Internet provider, and I
almost always get a full 28800bps carrier with the Zoom.  I should note,
however, that I have very good telephone lines in my area.  I once also
used it to call across the country (California from New Jersey) and I got
28800 then, too.  The slowest speed at which the Zoom has ever connected is
26400bps.

Driving my serial port at 38400, my Zmodem downloads and uploads range from
2900-3700 characters per second, using the "sz" and "rz" UNIX programs in
my shell account, and xprzmodem.library in Term.  I don't know what
accounts for the differences in speed--it could just be usage load at my
ISP.  The absolute fastest download speed I've seen on a file of reasonable
size was about 3950 cps.

Bumping my serial port speed to 57400 makes these numbers drop to about
1400-1500 cps.  115200 is almost unusable.  However, this is not at all the
fault of the Zoom, but rather the outdated serial hardware in the Amiga.

The Zoom also supports faxing.  I don't have fax software, or access to a
fax machine to test it with, so I can't comment on it.

THE BOTTOM LINE

I am very happy with the Zoom.  I was able to plug it in and forget it
(until I wrote this review, at least) and it gives me great performance for
a competitive price.  So go ahead and buy one.

@node REVIEW7 "Spreadsheet Faceoff: Final Calc vs. TurboCalc"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
          Spreadsheet Faceoff: Final Calc vs.  TurboCalc, Part 1
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

It really makes me proud to see things like this--two application programs
in honest competition with each other, in an area not traditionally
"Amiga".

Until I found out, not so long ago, that spreadsheets could really do some
fantastic stuff, I could have cared less.  But now I know better.  While
they're not necessarily indispensible tools for everyone, you may be
surprised to find out what you really can get done.

It's only fair to take a look at the two big players in the market right
now, TurboCalc 3.5 from Digita and FinalCalc 1.03 from Softwood.  And it's
only fair, given the complexity of the programs, to split up their
evaluation over a few issues.

This time around, I'll deal with some basic interface issues and cover the
tutorial aspects of each program.  In the future, some of the unique
features, shared strengths, and individual weaknesses will be revealed.

TurboCalc 3.5
-------------

TurboCalc needs little introduction.  It's been bouncing around for some
time now, most recently as an extremely low-cost CD-ROM in version 2.1.
Recently, Digita acquired the English language publication rights,
presumably to solidify their position as a full-service Amiga application
company.

To settle you into using a spreadsheet, the manual covers the basics--how
to get around, how to use cells, and the difference between relative and
absolute addressing.  It also talks you through a short demonstration.

Of more interest is the included tutorial script, which upon loading takes
the user through the basic financial appliaction outlined in the manual.

Once through that example, you're more or less left to your own devices to
explore the dozens of sample projects in the package, some of which
illuminate very basic concepts (how to get an X/Y graph to look right),
others which add programming commands to the toolkit, and even a project
which allows you to play Connect 4 against a friend.

The sample sheets often could stand a bit more explanation and
documentation for first time users, and I found the occasional usage of
German commands internally where the English command was explained to be
confusing.  Still, they do a good job of exhibiting the power of the
system.

The GUI is very tight and efficient, with flexible coloration, font
selection, and screenmode support.  As a rule, it is fairly responsive,
although some scripting jobs cause pauses and flashes that get distracting.

Final Calc 1.03
---------------

Softwood isn't a stranger to the Amiga applications market, but Final Calc
is a relatively new entry.

Based on years of work by Khalid Aldoseri, who developed it to assist him
with his business, Final Calc brings a lot of high-end performance to the
Amiga.

It does so in a fairly stark style, however, at least for starters.  Its
default opener on an NTSC: High Res screen took me slightly aback, as did
the gunmetal grey color scheme.  A little quick work in Preferences got
that sorted out, but it does lack a bit of elegance.

On the other hand, nobody uses a spreadsheet because they're attractive.

After a brief overview of the nature of spreadsheets, Final Calc's manual
delves into issues of tools and applications.  The tutorials come as a
collection of sample projects--not nearly as many as TurboCalc, but
interesting in their own right.  They show off Final Calc as a number
cruncher with several real-world applications (such as generating calendars
for any month, any year, with any day of the week as the first position).
The most interesting project is the graph demo, which includes dozens of
graphs generated on a large data set, to show off the power of Final Calc
in creating presentations and displays.

Like TurboCalc, the more intricate coding aspects are not entirely
explained as this goes on.  You do get a definite feel for the power of the
package, although more samples would have been nice to have.  And the
manual is always available to describe the commands more specifically.

Final Calc also comes with a tool that is becoming popular in many
different applications--a "crash recovery" program, which actually searches
through memory not corrupted by a reset to try to locate FinalCalc project
data.  This could come in handy if ever a random guru knocks you out just
as you are about to save.


While neither Final Calc nor TurboCalc take you by the hand and parade you
through their entire set of options, they do have intelligent and helpful
introductory projects.  Next time, we'll take a look at what happens when
you actually start USING them.

                          UUDecoding Amiga Report
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

                      Amiga Report Writing Guidelines
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

     4.  Please send us your article in ASCII format.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.

Please stipulate as well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to
the editor.

                  Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users
===========================================================================

                The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
                  "Not just another UNIX Shell account!"

          -------------------------------------------------------

Portal is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-service online SIG
(Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users.  We promise, and WE
DELIVER ongoing & aggressive Amiga support!  Now, more than ever, with so
many Amiga magazines gone or shrunken, you need a viable,
professionally-maintained resource for information, software, and a link to
the world-wide Amiga community.

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in many ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA high-speed modems (you pay for the phone call
if it's not local), or though any SprintNet or Compuserve indial anywhere
(with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell service!  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help, and you can easily customize
it for your favorite terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1100 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files or
      100 email letters at once, of any size, with one command.
 * Amiga vendor areas with many companies participating.
 * So many incoming lines you'll probably NEVER get a busy signal
 * 40 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 12,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.
 * Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
      related and get quick replies from the experts.
 * Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, AMosaic, LightWave, ImageFX,
      Picasso II & others feed right into the Zone message bases.  Read
      months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with them.
 * FREE unlimited Internet Email with 5 meg of free storage.
      Your email is private, secure, and never censored or monitored.
 * A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.
      You can run AMosaic and other Browses via your shell and explore the
      vast World Wide Web!  Intermediate to advanced users can use
      any standard UNIX mail and news utilities, compilers, and other
      tools.  Ask for your free UNIX book when you sign up.
 * A home for your own Web page!  Your UNIX Shell on Portal is linked
      to Portal's Web Server. Create your own WWW pages for the whole
      world to access. No extra charges!
 * Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which you can read
      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine. Newsgroups are not censored!
 * Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
      never worry "Ooops... Am I paying more for this area?" again!
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS wrapped into user-friendly
      menus.  And you get FREE unlimited usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
      email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
 * Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
      at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
