===========================================================================

February is lumbering its way to a conclusion that can come only too soon.
Not only is the weather miserable, but the Amiga ownership question has
been hanging in the air for some time now.

The question is out of my hands, and out of yours as well, I'm afraid.
It's in the hands of Mr. Hembach, Escom's trustee, his lawyer in the US by
the name of David Robinson, and the parties bidding for the Amiga, only one
of which (QuikPak) has actually stepped forward and publicly announced
their intentions.

I had a talk with Mr. Robinson a short while ago.  He was willing to
confirm QuikPak's bid but unwilling to speculate or reveal the identities
of whatever bidders there might be.  (I wasn't really expecting him to, but
these things are worth trying once.)  Various rumors abound, of course,
and have been given shreds of credibility by various Amiga luminaries.  But
if I've learned anything, it's not to put any stock in these things until
someone is willing to face the music and own up to their actions, it's not
worth worrying about.  Mr. Hembach has set a goal of a purchase resolution
by the end of February, but he has made no promise to that effect.

Meanwhile, the rest of Escom is being sold off.  Notable in the outcome is
the formation of "Commodore" in the Netherlands, by none other than our
friend from the Commodore auction, Bernard "Ja, ja" van Tienen.  Mr. van
Tienen has formed a group which purchased Escom NL and a portion of Escom's
properties, including the Commodore trade name for their PC clone line.
Just a further indignity for the name which once stood for computing
innovation.

As I survey the Amiga landscape, I see quite a bit that makes me proud.
That so many have stuck with each other through difficult times is truly
encouraging.  We've had a good deal of help along the way from companies
who recognize the market waiting to be amazed.  And while everyone has
been told they need to wait "just a bit longer", that saying applies even
today.

Wait for what?  That's the question, of course.  The successor technologies
seem to be moving along (PIOS, A/Box, etc.) and it seems reasonable to
assume that the Amiga properties would likely only be valuable to someone
who would make something productive out of them.  (A reliable source
indicated to me that a clearance warehouse put in a bid for the Amiga
assets, but since their primary interest was the value of the merchandise,
their bid was too low for Hembach and thus was rejected.)  But unless
you've got tens of millions of dollars, you will have to wait with the rest
of us to see how this situation is resolved.

Until that happens, relax and enjoy this, the second issue of AR's fifth
year of publication.  As ever, we'll keep you up to date, and immediately
release a special issue when we have confirmation of the Amiga's latest
ownership destination.

-Jason

PS: comp.sys.amiga.announce finally has a new moderator (Thanks to Stuart
Tomlinson!) which has certainly caused a large flow of news to Amiga
Report.  Things should settle back to normal as he gets caught up.

Subject: Dec '96 Amiga Report

Hi Jason,

I am the president of the Interior Alaska User's Group and have been an
Amigan since I excitedly bought my first A1000 right out of the delivery
van in 1985.  Since then I have owned almost evry model (mutant models not
withstanding), and some of the side trips such as CD32.  I have been an
active member in user groups since my C64 days before the 1985 awakening. 
I have worked as an Amiga repair technician for an Amiga only store, and
for the past 6 years had my own Amiga only home business helping other
Amigans with repair troubles and just general assistance.  I have
personally sung the praises of the Amiga throughout the years and have
introduced many current Amiga owners to the machine (including a large
chunk of our current User's Group which was all 8-bit until I landed up
here in the great white north).

This information is given to you so that you have an idea that I'm not an
Amiga virgin just bursting on the scene and then becoming disillusioned.  I
am an Amiga fanatic!  I'm also the System Administrator for a large Novell
4.x network with a G6-200MHz machine on my desk and many "toys" to play
with.  To this day it amazes me how I can use all that power at work and
still enjoy my Amiga at home (I do not own a Intel-based system at home).

The Amiga is simply the most elegant OS of all time!  It has so many
benefits over the MS-Sloth machines that it frustrates me to rantings that
the rest of the world is blind to this fact (just ask some folks I work
with;)).   Unfortunately the Amiga is starting to feel the ravages of time.
I'm writing this on a damn flickering screen Amiga 1200.  So many things
about the Amiga are really starting to drive me away from it and this makes
me more mad.

The lack of closure to this bankruptcy thing has already cost the Amiga
support of almost every major software company we had.  Thank goodness for
companies like Softwood, Oregon Research, etc...  for sticking with us for
so long.  I'm genuinely afraid that if something doesn't get settled soon
there may be no recovery.

I applaud the new systems like A/Box for trying to fix the problem, but
unless the Amiga community declares the Amiga dead, the A/Box may just
serve to split an already weak support structure.  At this point, if the
A/Box becomes a reality fairly soon, I'm ready to make the jump minus a
compatible Amiga OS, as long as the same things that made the Amiga great
are somewhat recreated...

Why did I write this?  Just letting steam off I guess.  I'm ready to move
to a new system, but like others I don't want that new system to have a
fruit on it, and an Unintel Inside system is not what I want either.  I may
have to work with them, but they can't make me own one!

So where does this leave me?  Still waiting...  and waiting...  and
waiting...  It seems as though the light at the end of the tunnel is an
oncoming train.  Let's hope it's a train we can all get a ticket on, and
not one that will drag us under as it goes by.


-    The issue of fragmentation of the Amiga market by machines such as the
     A/Box, PIOS One, etc. is a very difficult one.  There are some in the
     Amiga community who feel these machines should be embraced as
     legitimate parts of the Amiga's journey, and others who think they
     should be utterly verboten subjects in an Amiga publication such as
     this.  Right now, AR is taking a "watch and see" approach to these
     machines--it is clear that these machines are in need of a user base
     of the caliber of the Amiga's--but then again, the Amiga needs that
     user base as well.  Personally, their very existence is a heartening
     thing for me if for no other reason than it means there are still
     new ventures unafraid to stand up to the WinTel hegemony.  Alternative
     Computing Now!  -Jason

Subject: Capital Punishment

Hi Jason!

I wanted to purchase Capital Punishment, but I won't be able to do it
legally because of the violence and because of Demonia character.

I'm living in Vietnam and we shouldn't be more than 2 Amiga users here.  So
I must order everything by mail, and the customs check EVERYTHING!

This country has a new policy to fight against the social evils that
include sex and violence.

I hope they can make other games that don't give so much trouble to be
purchased.  I know that this game won't be imported for nearly the same
reason.

Cheers,

Fabrice

-    Hmmm.  Not much that can be done for Fabrice, unless someone knows how
     to smuggle small packages into Vietnam.  It's really a shame since on
     the grand scale of things, Capital Punishment isn't that bad.  -Jason

From: Jon Klooster <matix@netspace.net.au>

Hi there all,

Once again I am drawn to write to what seems to be the only magazine that
captures the heart and soul of the Amiga spirit.

Right down to the `Something in the way she moves..' (which is written
somewhere when you buy an A2000 complete from the box, no screwdrivers
required - first 2000 correct emails will get a smiley!  )

Over and over I get subjected to pc's and their non-doorstop uses, and
every so often I wonder if it would be worth my while to just get one
instead of converting documents and spreadsheets to and from the formats
`they' use for my use at home.

But once I visualise setting `them' up, and trying to use them and `their'
100Mb help-systems which need online-help to use them, and not having a
sub-15 second startup-sequence, and no more scripts to easily set up
assigns for a game or complete programming environment, and the way `their'
installer programs drop their sh*t everywhere, and to use a certain game
you have to modify your startup then reboot, then do the same to get your
sys back when you've finished playing,..  And did I mention real
multitasking, which `they' almost manage to fake.

Sure they may be a bit faster on certain stuff, but I have at least a one
minute head start every time I switch on my machine.

And that one minute for me is the bestest time in the whole world, because
I know that there is not a single pc out there that can give me that
minute, just the way my Amiga can..

-     Well, other than liking to read a good compliment, I'll let this go
      without further comment. :) -Jason

Hello,

I just read about AR making a slow change to HTML.  I don't mind the WWW
but I also don't really use it a lot.  I prefer AmigaGuide style of
reading.  For a few reasons.  AG is easier to pull up, doesn't require the
memory that HTML does (load in the Browser, then read), & AG most people
prefer.  I'm a Top Uploader on a few AMIGA boards here...I get stuff from
Aminet & send to them.   Many of those people aren't on the Net yet & some
don't want to get on it at all.  So if AG format it "killed" then it won't
continue to reach everyone.

Just some thoughts from a dedicated reader.  Thanks for AR, Jason, it's an
excellent Mag. ;)


-     We'll likely keep making an AmigaGuide version available, but the
      prospect of running multiple mailing lists is pretty daunting.
      - Jason

                            --- --- --- --- ---

From: "Lau W.Nielsen" <LWNielse@post6.tele.dk>

Hello Jason!

First, thanks to you and the rest of the staff for making such a great mag!

The first thing I would like everyone who reads this to do, is go pick up
an old computer/electronics magazine.  You know, the really old kind that
you can bring to the toilet without having to buy a laptop.  You should
look for one that is dated somewhere around '85-'87. 

Found one?  Good, now start searching the pages for words like 'amazing',
'new' or 'fantastic'.  When you find one of these words start looking at
what it is that is described by those words.  On one of the pages you will
most likely find a mention of a new computer system that everybody wants. 
Yes, chances are that you will find the word 'Amiga' mentioned in the
article you just found.

Now start reading.  Read really careful.  Read exactly what it is that is
so incredible about this new thing.

Finished reading?  Great, now write down everything that the article
mentions as being new, innovative or just plain fantastic.

You should now have a list of some of the things that made me buy my
computer.  It was things that was impossible to do on any other computer at
the time, things that were so new and innovative that today the others are
still not completely up on the same level.  Winslows 95 claims to be the
worlds best operating system, and many people agree with that.  Not because
they are stupid, they just don't know any better.  We know better.  We can
do things on our Amigas that they will never be able to do.  Or so we
thought.  They, and all the competing systems are catching up, and they are
getting closer each day.  Still, they don't have things like ARexx, but
that is maybe just because Bill Gates think that Winslows users are just to
stupid to use such a great and useful system...  or maybe he just haven't
got the kind of vision that makes such things possible.

We have.  We still have.  That's what makes us stand out from the others. 
We can actually think for ourselves.

In the next century I want to be able to say the same thing, that I just
said.  I can think for myself.  I can't say that, and then sit down and
turn on my Intel-based machine, and wait 10 minutes for Windoze 2000 to
boot.  Instead I want to sit down and turn on a machine that represents my
will to not be controlled by people who thinks they know what is best for
me.  I think many Amiga users feel the same way.

The name of the machine i want to use isn't really important.  I don't care
if it says 'Amiga' on the front.  But I do care about the ideas behind the
machine.  The Amiga is the best machine I know of, the represents this
idea.

We all know that it isn't doing too well these days, and if we want it to
survive something has to happen soon.  I know this has been said before,
but it is getting more and more true each day.  So where should it go?  The
most important thing is the question of custom chips or not.  I want the
computer to be able to do things the others can't do.  Go back and look at
the list you made earlier, that was what made it special.  Standard chips
will not be special, the others have them too.  If we want a new computer
(Amiga or not) as the successor of the current models, and we want it to be
based on custom chips we have very few options.  There is the AAA, the
3D-RISC and Phase5's A\BOX.  AAA and 3D-RISC are not being worked on, not
finished, and are already old.  And I doubt if AAA would keep up with the
new standard chips.  So we have only one left: the A\BOX.  If Phase5 can
keep their promises about this computer, then it would instantly, the same
day i is released, make everything else old, slow, expensive and obsolete,
just like the A1000 did.  It can do things the others simply can't do.  And
much cheaper.  According to Phase5 they are working on this right now.
Forget starting to develop a completely new chipset -we don't have the
time.

In the last couple of years we have not seen much serious, expensive,
kill-the-others type of development in the Amiga hardware field.  And now,
finally, someone does it.  I support this 100%, and hope that you will do
the same.  We need something new that will take the Amiga a giant step in
front of the others.  If the A\BOX is realised, then i wonder if we really
need the 'old' Amiga anymore.

The AT sale has already taken much too long, delaying the Amiga technology
development for far too long, for it to make a serious comeback in it's
present form.  A new 68K Amiga will be the death.  It's simply too small
today.  Noone, except amigians, will buy a computer that runs a 50 MHz
'060, when they can go down to the local PC store and buy a 200 Pentium for
less.  I am not pessimistic, though it may sound like that.  The Amiga can
make a comeback, but only if the A\BOX hits the market this year.  I don't
see any point in wasting more time discussing how to bring the 'real' Amiga
back, it ain't going to happen, it is too late.  But if anybody feels like
proving me wrong, please do so, but do it NOW!

I wish all of you a good year, and I hope that this time next year we will
all be using big powerfull PowerAmiga's.

   Lau W. Nielsen, somewhere in Denmark.

===========================================================================

Copyright 1997 David Prime


During the past few years of turmoil, Amiga users and Amiga publications
have become increasingly focused on the financial and technological status
of the Amiga marketplace.  What seems to be foremost in Amiga users' minds
is concern over who will own the Amiga.  Following closely behind is
concern over software development and future technological improvements of
the Amiga platform.  Although I share an interest in these important
issues, I feel that more attention needs to be paid to the reason people
bought Amigas in the first place.  To use them.

My motivation for writing this arises from my own increased use of my
Amiga.  For the past few years time pressure from work and university
allowed me only limited opportunity to use my Amiga for the things I bought
it for.  My computing activities have, for the most part been restricted to
word processing and internet access.  In 1996 this changed.  During the
past year I completed two projects for which my Amiga was not only well
suited but actually had advantages over a Windows or Mac machine (although
that's not the point - just an extra bonus).  The first project was the
creating of a computer based presentation and measuring system for my
psychology honors project experiment.  The second was the creation of a
video project which my brother gave to his friends as a Christmas present.
The success of these two projects has inspired me to start several new
ones.

The increased use of my Amiga has also led me to reflect on my long
experience with computers and why they fascinate me.  My first exposure to
computers came in elementary school with a Commodore PET.  I was attracted
to it instantly, even though all you could do with the machine was play
games and program (more games of course).  I also desperately wanted to own
one.  I couple of years later my parents bought me a Commodore 64 and
entered the world of personal computing.  Over the years I have read about
or encountered people who have used their computers in many interesting
ways.  A small example of these uses include educational uses, various
artistic projects, desktop video, control of household electrical
appliances, live multimedia presentations, video projects, model train
control, computer aided design (CAD), scientific calculations, medical
imaging and astonomical telescope control.  This list could be extended and
elaborated on to an almost infinite degree.

The moral of this story is that the uses a computer can be put to is only
limited by the creativity and skill of the person who uses the computer.
The quality of a computer is a measure of its ability to allow users to
achieve their goals.  The best computer is the computer which is best used.
For these reasons I urge Amiga users to share their experiences with the
Amiga community.  Do you use your Amiga for an unusual application?  Is
there so project you are particularly proud of?  If so share your
experiences with the rest of us.  Demonstrate your techniques.   Show how
you overcame obstacles.  Do you have unsolved problems?   Maybe someone can
help.  There are many ways you can contribute your ideas and experiences. 
You can submit articles to Amiga Report or other publications.  You can
give demonstrations at local user groups.  You can contribute to Usenet
discussions.  You can upload resources to the Aminet.  You can set up a web
page.  By communicating your knowledge and experience you will inspire
others to attempt new things.  You will educate Amiga users to get more out
of there machines.  This can only be good for the Amiga.   People who use
their machines are more likely to purchase software and expand their
machines.  As long as Amigas are being used the Amiga will survive.

                         Getting Back To Our Roots
  Kermit Woodall                                    kermit@novadesign.com
===========================================================================

Consider this a call to arms or at least a call back to our roots.

When the Amiga first launched it was the user group and developer community
that got it really moving.  It's been the same ever since.  Marketing was
never Commodore's strength.  The Amiga, to so many of us, is a cause and
something worth being an evangelist about.  The Macintosh has its
evangelists, but that was part of a deliberate campaign by it's marketing
people.  Just read Guy Kawasaki's (the leader of Apples professional Mac
evangelists) marketing books to learn about this.  It's different with the
Amiga - it's simply so cool that many users can't help but become
evangelists for it.  We're not part of that 90% Wintel crowd.  It's hard
for them to ally under a name.  What can they say?  Whee!  We're
Windows95Users!?  We're Compac'ters!?  (there's a nasty visual image) We're
PC!?  (sounds like they won't let their kids play Mortal Kombat) We've got
the cool, friendly, name.  We're Amigans! 

I'm going to make some recommendations in this article.  I've been around,
played and worked with many operating systems, and seen how the other half
(or 90%) lives.  I've studied Guy's statements on getting people to become
evangelists, I've seen how Team OS/2 worked for acceptance of OS/2 over
Windows 95, and I've even seen a bit of how the Linux crowd works.  So I'm
going to steal all their ideas and throw in a few of my own and propose we
do something!


The Show's the Thing!

These first ideas can be snapped up by Team Amiga members and User Groups
everywhere. 

When I was part of and (for six years) ran a user group we had a couple of
goals.  Help our members.  Get more members.  One of our tactics for
getting more members was to take advantage of free/mostly free tables at
every single local (or near local) computer event and show.  Almost every
show was really focused more on PCs and other computers - but we'd show up
with our Amigas (generally at least four) and run music, graphics, and
demos all day long for as long as the show lasted.  Our focus was to show
stuff that looked better on the Amiga. 

This should be happening now.  Team OS/2 does this, at least around here,
all the time.  Combining what we used to do in our user group and what I
see Team OS/2 doing, I'll make the following recommendations for what you
can do.

Get a table for every upcoming show.  Get on the mailing lists so you know
about these shows in advance.

Publicize on the internet, local bbs systems and local computer papers that
the Amiga will be shown at these shows.

Organize who will staff your table(s) and who will bring equipment.  Having
a regular 'staff' within your group that handles these things helps make
this easier for all.  Try to bring the latest and greatest Amigas around. 
For historical purposes having an Amiga 1000 isn't a bad idea either.
(show 'em the inside cover!)

Collect the video demo tapes and run these on a large monitor.  My company,
Nova Design, Inc., has a demo tape (free to dealers and user groups!)
showing off our software.  Many other companies offer the same thing.  You
can even find various Amiga based animators have demo tapes as well! 

Keep a 'journal', or a looseleaf binder, with flyers and brochures from all
vendors currently supporting the Amiga.  Even companies that make things
like printers and scanners that work on the Amiga should be included so
people can see that connection to the Amiga.  Call or write every Amiga
supporting vendor regularly and get their latest literature.

If your club has demo copies of software, (and they should!) bring anything
that's currently available and show it.  Don't bring old copies of
GraphicCraft and the like.  People can't buy it, so if you're showing it,
it's going to reinforce the Amiga is Dead fallacy.  If you have old,
unavailable, software on your systems you're using at the show, put their
icons away during the show.

Feel free to show off Newicons, MUI, MagicWB and freeware/shareware things
of that nature.  Just be sure you point out that these packages are
available on the internet or from your clubs software library.

Bring stacks of your clubs newsletters.  Hey! You're promoting yourself too!

Be professional, be polite, let people visiting your table get some 'hands
on' experience.  You don't want to dress like IBM drones.  No suits and
ties here.  Just don't dress like other job that day is to wash your car or
dog! 

Do be prepared to tell people where they can buy the Amiga and its software
for it.  If you don't have a local dealer, give them a list of mail order
houses people in your club use and recommend.

Do this and you'll find yourself having fun and doing something effective
to promote the Amiga!


See What's Developing!

It's been sometime since CATS (the old Commodore sponsored developers
group) died.  Many people forget that the first Amiga developers group was
started by a grass roots effort by the developers directly!  If my,
occasionally faulty, memory has it right, Mike Halverson of Impulse, pushed
the formation of the first Amiga developers group.   We need someone in the
developer community to do this again. 

Why do we need a developers group?  Well, it's much better than having
Company X inventing a 'standard' and hoping everyone likes it - but Company
Y doesn't and goes their own way.  With a developer's group we could
coordinate things, propose and agree on things like extensions to the IFF
and ANIM standards (which need, respectively, 32-bit support and CMYK, new
compression methods, sound and video interleaving, high color ANIM support
and more).  A developers group could also function as a registry of active
developers and show programmers where to go (prehaps via a specific web
site and a mailing list) for publishing direction and advice.   There are
many other things the developer group could do, I can't guess at half of
them, so the quicker we can get this going again, the better!

If you're a developer and would like to jump in on this I've setup a
mailing list you can join to chat with other developers.  Email
newdev-request@lists.best.com and put the word SUBSINGLE in the body of the
message.  The subject, if you use one, will be ignored.  If you need to
unsubscribe later, email the same address with UNSUBSCRIBE in the body of
the message.

I'd recommend even trying to get this started formally at the Gateway
Amiga'97 show in St.  Louis.  Email me, kermit@novadesign.com, if you're
interested.  If I get enough responses, the nice folks with Amiga '97will
loan us some space and time.


Mongering Malfeasance Muted!

One goal we should all set for outselves is to reduce newsgroup
rumormongering and negative chatter about the Amiga.  Platform wars should
be, and are, embarassing for everyone.  If we can clean this sort of thing
up, it will go a long way towards settling things down so we can do some
serious business and have some fun too.

It's not hard to identify a potential rumor, flamewar and the like.  If
someones news isn't prefaced by 'This was in the latest Magazine X',
'Quikpak announced this on their web site', or a similar authoritative, and
verifiable source, then it's just a rumor.  Respond by politely asking the
poster to provide verification.  In other words, 'Put up or shut up
friend!'.  It'll be easy to do and prehaps we can finally ignore the 'Amiga
is dead' nonsense, ignore the attempts to invent news around who's buying
the Amiga today, and just get back to enjoying ourselves. 

Now, flamewars and platform wars are different beasts, but usually if
someone's posts use frequent casual profanity or freely refer to others as
'Stupid', 'Idiot' or other hot button words designed to touch off a fight,
then the best way to deal with them is to politely ignore them and/or
recommend ignoring them.  At most, reponse politely in a manner that
suggests the matter is closed and not worth continuing with.  Sadly, you'll
find that one of the worst sources for this is going to be former Amiga
owners.  They've sold their Amiga, and now they're using a soulless Wintel
box, so they're out to make you feel as bad as they do.  A classic sour
grapes scenario.

Who, What, Where, and When?

Don Hicks and Amazing put out a fantastic hardware and software guide for
the Amiga.  I’d like to propose that either one of the user groups, or
companies, with a large Amiga internet web presence put up a well indexed
web version that focuses on companies that are no longer focusing on their
Amiga product line, but still have a warehouse full of their old Amiga
products to sell.  It should have listings by category, title and company.
Include address, telephone, email, web addresses and product information
breakdowns.  A perfect example of this is The Toaster tally light from
Dynamic Realities (originally sold under a different company name).  They
still have 'em, but they don't advertise 'em.  Grab some old magazines,
track some companies down, and list them!  This be a guaranteed draw to the
web site that hosts it.


Other Neat Ideas

I will be writing again in the future about some other ideas, like how to
coordinate and create wild, cool, new enhancements to AmigaDOS by
approaching the task as a set of small, achievable, steps that can be done
by as many people that would like to be involved.  This project won't
require a lot of management overhead and complements other AmigaDOS efforts
nicely.  It will need it's own web and ftp site, some feedback from the
Amiga community, and any number of programmers interested in implementing
interesting new ideas in software for themselves and others.  The best
thing about it is that so many artists and programmers have already done
much of this - the real goal will be the establishment of the web and ftp
site to organize these efforts under one, dedicated, 'roof'.

One of my favorite new Amiga ideas is the Siamese system.  Check it out at;
http://www.hiq.co.uk


Ideas II - Who am I?

By way of closing let's play a game.  You might remember, or have heard, of
this old game referenced above.  Let's play it... 

I'm a small, stylish, 68000 based computer that comes with an advanced
multitasking operating system that uses a graphical user interface
environment that requires less than 128k RAM to run it and can still load
lots of applications.  With no aggressive company advertising I've still
managed to developed an evangelistic following that has left the Windows
based competition looking bloated and sluggish.  After release I've
gathered a strong presence on the internet as well.  What computer am I?

The Pilot.  A palm, ie: handheld, computer from US Robotics.  A company
mostly known for it's modems.  It weighs about 5.5oz, yes 5.5 ounces!, that
runs on a Motorola 'Dragonball' processor which is based on a 16mhz 68000
series processor.  The whole thing fits in your shirt pocket, has
'handwriting' recognition to let you enter information with its pen, comes
with software for itself and your PC or Mac computer that allows you to
maintain records on both systems that are sychronized at the touch of a
single button on the Pilots cradle.  Recently one of the Pilot faithful
created a Linux application to sync the Pilot under Linux.  Could an Amiga
port of this software be far behind? 

For more info on the Pilot start at; http://www.usr.com/palm or;
http://the-tech.mit.edu/Pilot/ or prehaps; http://pilot.org/ as well. 

(FYI: the 'Windows based competition' referenced above are the Windows CE
palmtops.  They feature a keyboard that's impossibly tiny (it's palm sized
with rubber buttons) and it uses a pen - but only as a mouse.  Their OS is
still bloated, slow, and IMHO it's unnecessary.)

@toc NEWS

CLOANTO'S PERSONAL PAINT 7 BREAKS AMIGA CHIP RAM BARRIER

With the release of the new CPU blitting module just made available on
Aminet (biz/cloan/PBlit_68K.lha), Personal Paint 7 becomes the first Amiga
program to actively exploit the full functionality of both the Graphics
library and the Amiga blitter applied to bitmaps stored in Fast RAM.

Normally, two crucial parts of the Amiga system require bitmap data to be
stored in Chip RAM: the original (Agnus) blitter chip, and the Graphics
library.  Personal Paint uses both, which until now meant that it had to
store in Chip RAM at least the bitmaps currently being manipulated.  Thanks
to its modular design, Personal Paint 7 already implemented a "virtual
blitter" which optionally used the CPU instead of the Agnus chip.  The
module just released extends this capability by implementing a faster
32-bit blitter (the Amiga blitter works in 16 bits).

The complete detachment from Chip RAM became possible when the developers
of the famous CyberGraphX system completed the replacement of 100% of the
original Amiga graphics.library with corresponding functions that can work
on Fast RAM.  This code is implemented in CyberGraphX version 40.100 and
higher, which has just been released.  After many sleepless nights of
Cloanto's programmers, in cooperation with the CyberGraphX team, Personal
Paint 7 becomes the first Amiga software to automatically detect and
exploit this condition.

We would like to take this opportunity to praise the developers of
CyberGraphX for achieving this difficult objective.  CyberGraphX "clones",
like earlier versions of the original CyberGraphX (and the original Amiga
libraries), still require bitmaps to be in Chip RAM in order to be
processed by certain functions of the Graphics library.  (Personal Paint 7
is not "confused" by CyberGraphX clones that do not provide equivalent
capabilities.)

The efforts of the CyberGraphX and Cloanto programmers have finally made a
dream come true for many Amiga users who had plenty of Fast RAM but never
enough Chip RAM.

DESCRIPTION

Wildfire is not only another brandnew image-processing-program - it's a
professional animation-processor with some really new concepts.

It allows you for example the creation and processing of animations in
several formats, the generation of time-dependant special-effects and the
design of large projects containing several animations and
frame-synchronized sound-effects.

Because the common animation-formats on the Amiga have too many lacks or
restrictions we have tried to create a better one: YAFA.  This
animation-format for example features many compression-methods and
realtime-zooming.

One of the outstanding features of Wildfire is the fact that it makes for
you no difference if you apply changes to a whole animation or if you
process only one image.  A single image is only a very special case of an
animation.

In contrary to common image-processors you can use envelopes instead of
plain numbers as effect-parameters.  This makes the easy creation of
time-dependant special-effects possible.  So you haven't to fight against
the "do"-loops in an ARexx-script to get an animation outside your
image-processor anymore.

All of the numerous effects can be arranged in any number and combination.
Because the output of any of these effects can be one of the 8
tempory-buffers Wildfire allows you to PROGRAM IMAGES in an comfortable
way!

Main Features:

  -fast and comfortable Converter:
    input:  YAFA, ANIM5/7/8, mpeg, image-sequences
    output: YAFA, ANIM5/7/8, image-sequences

  -Preview for almost any operation

  -Project-Editor which allows the creation of large and complicated
   projects easily using the mouse

  -Effect-Generator featuring time-dependant parameters via envelopes

  -a stunning library of effect-PlugIns

  -some really new effects, real 3D-effects

  -(un)loading of PlugIns at any time

  -Envelope-Editor

  -Timecodes-Editor

  -Transition-Maker for easy creation of transitions between two animations

  -easy-to-use Player-interface

  -Filmstrips to simplify the perfect timimg of huge projects

  -AnimInfo-function displaying size-profiles etc.

  -fontsensitive GUI without MUI

  -internal gadget-toolbox which handles mathematical expressions
   instead of only plain numbers

  -calculator which allows for example the export of user-defined symbols
   to the gadgets in the whole-program

  -Drag&Go (using drag.gadget 0.2 Copyright © 1996 Jörg Kollmann, see bonus
   drawer!)

  -ARexx-port with about 400 commands

  -macros, custom-windows, docks

  -import of images from other programs

  -Developer-Kit (with working example) which allows you to create your own
   effect-PlugIns

  -and many more

Requirements:

Hardware
-MC68020 or higher
-AGA chipset
-2 MB Fast
-recommended: FastRAM, HardDisk

Software
-AmigaOS V39 (3.0) or higher

@toc NEWS

Austex Software, the developers of Uropa² - "The Ulterior Colony", are
pleased to announce that the game will now be published commercial.

The game was originally released as a 'Shareware/Registration' onto Aminet
at the end of 1996 as we thought this was the cheapest way to offer the
game to Amiga game players and show our support of the Amiga community.

After recent discussions with Vulcan Software Limited we have realised that
having software commercially Published provides greater support to the
Amiga community in general.  In this manner we are providing support to
other commercial enterprises such as Amiga Magazines, Amiga retailers and
Amiga distributers.  This of course helps keep the Amiga market alive.

The game will be added to Vulcans MiniSeries range which delivers high
quality commercial software at a lower price to the purchaser.  Uropa² will
undergo some slight modifications and enhancements and soon be available in
Amiga retail stores around the world and via mail order from Vulcan
Software Limited. 

As Uropa² is no longer available as a shareware product we ask those that
have seen the game and intend to register to please now purchase the
commercial product through Vulcan Software Limited when it is released. 
You can keep up to date with it's progress from the Vulcan Software Web
page at http://www.vulcan.co.uk

Austex Software would like to thank those people who have supported us so
far by way of registrations and by the many email letters of compliments we
have received.

We remain committed to the Amiga computer while there are still people
using it and advocating for it.

Voyager-NG WWW browser prerelease
=================================

*** The next generation of Amiga Web browser has arrived ***

This is a preliminary release which brings this fantastic new Web browser
to the Amiga community and allows Voyager-NG to benefit from the largest
testing base possible.  With your help Voyager-NG can be rendered faultless
on the largest possible range of Amiga set-ups.

Due to the above, Voyager is currently updated frequently.

via EMail: mail to <fileserv@vapor.com>
           put "SEND VOYAGER" in the mail body

*** Please try this site, main Vapor site is under considerable load.

The full archive in LZX is 612 kbytes in size.

Updates will appear there regularly.  Updates are also announced on the
Voyager mailing list.  If you are not on it yet, you are encouraged to
subscribe.  Mail to <voyager-request@vapor.com> and put "ADD" in the body
of the mail.  Put "HELP" there to obtain a complete description on how to
use the mail server.  The mailing list is also a good place to discuss
enhancement suggestions.

Major changes to Voyager since Version 1.0:

Supports Frames as introduced by Netscape 2.x

 Uses internal image decoding routines. Visually incremental
  on-the-fly image decoding, leaving the program operational
  during decode. No more hassle with datatypes related bugs.
  Optimized memory usage. The routines are optimized for speed
  and are very fast. Full support of CyberGFX HiColor/TrueColor
  screens and compatibles.

 Supports HTML tables. Many more HTML commands 
  and Netscapism's are understood (including FONT SIZE and
  HR WIDTH). Improved general compatibility with broken
  and nonstandard HTML code.

 Supports versatile plugin interface for third-party
  extensions to the browser.

 Shipped with a handy split-screen web search engine plugin.

 Supports T/TCP "TCP for Transactions" requests,
  allowing for much faster establishment of HTTP links
  to servers. This is currently supported by
  Miami 1.9.x beta versions only. Specified
  in RFC 1644, as far as we know, Voyager is the
  first browser on any platform to support this!

 Totally reworked preference setting. The transfer anim is 
  now configurable, too.

 New so-called 'local' menus which pop up over links and
  images offering options such as opening in new window,
  copying URL to clipboard, downloading to disk or adding
  URL to bookmarks. Local menus also function for Frames by
  offering full window viewing, saving Frame and viewing
  Frame source.

 Supports Shift & Click downloading of files even from
  servers with broken configuration which state
  that binary data is of type "text/plain". This
  happens frequently with .lha and .lzx files,
  because these suffixes are missing in many
  http server example mime.types files.

 Added internal SMTP (E-mail) send capability. Now also
  supports mailto: links and mailto: Forms.

 Improved news handling.

 'LED' transfer status display additionally shows
  stalled transfers. (Well I thought it was neat)

 Many minor enhancements, and of course
  All The Popular Bugs were fixed, too.

TITLE

fMSX Amiga 1.2

AUTHOR

Hans Guijt <h.guijt@inter.nl.net>

DESCRIPTION

fMSX Amiga emulates an MSX computer on an Amiga. Features include:

- Full emulation of the MSX1 system.
- Partial emulation of the MSX2 system (to be expanded in the future).
- Support for reading/writing MSX disks and disk images.
- Support for the PSG and SCC sound chips.
- Support for MSX memory sizes of up to 4Mb.

'MSX' is an 8-bit computer system with surprisingly good graphics and
sound capabilities.

In fact, some MSX games are on par with Amiga games when it comes to
graphics and playability! Several MSX pictures have been uploaded to
Aminet (pix/illu/msx_pictures.lha).

Software is not included with the package, but many packages (mostly
games) can be found on FTP sites:

 ftp://ftp.saitama-u.ac.jp/pub/msx/
 ftp://altair.komkon.com/pub/MSX/
 ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/msx/
 ftp://riaph.irkutsk.su/pub/

Hundreds of games are available from these sites, and some form a
worthy addition to the Amiga software collection.

Of course fMSX Amiga is fully multitasking, runs in an intuition
screen, and has a font-sensitive user interface.

NEW FEATURES

In this version yet another screenmode is added to fMSX'es growing
arsenal: screen 8, the 256-color screen. It is emulated using EHB
on ECS machines.

Support was added for using diskimages without the help of an
external device such as fmsdisk.device. These diskimages can be
changed on the fly, allowing easy access to MSX disks stored
on the Amiga harddisk.

Finally, the MSX screen can be forced to remain at a specific
depth. This is achieved using `childscreens', an OS 3.0 feature.
This should alleviate the problem of the MSX screen popping to
the front whenever some screen attribute changes.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

Required are:

- AmigaOS 2.0
- 68020 processor
- 350 kilobytes chip ram
- 1000 kilobytes other ram

Recommended:

- AmigaOS 3.0
- 68030 processor, at least 25MHz
- Those 1000 kilobytes of 'other' ram had better be fast ram!

Note that fMSX Amiga does *not* require the AGA chipset. In fact
it runs on any chipset upto and including graphics cards!

AVAILABILITY

fMSX Amiga 1.2 is available from any Aminet site, such as:

ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/misc/emu/fmsx_1.2.lha

PRICE

It's free.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

fMSX Amiga 1.2 is publically supported freeware. If you are
interested in the source, and you're not afraid of function
pointers and huge amounts of assembly intermixed with C, you
can request it from me.

If someone wants to do a special version (and I can think of
several possibilities, such as a version that uses the MMU
for optimized Z80 emulation, or a version that has been optimized
for the CyberGfx system), contact me.

TITLE

  Frodo

VERSION

  4.0

AUTHOR

  Christian Bauer <cbauer@iphcip1.physik.uni-mainz.de>

DESCRIPTION

  Frodo V4.0 is a free, portable C64 emulator for BeOS, Unix, MacOS
  and AmigaOS systems.

  This emulator focuses on the exact reproduction of special graphical
  effects possible on the C64, and has therefore relatively high
  system requirements. It should only be run on systems with at least
  a PowerPC/Pentium/68060.

  Frodo is capable of running most games and demos correctly, even
  those with FLI, FLD, DYCP, open borders, multiplexed sprites, timing
  dependent decoders, fast loaders etc.

  Some small demo programs and the full source code in C++ are
  included in the archive.

  Some of the emulation's features:
   - 6510 emulation: All undocumented opcodes, 100% correct decimal
     mode, instruction/cycle exact emulation.
   - VIC emulation: Line-/cycle-based emulation, all display modes,
     sprites with collisions/priorities, DMA cycles, open borders, all
     $d011/$d016 effects.
   - SID emulation: Real-time digital emulation (16 bit, 44.1kHz),
     including filters (only under BeOS, Linux, HP-UX, MacOS and
     AmigaOS).
   - 1541 emulation: Drive simulation in directories, .d64/x64 or
     .t64/LYNX files, or processor-level 1541 emulation that works
     with about 95% of all fast loaders and even some copy protection
     schemes.
   - Other peripherals: Keyboard and joystick (real joysticks (only
     under BeOS, Linux and AmigaOS) or keyboard emulation).
   - Frodo is freeware. Why pay >$40 for a C64 emulator?

  The most important changes from V3.1:
   - C64 ROMs included (with extended Kernal ROM)
   - Frodo SC, the single-cycle emulation
   - Compatibility of processor-level 1541 emulation greatly improved
   - SID emulation can play sampled sounds
   - New keyboard shortcuts for toggling the speed limiter and the
     full 1541 emulation
   - Full-screen mode (BeOS)
   - Autoconf script (Unix)
   - Ported to MacOS and AmigaOS

HARDWARE SUPPORTED

  - BeBox or PowerMac with BeOS DR8
  - Unix systems with X11R6 or Linux/SVGAlib (Tcl/Tk 4.1 recommended)
  - 68k or PPC Macintosh with System 7.5
  - Amiga/DraCo with 68040/68060, AmigaOS 3.0 and a graphics card

Worms Director's Cut News from Andy Davidson

WormsDC missed xmas because of a few things - problems with the game on
2meg 1200s being one of them, the game was just too tight on memory for
some set-ups.  It should now be out at the beginning of March.  The
finished demo will be on T17/Aminet soon as well =)

There are no coloured names in WormsDC because I didn't want to limit the
palette for the foreground, and the sprites are being used for other
things.  But there is now an option in the game to add the Team number or
initial to the front of the worm names to help with identifying them -
thanks to JamesBart on #amiga for that idea, simple but works =)

And as for the bloody zoom!!  ;) Because Amiga Worms uses hardware
scrolling and copper tricks all over the place, it would be a lot of hassle
to implemement a zoom, and it just isn't worth it.  Anyway, you've now got
an extra layer of mountains, quarter-pixel scrolling (even in the
parallax), 325 colours on screen and old women that explode!!  ...  what
more could you want!!  :D

amiCrawler Announces Amiga Search Engine

February 10, 1997 - amicrawler.com announced today new features in its full
text, multilingual search engine.  amiSpider allows Amiga users to search
every word on over 3,000 Amiga web pages.

According to David Tiberio, amiCrawler's programmer and webmaster, the main
features of amiSpider are the ease of submitting a site, and its numerous
multilingual capabilities, besides being able to index and find words on
any page submitted.  Using an advanced scoring system, amiSpider displays
results based upon relevency.

Here are many of the new features added to amiSpider this February, as well
as its previous features:

- Multilingual interface, choosing the default language for the 
  user by detecting which country he is in. For example, a visitor
  from Sweden will see an interface in Swedish, including graphics
  tailored for Swedish visitors. Web sites from Sweden will have
  higher relevency, so searching for "user group" will show Swedish
  user groups before groups in other countries.

- Search for more than 3,000 Amiga web sites. With amiSpider
  you will be searching every word on every Amiga page in
  the database.

- Intelligent queries allow more than simplistic "and/or" searches.
  amiSpider permits queries such as "format my hard drive", 
  "lemmings cheats", and "browser plugins". Searching for "newtek"
  will bring up newtek.com first, and searching for "scala" will
  bring up "scala.com" first.

- Results are displayed in a logical, easy to use page, with a maximum 
  of 10 matches per page, including descriptions. Support is available
  for <META> tag descriptions.

- View the most popularly searched sites from our Top 20 list, and 
  view the sites which have breaking news. We search the web every
  day using our spiders, and display which news sites have updated
  information, so that you can find them all in one convenient place.

- Easy site submission; just provide us with your url and your page 
  will be indexed immediately. You can view how your page will appear
  and even check its progress in the queue. Also, we have very liberal
  submission policies. Any page that has Amiga specific information is 
  accepted, including personal home pages of Amiga users. Pages are
  queued and can be viewed by visitors instantly.

- Free banner advertising for any Amiga web site, simply by joining
  the Amiga Web Network, our cooperative advertising network. You can
  have your banner appear on sites such as omnipresence.com and
  amicrawler.com!

- Targetted banner advertising, based on user's browser type, 
  operating system type, and geographic location, allowing advertisers
  to make sure that the people who want to see the ads are seeing 
  them. There is no reason for a small dealer to advertise to another
  continent when he could be reaching people within his own country,
  or to display banner ads to people who can't read them.

- Free reciprical link exchange program, by joining our
  new amiCrawler Partners Program. We are now
  compensating Amiga webmasters for promoting our site by providing 
  reciprical links on our "COOL SITES" page. This allows you to 
  receive free promotion for your site simply by linking to the 
  Partners Program page.

Fairy Point/M 2.0-#103

AUTHOR

Stefan Eggers
Max-Slevogt-Str. 1
51109 Koeln
Federal Republic of Germany

seggers@semyam.dinoco.de

DESCRIPTION

(A point program handles the transfer, reading and writing of email and
news.  Janus is one way to transfer email and news and is very popular in
Germany.)

Another Janus point program for the Amiga.  It was designed to be easy to
use by not overloading it with thousands of features that hardly anybody
uses.

The concept is a bit different from that found in other Janus point
programs as it shows the newsgroups list, the contents of the current
newsgroup and the text of the current message at once (each of them in a
separate window) and not one after the other.

At present the program is only available in a German version!

Please keep in mind that this is one of the first Janus versions of this
program.  ARexx integration into the GUI and a killfile were omitted for
now in favor of more debugging and a better GUI.  They will be available
later.

If you have more questions send them to:  fp-info@semyam.dinoco.de

NEW FEATURES

Since 2.0-#100:

- ARexx command set.
- Command line parameters PUBSCREEN and STARTUP.
- Important bug fixes.
- Improved implementation of ANTWORT-AN and DISKUSSION-IN.

From older versions to 2.0-#100:

- Significant changes to the GUI.
- Tree display for the messages.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

- a Harddisk is highly recommended
- a Modem with AT command set
- about 1.5 MByte of free RAM
- AmigaOS 2.04 or newer
- AmigaGuide is highly recommended for reading the documentation
- xprzmodem.libary 2.10 or newer

AVAILABILITY

Available on Aminet servers; for example:

    ftp://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/pub/aminet/comm/misc/FPointM.lha (173613)

TITLE

AmiWeb2c 2.0

AUTHOR

AmiWeb2c 2.0 was created by Andreas Scherer on the basis of
Karl Berry's Web2c 7.0 who collected stuff from Donald E. Knuth,
Oren Patashnik, Tomas G. Rokicki, John D. Hobby, and others.

Please report bugs to the maintainer of AmiWeb2c and not to
these other people, who can't be of any help with the Amiga
(well, except for Tomas Rokicki of course, who started the
whole thing in the first place :-)

Andreas Scherer
Rochusstra=DFe 22-24
52062 Aachen, Germany
<scherer@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

DESCRIPTION

AmiWeb2c 2.0 is the native Amiga port of the complete Web2c 7.0
system of UNIX-TeX (except for the xdvi previewer).  Detailed
information is provided in the archive and from common TeX
resources like the CTAN (see below).  As a starter you may
want to check out http://www.tug.org.

NEW FEATURES

AmiWeb2c 2.0 is the successor of my AmiWeb2C (note the capital C)
released in May 1995.  Virtually everything is new and reworked.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

I made no attempt in changing the internal settings of any
programs of Web2c 7.0, so you'll need quite a lot of system
resources to run AmiWeb2c 2.0.  Although the binaries can be
run on any processor starting with the 68000, use of an
accelerator board is highly recommended.  At least 4 MB of RAM
are required for the large programs to run.  I never tried any
part of AmiWeb2c 2.0 on version 1.3 of the operating system.

AVAILABILITY

The major resource for TeXnical material is the so-called CTAN.
For me this is ftp://ftp.dante.de (Germany).  More information
about this service is available there.

AmiWeb2c 2.0 will be located in the directory

   ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/systems/amiga/amiweb2c

The same distribution is available on the Aminet in the
text/tex/ directory.

PRICE

It's free of charge.  In fact, the Web2c 7.0 system is provided
under the GNU General Public License and this should be assumed
for AmiWeb2c 2.0 as well.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

There are no restrictions for distributing AmiWeb2c 2.0 in whole
or in parts.  In fact, work is under way to include this Amiga
TeX system on the "TeX Live CD" provided by the "TeX Users
Group" (see http://www.tug.org/texlive.html).  Of course, the
Aminet CD will contain this package as well.

TITLE

NetHack 3.2.1, second Official Amiga Binary Release

ABOUT THIS RELEASE

This release replaces NH32P1.lha, which will crash if the O command is used
in 32-color mode.  No other changes have been made.

CONTACT

nethack-bugs@linc.cis.upenn.edu
Please state that you are using the second official Amiga binary release.

DESCRIPTION

NetHack is a single player dungeon exploration game in the tradition of
Rogue.

REQUIREMENTS

AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04(or better), 3.1
2M RAM (more is better)
5M Hard disk space (yes, it still can be played on one floppy
 but this is highly discouraged!)

AVAILABILITY

Main repository:

 ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/games/nethack/binaries/amiga/NH32P1v2.lha

Source is available from the same site.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

NetHack is copyrighted and freely redistributable - please see
the license for details.

MORE INFORMATION FROM THE MAIN RELEASE

We have now put the official 3.2.1 version up on our primary ftp site,
ftp.uu.net:/pub/games/nethack.  I expect that our mirrors will catch up
shortly.  Below, please find a summary of the updates made to the game:

Weapons skills processing is made smarter and centralized in #enhance (and
documented, now that we're mildly happy with it).  Setting options from
within the game has changed drastically, precipitated by a patch from Per
Liboriussen.  Default object class characters can be used as menu
shortcuts.  Menu commands can be mapped on some window-ports.  See the
guidebooks for full details.

Core bugs fixed include crashes due to Medusa's moving after being killed,
weird messages for applying bullwhips after leaving traps, missiles and
tridents not being properly accounted for in weapon skills, and a DLB bug
that caused very slow file access from DJGPP-compiled binaries, along with
many more minor things.

Linux text colors, X11 help files, Amiga tiles outside the main dungeon,
MS-DOS game re-entry after shelling and changing directories, and endgame
entry with MFLOPPY enabled all now work.  We have a suggested workaround
for the HPUX/DGUX + gcc situation that caused the game to hang trying to
create nearly infinite monsters.

68K Macs may now have a chance, now that we've found that the previous
compiler options produced buggy structure copies for that platform. 
Dragging the scrollbar on Macs should work now, but the other window
flakiness inherited from 3.1.3 is still there and probably will continue to
be unless someone who both understands Mac windowing and has time appears
out of the woodwork.

Earlier save and bones files are not compatible with 3.2.1, although the
code should now reject them instead of crashing.

Happy Hacking!

@node NEWS24 "Virus Checker"
@toc NEWS

From: Dave Dustin <dave@manawatu.gen.nz>
Virus Checker Up For Grabs Again

First off, I would like to apologise to all those who have been waiting for
information about the continuation of the VirusChecker project, especially
those registered users who contacted me over the past 8 months.

The development of VirusChecker by myself has been basically been stopped.

When I first decided to purchase VirusChecker off John Veldthuis, I had
every intention of continuing with the work he had started.  I jumped in,
redesigned the interface; rewrote the file checker in C so that it might be
used by Aminet; I asked the users what they wanted in a new version,
implementing many of their suggestions; while also beginning work in lots
of other areas of the program.

Since then, many things have happened in my life, which has basically left
me not using my computers as much as I used to.  In fact, I spend at most
15 minutes every couple of days checking EMail and news.  My PC sits idle
unless my brother is playing games on it.

The main reason for dropping all my computer work is due to the fact that
my girlfriend and I wanted to spend more time together.  Although we both
like and use computers, it's not really a big part of our lives anymore.

I would like to hear from those parties that might be interested in picking
up the development.  I am looking for one person or group that could
continue with the program.

I am not seeking any payment for the source due to the fact that I never

TITLE

Gui4Cli

VERSION

2.0

AUTHOR

Dimitris C. Keletsekis     Email: dck@hol.gr

DESCRIPTION

Gui4Cli is a program with which *anyone* can very easily create GUIs.  No
deep programming knowledge, compilers, libraries etc are needed.

With it, you can make GUIs for :
- Customizing your Workbench, launching programs etc.
- Giving a GUI to CLI based programs
- Making GUIs for programs with an AREXX port.

It is a simple interpreted script language (about as simple as AmigaDOS)
which enables you to construct GUIs and with them form command lines which
you can send to AmigaDOS or to AREXX ports of other programs, for
execution.  You can think of it as "Visual-DOS".

It features :
- Multiple, resizable, font-sensitive windows
- GadTools Gadgets and Menus
- The ability to dynamically change the GUIs
- Icons that can be used as buttons, or in menus
- Keyboard shortcuts for gadgets & menus
- Graphics and font commands
- Common window shortcuts
- Colored window backgrounds (pattern or icons)
- Create & use other screens
and much more...

Gui4Cli will stay in memory and load, interpret and run the GUIs you make.
You can run as many GUIs as your memory allows, all from the same instance
of the program.

The program is not disabled in any way and there are full manuals included.

The demos provided (to give you an idea of what you can do), include :

- A caclulator (with memories etc) based on the c:eval
  command
- A "MultiMedia" GUI, which combines GUIs for the
  "ppshow", "sfx" and "proplay" programs into a common
  GUI allowing you play sounds & graphics together.
- A "display" script which will show you files according
  to their type.
- A replacement for the WB "Execute Command" GUI, which
  also allows you to send AREXX commands and change
  directory.
- A ToolBar (made with icons) providing common shortcuts
  (cut/paste etc) for the "CygnusEd" editor.

AVAILABILITY

At any Aminet site, e.g.:

ftp://ftp.netnet.net/pub/aminet/dev/gui/Gui4Cli.lha (125k)


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

OS 2.04+

DISTRIBUTION

Freely distributable via CD, Disk, FTP etc.

TITLE

Config

VERSION

Version 1.01 (Released 28th June, 96)

AUTHOR

Adam Dawes

E-Mail: Adam@beachyhd.demon.co.uk
        ad32@brighton.ac.uk
Fidonet: 2:441/93.5

DESCRIPTION

Config is a piece of C sourcecode designed to make access to configuration
files as easy as possible.

All the hard work is taken away, and replaced with just 4 functions:

    WriteConfig()
    WriteConfigNumber()
    ReadConfig()
    ReadConfigNumber()

The config files are in a standard format: they are divided into "sections"
(each of which has a unique name).  In each section is any number of
keywords, each of which has an associated data item.

To write data to a config file, a single call to WriteConfig() is required,
telling it the name of the config file, the section and keyword the data is
to be added with, and the data itself.  Config will then create the config
file (if necessary), create the section (if necessary) and add or modify
(as appropriate) the entry in the config file.

Reading from the config file is just as easy.  You specify the filename,
section and keyword and Config returns you the data.  However, when calling
the ReadConfig() function, you also supply a default value.  If the data
cannot be returned for any reason (config file doesn't exist, section or
keyword doesn't exist), you will be returned your default value.  This
means that absolutely no extra handling is necessary for new config files,
etc.

WriteConfigNumber() and ReadConfigNumber() work in exactly the same way,
but with numbers instead of strings.

Full documentation and examples are included within the archive.

NEW FEATURES

Fixed a nasty memory allocation bug.  Any programs compiled with Config
v1.0 should be recompiled with v1.01 (which *is* stable).

TO DO

I would ideally like to make Config in to a shared library.  This would
mean it could be accessed from any language, not just C.  I currently have
no idea how to do this, though, so that may not happen just yet.

I also have plans to add full caching to Config to speed things up a
little, aswell as adding a few more functions.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

Any Amiga running a C compiler (tested with DICE and SAS/C).  Whilst the
code is potentially ANSI-compliant, it currently uses several functions
from exec.library for linked-list manipulation.  I will consider making the
code fully ANSI compatible if there is any demand for it.

AVAILABILITY

From Aminet, for example:

  ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/c/Config101.lha (9k)

PRICE

Free.

DISTRIBUTION

Config is freely distributable as long as it is not modified in any way.
You are perfectly welcome to use it in your own programs (that's why I've
written it, after all) without any permission; I won't complain if you feel
like giving me a mention in the documentation, but that's by no means
compulsory.

TITLE

Conk - A game construction set.

VERSION

0.90 (Beta test version)

AUTHOR

42 South (Ben Campbell, Grant Young, Paul Atkin)

EMail: ben@ns.planet.gen.nz

DESCRIPTION

Conk is a standalone game creation package.  It is very versatile and can
be used to make up 2D games in many styles - Horizontal scrolly shootemups,
maze games, Defender-style blasters, Asteroids-style games, Robotron-style
games, Platform games and many others.

- Paint program and background map editor included
- Editor programs are very system-friendly
- Games take over the display hardware, but otherwise leave the
  operating system intact (ie multitasking still goes)
- Fully hard drive installable
- Multiplayer game support
- Game files are cached - no unnecessary reloading of levels
- Play between-level IFF Anims
- Tracker music modules supported
- Support for IFF 8SVX and raw sound data
- Games can have virtually unlimited horizontal scrolling,
  limited vertical scrolling or may get rid of scrolling
  altogether and use an IFF picture (ILBM) as a backdrop.
- Any Amiga system can be targeted (Kickstart 2.0+ is required
  in this beta release, later versions will run on 1.3). You
  can make up games for standard 68000 machines, or go for a
  _serious_ game needing lots of memory, disk space and
  processor grunt. You are not limited by artificial
  constraints.
- Produced games are stand-alone, and no restrictions are placed
  upon their distribution.
- AGA supported (but not required)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

Amiga OS 2.0 (or higher) required.
"asl.library" from Amiga OS 2.1 (or higher) required.  This will not be
needed in the next release.

For making up games, the preferred system would have a hard drive, at least
two megs of memory and a faster processor.  A standard Amiga 1200 or
accelerated 500 is nice.

AVAILABILITY

Conk is available either by FTP:

ftp://ftp.acid.nz.com/Acid/Conk/ConkA.lha

Oberon System V4 for Amiga

VERSION

        CH-8092 Zuerich

DESCRIPTION

Oberon System V4 for Amiga (O4A) is a full implementation of ETH Zurich's
Oberon System V4.

Oberon is both a programming language and an operating system developed by
Prof.  N.  Wirth and Prof.  J.  Gutknecht.

The Oberon System in key words:
 - Single-process multitasking
 - Garbage collector - memory will be released automatically if
   not needed anymore
 - Commandos: procedures that can be called like programs
 - Dynamic loading: modules are loaded and linked to the system
   during run-time (if necessary)
 - Text as a built-in abstract data type (for example a
   Minesweeper game as a letter (like OLE and OpenDOC))
 - Graphical user interface

A special advantage is the very high compatibility of the systems between
implementations on different computers.  System V4 implementations exist
for Amiga, Mac, Power Mac, Windows (NT), Linux, IBM-RS6000, Sun-Sparc,
HP-Workstations, NeXt, ...  You can use a program written on one
implementation on any other without change.

O4A is a full implementation of the Oberon System V4 with all usual
programs.  The system runs in its own task and therefore you can use O4A
and the Amiga OS at the same time.  Specific features of the Amiga
implementation are its incremental heap allocation, support of the Amiga
clipboard and the capability of accessing IFF files.

The O4A package contains:
 - A full Oberon-2 compiler
 - Development tools (Browser, Analyzer, Disassembler, ...)
 - XE, a comfortable 'editor' with layout functions
 - Kepler, an object-oriented 2D vector drawing program
 - Paint, a simple pixel-oriented paint program
 - A lot of additional tools (Draw, RX, AsciiCoder, ...)
 - Various text elements
 - VT100 terminal emulation
 - Games: Tetris and Minesweeper (with source)
 - Example sources and online documentation

To get more information about the programming language and operating system
Oberon have a look at the "Oberon and Amiga" WWW page:
http://sun1.rrzn.uni-hannover.de/~nhbidegn/oa-e.html There you will find
links to other Oberon information resources.
 
NEW FEATURES

- All interface modules rewritten
- Amiga font support
- Many small bugs fixed

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

- Amiga with OS2.0 or higher
- at least an MC68020
- a minimum of 1.5 MB free memory (2.5 MB recommended)

RealAudio: Try And Convince Them

Hello,

During a discussion on the IBrowse mailinglist, the topic of RealAudio
came up, as you probably know this is not available for the Amiga.
I mentioned that RealAudio has a 'bulletinboard' where web surfers can
write comments and I suggested that perhaps we should write a note there.
This has already started, several amigans have written mails, explaining
a bit about who they are and why they would like to *buy* a version for
the Amiga. It may be a waste of time, on the other hand who knows :)

@toc NEWS

Hi there! 
 
I am now happy to inform you that the form based survey part of IARS is
running.  Is it ready?  Well, it will surely be updated as time goes, with
more descriptive links etc., but the survey itself has at last found its
shape. 
 
Please visit and submit your views at: 
 
http://www.skip.adb.gu.se/~gunnar/iars/ 
 
You may be glad to know that Phase5 Digital Products have given IARS an
official recognition, and they really wan't everyone to visit it, since
they believe the results may be very interesting and useful for them.  I
also got a mail from Carl Sassenrath saying that he was really interested
in the results of the survey.  It seems that at last there's someone who'll
listen to the Amiga Community.  Visit the survey! 
 
Sincerely

Awesome new ZX emulator: SPECULATOR 97

There are lots of Amiga Spectrum emulators, but this is a really good one
especially if you're a former Spectrum user or programmer.  Apologies to
some US readers who may not know what a Spectrum is.  I guess it's a
European thing (mainly).  Actually it's a few million Euro things, and a
few hundred thousand Timex variants sold in the States, back in the 1980s.
There are still about twenty Spectrum publishers in the UK, and many more
across Europe.  But what of this emulator?

William James's Speculator 97 is on the Aminet now, in the misc/emu
directory.  Earlier versions appeared on several UK magazine cover disks
last year, but this (1.04) is the first release to Aminet, and considerably
tidier and more complete than the earlier ones.

The following details are taken from the Aminet readme file.  The full
archive is a 378K packed LHA which expands to about 860K.

SPECULATOR 97 FEATURES

Speculator 97 is the 1997 version of a fast Spectrum emulator written in
the UK, updating the version originally released on Amiga Format and Amiga
User International cover-disks late last year.  It has many advantages over
earlier Amiga Spectrum emulators.  It is shareware but has no operational
restrictions.

o  Speculator is Amiga O/S friendly and runs on all versions of the 680X0.
o  Over 100K documentation in AmigaGuide format, plus extra
   pictures/documents.
o  The Workbench 2.0/3.0 environment and AGA mode promotion is well
   supported.
o  Snapshot files in six different formats are supported transparently.
o  Support for ALL the standard Amiga keys as well as the main 40 Spectrum
   ones.
o  Spectrum ROM routines rewritten in 68K code for increased system speed.
o  ROM extensions - CAT command and full BASIC file handling implemented.
o  High Resolution display of menus and requesters, with mode promotion.
o  Integrated utilities such as labelling Z80 Disassembler and screen to IFF
   saver.
o  High speed, efficient Z80 emulation engine and optimised screen handling.
o  ZA80 cross-assembler included for developing Z80 assembler programs.
o  Speculator can be used transparently through project icons for snapshot
   programs.
o  LPRINT, LLIST and output to stream #3 is re-directed to any Amiga device
   or file.
o  Spectrum disk handler supplied for using MGT disks just like real Amiga
   disks.
o  Optional built in 'Easy Keys' feature to overcome keyword entry problems.
o  Lots of *legal* example programs including BetaBASIC3, AstroBall and
   Smashout.
o  Cassette loading supported with a very simple cable for all Amigas.
o  Supports serial transfers to and from real Spectrums.
o  Automated Hard disk installation for both emulator and ZX disk handler.
o  Startup icon allows easy use direct from a CD or any sub-directory.
o  Supplied with an Amiga-compatible Spectrum-style ZX8 font.
o  Compatible with ZX_Datatype 39.1 by Edward Vermuelen.

@node FEATURE1 "CDTV Retrospective II"
@toc FEATURE

===========================================================================
                The Definitive CDTV Retrospective: Part II
  Peter Olafson                                           peteroo@aol.com
===========================================================================

Many of the unreleased CDTV games in the full list didn't get beyond the
twinkle-in-the-eye stage.  But a handful did make it well down the road
toward publication.  Here's a rough accounting of the fate of some of the
canceled games on which work is known to have been done.

CDTV Sports Football (CDTV Publishing): Long delayed, this offshoot of
Cinemaware's unreleased TV Sports: Football 2 finally surfaced in early
1994 as Amiga CD32 Sports: Football.  (No, it's not backward compatible
with CDTV.) Impressive for its graphic beauty and wide range of plays,
obnoxious in its use of CDXL, it had pitifully little AI and omitted
certain key TV Sports functions.  You'd think something in the cooker so
long would be *done*, y'know?

Dungeon Master (FTL): FTL president Wayne Holder reports the developer
largely completed the CDTV conversion of this seminal dungeon crawl, only
to be stymied by the inability to obtain reliable info from CBM on saving
games to memory cards. 

This was to be a moderately enhanced version with improved music and
animation and a special animation player.  It was never formally canceled;
it just never surfaced.  Some of the technology has surfaced in subsequent
Amiga products (like Chaos Strikes Back), and for some time afterward, FTL
continued to hold out hope it could complete the port.

"But things never came together at Commodore," Holder indicated.  "So, I
suppose, it ended with a whimper rather than a bang."

Herewith the Clues (Domark): Domark twice went back and forth on an Amiga
CD version of this 1930s murder mystery, first on a CDTV version and more
recently on one for CD32.  Neither would surface.

Happily, Herewith the Clues was released on disk by On-Line a few years
back, so we can get a sense of what we missed. 

Er ...  make that unhappily.  In format, it's much like The Hound of the
Baskervilles in that you're presented with a range of evidence, photos, and
exhibits, and expected to digest these clues and come back with a solution.
There's a lot of info to take in without too much in the way of niceties,
and it's fair to expect that the CD version would have been cleaned up and
the hard info abetted with voices.

The Lawnmower Man (The Sales Curve): Wound up as an IBM game, but started
out as a CDTV project.  It's a series of linked arcade, flying and puzzle
games based around the rather silly movie.  The game was well along (I saw
a muddy 16-color demo of the CDTV version at the European Computer Trade
Show in 1993), but SCI dropped the project in favor of the 3-CD Cyberwar, a
game similar in structure, improved only cosmetically.  (No where-is-it
letters, please; it was completed, but has long since been killed.)

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Loom, and Secret of Monkey Island (CDTV
Publishing): LucasArts did the CDTV conversions of these delightful
animated adventures, which were projected for release by CBM in 1991 and
1992. 

Their fate is something of a mystery.  A LucasArts spokeswoman reported
that all three cleared in-house testing, were approved, and then were
turned over to CBM for release.

However, a former CBM employee who worked on the CDTV project through 1992
indicates that nothing from LucasArts crossed his desk.

At any rate, the games never did surface.  Conventional wisdom suggests
that Indy and SOMI were straight ports of the disk-based games.  Loom may
or may not have been a "talkie." (The PC CD-ROM version that preceded it
did have voices.)

Lunar Rescue: The Colossus Incident (Odyssey): Odyssey was one of a handful
of U.S.-based labels to take a real interest in CDTV.  Lunar Rescue, slated
to appear on CDTV in the fall of 1992, would have been Odyssey's third and
most original and substantial undertaking - about 50 megabytes of
game-cum-space database built around the rescue of a crashed Apollo
spacecraft.  Unfortunately, CDTV crashed first. 

For a time, Odyssey pursued Lunar Rescue as a PC CD-ROM project, but that
appears to have fallen by the wayside as well.  (I was unable to reach the
publisher for an update.)

Microcosm (Psygnosis): "It will redefine computer entertainment," read the
blurb.  Yes, Psygnosis' graphically dazzling, gameplay-poor 3D arcader for
the CD32 was initially a CDTV project.  In fact, a short, non- interactive
demo of this early version - along with a longer version of the Planetside
demo - can be found on the Psygnosis demo CD -- intercut with intros from
many of Psygnosis' other Amiga games.  (And yes, the disc works on CD32.)

The CDTV version appears to have been much like the CD32 release in
concept.  The main differences are that the graphics are largely in shades
of gray and that you're in the *President's* bloodstream, rather than that
of some off-world corporate suit. 

Wounded by the platform's famous non-performance, the final nail in
Microcosm CDTV's coffin must have been the arrival of the CD32.

Mind Run II (Crealude): Mind Run author Pierre Berloquin reports that he
completed a Mind Run II.  This one focused on machines, logic, space and
numbers, and was designed along much the same lines as the original.   CBM
wasn't interested, however, and the project died.

Planetside (Psygnosis): Ah, yes.  Planetside.  If CDTV's salvation could
have been linked to any particular product, this might have been it.  This
is the game that should have sold the machine that came from the house that
Jack built.

Planetside has its roots back in the days when Psygnosis was one of "The
Great Amiga Publishers." Demoed on the Lemmings CDTV disk, this shoot-em-up
had you racing over a fractal landscape in pursuit of a raging missile.

The killer: The demo was said to be drawn, not from the introduction, but
from the game proper.  It was to take up about 400 megabytes and was
originally set to appear in early 1992.

But it was delayed until summer, then until fall, then until spring 1993. 
And as it turned out, Planetside had been cannibalized for parts.   The
technology has since surfaced in Microcosm and NovaStorm (which was started
for CD32, but left incomplete). 

Psycho Killer II (On-Line): In which you, as a psychic investigator, track
down the nut who got away in the original.  This followup, projected for
spring 1992, was extensively filmed (but not coded) and was canceled when
it became apparent CBM was no longer supporting CDTV.   On-Line's Michael
Hodges reports that it would have involved a lot more artwork and would
have been significantly more interactive.  (It was also going to include
nudity and some rough language.)

Sensible Soccer (Renegade): *The* Amiga soccer game was slated for a CDTV
version in 1992.  That straight port of the disk version was largely done,
but Renegade wound up turning it into a CD32 version instead.

Treasure Quest (Almathera): Almathera canned this half-complete project -
an animated board game built around a random monster maze - when it became
clear CBM wasn't going to support the CDTV. 

                    --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Evidently, there was no worse fate that could befall a CDTV game than being
heralded by Commodore as "coming soon." Of 38 games so hyped in the two
CDTV catalogues, exactly two surfaced.

Did they or didn't they?  Only Commodore knows for sure on these three
games. 

All were slated for CDTV release, but lack of hard info in one case and
inability to find the publisher in the others conspire to leave these games
in no-man's land.

Cubulus/Magic Serpent (Software 2000): Like Shiftrix/Lettrix (see below),
this duo was slated for release only in Germany. 

Hard words for the Amiga game archivist: Germany's a whole separate world
where the Amiga is concerned, and the language barrier sometimes prevents
games from escaping the continent.

However, since they did surface on disk, we have an inkling of what they
must be like on CD.  Both appear to be commercial products, but, as with
Lettrix, that distinction seems to have blurred, and they've found their
way into various PD libraries.  Cubulus (which actually appeared as a cover
disk on a European Amiga mag) is the work of Tobias Richter, celebrated for
his Star Trek animations and game.  It's a colorful turn on Rubik's Cube
games.  Magic Serpent's a bright, colorful snake game with a twist: You
don't have full control over the snake...  and it's very fast.

Future Wars: Adventures in Time (Interplay): I never could nail down to my
satisfaction whether or not this first Cinemathique adventure surfaced on
CDTV.  Interplay does indeed list the game -- equally enjoyed and
howled-over in the disk-based version for its dust-speck sized objects --
as one of its two CDTV releases.  CBM did include it in the company's two
CDTV catalogs.  And CDTV retailers in the UK suggest it may have surfaced
in Germany.

But I've never seen it, and, as in so many cases with CDTV, seeing is
believing.  If it did come out, Future Wars CDTV was to have had a full
musical soundtrack (an element notably missing from the disk game).

Shiftrix/Lettrix (Software 2000): Like Cubulus/Magic Serpent (see above),
this two-pack of Tetris variants was planned as a Germany-only release.
And, again, I can't absolutely vouch for its existence.

I can't even describe Shiftrix.  However, Lettrix turned up under the
PD/shareware banner in Europe in 1990 - with one of those "released by"
intro text scrollers which suggests it was a pirated commercial property
instead.  It's not Tetris with letters; it's much closer in concept to
games like Shapes.  (You plug Tetris-like pieces into letter-shaped
frameworks.)

@node FEATURE3 "IPISA 96 -- Sixth Edition"
@toc FEATURE

===========================================================================
                         IPISA 96 -- Sixth Edition
  Vincenzo Gervasi                                    gervasi@di.unipi.it
===========================================================================

Yes, in Italy it has become a kind of Christmas tradition: turkey, gifts
and IPISA.  This year, the biggest Amiga developer-oriented conference in
Italy was held on November, 30 in the familiar ISU Auditorium that, despite
all the doom and gloom that can be found in the c.s.a.* newsgroups, was
filled with over 430 developers, dealers, journalists and power-users.
This means that attendance has grown steadily for the fifth consecutive
edition!


The Proceedings and some gifts

All participants received a 60-pages booklet with the conference
proceedings (entirely produced with LaTeX on the Amiga) and *three*
CD-ROMs.  The first of them, produced by the IPISA committee, contained
stuff related to the presentations made at the conference in the current
and previous editions, several recent large distributions (Fred Fish's ADE,
Linux and NetBSD for the Amiga) and many other files, documents, and
archives useful to developers (mainly definitions of standards, FAQs etc.).
The other two CDs were generously donated by Cloanto Italia of Personal
Paint fame: no less than the complete Personal Suite 6.4 CD and the famous
Kara Font Collection!  Also, participants received Sun Microsystem's "Java"
white papers (100 pages of interesting half-marketing/half-development
ramblings), free copies of the leading Amiga magazines in Italy, special
offers and discounts from several dealers and so on.


Starting Talks

After long pilgrimages to the conference's bar (due to the abundant
snowfall of the morning), the crowded hall could assist to the first
presentations.  After a brief introduction by Sergio Ruocco, chairman of
the organizing committee, Vittorio Calzolari delighted the attendance
reporting his experiences with the "Plug'n'pray" feature of a well known
operating system.  Given the nature of the subject, Vittorio had no problem
at reinforcing the idea of everyone in the hall that other computing
environment aren't as shiny as the marketing folks would like us to
believe.


Games, CD-ROMs and the Amiga Software Industry

Immediately after Vittorio, Francesco Leonardi and Giuliano Pochini
presented VoXel, a new graphic rendering engine tailored to draw fast 3D
landscapes.  The voxel technique, albeit less precise than the more common
fractal-based and polygon-based ones, is many times faster, and proves
particularly useful in interactive games.  The authors are planning to
release a spaceship-flight simulator in the first months of 1997. 

Another game-centered presentation was the one by Vittorio Ferrari, showing
his own VEGA: an engine for "Lucas' Arts"-style adventures.  Vittorio
showed off a prototype of an adventure built with VEGA, which proved indeed
quite nice (a demo should be released in a few months).  Luca Danelon and
Matteo Forniz gave a talk on their experience in Amiga CD production (they
are the people behind the nice "Amy Resource" series), while Andrea
Galimberti and Fabio Rotondo presented another adventure construction
system called DOOPSI. 

While VEGA is script-based and geared to internal use, DOOPSI offers a
number of GUI-based editors, thus allowing everybody to produce his own
adventure.  On the other hand, VEGA offers a few more features, so the
competition is open.

The last speaker of the morning was Michele Battilana, head and soul of
Cloanto Italia, that presented some data on the evolution of the Amiga
market.  Michele shocked many people among the attendance when he revealed
with a malicious double-click that the (Amiga) program he used to project
the slide on the overhead screen, was indeed running on a Win-NT laptop
thanks to UAE!  The sudden appearance of the NT desktop, however, did not
ruin the appetite of the crowd, and access to the refectory required
several minutes in the queue (the lunch was included in the admission price
of the conference: around US$38, DM60).


The Future of IPISA

After the lavish meal, Sergio Ruocco talked about the future of IPISA.  In
the opinion of the organizing committee, IPISA should open its doors to
other "alternative" systems (Linux, BeOS, NetBSD, Java machines and so on)
starting from the next edition.  The proposal, that gained a
less-than-universal consensus, aims at making IPISA a unique forum for
"rebels" that don't want to accept Micro$oft's "I'll rule the world"
attitude.  Other goals announced for the next edition were a more
significant international presence, both in attendance and in talks, and
the extension of the conference to cover two days instead of one.


Java, BeOS and Linux

Marco Zandonadi followed with a short note on Java and its strong influence
in reshaping the computer industry, a subject already familiar to many AR
readers.

The next presentation was one of the more interesting ones: the first
Italian show of the Be-Box and its BeOS.  Jean Calmon and Christophe
Droulers, both from Be Europe, demoed this very nice system that really
amazed the attendants.  Seeing four Quicktime movies, two midi streams, two
Mandelbrot programs, a 3D rendering manipulated in real time and several
other applets all running flawlessly together in the bi-processor Be-Box
led several people into unconfessable theft temptations.  Looking at BeOS
today reminded me of the thrill under my spine that I felt some ten years
ago, when I touched for the first time an Amiga.  We are lucky, that old
spirit was not lost: even in the case of the worst outcome for our beloved
Amiga, there will be an heaven for us digital romantics.

After BeOS, Linux took the scene, with a presentation by Carlo Daffara of
the latest Amiga release distributed on the IPISA CD.


Speedy Trends: Hardware, PowerPC and 3D Packages

Paolo Canali, undisputed hardware guru, followed with an overview on the
advances in digital technology: digital-analog integration, parallel
systems, advanced memory subsystems and complex custom chips -- on this
latter point, Phase V's announced dates on their dream-chip Caipirinha were
judged by Paolo as "optimistic, but not unrealistic". 

Unfortunately, Phase V was absent from the conference: Wolf Dietrich was
already scheduled for the Amiga Fest in Toronto, and Gerald Carda (Phase
V's Technical Director), who was appointed to participate, had grown very
sick.  So, Jurgen Haage and Michael Rock (from Haage & Partner) took upon
them the task of showing off the PowerUp board from Phase V.  They demoed a
Mandelbrot program, compiled with H&P's StormC 2.0, running on the PowerPC;
the gain in speed over the 68060 version was quite evident, even on the
Prototype (and slower) PowerUp card.  With the new StormC, porting a
program to PowerPC is just a matter of selecting an option in a requester:
"PowerPC" is listed alongside with "68060", "68040", and so on!

The last presentation was held by Massimiliano Marras, with his Tornado 3D.
Tornado is not just yet another raytracer and modeler: its code was finely
tuned for the 68040 and 68060, resulting in an impressive speed of the
software: what other programs render in 10 seconds, Tornado can in a
fraction of a second.  The net result, almost miraculous, is that the user
can manipulate the previews in real time with the mouse; and we are talking
about colour previews (full colour or dithered), with flat or Gouraud
shading, transparencies, textures and many other features!  Beyond its
speed, Tornado 3D has other advantages, but a full review is better left to
some more experienced 3D artist.  Tornado should be available in a short
time, at a price defined by its author as "competitive".


Final Remarks

So ended IPISA 96.  It was very heart-warming to see so many Amiga
enthusiasts gathered together, as well as seeing the fruits of ongoing
development and knowing that we are not left alone in the dark, struggling
against monopolists...

It appeared clear from the conference that many routes are opened to the
evolution of the Amiga.  IPISA 97 will tell us which of them was to be the
winning one.

            Java: What Role Will it Play in the Amiga's Future?

Copyright 1997, David Prime


For years the Amiga has struggled to establish itself in the world of
personal computing.  Now a new operating system independent software
platform has arisen to challenge Microsoft Windows for dominance of the
desktop.  This new software platform is Sun Microsystems' Java.  Java is
not a competing operating system, it is a development platform that allows
Java software to run on any operating system that supports a Java run-time
environment.  If Java is a success it could have a powerful effect on the
future of the Amiga.  The nature of this effect is not yet clear.

The heart of Java is a powerful object oriented language that is very
similar to C++.  What makes Java more than just a programming language is
the Java Virtual Machine (VM) run time environment.  The Java VM simulates
a computer in software.  A Java VM can be written for current operating
systems but the VM environment remains independent of both the host OS and
the underlying hardware.  Compilers for ordinary computer languages
generate executable binary code that is specific to a particular
microprocessor and operating system.  To make such code portable requires
that all platform specific code be rewritten and that the code be
recompiled for the new platform.  Java compilers, on the other hand,
convert source code into Java byte code that can be executed without
modification on any machine that has an implementation of the Java Virtual
Machine.  The Java VM run-time environment manages all interaction between
Java programs and the underlying operating system and hardware.  This
allows developers to master only one programming environment (the Java VM)
and produce code that will run on any Java capable platform.

There are two types of Java programs, internet applets and stand alone
applications.  Internet applets are small programs that are embedded in web
pages and are run on the viewers machine in a secured manner (limited
access to system resources i.e.  the hard disk) by Java capable browsers. 
These applets are increasing in popularity and are used to enhance the
appearance and/or functioning of a web site.  This type of internet use is
a natural for Java because the web page author generally has no control
over the type of operating system that the viewer is using.  For the applet
to function only requires that the viewer be using a Java capable browser.

The second type of Java program, stand alone applications, is much more
interesting.  The Java language and run time environment are sophisticated
enough to allow for the creation of any software application that does not
require low level operating system or hardware access.  This includes most
off the usual desktop applications such as word processors or spreadsheets.
Stand alone Java applications could be distributed on standard ISO 9660
format CD-ROMs and installed on any Java capable machine, be it Unix,
Windows, Mac or Amiga based.

Java does have its down sides and limitations, however.  Java is still very
new and its development tools are immature compared to those of other
languages and platforms.  Also programmers have less experience with
developing software for Java.  These two facts are likely to change
rapidly.  Developers are adopting Java at an unprecedented rate and Java's
similarity to C++ reduces the learning curve.

A second limitation of Java stems from the same source as its greatest
strength.  Java's portability results from the VM isolating the program
from the underlying OS and hardware.  This means that Java programs can not
fully utilized specific OS or hardware features without sacrificing cross
platform portability.   Also portability is not perfect because Java run
time environments on different platforms do not implement all features in
an identical manner.

The third significant limitation of Java is that Java code is not as fast
as native code.  Java byte code is interpreted and converted into machine
code on the fly during program execution by the Java run time environment.
For this reason C and C++ code can execute an order of magnitude faster
than Java code.  One method to speed up Java code that has been introduced
is Just in Time (JIT) compilers.  JIT compiler interprets byte code during
execution like a regular interpreter but the resulting machine code is
cached in memory during program executing.  If a piece of code is needed a
second time the cached machine code is executed.   JIT compilers can
execute Java code at approximately 50% the speed of native code.

The future may also see static Java compilers for specific platforms.  This
would allow Java applications to achieve almost C or C++ speed.  In my
opinion the best option would be a compile on install option.  Java byte
code could be distributed in a platform independent manner and the
individual Java implementations could compile the byte code into native
machine code during installation to the hard drive.  This method would
retain portability and provide good performance.  I know of no Java
implementation that supports this feature.

Also as computers continue to improve in speed, the importance of highly
efficient code will decrease for most application.  C and C++ have already
supplanted assembly code for most application development.  Even high level
languages and authoring systems, such as Visual Basic and AmigaVision, are
being used for some professional application development.

Despite its current limitations Java is receiving tremendous support and is
being heavily promoted by Sun.  Apple, IBM, Microsoft, Novell, Silicon
Graphics, Sun and others are all integrating Java run time environments
into their OSes.  Because of this Java could become the worlds largest
software platform.   The number of Java capable machines could out number
any of the platforms that support it, even Windows.  Developers have
largely been drawn to DOS and Windows because these two environments were
the most wide spread.  If in the near future Java becomes dominant will
developers switch to give it primary support?  This remains to be seen.
The first general purpose business applications for Java are already being
developed by Corel.  Corel Office for Java includes a WordPerfect based
word processor, a Quattro Pro based spreadsheet and other applications.
The performance, portability and commercial success of this product maybe a
critical test of Java.

The uncertain future of both Java and the Amiga make it hard to make any
predictions as to how Java will impact on the Amiga.   Because the Amiga OS
is currently in financial limbo there is no official development of Java
for the Amiga.  However, an independent project named P' Jami is porting
Sun's Java Development Kit and the HotJava web browser.  Another group is
porting Kaffe a freely distributable Java VM that includes JIT compilation.

If mainstream software applications become available for the Amiga by way
of Java it could strengthen the platform by retaining and attracting users.
Unfortunately, the speed issue is especially problematic for Amigas because
of the relatively slow 68K series processors they use.  However, a native
PowerPC implementation of a Java run time environment could give excellent
performance on a PowerUp card even if the OS has not been completely
ported.  The wide spread availability of Java applications could also hurt
the native Amiga developers who know the machine best and can get the most
out of it.  If these developers lose their market to Java applications then
the Amiga will die as any but a Java host.  I doubt the platform would last
long on that basis.

If Java succeeds to the extent that some people predict the only
applications not written in Java will be speed critical or specialized
applications which require specific OS or hardware resources.  If this
comes to pass, OSes of the future may be judged by their ability to
effectively run a Java VM.

                             Review: Aminet 17
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

I'm now fully convinced it's a battle of wills.  Aminet CDs will continue
to come out in direct defiance of magazine reviewers who have already
surrendered the battle to try to come up with new, interesting ways to say
good things about them.  Urban Mueller is rubbing it in, that's all. :)

Actually, Aminet 17 has a merciful enough amount of difference from Aminet
16 to allow me to make at least a few comments.  The commercial
"coverdisk" package is back in the form of Personal Write.  This text
editor/word processor was showing its age when it appeared on Cloanto's
Personal Suite CD (the only lowlight of that otherwise excellent CD).  Now
it can only be called an anachronism.  Perhaps its most important role on
the CD is that you'll click on the "commercial" link in the typically
excellent Amigaguide interface and see ads for Cloanto's software line,
highlighted by Personal Paint 7 and the Personal Suite CD.

Aminet has received a large influx of mods and picture submissions over the
past months, and the bulk of the files are indeed mods, pictures, and
demos.  As ever, the latest Amiga Reports have been included, and the CD is
rounded out with what I can only keep referring to as the collective wisdom
of the Amiga community.

Perhaps it's been too long since the Amiga community has been reminded of
this, so I'll spell it out explicitly.  We are incredibly lucky to have
Aminet.  Not only is it a huge and reliable resource, but it has
organization which is completely alien to the large FTP archives of other
platforms.  Nowhere else have I seen anything that comes close--not in the
huge PC archives, not in the more special interest archives like those for
Psion users.  The system Aminet is organized on is nothing special: two
levels of directory hierarchy, required mini-descriptions, and a catalog of
recent files.  But it's amazing how nobody else seems to be able to pull
this off.

Anyway, enough of that.  A new Aminet Set 4 is out, we'll have coverage of
that next month.  At least those are infrequent enough that I can catch my
breath inbetween their issuances...but as Aminet grows, their frequency is
becoming more noticable...soon, I'll be at a loss for words on yet another
product...

===========================================================================
                               Review: FG24
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

I drew all sorts of parallels between Elsat and Newtek in the first draft
of this review.  Newtek started their rise to stardom with the Digi-View
slow-scan greyscale video digitizer, and look where they are now.  However,
then I lost the review in another fine example of why sometimes you want to
double-check your filenames before you save...

...so I'll be quicker about it this time.  Times have changed and the
Digi-View, while still charming to some, has had its run.  A new breed of
video digitizer is here from Elsat of Poland.  The FG24 (or Pro-Grab RT as
it is known in some markets, but we'll call it the FG24 here) offers
realtime 24-bit video snapshotting from a composite or S-Video/SCART
(depending on your locale) input.

The FG24 is an unassuming grey box with a parallel interface port, one or
two video input ports (S-Video/SCART is an option), and a couple of LEDs.
It draws power from a separate power supply, which you'll have to provide
your own of if you're outside Europe.  It's a fairly common spec: 9 V, at
least 700 mA of current.  (Elsat reports that one of their users told them
they got by with 500 mA, but it's not recommended.) I used a full 1 A
adapter, so no problems here.

Hooking up the FG24 is very simple.  A parallel cable is included, or if
you're using the A1200 PCMCIA option, you simply plug that in.  Connect
your video source and power supply, and that's it.

The software is easy to install off the single floppy, and contains online
documentation only, which is decently written and adequate but not
extravagant.  (AmigaGuide format only.)

There are two ways to drive the FG24--through the custom software included
on disk, and through the "ProGrab RT" GIO driver included with Photogenics
1.2 and up.  Personally, I find the Photogenics interface to be superior,
because PGX is a full-featured image processing program and you'll be
likely to want to tweak your image once it's grabbed.

In case you're not a Photogenics user, though, you'll have to get familiar
with the FG24 software.  I did, using the CD32 "no disc in drive" animation
through the S-Video port to get acclimated to the way the FG24 software
operates.  The basic process is this:  You pre-select the video type and
resolution you'll be grabbing, then go to the preview/grab screen (which
uses overlayed screens so is not very graphic-board compatible, another
good argument for using the Photogenics grabber).  You hold down the mouse
button to start viewing the small greyscale previews of the video being fed
to the FG24.  When you see what you like, just let go and the grab is made.

You can then save off the 24-bit buffer for later manipulation in an image
processor, or make some rudimentary adjustments from the FG24 software.  I
recommend the former, since the options are not as well documented as they
might be.

I noticed that most grabs came out needing a slight color correction from
the actual video signal, easily done in an image processor.  The grabs
themselves were of impeccable quality most of the time, although there was
the occasional line static on some grabs.

The PCMCIA option allows you to digitize, at a low rate of speed, live
video.  It even allows synching with a digitizer for included sound.  Neat,
but it's rather RAM hungry.

The FG24 is a high-class device.  Using the Photogenics loader is the way
to really get the most out of it, but if you can't just be sure you save
off the FG24 image as a 24-bit buffer and load it into your image processor
of choice.  If you're looking for a step up from a Digiview or the like, or
simply are looking to get high-quality video scans on your Amiga,
professionally or as a hobby, give the FG24 serious consideration.

===========================================================================
                         Review: Personal Paint 7
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

For the past few years, Personal Paint has been surreptitiously
establishing itself as the premier Amiga paint package for non-truecolor
(24-bit) applications.  With the release of PPaint 7, they've sealed it.

Cloanto's Personal Paint is not just distinguished by the fact that it has
outlasted the former crown princes of paint on the Amiga, DPaint and
Brilliance, although it certainly has.  It's carved out a special place by
offering a very complete set of features, putting it at a reasonable price,
and wrapping all of that in true-to-form great Cloanto packaging. :)

It's a bit of an inside joke now that any Cloanto product has to have
eye-catching packaging.  Earlier PPaints shipped in full-color
binder/manual combinations with full-color disk labels.  But PPaint 7 is a
CD-ROM, and not just any regular CD-ROM but a Mini-CD, a format usually
reserved for promotional CD audio singles.  It's a perfectly valid data
format, however, and was perfect for the space needs of PPaint 7 (just
under 60 megs, the maximum of the mini-CD format).  This, I believe, makes
it the smallest piece of Amiga software ever shipped, since a Mini-CD takes
up less area than even a single floppy disk.  The small folding holder it
comes in is quite nice, and was given out on bright red ribbons at the
Computer '96 show in Cologne.  Most CD-ROM drives have grooves in their
trays to allow for mini-CDs, if yours doesn't or you use a CD caddy system,
you can get an adapter from Cloanto or elsewhere.

But the painting's the important part.  Cloanto's PPaint 7 is fully RTG
capable, and most particularly is CyberGraphX aware and can exploit it to
the fullest, including taking advantage of CyberGraphX to make PPaint 7
totally chip-RAM free, if desired.  PPaint 7, like its predecessors, does
more than just basic image conversion, allowing you to load and save in a
variety of formats, but it provides for some image processing as well.  And
PPaint 7 allows the creation of the Latest Big Thing in Internet graphics,
namely GIF Animations.

Getting PPaint 7 installed is a snap.  Actually, you don't have to even
bother if you prefer, since PPaint 7 will load directly from CD.  If not,
there's a standard Installer program (strangely holed away in a
subdirectory on the CD) which will throw the program onto a hard drive for
you.

The documentation, as should be no surprise by now, is entirely online in
AmigaGuide format.  You can almost always pull up an index of links in the
document, making it easier to find what you're looking for.  The manual
does show some vestiges of older versions (including references to backing
up disks, etc.) but has been updated to reflect the new version's features.

PPaint's drawing interface reflects the generally accepted ways to work in
a modern paint program, so there is not a high learning curve if you are
unfamiliar with PPaint.  Some of the menu options could be more logically
laid out, but my suspicion is that they've been placed where they are to
more closely resemble DPaint than anything else.  My major complaint is
that the screenmode is not set under "Graphics", but instead in the image's
characteristics.

What impresses me most about PPaint is the its breadth.  Typically, DPaint
and Brilliance advocates expounded on one or two characteristics that they
excelled at, but without which they'd be happy to leave their program.
PPaint offers the features of image converter and processor as well as
painter and animator.  PPaint 7 has integrated ARexx support with a number
of built-in scripts.  Among other things, this means that PPaint can be
used in tandem with, say, ImageFX to create some absolutely stunning images
and animations.  IFX's strong point is image processing, not drawing,
although in a pinch it can be used as such.  Adding PPaint to the equation
opens things up much wider.

Nobody's perfect, of course.  PPaint does not have the same "power at your
fingertips" feel of Brilliance's custom GUI, which seemed to make
everything an icon click or two away.  The features are there in PPaint,
they're just t  If you're a TrueBrilliance user, you
may have to stick to your guns, or investigate XiPaint 4, since PPaint will
not indulge a desire to paint in HAM modes.

Most new Amiga owners should at least have a passing familiarity with
PPaint, as it was part of AT's bundle program.  Others may have first
encountered PPaint in the Personal Suite CD-ROM.  For these users, PPaint
is worth the upgrade for the added RTG capabilities and the added animation
capabilities.  PPaint is fully 060 compatible, and the chip RAM
independence means it will work properly on Dracos.

If you've not yet used PPaint, it would be worth your while to investigate
your options.  PPaint is actively and aggressively supported by Cloanto,
not a product at the end of its lifecycle, unsupported by a disinterested
company.  For the US$75 or so it will run you, you'll gain a lot in power,
capabilities, and peace of mind.

===========================================================================
                  Review: System Booster from Schatztruhe
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

It seems like there's no shortage of freely available utilities and tools
to enhance your Amiga experience.  To prove the point, Schatztruhe compiled
System Booster, a CD with around 600 megs of programs to do everything from
hard drive salvage to kill viruses.  Much of the software is unarchived on
the CD, ready to run.

System Booster was actually intended to be the third "issue" in
Schatztruhe's "Amiga CD-Sensation" series, which consisted of CDs in
plastic sleeves attached to magazine-sized sheets of cardboard.  The first,
Demos are Forever and Golden Games, were actually sold through conventional
magazine distribution channels as an experiment.  Unfortunately, the
experiment did not go all that well, so after System Booster returned from
CD duplication, the CD-Sensation line was scrapped.  System Booster is sold
in a typical jewel case through the regular Amiga channels.

The documentation for the CD itself is provided in both English and German,
and an AmigaGuide interface catalogues the CD's contents, and more
importantly, has links to all of the documentation for all of the
unarchived software, which is a very useful feature if you're trying to
decide which tool you want to install on your machine next.

As general-interest Amiga software CD compilations go, this one is pretty
good by all accounts.  The variety of software is thorough, there is a nice
amount of good quality fonts, who all have previews directly loadable
through the AmigaGuide interface, and the installation is easy--you're
advised to use the "assigns" icon so that most everything can directly run
from CD, but using the "colors" is optional.

The most notable omission would have to be a search utility.  This is not
an unforgivable problem, but it's an oversight.

The collection of software is, on the whole, recent enough to make owning
the CD valuable, although you may want to check Aminet for updates to
programs you find you like.  Of course, it's not exactly going to be
shocking when I point out that this software's origin was, by and large,
Aminet itself, so if you're an Aminet completist and are comfortable
navigating through the Aminet Sets and the Aminet itself, System Booster
may not be necessary to have.

===========================================================================
                        Review: Wordworth Office CD
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Finally, somebody's done the blatantly obvious.

For years now, ever since it became very clear that Amiga software on CD
was a very reasonable, inexpensive, and easily distributable method of
getting quality products to customers, both members of the Final Writer and
Wordworth camps have tried to convince Softwood and Digita, respectively,
that what would REALLY make good sense would be for the companies to
release "Office" CD-ROMs, in the same vein as Microsoft Office, full of
their entire business software libraries.

The closest I've seen for Softwood's titles have been dealers who sold
Final Writer, Final Data, and Final Calc as bundles at a package discount.

Digita, however, has done the obvious thing, and stuffed Wordworth 6,
Datastore 2, Organiser 2, and Money Matters 4 onto a CD-ROM.

Reviews of these titles as independent entities have been done elsewhere,
and it is true enough that the "upgrade" element to Wordworth 6 from 5 is
fairly limited.

However, the bundle is what's on trial here, so to speak.  Digita will sell
you Wordworth 6 separately for UKP40 (Or roughly US$65, make allowances for
small distribution markups and such.)  However, for an extra UKP 10 (US$16
or so), you can have the Office CD.  Not too shabby...

Wordworth, as Digita claims, is the world's most popular Amiga word
processor.  This is not entirely surprising since Digita was able to close
a deal with AT to put Wordworth on all of its Amigas, and have been selling
their product for years now.  In version 6, users are treated to new
drawing tools, expanded RTF support (to link Wordworth documents to the
rest of the world, so to speak), and an expanded base of ARexx commands.
The functional engine of Wordworth is still the rather solid foundation of
Wordworth 5.  Wordworth supports integration with TurboCalc for importing
tables directly from the spreadsheet program, and offers more than a basic
set of word processor features.

For a long-time member of the Final Writer camp, WW is not all that much of
a departure.  The interfaces are different, but not so far as to cause
panic.  Both have been closely competitive for some time, and each has
their individual advantages over the other.  But for text layout and
creation, you'll hardly notice the difference--drag and drop, auto correct,
they're all there.  For my purposes, I notice that WW 6 has what Final
Writer dropped: a simple Statistics calculator.  (Final Writer now sports a
very complex document statistics option, which calculates the grade level
you're writing at by a variety of methods.  This is actually nice to know,
but changes the process of just counting lines and paragraphs into
something that takes a measurable amount of time, rather than a more or
less instantaneous answer.)  FW does have the notable advantage of a
grammar checker.

Wordworth goes out of its way to help you find a suitable printer, and
comes with presets for a large number.  The online documentation is
supplied in text and AmigaGuide format at the press of a button, and is
broken down into digestible pieces, including lists of new features in the
last few versions.

If you've got an AT-era Amiga, you should have at least a passing
familiarity with Datastore and Organiser.  Organiser is just that: a
personal "keep your appointments, dates, and phone numbers" straight
utility, in the tradition of On the Ball and countless others.  Organiser
is very attractive and easy to navigate, but I prefer my Psion.

Datastore is a simple (non-relational) database program.  A number of very
attractive (For database files, anyway) examples are included to give you
the general idea.  Datastore hasn't seen much significant improvement since
1994, but it's a solid application.

Money Matters 4.  This program is heavily aimed at British consumers, so I
don't think my insight will be too valuable.  There are good tips for
anybody who has bills to pay, and you might actually be able to get
acceptable results by pretending that you're really talking about your
local unit of currency, but it'll be an adventure.

The good news is that all of the applications except MM 4 appear stable in
an 060/CyberGraphX environment, and typically will run with anywhere from 1
to 3 megs of RAM at full capacity.  Money Matters seems unable to remember
its RTG screenmode setting, and when exiting likes to crash.  The bad news
is that the installer program is not quite as respectful of the "Expert"
option as one might hope.  Specifically, if you have multiple SYS: assigns,
it will pick the first one, and if that partition is full, the installation
aborts.  It would have been far better to respect "Expert" and prompt for
drawers for system files such as the fonts the programs like to install.


The Wordworth Office is available in both German and English.  The price
makes it almost silly not to pick up the Office CD over the regular WW 6 if
you have the choice.  Upgrades are offered from earlier versions of
Wordworth.

                          Review: Chaos Engine 2
                            By: @{" Ken Anderson " link KEN}
===========================================================================

There was a time when eagerly-awaited games were nothing special.
Every couple of weeks, the games community would hold its collective
breath as the release of another blockbuster title loomed, only to forget it
moments after it actually arrived, in favour of the next Big Thing. Sadly,
Big Things aren't that common these days, but there's always the odd
glimmer of hope, and this time it*s in the shape of The Chaos Engine 2
(TCE2). 

The Bitmap Brothers were the original "pop star" programmers, regularly
pictured looking moody and wearing shades.  For a while, they more or less
dominated the 16-bit games market with classics such as Xenon, Gods and
Cadaver.  Classy graphics, stomping music by some of the industries best,
and gameplay at a tangent to the norm added the Bitmaps to the Amiga Hall
of Fame.  The Chaos Engine was their last hit; an odd combination of
puzzles and killing, with most people either loved or loathed.

TCE2, like its older brother, is inherently a two-player game. When
playing solo, the computer takes over as the other character, reacting
intelligently to your actions. However, whereas the original game had the
computer helping you out, TCE2 sets you against the Amiga player.

You have a choice of 4 characters for yourself and your opponent; all with
the expected strengths and weaknesses in terms of speed, weapon and
intellegence.  Then it's off into the arenas, in a straight contest for
points.  Every level has set challenges and puzzles - kill this, pick up
that, push the other and so on; nothing so taxing you'll be there for hours
trying to work out what to do.  Of course, there are the usual array of
creatures in your path to stop you, but they can soon be dispatched with a
blast or two from your weapon.

Every monster killed, lock opened or puzzle solved earns the player
points, and it's the one with the most points at the end of the level that
wins. Lose, and it's minus one life and back for another try. Win, and it's
onto the next level, with a possible weapon upgrade or an extra life if
you earned enough points.

The levels themselves are roughly similar in design and appearance to the
first game, although not nearly as complicated.  As you would expect from
the Bitmaps, the graphics are absolutely superb, with a fine eye for detail
and imagination.  The music is strange atmospheric stuff, which changes
depending on the current state of play, but never actually gets in the way
of the sound effects.

If it were just running around, picking up keys and opening locks to gain
points, TCE2 would come off worse in comparison with its prequel.  It
doesn't have the same puzzle-solving element, and is lacking in atmosphere
- and originality - by comparison.  The big difference is in the computer
player.  By pitting you against the computer, you now have a much deadlier
enemy; one who doesn*t want to kill you, just to beat you.  Stand around
doing nothing, and your opponent will quiet happily complete the level by
himself, scooping all the points and losing you lives.  It learns by
mistakes.  Employ the tactic of waiting for him to pick up all the required
items before beating him up and stealing them all might end up in him doing
the same to you next level.  All of this greatly extends the games lifetime
- each game is rarely the same, because the computer might try something
different this time.  You might even end up shouting "I saw that key first
you #?@%!" at your poor Amiga, which may cause distress to close relatives.

TCE2 doesn't install on a hard drive, which is surely just laziness on the
coders' part. Apart from this, TCE2 is a triumph; a perfect arcade game
that combines action with intellegence. If you liked the original, you'll
already have bought the sequel. Even if you didn't enjoy the original
Engine, TCE2 offers an insight of what the Amiga does best - a playable,
addictive game with just a little bit of thought required.

Pros: Clever and well-drawn graphics, and thoughtfully created levels
result in a game you enjoy competing against.  The computer opponents are
truly intelligent, but never unfair.  A rare two-player that works just as
well with only one human.

Cons: No HD install.  Sometimes just a bit difficult to work out what is
required to complete a level.  May cause you to shout at inanimate objects.

@node REVIEW7 "Review: CD32 ProModule"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                     Review: CD32 ProModule from Elsat
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

About two and a half years ago, I conducted a lengthy review of the CD32's
first commercial expansion unit, the SX-1.  Produced by Paravision after
the company acquired MicroBotics, the SX-1 brought a number of features to
the CD32 that were just waiting to be exploited in its Amiga
architecture--a serial port, parallel port, IDE controller, external floppy
port, RGB out, PC keyboard port, and SIMM slot, to name the most important
features.  It made it to market, sold quite a few units, and allowed such
Amiga based devices as the MagicBox to be born.

The SX-1 was not without its problems, however.  It increased the CD32's
footprint by about 50%, an unwieldy L shaped monster.  The RGB port was
positioned in such a way that if you used a silver box VGA adapter, the
power cable was a tight fit into the CD32.  If you hooked up a hard drive,
you were pretty sure to have power problems if you had a SIMM or external
floppy as well, requiring you replace your CD32 power supply.  And worst of
all, the SX-1's physical connection to the CD32 was VERY precarious, so
that the slightest nudge could be enough to crash the machine and require
you jostle around with the SX-1 to get the connection solid again.

Of all the complaints filed against the SX-1, this last was the most
severe.  People wondered why the SX-1 wasn't built to sit UNDER the CD32,
which seemed to make a lot more sense.  Paravision, and then their
absorbing creditor, Hi-Tech Components, made vague promises of a future
030-based CD32 expansion which would fix all these problems.  But this has
never happened.  Somebody--Elsat of Poland, to be specific--did something
about it.

The CD32 ProModule is a black metal enclosure, with the footprint of the
CD32 and about half the height.  Some units come with a front-facing
built-in floppy drive (double density, much like the modified PC drives
used by AT in A1200s and A4000Ts).  On the back of the unit is the physical
connector for the unit, a power socket for an external power supply (if
necessary, Elsat only recommends it if you fully load the unit with
peripherals), the RGB port, and the external floppy port.  There is also a
memory-disable switch to kill the installed SIMM for picky games.

Along the left edge (underneath the CD32's joystick/AUX ports) are the
25-pin serial and parallel ports, as well as a 5-pin AT Keyboard port.

So far, so good.  If you remove the top of the ProModule's case, you're
treated to the underside of the Promodule's PCB, where there is the barest
minimum of user-servicable components--a SIMM slot, where you can install a
SIMM up to 8 megs (but a 1 meg SIMM is not allowed--odd, but true), the
floppy drive and connector, the IDE port and a standard 4-pin power plug,
and a few jumpers.  The IDE port, mounting space, and power all presume a
3.5 inch IDE drive, which sets the ProModule apart from its counterpart
SX-1 and SX32 expansion units which expect more expensive 2.5 inch drives.
The ProModule has the real estate for a 3.5 inch drive, so why not use it?
The last option is the FPU socket and crystal port.  This is the most
curious feature of the ProModule, although it is not inconceivable that
someone dabbling with rendering or image processing could make use of a
ProModule-equipped CD32 for some basic work.

Installation of your options is fairly easy, as the ProModule is held
together by a few small screws and the top lifts off without problems.
Getting the unit itself mated to the CD32 was actually more challenging
than I anticipated, but nowhere NEAR the headaches of the SX-1 or SX32 (the
former's problems are outlined above, and the latter requires you open the
CD32's case, a scary experience since it's not the most solidly built Amiga
on record and parts are scarce).  Once connected, it's far more stable than
the SX-1, but doesn't have the "solidly bolted in" aspect of the SX32.
It's worth noting here that if you're one of the lucky people who has a
Commodore FMV module, the ProModule provides a passthrough for the unit.
We don't have one so we were unable to test this particular feature.

The ProModule is as transparent or as visible as you make it.  The memory
disable switch is a nice feature, making it the only CD32 expansion with
one.  (The SX32 lacks a disable switch of any kind, and the "disable"
switch of the SX-1 disables just about everything BUT the memory, which was
a strange choice since the memory is the #1 cause of CD32 game
incompatibilities.)  The floppy drive performed adequately, and while Elsat
warns of some compatibility problems with trackloaders, Sensible Soccer
behaved itself.  My Dell HD floppy also spun up and functioned just find
off of the external port.

The AT keyboard performs adequately, but be ready for yet another variation
of keyboard layout.  The SX-1 mapped the Amiga keys to F11 and F12.  Elsat
instead maps the Amiga keys to the PC control keys (meaning they're roughly
in the "right place" and relegates Control to F11 and F12.  It's not a
terrible idea, but feels about as clumsy.  Fortunately, Elsat tells me they
have a 104-key support upgrade chip which presumably is shipping in their
newest models.

The documentation of the unit is sufficient, but poorly edited--some text
is lost between pages 1 and 2 of the manual, and text is lost between pages
3 and 4 as well.

Stacking the Promodule up against the competition:

It's pretty clear that the ProModule supercedes the SX-1.  It provides the
same functionality, but better, in a more stable fashion with extra
features.  

Compared to the original SX32, they are close to being in the same league--
ProModule Advantages: 3.5 inch IDE HD, built-in floppy, memory disable, FMV
passthrough
SX32 Advantages: Built-in VGA (15 pin) output, entire unit contained inside
the CD32 for transportability and aesthetic value.  Of course, you can put
a silver box on a ProModule, just as you can any regular Amiga 23 pin port,
but the SX32's built in adapter is a good idea.

It's not quite fair to compare the ProModule to the new SX32 Pro, which
boasts an 030/50 accelerator, since we have not yet actually reviewed the
SX32 Pro.  Clearly, that sets it a breed apart.

If you're a SX32 user, then, you may want to think twice about making the
switch to the ProModule.  However, if you're a disgruntled SX-1 user or
have not yet realized the full potential of your CD32, the ProModule is
worth some very serious consideration.

Elsat's current pricing: ProModule, with built-in double density floppy, is
$229.00 to the US, including international shipping.  Prices elsewhere in
the world may vary, contact your distributor or Elsat for details.

                        Amiga Report Mailing List
===========================================================================

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to majordomo@ninemoons.com

Your subject header will be ignored.  In the body of the message, enter

subscribe areport

The system will automatically pull your e-mail address from the message
header.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!             **

                          UUDecoding Amiga Report
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

                      Amiga Report Writing Guidelines
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

     4.  Please send us your article in ASCII format.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.

Please stipulate as well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to

                    CalWeb: The Home of the Amiga Zone!
===========================================================================

AMIGA ZONE MOVES TO CALWEB!

THE AMIGA ZONE MOVES FROM PORTAL TO CALWEB INTERNET SERVICES

For over ten years the Amiga Zone has been an online resource, home,
community, oasis, for Amiga owners.

For over ten years I've made my living running the Zone and supporting Amiga
users all over the USA, Canada, and the world.

Five years ago when American People/Link pulled their own plug, we had to
find the Zone a new home and we found a good one on the Portal Online
System. 

Well, it's happened again.. Portal has informed all of its customers that
its ten year history as an online service and Internet provider is coming to
an end on Sept. 30, 1996.  This is very sad, it's short-notice, and the
decision is completely out of my control, but it's also irreversible.  

Portal is changing its entire business plan from being an ISP to selling an
accounting system to other online services.  

So be it. It's sad, but like I said, the Zone went through this before and
now we'll go through it again, and come out the other side better and wiser.

THE AMIGA ZONE IS MOVING TO CALWEB INTERNET SERVICES.

CalWeb (http://www.calweb.com) is a two year old Internet provider located
in Sacramento, CA.  It has a good sized customer base, and very
knowledgeable support staff. 

It's also run by a long time Amiga owner who has been a friend of mine for
many years.

The world of modeming has changed much in the last ten years.  In 1985 you
had very few choices and you had 1200 baud.  These days, everyone and his
dog has an ISP running and a web page

But the vast majority of those providers don't know an Amiga from a hole in
the ground, and could care less about Amiga owners.  Say "AWeb" or
"IBrowse" to them and they'll say "Omega?  Amoeba?  What?  Huh?  They still
make those things?"

CalWeb is different because it's the new home of the Amiga Zone.

In October 1996, a new custom front-end menued system will be added to
CalWeb to host the Zone.  It'll have features for Zone users that neither
Plink nor Portal ever had nor were they willing to add.

The tradition of a friendly online Amiga community, run by long time Amiga
owners, users and lovers will continue. 

Message bases, huge file libraries (we plan to move over the 20,000+ files
we have on the Zone on Portal to CalWeb, MANY of which you'll never see on
Aminet or anywhere else), live nightly chats, vendor support and our famous
prize contests will continue.

We've given away tens of thousands of dollars worth of Amiga prizes in the
last ten years.  No one else even comes close. 

I urge any and all of you who were on Plink, or who are now on Portal or
who may have left Portal..  or even if you were never on either but used or
still use another online service to join CalWeb for the Amiga Zone.  I
personally promise you the best online Amiga community we can possibly
build.  You will not be disappointed.


CalWeb has arranged a special signup offer for you!

Call:
 1-800-509-9322
  or
 1-916-641-9320
  or telnet to calweb.com, login as "guest", and follow the prompts. 

You can join CalWeb for US$19.95 flat, a month.

CalWeb takes major credit cards or you can establish a monthly invoiced
account if you don't have plastic.

The signup is FREE.

To get this deal you must say "THE AMIGA ZONE SENT ME" when you call or
signup online. 

I hope to see lots of you join CalWeb.  You can telnet into it from
anywhere for no hourly charges at all.  Your $19.95/mo fee covers
everything and also gets you ten meg of storage which includes hosting your
own personal web page.  Naturally, when the Zone opens there, you'll have
unlimited use of all of its features and areas.  Never a "money meter"
clock to worry about.

Your personal or business CalWeb Web pages are maintained by you via FTP. 
It's pretty slick.  You can make a net connection to the server with any
Amiga FTP client, put your files onto it, the permissions are automatically
set (no "chmod-ing" required!) and flip to your running browser and see the
changes instantly.

The Amiga Zone's new home is already up at:

         http://www.amigazone.com

running on CalWeb's server.  Ckeck it out!

Please feel free to write to me at harv@amigazone.com or harv@cup.portal.com
if you want more information.

Remember to say "THE AMIGA ZONE SENT ME!" when you join.

A splendid time is guaranteed for all.  

Please plan to join us in the Amiga Zone on CalWeb!
