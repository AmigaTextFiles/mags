Well, well, well.  It's starting to feel like home again, this whole "no
Amiga sale resolution, wait until next week" routine.

Another week has closed without any solid resolution of the Amiga deal.
Still we hear companies claiming that they are still in the running, now
Petro Tyschtschenko has been quoted in e-mail as telling people he hopes to
have lots of good news next week, and still we wait.

The February 28th "well, we'd like to have it done by this date" has of
course been and gone.  Hembach's US lawyer has little he wants to
discuss--because he's smart enough not to let himself get dragged into the
public abuse arena.  The same goes for the companies who are rumored to be
involved in the running but have not stepped forward.  Much as it
frustrates users and journalists alike, it's better for the interests of
the company involved to keep their mouth shut and go about their business
until they have something real to talk about.

So, those of us on the front lines continue to watch, and try to keep
abreast of the rest of the market as it evolves.  The Gateway Amiga show in
St. Louis, USA was a resounding success, and the upcoming shows in
Scandinavia and the UK this spring look like they'll be just as vibrant.
Innovative products are still pouring forth--a developer PPC board was at
the Gateway show, and in this issue we profile three high-speed
accelerators for A3000/4000 machines, as well as two new graphics cards.
Not too bad, eh?

Phase5 has also announced retail availability in the spring (April/May) for
consumer PowerPC boards, at very competitive pricing.  You have to BYO
68030, 68040, or 68060 (depending on the model) but it's still not bad.
Check the headline news items for more information.

Keep your eyes open!  There's a lot going on out there.  See you again,
hopefully sooner rather than later.  (We're still fighting the clock to get
these things out closer to biweekly, but it's tough...)

What's The Informer?  The Amiga Informer (ISSN 1089-4616) is a B&W Amiga
print Zine full of information and contacts that help readers stay
connected with new developments and products.  It features reviews,
interviews, announcements, contacts and news.  The Informer's staff are all
committed and passionate Amiga users, and are proud to produce the entire
newsletter using only Amiga computers.  Issue 6, our latest issue,
represents our first full year of production.  During this year we have
grown from an 8 page newsletter, to a 24 page mini magazine. 

The Informer offers readers concise, capsulated information that is easy to
read and quickly digested.  We fill every space of our Zine with content
and don't run oversized screen shots or needless fluff.  Where ever
possible, we provide readers with Email addresses, BBS listings, Web Page
URL's, and phone and FAX numbers to help you communicate with dealers,
developers and Amiga services. 

The Amiga Informer currently has a circulation of 5000, distributed
directly to active Amiga users bimonthly.  We are growing, not shrinking,
and plan to ad content rich article and columns as we grow.  We want
developers to be part of our publication and encourage them to send us
review products, announcements, company profiles and interviews.  In this
way, The Amiga Informer can bring both users and developers together and
fill the void of Amiga information.

The Informer is printed 6 times a year and subscriptions costs are: 
US $14 to USA subscribers; 
US $16 to Canadian subscribers; 
and US $21 to all other subscribers.

@node AD4 "AudioLab16R2 For Professional Amiga Audio"
@toc COMMERCIAL

Contact AudioLab's Developers: maurizio@ivg.it via e-mail.

AudioLab16R2 is a professional digital audio postproduction application for
platforms running AmigaOS-compatible operating systems (currently Amigas
and Dracos).

Different versions are available for every ZII/ZIII audio boards in
production or, if you don't have a board yet, the standard Amiga chipset
(Standard version only).

With AudioLab16 you can perform any kind of creative modifications or
quality restorations on audio signals and produce studio quality digital
masters from multitrack projects (see details below).

Featuring over 4MB of optimized source code, more than 70 windows and
hundreds of controls, AudioLab16R2 is the largest audio processing/editing
system ever developed for AmigaOS.


The following manifacturers are active technical partners, providing
official drivers and selling specific AudioLab16R2 versions for their
boards:

Every version, excluding the Maestro one, is available NOW.


AudioLab16R2: technical details

< Direct-from-disk tecnology >

Any operation is performed in direct-from-disk mode: audio-streams
durations are limited by disk space availability, not RAM space
availability.

- Maximum audio streams size: 2 gigabytes each
- OS volumes are supported: no special partitioning is needed
- Multitrack mode allows spreading a single project over hard-drives, ram
   drives, magneto-optical drives, cdrom drives (AsimWare AsimCDFS3.5+
   required for DOS level access to AudioCDs) operating simultaneously in
   direct-from-disk mode

< Realtime output >

The results of processing, non-linear editing and mixing operations can be
monitored in realtime, 16bit mode, through analog or digital outputs.

- 32KHz/44.1KHz/48KHz           (board dependent)
- Eight 16bit channels
- Analog and/or digital outputs (board dependent)


< Non linear multitrack editing >

Non linear editing capabilities allow rearranging the temporal sequence of
audio events without changing the structure of the original streams.  The
process is also non-destructive (original material is not modified during
cut&paste operations).

- Sixteen non linear tracks editing 
- Up to eight tracks on simultaneous playback 
- Multitrack graphic timeline 
- Double timecode notation (hh:mm:ss:ff and bars:beats:clocks) with
    autosnap-to-grid capabilities 
- Drag and drop mouse control (time slipping, cloning, aligning,...)
    for events and tracks 
- Clear/cut/copy/paste/insert/multi-insert on up to 16 tracks at the
    same time 

- Multilayer mixing controls: indipendent event level and stereo pan
    controls, indipendent track level and stereo pan controls, master level
    controls, mute/solo switches
- Insertion/retrival of user defined text labels (comments) onto the
    timeline 
- Timeline views snapshot bank 


< Digital signal processing >

Digital signal processing operators allow signal restoration, optimization
and creative modifications.

- noise gate 
- delay 
- flange 
- multiflange 
- invert 
- pitch-shift 
- time compress/expand 
- sample rate convert 
- interpolate 
- decimate 
- distort 
- FIR/IIR filter 
- reverberate 
- hum-remove 
- quantize 
- reverse 
- normalize 


< Waveform display >

Graphic waveform display allows visual inspection and easy interaction
during ranges definition.

- Graphic waveform display for on-disk recordings 
- User configurable graph resolution/speed to match different media
    seeking speeds (hard-drives, magneto-opticals, AudioCDs, ...) 
- Bi-dimensional zooms 
- Extensive range management and monitoring: monitor range, before range
    start, range start, range end, after range end ,... 


< Signal generation >

Reference signals are usefull for testing and tuning equipement.

- Multiwaveform generator 
    Impulse
    Noise
    Sine
    Square
    Triangle
- Sweep generator 



< AudioCD management >

Audio effects libraries are available on AudioCDs.  AudioLab16 can
digitally transfer the AudioCD tracks to your hard drive, to include them
in your multitrack projects.

- Transport controls (play/stop/eject/...) 
- TOC management 
- Digital audio transfers from AudioCDs to hard drives (compatible CDROM
    unit required)



< Playback triggering >

AudioLab16 can be slaved to an external MIDI hardware device or to a
concurrent Amiga software application in order to playback on-disk
recordings with accurate sincronization.

- Direct-from-disk playback triggering via external MIDI devices (MIDI
   interface required), applications capable of sending AREXX commands or,
   manually, via the computer keyboard

- Zero-delay reaction to NOTE_ON commands: perfect sincronization with
   external events
- Juke-box mode: audio streams can be selected (and played) via
   MIDI/AREXX/keyboard commands


< FIR filter design >

The "FIR Filter" DSP operator can reads ASCII text files defining different
FIR structures.  AudioLab16 can generate such text files depending on user
preferred filter specs (cutoff frequency, taps,...).

With all the waiting and hoping regarding the sale of the rights to the
Amiga I can report at least one small beam of light: I called QuikPak with
a minor question via email and got an -immediate- reply via email that was
friendly and helpful.  My thanx to Jennifer Witt-Conklin of QuikPak.  I
work as a technical rep and it's great to run into other orginizations that
respond.  I think this may bode well if QuikPak is successful.

Subject: Re: AR 5.02

Jason,

My deepest gratitude to you for publishing the Amiga Report and
distributing via e-mail; the journalistic quality is absolutely top notch.
I hope you profit greatly from your involvement with the Amiga.  You have
given so much of such great value to this community.

I seem to be receiving duplicate copies of the Amiga Report Magazine.  Back
in December, I had missed an issue or two, so I resubscribed, and since
then I've been receiving two copies.  I can't find any difference in the
headers, but I have included them below in case they may some help to you.

This is not any problem to me, but in the interest of conserving net
bandwidth, and keeping your distribution list no longer than necessary, I
am offering this information.

Thanks again for a very fine publication.

Best regards,

Mike Fischer


    - Well, the bad news is that I couldn't track down the duplicate copy
      problem, but it's a nice letter anyway. :)  -Jason

Subject: Re: Just Use It!

[In reference to David Prime's opinion piece in ar502: ]

Hi David,

I've read your lines in AmigaReport and just couldn't agree more.  I use
the Amiga for a large Fantasy-Project called MYRA (based on a noncommercial
Play-by-Mail game) and there is no computer like it for this - for the
Amiga we have several small programs, quiz, educational and AmigaGuides,
for the PC we have only unfinished projects...  ;-) Even our Myra-Support
Mailbox runs on an Amiga and with MME (Multimedia) we will do some small
Presentations in the near future.  And the Amiga does it all, since 1985...

I'm earning my money on the Amiga with translations.  I don't care if it's
for University lectures or for the Macintosh, as long as I can do them on
my Amiga in my home or office.  Only when I translate for the ATO, the
Amiga Translators' Organzation, the prizes get a lot lower...  ;-) We at
ATO will do our part to keep the Amiga-future user-friendly by translating
pOS as we do with Amiga-software for some time now.

So the Amiga is there - Just Use It!

TITLE

  Citadel 68K Freeware BBS Program

VERSION

  7A01

AUTHOR

  Tony Preston, apreston@k2nesoft.com

DESCRIPTION

Overview:

Citadel is a multi-platform BBS program.  There is support for the IBM,
Atari, and Amiga platforms.  This announcement concerns the Amiga version
of Citadel, Citadel 68K.  It is a room based BBS program with many features
not found in even the best commercial bbs programs.  It is 100% free and
sources are available.

A Room based BBS has rooms instead of message conferences.  The users carry
on conversations in the room.  A room is very much like a thread in other
BBS programs, it has a subject and messages related to the subject.

Citadel allows the many options.  The Sysop can configure what privileges a
user has, what characteristics a room has, and even what text will be used
for most messages.  It is flexible and since it is multi-platform, it is
networking compatible with the other Citadel platforms.

If your planing of starting a BBS, Citadel is the perfect way!  It can be
setup with virtually no cost!

NEW FEATURES

This version has several bug fixes, see the update file in the archive.  
There are some new utilities to make it easier to do long distance
networking via internet email using Danny Wong's AirMail utility.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

A Citadel 68K has been configured and ran from a system as small as a 512K
A500 with 2 floppies.  Obviously, this limits what optional features that
are available.  The recommended configuration is 2 MB memory or more plus
20 MB HD space.  Citadel requires 8192 of stack space.

The Citadel BBS package has many optional features.  These are packaged as
separate archives.  You many want to get all these packages.

    Cit_Arc_7A01.lha       External archiver support
    Cit_Util_7A01.lha      Utilities for offline maint.
    it_exec_7A01.lha     **Citadel BBS and Configuration program
    cit_src_7A01.lha       Complete Citadel and Utilties Source
    cit_src_7A01.lha     **Documentation
    Cit_XPR_7A01.lha       External up/download protocol support files
    in addition you might want to grab the file:
    devhandl.lha           Door device handler

       ** required files to startup a bbs
    One last requirement...  time...:)

AVAILABILITY

Available from any Aminet site such as:

 ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/comm/bbs/*7A01.lha

The latest version can always be downloaded from:

Citadel archives.  There will be a small charge for postage and handling.

PRICE

FREE, NADA, ZIP, NOTHING...

DISTRIBUTABILITY

Citadel is released as a copyrighted FREEWARE program.  Source and
executable are available at no charge.  No charge may be made to distribute
Citadel and no system may copyright any part of Citadel.  A nominal charge
for disk duplication may be made so long as only the duplication costs are

Amicrawler.com today announced the release of Amiga Browser Watch, a web
page dedicated to tracking the relative market share of Amiga specific web
browsers.  This web page shows a daily summary of the percentage of users
who visit the amicrawler.com site every day, cumulatively.  Users visiting
amicrawler.com can only be counted once each day.

In order to qualify to be listed on the Amiga Browser Watch, each browser
must be a publically available browser, and must be discernable as being
operated by an Amiga computer.  Browsers running on emulators cannot be
included in this analysis.

Future updates to the Amiga Browser Watch will include information such as
operating system versions and weekly or monthly rankings.  Also planned is
the ability to notify visiting Amiga users if a new version of their

             NR3 4BJ
             ENGLAND

DESCRIPTION

An editor for use with the Formula One Grand Prix or World Circuit game
(published by MicroProse Software).  It is very easy to use, with a
standard 2.0 look graphical user interface (even on KS 1.x!) and on-line
help should you need it.

Allows you to alter most of the in-game setup, including computer car
performance, car/helmet/pitcrew colours, car fragility and many other
things (and I MEAN many!).  Sound samples can also be replaced, cockpit
graphics changed, and lap records and setups printed.

Changes can be saved directly to a copy of the game which is running in
memory, or to the main file used by the game for a more permanent change.

Also incorporated in the main program are a number of memory patches,
including Toni Wilen's GPPatch and Grant Reeve's PatchF1GP.

F1GP-Ed breathes new life into an ageing, but excellent game.  1994, 1995,
1996 and 1997 sample datafiles supplied for those who don't want to mess
about.

The program itself is auto-enhancing, which means that it will run on a
basic A500 with KS 1.2, but will make use of KS 2.x or KS 3.x specific
routines on suitable machines to make itself even better.

Supported languages:

English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Danish, Swedish, Finnish,
Norwegian and Czech.

NEW FEATURES

o The "in-game" palette can now be altered
o GPPatch: font is now user selectable, HUD size can be preset, HUD can
  be enabled automatically, the "right-shift" car setup change can be
  disabled.  Reduced chip ram usage, plus the required chip ram is now
  allocated dynamically (only if you actually install GPPatch).  Display
  position is no longer hardcoded - uses same position as F1GP is using
o Added Hall of Fame options to the Statistics window to configure the
  HoF lap record output
o Added option to allow the "Abandon Qualifying" requestor to be skipped
o The position of the game display can now be preset
o Cockpit designs can now be viewed directly from within F1GP-Ed
o The backdrop (.bkg) files used by F1GP's menus can now be replaced
  with other images
o Improved font sensitivity calculations for proportional fonts - should
  result in more compact windows (tested with over 50 different fonts)
o Saving cockpit designs to memory now works properly
o Fixed bug in Nigel Rowe's McLaren-D cockpit (gear indicator no longer
  blanks out)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

Formula One Grand Prix or World Circuit game by Geoff Crammond, published
commercially originally by MicroProse Software.  The game has now been
re-released by Guildhall Leisure on the Acid label.

Approximately 1.5Mb of free ram needed to load the game and the editor to
be able to use the memory patches.  But, the editor itself and most of the
features will work on machines with less memory.

publish the Amiga version of MYST !

Myst is a phenomenon - the bestselling CD-ROM game ever, and the
bestselling game of 1996 both on PC and Mac.  But, more importantly, it is
a marvelous game.

This message is just an announcement for Myst.  We will have the official
press release with more information in a couple of days.

Format: CD-ROM only

Hardware: Amiga with a video board (16 million colors) or AGA (256 colors)

@toc NEWS

17th March 1997

For Immediate Public Release:

Quasar Distribution, publishers of PC-Task, DirWork, Quarterback and
Quarterback Tools Deluxe, have terminated our distribution agreement with
France Festival Distribution due to piracy of PC-Task 4.

Due to Serge Hammouche (the owner of France Festival Distribution)
illegally selling pirated copies of PC-Task updates and full packages, they
are no longer authorised to sell any versions of any of our products.

It is disappointing to us to see this sort of behaviour occurring at this
vital time for the Amiga computer.

New distribution details will be available soon on our web site at
http://www.ozemail.com.au/~pctask

French PC-Task users are able to upgrade directly from us for US$47
including delivery.  Further details are available on our web site.

All PC-Task versions are sold with printed manuals, with a properly printed
PC-Task label.  If you suspect your version is a pirate copy, please email
us at pctask@ozemail.com.au

  Iain Templeton - Utility functions

  Note: It's no mistake that the addresses of the other persons are
  missing. It just that I want to protect them from beeing swamped
  by EMail :)

DESCRIPTION

AROS is an effort to re-write the AmigaOS V3.1 (40.70 or later) in ANSI C
(mostly).  The goal is to have the power of the AmigaOS without beeing
limited by the hardware.  We try hard to maintain source compatibility
which means that, if you want some Amiga application on your mainframe, all
you have to do is to get its source and compile it again.

 Right now, we have implemented these features:
 - Almost the complete exec. Only interrupts and some more
   esoteric functions are missing
 - Much of DOS
 - A shell to run DOS commands
 - A set of working DOS commands: Dir, List, Echo, Cd, ...
 - A bit of graphics.-, intuition.- and utility.library
 - Enough of Intuition to open a window, receive IntuiMessages
   and process them.
 - console.device with RawKeyConvert()
 - A demo which can be started from the shell, which opens a
   window in which you can draw with the mouse, press keys and
   click on gadgets.

 If you want to participate, then you can choose between these two:

 a) The Preferred Way: Get your hands on CVS and follow the
    instructions in the README.CVS in the AROSdev-archive.

 b) The Usual Way: Get the latest source, make your modifications
    and send me patches via email. Since this takes some time,
    make sure you allocate your work with the jobserver.

 If you write something for us, make sure to check if that job
 is not already done by someone else. To achieve this, use the
 jobserver. You can reach it by writing an EMail to

aros@wi-pc44.fh-konstanz.de

 with the Subject "jobserv" (without the ""). It reads the
 contents of the mail and executes it. For help simply use
 the command "help" on a single line.

CHANGES

- console.device to allow to convert IntuiMessages into text
- Bool-Gadgets
- Some bug fixes
- First steps with Resource Tracking and Purify

FUTURE

- More docs :-P
- More functions
- Resource Tracking for all things our nice OS has to offer
- The fastes AmigaOS ever on an DEC-Alpha-Workstation with
  200MHz ;)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

Right now, you need a PC running Linux to view the demos or to compile the
source.  No effort has been made to make sure that anything would work on
an Amiga but you're welcome if you're a Amiga freak with plenty of time :)

  Amiga-CLISP binary and source

VERSION

  based on CLISP-1995-05-30 source

AUTHORS

  Bruno Haible and Michael Stoll.
  Amiga-port by Joerg Hoehle <Joerg.Hoehle@gmd.de>

DESCRIPTION

CLISP is an implementation of Common Lisp.  Common Lisp is a convential
programming language and an AI language.  It is interactive.  It has
automatic garbage collection and can protect resources (e.g.  free them
even in case a computation is aborted with an error).  Common Lisp programs
are easy to test (interactive), easy to maintain (depending on programming
style) and portable (there is a standard for the language and the library
functions).

CLISP needs just 2 MB of memory (it will allocate more for large
applications) and implements 99% of the CLtL1 standard, as well as some
extensions and a large part of the CLtL2 standard.  CLISP contains an
interpreter and a compiler, CLOS, a small ARexx interface and a foreign
function interface with which to call any function from almost any shared
library.  CLISP is safe to use, for any integer, array, string etc.
manipulation is checked: your application won't write past a string,
overflow an integer or dereference a NULL pointer, generating Enforcer
hits.

NEW FEATURES

Amiga foreign function interface (AFFI)
CLtL2 logical pathnames
CLtL2 LOOP macro
SCREEN package for (K)CON: cursor control
-wide version that works with VMM
optimized -00 version for 68000 processors

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

Since this release, Amiga-CLISP requires at least OS 2.04.

AVAILABILITY

@toc NEWS

AmigaSoc is pleased to announce what ought to be the UK's first Amiga-only
TV programme due to start on BSkyB's "Computer Channel" next week (the week
starting Monday 17th March) at 6:45 - 7pm, Mon-Thurs, and repeated at the
weekend.  The Computer Channel can be found on Channel 58 on the Sky
Transponder (after Granada Good Life).  It's called "Chips With Everything"
(well we didn't pick the name!)

The show will be feature a panel of Amiga people including Dan Winfield
(founder of AmiLon -the Amiga London User Group, erstwhile web/perl
columnist for Amiga Computing magazine, Marketing Director for IMMStudios,
and AmigaSoc member).  Alongside him will be Nick Veitch of Amiga Format -
one of the most popular Amiga mags in the world (as if you didn't know!),
and Sean Flowers from respected Amiga dealer, Direct Software.

Some of the things to be touched upon in the first show will be exactly WHY
the Amiga has got on just fine without Commodore, WHY the Amiga is such a
good tool for connecting to the Internet, and of course multitudinous plugs
for Direct Software!

Please bear in mind that if there is a good response to the first few
shows, then it will definitely become a regular feature.  It's up to you!

You can get to the home page for "The Computer Channel" from
http://www.computerchannel.co.uk, although they don't appear to have much

AUTHOR

  Kenneth "Kenny" Nilsen

  EMail: kenny@bgnett.no
  WWW:   http://www.bgnett.no/~kenny/

DESCRIPTION

This is a library that will make serial network handling easy.  It contains
a set of functions that will do most of the "dirty" work for you.  All you
need to do is to allocate a net and then read and write to/from that net. 
Net here is a device, for example serial.device or a compatible device
(such as duart.device).

You can with help from this library connect games and programs via
nullmodem cable or modem in a relative comfortable way.

The library have integrated resource tracking.  The resource tracking allow
you to free memory, ports, device that is used by a program that crashes or
terminates without a cleanup.  The resource tracking also prevents that you
free a invalid pointer to a net.

Archive includes developer information and a demo terminal program that
uses the dignet.library.

Some of the important features of this library:

- resource tracking (from v2.1).
- should be painless to use, straight forward.
- string/text/binary support (all-in-one)
- possibility for more advanced uses (eg. with Wait())
- fully re-entrant (more connections open at the same time)
- comes with a default setting that works for most needs
- easy to change default parameters
- fast routines (written in assembler).
- safe to call functions even with faulty arguments
  (such as read/write null byte).

@toc NEWS

March 13th, 1997 - Amicrawler.Com announced today the results of a week
long study concerning web browser market share for Amiga computers.
Topping the list was IBrowse, from Omnipresence international, with 68.5%
market share.  AWeb ranked a distant second with a 16.1% share, followed by
AmigaVoyager with a 14.6% share.  Older browsers such as AmigaMosaic scored
.4%, and the non-graphical ALynx scored .3%.  Other non-released Amiga
browsers scored below .01%.

The single most popular release was IBrowse v1.02 with a total count of
7,850 visitors, followed by AmigaVoyager v2.10 (2,557 visitors), IBrowse
v1.02demo (2,433 visitors), Amiga-AWeb v2.1 (1,967 visitors), and three
more versions of IBrowse scoring over 1,000 visitors.  A total sample of
23,566 visitors were included in this study.

A similar study performed by Browserwatch shows IBrowse with a 95.4% market
share, Amiga-AWeb with a 3% share, and AmigaVoyager with a 1% share, among
graphical Amiga web browsers.  This study used a smaller sample of only 885
visitors over many weeks.

DESCRIPTION

`phonebill' is, simply said, a log file analyzer.  What it basically does
is scan log file(s) generated by a terminal program or a mailer, extract
all information about calls you have made by using your modem, and store
this in its own (short) format.  After extracting the calls `phonebill' can
generate various reports in which you can find information on duration and
costs of the calls.

Here is a small list of the main features:

 * Very flexible user-configurable rates, supporting exceptions for
   certain days and dates.

 * User-configurable log scanners: `phonebill' by default supports
   various log files, but for any log file that is not supported the
   user is able to create a scanner. The following is a list of log
   files that are already supported:
     * AmiTel
     * AutoPilot
     * CyberPager
     * DreamTerm
     * GMS
     * Gotcha!
     * GPFax
     * ISDN Master Telephone log
     * ISDN Wilhelmtel
     * JamMail
     * JrComm
     * MagiCall
     * MagicCX
     * MailKick
     * Miami
     * MicroDot
     * Multifax (both v2.0 and Multifax professional)
     * NComm
     * Off-line Amiga
     * Online-o-Meter
     * OnlineMeter
     * Plink
     * Prometheus
     * Term action log and Term call log
     * Terminus
     * TheAnswer
     * TKR-BTX
     * Trapdoor
     * Trapfax
     * UUCP TimeLog
     * UUCP uucico
     * XenoLink
     * ZeeTerm
     * ZerMailer
     * ZMailer
     * Zodiac's Point

 * Log files can be automatically truncated if their size exceeds the
   maximum size.

 * Generates miscellaneous reports: statistics, total costs, predicted
   costs ...

 * Context-sensitive online help.

 * Supports new 3.0 features (new look menus, ...).

 * Nice `Amiga User Interface Style Guide' conformant user interface.

 * Supports `traplist.library'.

NEW FEATURES

The following is an incomplete list of the most important changes:

 * Added billing per second.

 * Besides the built-in log file truncation, you can now also run a
   (shell) command when a log file exceeds its size. For example,
   setting the command to `delete "%f"' deletes the log file.

 * Several rates have been updated. In particular, swedish rates
   now use billing per second.

 * Several bug fixes.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

Workbench 2.04 or higher.

AVAILABILITY

Phonebill is available on Aminet, e.g.:
 * ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/comm/misc/pbill35.lha (303293)

@toc NEWS

UNIX, Amiga, VMS and AS/400 Top List of Platforms Targeted for New CD
Library System
11:45 a.m. Feb 26, 1997 EST 

IRVINE, Calif., Feb.  26 /PRNewswire/ -- Elms Systems Corporation(TM),
innovator of digital library solutions for affordable CD sharing and
publishing, has launched its "Solutions Provider" and Independent Software
Vendor (ISV) programs.  Elms is actively seeking ISVs to provide
complementary software for its Digital Versatile Library(TM) (DVL(TM)).
The "Solutions Provider" program is aimed at VARs and integrators with
specialized expertise either in both vertical applications and
non-Microsoft operating systems.  The DVL is a first of its kind CD library
hardware product which features storage of up to 100 CDs online in five
easy-to-use bar-coded magazines. 

Charter participants already taking advantage of the market potential for
Elms' DVL span a range of platforms including UNIX, Novell, and Amiga and
include Luminex, Riverside, Calif.; Celerity, Knoxville, Tenn.; Asimware,
Ontario, Canada; and Optisys, Glendale, Ariz. 

The new programs offer discounts on Elms products, specialized technical
support including programmer guides, and a range of marketing benefits to
software developers who partner with Elms to provide integrated
hardware/software CD library products. 

According to Robert Smith, Elms vice president of marketing, the company is
actively seeking developers of software for non-Windows environments.
"Elms' internal charter is to focus on providing complete solutions for the
Microsoft-based PC market," said Smith.  "To offer our CD library
capabilities to non-Windows users, we're looking to partner with the best
and brightest software and solution providers for other platforms,
including HP, Sun, AS/400, VMS and other environments."

Elms recognizes that today's technical environment is very complex and that
in order to maintain its technology leadership it needs partners with the
expertise to solve specific customer problems.  "Each OS has a constituent
user community that embraces that OS for a reason.  We need partners that
understand those subtleties and can be responsive to the needs of
customers," Smith concluded. 

Industry-Leading Feature Set 

Elms' DVL CD library is differentiated by unprecedented low price and a
host of easy to use features.  The breakthrough base price for the flagship
product is $5,495. 

The DVL delivers a number of industry firsts, including:

-- flexible drive configuration with 1 to 4 drives (one can be CD-R) 

-- user replaceable drives for easy drive replacements in the field
   technologies and faster drives

-- front access to drives and magazines for easy use in an office
   environment

-- battery backup system that monitors magazine changes in the DVL when the
   power is off, making it easier to bring the DVL back on-line

"The magazines were designed with the user in mind," said Smith.  The 20 CD
magazine measures only 6.5" by 2.5" by 6.75" and is the most compact in the
industry.  The magazine features 20 numbered trays that alternate in color
to make loading and unloading a specific tray easy.  The small magazines
help contribute to the DVL's small size which is not much bigger than a
standard PC tower. 

The DVL can be ordered with a 4GB AV hard disk drive to provide additional
storage for specific software needs.  The hard disk drive is a field
installable option that can be purchased separately.  CD drives can also be
added to the DVL at any time.  "We want the VAR and the user to have
flexibility," Smith pointed out.  "With our Faster-Now feature the user can
add drives at any time or upgrade them.  We mounted the drives on rails, so
you slide them in, connect the cables and snap the cover on to complete an
upgrade."

The DVL features a SCSI-II interface and uses standard SCSI-II move media
commands to make it easy for ISVs to write software for the DVL.  "The ISVs
that have worked with us to develop software for the DVL have been able to
write drivers for the DVL very quickly," says Smith. 

The DVL is offered in a variety of configurations, all of which feature
five magazines.  These range from the entry-level single-drive system for
$5,495 (MSRP), to the top-of-the-line four-drive system with a 4GB AV hard
disk drive for $8,795 (MSRP).  The company's products are being offered by
Bell Microproducts, San Jose, Calif.  and Globelle, San Diego, Calif. 

Elms System Corporation is a leader in digital library solutions for
affordable CD sharing and publishing.  The company was founded in 1995 and
is headquartered in Irvine, Calif.  Elms develops a line of CD software
called Panorama(TM) and a CD library, the DVL, aimed at the business and
network user.  The company can be found on the World Wide Web at
http://www.elms.com.

Amiga Enforcer V37.70
New Version Supports 060, Source Code Available

Enforcer V37, by Michael Sinz, published by Intangible Assets
Manufacturing, is an advanced debugging tool for Amiga computer systems
equipped with a 68020/68851, 68030, 68040, or 68060 CPU.  It uses the MMU
to help detect stray pointers and access to invalid memory.  The Enforcer
archive includes tools to help identify the exact location of bugs,
including the line of source code in most C or Assembly code, as well as
some other languages.  Also includes a large on-line manual and some
examples as to how errors can be caught. 

The original Enforcer was written by Bryce Nesbitt, copyright
Commodore-Amiga.  It was instrumental in the development of AmigaOS 2.04
and to the improvement of the quality of software on the Amiga.  Enforcer
V37 is a completely new set of code designed to provide even more debugging
capabilities across more hardware configurations and with more options. 

Changes from the V37.62 release of Enforcer include:

* Added 68060 CPU support the first public release that provides support
for the 68060.  See documentation for details.

* New MMU dump tool

* A large amount of new documentation including how and why certain things
were built the way they were.  A "must read" for Amiga system hackers and
CPU hardware vendors.  Includes some source code for some of the patches
that were needed to make the 68040.library support as much Amiga software
as possible.  (And, thus, 68060.library - hopefully)

* A special offer: Source code to all the Enforcer tools!  Enforcer has
always been available for use by Amiga developers for free.  The wide
spread use of Enforcer has been one of the reasons Amiga software is as
good as it is.  With this release of Enforcer, the author makes a special
offer to people who wish to get the source code.  This offer is detailed at
http://www.iam.com/amiga/enforcer.html and in the Enforcer documentation. 

Support the Enforcer: Order today.
Even if you don't need the source code to Enforcer, if you use Enforcer,
please consider purchasing the source code to support the author and
continued work on Enforcer.  Enforcer has been developed over many years,
worked on by two of the most famous and capable of the former
Commodore-Amiga Software Engineers.  If you're an Amiga developer, Enforcer
is worth a lot to you and the quality of your software, so please support
us.

G A M E S   M A S T E R   S Y S T E M
V0.5B NOW ON AMINET


The new version of the Games Master System (games.library) is now on
Aminet!  The filename is:

  pub/aminet/dev/misc/gms_dev.lha

This beta is being released in the hope that if you download it, you send
us some feedback.  Otherwise it will not be worth releasing future betas,
and they will become private access only.  As the project nears V1.0 it
becomes even more important that any mistakes or flaws are dealt with very
quickly, and that new ideas keep coming in.

CURRENT FEATURES OF THE GAMES MASTER SYSTEM

This is just a summary of the major features that have so far been
implemented.  Not all new features and changes have been documented here. 
For the complete low-down on all features of GMS check the developer
information files.

  NEW!
* Support for Multiple BOB image structures (MBOB's) for blitting many
  images from one structure.  Makes allowances for structure mutations (for
  storing extra program data with image entries).

  NEW!
* CPU assisted drawing with blitter functions, drawing speed is no longer
  limited to blitter throughput.  Added optional mask generation for BOBs
  on intitialisation.

  NEW!
* Internal resource tracking on memory allocations.  GMS will free
  resources that you have not deallocated when your program closes the
  library.  Warnings are given to help you fix any problems.

  NEW!
* Structure and object pre-processing, for compiling structures before
  run-time.  This makes GMS the first system to support up to 100% user
  editing of game data.

* Fast blitter functions for drawing BOB's, copying for screen buffers, 3
  different screen clears, auto background saving and clearing for BOB's. 
  Also includes Pixel and Line drawing functions, and support for list's
  for very fast mass-drawing operations.

* Full sprite support, and that is: All available sprite dimensions, colour
  table offsets, 16 colour sprites, width-doubled sprites, full animation
  support, lo-res, hi-res, and superhi-res support.

* Sound support includes: Support for sound priorities, intelligent dynamic
  channel play-back, channel modulation for special effects, IFF support.

* Proportional colour fading, functions are: PaletteMorph, ColourMorph,
  PaletteToColour and ColourToPalette.  Support for setting speed and
  colour ranges.

* Full support for raster/copperlists, with effects such as: Colourlists,
  Mirror, Flood, Screen and Sprite Splitting, and Palette changes.

* Allows you to support all different kinds of input devices (joysticks,
  joypads, mouse etc) through just one simple function call.  This enables
  you to support devices that don't even exist yet.

* Stable memory allocation and a freemem routine that will not crash your
  machine if you have written over your memory boundaries.

* Smart Saving and Loading of files, with automatic packing and depacking.
  Packer support covers files crunched with XPK (external), PowerPacker
  (internal), and RNC methods 1&2 (internal).

* 320k of assembler, E and C sources, demonstrating all uses of the
  library.

* All games can multi-task with no significant drop in speed or
  performance.

FIND IT FAST ON THE INTERNET WITH "NETRESEARCH"
O'Reilly Releases Guide to Internet Power Searching

SEBASTOPOL, CA--Finding things on the Internet is an everyday challenge for
the millions who have come to depend on the Net's vast information
resources.  Navigating through the Net's morass of data can make the user
feel like Goldilocks, longing for information that's not too much or too
little, but "just right." O'Reilly & Associates' new book "NetResearch"
helps Internet users quickly find exactly what they're looking for in the
constantly changing online world.

Information and locations on the Net change at a dizzying pace, but
"NetResearch" is built to last.  It shares the strategies and techniques of
master Internet searchers--methods that readers can use successfully
whether they're looking for information on mutual funds, demographics,
plane schedules, or beer.  Those who use the power searching techniques
described in "NetResearch" will learn how to think like the masters when
they go looking for something on the Internet.  The book also covers
America Online, CompuServe, Microsoft Network, and Prodigy, and includes
quizzes to help readers practice research skills.

In "NetResearch," author Dan Barrett offers these Internet Searcher's Rules
for the Road:

1.  Carefully choose a starting place.  Like the old saying says, sometimes
"you can't get there from here." Different starting points may lead to
different results.

2.  Don't assume failure too quickly.  When a search program responds
"nothing found," don't give up.  Try a few variations on your search.  If
these don't produce results either, you can still try other starting
places, programs, and search techniques.

3.  Don't assume success too quickly.  Even when you locate what you need,
there might be another source of information available that is better.
Don't be too loyal to one Web site or one search technique.  Keep an open
mind.  Experiment.

4.  Think about your route.  Even if you reached your goal, there might
have been a faster way to get there.  Pay attention when a search strategy
provides quick results: the same strategy might be usable in other
situations.

5.  Know your tools.  Read the manual.  Use the online help.  Try out all
the commands and options.  Make sure your search software is the latest
version, or at least a recent one.

6.  Intuition is your best search tool.  The Internet changes rapidly, and
so does the software we use to access it.  Knowledge, on the other hand,
accumulates.  As you learn from experience, you'll get progressively better
at tackling new situations.

The Net is a big, disorganized, inconsistent place.  As anyone who has ever
gotten 17,000 responses to a search engine query knows, constructing a
focused search saves time and aggravation.  With the help of "NetResearch,"
readers will learn effective search techniques to locate just the
information they want, when they need it.

Immediate press release: Budapest, 10 March, 1997

Arthur Wilkins Software - based in Budapest, Hungary - announces exciting
new products for the Amiga.  

We are committed to produce affordable, but high quality software for the
professional user especially those involved in the video industry.
AW-AfterAlias is an unbelievable tool for professional cartoon studios.
Now it is possible to create perfect quality cartoons using low-cost Amiga
computers and cheap software.  

AfterAlias as its name suggests applies perfect anti-aliasing (no blur!) to
a jaggied computer generated image.

AW-DeFlicker removes the interlace flickering from any image without any
visible blur - it is a must have for every video professional. 

AW-Freeze is also a very valuable operator for video users for freezing a
still frame by eliminating motion between fields. 

All the above video tools come as an ADPro operator for easy integration. 
Freely distributable demo versions are downloadable from the Arthur Wilkins
Software web.

A complete package of visual effects for ADPro called 'AWFX1' is to be
released soon with 8 superb plug-in modules (including AfterAlias,
DeFlicker and Freeze).  AWSW plans to publish 3rd party video effect
modules for Macrosystem GmbH's MovieShop non-linear video editing software,
filters for Adobe PhotoShop and more.  BIGDISK breaks the 4GB limit of
AmigaDOS, enables video users to handle large SCSI disks, such as 9GB hard
disks manufactured by Micropolis and Seagate.  Now it is possible to create
partitions above 4GB and use them as an AmigaDOS system disk, or as a
dedicated MovieShop video or audio partition with both Vlab-Motion and
DraCo-Motion.  Further information can be obtained from our web-site.  Make
sure to subscribe the AWSW newsletter (on our site) if you don't want to
miss important information from us in the future.

@toc NEWS

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Date:    13-March-1997
Contact: Cindy Sassenrath cindy@sassenrath.com

-----

Carl Sassenrath Publishes the REBOL Reference Manual, Part 1


The first part of the REBOL(tm) Reference Manual, entitled "REBOL Values:
The Building Blocks" is now available on-line at http://www.sassenrath.com.

This manual, written for both novice users and programming experts alike,
serves as an introduction to the first and most important concept of the
language.  It also includes seven example scripts written in REBOL that
clarify the use of the language.

"With just a glance at the examples it quickly becomes apparent why REBOL
is a simple, yet powerful alternative to the future operation of our
computer systems and the distribution of computer content on the internet",
comments Sassenrath.

He goes on to admit: "I realize that the REBOL language is not for
everyone, but there are a lot of us who believe that personal computers
have turned into a bad dream, with endless layers of bloated software being
forced down our throats by huge stockmarket-driven bureaucracies."

An "educational pre-release" of the REBOL language is expected to be out
this month and is intended for people who want to try a few examples of
their own, using what they have learned from the manual.  Incremental
releases of the language will be made over the next few months, with a 1.0
version slated for June 1997.

Subsequent parts of the manual will be published to the Internet as they
become available.

The development of the REBOL language is being supported by contributions
and will be freely available for personal non-commercial use on a range of
computer systems.  Corporate licenses and custom versions will be available
for a fee.

REBOL is a trademark of Carl Sassenrath.

  VWM - Virtual Window Manager

VERSION

  1.2 (15-Mar-97) (first public release)

AUTHOR

  Bahman Moallem

  E-Mail:         bamo@ctools.pp.se
  World Wide Web: http://www.ctools.pp.se/

DESCRIPTION

VWM, the virtual screen aware window manager, is a small, fast, and system
friendly virtual screen aware program that gives you 100% control over
windows' positions.

VWM features 2 ways of defining the new location for the target window,
setting an absolute or relative position (Coordinate Positioning) or using
a preset positioning technique usually related to the mouse position
(Preset Positioning Techniques).

VWM can force your programs to:

- open their windows in absolute positions related to the start point (0x0)
  of the active screen.

- open their windows in absolute positions but related to the point (0x0)
  of the "active part" of the screen (for virtual screens).

- center their windows under the mouse pointer (FollowMouse).

- locate their windows under the mouse pointer but respect the view, that
  is to locate the windows far enough away from the closest edges of the
  visible screen but still under the mouse pointer (RespectView).

FollowView(TM), known as RespectView in VWM, is Copyright (c) 1993-1997
Bahman Moallem and was first introduced in MagicWords, the multilingual
word translator for the Amiga back in 1993.

- open their windows in the center of the visible part of the screen
  (CenterWindow).

- open their windows in the corner of the visible part of the screens which
  is farthest away from the mouse pointer position (UseCorners).

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

AmigaOS 2.04 or better.

AVAILABILITY

VWM version 1.2 (app. 32 KB) is available on Aminet, e.g.

program useful.  The aim is to extract from the huge Aminet INDEX file, the
information you need as quickly as possible, in a clean way.

I know there are many other progs doing 'same' thing but none of them has a
decent interface, none of them allows you to save your prefs, and many of
them don't work very long because the INDEX format changes from time to
time.

Here's the solution, no need to type in boring CLI commands, simply use the
friendly MUI interface and enjoy the work ...

GLOBAL FEATURES

-  MUI interface with help bubbles, keyboard support, ...

-  Localized interface.

-  Preferences loading, editing, saving with special preferences for each
   output format.

-  Generation window with ability to pause, continue, abort the generation.
   If you stop the generation, the files already generated remains valid.

-  Allows to specify a minimum AND maximum age in weeks for output files.

-  Allows to customise the position of every INDEX field so the program
   can read ANY format of INDEX file (even old and future ones) !

-  Allows to specify which directories and subdirectories to extract using
   listviews in the prefs window.

-  Uses TREE file to get description of directories for output files
   and preference window.

-  Can generate a RECENT type file in the following formats :
   Text, AmigaGuide, HTML and Database !

-  Can add a search button in AmigaGuide files (needs the SearchGuide tool
   by Gérard Cornu).

-  Can split the RECENT file (one file for each directory selected) with
   a smart file extension handling. With this feature, even computers with
   low memory can easily use the huge INDEX file :->

-  Can remove any field form the INDEX (except the file field of course).
   For example, the complete AmigaGuide version of an INDEX takes less
   space than the original INDEX if you remove the dir field !

-  NO buffer is used for the RECENT file generation (sequential access)
   and the job is done in ONE pass.

-  When all the selected dirs are scanned, stops reading the INDEX immedia-
   tely :-)

-  Displays current written file and the current read directory during the
   RECENT file generation.

-  Displays an accurate progression gauge and a funny busy bar.

-  It's in EMAILWARE !

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

- MUI 3.3 or better (Magic User Interface)

- MCC_Busy class (dev/mui/MCC_Busy_2.3.lha) or with MUI archive.

- An Amiga with the KickStart 2.04 or better

- The WIDE version of the Aminet INDEX :

    *   The wide version is in the Aminet /info/index/ directory !
    *   The short version is in the Aminet root directory...
    *   You may use an INDEX from an Aminet CD-ROM (not sure)

- The corresponding Aminet TREE file :

    *   You should find it in the Aminet root directory
    *   A recent version is present in the archive
    *   This file describes the Aminet directory structure

TITLE

fMSX Amiga 1.3

AUTHOR

Hans Guijt (h.guijt@inter.nl.net)

DESCRIPTION

fMSX Amiga emulates an MSX computer on an Amiga. Features include:

- Full emulation of the MSX1 system.
- Partial emulation of the MSX2 system (to be expanded in the future).
- Support for reading/writing MSX disks and disk images.
- Support for the PSG and SCC sound chips.
- Support for MSX memory sizes of up to 4Mb.

'MSX' is an 8-bit computer system with surprisingly good graphics and sound
capabilities, and a relatively slow CPU.  This means that although it can
be emulated well, the results still look good.  Some MSX games are on par
with Amiga games when it comes to graphics and playability!  Several MSX
pictures have been uploaded to aminet (pix/illu/msx_pictures.lha).

Software is not included with the package, but many packages (mostly games)
can be found on FTP sites:

ftp.saitama-u.ac.jp/pub/msx/
altair.komkon.com/pub/MSX/
ftp.funet.fi/pub/msx/
riaph.irkutsk.su/pub/

Hundreds of games are available from these sites, and some form a worthy
addition to the Amiga software collection.

Of course fMSX Amiga is fully multitasking, runs in an intuition screen,
and has a font-sensitive user interface.

NEW FEATURES

New features in this version include extensive support for virtual tape
(which allows the user to save his position in games such as Metal Gear or
Payload - or do anything else a real MSX can do with tape if you'd want to
;-) ), and many bugfixes:

- Sprites look better in screen 5.
- Changing diskimages on the fly was broken.
- fMSX won't hang anymore while changing the screen.

Other new features include the ability to create diskimages, sprites in
screen 7, and some minor improvements to the GUI.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

Required are:

- AmigaOS 2.0
- 68020 processor
- 350 kilobytes chip ram
- 1000 kilobytes other ram

Recommended:

- AmigaOS 3.0
- 68030 processor, at least 25MHz
- Those 1000 kilobytes of 'other' ram had better be fast ram!

Note that fMSX Amiga does *not* require the AGA chipset.  In fact it runs
on any chipset upto and including graphics cards!

AVAILABILITY

fMSX Amiga 1.3 is available from any aminet site, such as:

ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/misc/emu/fmsx_1.3.lha

PRICE

It's free.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

fMSX Amiga 1.3 is publically supported freeware.  If you are interested in
the source, and you're not afraid of function pointers and huge amounts of
assembly mixed with C, you can request it from me.

If someone wants to do a special version (and I can think of several
possibilities, such as a version that uses the MMU for optimized Z80
emulation, or a version that has been optimized for the CyberGfx system),
contact me.

                           GERMANY

DESCRIPTION

ToolManager is a program which lets you start your tools in a very easy
way.  You can start programs by using keyboard shortcuts, by selecting an
entry from the Workbench's Tools menu or by clicking an icon either on the
Workbench or in special dock windows.  You can even drag icons from
Workbench drawers on those icons to supply files to the programs.
Additionally you can attach a sound to each of these actions.

All these things are controlled by ToolManager objects.  Each object has a
specific task and contains information how to accomplish this task.  F.ex.
programs are represented as Exec objects and contain information about the
program name and the stack size.

The configuration is handled by the ToolManager preferences editor.  It is
based on MUI 3.x and thus offers a font-sensitive GUI where you can open
multiple resizable object edit windows at once.  It also supports Drag &
Drop of objects.

The distribution consists of 5 archives:

Binaries  - Programs, english doc., Installer script     required
Developer - Developer information                        optional
Extras    - Additional programs                          optional
Locale    - Translated documentation and program texts   optional
Sources   - Complete source code                         optional

   - Dock Objects can now be completely borderless
   - New preferences file format, hopefully more flexible
   - Converter for the ToolManager 2.x format
   - Events are now checked while the configuration is read
   - Preferences is now a MUI application: resizable window,
     multiple open edit windows and Drag&Drop support
   - Changing an object name automatically updates all references
     to the object.

   Executive

VERSION

   2.10

AUTHOR

   Petri Nordlund (petrin@megabaud.fi)
   (http://www.megabaud.fi/~petrin/)

DESCRIPTION

Executive brings real multitasking to AmigaOS.  Executive is a UNIX-like
process scheduler for Amiga.  It also has plenty of other features
previously available only in larger operating systems.

Executive improves the responsiveness of your Amiga.  One CPU intensive
application no longer causes the whole system to crawl.  You can start many
CPU intensive applications and the system still feels as if it would be
totally idle.

The Executive package also includes many useful client programs that let
you control tasks and monitor what is going on in your system.

The core of Executive is a scheduler that recalculates task priorities
based on system load average and task's recent CPU usage.  The scheduler
will give high priority to interactive tasks and low priority to CPU
intensive tasks.

Lets say you are printing a document from a word processor.  You can't do
much else while the document is being printed.  This isn't multitasking.
With Executive you could also do some heavy rendering and C-compiling in
the background at the same time.  You could surf the web with your favorite
browser without even noticing all these programs running in the background.

Executive consists of a server and clients.  The server is run in the
background and it takes care of scheduling, CPU usage calculations and many
other things.  Some important features of the server:

  - precise (1/1000 seconds) CPU usage timing
  - six different scheduling algorithms
  - load averages
  - process identifiers
  - process group identifiers
  - accounting
  - focus - task with active window gets more CPU time
  - MultiUser support

The client programs are:

  Acct            Accounting daemon
  ALoad           Display load average or CPU usage
  ALoad3D         Display load averages in 3D
  Commander       General task manager
  Ctp             Extended ChangeTaskPri
  Dashboard       The mother of all meters
  Kill            Extended Break
  Lastcomm        List last commands executed
  Meter           Display system information
  Nice            Run programs with lower scheduling priority
  Ps              Process status displayer
  Pstree          Display child-parent relationships
  Renice          Renice a task
  Sa              Display accounting statistics
  Stat            Display some misc. information
  Timer           Time shell and Workbench programs
  Top             Display information about top CPU tasks
  Uptime          Display system uptime and load averages

Executive is fully compatible with all Amiga computers running AmigaOS
release 2.04 or newer.

Executive is the highest rated item of shareware CU Amiga magazine has ever
awarded at 98%.  Executive V2.00 got 97% from the same magazine, and it was
ranked as "the best shareware utility ever."

NEW FEATURES

- This version fixes two very important bugs

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

AmigaOS 2.04 or newer is required to run Executive.

AVAILABILITY

Any Aminet site, for example:

ftp://ftp.luth.se/pub/aminet/util/misc/Executive.lha

Executive has a WWW-page which has links to several Aminet
sites and also some nice screenshots. The URL of the page is:

PRICE

The freely redistributable version doesn't lack any crucial features so it
can be used without registering.  Registered users get process accounting,
ALoad3D and Meter clients and 5 additional scheduling algorithms.
Registration fee is $15 and it's also accepted in many other currencies.

DESCRIPTION

AmigaBase is an easy to use programmable database with a graphical user
interface.  Data can be stored in fields of type STRING, INTEGER, REAL,
DATE, TIME, BOOLEAN, CHOICE (one item out of many items) and MEMO
(multiline text).  Records are organized in a hierarchy, this allows an
easy implementation of 1:n relations, e.g.  for managing music titles on
different music cassettes, etc.

By programming AmigaBase, the user has the ability to create custom print
or import/export routines, or to recalculate some fields when changing the
value of a field.  This gives high power to AmigaBase.

NEW FEATURES since V2.3

There are only few changes in AmigaBase V2.4.   The main work is now
concentrated on finishing a new, relational, and MUI based database.

        o  New icon set.
        o  Some minor bug fixes.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

Harddisk and Workbench 2.1+ recommended.

* 11-3-1997 ClassX announces X-DVE 2.70

Our firm is continually updating X-DVE in order to make this leading
software the most productive, easy and powerful DTV animation/titling
environment on the market.  With this new free release, X-DVE has been
added of some some important features and new functionalities.  The update
from v2.50/2.60 for Italy, UK, Germany, USA will be freely available on
Aminet.

- 68060 support

Thanks to its modular desing, X-DVE keeps its cpu intesive code into
separate libraries which has been optimized for several processors.  With
X-DVE 2.70 we have introduced the 68060 version of these libraries to allow
power-users to get the best out of their expensive accelerator boards. 
With the imminent arrival of new PPC-based boards we'll be able to supply
PPC-optimized libraries in no time.

- Multipalette Anim5/7L object

X-DVE is based on graphical objects which can be enhanced, animated and
rendered with thousands of effects and combinations.  Objects can be single
frame (text, brush) or an animated sequence of frames (starfield,
multibrush or animbrush).  With X-DVE 2.70 the animbrush object has been
extended and now it supports doublebuffered multipalette animation formats
as ANIM5 and ANIM7 (long).  With this new feature, users no longer need to
convert their animations into IFF-ANBR format in order to use them as X-DVE
objects.  When adding an ANIMBRUSH object, X-DVE detects its format
automatically without the need of any user input.  For multiple palette
animations, the internal colour remapper will perform the needed frame by
frame adjustments automatically.

- 12 New slide effects

The library of effects has been extended again reaching 64 different
Slides.

o The "Sweep" effects (4 variants) where the object is divided into small
  rotating slices.

o The "Twist" effects (4 variants) where the object is twisted onto its own
  axis and smoothly becomes plain.

o The "RotCarpet" effects (4 variants) where the object is mapped onto a
  page coming from outside the screen.

All these effects are computed with 3D texure mapping calculations and give
astonishing visual results if rendered with the X-DVE light sourcing
feature.

- Fixes

The texture mapping routines have been tuned up to allow a better precision
and appearance of the effects (the 3D polygon clipper has been enhanced to
better handle very small polygons).

- Future

o We're working to make X-DVE support DraCo of MacroSystem (even if the
  guys at MacroSystem keep to ignore our requests of support, development
  tools and documentation).  The features of the DraCo version are
  unpredictable: it all depends on MacroSystem.

o The PPC version of the libraries is one of our main aims.

- Thanks

We would like to thank all our registered users for their support and for
believing in this product.  I hope they will appreciate our continuous
efforts and dedication to the best computer ever.

@toc NEWS

In a short letter which blamed a debt owed to them by VIScorp as the cause,
Almathera announced that it went out of business earlier this month.

Almathera was involved in set-top development for VIScorp, and has had
pending invoices with the former Amiga technology suitor for some time.

It is unclear from the letter if the company was sent into bankruptcy by
its creditors or if its directors simply decided to shut down the company.
Legal hassles with Paul Nolan, the original author of the program behind
Photogenics, cause Almathera to pull the product from its line shortly
before the announcement, and Nolan claims he had a lawsuit with very large
claims out against the company.

An industry source indicates that the Almathera product line, as well as
company principles Paul and Jolyon Ralph, have been picked up by Grandslam
Software.

@toc NEWS

Product News about the BLIZZARD 603e Power Board Accelerator for Amiga 1200
Oberursel, February 25, 1997:

phase 5 digital products is proud to announce the upcoming BLIZZARD 603e
Power Board, a PowerPC-based accelerators for Amiga 1200 and A1200-based
Tower Systems.  With this innovative and powerful new accelerator a new
dimension of performance is brought to the Amiga 1200, with performance
increases of multiple times beyond the performance of the fastest 68k based
accelerators available today, for a sensationally low price that is
perfectly targeted at the A1200 upgrade market.

Primarily being designed as an upgrade board for existing Amiga systems,
the BLIZZARD 603e Power Board incorporates phase 5's innovative
dual-processor technologie, where a fast PowerPC RISC processor is combined
with a 68k processor, in case of the BLIZZARD 603e Power Board a 68030 CPU.
Both CPUs dynamically share the memory and system busses, what is necessary
for a true multiprocessor behaviour.  While the original AmigaOS 3.x
continues to run on the 68030 CPU - as well as all existing applications
do, what provides 100% compatibility - the PowerPC 603e CPU is supported by
a comprehensive PPC Library developed by phase 5, which provides all
functionality to integrate the PowerPC into the Amiga multitasking
environment.  Software developers can easily optimze their programs step by
step by porting single tasks to PowerPC code, which then can run parallel
with 68k tasks.  Many important Amiga software vendors are preparing ported
or optimized versions of their software packages already, so it is expected
that a large quantity of software products supporting the PowerPC will be
available soon.

The BLIZZARD 603e Power Board will be availabe with the fast PowerPC603e
processor at a clock speed of 120 MHz; a socket is provided for the 68030
companion processor in a PGA housing.  It provides a fast memory expansion
option which uses standard PS/2 type SIMMs.  The memory is dynamically
shared by the two CPUs on the BLIZZARD 603e Power Board .  As an option, as
very inexpensive Fast SCSI-II controller will be available for the BLIZZARD
603e Power Board, which combines transfer rates of up to 10 MB/s with the
flexibility and expandability of the SCSI standard. 

With it's 120 MHz 603e processor the BLIZZARD 603e Power Board provides -
only on the PPC side - a raw performance of approximately 170 MIPS or
approximately 3.5 SPECint95 and 2.8 SPECfp95 (estimations based on
Motorola/IBM manufacturer specifications) - a blistering performance that
can compete with most of the fastest PC systems available today.  with this
performance the BLIZZARD 603e Power Board is ready for the most demanding
applications such as 3D rendering and high-speed 3D gameplaying, image
manipulation, animation, video applications, and many other demanding
applications that depend on fast CPU performance.

The BLIZZARD 603e Power Board will be delivered with a comprehensive
software package, which includes the PPC library as well as tools for
creative users, among them a Public Domain GNU C compiler for PowerPC
(including sourcecode) and many demo programs and utilities with
sourcecode; in addition to this software free developer support is
available via the phase 5 FTP site.  Last not least a PowerPC-optimized
version of CyberGraphX V3 with RISC-optimized CyberGL/3D and MPEG functions
and libraries is included (with a special GGX driver to support the AGA
chipset) - of course with comprehensive documentation.


The BLIZZARD 603e Power Board will be selling for a price that can be
called sensational, offering a superior price/performance relation.  The
suggested retail prices are as follows:

BLIZZARD 603e Power Board w/ 120 MHz 603e processor  
DM 699,- / GBP 279.00 / USD 399.00


Note: All prices are recommended retail prices.  English and german price
include local VAT, the recommended US price does not include local taxes. 
The prices are without the 68030 CPU which is necessary to operate the
BLIZZARD 603e Power Board.  68030 processors from existing processor boards
can be used on the BLIZZARD 603e Power Board by pluging these into the
provided socket.  If you don't own a 68030 CPU already, ask you local
dealer for an attractive bundle offer.

Registered owners of a Blizzard 68030 board will - within the PowerUp
upgrade program - receive special, attractive upgrade offers by mail during
March 97.  The handling of these upgrades will be done via local appointed
representatives.

The delivery of the BLIZZARD 603e Power Board is scheduled for late May
1997.  Availability for the A1200 desktop system is depending on the
finalization of the CE approvals until that date.

@node NEWS40 "Phase5 Announces CyberStorm 604e PowerPC Boards"
@toc NEWS

Oberursel, February 25, 1997:

phase 5 digital products is proud to announce the upcoming CYBERSTORM PPC
PowerPC-based accelerators for Amiga 3000(T) and 4000(T) as well as systems
with compatible CPU-slot.  With these innovative and powerful new
accelerators a new dimension of performance is brought to the Amiga, with
performance increases of 10 times and more compared to the fastest 68k
based accelerators available today, resulting in a breath-taking
performance. 

Primarily being designed as an upgrade board for existing Amiga systems,
the CYBERSTORM PPC incorporates phase 5's innovative dual-processor
technologie, where a fast PowerPC RISC processor is combined with a 68k
processor, in case of the CYBERSTORM PPC either a 68040 or a 68060 CPU.
Both CPUs dynamically share the memory and system busses, what is necessary
for a true multiprocessor behaviour.  While the original AmigaOS 3.x
continues to run on the 68k CPU - as well as all existing applications do,
what provides 100% compatibility - the PowerPC CPU is supported by a
comprehensive PPC Library developed by phase 5, which provides all
functionality to integrate the PowerPC into the Amiga multitasking
environment.  Software developers can easily optimze their programs step by
step by porting single tasks to PowerPC code, which then can run parallel
with 68k tasks.  Many important Amiga software vendors are preparing ported
versions of their software packages already, so it is expected that a large
quantity of software products supporting the PowerPC will be available
soon.

The CYBERSTORM PPC will initially be availabe with the fast PowerPC 604e
processor in clock speeds of 150, 180 and 200 MHz; the socket for the 68k
companion processor accepts either a 68040 or a 68060 CPU.  It provides a
64-bit wide, extremely fast memory expansion option (which can be upgraded
by using pairs of standard PS/2 type SIMMs) which is dynamically shared by
the two CPUs.  Additionally, the CYBERSTORM PPC comes along with a
DMA-driven Wide ULTRA SCSI controller on-board, which allows transfer rates
of up to 40MB/s and is ready for the most demanding and professional
applications.  A 32-bit high-speed expansion connector with DMA access to
the main memory is also provided for later upgradability.  The 200MHz
version of the CYBERSTORM PPC provides - only on the PPC side - a raw
performance of more than 350 MIPS or approximately 8.1 SPECint95 and 7.1
SPECfp95 (estimations based on Motorola/IBM manufacturer specifications) -
a blistering performance that goes far beyond most PC systems available
today.

The CYBERSTORM PPC will be delivered with a comprehensive software package,
which includes the PPC library as well as tools for creative users, among
them a Public Domain GNU C compiler for PowerPC (including sourcecode) and
many demo programs and utilities with sourcecode; in addition to this
software free developer support is available via the phase 5 FTP site. 
Last not least a PowerPC-optimized version of CyberGraphX V3 with
RISC-optimized CyberGL/3D and MPEG functions and libraries is included - of
course with comprehensive documentation. 

The CYBERSTORM PPC will be selling for a very attractive price, offering a
superior price/performance relation.  The suggested retail prices are as
follows:

CYBERSTORM PPC w/ 150 MHz 604e processor   
DM 1295,- / GBP  529.00 / USD  698.00
CYBERSTORM PPC w/ 180 MHz 604e processor
DM 1595,- / GBP  649.00 / USD  879.00
CYBERSTORM PPC w/ 200 MHz 604e processor
DM 1895,- / GBP  769.00 / USD 1069.00

Note: All prices are recommended retail prices.  English and german price
include local VAT, the recommended US price does not include local taxes. 
The prices are without the 68k CPU which is necessary to operate the
CYBERSTORM PPC.  68k processors from existing processor boards can be used
on the CYBERSTORM PPC by pluging these into the provided socket.  If you
don't own a 68k CPU already, ask you local dealer for an attractive bundle
offer.

Registered owners of a phase 5 68040- or 68060 board will - within the
PowerUp upgrade program - receive special, attractive upgrade offers by
mail during March 97.  The handling of these upgrades will be done via
local appointed representatives.

In the second half of the year, an innovative graphic board will become
available for the CYBERSTORM PPC expansion slot which will provide a
functionality subset of the innovative CAIPIRINHA custom chip.  By
providing a stand-alone version of the DLRP (Display List Risc Processor)
this board will offer superior display funtionality, highest WRAM-based
resolution, pixel depth and speed as well as the possibility to start
developing software that will support the functionality of our upcoming
A/BOX computer system (please refer also to the project information about
the A/BOX project in our news section).

@node FEATURE1 "The Gateway Amiga Convention"
@toc FEATURE

===========================================================================
                       THE GATEWAY AMIGA CONVENTION
  Pete W Storonskij                                     pws@swine.unl.edu
===========================================================================

I'll just skip the part where we drove on the highway for about a dozen
hours to get into St. Louis, and subsequently went on a rollercoaster ride
in the big clover leaves in the extensive St. Louis Interstate system.
Let's just say that we found the convention site a half a day in advance,
so we had lots of time to make sure we were there when they opened.

When we entered, the first thing that we saw were a lot of yellow
smiley-faced balloons. :) :) :)  There were tons of them, and since they
were lighter then air, a ton of balloons is quite a lot.  The balloons
were mostly on the ceiling, and in columns set between the tables, and
attached to every other nook and cranny in the place.

Soon there were a lot of people filling in the convention.  The maximum
occupancy was 35 for the main room, but that was exceeded by just the
exhibitors.  With the addition of enthusiastic convention goers, the
hallways made for a nice place to meet people. :)

There were lots of exhibitor booths, too.  There was the coffee counter at
the Scharp Designs table, and a Toaster at half of the others.  There were
two Toasters at the NewTek booth, as well as Spike and a few others to
command the Toasters to make weird shapes.  Dale Larson of Intangible
Assets Manufacturing was putting Commodore-symbol Smiley faces on people. 

The best decoration there was the Amiga Report TV set encrusted with
miscellaneous plastic and computer parts.  It was showing a Portable Jason
Compton unit called Legacy.  There was also a full sized, Interactive
Jason Compton there to answer any questions, pose for pictures, and so
forth. The Portable Jason Unit was stuck in a 2 minute 38 second feedback
loop and was fully immersed in selling copies of itself, where as the Full
Sized Jason was flanked by three technitians from the Amiga Report staff
feverishly replacing parts on Jason to make sure he kept on running :) 
Every once in a while, one of the technitians had to pull out the fire
extinguisher to quash a fire starting in one of Jason's main panels. 

I had noticed that all of the exhibitors had name tags, but the rest of us
had no name tags, so I found a nice looking piece of non-Amiga related
paper and put my name and other important information on it, and I fixed
it to my sweater :)  Then, I went around talking to everyone.  I had
gotten back to the Amiga Report booth for the fifth time when Pat Larken
of the Kentuckiana Planetary Empire walked by and recognized me :)
"Nuclear Golf" he said, pointing at me, smiling.  A fan had discovered me
:), thereafter, I was smiling like all those yellow balloons :) :). 

I also brought my portfolio of snow sculptures to show to people,
including the leaning Tower of Pisa and a gothic cathedral with all of
those flying buttresses. :) 

At the end of the first day, the convention started to draw names from the
registry.  I was just about to start a conversation when my Dad came over
and said that I wad won something :).  I start heading through the people
crowded around the front of the convention table while my smile
continually grew until I had out smiled all of the balloons.  I had won
papers for a possible A4000 to be drawn for a bit later, in the NorthWest
Amiga Group Headquarters sometime in the near future :) :D :D.  So go
ahead and cross your fingers for me :).

*** THE SECOND DAY ***

The last day of a convention is always reserved for all around sillyness. 
With this in mind, I tossed out my old name tag and created a new one from
scratch.  It read: "Pete W Storonskij: ALIEN SPY".  I attached the name
tag to the front of my B52 StratoFortress T-shirt.

My Mom entered the convention armed with a black permanent marker and
started redesigning all of the smiley-faced balloons. ::::)  I entered
with my own smile and started pointing out that I was an Alien Spy.
Everyone liked my new identity :^] I also managed to draw some creative
things on a few of the balloons, as well as the 30 minute old Alien Spy
logo. :O

I was deciding what to draw on a balloon when I had noticed that the
Interactive Jason Compton had gotten loose and was roaming around the
exhibits, passing out fliers and causing havoc in general.  The Amiga
Report Technitians came by just in time with their fire extinguishers in
hand and proceeded in carting the Interactive Jason back to Central
Control for a complete refit. :">

Before long, most of the balloons were now cats, dogs, pigs, and various
other things. :X A few of the balloons had found their way into the inset
lights and were happy to glow a bright yellow.

@node FEATURE2 "Amiga '97 Show Report"
@toc FEATURE

===========================================================================
                     Amiga '97 St.  Louis Show Report
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

I first started going to Amiga shows in 1995, when AmiJam '95 was held in
Calgary.  Since then I've been to several, including the most recent
Cologne show in Germany.  I thought the Gateway show would be a good
opportunity to relax, see the sights, and have a good time.

It definitely was a good time, although there wasn't much time for
relaxing.  It was the first show where I came not just as a press guy, or
as a representative of a company, but as a full-fledged exhibitor.  I, and
the others at Amiga Legacy, had a table set up showing off our upcoming
videotape-based Amiga magazine.  This has the effect of taking a LOT of
your available time away from you.  As a result, I wasn't even free to see
everything at the show!

This is pretty unusual.  Typically, by the end of the second day I'm at a
show, I've seen everything, talked to everybody, and am just waiting for
the teardown to come so that the people I've got plans with for the evening
can get it over with and be free to go out on the town. :)  This time it
was different.  Not only was I also helping to man a table, but the show's
hours were VERY short (6 hours the first day, only 5 the second).  This
might not have been so bad if I wasn't also trying to manage an online
conference from the show (which turned out badly for reasons primarily
outside my control.)

However, I did get around to see quite a bit of the show.

The organizers, the St. Louis Gateway Amiga Club lead by show chairman Bob
Scharp, did a great job of promoting the show for over a year.  As a
result, they had very good exhibitor turnout (including an overseas visit
from Hisoft) and something quite near an attendance of 1,000 over the two
day period, not at all shabby.  Scharp was also promoting his
limited-edition temperature-change coffee mugs, and filled a last-minute
vacancy with a long table known as "Scharp Software", which seemed to
consist of endless boxes filled with various Amiga disk magazines (Amiga
Animation, Best of Amiga, etc.)

Inside the show itself, the biggest single attention-getter seemed to be
Canadian dealer National Amiga, which had the largest single display area
and a large variety of products, including their new Insert104 keyboard
adapter.  Greg Scott and Joe Archibald of National were constantly busy
selling off tons of stuff, although curiously enough none of the A1241
Q-Drives (which only recently arrived in North America) were sold.

Nearby was one of National's American contemporaries, Randhir Jesrani and
CompuQuick.  They, too, were doing a brisk business, including their stock
of AT 14 and 17 inch monitors.

Next to CompuQuick was Don Hicks and Amazing Computing.  Don was pushing
very hard to get attendees to subscribe or renew their subscriptions to the
US' only newsstand Amiga magazine.  Hosted in the Amazing area was Keith
Siders from ProvTech with his AmiFast A3000 SIMM card, as reviewed in a
recent Amiga Report.

On Saturday, Richard from Hisoft sat in an area near Amazing, showing off
the latest Cinema4D and IBrowse for the Amiga.  I had a chance to talk with
Richard on Saturday night, he seemed far more enthusiastic about the Amiga
than he did in our conversation at Cologne a few months back.

Silent Paw was onhand showing off, what else, a PAWS A1200 unit.  There
weren't the copious amount of PAWSTrac trackballs that I saw in Ohio, but I
heard them mentioned once or twice anyway.  Not far away sat Anti-Gravity
Products, who had Paul Nolan and his Siamese System on display.  They had
an Eagle A4000T, which was quite an attention-getter since they're far more
attractive than the QuikPak units.  The Siamese RTG system is not yet
complete for commercial sale but it was on display, and I have to admit
that it's very, very impressive.  The Siamese System seems to be the
implementation of the old "Put the Amiga on a PC card", but in
reverse.  Much as I'm not a fan of Microsoft and their operating system,
it's quite neat to see Cinema4D Amiga rendering on a Windows95 screen.

Not far away was Nova Design, with a very black booth showing off their
latest demo tape and selling ImageFX 2.6 at a VERY low price of US$190.
Aladdin 4D, almost ready for re-release, was unveiled at a special meeting
on Sunday, but I was unable to attend.

Newtek was indeed at the show!  Company president Tim Jenison was not, but
a number of sales and marketing people were indeed there.  They made a
strategic mistake in choosing to demonstrate Lightwave 5 on an Alpha rather
than an Amiga.  In one way, I can see their thinking: "We are showing off a
product, so we should show it off running as fast as possible."  However,
the correct thought, given the crowd they're trying to appeal to, would
have been, "We are showing off a product at an Amiga show, so we should
show it running on an Amiga."  Full marks for the effort, though, and they
did donate a Lightwave 5 Amiga as a door prize as far as I could make out,
so bonus points for that.

Dale Larson's IAM was next to Newtek, and he and Janet McIlvaine were kept
very busy shuffling copies of IAM's books, Connect Your Amiga and Torn
Shapes of Desire: Internet Erotica, along with the SYA DiskSalv/MRBackup
combo.  The Amiga logo promotion was, as always, a big hit with customers,
as were the Commodore stickers Dale put on everyone who walked by.  Dale
sold out of MegaBalls and MegaBall T-shirts before the end of the show,
prompting a few more people to make the bold claim that they, too, are
possessed of mega balls.

Y/C Plus, who specialize in add-on cards for Toaster systems, was there.  I
didn't get much of a chance to investigate their area, but they were
selling rebadged Philips televisions which accept video and multisync VGA
inputs.  Decently priced, too, considering their Amiga capabilities.  The
27" models were competitive with what Toshiba TIMM 20" monitors used to
cost, although I just got a report that the TIMM is being blown out on QVC
for $300 each.  Near to Y/C Plus was the Oregon Research area, marred
somewhat by the fact that Oregon Research could not attend in person, but
president Bob Luneski sent a candid letter explaining their need to buckle
down and work on products.

SoftLogik had a single person onhand promoting their product.  She
alternately looked overwhelmed with people and worn out so I didn't get a
chance to muscle in for a conversation.

Micro R+D had a number of products on hand, including the GPSoft line
(GPFax and DirOpus).  They were situated near Amiga Atlanta and AmiTech
(Ohio), two user groups sharing space and cross-promoting the Atlanta
banquet video of a year ago and Eric Schwartz t-shirts, among other things.

Grafica Software was giving personal demos of their MoneySmart personal
finance program at the show.  Quicken compatibility is promised very soon
in an upcoming version of the program.

One of the more talked-about items at the show wasn't even shown, we just
had some flyers to look at--a company is promising an Amiga ethernet card,
SANA-II compliant, for US$100 retail.  Stay tuned.

I was unable to talk at all with the rest of the exhibitors I can find
listed, but they deserve mention: Brewster Productions, FASTRAX, NASAU,
OZWare andPJ Nordmann-FX.  (The latter produced the Amiga '97 television
ads which were screened at the show's Saturday night banquet.)

Ah, yes, the banquet.  On Saturday night, a banquet was held for those who
bought special Amiga'97 banquet tickets.  Most of the exhibitors and
luminaries from the show were in attendance, as well as a number of
intrepid users.  A panel discussion was held, because everybody loves a
panel discussion--Randhir Jesrani, myself, Dale Larson, Don
Hicks, Kermit Woodall from Nova Design, and Greg Scott were involved, as
memory serves.

After the banquet, some of us lingered behind.  One thing lead to another,
and before long you had a dozen or so Amiga luminaries sucking down
hundreds of balloons of helium in front of a video camera.  Exclusive
footage will be in the first issue of Amiga Legacy, for those who are
interested in this sort of mayhem.

This sort of thing kept the usual ritual of going out and drinking to a
surprising low.  Despite the show's short hours, somehow it managed to keep
everybody in the hotel for just about all of the time.  It helped that the
hotel bar was open later than most.

Sunday morning, there was a meeting of developers run by Kermit Woodall. 
Not surprisingly for the first attempt, there were a lot of ideas thrown
out and a lot of focus on specific details rather than a bigger picture,
but the general mood of the group shows that there's at least some
potential for cooperation, if only people will get over their xenophobic
aversions to GUI creation tools.

At the show, Nova Design also showed off their new PowerPC developer
daughtercard.  Unlike the commercial boards which will be standalone, the
developer boards are daughtercards which plug into existing Cyberstorm Mark
II units and house the PowerPC and 68060 on them.  Nova's wasn't plugged
into anything, and it wasn't much to look at, but it represents the next
leap in processing power for Amiga computers.

Partially because there was less drinking than usual, there aren't quite as
many outtakes to share (aside from the balloons, of course.)  But there are
a few delights...

Robert Hamilton (lostman on IRC), a member of Amiga Atlanta who designed
the disturbing "claw clutching the boing ball" logo, introduced the Amiga
Report/Amiga Legacy team to the phenomenon that is the Waffle House.  For
those of you unfamiliar with the American South, Waffle House is a chain of
"restaurants" (and I use that term loosely) which dot the countryside once
you get as south as Missouri.  They specialize in using as much butter on
everything as possible, and making doughy molded waffles.  But we still
think Robert is great.

The Amiga Legacy video monitor was covered in random objects hot-glued to
it in order to attract attention.  It worked pretty well, especially the
orange compressed-air hose and the 8-track Marvin Gaye stuck on the side.

The Harley Hotel, where the show was held, is owned by Leona Helmsley.  For
those of you who missed it, she's one of the more deplored people in the
world, who got in a lot of trouble a few years back for thinking that
paying income tax was for people who didn't make a lot of money.  This
wouldn't be so notable if virtually everything in the hotel wasn't covered
with stuff like "Proud to have the Helmsley touch."  The font the hotel's
logo is cast in is pretty scary and imposing, too.  Not really the sense of
warmth and comfort I want when I'm on the road.

Lamar Morgan, the president of Amiga Atlanta is universally described by
those who know him as the most determined and stubborn Amiga advocate there
is.  Once he latches on to an idea, it's nearly impossible to change his
mind.  This was clearly evidenced as he tried to educate a very
bored-looking hotel clerk about the nuances of the Amiga as he checked out.
(And BTW, we captured him with some helium on tape, too.)

===========================================================================
                         Review: Burnout (AGA/HD)
                            By: @{" Ken Anderson " link KEN}
===========================================================================

Writing games reviews can be difficult. What I write here is going to
influence whether or not you'll consider buying a game. No matter if
several people have sacrificed months of social interaction to bring a game
to the Amiga, if I slag it here, chances are you won't buy it.

Burnout obviously has received a great deal of effort from someone. From
the disk icons, the introduction screens and the game itself, the author,
Mark Sheeky, has put so much talent into making this not so much a game,
but more of a style statement.  It's just a bit of a pity there is no
gameplay to back it up.

Plotwise, you are supposedly a driver in the futuristic sport of "Burning"
- the aim of which is to destroy the 3 other opponents without the same
thing happening to you. The others can be rammed to death, or simply shoved
off the edge of certain arenas. Winning earns cash, which can be exchanged
in an inter-level shop for various add-ons; spikes, shields and so on.

And that's about it, gamewise. Like most things, Burnout is improved with
more human players, although the computer-controller cars put up a fair
fight. There's the odd bonus level, but even when you've figured out what
you're supposed to do, they do little to add to the action. Apart from the
occasional change in arena, every level is practically the same; players
trying to bump each other off the edge of the arena or into spikes. The
power-ups add some interest, but once everyone has power steering and the
fastest engine, there's not much point in carrying on.

Burnout looks gorgeous. Raytraced cars on raytraced arenas make a visual
treat, and the whole package from start to finish is polished and
professional, although you may find you have to close a few programs from
Workbench before launching the game, even on a machine with Fast RAM. The
sounds are equally impressive, with nice crash'n'bang samples.

The game arrives on 7 disks, and requires a hard drive to run. However, I
found the hard disk installation procedure annoyingly difficult. The user
creates a drawer on the hard disk by dragging the contents of the first
disk into the desired directory: all standard stuff for Vulcan games.
However, for the remaining 6 disks, the icons have to be manually dragged
into the relevant sub-directory - Cars, Arenas etc. Once this done, the
icons then have to be double-clicked separately to unexpand each section.
It's time consuming - the expansion program is extremely slow and
unnecessarily pretty - and boring. The system is obviously designed for
future expansion, but I'd have been far happier with a standard Installer
script.

All in all, I can't really recommend Burnout, especially at the price.  At
half the RRP [Which is pretty close to what earlier Vulcan titles sold for!
-Jason], it might be worth it for the occasional multi-player bout, but at
the moment, there are less pretty but equally playable games in the public
domain.  Once you get over the gloss of the graphics, there's not nearly
enough content to keep you going.

Pros: Graphically excellent. Fun for a while with human opponents.
Expansion kits already available.

Cons:  Single-dimensional, shallow gameplay.  Hopeless hard disk
installation.

@node REVIEW2 "Review: Tiny Troops"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                            Review: Tiny Troops
                            By: @{" Ken Anderson " link KEN}
===========================================================================

Cannon Fodder promised that "war has never been so much fun". Tiny Troops
declares that "war is fantastic". It may not be much fun in real life, but
it makes for great computer entertainment. 

The plotline we are offered is actually quite enjoyable:  two alien races
at war - the original reason for which has long since been forgotten -
discover their planet is on it's last legs, and won't stand up to much more
fighting.  So rather than stop the war - let's face it, we all enjoy a good
scrap now and again - they just parcel the whole thing up and move it to
another world.  Earth, to be precise.  No-one here notices because the
aliens are actually ant-sized.

The potential offered by this storyline is used to the maximum - all of the
action takes place on 65 different zoom-in sections of gardens, toy sets
and the ilk.  Anyone who remembers racing around the breakfast table in
Codemaster's classic Micro Machines will know the kind of fun that can be
had in the most unlikely places.

Fun, in fact, is the word that sums up Tiny Troops. Although Cannon Fodder
was rewarding and addictive, the difficulty curve was almost vertical; it
sometimes felt it would be easier in real life.  Tiny Troops never quite
gets to the stage where you stop having fun and start getting annoyed.

At the start of each level, you can choose your compliment for the battle
ahead. At first, you are only given a choice of foot soldiers, which can
shoot and run and not much else. Before long, you've got guys (or maybe
girls? It's hard to tell) armed with every kind of weapon or vehicle
available.

Once the fray starts, it's playing-God time again, as you give orders to
your troops. They can be commanded either individually or as a group to
attack the enemy, move to a certain position, build a set-piece defence
line, return to base for a energy top-up, or just rush in head first and
kick ass. The background doesn't always remain passive; certain objects can
be push around and manipulated; vital in some levels. Of course, your
opposition don't just sit around waiting for you to attack - they're
planning your fate too. The level is won by either destroying all the
enemy, or destroying their teleport base - sometimes it's easier to
distract the ground troops long enough for a few of your guys to wreck
their teleport.

Controls are simple, using the mouse and a simple icon setup which takes
five minutes with the manual to work out.  Things move at a reasonable
sedate pace; there's no frantic mouse wrestling required to get your team
doing what you want, which greatly contributes to the feeling you're having
a good time playing this game.  There's no direct humour, but stomping
across carpets and negotiating garden gnomes can't fail to raise a smile.

Tiny Troops might not appeal to the console-owning arcade freaks who demand
graphics rushing past on screen at a rate of knots, but I can
wholeheartedly recommend Tiny Troops to Cannon Fodder fans, and to anyone
with a strategic bent.  This is Vulcan's best release yet, and I hope that
we'll see Tiny Troops II before too long.

Pros: Thoroughly enjoyable arcade and strategy mix. Solid, steady pace and
lots of levels. Two-player mode.

Cons: Simple graphics which sometimes get a bit garish. The terminally
serious-of-thinking might find it all a bit twee.

Tiny Troops is priced at 17.99UKP (+ 2UKP for P&P outside the UK), and can be

@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                            Review: Apollo 3060
  Joakim Olsen                                              jocke@plea.se
===========================================================================

One of the first (if not the first) 68060-accelerators for a standard
desktop A3000 was the Apollo-3060, which we will take a look at in this
review.

When I bought my card about a year ago there wasn't really much of a
choice, the only card that would phsically fit in my A3000 without having
to bring out the chainsaw was this card from ACT/Apollo.  At the time, it
did cost me ~US$1500 but hey, money is just money, and I could really use
the speed.  [Currently, the Apollo 3060 is significantly less expensive,
more like US$800. -Jason]

The first thing to remember when getting any 060-accelerator is that it
needs kickstart 3.1 (as of writing this, people has been telling me that
3.0 works as well), anything less will just crash because of
incompatibilities with the 68060. 

The Apollo-3060 is exactly the same card as the 4060, apart from the fact
that it's only got two SIMM-slots as compared to the 4060's four.  This is
because the card wouldn't fit in the A3000 otherwise.  If you have an
A3000T you should go for the 4060 instead.  These two SIMM-slots can handle
32Mb standard (non-EDO) 72-pin SIMM's, or, if you have a couple of
ED-SIMM's around, the card supports those as well (yes, that's ED, not
EDO).  The memory is autoconfig'ed but a big drawback is that the slots end
up as separate memory chunks unless you have 32Mb SIMM's, in which case
they will be configed as a contigous 64Mb chunk.  You can of course go for
one larger SIMM instead of two smaller to get around this problem, but it
really is a shame this wasn't solved in hardware.  There have been some
talk about the possibility to use the MMU to map the separate chunks into
one larger, but so far I haven't seen such a 'hack'. 

The card comes with a SCSI-II controler, which I haven't really tried that
much, but I can say one thing..  It's slow!  I still use the internal A3000
SCSI-controler but the onboard apollo-controler might be sufficient for a
CD-ROM (which I don't have). 

Before installing the card you should install the supplied software, or at
least copy the 68040.library replacement and the new 68060.library.  The
software didn't come with any flashy install-program (and mine was in
german only) but it's no big deal since it's only a few files that needs to
be copied.  A new CPU command supporting all the 68060-options is also in
the package, called CPU60.

Installing the card in my A3000 was the usual hassle, disassembling
virtually the whole machine to get to the CPU-slot, fitting the card and
the 'patch' needed for the card (a wire needs to be connected between the
A3000 scsi-chip and the kickstart-chips, the card comes with two sockets
with the wire between them).

Ah yes..  cooling..  my card came without a fan or heatsink, but my
retailer was kind enough to send me a set free of charge.  Now, adding a
heatsink and fan is necessary, but there isn't really room for it, so
actually my card is a bit bent, but it works well even on hot summer days!
(I ran the card for about two weeks without any cooling and experienced
tons and tons of weird crashes, these all dissapeared when I added the
fan).

Speed?

What can I say? It's fast, damn fast as far as Amigas go. From tests I've done
it adds up to be about the same speed as most other 060-cards. With my CV64 my
machine now feels snappier than any PC I've run into, even though the raw
CPU-power is far below that of a normal PC. There's been a *lot* of arguing
about exactly how fast the 060 really is compared to a PC, and I've seen
anything from "It's slower than a P60" to "It's at least as fast as a P133".

[The canonical Lightwave test of a year or so ago put an 060/50 and a P90
on roughly equal footing. -Jason]

I'd say it depends on what software you run, today there's not much
software that is optimized for the 060 and one has to remember that several
FPU-instructions has been removed from the 060-FPU compared to the old
68881 and has to be emulated, which can slow down programs like Imagine
etc.  Despite this fact, Imagine has never been more fun to work with! 
Hopefully, more 060-optimized software will come.

Problems?

Well, there are a few programs that are reported not to like the
apollo-3060..  The only one I've run into myself is ShapeShifter which
crashes as soon as I try accessing the serial-port.  This problem has been
known for some time but there hasn't yet been any patches neither for the
card itself or for ShapeShifter that fixes it.  Early CyberStorm cards were
known to have this problem as well, but it was fixed with upgraded
68060-libraries, so hopefully a fix for this should be released in some
time. 

[Interestingly enough, Darren Eveland, who is trying to start an
information resource for the QuikPak 060 card, reports a very similar
Shapeshiter crash upon accessing the serial port with the QuikPak card, as
well. -Jason]

Another little problem I've ran across is the fact that my machine just
wont do software-initiated reboots, instead it just freezes until I hit the
magic-three.  After some experimenting I was able to partly get rid of this
by removing the autoconfig jumper on the 060-card and 'manually' adding the
memory in the startup-sequence, weird.

Apart from these problems, there isn't much to say about the card, it does
what it's supposed to do, add speed to my beloved amiga, and it does it
pretty well. 

Still, if I was going shopping for a 060-card today, I'd probably not go
for this card.   The CyberStorm MK II has a much better support and is said
to be faster accessing Z-III cards, also the CS MK II has better
autoconfig-support in that it adds your valuable SIMMs as one memory-chunk
nomatter what SIMMs you throw at it.

Picasso 96 software may be used on other graphics cards.  It is available
on Aminet (ftp.wustl.edu) or on the Picasso 96 home page:
http://wwwcip.rus.uni-stuttgart.de/~etk10317/etc/Picasso96.html


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

Zorro II or III Amiga
Amiga OS/ROMS Version 3.1
68020 or better CPU

Also recommended:

Hard disk
extra RAM
Multisync Monitor


COPY PROTECTION

 None.

MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

Amiga Technologies A4000T
68040 25Mhz, 18 meg ram
Kickstart 40.70, Workbench 40.42 (3.1)
1.0 Gig hard disk
Nanao T2-17TS 17" monitor (30-86Khz)
Picasso IV and Picasso 96 version 1.8


INSTALLATION

Before you install the card you must install the supplied Picasso 96
software.  (note it is recommended that you download the latest Picsaso 96
software from Aminet).  The installer program prompts you through the
installation.

Also, remove Multiscan and the dbl monitor files from DEVS:Monitors and put
them in SYS:Storage/Monitors.  Open screenmode preferences and save your
screenmode to a NTSC or PAL mode. 

Open up your amiga and install the Picasso IV into an empty Zorro/Video
slot (in-line).  A2000 users must use the supplied cables since the video
slot is not in-line on that Amiga.  You must FIRMLY push the Picasso IV
into the slot.  In my A4000T I had to use almost all my weight to get the
card fully seated.

Put the case back on your amiga, connect your monitor to the Picasso IV's
15-pin connector, and reboot your Amiga.  All 15Khz NTSC/PAL modes now be
30Khz due to the built in flicker fixer.  Open up screenmode preferences
and you should have the Picasso IV screenmodes available. 


REVIEW

The card itself is well designed - no last minute "fixes" can be seen. 
Theres are lots of connectors and jumpers, but I did not have to touch any
of them.  It is packaged in a plain white box with the big letters "Picasso
IV" written on the top.  No fancy package cover like they had for Picasso
II! 

The Picasso 96 software is still in beta status, but it does work very well
and is easy to use.  It includes drivers for: ShapeShifter, AdPro,
Photogenics, and XiPaint.  A replacement "picture.dataype" is included so
that programs that support datatypes can use a 16 or 24-bit display.
Picasso 96 is also compatible with programs written for CyberGraphX.  For
example Photoalbum and Cybershow will work on 16 and 24-bit screens. 

So far I have tested the following software: MUI, MagicWB, Miami, Digital
Quill, Voyager, AmIRC, AmTelnet, AmFTP, Aweb, YAM, ShapeShifter, CyberShow,
Photoalbum, and Ibrowse.  All work without problems! 

I now regularily use a 1024x768x16-bit workbench - quite fast for everyday
use.  Even though I have the crippled A3640 card, the Picasso IV is still
much faster than an AGA 8-bit workbench.  Voyager is excellent on this
workbench.  Fast scrolling.  Great pictures at 16-bit.  The difference
between this and an AGA amiga is night and day.  The Picasso IV really
breathes live into the Amiga!

Graphics card speed and also CPU speed are critical factors.  If you were
to put a 040 or 060 accelerator inside your Amiga it would considerably
speed up access to the Picasso IV.


DOCUMENTATION

Documentation is supplied via a 38 page German manual!  I have been told
that the English manual has just been completed, and this will ship with
all future Picasso IV's to all English speaking countries.  In the mean
time, there is lots of information available via the Picasso mailing list,
and the World Wide Web to help you get started.  The English version of the
manual is even available for download.


LIKES

The Picasso IV hardware is very versitle - many optional modules are
planned.  The Picasso 96 software itself is very simple to install and use.
In fact you hardly know it is there!  It seamlessly integrates into the
Amiga Operating system.  There is also 2 options for screenmode
configuration.  The supplied PicassoMode 96 or the newer PicassoMode96 NG
"Next Generation".  The NG version will automatically make many of the
adjustments necessary when configurating screenmodes.

The card seems to be FAST in 16 and 24-bit modes.  I cannot see much if any
slow down from 8 to 16 to 24-bit.  Yes there is some, but the 16 and 24-bit
modes are fast enough for everyday use.  In comparison they are about as
fast as a 4 or 8 colour workbench on an AGA Amiga!

Screen swapping is EXTREMELY fast on this card.  Just as fast as an AGA
Amiga! 


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

The flicker fixer does not "pass-thru" Multiscan and dbl modes.  I wish
Village Tronic would have allowed for this.

The card has a bandwidth limitation of 85Mhz in all 16 and 24-bit modes.
So for example a mode of 1280x1024x16-bit @ 75Hz refresh is NOT possible. 
If you wish to use this mode on the Picasso IV you would have to settle
with a 46Hz refresh rate.  Interlace modes, however, are available. 

I would recommend 1024x768x16 or 24 @ 80Hz refresh.  This is a nice size
for a 17" monitor, and provides a very flicker free screen.

There is no screen dragging available in Picasso 96.

I suggest you visit the following WWW sites for some excellent information
on Picasso IV:

COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

I have owned the GVP Spectrum, Cybervision 64, and now the Picasso IV.  The
Picasso IV can be compared closely with the CyberVision 64 (no longer
available) from phase 5 digital products.

VS. GVP Spectrum...

The Picasso IV is much faster than the GVP spectrum in 16 24-bit modes. 
Due to the 4 megabytes of EDO video memory, it can also have 16 and 24-bit
colour depths at higher resolution (for example 24-bit at 1024x768 at 80Hz
refresh non-interlaced!).  In these higher depth modes the card is still
very fast. 

VS. CyberVision 64...

In comparison to the original CyberVision 64, the Picasso IV seems again to
be faster in 16 and 24-bit modes.  However, the mature CyberGraphics
software seems to be more optimized in some specific operations.  Both
cards provide fast, high resolution workbenches.  The Picasso IV has a
built in flicker fixer, whereas the CyberVision 64 has a "pass-thru" that
leaves Amiga-generated video modes untouched.  Both cards are excellent.
The Picasso IV should soon have the optional modules released (Pablo II,
TV-Tuner, etc...) The CyberVision 64 also boasted optional modules, but the
support for these was dropped by S3, so phase 5 did not release them. 


BUGS

Surprisingly, I did not find much in the way of bugs.  The Picasso 96
software is extremely stable, even at this early stage.  However, it is
clear the software can be optimized (for example front/back movement of
windows is slow).


VENDOR SUPPORT

I have not had to contact the Vendor.


WARRANTY

Unknown, but probably 90 days.


CONCLUSIONS

Excellent high resolution/colour depth card for Zorro II/III Amigas.  If
you are looking for a fast 16 or 24-bit workbench at high resolution,
expansion potential through additional modules and a built in flicker
fixer, then the Picasso IV is right for you.

One thing I find quite excellent about this board, even early on, is the
tremendous support available for it on the internet.  There are already
several Web pages dedicated to this card.  Picasso 96 software is also
frequently updated by its authors.

===========================================================================
                      Review: The Kara Collection CD
                            By: @{" Bohus Blahut " link BOHUS}
===========================================================================

A CD rom comprising the entire Kara line of color fonts, animfonts,
backgrounds, animated backgrounds and elements.  Also included are a pair
of Cloanto programs to edit both conventional and color fonts, and an
upgrade for PersonalPaint owners to version 6.4

Ah, those halcyon days of Kara fonts.  God bless 'em.  Warp back with me
now to those heady days of 16 color high res animation, and interlace
flicker headaches.  In the early days of the Amiga, we didn't have much
choice in the ol' font directory.  Everything was a bitmapped font, and it
never came in more than a few sizes.  Fonts were either really huge for
video, or small enough to be a workbench font (or a lousy publishing font).

Then Kara Blohm and KaraFonts came along.  These maximized the ECS limit of
16 colors in High Res.  The fonts were big and finely textured with bricks,
chrome, gold, etc.  Keep in mind that the 1.3 OS wasn't really set up to
allow for colors to be embedded into fonts, but there was a little program
that came with Deluxe Paint (Electronic Arts) that allowed the use of these
color fonts. 

KaraFonts didn't stop there.  There was also a series of animated color
fonts.  Each letter was an animbrush going through an animated reveal.  A
good example of this is the set of chrome letters that rotates into view
while a glint of light passes across each letter's face.   There's also a
script effect that gradually writes out your title, and several other
motion reveals. 

The only drawback was that since there were only 16 available colors in
High Res, the fonts often took over the whole palette.  This meant that you
couldn't have multiple color fonts on the same page.  This meant retreating
to the smeary world of HAM, or using several Amigas and genlocks to have
several palettes at the same time.  Ahh those heady days of hotwiring
Amigas! 

Zap back to the present... 

I haven't thought about Kara fonts for a long time.  Since I started using
Amigas with graphics cards and accelerators, my work drifted farther and
farther away from Dpaint compatibility.  Recently, I purchased an A4000 and
started playing around with AGA.  Since so many Amiga users are now using
AGA or similar machines, this means that several KaraFonts can share the
same page! 

This is perfect for video folks since the titles are nice and big, and the
256 colorspace is enough to stamp down several lines of Kara text.   One of
the later 256 color versions of DPaint or Cloanto's own Personal Paint
would do the job of actually animating this text.  The good news is that
Personal Paint runs on graphics cards! 

In addition to fonts, Kara has created "PlaqueGrounds".  These are reliefs
of textured tablets of wood, various types of marble, metals, etc.   These
are in 24bit, 256 and 16 color flavors.  The 24bit versions are designed to
load into framebuffers like the Video Toaster, and the other versions load
into a variety of Amga configurations.  These are meant to be backdrops for
text, and come in a variety of shapes and sizes.  There are also included
alpha masks for really clean composites. 

The recent re-release of Star Wars in the US will probably be fodder for
the fertile minds of Amiga users.  Kara created a package of space themed
animbrushes including moving star fields, an asteroid or two, and the
invariable satelite.  Think of it as a clip art collection for the
intergalactic jet set. 

Not to be outdone, Cloanto has included some of their own software on the
typically beautiful Cloanto-style packaging of this disc.  There's Personal
Fonts Maker, an editor/creator for conventional single color fonts.  Also
included is ColorType, the same kind of utility, but this one to create
color fonts. 

For those who have earlier original versions of Personal Paint (not
coverdisks), there is an upgrade on this disc to allow Ppaint to use
animbrushes.  There also an Arexx script to make setting up some of the
more elaborate animfonts (i.e.  setting up a series of animbrushes to make
the gradual effect seem like it's happening from left to right) easier. 

I'm a sucker for programs that run right off of a CD.  This disc lets the
user choose to either run everything from the disc (in several languages),
do a full IFF install of everything (maximum quality, maximum HD space), or
do a Jpeg install (quality slightly degraded, significant saving of hard
drive space).  The disc is also fairly well organized, although with some
redundancy.  For example, the PlaqueGrounds are sorted both by style, and
by material.  I suppose that this could make work easier at times.  When
one is searching for inspiration, they shouldn't also have to search hell's
half-acre for a file! 

It's also good to see Cloanto with some encouraging words in the extensive
AmigaGuide documentation.  They talk of future plans for Personal Paint,
and animfonts in particular.  They mention allowing imageprocessing to take
place on colorfonts, and also to save scalable fonts as colorfonts.  This
makes the creation of new colorfonts in the future a snap! 

There are 28 distinctly different Kara fonts, each hand-tuned to different
bitmap sizes, making for a total of 80 fonts.  The fonts are already
converted for use in specialty programs like Innovision's Broadcast Titler.
The disc is also complete with animated tutorials and slideshows showing
you what to do with colorfonts and how to do it. 

I feel that many of the styles of colorfonts are quite dated.   Current
print and TV aesthetic has strayed away from fonts who have textures that
call a lot of attention to themselves.  There are tons of included palettes
to change the look of some of these fonts, and I'd suggest that you explore
these.  While many of these fonts and effects were cool in their day,
there's been too much cheap cable TV that has overused this style of
lettering. 

A place where I think these fonts may come into their own is on the Web.
While television no longer embraces this style of font, nutty textures look
great on a web page.  This runs parallel to Cloanto's development of Web
specific tools for Personal Paint.  Some of these animfonts could look good
as animated GIFs on a Web page somewhere. 

Obviously, any limits here are the artist's creativity and time.   This is
a disc of raw material.  One can either use the raw material as-is, or one
can inject imagination and artistry to get something different.  I hope
that a whole new generation of artists discover KaraFonts, and are able to
get something new and exciting out of them.

                          Review: Magic Publisher
                            By: @{" Bohus Blahut " link BOHUS}
===========================================================================

A 4 CD rom set with hundreds of megs of fonts, clip art, and other
publishing utilities.  The set includes Final Writer SE and WordWorth SE.

Four CDs, eh?  That's a lot of material for a computer that isn't really
considered a publishing computer.  What could a user find useful in four CD
roms?  Moreover, how hard will it be to find _anything_ in four discs?
Fortunately, the set isn't aimed at any one type of user.  Magic Publisher
is aimed at everyone from the seasoned publisher to an Amiga user who
doesn't even have a word processor. 

One of the unusual features of this full-bodied CD set is that it includes
not one but two SE (Special Edition) of the two most popular word
processors for the Amiga; SoftWood's Final Writer and Digita's WordWorth. 
This means that even the publishing newbie can explore the world of print
with a single investment in this CDrom pack. 

I tried installing both WordWorth and Final Writer on an '040 2.1 OS 2000
with 16 megs of Ram.  Final Writer is the program that I've used most, and
after installing the "light" version it worked fine.  For those of us
accustomed to the many features of this fine program, most of these
features are absent, replaced with a window telling you how great the full
version is.  There is a special upgrade price to users of this collection.

Despite my best efforts, I couldn't get WordWorth to work.  Not only did it
come up entirely in German, but it was impossible to get started.  I know
that the full version WordWorth does in fact work (I'm writing this review
with it), and it's a good program.  I'm surprised that the "light" version
didn't function.  There is a special upgrade price for WordWorth as well. 

However, the focus of these CD roms isn't on these softwares.  The CDs are
ideal for owners of full versions of publishing software.  The bulk of the
disks are full of several formats of scalable fonts, and iff format clip
art.  The first disc contains the two special edition programs,
FontMachine, PasTeX, along with Intellifont format fonts.  Disc two has the
iff format clipart along with Adobe (postsctipt) versions of the font set.
The third CD has the font set in TrueType and DMF format, along with Bitmap
and Color fonts.  The final disc has all of the files archived for sysops
to put on their BBS. 

The biggest value in this collection is the included booklet.  It
illustrates every font, every clip art.  Too often, I've seen similar
collections opt to include some PD picture cataloger with mini-thumbnails
depicting the contents of the disc.  I don't think that this electronic
filing is any easier than the paper medium.  Having several fonts spelled
out per page makes comparisons between fonts easier for the creator.  GTI
have done their customers a great service by taking the time to print the
reference material.  It's great to be able to choose what fonts to install
before committing to the hard drive space. 

The idea of having the same font set repeated several times throughout the
discs in various formats is quite valuable for cross-platform work, but I
didn't find it to work.  I created a number of titles in a video using
fonts from this collection, and figured that it would be pretty slick to
have the labels and the packaging use the same font as in the video.  When
I took the discs to my friendly print studio and tried to load up the Adobe
version of the same font into their Macs, it didn't work.  Granted, it may
have something that we were doing incorrectly.  I'd like to hear from
someone who's has cross platform success with this set. 

The clip art is all IFF format.  This means that if you are counting on
taking advantage of the "cross-platform-ability" of this set, you'll need
to do some converting since IFF is not especially supported outside of the
Amiga.  The clips also originate in the public domain, so there's nothing
especially new here.  It is handy to have them all in one place, and well
categorized in the booklet.  For example, there is not only a category for
"Food", but also subcategories like "Vegetables" and "Drinks".  This kind
of care is what makes this collection special (though I wouldn't categorize
popcorn under 'puddings').  The clips are all black and white and vary
widely in quality, but even the worst would serve as a good starting point
in a good graphics program. 

While the CDs aim at the world of desktop publishing, let's not forget one
of the growing forms of publishing, the World Wide Web.  Again, the Amiga
shows its graphics muscle in bridging the worlds of electronic media and
print.  I've used these fonts on several web projects, and as I mentioned
earlier, I've used several of these fonts with Monument Designer on the
DraCo.  Some fonts didn't totally survive the conversion through
Intellifont, showing some missing characters, or showing no characters at
all.  Since these fonts are from the Public Domain, there's really no room
to complain, but I wish that GTI had screened the fonts more carefully. 

All in all, the set is an excellent value.  If you don't have a modern word
processor, this is a good way to get started.  If you're already the proud
owner of one of the Amiga's word processors, or a graphics person
(especially a Toaster user who is sick of the few useful FontBank fonts
included with CG!), this is a necessary addition.

                             Emulation Rambler
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

[This article was originally written a couple of weeks ago for Emuzine, an
all-platform online magazine which was to be dedicated to emulation.
Unfortunately, the magazine's publisher has backed out on the idea.  So
rather than let this article go to waste, I've decided to repurpose it a
bit.  Consider it a short reminder of where we are and what we've got in
terms of 8-bit emulation... -Jason]

Welcome, emulation fans!

While the recent flood of exciting emulators have been primarily for the
WinTel platform, (with a strong showing of portable Unix development as
well), the Amiga was perhaps the first computer with a strong base of
highly compatible emulators.

A note about the test system: Currently, the test system here is running

8-Bit Machine Emulation and the Amiga
-------------------------------------

Arguably the hottest craze right now in emulation is 8-bit computers: Apple
IIs, Atari 800s, Commodore 64s, you name it, if it was an 8-bit computer
platform of the 80s, odds are there's at least one good emulator out there
and a plethora of software for anybody willing to look hard enough.  The
Amiga is reasonably well endowed with 8-bit emulators, and is particularly
well off for C-64 and European 8-bit machine emulations (such as the
Spectrum and Amstrad CPC), owing a lot to the Amiga's strong European
popularity.  In no particular order and by no means a complete list, here's
some highlights of Amiga 8-bit emulation:

Apple II+ Emulators:  There's really only one high-class emulator for the
Apple II+, but it leaves very little to be desired.  Apple2000 was last
updated in 1994 by its author, Kevin Kralian, who has since gone on to
become a console game programmer at Acclaim and won industry accolades for
"Best 32X Game of the Year" a year or two back.

Apple2000 emulates a 48k Apple II+ with 16k "language" expansion card.
Standard Apple file images and DDD-compressed images are supported, as well
as memory snapshots.  The emulator mimics the Apple II+ display hardware
with extreme accuracy.  It also provides an annoyingly accurate rendition
of the Apple's internal speaker.  One or two virtual floppy drives may be
used, and the emulator comes with its own mock floppy ROM, only requiring
you to supply the actual Apple II+ ROM image.

High points: It's very fast, and luckily comes with speed control.  On my
system, "Ludicrous Speed" (no speed restriction) is far too fast.  Full
speed is attainable with a 68030/25 Mhz, an easy configuration to come by.

Low points: It doesn't support graphic board display (no huge loss since
the speed gain isn't needed, but inconvenient for graphic card users), and
does not have a full 6502 implementation, so undocumented opcodes cause
breaks to the debugger.

Apple II emulation fans will be interested to know that Jim Drew has been
promising a new Apple II emulator in "a few more weeks" for a few months
now.

Atari 800 Emulators: As for the Apple II+, we only really have one
emulator, the Amiga port of the Unix Atari800.  Unfortunately, unlike
Apple2000, Atari800 is coded almost entirely in C, and not very optimized
for the Amiga at that, so suffers from a lack of speed.  Hopefully, giving
it another chance will produce better results, and I'll share those when I
have a chance.

Similarly, Jim Drew is promising a new Atari 800 emulation to ship with the
aforementioned Apple II emulator.  Still no word on when it's really
coming, though.

Commodore 64 Emulators:  As I said, there's quite an assortment.

The earliest I know of was GO64!--very early, very primitive.  Following
that was The A64 Package, notable in the C64 serial interface box that came
with the package and allowed you to hook up virtually any real C64 device,
from a floppy drive to a hard drive or printer, to the Amiga and emulation,
and for its 6581.library which provided a full SID chip emulation, which is
now used by other emulators!

A64 tried very hard--it was pretty fast on low-spec Amigas, and could run
BASIC programs all day and even some games.  The best part about it was
that it would recompile C64 code into 680x0 code, which could be loaded in
and run on the emulator, greatly improving speed to the point that programs
were at several times their normal speed on a 68030/25 system.  But it was
ill-equipped to deal with things like D64 images and complex graphical
tricks.

A friend uses A64 to this very day for his C-64 development, since by
recompiling his assembler into 680x0 code he's able to code and test
programs far quicker by compiling them on the Amiga, then transferring them
back to the 64 for evaluation.

The modern crop of emulators consists of Frodo, MagiC64, and AXF-64.  In
rough terms, from left to right, they get faster and less compatible as you
go across.

Frodo is in simultaneous versions 2.4 and 4.0 for the Amiga.  2.4 is based
on the original Amiga-developed Frodo code, and provides a reliable but
resource-hungry C64 emulation which offers a full set of included ROMs (and
a modified Kernal ROM to provide keyboard shortcuts for many BASIC and DOS
operations), D64 support, SID emulation through one of two libraries (not
included, but easily found from other sources) or a simple SID card you can
build from the included schematics, and more.  As I say, though, Frodo is
slow.  To get a really faithful emulation, a system as good or better than
mine is highly recommended, otherwise you'll have to trade off video
refresh for speed.  Frodo also has joystick support and a built-in "freeze"
monitor, as A64 did.

Version 4.0 is based on the author's BeOS version of Frodo, and as such
does not accomodate all of the things V2.4 did.  For one thing, it only
opens in a Workbench window rather than a custom screen as 2.4 does, and it
does not support the 6581 or PlaySID libraries, only the SID card and the
new AHI audio standard.  However, it does offer things 2.4 does not, such
as REU support.  Frodo 4 is multiplatform, so you may want to check it out.

MagiC64 supports D64s and T64s, most of the niceties of Frodo, and is
often faster, although sometimes less accurate in replicating the 64 on
video tricks.  It supports the same two SID libraries as Frodo, has
included ROM emulation (instead of modified Commodore ROMs, as Frodo does.)

AXF-64 is the most "quick and dirty" of the lot.  You're on your own for
getting the ROMs (not difficult, and you can just use Frodo's anyway).
Unlike Frodo and MagiC64, there are no on-the-fly GUI configurable options,
you load up and you're on your way.  Disk images are not supported, but
sound library SID emulation is.  Reset is a questionable routine and
there's no way to hit "restore".  But it's coded for speed and may be worth
investigating if you're frustrated with Frodo or MagiC64.

Both Frodo and MagiC64 come with fairly complete documentation, AXF's is
less thorough but is sufficient for running the emulation.  Each has their
own keyboard layout, and I'd have to say I'm most comfortable with Frodo's.
AXF's is fairly close, and MagiC seems not to have its mind made up about
whether to follow C64 layout conventions or Amiga keycap conventions.


MSX Emulation: MSX emulation is one of the things that I think makes
emulation so great.  Not only does it give you access to software you never
thought you'd ever run again, but it gives you access to an entire computer
platform you might never have had a chance to see, EVER.  The MSX was a
Microsoft-inspired computer standard popular in Asia and Europe.  I'm no
fan of Microsoft but I do enjoy playing around with MSX titles, most of
which seem to be Japanese in origin.  Sony and friends all built MSX
machines and published software.

There are two major MSX emulators for the Amiga.  The first is fMSX 1.3,
based on Marat Fayzullin's Unix fMSX but heavily modified by Hans Guijt for
the Amiga.  fMSX multitasks, supports graphics boards, and runs at full
speed or better on 68040 or higher machines, and still is passable on
slower systems.  Hans keeps the software well up to date, and is pretty
responsive about making it better.

AmiMSX is a non-multitasking MSX emulation which may still have an edge in
MSX2 emulation and speed, due to its non-system friendly nature.  I've had
limited success with AmiMSX, since fMSX is a lot easier to use.


ZX Spectrum: God save me from yet another ZX Spectrum emulator!  There are
AT LEAST 4 or 5 of these out there, pretty similar when it comes to
compatibility (very high), typically differentiated by their speed, support
of image formats, and graphics board compatibility or support.  The
Spectrum was the first machine I felt about the way I feel about the
MSX--without the emulators, I might never have been able to use one.

My current favorite is ZXAM Spectrum.  It supports a wide variety of game
images, runs with good speed, and can be played in a Workbench window
instead of a custom screen, which is nice for those times where you want to
keep an eye on something else--a transfer, an IRC conversation, or the
like.

The original quality emulator is known simply as Spectrum 1.7.  Peter
McGavin proved it could be done, and quickly.  Even with a 68020, you can
get very good results thanks to his fast Z80 emulation.  Spectrum 1.7 is
aging and is not as friendly to graphic cards or image formats as other
emulators are.

Two newer emulators, Speccylator and Speculator (yes, they're different)
are vying for some respect.  Both are in the same league with ZXAM, but
have not supplanted it in my mind as of yet.


Vic 20 Emulation: The one Vic 20 emulation we have seems to have been done
as a throwaway project, but it does a pretty good job, all things
considered.  It's unfortunately not compatible with the newly release Vic
20 megademo, Veni Vidi Vic, as it seems to not identify itself as either
NTSC OR PAL.  But you can emulate memory expansion and run a variety of
cartridge ROMs on Vic-20, and at a very high rate of speed.


This is by no means a complete list--I haven't yet touched on CPC, Oric,
or BBC emulation, but those will have to wait for another time.

All emulators identified in this article can be found on Aminet, the
largest Amiga FTP network in the world, with more files than any other
computer FTP archive.

The primary Aminet site is ftp.wustl.edu, and the Emulation directory is

===========================================================================
                           Review: Aminet Set 4
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

The madness that is Aminet has launched yet another massive salvo!  

This one really took me by surprise.  Not only is it fairly close on the
heels of Aminet Set 3, but it has a specially included commercial software
package even more impressive than that on the Set 3.  This time, it's
DirOpus 5.11, complete with special upgrade offer to the significantly more
impressive DOpus 5.5!

This set reflects quite a bit of MOD and graphical activity on Aminet
lately, as over 2 gigs (uncompressed) of the new material comes from the
"mods" and "pix" drawers.  There are no new features in the interface
itself (still the good old AmigaGuide) and the disc organization is easy
enough to follow, with disc A acting as a catchall loosely organized under
"Tools", disc B holds the "gfx" and "pix" directories and is appropriately
enough labeled "Gfx", disc C is the "Fun" of the "demo" and "game"
directories, and the fourth disc is "Mods", with the comm, dev, mods, and
mus directories.  (Presumably, comm and dev wouldn't have fit on disc A,
likely because disc A also holds the material new since Aminet 16.)

Easy to navigate, or at least as easy as going through 4 CDs can be, each
disc has its own index and interface and updates you as to what's new and
where it came from.  (For example, Disc C also contains the MPEGs which are
fairly new to Aminet.)

The snapshot was taken a few days before Christmas, so it reflects roughly
the second half of 1996, which was a pretty busy time for Aminet.  Keep in
mind that the bulk of that was the aforementioned pictures and mods.

The DirOpus deal makes it nearly worth the price of admission on its own,
although 5.11 isn't nearly as good as 5.5.  (Only once 5.5 came out was I
ready to go whole-hog and use it as a full Workbench replacement, which is
working just fine as I write this.)  Buried on other discs are other
commercial titles--a couple of games and TurboCalc 2.1.

Aminet Set 4 is of course the dream for Aminet completists, or those who
just don't have time to keep up online but want to see what they've been
missing.  If you're already a Mods Anthology owner, are not particularly
interested in over a gig of graphics, and have been keeping up with Aminet
RECENT and have all you want, perhaps Set 4 isn't the best of buys for you.
But if not, it represents excellent value for what you're getting, the high
proportion of mods and graphics notwithstanding.

@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
              Review: Apollo 4040 Accelerator Board from ACT
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

ACT has developed a reputation over the past couple of years, especially
since they were finally introduced to the North American market, for
putting out decent quality accelerators at reasonable prices.  The Apollo
4040 is the top of their line for 68040 accelerators, sporting a SCSI
controller, 4 SIMM slots, and a heatsink/fan-cooled 040 chip at 40mhz.

The card itself fits in the processor slot of a desktop or tower A4000.
(For A3000s, a slightly different card is available which will actually
fit, since it uses only 2 SIMM slots.)  Installation is fairly simple, and
careful A4000 desktop owners will find as we did that while you need to
take out your rear bay of hard drives, you may not have to remove the rest
of the drives but can weasel your existing processor card out and fit the
4040 in its place.  We couldn't get our card to fully mate with the plastic
standoff pins in the motherboard, but nevertheless it has been securely
planted in the 4000 for some time and hasn't come loose.

The four SIMM slots can be populated with a total up to 128 megs, 60ns RAM
recommended.  A special, faster type of SIMM called ED-RAM (not to be
confused with EDO) is supported, but the manual itself says that ED-RAM is
so expensive it's probably not worth your while.  Something the manual does
NOT mention but more than one Apollo dealer has told us is that the Apollo
cards function much better for FPU-style operations when a 4 meg SIMM is
still on the A4000's motherboard.  Confusing, but true.

Finally, the fan requires power from the main power supply through a
hard-drive style power connector, which branches off into another power
feed (so that you don't "lose" a connector.)  The fan seems adequate, we
did not run into any power problems.  Installation instructions will
outline all of this as well as is necessary.  Pay special attention to the
timing/clock jumpers they tell you about.

For regular operation, no software support is required, the standard 68040
library is supported.  The SCSI drivers are installed from a separate disk.

General operations
------------------

The 68040 is a full unit, meaning it comes with MMU and FPU.  Programs like
ImageFX and Cinema4D perform quite admirably, typically realizing at least
a 50% gain in speed over a stock 3640 setup.  AIBB tests rank the Apollo
4040 as typically anywhere from 30 to 300% faster.  Its performance on my
personal favorite benchmark, the Cinema4D Stairway raytrace, is shown as
underperforming the Apollo 1240 card by a significant margin but still
beating a stock 3640 setup by a great deal.

The breakdown of the render tests:

Blizzard 1260-- 1:26 [Running CyberPatcher]
Cyber 4060   -- 2:00 [Running CyberPatcher]
Apollo 1240  -- 2:31
Apollo 4040  -- 3:26
Draco 060/50 -- 5:05
Falcon 040/25-- 5:05
Stock 3640   -- 6:01

Curiously, for both the Apollo and Phase5 lines, the A1200 cards (Blizzard
1260 and Apollo 1240) outperformed their A4000 equivalents (CyberStorm 4060
and Apollo 4040).

The bottom line for this test is that our 4000 desktop gained over 2x
faster rendering speed.  Specific applications vary, of course.

While we did not encounter the same difficulties we did with the Apollo
1240 card that require FastExec as a cure, it is still not a bad idea.

Integrating the Apollo into your Amiga environment
--------------------------------------------------

Not really all that difficult, all things considered.  If you're currently
using an 030, you'll be realizing a whole new world of speed.  If you're
using a 3640, you're still going to see major gains because of the added
speed of the processor and the relocation of the memory to the processor
board.

A word about the memory is in order: Except in rather extreme
configurations (Matching 32 meg SIMMs up), your memory will not be mapped
as a single contiguous block.  This has minor impact on performance when
you're talking about very large pieces of data, but more importantly it
means that your available memory for things like Shapeshifter and PCx is
going to be limited by your largest SIMM.  The Phase5 boards map their
memory into one single block, regardless of the SIMM combinations, which is
a significant advantage if you're using RAM from various sources or are not
able to shell out for a 32 meg SIMM.

One glaring oddity in the Apollo's operation comes with Shapeshifter.  It
runs the latest version quite capably, although a few programs which work
just fine on a CyberStorm 060 crash the Amiga entirely when run on the
Apollo.  Despite inquiring with Apollo and Shapeshifter experts, we were
unable to track down the problem.

The SCSI controller solely has an internal connector (nothing external like
most newer Zorro SCSI cards or the A3000 or 4000T), and its performance is
not the world's fastest.  For driving a CD-ROM, however, it is more than
adequate.

Overall, we're quite pleased with the Apollo 4040's performance.  Setup is
easy, the speed gains are immediate and noticable.  Sure, it could be
better, but the performance is still quite admirable.

The pricing of Apollo cards has done little but go down over the past year
or so, and with a current price under US$550, the 4040 is an excellent way
to juice up your A3000 or A4000.  As our Apollo 3060 review in this issue
indicates, the Apollo cards are far better as 040 than as 060 models.  To
make the jump to a top-of-the line Phase5 CyberStorm 060 card would be an
extra $300, at least, and would not include the SCSI controller.  So, if
you're not ready to jump to an 060, give the Apollo 4040 some very serious
thought.  Paired with a graphics card running CyberGraphX or Picasso 96,
your Amiga will become a very powerful beast indeed, and now that graphic
cards are less than $400 new (and something like half that used, in many
cases!), if you've been holding off on a major upgrade for your Amiga, now
is a good time.

@node REVIEW10 "Review: ArtEffect 1.5"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
               Review: ArtEffect 1.5 from Haage and Partner
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

It's fascinating to try and track the image processing market for the
Amiga.

For quite some time, there was AdPro, and all bowed to it.  In the
meantime, GVP was selling ImageFX, taking chunks out of AdPro's market.

Times change, ASDG becomes Elastic Reality and goes on to do lots of film
work, and AdPro becomes little more than the pack-in everybody gets with
their Draco.  ImageFX becomes king, and not without deserving it.  Not long
after, a British company puts out Photogenics, an image processing program
which, while not as powerful as ImageFX, is much easier to simply sit down
at and start playing with.  It's intuitive, works much like a paint
program, and is pretty affordable.

Not to be outdone, the brothers Dean put out a shareware product called
Image Studio, which for a fee about half of Photogenics' gets you a very
capable image conversion and manipulation tool.

That was, more or less, the world we lived in for a good year or two.
High-end stuff got done on ImageFX, those of us who liked our complimentary
Photogenics t-shirts used it to play around with, and if you just needed a
quick task done or a conversion without much hassle, you went with
ImageStudio.

Shoot forward to the present.  Photogenics gets something of a facelift,
which implements a rather counterintuitive GUI.  Not much after, its
original author, Paul Nolan, starts taking legal action against Almathera.
Almathera is now out of business (blaming VIScorp, but who doesn't?) and
rumor has it that their product line (along with company principles Paul
and Jolyon Ralph) is being picked up by Grandslam.  ImageFX is still where
it was.  Image Studio is now in version 2 and has some commercial support
from LH Publishing.  So where does ArtEffect fit in to all this?

Haage and Partner are not afraid to make bold statements.  They call it
Photoshop for the Amiga.  They don't give it a Photoshop-style price,
however.  In the US, ArtEffect sells for about $110, roughly half what
dealers ask for ImageFX 2.6 and a bit less than Photogenics 2 was selling
for, when it was still available.

How valid is their claim?  After all, even the most staunch ImageFX backer
has been known to concede that Photoshop has a leg up on IFX for one thing
or another.  Is ArtEffect the end-all, be-all of image processing?

The Basics
----------

ArtEffect is designed to work on a decent-spec Amiga, although as is always
the case with image manipulation, the more power you have, the better.  An
020 and hard disk are absolutely required, as is OS 3.x.  You'd be a fool
to try to run ArtEffect without a good chunk of Fast RAM and a processor
above an 020 of some sort, and while ECS is supported, you really should
consider using an AGA machine or one running CyberGraphX, which is
supported as standard.  The test system is a CyberStorm 060/50 system with
a CyberVision 3D running CyberGraphX 3 (recent beta).  The CyberPathcher
tool does not explicitly list ArtEffect as taking advantage of its
capabilities.  (in fact, I couldn't find explicit reference to an FPU of
any kind)

ArtEffect does support HAM8 if you don't have CyberGraphX and want to get a
better color representation than 256.  However, keep in mind that you lose
resolution and also give up a lot of speed to see those results.  You have
been warned...

ArtEffect can open on a public or custom screen.  When loading, ArtEffect
does a mini-benchmark on your graphical capabilities and seems to find
custom screens significantly faster, but your mileage may vary.

The workspace of ArtEffect is comfortable and intuitive.  Your images are
loaded into windows, marked off with rulers by default, and a primary
toolbar and option window follow you through most operations, which are
chosen using the menu bar.  A number of other configurations, such as brush
shape (a very powerful tool, if you know what you're doing) are available
as function-key popups or menu selections.

The toolbar has basic drawing options--draw line, draw open/filled circle
and square and polygon, etc.  You also have some control over brush or
spray, text matting, and the like from the toolbar.  Incidentally, this is
the first program I've seen on any platform to use a nice muted color
palette for its buttons (much like MagicWB).  Typically, paint buttons are
either mono and boring, or garish and ugly.

The variety of paint modes, which range from simply drawing to blurring,
smearing, "impressionisting" and the like, are straightforward, easy to
use, and reminiscent of the Photogenics style.

The real power of ArtEffect is in its filters, though.  You can draw
circles all day to your heart's content, but when it comes to applying
actual effects, the filters are the place to look.  Dozens of filters are
supplied (and more are available as option disks, or occasionally as free
upgrades), and each brings up a quick preview window which lets you examine
what you'll do to the image before committing.  Typically, each filter has
options (for strength, angle of application, etc.) and as you change these,
the preview dynamically re-renders.  There is also a generic "convolve"
filter for inputting your own 5x5 matrix convolution effects.

It's really a snap to get ArtEffect working for you.  As a dealer's ad for
the product says, you really can get by without the manual, although it is
itself competent, although certainly not the most nuanced on the art of
image processing.  (Its English is a bit uncomfortable at times, which
surprises me since I've read the translator's posts on Usenet for years and
his conversational English is flawless.)

Unlike some reviewers who embrace easy to use programs like ArtEffect or
Photogenics, I'm willing to admit the real reason.  ImageFX intimidates me.
I know full well how much power it has (I watched as its most recent demo
tape was built from the ground up), but I can't seem to harness the power
as easily for the more basic things that I'd like to do.  That said,
particularly in light of Photogenics "step backward" in GUI
standardization, ArtEffect offers the best power-to-ease-of-use ratio of
any dedicated image processing program out there today.

That doesn't mean it's perfect, though.

I'm not sure which is the more glaring failing--the poor Undo, the lack of
ARexx, or the lack of GIF saving.  So I'll outline them in that order and
let you decide.

Here's that Photoshop comparison again.  The thing everyone crows about
Photoshop is its "layers".  Photogenics tried to capture this by
implementing a "FIX" system where no change was permanent until you deemed
it to be so.  But ArtEffect doesn't come close.  The minimum level of Undo
is a single-action undo/redo.  The maximum level is that you can undo any
change made with a single drawing tool.  So, you can scrawl all over a
picture or draw several circles, but once you change from the circle tool
to a draw tool, or vice versa, or switch filters, your changes are
permanent.  Needless to say, for serious work this is not the best of all
possible scenarios.

There's no ARexx.  No simple way to integrate other programs.  The
documentation alludes to developer resources to do this, and the program
does support TurboPrint and PrintStudio and ScanQuix, but there's no way to
integrate ArtEffect seamlessly into a suite.  This also removes the
potential for batch processing.  ArtEffect is meant to work with single
images, and that's the way it will stay for the time being.

Finally, while you can load GIF, you cannot save it.  I understand that the
GIF licensing scenario is not the greatest, but I wish developers would
follow Cloanto's example and just bite the bullet and support the standard
that people need for their work, particularly the Web.  Nobody can accuse
Cloanto of knuckling under to Unisys, since they were one of the spearheads
of the PNG movement.  ArtEffect will let you save in PNG, but it's not
quite the same...

But the bottom line is that for the price, ArtEffect is extremely easy to
get comfortable with and put to work.  If you go into it with your eyes
open and know what to expect--an excellent tool for manipulating single
images--you'll be very pleased.

                Mini-Review: CyberVision 64/3D from Phase5
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

The question of how to handle this review has been bothering me for a few
weeks now.

This can't be a complete review, because the CyberVision 64/3D isn't done
yet.  Namely, there's practically no software that takes advantage of the
"3D" portion of that name, if you disregard a couple of 6 week old demos on
the CyberGraphX support site.  Some 3D software developers are apparently
only now getting their boards.

So, that said, I can hardly fairly evaluate a 3D board if I can't do
anything 3D with it.  On the other hand, Phase5 has been happily selling
the board for months now, so it doesn't seem fair to let that go by without
comment, either.

The compromise is this, a mini-review pending some additional software
support.  After all, the installation process is the same, and we've got a
pretty good idea what to expect out of the CyberGraphX V3 software by now.

Each CyberVision 64/3D card comes with 4 megs of video memory and is Zorro
II and Zorro III compatible.

The board itself is oddly shaped, with a cut-out area to accomodate the
just-released scan doubler/passthrough module (which we don't have onhand
for review, unfortunately.)  If you're using it, you have to install the
board in an inline Zorro/video slot since the scan doubler portion plugs
into the video slot.  If not, any Zorro II or III slot will do.

Configuring the board is pretty straightforward.  When I got it, it was
shipping with an early beta of the CyberGraphX V3 software (something like
beta20.  It's up to beta54 at the time of this writing.)  If you're using
something this old, upgrade it IMMEDIATELY.  You'll be a lot happier, as
certain basic features were not properly working in the early release
version.  The CyberGraphX official home page is at
http://www.best.com/~vgr/cybergfx/ and I strongly recommend that you learn
this address, memorize it, bookmark it, because it's the lifeblood of
CyberGraphX users.

Anyway, CyberGraphX, as most of us know by now, is a very powerful and very
useful retargetable graphics system which uses the Amiga display database.
Translation--you can make any program which gives you a screen requester
(including Workbench) put itself on a CyberGraphX screen simply by
selecting one from the list.  Further, you can make most programs which
DON'T ask you what screen to go onto run on a CyberGraphX screen anyway,
using a tool like NewMode.

CyberGraphX version 2 is available as a commercial product for most
graphics cards out there.  Version 3 is going to be freeware for everyone,
so we're told, but so far there is not V3 support for anything other than
Phase5's cards, the CyberVision 64 (no longer made) and the CyberVision
64/3D.  Phase5 is even promising support for the new Picasso IV which runs
the competing standard Picasso 96 software, but the CyberGraphX support is
not available yet.

The current CyberGraphX betas are quite stable, and now features are being
added.  Still not much word on the 3D support.  The demos, that which there
are, show polygons with realtime mapped textures on them in a 15 bit
screen.  You can rotate the objects using assigned keys.  It's neat, but
not very useful at present.

CyberGL is the big exciting thing for CyberGraphX 3 that nobody has seen
yet.  The idea is that it will be a subset of OpenGL, the graphical
standard used by software like high-end PC 3D applications, making it
easier to port them to the Amiga.  But again, we've yet to see it publicly.

Previous to this card, I was using a Retina Z-III board under CyberGraphX
2.  While by some accounts the Retina Z-III is actually the fastest
Zorro-III Amiga graphics card, I was never quite comfortable with it and it
always had a few oddities under CyberGraphX.  (The original RetinaEMU
software was horrible to use.) The CV64/3D is reportedly somewhat slower
than both the Retina Z-III and the CV 64 for some screen operations (since
the CV64/3D lacks some of the support hardware the CV 64 had access to).  

So, it's a tough call.  Reports indicate that Picasso96 is actually a
decent RTG system and it does provide CyberGraphX emulation (although
certain official CyberGraphX tools seem to be threatening to prevent this
from working), so the Picasso IV, with built-in scan doubler, seems to be
delivering everything it was supposed to at present.  The CyberVision 64/3D
now has its scan doubler out, but the full fledged 3D is not a reality yet.
These are the two big choices in the new graphics card market right now,
and the choice is by no means clear.  I really enjoy using the CyberGraphX
screen environment, particularly its continued support for screen dragging
and a very similar feel to the original Amiga system.  Hopefully the 3D
features will be available quite soon so we can make a full-fledged review.

@node REVIEW12 "Review: CyberStorm Mark II A4000/060 Card"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
           Review: CyberStorm Mark II A4000/060 Card from Phase5
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

The original CyberStorm is the grandfather of all 060 cards.  It wasn't
cheap when it came out (in the neighborhood of US$1500!) but it delivered a
lot of power when people were screaming for it, after the release of the
Pentium.

The CyberStorm line has since matured and been redesigned in a lower-cost
manner.  The Mark II no longer incorporates all of the features of the
original card, leaving you with a base high-power 060 card to work with and
a SCSI-II option.

The Cyber Mark II is an 060/50 card with 4 SIMM slots, which replaces your
existing CPU card in an A4000 or A4000T.  Doing this in an A4000T is quite
a project, as it involves removing the central drive bay from your
machine, no less than 6 screws, two cable detachments, and a very difficult
replacement project.  Be sure you put your RAM on the card FIRST (RAM, in
this case, is recommended as 60ns standard SIMMs.  EDO is not supported.)

The 060 is not heat-sink or fan-cooled, as is typical for 060 cards.  It's
not exactly a chilly chip, but manufacturers have enough confidence to
leave it uncooled.

There is a bit of a chicken-and-egg issue with installing the 060, because
the existing 68040.library is insufficient to drive an 060 Amiga.  Instead,
you have to install a new "fragment" 68040 library and a 68060.library
which the 68040.library points to.  Follow the instructions very carefully
on this one or you could be beating your brains out trying to find out why
your Amiga won't boot.

One interesting thing about the CyberStorm Mark II is that the 50mhz clock
crystal is *warranty sealed* with a strip of paper (which, come to think of
it, would be fairly easy to break by accident if you were manhandling the
card).  Some people (and dealers) have been known to overclock processor
cards, with or without their customers' knowledge.  Manufacturers sometimes
cautiously condone this practice, but Phase5 is sending a very clear
message in this case.

Going 060 is a bit of a jump.  While most software is quite compatible,
those older titles which perhaps just barely worked on a heavily degraded
040 may finally give up and break on the 060.  Quite often, disabling
certain caches will help this problem.  What you get in reward for making
the jump is a very fast Amiga.

Once installed, with the support software in place, you're ready to get to
work.  The 68060 has extra cache modes not available on other processors,
and the software preconfigures the 060 for peak performance--as one of the
documentation files warns, the included CPU060 command should only be used
by people who know what they're doing since it will only slow down your
operation.

The 060/50, in and of itself, is a performance boost over even the fastest
040 chip.  But it's the support software that makes the Phase5 card stand
out over other models.  As those of you who know the Phase5 060 line, or
remember my Blizzard 060 review will recall, the magic is in the
CyberPatcher utility.

The simplified basis of CyberPatcher is this: The 68060 incorporates an
FPU, just as the 68040 does.  But the 68040's FPU is not always as
efficient as a regular 68882 FPU, and the 68060's FPU further emulates
certain commands rather than executing them directly.  These levels of
abstraction can slow down serious FPU tasks like rendering.  The
CyberPatcher program intercepts these commands, which would otherwise be
bogged down, and "points" them to faster ways to get the results they're
looking for.  Run CyberPatcher, and certain programs, including ImageFX,
Lightwave, Cinema 4D, and others, will be faster.

Benchmarking an 060 card can be difficult.  Real-world tests are generally
the only way to go.  The Cinema4D render test I'm fond of (320x400 raytrace
of the included Stairway example) gives the following results:

Blizzard 1260-- 1:26 [Running CyberPatcher]
Cyber 4060   -- 2:00 [Running CyberPatcher]
Apollo 1240  -- 2:31
Apollo 4040  -- 3:26
Draco 060/50 -- 5:05
Falcon 040/25-- 5:05
Stock 3640   -- 6:01

As you can see, the Cyberstorm Mark II is fully 3 times faster than a stock
A4000 or A4000T configuration, and runs rings around most other 040
implementations (and the Draco, whose 060 is apparently poorly configured).
It is interesting that the CyberStorm does not outperform the Apollo A1200
040 card by as much as one might expect, and it itself is significantly
outperformed by Phase5's A1200 Blizzard 060 card.

Doing more general benchmarks can be difficult, since most benchmark
programs choke on the 68060.

While few applications are being specifically coded for the 68060, when
they are they are typically written with the CyberStorm in mind, and the
most bug-free 060 operations tend to be with CyberStorms.  For example, the
CyberStorm is the only 060 card I know of which has flawless operation with
Shapeshifter--the rest tend to encounter crashes when you access the serial
port.

The memory handling on the CyberStorm Mark II is one of the best things
about it.  Instead of most cards, which have to map separate blocks for
each SIMM, or at least for non-matched pairs, the CyberStorm's onboard
logic maps any combination of SIMMs into a single contiguous block.  Not
only is this more efficient overall, but it makes emulators like
Shapeshifter and PCx VERY happy, since they can only work in the largest
contiguous block.

In your day to day usage, you may start taking the 060 for granted.
Particularly once paired with a decent graphics card, you get excellent
speed for just about every application.  Window refreshes are very speedy.
Opaque window dragging and resizing can be more than just a chunky
curiosity, it can work the way it's supposed to.  And if you're an emulator
junkie like me, you can boast better-than-full speed C-64 emulation as well
as the world's fastest 680x0 Macintosh, since Apple never built 68060
models.  But don't forget that there's something inside driving it at a
very high rate of speed.

Other 060 cards on the market can lay claim to having superior speed in
certain respects.  Apollo cards are easy to overclock, so you can gain in
that regard.  The QuikPak 060 is actually clocked around 56mhz and supports
EDO RAM, so certain memory-access intensive operations run faster.  But
Phase5's 060 software support is far better than that for the other cards,
with new betas of the 68060.library coming out fairly regularly. 
CyberPatcher puts specific application performance over the top. 

Right now, the CyberStorm Mark II is the most impressive 060 card on the
market, hands down.  It runs about US$850, depending on where you look,
which means it's typically $50 or $100 more than the competition.  (QuikPak
offers a US$750 price with a 3640 trade-in, and the Apollo 060 card
generally sells around that price point as well.) However, the superior
technical support, compatibility, and performance are well worth it.

                        Amiga Report Mailing List
===========================================================================

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to majordomo@ninemoons.com

Your subject header will be ignored.  In the body of the message, enter

subscribe areport

The system will automatically pull your e-mail address from the message
header.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!             **

                          UUDecoding Amiga Report
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

     4.  Please send us your article in ASCII format.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your

Please stipulate as well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to

===========================================================================

AMIGA ZONE MOVES TO CALWEB!

THE AMIGA ZONE MOVES FROM PORTAL TO CALWEB INTERNET SERVICES

For over ten years the Amiga Zone has been an online resource, home,
community, oasis, for Amiga owners.

For over ten years I've made my living running the Zone and supporting Amiga
users all over the USA, Canada, and the world.

Five years ago when American People/Link pulled their own plug, we had to
find the Zone a new home and we found a good one on the Portal Online
System. 

Well, it's happened again.. Portal has informed all of its customers that
its ten year history as an online service and Internet provider is coming to
an end on Sept. 30, 1996.  This is very sad, it's short-notice, and the
decision is completely out of my control, but it's also irreversible.  

Portal is changing its entire business plan from being an ISP to selling an
accounting system to other online services.  

So be it. It's sad, but like I said, the Zone went through this before and
now we'll go through it again, and come out the other side better and wiser.

THE AMIGA ZONE IS MOVING TO CALWEB INTERNET SERVICES.

CalWeb (http://www.calweb.com) is a two year old Internet provider located
in Sacramento, CA.  It has a good sized customer base, and very
knowledgeable support staff. 

It's also run by a long time Amiga owner who has been a friend of mine for
many years.

The world of modeming has changed much in the last ten years.  In 1985 you
had very few choices and you had 1200 baud.  These days, everyone and his
dog has an ISP running and a web page

But the vast majority of those providers don't know an Amiga from a hole in
the ground, and could care less about Amiga owners.  Say "AWeb" or
"IBrowse" to them and they'll say "Omega?  Amoeba?  What?  Huh?  They still
make those things?"

CalWeb is different because it's the new home of the Amiga Zone.

In October 1996, a new custom front-end menued system will be added to
CalWeb to host the Zone.  It'll have features for Zone users that neither
Plink nor Portal ever had nor were they willing to add.

The tradition of a friendly online Amiga community, run by long time Amiga
owners, users and lovers will continue. 

Message bases, huge file libraries (we plan to move over the 20,000+ files
we have on the Zone on Portal to CalWeb, MANY of which you'll never see on
Aminet or anywhere else), live nightly chats, vendor support and our famous
prize contests will continue.

We've given away tens of thousands of dollars worth of Amiga prizes in the
last ten years.  No one else even comes close. 

I urge any and all of you who were on Plink, or who are now on Portal or
who may have left Portal..  or even if you were never on either but used or
still use another online service to join CalWeb for the Amiga Zone.  I
personally promise you the best online Amiga community we can possibly
build.  You will not be disappointed.


CalWeb has arranged a special signup offer for you!

Call:
 1-800-509-9322
  or
 1-916-641-9320
  or telnet to calweb.com, login as "guest", and follow the prompts. 

You can join CalWeb for US$19.95 flat, a month.

CalWeb takes major credit cards or you can establish a monthly invoiced
account if you don't have plastic.

The signup is FREE.

To get this deal you must say "THE AMIGA ZONE SENT ME" when you call or
signup online. 

I hope to see lots of you join CalWeb.  You can telnet into it from
anywhere for no hourly charges at all.  Your $19.95/mo fee covers
everything and also gets you ten meg of storage which includes hosting your
own personal web page.  Naturally, when the Zone opens there, you'll have
unlimited use of all of its features and areas.  Never a "money meter"
clock to worry about.

Your personal or business CalWeb Web pages are maintained by you via FTP. 
It's pretty slick.  You can make a net connection to the server with any
Amiga FTP client, put your files onto it, the permissions are automatically
set (no "chmod-ing" required!) and flip to your running browser and see the
changes instantly.

The Amiga Zone's new home is already up at:

         http://www.amigazone.com

running on CalWeb's server.  Ckeck it out!

Please feel free to write to me at harv@amigazone.com or harv@cup.portal.com
if you want more information.

Remember to say "THE AMIGA ZONE SENT ME!" when you join.

A splendid time is guaranteed for all.  

Please plan to join us in the Amiga Zone on CalWeb!
