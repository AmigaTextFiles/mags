It's becoming downright infuriating.

The rest of the computer world marches on as Pentiums get (relatively) dirt
cheap and Apple tries to convince the US market that there's a Mac your 3
year old kid can do a video presentation on that will get you a promotion
at work.  And the waiting continues for the Amiga buyout to be completed.

November 4th was another one of those "guidelines", this time for Commodore
UK's MBO to sign their contract.  If they did sign it, by the rules of the
buyout, the proceedings will go to a public bid in a month, at which point
any party that wants to can bid for the Amiga, and the last bid is the one
for the most money.

However, CEI, unhappy with the way things were going, decided to go to the
liquidators with a new proposal: They would sign a new contract, based on
their own private bid, and take the Amiga immediately, asking that the
public bid be eliminated.

This was the middle of last week.  On November 4th, I was unable to reach
either CEI or C= UK, and a call to the liquidator's office told me he
wasn't in.  Today (Monday), my budget only allowed me to try calling CEI,
and neither Alex Amor nor Dave DiFelici were in.

In short, I don't know anything at this point.  If something momentous
happens, Amiga Report readers will be the first people I tell.

Just hold on...a bit longer...

Jason

PS - As this issue is going out, CEI has had a contract written up to
purchase the Amiga.  The liquidators met with them Monday in CEI's
hometown, and are now going over the contract.  C= UK has not yet signed
their own contract.  If they don't, and CEI does sign, it will go up for
court approval.

==  The Amiga Community                               By Celso Martinho  ==
===========================================================================

Hi there,

This is my second article to AR.  It's 3 am and I'm bored so I decided to
write it while I'm eating some peanuts.

If you're reading this crap is just because the AR editor had nothing
better to put here and decided to waste some network bandwidth.  :-))

Back to the main subject, Amiga!

Is the Amiga community falling apart ?  Amiga users lost the faith in Amiga
and don't believe anymore that it can yet be a well succeeded machine in
the market ?  I wouldn't blame them.  At the time when I wrote the 1st
article (this is was 2/3 months ago) the Amiga owners were to be known next
week.

Surprisingly, to many, the answer to this 2 questions, to my point of view,
is NO!

I can't believe that in the last 3 months, so many good software was
developed to the Amiga.  Mostly Public Domain/Shareware as commercial
houses don't have a reason to waste money.  Who is going to buy a Word
Processor or a Image Processing program for the Amiga these days knowing
that there is the possibility that the company will drop support ?  Not me!

Aminet continues growing.  Everyday I see software for free or for a
minimal contribution fee that has the quality of some commercial products
for other platforms.  Amiga is really a winner here.

Some people say that the Amiga was becoming over-priced.  Those tend to
forget that it's not only hardware that costs money but also software so I
ask: Can you get so much for so less in any other platform ?

I never thought that the Amiga was over-priced, even considering only the
hardware.  What I must say is that the Amiga is not for dummies or people
that want a computer to turn on, write the document, print, turn off.  The
Amiga is a computer to be explored and for open minded people.  Those know
that they have Localbus, Autoconfig, Deluxe preemptive multitasking and
much more.  And they know that they paid much less for it than they would
for other systems.

Some call Amiga users a community and I agree.  There is this unexplainable
commitment with the Amiga feeling that *we*, that know it well, can't find
anywhere else.  I remember the defunct Commodore advertising the Amiga in
the early days saying "The limit is your imagination".  So I thought, a
machine w/o any limitations ?  I'll buy one :-)).  That was my first A500.

It will really depress me if the Amiga dies.  I hope it doesn't but the
future isn't very bright is it ?  Don't get me wrong, I know it's only a
machine, a bunch of electronic components put together in a box.  But I
guess that after all these years, the Amiga has gained the right to be
personalized to some.

The saddest news I had in last weeks was the announcement from SAS that
they will drop SAS/C developing and support in December.  I don't think
there is a reason to worry tho.  Whoever buys the Amiga knows that there
must exist a well supported commercial package for software developing.
AmigaDOS was already being upgraded using SAS-C.  If the Amiga survives,
SAS/C does for sure.

Good news.  There is a another Unix clone for the Amiga coming and it
multitasks with AmigaDOS.  The Emplant PC is *almost* a reality and for
some messages I've seen from betatesters, it seems that it really works as
expected.

The Networking software is one of areas in which the Amiga is becoming
better and better every day and it's really a dream having your Amiga
connected to the net with such a great OS running in the background.

[I'm out of peanuts]

Well, I don't have much more to say anyway...

As in the "Bon Jovi" song, the one in the CD-32 FMV demo CD, keep the faith
(Hmmm..  ?) !  :-)

Celso Martinho / Portugal.

From: Miles Goodhew <miles@brahe.anu.edu.au>
Subject: GPFax review - comments.

Hello,

    I was just reading your review of GPfax in AmigaReport #?, and thought
I might give you some feedback.  I couldn't find a general return address
for AReport, so it seems that your address is the one.

    Yes, Greg Perry's a doctor (philosphical type, not medical - No, I
don't know what field it's in either).  I've met him, and he's got a beard
to prove doctorial status!

    You were saying something along the lines of "goofy near-pastel
colours", and "own custom screen with a custom GUI".  If you ask me, better
descriptions would be "nasty hack of a hardwired interface with a
full-screen containing 8-or-so buttons which could all be replaced by
menus" (but seriously, how often do you need to get "About" info - does it
therefore need an easy-to-access button?).

    I may sound like I hate this program, but ti's really only the
interface which is bad, functionally it's quite good.  Indeed, compared to
all the other fax programs I have (i.e.  none), it excells in all areas.
Another minor quibble is the fact that it DEMANDS!!  that I enter a
business name, even though I want to use GPfax for personal use only (lots
of faxed from "Chickensexers, inc.", I suppose) - the manual's a bit calmer
on this point.

    Another thing is that A4 paper (as opposed to USLetter) is the standard
in Australia, and Europe (and indeed most of the world outside North
America, possibly excluding Japan, as far as I know), which is why it's the
default for GPFax.  A4's a more versatile form, as you can do "cute" things
like cut an A4 page in half and get two pages of exactly half the size
(surprise, surprise), yet still the same shape (A5).  Similarly you can
stick two together to get an A3 page (albeit a rather tacky one).  - The
wonders of A-size pages!

     Thanks, a good review.

Miles.

	- The business name demand may be more a function of fax "regulations"
	and standards than Dr. Perry's cruelty.  Thanks for the paper
	tutorial.

Subject: Some comments about AR

Hello Jason!

I've been reading Amiga Report since it started.  I think it's an
*excellent* source of information.  The only one I trust, as a matter of
fact.  And I loved the CEI conferences!  I have some general
comments/suggestions:

1.  There seems to be some problems with the Installer script.  Here's what
I get when trying to install: "Sorry...  an Error Has Occured!
Interpreter: Executing non-function".  I also have some problems viewing
pictures (I can't view the pictures in all my AR's).

2.  I like the new layout.  There seems to be a tiny "bug", though:
MultiView thinks that there is more text to read to the right of every
article (the horizontal scrollbar has plenty of space left, to the right).
But when I drag the scrollbar to the right I see just emptyness.  This
"bug" occurs on about every page, even the table-of-contents.  This was not
the case of the former Amiga Report layout.

3. I would love to see some articles about the new programming language,
Amiga-E.  It seems like a very exciting language.  It apparently has most
features of C, but seems much more easy to use and understand.

Finally, keep up the good work!  I still can't understand how you people
can make such a great mag for free...

Best regards,
  _        _

	- As for the installer...I sometimes have problems myself.  We'll fix
	it...eventually.  The side-scroll problem should be fixed this time.
	As for articles on E...anybody want to write one?
	
	- We're not sure how we do it, either.

Subject: Suggest/Request for Amiga Report

Greetz from Darkseid 

This might come as a shock but I'd like to suggest something to you and
all the Amiga Report subscribers/readers/contributors.  Many people out there
in the 'real' world :) will be familiar with Pc's & Macs :( and so will
very probably use Microsoft software in one form or another....:(
Now this aint so bad as it is quite good ;) on occasion, eg Word6 handy
idiot typer corrrector (I need it.....:) ).  Now wouldn't it be nice to
have Microsoft Products for our dearly (departed ;) ) beloved machine
the Amiga, even if it was just AGA +

Now some of you will howl (and prob flame) how dare I suggest such a thing
well, I dare because it makes sense, if we can get the big name software
we can get more attention and sales ie the Amiga doesnt go the way of the
of the atari falcon (he heh heheh ;) ).  What I would request/suggest is 
all Amiga Report'ers would e-mail Bill Gates and pester him as to why he hasnt
produced software for the Amiga (we've had windows for years...) and if
he intends to, if he gets enough mail he'll pay attention..... :)

His E-mail tag is billg@microsoft.com, mail him, but do it nicely NO RUDE
OR IMPLOITE FLAMES< WE WANT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY......

Also Would it be possible to get Him/Microsoft on the conference to answer
questions or a discussion etc ?? How bout it JC ????  

Ah well Id better sign out now, thangyooovermuchh for readin

	- We'll see.  At this point, I doubt MS would blink an eye.  Maybe if
	the new company, when it comes about, puts a positive face on the
	whole thing...

Worldwide News Media Wake-Up Call w/Flowers

Today was the day to send a floral arrangement to your favorite news media
person and request a news investigation of the Commodore situation.  I have
gotten positive feedback from ABC News, again.  Apparently, they think the
Commodore situation would be more suited to Prime Time Live than Turning
Point.

If you sent flowers today and received positive feedback, please let me know
by leaving an e-mail message.  I really appreciate your taking the time,
effort and money to make a positive impact on the news media for the sake of
the Amiga platform.

Martyn Brown, one of Team17's directors, gave some details about Alien
Breed 3D.  A "Doom-esque" game, it will feature the most advanced engine on
the Amiga.  As they admit, this means it won't be the fastest, but it will
feature "Multi-angle-walls, Light-Source[d], 18+ objects on screen,
Optional full screen display, support for HD, Accelerated machines"... it
is not yet completed.

Colin Proudfoot, co-Managing Director of Commodore UK, has declined Amiga
Report's invitations to conferences.  He suggested I contact him again in
two weeks.

CEI will be holding an online conference on IRC in the near future.  It is
slated for November 23, beginning at 4:30 Central US Daylight Savings time.
More information will be available in the next issue of Amiga Report and on
Usenet.  All interested participants should meet in IRC channel #amiga,
where they will be informed by Jason Compton, the moderator, which channel
the conference will be held on.

AS&S have just announced a 64bit Zorro III gfx board, the CyberVision64.
It is based on the Vision864 graphics chip by S3 and allows for a maximum
of 4MB DRAM.  Running with a pixel clock of 135 Mhz, the maximum resolution
is 1280x1024 256 colours at 72Hz.  24bit modes are available up to a
resolution of 800x600.  It has no pass through for the amiga video signal,
but a feature connector for add-ons such as JPEG or MPEG boards.

The only software included so far is a workbench emulator.

The board will be introduced at this years WOC in Cologne and will be
shipping by the end of this year for DM 649.- ($ 406.-) (2MB Version).

MacroSystem are now shipping their Retina boards with the new XIPaint 3.0
Software, which rivals TVPaint's flexibility.  XIPaint is available for
existing Retina users as an update (ca.  $ 40), users of the Picasso II
board can get it for $125.-.  EGS and Amiga AGA versions are planned.

The VLAB Y/C and the Retinas are now shipped with the DigitalImage image
processor.

@node P2-4 "From Across the Pond:  WOC in Cologne"

===========================================================================
==  The Voice from Across the Pond                   By:  @{"Michael Wolf" link P8-3}   ==
==        WOC in Cologne                                                 ==
===========================================================================

Phew, I just got back from the WOC in Cologne, I just installed and tested
my new MultiFace III Board, and I am relaxing with a cup to tea now.  Time
to give you an overview of the show.

Well, the Amiga part of the show was only about one half of a hall, most of
the important german companies where there, mostly selling their stuff.
The other 3/4 of the was dominated by PC games, with the Amiga showing up
every now an then.

The Amiga booths were extremely crowded, there was no way to fall on your
face, as there were simply to many people standing around.  CR Roms were
sold like hot cakes, I also spotted a few people sneaking away with CD 32s.

So, let me give you a brief summary of the new and exciting things on the
show:

The OpalVision Roaster chip/board is finally beeing sold, at a price that
is much higher than excpected (around DM 4000, $2500) , but fair
considering what you get for the money.  Now with the Roaster and LightWave
PAL, who needs a Toaster in Europe ?

The Digital Broadcaster 32 was beeing demoed, alongside a Warp Transputer
System.  The DBC32 seems to be fairly stable now, the image quality is
excellent.

While the WARP System looks quite nice, I could not see it working as it
had just crashed before I arrived.  The specs are very impressive and that
beast is fast.  It basically allows you to load off cpu intensive tasks to
Transputer boards using the Warp OS.  You can add as many boards as you
want to your system, increasing performance proportionally.  The base board
does around 50 Mips and installs in a Zorro slot.  The other boards (Warp
Twin 70 Mips, Warp Tripple 105 Mips) are then connected to the base board.
System comparisons to an Amiga 4000/40 are quite impressive, a render that
took around 1 hour on an A4000/40 took around 50 seconds on a 1000 Mips
Warp system.  A rendering engine for Aladdin 4D is available, others
(Real3D, Lightwave) are to follow.  Software especially written for the
Warp boards is supposed to be beeing developed now.

Helfrich demoed the SD64 64 bit graphics board based on the EGS software, a
tablet driver for Genius tablets (which looks promising, Genius tablets are
very cheap), Scala MM 400, VideoCruncher and the Peggy MPEG board.

The SD64 is a ZorroII/ZorroIII autosensing gfx board with a max pixel clock
of 110Mhz.  It is compatible with the Piccolo, the only main difference is
that it is faster, more expensive and allows for a max of 4MB Ram.

The tablet driver has some nice features, allowing you to put
keyboard/mouse events or ARexx/Dos scripts on any part of the tablet.  The
final version will allow you to load your tablet template as an IFF file
and directly define the areas that cause actions to happen.

Scala MM400 has some new features such as direct VLAB/IV24/Framemaschin
support, loads different file formats (TIFF, BMP, FLI/FLC, PhotoCD, GIF,
PCX and Datatypes), has 5 types of antialiasing and allows you to run
audio/video editing tools directly from Scala.

AS&S were of course demoing the Cyberstorm60/50, which will be available as
soon as Motorola ships the 68060 in quantities.Lightwave rendering times
are very impressive, the TextureExamples scene included with Lighwave takes
3:42 (minutes / seconds) to render on an A4000/40 25Mhz, 1:32 on a
Cyberstorm 40 40 Mhz and 0:54 on a Cyberstorm 60 at 50 Mhz.  AS&S also
plans to release an 060 board running at 80Mhz as soon as the cpus become
available.  The Mips ratings are: A4000/40 15.447, Cyberstorm 40 24.896,
Cyberstorm 60 82.190 (!).  The 060 at 80Mhz is supposed to rate at around
130 Mips.

They also showed their new gfx board, the Cybervision64.  It is a pure
ZorroIII board based on a 64bit chip by S3.  The pixelclock lies around 135
Mhz.  The Workbench emulation seemed to be quite stable, it is rumoured to
be by the same people who did the Picasso emulation.  It also features
planar to chunky conversion hardware (a kind of Akiko I guess, just the
ther way around), which ought to speed up the emulation.  It is available
with 2 and 4 MB and a pass through for the Amiga signal.  A VRam version of
the board is also planned (unconfirmed !)..

AS&S also showed their new range of A1200 turbo boards, which basically
offer the same performance at a lower price.

Now to a goody I discovered at the booth of one of the smaller companies.
It is simply called 32-bit Sequence Processor, and does just that at a list
price of DM 499 ($ 312).  It allows you to composite 24 bit animations
using alpha channels.  It offers fades, layering, colour manipulation and
other operators.  It is not unlike ADPro, but especially made for
animations.  The rendering calculations are performed at a breathtaking
pace due to optimized assembler code.  The system is very easy to use and,
for example, allows you to composite images using spline paths.  This is
the kind of programm I would want to write (because I need it ;-).
Excellent stuff here, let's wait and see if the guy finds a distributor in
the US.

Gee, I've been writing for more than an hour now, time for a cigarette.
Excuse me...

<puff> <puff> <puff>

Back again.

Well, again I went to the MacroSystems booth, wondering whether they would
show a better demo of the VLab-Motion this time.  Well, they did.  The
software is advancing and looks really nice now.  The image qualitiy is
still not up to PAR (excuse the pun), but ought to be enough for industrial
use.  The software will not use the M-JPEG chips for JPEG coding/decoding,
but MS promised to include highly optimized coding algorithms with the next
software update which should cut down thew coding time to around 2 seconds
(on a WarpEngine40).  A file system for the VLab-Motion is out of the
question, said the programmer, because you just can't delete frames in the
middle of a sequence.  He will think about a file system that allows to
write files once only though.  The VLab-Motion Software now also fully
supports the Toccata audio board during editing.  MS also demoed XI-Paint,
which features an OS3.x look on a 24 bit screen and offers some nice
features (image layering for example).

This is line 116 !

What else is there to say ?  I wasn't to inclined to stay on the expo much
longer, it was just too crowded and those PC game players were getting on
my nerves.  Fred Fish was there, giving away autographs.  I'd did ask him
to confirm the rumours that he will be producing an audio CD entitled "Fish
Styx" next, featuring him and other famous Amiga persons on vocals and
instruments.  All he said was: "No comment !".  Knowing how show biz is, I
assume he's got something up his sleeve.  He said he quite enjoys Germany.
He must be familiar with Cologne by now, as he seems to be here every
autumn.

Oh, Imagemaster r/t was on sale, for as low as $112 !  And I didn't buy it,
damn.

Acorn was there as well btw, with a massive booth right in the middle of
the Amiga area.  These Acorn Riscs are nice machines, but if they want
Amiga users to join them (in case something happens), they better get some
decent 2D/3D animation software out.  The next Risc OS will, for example,
allow paralell processing.  You can then basically stack Acorn PC units on
top of each other (they have connectors on the top and bottom), and scale
your system to the cpu power you need.  Maybe D.  Pleasance ought to have a
chat with them if he wins the bid.

Anyhow, 'nuff said.  I'm off to bed, I have to go to Bavaria to school for
the next two weeks ( ...  but I'm taking my Amiga with me ;-)

Good night !

===========================================================================
== AmiTCP 3.0b2: A HowTo                           By: Keith Christopher ==
===========================================================================

     Ok so you're back in school and you dailup the Academic computing
center.  You are riding down the information super highway sitting behind
the cockpit of an amiga, It's unfortunate that you have this masterful
multitasking machine and you are limited to one serial connection.  Oh the
things you could do if you could open more than one win- dow and while that
ftp to the local aminet site that travels obiviously through a 56K line
somewhere has you reading the jolt cola can in your hand was happening you
could be surfing along the internet dropping by all your favorite road side
stops.  My kingdom for a A2065 card and a network connection.  A little
more time goes by and you are reading the 5 empty cans on your desk as you
download the latest bounty you've ftp'd from the aminet archive.  You know
there's something BIG going on in #amiga on the irc server, yet you have to
wait; after all you only have one modem, one serial port, and no network
connection.  Sound familiar ?  No?!  Maybe you are in your basement and you
have di- aled into the local on-ramp to the information super highway, same
situation.  There you are flipping screens between Adpro and Deluxe paint,
you've already drawn your name several hundred times, there has to be more.
Where's that #?S($*# on-ramp brochure.  Hmm, lets see.  .  .  Meanwhile
back at school you have decided that you will now be up all night pumped
with caffiene and need to solve this problem, where did I put the Aca-
demic Computing notes and announcement bulletin ?  Like an Archeologist you
begin to explore the depths of the piles of disks and cables, then you spy
it!  Blowing the dust off reveals a big wad of gun stuck in the middle
covering some bold face type, lets just carefully scrape it off.  .  .  The
only thing missing in this brochure is a bikini clad girl sitting behind a
terminal.  .  .  you open the brochure breaking the little white edge seal,
oh there she is, what's this next to her ?  You begin to read.  .  .  As
the gum comes off you begin sweating as you try not to damage the hidden
informatin below.  Worse yet, it's not even your gum.  Your eyes light up
as you see the message below.  ..  Your mouth slowly mo- tions out the
word.  .  .  SLIP.  .  .  That's it slip!  You dance around a little happy
with your new found information, then when the glow of discovery wears off
you stop and begin thinking.  .  .  Now what.

     While the above may be fictitious I do know one thing for sure, the
end result is the same.  Whether you come on via an on-ramp or have a
connection via work or school, one sure begins to miss the network
connection once at home.  10megabits per second over ethernet makes 1650
CPS via 14.4 dialup pale in comparison.  The ability to connect multipule
times from work leaves one dry at home with a single serial con- nection.
This is where SLIP comes into play, sure there are other protocols and I
will talk about them later, but one of the most common is SLIP.  SLIP
stands for Serial Line Inter- net Protocol.  Basically TCP/IP style
connection over standard serial lines.  While a multi- tude exist for the
various other computers, in my opinion the Amiga has only one hard core
performer.  AmiTCP (current version 3.0.)

     While several programs exist that simulate a SLIP or network
connection, they do not talk IP.  One of the most popular being Dnet by
Matt Dillion of DICE fame.  Dnet brought some tools to the Amiga that were
under development on other platforms, and I still think it has one of the
nicest irc clients available.  (hint hint Matt, write one for AmiTCP !) The
second being AUW.  This program is much easier to install than Dnet but
doesn't have the expanse of the tools as available for dnet.  It does
however, work well.  By far AmiTCP is becoming one of the fastest and most
popular packages available on the Aminet.  Before I begin in the setup and
configuration of AmiTCP, I will first need to explain a few terms I will be
using.  These are necessary to help you as the first timer, or the person
stuck and not sure what to check an idea of how things work and how they
relate to your setup.

Internet Protocol or IP: The protocol used by internet hosts to communicate
with one another in a standard format.

Internet Protocol Address: An address or series of numbers seperated by or
IP address peroids assigned to a machine that "talks" IP which identifies
it to ALL other machines on the internet.  This should be a unique number.
e.g.  129.235.23.1 also known as dot notation.?

Domain Name service or DNS: A service that "resolves" hostnames into its
unique Internet address.  e.g.  If a machine is named amiga.net.com with an
IP address of 129.235.23.1, and one wanted to connect with this machine, I
could telnet to amiga.net.com, IP however, cannot understand this and the
name must be "looked up" to find out it is known to the network as
129.235.23.1 routing Tables that tell a host what "route" to take to send a
message to another host on the network.  i.e.  send it to this machine and
then this machine to this machine until it hits it's destination.  This is
a very critical part of talking on the internet, if the tables are
incorrect the computers may lose the ability to talk to anyother machine
off of their local network.

     Ok now the moment you've been waiting for.  The AmiTCP has lots of
files associated with it, there is the bin or binary archive.  This is the
one that has the main programs in it to get AmiTCP up and running.  There
are many many network programs available for AmiTCP like finger, ping, ftp,
telnet, napsaterm(a vt100 emulator), an irc client, a gopher client.  .  .
the list goes on and more are produced everyday.  This is a very well
supported package.

     The basic installation requires OS 2.04 or better, 1MB of RAM and
approx 2MB of diskspace.

     Upon un-archiving the package and double clicking he drawer icon one
is greeted by a very welcomed sight, an installer icon !

     I do recommend that you unarchive the package in it's final resting
place.  i.e.  Comm:AmiTCP30b2

     This will save alot of time in the installation process.  If there is
an old version of AmiTCP it must be removed first and then install the new
version.

     Once you've figured out where you want to store AmiTCP, double
clicking on the install_AmiTCP icon starts the ball rolling.

     Before doing this however I have assembled a checklist of information
in the order it is requested by the install script.  Hopefully it will help
you streamline your thoughts.  Please look this over and have the
information written down.

1. hostname your computer will be assigned (without the domain):
2. Domain name:
3. Type of connect SLIP or CSLIP:
4. serial.device number (unit number):
    This number is usually 0 unless you have a second serial port.
5. your machines IP address:
6. NetMask:
7. Gateway:
8. Domain Name Server IP and Name: 
9. default router IP address:(same as #7)
10. SLIP dialin number:
11. SLIP login and password:

     Now that you have the information ready lets begin by double clicking
on the Install_AmiTCP icon.  This is a standard installer script so it
should feel fairly familiar, if this is your first time using the installer
script, please read each section carefully and proceed slowly.

     It is another nice to notice the "Help" button, there is alot of
useful information behind each one.  Be sure to check them out.

     Default selection (intermediate [if you were an expert you wouldn't
need this article would you ?] ) Install for real and you decide if you
want to log it all.select the directory you want to install AmiTCP in.  
Selecting the default directory will save you lots of copying time and this
is the main reason I suggest you unarchive it in its final home on your
harddisk.

     Next installer will ask you the name of your host without the domain.
<enter #1 from your list> Installer will ask you for your domain name.
<enter #2 from your list> It will now prompt you to decide if you want to
set any enviroment variables using set- env or envarc, I recommend envarc.
Next it will prompt you for any aliases you wish to use for this hostname.
<hit proceed> The installer will ask you to select a device driver.  
<select from #3 above> (hint : rhslip.device = SLIP and rhcslip.device =
CSLIP.) (If you are unsure about this one select rhslip.device as CSLIP
understands standard SLIP.) You will be prompted for a serial.device
number.  <enter from #4 above> Now you will need to enter your IP address.
<item #5 above> You will be prompted for an address of a "point to point
address" <hit proceed> You will be prompted for a netmask.  <enter iten #6>
(if item #6 is not given simply hit return.)

     Installer will then ask you if the information you've entered is
correct.  <click proceed>

     You will again be prompted to select another SANA-II driver to
configure, click proceed.

     Installer will prompt you for a gateway machine IP address, <enter #7
if available, if not simply slick proceed.> Enter search Domain <enter item
#2 click proceed, when prompted again click proceed> Enter the IP address
of the Domain Name Server (DNS) <enter #8 then click proceed.> If another
name servers IP address is provided by your internet provider you will be
prompted to enter the information.  if not simply click proceed again.  Do
you want AmiTCP to be started at system startup?  Unless you have a FULL
time SLIP connect I suggest you select NO, selecting YES here without a
full time SLIP connection will cause AmiTCP to grab the serial.device and
effectively disable it for other system uses.  In a machine that has only
one serial port, this can be an awful thing.  Do you want the installer to
make the desired changes to you s:user-startup ?  select YES, this save
alot of time editing the file and adding the aliases and a path to your
user-startup.  Do you want the inetd to be started at AmiTCP startup?
Select YES.  This program contains vital information for AmiTCP to access
system re- sources.  The system will tell you you are done and to reboot
your machine.

     So what are you waiting for reboot your machine.  (seriously though
this is a necessary step.  so go ahead and reboot.  be sure and save that
final writer (TM) document; oh!  sorry.)

     Congratulations!  If you've entered the information correctly you are
on the down side of a long battle to install and use AmiTCP.

Where angels fear to tread .  .  .

     This portion is going to get a little tricky and I will outline some
terms and definitions for you.  The startnet script provided with AmiTCP
will not properly start AmiTCP once your're connected.  There is some
editing to be done.  Below is what the default AmiTCP startnet script looks
like:

run AmiTCP:AmiTCP
WaitForPort AMITCP
; configure loop-back device
AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig lo/0 localhost
; Configure Devs:Networks/rhslip.device unit 0
AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig Devs:Networks/rhslip.device/0 128.220.62.50
; Add route to this host
AmiTCP:bin/route add slip.welch.jhu.edu localhost
Assign TCP: Exists > NIL:
IF Warn
  Mount TCP: from AmiTCP:devs/Inet-Mountlist
EndIf
; Start the internet `super server'
run AmiTCP:bin/inetd

     The problem lies with several lines in the script.  We will edit this
file with a normal text editor like Ed or Textra.  Lets begin editing the
file.

 The first being the following line:

AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig lo/0 localhost

     The device lo/0 does not exist in the INTERFACES file in the AmiTCP:db
directory.  This file lists all available devices for use with AmiTCP.
While one can edit this file to reflect the changes needed it is much
easier to edit the startnet file in AmiTCP:bin.  Since there are other
changes that will need to be made as well.

     The devices are listed in the interfaces file as:

lo dev=amitcp:devs/networks/rhslip.device
slip dev=devs:networks/rhslip.device

     So we will change the line :

AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig lo/0 localhost

     To read:
AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig slip0

     and add a line that says:

AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig lo0

     This basically configures the system to use device slip and lo at port
0 and get the information needed to configure the devices from the
interfaces file.  The device slip0 is the outgoing or the external network
port.  lo0 is the local or loopback port.  (This allows one to call one's
machine from itself.  i.e.  telnet from your machine to your machine.)

     The next line that needs editing it a little more obscure than the
previous line(s) we edited/added.  This is the line:

AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig Devs:Networks/rhslip.device/0 128.220.62.50

     This line further configures the port slip0 with several identifiers,
your IP address, the IP address of the gateway machine (if there is one)
and the netmask.  This is configured by default from the information
entered in the installer script.  This situation will not work mainly
because the syntax is wrong, it should look something like this.

AmiTCP:bin/ifconfig slip0 128.220.67.50 128.220.67.180 netmask 255.255.0.0

     The line "reads" as follows: call program ifconfig to define network
device slip0 with the IP address of 128.220.67.50 and a gateway address of
128.220.67.180 and a network mask of 255.255.0.0.  (default Class C)

     The next line, route to this host is ok as configured.  I did not need
to edit it.  We will however need to add a default network if we want to go
out and explore the world.  (we have to know the route to get there.) Note:
If you entered a default gateway this line should be correct if not,
continue on.

     Most on-ramps and schools use the first IP address in its class for
all routing, this is typically ending in 0 (zero.) in the above example the
router is 128.220.67.0, well to enable our path to reach out through there
we need to let it know that's the way to go, we do this be adding the
following lines to the startnet script just below the slip0 configuration
line above.  The lines read (one of them being a comment line):

; Add route to the default gateway
AmiTCP:bin/route add default 128.220.67.0

     The router's IP address is listed in your list of 11 prerequistes
under item #9.  The line beginning with a ";" is the comment line, this is
not read by the system.  The line "reads" pretty straight forward: call the
route program and let me default route (unless otherwise specified) be
128.220.67.0.  i.e.  send my packets that go out of my local do- main to
this device so it may forward them to the recipient machine.  The rest of
the file can be left alone it is fine as it is.  Double check your entries
and save your file.

Back on high ground.

     Now that you've installed and configured the heart of AmiTCP, will
will need to check/tweek some other files.  These can be found in AmiTCP:db
and are called hosts and netdb.  These files hold some important network
information to allow us to talk to other hosts once connected. 

     The hosts file contains system IP addresses and names, as well as any
aliases you may wish to add.  for example, our DNS machine is called
dns.net.com and has an IP address of 128.220.67.13., to type out
dns.net.com or the IP address will usually take alot of typing depending on
the hostname.  (wait until you see some of the German host- names!) The
hosts file also allows one to assign an alias or shortcut to the name.  I
could simply type telnet dns in lieu of typing telnet dns.net.com.  The
entries are as fol- lows:

IP address      HOSTNAME                alias
128.220.67.13   dns.net.com             dns

     This says to the system the IP address is assigned to the hostname and
can be address by the alias.  There should be an entry in this file for the
local host DO NOT remove this entry.  The hosts file can also speed up
accessing other systems.  The system will first try to resolve the hostname
into an IP address by looking in the hosts table to see if it exists, if it
finds it, it will stop trying to resolve and grab the information provided
and make the connection.  If it does not exist in the hosts file the system
then looks to the netdb file for a listing of name servers.  The netdb file
should look something like the fol- lowing:

; This host
HOST 128.220.67.50 slip.welch.jhu.edu slip
; Domain names
DOMAIN welch.jhu.edu
; Name servers
NAMESERVER 128.220.67.13
NAMESERVER 128.220.67.78
WITH protocols PREFIX=P
WITH services PREFIX=S

     The information is fairly straight forward, first listing the local
host machine, next listing the domain and then thirdly listing the
nameservers.  This is how AmiTCP knows which host to ask to resolve names
intto IP addresses from.  The last lines are add per the
Amitcp:db/protocols file and the services file:

; protocols -- the protocol database file for AmiTCP/IP
; This file shouls be included from netdb-file with following line:
; WITH protocols PREFIX=P

; services -- the services database file for AmiTCP/IP
; This file shouls be included from netdb-file with following line:
; WITH services PREFIX=S

      Now that everything has been checked out and is set lets make a
connection.

All setup and nowhere to go.

      OK, all we need to do now is dialin and start AmiTCP for a SLIP
connection!  There are only a few steps involved in this and they are
fairly straight forward.  I will be referring to Term 4 by Olaf Barthel as
my choice of terminal programs.  Terminus will also work well with this
configuration.  Napsaterm, the vt100 emulator packaged with AmiTCP, can
also be used to dialin with; I have not tried this however.

1) Run the terminal program of choice by double clicking its icon.
2) Dial the internet service provider using the number listed in item #10
3) Once connected enter the login and password.

     NOTE: Some slip setups only require a loginID and password, SLIP
starts automatically.  However there are others that require a command to
be typed from the prompt, i.e.  SLIP,slip .  .  .  Check with your internet
provider to find out how it is invoked on their host.

4) Once SLIP has been started on the host (either auto or manual), select
release serial device from the menu or Iconify or quit the program while
still online.  The latter being a much sloppier way of freeing the
serial.device.  The serial.device MUST be freed to start AmiTCP!  If you
are using Terminus for instance issuing AT&D0 before dialing will allow the
modem to stay online after the terminal program is exited.  (I added this
to my startup init string.)

5) Once the serial.device is freed, open a cli and type:
"AmiTCP:bin/startnet" (without the quotes.  The path should be set in
S:user-startup but I always type paths out for some reason.  In other words
typing startnet from the CLI will also work.)

You should see something like the following:

4.Comm:AmiTcp3/bin> startnet
[CLI 1]
slip0: flags=b0<POINTOPOINT,NOTRAILERS,NOARP>
lo0: flags=8<LOOPBACK>
add net default: gateway 128.220.67.0
[CLI 5]
4.Comm:AmiTcp3/bin> 

     This signifies that AmiTCP has started successfully.  If for some
reason it did not start successfully then it will open a CLI window at the
top of the screen and display an erro message.

     That's it!  now you're connected !  The world is your oyster, all you
need to do is know where to go and what to use and how to use it.  Well
I'll be covering that in my next few articles, there's lots of things to do
with AmiTCP, this is just the tip of a VERY large ice- berg.  You are now
running one of the hottest programs available on the internet !

     Check out my sidebar titled Now What?  It should give you an idea of
things to do and places to go to begin checking out the internet.  Happy
surfing, !

     Upon validating my "HOW TO" guide I was informed by the AmiTCP team
that the next release of AmiTCP will circumvent most of the editing and
headaches involved with installing and setup of version 3.0x AmiTCP.  I was
also informed that the next version will be released as commercial.  While
this may be upsetting to some who have enjoyed the freedom of getting this
software and running it with reckless abandon they seem to forget that
there is a team of people putting hard work behind this software (as with
all other shareware.) The tenative cost will be 99$ and offer preorder
discounts and Student pricing.  (I hope they come up with a cool logo and
disk label.) If you use it now it looks like the commercial version will
only be better, I do recommed supporting them, since C=`s TCP/IP stack was
dead after its release due to no support/updates.  (Keith stepping down
from his soapbox.)

   equipment.  Void warranties and read the owners manual for additional
   instructions.

REVIEW

   I've found as of late that the Commodore 1960,1942 series monitors in
   new condition are not to be found.  My 1960's case was not very well
   constructed, but after using the CD-1401, I think I found the perfect
   replacement, or upgrade, for a 1084 or similar models.

   I happen to live in the same city in which the CD Solutions's office is
   located, so I called and arranged an interview with Mr.Millich, the
   president of CD Solutions.  When I walked into his office, the first 
   thing I saw was a A1200HD connected to a CD-1401.

   After about twenty minutes of talking to Mr.Millich, I came to the 
   conclusion that he was very knowledgeable in the current events with the
   Amiga and that he knew the situation should be wrapping up shortly,
   as we all hope.

   Mr.Millich talked about his company and its continued support for the
   Amiga platform.  As we know, others have put things on hold until the
   dust settles.  Mr.Millich has great faith that the Amiga will continue,
   and with support and proper marketing, he expects its user base to
   expand.  I was suprised to also find out that his company uses A1200's
   to perform diagnostic and final acceptance tests on all of the monitors
   leaving his manufacturing facility in southern California.  After we
   chatted for a bit, he agreed to let me use a CD-1404 to test, and write
   this Review.

   Mr.Millich enlightened me on the proper handling of a monitor. During
   packing, unpacking and transportation, a monitor should never be allowed
   to have the screen face upwards.  This would allow dust from the screen
   to fall down and come to rest on the monitor's other components and
   possibly cause damage to it.  I learned something I never thought of
   before, this is also true with a television.  Mr.Millich also works in
   sales and engineering.

   The first thing I noticed was a very crisp screen display and the lack
   of slight jittering my 1960 gave me.  The display on the CD1401 is
   solid, and less straining on my eyes, extending the time I can spend
   using my A1200.  I also put the CD-1401 through all the screen modes my
   A1200 has and found that the ease of adjusting the borders and lack of
   black borders on most modes very appealing, as with my 1960,I have
   always had problems getting the adjustments made to my satisfaction.
   To be honest I could never get the productivity mode to center correctly
   and to be of any use to me with my 1960, with the CD-1401 I made the
   adjustments easly and used the productivity mode extensively during my
   tests of this monitor, also utilizing the A1200's mode promotion
   feature.  The edge to edge display capability is a great feature.  I ran
   demos,games and animations and all the productivity software I have and
   was impressed with the monitor's display of everything I used with it.

   The monitor is basicly the same size as the 1960,and is simular in
   looks.  Another appealing feature is that all the manual control knobs
   are located under the bottom of the front panel- nicely hidden,but
   easily accessable.  The swivel base is easly moved and has more of a
   upward swing to adjust the screen display angle than the Commodore 1960.
   The power switch is a push type, located on the lower right front, with
   the power lamp built into it.  It lacked the pop-open door the 1960 has,
   with the thin adjustment knobs hidden inside.  It appears to be very
   well contructed.

DOCUMENTATION
   17 page owners manual and warranty card is inclosed

LIKES
   lack of black borders, edge to edge display, location of manual control
   knobs, ease of adjustments.

DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS
   There is really nothing to dislike about this monitor though a few
   people I spoke with stated it would be nice to have composite-video
   input, and of course 17 and 20 inch models

COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS
   As I stated in the above review,the CD-1401 is very similar in
   appearance to the Commodore 1960, but that's about all.  The overall
   performance and the monitor specs. are better than the Commodore 1960 in
   almost all areas, considering they are priced comparitivly, if you can
   even find a new 1960 these days.

BUGS
   none found during my 10 day evaluation period

VENDOR SUPPORT
   CD Solutions has a Phone and FAX lines and appear to very conerned about
   the Amiga platform.  I never needed to call for assistance, but from
   earlier conversations I believe if assistance is needed, CD Solutions is
   only a Phone call away.

WARRANTY
        There is a one year warranty.

CONCLUSIONS
   During my 10 day evaluation period, I really enjoyed using the CD-1401,
   and hated to return it back to CD Solutions and Mr.Millich.

   When the time comes for the need of a second monitor,or if my 1960 dies,
   the CD-1401 would be ideal, and I would recommend it as a monitor to
   look into as a replacement or upgrade, in this price range of monitors.
   One last point of interest, the CD-1401 is a multi-platform monitor, it
   can be used with IBM PC, Mac, and Nec9800 series computers according to
   CD Solutions.

@node P3-2 "Review:  CyberStorm"

===========================================================================
==  Review:  CyberStorm                              By:  @{"Michael Wolf" link P8-3}   ==
===========================================================================

Here I am again, back with a review of the long awaited Cyberstorm and some
news.  The Cyberstorm I tested is one that I had ordered for a client of
mine.

The Cyberstorm 40/40 was shipped in a neat black box, which contains the
Cyberstorm Carrier board, the RAM board, the CPU board, a sheet of
cardboard and a preliminary handbook (note: this ought to have changed by
now).

Installation
------------

The CS is quite easy to install.  Just replace the Amiga CPU board with the
Carrier board, add the CPU and the RAM board, stir slightly and switch on
the machine.  On an A4000/40 it may be necessary to set two jumpers.  The
sheet of cardboard isolates the RAM board from the Amiga Zorro III daughter
board.  Once installed the board ought to look like this:

      ______________
      |            |       connector for optional second level cache
      |  RAM       |      _|______     
      |            |_____/ |     /__
     /|____________|   //<-|    /  /
    /                 //  CPU  ////<-- connector for optional I/O board
   / Carrier board    /_______////
  /_________________________|/__/
          | A4k CPU Slot  |


Actually, it shouldn't look that bad, but I hope you get the idea.  The CS
is quite big once assembled completely, It fills out just about all of the
space left in the A4k.

The preliminary hand book explains the installation quite well (alas in
German), but there isn't much you can do wrong anyhow.

The boards
----------

The Carrier board is the backbone of the system.  It is populated by a few
IC's and the connectors for the various add-ons.

The CPU board is a bit larger than the 040 CPU.  There is an oscillator and
a few IC's on it, the 040 is cooled by a fan.

The RAM board just features 4 SIMM sockets and lots of jumpers.  You can
add every kind of 32 bit SIMM starting at 4MB up to 32MB, with or without
parity.  Every combination of SIMMs possible is allowed, just use the right
jumper settings.  The SIMMs ought to be at least 70ns fast, but the
performance you get out of these (see benchmarks) of up to 50MB/sec makes
me wonder why GVP for example insists on using those expensive custom
SIMMs.

All boards a manufactured using SMD, and look extremely professional.

Optional add-on's
-----------------

AS&S intend to release a number of add-on modules for the CS.  Due to be
released soon is the SCSI board and the I/O board.  The SCSI board just
features a Fast-SCSI host adapter, which is in fact identical to the
Fastlane Z3.  The I/O board features the SCSI host adapter, ethernet and a
fast serial port.

Not available yet is the second level cache module, that should provide for
a further burst in performance.

Also not yet available is the 68060/50 processor board, which will be
released once 68060s become available in quantity.

likes/disklikes
---------------

Well, the board performes as excpected, the RAM performance is excellent
and the modularity of the whole system allows you to get just the
components you need.

The Cyberstorm is quite cheap for what it does, the fact that you can use
standard 32bit SIMMS makes the board even more cost effective.

The manual could me more detailed (I only got a preliminary version), and
the cardboard sheet as an isolation separator is a bit cheap.

Also, due to the size of the complete board, you can't use it in an A3000
(It may fit in an A3000T...).  Especially the RAM board takes a lot of
space beacause it is mounted vertically.

Benchmarks
----------

I performed the following benchmarks on the Cyberstorm40/40, on a standard
A4000 Pal, with an 8MB 70ns SIMM on the Cyberstorm and 2 MB Fast on the
A4000 Motherboard.

===========================================================================
==  Review:  Arcade Pool CD32                       By:  @{"Jason Compton" link P8-1}   ==
===========================================================================

What doth make a CD32 game great?

There's obviously more than one answer to that question.  Personally, while
I find direct-from-disk shovelware offerings a bit offensive, it doesn't
immediately ruin my enjoyment of the game.  Storage-intensive games like
Microcosm can certainly be enjoyable, but sometimes the best are regular
games with just the right usage of CD advantages.

MicroProse has done a decent job with their CD32 offerings.  So, now, does
Team17 with Arcade Pool.

At its heart is a terrific playable pool simulation.  But the real
attraction, at least for a time, is the "Pubmosphere" CD tracks on
disk...about 7 or so minutes of...well, pubs.  The recording is
terrific...it really sounds, at least to the rest of the world, like you've
got a bunch of glasses clinking and people talking.

They clink and talk, or play pool, or blues, while the Arcade Pool is
played.  Certainly, it's not as good as being there, but it gives it the
extra kick that rounds Arcade Pool out into a great game.

Of course I'll tell you how the game itself plays.  The table itself is a
top-down affair with what at least look like oversized billiards.  You take
aim by pressing the red button on your destination and using the pad
buttons to control power and "english".  Aiming guides range from detailed
outlines of the cue ball's trajectory to nothing.  When you're satisfied,
the blue button executes the shot.  If you like, a mouse can perform all of
the above, but it's not particularly necessary.

The game itself supports a wide range of pool rules, including customizable
8 ball with most of the major issues people fight about in 8-ball
selectable by the players.  Other games are 9-ball, US 8/15 ball, Survivor,
and single-player options 9-Ball Challenge and Speed Pool.  Trickshot will
help you hone your skills.

You'll need them in case you actually are foolish enough to take on the
computer.  There are only two "difficulty" levels, Rookie and Pro, but I
haven't noticed much of a difference.  The computer players make incredible
shots...repeatedly.  Let's just say that if you're not in good shape early
on, you may as well treat it as a learning experience.

Despite its PAL requirement, the game purports to be fully AGA compatible
on all systems, even going to the length to tell you your system
configuration.  Quite nice of them, and another reason I like the game. 
(CD32 FastRAM just allows the computer player to figure out how to make
incredible shots a bit quicker, I think.)

The game has a fairly gentle learning curve, but you'll be frustrated the
first few games, and Team17 has decided to minimize cost by making all
manuals online.  It's a bit frustrating, too, because while within Arcade
Pool you can look up the implementation of pool rules in the game, you must
read the technical aspects (press this button to do this, etc.) from a
preboot menu.  Score one for budget, minus one for convenience.

But if you want a good sport simulation on the CD32 and are bored already
with Brutal Sports Football (how could you be??) give Arcade Pool some
serious thought.

===========================================================================
==  Review:  Super Stardust AGA                     By:  @{"Jason Compton" link P8-1}   ==
===========================================================================

Did you think you had hit the height of Stardustdom?  Enter Super Stardust.
You'll be pleased.

Super Stardust AGA is a high quality, high class project.  For those of you
unfamiliar with the game, it is the 90's Asteroids.  Wonderful high-detail
rendered asteroids with beautiful backdrops, one big (TOO big for the job,
if you ask me) ship flying around trying to blow them all up.  In the
meantime, enemy ships drop by and try to kill you in innovative ways, like
dropping bombs, shooting fire at you, or cloaking and becoming invincible,
flying around, then decloaking just long enough to shoot a rocket at you. 
If you're particularly lucky, the power-ups you get from the asteroids will
keep you alive, and the weapons you can steal from destroyed transports
will keep you fighting.  After 6 repetitions, a huge imposing ship with
lovely graphics and nasty weapons tries to kill you.  After that, you're
dropped into a tunnel, where the asteroids zoom by you at high speeds in 3d
while you shoot them and avoid mines.

Don't worry about the plot.  It's silly.  An evil professor kidnaps the
same princess he kidnapped in Stardust and wants to destroy everybody else.
But it does make for a good Star Warsian scrolling intro text, (whose
quality outshines that of X-Wing's attempt...)

There's really not much else to say.  The game is visually stunning.  Were
I a British reviewer, I might go so far as to say it's gobsmacking.  But in
any lingo, the game is incredibly beautiful to behold.  As far as
playability goes, it is a bit difficult to coordinate weapon changes, as it
requires pausing the game with the spacebar, making the changes, and
resuming...but dropping a hand from your controller to hit the spacebar is
a lot to ask for.  Things can happen so fast in the game...

Speaking of control systems: it IS worth pointing out that there is a CD32
version of this game available.  Team17 only sent me the AGA version, but
the manual covers both, and indicates that the CD32 control system for
switching weapons is far superior.  However, for some reason, it wasn't
implemented on the AGA floppy version.  Now, I understand that there's no
real reason to play the floppy version on a CD32 with the CD32 pad, but as
we move into the 3.1 age, CD32 controllers CAN be a reality for AGA
machines.  Strange shortsightedness.  I mean, it wouldn't have hurt to
allow for it...

The game isn't, of course, a direct rehash of Asteroids.  The concept of
depletable ship energy (drained by collisions) and a shield (limited usage,
of course) come into play, and the old "hyperspace" escape is gone.  The
aforementioned graphics are a far cry from the black and white wireframe of
long ago, and the sound is terrific...even from floppy, the musical tracks
are mixed cleverly with the sound effects and strange voice which informs
you of which power-up you've obtained, in case you were too busy watching
the 6 small asteroids hurtling at you to notice.  When the game is done,
you're presented with a detailed summary of your gameplay, and an insulting
one-line ranking.  (Well, let's just say it's insulting below the
pre-programmed high score.)

While it's PAL-only, it's at least nice enough to boot directly to it
without any user intervention.  If you like, the 5-disk extravaganza can be
installed to hard drive.  It requires a reboot of the system to play from
HD, however, and we were unable to play from HD on our 4000/040.  (it works
just fine from floppy, however.) A password system exists, but it's a bit
harsh...the passwords place you BEFORE tunnel sequences, meaning you have
to survive them and complete the entire 6-screen world each time you
replay.

Speed difference is undetectable between the CD32/Fastram and 4000/040.

My feelings about Super Stardust can be summed up as follows: Take a CD32
or 1200HD, put it in a stand-up console, wire up a sturdy arcade-style
controller, and stick it in an arcade, coin box and all.  It's really that
good, and it's really that playable.

===========================================================================
==  Emulation Rambler:  CrossMAC/MaxDOS             By:  @{"Jason Compton" link P8-1}   ==
===========================================================================

It feels good to ramble once more.

On my agenda lately have been the two Macintosh filesystems, MaxDOS 2.0
from Media4 Productions and CrossMAC from Consultron.  In a way, it's a
battle of new vs.  old...Media4, while not strangers to software
development or the Amiga, are making their first attempt at a commerical
product.  Consultron, on the other hand, is responsible for essentially
defining MS-DOS filesystems for the Amiga...you know them well if you own
CrossDOS or Workbench 2.1 and above.

The goal of both programs is the same: to provide
as-transparent-as-possible access to Macintosh floppies, hard drives, and
A-Max/Emplant hybrids for AmigaDOS.  The requirements are a decent
graphical interface to get to where you want (Macintosh devices mounted as
AmigaDOS device), and, most importantly, functionality.

Let's cut right to the chase.  Both MaxDOS and CrossMAC do the job.  I
have no major complaints about their primary operation.

There.  Done.  I can stop now, right?

Well, ok, I'll tell you what the differences are.

Mounting the Mac stuff:

CrossMAC and MaxDOS get your devices mounted in fairly similar ways.  A
graphical interface asks you to select a drive, then a partition.  MaxDOS
requires you to know a bit more than CrossMAC does about your system (the
unit number of your SCSI hard drive, but it's a number between 0 and 6, so
you can only be wrong so many times...) but they both get the job done.
Another primary difference is that while MaxDOS will automatically
generate a mountlist entry to your specification, CrossMAC will go so far
as to automatically place the device in your user-startup.

Reading the data...or is it the resource?

Mac files are stored in two parts: a "data" fork and a "resource" fork.
If you'd like the technical explanation, check out the program manuals.
In short, one tells the Mac what the program's all about and the other
tells it what to do with it.  The system, in short, is responsible for the
reason you can double-click on virtually anything on a Mac and get a
program to pop up...or, the flip side of the coin, the reason it's so hard
to do something with a file if it DOESN'T make a program pop up...

Anyway: Both programs need some way to represent this on the Amiga, so
they show them as two separate files.  MaxDOS calls the resource fork for
the file "blah" as "blah" with a superscript 2 after it.  (Yes, I know I
can type alt-2 but I'd like to ensure that readers everywhere get the
drift.)  CrossMAC calls it blah.rs.  Either way, you get the point.
You'll primarily be interested in the data fork, but more about that
later.

Floppy, floppy, floppy...

It's interesting to note that MaxDOS needs Consultron's mfm.device to read
high density floppies.  (If you've got CrossDOS or Workbench 2.1 and
above, you've got mfm.device.  If not, you'll need to get it from
Consultron.)  MaxDOS can also handle all makes of Amax and Emplant
floppies.  CrossMAC, not to be outdone, also goes to the length of
allowing the use of A-Max hardware (I/II or II+/IV) to read low density
Mac floppies: either of the external drive type for A-Max I/II or the
shared-drive type for II+/IV.  Again, both do the job.

...But, I could care less about the resource fork!

Not surprising.  MaxDOS allows you to filter out data or resource forks or
just show both by commodity control.  I was unable to find such a feature
on CrossMAC.

How does this all look, anyway?

Both programs incarnate their disks as Workbench icons, which open into
standard windows, and so it goes.  CrossMAC will show all files, unless
hidden (another trick of the Mac operating system which can be
circumvented with these programs) as icons: either data icons, resource
icons, or their own 2-color icons taken straight from the Mac if they're
applications.  This is where some of CrossMAC's extras come into play, but
I'll get to those in a second.  With MaxDOS 2.0, there will be no icons,
so a "Show All" is prudent.  However, with MaxDOS 2.1, arriving "any day
now", the Mac icons will be displayed.

CrossMAC's extras: Not for the squeamish.

Consultron has included some goodies in their program that MaxDOS doesn't
counter.  Their usefulness...well, it'll vary on a case-by-case basis.

The first is VHex, a simple hexadecimal-code viewer which all Mac drive
data files default to.  (i.e., double-click on a Mac data file and you'll
get VHex.)  It's fairly primitive, nothing that DirWork doesn't do, but it
is nice to have as a default tool.

The second is Res_Extractor.  Remember what I said about resource forks?
This will allow you to pull those bits of code that tell the Mac what to
do out of the resource forks and look at them.  It's neat, even if you
don't understand it.

The next is Mac_File_Salv.  Not having any corrupted Mac disks, I wasn't
able to test it, but this program purports to try to save damaged files
from damaged disks.  Nice to know.

File_Type_Manager should be used only by astoundingly confident people.
It will, essentially, allow you to tell what was previously a MS-Word
document that it's now a font.  Of course, it won't WORK, but you can do
it.  A huge database of possible filetypes comes with, and you can change
them.

All of these are certainly nice to have, and don't hinder CrossMAC by any
means.  But they're also not necessary, and can be done with more
confidence on a true Mac.

So, what's the point, Jason?

The point is that both of these programs work.  CrossMAC is the more
polished of the two, but it's also got a $20 higher pricetag.
Functionally, they're indistinguishable.  My feelings at the end are
mixed.  The products are quality, and I recommend that if you need one,
you check prices and what functions you want and make your decision.  But
at suggested prices of $150 for CrossMAC and $130 for MaxDOS, you may also
want to give some thought to just going whole-hog and buying an Emplant.
It's considerably more expensive: about $330 will get you the deluxe
version, and then you need to dig up ROMs and System software, but you
also get the Mac programs themselves, not just file portability.

The choice, as always, is up to you.  These programs would make terrific
Amiga pack-ins, and I hope both Consultron and Media4 pursue that
possibility when this damned buyout is over with.

       the zeros or the area between functions to name only three of
       the many facilities. Moreover, the design of the graphs can be
       changed in many ways. You also can place text, points, etc. in
       the windows or hatch an area. Tables, lists and legends can be
       created as well.

       The layout Mode contains a small but complete DTP Program with
       full WYSIWYG and Intellifont support! It allows you to lay out
       a page with function-graphs, tables, lists, legends, text blocks,
       etc. Moreover, it knows formulas which no program apart form TeX
       was able to display or print up to now! The page can be printed
       in highest printer resolution!

The following is a compilation of the IRC Jcompton Scrubber Purchase
conference held on 10-27-94 (CST).  The content has been edited, removing
non-conference material.  The messages regarding the subject of the
conferences remain intact and unedited except for format to make reading
easier.

Thanks to Kosh, aka Robert Fentiman, for starting the whole thing.

[ Some intitial argument about who rightfully gets the Scrubber ]

<jcompton> I was the first one to make the floor scrubber famous.  Hence, I
           get it.

* Wolverine wants jason to clean my toliet w/ the scrubber

<jcompton> Wolverine: I don't do the scrubbing, I just own the merchandise.

<Kosh> Do you rent?

<jcompton> Kosh: Well, initial floor scrubbing policy will focus on the
           markets we've done well in in the past.  We'd be willing to
           license the floor scrubber policy to distributors in other
           countries, though.

<Kosh> What sort of hardware are we looking at?  Basic model, or one with
       lots of extras?

<jcompton> Kosh: We can't forget the low-end mop market that's been the
           mainstay, but our high-end users would be disappointed if we
           discontinued our more expandable floor scrubbing models.

<Kosh> What about marketing?  - I hope you plan to market it better than C=
       did...

<jcompton> Kosh: No question.  Commodore was too proprietary with their
           floor scrubber.  We're seriously considering a completely
           Open-Soap policy.

<Kosh> Do you see the Scrubber taking a lead over the compeditors, and can
       you talk about any proposed advancements?  And what do you plan on
       calling the new Scrubber company?

<jcompton> Kosh: We may not be able to beat the clone scrubber companies
           right away, but we're going to aggressively market not only in
           magazines but with competitive profit-sharing programs with
           janitorial supply distributors.

<jcompton> Kosh: Most of the improvements are contingent on developing a
           new OS for the GBR (Gobsmacking Battery Recharge) chipset we
           plan to implement for our next-generation scrubbers.

<jcompton> Kosh: The name isn't finalized yet, but we're considering
           Scrubber International or Scrubbing Technologies, Ltd.

<Kosh> Do you plan on limiting market to C='s strongest ones (IE, the UK)
       or do you plan immediate worldwide exposure?

<jcompton> Kosh: As I stated earlier, we feel we need to focus first on the
           markets we've done best in, but we certainly can't rule out any,
           either.

<Kosh> Won't other markets feel ignored, and what do you propose to do to
       ensure a future in the weaker markets before the "clones" take them
       for good?

<jcompton> Kosh: Marketing, marketing, marketing.  We plan to show the
           public the areas where our scrubbers excel.  We've got snapshots
           of 14,000 car dealership floors ready to go to print as soon as
           the buyout is successful.

<Kosh> Are you able to tell the IRC readers out there anything about the if
       any), or are they silent partners?

<jcompton> kosh: They are silent partners.  All I can tell you is that one
           of them is a major detergent manufacturer.

<Kosh> Where do you plan to have your factory and management based, and how
       soon can we expect the product line to start up again?

<jcompton> Kosh: Manufacturing agreements are tentatively set in Iowa and
           Hungary.  We feel that the locations will be optimal for
           distributing our product.  We hope to have new models available
           for Valentine's Day.

<jcompton> The ad guys have a tentative slogan for the new releases..."Take
           your honey for a spin and scrub." It's still rough, but
           workable.

<jcompton> We're also giving serious thought to painting Amy the Squirrel
           on both sides of the new models, but Schwartz hasn't returned
           our calls yet.

<Kosh> Is there anything you wish to say to the IRC readers out there
       before the interview is done?

<jcompton> Kosh: Sure.  We're ready to do whatever it takes to ensure the
           future of the floor scrubber.  It's been a bumpy ride, but with
           everyone's help, we can have a terrific future.

[Moderator interjection] It's the IRC/Jcompton conference on the Floor
                         Scrubber Purchase... please type ? to ask a 
                         question

<c0w> Do you plan on sticking with the GGG series of motor contruction, or
      not?

<jcompton> c0w: GGG is a technology that we feel, at this point, won't be
           enough to combat the competition's offerings.  But if we can get
           it to market quickly and cheaply, it may have a future as the
           mid-end machine we've always lacked.

<Kosh> Well I thank you for the very informative interview.  Are you able
       to stick around for some questions presented by some guests?

<c0w> j: yes, but if we get rid of GGG thewnn will the alternative be
      downwardly compatible with the older detergents?

<jcompton> c0w: It's likely that floor scrubber users will need some major
           retooling of their scrubbing habits and patterns.

<harv> jason what the hell is it with you and floor scrubbers.  you're
       getting compulsive about this.  we may have to send you for
       professional help

<jcompton> harv: I'm establishing a legend.  Or at least, trying very hard.
           Actually, this whole thing wasn't my idea.

<c0w> j: what type of dome light will be used on the new models?

<jcompton> c0w: It's too early to think about that sort of thing.  It'll be
           up to the design team.

<harv> jason be sure to see invasion of the body snatchers, early 80s
       re-make.  excellent floorscrubber scene in it

<jcompton> harv: Hehehe...right now I'm just enjoying the brief glimpse
           Haynie gets of it in Deathbed Vigil.

<harv> hmm.. i gotta get that tape

<c0w> j: Yes, but this is very urgent!!  Will it even BE a floor scrubber
      if it uses some new weird type of detergent?

<jcompton> c0w: We're not going to change the things that have made our
floor scrubbers great in the past.

<c0w> j: Thank goodness!

<Kosh> The scrubber "clones" seem to work on the basis that "faster is
       better"...  do you plan to adopt this philosophy, or continue the
       multi co-scrubber design?

<jcompton> Kosh: We can't rule out allowing users of other floor scrubbers
           to feel at home on ours, but at the same time, we have to keep
           up the sort of things that make us stand out.

<c0w> j: I feel that speed is overrated, if we use multiple brushes then we
      will get much higher performance than a very fast model that uses a
      single brush.

<jcompton> c0w: The brushes will continue to work in tandem.  We're even
           working on making all of them animated.

<c0w> j: what about rtd (re-targetable detergent)?

<jcompton> c0w: RTD is one of our top priorities.  We have to stop
           punishing users for using high-end detergents.

<Kosh> Are you offering a better support line for 3rd party developers and
       dealers?

<jcompton> Kosh: Of course.  Accessories are what really make the machine.

<Kosh> And what about owners of older Scrubbers that want to upgrade?

<jcompton> Kosh: We'll have to keep a competitive upgrade plan in order to
           keep existing users happy.

==========================================================================
==                         Amiga Report Contest!                        ==
==========================================================================

    - THE PRIZE FOR NEXT MONTH -

CONTEST BEGINS: 9-13-94
CONTEST ENDS: 11-21-94

The Amiga Report contest is still going on, and it is not too late to
enter.  This ongoing monthly contest allows Amiga Report readers a chance
to win software by either solving a puzzle or by entering a random drawing.

The prize this month is the Amiga/Toaster Reference Manual v2.221, from
Area52.  This is a 1,000 page help system for the Amiga and Video Toaster,
covering the Workbench, AmigaDOS, Lightwave, and more ($34.95).

The second prize choice is the FutureShock audio CDROM, which was produced
using Amiga computers by SideWinder.  There are some Sidewinder music
modules on Aminet that you may want to look at for a sample of the audio CD
($12.95).

Another possible prize is SubVersion, a strategy submarine hunt game by
Point of View Computing.  Both a Mac and IBM version is included along with
the Amiga version.

FOCUS GbR has made available graphicRECALL, its interactive multimedia
database.  Designed for catagorizing and accessing large databases of
images, texture maps, anims, and audio.

Walnut Creek has also dontated 5 copies of the AMINET CD-ROM, which
contains approximately 4000 files from the AMINET FTP sites.

Previously we have offered the ARexx Reference Disk by Merrill Callaway,
which was awarded to a previous winner.  Contact Whitestone for more
information (505) 268-0678.  More prizes will be announced as they become
available.

All monthly contests end on the dates listed above.  Any entries beyond
this date will be entered into the next contest.  In the event that you
were announced as a winner and did not receive your prize, please contact
me by email.

- THE MONTHLY DRAWING -

To enter the random drawing, select a number from 1 to 262,144 and send it
to me at one of my addresses listed below, either by the postal service or
email through the Internet.  Also, you may enter by solving the following
puzzle.  The winner of this puzzle will be decided within the same time
frame as the random prize, to allow the contest information to filter
through the networks, and to allow your letters and postcards to come in.

- THE PUZZLE -

Two cars are racing on a race track.  Each car is traveling in an opposite
direction (they aren't too bright).  The cars eventually collide with each
other.  One suffers damage to the windshield as it gets hit.  The other
driver flies out the side openning on his car because the netting was
damaged.

The first car, a Formula 1 racer, has its windshield replaced.  The second
car has its netting replaced.  What kind of car is the second car, and why?


- TO ENTER -

To enter, simply let your fingers do the talking and write an email and
send it to dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu.  You MUST put the word CONTEST
in the subject line of the email header!  Otherwise you run the risk of
having your email deleted (don't ask, it is a long story!) or send a post
card or letter to:

Amiga Report Contest
c/o David Tiberio
6 Lodge Lane
East Setauket, NY 11733

Is it possible to win via snail mail?  You might think that your chances of
winning are better by entering in email (much faster of course), but last
month's winner send in a letter that arrived the day before his winning
number was drawn!

In your letter or email, please provide the following:

Your full name and address.  Please keep in mind that many of you may have
addresses that I am not accustomed to, so please include your country or
any other information that I would need in case you win.  An email address
should also be included, if possible.

You must also include a brief one sentence overview of the editorial in
this issue of Amiga Report.  Just to make sure you are reading it.  :) You
must also include the issue number.  For example, if you read this in
AR213, then include that in your correspondance.  Also, a prize winner will
be determined by a random number generator.  Choose a number from 1 to
262,144.  The closest winner or winners to the randomly generated number
will receive the prize in the mail.  Anyone who does not provide a number
will have one assigned to him randomly.

All prizes will be mailed within one week after I get my hands on the
published version of AmigaReport.  I am doing this for a few reasons. 
First, every winner so far has given the correct puzzle solution before I
have received the editon of AmigaReport that announced it.  :) Second, I
don't like to go to the post office every day if I can avoid it.  Third,
you never know when someone's power supply might blow up (right Mr.
Editor?!).

- RULES AND REGULATIONS -

1. In the evnt that the editor's power supply fries, the contest for that
   month will have its deadline postponed to a later date, to be announced.
   Any contest entries for the random drawing will be added to the next
   month's drawing, to be held once per month near the beginning of the
   month.

2. All prizes are donated.  I cannot be held responsible for any damage
   caused by a prize.  For example, if you leave your prize on the stairs
   and your grandmother slips on it, I will not pay her medical bills.

3. We are not doing this for any profit, and cannot be held responsible if
   we go out of business or are otherwise financially unable to give you
   anything!  We are actively looking for submissions from other software
   authors.

4. Good things come to those who read the rules and regulations!  Here is
   a tip to help you win: every problem is a trick problem, or gives you
   clues that are not part of the problem itself.  Read the whole entire
   contest entry looking for clues.  And read my other articles for more
   clues.  I give some very obvious clues :).

5. If for any circumstance you are awarded a prize but do not receive it,
   contact me at (516) 476-1615.  I will promptly attend to any mistakes
   that have been made.

6. These rules are subject to change at any time without warning!

7. The company that publishes Art Department skipped the key information.

community and all persons involved in running this contest cannot be held
liable for anything that costs you money or lifetime pain and anguish.
Rules are subject to change.  All entries must be received by whenever TBA.
Any entries beyond this date will be entered into the next contest, if any.


- THE CHANCE YOU WILL WIN -

Odds of winning are approximately 1:50 for the random drawing and 1:5 for
the correct answer to the puzzle, based upon current entries.

SPECIAL THANKS to SideWinder for donating the Future Shock albums for
inclusion in our contest, along with Merrill Callaway for his ARexx

                            UUEncoding/Decoding
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
             (thanks to Bob Tomasevich for the quick tutorial)

What is uuencoding and uudecoding?
----------------------------------
uuencoding is converting a binary file into text (ASCII) which can be sent
through mail or Usenet.  uudecoding is reversing the process (e.g.
converting the file back to binary).

Why would I want to do this?
----------------------------
You have to send a binary file to a user who does not have FTP access, or
the user is too lazy to FTP the file.

What is the normal procedure?
-----------------------------
1. Convert the binary file into ASCII, using uuencode.
2. Send the file, through email, to the user.
3. The person on the receiving end gets the email, which may be split into
   parts.  If the email is split into parts, the parts must be combined,
   in the order received, into one file.
4. Receiving person converts the file back into binary, using uudecode.

What does a uuencoded file look like?
-------------------------------------
The start always has:

    begin 644 <encoded file's name>

So, for the file happy-happy-joy-joy.txt, it would look like:

    begin 644 happy-happy-joy-joy.txt

The encoded file begins right after:

M1TE&.#=A@`+@`9<````$`*QB15=2.+&/@R(Y)XM8.=J]H+*%7BL6#8]F6EP_]
M*$=E5"L?L-Z8A-:#60\@$,9P27-4-YB#;4HY)U!L9KZNE\O"O["#;8]82SDF>
M&[%J4FI',.&:E`48#="4@SE41M61<R`@%R$\,9:.?&!Z=NWM_\V';H-D1TI`=

.. more lines like the above ..

M>(`)N(`-^(`1.($5>($9N($=^($A.((E>((IN((M^((Q.(,U>(,YN(,]^(-!+
&V"\"`@`[&
``
end              <-- the end of the encoded file
size 151341      <-- size of the original file

So, how would I do this on the Amiga?
-------------------------------------
There are many uuencode/decode variants out there, but most usually have
kept the old UNIX command line, which can be confusing to novices, or,
require you to remove all mail headers and other, non-uuencoded text.

Luckily, Asher Feldman took the time to write UUxt.

What is UUxT?
-------------
It is a program which performs both the uuencode/decode operations in one
executable, AND, can also pack/unpack LhA archives.

Tell me more.
-------------
The UUxT archive contains UUxT, the CLI version, and UUxtGUI, the Workbench
interface.  I will give a short summary of how to use both.  Detailed
instructions are included in the UUxT archive.

CLI Version:
------------

  Running UUxT without any options gives the following:

     UUxT Version 2.1a Copyright (c)1993 Asher Feldman
     USAGE: UUxT [option] [archive name] <LhA archive name> <file(s)>
     options: a - encode           l - LhAencode
              x - decode           u - LhAdecode

  showing the format of the command line and the valid options.

  Some example command lines:

  1. Normal encoding - UUxt a filename.uue filename-to-archive
  2. Normal decoding - UUxt x filename.uue
  3. LhA archiving and encoding -

            UUxT l filename.uue filename.lha file1 file2 ...

  4. Decoding and LhA unarchiving - UUxT u filename.uue

  For LhA encoding and decoding, you will need LhA by Stefan Boberg.

  Workbench (GUI) Version:

  (1) Clicking on this brings up a requester to select the file you want to
         perform the operation shown in gadget (5).
  (2) You can manually type here the filename of the file affected by the
         operation indicated in gadget (5).
  (3) Used only for encoding, brings up a requester to select where the
         encoded file should go.  Selecting an existing file will cause the
         existing file to be replaced by the encoded file.  You can also
         use this requester to create directories.
  (4) You can manually type the filename of the file to be the encoded file.
  (5) The operation to perform on file shown in (2).  The operations are
         the four provided by UUxT (uuencode/uudecode/LhAEncode/LhADecode).
  (6) The name of the archive created with the LhAEncode option.  Ignored
         when any other operation is selected.
  (7) Does the encode/decode/LhAEncode/LhADecode and pops up a requester
         indicating if the operation was successful or not.

I need this!  Where can I get it?
---------------------------------
If you use the Internet from a local BBS, you may find it there.  If not
you can FTP it from wuarchive.wustl.edu, in the directory

                          pub/aminet/arc/UUxT.lha

It should also be on the Aminet mirrors.

Thanks for the explanation!  How can I reach you if I have questions?

===========================================================================

                The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
          -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-
service online SIG (Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users.

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in various ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA area banks of high-speed modems (you pay for the
phone call if it's not local), or though any SprintNet indial anywhere in
the USA, (with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell account.  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help and you can easily customize
it for your terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1000 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
      once, of any size, with one command.
 * Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, Elastic
      Reality (ASDG), Soft-Logik, Apex Publishing, and others.
 * 38 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 10,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.
 * Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
      related and get quick replies from the experts.
 * Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, EGS, Picasso,
      OpalVision & others feed right into the Zone message bases.  Read
      months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with them.
 * FREE unlimited Internet Email with 5 meg of free storage.
 * A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.
 * Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which you can read
      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine.
 * Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
      never worry "Ooops... Am I paying for this area?" again!
 * The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)  An 
      entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  And you get FREE unlimited
      usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
      email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
 * Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
      at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
