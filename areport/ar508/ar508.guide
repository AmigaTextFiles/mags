Ahhh!  Finally.

Work on this issue is finally coming to an end.  And yes, it's been a long
time since we put out 5.07, although I must say that most of you showed
considerable restraint in not mailing me -too- much about it.

A lot of work went into getting this issue ready for the new graphical HTML
format we'll be moving to.  That's right.  Amiga Report has finally made
the switch.  Initially, we had thought we could maintain both an AmigaGuide
and an HTML version of the magazine, but now that we've seen the result of
the HTML version (which, if you're reading the AmigaGuide version shortly
after its release, will be available in a few days), we've realized these
things.

1.  HTML lets us do a lot more with Amiga Report.

2.  HTML lets us make Amiga Report look a lot better.

3.  Trying to maintain both an AmigaGuide and an HTML version would be
nearly impossible on anything resembling our current schedule.

For these reasons, Amiga Report in AmigaGuide is a lame duck.  We'll do
one, perhaps two more issues in .guide format, and thereafter switch fully
to HTML.  For the time being, the HTML version will be available on Aminet
and through participating web sites.  Once the switch is made, however,
we'll use the Amiga Report mailing list at majordomo@ninemoons.com (the
"areport" list) to distribute HTML Amiga Report.  Because HTML tends to be
larger, and because we'll be able to include pictures much more readily,
the magazine will be split up into multiple archives, logically ordered (a
text archive, and various graphical archives as needed).

There are a minority of readers who cannot even read AmigaGuide but
struggle through reading the magazine as text.  To these readers, a switch
to HTML means a slightly higher level of inconvenience because the magazine
will be in multiple text files instead of just one large .guide file.

There is another minority of readers who do not have an HTML browser.  My
advice?  Get one, they're easy to find and run on virtually any Amiga
configuration put together since 1989.  Your browsing mileage may vary, of
course (Amiga Report in HTML has been IBrowse optimized but looks quite
good on other Amiga and non-Amiga browsers), but AWeb, Voyager, and IBrowse
demos are all over the place--online, on shareware and magazine CD-ROMs,
even on commercial CDs as front ends.  Check out AR 5.08 in HTML when
released and we hope you'll agree with our decision.

A lot has gone on besides just switching over to HTML.  Last issue, I was
about to leave on a trip--to Gateway HQ, where I participated for a few
days in discussions with new Amiga, Inc. GM Jeff Schindler, his skeleton
staff, and the directors of the ICOA (or Open Amiga for "short".)  Petro
was there as well.  Most of what went on was friendly talk and just getting
acquainted--there was of course some mutual brain picking going on, as
Amiga Inc. wanted to know what market insiders and well-known luminaries
like Andy Finkel thought about the Amiga market, while we all hammered at
them trying to find out what their plans were.  

As of today, Amiga, Inc.  has not been able to hire many
employees--partially due to a company policy imposed by Gateway requiring
them to fill upper management positions first before fleshing out their
larger engineering and marketing staffs.  It may seem somewhat
disappointing, but I was greatly inspired by the drive and level head with
which Schindler is approaching the situation.  For now, cooler heads need
to prevail and these guys need a chance to get up and running before TOO
much judgement has passed.

They have made some attempts at a public presence--Petro is flying around
making personal appearances, and new moving target PR man Darreck Lisle has
made some stops in the US as well.  What they've said so far is largely
general--no spec sheets are being handed out.  But they will be at the
early November Midwest Amiga Expo as well as the large Cologne Computer '97
expo.  By then, perhaps we'll hear a bit more.

-Jason

PS: It looks like I'll be at the Midwest Amiga Exposition, along with
Assistant Editor Katherine Nelson and our partners from Legacy Maker.  Hope
to see some of you there!

@node AD1 "The Amiga Informer Magazine"
@toc COMMERCIAL

I hope you had a chance to have a look at issue 9 of The Amiga Informer.
It was our largest issue to date and contained over eight main news
stories, fifteen news bytes and product announcements, sixteen reviews and
summaries, and, of course, our usual informative columns. 

At The Informer, we have a unique way of bringing you information.  
Through our network of internationally connected correspondents, we are
able to gather information as it happens and often we get inside reports
directly from the source.  Unlike some publications, we don't just reprint
press releases that are posted to the internet, but instead investigate and
research our stories and provide you with a commentary view of the events
happening in the Amiga world.

We have an innovative approach to bringing you this information too.  
Unique among Amiga publications, The Informer provides our readers with
both a detailed and professional print magazine, and a comprehensive
website where readers can enjoy current and past articles and columns.  The
website provides instant links to the web sites and email addresses of both
our advertisers and the Contacts listed within those articles.  In
addition, our subscribers get regular news reports sent directly to their
email address, courtesy of Amiga Update Newsletter.  By taking advantage of
the power of the internet and the expediency of electronic correspondence,
we are able to provide our readers with the latest and most comprehensive
reporting available to Amiga enthusiast.

The Informer also provides a means for the small developer or vendor to
reach the Amiga community.  By printing our magazine in grayscale instead
of a full color glossy format, we are able to maintain affordable
subscription and advertising rates.  This gives small companies a chance to
advertise and let readers see just what products are available in the
market today.  We also give a voice to the development community by
offering them free announcements for their new products and upgrades and
providing a web-based Developers Forum where developers can air their views
on matters of interest to the entire Amiga community.

The combination of these and other services are what is making The Informer
the fastest growing Amiga print publication in North America.  By listening
to the suggestions of our readers, and keeping our fingers on the pulse of
the world-wide Amiga community, we will continue to provide our readers
with the most comprehensive and informative Amiga publication available.

comments: I found an AmigaGuide viewer for those Amiga users out there that have
(temporarily) left the Amiga for MS-Doze... I just can't remember where
I found it... It's called AGV...(AmigaGuide Viewer - original name eh?)
I don't have any docs on it but I found it on the WWW (somewhere...)


-    Mr. Broussard followed this up with the executable.  I'll see what I
     can do about making it more readily available.  It's ironic, though,
     that this came through so short to our cancellation of the AmigaGuide
     version of Amiga Report... -Jason

Subject: Amigas in Sri Lanka

In the current issue of AR, a poor Amiga enthusiast from Sri Lanka asks for
help in getting Amiga-related materials in his decided un-Amigan country. 
While unfortunately I live nowhere near Sri Lanka and cannot help him, I
should point out that one of the Amiga's more famous promoters, Arthur C. 
Clarke, DOES happen to live in Sri Lanka.

I wonder where he got his equipment?

I just read your letter in Amiga Report this morning.  Unfortunately I
can't help you with locating the transparency attachment, but I can confirm
Migraph's fate.  Back in December I tried contacting them to get an update
to their Touch-Up software, but to no avail.  So I then proceeded to mail
each of their 3 or 4 last known addresses.  All but one was returned, and
that letter went to a Post Office Box.  AFAIK that relies on the
cooperation of the (current?) boxholder.  So I then decided to contact City
Hall in Federal Way, WA, who plainly told me that Migraph had not renewed
theit business license for 1997.  So they chose to quietly slip away.

I've never seen any of their hardware first-hand, but would be surprised if
they didn't just choose generic scanners made in the Far East and put their
name on it.  I have seen hand scanners for several different platforms, and
this would appear to often be the case.  So my guess is that some company
out there sells an attachment that will work for you.  Hopefully somebody
can give you a more concrete answer, but failing that, I would start making
enquiries.   And if all else fails, I have the name (and possible address)
of the owner.

Sincerely,

Todd Oberly

comments: Hello Mr.  Compton.  I know the Amiga Computer since 1988 and get
a A1200 in august of 1993.  This computer is "sensacional", "la berraquera"
this the principal expresion to this platform.  My machine A1200 had
accelerator Microbotics, with MMu and FPU and 50MHZ, sound, video and
conection to Internet.

I lost my A1200, because the "ladrones" in spanish, get into my house and
get us all my home: TV, A1200, CDTV, VHS, bicyclet, radio, "joyas", and so
on.

This ocurred in jun 27 of 1996.  Today i buy another A1200, with HD 80MB,
Accelerator GVP, monitor Comm.  1084, MMU, FPU and Midi Interfece.

I have an PC Computer Premium.

But A1200 is very nice.  I work in Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje, SENA.
in Santafé de Bogotá, Colombia South America.

My Entity is a public service to prepared the workers. 

We are 9,000 employees.  4,500 of they are teachers an instructor of
diferents materias or especialities. 

Sena is the only public service for the poor people.

The working student has much necesities and the only site to study is Sena
Entity.

In relation to Amiga report I have collected Amiga Report from 201 through
507.

Your magazine is very important.  The Colombians Amigans are "preocupados
por" the Amiga future.  Gateway 2000 not decided nothing.

I have in my computer IBrowse v1.0 and tomorrow will have IBrowse 1.12a.

Excuse me my bad English. 

Thank you. Felicitacions from Amiga Report.

A Colombian Amigan.


-     It's really rewarding to hear from readers so diverse from across the
      globe.  Sorry to hear about the loss of so much of your equipment.

Hi!

I have now for about one year waited for a sign of an eventually new
version of Magic Workbench.  I'm still waiting...

Reference:

----8<---from http://www.sasg.com/mwb/future.html ---
The test extends over the coming months.  The amount of new-registered
users in this test period will be decisive of the future of MagicWB and if
I will continue my work on it.  If the amount of registrations within this

-    No, the Amiga is not dead.  It's too soon to tell when Amiga, Inc.
     could release a new line of Amigas or even what is feasible to put
     in such a computer.  As far as South Africa gaining substantial

@node OPINION1 "The Evolution Of The Icon"
@toc OPINION

===========================================================================
                         The evolution of the Icon
  Eric Sauvageau                                          merlin@thule.no
===========================================================================

[Eric Sauvageau is the current author and maintainer of NewIcons, which
recently released Version 4.  As someone who is deeply involved with the
look and feel of Amiga desktops, he can be considered an expert.  He is, of
course, somewhat biased by his experience, but his insight is worth
reading. -Jason]

Workbench85
-----------

One of the things in which Commodore never did much work was probably the
icon part of Workbench.  Be it the icon engine itself, or the look of the
system icons, Commodore seemed to have always worried about the
ridiculously-low-end part of things by keeping their icons 4 colors--with a
no-frill engine to handle them.  Fast but boring.  Basically, icon imagery
is nothing but actual bitplane data stored in an image structure, with no
color information.  All that is stored is information that some pixels will
use whatever color is first in the screen's color map (Color0), other
pixels will use the next color, and so on.  This means the icon will use
whatever colors the system palette is set to, preventing the use of any
color scheme in icons for easy recognition.  Thus, an icon which is
supposed to show the Canadian flag (red and white) might very well come up
as gray and green.


Workbench 2.04 - Things are getting better...  Are they?
--------------------------------------------------------

With Release 2 of the OS, Commodore did a complete overhaul of the GUI.  A
new 3D look was defined for windows and gadgets.  This was also applied to
icons--they were turned into large buttons that would recess as you clicked
on them.  While this provided a very useful visual feedback, this kinda
hindered artistic efforts - you had to do something that would look nice
while surrounded with a gray box.  You couldn't get rid of it.  As for the
icon look itself, not much was done to improve the look.  It was mostly
left to flat black & white pictograms.


A little Magic on your Workbench
--------------------------------

The first real effort toward improving things came probably through
MagicWB.  It defined an 8-color standard palette (quite an improvement over
the CBM 4-color scheme), as well as more a intricate icon design.  It
quickly became popular, and soon hundreds of icons using the MagicWB style
started to appear.  However, the palette engine used by Workbench and
icon.library was still a problem.  A small patch was written to ensure that
the 8 standard colors would be locked, preventing applications from
changing them.  So, you were sure your MagicWB icons would always use the
same colors on any system running that pen locker.  For quite a few years,
people were content with it.


Newer and better
----------------

The second attempt at improving things came out as NewIcons, from Nicola
Salmoria.  NewIcons's revolution was that it wasn't just an attempt at
changing the look - it was also an attempt at improving the actual icon
engine, by allowing a palette (up to 256 colors) to be embedded within each
icon, which would be dynamically remapped as it was displayed.  The drastic
improvement over the original palette-less icon scheme was to allow more
colorful icons to be used, without having the user worrying about what
color to lock in his or her Workbench palette.

The new engine (supplied as a library and a system patch) was shipped with
a 16-color isometric iconset, bringing a whole new look to the Workbench. 
However, the silly gray boxes were still there.  There was also a price to
pay--more colorful icons meant higher memory requirements, and the actual
remapping process slowed down icon display quite a bit as well.  Today, we
might find this irrelevant as we're flying with 24-bits cards and 68060,
but back to these days (around 1993), the average user was still using ECS
or AGA, on a 68020 or 68030.


The new Ring Bearer
-------------------

Just after the release of NewIconsV2, Nicola decided to pass the torch to
new developers as he migrated to another computer platform.  Eric Sauvageau
and Philip Vedovatti decided to take over, respectively as programmer and
icon artist (former icon art was being done by Roger McVey).  Work began on
a major update that would push it even further.  V3 finaly came out, with a
welcomed surprise: gone were the gray boxes surrounding icons!  Also, as
people started to get faster CPUs and better graphic cards, they started to
want something more colorful for their Workbench, NewIcons grew in
popularity.  V3 also allowed graphics card owners to have icons loaded into
FastRAM instead of the slower (and limited to 2 MB max) ChipRAM.


Better, Stronger, Faster
------------------------

About one year later, another incarnation of NewIcons appeared, as Version
4 was released.  As 68060 and graphics cards had become popular, the
included iconset got redesigned in 32 color.  Also, gray boxes were totally
eliminated, as icon dragging is now also box-free.  It also allowed the
user to select between normal, outlined or shadowed rendering for the
icon's text, allowing even more freedom in Workbench look customization.
And finally, it was also faster than V3.


icon.library - The Next Generation
----------------------------------

There is no doubt that something must be done about the icon scheme in a
future update to AmigaOS.  The first thing that needs to be addressed is
the need for screen palette independant icons - having each icons decide
which colors it requires, just like NewIcons does.  However, NewIcons
itself isn't a long-term solution.  NewIcons was designed as a patch over
the old icon scheme, compromising in various areas to allow full backward
compatibility, like having its new image data stored in the tooltypes.  And
with modern graphics cards, 256 colors for icons is no longer enough.  The
icon palette would need to be extended to at least 16 bits, with true
transparency support.

Other features missing from the actual icon scheme is support for alternate
imageries.  How about less colorful images for systems with less color?  Or
with the advent of more powerful processors, dynamic rescaling so icons
would adapt to the aspect ratio of the actual display could even become a
realistic feature.  Another feature popular on other platforms is the
presence of an alternate, smaller image that can be used as a pictogram
either in an application launcher or in some text display of a directory,
like a file requester.

Finally, some form of filetype recognition needs to be integrated to the
Workbench.  This could be implemented as a "filetype" field stored into the
icon, which would take further the idea of a "default tool", where a user
could change the default tool for a given file type through some global
preference editor, rather than having to individually change every icon for
a given filetype.  This would eliminate the chaos of every programmer
finding another new esoteric text viewer to set as the default tool for
their documentation icon, ruining the idea of saving the actual user the
work of having to decide what to use as he double-clicks on its icon.


Who shall lead the herd to greener pasture?
-------------------------------------------

Third party developers pushed farther the unfinished task Commodore had
started in 1985 by bringing to the user a graphical user interface that was
meant to be both easy in use and attractive.  They took care of the
aesthetic side of things that Commodore had somewhat failed to assert.  
Now, it's time to give back the torch to whomever at Amiga, Inc.  will be
working on the next version of AmigaOS, so they can take things one major
step further ahead, farther than third parties could by just patching over
an OS and an icon system that's starting to show its age.

@node NEWS1 "Amiga Report Format Change"
@toc NEWS

As some of you will notice already, Amiga Report has made its long-awaited
shift to a graphical HTML version.

When first announced at the beginning of the year, it was thought that the
Amiga Report editorial staff would be able to continue producing
simultaneous AmigaGuide and HTML versions of the magazine.  However, due to
the work required, and the amount of pride we have in the new HTML
appearance, this will not be the case.

1997 will be the last year in which an AmigaGuide Amiga Report will be
produced.  This is not a decision we make lightly, but these factors helped
us make our decision:

1.  The HTML version looks much better than the AmigaGuide, and more easily
allows us to present information (including better tables, picture
integration, and other enhancements) in a much more pleasing form.

2.  The vast majority of input we've had about the appearance of Amiga
Report encouraged an HTML version wholeheartedly.

3.  Any Amiga with a configuration even approaching "modern" is capable of
running a minimal HTML browser.  Demo versions, some with surprisingly few
limitations, are available free.  Magazines give them away on their CD-ROMs
like crazy.  They are, in short, not difficult to find.

4.  For the small percentage of AR readers who have access to neither an
AmigaGuide reader or an HTML online viewer (for the current text-only HTML
conversion), it would seem that the inconvenience of reading the magazine
in HTML is only slightly more than the inconvenience of reading an
AmigaGuide file as plain text.

5.  Amiga Report's release schedule has not been very commendable over the
past year.  We know this.  Requiring us to produce two different versions
on two totally different design paradigms would make matters worse.  (In
AmigaGuide, the tendency is to squash many files into one.  In HTML, the
idea is to make as many things independent files as possible.  This is
inconvenient for making two versions from the same source material.)

We hope that you will be understanding about this change, and that this
advance warning will allow the minority sector of readers without HTML
viewers to seek one out before the permanent change is made.

The Amiga Report mailing list will distribute AR HTML as a series of files,
due to the restraint many systems impose on incoming mail.  Most likely, AR
will be distributed as an archive of text-only files, with graphical
archives following.  The archive to be placed on Aminet will of course
contain all the necessary files in one .lha file, since the restriction is
not the same.

We hope all of you will be as excited by the new Amiga Report as we are.
For as long as the AmigaGuide version lasts, the mailing list will be used
exclusively for the AmigaGuide version--the HTML versions can be obtained
from Aminet or other participating distribution sites.

@node NEWS5 "Dice C Source"
@toc NEWS

From Matt Dillon and Obvious Implementations Corporation (OIC):

I have finally found the time to release the source to the DICE compiler. 
It's pretty much as-is, I'm sorry to say, but still a pretty good piece of
work even now.  The release is roughly equivalent to the last commercial
release that we (OIC) did.

The core source will compile on the Amiga and can also be compiled on most
UNIX platforms.  It generates 68000 output and all files are output in the
amiga's binary, object, and library file formats.  Embedded 68000 support
is included, which is basically what I use it for these days.

Sources for the complete system: dcc, dcpp, dc1, das, dlink, and dobj have
been released along with a bunch of other stuff.  Since I still use DICE
for embedded hardware projects, it isn't *totally* obsolete.

The code should easily compile on an Amiga or a FreeBSD box and ought to
compile reasonably well on other UNIX boxes.  The code can be retrieved
from the Obvious Implementations Corp.  web site:

http://www.obviously.com/

I haven't done much work on the Amiga recently.  Some of you might have
heard that I got caught up in an ISP startup <wry grin>.  That was about 3
years ago and I've been working at it ever since.  Thank god we don't have
to deal with Microcruft NT.  It's FreeBSD all the way.  I'm doing mostly
UNIX work these days...  back to my root's, in fact, as I was using BSD 4.2
at UC Berkeley a couple of years before the Amiga came out.

In anycase, DICE is probably my finest piece of code.  I hope people get
some use out of the core and libraries.

Oliver Wagner is the one-man wrecking crew behind a number of Amiga
internet utilities, most notably Voyager, the shareware HTML browser which
more than once has been the first to offer new features, beating its
commercial counterparts AWeb and IBrowse.  Java and Javascript support have
been mentioned for the browser in the near future.  Below is Wagner's
explanation of the situation, taken from the CU Amiga mailing list.

To join CU's mailing list yourself, mail listserv@cu-amiga.co.uk with HELP
in the body for a full list of commands and options.

--------------

From Mr. Wagner:

I've been working on the Javascript implementation for quite some time
already; actually, all Voyager versions since 2.42 internally have the
hooks to the Voyager_JS.VLIB plugin which contains the interpreter and
object management parts (those were accidentally left active in 2.70, thus
causing Voyager to complain about lack of this library upon hitting
<script> tags or event specifications).  Those are now disabled for the
public releases but are still used internally for testing.

I've also made several statements about upcoming Javascript support in
Voyager on the support mailing list, including a recent thorough
explanation of the problems which were introduced due to Netscape's latest
update to "their" language.  If you ever hit Javascript intensive pages
with MSIE 3.x, you know what I mean :) (see, for example,
http://www.opel.com/).  Obviously, we want to support the latest Netscape
specs on JS, and are closely following the W3C effort to standardize a web
scripting language.

I'm not actually writing the interpreter myself, this is done by someone
who prefers to stay unnamed since he fears "When will JS be ready?" mailbox
cluttering.  However, the interpreter will be an integral part of the
Voyager 3 release.  Part of the code has been originally developed by
Holger 'hkr' Kruse.

Darreck Lisle, Amiga Inc.'s utility infielder (event coordinator, PR man,
and pretty much anything else necessary until a full staff gets hired),
spoke last week at an Amiga user group meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.  Set on
the grill, this is the summation of the Q&A session that ensued.


Q:  Should we buy AmigaOS 3.1?
A:  Yes--you will need the ROMs for the updated AmigaOS anyway.

Q:  Is graphics card compatibility going to be built into the next OS release?
A: Yes--some type of RTG standard should be included as well as an AHI-type
of standard.

Q:  How long should we expect to wait before we see new systems?
A:  Probably around a year.

Q:  Are there any other enhancements to the Amiga you foresee?
A:  Possibly support for the Universal Serial Bus (USB).

Q:  What is Amiga, Inc.'s position on UAE, the Amiga emulator available
    for Microsoft and UNIX?  
A:  The current practice of pirating Amiga ROMs will be cracked down
    on shortly.

Q:  What does Amiga, Inc. think about Java?
A:  We would like to see Java in the next OS, but there is still a lot to be
    done in this area.

Q:  Are we going to see any of the current operating system hacks, such as
    MUI, built into a future AmigaOS?
A:  Possibly--however, MUI is too large and bulky to consider making it an
    integral part of the OS.  A TCP stack is a definite possibility.

Q:  Will the prices of existing systems be dropped, like say $1000 off the
    existing A4000T prices?
A:  Yes--Amiga motherboards are quite simple in design so cost should
    reduce, especially after improvements are made to the current design,
    such as optimization of the existing custom chip set.

Q:  Will Amiga, Inc. be coordinating with third parties?
A:  Yes--that is one of the main goals of Amiga, Inc.

DESCRIPTION

AROS is an effort to re-write the AmigaOS V3.1 (40.70 or later) in ANSI C
(mostly).  The goal is to have the power of the AmigaOS without beeing
limited by the hardware.  We try hard to maintain source compatibility
which means that, if you want some Amiga application on your mainframe, all
you have to do is to get its source and compile it again.

Right now, we have implemented these features:
- Almost the complete exec. Only interrupts and some more
  esoteric functions are missing
- Much of DOS
- A shell to run DOS commands
- A set of working DOS commands: Dir, List, Echo, Cd, ...
- Parts of graphics.library, intuition.library and
  locale.libary, math*
- Enough of Intuition to open a window, receive IntuiMessages
  and process them.
- console.device with RawKeyConvert()
- Several demos
- The following parts are finished: icon.library, iffparse.library
  and utility.library.

If you want to participate, then you can choose between these two:

a) The Preferred Way: Get your hands on CVS and follow the
   instructions on our WWW pages.

b) The Usual Way: Get the latest source, make your modifications
   and send me patches via email. Since this takes some time,
   make sure you allocate your work with the jobserver.

If you write something for us, make sure to check if that job
is not already done by someone else. To achieve this, use the
jobserver. You can reach it by writing an EMail to

aros@aros.fh-konstanz.de

with the Subject "jobserv" (without the "").  It reads the contents of the
mail and executes it.  For help simply use the command "help" on a single
line.

CHANGES (since 1.10)

- Bugfixes (as usual)
- Many new functions and libs
- We have the first game for AROS: Moria3D runs after minor changes
- All necessary includes to compile AROS
- Added conditional build (see make.defaults)
- Much faster linking on Unix
- Makefiles are generated from templates
- AROS has Resource Tracking now :-)
- Added a small mini kernel to ease porting
- New libs: math*, diskfont, gadtools
- New logo by Mike Williams
- New unix kernel with only one simple assembler file left
- New technique which allows the hardware dependend part of AROS
  replace files in other parts of AROS

FUTURE

- More docs :-)
- More functions
- More Resource Tracking
- The fastes AmigaOS ever on an DEC-Alpha-Workstation with
  200MHz ;)

AMIGAZONE WEB SITE GETS COMPLETE FACE-LIFT

The venerable AmigaZone's Web site (http://www.amigazone.com), one of the
oldest existing Amiga-supporting web sites has just gotten a total
redesign! 

Our pages now loads faster, because we've split them up a bit into more
sub-pages, and we now use tables with a convenient bar of buttons down the
left-hand side to take you to its other areas. 

However this new site design incorporates even more info than we had
before.  For example, we now feature tables of our current weekly prize
offerings and a listing of recent winners. 

We've even included buttons which will automatically launch your favorite
Telnet client (once you've configured your browser for it) to let you log
right into the Zone's Text-style interface, and another to take you to its
members-only web interface (http://amigazone.com).

If you haven't visited the AmigaZone site in a while, well c'mon back and
take a look at our fresh new face :-)

(The AmigaZone is an online service for Amiga owners, users and lovers.  
We've been in business since 1985.  We're _fully_ net-connected with Usenet
newsgroups, Fidonet "echoes", Amiga mailing lists, email, local message
bases, 40,000 files, CD-ROMs online, a text-style interface _and_ a slick
Web interface, and live, nightly chats with prize contests.  We are hosted
by CalWeb Internet Services and $19.95/month gets you total access to
everything, 24 hours a day, including your own CalWeb UNIX shell account
with 10 meg of storage for your own web site!.  Free two-week trial

The Graphics World Of ArtEffect


Following the recent successful debut of ArtEffect 2 in June, we are now
pleased to introduce two new special effect packages to extend its' power.
PowerEffects 2 offers a variety of outstanding effects like LensFlares,
Lightning and FishEye.  The new PowerUP Effects package offers a great
performance boost for users of PowerUp boards by Phase5.  This is also the
first commercial Amiga application that takes advantage of the incredible
speed of these RISC based cards.


ArtEffect 2.0 

Version 2 of ArtEffect has been completely revised.  We have built on the
innovative concepts which were introduced in version 1.0, and have added
many new features, e.g.  Layers, ARexx and multiple Undo/Redo.


ArtEffect Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 

There is a new FAQ section on the homepage of ArtEffect with helpful
answers to often asked questions.  You are also able to submit your own
questions here regarding ArtEffect.


ArtEffect Mailing List 

A new ArtEffect mailing list has been setup as an open forum for questions
and discussion.  It is also a good place to voice your wishes for future
releases of ArtEffect.


New PowerEffects for ArtEffect 

Nine (9) sensational new effects are included in PowerEffects 2.  Besides
FishEye, Patchwork, FalseColor, Pointize, HalfTone and Crystalize; the
highlights are certainly: Lightning and LensFlares. 


Need for Speed: PowerUP Effects 

Are you looking for some really fast effects?  Then stop here to have a
look at the PowerUP Effects.  The speed of the PowerUP Effect is mainly
based on the PowerPC native version of the plugin.library that handles
almost all actions of the plug-ins.  So not only the filters of this
package will be faster, there is also an increase in speed of every effect,
because they all will now use the new PPC plugin.library.   Besides this,
there are special native versions of the major effects.  The PowerUP
Effects are 2 to 20 times faster than the normal ones.   The PowerUP
Effects are the first application that makes use of the enormous power of
the PowerUP board of Phase 5. 


HAAGE & PARTNER is the leading manufacturer of Development Systems and
Applications for the Amiga family of computers.  The Storm series (StormC,
StormWizard, StormPowerASM) for 68K AmigaOS, PowerPC (PowerUP) and p.OS
provide a powerful suite of programming tools.  Our latest project, MERAPI,
will bring the power of JAVA to the Amiga.

HAAGE & PARTNER is also the developer and/or distributor of several cutting
edge applications including: ArtEffect, PowerEffects, EasyWriter,
DrawStudio, Tornado3D and NetConnect.  Our mission is to provide the Amiga
market with the most effective tools and applications possible.  It's not
enough to just ask: "Where do you want to go?" At Haage & Partner we are
harnessing the power of the Amiga to actually help get you there!

Amiga Inc. To Host Official Developers Conference at MAE

We are very pleased to announce that South Dakota-based Amiga Inc., will be
hosting its first-ever official Developers Conference at the The 1997
Midwest Amiga Exposition (MAE) which will be held in Columbus, Ohio on
November 1 and 2.  The show is produced by the Amiga Central Ohio Network
(AMICON) user group and will be attended by many Amiga software and
hardware companies, Amiga industry luminaries and promises to be a very
positive shot in the arm for the entire Amiga community. 

Darreck Lisle, Amiga Inc.'s Public Relations and Events Coordinator told
CUCUG, "The Developers Conference at the MAE show is actually just the
first of a series of international conferences Amiga Inc.  will be
sponsoring.  We recognize the importance of effective communication and
cooperation between software and hardware makers and the new Amiga
development team here at Amiga Inc.  and we are putting together an
ambitious program to facilitate an effective exchange of ideas and
information."

Additional conferences are now planned for Cologne Germany, Milan Italy,
St.  Louis Missouri, and London, according to Lisle. 

Amiga Developers Network Planned 

CU Amiga Magazine announced today that it was contacted by Amiga Inc.  and
asked to assist in building a database of Amiga developers.  Serious Amiga
developers are being encouraged to register at the CU Amiga web site for
possible, later contact by Amiga Inc.  A Registered Developers Network will
at some point be put together by Amiga Inc., according to Lisle who also
went on to say, "The Industry Council Open Amiga (ICOA) will play a big
part in the future of the Developers Conferences, and the Developers
Network."

Epson Supports the Amiga 

In another bit of promising Amiga news, Lisle told CUCUG, "The people at
Epson have agreed to work with us and to supply us with everything needed
to develop software and drivers to support their full line of printers and
scanners." This unexpected announcement will come as a relief to the many
Amiga users who have been frustrated by the lack of Amiga driver support
for popular peripherals in the past.

@toc NEWS

For Immediate Release
PUBLISHERS RESTORE FLOOD-DAMAGED LIBRARIES

PHILADELPHIA, Pa., September 12, 1997 - The floods of earlier this year
continue to impact the communities of the Midwest, especially non-profit
institutions such as libraries.  In many cases, insurance will only cover
the cost of rebuilding facilities, not the costs of replacing books and
collections.  Publishers are helping to restore library collections by
donating new books, with more than 60,000 books donated so far.

This summer, one small publisher, Intangible Assets Manufacturing, of
Philadelphia, contributed by donating new books valued at more than $1500.
IAM president Dale L.  Larson explained, "It might be profitable to try to
sell our books to these libraries as they rebuild their collections, and
we're small enough that those sales would be significant for us.  But some
things are more important than sales."

Midwest book distributor The Bookmen and various volunteers have worked
with the Minnesota Library Association Foundation to coordinate and
distribute donations.  This week IAM received a letter from the Association
saying in part, "Your gift will help with the restoration of collections
for libraries affected in both Minnesota and North Dakota.  We are truly
grateful for your generosity."

And that's what's more important than sales.

Intangible Assets Manufacturing produces a line of Amiga products,
including the book "Connect Your Amiga!  A Guide to the Internet, LANs,
BBSs and Online Services", DiskSalv4, MRBackup, MegaBall4 and others.

IAM also publishes Internet-related books "Torn Shapes of Desire: Internet
Erotica" and "Lineland: Mortality and Mercy on the Internet's
Pynchon-L@Waste.Org Discussion List."

TITLE

Games Master System
(GMS)


VERSION

0.8B (Released September 1997)


AUTHOR

Paul Manias (paul@ethos.co.nz)


DESCRIPTION

The Games Master System is a developers kit that is aimed at enhancing the
functionality of the Amiga OS, with emphasis on games programming.  It is
based on the Amiga shared library standard, so will work with any
programming language such as C, Assembler, E, Basic etc.

The system can be ported across to other platforms besides the Amiga, and
in future GMS programs could be run on other platforms without
recompilation (CPU's must match or they have to be emulated).

Here are just a few of the GMS features:

- Object Oriented kernel design.
- Fast blitter functions, including CPU assisted blitting.
- Full sprite support.
- In-built proportional fading functions.
- Sound support, includes intelligent channel play-back.
- Support for raster/copperlists with built-in special FX.
- External structure and object pre-processing, allows user
  editing of program data.
- Dynamic resource allocation.
- Support for all kinds of input devices (joysticks, joypads etc)
- An official system debugger is provided.
- A preference program that allows editing of things such as
  default screen dimensions, resolutions, mode promotion etc.
- Multi-tasking and screen-switching is supported.

The system has a very modern design and includes full resource tracking and
safe task destruction features.  A debugger has been included which GMS
functions co-operate with, so there is no need for special patches or
debugging tools.  Functions are written with garbage protection features
and where possible, software based memory protection.  GMS can recover from
many programming errors that usually result in software failures.

Full documentation and 285k of example source in C, Assembler and E is
included within the developer archive.


NEW FEATURES

Some of the new features present in V0.8B are:

  - Complete object orientation, making GMS the first low-level OO
    system to appear on the Amiga.
  - Lots of smaller changes and bug fixes.
  - Dice C support.
  - Revised documentation.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

GMS will take up 1.5 megs of space on your hard-drive and runs in less than
90k of memory.  There are no must-have requirements, but an AGA Amiga is
necessary for about 5% of the demos.  KingCON or any other enhanced shell
with a scroll back buffer is desirable for running IceBreaker.


AVAILABILITY

GMS is available on all up to date Aminet sites, for example:

  ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/gms_dev.lha (420k)
  ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/gms_user.lha (190k)

Developers will need both archives, Users will only need the second
archive.


PRICE

This beta version is free.

Attention all Amiga users!

The Amiga Informer is proud to announce some fantastic new additions to its
full featured web site.  Now, the Informer hosts several great new content
areas:

- Outspoken Amigans
This is a moderated forum, wherein The Informer selects editorials written
by notable Amiga users to be posted for the Amiga community to read and
ponder.  Expect a new editorial every month or so. 
(www.amigainformer.com/community.html)

- Developers' Forum
This special area is a discussion of important decisions about the future
of the Amiga, from the people that know it best: the Developers.  One
crucial question is posed to a pool of popular Amiga developers, and
selected responses are posted on the Amiga Informer web site.  Expect
frequent updates in this area.  (www.amigainformer.com/forum.html)

- THE GAME ZONE
The Games Evaluations section of the Amiga Informer 'Zine now has its own
dedicated area on the web site.  This issue, Nemac IV: The Director's Cut,
Burnout and more!  (www.amigainformer.com/games.html)

Here's another important announcement.  Pantheon Systems has converted the
Amiga Informer web site to frames, so you'll need Aweb II 3.x, Voyager NG
2.x, Ibrowse 1.1x, or Netscape 2.x to properly view the site.  In the next
several months, The Informer will be hosting a non-frames version
(www.amigainformer.com/fronpage.shtml) of the site in order to allow
everybody ample time to upgrade their web browsers.

You'll also want to vote for the Informer as a Starting Point Hot Site by
clicking on the Hot Site icon on the frontpage of the Informer's site. 
(amigainformer.com/frontpage.shtml)

In addition to the already immense Informer search engine
(www.amigainformer.com/search.html) and online archives

DESCRIPTION

db is a small and fast database program that I wrote after having tested
numerous other PD database programs and always found something lacking or
irritating me.  They might have dozzens of features not found in db, but
they lacked font sensitivity and a standard GUI look and OS 3.0 behaviour.

My main need was to keep record on addresses and telephone numbers of
friends and companies.  Before v2.0 db was fixed to be just an address and
telephone database, but that has changed.  db was designed with user
definable layout in mind from start.  Since v3.0 I've added GUI-based
database design to db that releaves the user from the work of specifying
the layout by writing RFF code

When you use db you will notice that the user interface has been kept as
compact as possible (few gadgets, menus and windows).  Still the
functionality in for example, searching and sorting is high.  This is
intentional.  I prefer few buttons with high functionality than the
opposite.  The ASL requester is in my opinion an example of good design.
It may look simple, but hides features like automatic drawer creation and
filename completion.  I hope you spend enough time with db to discover its
hidden features.


FEATURES

A partial list of db's features include:

o Dynamic memory handling. Number of records and fields only limited by
  free memory.
o GadTool based. (Use fields of string, checkbox, cycle and text type)
o Support for multi-line fields through textfield.gadget
o Mouse and keyboard driven.
o User definable fields and layout.
o Multiple views of the same database.
o The views can be designed through a simple to use GUI.
o Commodore's Clipboard for flexible interaction with other programs.
o AppWindow -just drag and drop database icons on db to load.
o Online MenuHelp -Press HELP key when selecting a menu item.
o Font sensitive.
o ASL requesters for flexible loads and saves.
o Localized.
o ARexx support.
o Dial numbers using a modem or loudspeaker.
o WB and Shell usage with Commodore's template parsing.
o Fast and flexible find function using AmigaDOS patterns.
o Listview browser.
o Filter function.
o Fast and flexible sort function. Multiple sort orders can be specified.
o 'Export View' and two standard ASCII export features.
o Automatic ASCII import (tab-separated ASCII).

CHANGES:

Changes since previous release:

o Added TEXT type to view design toolbar.
o Added TEXTFIELD type to view design toolbar
  (however you can't change its height in editor yet).
o Added abbreviations to Shell template
o Trailing ':' is no longer added to selector window's
  title if the record label the title is based on,
  already has it.
o Edit view related strings are now localized
o New CLI/tooltype DEFPATTERN (def. "#?")
o New CLI/tooltype DEFREXXPATTERN (def. "#?.(db|rexxdb)")
o Toolbox items call be also accessed via F1-F5 keys
  directly from edit view window
o New menu item - reload current project
o New menu item - relaunch recently selected ARexx script
o Hungarian translation added. DB now supports 14 languages.
  Unfortunately, most of existing translations
  are a little bit outdated with this edition. Hope that
  will change with next release, when all will finish their
  holidays. For now you can use old catalogs so all newly
  localized strings will appear in english.

@node NEWS29 "Phase5 PowerUP News"
@toc NEWS

The first, and probably most important news about Phase5's PowerUP
PowerPC/060 cards is that they are actually, finally, shipping.

The CyberStorm PPC cards for the A3000 and A4000 are the first to be sent
out the door--the A1200 and 2000 models will follow.

Phase5 has also been doing some work to expand PowerUP coverage: Newtek is
in possession of a board, and SAS/C will be gaining PowerUP code generation
capabilities.  In fact, just about all of the 3D software for the Amiga is
slated for PowerUP conversion.

A1200 owners have seen their options expand again.  The 603+ series of
Blizzard cards will allow the use of an 040 or 060 (as opposed to the 030
previously planned for the original 603 Blizzard board), and all A1200
models with PowerUP cards will be able to use the planned BVision PPC
graphics board, which will attach to the accelerator card in much the same
way as the already announced CyberVision PPC for the big-box Amiga
accelerators.

Blizzard 603+ card pricing is as follows:
(All pricing in DM, does not include necessary 040 or 060 CPU)

160 Mhz: 749.00
200 Mhz: 999.00
250 Mhz: 1199.00

PowerUP-grade users subtract 100 DM for 160 and 200 Mhz models, 150 DM for
250 Mhz model.

The BVision PPC will be a 4 meg video RAM device capable of 1600x1200x24
bit display at 60Hz.  Planned price is 499 DM, with a 50 DM discount for
PowerUP-grade program members.

Also, Phase5 has dropped all 040-based products from its lineup due to the
lack of availability for 040 chips.  The CyberStorm Mark II has also been
dropped and has been replaced by the CyberStorm Mark III, which is
essentially a PowerUP CyberStorm with the relevant PowerPC circuitry
missing, i.e.  only an 060 onboard with no ability to add a PowerPC 604.
Pricing and availability should be available soon.

@node NEWS30 "Haage and Partner Announce WarpUP, Phase5 Blasts H&P"
@toc NEWS

The relationship between Phase5, manufacturer of the PowerUP PowerPC cards
for the Amiga, and German software developer Haage and Partner, has taken
an unexpected turn.

H&P, who from appearances had a mutually beneficial relationship with
Phase5 and were one of the earliest and most active supporters of the
PowerUP concept, porting their StormC compiler to generate PowerUP code,
have announced a new kernal for use with PowerUP cards.  This design
apparently deviates somewhat from the intended PowerUP software standard.

This lead to a swift and strong reaction from Phase5.  The relevant news
items follow below--H&P's WarpUP announcement, followed by a statement from
Phase5 GM Wolf Dietrich.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

WarpUP: A high-speed kernal for PowerUP

Finally the Amiga has its PowerPC.  Everyone of us owes Phase 5 a lot of
gratitude for that.  Because it was them who steered the CPU-discussion
into the right direction.  Through their PowerUP&uml;-boards they ensure
that the Amiga will regain its rightful position at the top of technology.

The PowerPC-technology offers a maximum of technological security for the
future.  Under the banner of their motto "NO RISC NO FUN", Motorola have
already taken the first step that Intel processors have yet to make.   Due
to this decision, CPUs with a clock speed of up to 350 MHz are now
available.  And a limit to this is not in sight.

Hardware-development is only one side of the coin in this respect.  Without
the appropriate software even the very best hardware is not really worth
much.  Therefore the biggest burden is currently carried by software
developers all over this world.  They are pondering the question whether
porting their software to the PPC will pay off.  Switching to a new CPU
involves porting and maintaining the software for two different kinds of
CPU.  It is due to this fact that many software developers (despite
promising announcements) still sit back and watch the market before
starting the effort of doing a port.

What makes the right decision easier is a software-interface to the
hardware which guarantees that future hardware-developments can be utilised
by the software without changing it (it does not matter whether this
hardware will be a new PowerPC-board from a third-party manufacturer or a
PowerPC-Amiga from Amiga International Inc.).  Exactly this functionality
is offered by WarpOS which was developed on the Phase 5 dual-processor
boards by our authors Sam Jordan, Michael Rock and Jochen Becher.

WarpUP forms a so-called hardware-abstraction-layer (HAL) between the
hardware and software-applications.  This HAL guarantees the proper
function of these applications on different PowerPC-concepts.  To every
software-developer this offers a risk-free start into a new era of
software-development for the Amiga.

WarpUP forms the interface between the 68K-, PowerPC-hardware, the
68K-operating system software and the software-applications.  The premier
issue is of course to optimally exploit the speed provided by the
PowerPC-CPU while at the same time making applications as easy to port as
possible.  For the first time on the Amiga, WarpUP allows using native
PowerPC-applications as well as applications and shared libraries in mixed-
and fat-binary form.

The StormC C/C++ developer system offers the possibility to compile an
AmigaOS-application as a native PowerPC application by simply setting a
compiler option.  The necessary switching between the 68K-AmigaOS and the
PowerPC- functions is handled by the WarpOS-kernel within WarpUP.  This is
a valuable advantage for the software developer.  The reason for this is
that even a direct port of the software achieves a sufficient performance
increase.  Conceptual changes to the software only become necessary if even
the last bit is too be squeezed out of the system.

WarpUP offers the following advantages:
Highspeed communication-interface between the 68K- and PowerPC-CPU.

Entirely native multitasking, native memory management, semaphores,
list-/tag-management, signalling, message handling. 

Facultative memory protection: tasks are given the option of allocating
protected memory areas. 

Virtual signals, i.e.  signals are CPU-shared and are always redirected to
the correct CPU. 

Inter-CPU message-system: messages can be passed between the CPUs

Optimal use of the PPC-MMU and the PPC-Cache

MMU/Exception-handling support for applications

PowerSave-function that shuts down the PPC if no applications use it

PowerPC-Enforcer (protects the first page) 

Detailed crash-requester that optimally aids the developer in finding
errors

Integrated debugging system to make bug-tracking easier. 

Special support for highly optimized software such as games and demos. 

Support for Amiga-compliant applications. 

PowerPC native, mixed- and fat-binary applications and shared-libraries.

Also usable for alternative developer systems such as Modula- or
E-compilers with PowerPC-support because objects are not mandatorily
created in ELF; instead the tried and tested Amiga-compliant hunk-format
can be used as well. 

Easy installation 

Hardware-independent 

Optimal future prospects

We save the best for last, of course: WarpUP
can be obtained free of charge from Haage & Partner!  You only have to pay
your phone costs.

This is our contribution towards a brighter Amiga-future.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Statement from Wolf Dietrich, Phase5:

This is a short preliminary statement, which will be extended during the
next week and can then be found on our web site http://www.phase5.de.

phase 5 digital products is shipping the PowerUp boards as a complete
solution, consisting of the powerful dual-processor hardware and the
comprehensive PPC library and other stuff.  The PPC library is a complete
PPC native multitasking and multiprocessing kernel.  It features everything
that is necessary for all kind of software developments, even for adoption
of different or future OS versions.  The information about disadvantages
and slow communication between the two CPUs is nonsense, as our system
software provides a comprehensive message and signalling system, which even
provides protectable memory areas for each task, making PowerUp-compliant
software ready for future memory-protected OS updates or versions.

AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE FUNCTIONALITY WHICH HAAGE&PARTNER OUTLINES AND
PROMOTES IS NOTHING SPECIAL, BUT A STANDARD FUNCTIONALITY PROVIDED BY THE
PHASE 5 POWERUP SYSTEM SOFTWARE.  We simply did not make so much noise
about it.  It is also nonsense that the WarpUp software by Haage&Partner is
faster then the PowerUp system software from phase 5 digital products; this
may only be true when StormC is used for the compilation a PowerUp
application.

The WarpUp from Haage&Partner is a solution which is not compatible to the
phase 5 solution.  As it does not use the HAL that is provided by phase 5
digital products, but hacks the hardware by using an incomplete knowledge
of the hardware functionality - which has been aquired by reengineering the
phase 5 digital products software - it is most likely that it will not work
with future revision changes or different product releases of the PowerUp
series.

Furthermore, phase 5 digital products will not tolerate that an
incompatible software takes over the control of the PowerUp hardware and
prevents the user from running software that has been developed for the
PowerUp boards by phase 5 digital products as well as many other vendors. 
All software which is supplied by phase 5, and in which we have invested
lots of work and financial efforts to make the PowerUp a useful product,
would be disabled once the Haage&Partner software is installed in the
system.  That includes for example the fast CyberGL native library as well
as the MPEG video and audio decoding integrated into CGX V3.  Consequently,
third party products using such advanced functionality would not run.
USAGE OF THE THE HAAGE&PARTNER SOLUTION WOULD RESULT IN A COMPLETE
INCOMPATIBILITY MESS.  In the interest of our customers, who buy our
products with high expectations, and all our developers who expect a
completely compatible product line, we will take care that the phase 5
system software can not be disabled.

Haage&Partner has - from the beginning - rejected to use the ELF format
which phase 5 has introduced on the PowerUp boards.  The reason to choose
this widely accepted format was to open the Amiga/PowerUp development to
industry software standards.  As an example, the ELF format allows
professional development for PowerUp even on other platforms (such as
Motorola PPC systems, IBM AIX systems, even on Sun or under WindowsNT),
where high performance PPC Cross compilers are available, which integrate
far superior experience and performance; phase 5 is currently testing such
compilers which may offer the chance to accelerate software such as the
CyberGL native library and the PPC MPEG library even further.  Additonally,
soon an update for SAS/C on the Amiga can be expected, which supports
PowerUp and the ELF format.

Haage&Partner, instead, wants to establish their own "extended
Hunk-format", which may is derived from the Amiga Hunk format, but still a
new and proprietary solution.  It is a concept that forces developers to
use the only solution supporting this format - the Storm C compiler by
Haage&Partner.  Haage&Partner declares it's product being open and
Amiga-compliant - in fact, it is only open to the Haage&Partner standard
and compliant to their own software solutions.

At this point, it is important to mention that the software concepts of
phase 5 digital products have all the time been focused on developments
that open doors and smooth upgrade paths to future and completely revised
OS versions, which incorporate functionalities such as memory protection
and multi-processing (which is not supported by the Haage&Partner concept,
BTW).  This has e.g.  also been proposed to Amiga International/Gateway2000
in May this year, together with our offer for extensive technological
cooperation.  To reach such a goal, we feel it is mandatory to set today
guidelines for programming that make current Amiga/PowerUp developments
more independent from the current OS revision by clear structured and
object-oriented programming, instead of using the StormC concept of simply
recompiling older sources (this issue will be adressed in detail later). 

As the solution from Haage&Partner is not compatible and can - because of
it's proprietary software concept - not fullfill demands of professional
developers, it is very unlikely that developers will choose it.  phase 5
digital products highly recommends not to use this incompatible system, as
well as the Storm C compiler which - because of the concept - is wasting
most of the performance that the PowerUp boards can deliver (this issue
will also be adressed in detail later).

phase 5 digital products has supported Haage&partner with free developer
systems, as well as all necessary information to develop compatible
software and tools, thus enabling Haage&Partner to become a leading
software vendor.  We also held many meetings explaining our strategy and
goals to make the PowerUp a useful platform not only for a new generation
of high-performance applications, but also for the development towards a
new OS or OS version that fullfills the demands of the next century.  To
our surprise and disappointment Haage&Partner has mainly used their status
to create a replacement for the PowerUp system software which is intended
to set a standard controlled by Haage&Partner, and they even attempt to
trash the complete and comprehensive software development in which we have
spend many efforts.  At the same time, they have yet not been able to
present a stable running PowerPC application which the Amiga/PowerUp user
would have an advantage from.  We highly disregard this contraproductive
and confrontational behaviour, and will completely drop any support for
Haage&Partner as a PowerUp developer as well as for any of their products.

@node FEATURE1 "Cutting Audio CDs on an Amiga"
@toc FEATURE

==========================================================================
                       Cutting Audio CDs on an Amiga
  By Adam Hough                                        adamh@spots.ab.ca
==========================================================================

I recently picked up a Yamaha CD400T CD-ROM burner.  My initial intent was
to use the burner to cut my own data CDs, and I'm still using it for that,
but recently I've rather changed my priorities.

Yes.  Audio.  Everyone has their custom music mixes on tape, but these days
if you're like me you're rather used to being able to skip tracks that just
don't appeal to you much at a particular moment in time and for that tape
just doesn't cut it.  Besides, even with Dolby the hiss from standard tape
audio can be quite irritating.  Well, the obvious answer is to start
burning your own custom audio CD mixes.  Now, certain PC users have been
making "nya nya nya" noises about being able to do that on their machines
so in true bullheaded Amigan fashion I decided to try it out myself.

It started easily enough.  I tracked down a few pieces of software that
would allow me to accomplish the task.  On Aminet there are demo versions
of some CD-ROM burning software that do audio work in addition to data:
MasterISO (from ASIMware of Canada) and MakeCD (from a pair of shareware
authors in Germany.) I started with those.  MasterISO unfortunately was
initially unusable as the version I had did not support the Yamaha drive so
I started playing around with MakeCD.  Despite a slow start trying to
figure out what all the commands meant I soon got the hang of it and
decided to work on the first audio CD.

I used ASIMware's ASIMcdfs to pull CDDA data off music CDs and stored them
on my harddrive.  CDDA, for those who're still in the dark, is the format
in which audio is encoded on audio CDs.  It rather predictably stands for
Compact Disk Digital Audio.  Then I loaded those tracks into MakeCD and cut
my first CD, "Diva".  You can probably guess the content (although Annie
Lennox doesn't appear on it.)

Shortly after that the full version of MasterISO turned up (mail order is a
wonderful thing) so I decided to cut a second CD with it, this time
focusing on instrumental works.  Again I dumped the CDDA to disk and
started work.  MasterISO's interface is a little less intuitive than
MakeCD's but it is functional none the less.  As MakeCD in its demo form
only allows up to 10 tracks and this CD had 15 tracks I didn't have much
choice.  On cutting the CD I found a significant problem with my process of
grabbing from assorted CDs.  With the first one I'd been lucky -- as I'd
only been using contemporary rock CDs for source material, the volume level
was consistent.  With the instrumental tracks I was pulling from a variety
of sources, they weren't.  This means that a relatively loud track (in
terms of recording level) lead to a quiet one (also in terms of recording
level) and so on.  A number of tracks also started as a continuation of a
previous track, so they seemed rather abrupt when starting.  The result
didn't sound very good.

So I began my search for an audio editor capable of editing CDDA.  To cut a
long story short: there isn't one.  So I started looking for alternates
based on the fact that ASIMcdfs had the capability to pull off audio in
AIFF, MAUD and one or two other formats in addition to CDDA.  AudioLab16r2
was highly recommended by people and supported AIFF.  I'm sure it is indeed
excellent but I couldn't even figure out how to edit a sample.  Then I
moved over to SinED.  Again, it looked good, but the author hadn't
implemented any form of virtual memory in it.  As the average five minute
audio track takes up about 60MB or so, that was not acceptable.  I then
went through just about everything else I could find.  They either were
purely 8 bit, didn't support the formats I needed or were reliant on custom
hardware that I didn't have.  At this point I was getting close to packing
it all in.

Except I'd not counted on AMUC [Adam's Calgary-based Amiga user group],
that wonderful resource.  One AMUCcer, John Lees, had a Studio16/AD516
combo that he wasn't using so he was willing to lend it to me.  For those
who've not been looking at high end audio equipment on the Amiga (probably
most of us), this is about as good as it gets.  When available commercially
a few years ago, the AD516 sold for about $1500 American.  In terms of
capability and software/hardware integration many PC users who've migrated
from the Amiga still wish there was something similar for the PC.  Anyway,
the hardware is indeed excellent, but the software is a little on the old
side now.  It's not terribly CyberGraphics capable -- waveforms are mapped
to the background colour and so become invisible (making editing very hard)
and the entire program runs incredibly slowly.  However under DBLNTSC on
the internal chipset it runs very speedily.  Go figure.  It is however
nicely 060 compatible (yay) but since almost all of the functionality of
the software is based around the board's DSP the processor is almost
irrelevant.

Studio16 (the software side) is very capable.  While not CDDA compatible it
is 16 bit AIFF-able so served my purposes admirably.  It has a nice
waveform editor able to edit stereo waveforms (admittedly split into two
simultaneous mono waveforms.) For those of you familiar with older products
like Oxxi's AudioMaster the idea is quite simple -- you select areas of the
waveform you want to edit and then perform one of the many specified
operations such as cutting, volume edits, fades and so on.  More
importantly it can handle large audio files (up to 2 GB) without needing a
corresponding amount of memory.

Then it occurred to me that instead of just a sample editor I now had a
full audio sampling board.  And I had a whole slew of vinyl records that
I'd been unable to track down on CD.  After some significant hardware
moving (as in physically carring stuff around the house in search of a 240v
socket; don't ask) I connected the Amiga up to the record turntable and
started digitising.  At first I tried digitising whole sides of records but
had to stop after seeks through the 200+MB files were taking ridiculous
times.  Again AMUC came to the aid.  Bryan Ewert (another AMUCcer)
mentioned that perhaps an MS-DOS format filesystem might work better than
AmigaDOS's FFS for this sort of thing.  So I reformatted a Jaz disk to
MS-DOS and watched seeks go from extremely slow (we're talking about 90
seconds here) to instantaneous.  This then allowed me to record an entire
side and then cut the resulting sample into its component sections.  Those
I then edited them for running time and content ("it used to be King Lear")
and ensured that starting and ending level on each audio track were zero --
otherwise I'd end up with an abrupt audio hiss starting the track.

Part of the editing involved removing hiss and pops and other audio
glitches inherent in a vinyl source.  Pops are little spikes that result
from scratches on the record of static hitting the needle and are easy to
remove (assuming you can find them rather than just hear them.) Hiss is
harder and I've not found (as of yet) a way to remove it without killing
the high range of the audio.  If anyone has any ideas, please feel free to
share them with me.  EasyCD Pro (or any other PC based product) is *not* an
acceptable answer!

There were some interesting side effects from deciding to use MSDOS as the
file system.  The first one which took me ages to find out was that if I
chose a file name longer than 6 characters for the base name, Studio16 hung
on recording.  Studio16 adds "_L" and "_R" to the samples for each of the
audio channels; with more than 6 characters already that breaks the 8.3
rule and the software gets confused resulting in a reboot to clear it.  The
other problem was more minor.  When editing a waveform and cutting and
pasting to another sometimes the new file would go one letter over
resulting in one audio channel overwriting the other.  Mono is nice (I
suppose) but it wasn't what I wanted...

I did have a few crashes on cutting sections from the audio sample but
they've been rare and fortunately have not resulted in any data being lost.

Ok, so now we enter the endgame: cutting the newly digitized and edited
audio out to CD.  As mentioned previously MakeCD had a limit of 10 tracks
and I was cutting more so I started using MasterISO.  MasterISO
unfortunately has a major flaw in its audio cutting routines.  It drops a
blip right at the start of the track (you don't want this) and roundabout
3-4 seconds in to the each track a second audible glitch (this you most
definitely don't want.) I didn't realise this (neither does ASIMware I'd
imagine) and burnt a couple of coasters before I discovered where the
problem lay.  As a test I then burnt a 9 track CD via MakeCD using the same
audio data and it was glitch free.  Not a happy camper was I.

The following day Bryan decided to cut his own CD using data we'd
digitized.  Being a PC kind of person, while digitizing the audio via
Studio16 on the Amiga, he'd done all his editing on a PC using CoolEdit96
in 16 bit WAV format and then brought it back to the Amiga on the Jaz.  We
used ASIMware's AudioThunder to convert from WAV to CDDA only to find that
it generated a file the wrong size to record to CD.  A second try converted
the audio file to 16 bit AIFF which MakeCD can handle.  We then ran the
data through a test before going onto the main cutting only to discover
that in the demo of MakeCD 10 tracks is the limit per MakeCD session, not
CD.  Notch up another coaster.  In the end we did cut a successful audio CD
and from what I've heard back from Bryan it's working just fine (on audio
CD players, CD-ROM players and so on.)

Certainly the CDs I have cut for myself sound really clear and accurate as
the vinyl masters I took them from were in good condition.  Obviously a
properly mastered commercial CD will sound better, but the results after
editing do sound quite excellent.  I've not totalled up the cost of all the
hardware and software involved in this little project yet, but I'm sure
it's rather high.  It does work, and it works well.  Blank CD-Rs cost
between CDN$6-25 and I tend to use the cheaper ones.  They've worked for me.
[In the US, some stores are offering CD-Rs for $2 and under.  You can find
rebate deals which even make them free. -Jason]

As my registered copy of MakeCD has just turned up I'm looking forward to
the upgrade which adds DAO (Disk at Once) to the existing TAO (Track at
once.) The former is far more common these days as it allows one track to
segue straight into the next; TAO leaves a mandatory 2-3 seconds between
tracks meaning that live albumns or ones with crossfades between tracks are
not possible.

Happy audio burning!

Addendum:

1) The MakeCD guys have no idea what caused the problem with the 10 track
limit; they can't duplicate it, and I don't want to :)

2) The MasterISO guys have found the sound glitch problem and it's a Yamaha
firmware bug.  Use 128k buffers instead of 512k ones to get around it.

3) AudioThunder really doesn't pad out CDDA files to the proper size.  It's
not an accident and apparently will be changed in the next update.

4) Using CyberGraphix v3 the waveform in Studio16 reappears so it's purely
a problem in v2.

                      People Who Work Harder Than Me.
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Profilee: Katherine Nelson, Assistant Editor, Amiga Report

The idea for this feature, which I plan to make a regular appearance in AR,
was borne out of two observations.

First, profiling hard-working Amiga community members is fun to do and it
makes fun, rewarding reading.  I know that sometimes the Amiga community is
a downer--don't lie, at one point or another you've been bummed out by
something or other during the rich pageantry of the Amiga's recent history.
Hearing about the people who work to keep it enjoyable and rewarding is a
nice change sometimes from the doom and gloom crowd on your favorite
newsgroup.

Secondly, I get e-mail from time to time from people who thank me for all
the hard work I do.  Which I'm usually reading while sitting around being
lazy.  Don't get me wrong, I like to hear it, but on the other hand there
are people out there working harder than me who deserve some recognition as
well.  Hardware designers, programmers, webmasters, and just all around
enthusiasts who do good work and don't always get the recognition they
deserve.

To launch the feature, I thought I'd start close to home--with AR's
assistant editor, Katherine Nelson.

Katie joined the magazine as the assistant editor shortly after I took over
as editor in 1994 when I discovered that trying to be the head writer AND
the news and product gatherer AND the AmigaGuide editor was a whole lot of
work that I wasn't up to doing.  She stepped in and volunteered to take
over much of the actual assembly and maintenance of the magazine.  When a
writer sends me an article, I look it over and maybe make some changes, but
9 times out of 10 it's Katie who does the formatting to get it into the
magazine itself.  When BBSes and dealers are added and changed, she does
the work--and it sounds like nothing, but when I think of the hundreds of
entries made and dropped over the years, it really adds up.

She was responsible for AR's design change in 1995--a layout so nice it was
even appropriated by a rival online magazine for a time.  (Without her, you
would have been stuck with the much more boring old layout, because I'm not
the type to come up with things like that.)

Now, after months of work, Katie is across the room finishing up the new
graphical HTML interface and look for AR.  99% of the graphics and layout
were her doing--my job was to say "Yes, that looks good."  "No, I liked the
first one you showed me better."  "I really don't care--do whichever is
less work for you."  It's really amazing how much time she's put into it
and I know for a fact that I never could have finished such a project.
Frankly, I love the way the magazine is going to look--and it's all due to
her hard work, while I sat here screwing around with emulators and whatever
else I did that seems so trivial now.

Amiga Report would never be where it is today without the constant
thankless work of my assistant editor.  I am grateful to her for all of her
hard work--and hope that it isn't too much to ask of you that the next time
you enjoy an issue of AR, that you remember the person who REALLY makes it
possible.

Next issue: Honorable Mention gets paid to a couple of webmasters who seem
to me like they do more work than I do on any given day of the week.
Except maybe deadline. :)

===========================================================================
           Confessions Of an RC5 Co-Conspirator: A Virtual Diary
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

-  Someone on IRC asked me today if I wanted to help out in cracking RC5.
I have no idea what he meant.  He tried to explain it to me.  It sort of
sounds like people are working on cracking encryption methods--probably
because they don't like the American government's attitude towards
encryption system importation and exportation.  Whatever, sounds
complicated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  This RC5 thing came up again.  More people are talking about it--I'm
gathering that it's nothing illegal, it's some sort of sponsored contest.
But working on cracking an encryption system sounds a little complex.
There are massive massive tomes on cryptography--my roommate even has one.
"Applied Cryptography."  It competes with some phone books I've seen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Now these RC5 guys want me to talk about their project in the magazine.
Ok, so now I've visited a website or two (http://rc5.distributed.net)
(http://homepage.cistron.nl/~ttavoly/rc5/) and have found out that it
doesn't really require you know anything about anything.  See, the idea is
that there are all these encrypted keys out there: 2^56 of them, in fact.
You can run a client on your computer to try to find the secret key.  If
you do that, everybody on the team who was working with you gets pizza
money or something like that.  But I don't know.  I'm a little leery of
just running some net client because someone told me so...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Ok, these RC5 guys won't leave me alone.  I've been asked no less than
24 times to run the client and do an article about it in AR.  Nobody seems
to have had their system invaded as a result of the client, and the whole
thing does look pretty legit.  So, all right, all right already.  I'll
follow the procedure on the web site, benchmark my machine for their
statistics, and go ahead and start running...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Now that I've hacked a few code blocks...well, not really hacked them
personally, but now that I've let my machine's CPU time be hogged a bit by
this RC5 client, maybe I'll look into this a bit more.  I'm a little
disappointed that this is the "Amiga" RC5 effort but in the name of
advancing the cause (and getting the Amiga name moved higher and higher on
the list of top code hacking teams), non-Amiga machines are beig liberally
employed in the effort.  You can run these clients on PCs and high-end Unix
workstations, too...and let's just say that most of those machines are
pulling down more KKeys per second than my 060 card is.

   Ugh, now they've got me talking technical.  "KKeys per second" is the
rate at which your computer is testing the keys to try to find the secret
one.  "KKeys" is short for "kilokeys", in other words, how many thousands
of keys per second.  My machine does about 100 KKeys/s: 100,000 keys per
second.  Sounds like a lot, right?  First think about how much 2^56 is,
then 100,000 per second doesn't sound very good anymore...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Well, this is it.  I've got the RC5 client running in a shell in the
background.  It's about 10% through a new block of keys, and it really
isn't taking up CPU time--I can type here, carry on in IRC, browse the web,
etc.  I need to remember to break out of it with a control-C before I turn
off the computer though, just to make sure all the hard work is saved.

   So, if you spend a lot of time aimlessly online, or might want to start,
putting your Amiga to work on the RC5 project is a good way to feel a bit
productive.  And the guys who run the Amiga RC5 effort will be happy--happy
that I wrote this article, and happy that by the time you read it, the
Amiga team might have broken into the top 10 teams in the international
effort.  It's an impressive feat--a ragtag group of Amiga junkies and guys
with access to faster machines with a soft spot for Amigas have banded
together to form one of the largest volunteer armies of spare CPU cycles in
the world.  I imagine you could make a movie like Toy Story this way, too.
But it would probably be harder to motivate people.

       The Emulation Rambler: Useful and Ridiculous Emulator Tricks
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Rather than profile any specific emulator in this issue, I'd like to
explore a few highlights and "dubious-lights" of what you can do with
emulators on the Amiga.  Next issue: FUSION 2.0 gets the works, and a look
at what PC-Task 4.3 promises to add to our PC emulation repertoire.

Stick It To Microsoft!
----------------------

Ah yes.  You've already told the PC industry what it can go do with itself
by buying PCx, PC-Task, or maybe a second-hand bridgeboard.  But how to get
around Microsoft?  It seems that the best you can do is find an old copy of
MS-DOS somewhere...but wait!

Caldera has purchased the rights to Novell DOS, formerly known as DR DOS,
which is now called OpenDOS.   And...wait for it...Caldera has made OpenDOS
free to most comers!  (If you're planning to use OpenDOS commercially,
they'll gladly sell you a license.)  But for regular old evaluation or
educational use, OpenDOS is yours for the asking.

At www.caldera.com, OpenDOS can be yours by simply filling out a short
questionnaire for the folks at Caldera to look at.  (Mostly, they want to
know if you want to hear about their Linux products.)  Then you get a
passcode and the ability to download the encrypted OpenDOS archive.  There
is a slight catch in that you need a previously bootable DOS in order to
de-archive the OpenDOS archive...a bit of a snag for getting completely
around Microsoft, although you can always carry out this part of the
operation on some other machine which has already paid its dues.  Once
installed, OpenDOS functions virtually the same as MS-DOS.  There are a few
quirks and additional features available:  OpenDOS has built-in
task-switching and multitasking, for starters.  Neither work quite 100%
with PCx and PC-Task, although they're worth investigating.  PCx has a
couple of issues that I've found--the special PCXANSI driver seems to be
incompatible and a video bug occurs when exiting most applications to DOS.
Microcode Solutions was unaware of OpenDOS until my bug report to them, but
they assured me that they are working on the problems.  The author and
publisher of PC-Task 4 have been informed of their program's clashes with
OpenDOS, but have not yet replied.

Both get strange video blackouts when task switching is enabled--curiously
enough, the solution Jim Drew of Microcode Solutions suggested I use for
PCx only worked for PC-Task: blindly entering a "CLS" to reset the video
display.  There may be some additional issue on my machine keeping it from
working properly for PCx.

OpenDOS also offers a DOS-based HTML 3 web browser dubbed WebSpyder.  We'll
take a look and tell you how it fares next issue, as well as keep you up to
date on how well the PC emulators are handling OpenDOS.  I've installed it
to both of my emulation partitions and haven't looked back.


Two Ridiculous Things Done With Emulation
-----------------------------------------

We all know that emulation can lead to some crazy notions.  Of course,
there's the classic "run UAE on UAE" (which works), or the oft-practiced
"Run Shapeshifter on UAE" (because the PC barely has a decent Mac
emulator, and that only recently).  But just iterating two common emulators
isn't truly novel.  No, to be really ridiculous takes some hard work.  Here
are some examples I've come across, in no particular order:

- A64's GEOS emulation mode.  Don't get me wrong, I don't have a death wish
for C64 GEOS.  It's actually ok once you get some decent speed into it.
The real problem with this GEOS implementation was that it only ran on
68000 Amigas, meaning that you got no major benefits over running on a real
64.  If it had supported 030s and 040s, it would have been worthwhile, but
it was just another misguided effort from A64's author.

- The Gameboy Infocom interpreter.  For those of you unfamiliar with the
technology behind the Infocom text games, Infocom was able to port them to
so many platforms because what they did was to establish a specification
for a mythical computer called the "Z-Machine" and then emulate it on
various computers ranging from 8-inch floppy CP/M computers all the way up
to Amigas.  These emulators all read the same game data file.  So in
effect, playing an Infocom game involves using an emulator.  Implementing
this emulator on a Gameboy took some real gall--and, of course, you can use
it on a Gameboy emulator.  (So far, I've only had success with AmigaVGB by
ignoring the CRC checking.  AmiGameBoy and WzonkaLad seem not to be able to
actually give a display, although it sometimes is visible for a second when
breaking out of the emulator.
)
With this 8k of Gameboy code, you're able to play almost all of the Infocom
games and even some new creations on a Gameboy or emulator, on a 39 wide by
9 row text screen.  You use the directional pad and buttons to select
letters "high-score style", but a neat feature lets you pick words off of
the display as well.  It's beyond ridiculous--but it's very, very clever.

Come On, Amiga MAME, Catch Up!
------------------------------

The latest version of MAME, the multi-machine arcade emulator, supports
such classics as Tron and Spy Hunter.  Our port is still one revision
behind.  Come on!

Things You Should Own For Emulation
-----------------------------------

Here's a brief, and not by any means exhaustive, summary of the sort of
hardware you might want to have if you're going to approach emulating a
certain machine or platform.

PC and Mac emulation hopefuls should get a CD-ROM drive or high density
floppy drive.  Preferably both. 

Mac emulators match up pretty well for CPU power, so you need a CPU as
powerful as the Mac you want to emulate--although video is a different
issue.  If you don't have a graphics card and can't afford one or don't
have a good way to hook one up, you should at least have AGA and a lot of
memory to burn.

PC emulators require a lot of CPU power and work better (PCx and PC-Task 4)
when given lots of memory.

To get good Apple II emulation on an Amiga is simple--030/25.  That buys
you about 100% performance using any Amiga system.

64 emulation, in my opinion, is best done through Frodo if you have the
machine for it--and that would be an 060 with graphics card.  Magic64 is
pretty good for reliability with a somewhat slower machine, but Frodo's
color choices are a lot better, I feel.

Gameboy emulation can be pulled off on 030 machines.

Atari 2600 emulation: Trust me, you want a fast machine.  It seems ironic,
I know.

                      Review: Formula One Grand Prix
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Another entry in the Guildhall Leisure republication line of old Microprose
titles, this is the game that has created a lasting legend among Amiga
users.

Formula One Grand Prix, or F1GP as its fans refer to it, was originally
produced in 1991 by Geoff Crammond of Stunt Car Racer fame.  Race games
always scare me.  I've got a lot of arcade game experience under my belt,
and usually impress friends at how quickly I can learn the rules and
gameplay of just about anything I find.  A big exception is race games.
Typically, the more realism a game offers, the worse off I am.  I could
fling around the courses of Pitstop and Pitstop 2 on the 64 fairly well,
but Pole Position and up had me stumped.  Virtual Karting was a particular
low point for me--I couldn't get anywhere to save my life in that game.
Anything more taxing than XTR usually is too much.

So imagine my intimidation level when the F1GP manual tells me how it is
more of a simulation than a game.  Great, that's all I need, the realistic
implementation of high-speed cigars of death on supersmooth roads.  You'll
forgive me for saying so, but that seems to me what Formula One racing
is.

F1GP puts you in the cockpit of a race car with the authentic spread of
1991 F1 circuits at your beck and call, for individual racing or a
championship season.  Qualifying, practice runs, pit stops, they're all
here, right down to technical issues of tire...excuse me, tYre types and
wing adjustments.  A great deal of attention has been paid to detail--much
of the manual is a primer on the F1 circuit, racing strategy, and the cars
and their history.  For a die-hard F1 fan most of this will be old hat--for
an American, where F1 in particular and auto racing in general is not the
most popular of sports (particularly since I'm not in the American South),
it made some interesting reading.

The game lets you control your car using digital joystick, keyboard, or
analog joystick.  Using digital joystick can be difficult for a precision
driving game, but I found it workable.  It's a small shame that
multi-button Amiga joysticks were not in use at the time since it could
have made things a bit easier.

Fortunately for weaklings like me, Crammond made the game very playable for
mere mortals.  A number of "driving aids" are supplied.  When all enabled,
driving the F1 car is pretty much just a matter of steering along a dotted
line in the road--the computer handles speed and gear for you.  You can
progressively enable or disable these as you see fit, even on the fly
during the course of the race.  To get the full respect and admiration of
the game and your peers, you'll need to race without any help
whatsoever--very difficult until you get familiar with the game and know
the tracks intimately, which is what the manual keeps insisting you do,
just like the real life F1 drivers.

The game aims for accuracy and tries to give you the real-life cockpit
view, which means you get rear-view mirrors and your dead-ahead
perspective--although you can get a trackside view and the view from other
pilot's perspectives.

Once I got the hang of the game I was pretty happy with it--but I'm still
not ready to really drive well without any help from the computer.

1991 means ECS, a game styled for pretty stripped down machines.  4
floppies which are HD installable (although the installer is a pretty silly
one which insists on putting the game in your SYS: directory).  Runs with
little to no coaxing on modern hardware.  Interestingly enough, the game
was designed to run in NTSC.  It runs fine on 060s--the only bad part is
that looking at the graphics and detail you know that the 060 (and even
some lower processors) feel like they have both hands tied behind their
backs.

I actually enjoy F1GP, which surprised me somewhat.  I do think that the
thrill can and will wear down, particularly for those F1 fans who don't
want to play with the heroes of yesteryear.  This is the neat part of
F1GP--Oliver Roberts' F1GPEd.  This little piece of shareware digs into the
F1GP executable (or your copy running in memory) and lets you customize
virtually everything about the game, as well as making improvements to the
game's logic and its overall challenge (for those who find it a breeze
after some practice.)  Highly recommended as a companion piece.  With
F1GP's budget price, the US$15 Roberts asks isn't that much more.  Roberts
also presides over an ongoing competition of other F1GP addicts--it's
things like this that keep a game interesting 6 years later.

I don't know that F1GP has made me get over my problem with racing games,
but I do know a solid, enjoyable effort when I see one.

                         Review: UFO Enemy Unknown
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

An equally appropriate title for this game would have been "Laser Squad
Goes To Roswell."  A production by some of the same people who brought the
80s 8-bit and Amiga classic Laser Squad to life, UFO is a strategic combat
and planning game which pits you, the director of a secret anti-UFO
multinational organization, against the combined forces of aliens who are
bent on converting, subverting, and annihiliating the population of Earth.

A game that is as many things as UFO is sometimes is best described with
some very up front and direct assessments.

- UFO is not for the impatient.
- UFO is not for those who cringe when they hear the word "strategy" (or at
the very least, not for those who cringe with good reason, rather than
simply not having ever given it a try.)
- UFO is not non-stop action and alien blasting fun--although there's
plenty of that.

To really enjoy UFO takes patience and dedication.  It's not an easy job
you've been handed.  Not only are the aliens rather better equipped than
you are to start with, but they typically have the strategic advantage over
you at the beginning of the game.  Until your surveillance equipment
blankets the Earth, you're likely to only hear about an alien in Earth's
skies until they've attacked a city--and then they're holding the ground.

UFO takes place in two major modes.  One is the "planning and waiting"
mode, which gives you access to a map of the world and the ability to
create, maintain, and upgrade your UFO X-Com facilities.  (You're in charge
of X-Com.)  At first, your budget is a major constraint, but nonetheless
you have to hire personnel and build rooms that will make your job easier.

The other is the strategic combat mode.  This is where the game shows its
Laser Squad roots, although the old engine has had some polishing up.  You
command a squad of specially trained soldiers in a 3D-isometric map, often
on search-destroy-capture missions.  The 3D view, while prettier than Laser
Squad and offering such amenities as line-of-sight, multiple heights, the
ability to kneel and take cover, is overall more difficult than the old LS
interface simply because getting a clear shot can be much tougher with
everything taken into account.  I found myself getting wasted early and
often.

As the game progresses, you learn more about the aliens and alien
technology.  There's a sort of storyline running through the game, although
of course at first you're just focusing on your own survival while trying
to do your job well enough to keep the money rolling in.

I honestly wish I was better at planning strategic combat.  I still get
pasted by my friends in Laser Squad, and the computer-controlled aliens in
UFO have a field day with me most of the time--although I do get lucky
sometimes.  UFO is going to require that you be better than me to get the
fullest out of the game.

Guildhall's republished version comes on a few floppies with a printed
manual (black and white rather than the color of Microprose's original
manual, but otherwise identical.)  The game has absolutely terrific
atmosphere--the graphics and music are chilling and disturbing, exactly
what they should be for such a game.  A fast machine will come in handy for
the game although you can get by with an 020.  Guildhall is republishing
both AGA and ECS versions of the game.

UFO is not particularly graphics-board compatible but is 060 compatible.
The game is HD installable and runs from the WB.  Documentation protection
exists, and you're provided with a manual just like Microprose's, but in
black and white only.

Note: Microprose made two additional X-Com games for the PC, one focusing
on underwater lifeforms, and the latest, Apocalypse, dealing with all of
humanity crammed into one last mega-city which you have to defend from
aliens.  Given that having all of humanity crammed into a single city is a
pretty crappy way to live anyway, I think X-Com Apocalypse makes playing
UFO Enemy Unknown a real downer--why bother defending the planet if that's
how the X-Com universe ends up anyway?  I really hate sequels sometimes...

@node REVIEW4 "ArtEffect 2.0"

===========================================================================
                            Review: ArtEffect 2
                            By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Don't blink--you might miss a shift in the Amiga graphics product market.
For the past few years now, starting I'd say with Photogenics, the Amiga
software customer has been flooded with options.  Image processing programs
have become all the rage.  Relative newcomer ArtEffect has taken up an
interesting position with its version 2: it's now just about as expensive
as professional favorite ImageFX, is more accessible and available than
aging but still good AdPro, and even offers a feature or two that the other
guys don't have.

ArtEffect is marketed heavily on being a Photoshop clone.  This is a bit of
a stretch if you're talking about features, but it does have a heavily
graphical/window based interface, something ImageFX 2.6 doesn't offer.  The
interface is pleasingly simple to look at, although this might seem
deceptive if you're accustomed to being overwhelmed by on-screen options.

ArtEffect is geared towards 24-bit work and runs quite well under
CyberGraphX.  I have heard reports that it is non-functional under
Picasso96.  AGA 256-color and HAM8 modes can be used, although HAM8 can get
very slow very fast.  

The first place to start with any image editor is loading.  ArtEffect can
load a decent although not exhaustive array of common image formats, but
straight out of the box it is very limited in what it can save out to--IFF
and JPEG being the notably useful ones.  To expand your image load/save
capabilities you need the SuperView plugin for ArtEffect, available for
about US$45.

Once you're that far, of course, now you have to put that $200 or so you
just spent to good use.  As an image conversion package, ArtEffect will
do the job (and now that ArtEffect 2 has added ARexx, you could conceivably
automate the process of batching a collection into JPEG or GIF or IFF).
ArtEffect does not really offer any cataloguing features, but there are
other programs which will take care of that for you.

ArtEffect, like any good image processor, has to perform not just on image
conversions, but on manipulations.  The basic color balance level changes
are available, good for importing images from a source and touching them
up.  ArtEffect offers scanner plug-in capability, so this sort of work
would be your next likely step after a successful scan.  But if you're
looking to go further, into design and graphics work, you'll want to take
advantage of ArtEffect's filters and the implementation of layers, unique
among Amiga graphical packages.

Layers provide you the ability to approach an image not as a single flat
surface on which to apply effects and transformations, but as up to three
sandwiched "layers" which overlay each other, either completely opaquely or
with some degree of translucency.  ArtEffect allows you to use just three
layers at a time, the functional minimum for seriously getting any use from
layers.  The concept has been used successfully in Photoshop for some
time--this is one of the areas where a somewhat legitimate comparison
between the two can be made.  But three layers isn't much--while an
included tutorial shows how they can be used effectively, it's always
frustrating to see arbitrary imposed limits.  Hopefully memory will be the
only barrier in the future.

Layers can only be created--they cannot be "pulled" from an existing image.
The exception is the special IFF format you can save while working in
ArtEffect which will preserve your layers.  Any other format requires
combining all of your layers into one for the save.  Layers can also be
merged at any time, freeing up a layer to add another effect.

ArtEffect's filters are the power effects you'll spend your time in once
you're done converting or gamma correcting images.  These are your "special
FX", the things that make image processors fun and can produce stunning
results.  ArtEffect comes with a good sample, although some of the more fun
effects come in the special plug-in add on packs for US$45.  Many effects
are very dramatic, reminiscent of the current trend for PC and Mac users to
want to "cartoonize" every image they come across.  The most impressive
facet of ArtEffect's filter system is that the preview windows which come
up when an effect is called are interacting--multiple effects will cascade
their results in corresponding filter windows and update automatically.
This is very useful for getting a hold of what your final image will look
like.  Multiple level undo is indispensible as well--luckily, it's in this
version of ArtEffect.

For all that's nice about ArtEffect, I'm a little turned off by the price.
I realize that ImageFX does not seem to be the most intuitive program in
the world, but I've seen what it can do when used by someone familiar with
the system--and I know that the effects are superior to those offered in
ArtEffect.  So when the price of the two packages is now virtually
identical, and ArtEffect actually requires that you spend MORE money in
order to get even close to the amount of effects and supported image
formats, I have to caution you.  If it's serious work you're looking to do,
ImageFX is still the way to go.  ArtEffect is probably going to be more
instantly gratifying to someone, and it is certainly nicer to look at and
more CyberGraphX-friendly, but for the price you could be doing better.

ArtEffect 2 ships with the documentation from ArtEffect 1, plus an
AmigaGuide update file.  Haage and Partner provides very good customer
support and frequently releases update patches.

                        Amiga Report Mailing List
===========================================================================

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to majordomo@ninemoons.com

Your subject header will be ignored.  In the body of the message, enter

subscribe areport

The system will automatically pull your e-mail address from the message
header.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!             **

                          UUDecoding Amiga Report
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

                      Amiga Report Writing Guidelines
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

     4.  Please send us your article in ASCII format.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.

Please stipulate as well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to
the editor.

                    CalWeb: The Home of the Amiga Zone!
===========================================================================

AMIGA ZONE MOVES TO CALWEB!

THE AMIGA ZONE MOVES FROM PORTAL TO CALWEB INTERNET SERVICES

For over ten years the Amiga Zone has been an online resource, home,
community, oasis, for Amiga owners.

For over ten years I've made my living running the Zone and supporting Amiga
users all over the USA, Canada, and the world.

Five years ago when American People/Link pulled their own plug, we had to
find the Zone a new home and we found a good one on the Portal Online
System. 

Well, it's happened again.. Portal has informed all of its customers that
its ten year history as an online service and Internet provider is coming to
an end on Sept. 30, 1996.  This is very sad, it's short-notice, and the
decision is completely out of my control, but it's also irreversible.  

Portal is changing its entire business plan from being an ISP to selling an
accounting system to other online services.  

So be it. It's sad, but like I said, the Zone went through this before and
now we'll go through it again, and come out the other side better and wiser.

THE AMIGA ZONE IS MOVING TO CALWEB INTERNET SERVICES.

CalWeb (http://www.calweb.com) is a two year old Internet provider located
in Sacramento, CA.  It has a good sized customer base, and very
knowledgeable support staff. 

It's also run by a long time Amiga owner who has been a friend of mine for
many years.

The world of modeming has changed much in the last ten years.  In 1985 you
had very few choices and you had 1200 baud.  These days, everyone and his
dog has an ISP running and a web page

But the vast majority of those providers don't know an Amiga from a hole in
the ground, and could care less about Amiga owners.  Say "AWeb" or
"IBrowse" to them and they'll say "Omega?  Amoeba?  What?  Huh?  They still
make those things?"

CalWeb is different because it's the new home of the Amiga Zone.

In October 1996, a new custom front-end menued system will be added to
CalWeb to host the Zone.  It'll have features for Zone users that neither
Plink nor Portal ever had nor were they willing to add.

The tradition of a friendly online Amiga community, run by long time Amiga
owners, users and lovers will continue. 

Message bases, huge file libraries (we plan to move over the 20,000+ files
we have on the Zone on Portal to CalWeb, MANY of which you'll never see on
Aminet or anywhere else), live nightly chats, vendor support and our famous
prize contests will continue.

We've given away tens of thousands of dollars worth of Amiga prizes in the
last ten years.  No one else even comes close. 

I urge any and all of you who were on Plink, or who are now on Portal or
who may have left Portal..  or even if you were never on either but used or
still use another online service to join CalWeb for the Amiga Zone.  I
personally promise you the best online Amiga community we can possibly
build.  You will not be disappointed.


CalWeb has arranged a special signup offer for you!

Call:
 1-800-509-9322
  or
 1-916-641-9320
  or telnet to calweb.com, login as "guest", and follow the prompts. 

You can join CalWeb for US$19.95 flat, a month.

CalWeb takes major credit cards or you can establish a monthly invoiced
account if you don't have plastic.

The signup is FREE.

To get this deal you must say "THE AMIGA ZONE SENT ME" when you call or
signup online. 

I hope to see lots of you join CalWeb.  You can telnet into it from
anywhere for no hourly charges at all.  Your $19.95/mo fee covers
everything and also gets you ten meg of storage which includes hosting your
own personal web page.  Naturally, when the Zone opens there, you'll have
unlimited use of all of its features and areas.  Never a "money meter"
clock to worry about.

Your personal or business CalWeb Web pages are maintained by you via FTP. 
It's pretty slick.  You can make a net connection to the server with any
Amiga FTP client, put your files onto it, the permissions are automatically
set (no "chmod-ing" required!) and flip to your running browser and see the
changes instantly.

The Amiga Zone's new home is already up at:

         http://www.amigazone.com

running on CalWeb's server.  Ckeck it out!

Please feel free to write to me at harv@amigazone.com or harv@cup.portal.com
if you want more information.

Remember to say "THE AMIGA ZONE SENT ME!" when you join.

A splendid time is guaranteed for all.  

Please plan to join us in the Amiga Zone on CalWeb!
