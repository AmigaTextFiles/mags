===========================================================================

I remember, a good year or so ago, there was a massive argument on Usenet
over where Amigas should get big marketing pushes.  As with just about
anything on the Amiga, you can find people at all levels of the issue.
Some favored an approach that favored large consumer stores.  They're not
exactly getting what they wanted, but it looks like the department stores
and American mega-marts may be getting Amiga technology in them whether or
not they like it or know about it.

Emerson has signed with VIScorp to exclusively distribute and sell
VIScorp's UITI set-top box, a variant of the ED technology.  Emerson plans
to use its strong sales channels to stores such as Wal-Mart and Target to
mass-market the machine.

So the fight's not over--unfortunately, there's no deal in place to put
4000Ts on the shelves of Wal-Mart yet, but this may act as a foot in the
door for the technology.  Time will tell.

I'm heading off for a short vacation (I'll be back by July 9) so try not to
break the place up too much while I'm gone.  We should be seeing the close
of the VIScorp/Escom deal soon, as Jost of Escom and Buck of VIScorp have
agreed and signed to terms.  Now their respective boards of directors have
to concur, and we'll be off and running.

July is supposed to be the slow period in computing but with Softwood
making a big push for Final Writer 5 upgrades, the deal breaking, and NTSC
A1200s starting to trickle in, things don't seem all that standstill.  Of
course, more is always better.

Enjoy AR 4.09.  See you in a couple of weeks.

Jason

From: mingleby@netspace.net.au (Michael Ingleby)
Subject: The winning edge???

Hi Jason,

After reading the excellent articles by Kermit Woodall, Sergei Nester and
Wolf Deitrich in AR4.08, I sat and pondered what the future holds for the
Amiga...

If things eventually come together the way they seem to be, then the future
may be a bit brighter than many have realised.

Faster CPUs, better graphics and 16 bit sound will finally bring the Amiga
to a position where it can proudly stand shoulder-to-shoulder with today's
hordes of wintel machines.

As I sat and wondered, a thought entered my mind: "What will give the Amiga
an extra 'edge' against the pee-cees?"...  All pee-cees have good graphics,
good sound, large hard drives, plenty of memory, serial, parallel, joystick
ports...  The Amiga has all of those (plus a superior OS), but what would
give it an edge?

Then I thought back to the Atari ST...  A nice machine, but no match for
the Amiga...  But why did it last for so long without the great graphics
and sound offered by the Amiga systems?  The answer is simple: MIDI...  I
was the only low-cost machine (not counting the CDTV!) to come standard
with MIDI IN and OUT ports...  Not a single pee-cee came stanard with MIDI
then, and the situation remains the same to this day...

With this in mind, it seems to me that any future Amiga systems (I'm
tending towards Phase-5's philosophy at this point) should come standard
with MIDI ports.  This would give it an advantage over any other systems I
can think of.  I know many people who would jump at the chance to by an
Amiga-like machine with built-in MIDI.

With the emphasis on Multimedia and Video Production, MIDI would complement
the capabilities of the new Amigas in these fields.  Look at how the Macs
have taken over in the field of audio/MIDI production.  Any future Amiga
would have the power to trounce the Apple machines in this area.  With
software such as 'SoundStudio', 16 bit audio and MIDI, the Power Amigas
would soon gain wide acceptance as the ultimate low-cost music-computer.

I'm not sure if the inclusion of MIDI has been considered, but I believe
that at this early stage of development, ALL new machines should be
designed with MIDI ports as standard.  The cost of the two 5 pin DIN
sockets and the associated controlling hardware IS negligible, compared to
the extra sales that would result form it's inclusion.

Since you're the 'collator of ideas' at VIScorp, I thought I'd send these
thoughts to you first.  I hope you can pass them on to someone who will
take note and not just pass them off as, "Not worth it".  Because it
certainly IS worth it...  Believe me, this is a great opportunity to give
the Amiga that extra 'somthing' that's missing from every pee-cee!

Thanks for your time (as always!)

And keep up the great work at VIScorp/Amiga Report!

Mike

Subject: A Letter to the Editor! Hi Jason!!!

Hi!  Recently I was in need to upgrade my old Amiga 500 and I could only
think of one thing--the Processor!  So I set out to find a better and
faster upgrade, and along the way I found out about the Motorola 68010 and
how easy it was to fit in, so I decided to get one.  After a most hardy
search for this rare chip I came to the conclusion that there was only one
place to get it, and so I rang the Australian distributors for Motorola
(VSI).

After a good chat with the StoreMan I discovered that they could not find a
68010 anywhere either!  Then low and behold they blurted out that there was
a MC68000 P12 (P12 = 12 Mhz).  Well being a curious man as i am I ordered
the minimum amount allowed of 5 at AU $14.  When I recieved them in the
post I instantly put one in the old 68000 P8 socket and low and behold my
computer ran faster!  Then I loaded up Sys Info and found No difference.
The computer didnt realise that this chip was faster by 4 Mhz. Then I
decided to use my beloved program Image FX and it ran faster as well!  Then
a friend told me that Motorola made some processors with MMU capacity
(Memory Management Unit).  Wow!  What if this litle beauty had virtual
memory!  So i checked Image FX again and turned on its virtual memory prog.
It worked and now i can get more out of this now old Dinosaur. 

My conclusion is that if you have a bog 1000,500,2000 with the old 68000
P8, change it Now.  This new one is better in Speed and the new option of
Virtual memory with No compatabitlity problems!  Trust me it's good, and
for a quarter of the price of a game who can resist!

Yours Faithfully

                Forthcoming Amigas: Open Letter From France
===========================================================================

This is an open letter to whoever plans to build new Amigas.

As for now the situation is totally unclear and seems more like a Dallas
episode than everything else.

As of Today, we know that AT is ready to build PPC Amigas, Phase5 is
building its own prototype, MacroSystems is known to think hard about
it, and Pios will build PPC Amigas.

This should be what all Amiga owner wanted, as everybody seems to like PPC
Amiga.  Major problem however is that those companies will build also new
operating system for their amiga.  Their amiga, and not for the other
companies' PPC Amigas.

I'm speaking as for now for the largest part of the French Amiga
Community,both Net users, BBS users and friends.  Chances are that all
Amiga users althrough the world feel the same way as we do.

What we want is a SINGLE operating system.  We don't want to buy in a near
future a PPC Amiga from Viscorp and find out that it is not compatible on
the software level with Phase5's Amiga, which in turn is not compatible
with PIOS's Amiga.

What we want is some sort of cooperation between those companies, as little
as possible if they want it, but cooperation anyway, for both software and
hardware.  We want a portable operating system, which can run on either
systems and we want add-ons which will work on either systems.

Perhaps this letter has no reason to exist, perhaps there's already strong
cooperation between companies, but rumors, lack of information, and even
companies official talks, tend to proove this kind of letter is necessary.

Feel free to proove us we're wrong.

Subject: An Open letter to all Amiga Enthusiasts.

 To the Managers and Amigans at VIScorp, and Amiga User Every where,

   We the members of The Cleveland Area Amiga Users Group, are interested
in the plans of VIScorp for the Amiga.  We have pledged support to the
Amiga and have expressed that support by in vesting money and time in our
machines.  We still find the Amiga our choice of computer and look forward
to the next generation of Amiga computers.  The PowerAmiga is an example of
a new generation that we would definitely be interested in purchasing.

   Many professionals and enthusiasts make up our group.  Two (and perhaps
more ) are well known in the Amiga community.  We all have an interest in
seeing the Amiga continue and would support any company endeavour to
continue producing the machines we love.  In fact we are willing to offer
our time in anyway that would be helpful to you and your efforts to create
the next generation as well as update current soft-and-hardware.  We will
share our next Journal, the Amiga-GURU that we have published for over ten
years.  In fact, last February was the tenth anniversary of our User Group.

   We look forward to hearing about your plans for the future of the Amiga
and hope that you include user groups, such as ours, in those plans.  Our
offer to help is no ploy; it is a serious commitment to con tinuing the
only computer that created a community of users rather than just
purchasers.  We hope that other User Groups and you will join with us in
renewing our community through a new generation of commitment, cooperation
and soft/hardware.

  Alexandre Thilmany                                visiteur@potaulait.be
===========================================================================

 My name is Alexandre from Belgium.  I'm a young analyst programmer of 23
and, you guess it, a 'still' lover of the amiga.  Sorry for my english.

 I don't actually have a personnal address mail.  You may answer me at this
(temporary) address for any reason : "visiteur@potaulait.be" If you answer
me, please put my name in the "Subject"

 I will try to make this mail as short as i can without forgeting my point
of view.  I think i know the computers market enough to have good ideas
about the future of the amiga.

 The reason why i do so much is because, in a few days, i'll start an
independent job based on interactive box, i hope to have a contract in a
near future to really start.  Actually, i use an amiga with Scala, but,
it's at its limit.  I want and really want to do all on amiga, but now,
becoming a pro, i need the best, and i can't forget the PC or the Mac.  So,
with my knowledge of programmer, my passion for the whole computer market
and my new activity in the 'multimedia' (i don't like this word ...) i
think that what follows is or are good ideas to take in consideration.

Let's speak technicals ...

 The PPC first.  Enough people spent too much time on this project, it's
the best choice and we don't have the time to choose another processor.
But, after the integration of the PPC, the Amiga OS should be portable on
other processors (Alpha and Intel, yes).

 CHRP : Common Hardware Reference Platform.  The new amiga must be CHRP,
and the new Amiga OS must run on a CHRP machine.  And what about the
originality of the new Amiga :

 - The worst is a PCI card containing the Amiga Custom Chipset (ACC), and
the Amiga OS can use them and the softwares can also use them.  There's
just the problem that i don't want to see other OS to be able to use the
ACC.  Only workbench can.

 But it's not a good idea because where is the amiga if it's only a Power
Mac (or any CHRP machine) with a card ?  No the new amiga must have its ACC
on the CHRP 'motherboard'.  The Amiga OS should come in two version.  A
binary version for CHRP machine and one other for Power Amiga (CHRP + ACC).
Of course, when you have a Power Amiga, you can run the two version of the
Amiga OS and you can run any OS for Power XXX.  In this way, it's thinkable
to make a PCI card for the rest of the market containing ACC ?  Our
strength will still be in the Workbench which is able to use the ACC the
best possible.

 The ACC should be a chipset that you can activate or deactivate, a second
layer after the CHRP.  But i don't have enough technicals skills to
adventure there.  What about the ACC.  The ACC must be easily upgradable
(change a chipset with a new version).  I think we need there a 68020, a
DSP (MPEG 2), a 3D processor (look at the Power VR from england), and
plenty of little specialized chipsets.  About the sound : 16 or 32 channels
in 16 bits, maybe include facilities for the new special effects (THX,
Dolby), i don't know very well this domain.  Also, an idea is to develop a
kind of a ROM disk of a minimum of 2 or 4 Megs (EEEPROM), removable and
replacable with more.  There, the user can put his most used softwares.  We
need such innovations if we want to have a 'really' better machine.

 A few words about the rest of the hardware needed : i want TV (input,
output) and a good relation with the video market.  A microphone.  I also
think about ISDN and network card integrated, but you also need not to put
too much to allow other companies to develop peripherals.

 Why CHRP is so needed ?  Everybody play with their computer.  Actually,
games on amiga are, sorry, very limited.  And why ?  Because the raw power
of the amiga is ridiculous.  But, so, why CHRP.  A new dimension in the
game domain has started since the begining of 96.  There are the online
games.  Just one example.  A young guy want to buy a computer.  Power Amiga
is the best in capacities (let's hope), BUT, the Power Amiga is not CHRP,
and as the Power Amiga is not spread in the world as the PC or Power XX,
this guy will never have the opportunity to play online games which i think
will become an huge market in the next years.  I think the major parts of
the online games will be developped on PPC, but never on the little amiga
market.  So, this reason is quite sufficient to go on PPC and to accept the
CHRP and not to come back on the question any more.

 Well, i hope this mail will be useful.  I hope for reactions.  Spread
these ideas if you agree with me, and sign your name at the bottom of the
mail and send it again to who you want.

VISCORP VALUES THE AMIGA

  System Improvements
  
     In the months ahead, VIScorp will be making substantial improvements
     to the Amiga system architecture, including both the hardware design
     and the operating system software. These advanced new systems will
     be developed not only for our upcoming Set Top Boxes, but also for
     future Amiga Desk Top Computers. VIScorp is investing considerable
     resources into engineering these improvements.
     
     One of the primary objectives of VIScorp's business plan is to
     develop, manufacture, market, and sell Amiga Desk Top Computer
     Systems.
     
  Architecture Group
  
     Many of the above improvements require an in-depth knowledge of
     specialty markets and technologies. Because of this, VIScorp made
     the decision in May 1996 to form an Architectural Design Group
     consisting of a small number of highly qualified Amiga experts.
     While this group is still in its early formation stage, we intend it
     to oversee and resolve the numerous suggestions and enhancements
     that must be addressed for the long term success of the Amiga.
     
  Technology Licenses
  
     As stated above, VIScorp will research and develop valuable
     enhancements to the architecture and technology of the Amiga,
     resulting in a wide range of next generation, price competitive
     computer products.
     
     There are, however, situations in which it makes sense for VIScorp
     to license Amiga related technology to qualified companies whose
     business objectives are consistent with VIScorp's long range plan.
     Such agreements may include binary, ROM, and documentation licenses
     for the distribution of Amiga OS upgrades, hardware and software
     system licenses for specialty markets, and possibly source code
     co-development licenses to help expand the Amiga and its feature set
     into the next decade.
     
  Property Rights Infringement
  
     It has come to our attention that several companies plan to build
     their own "compatible" or "extended" versions of the Amiga without
     obtaining the proper licensing from VIScorp. These companies will be
     placing themselves at legal risk, because their systems will
     undoubtedly infringe on Amiga intellectual property rights,
     including copyrights, patents, and trade secrets.
     
     In addition, we have recently become aware that versions of the
     Amiga System ROMs are being reproduced and distributed without
     proper licensing. This is a violation of international copyright
     law, and VIScorp will prosecute offenders to the full extent of the
     law.
     
     Realize that VIScorp is purchasing Amiga Technologies at great
     expense for ownership of precisely the above property rights and
     considers them a fundamental asset of the company. As such, VIScorp
     intends to aggressively defend its position as the owner of the
     Amiga and its related technologies. Companies that choose to violate
     the law are well advised to consider the easier and less costly path
     of obtaining a license.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Chicago, IL
June 27, 1996

   
   
VISCORP AND EMERSON RADIO CORP. SIGN LETTER OF INTENT FOR EXCLUSIVE
DISTRIBUTION BY EMERSON RADIO OF INTERACTIVE SET-TOP DEVICE AND "SMART" TV

   
   
     Visual Information Service Corp. (NASDAQ: VICP, Bulletin Board)
     ("VIScorp") and Emerson Radio Corp. (AMEX:MSN), announced today that
     they have entered into a letter of intent granting Emerson the North
     and South American exclusive distribution and sales rights to
     VIScorp's interactive Internet television set-top device, the
     Universal Internet-Television Interface(R) (UITI(R)), and the
     UITI(R)-TV interactive "smart" television set. Terms have not been
     disclosed, pending a definitive agreement. However, pursuant to the
     letter of intent, VIScorp would be granted warrants to purchase up
     to a maximum of one million shares of Emerson common stock at an
     exercise price of $6 per share. "The UITI(R) provides new and
     exciting entertainment, information and telecommunications
     capabilities using any standard television set, including easy
     access to the Internet, World Wide Web and on-line services,"" said
     William Buck, Chief Executive Officer of VIScorp. "The Emerson Radio
     branded set-top device will dramatically expand the capabilities of
     the family TV set by providing TV viewers a host of services like
     e-mail, on-line chat and Net surfing that have, until now, been
     available only to those who own personal computers. "The UITI(R) is
     more than a network computer (NC) as it turns the TV set into a
     sophisticated communications center, offering an on-screen menu, a
     speaker phone, the ability to send and receive fax messages,
     on-screen caller identification (Caller ID) where available,
     calendar, telephone and address storage, and other services. In
     addition, it comes with a series of "in-ROM" interactive multimedia
     games so that it provides greater value to the whole family," Mr.
     Buck continued.
     
     VIScorp explains that the UITI(R) runs on an enhanced Amiga+
     operating system which, VIScorp says, is internationally recognized
     as one of the finest multitasking multimedia systems, as well as one
     of the most cost effective systems. The UITI(R) comes equipped with
     a built-in modem; includes special fonts and graphics so that
     networked text, data and images can easily be read at normal viewing
     distance; contains random access memory (RAM) to enable users to
     download text, messages and other information; and, comes with a
     sleek, easy-to-use remote control with an imbedded keyboard for
     convenient information input.
     
     "We are extremely excited about the prospect of our product carrying
     the Emerson Radio name," said Mr. Buck. "Emerson is an
     internationally recognized leader in consumer electronics, with a
     reputation for quality and value."
     
     Eugene I. Davis, President of Emerson, stated: "We are very
     optimistic about the inclusion of UITI(R) technology into our
     product mix going forward.
     
     We believe that convergence products will be a major emphasis in the
     consumer electronics business over the next several years and we
     believe that Emerson will be a value product to the mass market in
     this area. We believe the Emerson Radio brand name, which is
     recognized as one of the top brands in consumer electronics, will
     help drive not only the Internet-television interface products, but
     also the second and third generation units which VIScorp has already
     demonstrated to us. We are currently a major supplier to some of the
     largest retailers in the U.S., such as Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart
     and believe these retailers will be looking forward to getting into
     interactive TV products with the Emerson Radio brand name, a brand
     name that has always sold well in their stores."

maximum compatibility across all models, while keeping the rest of the
ports available for their intended uses.

The Amiga-Link package comes with both the standard AmigaLink software and
also the Amiga Envoy software from IAM.  The Amigalink software's advantage
is that it works with Amiga WB 1.3, providing compatibility with older
machines.  Amiga Envoy requires 2.04 or higher, but provides superior
reliability, device sharing, and an API that allows for the development of
third-party networking applications, with many of these already available
on AmiNet.

The new MSRP for the 2-unit Starter Kit is $210.00 US or $270.00 CAN.

This represents a $65US/$80CAN reduction in the price of the basic package,
with corresponding savings on the expansion kits.  Floppy port splitters,
cable options and accesories are also available.


SCSI-TV is an autobooting 2091 compatible DMA SCSI controller which plugs
into the expansion port at the back of CDTV and A570 CD-ROM units. 
Matching coloured steel case for both applications, with external DB-25
connector and optional 2.5" adapter for internal drive mounting.  Both
include HDToolBox and a printed manual with detailed instructions, and use
the latest AMD-33C93A SCSI chip running at 14MHz.

SCSI-TV & SCSI-TV570 prices have been reduced by from $10-$20 depending on
configuration.  See our add in this issue of Amiga Report for a more

(Deltagraph Ltd., 1 Chlois & Diogenous str., Metamorfosi Attikis 144 52,

"AMIGA COMPUTING" GREEK EDITION, Stephanos C. Siopoulos, Editor-in-Chief

Dear Sirs,

Concerning the release of the Greek edition of "Amiga Computing" Magazine
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

As Editor-in-Chief, I would like to inform AR as well as the international
Amiga community, on matters concerning the release of the first Amiga-only
magazine to appear in the Greek computer press for over 4 years.  It is a
publication already well known in the European and American Amiga press:
"AMIGA COMPUTING".  So, after successful negotiations with the IDG Media
Group, Deltagraph Ltd., a Greek publishing company specialising in
computer-related magazines (already publisher of "User", "Multimedia World/
Greek Edition" and "GamePro/Greek Edition") are proud to announce that a
deal has been made for publishing a Greek edition of the successful "AMIGA
COMPUTING" magazine, and issue 1 (July'96) is already out.

The decision for the publication of an Amiga-related magazine in Greece was
made after careful consideration and study of factors and circumstances
contributing to the revitalisation and re-organisation of the Amiga markets
throughout Europe and -especially- Greece at this given time-frame.  Thus,
this decision and all the subsequent moves leading to the creation and
organisation of a competent team of editors, translators and Amiga experts
who will cooperate in order to make the aforementioned magazine a reality,
should be seen in the right perspective as an indication of an overall
attempt made by several interested parties whose common objectives are :
(a) the revitalisation of the Amiga market in Greece, (b) the promotion of
the existing and -more importantly- future Amiga models (either from
AT/Viscorp or 3rd parties, eg.  phase5, PIOS, Eagle, etc) and (c) the
support of the end-users.  Given the above, "AMIGA COMPUTING/Greek Edition"
will closely co-operate with all Amiga-related companies or organisations
in Greece (e.g.  "Greek Amiga Club", "DIONIC SA" and "ACROPOLIS NETWORK"
among others) for the implementation of a proper method and practice of
Amiga support and promotion in this country.

Awaiting the comments, wishes and -of course- the "press releases" and
announcements of Amiga-related developers and organizations,

Sincerely Yours,

Stephanos C.  Siopoulos, Editor-In-Chief of "Amiga Computing"/Greek
Edition.  (e-mail: ssiop@acropolis.gr)

NOTE:

"AmigaComputing/Greek Edition" e-mail address is: acgr@acropolis.gr [VALID
from July 1996] We also hope that by mid-July '96 "AC/Greek Edition" will
also be "on-line" soon at the following URL: http://www.acropolis.net/acgr)

 INSTANT-CGFX

 Call For Participation:

 The CyberGraphics ScreenMode Definition Library
 -----------------------------------------------

Most CybgerGraphics users spend hours in generating usable screenmodes
for their monitor and often new CGFX users ask if someone can send them
a screenmode definiton file.

Motivated by other cybergraphics users I'm trying to build up a
library containing screenmode definition files.

If *YOU* want to help building up the library then please follow the
steps below and upload your definition file.

If there is enough response to my call I make the archive public
available via FTP/WWW.
(Please note that I have _NO_ commercial intention regarding the library!)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Create a LHA-archive containing your screen-mode definition file.

   (To find out the name of your current definition file, use the command
    "type ENV:Cybergraphics/*Monitor". The output will look like
    "Monitor-57KHz". This file can be found in the subdirectory in your
    "ENV:Cybergraphics" directory. For a CyberVision card this would
    look like "ENV:Cybergraphics/CyberVision/Monitor-57KHz".
    Simply add this file to the LHA-archive.)

   Important: DO NOT ADD the monitorfile itself, but only the
              definition file.

 - Choose an approriate name for your archive (and readme)
   that reflects the brand and type of your monitor,
   eg. "nec4fg.lha"/"nec4fg.readme" or "philips15b.lha"/"philips15b.readme"
   (Only one file per archive!)

 - Create a .readme file with the following layout:

     Monitor:   <the name an the type of your monitor>
     Bandwidth: <the bandwith of your _monitor_>
     H-Freq:    <horizontal frequency of your monitor>
     V-Freq:    <vertical frequency of your monitor>
     Card:      <your graphiccard, eg. CyberVision 64
     Memory:    <the memory of your _GRAPHIC_card>
     Modes:     <OPTIONAL: an overview of the supported screenmodes
                 of your monitorfile>
     Uploader   <_your_ email-address and name, in case of questions>

     (check 'CVMode' for bandwidth, h-freq, v-freq and mode values!)

   Here is an example (for my monitorfile):

     Monitor:  NEC MultiSync 4FG
     Bandwith: 75MHz
     H-Freq:   27-57kHz
     V-Freq:   50-90Hz
     Card:     Cybervision 64
     Memory:   4MB
     Modes:    256: 320x240, 640x256, 640x480, 640x512, 768x680, 800x600
                    912x708, 1024x768, 1120x900, 1280x1024, 1600x1200
               64k: 320x240, 640x480, 800x600, 912x708, 1024x768, 1120x900
               16M: 320x240, 640x480, 800x600, 912x708, 1024x768, 1104x800
     Uploader: sfx@unix-ag.uni-siegen.de (Lars Eilebrecht)

 - Upload both files into the "/incoming" directory of
   the ftp-server "ftp.unix-ag.uni-siegen.de".

 - and last but not least, send a mail to "sfx@unix-ag.uni-siegen.de"
   including the name of your upload!
   (Please use "CGFX: <filename>" as the subject of your mail!)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spend 5 minutes of your time and help new CGFX users to save 5 hours...

If you have any questions or comments, please respond to 
Lars Eilebrecht (sfx@unix-ag.uni-siegen.de).

@toc NEWS

V2.02 June 21st 1996

Dear Shareware author,

This is the FOURTH draft in as many days of the proposed F1 Shareware
scheme.   There are quite a few changes from V2 so please read it
carefully.  I have had some good ideas and suggestions and below we now
have a simple, but effective plan for the operation of the scheme.  It is
very similar to other schemes on the PC, probably because it is the best
way to do it?  However, we are still open to suggestions, but you will need
to be quick as I think we can get this easier scheme up and running quite
quickly.

                           The F1 Shareware Scheme

YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE BY READING THIS TEXT, IT IS NOT A GIMMICK, IT IS A
SERIOUS BUSINESS PROPOSITION OPEN TO ALL SHAREWARE AUTHORS AND BEST OF ALL,
IT WON'T COST YOU ANY MONEY, IN FACT IT WILL MAKE YOU MONEY.

PLEASE NOTE: This scheme is set up mainly for Amiga Shareware, but there is
no reason we cannot accept PC software too.  At present we do not own other
systems (Mac, Unix etc.) so we cannot evaluate the software and therefore
we must restrict ourselves to Amiga and PC only.  PC authors, obviously
references to the Amiga press and distributors are not valid for the PC,
YET.

So what are we trying to achieve here?

We are trying to create a scheme that will benefit:

i)   Shareware programmers
     (To enhance your sales and consumer awareness of your product. 
      Also to help you make some money and therefore keep on developing
      quality software.)

ii)  Shareware customers
     (where they can register Shareware conveniently and
     without any worries about money or receiving their goods,)

iii) F1 Shareware (i.e. create a useful service and make a few bob)

iiii)Enhance the Shareware image in general as we believe the future
     of decent Amiga software will be just Licenceware and Shareware
     and we intend to be there, big time.

If you think any part of this scheme is unfair or crap or just a bad idea
then don't go around slagging it off, let me know and I will do my best to
fix it.  It is important that programmers and customers are happy with the
running of the scheme, as this alone will ensure its success.

General concept
---------------

The original concept drawn up in the beta version of this text turned out
to be far too complicated and many problems would have arisen.  I thought
programmers would want a complete service from us, i.e.  taking the orders,
copying the disks and posting the goods direct to the customer.  It turns
out that most of you just want us to take orders on your behalf and e-mail
the order to you.  We are trying to please everyone now, So, here is the
revised concept:

* There are two ways the scheme can operate:

     Standard service:
  1) We take orders (money) on your behalf and e-mail you the details
     the same day, you then dispatch the goods to the customer and we pay
     you your money once every three months. (see later for more detail)

     Full service:
  2) We take orders and send out your product the same day to the customer.
     We pay your share once a quarter.

Requirements:

* Authors MUST have e-mail access if you want us to take orders and pass
  them on to you, we will NOT be operating a telephone service for various
  reasons. This is of course irrelevant if you want the full service
  (see above).

* To qualify into the scheme a FULL registered version (registered to F1)
  must be sent along with the Shareware demo version to be considered.
  If we feel the program is good value at the price and the software is also
  good then we will accept it into the scheme. If we reject it, your disks
  will be returned. We DO NOT make copies of evaluations, so do not worry.
  In over 3 years of trading in Licenceware no author has had any reason to
  complain about our honesty or service.
  I feel it is important to only sell high quality, good value titles as
  this enhances peoples perception of F1 and helps to sell all our products,
  (creates a domino effect) F1 does not, and will never, sell sub-standard 
  software or products at rip-off prices.

* Once accepted, your (Amiga) program will benefit from the many resources
  F1 has in the Amiga world. We will spread your demo version around the
  world and get you magazine reviews all at our expense. Your program will
  also be featured in the F1 catalogue of which we give free to anyone who
  requests it and a free copy to everyone who buys anything off of F1,
  which means you will have access to thousands of F1 customers who already
  buy Licenceware. We will also have a F1 web site set up soon (hopefully)
  where anyone will be able to download info and your demos.

* The author MUST supply a contact address on-disk for customer enquiries,
  problems etc. F1 is not in the position to deal with technical support.

* You must also supply us with a fairly detailed description of your product
  for use in our catalogue disk and for review purposes.

* A few small 'F1 Shareware' files will be put on the disk, just a small
  text similar to this doc to tempt new Shareware authors to the scheme.

* When a customer contacts us to buy your program they will have the
  opportunity to pay by Access/Visa/Eurocard or Mastercard credit cards,
  this in itself is a huge bonus to most Shareware authors. Customers can of
  course also pay us by cheque or postal order (UK).

* F1 is a business and we have to make an operating profit. After lengthy
  discussions with lots of people this is how the costings will work:

1)Standard service (we pass on orders to you)
  We will charge your customer 20% on top of the price you are selling your
  product for.
  For example, if you are selling at 10 we charge your customer 12.
  You STILL get your 10 and we take the 2 to cover our costs and make a
  small profit. So in effect YOU are getting our services free of charge.

2)Full service (We handle the complete sale)
  It is difficult to put a percentage on this, we will take each program on
  its merits. For example, you may want to supply a printed manual with
  pre-labelled and copied disks, or you may want us to do this.
  The cost will depend on how much work is involved and of course how much
  it costs us to reproduce your product. We can use the standard 'F1
  Software' label if you want, it is professionally printed label of the
  thick glossy type and looks quite nice. We can not have program names
  printed on these for various reasons, the title will be hand-written. 

  (Standard service)

* The same day we take an order for your product you will be e-mailed
  the details of the customer. We urge you to send out the goods promptly.
  We will refuse to take any further orders for your product if we receive
  complaints of authors keeping customers waiting without reason, this is one
  of the main reasons (along with no goods sent at all) that people are 
  loathe to send money to Shareware authors.  

  (all services)

* Money from your sales will be paid once a quarter (every three months)
  at the same time as all F1 royalties are paid, there are set months for
  this to keep life at F1 simple. The months are:

  March, June, September, December.

  Payment is sent during the first few days of the month , usually the 2nd
  or there abouts with a statement of your sales.

  We can only pay foreign programmers on a UK cheque in Sterling, you should
  check with your bank if or how much you will be charged for conversion. 

  There will be a minimum cash sum that we pay out, this will be 50.
  If your programs sales are less than 50 then we will hold the money over
  until the next quarter or until 50 is reached. This should be unusual
  in most cases, but we have to keep our bank charges down. For a nominal
  fee (probably 1 taken off your royalty) you can claim your cash if you
  really need it, but not early, we are strict on that as it causes chaos.

* Unlike our Licenceware scheme, we do NOT expect to have exclusive
  distribution rights. In other words you can continue selling your program
  as well, and in other outlets if you wish too. We do ask that you do not
  sell your program at a lower rate than you quote to us to sell it at as
  this could be unhealthy for F1's reputation.

  You keep all copyrights to your program of course.
  You can withdraw your program from F1 Shareware at any time, giving two
  months notice, this is needed to halt any possible advertising, let us
  fill any orders and to give your customers one last chance to buy.
  Not only that, it's the decent thing to do.

  If for some reason F1 wants to stop selling your program we will afford
  you this same courtesy as long as you have abided by the rules.

  There will be no contract, just terms and conditions which will be laid
  out in this document and revised from time to time, as any contract will 
  be fairly useless anyway due to the international flavour of this scheme.

* We will NOT accept pornography or anything likely to offend.

* We will consider any type of program util/game/tutor etc.

             What do you, as a programmer get out of the scheme?
             ----------------------------------------------------

* Marketing
-----------

ADVERTISING: A percentage (tba) of profits from Shareware sales will go
toward advertising in the UK Amiga magazines and maybe other Euro mags.  
This won't happen at first though as we will have start-up costs and need
to retrieve this first, at the low margins we are working on this could be
quite some time to be honest, especially with the crazy prices the Amiga
mags are charging at present.  Considering their circulation is falling
fast their advertising prices are not doing the same and so represent bad
value.

MAGAZINE REVIEWS: F1 has many contacts within the Amiga mags and a proven
track record of getting a high hit ratio.  We have secured nearly 200
reviews in UK mags in the last three years.  Reviews are an essential
ingredient to your products awareness.  We can virtually guarantee you at
least one review.  We are also making new contacts with Amiga mags in
Germany, Holland and Sweden and starting to get good reviews there too.

NEWS PLUGS: Another form of free advertising that we can get you.  We know
the tricks of the trade and you can benefit from the F1 name.

DISTRIBUTION: Your demo version, that you must supply us with of course,
will be uploaded to the Aminet and other distribution sites (suggestions
please) The demo will also be passed to all our distributers, which between
them have the UK market virtually sewn up.  They include 17 Bit Software,
Active Software, Seasoft Computing, Saddletramps PD, Exclusive PD and
others.  We MAY also upload to PD bulletin boards.  Demos and or flyers
will also be sent to customers on the F1 database that may have an obvious
interest in your program.  For example if your program was a brilliant game
creation system we would contact all our customers that bought Grac from
us.  (Graphical Adventure Creator) and there are a LOT of them, we have
thousands of Amiga customers on our list just waiting to buy quality
software.  The planned F1 Web site will also carry your demo for
downloading too.

THE F1 CATALOGUE: The F1 Licenceware catalogue is sent out FREE OF CHARGE
to hundreds of customers all over the world every month, your programs will
be listed in there in a special section.

* Other benefits:
-----------------

Your program will gain instant respect by being attached to the F1 name.  
This is not an idle boast, we have spent 3 years building a solid
reputation of quality and trust with our customers, programmers and the
Amiga press.  In other words people WILL take notice of your program,
simply because F1 are selling it for you.

We can accept credit card orders on your behalf.  This will be a MAJOR
advantage to most of you.  How many Shareware programmers do you know that
can accept credit card orders?  Around 70% of all mail order goods are
bought by credit card, some people refuse to pay by anything else because
with a credit card they can't lose their money, in the event of the
customer being ripped off the credit card company refunds them and so this
is insurance for the customer.  There is no doubt about it, you will lose
sales if you can't take credit cards.

The whole system will not cost you anything, we do NOT request any money
from you at any stage. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As this is very nearly the last draft of the scheme (bar small changes) I
will soon be e-mailing this text to a lot of Shareware authors (hundreds)
over the coming weeks and we will be getting a mention for the scheme in a
few of the UK mags so keep an eye out. 

Please help the scheme by spreading this text to everyone you know.

Please send in your comments/ideas/enquiries and/or evaluation copies now
and we will get in touch very soon.

We hope to start the scheme proper in July 96 sometime, so get a move on
and you could be one of the first to be in on the biggest shake up in
Shareware history on the Amiga.  I used that line when we started F1
Licenceware and it seemed a bit optimistic at the time, but it wasn't, we
are now the largest and most successful Licenceware scheme that has existed
on the Amiga, we now surpass even the legendary CLR.

               YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE, AND EVERYTHING TO GAIN

Thank you for your attention.

@node NEWS5 "MRBackup"
@toc NEWS

IAM is proud to announce that MRBackup has been sold by Mark Rinfret and it
is now published by IAM.  Robert Hardy will be supporting and continuing
the development of the product.  It is no longer available as shareware.
We've already made a few improvements, and are now shipping MRBackup 2.5 to
customers.

If you need a backup program that is still supported and developed on the
Amiga, we urge you to consider purchasing MRBackup.  Buy DiskSalv4 at the
same time and save!  PLEASE spread the word.  It's hard for Amiga companies
to get the message out about new products these days...

MRBackup 2.5 sells for US$60 + s/h (or US$10 + s/h for upgrades from
previous registered versions).  It is also available in a special package
deal with DiskSalv4 (shipping now) for only US$80 -- a savings of $20 on
the two products!

For more information, see below.  You can also write to mrbackup@iam.com,
see our web pages at http://www.iam.com/, or download our AmigaGuide
catalog file via anon FTP to file://ftp.iam.com/biz/iam/

IAM publishes "Connect Your Amiga!  A Guide to the Internet, LANs, BBSs and
Online Services" (second printing, revised for 1996, shipping now), "Eight
Freely Redistributable Disks to Connect Your Amiga!", "MegaBall4", "The
Deathbed Vigil", and "Amiga Envoy 2.0b." It also distributes DICE in North
America.

[If you maintain a BBS or other archive of freely redistributable software,
please remove any old versions of MRBackup -- they are no longer freely
redistributable.  We plan to release a demo version of 2.5 soon.]

Details follow:

--

MRBackup is an Amiga hard disk backup program with friendly graphical
interface and extensive ARexx support.  You need a backup program to:

  *   Protect your valuable files against loss
  *   Remove rarely-used files from your harddrive, freeing up needed
      harddrive space
  *   Transfer larger-than-fits-on-one-floppy files between systems

MRBackup provides a wide range of services to support Amiga file management
and backup/restore of files to/from hard disk.  Files can be backed up to:

  *   Floppy disk, in AmigaDOS format
  *   Floppy disk, in a special "fast" format
  *   Any sequential file or device (local or networked) in "fast"
      format
  *   SCSI streaming tape

MRBackup was originally written by Mark Rinfret nearly ten years ago. 
During the program's long history, with the suggestions of many thousands
of Amiga users, it has evolved a great deal of stability, functionality,
and ease-of-use.  As of June, 1996, MRBackup is published by IAM, who is
proud to add MRBackup to its fine line of Amiga products, and to add to its
stable of outstanding Amiga authors Mr.  Robert Hardy of HardKore Software.
Bob is the new owner of the source code for MRBackup, and will be providing
support for new and existing customers, bug fixes and future development. 
He has already produced version 2.5 and started work on version 3.

MRBackup is designed to behave well in your Amiga's multi-tasking
environment.  It does not "take over the machine" and will allow you to use
your Amiga for other activities while backups are being performed. 
MRBackup is controlled by a flexible set of user-configurable parameters
and offers a wide range of backup and restore options.  Its Intuition-based
user interface is designed for a pleasing appearance and ease of operation.

MRBackup provides a complete and powerful ARexx interface through which
you can access most operating parameters and features. Automate
complex backup procedures through relatively simple rexx macros. Launch
ARexx macros separately or from the Macros Menu. Run multiple
"copies" of MRBackup, with a unique ARexx port name for each instance of
MRBackup.

MRBackup uses the Amiga's speech capabilities to provide an effective means
for presenting prompts, error conditions and requests for floppy disk
insertions, etc.  While DEVS:narrator.device and LIBS:translator.library
are no longer shipped with the Amiga operating system, you can copy them
from your older copies of the AmigaDOS installation disks and they will
work just fine.

MRBackup provides optional data compression which will reduce the number of
diskettes (or other media) required for a backup.  A saveset catalog file
is created for each saveset, allowing quick retrieval of individual files
when necessary.  Should the catalog file become damaged or lost, MRBackup
can recreate it by scanning the saveset.

Requirements

Amiga Translators' Organization

Ladies and gentlemen, a new era has begun on the Amiga.  No more shall
users struggle with technical English jargon (or, even worse, German,
French or Italian), no more shall programmers struggle with getting
translators for their programs.  Amiga Translators' Organization is born!

The function of Amiga Translators' Organization should be pretty easy to
render: We are an organization consisting of, at the time of writing, over
40 translators of 13 languages willing to translate anything for the Amiga,
and at the same time, we are always seeking new members.  So: If you are a
programmer who wants translations for your program, please contact us.  If
you are/want to be a translator, please contact us too.

In an earlier Amiga Report, Anders Bakkevold of Norway has introduced his
"locale" homepage.  ATO is in no way in open war with Anders, in fact we
have merged.  However, as ATO has is a little more organized (no offence,
Anders!), I would like to give you a brief overview of ATO:

One of our biggest visions is the perfect translation.  We do not just want
to be a pool of translators, we want quality controlled translations.  This
means that for every project (except very small ones) we will occupy at
least BOTH a translator and a proofreader, and for large projects more
people will get involved.  In addition, our different language departments
are continually setting up guidelines for translation and developing
technical dictionaries in order to make translations uniform and as
user-friendly as possible.

In the past, there have been problems with translations.  I can speak of
Danish: Often Danish translations are even worse using than the English
originals because translators do not follow the guidelines of the
Workbench, and in some cases the translators simply cannot spell.  I know
that this sounds rude, but nevertheless it is the pure truth.  These
problems will vanish if programmers start using ATO instead of picking up
the first volunteering translator on a random mailing list.

If you are interested, either as a programmer or as a translator, you are
very welcome to visit our homepage:
http://www2.dk-online.dk/users/Ole_Friis/Trans/Index.HTM
Here you will find lots of useful information on how we are organized, how
you join, how you get a program translated, links to our language
departments etc.  etc.

Please mail me your opinion(s) about ATO, both negative and positive.

Kind regards,
Ole Friis

AUTHOR

     Ty Sarna (tsarna@endicor.com)

DESCRIPTION

     This is a standard Amiga printer driver with an additional
     printing program for the Stylus Color inkjet printers from Epson,
     including the II, IIs, and Pro. The printer features resolutions
     from 180x180 dpi to 720x720 dpi, with optional MicroWeave printing
     (an Epson feature that uses overlapping passes to reduce banding),
     Optimized Black Mode (on the Stylus II model only), and Small Dot
     mode (for the II, IIs and Pro models). The driver also implements
     horizontal and vertical whitespace stripping, as well as Epson
     compression mode 2 ("TIFF v4.0 packbits mode") to minimize the amount
     of data that must be sent to the printer and improve printing speed.

     EnPrint 2.x is based on a totally new portable 24 bit printing
     engine developed by Endicor instead of the standard Amiga 12 bit
     printing engine. This allows advanced user-accessible controls for
     gamma, intensity range, color correction, a wide selection of
     dithering options, color-to-grey conversion formula, and much more.

     The preferences driver has been updated to use this engine,
     providing all of these capabilities to all applications. Also
     included is a printing program that uses the printing engine
     directly, providing full 24 bit printing capability even to users who
     do not have other software that supports 24 bit printing. The
     printing program also features reduced memory usage, allowing large,
     high-resolution prints even on systems with very little memory.
     Note that printing time depends greatly on the application used,
     processing speed of the computer, and amount of data in a given
     output.

FEATURES

     Built in calibration utility.

     User adjustable Time-Out control.

     Full 24 bit printing support.

     Completely user-controllable gamma and range adjustments for full
     control over brightness and contrast.

     Three modes of color correction: adjustable in terms of RGB, CMY,
     or Y in M/M in C. The latter produces the best results as it most
     closely models the inaccuracies of printing inks. These modes are
     also completely adjustable.

     In greyscale mode, complete user control over the color-to-grey
     conversion process, plus three convenient preset configurations for
     the NTSC, HDTV, and equal-parts formulas.

     In B&W (thresholding) mode, the threshold is fully adjustable
     over an 8-bit intensity range, rather than Preference's 4 bit range.

     Sixty Five dither modes. Sixty Two are matrix dithers (many
     sizes and varieties of ordered, halftone, bricks, diamonds, etc.,
     providing a lot of "special effect" options), plus Random Threshold
     and two Floyd-Steinberg algorithmic dithers.

     Flexible configuration scheme: The system works in terms of
     configurations. A configuration consists of settings for resolution,
     dither, mode (MicroWeave, Optimized Black, Small Dot, etc.), color
     correction, gamma, etc. The Preferences editor allows for seven
     configurations corresponding to the 7 density options. Thus any
     density can be chosen to be any configuration of resolution, mode,
     dither, and corrections that the user wants. Additional
     configurations can be loaded and saved . The printing program also
     keeps a separate configuration. Configurations are edited with a
     friendly GUI configuration editor.

     Preferences driver supports printing HAM-8 and 7/8 bit modes on
     AGA machines in all their glory, plus 12 bit single-CLUT style like
     FinalWriter(TM) and others use.

     Preferences driver is smart about the true paper dimensions. It
     should handle all of the standard paper sizes correctly, plus if
     given enough maneuvering room, it will truly center the image on the
     paper, rather than centering within the printable area like the
     previous version and other standard Workbench drivers.

     Context-sensitive online AmigaGuide help. All documentation can
     also be brought up from within the program itself.

     Printing Program: Allows users to load pictures in IFF format
     (supports HAM-8, EHB, 24 bit, even Dynamic-HAM and Dynamic-HiRes),
     operate on them (rotate/flip, invert, etc.), size and position them,
     and print them. Any picture (even 24 bit) can be printed on any
     Amiga. There is no conversion to HAM or HAM-8 to cause loss of
     quality -- it's 24 bit all the way through when using the printing
     program.

     The printing program also includes a module that can generate
     pictures in 10 different modes, as an alternative to loading IFFs.
     Modes include things like user-selectable solid colors, color
     gradients, two kinds of color bars, and a hue/saturation "wheel".
     These modes are useful for calibrating color correction,
     gamma/lo/high, and for examining the effect of different dithers
     over ranges of intensity/color. An additional mode is a Workbench
     screen capture.

     There is support for output spooling and multiple print copies.

     A hard disk is required with a minimum space free of about 2
     meg. More is required for using the printing program on large
     pictures, and lots when using output buffering or multicopy support
     because it must store the complete printer output generated. This can
     be up to 20 megs a page at 720dpi full color, though the compression
     usually keeps it to about 12-16 megs or so. Only enough storage for
     one page at a time is needed, however. Using this method, a minimum
     amount of RAM required at the expense of the higher disk space
     requirements.

UPDATES

     EnPrint 2.1 is a free update for registered owners of EnPrint v2.0
     or Epson Stylus Color Printer Driver version 1.2, 1.1 or 1.0.  You
     may get an upgrade in one of three ways:

          By email: Email to sales@endicor.com with your name and serial
          number and a request for an upgrade, and we'll email EnPrint
          2.0 back to you. Ask for details.

DESCRIPTION

  The basic function of sort is to sort ASCII-files in
  alphabetical order.  But its functions are not restricted to
  sorting.  I implemented many options which allow to manipulate
  file(s) in different ways.
  The sort program is started from Shell.


NEW FEATURES

  (registered version)

  * added an option which deletes spaces and tabs at the end of a line
  * added an option which removes a given number of lines at the
    beginning of a file (selectable for the first and the other files)
  * added a option for sorting in two passes
  * changed the -i option
  * increased sorting speed


FEATURES

  (unregistered version)

  * sorting files alphabetically (ascending, descending)
  * distinguishing and no distinguishing of capitals and small letters
  * erasing of empty lines

  (registered version)

  * sorting files alphabetically (ascending, descending)
  * sorting with columns, variable length of sort string
  * removing and replacing of characters
  * picking out lines
  * throwing out lines
  * joining files
  * ignoring of specified strings at the beginning of a line
  * all functions are operating in a given range, if desired
  * selectable distinguishing of capitals and small letters
  * erasing of empty lines
  * erasing of double lines (improved now!)
  * dividing a file into two, according to the given pattern,
    which is specified with the -q|Q option.
  * reversing of the file (without sorting)
  * verbose function

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  none

DESCRIPTION

RevUp manages version strings following the Amiga standard for
including in own programs, e.g. '$VER: YourTool 2.4 (11.9.95)'.

It's a must for every serious C, Oberon or Assembler programmer,
so have a look at it! Your makefiles together with RevUp will do
all the work for you.

RevUp <version> <projectname> {<dependency>} [REV <revision>]
      [BETA] [C] [ASM] [OBERON] [LOG] [EXTRA] [FULLYEAR]
      [ENVVAR] [TINY]

Required:
 VERSION     : Version number.
 PROJECTNAME : Basename to use for all RevUp files.

Multiple:
 DEPENDENCIES: Files which dates are checked.

Optional:
 REV     : Explicit revision number.
 BETA    : Generate beta information.
 C       : Generate C headerfile (default).
 ASM     : Generate Assembly includefile.
 OBERON  : Generate Oberon definition module.
 LOG     : Interactively add history info to logfile.
 EXTRA   : Generate extra information.
 FULLYEAR: Use four digits for year strings.
 ENVVAR  : Set envvar for archive naming.
 TINY    : Don't print credits.


EXAMPLE

With RevUp SuperTool_rev.h will look like this:

/* C headerfile generated by RevUp 1.5 */

#define VERSION1
#define REVISION5
#define DATE"28.3.95"
#define VERS"SuperTool 1.5"
#define VSTRING"SuperTool 1.5 (28.3.95)\r\n"
#define VERSTAG"\0$VER: SuperTool 1.5 (28.3.95)"
#define VSTR"SuperTool 1.5 (28.3.95)"
#define USER"boris"
#define HOST"prox"
#define TIME"14:57:51"
#define PRGNAME"SuperTool"
#define BASENAME"SUPERTOOL"
#define _CREATIONDATE_"12.7.95"

@node FEATURE1 "Going On The INet"
@toc FEATURE

===========================================================================
                             Going On The INet
  Robert Davis                                              rdavis@nyx.net
===========================================================================

   Amiga users generally regard the software they use as superior to that
which performs similar tasks but runs on clone type computers.  But most
every Amiga owner will agree that getting a clone computer attached to the
Internet through a local Internet Service Provider (ISP) is much easier
than getting an Amiga attached to the INet.

   One consideration: Each ISP has a somewhat different connection
procedure.  But each ISP can provide a custom installation for Windows
software simply because the vast majority of their customers will use clone
computers and Windows. 

   Amiga owners, who use many different ISPs, will have to do nearly all
the work to configure their systems to work with one of the more than 2000
ISPs operating in North America as of mid 1996.  The purpose of this
article is to show Amiga owners a fairly easy way to get their favorite
computers "onto the Internet."

   Defining just what it means to be "on the Internet" is rather important.
For years, my Internet access was just like calling a Bulletin Board
System.  My Amiga would call a system which was itself part of the
Internet, but offered a dial-up interface for users simply calling from
their home computers.  The only software I needed for that connection was a
terminal program, such as Terminus or VLT.  Using such a terminal program
to a remote system, I could only perform one task at a time.  Also, the
terminal program did not permit use of programs with slick graphic
interfaces to do the various neat things one can do when on the Internet. 

   Being "on the internet" means that your computer actually has an IP
address.  Such an address might be 204.120.185.79, which is the decimal
representation of four eight-bit numbers separated by periods.   Once my
Amiga is on the internet, I use client programs to do things like transfer
files, send and receive E-Mail, and of course browse the World Wide Web.
Since I have an Amiga, I can do all those things simultaneously.

   Connecting to the Internet requires a lot more software than just a
terminal program.  A PPP device driver is necessary, unless you have a
direct network connection, or you use a Serial Line Interface Protocol
(SLIP) connection.  For some really important technical reasons, PPP is
better than SLIP.  In addition to PPP, you need TCP/IP software.   Assuming
you are not an expert at network software installation, an installer
program makes things go so much more smoothly.  Then a few client programs
allow you to do real work with your Internet connection.   I'll list some
which I think are most useful after we look at basic installation. 

   The installation procedure requires you to type shell commands from your
keyboard, and you must know four things about your Internet account and
your Internet provider.

   Those four things are ..... sample entries (but you must use your own) 

   My chosen login name ...... robertd
   My secret password ........ PassWord
   My provider's domain name . smartnet.net
   My provider's IP address .. 204.120.185.5

   I recommend you get the following three programs first.  They are all
available from the Aminet archives on the Internet, or from other sources.

The PPP program ...........  PPP1_45.lha (105K)
                             pub/aminet/comm/net/PPP1_45.lha

The TCP/IP program ........  AmiTCP-demo-40.lha (738K)
                             pub/aminet/comm/tcp/AmiTCP-demo-40.lha

The installer program .....  iiNST_151.lha (26K)
                             pub/aminet/comm/tcp/iiNST_151.lha

   By the time this article appears, there may be newer versions of some of
these programs.  You will have to look for yourself. 

   Extract the iiNST151 archive to your hard drive.  Copy both the PPP
archive and the AmiTCP archive into the iNTERiNSTALL directory created when
you extracted iiNST151.lha.  From the shell, change to that directory and
extract both the PPP1_45.lha and AmiTCP archives.

   Now comes the hard part.  If you are not going to connect to one of the
four service providers for which dialer scripts are included with the
iNTERiNSTALL software, you must modify one of those iiMOD files to work
with your provider.  Here is where things may become confusing.  What you
must do is call your ISP with a normal terminal program and see just what
their computer sends to and expects from your system.  You must pay close
attention to the exact procedure your ISP uses for the logon sequence. 

   After I made that call, I could see that the EMPIRENET.iiMOD file
provided with the iINTERiNSTALL program was closest to the script I needed
to connect my system.  So I copied EMPIRENET.iiMOD to SMARTNET.iiMOD then I
changed the DOMAIN aand NAMESERVER lines in the script file SMARTNET.iiMOD
as follows:

#MODULE FOR iNTERiNSTALL 1.51 -  EmpireNet (empirenet.com)
# Submitted by Thomas Barker (72027.3476@compuserve.com)
#
ECHO OFF
TIMEOUT 3600    ; Set maximum wait time (in ticks)
REDIAL "BUSY"   ; Redial on busy signal

;INSTALL Enter the modem initialization command
SEND "$RESPONSE"     ; Initialize the modem

;INSTALL Enter your user name (lower case)
SEND "$RESPONSE" ; Send your User ID
DELAY 20
WAIT "d:"         ; Wait for Password:
;INSTALL Enter your password
SEND "$RESPONSE" ; Send your password
DELAY 50
#END

; Domain names
DOMAIN smartnet.net       <--- was empirenet.com
; Name servers
NAMESERVER 204.120.185.5  <--- was 205.164.88.1

   After you save the changes, run the iNTERiNSTALL program.  It takes just
a few seconds to complete the PPP and TCP/IP installation.

   Reboot your Amiga, open a shell, and type internet to start the
procedure of connecting to your Internet Service Provider.  You will see a
new shell window open showing progress and results of the dialing and
connection efforts.  That window will close and an AmiTCP/IP window will
open with a ghosted 'OK' requester.  When that ghosting clears, you may
click on it to finish starting AmiTCP/IP.  If you get the commercial
AmiTCP/IP version 4.x, you won't have to click on OK.  I also suggest that
you register the PPP device, using the registration form in the archive.
It is inexpensive, and the registered PPP 1.xx does work faster than the
distributable version.

   Some of the programs you will find useful once your Amiga is 'on the
Internet' include:

   AmiFTP ...  a client program with intuition interface to receive and
send files using the standard File Transfer Protocol.  On the aminet
archive, look for /pub/aminet/comm/tcp/AmiFTP-1.264.lha (207K).

   AmIRC ...  a client program (requires MUI) to use Internet Relay Chat. 
IRC is keyboard to keyboard talk in thousands of "chat rooms" on several
networks, of which Undernet and EFNet are the biggest.  Look for
/pub/aminet/comm/tcp/AmIRC.lha (816K).

   YAM ...  Yet Another Mailer (uses MUI) a program to send and receive
Internet E-mail directly from and to your Amiga.  Once you install it and
get it running, YAM registration costs nothing, you just send a mail to the
author of the program for a registration number.  Look for
/pub/aminet/comm/mail/YAM12.lha (135K).

   Telser ...  a replacement for serial.device which allows your favorite
terminal program to act as a telnet client.  Look for
/pub/aminet/comm/tcp/telser140.lha (251K).

   If you want to wander the World Wide Web (WWW) with your Amiga, there
are several browsers available.  To access the Web, you should have OS 3.0
or 3.1 running on your Amiga.  You must have at least OS 2.04 ...  and
Amiga OS 2 limits you to two browsers, either ALynx or the rather old
Mosaic 1.2.  ALynx may be found in /pub/aminet/comm/net/ALynx.lha (277K),
and Amiga Mosaic requires the Magic User Interface, found in:
/pub/aminet/dev/gui/mui33usr.lha (797K).  Once you have OS 3.x, you may use
AWeb, which does not use MUI, /pub/aminet/biz/demo/AWeb.lha and if you have
MUI installed, the newer versions of Mosaic (1.2.1 or 2.0r3) and the newer
browsers, Voyager, /pub/aminet/comm/www/Voyager.lha or IBrowse are useable
on your Amiga.

   Getting IBrowse or the various versions of Mosaic requires an ftp
connection to ftp.omnipresence.com where you look in the directories
/pub/amiga/ibrowse or /pub/amiga/amosaic to get the programs.

   Of course there are other programs available to do each of the tasks
described above.  But I know that these programs work, so I can recommend
each of them.  And I know that we have a circular problem here.  You have
to be on the Internet to access the ftp sites, and you have to get the
software on the ftp sites to be able to access the Internet.  If you need
more help, I will be happy to answer questions.  If you send me paper mail,
please include a self-addressed, stamped envelope with your question.

has quickly drained from the system.  Similar events can happen at any time
and, without protection of the proper type, you are powerless to do
anything about electrical damage.  How common are these disturbances?  A US
study covering nearly 40 years quantified what happened electrically at a
"typical" location.  There were 443 disruptive or destructive power
disturbances; 15 outages, 36 spikes, 128 surges and 264 sags, causing a
variety of errors or failures.  There were 3 times as many power outages in
1991 as in 1972.

Do you feel safe with your computer now?  Just how bad is it for
electronics, especially your computer equipment?  Do you need an
uninteruptable power supply (UPS)?  From my experience, yes, and here is
why.  You just can not predict when or with what force power problems will
occur.  After two previous experiences with power related damage done to
motherboards of a printer and a Commodore 64, I didn't want any power
problems to affect my Amigas.  I now use a standby power supply (SPS) for
an Amiga 2000, a UPS for the A4000 station, and surge protectors for the
C=64, modem and laser printer.  Seriously consider getting appropriate
protection, since computer hardware is expensive to repair and down-time
could be disastrous.  Amiga stuff may be rare or nearly impossible to
replace and your data could be priceless!

Power Absolutely Corrupts

Using a UPS is better than buying insurance because the situation is not
could your computer be hit, it's how often or how severely has it already
been hit!  If a circuit is near capacity, you may be subjecting it to many
under-voltages, the most frequent problem, which could invisibly corrupt
data.  Over-voltages can take their toll over time; a spike can kill your
computer immediately.  These all could be from something as powerful as a
lightning strike, a motor turning on, or as innocuous as warming up a laser
printer.  Many problems, except long-term power failure, are local to your
building, not from outside.  I often watch a small nearby light dim in
rhythm with the heatlamp doing its job inside the printer!  So, depending
on what was just turned on, you can see the voltage drop, but chances are
these attacks will go unnoticed.  The damage done may not be apparent until
later when chips, components, disks or tiny motherboard traces finally
fail.

The location of your computer has a great effect on reliability.  If you
live near parks, ravines or wooded areas, animals on overhead powerlines
can be a big problem.  Industrial areas or certain floors in a big building
can have widely variable fluctuations.  Power fluctuations in rural areas
are known to be more severe than the ones in cities, too.  With computer
chips using lower voltages and operating at much faster speeds, they are
increasingly more sensitive to changes in electricity.

A UPS/SPS is a battery-backed and filtered power source that protects
against various power anomalies; spikes, surges, sags (brown-outs) and RF
noise, among others, including outright power failure (blackouts).  Sags
and surges can be caused by a sudden change in demand from a device being
turned on or off.  Lightning, solar radiation, or changes made by a power
utility are more reasons.  The lowly surge is more dangerous the longer or
more frequent it is, not necessarily by its magnitude, by accumulating
undetected damage.  Superior SPS/UPS models have meaningful surge
protection (pass ing ANSI, IEEE and CSA/UL Category A and B tests) to
dampen the size of any over-voltage or spike to very small amounts. 
Figures to look for regarding suppression are the lowest pass-through on
over-voltages, and the higher joules number.  The unrated power bar you may
be using probably has little or no ability to handle spikes, let alone
typical over-voltages.  Cheap powerbars may not even have an overload reset
button (similar to a fuse) or isolation between its outlets.  Only higher
quality UPSes have brownout protection, preventing some problems such as
disk read/write errors.

Another less common power problem is an outright power loss.  This could
last for hours, but more than likely it will happen only briefly.  While
older analog power supplies can't handle any loss in power, most computer
power supplies today have the ability to bridge a gap of a relatively
lengthy time.  Depending on quality, most standby power supplies have a
power break time of 2-10ms; an uninteruptable power supply has no break at
all and is more expensive than an SPS as a result.  Total loss of power
(longer than about 10ms) not only loses your data since the last save, but,
if writing data to a disk at the time of failure, would cause data
corruption and potentially hurt the hard drive media, or worse.  Disk file
systems become corrupted if the power failure interrupts a write-to-disk
operation.  This means the hard drive or floppy probably won't be
recognised when power returns.  The UPS has saved me in this circumstance,
too.  At the same time, as power comes back into the system, your equipment
could also be hit with a line spike!

Numbers

When buying a UPS, get one with a large enough power capacity to keep your
primary equipment (CPU, monitor and external drives) working until you
power down, which should potentially be no more than a few minutes.  An
Amiga 4000 could draw 5.0 Amps (depending upon boards, hard drives or extra
RAM) when initially turned on.  This is the in-rush current, but most of
the time it will idle much lower, around 1 Amp for a 150W computer box.  An
EnergyStar monitor could draw .6 Amp, to well over 2 Amps for coal- fired
ones, with a 1084 drawing 1A.  Then you have to consider power used by any
other externals and how long you want to run under battery power.

Here is how you calculate your needs:

1. List all equipment you need to connect to the UPS with their Ampere and
   Volt ratings found on the back or bottom. You may as well get the Watt
   ratings, if they are listed, too.

2. Multiply the Volts (120 in North America) by the total Amp figure to
   get the V-A requirements for all devices. For example, a system with a
   draw of 3.3 Amps x 120 Volts = 396 V-A. If you use 220-240 Volts, cut
   the V-A time in half. If the power consumption is in Watts, simply
   multiply Watts by 1.43 to get V-A. The V-A duration is the main figure
   for choosing a UPS.

3. Catalogues will list battery capacity as V-A or KV-A (1000 V-A) with
   full-load and half-load durations. Half-loads will usually extend the
   full-load duration by about 3 times. If you can't find this number, UPS
   cases have an output (don't confuse with the input rating) Amp and Watt
   rating on the back. You can compare the total Amps or Watts to see if
   your estimate is reasonable. Pick a model that has at least a 25%
   increase in capability over the total V-A load. This allows longer run
   times and future increased loads.

4. Costs vary for battery capacity, component quality, design and
   features, and customer support. Expect to pay between $120-400 for
   popular models (from 200 to 650 V-A) from APC, Best, OPTI-UPS or
   TRIPP-Lite brands.

Save your #%% (CPU)

In real use even small SPSes can handle more than a minimal computer
set-up, such as my A2000, 8Mb RAM card, network board, a hardcard
controlling two SCSI devices, and a 1084 monitor.  The American Power
Corporation's Back-UPS 400 supports a large inefficient monitor and my
A4000 with lots of RAM, two hard drives and a network board by supplying
only 3.3 Amps.  Although this is close to its recommended limit, the
in-rush does not set off the alarm.  Some laser printer power supplies now
have their own MOVs to protect against power surges and don't need to be
attached to a suppressor or standby.  My printers, external speakers and
modem do not, but they are connected through a powerbar to a separate
integrated phone/power surge protector and can recycle when the power
returns.

When a dangerous power situation exists, the UPS will warn you with an
alarm.  I have been using my computer for months at a time with no
indication that anything is wrong.  Then, more than once and for no obvious
reason, the alarm has gone off 3-8 times within a few minutes!  Damage and
data loss could have occurred with the first hit, as these were more than
likely caused by sags or surges.  The lights did not flicker and neither
were any clocks blinking at me.  Without the alarm, I would never have
known there was a hit!

My computers have never been powered by a cell for an extended time to know
just how long my set-up would run on battery power, nor do I want to be in
this position.  Both supplies should be enough to keep things running for
less than 10 minutes, which is a long time to be without power.

Tips

Although a UPS can be bought in computer and chain stores, there are
specialists who can help you accurately assess your needs and sell you
power supplies that are not available from discounters.  Commonly, an SPS
is mistakenly called a UPS, so make sure you know what you are buying.  Any
good SPS, UPS or surge suppressor comes with a computer equipment
replacement guarantee of some sort - higher values are better, of course. 
Read and keep this guarantee!  Also, find out if the model you want allows
user replacement of the battery.  The sealed battery is protected from
being drained too deeply (below 10 volts), but don't leave it in a
discharged state.  There is PC, Mac and UNIX (no Amiga) software for some
models to automatically shut the system down so that you don't lose data if
the battery runs out of power.

Don't tempt fate by using computers during a local electrical storm.  If
power does go off, turn the power On/Off switch off so that equipment will
not be affected by a blast when the power returns.  Be careful if you plug
a big monitor or laser printer into the power outlet of the computer; you
may be taxing a low wattage computer power supply.  If you transport your
computer to a different location, such as a business demo or computer club
meeting, take your protection with you!  Don't forget that there is a
back-door into the computer through any telephone or network connection;
integrated phoneline surge suppressors are readily available.

With the summer storm and air-conditioner season soon upon us, some shocks
are coming your way, but by now you know how to keep the computer safe and
protected with clean, continuous power.  Inform yourself about your
purchases - use this info at your own risk.  Don't hold me responsible if
you make a wrong choice and your computer disintegrates in a cloud of
smoke.  Thanks go to Best Power Technology, Inc.  of Canada (800-356-5794),

             EZ135 Followup: The Search for Storage Continues
  Paul Idol                                     76375.1776@CompuServe.COM
===========================================================================

In Which the Search Ends in Disaster and the Author Likely Winds Up Dead of
a Shot in the Back, and for Good Cause

                            --- --- --- --- ---

Mea culpa.  Mea maxima culpa.

Some time ago, I told all you readers out in Amiga-Report-land to go forth
and buy SyQuest's EZ135 removable hard drive in quantities of a hundred.  
Probably a mistake.  Since that time, I've had to take a total loss on my
EZ and all the many EZ disks I bought.

If any of you have been burned by SyQuest's drive because of my review, my
apologies.  If you were burned because of my very late followup, you have
my permission to shoot me in the back if you see me on the street.  Yet I
claim innocence on the first count: the drive worked EXACTLY as I described
it for practically a month before I wrote that review!  Then, shortly after
the review was published, things went straight to hell.  The drive stopped
mounting disks.  So I tried it on my partner's 4000 (outfitted with a
Fastlane AND an Emplant), I tried it on a client's A3000 (I have an A3000,
so I figured this would be a good test) and on the Emplant SCSI port of my
own A3000.  Then, for reasons I won't get into here, I bought an A3000T and
tried the EZ on THAT machine.  Again, no dice.  I even broke open new EZ
disks I could otherwise have returned and tried the drive with them, to no
effect.

Naturally, during the course of all this frenetic testing, I called
SyQuest.  They got back to me after a couple days and told me they couldn't
help, that I'd have to contact the dealership from which I purchased the
drive.  Fair enough.  Except that during the time I was waiting for SyQuest
to return my call, the dealership's free return period lapsed!  So J&R
Computer World (an excellent place in NYC; I don't hold this against them)
reasonably enough told me to contact SyQuest.  But SyQuest was no help, and
I don't plan to ever buy one of their products again.

So anyway, to make a long story short, there I was, stuck with a useless
drive, some lost software, and a hole in my wallet approaching $300.  What
did I do?  I needed a largish removable-medium drive, so I broke down and
bought a Zip.  So far (and this time, the testing period has been rather
longer) it's worked fine.  It's slow as a dead dog, small, and the chassis
feels like it could crack open at any time from its own weight, but I have
no significant complaints.  (I'm dimly aware of the irony of that last
statement.  Dimly.)

My problem with the EZ appears to be part of a pattern of total
unpredictability.  I know a couple people who've had absolutely no trouble
with the EZ on the Amiga.  I know some people who can get the drive to work
on the Mac but not the Amiga.  And I know some who, like me, are just
screwed.

If the world were a better place, there'd be a cool-looking drive like the
Zip with its excellent load/eject mechanism and reliability but the speed
and capacity and solidity of the EZ.  But we all know the world isn't a
perfect place.  So for all you out there who haven't been conned yet, I
warn you: buy a Zip.  And for all you who have EZ drives and are content: I
envy you; stay away from me.

  Gerard Sweeney                                       Gss@arts.gla.ac.uk
===========================================================================

[In AR 4.08, we ran an overview of the Sci-Fi Sensations CD.  This review
was presented as a review of the second CD of that series, as it was
presented to the reviewer.  However, it was in fact just the second ISSUING
of the original CD-ROM.  This situation has been sorted out and the author
explains the mix-up.  We apologize to Epic Marketing for the error. -Jason]

Following a lengthy email exchange with Andy at Epic, I have been asked to
write the following statement to explain what it was all about.

When I wrote my article on Sci-Fi Sensations volume 2, I had just paid 20
quid for it under the impression that it was a completely new CD.  I was
annoyed, so I wrote the article which has managed to get me on Epic's most
wanted list :)

It now transpires that what is being called "Sci Fi Sensations volume 2" is
NOT a new CD, but an upgrade with any corrupt files from volume 1 removed.

This short note is to say that based on information given to me by Andy
that I now realise that it is an upgrade and my (frankly) rant about it
should, by and large, be ignored.

My only criticism of volume 2 now is that it would have been nice to have
seen some more files to replace the corrupt ones, and that it should be
displayed more clearly on the front of the CD that it is an upgrade.  Oh,
and some of the organisation is still a bit ropey.   However, I've been
told that this will hopefully be amended for the next update, and more
(Sci-Fi related) files will be added.

Just for the record, Weird Science (who I bought the CD from) were not the
only ones who thought it was a new CD...  I called several companies (Epic
included!), and they all assured me that it was a new CD..

My article was never meant to be a review, so the grammar in it was poor
(at best), and I may have made one or two damning statements which have
resulted in the request for my head upon a stick at Epic.   If I have any
further comments on the next UPDATE of Sci Fi Sensations (note the word
update CAREFULLY!), I'll let you know.

Oh, just a plug here - Sci Fi Sensations II (that's the ACTUAL, REAL
version, not an update) should be coming out soon, and should be a bit
special...  I'll let you know :)

  Bohus Blahut                                             bohus@xnet.com
===========================================================================

  The massive potential of the CD rom format took some time to reach the
Amiga market, but discs like this one more than make up for it.  While most
Amiga users have hard drives, CD rom drives haven't reached the level of
popularity as on other platforms.  While many of the files on this disc are
freely available for download from Aminet, the CD circumvents devoting hard
drive space to file storage. 

  This CD (and any other for that matter) is an inexpensive way to have a
sizable library of files conveniently on hand.  The files are also archived
for use on BBS's, or to facilitate easy movement on floppy discs.   In past
articles, we've discussed the uses of CDs for the graphic artists or
animator, but here's a disc designed to enhance the day to day enjoyment of
your computer. 

  This CD rom takes advantage of the massive storage (650 Megs) potential
of the disc rom format by offering the Amiga a huge number of new tools.  
With Amiga development coming in fits and bursts from a number of different
sources these days, this CD can help your Amiga continue to look modern.

  My favorite inclusion is artist Roger McVay's "New Icons"; an icon
replacement set.  New Icons is a set of very professional looking 256 color
icons, although the icons still look snappy even under a 16 color ECS
workbench.  I've installed these on my DraCo, and Amiga 2000 to give both
machines a sleek and professioanl appearance and get away from the rather
anemic looking Commodore icons. 

  Also included are several replacement icon sets by other authors
including the popular Magic WorkBench.  The CD includes an easy installer
script that will set up your Workbench for New Icons, and also install MUI
to help other applications on the disc run properly. 

  Users of Amiga Workbench 3.0 and above have an included AmigaDOS CD rom
driver.  This CD driver can be flakey at times, and is also unavailable to
OS 2.0 user, so I prefer the commercial product ASIMcdfs by ASIMware
Innovations.  ASIMcdfs includes several useful CD utilities.  There is a
Kodak photoCD to IFF convertor, and an audio CD player and librarian. 

  Many other utilities like these are avilable as shareware on this disc as
well, and at a discount!  The CD's booklet contains discount coupons, and
author's addresses for utilities such as: PowerPlayer, SuperView, and
ShapeShifter.  There is a Comm directory containing telecommunications and
networking software including Term and AMItcp.  The Sound directory has a
sampling (pun intended) of IFF sound samples from the another available
disc, the DaCapo sound CDrom.  The DaCapo CD has more than 10000 samples,
and 1400 MODs on it. 

    Additionally there are several commodities, screen blankers, MODs by
noted artists, music players, workbench games, text readers, and disk
copiers, but here are my personal favorites... 

  There is a graphics directory with the best WorkBench backgrounds and
patterns that I've ever seen.  There are many organic tileable textures,
and tools for modifying icons.  There are even directories of clipart and
Compugraphic fonts for creating your own artwork. 

  Also, there is an entire directory dedicated to emulation.  There's a
VIC-20 emulator, and the non-registered version of the ShapeShifter Mac
emulator.  The jewel in ShapeShifter's crown in this release is the
inclusion of a complete 50 meg Mac boot partition.  This means that you can
drop the partition onto your hard drive, and get Mac-ing away.  The Mac OS
7.0.1 is freely redistributable [sort of], and is enough to get you
started. 

  Ther are a couple of other fun Amiga utilities including LetterMatcher. 
This takes any 2bit graphic and converts it into ascii.  (See the Amiga
Logo at the Top of AR) I've often thought that it would be cool to take a
batch of animation frames, and convert them to these ascii representations
for a new look in animation. 

  There's also IntuiCookie, a really neat random fortune cookie generator.
One could conceivably drop this into the WBstartup drawer and get a
different inspirational mesage every boot up. 

  This CD is truly inspirational.  Hopefully this will spin off more Amiga
specific CD roms.  Often when I'm "painted into a corner", I can reach into
my stack of Amiga CDroms, and pull out a solution.  While it's unfortunate
that CDTV and CD32 weren't nearly as popular as they could've been,
hopefully this will not prevent companies from producing more excellent CDs
like this one.

                             By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Well, at least I know I'm not alone in the world anymore.  It was
refreshing to read CU Amiga's Aminet 11 review, where there was the same
frustration expressed that I've been talking about for some time now: just
what can I tell you about Aminet 12 that I haven't said about Aminets in
the past?

Ok, I do have one complaint.  The new disk icon is in my opinion inferior
to the old.  But beyond that, it's pretty much the same Aminet CD we've
come to expect-nice AmigaGuide interface, settable preferences, and the
featured theme is music, with a load of MODs and instrument files on tap.

The commercial software package this time around is, appropriately enough,
OctaMED 5, which should encourage you to consider OctaMED SoundStudio when
it becomes available later this summer.  Also included is a special version
of the soon-released Symphonie.  Both should be reviewed in upcoming Amiga
Report issues.

I swear, I keep watching for big problems and I'm just not finding them.

Of note on the CD is an MPEG animation of Urban Mueller juggling hard
drives.  It's horrifying to watch, especially the ending...

                      NetNews Offline CD-ROM Vol.  1
                             By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================


I suppose the nice thing to say about NetNews Offline is that it's the sort
of thing I think needs to exist.  It's just a shame it's not something that
deserves to fly off the shelves.

NetNews Offline, Volume 1 (promising more) is a CD full of archived Usenet
material from Amiga and computer-related newsgroups.  Included is the GRn
newsreader to make browsing through the hundreds of megs of text palatable.

Like I said, this is the sort of thing that deep down I like to see
existing.  I always wonder what history will record of this time period and
how it will be interpreted.  Past history seems to be based on a
ridiculously small sample of texts that survive wars, plague, and
destruction which may or may not really be indicative of an era.  While I'd
hardly say that Usenet is indicative of our era, it is a part of it, and I
hate to see collective wisdom just vanish.  The more places something that
is written is archived, the better.

Now, of course, is the flip side--do we really need the dozens of Amiga
Tech-slamming postings recorded for posterity?  More to the point, do you
personally?  While I will readily admit there are benefits to having a
Usenet archive handy (useful information really does get shared sometimes
and you forget to save it for future reference), there are public Web
search engines that allow for this sort of thing now.  I'm not sure having
the CD in your own home will be all that useful, because even on an 040
machine with a 4X CD-ROM drive, plowing through these thousands of messages
takes GRn quite a lot of time.  Another general GRn complaint is the amount
of overhead you need to get it to recordkeep for the CD (30 megs), and the
amount of time it takes to start running and quit.  It's a result of having
tens of thousands of articles to handle, but it's just that much LESS
convenient for the home user.

What about the other marketing angle of the CD, that it's for those who
either don't have time or don't have the connectivity for Usenet?  Well,
for the latter I suppose it's a relatively painless and risk-free way to
introduce them to what actually goes on in Usenet.  But part of Usenet's
whole concept is that it is interactive and shared.  The conversation on
the CD is already stale and dead (most likely) by the time you get the CD.
There's no good way for you to get your two cents in, unless you really
want to run the risk of reopening a dead issue and old wounds.  For the
former, those who don't have time for Usenet--if they don't have time to
browse through TIN on their service provider, they'll hardly have time to
go through stale dead Usenet articles on CD-ROM.

It's a good idea.  Years from now I know I'm going to enjoy pulling this
CD out, just to see the sorts of things that I used to talk about with
Usenet regulars of the era.  Who knows, there may not even BE a Usenet as
we know it by then.  But for the present day, I just don't see the value.
Altavista or DejaNews are just a whole lot cheaper and in general are going
to be faster to use, too.

                  EMC Phase4 Desktop Video Dreams CD-ROM
                             By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

You may not believe this, but there are a lot of people who use the Amiga
to produce videos.

All kidding aside, there's an awful lot of stuff out there to help video
amateurs, enthusiasts, and professionals put out a top-notch product.  The
problem, of course, is that a lot of it has been scattered about and it
takes a brave heart, not to mention someone with some time on his or her
hands, to go and dig up that particular subtitling program you heard was
good somewhere once.

EM Computergraphic decided to save you the trouble.  Their Phase 4 CD,
Desktop Video Dreams, is designed to pull a great deal of tools and useful
items for video producers together in one place--music, backgrounds,
textures, buttons, and editing and post-production tools such as image
processors and the aforementioned subtitlers.  A number of the packages
included are not full versions, such as the DeluxePaint 5 demo.

The CD is Amiga-only, with a friendly, personable, if not extravagant
layout.  Almost everything is easily accessed from CD, although there was a
small problem where an animation section presumes you have the proper
libraries installed on your system.

You'll definitely want to check out MMExperience and ImageVision if
pictures and video are your thing, and Phase4 brings them to one place for
you.  

EMC has done a solid job.  There are a lot of Amiga video hardware
companies but nobody really seems to have the foresight to produce a CD
such as this, as a companion piece to their customers' studio.  So EMC did
it and they deserve notice for it, Phase4 is a well-constructed
video-targeted CD.

                        Amiga Report Mailing List
===========================================================================

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to majordomo@amigalib.com

Your subject header will be ignored.  In the body of the message, enter

subscribe areport

The system will automatically pull your e-mail address from the message
header.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **

                          UUDecoding Amiga Report
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

===========================================================================
                      Amiga Report Writing Guidelines
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

     4.  Please send us your article in ASCII format.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.

Please stipulate as well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to
the editor.

                  Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users
===========================================================================

                The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
                  "Not just another UNIX Shell account!"

          -------------------------------------------------------

Portal is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-service online SIG
(Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users.  We promise, and WE
DELIVER ongoing & aggressive Amiga support!  Now, more than ever, with so
many Amiga magazines gone or shrunken, you need a viable,
professionally-maintained resource for information, software, and a link to
the world-wide Amiga community.

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in many ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA high-speed modems (you pay for the phone call
if it's not local), or though any SprintNet or Compuserve indial anywhere
(with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell service!  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help, and you can easily customize
it for your favorite terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1100 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files or
      100 email letters at once, of any size, with one command.
 * Amiga vendor areas with many companies participating.
 * So many incoming lines you'll probably NEVER get a busy signal
 * 40 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 12,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.
 * Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
      related and get quick replies from the experts.
 * Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, AMosaic, LightWave, ImageFX,
      Picasso II & others feed right into the Zone message bases.  Read
      months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with them.
 * FREE unlimited Internet Email with 5 meg of free storage.
      Your email is private, secure, and never censored or monitored.
 * A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.
      You can run AMosaic and other Browses via your shell and explore the
      vast World Wide Web!  Intermediate to advanced users can use
      any standard UNIX mail and news utilities, compilers, and other
      tools.  Ask for your free UNIX book when you sign up.
 * A home for your own Web page!  Your UNIX Shell on Portal is linked
      to Portal's Web Server. Create your own WWW pages for the whole
      world to access. No extra charges!
 * Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which you can read
      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine. Newsgroups are not censored!
 * Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
      never worry "Ooops... Am I paying more for this area?" again!
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS wrapped into user-friendly
      menus.  And you get FREE unlimited usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
      email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
 * Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
      at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
