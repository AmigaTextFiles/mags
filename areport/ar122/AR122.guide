This week, you'll find two JPEG files in the Amiga Report archive.  One is
a scan of a B&W photograph that accompanied the CD32 press release by
Commodore US.  The other is a JPEG of a GIF of the Atari Jaguar.  I know
you're not supposed to JPEG GIFs, but I didn't want to put a 50K GIF file
in the archive, when I could JPEG it down to 11K... it's a little fuzzy,
but the savings is worth it.  If anybody wants the actual GIF, it's in the
World of Video Games SIG on Delphi.  I also lowered the quality level on
the CD32 JPEG to drop it from 85K down to 38K.  It too is a little fuzzier
than the original, but I really didn't want to have a 200K archive this
week.  The original is available on Portal.  Many thanks to Harv Laser on
Portal for scanning the CD32 photo!

                              By John Deegan

  
    ATARI CORP. REVEALS PLANS FOR JAGUAR RELEASE - The Atari Jaguar, Atari
 Corp.'s 64-bit interactive multimedia entertainment system was unveiled at
 its headquarters yesterday to rave reactions and applause from the press.
 Atari's goal is to establish the Jaguar as the industry standard for
 interactive multimedia performance, made in the United States at an
 affordable price.
  
    Open to targeted gaming publications, as well as national and local
 media, the news conference served to show the press actual working
 Jaguars. A prototype of the CD peripheral, to be introduced next year, was
 also shown. The press had an opportunity to view several games in
 development, which included titles such as "Trevor McFur in the Crescent
 Galaxy," a spectacular true color, three dimensional multi-faceted game,
 "Alien vs. Predator," based on the blockbuster motion pictures from 20th
 Century Fox, and "Cybermorph," showcasing the Jaguar's ability to
 manipulate 3D shapes in a 3D world in real time.
  
    In addition, Atari President Sam Tramiel announced plans to distribute
 50,000 Jaguars in the New York and San Francisco markets this year, with a
 national roll-out next year. "We plan an aggressive advertising and
 marketing campaign for the fall," said Tramiel. "And by next year, we plan
 to sell more than 500,000 units."
  
    The news conference also served to bring to light technical aspects of
 the Jaguar which had not been made public until now. Presentations were
 made giving an overview of the Jaguar's 64-bit system architecture and
 actual proprietary chips which took Atari three years to develop.
  
    "The system's 64-bits are true 64-bits," said Tramiel. "There is over
 100 times more power in this compact unit than both the SNES and the
 Genesis."
  
  
    MICROSOFT IS SAID TO BE PREPARING NEW VERSION OF DOS 6.0 - Sources
 close to Microsoft Corp. are saying the software publisher is preparing to
 release a new version of its DOS 6.0 operating system.
  
    Reports are that the new release will be out this fall and includes
 protective measures designed to prevent problems with DoubleSpace, the new
 DOS's compression option. Microsoft has denied the alleged flaws.
  
  
    PHILIPS OFFERS VIDEO ON DEMAND DECODER - Philips Consumer Electronics
 has announced a compact digital set-top decoder for Video on Demand (VOD)
 applications over telephone wire.
  
    The designated Home Interactive Multimedia Terminal converts 1.5 Mbit/s
 digital TV signals into NTSC or Pal analog signals for display on standard
 television sets.
  
    First applications are expected to be in Video Dial Tone (VDT) where
 telephone companies are experimenting with delivering digital TV signals
 into the home via existing twisted-pair telephone lines. Typically,
 hundreds of movies will be stored on a telephone network server. The user
 at home will view an on- screen catalog of the available movies and order
 selections.
  
    The control system receives signals from an infrared remote control and
 relays them back into the communications network. This enables interactive
 control of remote source material with VCR-like functions such as Play,
 Stop, Pause, etc. It also allows data from the video server -- such as the
 movie catalog -- to be displayed on the screen.

    The highly integrated Home Interactive Multimedia Terminal combines
 three systems in one compact unit; a standard T1 communications interface
 system, an MPEG-1 decoder and a control system.

    While viewing television, it's still possible to use the telephone line
 for regular calls. Billing for telephone can also be separated from
 billing for the TV services.
  
  
    MAN DRAWS PRISON TIME FOR DISTRIBUTING PORN THROUGH A BBS - A Campbell,
 Calif., man has been sentenced to five years and eight months in state
 prison for distributing pornographic materials through a computer bulletin
 board system.
  
    The man, William David Steen, also has been ordered to pay a $1,200
 fine. Steen pleaded no contest in March to charges he distributed
 pornography through the BBS to two Sacramento teenagers.
  
    Authorities say Steen used the BBS to make contact with the teens in
 1991 and later provided them with computer equipment and pornographic
 materials.
  
  
    L.A. NAMED TOP PIRACY CITY - Los Angeles now is the nation's top city
 for software piracy, according to research by the Software Publishers
 Association.
  
    In a statement from Washington, the SPA says that during the year
 ending June 30 it brought 34 piracy cases -- including suits and audits of
 businesses and other organizations for compliance with federal copyright
 laws -- to a close in L.A.
  
    The SPA says New York and San Francisco rank second and third as
 America's most notorious cities for software pirates. The SPA concluded 28
 actions against pirates in New York and 18 in San Francisco.
  
    Fourth and fifth-ranked cities in the SPA study are Houston and Dallas,
 with 14 and 10 cases respectively.
  
    Meanwhile, the SPA says its work also:
  
    -:- Ranks California, Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois, 
    respectively, as the top five states for anti-piracy actions over the 
    past three years. Together, they account for nearly two-thirds (62%) 
    of the SPA's actions.
  
    -:- Shows that since 1990, five types of organizations were most 
    likely to be involved in anti-piracy actions: manufacturers, consul-
    tants, retailers, financial service providers and engineering firms. 
    Manufacturers were involved in 24% of the actions, while consulting 
    firms were implicated in 22%, retail businesses in 15%, financial 
    service providers in 9% and engineering firms in 7%.
  
   
    FEDS TO FUND CHIP RESEARCH - The U.S. Commerce Department has drafted a
 plan to subsidize research on certain types of computer chips.
  
    Sources say the plan is the clearest sign yet of the administration's
 desire to help high-technology industries in the international marketplace
 rather than through protectionist tariffs on imports.
  
    An unnamed administration official said that while the U.S. reliance on
 imports of the devices "doesn't present an immediate threat to national
 security, improving the capabilies of the domestic industry is desirable
 for both economic and national security."
  
    The plan calls for the creation of a federally financed research center
 for chip packages and more research spending on chip packaging materials.
 It also calls for Defence Department advice to the domestic industry on
 how to win more military contracts, and a working group of federal and
 industry officials to review ways to increase efficiency.
  
    The total cost of the effort has not been worked out.

COMMODORE US ANNOUNCES AMIGA CD32


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT: Lauren Keffer
Commodore Business Machines, Inc.
(215) 431 ,9478

Commodore Announces Introduction of
the Amiga CD32

(West Chester, PA, August 13, 1993) Commodore Business Machines today
announced the introduction of the Amiga CD32 to be held at the World of
Commodore Amiga show in Pasadena, California on September 10, 1993. The
new Amiga CD32, a 32,bit game console with a double-speed CD-ROM drive,
is based on the very successful Advanced Graphics Architecture TM chip
set. It can display and animate graphics in 256,000 colors to create
realistic, three-dimensional graphics and animations for games and video
applications.

Similar in appearance to other types of game consoles, the Amiga CD32
includes a hand-held, 11-button game controller and connectors for
standard Amiga mouse, joystick and keyboard. The Amiga CD32 is easily
connected to a TV set,composite monitor or SVHS video monitor.

The Amiga CD32 provides users with access to many existing CDTV game and
reference titles. Psygnosis, Ocean, Acclaim, Virgin Games and other
notable game developers are introducing new games for the Amiga CD32 .
About 30 games are expected to be available by October, 1993.

An optional MPEG module allows software developers to incorporate video,
movie segments and TV-like backgrounds into their applications. This
technology provides game enthusiasts with a new class of action-packed
games that include CD-quality sound. The Amiga CD32 plays VideoCD
industry standard full-motion music videos and movies as well as standard
audio CDs and CD+G discs.

Price for the Amiga CD32 will be competitive with the price of 1 6-bit
systems.

       AmigaDOS and KickStart are trademarks of Commodore-Amiga, Inc.
       Linda is a registered trademark of Scientific Computing Associates.

       Ported to the Amiga, supported and sold by AugmenTek.

       This product includes software developed by the University of
       California, Berkeley and its contributors.

DESCRIPTION

       TorqueWare for the Amiga is a programming tool that allows your
       program to:

           *  run faster by using multiple processors,

           *  share data among multiple processors/processes,

           *  access data by partial content, and

           *  be source-code portable to other TorqueWare-supported
              computers.

       TorqueWare can be thought of as  a compiler extension that allows
       you to distribute computation and data within one or among more than
       one processors, as in a network of computers or (in the future)
       multiprocessor boards.  By itself it does not, say, accelerate
       rendering or create software agents for you, but it provides the
       means by which rendering can be accelerated (tests show an almost
       linear speedup with raytracing code) and software agents can be
       developed and coordinated.  Like a compiler, there is no good
       demonstration of its capabilities, since its utility depends on the
       creativity of the programmer. There are, however, two good books
       that provide some insight on how to program in parallel and possible
       uses of this programming model ('Mirror Worlds' by Gelernter).

       This programming tool is a simple but powerful way to build
       distributed programs, and is based on the Linda(R) programming
       model.  It provides the means to coordinate multiple processes and
       access a global data space from one or more processors.  A run-time
       system and six C function calls allow adding data to and
       removing/reading  data from that global data space, and executing
       functions either remotely or locally. To change from running
       locally, where one develops and tests on one processor with
       multitasked processes, to running in a distributed fashion is simple
       and involves no recompilation or linking (unless you are running on
       a non-Amiga system).

       TorqueWare for the Amiga interoperates with other TorqueWare
       products available from Torque Systems, Inc.  Their products run on
       Apple Macintosh computers, Silicon Graphics workstations, and other
       computers, and are accessible using just the Base Development System
       and Ethernet hardware.

       The Base Development System consists of the C preprocessor,
       standalone  local link libraries, local and network support tools,
       example programs,  a graphical user interface (to setup and start
       execution), and online documentation (including a tutorial).   The
       local tools allow development of parallelized applications using
       multitasking on one computer; therefore,  nearly all applications
       will run slower than their equivalent sequential  versions.

       Creating a networked application for an all-Amiga (or mixed) network
       involves purchasing the networking add-on product for each
       additional CPU and  setting some switches -- no coding change is
       generally required. The networked application will run faster than
       the local if there is a good deal more computation than
       communication.  Some applications are simply more feasible to model
       and maintain in a distributed fashion rather than in a sequential
       one; speed may not be the only reason to distribute your application
       across a network.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

       *  AmigaDOS/Kickstart(TM) 2.04 or higher
       *  Approximately 275KB RAM plus 85KB per local process, additional
       *  SAS/C(R) compiler
       *  General TCP/IP Networking add-on:

              -  Networking hardware: Ethernet, Arcnet, serial port;
                 parallel port (with Shareware plip.device)

              -  About 150KB RAM plus 85KB per remote process

PRICE

       All prices are in U.S. currency.

       Base Development System : $100.
       General TCP/IP Network add-on, per Amiga CPU: $200.

       Applicable tax and shipping/handling are not included in the list
       prices.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

       Only items marked as being freely-redistributable are.  All others
       are NOT distributable.

       Any object code or executable code that is linked with TorqueWare
       link libraries must be licensed by AugmenTek for distribution. There
       are no restrictions on distributing source code that contains
       TorqueWare calls, or resulting object code that is not linked with
       TorqueWare link libraries.

       This means that executable public domain, freeware/giftware,
       shareware,  and demos (and possibly other forms of public software)
       that include executable TorqueWare calls to link libraries,
       managers, network listeners and servicers are not permitted.

your new machine anymore, you could come home with something you always
wanted.  Printers, HardDrives, Monitors, Genlocks, Games, Utilities, and
other software or hardware are all accepted.
    Plus, as added incentive, we are having a raffle, with many new and
exciting things being given as prizes. Just a few of the prizes to the ever

INOVAtronics ANNOUNCES NEW LICENSING AND DISTRIBUTION POLICY


Inovatronics, Inc

RE: New CanDo 2.5 Runtime License and Distribution Policy

Dear CanDo User,

With respect to changes in Commodore's marketing and repositioning of 
the Amiga computer we've modified our policy regarding the distribution 
of software created using CanDo.  With the marketplace becoming more 
vertically positioned with specialized needs and less high volume, main 
stream oriented, Inovatronics is adjusting to compensate,  This alteration 
will particularly affect developers that market and sell their software 
commercially.

Specifically, there are three types of software license arrangements that 
are available to developers.

1. Shareware and Freely distributed software.

Authors of non-commercial applications that are to be distributed 
freely among other enthusiasts and hobbyist may acquire a special 
version of CanDo Deckbrowser and DeckBinder.  Deckbrowser may 
then be included with the author's application and enable any Amiga 
user to run the CanDo application.  Authors may obtain Deckbrowser 
and DeckBinder simply by providing a copy of their distributed CanDo 
application to Inovatronics, Inc.  When launched, the new 
Deckbrowser now contains a small notice stating that it is explicitly for 
non-commercial use only.

2. Commercially marketed, sold and distributed software packages.

Developers of commercial software packages that are authored 
partially or entirely with CanDo must obtain a software license 
agreement from Inovatronics, Inc.  A custom CanDo runtime system 
will be provided to the developer that may be distributed with the 
application.  The developer will be charged a yearly license fee for the 
runtime system that will be determined by Inovatronics, Inc.  Typical 
fees will range between $50 to $200 and based upon the actual 
application.  This license will cover single or multiple software titles and 
apply toward all units sold.

3. Business, institutional, and value added software, used by or sold with 
vertically oriented hardware systems.

Businesses, Institutions and Value Added Resellers that customize 
systems with CanDo applications then disseminate or resell the 
software/hardware solutions are required to either include a CanDo 
retail unit or license a CanDo runtime system from Inovatronics for 
each hardware delivery system.  Fees will be based on specific 
application and will be designed to be very cost effective for the user.

Given these new policies, and with accurate information concerning our 
users, we can offer better support and more powerful and flexible 
products in the future.

If you have additional questions or would like more information please 
write or phone us at 1-214-340-4991.

Thank You

Tim Martin
President

Re:  Busy Signal Advisory


We have been experiencing busy signals lately.  This message is to remind
you of the best phone number for you to call.

If you are calling with a 2400 baud modem, dial 408/725-0561
If you are calling with a 9600 (v.32), 14400 (v.32bis) or a PEP modem, dial
        408/973-8091

In order to cut down on busy signals, we urge you to connect to the correct
modem pool.  Only 1/3 of our 2400 baud modems are in use, while our high

    ---------------------------------



Below is a message from a friend who has decided to take the plunge and
get a PC.  This is partially due to GEnie's recent Commodore Insider's
Conference.  This conference was, in my opinion, in extremely poor taste.
It portrayed Commodore as a company that will be dead in six months.  Yet
this is not true.  The answers given by these so-called "Insiders" whose
handles are DEEPMODEM and DEEPTHOUGHT were simply speculation.  None could
be confirmed as fact.  Most of their answers were "Nope" or "Don't know."
The air of the conference was of doom and gloom.  Why on earth GEnie ran
this conference is beyond me.  All it has done is cause more Amiga owners
to sell out for other platforms.  It has managed to pour salt into a
long-open wound.  I will not print the conference for two reasons... first,
we do not support GEnie anymore, and haven't for several months.  Secondly,
it did enough damage just on GEnie.  I'm not going to have a hand in
circulating it further.

This is my friend's message:

If you want a PC, buy a PC.  I'm not going to try to stop you.  It's just
that I refuse to purchase inferior technology (be it software or hardware)
just to have what everybody else has.  I refuse to help make Microsoft any
richer.  Intel chips SUCK and that's all there is to it.  The design stinks.
When PC's go RISC, I'll consider it, but as long as they use the current
Intel chips, no way.  Talk to any programmer that has written for a Motorola
chip and they'll tell you how bass-ackwards Intel chip design is.  I sure
hope the PowerPC chips aren't like this.

If you have to buy a PC, at least wait until the first of the year... by
then, 486's will be really cheap, what with the Pentium out in force by
that time.  Upgrading a 486 to a Pentium is a bad idea... you're getting a
32-bit version of a 64-bit chip, so you gain nothing.  If you want a
Pentium, get a Pentium.  Otherwise get a 486/66 and leave it at that.

When I can get a PC that can multitask as well as the Amiga (which means
being able to format four floppies at once, download at 14.4K and who
knows what else), for under $2000, I'll consider it.  I don't have $4000
for a top-of-the-line Dell, Gateway, Insight, Zeos or whatever.

Now, the side of me that loves playing with new technology would LOVE to
have one of those PC's to augment my 1200.  And I'd also like to have a
Falcon.  Just because it's new and different.  But I refuse to replace a
superior machine with an inferior DOS box, no matter how good the software
has gotten, again, just to have what everybody else has.  The software on
the Amiga is very, very nice.  I have no problem at all with Final Copy II,
ADPro, Directory Opus, ImageMaster, GPFax, etc.

But it all comes down to the fact that clones have become so popular, that
nothing else is considered very seriously.  People buy them without a 
second thought.  Then they bitch and moan about not being able to use it.
Far too many times have I volunteered to help somebody that just bought a
PC learn to use it.  I should have said "Did you ask me BEFORE you bought
it?  No?  Then why are you asking me now?"  And let them lie in their own
bed.

I must disagree about PC's not being difficult to setup.  My roommate has
a loaded Gateway 2000 486DX/33, and is constantly bitching about how hard
it is to make things work.  He's a hacker-type too.  He has four different
config.sys files that he has to use to make various programs and games
work, thanks to the ever-present 640K barrier.  And no matter what front-end
you use (Windoze, Norton Desktop, etc), you'll STILL have to use that damn
DOS prompt at one point or another.  On the Amiga, the CLI is an OPTION,
not REQUIRED.

You should have heard him the night he tried installing OS/2!  About every
fifteen minutes he'd scream "This isn't so [censored] hard on an ST!"
(he's a former Atari ST owner, like myself).  To this day, OS/2 is NOT on
his machine.  It just didn't want to run properly.  Gee, maybe eight meg
of RAM and a 340 meg hard drive just isn't enough.  <grin>

I didn't find my Amiga hard at all to get running.  Once I had the hard
setup, it was just a matter of tinkering with my preferences until I liked
what I saw.  It's the same thing in Windows really.  But you still have to
create your config.sys and autoexec.bat files.  And there are all the
different IRQ settings to deal with when installed new boards (Soundblaster
for example).  And let's not forget that a minimum useable Windows environ-
ment is a 486 with localbus video and a 200 meg localbus hard drive.  Any-
thing less is a waste of time.  So by then you're looking at around $2000
for a reputable brand (remember, you get what you pay for) with decent
support.  Thanks, but I can have a really nice A4000/030 for that kind of
money.

                      ------------------------------



A public response to GEnie's Commodore Insiders Conference by Denny Atkin:


Yeah, it was depressing. But I also think things aren't quite as bad as they
seemed. There are still how many companies out there doing Amiga stuff right
now and doing well enough to take out multi-thousand-dollar ads in AmigaWorld?
Recent products like Brilliance, VT4000, and Emplant have done great. And the
conference hosts said that the 4000 is selling very well and only problem with
A1200 sales is that Commodore can't afford to manufacture enough to keep up
with demand -- which means the machine's popular.
 
Also, some of the comments have to be taken in perspective. It was obvious
that the conference guests were employees or ex-employees in the development
department -- they knew technical stuff, but they wrote off many questions
with "that's a marketing question." So many of the answers were from an
engineer's perspective. Some of them bothered me, like the comment about the
Amiga being technically behind the times. Well, perhaps, compared to the new
IBM PowerPC or the SGI Indy. But compared to this month's local bus PC design?
Or the latest Mac running System 7.1? I don't think so. (Okay, maybe the AV
Macs...) Anyway, I thought a lot of the tone of the Amiga being behind was
from the perspective of someone who's hot on the latest technology, which is
not necessarily what's in use out there -- or what will be in use out there a
year from now either.
 
YES, it is disturbing that development may have stagnated at CBM. But that
doesn't mean it's time to write off the Amiga. It may be time to consider
getting a new computer two or three years down the road, but guess what? You'd
need to consider that no matter WHAT you're using. Two years ago games were
designed with 286 machines in mind, and many were EGA. Now there are actually
games that need a 66MHz PC to play smoothly. And on the Mac... Apple has
publicly said that Motorola processors are on the way out and they're going
PowerPC, so you'll probably want to replace the Mac in a couple of years too.
And RISC and PowerPC machines may be the hottest things for the technical
literati two years from now, rather than Intel machines. In other words, the
Amiga is competitive RIGHT NOW. (IMHO, anyway.) If development is indeed
stagnated and Commodore will be behind the times in a year or two, that won't
be good. But chances are pretty good that whatever else you buy today will be
just as outdated then too. (A couple of months ago I bought a 486DX2/66 for
work -- at the time it was literally the fastest PC you could buy. Now there
are PCs available that are twice the speed.)
 
Another thing to consider is how much doom and gloom to accept from people
named DEEAnyway, yes, I'm wary of what's going to happen. I think a lot of the
future depends on how CD32 does overseas this Christmas. I certainly doubt
we'll see AAA this year, or AA+. But I'm not ready to pronounce Commodore dead
yet.
 
How does what Commodore's working on RIGHT NOW affect what how well your
computer works RIGHT NOW? It doesn't. There's not the quantity, but there
IS the quality.

/// Amiga Report Available via the World Wide Web!
    ----------------------------------------------
    By Michael Witbrock
    (mjw@cs.cmu.ed witbrock@x25.bix.com)


Although AmigaGuide is still the best way to browse Amiga Report, the
magazine is  now also available in a form which may be more convenient for
people with direct Internet access.

Amiga Report is being converted weekly to a document readable via the World
Wide Web, allowing immediate access without the chore of dearchiving and
downloading to an Amiga.  Within a day (often less) of its release, each
Amiga Report starting from AR118 will be  converted into an HTML hyper-
document that behaves as similarly as possible to the AmigaGuide version,
and will be made available at this URL:

<a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/People/mjw/Computer/Amiga/OnlineMags.htm
l">
OnlineMags
</a>

For those who don't recognize that, a URL is a Uniform Resource Locator,
which specifies access method and location information for information
readable with WWW browsers such as NCSA mosaic. NCSA mosaic is a self
contained program running under the X window system, and is  available
for anonymous FTP from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in directory /Mosaic.

Even if you don't plan to read AmigaReport by this means, I strongly
recommend that you get a copy of NCSA mosaic and play with it. The
amount of information (in the form of pictures, sounds, text, and mpeg
movies) it makes easily available is astounding, and the program itself
is a marvel of good user interface design. I hope that someone will use
the recent attempts at PD TCP/IP networking solutions and port the
program to the Amiga.

Happy browsing!

Sept. 10-12, 1993

Note: I'm posting this in the public interest. I'm not involved with

press releases and then claiming ownership of them and demanding reprint
credits is, at best, an odious act.

This schedule was mailed to me. I scanned it with my Epson ES300C flatbed
scanner using ASDG's ADPro Epson driver, then imported the saved IFF
monochorme scans into MiGraph's OCR software and let it chew on them and
spit out ASCII text. Spellchecking and reformatting were then done with
WordPerfect for the Amiga, that horrible & obsolete software that's still
(IMHO) the best all-around workhorse Amiga word processor :-)

/// The Emulation Examiner
    ----------------------
    By Jason Compton
    (jcompton@mlinknet.uucp)


                Or:  Whatever else I decide to ramble about


Hello again, everybody. I'd like to take this article as a chance to leave my
rapid-fire emulation evaluation format and propose a course of action for the
future of the Amiga, involving (what else?) emulators.  Since I have a
mindless job, I have a lot of time to think, and I managed to come up with a
plan so detailed I was even able to come up with names for the products I
propose.  I know that Commodore marketing suggestions are a dime a dozen, but
please, hear me out.  If I'm right, this plan could well snag all of the
people blindly lured into buying IBMs or Macs, by giving them what they think
they want, and getting them an Amiga to boot.  Throw an 030 Amiga (I've
decided in each case which Amiga computer would be ideal to launch the model
from) at customers bundled with the computer the neighbors have.  Put a bloody
hard drive and monitor in the package so you don't confuse and scare off the
people and look less impressive than the competition in the process.
Without further ado, I unveil my line of suggested products, and even analyze
how their cost could come out...just in case there's any misunderstanding, I'd
like to say up front that none of what I'm about to talk about is based on ANY
fact.  These suggested product lines are COMPLETELY the figment of my
imagination, but I think they're a very good idea. 

          The Commodore Amiga Double Dimension line-

Offering not only the power and versatility of the Amiga computer and
Commodore's Workbench environment [note: I really don't care if it's 2.x or
3.x at this point], as well as stunning compatibility with the IBM-compatible
or Macintosh line of computers, all in the space of one desktop computer. 
Suggested models include:

The Double Dimension Plus:
Using an Amiga 3000 (or even an ECS 2000, which would be much cheaper but
would involve restarting the 2000 line), a hard drive in the 120-250meg range
(SCSI), a high-density floppy drive and ReadySoft's Amax-IIPlus board, the
Double Dimension Plus would deliver the power and speed of the Mac II line at
a greatly reduced cost, considering you get two computers out of the deal. 
The Mac side would emulate a Macintosh Plus, able to access virtually any
Amiga peripheral, or adding its own dedicated Mac hardware.  The 3000's
display (or the 2000's ECS Productivity) would give a flicker-free screen with
much greater resolution than the real Mac Plus.
Cost: Simply putting together the cost from magazine ads, taking (these may
vary wildly from source to source, I simply want to get an idea here) the 3000
030/25mhz/5meg/105meg at $1000, a usable monitor at $400, AmaxIIPlus at $300,
and 128k Mac ROMs at $130, we've got a $1830 system here. Obviously, not
anything to get REAL excited about, since used Mac Pluses would go for much
less.  Selling all of this as a package, however, the unit costs would be
less, so the price could conceivably drop by a couple of hundred. That's not
bad, considering you get two rather nice, rather fast computers.

The Double Dimension II
(For evaluation purposes, I'll use an Amiga 4000 as the example computer)
Based off of Commodore's AGA and Workbench 3.x systems, the Double Dimension
II offers all of the features of the 4000 (a quarter million color
simultaneous display possible) and other incredible graphic, sound, and
productivity possibilities, and includes Utilities Unlimited's Emplant board,
which offers a fully-functional Mac II-series computer which can multitask and
share peripherals with the Amiga. The Amiga provides a Mac color display of up
to 256 colors, and the Emplant accepts Mac boards to increase that display
even further.
Cost: This setup is difficult for me to price. Commodore would have to do some
shuffling of its 4000-production to include a SCSI rather than an IDE drive,
but let me provide some rough figures. A4000/030/120meg (listed as IDE, but
let's assume SCSI) is $1750.  A well-featured Emplant board is around the
$400-$450 mark. Get a good monitor for around $400 more. 256k Mac ROMs, call
it $300. Estimated cost of putting this thing together piecemeal is $2850. 
Remember, again, putting all of this together as a system would reduce the
cost considerably.  Nobody said buying two computers would be cheap, but this
DOES come out less expensive than buying both.  And I never claimed that
people wouldn't have to be sold on the Amiga too. That's an integral part. 
This plan would make them feel like they weren't giving anything up in buying
an Amiga.  Let me forge forward...

The Amiga Double Dimension 386
Here's where my plan gets complicated: For the IBM models, I propose
restarting the line up on 2000 production.  It's got the most drive bays.  I
also propose that all 4 PC slots be made 16 bit on the line, rather than
leaving it as a hack for users.  Using any model above the 2000 is somewhat
wasteful, unless you're after AGA...
This Amiga model would provide the flexibility and expansion of the Amiga 2000
(the original Toaster platform), as well as full access to the PC world
through a 386/25 bridgeboard.  While I use the term "Bridgeboard", since
Vortex's Golden Gate 386 is the only 386 board still in production (Commodore
is welcome to restart their 386sx line, but I feel that the Vortex board is
superior), it would be the logical board to use.
Cost: Again, tricky. Take a 1 meg ECS 2000 (the clearance models now) at
$500-$600. Add an 030/25 board with an 80 meg HD for the Amiga side.  I'll
call that $550.  Add the Vortex board, around $450. Since we've now got 3 free
16 bit slots, add an SVGA board, IDE floppy controller (HD is on the Vortex
board) and a port card at leisure, which will run no more than $120. Better
throw in a rather large IDE drive for the space-inefficient PC, say, 170 megs
for around $250.  The 2000 will, naturally, need to come standard with a
high-density drive to support the 386 with, but I'll let C= nail that price
problem out. Add a SVGA monitor, around $350 tops.  Add some SIMMs, say, 4 or
6 megs worth (and it doesn't particularly matter where you put them, since the
Golden Gate board allows considerable memory sharing between the Amiga and
386), which puts us around $250-$350.  Rough total on this, just putting it
together like I have been, is $2170. That, of course, is what 486/66s have
been going for lately.  But I can't stress enough how much it needs to be
stressed that these are TWO good computers for the price of one.

Finally, the top of the line...
The Amiga Double Dimension 486
Actually, I can't say much else about this model that I didn't about the model
above, except that it would be either a 486/25 (Golden Gate) or 486/33 (if
they go with the EMC 486 board, an offshoot of C='s 2386sx BridgeBoard).  The
major differences occur in cost...
Cost: Take the system I described above, but substitute $900 for the
BridgeBoard in question, and take into account this: The EMC board is not
expandable by use of SIMMs, and the Amiga cannot use EMC board memory.  The
EMC board can use Amiga memory as EMS, however, so memory placement is more
vital than with the Golden Gate.  In addition, EMC's board comes with a floppy
controller rather than a hard drive controller, which could jack up the price
a little. With all said and done, we're about in the $2600-$2650 range, more
expensive than many 486/66 systems, but we're at half the speed.  Once again,
say it with me, everyone, you've got to sell the consumer on the Amiga, too.

In summary, these packages look a lot more expensive than their Macintosh or
IBM counterparts, with good reason, because you're getting an Amiga.  I do not
mean to suggest that the Amiga should simply be a beast of burden for IBM and
Mac emulation, but I think that Commodore has lost such a huge group of
customers that they must be won back with the very same machines they're
flocking to.  Just make sure they get the Amiga.  Sooner or later, they're
bound to use it.
I say we grab these people with ads...preferably not television, since that
didn't seem to work too well last time, but if television is the media of
choice (maybe combat Apple's MTV ads), produce it on an Amiga, and tell
everyone so.


Final Note: I had planned to sum up a second line, proposing that both a Mac
and IBM emulator be enclosed, but the cost would be rather high. It might be
something to seriously consider, though, when PowerPC comes out and the clone
makers crank out really expensive models. Jump in with the Amiga Triple
Alliance, and smugly say, "We've been able to do that all along." Better yet,
beat PowerPC to the punch. Do it now, preempting any real serious need for
PowerPC.  Why bother buying a system that can run cross-platform software when
all you need to do is Amiga-M to the computer you want?

/// Another Moronic, Inane and Gratuitous Article
    ---------------------------------------------
    by Chad Freeman
    (cjfst4+@pitt.edu or cjfst4@cislabs.pitt.edu -- Internet)
    (cfreeman -- BIX)



     Well, after a short two-week vacation, your fearless author is back, and
with a new computer to boot.  Yes, that's right, after my trusty old A2000
started sounding like a weed-whacker, I decided it was time to trade him in for
a new model.  Because of the overwhelming significance of this event in your
humble author's life, he has directed the AMIGA Mis-Testing Labs (AMTL) to delay
their review of the Implant so that their crack technical team can review...

     THE COMMODORE AMIGA 1200

     When AMTL first received the A1200 from a local dealer (yes, AMTL
_DOES_ have a local dealer, Mega-Bytes in Pleasant Hills, PA; 412-653-9050
(<shameless plug>), we were impressed with the patriotic red, white and blue
packaging. Upon arriving at the AMTL compound, we were even more impressed
when opening of the package revealed a CPU made in the Phillipines, a mouse
and power supply made in Malaysia, and a manual that was printed in one of
a dozen or so foreign countries.  It is good to see Commodore continuing
this time-honored American tradition, even though many other businesses have
abandoned the idea.

     Aside from the CPU, power supply, "dove bar" style mouse, and
reversible picture of Jim Gould and Bill "WindoWiener" Gates in dart-board
shape, AMTL found two manuals, a surprisingly small amount of styrofoam, the
usual amounts of poly bags and twisties, several sheets of paper either laid
in the box or stuffed into the aforementioned manuals, an RCA cable and an
old-fashioned cable/tv box. It gave AMTL a feeling of nostalgia to see this
old manual-switch box with the 300 ohm "crab claw" style connector.  It took
us back to the old Atari 800 and C-64 days, from whose overproduction runs
these obviously came.

     After carefully reading the setup instructions (yeah right), AMTL
plugged the necessary cables, cords, devices and thingamabobs into the "CPU
unit with integral keyboard" and powered up the system.  After an
agonizingly long period of time, AMTL finally realized it had left the
power strip turned off and after rectifying this error (this really should
be mentioned in the documentation) the unit came on and began to boot up.

     What happened next was dull and boring, so AMTL will not (unlike most
other reviewers) go into the details.  Instead, we will present the results
of our various tests in handy-dandy table format.

     TEST                          RESULT                        RATING
     Power on                      OK                            5 stars
     Boot up                       OK                            5 stars
     Idle                          OK                            5 stars
     Power off                     OK                            5 stars

     AMTL realizes these tests are incomplete, but in the short amount of
time we were working with, we were unable to put the A1200 through its true
paces.  However, based on the testing we have done as summarized above, we
give the A1200 5 stars, our "good" rating (we go from 1 to 7.432 stars, or
the number of hogsheads in a rod and 2 bushels...don't you love the English
measurement system?).  If we did have the time to _really_ work over the
A1200, I'm sure our rating would be suitably higher, because after all we
spent $480 bucks on this thing, and it would be kind of stupid if we didn't
like it, right?

                               END OF REVIEW


     Well, thank you AMTL for a somewhat useless and moderately humorous
review.  But now on to the REAL business of AMIGA, which is, um, uh, well, I
guess we don't HAVE a real business, do we?  I mean, this is SUPPOSED to be
Moronic, Inane and Gratuitous, right?  After all, how else are we supposed
to fool people into believing that the title of our article isn't just a
clever reverse-engineered acronym?  Well great, then, that review was pretty
inane, so I guess we're just about finished here.  All that's left is...

                SELECTIONS FROM THE MICROSLOTH QUOTE FILE:

     'Our philosophy behind designing Windoze was simple:  make it eat up as
     many system resources as possible and fill it with lots of colorful
     graphics so people really DO believe its more powerful that a TI-81
     graphing calculator!'

/// Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users
    --------------------------------------



                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA or through Tymnet from anywhere in
North America.  If you have an account on another Internet-connected
system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet programs, from
anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users can now Telnet
into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 - Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files, online, 24 hours a day.
   Portal has dedicated a 2.5 GIGabyte disk drive to the Amiga Zone.
   We have virtually unlimited space for files and new uploads. 

 - The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable
   software, online.  All of it.  Every disk.  Well-organized so
   it's easy to find exactly what you're after.

 - Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

 - Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES,
   and many others including Compute's Amiga Resource with over
   4 Megabytes of exclusive Compute magazine disk stuff you won't find
   elsewhere.

 - 35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.  Since Portal has FTP connections we can get
   new freely-distributable software online within MINUTES of its 
   being announced on Usenet.

 - No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.  Start downloading
   files with your first session on Portal. 

 - Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.
   Instead of stumbling around in frustration you can talk to the
   people who design your hardware, who write your software.

 - Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

 - Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

 - FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
 - Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  Usenet feeds into Portal many times each hour.
   There are 14 Amiga-specific Usenet newsgroups with hundreds of
   articles posted every day, including postings by Commodore 
   personnel.  Since Usenet is distributed worldwide, your questions
   and answers can be seen by literally hundreds of thousands of
   people the same day you post them.  

 - Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

 - The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
 - Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
 - All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

 - Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

 - And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Tymnet 9600bps services is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

/// Delphi Online Conference:  The Atari Jaguar
    -------------------------------------------


[Editor's Note:  In the interest of covering the entire industry, we're
running the Delphi conference on Atari's new Jaguar video game system due
out in October.  Hopefully Delphi will have a similar conference for the
CD32 in the near future!]


On August 25, 1993, a formal Atari conference was held on the Delphi
information service (e-mail to VIDGAMES@DELPHI.COM or
VIDGAMES@NETCOM.COM for signup info). The conference was held to spread
info on the recently announced Atari Jaguar game system. Moderating was
Andy Eddy, former Executive Editor for VideoGames & Computer
Entertainment magazine. Guests were Sam Tramiel, president of Atari,
and Bob Brodie, Atari's director of communcations.

After a lengthy delay of nearly 20 minutes while chaos reigned due to a
temporary bug in Delphi's conference software, the CO started and
attendees got to ask questions of Atari's execs. What follows is a *very*
edited transcript of the questions and answers. The list of attendees
were compiled from /WHO lists taken during the CO and in the
post-formal chatter that followed; apologies to those I may have
forgotten. (This "post-war" CO is in an accompanying file, for those
who are interested.)

Comments to my e-mailboxes, save your flames...

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Okay, before we start, I'll apologize for the problems. I think Delphi...
	has a software bug.

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	I'd like to start by welcoming everyone here tonight. Special thanks
	to Sam Tramiel and Bob Brodie of Atari for taking time out of their
	very busy schedule to answer some questions for us here. Finally, I'd
     like...

ATARIPOWER7>
	.... let's <attempt> to be patient and virtueous..... :):):)

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	to welcome any of the Internet crowd for coming by Delphi this evening.
	I hope you like the system and will join us again.
	
	As an introduction, you all know that Atari announced the Jaguar last
	Wednesday in a press event at its Sunnyvale offices. Before the event,
     there was skepticism, and since there has been lots of speculation. Atari
     has thrown the gauntlet at 3DO, and tonight Sam and Bob will be sharing
     with you what makes this product so exciting.
	
	Finally, the Jaguar has sparked a flurry of heated debate. With that in
	mind, I'll set the law right now: NO SHENANAGANS (whatever they are) WILL
	BE TOLERATED! We're doing this conference as an effort to spread vital
	game information to the public, and disruptions make that impossible.
	This is a formal conference, and if you don't know the rules for how a
	formal CO works, you are asked to exit the Conference area (/EX twice)
     and re-read the banner that greets you upon entrance. Not abiding will
     put you in the "audience." Thanks in advance for your cooperation.
	
	Now, while those of you with questions will signal with a ? (remember,
     only one per customer), we'll start by asking Sam and/or Bob to open
     with a statement, then get to the conference...
	
	Bob and/or Sam? Comment to start?

ATARICORP>
	Good evening everyone.  On behalf of Atari Corporation, I'd like to
	thank you all for attending tonight's conference.  We appreciate the
	opportunity to meet here with you, especially with our good friend
	Andy Eddy!  Andy has been a long time supporter of Atari Corp., even
	preceding his involvement here in the World of Games Forum on Delphi,
	and we're thankful for his long-term support of our company.
	
	Tonight, we are here to talk to you about the Atari Jaguar, our
	exciting new 64 bit interactive multimedia entertainment system.  For
	those of you that haven't seen the specs on the Jaguar yet, here they
	are:
	
	
	o   64-bit RISC-based multiprocessing architecture.
	
	o   A very high speed 106.4 Mbyte/sec 64-bit Data path.
	
	o   27 MIPs Graphic Processor with 4K bytes of zero wait-state
	internal SRAM that is closely coupled with the Blitter that
	can perform a full range of graphics effects (including
	shading and rotations) at high speed yet is programmable for
	maximum flexibility.
	
	o   A programmable Object Processor that can act as a variety of
	different video architectures, such as an advanced sprite
	engine, pixel-mapped based systems, character mapped based
	systems and many others.
	
	o   27 MIPs Digital Signal Processor with 8K bytes of zero
	wait-state internal SRAM for CD quality sound and full stereo
	capabilities.
	
	o   A Blitter that can perform a full range of logical operations
	at high speed with hardware support for Z-buffering and
	Gouraud shading.
	
	o   MC68000 CPU clocked at 13.3 MHz as a general purpose control
	processor.
	
	o   Lifelike quality 32-bit color on NTSC or PAL television
	screens, yielding greater than 16 million colors.
	
	o   ROM Cartridge capacity to 48 Megabits of compressed or
	uncompressed code. When compressed, equivalent to almost 400
	Megabits.
	
	o   16 Megabits of fast page-mode DRAM.
	
	o   An optional double speed CD-ROM drive.
	
	o   ComLynx I/O for networked multiconsole games.
	
	o   Two (expandable to literally dozens) enhanced Controller
	Ports, supporting digital and analog interfaces, as well as
	keyboards, lightguns and mice.
	
	o   High performance, ergonomically designed, Controller with
	Joypad, 3 firebuttons, Pause, Option, and 12-key keypad with
	game-specific overlays.
	
	o   High speed synchronous serial port for connection to modems,
	cable TV networks and other high performance networks.
	
	With this Fall's introduction of the Atari Jaguar, the ultimate video
	game system and the nation's first 64-bit interactive multimedia
	entertainment system, comes a plethora of both new and familiar game
	titles. While third party developers and publishers are actively
	designing software for the system, Atari programmers overseas and
	domestically have been developing and fine-tuning several titles for
	the Jaguar for release this year.
	
	The dramatic use of 3D rendering and 24-bit graphics is most
	prevalent in games seen on the Jaguar system. Scanned and digitized
	character images, as well as detailed texture mapping, lighting and
	shadowing effects and unrestricted motion and speed all contribute to
	the next level of results.
	
	Some of the upcoming game titles include:
	
	Crescent Galaxy - Lifelike three dimensionally rendered and shadowed
	planetary objects and lifeforms prevail in this multi-leveled side
	shooter. You are the young Corporal Trevor McFur of the Circle Reserve
	Core. Returning from a deep space reconnaissance mission, you and your
	shipmate intercept a long-range transmission telling you that you are
	the only hope in saving the galaxy against a ruthless creature. The
	game is visually stunning with full textured 3D renderings of
	creatures and planets with nine levels reflecting five different
	worlds. Enemies and allies include: Pop-up Poppies which explode when
	they sense an enemy nearby; Geysers which can spurt forth abrupt
	blasts of nuclear steam erupting from the Planets core; and bothersome
	creatures such as Skeletal Vultures, Scorpions and Flying Dinos and
	dozens more.
	
	Cybermorph - Surreal landscapes colored in both muted and bright
	tones are the background for this One-Man Rescue Probe sent into an
	interplanetary battlefield to rescue stranded survivors of a dying
	war. The Cybermorph is an adaptable, flexible machine with an outer
	skin programmed to react to its environment. If accelerating, it grows
	streamlined to reduce resistance; when banking, its wings extend to
	give maximum turn; when slowing up, the rear of the craft morphs into
	a cowl to bring the speed down quickly and smoothly. The probe flies
	in a full three dimensional world environment. The object is to fly
	over the surface of each world in a low-altitude, high speed craft
	saving helpless survivors and avoiding surface and air attack and
	alien infestation. You defend yourself by shooting anything that moves
	and avoid being hit yourself or colliding into tall landscape
	features. A holographic face speaks to you giving you information.
	Following lifeline sensors, you race toward the cries for help,
	saving survivors from all 50 moons to complete the mission.
	
	Raiden - As the ultimate arcade game conversion, the Jaguar version
	is considered the ideal soundalike and lookalike Raiden game. As a
	vertical scroller, you control aircraft flying over enemy territory,
	shooting militaristic tanks and aircraft, avoiding enemy gun fire and
	hidden missiles. This full-featured game makes use of the graphic
	capabilities with complex parallax scrolling and realistic and
	engaging audio quality. This was essentially developed as a yardstick
	for performance, color and sprite comparisons to showcase the Jaguar's
	capabilities. Speed and motion are exceptional with no slow down when
	mass objects are present on the screen. No other system comes close to
	accurately converting this arcade game to a home console.
	
	Evolution-Dino Dudes - Familiar to consumers as Dinolympics? on the
	Lynx or as Humans? on the PC, this title is an Atari-owned property
	which, seen on the Jaguar, utilizes all the graphics and colors Jaguar
	can represent. Vivid colors and creative use of animation facilities
	enhance the overall look of the game, but the 80 levels of play make
	this challenging as well. As a platform puzzle game, cavemen
	characters are taught to survive, by avoiding man-eating dinosaurs,
	discovering the spear, making fire and physically running, jumping and
	climbing their way up the evolutionary ladder.
	
	Club Drive - The most exciting vacation park in the 21st century is
	the theme for this pulse quickening excursion. At this fantasy driving
	resort, all vehicles are indestructible, and visitors can challenge
	their skills and courage by driving some of the most treacherous
	terrain and returning completely unscathed. Different levels are
	represented by a futuristic city, an old western town, a present day
	world and even a toy car world where you can drive in and around your
	furniture at breakneck speeds as if you were inside a toy racing car.
	This true 3D polygon environment is completely new to the gaming
	world.
	
	Checkered Flag II - Jaguar Formula One Racing hits its peak with this
	version using real-time 3D generated action, akin to arcade quality
	racing games. Cars, buildings and roads are rendered in true 3D, with
	options to customize your car. The game features 100% true sound
	effects; crashes are realistic in both sound and imagery, with parts
	flying and tires screeching. Racing speed is markedly intensified.
	
	Tiny Toon Adventures - Based on the popular Warner Bros. characters,
	this platform game utilizes the vibrant colors and graphics to the
	utmost. The storyline follows Buster Bunny, Babs Bunny and Plucky Duck
	as they embark on a rescue mission to save the planet Aurica. Bad boy
	Montana Max has a new toy: an Acme TiToonium-Gold Converter. The only
	place to get TiToonium is on the planet Aurica. The removal of
	TiToonium is causing grave ecological damage to Aurica. Armed with
	Acme Crazy Net, our heroes try to shut down the Acme TiToonium-Gold
	Converter. The object is to navigate through each level, locate the
	TiToonium Extract heroes can be selected to climb, jump
	and run through each level so in the end, the planet can be saved.
	
	Alien vs. Predator - Based on two 20th Century Fox feature film
	blockbusters, what would happen if the Alien, the Predator and a
	colonial Marine Corporal were put together? Who would win? You select
	who you will portray and the qualities each possesses is incorporated
	into your strategy. For instance, if you were the Alien, you could
	climb walls; as the Predator, your night vision is superior and as the
	Marine Corporal, you may be able to outwit the other two with your
	computer skills. Placed in realistic texture mapped corridors, your
	movement is put in real-time action. Camera speeds race as you're
	being chased down hallways with a high frame rate. Exceptional colors
	and shadow effects put you right into the action.
	
	Kasumi Ninja - The game is set on the small island of Kasumi in the
	West Pacific rim. The Kasumi Ninja are the world's finest Ninja
	warriors and a mist of invisibility from the Ninja Gods hides Kasumi
	from the world. Kasumi is undetectable, even by radar. The Gods have
	decided to intervene when Gyaku, a strong warrior, kills his family
	and the Gods must find a new strong warrior to battle him. But first,
	this new young Ninja must learn new skills and fight with nine other
	persona, each with unique martial arts abilities and special moves.
	The game incorporates superior graphics and animation with realistic
	landscapes and backgrounds. Ninja warriors utilize 91 different
	martial arts movements, with all the sound effects and audio
	consistent with this type of fighting.
	
	Tempest 2000 - This title is familiar to gamers as the favorite
	arcade classic using vector graphics, polygons and rapid fire. Here,
	the Jaguar version incorporates a starfield in the background instead
	of just a black background. CD quality stereo enhances this game
	tenfold as this fast-paced energetic game unfolds. Manipulative
	abilities have been modernized and updated with new features that
	include spins and twists not seen in the 80's, as well as an updated
	version to the year 2000 which takes full advantage of the Jaguar's 3D
	graphic polygon capabilities.
	
	We're very pleased with the reception that the Atari Jaguar has been
	getting from the media, especially the gaming publications!  We
	recently had a media day, where we showed off the Jaguar and it's
	spectacular effects to a standing room audience.  The reception was
	overwhelming, and to say the least, we're gratified!!
	
	Our plans for the rollout of the Jaguar are for a New York and San
	Francisco release in October, with the rest of the US to follow in
	1994.  From the US, we'll be expanding into Europe, with London,
	Paris, and Frankfurt as the major target cities.
	
	With that, I thank you for your attention, and we're now happy to
	take any questions that our audience might have, Andy!

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Whew, nice to have *someone* prepared (hehe). Okay, first question..
	honor go to AEOMAG.

ATARICORP>
	Sorry for some of the formatting...
	ga, Tim

AEO_MAG:Tim@AEO>
	OK, can you give a benchmark (maybe aska programmer?) on how fast the
     polygons are? Texturemapped and flat shaded.?
	ga

ATARICORP>
	Tim, this is a bit more technical than I had expected, and I don't want
     to hazard a guess. I'll get back to you on that, hopefully later on
     tonight.	Sorry. ga

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Follow up, Tim?

AEO_MAG:Tim@AEO>
	no, that was my question.
	thanks.

ATARICORP>
	Tim, please be sure to send me email on who the people that are
     interested in VR are, we'll be happy to talk to them.

AEO_MAG:Tim@AEO>
	okeydokey.

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Okay, on to PHUNKZIP.

PHUNKZIP>
	the Jag may have a 64 bit Graphics processor, but isn't it really 16 bit
	machine because of the 68000 CPU?

ATARICORP>
	Tim, we can render 50 million goroud shaded pixels a second.  Hope that
	benchmark helps.

AEO_MAG:Tim@AEO>
	yes it does.

ATARICORP>
	No, the 68000 is a co processor.  Anation to the 16 bit ISA bus that you
      still get in 32 bit PCs. ga

PHUNKZIP>
	so what chip is the CPU of the Jag?

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Side comment: Isn't it also true that a processor in the Jaguar can be
     moved... from its "main" usage (like the graphics processor) to another 
     task if you chose to?

ATARICORP>
	The Jaguar CPU is a 64 bit custom graphics chip.
	ga

PHUNKZIP>
	last question from me: how can a graphics chip be the CPU?

ATARICORP>
	The 64 bit custom graphics chip is a good general purpose RISC unit,
     but it has been specifically optimized for 3D graphics work. ga

PHUNKZIP>
	ok thanks

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Okay, thanks, Dave. Josh, you're up.

VGJOSHO:Josho>
	Thanks, Andy!  Guys, I'm one of those that felt a bit "burned" by the...
	promises of third-party LYNX support, that basically never materialized.
	so I'd like to know which 3rd-party publishers have definitely been...
	developing for the Jaguar.  GA.

ATARICORP>
	We at Atari made no promises of 3rd party publishers for the Lynx. And we
	are working very hard to attract 3rd party publishers to Jaguar.  We will
	make our first formal announcements as to who has signed up in September.
	ga

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Follow-up, Josh?

VGJOSHO:Josho>
	Ah. Okee-dokee. :-(  Yes, one follow-up...
	As you said, you're planning a test market release in October in NY and
     SF... and I'm wondering when in 1994 you're planning the national
     rollout.  GA.

ATARICORP>
	The NY and SF markets will be shipped product in November and the rest of
	the national rollout will occur in the first quarter of '94
	ga

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Okay, thanks. RJUNG, you are up. GA

VGJOSHO:Josho>
	Hmmmm...OK, thanks!  Andy, back to you!

RJUNG>
	Hi, guys. Two questions, sorry if this is against protocol. (1) What game
	comes with the Jaguar? (2) How does the Lynx/Jag/ComLynx connection work?
	Are you talkingh about Lynx and Jag versions of a title, a Lynx adaptor,
	But there are no gasmes planned to be on both the Lynx and Jaguar
	platforms?

ATARICORP>
	We have not decided which game will be packed out.  It will be a surprise.
	:)  The ComLynx connection is a not a Lynx compatible adapter. The Jaguar
	will not play Lynx titles.  What the ComLynx port will allow, is for
	software to be developed to allow Lynxes to be part of a Jaguar game as
	controllers.
	ga

RJUNG>
	All right. Thanks. GA.

ATARICORP>
	We're not sure what you mean, but we do plan to have some of the same
	titles on both platforms.

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Okay, WUNDERLEYS is up. Go ahead with your question.

WUNDERLEYS>
	Ok, first off, what is the CD tht you were talking about?  Is it a CD-ROM
	or something?

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	(If you already signaled with a ?, please don't send another one.
	It's confusing. Thanks.)

WUNDERLEYS>
	Ok, and for my final question....  Will you have Fighting games?

ATARICORP>
	We are planning a CD peripheral to be introduced during the 1st half of
	1994.  It can play CD audio, CD+Graphics, and of course, Jaguar CD
     software. It's a high performance double speed drive, and will allow for
     full motion video in the Jaguar software.

WUNDERLEYS>
	Will you have fighting games?  What basis of games are you going to stick
	to releasing?
	ga

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Side question: How much will the MPEG 2 option cost?

ATARICORP>
	by using compression techniques called "Cine Pak".
	ga

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Bob/Sam, did you get the question about fighting games?

ATARICORP>
	Next?

WUNDERLEYS>
	Ok, thanx!  I'm finished! GA

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Sorry, there was a question about fighting games. I thought that was..
	still being answered.

ATARICORP>
	Of course, we will have a fighting game of all sorts.  Man against man,
     man against animal, animal against animal, Aliens against Predators, just
     like	we said in our opening remarks. <grin>  We are planning on having
     all types of games, and hope that 3rd party publishers will add a long
     list of titles.

	Andy, we are not annoucing prices at present. ga

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	(hehe) Okay, ARNOLDB. Fire away.

ARNOLDB:Arnie!>
	What language is native game code writen in?

ATARICORP>
	Assembly
	ga

ARNOLDB:Arnie!>
	Does the console have hardware scaling and rotating of individual
     sprites?

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	That was easy enough. Follow-up?

ATARICORP>
	Yes, and lots more besides.
	ga

ARNOLDB:Arnie!>
	how many megabits will the average game be

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Again, easy. DAVHEBEL, you are on.

ARNOLDB:Arnie!>
	and what phisical size are they?

DAVHEBEL>
	Have you considered contacting Beyond Games about porting Battle wheels
	from the Lynx to the jag ?

ARNOLDB:Arnie!>
	asembly as in 68000 chip or that graphics chip?

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Let's move on to Dave's question so that everyone else has a chance.
     Thanks. (We still have about 20 people with questions in line.)

ATARICORP>
	You cannot compare the megabit size of Jaguar carts to Sega Gensis, and
	SNES.  As Jaguar can compress data much more efficently and decompress on
	the flyal thanks
	to Sam Tramiel and Bob Brodie of Atari for taking time out of their

ATARICORP>
	True Color graphics and CD quality stereo sound take up a lot of data. 
	Regarding Beyond Games, of course we are talking to them.  And as I said
	earlier, we'll announce publishers in mid September.
	ga

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	(oops)

DAVHEBEL>
	thanks ga

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Follow-up, Dave?

ATARICORP>
	Arnie: ALL the processors are programmed in Assembly.

DAVHEBEL>
	no thanks!

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Okay, Gene5320 is up. Go ahead with your question.

GENE5320>
	Followup on the 3rd party question.  3rd partys do make the machine,
	look at what Street Fighter II did for SNES.   My question, will
	Atari put the Jaguar on "Tour" (like malls) to show it off and allow
	hands on with it?  ga
	oops..  redo?

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Good question.

ATARICORP>
	We are planning heavy duty marketing support, and will have point of
	purchase demostration units available at stores.  At present, we don't
     plan	"a tour", but might in the future.	ga

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Follow up, Gene?

GENE5320>
	all done

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Okay, JONSEI is in the spotlight.

JONSEI>
	Basically same as josho above: How many 3P's and who. Do you anticipate
     3P support at launch? Are development systems available.?  ga

ATARICORP>
	We will have 3rd party publishers developing software at launch. As a
	matter of fact, they are working on software as we speak.  They will not
     be shipping until Q-1. And yes, development systems are of course
     available. ga

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Okay, follow-up, JONSEI?

JONSEI>
	no. GA.

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Okay, let's see if TELENUT is here...
	Nope, on to ATARIPOWER7.

ATARIPOWER7>
	Why the timdity in getting the product out, what with the resources IBM
	has, surely we could have things in full blast already even!  Bestest and
	mostest is great, add fastest, and!!!!
	GA
	followed by another !?  <3 DOn't, ATARI DOES! :):):).... >
	Sorry, I was almost finished retyping into my text editor... :)

ATARICORP>
	We are limited by the amount of custom chips we can get this year.  In
     1994 we should not have these limitations.
	ga

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Great, follow up, ATARIPOWER7?

ATARIPOWER7>
	I'll wait in line for the next time....

ATARICORP>
	IBM really does have tremendous manufacturing power. And we really do
     agree that 3DO, don't, and Jaguar Does!

ATARIPOWER7>
	Fair is fair!

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	All right... SAM_RAPP. You are up.

SAM_RAPP:Sam 030>
	Hi Guys!  Thanks for being here!  Thanks for all the wonderful toys!

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	(Thanks, ATARIPOWER7)

SAM_RAPP:Sam 030>
	I hear that there are several development systems for the Jaguar,
	such as TT, PC, and a stand alone system.  Could you briefly
	describe the development environment and list the features of each
	system?
	GA

ATARICORP>
	This question is very complicated, but basically we have a TT development
	environment, and a PC development environment.  You can use any machine
     you want for art development.  Of course, you should use Atari's for
     music work.

SAM_RAPP:Sam 030>
	One more thing...  Will you mailorder this year for us Die hards?

ATARICORP>
	All we have time for is three more questions, sorry.

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Okay, let's move to EELIAS.

EELIAS:Eric>
	Will the Jaguar be modem ready or cable ready?

ATARICORP>
	We do not have a formal reply to this, but we will consider the mail
     order option.

EELIAS:Eric>
	ga

ATARICORP>
	Again, if you are talking about the new, or yet to be available OR
     clearly define {interactive networks}, we do think that Jaguar can
     act as a set top in this environment. GA

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	We'll skip follow-ups so we can get as many people in as possible.
     Sorry.

EELIAS:Eric>
	Thanks. ga

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	RDIMICK... you are on.

RDIMICK>
	Will you be bringing any of the Atari coin ops to the jaguar ? - And
     can you please arrange for some of the initial Jaguars to be sold here on
     Delphi - there has to be a way!!!! please

S:Andy>
	Okay, EFLY. Go ahead with your question.

EFLY:Fly>
	Could you run the preliminary information again.  I was late.
	Perhaps on the way out.

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	It will be in the transcript. I'll have it up in a day or so.
     Another question?

ATARICORP>
	We'll have a transcript for the library later.

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	(I'll save Bob and Sam from repeating all that.)

EFLY:Fly>
	no thanks.
	ga

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Okay, Geoff. You can go.

GAIARES>
	Go on to the next person while I get my question ready.
	:)

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	I think they are about out of time. How much more, Bob/Sam?

ATARICORP>
	One more, Andy.

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Okay, if Geoff isn't quite ready, Telenut is back and hopefully can.

TELENUT>
	I'm ready.

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	GA, TELENUT.

GAIARES>
	As a person who was disappointed in the way the lynx turned out to be a
	pretende the Jag to show us that it is a contender?

GAIARES>
	Oops. GA Dave.

TELENUT>
	How do you see the Jaguar as bieng supiror to the 3DO.
As far as overall quality.

ATARICORP>
	We feel that the power of the Jaguar will allow for a quantum leap in
	software experiences.  And we will back this with serious marketing
     dollars. 	The Lynx is not dead, and we will advertise it in NY and San
     Francisco along with Jaguar.  There will be 12 new Lynx titles delivered
     this year.

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Trip Hawkins referred to the Jaguar as the "Betamax" to 3DO's "VHS."
	Any comment?

TELENUT>
	Do you think you can compete with the bulk of software for the 3DO?
	(sorry, that was my follow-up)

ATARICORP>
	Andy, look at the prices, the 3DO is not priced to be a consumer product
     at well over $500. 3DO is simply overpriced.

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Understand. Unless Bob and Sam can take anymore questions, I'll put a
     close...	to the formal part of the CO. Closing comments, Bob and Sam?
	And, again, sorry for the glitches that delayed the start.

ATARICORP>
	Thank you all for attending.  On behalf of Atari, we're very grateful for
	your interest in the Jaguar.  We'll be seeing you in the message bases
     here on Delphi.  Please feel to send e-mail to BOBBRO here on Delphi, my
     normal address. Goodnight!

BRYEDEWAARD:Bryan>
	Kick some butt guys! :)

EELIAS:Eric>
	nite!

VIDGAMES:Andy>
	Okay, the transcript will be up in short order, I hope. Thanks one and...
	all for attending. E-mail to VIDGAMES with comments on the CO and future
     CO... guests.

PROGRAMS INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE

        The driver for ADPro2.x (reviewed by Esa Haapaniemi) and the
Scan_to_disk version (reviewed by Steve Harvey) of the scanner software.


REVIEW OF THE ADPRO DRIVER

        I asked for ASDG support of this scanner almost 2 years ago.  At the
time, they promised it would appear quickly.  First they said it was on a
development list, then in beta-testing, then they needed to finish the
Morph+ software first, then they were busy with the Morph+ demand (but it
was supposedly already written?) and was again under beta-testing.  Finally,
a local professional Amiga equipment dealer had it on his lists, and we
ordered it immediately.  At the same time, we bought a new version of ADPro
(2.3) because the dealer couldn't give any upgrade information for version
2.1.

        Installation was easily done with the standard Commodore Installer
program.  After connecting the scanner (always remember to power off all
equipment when making connections!) we could immediately try the program.

        The ADPro driver needs ADPro running first.  You must then choose
the HP-SCAN loader; and after the LOAD command, the driver opens the same
screen as the standalone version.  There is a scan area on the left, scaled
in inches, which may be toggled with a gadget to a metric scale.  The
scanner bed is viewed from below, so every object on the scanner is mirrored
from right to left.  On the right side of the screen, there is a typical ASDG
button box window with requesters for scaling and setting the scanning area
(inches/cm), toggle buttons for suggested resolutions, Metric/Imperial
measuring system, scan/abort/cancel and accept buttons.  There is also a
button to reset the scan size to full bed.  The numbers that represent the
needed space (RAM/disk) are doubled (see below).  Brightness may be set
with a slider or by typing a number directly.

        The scan area includes a square, mouse-controlled "rubber-band" that
allows selection of an area within the whole bed.  When the full bed button
is pressed, the square expands to cover the maximum scan size.  If the area
needed is smaller than the full bed, then this can be set with the
rubber-band before redoing the preview scan.

        When "Scan" is pressed, the scanner sends the chosen area to to the
computer quickly.  If the chosen area is smaller than the full bed, the area
is expanded so that the height or width almost fills the screen.  The area
can then be set more accurately, and you can continue with zooming or
accepting the area.

        If the ABORT or CANCEL buttons are pressed, the driver returns back
to ADPro.  Pressing "Accept" changes the right box to Final Scan, and the
rubber-band is locked, but you can still go back to Preview Scan if needed.

        In Final Scan, the resolution toggles stepwise between 50, 75, 100,
150, 200, 300, 400, 600 and 800 (wow!) DPI and back.  If too high a
resolution is chosen, the required memory meter numbers change from light
gray to black.  This is a little misleading, as the exact size of the file
is only half of the numbers presented.  This is done because ADPro needs
twice the amount of memory to keep both original and edited graphics in
memory at the same time.  So if this meter shows that you need 6 MB of
memory, the final image will only be 3M when stored on disk as a 24bit IFF
file.  Of course, the sizes for 24-bit, 8-bit, greyscale and 2-bit are also
displayed.

        In Final Scan, there are also sliders for contrast and brightness, a
toggle button for full colour/gray_scale/black & white scanning, and for
filtering and gamma correction.  I did not have much use for them and so I
can not say much about them.  The ABORT, CANCEL and ACCEPT buttons work like
those in the Preview Scan screen.  Pressing 'Accept' brings back the ADPro
screen again, and the progress of the scanning is shown with a wiper like
meter.

        The final scanning is really fast, and the 800 DPI gives good
results.  I did try to scan slides, but that requires a more powerful light
behind the slide, as well as shutting down the scanner's own light.  Also,
3D objects like pens, feathers, and clothing were scannable and the pictures
usable for graphics.  With 800 DPI, even the best art books seemed to have
pictures made of spots and not painted directly...

        The scanned image was immediately usable in ADPro, and the results
could be changed quite easily.  If contrast or darkness was not correct, it
could be corrected with ADPro or by scanning again (scanning is sometimes
faster).  Our lack of 24-bit graphics is a limitation, but maybe we can
change the software and scanner over to a A4000/40 soon.  Also as our A3000
is connected to ethernet, the output of 24-bit graphics to colour Postscript
will be really easy.


REVIEW OF THE SCAN_TO_DISK VERSION

        The standalone version is very similar to the ADPro driver.  The
scanning screen and controls are identical.  The only difference is that
after you press the ACCEPT gadget on the Final Scan screen, a file requester
appears asking for the filename and directory you want the image saved in.
Images are only saved in 24IFF format, so ideally you need a conversion
program.  I use HamLab+ which is a shareware product written by Ed Hanway,
jeh@raster.kodak.com.  (If anyones interested I might be persuaded to produce
a review of that too.)  The software uses a halfbrite screen mode to display
a greyscale representation of the image you are scanning, but on AGA
machines this will be an 8bit screen, which should help you set brightness
more accurately, I haven't received my A4000/030 and so have been unable to
try this... yet.

        The two buttons for filtering and gamma correction contain several
options.  The Gamma Correction can be None or NTSC, and the Filtering can be
None, 4-Pixel, 2-Pixel or Auto.  When Gamma Correction is set to NTSC, the
scan is processed to compensate for the colour biasing on most monitors.  The
Filtering button decides the amount of smoothing that is used when the scan
is scaled down.  The best settings for these seem to be NTSC Gamma
Correction and Auto Filtering.


DOCUMENTATION

        The disk comes with one manual that covers installation, how to use
the software, trouble shooting, etc.  It explains the functions of all the
gadgets, buttons, etc. in fairly good detail and explains all you need to
know to use the software.  I'm a beginner so I guess you don't need to be an
expert to understand the documentation.  All in all, it's an excellent
manual to compliment a very good bit of software.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

         I like the resolution and speed, but I dislike the ASDG way of
presenting memory needs.  Also I think the ASDG screens are not as
professional looking as the program really is.
                                                        - Esa Haapaniemi

        Overall I was very impressed with the package, but for the price I
expected no less.  The Scan_to_disk program has some irritating features.
For instance if you try to write to a file already open the program quits.
It would be much better if it just canceled the scan or gave a requester to
retry or abort.  This is a fairly important point, as without ADPro you need
to use another program to check the quality of the scan results in colour,
which means that the file might still be open when you next try scanning.
The quality of the images produced is excellent; I have a few on tap if any
one wants an example.  The only other problem I've had with quality is that
sometimes the scans can come out dark.  Of course, this can be cured with the
brightness/contrast control, but it's a shame that it's not automatic!
                                                        - Steve Harvey


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        We don't have any other scanners or other software for Amigas, but
the scanner was earlier used with Mac IIx and DeskScan software.  On the
Mac, the software seems more professional and the results are shown in colour
immediately.  Also DPI settings are unknown, and scanning resolution is set
by a percentage of best (600 DPI ??) results.  On the scanner bed window, the
area can be set by starting the rubber-band from the desired point without
the need to tune the preset area.  Still the Amiga version is faster, and it
can (memory/gigamem permitting) scan at higher resolutions, AND the files
are readily transferable to other formats like GIF, IFF/ILBM, TIFF (if the
saver is available).  And of course I HATE Macintosh "multitasking".  With
the Mac version, it takes several seconds to get changed from scanning to
file copying from the hard drive to HD/DD PC disks and back.
                                                        - Esa Haapaniemi

        The only other software I've used with the ScanJet is the free PC
driver that comes with the machine.  The ASDG driver produces much better
quality images and has a neater appearance.  The only thing it loses on is
that the PC software has a colour previewer.
                                                        - Steve Harvey


BUGS

        I don't know if this is a bug, but when I tried the ADPro driver the
first time, the scanner screen was somewhat too low to use the rubber-band
from the lowest corners.  Also, if the resolution toggle was changed to
something other than 50 DPI in preview mode or a preview scan was done
multiple times (zoomed), the scanner jumped multiple times on the same line,
and the driver just gave garbage out.  During this, error scanning was really
slow, and ABORT/CANCEL buttons were not functioning.  A couple of days later,
everything worked as it should, and no more quirks have happened to me.
Maybe there had been some disturbing programs in the background at that time?

        One "annoying" part is in the previewer.  When the selected area is
zoomed, the numbers on scaling requesters show the place and size of the
rubber-band, but they can not be expanded beyond the screen size.  It would
be much better to be able to set the position on multiple scans without
having to go back to a fullbed scan first.
                                                        - Esa Haapaniemi

        I didn't find any bugs in the Scan_to_disk version, but I did manage
to crash it by scanning to RAM:.  But I think that was my fault.

                                                        - Steve Harvey


VENDOR SUPPORT

        The electronic addresses listed initially are taken from the
technical support section in the back of the manual, so support and
assistance is available, although as yet I've not needed them.


WARRANTY

        Unsure.  I guess if you receive a faulty disk ASDG will replace it.


CONCLUSIONS

        In my opinion, the product is really welcome on the Amiga.  It's
faster than the Mac version and allows greater resolutions.  We could get the
scanner connected to the Amiga permanently, but there are some users who
need the Mac!
                                                        - Esa Haapaniemi

        The Scan_to_disk software is excellent, as one would expect from
ASDG.  My challenge to ASDG on the improvement front is to change the
preview scan to a colour one - even if it's supported only by AGA machines.
                                                        -Steve Harvey

/// A Call For Help!
    ----------------
    By Robert Niles


A while ago Amiga Report moved to the AmigaGuide format for a variety
of reasons. One of these reasons was so that we could include pictures
within the magazine in a easy, convenient way.

As most pictures are somewhat large, and we really don't want to start
creating an archive that is a burden to download, we would like to ask
someone to create a IFF brush viewing program that we may use here with
the Amiga Report magazine. We wouldn't be able to pay you for your time
and efforts, but we would give you the credit due, and we would be 
extremely grateful!

What we are looking for is this:

- A program that works well within the SHELL environment.
- Be able to take arguments (to load the picture brush file).
- Load and display 2 to 32 color IFF brushes.
- Create a border around the brush, automatically adjusting to the size
  of the brush.
- Have the window draggable and with a close gadget.
- Be as small as possible in size, using as little memory as possible.
- Be compatible with 1.3 systems on up to 3.0 systems.


Can this be done?? 

If so, this will enable us to load up picture files, and use only as much
memory as needed to display what needs to be shown.

Again, we wouldn't be able to pay you, but we do not ask for any rights 
over the program. We would just like to be able to include it within our
distribution archive as needed.

Send questions, comments to @{"Robert Glover or to Robert Niles" link P2-2}.

Thank you,

	Amiga Report

 - Sunnyvale, CA                JAGUAR TO DOMINATE ATARI'S DIRECTION
   -------------


    For ten years Atari Corp., the company that originated video games, has
 been hunting for a hit product.  Atari's computer offerings are hardly
 known and its hand-held Lynx game machine is selling slowly if at all. 

 Hopefully this fall, when Atari launches the Jaguar, a new high powered
 3-D game system it hopes will assist them to achieve total domination of
 Nintendo and Sega and all other video game systems now being developed. 
 "Sega, Nintendo. They are the competition we're going after," said Atari
 president Sam Tramiel.
  
      "We've never believed in launching incrementally better designs. You
 really have to make quantum leaps in performance,"  said Richard Miller,
 Atari vice president for technology, as the company showed off the Jaguar
 for the first time. 

      The Jaguar, controlled by buttons on a pad, connects to a tv set and
 runs games in 3-D (simulated). The device will (sometime in the future)
 play audio CDs and Kodak's photo CDs.  Initially, it will be intro'ed in
 New York and San Francisco for Christmas 1993, and nationwide, hopefully,
 in January.  

      Atari's Jaguar is targeting the mass consumer market & will sell for
 $200, an optional compact disc player will cost an additional $200.  An
 IBM Corp. factory in Charlotte, N.C., will build the machine, but IBM is
 not at all involved in the marketing of the Jaguar. 

      The Jaguar runs on 64-bit processors that are considerably faster and
 more powerful than the 16-bit systems sold by Sega Corp. and Nintendo Inc. 
 The Jaguar is twice as powerful as a number of 32-bit systems due later
 this year.  "These two chips took about three years to develop. They are a
 major breakthrough in technology," Miller said.

      "We plan to market and advertise Jaguar very, very heavily.  We
 realize that's been our weakness in the past,"  Sam Tramiel said. Atari
 will spend $3 million on marketing in this year's fourth quarter and $45
 million in 1994.  Atari made it known they have about $40 million cash on
 hand to launch Jaguar.  Atari is also considering going to the public for
 additional financing in 1994.

Our machine is a 386/33 with 20MB of memory, 1GB harddisk and upcoming
CD-ROM drive. The BBS software is a Norwegian origin MBBS running in
a DesqView window. 

We have over 6000 files online (no CD-ROM yet) containing titles for PC
and Amiga or both like GIF-pictures, music-modules and text-files. The
upload/download ratio is a very lousy 1:100.  (i.e. you upload a 20k file
and may download 2MB).

Messages are mainly written in Finnish, but English is widely used by
Swedish-speaking and international callers.

Download-access will be granted when asked. Also Amiga-areas are available
for those who will need them to avoid 'wars' between PC and Amiga users.
Access to sex pictures and stories are only for persons over 18 years
and given when requested.

Every user has an access to download filelist (LAHOFIL.ZIP), list of
Finnish 24-hour BBS's (BBSLIST.ZIP or BBSLIST.LHA) and every issue of
the Amiga Report Magazine (AR101.LHA-AR1??.LHA) on their first call.

The system is 4.5 years old and sponsored by the local telephone company,
Vaasan Laanin Puhelin Oy.
