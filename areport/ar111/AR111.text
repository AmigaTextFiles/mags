  ======================


The holiday weekend is upon us!  Everyone is gathering their inner tubes,
beach balls, boats, and so forth for a traditional party weekend.  Hopefully
more people will have the sense to know when to say when -- and not try to
drive after they've been drinking.  I'd like to hope that everybody that
reads our magazine each week will be alive and well to read it next week.

Speaking of next week, that will be our last weekly issue for a while.  I
have to keep mentioning it, so people don't start wondering when an issue
doesn't show up on June 11th.  The issue after next week's (June 4th) will
be June 18th.

This week, we welcome aboard a new staff member.  Robert Niles will assume
the position of Assistant Technical Editor, providing additional material
on technical and other subjects.  Mr. Niles runs a BBS in Yakima, Washington,
which will become an official Amiga Report distribution site.  This should
take some of the load off of Nova BBS, which has reported many new callers
and file requests from all over the globe.

That's it for this week.  Y'all have a great weekend!

   JUDGE BACKS NINTENDO OVER ATARI - In San Francisco, U.S. District 
Judge Fern Smith has backed Nintendo of America's contention that Atari 
Games infringed its patent for the security system for the Nintendo 
Entertainment System.

   Judge Smith granted Nintendo's motion for summary judgment, finding 
that Atari, a unit of Time Warner Inc., had infringed Nintendo's patent. 
Earlier, the judge issued an injunction against Atari after finding its 
representatives had misled officials at the U.S. Copyright Office to 
obtain Nintendo's copyrighted source code for its video-game cartridges.
 
   Atari Games vows to appeal a federal judge's ruling it infringed the 
patent for the security system in the Nintendo Entertainment System.

   Editor's Note: Atari Games is not connected with Atari Corp.


   MOTOROLA PLANS NEW CHIPS - Motorola Inc. plans to introduce three new 
microprocessors for portable computers that it says will provide a range 
of price and performance options demanded by low-power products such as 
video games, home entertainment systems and pocket organizers.

   Motorola Vice President Bob Growney, general manager of Motorola's 
Paging and Wireless Data Group, is quoted as saying, "Our goal of 
anytime, anywhere communications requires specialized technology."

   In addition, Vice President Jack Browne said Motorola expects its 
chips to supply at least a third of the personal communicator market, 
estimated by some industry analysts to reach $500 million by 1995.


   IBM UNVEILS OS/2 2.1 - IBM has unveiled OS/2 Version 2.1, an enhanced 
version of its 32-bit operating system for Intel-based personal 
computers.

   OS/2 2.1 supports Windows 3.1 applications, and features 32- bit 
graphics and longer battery life for mobile PC platforms. It also is 
more powerful and faster than version 2.0.

   OS/2 2.1 will be generally available June 14 at a list price of $249. 
A 90-day promotional offering of $99 for CD-ROM versions and $119 for 
diskette versions is available to users who order an upgrade through 
IBM's toll free number -- 1-800-3IBM-OS2 . In addition, OS/2 users who 
upgrade to 2.1 will receive a $30 rebate by filling out a coupon in the 
2.1 box and mailing it with the first page of their 2.0 manual.


   NEC OFFERS 64-BIT RISC CHIP - A new 64-bit microprocessor is being 
introduced by Japan's NEC Corp. which says the chip's low power 
consumption will bring desktop computing power to portable systems.

   Supposedly the VR4200, based on MIPS Technologies Inc.'s RISC 
(reduced instruction set computing) architecture, consumes less than 1.5 
watts, "making it suitable for portable PCs that run off batteries and 
have limited cooling systems."

   NEC says the chip will enable notebook users to run application 
programs under Windows NT, the new operating system Microsoft Corp. 
plans to put on general release later this year.


   STUDY TO EXAMINE LINK BETWEEN VIDEO GAMES AND EPILEPSY - British 
researchers have announced they will launch a study to examine whether 
there is a link between video games and epileptic seizures in children.

   The study, funded by the Department of Trade and Industry, aims to 
establish the degree of risk posed by the games to people who are 
photosensitive to flashing lights and to determine if the games trigger 
fits in children with no previous history of epilepsy.

   Photosensitivity, reacting chemically or electrically to light, is 
usually identified only when a person has a seizure.

   Researchers will estimate the number of new cases of photosensitive 
epilepsy in Britain per year and describe risk factors such as time of 
day, tiredness, duration of play, distance from screen and type of 
screen. They will also compare the effects of computers and video games 
on people with photosensitive epilepsy, as well as the effects of 
television, flashing lights or computer graphics.


   INTEL SETS PRICES AND SHIPS PENTIUM CHIP - Intel Corp. has set prices 
for its Pentium microprocessors of $965 each for the 66-MHz version and 
$878 each for the 60-MHz version in 1,000-unit quantities prompting 
several announcements from computer manufacturers about new models 
featuring the state-of-the-art chip.

   Intel is now shipping production versions of the chips and expects to 
ship hundreds of thousands of the Pentium microprocessors this year and 
cross the one million mark in 1994.

   Among those announcing new computers based on the Pentium was Compaq 
Computer Corp., whose chief of European operations, Andreas Barth, 
predicted the new chip will tap fresh markets for Compaq.

   Other companies introducing Pentium-based computers today include 
Unisys Corp., NCR Corp., AST Research Inc., Dell Computer Corp.


   ZIFF DISCONTINUES PC SOURCES - Magazine publisher Ziff-Davis Publish-
ing Co. says it will discontinue publication of PC Sources and change 
the format of its Corporate Computing, making it a monthly newsletter 
published by its subsidiary, The Cobb Group.
 

   CHIP MARKET TO GROW 20 PERCENT - The Semiconductor Industry Associa-
tion predicts the worldwide chip industry will grow 20% this year to 
$71.9 billion by the end of the year.

   SIA is quoted as projecting the growth being led by the North 
American market, which will see a 28.1% gain in 1993 shipments to $23.6 
billion.


   AT&T OFFERS NEW MODEM CHIPS - A new, high-speed modem chipset has 
been announced by AT&T Microelectronics.
 
   AT&T says the chips provide reliable data communications over the 
existing cellular phone network and make it easy for vendors to provide 
interfaces between modems and cellular phones.

   AT&T signed a patent license agreement with Spectrum Information 
Technologies Inc. last month under which AT&T V32Cell modem chipset 
customers "can design and sell modems based on the V32Cell chipset 
without concern about infringing Spectrum's patents," Reuters reports.

   AT&T Microelectronics is the only chipmaker able to provide modem 
chipsets covered under Spectrum patents.

TELECOM SOFTWARE FOR HEARING IMPAIRED DEBUTS

HOUSTON, TEXAS -- Futuresoft Engineering has announced that it is shipping
an enhanced version of it's DynaComm 3.1 Windows communications program
which features special on-screen visual clues for hearing impaired users.

Although it is obvious visually impaired computer users face formidable
obstacles when it comes to using telecommunications software, it may not be as
obvious to most people that hearing impaired users will also require special
software to make bulletin board and other services easy to use.

The latest release of DynaComm provides special animated Windows icons that
activate during operation to display the same information normally provided by
audio signals from the user's modem.

Since most feedback for dial tone acquisition and exchange of protocol settings
are signaled by sounds, the lack of this feedback for hearing impaired users
can make telecommunications tasks quite difficult.

Although external modems do provide signal lights or a combination of lights
and LCD text display to indicate modem status, this is not true for most
internal modems and in any case, the visual indicators supplement, but do not
replace the audio indicators.

Icons supplied by the new FutureSoft communications software include those
which indicate a busy signal, a broken connection, and other normally audible
signals.

These same icons are also highly useful for non hearing impaired workers who
are either situated remotely from the actual modem or can't hear the signals
for other environmental reasons such as being in a noisy location.

A free copy of the upgrade is available to hearing impaired users of registered
copies of DynaComm 3.1.

EPSON ANNOUNCES PC TUNED FOR NEXTSTEP

TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA -- Hard on the heels of the official announcement of
the Nextstep operating system for Intel-based personal computers, Epson has
announced the availability of the Progression NX. The company says that the
NX is the first in a line of PCs optimized to run Nextstep.

Nextstep is the operating system developed by Apple Computer co- founder Steve
Jobs at his new company Next for the futuristic, black, cube workstation
computer, also called Next.

However, five months ago Next announced it would stop producing the Next
computer and focus entirely on being a software company, moving the Nextstep
operating system to the Intel personal computer (PC) platform. The resulting
operating system is the Nextstep 486 and Next says it already has commitments
for 25,000 copies of the new operating system. Next says the Nextstep operating
system will run Windows and DOS applications as well.

The Progression NX offers an Intel 486DX2/66 processor with support for future
Intel Overdrive processors, including the new Pentium-class. It comes with 36
megabytes (MB) of random access memory (RAM) standard, expandable to 68 MB on
the motherboard board via single in-line memory modules (SIMMs) and offers
Epson's proprietary memory architecture, Virtualcache.

To meet the special video needs of the Nextstep operating system, the
Progression NX has 2 MB of video RAM standard, with random access memory
digital-to- analog conversion (RAMDAC) support for 1120 by 832 resolution.

To accommodate the sizeable portion of disk space the Nextstep operating system
and its applications consume, the Progression NX comes standard with a 525 MB
small computer systems interface (SCSI) hard disk drive, six industry standard
architecture (ISA) slots, five drive bays, a multimedia sound card, and a
Ethernet local area network (LAN) adapter.

Epson is also planning the Epson NX, a sister machine to the Progression NX,
but with the Nextstep operating system pre- loaded. The Progression NX is aimed
at independent software vendors (ISVs) and power users while the Epson NX is
aimed at the end user, Epson representatives said.

Planned for release this summer, the Epson NX will offer a 170 MB integrated
drive electronics (IDE) hard disk drive and 20 MB of RAM expandable to 68 MB,
four ISA slots, and three drive bays. It will also come standard with 2 MB of
video RAM with RAMDAC support for 1120 by 832 display resolution.

The Progression NX is currently available to Nextstep beta sites and
Next-authorized independent software vendors for $5,349. The Epson NX will have
an estimated selling price of less than $3,700, company representatives said.

Epson also announced the Progression 4 series aimed at the Microsoft Windows
user market. The Progression 4 PCs feature CHIPS & Technologies' Wingine local
bus graphics and the Epson's proprietary memory architecture designed to offer
faster Windows performance. Suggested retail prices for the Progression 4 line
start at $1,339.

APPLE TO BUILD PCI LOCAL BUS MACINTOSHES

ATLANTA, GEORGIA -- Apple Computer has aligned itself with the group of
vendors who announced support for the Peripheral Component Interconnect
(PCI) Local Bus standard in their future systems. The bottom line is
Apple's adoption of the PCI Local Bus will make its computers compatible
with the same peripherals IBM-compatible computers will use.

Originally introduced by Intel, the leader in central processing units (CPUs)
for the IBM-compatible personal computer (PC) market, the PCI standard is a
core architecture, offers data transfer capability between computer expansion
cards, and is aimed at multimedia.

The PCI Local Bus has been described by the PCI Special Interest Group (SIG) as
a high-performance local bus architecture designed to eliminate bottlenecks
between a computer's processor and its high band-width peripherals, such as
networking, video, and graphics.

Intel has announced PCI as an open standard and has offered free PCI licenses
to the PC manufacturing market in order to promote it. One PC vendor said Intel
didn't want PCI to become another Microchannel. Microchannel is IBM's
architecture standard for the PC bus which never gained wide acceptance.

The purpose of the PCI SIG is to work on the specification. Intel is a
permanent member of the steering committee of that group, but 150 other PC
companies are involved, including IBM. Apple's Vice President of its Desktop
Products Group, Eric Harslem, said the companies involved in the PCI SIG are
interested in leveraging off of each other's research and development
investments.

"Apple's participation in the PCI Steering Committee will ensure that PCI will
become the de facto industry standard local bus," said Mike Bailey, PCI
Steering Committee chairperson. "With Apple's support of PCI, we are gaining
momentum for a unified bus strategy that connects the PC industry by supporting
different CPUs, architectures, and platforms."

Apple's adoption of the open PCI standard will mean more choices at a lower
cost to future Macintosh users. The choice of cards for Apple's current Nubus
system architecture has been limited by the fact that manufacturers have been
forced to develop a separate product for the Nubus, Harslem said.

The adoption of PCI by Apple should mean that users can buy any card off the
shelf and it will work in a Macintosh, an IBM compatible system, and perhaps
even a workstation -- if workstation manufacturers also adopt the PCI standard,
according to Harslem.

"When the XT bus was introduced in 1986, Apple chose not adopt the standard
because we felt it was too limiting," Harslem said. "However, the adoption of
PCI is a good move for Apple."

Plans are to adopt the PCI architecture in second generation PowerPC-based
Macintosh computers. Apple this month showed the first prototype of the
PowerPC-based Macintosh, a CPU it announced with IBM and Motorola in October of
1991. "Power" is an acronym based on IBM's Performance Optimization with
Enhanced RISC (reduced instruction set computing) technology.

Harslem said that, just like the PC community's investment in its extended
industry standard architecture (EISA) will mean a slow move to PCI as a
standard, Apple has a large investment in the Nubus for the PowerPC-based
Macintosh. Notwithstanding, users can expect to see the first PCI Local Bus
Macintosh PowerPCs in the first half of 1994, Harslem added.

COMPUTER CITY NAMES THIRD EUROPEAN LOCATION

FORT WORTH, TEXAS -- Tandy Corporation division Computer City has
announced the location of its third SuperCenter in Europe.

The company said this week that the third European outlet would be in
South Stockholm, Sweden. The company already operates SuperCenter
stores in Stockholm and Copenhagen, Denmark.

The new SuperCenter will be located at Kings Corner, across from the
IDEA furniture store, and will occupy about 1,485 square meters when
it opens in the third quarter.

Computer City SuperCenters in Europe sell Apple, Commodore,
Compaq, Canon, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Victor personal computers and
peripherals, as well as a selection of software, telephones, fax
machines, copiers, and furniture. Computer City spokesperson Ron
Trumbla told Newsbytes the company employs an average of 60 people in
each of its US outlets.

In addition to its European outlets, the company operates 20
SuperCenters in the US, and says it will add 15 additional
superstores this year and 16 more each year over the next two years.
Computer City estimates sales will approach the $1 billion mark in
1994, the third full year of operation. Trumbla told Newsbytes the
next US Computer City SuperCenter, the 22nd, will open in the Fort
Lauderdale, Florida area this summer. The 25,000-square-foot facility
will be located in the Sawgrass Mills Shopping Center in Sunrise.
Another store is scheduled for opening in Santa Ana, California, also
this summer, and construction has begun on a store in the Seattle
area.

SPINNAKER REPORTS THIRD QUARTER LOSS, RENEWS TRADITIONAL FOCUS

CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS -- Spinnaker Software has announced a $19.03
million operating loss for the third quarter, along with plans to sell
its line of data access products, and focus more fully on personal
productivity software, its traditional strong suit.

About $14.05 million of the loss was due to a one-time charge
for purchased research and development relating to Spinnaker's
March 30 acquisition of Power Up, another top player in the
personal productivity segment, officials reported in the company's
latest financial statement.

The Power Up product line consists of a variety of personal
productivity tools for DOS, Windows, and the Mac, including
Calendar Creator Plus, FormWorx, Express Publisher, Labels
Unlimited, Quick Schedule Kit, Address Book Plus, and Name That
Disk.

Spinnaker's previously-established product lines include the PFS:
and Easy Working suites of DOS- and Windows-based software for
the small business and home office arena, in addition to Plus and
Personal Access data access software for corporate enterprise
use.

Spinnaker hasn't yet set an asking price for Plus and Personal
Access, said Dan Chmielewski, a company spokesperson, in
an interview with Newsbytes. "The client/server (data access)
software didn't work out very well for us, but we've been
consistently successful in the small business and home office
market," Chmielewski said.

Developers from Spinnaker and its new Power Up subsidiary are
now at work on several new applications, and these will be
announced as products this summer, he told Newsbytes.

Spinnaker's third quarter ended March 31. Also during the period,
the company's quarterly revenues dropped to $5.11 million, down
$2.37 million from $7.48 million for the same quarter the previous
year, according to the financial statement.

In the statement, C. David Seuss, president, cited two negative
impacts on revenue for the quarter:  a general slump in retail
sales throughout the US, together with price protection allowances
provided to dealers, distributors and direct customers to support
repricing in Spinnaker's PFS:Pretty Fantastic Savings promotion.

In Pretty Fantastic Savings, the prices of PFS branded products
have been reduced to below $50 from previous levels of about $80.
Spinnaker expects the lower pricing to generate incremental
revenue and profits in current retail outlets and to provide
entrance into new stores, but the timing of its introduction was
too late for significant third quarter benefits, said Seuss.

"Pretty Fantastic Savings is still going on, and it's been very
well received," Chmielewski commented. Spinnaker will launch more
promotions for the personal productivity products this quarter and
the next, he added.

Power Up brings important synergies, officials said.  Where
Spinnaker has emphasized retail distribution, Power Up has
concentrated on building direct catalog reach.

IBM, Apple, Compaq, Dell, NEC, ZDS, Acer, Fountain and Tandy
are all bundling Spinnaker or Power Up software with PCs.

For 1992, Spinnaker reported revenues of $28 million and Power Up
reported revenues of $34 million, a total that would put Spinnaker
in 17th place in the 1993 SoftLetter top 100 list of independent PC
software companies in the US.

Chmielewski told Newsbytes that Power Up is the number one
competitor in the PC calendar market. Spinnaker is the leader in
resume software, with a combined market share of 70 percent
from Easy Working Resume Kit and PFS:Resume and Job Search Pro,
he said. A Windows version of Resume and Job Search Pro is
slated to join the DOS edition in the marketplace soon.

Chmielewski corroborated previously published press reports that
some technologies from Power Up might be integrated into
Spinnaker products. But when asked to confirm that Calendar
Creator Plus might be incorporated into one of Spinnaker's
desktop publishing software, he declined to comment.

"We're looking at how (Spinnaker and Power Up) can best
complement each other over both the short- and long-term in
the next generation of products," he told Newsbytes.

BABYLON 5 ANNOUNCES 22 EPISODES

The Prime Time Entertainment Network has finalized plans to add a new series,
Babylon 5, to its schedule.  This move will expand its programming base by
fifty percent.

The series Babylon 5, based on the highly-rated telefilm of the same name,
has been given an order for 22 episodes set to debut on the PTEN schedule in
January, 1994.  The series follows on the success of the original telefilm,
which aired on PTEN in March 1993 and achieved a 10.3 GAA national rating,
out-rating the strong two-hour premiers of Kung Fu:  The Legend Continues
(10.2), The Untouchables (10.2), and Time Trax (8.4).

Babylon 5 will fill the Wednesday, 8:00 (PT) time period previously held by
Time Trax, which will now be scheduled in prime time on a second night.

NEW CD-ROM ANNOUNCED FOR THE AMIGA


                                NOTICE TO ALL!

Announcing development of the "Spectral Sensation" JPEG CD-ROM for the Amiga
and IBM platforms. Having already accumulated several megabytes of JPEG
digitized, rendered, and original art JPEG's, I've decided to produce a JPEG
CD-ROM for myself and other's to enjoy.

Along with the 24-bit JPEG pictures most of them will be rendered in Ham-8
plus an IBM format for quick viewing.  And of course there will be the usual
Graphics utilities, PD and Shareware Image Processing software, plus other
goodies.  If there is any room left over,  I will try to fit a few DCTV or HAM-
8 animations on the disc.

At this time I'm asking for artist contributions.  One thing I do believe in
is the intellectual property rights of artist's, so do not want to use
someone's work without their permission. So if you have some 24-bit IFF, 
JPEG,  or other format pictures,  rendered or original photography that you
are willing to contribute, please let me know via Genie Mail. If enough of
your pictures are used on the CD I will create a special directory for your
contributions,  plus send you a freebie CD just for thanks!  I've already
received permission from several artist's and hope to include your work for
the CD, so dust off the scanner, 3D rendering software, and paint programs!

Thanks for your Support!

MAINACTOR V1.0 AVAILABLE FOR FTP


TITLE

  MainActor

VERSION

  1.00

AUTHOR

  Markus Moenig
  markusm@tolkien.adsp.sub.org
  
DESCRIPTION

  MainActor is a modular animator package.

  It allows you to create, edit, and play animations of the provided
  animation formats.

  You can convert any format into any other, allowing you to
  convert for example a range of pictures into an animation format
  of your choice, or resave the frames of an animation to an
  picture format, or simply to convert different picture formats.
  
  The following modules are included in this release:
  
  Animation Loader                           Animation Saver
  ----------------                           ---------------
  IFF-Anim5                                  IFF-Anim5
  IFF-Anim7_16                               IFF-Anim7_16
  IFF-Anim7_32                               IFF-Anim7_32
  IFF-AnimBrush


  Picture Loader                             Picture Saver
  --------------                             -------------
  IFF                                        IFF
                                             ICON

  Features:-
  
  -Intelligent caching/tracking, MainActor can cache your animations and
   picture lists, if you have not enough memory it will directly access
   your data from any device. This makes it for example possible to
   create/edit/play a 400MB animation on your 2MB Amiga.

  -If you run OS 3.0 or higher, you will get an extra speed bonus on
   animations through the use of the new graphics routines.
   For OS2.0/2.1 users there are specific routines in the modules, which
   will give them the best playback speed possible on their system
   (and my knowledge :)).

  -Under OS 3.0 you will get the extra features of showing pictures or
   playing animations in a scrollable, resizable window on your MainActor
   or Workbench screen. The colors will be properly adjusted to your screen
   attributes.

  -The modules have play routines of their own, so it will be possible
   to redirect the input/output of special modules to graphic cards or other
   hardware.
   
  -The play routines support a timecode per frame option. A Sound Module
   (per frame) option will be there in one of the next releases.

  -MainActor has a totally user reconfigureable GUI. The settings of your
   sessions can be saved, this includes the size/position of windows
   as well as the status of the projects.

  -MainActor has an arexx port, nearly all functions can be accessed through
   it. You can for example scale or dither whole animations through
   the use of an image processor, scripts are included.

  -MainActor lets you setup and save nearly everything concerning the
   display mode for playing an animation or showing a picture.
   For example you can set the X/Y offsets, the display mode ID
   of your screen (view) and so on.

  -MainActor supports localization.

> ONLINE WEEKLY Amiga Report Online               People...  Are Talking!
  =================================



From the Amiga RT on GEnie
--------------------------


Ty Liotta (T.LIOTTA) details his Toaster 4000 experiences...

Welp Bob, and everyone else, I have gotten more of a chance to play with the
Toaster 4000.

The new version of the character generator is very nice. It is somewhat
similar to the old CG in apperance, but once you get into it, you discover
it is significantly different in terms of functionallity. Everything is now
mouse driven. You can use function keys if you like, but this is not needed.

NewTek includes a multitiude of new fonts in addition to the old ones.
The vast majority of these are of the scalable or postscript variety. When a
scalable font is selected, you can type in any point size between 10 to 400
scan lines and the font will be scaled to the proper dimensions. All of the
normal shadow and outline settings are mainly the same, but the color
requester has been moved to the program screen (you no longer have to look at
the preview monitor to set your color). The color requester is also a lot
faster, since it does not have to update the toaster's screen when you are
manipulating the sliders.

Moving your lines of text around is a breeze. Just click and drag to
move text anywhere on the screen. There are no pre-defined "lines" of text,
and therefore letters can be placed anywhere, even on top of each other.

Graphical elements can also be imported easily to enhance your CG creations.
These are really 24bit brushes from ToasterPaint, but they are treated just
like fonts. They are chosen from the font requester and can be dragged about
the screen. Graphics can be placed on top of, or below text and can even
have automatic drop shadows created, just like fonts.

My only gripe with the new CG lies in the area of moves. There are no new
moves for text whatsoever. We are still stuck with the typical scroll and
crawl moves from the previous software. Text can be fliped or turned by luma
keying it and using an effect (as before) but it looks lousy when you do this.
I really wish NewTek could have come up with some other option.

Anyway, I'll of course talk more in later messages. I'm sure that we'll all
be able to read in great detail about the Toaster 4000 in the next issue of
Video Toaster User, assuming it ever comes out. Also of interest, Commodore
is offering a new pricing program for the Amiga 4000. If you own an Amiga
2000 you can trade up to the A4000 and get a discount. You rip off the first
page of your A2000 manual, write your serial number on it, and bring it to
your local Amiga dealer. This will get you a price of about $2300 for the
68040 version of the A4000 (120MB hard drive, 6 megs ram). Supposedly if you
use this program, New Tek will also give you a discount on the purchase of a
Toaster 4000, but I do not know excatly what that will be, and they have not
annouced any specifics yet.

To get back to Bob's question... I do think the A2000 has reached it's
last days. Now that the A4000 can use the new and improved Toaster, there is
really no reason for the A2000 to stick around. Commodore has not officialy
stopped production of the A2000, but I am sure they soon will. The A2000 will
make a very good rendering engine for Lightwave (or other 3D software) because
it can run faster versions of the 68040 than the A4000, but this is probably
about it.

I am also planning on uploading some JPEGed images generated on the
Toaster 4000. Probably some pictures of a few effects in mid transition (I'll
run the output of the Toaster 4000 to our other toaster and do a grab) and
some examples of the new CG. I'll try to get them uploaded some time next
week.


                      ------------------------------


From the Amiga International echo on FidoNet
--------------------------------------------


James Street explains why the Mac ToasterLink is worthwhile...


To clear a few things up on the Mac... First off, I've seen asked several
times "How a Mac could contribute to a Video Toaster setup?" The answer is
simple, the Mac, with its true 32-bit graphics (no 256,000 color limit), and
software like Adobe Photoshop (vs. ADPro) and Electric Image and Stratavision
(vs. Lightwave/Imagine/and Caligari pro) and Fractal Design's Painter 2.0 (vs.
Toasterpaint/Deluxe Paint) could in software terms, outperform any Amiga. I
was a HARD Amiga fan, untill I finally saw the light of photoshop, it makes
ADPro look pretty shabby. The Mac is allready the platform of choice for many
3D artists, but I am indeed impressed with the feature list of Lightwave 2.0.
And no current paint program could match the finesse of Fractal's Painter, an 
absolutely wonderful program when coupled with a drawing tablet (digitizer).
So the Mac could be used VERY effectively as a front end for graphic
processing with the toaster doing the video work. I admit that Newteks's
ToasterLink is far from a complete product.

A 25Mhz 030 Mac is the LCIII (recently realeased), which is fully 32-bit, one
expansion slot, and ability to put up to 32 megs on the motherboard. It also
includes 16-bit graphics standard (over a 32-bit look-up table), real SCSI on
the motherboard (not IDE junk), and it is also a much more aesthetically
designed machine than a 4000/030, although the 4000 may offer more expansion.

(EDITOR's NOTE:  The opening sentence of the second paragraph was damaged, so
I had to best-guess the exact wording.  My apologies for any errors.)



                      ------------------------------



Joey McDonald asks about a super new display mode...


ANOTHER QUESTION HAS POPPED INTO THE EVER SO ACTIVE NOGGEN OF THE OFFICIAL
AMIGA IDIOT AND SELF PROCLAIMED LOON.... Joey McDonald (The only Amiga user
brave enough to ask the stupid questions)

                   --------- THE QUESTIONS BEGIN ----------

DYNA-HIRES is achieved by displaying a different set of 16 colors per scan
line on a hi-res screen, giving a simulated 4096 colors in hi-res.

Because the hardware is limited to 16 colors in hires, each scan line has the
16 color limit.  But because of ham, lowres doesn't have this limit, right?

WHAT ABOUT DYNA-LOWRES ????  Forcing the copper to display 4096 "DIFFERENT"
COLORS ON EACH SCAN LINE giving a simulated 198,400 colors ?????

or what about MEGA-HALFBRIGHT ?

64 "DIFFERENT" COLORS ON EACH SCAN LINE giving a simulated 24,160 colors ?????

THIS SOUNDS GREAT!

THERE HAS GOT TO BE A WAY TO GET MORE COLORS FROM A STOCK ECS AMIGA... AND I
THINK THIS IS THE WAY?!?

TAKE A LOOK AT A P.D. PROGRAM CALLED PHOTOCHROME3.0 for the Atari ST/STE. It
offers the following modes with software ONLY!

SPECTRUM 512 - 42/45 colors per scan line out of 512 (ST)
SPECTRUM 4096 - 42/45 colors per scan line out of 4096 (STE)
PCS-ST 48 - colors per scan line from 4096 (STE)
SUPER-HAM - all 4096 out of 4096 on an ST or STE
STE-PHOTOCHROME - 19200 colors out of 32768 on an STE

ALL OF THESE MODES WITH SOFTWARE! ON A STOCK ATARI NO LESS!  It even claims
it's superham mode is superior to the amiga's!

!!!! SOMETHING MUST BE DONE TO TOP THIS !!!!

ANY responses would be appreciated!

AS ALWAYS I END THIS MESSAGE WITH THE IMMORTAL WORDS:

AM I A GENIOUS OR A LOON?

(sooner or later I've got to win)

> Amiga Tip of the Week
  =====================
  By Robert Niles


A few weeks ago Micah wrote an article using the tilde charactor to exclude
files or directories within a LISTing or DIR search.  Well, I got to playing
with it a bit and thought that there should be a way to search through a hard
drive partition, or a large directory for a file or collection of files.  I
often forget where I put a file... even where I put the archive which does
much the same thing as what I'm going to explain here (I know put it in the
C: dir....but I already have *SO* much in there already <grin>).

Say you are looking for the collection of that wonderful Amiga Report
magazine... the archives are called AR101.LHA, AR102.LHA, and so on. You know
they are on the hard drive, but searching through each and every directory
would just take too long.  Even doing a "DIR ALL" would create a listing so
large that it would scroll past you on the screen so fast, you couldn't even
say, "Bob's your Uncle" before it pass by you, much less read it.  Of course,
holding down the right mouse button will help, but let's see if we can make it 
even easier.  Ok... you know the files are on DH0: somewhere, so all you have
to do is type:

LIST DH0:(#?/#?AR10#?) [FILES]

The result would be something like this:

Directory "bb1:text" on Friday 21-May-93
ar109.lha                  42368 ----rwed Sunday    16:58:57
ar103.lha                  28028 ----rwed 13-Apr-93 10:31:50
ar104.lha                  49447 ----rwed 13-Apr-93 10:22:48
ar105.lha                  55118 ----rwed 19-Apr-93 12:03:27
ar108.lha                  56832 ----rwed 08-May-93 21:25:40
ar106.lha                  73539 ----rwed 25-Apr-93 09:34:39
6 files - 610 blocks used

Now you know it is located in the directory called "text". You found it!
Now this assumes that the files you are looking for are on DH0: and only one
directory deep to go even deeper just add another "#?/" right after the left 
parenthesis. The "FILES" flag searches only files...just in case you have a
directory named something like what is in the search pattern (the search
pattern being "AR10") and you don't want the directories listed. You can
replace FILES with DIRS if you know you are looking for a directory instead
of a file.

If you want to get a print out of ths listing you could direct it to do so by
adding ">prt:" (or ">>prt:") right after the LIST command. Like this:

LIST >>PRT: DH0:(#?/#?AR10#?) FILES

Or you can even direct it to a text file. If one doesn't exist it will make it 
for you. Try this:

LIST >>SYS:Example.list DH0:(#?/#?AR10#?) FILES

Using >>SYS:Example.list will add this to a text file if it already exists.
Using only one ">" will rewrite over an existing "Examples.list" file, or
create a new one if it doesn't exist.

Well I hope this helps...if you want to see something more specific drop me a
note.

> GEnie's New Pricing  AR InfoFile
  ================================



                             GENIE ANNOUNCES NEW PRICING:
                        SIMPLER, MORE AFFORDABLE AND, AS ALWAYS,
                               THE BEST VALUE ONLINE



An Open Letter to GEnie Subscribers
From John Barber, General Manager of GEnie:

On July 1st, a new pricing structure goes into effect at GEnie. It's a big day
for us -- the result of months of planning, number-crunching, monitoring and
maneuvering around the competition.

And once again, we're looking forward to showing the online community that no
one offers a better value than GEnie.

We have to admit that over the last few months, it's been difficult to watch
the other major online companies, one after another, proclaim that their new
prices make them "the ultimate value."

But rest assured, we do not intend to give up our leadership position as the
best value online.

GEnie has always offered its subscribers the best combination of sophisticated
services, information, entertainment -- and affordability.

And we've done it once again.  Starting July 1st, GEnie will offer you the
lowest hourly connect time of all the major online services; combined with a
highly-competitive monthly subscription fee; and credit each month for up to
four hours online.

Effective July 1st, this is GEnie's new U.S. pricing structure:

- Our monthly subscription fee becomes $8.95 a month.
- Our standard hourly connect rate drops to $3.00 an hour.
- And every month, you'll get a credit for up to 4 hours of
  standard $3.00 connect time.

It's about that simple.  For our Canadian and international PDN customers, a
complete price chart is available as menu option #2 on this page.  It also
contains the fine print regarding prime time, baud rates, etc., so it's worth
taking some time to look over.


                               SIMPLY BETTER

You might notice one more important benefit to our plan.

We kept it simple.  It's easy to understand, easy to live with. For starters,
we've simplified the pricing.  All the services formerly in GEnie*Basic and in
GEnie Value are now treated equally, and available at the same low price --
$3.00 an hour in non-prime time.

Multi-player games, downloading, computing bulletin boards, real-time
conferences -- they're all just $3.00 an hour. (Half what you've been paying
for GEnie Value services!)

GEnie*Basic services, yes, they're now included in the $3/hour group, too.  GE
Mail -- it's $3.00 an hour, with no limit to the number of messages.  Internet
Mail is now $3 an hour, with no registration fee.  And don't forget.  You also
get a credit for up to four hours of $3/hour time, every month.


               OK, NOW WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO MY MONTHLY BILL?


Let's cut to the chase. This is what everyone really wants to know.

The answer is -- for the majority of our users, it means very little change at
all, or a change for the better.

When we started working on the price change, we studied the usage patterns of
our active members to see who would be affected, and to what extent.  We
concluded that more than 85% would see about the same or lower bills at the end
of the month.

For the people who like to keep to a strict budget each month, this plan offers
a lot of flexibility and a broader range of services than before.

You have a set subscription fee.  And for that fee, you get a credit for four
hours of standard connect time to spend just about anywhere on GEnie.

There's no asterisk-chasing to make sure you haven't strayed into Value
services.  Less worry of credit card shock.  You can even explore areas of
GEnie you thought you couldn't afford before.

For the active users who spend significant hours a month on GEnie, especially
in the former GEnie Value services, you should see a tremendous savings.  The
hourly rate is half what it was before -- and the best in the business!

Now -- who will see prices rise under the new system? Generally speaking,
anyone who's accustomed to making unusually heavy use of GEnie*Basic services
will have to change his or her usage to keep monthly bills down.


                              SO WHY CHANGE?


Maybe you're wondering why we're bothering to change the rate, if so few people
are affected.  After all, GEnie has had flat fee pricing for three years now.

Well, we did it for a couple of reasons.  With our new pricing, we can continue
to stay competitive in the marketplace, and we can continue to improve our
service to you.

We found that, under the former pricing, a small number of our customers were
making heavy demands on our service -- demands which began to outpace our
infrastructure and capacity. The result was a level of performance that pleased
no one.  Not you.  Not us.  And yet, while other companies were eliminating or
reducing their flat-rate access, we were holding to ours.

Something had to change.  And a price restructuring was the best solution for
the majority of our users.

Now, with the new rates, no one group of members is unduly favored; GEnie can
continue to stay highly competitive among online companies; and we can continue
to improve our service to you.


                      OTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN THE WORKS


There are other changes involved here besides our prices. "Staying competitive"
means offering you better products, better service and better system
performance.

Right now, we have a number of improvements in the works.  We're developing new
front-end software packages for Windows and Macintosh systems -- look for more
on that over the coming months.  We're making technical improvements to enhance
our performance and speed.  We'll be adding new services soon, along with new
bulletin boards and of course, we'll continue to update our software libraries
with more valuable files.


                         SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE


GEnie has always been the very best service for people who really enjoy being
online, and who expect great products and the best value for the time they
spend with us.

That's not going to change.  In fact, this new pricing structure should make it
even easier for you to enjoy everything we have to offer.  We're looking
forward to seeing you online.


Sincerely,


John Barber
General Manager, GEnie

                Runs on all Amigas.
                512K RAM required, 1 MB recommended.
                2 floppy drives or a hard drive recommended (not required).

        SOFTWARE

                Runs under AmigaDOS 1.3 and up.  Two different versions
                are supplied in the package:  one for AmigaDOS 1.3, and
                another for AmigaDOS 2.0 or greater.


COPY PROTECTION

        None.  Installs on a hard drive.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        I tested the program on an A2000 with a GVP 120MB HD, in both 68000
mode (3MB RAM in total), and with a 68030 (11MB RAM in total).  I have never
tried the 1.3 version, but the 2.0 version runs fine under 2.04, 2.1, and
3.0.


REVIEW

        I bought this product over a year ago, when I started to get really
into assembly language programming on the Amiga.  (The freely distributable
assembler A68K is just too slow!)  Nowadays I program in C; I am just
writing this review because it was requested by USENET readers in the
monthly "comp.sys.amiga.reviews Request List."

        The product comes in a sturdy box and contains a professional
ring-bound manual (264 pages plus the index), a "Pocket reference guide" to
the 68000/68008/68010/68012 (but unfortunately doesn't cover the 68020+), and
a disk wallet.  This contains four disks: two for the Workbench 1.3 and 2.0
include files (but no AutoDocs), one for the Workbench 1.3-version of the
program (which simulates a 2.0-style interface under 1.3), and the last one
for the Workbench 2.0-only version which correctly uses GadTools.

        I am really pleased that there is not just one "generic" version of
the program like with so many other applications.  As AmigaDOS gets upgraded,
the 2.0-version of DevPac will benefit.  For example, under Kickstart 3.0,
the scroll bar gadgets get the nice new appearance.  Applications which have
hard-coded the image data for the 2.0-style gadgets in order to run under 1.3
will not benefit.

        There is no "install" script; instead, you simply drag the "DevPac"
and "Includes" drawers to wherever you like on your hard drive.

        The first thing you see when you double-click on the main program
icon is a very professional text-editor.  It is very much like TurboText,
although there are a few differences to make it worthwhile buying TurboText
separately (like I did).  DevPac's editor has no ARexx port, and the editing
facilities are not quite as comprehensive.  However, it should suffice for
all but the most power-hungry users, and indeed can be just used as a
stand-alone editor.  It has all the major features you would expect, like
cut-and-paste via the clipboard, macros (but no ARexx scripts, as I
mentioned), bookmarks, multiple views on the one document, multiple
documents, etc.

        The editor is the most fully Style Guide-compliant application I know
of.  I just cannot fault it.  Everything has hotkeys, it's fast, it's
friendly, and it's extremely professional.  It uses the correct (Screen)
font for menus, has a setting for the (non-proportional) text font in the
main window, and then uses Topaz 8 for all the gadgets (it would be nice to
allow any font here, but very few applications can cope with this, as it is
very hard to program, without using something like GadToolsBox).  It also
uses the ASL file requestor, unlike the current version of TurboText.

        Where the program comes into its own is in the completely integrated
assembler environment.  All the assembler (GenAm) and linker (BLink) options
are controlled via standard ListView gadgets, string gadgets, and checkboxes.
You can generate code for a 68881/2, MMU, 68000 up to 68040, control where
the include files are stored (it is also possible to preassemble them,
although I found this quite difficult to do), and turn on any of 13 different
optimizations.  This last feature allows optimizations to be made
automatically, or for just a message to be given saying where an optimization
could be made.  It is only on an instruction-wide basis, and not a "peephole
optimizer" like with SAS/C, but it always finds many savings I could have
made in my own code.

        Every possible "extra" assembler feature you could think of has been
implemented; e.g., macros, conditional assembly, loops (to save you typing the
same sequence of instructions many times), local labels, alignment, etc.  All
the new 68020+ instructions and addressing modes are present, along with the
FPU-specific mnemonics.

        The "Program" menu contains the important options that you would not
find in a normal text editor.  "Assemble" will automatically check, assemble,
and link your code, and optionally attach an icon to the executable.  "Check"
performs the same operation as "Assemble", except it does not write out the
resulting code to a file.  It does however still keep a copy of it in memory,
so you can use the debugger on it (see below).  This is useful for
floppy-only systems, where writing a file can be time-consuming.  On my '030
and fast Quantum HD, with the include files assembled in the RAM disk (I
actually store them in ENVARC: so they automatically get copied there when I
boot up), assembling is VERY fast indeed.  Probably not quite as fast as
ArgAsm, but far ahead of a typical C compiler like SAS/C.

        If there were errors in the program, the "Find Error", "Next Error",
and "Previous Error" options are useful.  (They all have keyboard shortcuts
too.)  These also jump to the instructions where GenAm made an optimisation,
as well as to any syntactical errors.

        There are many other options available from the editor, and I won't
discuss all of them here.  Some of the nicer ones include being able to
indent the cursor automatically on a new line (since the first column is used
for the opcode, and is usually skipped over), make backups of a file, print
the currently selected block, and select the arguments passed to your program
when the editor runs it (another facility available from the "Program" menu).

        Of course, if your mouse is broken, you can run DevPac from the
Shell.  The manual fully documents all the command-line arguments which GenAm
and Blink accept, and they also have default settings files to save you
typing 200-character command lines every time....

        The other aspect of DevPac is the debugger, MonAm.  This can be
loaded from Workbench or DevPac itself (the latter automatically loads in
your most recently assembled program for you).  I am sure this could form a
separate review in its own right.  It runs on a custom screen (interlaced if
you wish), and basically consists of a number of windows (not Intuition
windows though), through which you can view the CPU's registers, contents of
memory, program disassembly (including labels if you allowed them in the
assembly options), etc.  It has to be said that this part of DevPac is not as
intuitive as the editor.  There are no menus:  just hotkeys.  I must admit I
didn't use it too often, as it meant constant referring to the manual to
remember which keypress did what (e.g., control-Z means "single-step").  It
is a powerful debugger, however, with all the features you would expect:
break points, disassemble to printer or disk, search memory for bytes,
mnemonics, or text, etc.  The on-screen layout is very clear and
professional.  However, it does change the mouse pointer to a "bug" image.
Some people may prefer to use the standard Amiga pointer.


VENDOR SUPPORT

        There is some kind of ongoing telephone service available for a fee,
but I didn't use it.  I did get a chance to speak with a HiSoft
representative at the Amiga Shopper show in London last summer.  At the time,
I only had v3.01 of the software, and a friend of mine who bought it at the
same time as me (not from the same place) had v3.02.  I had brought along my
original disks in the hope that they could upgrade them at the show, but was
told the only copies of DevPac they had were for new customers, and I would
have to go through the normal channels to get the upgrade.

        I also asked him about the possibility of having a user-selectable
font for the settings windows (although even Commodore haven't done this in
Kickstart 3.0!), mentioning that Bryan Ford (author of MultiPlayer - hi
Bryan; what's your new e-mail address?) had written a custom user-interface
builder.  He gave me a business card and the name of the DevPac programmer,
suggesting Bryan write to him about it.  I don't know if anything came of
this. I have never received upgrade information from HiSoft.


CONCLUSIONS

        This is a superb piece of software.  I would give it 10 out of 10.
It closely follows the Style Guide, has a great manual, is very powerful,
very fast, and very user-friendly.  The debugger could be made friendlier
with the addition of a proper Intuition interface, but with the manual open
beside you to remind you of the keys (you would of course learn them very
quickly if you used it often), it is easy to use.

        To anyone seriously intending to write Amiga software in assembly
language, this is almost certainly the best choice.  Plus it is very cheap!

> Amiga Report Bio:  Robert Niles, Technical Editor
  =================================================


Hello, I'm Robert Niles, a new member of the Amiga Report Technical Staff.
I thought I'd give you a little background info on myself.  My computer career
began when I was little, running down to the local Radio Shack and marveling
at the idea of a machine being able to play Blackjack and other word games.
I kept the salesmen busy asking question, changing their demos, and whatever,
so I could get a peek at what a "computer" really was.  I remember the little
thing cost about $1000, and somehow these "games" and such were stored on a
little cassette tape... WOW!  Well I kept doing this every day until they got
tired of me and kicked me out. 

That started me... I bought a C-64, and a 1541 floppy drive.  I was in Techno
Heaven.  I purchased a modem -- those little 300-baud thing-ma-jigs, and
plugged myself into various networks.  Later, I dropped out of the computer
scene except for a few courses on computer programming... until I met the
AMIGA!

The A1000 had been out for a little while and the A500 and A2000 had just come
out.  I bought the A500 with my measly income tax return, and after buying the
A501 and another drive, I bought a modem.  A 2400 baud model... this baby 
cooked!  This was a major jump from before.  Colored BBS's,..even a BBS with a
point and click interface.  I soon started my own.

The A500 I had was a compilation of some old equiptment. I had the SubSystem
500 (a box which sat under the A500 in which you could add two A2000 cards),
in it I had the Micron 2MB board (now let's see who knows of that one) and a
Pacific Peripherals OverDrive controller.  The controller connected to a box
that a SysOp down in El Paso traded me, containing a 32MB RLL HD with the
Adaptec SCSI->RLL converter.  It was a strange system, but it worked.

Since then I have moved to Washington State, where the board is again up and
running.  The kid has the A500, and I purchased a used A2000.  I slapped in
the Micron RAM board (yup, still have it) and added a 200MB HD to the A2090A
controller -- a bit old still, but it suits my needs nicely.

I've been operating the Amiga for quite a while now...telecomputing throughout
the world, and helping others learn more about the Amiga as much as I can.
It's something I fully enjoy, and hope to do it for quite some time to come.

So I'll leave you with my hellos, and ask you to drop me a line if you have a
question or comment, or would like to just chat a bit.

				Robert

> Another Moronic, Inane and Gratuitous Article
  =============================================
  by Chad Freeman
  (cjfst4+@pitt.edu or cjfst4@cislabs.pitt.edu -- Internet)
  (cjfst4@PITTVMS.BITNET -- BITnet)
  (cfreeman -- BIX)

    The era of the on-line magazine has come to the Amiga (with a resounding
Gee! from the audience).  That's right, folks, you can now get information
that is only outdated by WEEKS instead of MONTHS like in those print
magazines.  After a long day of reading all of those on-line messages, you can
go back and RE-READ them in your favorite on-line magazine!  But one thing is
missing from these on-line magazines, a void I, having no particular
motivation (or writing skill) whatsoever, have decided to fill.  Thus the
'Another Moronic, Inane and Gratuitous Article' column by yours truly, the
bane of seriousness everywhere.  Well, ok, I'm lucky if I get a chuckle, but
if I get to poke fun at the Amiga community AND possibly get my name in
phosphorescent glow, it may boost my fragile ego (in other words,
pleasepleasePLEASE put me in your magazine!).  So, without further ado (or
previous ado), lets get on with it.

    First, the joke of the week.  Thanks to the guy who posted it on the
internet (I'm too lazy to look up your name).

    Q. How long does it take Bill Gates to change a light bulb?
    A. He doesn't; he just declares darkness to be a standard!

    I figured all of you self-concious Amigans would get a kick out of
slamming Bill Gates (the guy IS a nerd, isn't he?).  We'll show HIM for not
developing on the Amiga (although I hear he uses one to hold his recipe file).
Anyway, now that I've endeared myself to you, let's talk about Commodore,
shall we?  I have a little theory about why Commodore is SO BAD at what it
does.  You see, secretly Irving Gould (maybe we can convince HIM to buy
Microsoft?) doesn't want Commodore to be in the computer business at all, he
really wants to get into the fried chicken business!  'Where did you get a
scatter-brained idea like that?!?' you ask.  Well, remember those stupid Billy
commercials Commodore aired in what has been a long string of failed
advertising?  Remember what Tip O'Neil got thrust into his hand as he entered
the house? FRIED CHICKEN!  And there are more seemingly ODD coincidences that
leave me without a doubt that Irving is forcing a drastic change in market for
Commodore.  The very name of the company, for instance.  What would compete
with Colonel Sander's chicken but Commodore Gould's chicken?  Give a little
facelift to that C= logo and it turns into a chicken's head!  And we all know
the entire marketing department is a bunch of clucks!  Ever notice how, if you
removed the guts from an Amiga 2000, it would be the perfect size for a Jumbo
Carry-Home Pack of chicken with biscuits and gravy?  But the most amazing
proof of all is the infamous 'secret message' built into the 2.04 kickstart
ROMs.  Until now this message has remained a corporate secret, awaiting the
day when West Chester Broiled Chicken unveiled its first outlet, but now I
bring it to you.  Now, you can't see this message through a simple hex dump of
the ROM; oh no, it is ENCODED using PGP!  So you MUST go through the following
steps to see the message:

    1. Hold down the left amiga key
    2. Press your left and right mouse button SIMULTANEOUSLY 17 times
    3. Keep that left amiga key down!  Now, press escape, F6, the ) keypad key,
       and the space bar, and while holding them all down, repeatedly tap the
       return key while ejecting a disk in DF0: and removing the mouse cord
       from the mouse port.
    4. Continue holding down the above key combination for 5 hours, tapping
       the left cursor key every 12 and a half minutes, and you will see the
       secret message!

    Well, have fun trying this out; I think you'll be surprised by the result
(if your fingers don't cramp before the 5 hours are up).  I consider it
UNEQUIVOCABLE proof that Gould has it in for our beloved computer maker,
Commodore!  Chicken, indeed!  Of course, a change like this probably WOULD
increase Commodore's stock prices considerably...

    That's all for this week, tune in next week, same BATTY-time, same
BATTY-channel, for another installment of A.M.I.G.A., the article that goes
where no politically-correct man has been dumb enough to go before...

                     I still cherish this terminal dumb,

                        Once in splendor I did dwell,
                      Now I rust in an old glass cage.
                                    
                   "Take some classes", the converts say.

                    "But VM and CICS still fill my day",
                    I often tell them in a timid mutter.
                                    
                  What's this, they're putting on my table?

                       Okay, okay, I'll give it a try.

Various real-life sayings (some attributed, some not) that could fit in-

     Experience is the best teacher.
     But her pop quizzes can be MIGHTY tough.

     If you're going backwards, the odometer always reads zero.
 
     A single daisy, hand delivered, is better than a dozen roses 
     delivered by the florist.
 
     Never offend people with style when you can offend them with 
     substance.
 
     You can prove anything if you make up your data.
 
     You can prove _almost_ anything if you are allowed to exclude data 
     that don't fit.
 
     A dog does not bite the hand that feeds him. That is the principal 
     difference between a dog and a man.
  
     A gentleman is one who never inflicts pain.

     Just because you ignore the facts, does not mean they cease to

     "Solutions are the larva of new problems."
                                          ---Jim Wells, 1993

     Knights in shining armor are easy targets.

     Children generally survive their parent's best intentions.

     The concept of an "inalienable right" is a legal fiction. No 
     religion endorses the concept, and Darwin certainly never heard of 
     it.

     Statistics are like a Bikini

      What they conceal is even more important.

     Oliver Wendell Holmes told us that taxes are the price we pay for

                      The Portal System's Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its first anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press has
consistantly raved about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.
(Quotes available upon request).

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) "indial" node anywhere in the USA or through Tymnet from anywhere in
North America.  If you have an account on a university or commercial or
military Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using their
UNIX Telnet or Rlogin programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.

Here are some of Portal/Amiga Zone's noteworthy features:

 - Over 1 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files, now online, 24 hours a day.
   Portal has dedicated a 1.6 GIGabyte disk drive to the Amiga Zone.
   We have unlimited space for files and new uploads. Whenever that
   drive fills up, we'll add another one!

 - PLUS.. The Fred Fish Disk collection of freely distributable
   software, online 24 hours a day.

 - Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command.

 - Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES,
   and many others including Compute's Amiga Resource with over
   4 Megabytes of exclusive Compute magazine disk stuff you won't find
   elsewhere.

 - 35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.  Since Portal has FTP connections we can get
   a new program online within MINUTES of its being announced on Usenet.

 - No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.  Start downloading
   files with your first session on Portal. 

 - Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

 - Message bases galore where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

 - Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave and
   HyperAmi are ported right into the Zone message bases. You can
   read months worth of postings. They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

 - FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox. Send letters of any length to computer users in the
   entire industrialized world.  No limit. No extra charges. No kidding!
   Portal email has some amazing features:  you can even run a mail
   session "inside" another mail session to send blind carbon copies
   for example.  Grab Usenet articles and store copies in your mailbox.
   Email a program to a friend in Australia or Sweden or just about
   anywhere.

 - The USENET hierachy of thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  Usenet feeds into Portal many times each hour.
   There are 14 Amiga-specific Usenet newsgroups with hundreds of
   articles posted every day, including postings by Commodore 
   personnel.  Since Usenet is distributed worldwide, your questions
   and answers can be seen by literally hundreds of thousands of
   people the same day you post it.  

 - Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name but a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

 - The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   This optional package gets you headline news, bulletins, stories,
   features, sports, weather, and computer industry news and press
   releases fed into Portal many times each week. Stay on top of the

# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Notes: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are 48 direct, high speed
   lines into Portal. Busy signals are rare! 

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Tymnet 9600bps services is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" or "rlogin" programs
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone sent me!"

That number again:  408-973-9111.

Portal Communications accepts MasterCard, Visa, or you can pre-pay any
amount by personal check or money order.  Sorry, no American Express or
"checkfree" at this time.

A blind man walks into K-Mart with his seeing-eye dog.  The man picks up his
dog by the tail and swings it around in a circle above his head.

The store manager approaches... "What are you doing?"

The man replies, "Looking around!"
