===========================================================================

We've already burned up half of 1997.  The wild Escom ride ended with the
Gateway purchase.  Already, Amiga International has licensed the Amiga to
three companies (Micronik, ICS, and Index) although the two former
companies are simply authorized to do A1200 motherboard rebuilds into
tower/Zorro cases.  Not the innovation we were hoping for right away, but
it's a start.

The questions never really go away, they just change.  The question of the
buyout has changed back into questions of direction.  As of now, AI isn't
posting their long-term plans on the church doors.  But they've been
visible.  AI has committed to appearing at a number of Amiga events
throughout the rest of the year, including the famous Cologne show.

I can't answer the questions for AI, all I can do is sit and wait with the
rest of the world.  I'm perfectly willing to sit back for the time being,
go about my business (including AR and the very time-consuming Legacy,
which will be late despite our best efforts) and let things unfold.  Others
are not willing to take the same passive attitude, and you can get involved
in one of a number of acronym organizations who propose to, shall we say,
strongly suggest what AI should do with the Amiga.

June flew by me without releasing an issue of AR.  No excuse, it just
happened.

The next issue of AR will be released simultaneously in HTML and
AmigaGuide.  The first time around, HTML distribution will likely be
limited to Aminet and participating web sites.  At the same time, the
AmigaGuide version will shed some of the less active sections (dealer
listings, BBSes, etc.) and pointers will be placed to online resources.
The core material of the magazine will likely be available to all in
AmigaGuide for quite some time to come.  We may start up a HTML
distribution list--that still remains to be seen.

I wish continued progress to AI, and continued enjoyment to you and your
Amigas.  See you in a few weeks.

Jason

The Amiga Informer is about to release our biggest and best issue to 
date. Due out approximately June 18, you will find issue 8 crammed 
with important and detailed articles, information and reviews. All the 
Informer's staff and writers are passionate Amiga users. We use only 
Amigas to create The Informer and we use them to fill all our 
computing needs, providing us with a true insight to the platform.

The Amiga Informer is currently a mail order, subscription based 
publication. You will not find us at your local newsstand. However, 
this fact allows us to keep our prices down for both our readers and 
advertisers. This also allows us to give our subscribers personal 
attention when in comes to processing subscriptions and answering 
questions.

>From time to time you may find a sample issue of The Informer 
enclosed with one of your Amiga purchases or see a copy at your 
user group meeting. While we do send out some complimentary 
issues, they do not provide you with all the benefits that a 
subscription would bring.

As a subscriber, you can place free classified ads for your used 
Amiga products in each issue. This offers a good way to directly 
reach thousands of Amiga users who want that item you just aren't 
using anymore. Perhaps you are looking to find an elusive Amiga 
product. Placing a wanted to buy ad in The Informer just might find it 
for you. It is difficult at best to sell a used Amiga product in your local 
newspaper­and it costs you money. In The Informer, your items are 
seen by an Amiga-specific audience. Therefore, you can sell them 
quickly, and probably pay for your subscription in the process.

If you are a subscriber with an email address, you will automatically 
receive the Amiga Update Newsletter direct to your email box. Amiga 
Update is produced by Brad Webb. Through a special arrangement 
with The Informer, you will get all the latest announcements, press 
reports, rumors and news at least twice a month with Amiga Update. 
This info is fresh and direct from the horse's mouth. No need to hunt 
or wait for the latest info­it's sent directly to you with Amiga Update. 

Subscribers also receive discounts from Liage International. Through 
an arrangement with Liage, we are able to offer our subscribers a 
10% discount on all orders. While some might think Liage is just a 
game reseller, the facts are different. They carry not only a full line of 
popular games, but many educational and instructional titles, as well 
as a full line of CD-ROM titles.

And if that isn't plenty already, The Informer is also working hard to 
bring you more benefits. We expect to soon have an arrangement 
worked out with a well know authorized Amiga repair company that 
will give our subscribers discounts on selected repairs. Likewise, we 
will periodically be able to offer our subscribers special limited time 
discounts on popular software titles. These discounts are made 
possible by software developers or distributors who sometimes offer 
promotional deals on their products, and we want our subscribers to 
have a chance at these special savings.

If you would like to become a subscriber to The Amiga Informer, now 
is the perfect time. We offer a No Risk, No Obligation Guarantee to 
try us out. You will receive a bill with your first issue, but if you're not 
completely satisfied, just write CANCEL on the bill and return it. If 
you decide not to subscribe, the first issue is yours to keep and you 
will owe us nothing.

Simply call (914) 566-4665 to subscribe by VISA or MC. If you want
to test us out first, call and request to be billed with your first
issue. Or if you prefer, you can visit our website at
www.amigainformer.com to fill out the On-line Subscription
Form to take advantage of the No Risk Guarantee offer.

The Informer is devoted to bringing you an accurate and reliable 
resource of Amiga information. So if you're still not convinced, 
request that we send you a bill with our No Risk, No Obligation
Guarantee, and find out for yourself.

Subject: Amiga Report - Letters page

Hi there!

I just thought I'd write and tell you how much I enjoy reading Amiga
Report.  Due to me living in England and the English Amiga mags only cover
a small section of American Amiga news it is good to read Amiga Report as
it tells me whats happening to the Amiga in America.  Thanks again for the
mag.  BTW I'm possibly the youngest Amiga Report reader at the age of 14.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Bill Toner (wwt5491@rit.edu) 

I've been a reader of AR for a few years now, and love your magazine.  I
also thing this is the best place to voice my concerns about the situation
between Villate Tronic and Phase5.  I recently purchased an Amiga 4000T
system, Cyberstorm MKII 040 and PicassoIV setup from Software Hut, and have
been very dissapointed that I can't use Cybergraphics.  Had I known this, I
would probably have got a different graphics board.  From what I gather,
Phase5 won't do it until VT gives them a free card, and VT won't do that
because they had to buy P5 boards for other comatibility testing.  The
Cybergraphics web site has a letter from Phase5 that they want to support
my board but...  There's a set of emails from VT there saying we don't need
Cybergfx anyway so we should get over it. 

Now, this soap opera is getting old very quickly, and I'm beginning to
regret my PicassoIV.  I can't run some Cybergfx supporting programs, like
the osiris mpeg player, Shapeshifter didn't work well until it specifically
noticed Picasso96, and a bunch of other Cybergfx programs are going to do
the same thing.  Looking at the Cybergfx site, it is clear they are doing
everything they can to make supporting programs NOT work on picasso96, but
ONLY on Cybergfx drivers.  This is understandable 2 comanies trying to
steal customers from the other, but I feel like I'm stuck in the middle and
I don't like it.  Cybergfx developers want us to use their drivers but
won't make one for my board, and VT says only software made by Phase5
doesn't work.  VT is wrong, I've seen it with my own eyes.  I think that
lacking Cybergfx support is going to hurt their sales, not Phase5's.  I
really wish the children running the two groups would grow up and get
along. 

I emailed both companies many times and never got a response to my concern.
I hope this letter will get their attention, and let other loyal Amigans
know about the problem.  Also, I would like to know if there are current or
potential PicassoIV owners that would like Cybergraphics, would any of you
be interested in donating towards buying a board for the cybergraphics
people to use?  I realise it's a lot of money, but if enough people would
do this we would only spend maybe $20 each or so, and get to use real Amiga
software again.

Bill Toner II
wwt5491@rit.edu
Vice-President of ACURIT, the Amiga Computer Users of RIT
An unhappy PicassoIV owner

-   I understand your frustration, and agree that it's very unfortunate
    that Amiga users have been caught in the middle.  I sense another level 
    of frustration, too--you feel very cut off from the situation, and
    that's the disenfranchising effect of being in the US while the two
    bickering companies are based in Germany.  Your options for directly
    harassing the companies about the issue are far more limited.  You
    can't make yourself heard as easily.  Trust me, I've battled the
    damaging effects of being so cut off from the main workings of the
    Amiga market for years now, and it's only starting to get better.

    As to the real issue at hand, I can only hope that the situation
    is resolved one way or another very soon.  Both companies have their
    legitimate complaints, but at its heart it is making us less
    productive, and some sort of accomodation should be reached. -Jason

The AR100 - The Top 100 Amiga Games of All Time

Amiga Report is launching a major new survey, aiming to determine the best
Amiga games of the past 12 years.  The Amiga Report 100 will be a reference
for gamesplayers past and present, and will be repeated every 6 months to
reflect the constantly changing Amiga games market.

What we want you to do is let us know your own personal "top ten" games -
the ten titles you've enjoyed playing more than any others on your Amiga. 
You can vote for any Amiga game - public domain, shareware or commercial. 
There's no discrimination between game genres - at the end of the day,
number 1 in the AR100 will the be game which YOU have voted the best Amiga
game ever.

Voting is easy. We allow you to vote in 3 different ways ...

By E-Mail: send your vote to AR100@protec.co.uk.  Include your full name,
e-mail address, and your top ten favorite games of all time.  You'll
receive an automatic reponse when your vote has been registered.

On the web: Point that browser at http://www.dhp.com/~kend and fill in the
form.  Again, you'll receive an automatic e-mail response.

By Fax: Send a fax to Amiga Report on +44 131 226 6996, with your full name
and top ten.

Of course, there are rules.  We only allow one vote per reader, so please
don't send 15 e-mails voting for the same games.  If we suspect that anyone
has voted more than once, all their votes will be disregarded.  Please give
the full name of the game - a vote for "Tetris" doesn't tell us much; tell
us which version.  All votes must be in by 31st August 1997, and to keep
things consistant, you can only vote on games released on or before 31st
June 1997.  The results will be announced in the first September issue of
Amiga Report.  Above all else, the editors' discision is final.

May the best game win!

@node NEWS5 "Delfina Lite"
@toc NEWS

     ANNOUNCE: DELFINA LITE - NEW DSP AUDIO CARD FOR GENERAL USE

1. TECH

Delfina Lite is based on Delfina DSP, the world's first general use
multifunctional DSP audio card for Amiga.  From the Delfina DSP some
functions have been deleted (serial/parallel ports, memory expansion) and
some functions have been added (multiple sound input, expansion port).  The
modern manufacturing allows a very low price: SRP is $299.

Delfina Lite is primarily a DSP audio card, and it is best suited for
producing and recording audio with optional realtime effects.  Effects can
be applied on any sound produced by Delfina or external source
transparently, and all the sounds produced by Delfina-capable programs or
external source can be mixed into Delfina's output.  Delfina Lite is also
freely programmable for all general computing tasks using the supplied
compiler and libraries.

With the upcoming S/PDIF option Delfina Lite turns your Amiga into a
professional 24-bit computer audio workstation.  The optional serial port
adds a new high-speed MIDI-capable serial into your computer with very
little CPU usage.

Features:

  - 40 MHz Motorola DSP56002 digital signal processor
     * 20 MIPS, upto 120 MOPS
     * 24 bit data bus (144 dB dynamic range)

  - 96kB (32kWords) SRAM
     * Zero-waitstate (12ns)

  - Stereo audio codec (Crystal CS4231A)
     * Sample frequencies upto 48 kHz at 16 bit
     * Three stereo inputs, one stereo output
     * All inputs can be mixed with Delfina's output

  - Two stereo RCA inputs

  - One stereo RCA output

  - Internal connector for audio input from CD-ROM

  - expansion connector for MIDI-compatible serial port and 24-bit S/PDIF
    digital I/O

  - Fully programmable using the supplied software

Requirements:

  - Amiga with Zorro-II slot (A2000, A3000, A4000)
  - AmigaOS 2.04 or higher
  - 68020 processor or higher
  - about 5MB of hard disk space


2. SUPPORT

Delfina Lite fully supports AHI, the retargetable audio standard for Amiga.
Number of AHI supporting programs is steadily increasing.  In the future,
Delfina Lite will also emulate the Toccata card in software.

In addition to AHI standard, Delfina Lite can run multiple Delfina and AHI
programs at the same time, and various effects can be applied globally, on
a single program output or a single external input, with all the sounds
mixed together at wished levels.  Only Delfina's DSP usage and internal
memory set the limits.

Software supporting Delfina includes:

  - Octamed SoundStudio
  - AudioLab16 for Delfina
  - SoundFX
  - Digi Booster Pro
  - Hippoplayer
  - APlayer
  - SinED
  - Play 16
  - ShapeShifter 3.6
  .. and many more.

Delfina Lite system software includes:

  - AHI (Audio Hardware Interface) driver
     * Play&record multiple channel audio
     * AHI standard allows you to write software that works
       on other audio boards or normal Amiga audio too

  - delfina.library
     * For basic operations and user's own DSP software
     * Supports DSP program multitasking
     * Enables audio playback and recording

  - DelfPrefs
     * Utility to adjust Delfina's parameters

  - DelFX
     * Multiple realtime effects
     * Record and play AIFFstereo samples at 4000-96000 Hz
     * Configurable shortcut effect combinations
     * Can be used to process input or output of other programs

  - DelfLoad
     * Shows DSP usage and other statistics

  - MUI 3.8 unregistered version
     * licensed for use with Delfina software

  - A56
     * DSP56002 assembler
     * Allows you to write your own DSP programs

  - Many example programs including source code

  - Software upgrades available for free, at http://www.sci.fi/~petsoff/ftp

DESCRIPTION

  CheckHTML checks whether a HTML document is conforming with the
  HTML (3.2) DTD. This will be done by using the sgmls parser from
  James Clark, the HTML DTD and a small Shell script.
  CheckHTML can verify HTML 3.2 and HTML 2.0 documents. Newer HTML
  versions can be easily supported by placing the new DTD into the
  'sgml:' directory and adding their public identifier to the 'CATALOG'
  file. The upcoming XML standard could be easily supported the same
  way!

NEW FEATURES

  - Improved documentation
  - Added some @{AMIGAGUIDE} V40 features to the documentation
  - Improved installer script
  - Added CountStrings
  - Added SelectString
  - CheckHTML now asks for (multiple) files when started without

  "Built With Amiga Software For The Internet" campaign launch.

AUTHOR

  Keith Blakemore-Noble (keith@amiga.u-net.com)

DESCRIPTION

  Today (8th June 1997) sees the launch of the Built With Amiga
  Software For The Internet campaign.

  The best way to describe this campaign is to quote directly from
  it's main page -

  "You may have noticed some webpages bearing logos indicating that
   they were made with Microsoft software, or made on AppleMacs, or
   whatever. Well, this campaign is designed to be a focus point
   for all those of us who use our Amigas to create our Web Pages -
   let's show the rest of the world just how good this machine
   really is, and how widely used it is!"

  This campaign is designed to increase Amiga awareness on the net,
  through the use of a distinctive logo on your own web pages.
  (provided you DID build them with Amiga software, of course ;-))

  However, it is ALSO intended to provide you with a source of
  information concerning all categories of Amiga Internet
  software.

  Amiga International and Gateway2000 have been advised of the
  existance of this campaign.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  The only requirement is that if you add teh logo to your Web
  Pages, they MUST have actually been Built With Amiga Software! :)

AVAILABILITY

  The campaign web site is already available, although details are
  still being added (and will continue to be added as people bring
  more details to my attention, and as new software arrives).

  http://www.amiga.u-net.com/BuiltWithAmiga/home.html

  Note - if you are using an old browser that does not support
  HTTP1.1 then this link may not work correctly, in which case
  please try http://www.personal.u-net.com/~amiga/BuiltWithAmiga/home.html

PRICE

  There is no fee involved with becoming associated.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

  The whole object of this campaign is to increase awareness of the
  Amiga and its role within the Internet, so please feel free to
  distribute this information far and wide, and to add the logo and
  link to your own Web Pages.

  This campaign is working closely with the Amiga Web Campaign and
  also the Made on Amiga site.

  Maggot

VERSION

  0.99x  FINAL BETA

AUTHOR

  Markus Mannevaara
  mamannev@abo.fi

DESCRIPTION

  Maggot is the classic worm-game where you eat apples, trying to
  get the worm as long as possible. The special attraction of Maggot
  is free movement of the worm, as seen in PizzaWorm for the PC and
  SuperWorm on the Amiga, but even better. In Maggot you have more
  control of the Worm, in the form of different turn tightnesses,
  and two different speeds.

  It's guaranteed to be very addictive, and the absolute timewaster
  when you have a break somewhere. It naturally features a highscore
  list, so that there would be something to strive for in the game.

  This version of Maggot is the final beta, we would like you to test
  this software and report any ideas or suggestions you have, before
  it is released more widely.

  The main features of Maggot are:

    o Very addictive.
    o Free movement.
    o Nice font-sensitive (GadTools) user interface.
    o Set-uppable to a wide extent.
    o Good graphics, that fall back to simpler graphics if your
      system is limited.
    o Good highscore-list, including a list-merging function.
    o Sounds (not fully implemented in this beta).

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    o AmigaOS 3.0
    o For a special Color-cycling mode to work, the screen needs to
      have 256 or less colors.

AVAILABILITY

  This final beta of Maggot is only available from our website at:
          http://www.abo.fi/~mamannev/circlesoft/maggot.html
  Later versions will also be put on Aminet.

PRICE

  Maggot is Freeware.

@toc NEWS

[This news comes courtesy of Rolf Rotvel (rolfr@post4.tele.dk) who has some
relieving news.  Some time ago, reports arose that Timm Martin, who wrote
SID, had died.  We published those accounts in Amiga Report...it seems we
were mistaken.  -Jason]

Here's some good news.  I've been emailing a bit with Timm Martin, the
author of the famous directory utility SID.  I am happy to tell that
contrary to rumors he's very much alive and it looks like there's still
hope for the continued developement of SID.

Here's what he had to say (Edited together from a couple of emails):

"I do still have the SID source code.  I'm currently in negotiations with
an American company to license the source code to produce another version
of SID.  Hence, I cannot release it to the public domain at this time."

"I can tell you that negotiations have stalled somewhat, so if you know
anyone with a little money and a lot of wherewithall who's interested in
licensing and updating SID, let me know."

"However, because of my current heavy commitment to my software company, I
don't really have the time and energy to actively pursue a deal.  I'll be
glad to listen to any valid offer, but the negotiations need to be quick,
the deal solid, and my participation after the fact extremely limited to
nonexistent."

Regards,
Timm

[So, if you're interested in the future of SID, drop Timm a line.]

@toc NEWS

Issue 8 of The Amiga Informer will be available by June 18, and oh,
what an issue it is! Our staff of Amiga devotees have gone over the
edge to bring you the biggest issue yet. I think you'll be impressed at
what we've put together. You'll also be impressed to see just how good
Amiga computers are at desk top publishing.

One of the features in this issue is an in-depth look at what the
Gateway 2000 purchase of Amiga might mean for the future. We help
you read between the lines of the May 16 press release to find out.
You will also find exclusive photos and an article on the World of
Amiga show in London from our new UK correspondent Adrian
Pickering. Phase 5 demonstrated their newest BlizzardPPC and
CyberStormPPC PowerUP boards at the show and we'll give you the
run down on what was seen. We also have inside news on the public
unveiling of the Jay Miner Society, sponsors of the Open Amiga
Initiative mentioned by both Gateway and Amiga International.

Along with numerous news bytes and briefs, product announcements,
and our developer profile, we bring you our usual columns. This
issue's columns deal with managing your Workbench Icons, and
understanding and using MultiUser Domains. In addition, we have a
column that details a wide selection of programs that can be combined
to create one integrated system for internet access.

We have several reviews in Issue 8. The email program Air Mail v4.2 is
evaluated along with a serious look at Pretium, the personal finance
management program. We also take a look at the old standby corrupt
disk recovery program DiskSalv4 and the combat game Tiny Troops.
In addition, we summarize the AGA Experience 2 CD, and two classic
games; Dune II and Syndicate.

To round things off, we list a selection of dealers, user groups and fine
websites in our Contacts section and, as always, intersperse useful
tips throughout the entire issue.

Because The Informer is quickly increasing its subscription base, we
are limiting the amount of complimentary issues we distribute. The only
way you can be assured of getting this and future issues is to
subscribe. We offer several benefits to our subscribers including free
classified ads, discounts and incentives from select dealers and
distributors, and, for our net connected readers, up-to-the
minute news delivered directly to your email address with the Amiga
Update newsletter by Brad Webb.

We provide a no risk, no obligation subscription offer. Fill out and send
the on-line form at www.amigainformer.com/subscribe.cgi. We will
send your first issue of The Informer with a bill enclosed. If you review
The Informer and find you are not satisfied, just write CANCEL on the
bill and return it. The first issue is yours to keep and you will owe us
nothing. If you like it, a variety of payment options are provided on the
bill. You are under no obligation so you just can't lose. Give us a try
today and see what we are all about.

pretend them to join us, but make all of us unite, to gather information:
News, product buyings/sales, source code in ongoing developments and,
generally, any other event related to the Amiga in Spain.

4.  Organize, all over Spain, Amiga parties and all sorts of reunions that
put a bunch of amigans around what they like and know best.

5.  Do our best in supporting companies who create Amiga products.

Besides this, we are giving the following internet services:

- Users: We'll publish names and home page URLs of users and groups of

@toc NEWS

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

18 June,1997

         AmigaZone Expands! More Amiga mailing lists added. 
                   Amiga Fidonet "Echoes" added.

The AmigaZone, hosted at CalWeb Internet Services (formerly located on
Portal), has expanded our offerings yet again!

The Zone, founded in 1985 by Harv Laser, has always prided itself on
carrying as much Amiga-oriented information, in the form of messages
(postings, articles), and files as possible.  Now we're bursting at the
seams with STUFF for you and your Amiga!

In our current incantation, as a WildCat5 system hosted by CalWeb Internet
Services, we now carry an insanely huge amount of info for you to enjoy!

Your $19.95/month membership gets you everything the AmigaZone has to
offer.  There are NEVER any extra-cost areas just out of your reach.

Not only do we carry all the Amiga Usenet Newsgroups, but we also have
message bases for Amiga-oriented mailing lists.  We just added another half
dozen mailing lists, and here is the current roster of the lists you can
read in the Zone:

  AWeb Mailing List
  Imagine Mailing List
  Toaster Mailing List
  Lightwave Mailing List
  Opalvision Mailing List
  IBrowse Mailing List
  Aladdin 4D Mailing List
  AmTelnet Mailing List
  CU Amiga Mailing List
  ImageFX Mailing List
  Miami Mailing List
  SoftLogik Mailing List
  Voyager Mailing List

By feeding these mailing lists into our message bases, you don't have to
clog your email with them.  You don't have to worry about disk storage
costs at your ISP.  Just read them online in our Text-style BBS interface,
or with your favorite browser in our Web interface.  Some of these lists
generate hundreds of postings each week.

Today, we expanded the Zone even more.  We're now feeding the
Amiga-specific Fidonet "echos" into their own message bases.  These are the
ones we're carrying:

  Fidonet NetMail
  Amiga International Echo 
  Amiga Games
  Amiga Hardware/Software For-Sale
  International Amiga CDROM/CDTV/CD32 Conference
  FileFind echo for Amiga Computers
  Amiga WorldWide Conference
  Amiga Programmers Area
  Amiga BBS Sysops Conference
  International Amiga Telecom Roundtable
  Amiga Pointing Software
  Amy Tech Conference

If you've ever wanted to read Fidonet and didn't have a local BBS that
carried it, or maybe you did and he only has one phone line that's always
busy, well here ya go.  You'll never get a "busy signal" connecting to the
AmigaZone.  And again you can read all these echos in our text-style
interface with any terminal program or telnet client, or use your browser
and read them in our incredibly easy-to-use Web interface.  Or you can even
download them using our "QWK Packet" system and use an offline reader.

(Speaking of Web interfaces, I've seen a lot of Web-based message base
interfaces..  some of them really suck!  The one we have on our Wildcat
system is so nice, simple and fast to use you won't believe it!).

In addition to our own local message bases, Usenet groups, Amiga mailing
lists, and now Fidonet echos, the Zone features one of the largest
collection of Amiga files and programs you're likely to find anywhere!  We
have over 40,000 files always available, 24 hours a day for you downloading
pleasure, both on our hard drives and on our CD-ROM changer.  Nothing is
"by request" or "offline." It's all there.  All the time.  And we have tons
of files you won't find on Aminet or any other online service around.
Files aren't deleted because we run out of space.  We have TONS of disk
space.

Want more?  Okay how about this: we have an online image thumbnail maker. 
Not sure you want to download .gif or .jpg images from our library?  Want
to see what they look like first?  Just use our text-interface's instant
thumbnail maker.  Mark the files, choose the thumbnail option and it'll
spit out a labelled thumbnail screen in eight different resolutions, as a
.gif or a .jpg and Zmodem it right onto your screen.

Oh, and did I mention that you can wander through our huge categorized
library, mark the files you want, and then download them all at one time? 
Yah, you can do that :)

That's not enough?  Okay, how about this: We have a LIVE weekly contest
each Sunday night.  We've had contests for over 300 weeks running and we've
given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes.  Software, CD-ROMs,
even hardware.  (We gave out an OpalVision a week ago).  The contests are
random chance, and fair to even the slowest typists.  There's a huge list
of prizes for you to choose from.  Yes, that's right.  If you win, you get
to choose the prize you want!

The AmigaZone is run and managed by long-time Amiga-owning professionals. 
You ask questions, you get answers.  You want someone to yak with?  We have
a live interactive chat seven nights a week. 

I promise you that you will not find more Amiga-oriented STUFF in any other
single location anywhere. 

Your $19.95 monthly fee gets you the entire AmigaZone:

 - our text-style BBS interface you telnet into from anywhere
 - our Web browser interface
 - our private FTP site
 - our POP email server
 - your own "amigazone.com" email address

And if that wasn't enough, you also get a full CalWeb UNIX shell account
with all the standard UNIX shell tools for email and news, plus 10 meg of
free storage for your own Web site if you want to build one.

And CalWeb has LIVE 24 hour tech support, seven days a week!  (Can you name

If all of this doesn't convince you, you can try out the Zone absolutely

We have found a suitable location and date for this years show...

Date:            November 1st & 2nd
Location:   Concourse Hotel at the Columbus Airport.

The concourse hotel is a classy facility within walking distance of the
airport terminal.
They have a bar and resturant, indoor and outdoor pools and an excercise
facility.
Single Rooms run $94 and rooms with two double beds run $104.
 
We have reserved the Grand Ballroom (their largest) which from what I see from
the fliers from the Gateway show is larger than the gateway show floor.

I know there will be some increase to cover the higher cost of the facilities
but we expect them to be close to next years show.

As soon as Dave Pearce gets back from his honeymoon we will have pictures of
the facility on our web page at http://www.amicon.org

Let me know if you have questions, and please pass this information along to
any interested people and vendors...

@toc NEWS

N O    A M I G A   T O   W A S T E

A new Amiga site has been created to provide a place where developers and
users can come together as one to share ideas and comments.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SITE'S PURPOSE

Problems

* A lot of commercial software houses have left the Amiga-scene and less
  'state of the art' programs are released.
* Inspired and skilled programmers have become rare 'cause a lot moved
  over to other systems.
* Public Domain authors tend to have a strange habit of 're'-programming
  the same software tools over and over again.

Conclusion

Make sure that every programming effort provides a final product that is
useful, original, easy to use and up to date.

Solution

An online database that collects ideas, comments and wishes of the users. 
The contents can be freely consulted as long as every programmer reports
what idea he's working on and how the development progresses.

HiQ's Siamese System goes Alpha

HiQ is pleased to announce that the Siamese System now supports Alpha based
WindowsNT workstations.  In conjunction with Digitals FX!32 translation
system, version 2 of the software now shipping runs transparently and at
high speed.

The Siamese System integrates a Windows95/NT PC with any Amiga with an 020
and AmigaOS 3.x.  In use the two systems appear as one, greater than the
sum of its parts.  The supplied software and hardware allows you to use one
monitor, mouse, keyboard and printer for both machines, as well as mounting
all the drives of the Windows machine on the Amiga.  The amazing Siamese
RTG allows you to retarget compatible Amiga screens at high speed to your
Windows desktop, in resolutions up to 2048x2048, and has to be seen to be
believed running on a Wintel machine, let alone an Alpha.

With high end Alpha 21164A CPUs reaching 600mhz, and the 21164PC CPUs
coming in at Pentium prices, Alphas are the perfect machines to Siamese
with your Amiga.  The awesome rendering speed of the Alpha in conjunction
with the still unbeaten video capabilities of the Amiga/Toaster/Flyer will
unleash your creativity and greatly increase your productivity.

@toc NEWS

                              AMARQUEE V1.41
                            (Released 4/17/97)

The Problem:  

 You have a great idea for a killer multi-player Internet game  
 or multi-user net app, but it's a total pain in the @)#$* to  
 write all the TCP connection and data synchronization code  
 you'll need to get it going.  So you put your idea on the  
 back-burner and go play "MineSweeper" instead.  And thus the  
 Amiga is deprived of a fun Internet app.  D-oh!  :( 
  
The Solution:  (well, okay, it's *a* solution, anyway) 

 Enter AMarquee.  AMarquee is a system that handles all of 
 the icky information distribution details for you, allowing 
 you to concentrate on coding your application, rather than on  
 which data goes into which socket when.  AMarquee consists of 
 a shared library and a TCP daemon, which work together to 
 get your data where it needs to be.  Your program simply 
 calls amarquee.library functions to broadcast the data, 
 and waits on a provided MsgPort for data from other hosts. 
 Easy!  The TCP daemon, AMarqueed runs on a well connected 
 central Amiga (such as isys.ml.org) and acts as a sort of 
 interconnecting switchboard, distributing information to 
 many clients at once. 

Features of amarquee.library (the shared library/API): 

 - Works with AmiTCP, Miami, or any other stack that is "AmiTCP compatible". 
 - Simple API that requires no knowledge of socket programming to use. 
 - Each AMarquee connection you make automatically and transparently 
   starts a seperate execution thread, so your app will never 
   be forced to wait while data is sent or received. 
 - An arbitrary number of connections may be active at once. 
 - Allows you to "subscribe" to data that interests you, so that 
   when the data is changed you will be automatically notified. 
   You never need to poll for anything! 
 - An easy mechanism for sending messages to one or many other 
   AMarquee clients that are logged into the same server. 
 - Standard Amiga wildcarding is supported in all applicable functions.   
   This allows you to easily and succinctly refer to one host or data  
   item, or many, as appropriate. 
 - Includes and several small example applications included. 
 - Operation is almost totally asynchronous for efficiency, but 
   several easy synchronization methods are available if you need them. 
 - Can also be used for direct client-to-client connections and 
   for making inetd-launched daemons. 

Features of AMarqueed (the AmiTCP server): 

 - Works with AmiTCP, Miami, or any other stack that is "AmiTCP compatible". 
 - Fully multithreaded design, with one server process per connection. 
 - Re-entrant code, to minimize memory usage. 
 - Data is stored in a filesystem-like tree structure for simplicity, 
   flexibility and efficiency.  Each client gets its own "home directory" 
   that it may write to or read from, and each client may also 
   read from the "home directories" of other clients. 
 - Efficient design minimizes CPU usage, net bandwidth, and execution time. 
 - Limits may be put on memory usage, number of connections, and/or  
   which clients or apps may connect.  Only serve the hosts and apps 
   you want to serve! 
 - Supports data streaming to one or many clients at once. 
 - Data streaming and synchronization features let you be sure your  
   data was read by all interested hosts before you update it again. 
 - Automatically detects and eliminates "dead" connections (e.g. 
   if the client computer was shut down without quitting politely) 

The AMarquee package (both amarquee.library and AMarqueed) is available 
on Aminet in the file comm/net/AMarquee1.41.lha.

                             (Released 4/9/97)

QAmiTrack is a remake of AmiTrack, that uses amarquee.library and the
AMarquee server program to provide several new features over the old
version. 

Like the old AmiTrack, QAmiTrack lets you advertise your Amiga's presence
on the 'net, and see who else is on line.  Also like AmiTrack, QAmiTrack
has an ARexx interface and allows you to automatically connect to other
clients using a user-customizable cycle-gadget full of programs. 

Unlike AmiTrack, QAmiTrack does not require you to wait 5 minutes or click
a "refresh" button in order to see updates to the list.  Instead, all
updates to the list are forwarded to your Amiga as soon as they occur. 

Furthermore, QAmiTrack adds the ability to track how long it has been since
an entry has changed, and which users have their QAmiTrack window open.
Each entry in the ListView displays the number of minutes that have elapsed
since the last update to that entry, and users whose QAmiTrack windows are
currently open have a plus sign next to that number.   With this, you
always have a good idea of which computer users are actually looking at
their QAmiTrack window, and which are off doing something else. 

QAmiTrack is available on Aminet, in the file comm/net/QAmiTrack1.80.lha

NOTE:  QAmiTrack requires amarquee.library to be installed 
       in your LIBS: directory.  Amarquee.library is available 
       in the AMarquee distribution archive, in the file 
       /comm/net/AMarquee1.41.lha on Aminet.

DESCRIPTION

  It all began almost an year ago, when for the first time I needed to
  send a  fax...  "Well",  I  said,  "I've  got  a  fax modem,  I  can
  send it from home...".

  Unfortunately I had no fax software:  the  ones  provided  with  the
  modem were just for MS-Dos and Windows, as usual.

  So I started looking around for fax programs  for  my  Amiga:  there
  were only  two   commercial  packages,  but  as  I'm  almost  always
  out-of-money, I thought it was a good idea to look in the  shareware
  before.

  I did, but with no luck: I just saw a couple of programs, one  worst

Amiga show in Sydney

SYDNEY SHOWGROUNDS, AUSTRALIA, JUNE 28, 1997: The first Australian Amiga
show in three years was held at the Sydney showground on the weekend of
June 28 and 29.

Organised by Australian Amiga Gazette, the event attracted 15 exhibitors --
including a school and two user groups -- and about 1000 visitors.

According to one of the show's organisors, Michael Gruber, the show was a
great success:

"Actually the show was a big hit with all the dealers, Power Computing all
the way from the UK was pleased with sales and expressed interest in coming
to the next show," says Gruber.

Gruber also hinted that a similar show may be held in Melbourne in the near
future.

<END>

Well that's my five paragraph summary of AAG '97, but here's what I
actually thought of the show:

Amiga users are decadent and depraved
 
The Amiga is dead in Australia -- well as far as 99.9% of the country is
concerned.  With no real presence in the consumer market -- except for a
few dedicated dealers -- it's hardly surprising that the Amiga is seen as
something of an antique.

But there are true believers left (wild eyed and crazy they may be), as the
Australian Amiga Gathering '97 (AAG '97) proved.

I wasn't sure whether I really wanted to go.  I had planned for my Amiga
CD-ROM company, J P Media, to be there to sell Euro CD2, but in one of
those quirks of fate, the CD-ROMs got lost on their way from the
Netherlands.  As a result, I really had nothing to sell that wouldn't
already be there.  There really was no point in J P Media appearing. 

But I was still curious -- though I work with PCs and Macs, I only have one
computer at home, an Amiga 3000.  I am an Amigan at heart, and wild eyed
and crazy at that.

I parked my van on the street outside the Sydney Showground, just opposite
the front gate.  There were huge signs for a carpet sale, but nothing about
the Amiga.  I asked the female security guard if there was a computer show
on.  She gave me directions to the Kensington Centre.

I followed the directions and found a building with an Amiga banner on the
outside.  Inside were what seemed to be a series of partitioned offices
with people walking around.  This didn't look like any computer show I'd
seen.

The woman at the door just waved me in -- I had expected to pay $10.  I
don't know whether this was because I had arrived so late or what.

I did a quick pass through of the show; it took about five minutes.  There
were over a dozen exhibitors.  Most of them were computer shops selling
bits and pieces.

I decided to do another pass through, and maybe chat to whoever seemed
interesting.

Unicorn Solutions: I'd met a couple of the blokes at Unicorn Solutions --
sort of computer consultants -- a few weeks earlier at a demo party in
Sydney (I'm not really into that scene, but I was interested enough to go
just to see what happened).

Anyway, the guys at Unicorn Solutions were fiddling with their network
while I was speaking to them.  They mentioned that they thought there might
have been around 600 hundred visitors there on Saturday.  They also
expressed disappointment that Megatron (the only Australian distributor of
Amiga) was not there, and also that Phase 5 had not turned up to
demonstrate the PowerPC Power Up cards.  They mentioned that they had quite
a few enquiries about their networking, graphics and video services.

Tech Media: Right next to Unicorn Solutions was Tech Media with a
mean-looking sonnaofbitch Amiga, which I later found out was the Draco.
The guy at the stand was happy to answer all questions and revealed that
Tech Media was the NSW distributor of the $18,000 Draco video editing
system.  Apparently about 35 Draco systems have been sold in Australia,
which according to the Tech Media rep is a large chunk of the market share.

Power Computing: Power Computing came all the way from the UK to be at the
show.  Two guys in suits had a table with a few Amiga peripherals like
Apollo and Blizzard accelerators, and a pile of Big Red Adventure CD-ROMs.

Two user groups were represented: Victorian-based North West Amiga Group
and NSW-based Commodore Hornsby User Group.  Both stands were set up with a
couple of computers that club members were using -- the CHUG computers had
some sort of simple puzzle games running.  It would have been more
interesting to see some real action happening on the Amigas, but it was
nice to see that there were some user groups still operating, and that they
could be bothered to turn up.

St John's Park High School: One quite bizarre stand was St Johns Park High
School, where a number of school kids were mucking around on DPaint and
other programs.  Wow -- Amigas still being used in Australian schools, what
a thought!  Could this be a future generation of Amigans?

Shareware Booth: Before leaving I stopped in at the Shareware booth, where
you could register some well-known shareware on the spot.  A very good
idea, and a great way of avoiding the hassles of overseas bank cheques etc.
I registered Shape Shifter for AUS$50, a fantastic bargain as far as I'm
concerned.  I was told I was the 11th person to register Shape Shifter by
about 4.30 pm -- not a huge number, but at least a bit of extra money for
the author.  Australian Amiga Gazette was also available from this stand
for $3.

Amadeus Computers: This well-known Amiga dealer had a range products for
sale -- including the Digita and Cloanto products it distributes,

Amiga Genius: Showed the Graffiti card and the Siamese System.

Computa Magic: Up from Melbourne, these guys are distributors for DKB,
Golden Image and ProDAD to name a few.

GPSoftware: Surprise, surprise, the makers of Directory Opus, were there
selling Directory Opus, plus their funky T-shirt.

GSoft: Got to see the often-mentioned Micronik Infinity Tower, with A1200
motherboard and Zorro slots.  Software Buyers Service were also represented
on this stand.

Resource Management Force: Fast and big ethernet networks for the Amiga.

Overall impressions: Australian Amiga Gathering '97 was a valiant attempt
to stage an Amiga event in Australia.  While it did not compare in size to
PC shows held in Sydney (not very surprising given the nonexistence of a
consumer market for Amiga computers in Australia) it was great that Amiga
fans finally had some sort of event to attend to celebrate the Amiga.

It should also be mentioned that on the Tuesday before the show, the Sydney
Morning Herald and the Age, two of Australia's most-respected newspapers,
ran sympathetic features about the Amiga that mentioned AAG '97.
Congratulations to the organisers if they were responsible for this

Most of all, it was great to see that there are still Amiga believers out
there. 

Yes the Amiga is down in Australia, but it's not out quite yet.

                      Review: AGA Experience 3 CD-ROM
                             By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Sadeness may be expanding into game publication (watch for the Settler-like
Foundation later this year) but they haven't forgotten what put them on the
global Amiga map in the first place--the AGA Experience CD.  Volume 3 is
here, with a style to match their other recent offerings, and a load of
material useful for AGA and CyberGraphX users.

Whenever someone puts out a general interest CD, it can't help but bear
comparison to an Aminet CD--after all, Aminet CDs are cheap and plentiful
and have a wide assortment.  But each individual CD is a crapshoot, and
just because something isn't released in a 2-month period doesn't mean it's
not useful.  The role of a compilation CD like AGA Experience 3 is to get
together the best and most interesting material over a broader range of
time, to refine the content a bit more thoroughly, and present it well.

The presentation is done through a straightforward HTML interface (demo
AWeb included for the unwashed), with a style very similar (although less
severe) to the Hidden Truth CD, a small sample of which is on the AGA
Experience 3.  There's also a Women of the Web preview section--if AGA
Experiences have made Sadeness famous, WotW has made them infamous.  But
beyond that, you get a healthy assortment of games, demos, and utilities.

The curious part of the way the CD is arranged is that, unlike an Aminet CD
where all files can be accessed through the AmigaGuide interface, you can't
access all of the files through the HTML.  Demos can be interactively run
from the CD, but the Games and Utilities portions of the HTML menu are just
catalogues, and you have to dig through the actual CD to get to them.  It's
a curious difference in style, and one I find somewhat confusing.

For readers who fell behind, there's a licensed batch of Amiga Reports
(4.05 to 5.01 for those of you scoring at home) as well as the first 6
Amiga Monitor magazines.  The Monitor has been around over a year now and
seems to be doing well, my congratulations.

If the Women of the Web pictures don't keep you occupied, there is a small
assortment of pictures, some from demo conferences, others from game
preview screenshots, stored separately.  A select quality batch of mods is
also sorted, and both can be accessed from the HTML document (although I
found that the ClickMe setup program did not properly configure the
external viewer for the pictures in CyberGraphX mode.)

I wouldn't make a big deal out of it if it wasn't a headline item: One of
the people at Sadeness is a big REM fan, and an "REM Guide" is one of the
front-page categories, along with "Demos", "Utilities", etc.  As another
big (albeit disillusioned of late) REM fan, let me just say that I hardly
can agree with the assessment "guide".  Almost two thirds of REM's works
are left out, as the guide only covers REM's Warner label releases.  All I
have to say to that is that Sadeness is better best to rearrange the guide
next time they try to slip it past me.  On the other hand, if you want to
try to figure out what Michael is talking about in Monster or want to study
Losing My Religion until the sun comes up, you'll be happy.  There's also a
small collection of articles about REM, although I strongly advise against
reading any article about REM, particularly if it quotes a band member.
Celebrities and artists tend to be inconsistent and flighty people in
interviews, and REM, Stipe in particular, has taken it to an art form.
There's a negative review of REM's latest album which I pretty heartily
agree with, though.

(The above is what a lot of people might consider "irrelevant rambling in
the middle of the review."  But Sadeness made such a point of including the
REM guide...)

Overall, I'm very impressed by the care in which this compilation was done.
Most everything is ready to run so there's not the sheer bulk of material
some CDs have, not much is compressed to save space.  But what the CD does
have (including a well-stocked emulator section!  Nice work!) is worth
having, and that's the point of the AGA Experience CDs.  There's not as
much of a focus on pictures and images as there has been in the past, but
the large collection of AGA demos makes up for it.  I had some trouble
getting certain demos to run properly from the HTML document (the link was
apparently invalid), but the demos all have indicators of their system
requirements and dislikes.

Sadeness fulfilled the roles they needed AGA Experience 3 to fill rather
well.

===========================================================================
                           Review: Aminet 19 CD
                             By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Hey!  Aminet's almost old enough to drink in the US!

The nineteenth installment of the Aminet CD series has arrived.  There's
some pleasant and not-so-pleasant surprises on the ubiquitous little
silvery disc this time around.

Just for starters: Urban Mueller declares that Aminet is growing too fast
for the bimonthly CDs to keep up.  Terrific news, eh?  The commercial
software is also going to raise some eyebrows--AmiAtlas (German only, for
Germany) and, more importantly, CanDo 2.5.  Not only was it surprising
because I had thought Inovatronics was completely gone--not so, the German
branch is apparently still active--but now I know where to point the people
who over the past two years have asked me how they can get CanDo.

There's also apparently going to be a new Aminet Set coming--Urban alludes
to it by saying that some of the new material which couldn't make it onto
Aminet 19 will be there, but there are no additional details.

The not-so-good part of this is that Aminet's vastly inflated size of late
is largely due to a massive influx of mods and pictures.  On this CD in
particular, content in the mods and pix directories account for 388 of the
CD's 927 (compressed) megs, or over 40%.  The demo directory is close
behind, BTW, and including it makes these three categories most of the CD.
I don't have a problem with this in and of itself, since it's what Amiga
users are putting on Aminet.  But Aminet has come under fire lately for
this sort of expansion (pictures and mods) which some people see as "less
valid" than the contribution of software to the archives, and unfortunately
the makeup of this CD won't serve to deter them much.

Personally, I think that asking that anything be restricted from Aminet
(other than the real obvious ones, like non-Amiga software except in very
special cases and all pirated/commercial software) is asking for trouble.
Aminet is supposed to be a great public project, not a high-maintenance
filter.  We all have our peeves and our "Boy, I don't know why in the world
they allow THAT on Aminet", but as I benefit a great deal from Aminet, both
as a user and as someone who relies on Aminet to distribute a product, I'm
not about to tell someone else how they should run it.

As for using the CD: well, let's face it, the familiar AmigaGuide interface
is here, it's here to stay, short of a catastrophic worldwide failure of
the amigaguide.library, it's not going anywhere soon.  (Put that in the
"famous last words" column if Aminet 20 or 21 comes out with a totally new
interface!)  No new surprises, it's the familiar setup.

If you think I was a bit hard on the pictures and mods, just keep in mind
that the mods section of the Aminet CDs is typically one of my favorites.
I find that, in terms of downloading mods, I don't usually get enough
enjoyment out of what I download to justify the time and the storage.  But
getting them all on a CD, with an easy to use menu and shuffle button,
makes it worth my time listening to, even if all I have right now IS the
tinny little A4000T internal speaker.

Unfortunately, and Mueller blames it on the massive amounts of new stuff as
well as on what got left out, there's no "new" index to scan through, you
have to use the main CD index.  Not a total catastrophe, but it's something
that's missing.

The last two CDs have been sufficiently packed that Aminet CDs no longer
are "The newest and all of the <blank>" (mods, pictures, games, etc), they
are simply the newest.

It's still the be-all end-all of Amiga CDs.

===========================================================================
                         Review: The Hidden Truth
                             By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

They say that "alien fever" is at an all-time high in the US and around the
world, due in large part to the 50th anniversary of the Roswell "UFO
Sighting."  (When you're talking about something like the Hidden Truth and
the contents on it, it's hard to avoid lots of quotation marks, because the
whole point is that nobody quite knows what's REALLY going on.)  This
surprises me to some degree since, after all, with the exception of Babylon
5 there's not much good science fiction on TV, and film's offerings have
been poor as well.

But that's the fact, so we're hearing, alien fever has gripped the world.
Conspiracy theorists are at their wildest.  And what better way to spend an
afternoon than picking through the archives of the paranormal?

The Hidden Truth is a multiplatform compilation from Sadeness Software, who
put themselves on the map with the very well received AGA Experience CD
series.  Sadeness has done the very obvious and intelligent thing in
assembling this CD: they've done it in HTML.  It makes it very easily
cross-platform (all they need to do is give everyone a browser: for Amiga
users, a demo version of AWeb is included.  PC and Mac users get IE), and
allows for an attractive layout if you know what you're doing--and enough
work has gone into the CD to make it attractively laid out if nothing else.
(One minor complaint is that Sadeness self-consciously used animated GIFs
and tell Amiga users they'll need to use their own browser if they want to
see them.)

The HTML layout uses what I can only call the "non-frame approach to
frames".  If you've been on the Amiga Web Directory lately, you know what I
mean.  You can typically go to any major section of the CD (UFOs,
Paranormal, Science Fiction, Government Coverups, Human Curiosities, and
Space) from any other major section.

Discussion of UFOs is the headline feature on the disc, and there's loads
of it.  From long-winded "proofs" of their existence to galleries of photos
and video clips (unfortunately, these are mostly in the poor quality AVI
format), there's enough to give you the chills--or set you to laughing,
depending on your disposition to the topic.  The quality varies
wildly--some pages are put together by Sadeness from existing material,
others are merely snapshots of WWW pages run by other people.  

The Science Fiction page is far more dedicated to the "Science Horror"
subgenre than to general SF.  "Alien" is of course heavily featured, as are
other H.R. Giger disturb-out pictures.  X-Files fans are catered to as
well, but the bottom line is that if you're looking for a catalogue of the
aliens in Star Trek or Babylon 5, you've got the wrong CD.  I guess those
shows aren't as interesting to the hard-core conspiracy theorists...

The Paranormal section is the freakier side of the CD, with some
information on spontaneous human combustion, voodoo, and witchcraft.
I noticed a bit of sloppiness on Sadeness' part here--they included an HTML
page from a site which was simply a "We've moved, update your bookmark or
wait 10 seconds" page--and the kicker is that the auto-load doesn't
reference the page properly!

Crop circles, ghosts, the pyramids, and Nostradamus get their day as well.
Of some interest is the "Skeptic's Dictionary", which if you've made it
this far through the CD and are shaking your head in disbelief is a
must-see.

Some of the web sites pulled for this CD seem to have been done so in a
very casual manner.  Others, like the VJ Enterprises page, even have a
special Hidden Truth introduction specifically for the CD.  (VJ is a sort
of UFO/paranormal clearinghouse with a new age/spiritual slant).

If you're one of the few people who thinks Noam Chomsky has anything
interesting to say, the page which covers his "Secret History of the United
States" is of particular interest.  While some of the things border on the
fantastic-but-probably-true (governments and militaries do terrible things,
even in peacetime, and I have no illusions about that), others are simply
repetitions of things which are clearly true and happen all around us,
every day.  It's hardly a "conspiracy" when Ford won't recall the Pinto
because it's cheaper to pay lawsuits than fix the cars.  Actuaries are all
around us.  (Hey, now THERE'S an idea for a conspiracy page!)

Britain gets the once-over as well.  MI5, MI6, and other quasi-official
organizations of the UK are explained on a companion page.  But for
whatever reason, by and large the CD deals with loads of USA coverups.  (I
guess Doctor Who WAS wrong--alien invasions don't start in London after
all.)

The Space pages are by and large unchallengably legitimate, with resources
and data most sane people accept as factual (data on the nine planets and
their moons, footage from official space agencies like NASA, etc.)  Too bad
Hidden Truth missed the Mars Pathfinder boat...maybe if there's a release
2.

Sadeness has done a very good job putting everything together.  The
original graphical work they did is excellent, and the .WAV files that play
on the major pages are very appropriate and atmospheric.  The CD isn't real
cheap (UKP 30 recommended price), so I couldn't recommend it as a casual
purchase over a new Aminet CD or even Sadeness' AGA Experience 3, but if
this sort of thing intrigues you at all and you want a one-stop resource,
The Hidden Truth is a good buy.

@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                    Review: Nemac IV Director's Cut CD
                           By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

Nemac IV was a Doom-like game whose existence got somewhat drowned out in
the midst of the Alien Breed 3D 1 and 2 excitement.  The game, from Zentek
of Germany, has a lot going for it that AB3D didn't (CyberGraphX support,
for starters) and is worth a look even now.

Nemac is very tolerant of a wide range of Amigas.  ECS, AGA, and
CyberGraphX are supported.  There's even a Graffiti mode.  An 020 is
mandatory, an 060 is rewarding.

The plot--well, plot, schmot.  You do seem to be a large battle-mech sort
of thing with a vast arsenal at your disposal.  Unlike most other games in
this vein where you "find" advanced weapons, in Nemac you come ready to
shoot the bad guys with various types of guns.  You of course have to keep
stocked with ammo along the way, but the advantage to this system is that
all of your weapons are available all of the time.  Most of your enemies
will be mechanical in nature as well--all of Nemac has a very polished,
spaceship feel, although you're really sealed in a large bunker with a mad
supercomputer that must be stopped.

There's even support for the I-Glasses, for those of you who were too
compelled by Escom's efforts to sell them to you.

The CD comes with a variety of 3D animations, which really give you a sense
of mood and location.  A lot of these Doom clones have failed to establish
atmosphere.  The main game of Nemac is not quite enough to generate this
sort of atmosphere, so luckily the animations do the trick.  (The corridors
are just a bit too wide, the ceiling and floor textures just a bit too
painted in nature.)

Did I say ceiling and floor textures?  Yep.  The game allows for full
texturing, which can be toggled off and on as you play.  The game window is
also very sizable, and you choose which screenmode you'll be using in the
main startup configuration window.

The game has a good balance of "shoot your way through enemies to reach the
exit" and "find the keys to open doors", without getting too wrapped up in
complex maps early on.  There's something of a break with tradition--doors
open automatically when you touch them, rather than requiring a tap on the
space bar.  Some, but not all, devices you can activate rely on a space bar
hit.  (There's an odd but useful twist--if you shoot or blow up something,
it activates it, which is how you can get keys from rooms you can't fit
into.)

Installation to hard drive is easy and relatively painless.  The game
installs about 4 megs onto a directory, and requires that you play with the
Nemac CD in the drive.

There's a neat feature built-in to the game--you can take screenshots with
the touch of a key, provided you activated the option when you started up.

Control in Nemac is easy--shooting is not always so.  You may find it
difficult to draw a bead on your enemies, and they typically shoot at you
with great speed and little warning, so you have to be quick with the
strafe key.  Grenades are very effective, but also very scarce, so be
careful.

There are three difficulty levels, and the introductory level should keep
you occupied for quite some time.

Nemac uses a "heads-up" approach to weapons and health status, which
despite its large font is surprisingly unobtrusive.  A very good job on
Zentek's part.

The Draco is even supported, although no audio is available.  Nemac was
written before AHI, although my gut tells me that had AHI been around the
support would have been there.  At least CyberGraphX works beautifully, 3D
animations and all.

Nemac has by far the best presentation of all of the Doom-type games I've
played on the Amiga.  It doesn't have the brutal charm of Gloom or the
well-established environment of Alien Breed, however, and the fact that
you're supposed to be controlling your battle pod by remote control does
make you feel very detached from the action.

In all, I was suitably impressed with Nemac IV.  It doesn't have the same
excitement of most of the other games in its genre, but its graphical
capabilities are second to none on the Amiga, and is worth checking out.

Developed and published by Zentek.

             Emulation Rambler: PC-Task 4.2 and PCx 1.1 Review
                           By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON}
===========================================================================

They're both the results of years of development.  PC-Task's Chris Hames
has been working to perfect PC emulation on the Amiga since the first
shareware release of PC-Task, some five years ago.  Back then, he made the
other offerings (the very early Transformer, and IBeM, later CrossPC) look
silly.  PC-Task 1 and 2 were no great shakes, though.

When Emplant got PC capability, finally, some people were disappointed that
it didn't seem to deliver a whole lot of power.  The same went for PC-Task
3, which was an improvement on the old design and had better graphical
capabilities than the predecessors, but wasn't outstanding.

Now PC-Task 4.2 and Emplant PC's successor, PCx, are out.  PC-Task boasts
486 and FPU processor emulation (the FPU support is new to 4.2), while PCx
is Pentium/586 compatible, FPU inclusive.  Both can support VGA-style modes
in addition to the older fallback graphical setups.  PC-Task can promote
any of its screens to a display database-compliant system (CyberGraphX
highly recommended), while PCx can presently only put VGA 320x200x256 on a
CyberGraphX screen, the others use ECS/AGA.  PC-Task has more expansive
graphical options, allowing you to place the emulation on a Workbench
window and offering frameskip features (for added speed).

The reasons for wanting or needing PC emulation are legion.  Everyone can
probably come up with something.  So here's a quick list of reasons you can
eliminate from your list right away.

If you want to:

 - Run Windows 95
 - Play Duke/Quake with your buddies, or most any commercial PC game

You should probably not bother.  Because of the limitations in speed we all
face, with a functional maximum of an 060 right now, getting the 486DX4 or
Pentium performance levels is just not feasible.

On the other hand, if you need to run Windows 3.1 and don't mind the sort
of performance 386es are getting, and you have a fast Amiga, you could be
in business.  I personally just spent part of an afternoon helping a friend
configure a large Word document table on a 386/20 running Win 3.1.  It's
slow, but doable.  If you're going into PC emulation with that sort of
expectation, and have the 060 to back it up, you'll be fine.

Personally, what I typically do with PC emulation is play classic PC games.
They're very abundant, and are quite often games that never made it to the
Amiga.  My standby is Wasteland (which if you read my last round of PC
emulation reviews you've already heard too much about), but there are a
number of game packs out there for the PC.  You can pick up a handful of
classic titles on CD-ROM for very cheap.  (My most recent project has been
to get Pizza Tycoon to run on either emulator, but I've been stymied so
far.)  The SSI AD&D games are another good example of games you might
consider picking up for the PC for a song.

The emulations of the PC by both PC-Task and PCx are impressively thorough.
Both can use the emm386 memory manager (although for speed reasons it's
discouraged), both offer the ability to use large amounts of the Amiga's
memory (PCx requires that it be from a single contiguous block, PC-Task can
mix memory), and both support serial/parallel/hard drive/floppy and CD-ROM
access.

This brings up an important point.  If you're going to be serious about
emulating a PC (or a Mac, for that matter), you should really have a CD-ROM
drive or a high-density floppy.  Preferably both.  You're going to have
massive headaches if you don't.

Hard drives are handled by both emulators in similar ways.  Both support
"hardfiles", which first became popular with PC-Task and later with Mac
emulators.  Hardfiles are inefficient but useful-in-a-pinch ways to set up
hard drive compatibility--they're large AmigaDOS files which the program
treats as a physical device.  PC-Task and PCx also support real, dedicated
partitions, a much better choice.  Unfortunately, they do not share
formats, and PCx's is a custom filesystem, as opposed to a CrossDOS
filesystem as PC-Task uses.

The CD-ROM compatibilities are not equal.  PC-Task has a decided edge.
Very often, a CD would be recognized perfectly by the AmigaOS and by
PC-Task but PCx would refuse to read it.  This frustration is compounded by
another advantage PC-Task has over PCx: the ability to copy between PC and
Amiga drives at the PC prompt using special tools included with the
emulator.  That means if you can't read a CD on the PCx side, you're stuck
using clunky floppies to transfer data across.

Both offer sound emulation of the PC speaker.  PCx goes further to
implement a partial SoundBlaster emulation.  It's an improvement, and will
be nicer when it's complete.  Both also support mice, and the ease of use
of the mouse drivers is improving.

In terms of compatibility, the major differences in compatibility come in
identifying their graphical capabilities to programs.  Modern PC programs
should have no trouble, but older programs which hit hardware may get
confused.  The King's Quest games are not fully compatible on either
emulator, for example.  But on the processor level, both emulators are very
well set up for what they're doing.

Both rely on "CPU Transcription" or "Dynamic Transcription" to work their
magic.  The technicalities are beyond my ability to explain them, but in
short, rather then simply interpreting each PC instruction into an Amiga
instruction and back again as it comes, both emulators can pre-interpret
the code for faster performance down the line.  In PCx, this involves
configuring the transcription cache with up to 1 meg of memory.  In
PC-Task, you run the PC-Task Dynamic executable instead of PC-Task
Interpretive.  PC-Task Dynamic lets you select a buffer size, from "Tiny"
to "Huge".  The buffer is set up relative to the memory the PC side is
using, with Huge creating a buffer many times larger than the PC's memory
(and thus limiting your emulation options.)  Having a lot of memory is also
a very good idea for emulation.

Benchmarks are never reliable for emulation.  I conducted tests that were
not used by either company for advertising purposes, using the Bytemark V2
software in 32-bit mode.  Unfortunately, the results are more indicative of
how you CAN'T rely on statistics alone.  The results indicate that PC-Task
is far, far faster than PCx, and that's just not the case.  In fact, PCx
has surprised me in actually being faster than PC-Task, when PCx was
running a game on an AGA screen and PC-Task ran the same on either an AGA
or CGX screen.  These results came using a Large transcription buffer for
PC-Task and the full 1 meg buffer in PCx.  (The poorly documented Turbo
option of PCx was used but to no effect on the performance scores.)

A rather crude benchmark program, CI, returned that PCx (in 1 meg
transcription mode) resembled a 27.2 Mhz 386 on my system, while PC-Task
looked more like a 39.9 Mhz 386.  The performance is based on the
CyberStorm Mark II 060 card.  These numbers should be considered suspect.

I tried a more real-world benchmark involving processing and disk I/O (the
sorts of things you'd be doing in using a computer)  Zipping the DOS 4 GW
executable yielded a surprise.  PCx, which as I previously mentioned is
often faster in the real world, was far slower than PC-Task.  PC-Task in
Dynamic mode with a Large buffer buttoned up the file in a mere 7.84
seconds.  PCx took 33.82 seconds, just slightly faster than the PC-Task
Interpretive (no cache) speed of 33.93 seconds.  By contrast, a real-world
Pentium 100 is more than twice as fast as the PC-Task result.

PCx has a nice "hard reboot" option which PC-Task is lacking, and it's come
in handy more than once.

PCx is somewhat cheaper than PC-Task--about US$20.  And you do get a lot of
emulator.  On the other hand, PC-Task 4.2 has the look and feel of a more
complete product.  The CyberGraphX support is wholehearted, the CD-ROM
driver works better, and the hard drive integration with the Amiga is much
better.  At present, I still have to recommend PC-Task over PCx, but it's
very close, and is not the best solution in ALL situations.  For most
things, however, I think PC-Task is presently the way to go.

                        Amiga Report Mailing List
===========================================================================

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to majordomo@ninemoons.com

Your subject header will be ignored.  In the body of the message, enter

subscribe areport

The system will automatically pull your e-mail address from the message
header.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!             **

                          UUDecoding Amiga Report
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

                      Amiga Report Writing Guidelines
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

     4.  Please send us your article in ASCII format.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.

Please stipulate as well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to
the editor.

                    CalWeb: The Home of the Amiga Zone!
===========================================================================

AMIGA ZONE MOVES TO CALWEB!

THE AMIGA ZONE MOVES FROM PORTAL TO CALWEB INTERNET SERVICES

For over ten years the Amiga Zone has been an online resource, home,
community, oasis, for Amiga owners.

For over ten years I've made my living running the Zone and supporting Amiga
users all over the USA, Canada, and the world.

Five years ago when American People/Link pulled their own plug, we had to
find the Zone a new home and we found a good one on the Portal Online
System. 

Well, it's happened again.. Portal has informed all of its customers that
its ten year history as an online service and Internet provider is coming to
an end on Sept. 30, 1996.  This is very sad, it's short-notice, and the
decision is completely out of my control, but it's also irreversible.  

Portal is changing its entire business plan from being an ISP to selling an
accounting system to other online services.  

So be it. It's sad, but like I said, the Zone went through this before and
now we'll go through it again, and come out the other side better and wiser.

THE AMIGA ZONE IS MOVING TO CALWEB INTERNET SERVICES.

CalWeb (http://www.calweb.com) is a two year old Internet provider located
in Sacramento, CA.  It has a good sized customer base, and very
knowledgeable support staff. 

It's also run by a long time Amiga owner who has been a friend of mine for
many years.

The world of modeming has changed much in the last ten years.  In 1985 you
had very few choices and you had 1200 baud.  These days, everyone and his
dog has an ISP running and a web page

But the vast majority of those providers don't know an Amiga from a hole in
the ground, and could care less about Amiga owners.  Say "AWeb" or
"IBrowse" to them and they'll say "Omega?  Amoeba?  What?  Huh?  They still
make those things?"

CalWeb is different because it's the new home of the Amiga Zone.

In October 1996, a new custom front-end menued system will be added to
CalWeb to host the Zone.  It'll have features for Zone users that neither
Plink nor Portal ever had nor were they willing to add.

The tradition of a friendly online Amiga community, run by long time Amiga
owners, users and lovers will continue. 

Message bases, huge file libraries (we plan to move over the 20,000+ files
we have on the Zone on Portal to CalWeb, MANY of which you'll never see on
Aminet or anywhere else), live nightly chats, vendor support and our famous
prize contests will continue.

We've given away tens of thousands of dollars worth of Amiga prizes in the
last ten years.  No one else even comes close. 

I urge any and all of you who were on Plink, or who are now on Portal or
who may have left Portal..  or even if you were never on either but used or
still use another online service to join CalWeb for the Amiga Zone.  I
personally promise you the best online Amiga community we can possibly
build.  You will not be disappointed.


CalWeb has arranged a special signup offer for you!

Call:
 1-800-509-9322
  or
 1-916-641-9320
  or telnet to calweb.com, login as "guest", and follow the prompts. 

You can join CalWeb for US$19.95 flat, a month.

CalWeb takes major credit cards or you can establish a monthly invoiced
account if you don't have plastic.

The signup is FREE.

To get this deal you must say "THE AMIGA ZONE SENT ME" when you call or
signup online. 

I hope to see lots of you join CalWeb.  You can telnet into it from
anywhere for no hourly charges at all.  Your $19.95/mo fee covers
everything and also gets you ten meg of storage which includes hosting your
own personal web page.  Naturally, when the Zone opens there, you'll have
unlimited use of all of its features and areas.  Never a "money meter"
clock to worry about.

Your personal or business CalWeb Web pages are maintained by you via FTP. 
It's pretty slick.  You can make a net connection to the server with any
Amiga FTP client, put your files onto it, the permissions are automatically
set (no "chmod-ing" required!) and flip to your running browser and see the
changes instantly.

The Amiga Zone's new home is already up at:

         http://www.amigazone.com

running on CalWeb's server.  Ckeck it out!

Please feel free to write to me at harv@amigazone.com or harv@cup.portal.com
if you want more information.

Remember to say "THE AMIGA ZONE SENT ME!" when you join.

A splendid time is guaranteed for all.  

Please plan to join us in the Amiga Zone on CalWeb!
