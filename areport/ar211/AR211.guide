It's spring!! Well maybe someone should tell the weather that, eh?

It looks like there's some changes going on. Six employees from NewTek
have left and have started a venture of their own. Look for some info
about that in Amiga News. I'm interested in seeing what that brings.
Even Kiki went with them.

Everyone's getting anxious to see the AAA computers. Talk about the AAA
is coming from every corner of the Amiga community. All I can say is that
I hope that we'll be able to see it. But like with everything, it will
be totally dependant on CBM's marketing ...or as CBM employees say,
"Commodore has marketing?" 

I haven't seen any advertisements for the CD32 in the U.S. Has anyone
else out there?

Last week I had an article called "Amiga Blues". Due to problems we
were not able to give him proper credit...well, he contacted me (thanks!)
and Brad Hansen (100024.3556@CompuServe.COM) is the author. 

Thanks to all of you who have been submitting articles or tid-bits of
news.

Speaking of which, I hear that CBM's 1-800 line has been disconnected.
Anyone hear why?

OK, it's time for me to grab the fishing pole, and for you to enjoy
Amiga Report. 

Enjoy!

New SupraFAXModem(tm) 288 Offers V.Fast Speeds for Under $400
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ALBANY, OR, FEBRUARY 1994 - The SupraFAXModem 288 raises the 
standard on performance with data speeds of 28,800 bps while 
maintaining Supra's commitment to value-oriented pricing.  
Scheduled to ship in March, the external model will carry a 
selling price of $399 while the internal SupraFAXModem(tm) 288i 
will debut at just $349.

"These products represent a huge leap forward in technology," 
said Kenny Richards, Manager for PC products at Supra. "Not only 
can users benefit from speed that's twice as fast as the current 
V.32bis standard, they also get the benefits of an outstanding 
feature set at an unbelievable price."

Based on the Rockwell(tm) V.FC (V.Fast Class) chipset, Supra's 
new modems utilize the core technology that is expected to be 
defined by the ITU-TSS in the V.34 (V.Fast) standard later this 
year.  When the V.34 standard is finalized, it will be 
incorporated into the full line of SupraFAXModem 288 products.  
In the interim, V.FC appears to be the clear leader as a standard 
for 28,800 bps data communication.  Wide-spread acceptance of the 
V.FC standard will ensure compatibility with modems from more 
than 60 other vendors, including Hayes, Microcom, and US 
Robotics.

By contrast, the V.32terbo standard, which is accepted by a 
smaller number of modem manufacturers, can go no faster than 
19,200 bps. And despite the fact that these modems are half as 
fast as Supra's 288 products, they do not offer a competitive 
price advantage.


True Top-Of-The-Line Technology

Both Supra's internal and external modems offer technology that 
goes beyond the basics of V.FC technology.  By utilizing flash 
ROM, both of these V.Fast Class products add a new level of 
flexibility to modem communications. Future enhancements can be 
made without any hardware adjustments - just download the new 
code information into the ROM.

Plus, the SupraFAXModem 288i utilizes SupraSmart(tm) UART 
technology buffering to reduce the risk of data loss during high 
speed transmission.  This includes 16550 UART emulation which, 
combined with V.42bis compression, enables data speeds of up to 
115,200 bps.  The product also includes a Windows driver with 
RHSI (Rockwell High-Speed Interface) which increases the 
throughput capabilities.

The SupraFAXModem 288 external, packs this performance into 
Supra's highly-praised tiny desktop modem with a revolutionary 
alphanumeric status display which makes it a breeze ti track all 
modem activity,  It also includes a hardware handshaking cable 
that enables up to 115,200 bps communication on computers 
equipped with a 16550 UART.

Both modems also include custom Supra features such as Silent 
Answer(tm) which allows both voice and fax communication on a 
single phone line. If it detects fax "CNG" tones, the modem 
routes the call to fax software.  Otherwise, the modem sits 
silently on the phone line while the call is answered by the user 
or by an answering machine.  Another feature, Caller ID, lets 
users identify incoming calls before answering.


Full-Featured Functionality

Both modems support industry standard protocols including the 
full range of Bell, MNP, and ITU-TSS (formerly CCITT) standards.  
Among the supported features are MNP10 for improved performance 
on cellular connections. Both modems support the highest-
available fax speed of 14,400 bps.  They also support Class 1 and 
2 fax commands and are compatible with Group 3 fax machines.

The modems also feature a five-year warranty, Hayes 
compatibility, extended AT commands and result codes, 
compatibility with most popular telecommunications software, 
autoanswer/autodial, a modular phone jack, and non-volatile 
memory that stores two user configurations and four phone 
numbers.

Both the desktop faxmodem and internal card include all software, 
cables and instructions the user needs for getting started with 
high-speed data and fax communication. The bundle includes 
FaxTalk(r) for Windows for flawless fax transmission, Compuserve 
Information Manager(tm) for Windows, and COMit(tm) for DOS and 
Windows - a data communication program designed specifically for 
high-speed communication.

For Macintosh owners, Supra offers the SupraFAXModem 288 Mac 
package for desktop users and the SupraFAXModem 288PB an internal 
modem for PowerBook models 100-180c. Both packages include all 
the software, cables and instructions the user needs for getting 
started with high-speed data and fax communication.  The bundle 
includes MicroPhone(tm) LT, Compuserve Information Manager(tm), 
and the CCL scripts required for Apple Remote Access(tm). 
Packages also include FAXcilitate(tm), fax software that brings a 
new level of flexibility and ease-of-use to Macintosh faxing.

NEWTEK, INC ANNOUNCES SCREAMERNET RENDERING SOFTWARE FOR
LIGHTWAVE 3D PROFESSIONALS

Las Vegas, March 20, 1994 - NewTek, Inc., the company that brought
professional video and animation production to the masses with the
Video Toaster introduces ScreamerNet for LightWave 3D users.

ScreamerNet is the evolution of the Screamer rendering hardware
announced last August. "As we pursued development of the Screamer
hardware it became evident that high speed processors were
quickly becoming commodity items," said NewTek President Tim
Jenison.  "Rather than NewTek trying to keep up with the 
hardware wars we decided to release software that will allow
LightWave users to select the rendering machine of their
choice."

ScreamerNet is a rendering software package that allows LightWave 3D
users to take advantage of the rendering power offered by
workstations from a variety of vendors.  The software is Windows NT
compatible and will support hardware that utilizes Intel, MIPS, and
DEC Alpha processor chips.  ScreamerNet's suggested retail price is
$1995 and will support up to eight machines.

LightWave 3D has become the animation package of choice for most
of the cutting edge action shows in Hollywood," stated Jenison.
"Television programs such as seaQuest DSV, Star Trek: The 
Next Generation, Babylon 5 and RoboCop are using the Video
Toaster and LightWave 3D to push the envelope of visual effects.
With the introduction of ScreamerNet they will have access to
the rendering power they need to completely redefine the
standards for effects in television and film production."

"As the makers of revolutionary products like Video Toaster
and the new Video Toaster Flyer, NewTek means high technology
at an unbelievably low price point," said NewTek's Marketing
Director Donetta Colboch.  "While ScreamerNet represents a
dramatic breakthrough in 3D rendering price/performance, it's
designed and priced for the professional animation facility."

NewTek will be showcasing the ScreamerNet software at the 
National Association of Broadcasters Convention, March 21-24
in Booth #11050.

NEWTEK STUNS NAB WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE VIDEO TOASTER FLYER
TAPELESS EDITING SYSTEM

Las Vegas, March 20, 1994 - NewTek, Inc., the pioneers of the desktop
video industry, announce the Video Toaster Flyer, the first D2 quality
tapeless editing system.  With the Flyer priced at $3995, NewTek once
again shatters the price/performance standards for broadcast
quality video production just as they did with the release of the
Video Toaster in 1990.

"When we originally conceived the idea for the Video Toaster it was
to provide all the tools necessary to create broadcast quality
television at a price almost anyone could afford." said Tim
Jenison, NewTek President.  "With the introduction of the
Video Toaster Flyer we have made the tools even more accessible,
reducing the cost of production by an order of magnitude."

The Video Toaster Flyer is the result of more than seven years of
intense research and development.  The Video Toaster Flyer
offers D2 quality video and CD quality audio editing in a tapeless, non-
linear environment.  The Video Toaster Flyer tapeless editor 
allows the user to dial in the video quality, up to lossless
D2 quality.  All video data is stored on computer hard drives
that allow the user to access particular segments instantaneously
without having to shuttle from one point to another as in 
traditional tape editing.  The system employs an easy to use, drag and
drop storyboard interface.

The breakthrough technology in the Video Toaster Flyer is NewTek's
revolutionary new VTASC compression algorithm.  VTASC sets a
new standard for hard disk based video compresson by combining
D2, broadcast quality video with unprecedented compression ratios.
NewTek is currently in discussion with a number of vendors looking
to license VTASC and Video Toaster Flyer technology.

The Video Toaster Flyer continues NewTek's tradition of providing
easy to use, broadcast quality video production tools, at
unbelivevably low prices.. The complete Video Toaster Flyer
system provides the ability to incorporate all of the tools from
the Video Toaster; digital video effects, paint graphics,
titles and animations directly into productions edited from one 
simple interface.  For Toaster LightWave 3D users, the tapeless
editor will allow the blending of moving video easily and 
seamlessly into animated video prouctions.

NewTek will be demonstrating the Video Toaster Flyer at the
National Association of Broadcasters Convention, March 21-24
in Booth #11050.

EX-NEWTEK EMPLOYEES ANNOUNCE "PLAY"

San Francisco, CA - Former NewTek senior staff members who left the Kansas
company earlier this year have ended industry speculation by unveiling their 
new venture, 'PLAY'. "Launching the Video Toaster and with it the desktop
video industry over the last seven years was a fantastic adventure," 
commented PLAY President Paul Montgomery, "Along the way we discovered 
some very compelling opportunities that went beyond one technology or 
even one platform. PLAY was formed to take advantage of those 
opportunities." The company, which consists primarily of Californians who
relocated to Kansas to build NewTek, is based in San Francisco.
 
"In the mid-eighties NewTek Vice-President and visionary Paul Montgomery
assembled a very unique team from around the world." said Tom Egan, senior
editor for Channel 4000, the leading desktop video news service. "With 
their accomplishments in building this industry at NewTek, they're my 
pick for the 'desktop video Dream Team'. I'm expecting a lot from this 
group." PLAY features Emmy-award winning members of the Video Toaster 
R & D team, including NewTek's former Head of Softwawre Development, 
Steve Hartford, video hardware and software guru, Ken Turcotte, and 
Toaster hardware design engineer, Brad Carvey. Other PLAY founders 
include NewTek's former Director of Marketing, Mark Randall, plus 
Product Development Manager and Hollywood technology pioneer, Daniel 
Kaye. Rounding out the PLAY executive team is a face known to millions, 
Kiki Stockhammer, the video industry's well-known celebrity spokesperson.
 
PLAY will announce it's first strategic relationship at a special event 
on Sunday, March 20th at 7:00 P.M. in the Julius Room of Caesars Palace, 
Las Vegas. "We feel the 'information superhighway' and desktop video are
desinted to collide sooner than anyone thinks" said Montgomery, "PLAY and
our new partner Private Channels are perfectly positioned to provide the
technology, content and distribution needed to realize the dream of
'video-on-demand'."

**** Commodore ???? Brrrrrr !!!! ****


I'm  a  fanatic  Amiga  user  for about 4 years now.  To me there is no
other  computer  half  as  good as the Amiga.  BUT there is something I
really don't like about it. Commodore !  Why ??? Read on and wheep B^(

In  all magazines you can find articles about how good C= is, but every
time  I read such an article I start to shiver.  I have some really bad
memories of C= and Amiga.  It all started when I bought my first one.

ACT 1:

After a lot of visits to a local computershop I finally decided to sell
my  trusty C64 (The only thing C= really did right !) and buy an Amiga.
I got a great deal and took my A500 home.  I got some software to start
from  a  friend  (yes  illegal, but it is nice to have some software to
start  with)  and started playing.  Untill...  I coded a lot on the C64
so  I  was  determend to continue on the Amiga and got Seka.  Very nice
except  when the ESC key and some others don't work.  Back to the shop.
Fortunately for me they knew that sending the computer to C= would take
ages to be fixed, so they gave me a new Amiga.

ACT 2:

After some coding (yes, not programming B^)) and stuff I decided to try
out music aswell.  So offcourse Noisetracker (and later Protracker) was
the logical start.  (Here it comes again) Untill...  After some time my
screen  started  acting weird.  It became smaller for a few seconds and
then  returned  to  normal.  At first I thought some virus got my Amiga
but  as  it kept coming back later, even after a viruschecker had wiped
out  every  bit  of ugly routines on my disks, I knew it was a hardware
problem.   So, still in my warrenty period, I went back to the shop and
got a replacement monitor.  And I was happy again...

ACT 3:

BAFFF !!!  Hey, where's my AsmOne screen ????   My  Amiga  lay there...
dead.   My  powersupply  decided to  quit on me.  And  offcourse I  was
furious,  because it happened  just after my warrenty period ended. B^(
But  I  went  to  the shop ( it was called The Shop, funny isn't it ? )
and asked them what to do.  As my warrenty ended (1 month) I had to buy
a  new supply and they recommended that I should buy one from them so I
could  get  their  warrenty-service...   But their supplies where a lot
more  expensive than the usual but not better.  Luckily there was a big
computerfair where I could buy a heavyduty supply for less than the one
I  could  buy  in  the  shop.  So that story has a good end, but what I
don't get is how a supply could possibly die with just an A500 with 0.5
chip, 0.5 fast and an external drive (Cumana, which is very good).

ACT 4:

Well,  not  much  to  say.  Just read ACT 2 again.  My monitor does the
strangest  things  when  turned on.  After a minute orso it startes its
showbizz again for a couple of minutes and then returns to normal.  You
know,  I'm  still  using the same monitor now, but as I haven't got the
money to buy a decent multisync I'll just have to bear it (for the rest
of my life ????).

ACT 5:

Finally  some  good things happen.  Everything I bought worked !  A 2MB
memory  kit  for  1.0 chip and 1.5 fast, an IDE HD-controller, Digiview
and  lots of software.  And you know what ???  They all were things NOT
made by C=.

ACT 6:

Finally  the moment has come.  A1200 is available and for a great price
too  (cheaper than the A500 !).  So offcourse I buy one.  I really love
it.   Especially from a coders view as demos are much more interresting
on  an  A1200.   I  hook it up and started doing my stuff.  But after a
while  I  started  to miss my HD, so I decided to build it in my A1200.
Together  with  a  friend of mine, we bothbuild in our 3.5 inch HD's in
our  beloved  A1200's and it worked perfect.  Untill now I've never had
any problems concerning the HD or powershortness.  Because the A1200 is
small  and  pretty light it's easy to take it along to friends and so I
do.   This  however  doesn't count for monitors but as it's possible to
connect  an  Amiga  to composite aswell it's no problem...I though.  My
composite  signal was trashed !  Were's the sync ????  Bummer 1 !!!  In
the  summerholiday I went to Sweden to a member of our group.  Well, he
still has a TV but the A1200 has a TV-mod so...  Well, you can probably
guess it.  It's busted too.  B^( But as I had opened my A1200 my
warrenty is gone, foestie, pleite !!!

Fortunately  their  is no ACT 7 now, but as soon as I buy something new
which has the C= sign on it, ACT 7 will follow...[sigh] After something
happened I always called C= first.  Who knows they might happen to know
something to fix my  problems but they always tried to get rid of me. I
like to enter C= Holland in the competition for worst service ever !

Aaaahhhh, finally got that of my chest...

Well, on March 14th we got our hands on the Apple PowerMac 8100, the top 
of the new range of Apple PowerPCs, with 16Meg of Ram, 500 meg hard disk,
CD player and the SoftWindows software that "runs PC apps at the speed of
a 486/25". I was eager to play, to say the least. It looks good (a Quadra
800 style case with a caddyless CD drive) and cost us a rather vast 4000 
UK pounds (this is NOT the retail price - we're developers) and definitely
runs the kind of Mac software we need it to run.

Now, I'm an Amiga-guy like you people, and I am eagerly awaiting something
new from C= so I can finally move into the big league in terms of power 
(my '020 based A500+/CD32 are hardly muscle machines!!). So with all of 
this new hardware cropping up, some of us may be tempted to defect to 
these new PowerPCs, or Pentiums or whatever, rather than waiting for the 
fabled A5000. This is why I wrote this - to say that right now, as of this
moment in time, I am NOT impressed enough with the PowerPC to say bye-bye
Amiga people.

In fact, I don't think I'll ever be impressed enough to leave the Ami. 
Even my humble A500+ can handle animations better than this PowerPC! In 
speed tests, there were several areas where even a Quadra 610 would give 
this thing a run for its' money. Sure there's plenty of native PPC 
software 'just around the corner' (yeah, right) but its performance as a 
Mac is, well, like a Mac -slllooooowww.

The other, H-U-G-E, crunch comes when trying to run PC software. It 
doesn't run 386 or 486 code. No siree, it's the worlds fastest 286!! Sure,
it runs windows quickly. Excel too. Doom? TFX? (the ONLY reason to even 
go near a PC) I need only quote from the machine itself - "Needs 386 or 
above to run". Aaaaaaaaaggggggggghhhhhhhh. Dust off that old 386 and play
Doom nice and slow (or on a screen 2 inches by 2 inches :-). I have it on
good authority that (one day) it will run 386/486 code. I also have it on
good authority that one day all machines will run as beautifully as the 
Amiga did in 1987!

Oh dear. Perhaps now is not the best time to purchase PowerPC, Amiga 
people. Let's hope C= go for the PA Risc chip, or at least a PPC chip 
running AmigaDos.

Keep it Amiga. At least WE know the truth. Tell your friends. Maybe oneday
I'll even get an Amiga into this company (I could always stick an Apple 
sticker on it!!) - then the rest can experience power!!

Hi there!

After all those predictions and rumors in AR recently
I thought I'd put my ideas into the pot...

Being from England I will be staying with low-end Amigas for
a long time to come. At current prices an A4000/030 would cost
me more than I take home each month (a lot more for a good one!)
So while I find discussions of what the AAA will be like
interesting, I'd like to know more about the AA+ as thats what
I will be getting next..

Well thats the problem isn't it? Theres LOTS of info about the
AAA floating about, and thats not realy surprising is it? Over
here in the UK at least, the Amiga (well the A1200) is doing well,
so I think we get forgotten about while C= trys to reassure US
Amigans. So info about the AA+ is very scarse at the moment.

I'm sure it hasn't been abandoned - Dave Haynie mentioned
both the high and low end groups share staff, so whats happening?

A long dig through my old magazines has given me enough info to
come up with some informed guesses. (Most of which will probably
be wrong!)

  Firstly what is the AA+?
  ========================

Lew has said that this is an improved version of the AA, with
improvements that couldn't be fitted into the AA. Basically as
I see it only the Video, sprites and palette have been improved
so far. AA+ will give a better blitter (Horay!), copper, proper
High density floppies, a FIFO buffered serial port, and 24 bit
graphics although I suspect only in normal PAL/NTSC modes.
Sound may be improved.

I expect the AA+ to have at least double the AA's bus bandwidth,
ie ~57Mb/s (thats the same as for the low-end AAA described in
AR201 Hmmmmmm....)

I would also expect an increase in chip ram, which leads to a
problem. The A1200's memory map is only 24 bits (16M) currently
this is 2 meg chip and 9 Meg Fast. Increasing chip ram to 4 or
8 Meg will not leave much space for fast ram.
 There are three solutions to this:-

 1) use a Full 020 with its full 32 bit addressing (and MMU)
 2) Get motorola to design a new EC020 with more address lines(!)
 3) use an EC030 16Mhz...

I know which I'd prefer!!!!

video modes:

   640 x 256/200 NI 24 bit 50/60 Hz  (Pal/NTSC)
   640 x 512/400 NI 16 bit 50/60 Hz  (DBLPal/DBLNTSC)
  1280 x 512/400 NI 256 Colours 50/60 Hz (DBLPal/DBLNTSC Super Hi-res)
   800 x 600 NI 256 colours 72 Hz (DBLSuper72??)
(with interlaced of course)

and possibly (depending on which info you believe!)

   1280 x 1024 NI 16 Colours 50 Hz

...Plus of course Productivity etc,

 AA+ is also going to cost less as it will only be 2 chips not 3.
I think it is possible that C= will Replace all current machines
this Autumn.
Why? - 2 reasons
- Cost: AA+ should be cheaper.
- AA was only a sort of stop-gap until AAA/AA+ were ready.

 I think I should explain what I mean by 'replace'.
Current A1200 upgraded to A1200+ with AA+ and OS3.1
CD32 also given AA+
A4000/040 Given AAA
for A4000/030 - could go either way! AAA/AA+ your guess is as
good as mine!

Cases will stay as with current models, meaning production can
carry on without having to re-tool all production lines, and
it may be possible for current users to upgrade motherboards
in their machines, saving them some cost.

One thing I hope Lew will fix is the bus rate of the AA+. From
the available evidence it seems the AA runs at the same speed
as the ECS. The graphical improvements are from fetching MORE
not more often. However the processor in the A1200 is now twice
as fast. Result:- each Custom chip set Odd cycle (remember Odd
cycle is DMA only) overlays 1 odd AND 1 even from the '020.
Hence the processor runs very slowly in chip ram. (I dont know
this for certain by the way, but it seems logical)

One other possibility, one that I think would make a *LOT* of
sense is for the functions of the two different low-end 
gate-array chips to be incorporated into one chip. I mean the
1200's super Gary and the CD32's Akiko. Result of this is a
A1200 you can plug a CD drive into, or a CD32 which turns into
a computer - both very cheaply! But this is a sensible idea and
we all know that C= don't always act sensibly do they? (Are you
reading Lew? Dave??)

 What is the upshot of these ideas of mine?

If Lew hasn't forgotten to improve the sound under AA+ the
A1200+ will be a multimedia machine to be reconned with. And
at probably the same price as the current 1200 execlent value.

The new CD32 should give both Atari and 3DO sleepless nights...
the CD32 - the least powerfull of the 3 machines is Dominating
the CD market place over here. The AA+ will put it up there with
the others spec wise, and it will still be miles ahead with
software support.

Happy computing all!

Darren

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the wake of Apple's PowerPC announcement (wow, they're FINALLY
releasing them?) I just thought I'd remind everyone of a few things
pointed out about the entire PowerPC line, in a recent MacWorld
magazine...

"...you won't be able to install a PowerPC Mac's version of System 7
onto a non-Apple PowerPC computer."


And they say PowerPC is a cross-platform OS setup?

"...any 680x0 application that requires an FPU will not run on a Power-
PC;  you'll have to get a PowerPC-specific software upgrade or
use a slow software FPU emulator."

"Other PowerPC-based computers won't run Mac software."


I'll take a fast bridgeboard, an Emplant, and a 4000 any day.

Now, off to the races...

A-Max IV setup...and you thought Emplant was fun.
-------------------

My A-Max IV is up and running now.  I took the ROMs out of a friend's
A-Max II (thanks Stacie!), plugged them in, and went to work.  On booting
up the software, I got an Error 7 preventing the System from loading 
itself up.  "Great!" I'm thinking.  Just when I get Emplant figured out, 
A-Max is going to bring its own barrels of joy.  So I went ahead and tried
playing with the various configurations, but got the same error.  Fine, 
fine, I'll re-install the system software.  THAT worked, and now A-Max IV
and Emplant live happily together.  Much to my surprise, neither company
programmed in a clause that melts the slot with the competitor's board.


Running A-Max IV
-------------------

Someone made a comment on CSAE that A-Max IV has a more 
"professional-looking" front-end than Emplant.  I'm not sure I see more
"professionalism" shine through in the configuration screen.  A-Max IV
brings up a Workbench window with 8 option categories, significantly
less than Emplant's 12.  The A-Max control panel is, in general,
more powerful, but I'll get into it in depth next week.


First impressions...after all, they only get one chance.
---------------------------------------------------

So far, I like it.  In terms of its "Mac-ness", the A-Max and Emplant are
to this point indistinguishable.  It's the difference in setting up the 
Mac that makes the difference.  The most obvious thing is that 4 color 
mode doesn't exist on A-Max, it's 2 or 16 for me and nothing inbetween.  
That's not a colossal loss, but I could see where 4 color mode would be 
missed. Other than that, neither board loses in the face of the other 
right away.
  

Emplant Updates:
-----------------

I've got a couple of VERY interesting programs sitting on my Mac
partition right now.  One is a C-64 emulator, the other is (from what
I'm told) a very good image manipulation program.  Unfortunately,
I'm having difficulty finding something that will appease the "This
file requires BinHex 4.0" requirement at the top of the files, so they're
sitting as large chunks of text at the moment.  (I'm making a lot of
excuses, aren't I?)  Maybe I'll talk about Emplant 4.1 a bit.


Emplant 4.1
-----------

Well, for one thing, Jim removed the screen fade from the emulation
main menu.  That was rather nice, I never realized how much TIME it
took.  The sound routines have been modified slightly, in case a Mac
program decides to bang on the Mac hardware in a very nasty 
fashion.  Serial WORKS, however I'm having a hard time getting my
modem to like the new handshaking, and no devices other than plain old
serial.device seem to work with the emulation.  Any others come up with
an error from the emulation menu.  Parallel support still works.  My 
Emplant serial ports still don't, but a lot of that blame goes to me for 
not actively pursuing UU about it.


Full Emplant Mailing List?
----------------------------

Remember that Emplant new-software-release mailing list at
emplant-request@clinton.com?  Talk is going on of making it a full-
blown mailing list (although the guy who organized the whole thing
hasn't commented yet) and interest seems to be running high of forming
a general-information Emplant mailing list, basically for the people who
are tired of the C.S.A.Emulation material.  If anyone is interested in
forming one, let me know, and I'll put the word out here.


Another program that just doesn't work well...
------------------------------------------

For reasons I can't figure out, Despair, a PD game,
does not work with the Emplant.  I've tried just about every situation I
can: nothing in the Amiga background, 2, 4, and 16 color modes, nothing
running in the Mac background...all for nothing.  Despair, a Populous
spinoff in which people run around on a Donkey-Kongish world waiting
for you to kill them in interesting ways, bus errors as soon as I try to
kill someone, unless I wait and do nothing, in which case it bus errors
shortly anyway.  The game is recent enough that I don't feel confident
that it is System 7.1 causing the problem, but it may well be, since a
Mac associate says that bus errors tend to mean System incompatibility.
The only Mac error messages I've ever seen on Emplant have been
bus errors, and I KNOW it's not all incompatibility.  Word's old crash 
problem often involved bus errors.  This only makes two programs that 
work below satisfactory levels.


Apple2000:  Kevin Kralian's masterpiece
--------------------------------------------

Ok, ok, so emulators don't look like masterpieces to everyone.  To me,
however, Kevin Kralian's Apple2000 emulator is about as close to complete
as software emulators get.  The Apple II+ emulation provides a 
multitasking Apple II+ with 64k, all video modes, keyboard (good thing, 
too), joystick, and sound support.  The disk drive is emulated using DDD 
compression files which the emulator automatically recognizes and 
dissolves.  Saves can be made in the form of memory snapshots or full 
disk storage, although most of it is at yet unimplemented in my version.
Kralian included about 40 programs for the purposes of my emulation.


So how does it taste?
-------------------

Pretty good.  I hadn't played Karateka in a LONG time, and I have to 
admit that it plays pretty authentically on my 030/25 Amiga while letting
the rest of the system run as well.  I remember playing Apple Karateka
on an Apple many, many years ago, and this looked just the same.  The
disk access is incredibly faster than a real drive would be (I would hope,
it's loading off the Amiga hard drive), and the screen updating is 
concrete. I hadn't played Choplifter in an even LONGER time.  It was there
in all its splendor, too.  (Of course, I'm more inclined to the 64 version
of these programs, but that's a matter of history.)  ProDOS and AppleDOS 
3.3 are both supported.  Multiple disk software works, because the 
emulation allows you to "insert" a disk without booting off of it.  
Karateka plays acceptably fast while Terminus downloads at 1620 cps.  It 
looks, for all the world, like an Apple II, the first real computer I ever
used.  I don't know how he could come much closer to authenticity without
replacing the "A" keys with apples. (incidentally, he provides for 
resetting the Apple from the keyboard, too) The joystick support either 
lets you use a two-button joystick or allows the right alt key for the 
second button.  It's not the greatest solution, but it works.  He even 
includes a "calibration" method using the keyboard if the joystick behaves
strangely.


Ok, so what good is it?  How am I supposed to get the Apple software 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
to the emulator, anyway?
------------------------

Well, Kralian gives detailed instructions for obtaining an Apple II ROM
image, in the event you

A. Own an Apple II or set of Apple II ROMs you can use with the program.

B. Figure Apple has better things to do than track down illicit Apple II
ROMs


It involves the Apple's built-in monitor mode.  Nothing too hard, he tells
you exactly what to do.  This is the tricky part: you need a modem.
You've gotta somehow send those ROMs to the Amiga.  From this
point, obtaining software works in one of two ways...

A.  Obtain the memory image or DDD file from somewhere and put it
directly on the Amiga hard drive.

B.  DDD compress it on the Apple side and send it over.


He's obviously done a lot of it, because I've got a nice sampling of games
and a few utilities (Music Maker is a riot) on my emulator.  Works fine 
for him.


WHY would I want to do such a thing?
------------------------------------

If you're reading my column, you probably have SOME measure of interest
in emulation.  That's the first, and most vital, step.  Just to run the 
thing, say:

"Wow, neat, an Apple II whose screen I can yank up and down", show it to
a friend who'd care and put it aside would be enough for some people.  I,
personally, find it VERY neat and that's why I sit here week after week
rambling on and on about emulators.  Historical value is a consideration, as
well as the mere act of saving space not needing an Apple II+ lying 
around. If those things don't interest you, you probably won't be too 
interested in ANY emulator.


Ok, I'm interested.  Where do I get it?
---------------------------------------

Good question.  Apple2000 hasn't been released anywhere yet.  It may be
shareware, it may appear on magazine cover disks, it may go straight into
PD.  It may do none of the above.  Kralian hasn't decided yet.  He has
nailed out AGA support and is now working on better DDD and AppleDOS
support, as well as solving a bug I've located that nobody else can
duplicate.  As always with these things, I'll let you know when I find 
out.


That's it for this week.  Until next time (one or two weeks), just 
remember: "multiplatform" is more than having a fast processor.  Keep the
emulators warm.

available on Aminet, the world wide network of ftp sites for Amiga 
software.  For further information on Aminet, ftp to ftp.wustl.edu, 
directory /pub/aminet, and read the README file available there.


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

	After getting a considerable amount of response from the quick and
dirty picture viewer test I made a while ago, I decided a more thorough 
test would be in order.  For this, a friend of mine was nice enough to 
loan me an A1200 so that I could include AGA specific software also.  
Thanks, Pekka!

	[MODERATOR'S NOTE:  The original test was posted in c.s.a.reviews
	on 23 February 1994, and is found in our ftp archives in the
	file software/graphics/PictureViewerSurvey.  - Dan]

	Only public domain, shareware, freeware and similar software is
included, simply because I do not have access to enough commercial 
software, nor the time to learn to use it well enough to get a fair view 
of the capabilities.  I felt that to avoid biasing, it would be better to
restrict the test to freely available software.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

	For more detailed information about the specific requirements of 
anyof the programs, see their documentation.

	HARDWARE

		Some of the programs require the AGA chipset found on 
                Amiga models A1200, A4000 and later.  A few of the 
                programs require a 68020 CPU or better.

	SOFTWARE

		Some of the programs require AmigaDOS version 2.0 orlater,
		or, most notably in the case of the Datatypes, even 
                AmigaDOS version 3.0 or later.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

	Amiga A1200
	Microbotics 1230XA, 50MHz 68030 board
	2MB Chip RAM, 4MB Fast RAM
	130MB hard drive
	Kickstart version 39.106, Workbench version 40.23


BACKGROUND

	The hardest part was deciding what to test.  For reasons described
above, I left all commercial software out of the test.	None would have
actually fit into the description of a "picture viewer" anyway, being
complicated and feature-laden image conversion and manipulation software.

	Next, I decided, partly for the same reasons, to leave out all
programs specifically made for image conversion and manipulation.  So you
won't find ADPro, ImageFX, ImageMaster, HamLabPlus, NETPBM, or any other
similar programs here.  Sorry.

	What was left after this was the relatively simple programs meant
for displaying pictures in various formats.  Note that most, if not all, 
of these programs sacrifice quality for speed, unlike the dedicated 
converter programs.

	This time, AGA modes were used where applicable, and if the 
program supported them.  No extra ECS-specific tests were made.  If a 
program had two versions, an AGA specific and an ECS specific, the AGA 
specific one was used.

	Most programs in the review have a command line interface only, 
with perhaps the capability to read the options from icon tooltypes also.
All tests were made using the command line interface, except in the case 
of ViewJpeg, which had a GUI interface only (and a horrible file requester,
something that was quite common in the AmigaDOS 1.3 days).

	Originally, I intended to test AIVE 1.0 also.  During the testing,
it produced lots of alerts and even crashes, and thus I had to leave it
out.  From what I did find out, it was exceptionally slow and supported a
subset of IFF ILBM only, so I don't think dropping it from the review 
changed the results too much.

	Explanation of the columns:

	- IFF, IFF24, GIF and JPEG are picture formats. PCHG is an
	  extension of the IFF ILBM format with a multipalette chunk 
          mostly usable for HAM pictures.
	- DT means the program can use Datatypes to display pictures.
	- Mode means support for manual screenmode selection from the
	  Display Database.
	- Multi means capability of showing multiple files on one
	  invocation.
	- Slide means basic slideshow support, such as looping through
	  the pictures, showing a picture for a specified time, and
	  hidden decompression while showing another picture.
	- FReq means the pictures can be selected from a file requester.
	- AGA means the program supports AGA modes.


PICTURES USED IN TESTING

	Two pictures were used in the testing.	For a color picture, I
decided to use a 597x796x24 scan of a Boris Vallejo painting, available 
on ftp.funet.fi as /pub/pics/art/BorisVallejo/bv9.jpg.  This picture was
downscaled and converted with the NETPBM image conversion package to all 
the formats used in the test, with the exception of the HAM6 version, 
which was converted with HamLabPlus as a PCHG HAM (using 12 color 
registers in the slicing).  For black and white, I used a 600x787x1 clip 
art collage GIF which I also converted to IFF.

	Pic#	Description

	2		597x796x8 grayscale JPEG

SPEED OF THE PROGRAMS

	The timing of the programs was done using the Spy System 3 system
performance monitor package, and the CPUTime command.  This program runs 
the program given to it as a command line argument, and after the program
has finished, reports the real time and CPU time taken by the program.  In
the following table I have listed the real time.  While on first thought, 
CPU time might have been more truthful, it would have not included the 
time used to access the disk.  Some of the programs use asynchronous file
I/O, decompressing at the same time as reading from the disk, while others
first read a bit, then decompress, read a bit more, etc.  Given the same
decompression routine, a program using asynchronous I/O can be 
significantly faster, although the CPU time taken would be the same.  This
is why real time is listed.	 See the end of this article for the 
listing of both real and CPU time.

	The times are in seconds, and include all initializations and
cleaning up the program made before and after displaying the picture.  If
the program wasn't capable of exiting immediately after displaying the
picture, the number includes the time it took me to press the mouse button,
ESCAPE, ENTER, or whatever the program required to exit.  Datatypes were
timed using Viewtek with the DT option.

	It should be kept in mind that the times below are the results of
one iteration only.  That is, I tested the programs once.  There might be
random errors that repeated testing could have eliminated.  This is
especially true with the viewers that could not exit automatically, where my
own reaction time might account for most of the time.  The CPU time could be
nearer to the truth in these cases.

NOTES ON QUALITY

	My experience has been that on an ECS Amiga, FastJPEG produces by
far the best result from a JPEG picture.  In HAM8 mode on an AGA machine,
the dithering is not that critical, and thus the difference in quality
between FastJPEG and other JPEG viewers is less.  FastJPEG also has a
"dirty" option, which turns off dithering and speed up the displaying
considerably.  With this option, the resulting picture is very close to
Viewtek quality.

	PPShow has a problem when rendering 24-bit to HAM.  While this is
only a marginal problem on HAM8, it shows up extremely clearly on ECS
machines and HAM6 mode.	The result is hard to describe, but diagonal and
vertical lines of high contrast are messy.

	Some of the viewers convert 256 color GIFs to HAM6.  This is a
two-sided matter.  While this is the only practical way of displaying the
pictures in color on ECS machines, HAM6 resolution is not that good.


MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

	I've collected here some notes that I felt might be of some use to
the readers.

	Viewtek can show 256 color IFFs even on ECS Amigas.  It will 
render them in HAM6 mode, and the result is identical to a 256 color GIF.
In addition, it shows HAM8 pictures on ECS machines, but seems to simply 
strip two bitplanes out, and not do any rendering to HAM6.  The result is
quite weird looking.

	Gif_view, HAMGIF, VirtGIF and Viewtek show 256 color GIFs in HAM6 on
ECS machines.  Other GIF-capable viewers show them in 16 grayscales.

	Viewtek and PPShow can also play ANIMs.


MICRO REVIEW

	In my opinion, the overall quality of a display viewer can be 
judged from three roughly equal parts:  flexibility, speed, and display 
quality. What follows is a quick assessment of the viewers in this test 
in the comp.sys.amiga.reviews micro-review format.

CONCLUSIONS

	PPShow was great all around. You will probably want a fast viewer
that can display a lot of things with good to reasonable quality, and 
PPShow fits the description. The JPEG and IFF24 display quality leave room
for improvement, but both are fast. In case you're willing to use several
viewers, I would recommend using FastJPEG for JPEGs. It is a bit faster 
than PPShow, and a lot better quality. If you happen to be a speed freak,
or use a slow machine, you might want to consider using the ZGIF.datatype
with PPShow for GIF pictures.

	Viewtek used to be the best all-around viewer available, and it
still is quite nice.  It has a lot of options, but suffers from number of
bugs and chronic slowness.  Personally, I'm surprised it is thought to be a
fast viewer.


SPECIAL NEWSFLASH FOR AMIGADOS 3.x USERS

	At the last moment, I decided to try Tron's PCX datatype (TPD.lha on
Aminet) on a 256-color conversion of the JPEG used in the above tests.  It
is significantly faster than the other PCX Datatype (PCX.lha on Aminet) 
I've seen.  The times to display the picture were 8.6 seconds (TPD) and 
12.4 seconds (PCX).

                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

  Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

  The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software, online.

  Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

  Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES.

  35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

  No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

  Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

  Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

  Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

  FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
  Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  

  Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

  The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
  Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
  All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

  Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

  And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

Portal Signup or for more information:

   408-973-8091 (modem 9600/14400) 24 hours every day

   or enter "C PORTAL" from any Sprintnet dial-in in the USA,
   or telnet to "portal.com" from anywhere.

* plus cost of phone call if out of Portal's local dialing area
  Direct rates also apply to connections made to Portal using the
  UNIX "telnet" program from an account you may already
  have on an Internet-connected system. 
% 9600 bps Sprintnet in over 300 cities areas
+ $10 rate prevails at smaller US Cities
# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

AUTHOR

     Oliver Wagner

     Internet: o.wagner@aworld.aworld.de

DESCRIPTION

     BombPac is a game loosely based on the old PacMan
     characters, with some `bombastic' value added. It features
     over 100 levels and a standalone level editor.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     BombPac for the CD32 requires an AGA Amiga (A1200, A4000, CD32)
     with at least OS 3.0. A game controller or joystick is
     recommended, but not required. Due to sprite usage, it
     only runs on 15 khz PAL displays, promotion is not possible.

AUTHOR

     Christian Stiens (stiens@math.uni-muenster.de)

DESCRIPTION

     With `FMsynth' you can generate sounds with one of the best not
     sample based synthesis method, the FM-synthesis. It has six
     operators, four waveforms per operator, a pitch EG, a freely 
     editable algorithm and a realtime LFO. You can save the sounds 
     in 8SVX or raw format. The sounds can be played on the Amiga 
     keyboard or on a keyboard which is connected to the Amiga via
     MIDI. In this case, the sound responds to key velocity and pitch
     bend wheel. Included are 260 sounds. Also included is the program
     `FMconvert' which converts DX7 voice banks to the FMsynth voice
     format.

NEW FEATURES

     - Some minor bug fixes
     - Uses the preferences busy pointer

    AmigaNet: 39:157/101.15
    NLA:      14:105/2.15

DESCRIPTION

    `Phonebill' is, simply said, a logfile analyser. What it basically
    does is scan the logfile(s) generated by a terminal program or a
    mailer, extract all information about calls you have made by using
    your modem, and store this in its own (short) format. Features:

    * Requires Kickstart 2.04 or higher.

    * Supports new 3.0 features (new look menus, ...).

    * Nice gadtools compliant GUI.

    * User-definable callrates, supporting  rate exceptions for certain
      days and dates. Handles fees and time-units with up to 4 decimals
      (e.g.  $1.2344 dollars per 30.5678 seconds) for extra accuracy.

    * Supports logfiles generated by:
         * AmigaUUCP Timelog
         * AutoPilot
         * JrComm
         * MagiCall
         * MicroDot
         * MultiFax professional
         * NComm
         * Terminus
         * TKR-BTX
         * TrapDoor
         * TrapFax
         * Term (Term action-log and Term call-log)

    * Automatical logfile truncating.

    * Generates miscellaneous reports: statistics, total costs, etc.

    * Context-sensitive online help.


NEW FEATURES

    * Added TKR-BTX support.

    * Added AutoPilot support.

    * Fixed a problem with the MicroDot logfile: A call ending with
      "NETCALL abgebrochen" was not recognized as a valid call, and
      therefore skipped.

    * Any trailing spaces entered at the end of the from/to-date strings
      are ignored now.

    * The `LogScan' signature from the term logfile did not have the
      appropriate dateformat. Therefore, it could happen that the
      signature wasn't recognized during some months, which might have
      resulted in `fake' (duplicate) new calls.

    * Generating report now is approx twice as fast due to the use of
      asynchronous I/O.

    * More commandline arguments are supported.

    * Added a "Save"-button in the "Settings not saved" requester.

    * Added `dupe'-detection: duplicate calls are automatically removed.
      So now there is no harm done when a logfile is accidently scanned
      twice. I recommend that you re-save your binary logfile by
      pressing `Save' in the maintenance panel, so that dupes from
      previous versions are removed (if there were any).

     Options to rewind and/or eject tape when the file closes.

BUG FIXES

     Fixed bad decoding of board# and LUN from 3-digit unit number.
     Write at end of file writes only the necessary number of blocks.
     Read at end of file returns all the data.
     More than 256 files per tape.
     Fixed incompatibility with Steve Koren's Job Manager (JM).
     See the changes.doc file for a complete list of fixes and enhancements.

    Dr. Paul Tarau, Dept. of Computer Science
       Universite de Moncton, Moncton N.B., Canada E1A-3E9
       E-MAIL: tarau@info.umoncton.ca

    Recompiled for Amiga: Doug Whitehead  doug@cos.com

SHORT

    A fast, reliable, small Prolog compiler. It uses standard C&M syntax.

DESCRIPTION

    A standard implementation of Prolog, now ported to the Amiga.
    Prolog is a non-procedural language commonly used for Artificial 
    Intelligence. Many Prolog programs look like inductive proofs.
    It is non-procedural in that one tends to specify what to look 
    for, and Prolog will search and backtrack as necessary
    to try to accomplish it. 
   
    Prolog is useful for parsers, knowledge representation, blind and 
    heuristic search, theorem proving, and other app.s requiring search.
    And, of course, there are zealots that use it for everything.
   
    It is, to my knowledge, the fastest Prolog on the Amiga.
    For those in the know, it compiles to a sort of WAM-lite, and then
    emulates that language in compiled C. 
       
    The distribution's manual does not teach Prolog. If you want that, 
    buy a book, there are many.
   
    The WAM emulator has recently been compiled for the Amiga. You need
    two files, the standard BinProlog 2.20 release, and the appropriate
    Amiga binary.

    It should be able to run on any Amiga, regardless of CPU or memory
    available. However, you may not be able to execute interesting 
    programs on systems with less than 1 Meg. 

    ru.68020.amiga requires a 68020 + 68881, or 68030 or above. 
    It clocks in at 34.9 klips (thousand logical inferences/second)
    on an Amiga 3000 25mhz (i.e. a 68030).

    ru.68000.amiga clocks in at 32.7 klips on an Amiga 3000.
    It has not been tested it on a 68000 Amiga, but it should be fine.

DESCRIPTION

          Virus Scanner is a viruskiller commodity for OS 2.0+, it's a
     modular program (it uses SHI bootblock.library, removelink.library
     and unpack.library).  This means that you can update the program
     by simply updating the libraries.  It's localized in different
     languages (actually English, Italian, Danish and German, but soon
     French) and it has some completely new features for amiga
     antivirus.  For instance you can build a list of files you want to
     be checked at every disk access, and if one of these files is
     modified you will be notified by a requester.  The newest feature
     of VS is the ability to compile an ASCII file that will contain
     the data of new viruses which will read by VS before the scan of
     HD or disks.  New virus data will be spread via E-Mail.  VS will
     automatically recognise them and append to the list.  It can also
     check crunched files (more than 100 crunchers, lha and dms), and
     has a complete arexx port to make easy to use it also in a BBS.
          
NEW FEATURES
     
     This is an update of version 1.03 that will improve some functions
     (Check files, Check vectors), has a corrected and more complete
     documentation and some little bugs fixed.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Virus Scanner requires Kickstart 2.0+
     If 2.1 or 3.0 is detected it can be localized and on
     Kick 3.0 it will use some gadtools improvments.

DESCRIPTION

        StatRam is a recoverable ram drive.  It works on any Amiga using
        V2.04 or greater of the OS.  It handles any filesystem (either
        Amiga or foreign, like e.g.  CrossDOS(tm)), has ten units and
        may be layed out like a floppy disk for quick diskcopies.  It is
        dynamic, that is it allocates and frees memory as files are
        copied and deleted, and is probably the most recoverable ram
        drive available.  Even the worst system crash will not erase it,
        as long as the portion of memory where it resides is not
        corrupted.

     PGPSendmail

VERSION

     2.0

AUTHOR

     Peter Simons <simons@peti.GUN.de>

DESCRIPTION

        PGPSendmail is a small tool, to encrypt your outgoing e-mail
     automatically, using PGP. Despite the name, PGPSendmail does *not*
     handle any transport stuff, but requires the original sendmail.

        PGPSendmail scans through the outgoing mail and checks whether a
     public key is available for the receipient(s). Multiple receipients
     via `To:' or `Cc:' are supported. If a key is available, a requester
     will pop up, asking you if you'd like to encrypt the mail.  When you
     choose the "encrypt" gadget, the message-body will be encrypted and
     the result will be sent to sendmail to handle the routing and
     transport.

        Since PGPSendmail is only a front-end, it can be used in any kind
     of setup. It doesn't matter whether you use AmiTCP, UUCP or whatever
     to deliver your mail, PGPSendmail can be customized for your
     requirements.

     The encrypted message will look like this:

          Automatically encrypted message-body follows:
