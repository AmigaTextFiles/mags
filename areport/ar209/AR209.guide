It isn't anything new, but it seems this is the week to put some pressure
on CBM's marketing division. I hate to become part of the "fad", but I
can't say I blame the developers and users of the Amiga. ....And I'm quite
sure I'm saying something that the people there at CBM don't already
know. CBM!! Are you listening!? Advertise!

OK, whew! I'm done. We have a nice new edition with lots of coverage on
various subjects. Most of which, the readers have sent in. Either with
articles, or rumors, news, and other bits and pieces of Amiga "stuff".
Please, by all means, keep it up!

One note though. We are not taking any more BBS distro sites. The only
ones that will be added from this point, will be from countries who
are not currently covered. Also the BBS distro site listing will only
be posted in the issues ending in an odd number (ie: 201, 203, 205, etc.)
Basically so that we can add more to AR without really increasing the
size.

Next, we have two pictures included. You need to have the DISPLAY command
within your path. We will be going back to the AR_Viewer here in the
near future, but currently the author is making a couple changes to it.

There's not alot to "chit-chat" about, so I'll let you get on with
your reading ....enjoy!

Amiga CD32 Launched in U.S.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        --== Amiga CD32 Launched in U.S. at Intermedia ==--

(San Jose, CA - March 1, 1994) Commodore Business Machines, Inc. today
announced at Intermedia the availability of the Amiga CD32 game machine
in the United States
 
"The CD32 will be available this spring at mall-based software stores,
regional electronics stores, and Amiga dealers throughout the US," says John
DiLullo, Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Commordore Business
Machines, Inc.  "We are bundling three excellant games with the CD32:
Pinball Fantasies by 21st Century, Wing Commander by Electronic Arts, and
Oscar from Microvalue Flair," DiLullo added," and offering a special price on
Psygnosis' Microcosm."

First launched in Europe this past fall, Commodore reports to have sold over
100,000 units in Europe in just three months prior to Christmas.  By
outselling Sega four to one and claiming 38% market share of all CD ROM
drives sold in the UK (according to the Gallup Weekly Report), the Amiga
CD32 has established itself as the undisputed leader of the 32 bit machines.
Electronic Gaming Monthly agrees by rating the CD32 higher than Sega CD,
3DO or Jaguar.  At a suggested retail price of just $399, the Amiga CD32
features an unbeatable combination of power and affordability.
 
"We challenge anyone to show us a better multimedia player at a better
price," says Lew Eggebrecht, Vice President of Engineering for Commodore
International.
 
"With 50 titles available today and 100 expected by first ship in the U.S., the
Amiga CD32 has wide support among the software development
community," says John Campbell, Director of Applications and Technical
Support for Commodore International.  "The success we have had in Europe
has convinced publishers to invest in creating revolutionary new titles for the
Amiga CD32," Campbell added.
 
The Amiga CD32 features a 32 bit Motorola 68EC020 Microprocessor with
2MB of memory, 16.7 million colors, and a double speed CD ROM drive built in.
The CD32 will play audio CDs, most CDTV discs, and CD32 discs.  With the
addition of an optional MPEG-1 full motion video module, the CD32 can
play MPEG VideoCDs, MovieCDs and Karaoke CDs with up to 74 minytes of
better-than-VHS quality video and CD quality audio on a single disc.  The
suggested retail price of the MPEG module is $249.
 
"The CD ROM drive in the CD32 is a fully multisession compatible Mode 1,
Mode 2 Form 1, and Mode 2 Form 2 drive," says Jeffrey Porter, Director,
Advanced Technology for Commodore International.  "With optional
software, the CD32 can read Kodak PhotoCD discs," Porter added.
 
Commodore Business Machines, Inc. based in West Chester, PA is the U.S.
subsidary of Commodore Internatrinal Limited.  The company manufactures
and markets a complete line of Amiga computers and peripherals for the
business, consumer, educational, and vertical markets.  The company's
worldwide installed user base of Amiga computers is approximately 5 million
units.

Just thought I would add my 2 cents to the pot.  You might say there is 
the big three when it comes to personal computers (Amiga,Mac,& the name 
sake clone). However if you read anything short of an Amiga only magazine
you will find only a rare mention of the Amiga especially when it comes 
to multimedia.  I read several trade journels, Byte magazine, and Amiga 
World, and  you guessed it, no mention of the Amiga except in Amiga World.
Well what I would like to get down to is a comparison of likes and 
dislikes I have about the different platforms.

I am currently using a Mac Quatra 660AV to develope some multimedia
presentations for the introductory Circuits course here at the Unitversity
of Missouri-Columbia.  Why the Mac?  You are looking at a school that has
every kind of computer but an Amiga.  Reason 2, my advisor has a Quatra 
800 with nice fancy Apple laser printer and color scanner.  #3.  There is
just no convincing my advisor the many benifits of having an Amiga.  I 
tried to show him some stuff I did with Amiga Guide and he just shrugged 
it off.

Well enough said there, it is an awsome set up with 24meg of memory and a
500 meg hardrive not to mention the audio and video digitizing built right
into the machine.  Also a CD rom which uses a caddy.  What I don't like 
about it is the way you manipulate your windows.  If it wasn't for the 
finder you would be lost.  I finally discovered that you could use the 
finder to force a window to the front.  The other way is to click on the 
window to bring it forward.  If there are very many windows open it gets 
quite tedious to do much of anything.  On the Amiga you have the left 
Amiga plus N or M keys and a nice gadget for pushing the screen back.  
Just adding a few of the Amigas GUI features to the Mac would make a lot 
of difference.  Other problems, while trying to run some of the 
applications I had memory problems.  It seems most programs need memory 
assigned to them on startup and do not do any dynamic allocation.  Though
when you are digitizing Video /Audio with the Fusion recorder it must 
allocate memory since just a few seconds sucked up about 14 megabytes.  
However, the quality was rather poor, quite a bit of noise in the picture.
Also missing is a shell, no command line though there is a scripting 
language on the system.  Text reading gets a bit tedious at times, there 
are no text readers that use an interface like 'More'.  You are left with
a straight scroll bar, not even scrolling text via the mouse like in 'Much
More'.  Everything seems to be in black & white, quite a boring 
enviornment to work in when the machine is sitting on top of a 24bit 
graphics engine.  Some color Icons but most are monocrome and look plain.
Forbid you would ever want to straighten up your display.  There is a 
cleanup menu item that does nothing when you select it.  I have been 
moving the Icons arround manually which seem to snap to a grid and then 
hitting Cleanup in hopes they will stay put.  But the computer will not 
do it for you.  I think the system saves the configuration you are in when
you exit because when I have turned the machine on windows would be open 
from various folders in the system and you can have Icons laying arround 
on the Mac equivalant of the Workbench.

A few likes, the clipboard works real nice and seems to be integrated into
everything.  Example, I needed some mathmatical equations for part of my
presentation.  I used insert object equation from Microsoft Word, created
the equations I needed then inserted it into a blank document.  Next, I 
copied it to the clipboard and pasted it into Canvas (paint program).  
Once in Canvas I pasted the object and was able to stretch and resize it 
on the fly.  Canvas treats everthing pretty much like a structured object,
though the display redraw slows down as the number of objects increase.

I hope this gives everyone a glimps at the competition and stirs up some
ideas for Amiga programs.  I am still stuck with my floppy based A500 but,
I can do things on my 2 meg machine that would be impossible on a 2 meg
Mac or IBM clone.  Just the OS on the Quatra was using roughly a 2 meg
memory partition.  I doubt an A4000 needs 2 meg to run in.  Driving the
Amiga OS  is like driving a smooth running exotic sports car (take your 
pick). With the competition you get your choice of walking or riding in 
a covered wagon, not very pleasant no matter how you look at it.

I am always getting stirred up about the things I read.  The latest is an
article I read in IEEE Potentials about Multimedia.  Written by a PHD 
candidate who seemed quite unaware that anything but a Mac or Clone 
machine exists. He talked about the MPC minimum standard for multimedia, 
If you had the minimum system you might be able to play an audio CD on 
your CD rom drive and that would be about it.

Well I think thats enough for this bit of text.

 WHY VOTE FOR THESE GROUPS
 
 We are just witnessing the sudden birth of the 32-bit CDROM age, the
 past 4 months have seen a huge explosion in the interest of gaming from
 the CD. There are huge increases weekly in the numbers of silver discs
 being sold with games and serious software pressed onto them instead of
 the latest pop hit...and CD32 - which is lonely without a group is one
 of the main contenders - both as a game platform and as a pro-serious
 computing platform.
  
 Within the year, you will find >100,000 of CD32 machines will have
 turned into fully-fledged computer systems thanks to 2 new module
 add-ons from 3rd party developers - one, the SX1 is already available.
 Many will also have become slave CD-ROM's.
  
 The machine is ALSO an AMIGA <and there is no doubting this fact>
 - so many computing people will want the comp.* group - also, many 
 of the problems will be amiga type problems (of memory and how the 
 thing works in general) - this can only be dealt with by amiga people
 - not just games oriented people.
  
 The add-on for the A4000 to allow CD32 gaming is still in main
 development and as this is the main development platform, its release is
 imminently in the spring - exactly when the cd32 groups will finally
 form!
  
 But there is also no denying that the CD32 isn't a games console either,
 far from it! So the rec.games.video.cd32 group is also required - to
 take the CD32 into the main arena for it isn't just a computing system.
  
 The CD32 now has 45% of the CDROM market in the UK (this is a true
 figure from the trade press) against 27% for the PC CDROM (which is
 dominated by multimedia and serious software). Admittedly, the market on
 CD32 right now is games - provoking the rec. group but what happens when
 the serious software comes out for CD32 (ie Wordworth 3, pagestream 3
 and many more such titles..- all would utilize CD medium to the full)?
  
 So we require the 2 groups,
  
 One to put all CD32 bandwidth from all comp.sys.amiga.* groups into one
 group where it can be seen clearly.
 Another for just the gamers out there who only want game discussion.

PRODUCT NAME

        Body Blows Galactic - AGA


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

    A beat-em-up game which pits 12 different fighters from 6 different 
    worlds against one another.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

        Name:           Team17 Software Ltd
        Address:        Marwood House, Garden St, 
                        Wakefield, West Yorkshire
                        WF1 1DX
                        England

        Telephone:      (0)924 201846



LIST PRICE

     #29.99 (that's pounds)
     I paid $22 Canadian for it, but I bought a special copy that used to
     be given away for free as some promotion for A1200's.  My copy didn't 
     have a box, just a plastic bag with 2 disks and a manual.




SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE

                AGA obviosly.  <An OCS version exists however>

                RAM: 1 MB required. 
                     Extra memory above 1 MB will be used to store data 
                     during play.



        SOFTWARE
        
                NONE, unless you have an NTSC Amiga.
                I had to use Chris Hames' Degrader 1.30 to get it to work
                in PAL.  The early startup control doesn't help.
                
                Body Blows Galactic works on all versions of the OS.


COPY PROTECTION

  Disk-based (the disk itself cannot be copied with DiskCopy)
  I couldn't get DMS to copy it either.

  NOT hard drive installable.

  Original disks required for use, however no data is ever saved to
  disk so you can leave them write protected (and are encouraged to
  do so in the manual).

  I rate the copy protection as somewhere between Acceptable and Annoying.
  People used to such things would not be bothered however I'm worried
  that my original disks might get damaged.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        A4000/030 - NTSC
        2 MB Chip RAM + 2MB Fast RAM
        1 external 880 k floppy + the standard A4000 disk drives etc.
        C= 1942 Monitor.
        Kickstart 3.0, Workbench 3.0
        Also used Chris Hames' Degrader 1.30 to switch to PAL mode.
        
        Also tried it on:

        A1200 - NTSC
        2 MB Chip RAM + 4 MB Fast RAM
        GVP SCSI+Fast Ram /w FPU option.
        Internal Clock
        C= 1942 Monitor
        Kickstart 3.0, Workbench 3.0



INSTALLATION

         None required.  Just DO IT!

REVIEW

  When I first arrived at one of my friendly neighborhood Amiga
  dealers (YES there are several in my town), I wasn't planning on buying
  anything, in particular. One of my pals was picking up an A4000 which he
  had on lay away (for almost a year as far as I know). Anyways, I'm not
  that big on video games in general (anymore), especially the OS
  non-compliant variety that take over your machine and don't let you
  multitask or heaven forbid don't install on your hard drive.
        
  I did decide to pick up the first issue of Amiga Game Zone magazine
  (which was damn good, I'll do a review on that later), and while we were
  about to leave I saw a few games in the discount bin without boxes at
  significantly reduced prices. Body Blows Galactic was among them. At $22
  dollars I figured I couldn't lose, even if it was OS non-compliant. I
  remember paying (happily I might add) over $50 for Intellivision games
  and upwards of $80 for Nintendo games. This copy was originally part of
  a special A1200 promotion, which explained the low price and lack of a
  box.

  Anyways, when we returned from the dealership I immedietly tried the
  disk on my friend's A1200.  To my surprise it worked!  What didn't
  surprise me was that the bottom 50 or so scan lines were missing from
  the screen.  This is typical of PAL games brought over here.  I wish
  developers would show more consideration for North American Amiga
  owners.  But I digress.

  I tried rebooting with the Early Startup Control set to PAL, but that
  didn't work (or surprise me) either.  So with-out having a copy of
  degrader handy we tried out the game sans the bottom 10% of the
  screen.

  The first thing you'll notice when after the game boots is the amazing
  intro music!  I'm talking real cool! Sort of a Techno-House
  dance tune, with digitized effects and a chorus that occasionaly
  chants the phrase "Body Blows" in time with the beat.  Anime
  style portraits of the characters then appear one at a time
  while flying pixels make neat patterns in the backdrop.
            
  The title screen itself consists of a beatifully rendered
  characters which are reflected below as if on water.  This
  rippling water effect is used later on in one of the sceneries
  where the characters actually fight in an ankle deep rippling pond next
  to more than 1 animated waterfall.

  Pressing the fire button brings you to a main menu.  Where you
  get your typical playing options.
                                        
  You can play against the computer or against a friend. In
  tournament mode you can have either 4 or 8 players using any of
  the 12 characters (Yes, you can all pick the same character's if
  you like).  There are several game options also.  Matches can
  either be determined in a single round, or by playing a best 2 of 3.
  A match can have a time limit of 60 or 90 seconds per round or
  have unlimited time.  There are 3 difficulty levels when playing
  against the computer.  There is also a special mercy mode, which
  prevents the other character from being able to hit you
  immedietly after you stand up (after being knocked down).
        
  Now the fun part: playing the game.
      
  The central theme/plot/concept (such as it is) of the game is that 2
  characters from Body Blows after defeating the evil Max "decide to take
  on the universe and challenge the meanest and toughest in an
  Intergalactic Competition, to become the ultimate Galactic Warrior." Yes
  it sounds hokey (sp?) but it's an excuse to have a fight.
 
  Playability is extremely high. My little 11 year old Nintendo raised
  brother is bugging me all the time to play Body Blows Galactic.
  According to him it is better than the SNES Street Fighter II. It's been
  a while since I've played SNES Street Fighter II, so I don't remember.
  The graphics are certainly better than SNES SFII. *THAT* I can remember.
  Several of the worlds in Body Blows Galactic AGA sport full screen
  parallax. Not only do objects in the scenery scroll left and right but
  up and down as well when a character jumps. There are also objects which
  scroll infront of the action as well as behind. One of them is a waist
  high wire mesh fence or devider which you can actually see through. The
  paralax is about as good as I've seen in a beat-em-up on a home computer
  or video game console. It certainly puts SFII or Mortal Kombat for Amiga
  to shame. (Of course I'm comparing an AGA game to 2 ECS games there).

  All of the sceneries in Body Blows Galactic are very nice to look at,
  and lend themselves well to the mood of the game.  The joystick
  control is very responsive, and the moves are easy to learn. There are
  20 to 21 moves for each character and Body Blows Galactic gets all of
  those using only a 1 fire button joystick.  There is no keyboard
  support, so you need at least 1 joystick or 2 for multiple
  players.

  Each of the 6 worlds has unique background music which stay
  comfortably in the background.  All of the songs are very well
  done and the music doesn't steal audio channels from the sound effects
  (or vice versa it seems).  All of the characters make different
  sounds when they punch, kick or whatnot and this adds greatly to the
  game.  One character Lazer, makes sounds like "hik!" "hook" ,
  "uk" and things along those lines. A friend got very frustrated
  when I kept catching him with the "hik!" move. This lead to a
  joke that went along the lines of "all you need is a 'hik!' and
  everything will be ok!"  It was funny at the time! :)

  I should mention that the AGA version sports more colours,
  better quality sound, more sound effects and tweaked music over
  the OCS version.  So I can't vouch for the OCS sound.
        
  All of the characters have very distinct personalities with all
  the flavour and atmosphere of any of the other more well known
  beat-em-ups, without resorting to look-a-likes.  i.e. Sub-Zero and
  Scorpion from Mortal Kombat. You get 12 UNIQUE characters with
  Body Blows Galactic!


DOCUMENTATION

  The Documentation was adequete.  It came in 4 languages and explained 
  how to do the moves and a little history on each of the worlds. It 
  also included a price list for other Team17 games.

  It was easy to read and mildly interesting for all of the 10 or
  15 minutes it took to read.


 
 LIKES AND DISLIKES

  What can I say.  It should have been hard drive installable.  And
  it should have been mode promotable to DBLPAL.  At least it should
  provide a means for switching to PAL from NTSC.  I know many
  pirate copies of games include PAL booters.  What kind of a
  message does this send when pirate games are more playable than
  store bought versions?

  If there isn't an NTSC version of this game and you are running
  of your TV in North America, you won't be able to play it.
        
  The music is superb. The graphics are superb. The feel and
  playability is excellent. This is a game I will be proud to show my PC
  loving, SNES loving and Genesis loving friends (along with Alien Breed
  II AGA). Someone I know (who has never owned an Amiga) appears to be
  thinking about getting a CD32 contingent on an NTSC version of this game
  and Alien Breed 2. Go TEAM17!! Get some North American Support
  happening!
        
  I liked that I didn't need to get a 2 buttom joystick to use all the
  moves, but at the same time I sort of wish I did cause I'd really like
  more moves. Only 1 button is used in this game.

COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

  There is no Comparison.  Body Blows Galactic is the best beatem up
  on the Amiga I've ever seen.  I've played SFII (which I couldn't
  stand and is completely un-playable and WAY to fast and jerky on my
  A4000, not to mention lame sound effects) Mortal Kombat (which I could
  stand if I had an A500, but I can't stand on an AGA machine even if
  it had parallax scrolling which it doesn't!), and some other
  game whose name eludes me but rest assured is the worse of the 4.
        
 BUGS
  If you could call PAL a bug, then it has a bug.


VENDOR SUPPORT

  Haven't had any need to call the vendor, although Team17 does
  encourage you to call them if you experience problems.

WARRANTY

  I don't think there is a warranty.  Although I expect Team17
  will replace damage disked at a small cost.  But don't quote me
  on that.

CONCLUSIONS
       
  Overall I rate Body Blows Galactic a **** out of 5 stars.

  If it had been hard drive installable, mode promoteable and
  multitasked I'd have given it 5 out of 5.  If you are looking
  for a beat em up for your Amiga.  BUY THIS!

  This is a damn good game and if you are a fan of this genre you should
  definitly buy Body Blows Galactic.

  Final impressions?  I've rubbed my left thumb raw from playing
  Body Blows Galactic!  I haven't done that since Double Dribble
  for the original NES.

MHO: How we can best help the Amiga in America
 
One of the reasons why the Commodore Amiga computer, despite its 
technological advantages, is not as popular as the IBM PC or Apple 
Macintosh is its  lack of software support.  Although Amiga niche 
market products for video and  animation are in many cases 
unrivaled, there is this perception that the  Amiga just doesn't 
quite measure up in the other areas, including <gasp!>  
entertainment.
 
Notice I said PERCEPTION.  In marketing, image is everything, and 
this has  produced a catch-22 situation in America.  Since we are 
perceived to have  fallen behind, it has become a RISK, instead of 
an opportunity, for American  developers to write new Amiga 
software.  Witness Gold Disk's recent retreat  from further 
development. (At least they are willing to support their existing 
software!)  This, in turn, only DEEPENS the negative perception of 
the  general computer-buying public.  A truly vicious cycle.
 
But WAIT a minute!  We don't have to be at the mercy of jittery 
developers or  ineffective CBM marketing!  WE are Amiga owners, 
DadGummit, and THAT makes a  difference!
 
What I'm going to suggest may curl your hair... so be prepared.  If 
you're  happy with the way things are with the Amiga in America, 
then stop reading  now.  But if you're fed up with the disrespect 
and second-class status we've  received, I invite you to consider 
the following ideas.
 
We have too long depended upon others to give us what we want.  The 
time has  come for us to make it happen ourselves!  With an 
estimated 4 million amiga  users worldwide, we have a GOLD MINE of 
potential on our side.  And YOU ar a  vital part of that potential.
 
The Amiga word processor that blows Word Perfect 6.0 out of the 
water; the  Amiga spreadsheet that obliterates Microsoft Excel; the 
amazing interactive  educational applications; the new 
entertainment programs that will once again  turn the non-Amigans 
green with envy - all of these are just waiting to  explode into 
the marketplace!
 
Unfortunately, they will only continue to wait - in the prison of 
mere  potentiality - until you... yes, You...  I said -->YOU<-- 
decide to write  them.  I am calling upon the American Amiga 
community to rise up and fight  for their machines: not with a 
sword, but with a compiler!
 
I'm not talking about shareware here (But a million thanks to those 
who  support us with shareware!  register, Register, REGISTER the 
shareware you  use, please!).
 
I'm talking about you, John and Mary Q. Reader, starting your own 
freelance  programming enterprises, software companies, and 
distribution networks!   There'll be loners and two member 
partnerships. I'm also seeing 4-5 member  development teams (who 
met at a user-group meeting or on a BBS) rising to the  occasion, 
even competing with other local groups, to professionally meet the  
unmet needs of the Amiga community.
 
Where do you think Electronic Arts, Sierra On-Line, and NewTek came 
from?  Do  you think the software company fairy just waved her 
magic wand, and *POOF*,  they suddenly appeared???  Give me a 
break!  They were EACH just a group of  people with an idea, once.
 
How hard do you think it is to learn the fundamentals of 
programming?  About  as hard as buying THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE 
by Kernigan and Ritchie for $35,  and downloading a shareware 
compiler. (I recommend DICE from Fred Fish 491 -  then regiser!)  
In two weeks, you'll be ready to buy Commodore's Rom Kernal  
Reference Manuals.  In three months, we'll be seeing your demo 
programs on  BBS's.  Within the year, some of those programs will 
be developed and  debugged enough to go version 1 commercial.  If 
you think this is  unrealistic, think again!  This is highly 
realistic, if you *want* it bad  enough!
 
Did I say C ?  Shoot!  Write it in Amos, Assembler, E, Blitz Basic, 
Modula 2,  Oberon... ARexx if you must!  Just get started!!!
 
If we will rise up out of our dependency mode and take the steps 
necessary to  FLOOD the market with quality Amiga software 
offerrings, the Amiga will  ascend from the depths of obscurity to 
become a major computing platform  contender.
 
If this does NOT happen...
 
Do you understand that even if CBM became marketing Wizards 
tomorrow; even if  our existing developers suddenly focussed on the 
weak areas; EVEN IF Apple  and IBM applications WEREN'T catching up 
to us in video, animation, and  entertainment, we would STILL be in 
an extremely weak situation?
 
But if we DO awaken, stretch our horizons, and meet this challenge, 
I'm  telling you that even if Commodore never put forth another 
marketing effort;  even if existing developers did nothing new (God 
Forbid, by the way!); even  if Apple and IBM continue to make 
inroads into our strong areas (highly  likely), we could STILL win, 
due to our sheer size and momentum alone!
 
Let your mind consider, for a few moments, what the impact would be 
if only  five percent of us bought into this vision...
 
The Amiga would literally be born again, in a marketing sense.
 
Listen - we've got the machine... we've got the zeal... And, it's 
not too  late in America yet; we STILL have the opportunity!  And 
while you're at it,  develop for PAL mode - And you, our European, 
Australian, and New Zealand  friends, develop for NTSC!
 
The choice is ours: we can continue to whine and cry about lack of 
support  (adding to the vicious cycle), or we, the special people 
who fell in love  with the Amiga, can begin to do the one thing in 
our power that will  significantly make a difference.
 
Thank you for considering my ideas... now get to work!  I expect to

%% Commodore Shareholder's Movement - Update                           %%
%% CSM and the CBM Sharholder's Meeting in Nassau                      %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

March 2, 1994

Nassau, Bahamas - "We are not a rubber stamp board of directors," 
replied Commodore Chairman Irving Gould to an accusation by computer 
dealer, Jeffrey Moscow.

By this time during the 1993/94 Annual Shareholder Meeting of 
Commodore International, board members had been repeatedly questioned 
on counts of inept management - for having led this NYSE issue to a 
net loss of $356 million for FY93.  Only two years earlier, Commodore 
enjoyed annual net sales in excess of one billion dollars.

Shareholder equity is now about (negative) -10.78 per share and 
Commodore owes over $50 million to banks in 18 different countries.  
The banks are putting the pressure on Commodore to repay, and 
Commodore is trying to avoid legal actions.

The meeting which was four months overdue was held this March 2nd in 
its usual location, the exclusive Lyford Cay Club in Nassau, Bahamas 
where Commodore holds its incorporation.  

There was no repeat of the scene of November, 1991 when a dissenting 
shareholder was physically ejected from the meeting, but passions were 
nonetheless running high.  At one point, Moscow asked General 
Alexander Haig - one of Commodore's five directors - to encourage 
Irving Gould to step down in the same way he had admirably done so 
with a certain US President.  Someone has to take control, insisted 
Moscow; nothing is going to improve under current management, he went 
on.

For about a half-hour, Gould, Moscow and shareholders parried comments 
on Commodore's ailing situation and prospects for recovery.

Commodore is an international company which manufacturers the Amiga - 
the most popular model home computer in Europe and the host to many 
professional video products in the United States - for instance, the 
Video Toaster which has revolutionized the video industry.  Commodore 
also recently introduced CD32, a 32-bit game machine which is becoming 
a hit in Europe.

At the annual meeting, shareholders contended that perpetual mistakes, 
including inadequate supply of products during consecutive Christmas 
seasons, was responsible for the losses, while Commodore blamed the 
effects of soft economic conditions in Europe, their largest market.

But whatever the cause of Commodore's problems, everyone at the 
meeting agreed that something needed to be done - perhaps new 
management or a grass-roots marketing campaign tapping into the 
enthusiasm of the Commodore base of customers as suggested by Michael 
Levin.  Levin described himself as a spokesperson for these customers 
- many of whom have and are still actively becoming shareholders.  The 
only thing being asked of Commodore was leadership.

The lack of confidence in management was demonstrated by the 
shareholder defeat of a proposed amendment to Commodore's articles of 
association.  This amendment would eliminate shareholder checks 
concerning large decisions such as mergers and sales of company 
assets.

Another point raised at the meeting was Commodore's urgent need to 
resolve its debt and recover credibility so that it can become a 
player in the emerging interactive television market.  In this market, 
programs and software will be downloaded by service providers into 
cable-box-like devices sitting on top of peoples' televisions.  
Commodore, the shareholders insist, must become the supplier of the 
boxes or the core technology going into compatible boxes supplied by 
other manufacturers.

"On the surface, every one of our objectives was met for the meeting," 
stated Marc Rifkin, a shareholder attending the meeting with proof of 
the thousands of customers and shareholders backing his cause.  "We 
don't think our warning fell on deaf ears; we now have an open line to 
Irving Gould, and he seems willing to listen.  That is the critical 
first step."

What happens next?  Rifkin replies that either Commodore starts taking 
the steps necessary to survive, or they don't.  The first sign will be 
whether Commodore brings in someone who can deal with the daunting 
financial and marketing challenges, as well as working with the Board 
of Directors.  Previous attempts to find such a turn-around artist 
have ended in debacles, most notably, an ex-Pepsico executive, who 
cost Commodore a $10 million lawsuit, and current president, Medhi Ali 
who led Commodore during its recent decline.


Commodore Shareholder Movement Announcement, March 2, 1994

We were at the shareholder meeting, and we were not alone.  Various 
Amiga dealers whose livelihood depends on Commodore's success were 
also in attendance.  Some spoke along with us while others silently
observed the proceedings.

Our message was clear; things are not rosey.  Consistent and basic 
mistakes led Commodore to where it is, and as anyone can plainly see, 
continuing these mistakes will lead to ruin.  They must not miss their 
one chance to make a comeback through the interactive television 
market.  This relies on partnerships which Commodore has seemed unable 
to form.  The situation is urgent.  Commodore must leverage what 
resources it still has, including the activities of those customers 
who still carry the torch.

Irving Gould met with us after the meeting to discuss what might be 
done.  It seems that Gould is willing to listen and is concerned about 
the message which is reaching the users.  If there is a solution to 
Commodore's situation, it must start from the top.  We hope to offer 
Gould a solution which he will find favorable and will best benefit 
the interests of the Commodore shareholders and customers whom we 
represent.

Keep your letters coming.  Keep them concise and focus on what things 
you might do to help.  Most importantly, spread the word.  The 
assumption is that Commodore and its computers represent a tradition 
worth keeping.  We can not do this alone.  Others must become active 
leaders in the cause.

PRODUCT NAME

	Stardust, version unknown


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

Blow up rocks!  Asteroids on steroids!  Explosions!  Chaos!  Mayhem!
A modern version of the classic "Asteroids".  Gameplay fully updated and
modernized, with cool graphics and sound.  Awful copy protection, though.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

	Name:		Bloodhouse Oy, Ltd.	Bloodhouse UK Ltd.
	Address:  	P.O. BOX 40		Bromley Lane
			00331 Helsinki		Chislehurst, Kent BR7 6LH
			Finland			England


LIST PRICE

	$49.95 (US); it can be had for about $27 (US).


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

	HARDWARE

		1 Meg Agnus required.

		Must boot in PAL mode.

		Works fine on my 68000/68030 based, accelerator-equipped
		machine.

		Reportedly works well with a basic 68000-based machine.
		Does not work at all with a 68040-based machine


	SOFTWARE

		None.  Chris Hames' "Degrader" may come in handy for you,
		though.  Get it from Fish Disk 866.  It allows you to boot
		in PAL mode on an older Amiga like mine.


COPY PROTECTION

Disk based.  Not hard disk installable.  This game uses a terrible
copy protection track loader scheme.  May the programmer never create
another program again.  The world will be better off.  If you want to save a
game, it will attempt to save it on disk 2.  It comes on 3 disks; all of
them are copy protected.  Stupid.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

	Amiga 500, 4 Megs 32-bit Fast RAM, 1 Meg Chip RAM.
	CSA MMR 68030 Accelerator w/FPU  (ran it on 68000-only mode, too).

	Supra SCSI controller.
	157 Megs of Hard Disk space.
	AmigaDOS 1.3


INSTALLATION

	None.

REVIEW

	I bought this game from a poor soul who couldn't get it to work on
his A4000.  Well, it works fine for me, but it took a little hacking 
about. At first, I tried to get it going on my stock configuration.  It 
ran the introduction just fine, but when it finally got to the main 
map-screen (where you select your missions), the screen had some 
horizontal lines spaced regularly down the left 1/3, and it would not 
respond to any input. So I finally got it to work by doing the A500 Fatter
Agnus PAL hack - a hardware switch which allows me to boot in PAL mode. 
Then I discovered Chris Hames' Degrader program, and that allowed me to 
boot in PAL mode without any hardware hacking.  I guess those of you with
newer Amigas don't have to worry about it.  But make sure you boot in PAL!

	Here is what it's like: You put your Disk 1 in and boot up.  An 
intro screen comes on that was shamelessly borrowed from Star Wars.  In 
it, words scroll up telling some silly story about how these rocks are 
out to destroy the universe.  You can press the joystick button to 
continue on immediately, but watch the whole thing the first time.  
There's some animation in there that's cool.

	After a few minutes of disk grinding, an options screen is
displayed, and you can make some selections.  You can decide if you want
the music on or off, how many lives you get (3, 5, or 7), and a few other
little details.

	Then you press the joystick button, and you get to the 
"map-screen." I will try to describe it... really it's much simpler than 
what I've been able to write.  Your ship is a little sprite.  There are 
5 rectangles on the screen, each one representing a "world," and your 
ship is in the rectangle on the upper left.  As you move your ship left 
and right, up and down within the rectangle, you see on the bottom of the
screen a brief description of the "level" - its difficulty rating, any 
special enemy ships present... that sort of thing.  So you position your 
ship over a level you want to go into, and press the joystick button.  
Your ship spins around, the disks grind, and soon you find yourself in an
asteroid field.  But such an asteroid field!  I don't know how they did 
these rocks, but they look great.  Apparently they're all texture mapped,
ray traced images.  They really look nice.  Your job, of course, is to 
get rid of them.  So you shoot at everything and anything that moves.

	Just like in real Asteroids, the rocks blow up into smaller and
smaller pieces.  Finally, you blow away one of the smallest pieces.  You
may or may not get a little token.  The token is labeled, and it gives you
bonus things - maybe a faster gun, an extra life, some points, more 
shields, more "energy" (you lose energy whenever you collide with 
something), etc.  If you die, you lose a little bit of your gun speed.

	Once you clear a level, you are back on the map screen.  There you
can select another level.  Once all the levels are clear, a mother ship
comes to get you.  You destroy the mother ship (it's not so easy), and 
then you are done with that "world".  A "W" icon appears on the map 
screen in your rectangle.  You move over to it and press the joystick 
button.  Now you "warp" to the next level: your ship spins around, floppy
disks grind, and soon you are heading down some sort of tunnel.  Rocks 
and mines are zooming past you.  Your job now is to avoid the mines and 
avoid or (preferably) destroy the rocks.  It's not too hard to get through
the tunnel, but it is somewhat hard to get through AND destroy a decent 
number of rocks.  Again, the graphics here are excellent.  How did they 
make those realistic-looking asteroids come towards you and grow 
gradually larger like that?  Nice job.

	Some levels have weapon transports.  If you kill them and pick up
the icon that's left, you get different weapons.  Some of the weapons have
different abilities and/or a higher overall speed.  For example, each shot
of the basic gun shoots three bullets simultaneously in a small fan
arrangement.  The next weapon available to you is a bouncer, and though 
you get only one bullet with each shot, the bullets bounce.  It also has 
a higher available firing rate.  The next is the "plasma" gun.  I'm not 
sure yet if it's better or worse or what.  It seems like a regular gun, 
with maybe a higher available firing rate.

	Eventually you'll die, and Stardust will tell you how horrible you
are at playing the game.  If you've gotten far enough, when you get back 
to the options screen you will see a code.  Write that down; when you 
start the game again in the future, you can get to the warp tunnel just 
prior to the "world" you died in by typing in that code.  You will come 
in with the same number of lives that you had at the time you originally 
did the warp level. That's nice, so you don't have to start all the 
lower levels again.


DOCUMENTATION

	A small manual, written in English, Francais, Deutsch, Italiano, 
and something else - Finnish, I think.  It covers the basics, but there's
not much necessary for a game like this.  I wish it explained what the 
little numbers on the left side of the screen are for:  they appear when 
you are in the meteor-blasting screen.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

	I like the graphics and the sound.

	One nice thing about real Asteroids was you could have 5 bullets 
in the air at once, but they came out as fast as you could shoot.  This 
gave you at least a feeling that in an emergency, if you needed to shoot
fast, you could.  Stardust's gun is sluggish.  What a drag.  That's the 
one gameplay criticism I could make of the game.

	I like not having to start over all the way after I die.
  
	I really, really, really HATE that trackloader (copy protection).  I
want to be able to install the game on my hard disk, or at least run
something from s:startup-sequence before the game comes up (like "pal" by
Nico Francois).  I wish they'd used key disk copy protection at worst.  
Disk 2 is used the most, and I wish I could copy it, because it won't 
last too long the way the game makes it spin constantly.
  
	You must un-write-protect one of the disks to save the high 
scores. I don't like that either.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

	As games go, it's pretty good.  Compared to the original 
Asteroids, Stardust's graphics and sound are generations better.  The 
ship is frustrating to control because you just can't always blast off a 
quick bunch of shots in an emergency, like you could with Asteroids.  
But in every other respect, Stardust is light-years ahead of Asteroids.


BUGS

	AUUGH!  DAMN!  Lousy, lousy loader.  It's fast enough, sure, but 
you can't put the game on hard disk, the floppies spin endlessly, and my 
disks sound like they're going to give birth to a cow.  Some guy named 
"Wanton" was supposed to have programmed the loader.  He needs a spanking,
badly. And the company deserves a verbal lashing for accepting it.  I 
haven't seen a gross disgusting loader like this in years.  Of course, 
I'm not normally a shoot-em-up gameplayer.  But I wonder what the 
publisher is thinking when they sell software with these "features"?

	Reportedly does NOT work on the A4000.

	REQUIRES that you boot in PAL mode.  I didn't have a hardware
switch on my A500, so I installed one to get it to work.  But then I 
found Degrader, and so I'm a little happier.


VENDOR SUPPORT

	Unknown, for they are in England and I am in Chicago.


WARRANTY

	If your disks go bad, send them to Bloodhouse along with 2.50 
pounds UK and they will replace them.  At least, that's what they say.


CONCLUSIONS

	Explosions!  Destruction!  Chaos!  Rocks!  Stardust takes Asteroids
a step further with cool graphics and sounds.  After a while you get used to
it and the game play still is... pretty good!  It's fun.  Rating: ***+
AmigaWorld gave this game an "A" rating, but it was a pretty quick review.
They didn't even mention the compatibility problems with the Amiga 4000. 
To me, I can give a product a solid "A" only if it demonstrates 
consideration for the customer.  Stardust's trackloader is a big slap in 
the face:  it's as bad as the game itself is good.

Subject: AR ads....
Status: RO

  Hey! I guess the personal ads are an ok idea as long as they don't get 
too long or carried away. The size doesn't matter as I use a high-speed 
modem. It's just that AR wouldn't be as enjoyable if it got too cluttered.
  
  Good luck with the magazine. I think it's looking great so far! I know
Robert Glover when he lived here (in chattanooga) when he came up with 
the idea. I've seen alot of people slam him for abandoning the platorm. 
I say to each his own! He was known for jumping from system to system at
a whim. (Only had his Amiga a year after bailing from Atari.) So it 
wasn't much of a surprise to us here. But I still had to defend him for 
the concept and time he put into it and it helped bring the Amiga 
community closer together. And all on his own time with no profit. 
(That's what I was trying to get across to the grumpers on FidoNet.) I'm
glad he didn't just take it with him and let it die. They should give 
him that eh? He was gracious enough to hand over AR. 
  I'm also glad that you stepped forward and agreed to takeover. Without
support and helpfulness the Amiga community wouldn't be! That's what 
really sits us aside from the other platforms. Friendly support. We ban 
together.
  So good luck with the magazine and I know it's a thankless job and 
time consuming. And I for one am very greatful and look forward to each 
issue! Long live the Amiga, it's users, Amiga Report and it's editor!!

  Whew! Don't know what got into me! :) You know what.. you are free to
include the above in an issue of AR if you want. Call it a contribution.

I was reading AmigaReport 2.08 and found this in the MS-DOS Blues

Any AAA machine - or the CD64, if it ever exists, will be able to play
99% of CD32 games.  Even though most of these games use the AGA
capabilities, they go through a library called specialfx.library which
is basically a hardware independent copper list generator (and other
effects).  Therefore, when a new chipset is released, a new version
of specialfx.library will be made, thus making all "old" software
compataible.

I think that any CD32 game using post-ECS features is forced to use
the specialfx.library due to the cd-developer license.

There are many commercial magazines that are quite well known to 
Amiga users. Here I wanted to talk about two magazines or 
newsletters that might not be as well known, but deserve the 
attention of the Amiga community.

The first is Geoffrey William's Computer Artist & Videographer 
Report, which is often presented as "The CAV Report". 

Geoffrey Williams is a long time writer for the Amiga, and has 
written articles for several magazines.

The CAV Report entails a monthly 6-page newsletter containing the 
latest news, business forecasts, and helpful advise. Subscribers 
also receive a monthly disk. Each disk covers something specific 
on graphics or video. All text is in a hypertext interface, and 
also includes useful freely distributable software. All set up and 
easy to use.

Quarterly the subscriber will receive HyperMedia Journal. 
Hypermedia Journal is filled with articles, tutorials, and 
reviews. Much of which is interactive. (See AR208)

I found the CAV Report to be a great addition to the Amiga 
community. Geoffrey's commentary is insiteful, and truthful. His 
articles give down to earth news that even those not interested in 
video related topics can enjoy. 


The second newsletter is called, XPress - The Amiga CAD 
newsletter. Like The CAV Report, this newsletter comes both on 
paper and on disk. XPress is for those of you who don't have a 
resource into using CAD software on the Amiga. XPress is filled 
with interesting articles, and is nicely complimented with 
pictures, which make the tutorials much more interesting and 
useful.

XPress is interesting enough for the professional and the casual 
user of @{"CAD programs" system "display dynacadd-2d.iff"}. XPress details what you need to do a 
project, and how to use make the most of what you have.

XPress is published quarterly. As stated each issue contains a 
disk or freely distributable software, sample drawings, demos, 
@{"IFFs" system "display xcad-world.iff"} and more.


I sincerely suggest you take a look into both of these 
newsletters. Both are extremely well done, and can fill in the 
gap, where the commercial magazines fail to go.

	Comes on three 880K floppy disks.


COPY PROTECTION

Look up a set of symbols in the manual.  This is a one time lookup
every time you load up the game.  The symbols are very easy to find in the
manual.  All three floppy disks are copyable.

The program installs on a hard drive.

Booting from the original disk is not required.  A long intro
sequence on disk 1, once seen, can be bypassed by loading off disk 3 (for
disk-based users) or selecting the appropriate icon for hard-drive users.

Once the game is loaded, the game disks/hard drive is not accessed
again because the game is saved into Fast RAM (unless user has only chip ram).

I rate the copy protection as "acceptable."


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

	Amiga 2000, 68000 CPU
	1MB Chip RAM, 2MB Fast RAM
	30MB Hard Drive
	AmigaDOS 1.3


REVIEW

	The Settlers is based on the "play god" genre of games like
Civilization.  The Settlers begins with a charming intro and then the
password screen.  At the first menu screen, players may choose among 30
missions (which must be passed one at a time before the password to the 
next mission level is given), 5 tutorials, a demo mode, and normal
"design-your-world" gameplay.  In "normal" gameplay, action takes place
on one of 270 billion worlds chosen by the player with a 16-number
combination.  There are 10 computer-controlled competitors to choose 
from. Players can choose from various sized worlds depending on amount 
of computer memory.  After making these choices, a mouseclick on START 
begins the game.

	The beginning screen displays a small section of the world.  
There are mountains, deserts, lakes, hills, and prairie land.  Moving 
around the world is accomplished by moving the mouse while holding down 
the right mouse button.  The Settlers is entirely mouse-driven.

	Your first task is to find a suitable plot of land (with the 
help of your land appraiser) to set up your main castle.  Opposing 
computer players do the same; and from then on, it is a race to conquer 
all of the land.

	The game is intensely involving.  Roads are built leading to
proposed buildings the player wishes to be erected.  Soon, small settlers
come pouring out of the castle to carry out your directions.  These are 
no normal settlers; these small fellows walk around, scratch their 
heads, carry supplies, and lead simply fascinating lives!  So absorbing 
are the actions of these settlers that I often find myself watching them
carry gold or bread from one building to the next, or watching a 
woodcutter chop down a tree. There can be anywhere from 500 to 64000 
0settlers depending on the size of the world.  The player is in full 
control of everything that is built. Supplies may be limited, so the 
settlers will need to be instructed how to make their own supplies.  
There is a different settler for every job; for example, there are 
carriers, ferrymen, construction workers, bakers, farmers, miners, 
forester, and butchers, to name just a few.  Guard-rooms are built to 
expand the boundaries of the players land, as well as serving as the 
source of an attack on neighboring rivals.  One may choose between 23 
buildings to erect and 26 resources/tools to produce.  Winning is based
on good strategic placement of buildings and road networks.


ARMS

	As in any "land-conquering" game, there are soldiers.  They may 
have 5 different ranks, and the player can control where the best 
fighters go.


OPTIONS

	There are options enough to satisfy even the most neurotic game
player.  There is a global map that the player can look at, indicating 
the presence of roads, the landscape, and the areas occupied by each 
player. Here the player will notice that the game world is overlapping -
that is, a player can proceed in any one direction and he/she will come 
back to his original location.  Other options in the game include many 
data graphs indicating the success rate of the player versus his 
opponents in terms of land ownership, fighting success, and total 
housing assets.  Players can choose which resources have precedence 
and which buildings should be built first.  Some of the added options 
include switching from the in-game music (with half the sound effects as
well) to full sound effects, special mouseclick options, and even 
volume control from the screen.


TWO-PLAYER MODE

	Two players can play The Settlers, either in competition against
each other (in combination with other computer players if desired) or as
a team working for the same goal.  In two-player mode, the main game 
screen will split in half, giving each player control of his/her half of
the screen. Necessary icons are all still there, just squeezed together 
more to fit in the smaller width.  The split screens are a little 
cramped, though acceptable, myself being used to the nice wide view 
during one-player mode.


DEMO ON AMINET

	There is a fully playable demo on the Aminet ftp sites, available
to users with ftp access.  I strongly suggest anyone considering this 
game to try out the demo first if possible.  The demo is similar to the 
version being sold, except it lacks many of the options, music, some 
added graphics, any tutorials, any missions (and any documentation for 
that matter), and of course, any ability to save games.

	That's the general gist of the game.  Hours and hours of 
absorbing gameplay.  There are literally a hundred other touches to the 
game that I have not discussed here, but I will leave that to the joy of
the buyer to explore.


DOCUMENTATION

	The Settlers comes with a full-color reference card depicting 
all the possible buildings, jobs, resources, and tools.  It also comes 
with a very useful, 135-page instruction booklet.  The documentation is
of good quality, with helpful icon pictures from the computer screen 
throughout the booklet, and it also gives a lot of useful strategic 
hints for how to do well in the game.  There is information on how to 
install the game onto the hard disk.  There is a table of contents.  I 
personally found the instructions regarding the second knight menu 
(displaying morale) to be lacking, leaving me unsure as to which icons 
on the screen the booklet was referring.

	The documentation includes notes for beginners who have never 
heard of the terms "Chip RAM" or "Fast RAM", and for experts of the 
CLI-Workbench interface.


LIKES AND DISLIKES/BUGS

	Ah - this is my favorite (and most important, IMHO) part - my
impression of the game.  First, I should note that the game is fully
playable without reading the instruction book at all.  The game is quite
enjoyable when the player jump in and experiments with all the different
icons and tools (of course, after having backed up the game).  This is a big
plus.  The fact that the game can hold your attention for months on end 
is also a big plus (I guess that's one reason why Role Playing Games are
so popular).  I also like the multitude of options the game offers, the
charming in-game music (that repeats every 20 minutes or so), the sheer 
size of the game, the beautiful graphics, and, most awe-inspiring, the
settler-people.  I am still in awe over how my 7-year old Amiga can keep
track of 8000 little settlers all doing their own thing.  Flags wave, 
water sloshes, and the swoosh of a light breeze can be heard.  The sound
is excellent (there's simply no end to it).

	Now the parts that I didn't like.  Well, let's just say that 
Blue Byte never made a true NTSC version of The Settlers (not yet, 
anyway).  Yes, that means that if your video output is normally NTSC, 
you're going to have to boot into PAL mode using "palboot" (and to do 
that, you are going to need at least a 1MB Fat Agnus chip).  That isn't 
such a big problem, however.

	Secondly, when running off floppy disks, the game simply won't
recognize disk 2 in drive df1:, not being able to validate the disk.  
That basically nullifies the need for 2 disk drives.  That isn't a 
problem if you have any Fast RAM in which to save the game program; but 
if you don't, then you may have to do some disk-swapping.  Otherwise, 
not a problem.

	I also have a slight disaffection for the game's saving method.  The
game does not allow previously saved games to be deleted.  This becomes 
a larger problem when you realize that the game also fails to indicate 
whether there is enough room on the storage device for the game being 
saved.  Often, I have tried to save the game, only to be told halfway 
through that there is insufficient room.  Then, I scramble to find more 
empty disks (yes, I play off the floppy disks despite having a hard 
drive), because the game doesn't allow for the initializing of disks.  
My suggestion:  definitely make sure you have room for a saved game 
before playing (i.e., 880K will be more than enough for any size 5 world
game).

	My suggestions to the developers of Blue Byte GmbH are favorable:
correct the game-saving concerns, perhaps make an NTSC version, and maybe
throw in some female settlers.  After all, it is hard to imagine a stork
arriving at the home castle every 2 seconds in the game :)  Overall, an
excellent game.  A sequel is inevitable, like Psygnosis' Lemmings series.
Perhaps a "year 2010" setting?  Whatever it is, I'm sure it will be
excellent.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

	The only other program I have had contact with similar to The
Settlers is Civilization by Microprose.  Both games are examples of the
conquest and world domination form of gaming, and fine examples are they
both.  However, Civilization's icon system has been replaced by real-time
horde of moving, acting, workers in The Settlers.  Civilization, however,
plays further ahead into time (the space age).  Nevertheless, The Settlers
scores higher in my book.

	I just have to add in a quick note about The Settlers and Hired 
Guns by Psygnosis just because they are both excellent examples of their
respective genres.


CONCLUSIONS

	Overall, I'd have to give The Settlers a 96% rating out of 100 
(see DISLIKES/BUGS).  It is best game of its class in the Amiga market 
right now.  As an infrequent software consumer, I would certainly 
consider further similar products from this German company.

	If you like Civilization, or have any hidden urges to dominate 
and control, you'll love The Settlers for its influence power.  If you 
like to knit (no offence) or play with Play-Doh, then you'll love The 
Settlers because it's so cute.  I can't think of many who would not 
like The Settlers.

	In no way am I affiliated with Blue Byte GmbH.  I am solely a
satisfied customer.

I didnt know how to get a question posted, but heres my message...

HELP!

I own a Maxtor Tahiti 1 optical drive. I have it connected to an Amiga 
4000/40 via a A2091 SCSI controller. however, Im running into a problem:

   The system recognizes the drive just fine. Using HDToolbox, it 
returns the drive manufacturer, and type. however, it continually 
reports "CANT FIND DEVICE SIZE!"... After calculating out the cylinders
and setting the head/ cylinder count, I proceed to low-level format the 
drive. The drive spins for about 45 minutes, and at the end of the 
format the heads retract, however the whole system is frozen at the 
FORMATTING, PLEASE WAIT screen.

HELP WILL BE APPRECIATED!!!

Greetings.

As a new Network user I've been reading your AR-mag for the last 
couple of weeks and I certainly enjoy reading it. There is a question 
lingering in my mind for some time now and I think that you or the 
readers maybe able to answer it.
Being an Amiga-amigo for 8 years now, I've never come across a certain 
kind of hardware - an I/O card. You know the type: multi-channel A/D,
a handful of timers and loads of digital I/O lines. While the PC 
world is flooded with this kind of hardware, most if not all of the 
Amiga hardware (add-ons) is dedicated to sound and vision. 
So I've started to make my own I/O card. Still I wonder, have I 
missed something here or are there really no commercially available 
I/O cards for the Amiga (perhaps because nobody wants one) ?


Keep up the good AR-Mag.

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

	2.3

AUTHOR
	Mika Kortelainen
	Petajatie 13
	FIN-35100 ORIVESI AS.

	email: k125374@cs.tut.fi

DESCRIPTION
	Lines is a simple but addictive game where the sole purpose is to draw
lines on a 2-D grid.  Every line consists of five points of which at least
four has to be existing but unused in the direction of that line (the
allowed directions are horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).  The initial
board has a cross-shaped figure from where the playing starts.

	System friendly, works on all Amigas with OS1.3 or above (might work
with OS1.2, too).  Both the NTSC and PAL versions are included.

REQUIREMENTS
	A mouse :-)

HOST NAME
	Aminet, e.g. ftp.luth.se (130.240.16.3)
	Also on ftp.funet.fi

	ftp.funet.fi: /pub/amiga/games/misc/Lines-2.3.lha

PRICE
	Shareware, requested fee US $5 or 20-30 FIM (Finnish marks).  An
equivalent amount in other European currencies accepted, too.

DISTRIBUTABILITY
	Freely distributable if no more than a nominal copying fee is asked.
Copyrighted by Mika Kortelainen, 1992-1994.  No commercial distributing is
allowed without my written permission.  PD librarians such as Fred Fish may
distribute Lines on disk and/or CD-ROMs.

OTHER
	As the documentation states, I do not send registered users anything
(this archive contains everything that is needed), but by paying the fee
you will help me to spend my time to develop Lines further and to release
those updates to the public.  If you don't like this policy, don't pay!

@node P5-2 "VoiceShell v1.19"
@toc "menu"

TITLE

     VoiceShell

VERSION

     1.19

AUTHOR

     Tomi Blinnikka

     Internet: docbliny@mits.mdata.fi

DESCRIPTION

     VoiceShell is a voice recognition utility. It allows 
     you to start commands just by saying the command into a
     microphone.

     VoiceShell is a replacement for VCLI by Richard Horne. 
     It also uses the voice.library by Richard Horne. 
     VoiceShell, however, doesn't have a graphic display of 
     the spoken word and thus is faster than VCLI.

     With VoiceShell you have full control over the supported
     samplers, including the GVP DSS 8. You can now choose between
     left/right input channels, microphone or line level, input 
     gain etc...

     VoiceShell also has an ARexx port to allow almost full 
     control over VoiceShell from external programs. You can
     even send ARexx commands through VoiceShell itself, allowing 
     you to control VoiceShell with voice commands!


NEW FEATURES

     This version has some bug fixes over the last release 
     (version 1.11). It also allows longer filenames, can wedge 
     keystrokes as if they were actually typed, can run special 
     commands on errors, and has a few other small imporvements. 
     VoiceShell is now a comodity.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     The program requires Kickstart 2.04 or higher. A sampler, 
     i.e. audio digitizer hardware, is of course needed. VoiceShell 
     supports Perfect Sound, Sound Master, GVP DSS 8 and generic
     (i.e. almost any other digitizer) samplers. The voice.library 
     is also required and included in the archive so you won't have 
     to worry about this.

     The documents are in AmigaGuide format, so in order to read 
     them you'll need an AmigaGuide reader.

     There is an install script included, so you may use this to 
     install VoiceShell if you have the Commodore Installer program
     on your system.

     The archive is freely distributable.

TITLE

     MultiVol(TM) (Demo Version)

VERSION

     1.01D

     Phone: 206-246-6077
     email: augmentek@acm.org

DESCRIPTION

     A freely-redistributable demo version of MultiVol.

     MultiVol(TM) splits and joins files. The split files can be placed on
     diskettes, hard disks (including removable), or RAM -- or any
     combination of them. Splitting and joining are transparent to a
     program, so almost all programs that use files can split a file on
     output or join split file parts on input, without "knowing" that
     splitting or joining is occurring.

     This is a "crippled" demo version, severely limited in the size of
     files that can be split and joined. A split file part can contain up to
     127 bytes. Utilities for renaming and listing split files, the
     graphical user interface, and comprehensive online documentation are
     not included. The commercial version is virtually unlimited in file
     sizes, and includes the items excluded from the demo version.

FEATURES

     Both versions can:

     *  split a file to diskettes or removable hard drives

        Other Amiga owners or service shops can join the file parts WITHOUT
        MultiVol.

     *  join files with or without MultiVol
     *  reuse ARexx(TM) procedures

        MultiVol will join your procedures to the main program in a way that
        looks like one complete file to ARexx.

     *  spread a file across the remaining disk space on multiple disks
     *  control splitting by remaining disk space, percentage of available
        disk space, exact byte amounts, or percentage of original file size
        (if known)

     *  discard parts while splitting or joining
     *  delete split file parts

        Joining will create a file of only the retained parts.

     The commercial version can also:

     *  split a large file
     *  download a file too big to fit on one diskette to multiple diskettes
     *  assist you via hypertext documentation (AmigaGuide included)
     *  facilitate using MultiVol via a select, point, and click interface
     *  list and rename split file parts

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     *  AmigaDOS/Kickstart(TM) 2.04 or higher

PRICE

     The demo version is available at no cost, and is available at the
     location listed below.

     The commercial version is US $40, plus any applicable tax and shipping
     charges.

New users can call and get ANY copy of Amiga Report.  These are considered
"free" downloads, they do not count against any file ratio.  The latest issue
of Amiga Reports can be Freq'ed (FileREQusted) from here as "AR.LHA", as "AR"
