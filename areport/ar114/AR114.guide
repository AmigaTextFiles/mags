    ----------------------


Welcome to the first AmigaGuide issue of Amiga Report!  I hope you enjoy it.
A lot of initial testing and thought has gone into the layout, and this is
what we've come up with.  The design and implementation was done by Robert
Niles, part of the Technical staff.  We will continue to improve the design,
and certainly open to suggestions.  The majority of AmigaGuide codes have been
placed at the very end of the issue, to maintain readability by normal ASCII
readers.

In last week's issue, I mentioned two programs to help combat the new F_ck
virus in a sideline of the Press Release about that virus.  These two programs
are not approved by Safe Hex International, but have been tested and are what
they claim to be.  Michael Arends of SHI/West wanted me to make it clear that
they do not endorse those programs, and I want to make it clear that they do
what they are designed to do.  He says they hope to have an 'official' virus
killer with support for this horrible new virus available soon.

We have added another BBS to the Official Distribution Site list.  Please
welcome the Cloud's Corner BBS as another site where Amiga Report can be
found as soon as the issues are available.  This board is fed Amiga Report
immediately after the Headquarters board, Nova, receives it.  I'm working on
getting some sites in the UK and Europe, as our sysops have been reporting
calls from Germany, Australia and Spain.  If we can setup sites overseas,
that will help reduce phone bills for these people.  If you are a BBS
operator overseas with an internet Email address or CompuLink account, and
would like to be a distribution site, please send me Email.

Lastly (but certainly not least), the Amiga staff on Delphi is going to try
to revitalize the area by again having weekly informal conferences.  The
next one is scheduled for Thursday, July 1st at 10 pm Eastern Time.  If you
have a Delphi account, BE THERE.

TWO COMPUTER EXHIBITIONS HELD IN TOKYO

TOKYO, JAPAN -- Two large computer exhibitions -- Network '93 and Windows
World Expo -- were/are being held held in Tokyo.

Network '93 has just started at Harumi, Tokyo. This is the second year the
show has taken place and, as you can guess from its name, majors on
network-related products, including both hardware and software.

A total of 87 companies are participating in the show this year, including
NEC, Sony, Fujitsu, IBM Japan, Oki Electric, Novell, Microsoft, Lotus and
Phoenix International. The majority of the products on show are local area
network-oriented, with a smattering of Windows applications.

As with all exhibitions of this type, the real focus of interest was on the
conferences. Several industry leaders, including Microsoft's Toru Furukawa and
Novell's Jan Newman, were on hand to answer delegate's queries. While Furukawa
discussed the era of "corporate resolution for Windows," Newman explained
Novell's business strategy for Netware version 4.0.

IDG World Expo, meanwhile, hosted Windows World Expo at the Makuhuri Messe in
Tokyo last year. This is another show celebrating its second year, with 67,400
people -- twice those of last year -- flooding the show site during its three
day run. Newsbytes notes that a total of 119 companies were exhibiting from
593 booths at the show this year.

The major highlight of this show was, unsurprisingly, Windows-related packages
such as Japanese Windows 3.1, Windows NT, Windows for Workgroups, Windows for
Pens, Windows for Video and Modular Windows.

The hands-on section of the exhibition had between 50 to 60 PCs on constant
display. 27 overseas companies teamed up to create the International Pavilion
at the show entrance. The foreign companies were keen to talk to distributors
interested in stocking their products.

At the keynote address, a tape of Microsoft's founder Bill Gates greeted the
audience. The real Furukawa from Microsoft, meanwhile, introduced Japanese
Windows 3.1 and Pen Windows.

CANADA'S NEW TELECOM ACT ABOUT TO BECOME LAW

OTTAWA, ONTARIO, CANADA -- Royal assent may be given today to Canada's new
Telecommunications Act, which would replace 85-year-old legislation and
unify a fragmented regulatory structure.

A spokesman for the federal Department of Communications confirmed that the
act has been passed in the House of Commons and gone through third reading in
the Senate, and is expected to be proclaimed very soon.

The bill asserts federal jurisdiction over telecommunications across Canada.
In the past many regional telephone companies were provincially regulated,
while others were regulated by the federal government.

Some provincial phone companies have accepted federal jurisdiction in the past
three years, since a 1989 court decision that said the federal government had
the right to regulate all telecommunications companies. That decision included
companies owned by lower levels of government, but said Ottawa must first
assert its authority in law. The new act will meet that requirement.

A hole in the legislation gives the province of Saskatchewan -- which owns its
own phone company and has staunchly resisted federal regulation -- five more
years before it comes under federal control.

Joseph Schmidt, president of the Canadian Business Telecommunications Alliance
(CBTA), a lobby group of major telecommunications users, criticized this
provision, saying it gives the province "five more years to shut out
competition."

But Schmidt said his group is pleased with the law over all, and accepts that
some compromises were necessary.

The CBTA sees the bill as promoting competition, Schmidt said. It "will help
bring about a truly national dimension in communications," he said, and will
give policy-makers new tools with which to do their jobs.

The Information Technology Association of Canada (ITAC), also supported the
bill. A statement from ITAC said the law "acknowledges that we are on the
threshold of major telecom transformations, and that Canada intends to be a
leader in telecom internationally." It also moves toward a more open domestic
market, ITAC said.

The original law, introduced in February, 1992, would have required all
telecommunications carriers in Canada to obtain licenses from the federal
government. It has since been amended to remove the licensing provision,
instead giving the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission
(CRTC) authority to enforce a rule limiting foreign ownership of licensed
carriers to 20 percent.

Earlier, Toronto telecommunications consultant Eamon Hoey said the 20-percent
limit on foreign ownership would effectively shut out foreign investment,
since no investor would want to pour money into a venture in which it cannot
hold a controlling interest.

This is bad, Hoey said, because "we don't have enough investment dollars in
Canada ... to build the kind of facilities we're talking about." The result,
he predicted, will be that no new telecommunications competitors will appear.

Under the new law, the CRTC would also be allowed to decide not to regulate
areas of telecommunications where it judged there was enough competition to
serve as an alternative to regulation.

ZENITH DATA INTROS MONITOR THAT GOES TO SLEEP

BUFFALO GROVE, ILLINOIS -- Zenith Data Systems will introduce at PC Expo in
New York next week a new computer monitor that goes to sleep during periods
of inactivity to lower the level of power consumption.

The company claims that the 15-inch Super VGA multisync flicker-free display
unit offers resolution up to 1024 horizontal by 768 vertical pixels and is
intended for graphical applications, desktop publishing, layout work, or other
environments where users have to look at the display for long periods of time.

Called the ZCM-1540, the non-interlaced monitor automatically switches to
lower levels of power consumption when not in use. ZDS says any application
that has the capability to blank the screen, such as Microsoft Windows, or
the multitude of "screen saver" software available commercially or from
public access bulletin boards can automatically switch the monitor into its
standby mode.

The company sats that energy consumption can be lowered by as much as 30
percent, or to less than 30 watts in the standby mode. That makes it eligible
for the Energy Star designation, a voluntary standard for computer equipment
makers established by the US Environmental Protection Agency.

After a further period of activity the 33 pound ZCM-1540 switches into a "rest
state" in which it uses only eight watts of power. A touch of any key on the
computer keyboard restores the monitor to full activity.

ZDS spokesperson John Bace told Newsbytes features include 0.28 dot pitch,
auto synchronization, auto-sensing of the power voltage being supplied,
support for five different resolution modes, and conformation with both US
and European standards. The latter is particularly important, says Bace.

The US Federal Communications Commission and European regulatory agencies have
established emissions standards, with some of the European standards being
particularly tough. "The European and world-wide regulatories are absolute
killers when it comes to monitors. This unit meets the Swedish and Norwegian
standards. To be able to clear those Scandinavian regulations in particular is
very difficult, and this unit does," he said.

Price hasn't been established yet, but Bace says it will be about the same as
other 15-inch color monitors.

IT'S CHAPTER 11 FOR COMPUADD'S RETAIL DIVISION

AUSTIN, TEXAS -- Compuadd Computer Corporation announced this week that it has
filed a voluntary Chapter 11 petition in order to settle claims by its
creditors resulting from the phasing out of the company's retail stores.

Several months ago Newsbytes reported that Compuadd planned to close all of
its 110 US. retail outlets and sell its product through the direct market
channel, using telemarketing and catalogs.

Compuadd CEO Bill Hayden said that the company has tried for three months to
reach an out-of-court settlement with creditors such as landlords and
suppliers on claims that resulted from the discontinued retail operations.

"This process was consuming an unacceptable amount of management attention
that, when coupled with a substantial increase in our core business, a strong
backlog, and the need to preserve the company's 435 jobs, made bankruptcy 
court protection the most orderly way to run our business in the short term,"
Hayden said.

"Strategically, we had to leave the market-place to focus on our core
business.  In turn, we incurred liabilities we could not meet or resolve in an
out of court settlement. Our direct marketing sales are strong, our customer
and employee commitments will be met in a business-as-usual manner, and we'll
begin shipping a new generation of products next month. We're mounting a full
court press to emerge from Chapter 11 as quickly as possible," he added.

Compuadd claims that it will continue to fulfil customer commitments and
expects to emerge from bankruptcy protection following the filing of the
requisite reorganization plan as soon as possible. The company said its
European unit is not expected to be affected.

Compuadd spokesperson John Pope told Newsbytes: "The toughest challenge in a
situation like this is to get over the negative connotation. This is clearly
not that type bankruptcy; it's a reorganization. We are putting together a
plan and have every confidence that we will emerge quickly."

Major creditors in addition to owners of the property in which the stores were
located include Lexmark, IBM, Texas Instruments, and Samsung. Pope said the
inventory of the stores has been consolidated in Dallas and Austin, Texas and
Tulsa, Oklahoma for liquidation.

Details of the plan are still in draft stage, said Pope, and no specifics are
available, but he told Newsbytes that the plan is expected to be submitted
"very soon."

The company says it completed the closure of its retail store division last
week. Calls to the closed store's phone numbers are now automatically routed
to Compuadd's headquarters in Austin.

SOFTWARE PIRACY YET TO TAKE OFF IN INDIA

NEW DELHI, INDIA -- India seems to be the odd country out in Asia as far as
software piracy is concerned. While the rest of Asia is reknowned for piracy,
a report just out from the Business Software Alliance (BSA) says that India
is very much in the minor league as far as piracy is concerned.

The news will a welcome relief to the Indian Government, which has been
steeling itself against a strong set of trading rules from the US Government.
Reports from the US suggest that the US might take punitive action against
India under its anti-piracy legislation.,

According to the BSA, a not-for-profit association of major software vendors,
around $12,000 million a year is lost in the software industry globally. Of
this, around $5,400 million is lost in Asia, with China on its own accounting
for $200 million in lost income.

The losses due to software piracy in Europe and the USA, meanwhile, amount to
$4,500 million and $1,900 million respectively.

The BSA's reports also indicate that, in 1992, about 99 percent of the total
software sold or used in Thailand was illegal. Japan came next down the list
with 92 percent followed by 86 percent in Spain and 62 percent in Germany.

India's contribution to piracy losses seem negligible, judging from the simple
fact that it does not figure in the BSA table.

PACKARD BELL & ZENITH ANNOUNCE ALLIANCE

CHATSWORTH, CALIFORNIA -- Packard Bell and Zenith Data Systems have announced
a strategic alliance. The two companies say Packard Bell's expertise in
desktop computers and ZDS's expertise in notebook computers will complement
each other in a manufacturing economy of scale and in the distribution
channel, meaning lower prices for the consumer.

While no specific numbers were mentioned since Packard Bell is a privately
held company, ZDS says it has purchased a 19.9 percent share in Packard Bell
as part of the agreement and will be represented on Packard Bell's board of
directors. ZDS is a subsidiary of Bull, a company whose primary shareholder
is the French Government.

ZDS President Bernard Pache said he expects the alliance to increase the sales
volume of ZDS notebook and subnotebook personal computers (PCs) through
Packard Bell's wide distribution network in the retail channel. Packard Bell
boasts 1992 sales were $930 million with shipments up 40 percent and a 60
percent increase in unit sales over 1991. Before the ZDS alliance, Packard
Bell estimated sales in 1993 would top $1.2 billion. International Data

ZDS claims that its sales were $900 million world-wide in 1992. In addition,
ZDS was recently awarded the Desktop IV contract from the Air Force which
entails the purchase of 300,000 computers at an estimated cost of $800,000.
The company said that the alliance with Packard Bell will offer it additional
opportunity to produce and service the Desktop IV contract.

Both companies are expecting to leverage their buying and manufacturing power
together to cut costs. Packard Bell President Beny Alagem denied that Packard
Bell was simply looking for an infusion of cash after its failed initial
public offering (IPO) last year. Alagem said the IPO didn't happen because
the price of the stock was unacceptable to the company's board of directors.

While the core of the computers developed in the deal will be the same,
Packard Bell and ZDS say they plan to retain their own labeling, although ZDS
will supply Packard Bell with private label versions of its notebook and
subnotebook PCs. Consumers can expect to see products developed as a result
of the alliance as soon as September of this year.

FIRST CD-ROM ON MARS

NEW YORK -- If there are any Martians on Mars, they may be able to read all
about the way we have envisioned them throughout the years, thanks to a
CD-ROM project being created by a US/Russian research alliance.

The Planetary Society, in cooperation with the Russian Space Research
Institute (IKI), will create Visions of Mars, a CD-ROM collection of science
fiction stories, and have slated it to travel to the red planet aboard Mars
94 when it is launched to Mars next year. The probe is slated to be launched
by Russia in mid to late 1994.

Visions of Mars will be a collection of science fiction stories, sounds and
images on a compact disc that chronicle humanity's fascination with Mars and
its imagined Martians from H.G. Wells to the present day. A copy of the disc
will be placed inside each of the two small stations that Mars 94 will land on
the surface of the red planet in September, 1995, say organizers.

The stations will not contain a CD-ROM drive, unfortunately, says Carols
Populus, speaking to Newsbytes from the Planetary Society Headquarters in
Pasadena, California. "The CD-ROM will have to be built, or saved from the
past," he suggested. "It's really a time capsule to ourselves."

It is still unclear as to whether the disc will be sold commercially or a
limited number of discs will be made for this one event, he added. The flight
disc and CD-ROM replicas will be produced by Time Warner Interactive Group
(previously Warner New Media) in Burbank, California. The CD-ROM will be
designed to play on both Apple and IBM computers.

Dr. Carl Sagan, president of the Planetary Society, at the news conference in
New York, said: "Before our technology caught up with our dreams, the way to
Mars was described by the great writers of modern science fiction. Those who
built and operated the first robot explorers of Mars, the Mariners and Vikings,
and those who are now designing new missions -- for robots and for humans --
often recall how they were motivated by science fiction. The first adventures
of space exploration were some mix of fiction and reality, interacting in the
minds of the spaceflight pioneers.

"Now, in 1993, we are preparing the first mobile robotic explorers of Mars,
and human exploration of Mars is becoming more and more feasible. It seems
appropriate to place a collection of these works on Mars -- as a motivation
and memento for future explorers there. These will be the first volumes in
Visions of Mars."

A label on the exterior of each lander will announce in five languages what's
inside and how to play it. A microdot on the surface of the disc will contain
additional technical information about its operation.

At the press conference to announce the disc, the editors issued a special
call for additional submissions from non-English speaking countries. All
stories will be recorded onto the disc in the language in which they were
written.

The disc will also include a portion of the Orson Welles radio broadcast of
War of the Worlds that panicked thousands of people when it aired on Halloween
in 1938; an audio recording made the night that the Viking I lander made the
first successful landing on Mars, featuring reactions from Gene Roddenberry,
Robert Heinlein, Ray Bradbury and others; and brief messages to the future
inhabitants of Mars from key figures such as Arthur C. Clarke.

A portfolio of artwork will feature images from classic science fiction
stories and films as well as works of astronomical art. Artists include Kelly
Freas, Frank R. Paul, Frank Frazetta, Chesley Bonestell, Andrei Sokolov and
Robert McCall.

ATARI ESTABLISHES MARKETING FOOTHOLD IN FINLAND

HELSINKI, FINLAND -- Atari is attempting to gain a marketing foothold in
Finland, having seen its previous efforts to establish a distribution network
in the country hit problems.

According to the Finnish media, previous attempts to create a network of
distributors in Finland were hampered by financial problems with the
importers, as well as arguments over distribution rights.

This time around, Atari has enlisted the help of Ion Finland, part of the
Lauri Valjakka group, which will import and market Atari's entire range
of computers and games consoles into the Finnish consumer market.

The only exception to this is the Falcon 030 multimedia computer, which was
unveiled in Europe at the Cebit computer show last March. This machine will be
handled by SLO Viestinta, another Finnish company.


                      ------------------------------


SPECTRUM HOLOBYTE TO MERGE WITH MICROPROSE

ALAMEDA, CALIFORNIA -- As part of a larger trend within the entertainment
software industry towards consolidation, Spectrum HoloByte has announced
its intention to merge with fellow game-maker MicroProse.

The deal, worth an estimated $10 million, is not yet completed, although
the companies hope it will be finalized by June 30.

A report in the Washington Post says that the two companies combined would
account for about 17 percent of the market for computer games, excluding
cartridges for video games such as Sega and Nintendo. Spectrum holds about
four percent, while MicroProse has about 13 percent.

However, MicroProse is cash-strapped and posted a loss for 1992. According to
the Post story, Spectrum has already invested $1 million into the company this
week, and will put the other $9 million in next week.

Spectrum stands to own about 60 percent of the merged company, with MicroProse
shareholders owning the rest.

The Post report says that MicroProse owes an estimated $3 to $5 million to
Signet Bank, and the bank has agreed to extend a line of credit to the company
for daily operations while the merger negotiations continue.


                      ------------------------------


MAXIS RAILROAD SIMULATION GAME ADD-ON

ORINDA, CALIFORNIA -- One of the most popular hobbies in the country is model
railroading. Probably no one knows how many basements are filled with the
complex multi-level model train layouts that include scenery, towns, people
and vehicles.

Some of those enthusiasts choose to do their model railroading on personal
computers, and that's where companies like Maxis come into the picture. Maxis
publishes software that makes you the owner of your own private railroad
company, and all that's required is your personal computer.

Now the company has announced a Macintosh version of its A-Train Construction
Set, software that allows the railroader to customize his or her terrain.

Features of the add-on software include the ability to remove items such as
buildings or animals from any scenario or saved game, or start from scratch
with a blank screen to build the city of your dreams. You can also accumulate
trains, track, land, buildings, even money, or sculpt the landscape to suit
your playing strategy or aesthetic sensibilities. You can add mountains or
valleys, lakes or rivers, forests, farms and crop fields, and operate as many
as 27 trains simultaneously using A-Train.

Since A-Train is a game, you can also give your computerized competitors
assets such as airports, ski resorts, or sports stadiums, then compete
against them in business.

A-Train is a US version of a game originally published in Japan in 1990 by
Artdink, based on a series of games that began in 1986. Maxis says the game
has sold over 50,000 copies since its US introduction by the company in 1992.
Maxis also publishes A-Train and the construction set for IBM-compatibles
and Amiga, and supports Soundblaster, Sound Master, Adlib, Roland, Tandy,
Macintosh and Amiga sound cards.

The A-Train construction set for Apple Computer's Macintosh has a suggested
retail price of $34.95, and requires a Macintosh A500 or above and two floppy
drives or a hard disk. Other system requirements include Workbench 1.3 or
higher, and one megabyte (MB) of system memory for low resolution monitors.
The company says you need at least 1MB of system memory and 512 kilobytes
of fast memory for high resolution monitors.

TINY AT-COMPATIBLE ON A CARD

TOKYO, JAPAN -- Seiko-Epson has developed an IBM PC/AT-compatible card as
small as a regular credit card, but with all the necessary features of a
PC/AT packed onto a tiny board. The firm claims it is the smallest
PC/AT-compatible card in the industry.

Seiko-Epson's PC/AT-compatible card contains Intel's 80386SL processor, an I/O
controller, a VGA controller, a 1-megabyte DRAM and a flash memory. Also, this
card has a 236-pin connector which Seiko-Epson is trying to push as an
industry standard.

Called Cardio386, the card is slated for release by Seiko-Epson in October.
The retail price is expected to be around 400,000 yen ($3,600). Total shipment
is anticipated to be around 100,000 units per month.

Seiko-Epson is targeting this PC/AT-compatible card at factory automation
firms as well as personal computer companies on an OEM (original equipment
manufacturer) basis.

Seiko-Epson is planning to release an 8086-based PC/XT-compatible card and an
80486-based DOS/V-compatible card in 1994.

             THE TANDY Z-550 ZOOMER PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANT
                    Innovative, Ingenious, Revolutionary.

Available This Fall At Participating Radio Shack Stores and Dealers Nationwide

Consumer Electronics Show, Chicago -- Tandy Corporation unveiled today the
Tandy Z-550 Zoomer PDA, a "personal digital assistant" which combines the
simplicity of pen and paper, the logical power of a computer and the ability
to connect to the world in a pocket-sized device weighing less than one pound.

"The Zoomer PDA is a significant new electronics product for all consumers. it
saves your handwritten notes, recognizes your printing and offers a keyboard
on demand to intuitively organize your personal information, simplify complex
calculations, translate languages, retrieve reference material and talk to
your PC.  It is affordable and, unlike portable computers, it has a long
battery life, off-the-shelf batteries and is much lighter to carry," said
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John V. Roach.

The Tandy Z-550 Zoomer PDA is the much anticipated product jointly developed
by Tandy, Casio, Inc., and four major software companies -- GeoWorks, Palm
Computing, America Online and Intuit.  The technology was first introduced
under the code name "Zoomer" at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in
January.

Weighing just under one pound and operating up to 100 hours on three standard
"AA" batteries, the Tandy Z-550 serves as an electronic "note pad" and
includes a date book, address book, bank book, calculator, dictionary,
thesaurus, world clock, language translator, and more.  It also includes three
entertainment (game) applications and a reference section for U.S. city and
state information, nutrition guide, U.S. and international dialing codes, and
other useful information for people "on-the-go."

The Tandy Z-550 also has a personal finance manager which provides complete
money management features for recording cash expenses, bank account trans-
ctions and credit card spending.

The Tandy Z-55O has patented features called Powerlink and Backspaceink which
allow data to be entered and edited much like a "pen-on-paper."  he user can
choose three different ways to enter information:  text entry by simply
tapping the Zoomer pen on a pop-up style on-screen keyboard; electronic ink,
for handwritten notes, sketches, or drawings using the pen; or, text trans-
lated through handwriting recognition.  Electronic ink and text can be mixed
freely in notes, lists, sketches, maps or other fields and applications.

Built-in infrared transceivers provide wireless communication between one
Tandy Z-550 and another unit, allowing information to be transferred without
the use of cabtes.  In addition, an RS-232 compatible serial port allows
information to be transferred to a personal computer, printer or other serial
device.

By using an optional modem, users can retrieve up-to-date news, weather, stock
quotes, and other valuable information by connecting to the America Online
information service.  Electronic mail can also be sent and received.

The GEOS operating system that powers the Tandy Z-550 Zoomer PDA is open so
third-party companies can easily develop add-on software applications and
hardware options.

The Tandy Z-550 is built around a custom lntel®-compatible chip. It has one industry standard PCMCIA (Personal Computer 
Memory Card International Association) 2.0 card slot for third-party 
applications, storage, memory expansion and add-on peripherals such as 
pagers and fax modems. The unit has also three additional front-panel controls 
that can be used by party software developers.

Its rugged, clamshell design has round edges and a hinged cover over the LCD
screen.  The cover can be folded back 360 degrees to provide a comfortable
support when rested on a flat surface.  The dispiay measures 4" x 3.2" (HxW),
and the unit itself measures just 1" x 4.2" x 6.8" (HxWxD).

Priced at only $699, the Tandy Z-550 Zoomer Personal Digital Assistant will be
available in October at participating Radio Shack stores and dealers nation-
wide. The Tandy Z-550 has a one-year limited warranty.  Extended warranty
plans, service and support are provided by Radio Shack

Tandy Corporation is America's pre-eminent retailer of consumer electronics
and personal computers.  Radio Shack, a division of Tandy Corporation, is the
largest U.S. retailer of consumer electronics and personal computers with
nearly 6,700 outlets nationwide.

ASDG ANNOUNCES SOFTWARE SUPER-BUNDLE
 
  
We are considering creating a ``super-bundle'' which will contain several
ASDG products together at a reduced cost.  To help us determine if we
should invest resources in new packaging for the ``super-bundle'', we are
test marketing the idea via electronic networks.

Included in the bundle are:

Product                                 List

Art Department Professional             $299
Pro Conversion Pack                      $90
Morph Plus                              $295
ProCONTROL                               $90
T-Rexx Professional                     $249

Total                                  $1023

All of these products together (in their full form but without their usual
packaging) are being test marketed for a combined price of $395.  This test
will conclude on July 31st, 1993, and is available to end-users only.

Art Department Professional and MorphPlus need no other introduction.  The
Pro Conversion Pack adds comprehensive support for the TIF, TGA, RENDITION,
X, SUN, and PICT file formats to both ADPro and MorphPlus.  ProCONTROL is
an alternative user interface/scripting environment for ADPro and
MorphPlus.  T-Rexx is a powerful Toaster system integrator and is such a
flexible scripting environment (with built-in command sets for many
programs including ADPro and MorphPlus), it is very useful even to people
without Toasters.

If you're interested in this bundle, give Gina a call at (608) 273 6585 for
an exact price including shipping.

FTP SITE NO LONGER IN OPERATION

The FTP site at amiga.physik.unizh.ch is no longer available for download
access and will soon disappear completely. The reason for this is the
excessive amount of bandwidth the site used (we *told* you to use the
mirrors). Aminet will probably survive, although we haven't found a
suitable replacement for our site yet. Uploads should go to ftp.luth.se
for now, but this site is *not* going to be the new Aminet center.
Whatever comes, don't expect full functionality from Aminet within the
next one or two weeks.

  -Urban D. Mueller, Chris Schneider
   (Former?) administrators of Aminet

PS: Do *not* try to log in. We've already had 13,000 attempted logins today,
    which shows how many people tried to force their way into amiga.physik
    using scripts.

@toc "menu"

UUxT v2.0 AVAILABLE FOR FTP


TITLE
         UUxT 

VERSION
         2.0

AUTHOR
         Asher Feldman, asher@shell.portal.com  or  Wizard0@cup.portal.com

DESCRIPTION
         UUxT is an update to UUx 1.0.  UUxT is the ultimate 
         uuencode/decode utility for the Amiga.  Uuencoding is 
         the process of converting a binary file into ASCII, so that 
         it may be transmitted over a text, or "mail only" network 
         such as the Usenet.  Many files are posted to the Usenet daily, 
         but the must be uudecoded before you can use them.  UUxT 
         makes the task of uuencoding and decoding simple, with its 
         amiga style command interface.  You can even LhA and uuencode 
         multiple files in a single step.  (And vice-versa)  (LhA is a 
         popular compression program/format that allows you to compress 
         and archive multiple files)  Also, UUxT will decode 
         uuencoded files with multiple mail headers and other 
         garbage in them.  So you can download multiple part 
         archives off the Usenet, and decode them without 
         editing out all the headers.  UUxT also allows you to decode
         multi-part archives without joining all the parts together
         first.

NEW FEATURES

         - Now allows you to encode multiple programs into a single 
           uencoded file.                         

         - Decodes all files in a "multi-file" uuencoded package.

         - Ability to decode "multi-part" (split) uuencoded files, without
           having to first join them together.  The separate parts can even
           be on separate volumes, allowing floppy users to decode larger
           files.

         - Bath decoding.  UUxT can now decode multiple uuencoded files at
           once.

         - Greatly improved status messages, and improved command line error-
           checking.

         - No longer asks if you want to overwrite an exsisting file.  I liked
           this feature at first, but it got annoying so I removed it.  I plan
           on putting it back in the next version, along with a "QUIET"
           parameter.

         - The 68030 version has been removed.  The new decode routines are
           optimized and have caught up with the 030 version.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
         LhA by Stefan Boberg is required to use the LhA specific
         functions.  UUxT works under all amigados revision.  
         
AVAILABILITY
         litamiga.epfl.ch (128.178.151.32) and all other Aminet sites:

From the Amiga RT on GEnie
--------------------------


From Sahib (A.SAHIBZADA) about his new accelerator...


Hi All!

I received the CSA 1250 (Twelve Guage) SCSI/Accelerator/Ram unit yesterday.

Here is my initial impression of it:

When I opened the box, I found the following :

A board with all the necessary electronics, a 25-pin SCSI plug (looks just
like a parallel port plug) with an attached cable, four sheets of photocopied
docs, a disk and a brochure.

The documentation is adequate, with all relevant information, though one
extremely important fact is missing : There is no mention of how to connect
the board end of the SCSI cable to the board. There is also no ReadMe file on
the disk though it has a number of utility programs.

I therefore have not connected the SCSI cable as yet, but will do so on Monday
after giving CSA tech support a call to find out the correct orientation of
the cable (one edge of it is red).

The 25-pin plug needs to be screwed into the empty socket on the back of the
1200. There is already a hole in the casing of the computer for the holding
screw.

The board itself is not difficult to install, and only takes a few seconds to
push into place. On one side is the CPU and FPU, etc. and on the other side is
a connector for a SIMM module. I have at the moment installed a 4 Mb SIMM in
this socket, though you can upgrade to 32 Mb.

System performance has improved remarkably. My computer is really flying now!

There is a program on the disk called T3 that copies ROM to RAM. This
increases performance even more, but at the expense of the loss of some Ram.

AIBB however reports that the MMU is disabled. No mention in the docs on how
to enable it. Any ideas? I'll upload an AIBB module for it in a day or two.

My overall impression of the board : Very, very good, but could do with much
better documentation.

From FidoNet's Amiga International Echo
---------------------------------------


Area: AMIGA                            (MAIL:Fido/AMIGA/)
From: Erik V. Petersen                 To: All                           
Subj: Good Amiga Press!                                                     
Date: 22 Jun 93  06:38:05


     Canada has a tabloid computer paper that I've always thought of as
a beemer rag with token Mac coverage to satisfy a couple of adverti-
sers.  It is published monthly on the West Coast (Vancouver) and the
Alberta edition generally runs 52 to 56 pages.  Circulation is pegged
at 125,000 in Western Canada and 80,000 in Ontario.  It is a freebie
paper that you pick up to browse when you've idle time on your hands. 
It has just bowled me over with GREAT Amiga coverage in the last two
editions!  This good happening may have gone on for longer but I've
only recently picked up the May and June issues.  Last time I looked
previous to then, it was pretty solid clone fare.

     Good Amiga coverage in a horizontal computer publication is a pure
act of courage.  Both magazines and the pulps are advertorial in natu-
re.  Advertising pays the shot and has been known to dictate contents. 
Editorial purity is rare.  The guys paying the bills have no ideologi-
cal generosity.  I didn't see ANY Amiga advertising in either the May
or June issues but I was only exposed to the Calgary editions.  One
must assume other regional Ami dealers pick up the slack.

     The Canadian Computer Paper is independently published.  It is
edited by Kirtan Singh Khalsa.  In the May issue, Graeme Bennett, mana-
ging editor ran the mine field with a 10,000-word article on operating
systems.  "Oh Yeah!" We say as we see OS/2v2.1; MS-DOSv6.0; Windows NT;
Windows v3.1; NextStep; Unix and Mac v7.1, but wait! Here's AmigaDOS
v3.0x, and what's more, we are getting a fair shake!

     Early on, Bennett proves he is historically up to date when he
says "The Amiga 1000 was the first computer to bring the power of a
true multitasking operating system into the hands of 'mere mortals'...
The fact that it could run on a 256K machine with no hard disk was
nothing short of amazing." 

     Under "Network Services" he could have crucified us since this is
a current weak spot but instead, Bennett generously comments: "Amiga
users might do well to consider adding a PC-emulating 'Bridgeboard' in
order to use IBM-compatible network cards and software..."

     Under printers, Bennett also is informed when he points out that
AmigaDos v2.1 and 3.0 provide direct support for PostScript.  The high-
ly detailed comparison chart also shows Ami support for Compugraphic
fonts,  and is generally correct and extremely fair to our favorite
pile of switches.

     Look and rejoice at Bennett's Miggy remarks under "Conclusion":

     "If you own or are considering an Amiga, I advise running AmigaDOS
2.1 or later.  Earlier releases of AmigaDOS were not as stable or fea-
ture rich.  AmigaDOs has more in common with Unix than DOS or Macintosh
operating systems.  Although it can be used without a hard drive, I
strongly recommend one.  The Amiga makes a good choice for a home com-
puter.  Kids and novice adult users can use it with a mouse at first
and move into the more complex world of command-line prompts and the
subtleties of true multitasking as their expertise grows."

     Some Mac types were spitting nails in the following June issue
because aspects of their OS had been termed mediocre.  That issue had
nothing short of a rave review (3,000 words) on the A1200; and a 3,500
word story on the Toaster 4000 with no attempt to hide the fact that an
Amiga 4000 is at the heart of this system.  More about that in a fol-
lowing post.

     Good Amiga press has been rare in recent years.  It is truly
heart-warming to see objective, knowledgeable reporting from what I
would have sworn was a clone bastion.

                    SAFE HEX INTERNATIONAL NEWS ALERT !!
                    ************************************

       TOP NEWS.." BOOTX " CONTINUES AGAIN!!!!!

  We Have now got the confirmation that Peter Stuer has agreed to let
SHI take over future support for his GREAT Virus checker/killer "BOOTX ".
Now there may be some problems starting out at first, things may be slow
BUT within a few months you SHOULD see a new update to BootX available
from your SAFE HEX INTERNATIONAL regional anti-virus center (hooray!!)

  Now comes a slight problem, ONE of the original reasons BOOTX support
was dropped was that no one was sending new viruses to the programmer. In
order for the resurrection of " bootX " to happen we have to get support
from everyone, in the way of sending NEW viruses to the anti-virus centers.
 PLEASE DO NOT UPLOAD new viruses to your SHI regional virus center  BBS
BUT instead send them on disk,marked "NEW VIRUSES" to one of the address's
below. As always,order forms for ALL SHI disks are available for download
at your SHI-RVC.  At this time they are not available for file request.

/// The Commodore Shareholder Movement
    ----------------------------------



               ATTENTION COMMODORE SHAREHOLDERS!  6/18/93

In response to the overwhelming thirst for information concerning
your rights as shareholders, the following information was obtained
from the Securities and Exchange Commission.  After reading it, you
will see the obstacles to the election of new Commodore Directors. 
Commodore is subject to Bahamian laws rather than U.S. federal and
state securities laws.  This gives the Directors a great deal of
power to deny shareholders their rights to include proposals in the
proxy statement, to obtain the by-laws and charter of the company
(necessary to know shareholder rights), and to obtain the list of
shareholders for communication purposes.  If you have experience in
these areas and would like to join the cause, please contact us:

                    Commodore Shareholder Movement
                            P.O. Box 8296

                     Information for Investors
         from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission

                    SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS TO VOTE

The corporation laws of most states, as well as company charters and
by-laws provide corporate shareholders with several important rights. 
Among these are the right to vote for the election of directors who
will oversee management of the company, and the right to vote on
matters as changes to the articles of incorporation or by-laws,
dissolution, and mergers with another company.  In each instance,
shareholders' votes may be critical to the future existence of the
company involved.

Prior to the annual meeting of its shareholders, the board of
directors of a company establishes a record date for purposes of
determining the shareholders who are entitled to vote at the meeting. 
This means that a shareholder must own the securities of the company
on that record date in order to be eligible to vote them at the
annual meeting.  Under the laws of most states, the record date must
be not more than 50, nor less than ten days prior to the meeting of
shareholders.  (in addition to the annual meeting, corporations
sometimes also hold a special meeting of shareholders).

Once identified, all shareholders entitled to vote are sent a proxy
form, which allows them to vote by mail on management or shareholders
proposals.  Unfortunately, many shareholders receiving such proxies
do not take the time to examine the accompanying material to
determine what corporate action they are being asked to vote for or
against.  They may later discover that the other stockholders had
voted to liquidate, merge or sell the company business.

While an individual shareholder's vote may not block a proposed
action, the proxy solicitation material does contain information
vital for shareholders to know in order to make sound investment
decisions.  For example, if you fail to read the terms of any
proposal or not, you may later discover that it is too late to
participate in an exchange or redemption offer and that you do not
have any remedies available to restore your ownership interest in the
company.

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") receives many
inquiries from investors who fail to receive notices of shareholders'
meetings or impending corporate proposals.  If you hold possession of
your own stock certificate, it is important that you make sure the
company has your current correct mailing address.  If, however, your
shares are held by a broker ("in street name"), you cannot vote
directly with respect to those shares since your name does not appear
on the company's records as a shareholder entitled to vote.  However,
brokers who hold securities in street name for their customers are
required, under the rules of the National Association of Securities
Dealers and the exchanges of which they are members, to forward to
the actual ("beneficial") owners, the material received from the
company.  The shareholders must then instruct his broker how he or
she wishes to vote.  Most companies take pains to furnish proxy
material promptly to brokers in sufficient quantity to permit them to
re-transmit the material promptly to shareholders in time for the
shareholders to respond.  Occasionally, however, shareholders fail to
receive the material in time for it to be useful.  This is one of the
reasons many investors prefer to have securities registered in their
own name rather than having the certificates held in street name by a
broker.

Questions concerning shareholders' votes may be addressed to the
Office of Consumer Affairs and Information Services, Securities and
Exchange Commission, Washington, D.C. 20549


                       SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS

Among the many rights of a corporate shareholder are the right to
elect the members of the board of directors of the corporation, and
the right to vote on the approval of certain corporate decisions. 
These rights are exercised at the annual meeting of shareholders
which is held in accordance with the laws of the state in which the
corporation was chartered.

At the present time, the statutes of all states contain provisions
which specifically cover the holding of an annual meeting of
shareholders.  For example, Section 28 of the Model Business
Corporation Act, applicable in most states, provides in part:  "An
annual meeting of shareholders shall be held at such time as may be
stated in or fixed in accordance with the by-laws".  In addition to
the election of directors, in most states, fundamental corporation
changes such as mergers, dissolutions or amendments of the articles
of incorporation are also required to be submitted to a vote of the
shareholders at the annual meeting.

Annual meetings -- and the process of soliciting proxies prior to
such meetings -- function as important means of communication between
management and shareholders.  The federal securities laws include
requirements dealing with the form and content of the communications
with shareholders sent in connection with an annual meeting.

First, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, if a proxy
solicitation is sent to shareholders on behalf of the board of
directors of a corporation for an annual meeting of shareholders at
which directors are to be elected, the proxy statement must either be
accompanied or preceded by an annual report.  This is an extensive
report on the company's operations and financial results for the
year, and is considered by most companies to be the single most
important shareholder communication published during the year.

In theory, shareholders attend annual meetings to listen to a report
on how the board and management have discharged their fiduciary
obligations during the past year, and, depending on what they hear
and have read in the proxy statement and annual report, elect
directors for the ensuing year.  Some investors do actually go to the
meeting for this purpose.  However, most investors, after reading the
material sent to them, choose to vote by proxy.  Therefore, the
election of directors is usually decided by proxy votes submitted
before the annual meeting takes place.

Even though only a few shareholders may actually attend an annual
meeting, many others do use the proxy mechanism to raise questions
and give their views on the company and its operations.  This may be
done in the form of a letter submitted to the company with the
returned proxy.  This period of preparation prior to the meeting
requires management to address and formulate positions on issues
which are of concern to shareholders.

The federal securities laws require that shareholders' proposals be
included in the proxy statement sent to all shareholders if they meet
certain tests.  Management may take a position with respect to such a
proposal and recommend that shareholders vote for or against it, or
it may submit the proposal for voting with no recommendation.

One of the most frequent questions from shareholders is "who may call
a shareholders meeting?"  The by-laws of a company generally indicate
who may call a regular or special meeting of shareholders. 
Occasionally, provisions governing the calling of meetings may be
included in the company's articles of incorporation.  In many states,
the manner of calling a meeting is fixed by statute.

If you have specific questions concerning shareholders' meetings, you
may wish to contact the Office of Consumer Affairs and Information
Services, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, D.C. 20549.


                       SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS

Many investors who buy stock in a company are unaware of the rights
which that ownership affords them.  The specific rights of an
investor may depend, however, on the type of stock they own, the laws
of the state where the company is incorporated, and the by-laws and
charter of the company itself.

Companies generally issue one or more of various types of securities. 
The most well-known are common stock, preferred stock, and
debentures or bonds.  Investors who buy a share or shares of common
or preferred stock are, in effect, actually buying an equity or
ownership interest in a company.  A debenture or bondholder is giving
the company a loan of his money to use as capital, in return for
which he or she may get a periodic interest payment which the bond
agreement may call for, and the face amount of the bond at maturity.

Under the company's by-laws and charter, the specific rights of
shareholders who own each type, or class, of security may differ. 
For example, a company's charter may specify that only the common
stock may have voting privileges, or that the preferred stock must
receive dividends before any dividend is paid to the holders of
common stock.  The specific type of payments and privileges of a
bondholder are also stated in the charter.  In addition, the charter
may state that if the company is liquidated, a bondholder would
receive payment before the common and preferred shareholders. 
Therefore, it is important for a shareholder to read the company's
by-laws and charter thoroughly to find out what his or her specific
rights are.

An investor should also be aware of the rights granted by the laws of
the state in which the company is incorporated (the state of
incorporation is shown on the face of the certificate).  Most states
provide that shareholders' rights shall include, among other things,
the right to:  (1) vote on questions affecting the company as a
whole; (2) hold a proportionate ownership in the assets of the
company evidenced by a stock certificate; (3) transfer ownership of
their shares; (4) receive dividends when declared by the Board of
Directors; (5) inspect the corporate books and records; (6) sue the
corporation for wrongful acts; and (7) share in the proceeds of a
corporate liquidation.  In addition to these, most states also have
laws pertaining to the type of corporate information to be given to
shareholders; the requirements of an annual meeting; and dissenter's
rights of appraisal for their securities in the event of a merger. 
While there is general uniformity in the various state laws
concerning these requirements, investors should not assume that the
commercial laws of one state apply to another state, and should,
therefore, look up the specific laws which apply to the company in
which they own stock.

The federal securities laws also provide investors with important
recovery rights when violation of the laws occur.  To enforce these
rights, shareholders must seek redress privately, either individually
or as a class, before the appropriate United States District Court.

If you have any questions concerning shareholders' rights, you may
contact the Office of Consumer Affairs and Information Services,
Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, D.C. 20549.



                 COMMODORE SHAREHOLDER MOVEMENT:  6/19/93


INTRODUCTION

The users of Commodore computers should be happy to learn that the
Commodore shareholders are finally taking action to solve the
company's chronic problems which have led to its current grim
financial situation.  Faced with the daunting barriers of Bahamian
law and an uncooperative Board, this movement which grew out of the
concern of shareholders, developers and dealers, is actively
enlisting the aid of the Amiga-user-base to support the effort.

THE MOVEMENT

The Commodore Board of Directors was warned at the 1991 shareholder
meeting,  "If things don't improve, Commodore will go out of
business."  It's a year-and-a-half later and Commodore's value has
plummeted, largely due to lack of leadership and poor management.  In
response a movement has been organized to replace the Board of
Directors.

THE PROBLEM

Commodore had the potential to become a 10 billion dollar-a-year
company back in 1985.  Instead, they went dormant with only sporadic
attempts to generate sales.  Now, Commodore is on the brink of ruin
and a community of people including shareholders, businesses and
customers have a stake in Commodore's survival.  Irving Gould, the
Chairman of the Board and C.E.O. of Commodore International Limited
is the greatest barrier to Commodore's survival.  Gould has eroded
the loyalty of their only reliable revenue source (the customer
base), driven Commodore into debt, and brought the company to the
edge of collapse (1993 3rd quarter disclosure).  

Meanwhile, Gould has compensated himself with annual salaries of over
1.7 million dollars, plus stock options and bonuses (1992 Proxy
Statement 3).  Shareholders who have already lost a great deal of
money stand to loose everything.  Commodore is also the sole source
of Amiga computers, a proprietary product in which many people have
invested.  These customers will be abandoned and possibly forced to
buy products less suited to their needs.  A top-caliber engineering
team will be broken up, many small symbiotic companies will loose
their market, and potentially successful products will never be
developed.

THE SOLUTION

The change of top-level management is believed to be Commodore's
only chance for survival.  This can be accomplished through the
election of new Directors.  The upcoming 1993 shareholder meeting
presents the chance to break Gould's stranglehold on the company and
to replace him with dynamic leadership.  A movement to nominate and
elect new directors is being organized.

Both Irving Gould and Al Haig are up for reelection to the Board of
Directors.  All shareholders should vote for the alternative
candidates who will become known in the following months.  Talks are
being made with some very exciting possibile candidates.  With Gould
gone, Commodore can start on its path to recovery, being led by
capable new Directors.  Without Gould, the remaining Directors will
likely step down.

BUYING STOCK AND VOTING

If the shareholder movement is successful, then Commodore stock may
have been a smart investment.  Many companies have come back from the
brink.  The purchase of stock will allow you to cast a proxy vote in
the upcoming election, or attend the shareholder meeting (at your
own expense).  In order to buy stock, contact a discount stockbroker. 
There will be a transaction fee which shouldn't be over $50.  Order
as many shares as you want.  To expidite the proxy voting process,
ask for the stock certificate to be sent to you.  Get your friends to
buy stock.  Ask for it for your birthday.  The process is easy and
any amount helps.  Just remember the risk if the effort fails. 
You'll at least have the satisfaction of being involved.  Watch for
the candidates and vote!

SPREADING THE WORD

If you buy or own any Commodore stock, contact us with your address. 
Send a letter or e-mail (MarcR@cup.portal.com).  Let everyone who
might care know what's going on.  Bring it up at the users' group
meetings and write articles for the newsletters.  Re-post this
announcement.  Talk about it on the electronic bulletin boards.  Call
talk radio stations.

BEHIND THE MOVEMENT

You might remember the recount of events of the 1991 shareholder
meeting where shareholders warned and pleaded with Commodore to
improve and market their computers.  This is the same meeting where
Irving Gould ordered the physical removal of a shareholder who
attempted to make a motion that the meeting be adjourned and
reconviened in the United States where shareholders could really
attend.  The current movement has grown from that Philadelphia group,
and now includes Commodore shareholders, developers, dealers, and
users from across the country.  All you have to do is buy or own
stock and contact us with your address to become a part of the
movement.  Please write to us at:

    This week, instead of the (un)usual AMIGA, I've decided to once again
slack off in my work.  Since I have now slacked off on exactly half the
articles which I've supposedly written, I suppose this type of column is
just as normal as the other type (whatever that is).  Well, anyway, in
the interest of being lazy, I now present you with a short story by Oswald
Crichton, little known brother of the author of Jurrasic Park, the book about
money-grubbing people made into a movie for real-life money-grubbing people.
Anyway, here it is.

        AMIGA PARK

        by Oswald Crichton


    The science of chaos is a fashinable theory which tries to describe the
instability in systems.  For example, if you flick a booger at the wall, it
will hit a different spot each and every time, because minute variations make
major changes as a system progresses.  After all, when butterflies fart in
North Dakota, President Clinton uses the bidet instead of toilet paper.  Or
something like that.  Look, it doesn't really matter, because unlike in my
well-known brother's opus, chaos has very little to do with the story (or
everything, if you believe chaoticians).  So lets get on with it.

    The time is the year 1999.  Amigas have been extinct for 4 years, and the
world has completely forgotten they existed.  Irving Gould was long ago
electrocuted while trying to interface his Norelco razor with his Juicemaster
in parallel.  The guy with the arab-sounding name, upon inheriting the empire,
quickly closed the company and liquidated, and received the company's net
worth of 12 cents, before tax.  The wonderful Amiga computer quickly faded
from the minds of even its most stalwart supporters.  All except one.

Sugdub Beebleflats, in 1996, began soliciting funds for his start-up
corporation, Computer Amusements, Inc. (CAI).  After many unsuccessful
attempts, he found his funding in a group of Meditteranean investors willing
to take a gamble at the company.  For many years Sugdub and his employees
worked in secret, and since much money had been spent, the investors wanted
outside opinions as to the feasibility of the project, so Beebleflats called
on certain individuals for a position paper.

    When Dr. Giant arrived on Isla Bibliotecha, he was astounded by its sheer
beauty.  The telephone lines were all fiber-optic, the transportation
completely automated, and there was a hook-in every 5 feet.  Oh, and the
scenery was ok, too.  Dr. Giant immediately turned to Beebleflats and said,
'What the hell are you doing here?'

    'I have purchased all that remained of Commodore-Amiga, and I have created
this wonderful park in order that the children of the world can come to enjoy
it, for only a few hundred a pop!'

    And then Dr. Giant stepped into the first building, and he was so amazed
he almost cried!  There they were, hundreds of Amigas, running the coolest
software ever to be seen!  There were virtual reality games with HDTV
graphics, and interactive moview where you actually acted and were responded
to by the computer characters, and that was just the first two areas!  The
park was over 10 square miles large, and, acoording to Beebleflats, every inch
was covered with the most technically advanced computer equipment and software
on the planet.

    But Ian Millcone wasn't as impressed.  'Don't you see what you're doing
here, Beebleflats?  This technology is the most powerful thing in the world,
and you're trying to contain it in one park.  Computers find a way,
Beebleflats, computers find a way!'

    'So you're saying what? The Amigas will migrate?'

    'No, just that this technology will not be contained.  You brought back
something none of us have heard of in years, and you expect it to be tamed. 
It will not happen.'

    'But,' Dr. Wuwu said, stepping in, 'what about the meltdown contingency?'

    'The what?' Dr. Giant said.

    'I've mechanically engineered the Amigas to have poor cooling properties. 
If they aren't kept at a constant 68 degrees, they will meltdown and be
useless!'

    'Aha,' Dr Giant said, 'Now what have you to say to that?'

    'Life, I mean Amiga, will find a way.' said Millcone.

    Just then the lights went out.  Everyone scittered around, nervously
finding their way to the exits.  As they were about to leave, the lights came
back.  'Check the tracking system!,' Beebleflats yelled to Nerdy, the computer
operator.  But Nerdy was gone.  'Now where the hell is he?' said Beebleflats.

    Nerdy walked up to the fax machine, and began faxing the blueprints for
the Amiga systems to Mark Benito in Coalsack, PA.  He stood there for many
minutes, nervosuly feeding the machine and trying to prepare the envelope
which would contain all of the wonderful programs for the Amiga. 
Unfortunately, just as he slipped the last sheet in, the fax machine went
bezerk and began sucking his hand through the machine.  No one is sure what
happened to him, but he's been seen in Egypt, Australia and the Netherlands.

REVIEW

        As a big Monty Python fan, I love a humorous game, and finally I
have found one:  Cow Wars.  The title itself intrigued me, to begin with.  My
first impression was that it may be something based on the many cows of "The
Far Side", but it is even better.  It is Artillery gone Monty Python!

        The game that this is based on, called Artillery, is an old game
that pits two players against each other, armed with cannons.  Each player
takes turns changing the angles on their respective cannons and blasting
cannon balls at the other player over a mountain.  Factors such as wind
speed and direction and the amount of powder charge will affect the motion
of the cannonball.  A very addicting game.  Now, it's better.

        Cow Wars uses the same basic rules and variables as the original
game.  But, instead of firing cannonballs, you are firing COWS!  Strange,
but true.  Complete with a resounding "mooooooo" whilst they fly over the
mountain towards their intended target.

        You have to fire and hit your opponent with three types of cows:
styrofoam, glass, and (of course) real cows.  The wind direction and velocity
change constantly and are monitored by a small flag at the bottom of the
screen.  The wind affects the cow types differently:  a styrofoam cow will
blow around more than a glass cow in a strong wind, and a real cow is not
affected as much as the other two.  The cannons themselves pace back and
forth on their respective sides of the mountain, making the positioning of
constant shots that much more difficult.  Both the maximum wind velocity and
the maximum distance that the cannons should travel can be controlled by the
user, or can be picked at random by the computer.  The size of the mountain
can be changed as well.

        Then there's the "fire penguin" (as if this wasn't strange enough
already).  He is an oversized penguin that floats back and forth above the
playfield, ready to intercept any airborne Holsteins that may come his way.
With a villainous laugh, he devours any cows that cross his path, making it
even harder to hit your target.

        Is this game impossible to play, you ask?  Not in the least.  It is
very playable, and it can be made as easy or as hard as you like.  The game
is set up as a two player-only game, but is a lot of fun to play by
yourself.  The fact that the other cannon moves around on the other side of
the mountain makes it a challenge to hit even if it isn't trying to hit you
as well.

        The program itself was written in Amos, the graphics done with DPaint
III, and the sounds were taken from a disk of Macintosh sounds.


DOCUMENTATION

        The documentation is well written and very complete.  


LIKES AND DISLIKES

        As for suggested improvements, the only one that I would suggest is
a true one-player mode with a computer-controlled opponent.


CONCLUSIONS

        I rate this game as a 9.8 out of a possible 10 points.

/// CENSORSHIP?  STR FOCUS!
    -----------------------
    Reprinted from STReport #9.24



               CENSORSHIP FIGHTS HEAT UP ON ACADEMIC NETWORKS
               ==============================================



Excerpt From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
Monday, May 24, 1993
Page B1


INFORMATION AGE/By William M. Bulkeley


     Has political correctness gone on-line in academia?

     Battles  are  raging over  freedom  of  speech in  university-oriented
bulletin boards,  one of the few places in academia that hasn't been racked
for years by this kind of strife.

     A mild-mannered microbiologist from Rootstown,  Ohio, has stirred up a
storm  among on-line  computer users  by devising  a computer  program that
automatically wipes  out  anonymous  messages  on  Internet,  the  nation's
largest on-line network, which is widely used by scholars.  He was offended
by an  anonymous  user  who posted  a  joke about  the  last words  of  the
Challenger space shuttle crew in a scientific discussion group.

     In other cases, Canadian colleges have blocked electronic  discussions
of sex.   A California  community college recently  suspended a  journalism
professor  for running  a computer  bulletin board  on which  male students
wrote messages that allegedly  harrassed a female.

     Many on-line veterans  complain that such actions threaten  freedom of
expression.   "This  shows how the  censors are  all among  us," says Larry
Detweller, a recent graduate of Colorado State University, who studies free
speech and  "hangs around the Internet," which is often seen as a prototype
for the information  highway that  the Clinton campaign  described in  last
year's presidential election.

     Such issues  are likely to increase  as the highway connects  more and
more computers -  especially if the federal government funds  it.  In fact,
Congress has ordered a study of whether electronic bulletin boards, on-line
services and  public-access cable  television are  being used to  encourage
"crimes of hate."

     For  some time now, commercial  on-line services such  as Prodigy have
used computer  programs that  automatically  delete messages  that  contain
certain  words.  Group moderators  who often guide  discussions on services
such as H&R Block, Inc.'s CompuServe also have the power  to remove hateful
messages as soon as they see them.

     But many volunteer-run  bulletin boards decline to control what people
write.  Legally, they aren't required  to play the censor:  Board operators
aren't  responsible for things  other people write  in the wake  of a court
ruling that CompuServe wasn't liable for what people wrote any  more than a
bookseller is responsible for the contents of the books it sells.

     These cozy volunteer communities, the electronic equivalent of Boswell
and  Johnson's   18th  century   London  coffeehouses,  police   themselves
informally.   People  who are offensive  or irrelevant are  shouted down by
"flame mail," a barrage of messages by angry users that  sometimes can even
overwhelm  an offender's computer.  Other times, the indignant wage "cancel
wars" in  which they send  commands to  cancel the foe's  message from  the
bulletin board.   On Internet, people  order their computers not  to accept
any messages from particular senders.

     But a few years  ago, users developed "anonymous servers"  - computers
connected  to the  network that  stripped away  the original  sender's name
before sending  it on Internet.   The capability was  designed to encourage
open  discussion among victims  of child abuse  or AIDS and  originally was
used in  only such groups.   However, a computer in  Helsinki, Finland, was
designed to send anonymous messages wherever the sender wanted.

     Some  of these  messages on  the "sci."  section of  Internet's Usenet
subsystem  ticked off  Richard  DePew, the  professor  of microbiology  and
immunology at Northeastern  Ohio Universities  College of  Medicine.   "The
anonymous  servers were breaking down  some of the  barriers and traditions
that keep the  Internet useful," says Dr. DePew, whose  battle was reported
in the Chronicle of Higher Education, a trade weekly.

     After  numerous on-line discussions  of the  anonymous-server problem,
Dr. DePew wrote a program he called ARMM for "automated retroactive minimal
moderator."    Although the  program ran  on  the computer  he  operates in
Rootstown  as a  local  node of  Internet, it  canceled  messages from  the
Helsinki computer to any sci. discussion group.

     As soon as  he activated it  in April, Dr.  DePew was flamed  by other
users,  illustrating the passion with  which people defend computer speech.
He was called a  "maddog (sic) on the loose  who needs to be sedated."   He
was called  a "rhinocerous (sic) ."   He was compared  to "a child-molestor
(sic) who goes out and re-offends immediately upon release."  He was called
an "ignorant petty tyrant."  Within 12 hours, he shamefacedly recalled  the
program, admitting he made a mistake.  He says he will never do it again.

     In  another  controversy,  bitter  debates  raged  at  many   Canadian
universities  last   year  over   three   Internet  discussions:      "sex:
bestiality,"  "sex:    torture" and  "sex:  bondage."    Some weeks,  those
discussions  were  dominated  by  legal scholars,  but  other  weeks,  they
included brutal stories and pictures of screaming women.  Several colleges,
including Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia, cut those
discussions off their computers.

     In the U.S., California's Santa Rosa Junior College recently suspended
tenured  journalism teacher  Roger  Karraker while  it  tries to  determine
whether  he's responsible for student  messages on a  school bulletin board
that he  operated.  The board has some  200 discussion groups that are used
by faculty and students.

     Earlier this  year, at student request, Mr.  Karraker started men-only
and women-only conferences in which users  had to promise not to reveal the
contents.  When  one woman  learned about what  allegedly obscene  messages
that  an  ex-boyfriend had  written  about her  on an  all-male  board, she
complained to  Mr. Karraker.   He immediately shut down  the conference and
banned the  students who  had broken the  confidentiality pact.   She  then
complained to  the college of sexual harrassment based on the messages, and
Mr. Karraker was put on paid leave.

     James Mitchell,  the college's personnel director, said  the leave was
"for  his own  protection" and  isn't  a punishment.   He  says that  under
California  harassment  laws,  "we had  a  situation  that  appeared to  be
serious."

     Mr. Mitchell says that if the item had been in a student newspaper, it
probably would have been protected under the First Amendment.   But outside
of student newspapers,  speech can  be challenged as  harassment, he  says.
Even if it was  written on a bathroom wall, and the  janitor didn't wash it
off, "we'd warn him" of the risk of harassment charges.

     Mr.  Karraker says that as  a bulletin board  operator, he's protected
just as booksellers are.  "This isn't publishing in the  sense that there's
an editor who knows everything that goes in," he says.

                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA or through Tymnet from anywhere in
North America.  If you have an account on another Internet-connected system, 
you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet programs, from anywhere 
in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users can now Telnet into
Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 - Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files, online, 24 hours a day.
   Portal has dedicated a 2.5 GIGabyte disk drive to the Amiga Zone.
   We have virtually unlimited space for files and new uploads.

   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.  Start downloading
   files with your first session on Portal. 

 - Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.
   Instead of stumbling around in frustration you can talk to the
   people who design your hardware, who write your software.

 - Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

 - Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.

/// A Sysop's Point of View
    -----------------------
    By Robert Niles


The hardest thing for a sysop is to make sure that the BBS does not 
just sit there and stagnate. If a BBS has no interaction of some kind 
between it's users it will unfortunately do do. Most sysops spend a 
considerable amount of time trying to keep the interest going. Getting 
new files, expanding the functions of the BBS, adding more "doors", 
whatever.

For myself, I give Ma Bell a fair amount of money and time to go out 
and seeking files of interest to my users. Each and every file has to 
be run, tested, checked for viruses, and then finally added to the
BBS for access by my users. This is imporant for various reasons.

It connects the users to the outside in a "physical" way, keeping 
themselves and their computers up to date. Of course users upload 
files, but not always as much as I figure they should. Maybe because 
of time restraints, lower speed modems, whatever. I'm sure they have 
their reasons, but the hardest thing for me to deal with is when I end 
up calling long distance and get a file that I later find that one of 
my users already had. I'm sure you can see the problem with this. It 
was money that could have been spent on something they don't already 
have.

It doesn't matter if the BBS is up to gather those who like hand 
crafts or build nuclear bombs... people like to communicate ideas. The  
message areas are the heart beat of any BBS. The transfer of these 
ideas is what brings people together. I've been on systems that talk 
about subjects from Electrical Engineering, to Labor and Marketing, to
Home Businesses, to Origami. The function of the sysop here is to make
these interesting enough to get users to chat about whatever the subject
is amongst themselves. To somehow get even the bashful "lurkers" to all 
of a sudden want to "say" whatever is on their mind. Actually this 
isn't always as easy as it seems. During lulling points, the sysop has 
to intervene, add something interesting and get things going again. 
The sysop has to answer questions (no user likes a sysop who doesn't 
reply), and interact with the "community" in which he/she created.

GAMES!! While this probably takes the least amount of time for the 
sysop, they are a great addition to the system. People like to get 
away and interact with one another playing a game of chess, or blow the 
previous caller out of space! These games, or "doors" often cost the 
sysop money...most of the time a small fee, but the more games you 
have, the more interesting the system becomes. Not all BBS's have 
games, nor are they required. Actually I've seen users at times get a 
little upset because they have a hard time logging on because the 
system was being heavily used for games. It's the sysop's call there, 
and what that might be depends on what he feels the function of the 
BBS to be.

Every potential sysop has to figure out what BBS program he/she will 
want to run. The best way would be to call BBS's in which various 
programs are run, then ask around. There are plenty of sysops who have 
already made up their mind, and are quite willing to tell you why they 
chose what they did. But no matter which one you use, it must be 
purchased.  Prices vary.  Free BBS systems are rare, so understand that 
sysops out there have had to pay to run that BBS program.  Users and 
future Sysops need to know and understand that every person has most 
likely placed alot of money in running a BBS.

Other things can be added. Internet/Usenet access, Encyclopedias, 
online newspapers (like USA Today), FidoNet, whatever.  A lot of times 
it's up to the Sysop's imagination and budget.

Users, remember always that you are a guest of the system in which you 
are calling. If you don't like a particular BBS, then don't call it. 
If you do, give the sysop a pat on the back by leaving him/her a 
message stating so. This is probably the most any sysop will get as 
far as appreciation. Remain active on the BBS you like. Get involved 
with the messages. Everyone loves to get "mail," but as always you must 
send some to get some. If you can get an answer from some of the other 
users instead of the sysop, do so. The sysop is often busy, and of 
course will answer any question you have if he/she can, but asking 
another user gets more people involved, and spreads the same 
information to a larger audience. If you have a file that the system 
doesn't have, and it seems to agree with the function of the BBS then 
upload it.  The sysop will appreciate it as well as the other users. 
Of course it takes time, but usually the time will be given back, and
at times a bit of extra time will be allotted to you.

Well that's it for this week. next week I'll talk a bit more about the 
things that make having a BBS enjoyable, and at times a headache. In 
the meantime, if you have any questions or experiences you would like 
to share drop me a line.

MOTOROLA SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCT INFORMATION on the MC68060

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1

Product Brief

Forth-Generation 32-Bit Microprocessor

The  MC 68060 is a  superscalar,  high-performance,  32-bit microprocessor
providing a  low-power mode of operation.  The MC68060 is fully compatible
with all previous members of the M68000 family.  The MC68060 features dual
on-chip caches,  fully independent  demand-paged  memory  management units
(MMUs) for  both instructions and data,  dual integer execution pipelines,
on-chip floating-point unit (FPU),  and branch target cache. A high degree
of instruction execution parallelism is achieved through the use of a full
internal Havard architecture,  multiple internal buses, independent execu-
tion units,  and dual instruction  issue within  the instruction execution
controller.  Power management is also a  key part of the MC68060 architec-
ture.  The MC68060 offers a low-power mode  of operation that  is accessed
through the LPSTOP instruction,  allowing for  full power-down capability.
The MC68060  design is fully static so  that when circuits are not in use,
they do not draw power.  Each unit  can be disabled  so that the  power is
used only when the unit  is enabled and executing an instruction. Figure 1
illustrates a block diagram of the MC68060.

                            INTEGER UNIT

The MC68060's integer unit carries out logical  and arithmetic operations.
The integer unit  contains an instruction  fetch controller,  an execution
controller,  and  a branch  target cache.  The superscalar  design  of the
MC68060  provides  dual execution  pipelines in  the intruction  execution
controller, providing simultaneous execution.

The superscalar operation of the integer unit can be disabled in software,
turning off the second executionpipeline for debugging. Disabling the
superscalar operation also lowers power consumption.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 4
INSTRUCTION FETCH CONTROLLER

The intruction fetch controller contains an instruction fetch pipeline and
the logic that  interfaces to  the branch  target cache.  The  instruction
fetch pipeline consists  of four stages, providing the ability to prefetch
instructions in advance of their actual use  in the instruction cache con-
troller. The continous fetching of  instructions kepps the instruction ex-
excution controller busy for the greatest possible performance.  Every in-
struction  passes through each of the four  stages before entering the in-
struction execution controller.  The four stages in the  instruction fetch
pipeline are:

1.  Instruction Address Calculation -- The virtual address of the instruc-
    tion is determined.

2.  Instruction Fetch -- The instruction is fetched from memory.

3.  Early Decode -- The instruction  is pre-decoded  for pipeline  control
    information.

4.  Instruction Buffer -- The instruction and  its pipeline control infor-
    mation are buffered until the  integer execution pipeline is  ready to
    process the instruction.


BRANCH TARGET CACHE

The branch target cache plays the major role  in achieving the performance
levels of the MC68060.  The concept of  the branch target cache is to pro-
vide a mechanism that allows the instruction  fetch pipeline to detect and
change the instruction stream  before the change of flow  affects the  in-
struction execution controller.

The branch target  cache is examined for a valid  branch entry  after each
instruction fetch address is  generated in the intruction  fetch pipeline.
If a hit does not occur  in the branch target cache, the instruction fetch
pipeline continues to fetch instructions sequentially.  If a hit occurs in
the branch target cache,  indicating a branch taken instruction,  the cur-
rent  instruction  stream is  discarded  and a new  instruction stream  is
fetched starting at the location indicated by the branch target cache.


INSTRUCTION EXECUTION CONTROLLER

The instruction execution controller contains dual integer execution pipe-
lines,  interface logic to the FPU,  and control logic for data written to
the data cache and MMU.  The superscalar design of the dual integer execu-
tion pipeline provide for simultaneous instruction execution, which allows
the processing more than one  instruction during each machine clock cycle.
The net effect of this  is a software  invisible pipeline capable  of sus-
tained execution rates of less than on machine clock cycle per instruction
for the MC68060 instruction set.

The instruction execution  controller's control logic  pulls an intruction
pair from the instruction buffer every machine clock cycle,  stopping only
if the instruction information is not available or if an integer execution
hold condition exists.  The six stages in the dual integer execution pipe-
lines are:

1.  Instruction decode -- The instruction is fully decoded.

2.  Effective address calculation -- If  the  instruction  calls for  data
    from memory, the location of the data is calculated.

3.  Effective address fetch -- Data is fetched from the memory location.

4.  Integer execution -- The data is manipulated during the execution.

5.  Data available -- The result is available.

6.  Write-Back -- The resulting data  is written back to on-chip caches or
    external memory.

The MC68060 if optimized for most  integer instructions  to execute in one
machine clock cycle.  If during the instruction decode stage, the instruc-
tion  is determined to  be a floating-point instruction, it will be passed
to the  FPU after  the  effective address  fetch stage.  If data  is to be
written to either the on-chip caches or external  memory after instruction

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 5
execution,  the write-back  stage holds the data  until memory is ready to
receive it. Temporarily holding data  in the write-back  stage adds to the
overall  performance of  the  MC68060 by not slowing  down pipeline opera-
tions.


                            FLOATING-POINT UNIT

Floating-point is  distinguished from  integer math, which deals only with
whole  numbers  and fixed  decimal  point locations.  The  IEEE-compatible
MC68060's FPU computes numeric  calculations with a variable decimal point
locationThe MC68060 features a built-in FPU that is MC68040 and MC68881/82
compatible. Consolidating this  important function on-chip speeds up over-
all processing and eliminates interfacing overhead  associated with exter-
nal accelerators.  The MC68060's FPU operates in parallel with the integer
unit.  The FPU performs numeric calculations while the integer unit conti-
nues integer processing.

The FPU has been optimized  for the most frequently  used instructions and
data types to  provide the highest possible performance.  The FPU can also
be disabled in software to reduce system power consumption.


FLOATING POINT EMULATION

The  MC68060 implements the most  frequently  M68000 family floating-point
instructions,  data-types, and  data formats  in hardware  for the highest
performance. T he remaining instructions are emulated in software with the
M68060FPSP  to provide  complete IEEE  compatibility. The MC68060FPSP pro-
vides the following features:

- Arithmetic and Transcendental Instructions

- IEEE-Compliant Exception Handlers

- Unimplemented Data Type and Data Format Handlers


                          MEMORY MANAGEMENT UNITS

The MC68060 contains independent instruction and data MMUs.  Each MMU con-
tains a cache memory called the address translation cache (ATC).  The full
addressing range  of the MC68060 is  4 Gbytes (4,294,967,296 bytes).  Even
though most  MC68060 systems  implement a much smaller physical memory, by
using virtual  memory techniques,  the system can  appear to have a full 4
Gbytes of physical memory  available to each user program.  Each MMU fully
supports demand-paged  virtual-memory  systems  with  either 4- or 8-Kbyte
page sizes.  Each MMU protects supervisor areas from accesses by user pro-
grams and provides write-protection  on a page-by-page basis.  For maximum
efficiency, each MMU operates in parallel with other processor activities.
The MMUs can be disabled for emulator and debugging support.

ADDRESS TRANSLATION

The 64-entry, four-way,  set-associative ATCs store recently used logical-
to-physical  address translation  information as  page descriptors for in-
struction and data accesses.  Each MMU  initiates address  translation  by
searching for a descriptor containing the  address translation information
in the ATC. If the descriptor does not reside in the ATC, the MMU performs
external bus cycles through  the bus controller to  search the translation
tables in  physical memory.  After being located,  the page  descriptor is
loaded  into the ATC,  and the address is correctly translated for the ac-
cess.

                       INSTRUCTION AND DATA CACHES

Studies have  shown that  typical programs  spend much of their  execution
time in a few main routines of tight loops.  Earlier members of the M68000
family took advantage of  this locality-of-reference phenomenon to varying
degrees.  The MC68060 takes further advantage of cache technology with its
two, independent,  on-chip  physical chaches,  one for instruction and one
for data.  The caches reduce the processor's external bus activity and in-
crease CPU throughput by lowering the effective memory access time.  For a
typical system designm  the large  caches of the MC68060 yield a hery high
hit rate, providing a substantial increase in system performance.

The  autonomous nature  of the  caches allows  intruction-stream  fetches,
data-stream fetches,  and external  accesses to occur  simultaneously with
instruction execution.  For example,  if the MC68060 requires  both an in-
struction access  and an external peripheral access and if the instruction
is resident in the in-chip cache,  the periphal access  proceeds umimpeded
rather than being queued behind the  instruction fetch.  If a data operand
is also  required and it is resident in the data cache, it can be accessed
without hindering  either the instruction  access or the external periphal
access.  The parallelism inherent  on the MC68060 also allows multiple in-
structions  that do not  require any  external accesses to execute concur-
rently while the processor is performing an external access for a previous
instruction.

Each MC68060 cache is 8 Kbytes,  accessed by physical addresses.  The data
can be configured as  write-through or deferred  copyback on a page-basis.
This choice  allows for optimizing the system  design for the high perfor-
mance if deferred copyback is used.

Cachability of data  in each memory page is  controlled by two bits in the
page descriptor.  Cachable pages  can be either write-through or copyback,
with no write-allocate for misses to write-through pages.

The MC68060  implements a  four-entry write buffer  that maximizes  system
performance by  decoupling the  integer pipeline from the  external system
bus.  When needed, the write buffer allows the pipeline to generate writes
every clock cycle,  even if the system bus runs at a slower speed than the
processor.

CACHE ORGANIZATION

The instruction and  data caches are each organized  as 4-way set associa-
tive, with 16-bite lines.  Each line of data has associated with it an ad-
dress tag and  state information  that shows the  line's validity.  In the
data cache,  the state  information indicates  wheter the line is invalid,
valid, or dirty.

CACHE COHERENCY

The MC68060 has the ability to watch or  snoop the external bus during ac-
cesses by other bus masters,  maintaining coherency  between the MC68060's
caches and external memory systems.  External bus cycles can be flagged on
the bus as snoopable or nonsnoopable.  When an external cycle is marked as
snopable,  the bus snooper checks the caches  and invalidates the matching
data.  Although the  integer execution  units and the  bus snooper circuit
have access to the on-chip caches, the snooper has priority over the exec-
ution units.


                              BUS CONTROLLER

The bus  is implemented as  a nonmultiplexed,  fully synchronous  protocol
that is clocked off the rising edge of the input clock. The bus controller
operates  concurrently with  all other functional  units of the MC68060 to
maximize system throughput. The timing of the bus is fully configurable to
match external memory requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 7
                            IEEE 1149.1 TEST

To aid the system diagnostics, the MC68060 includes dedicated user-access-
ible test logic  that is fully compliant with the IEEE 1149.1 standard for
boundary scan testablility,  ofter referred to as Joint Test  Action Group
(JTAG).


                      POWER CONSUMPTION MANAGEMENT


The  MC68060 is  very power  efficient due to  the static logic  and power
management designed into the basic architecture. Each stage of the integer
unit pipelines and the  FPU pipeline  draws power only when an instruction
is executing, and the cache arrays draw power only when an access is made.
The FPU,  secondary integer execution pipeline,  branch target cache,  and
instruction  and data  caches can  be disabled to reduce overall power us-
age.  The 3.3-V power  supply reduces  current consumption  by 40-60% over
that of microprocessors using a 5-V power supply.

The MC68060 has additional methods for  dynamically controlling power con-
sumption during operation. Running a special LPSTOP instruction shuts down
the active circuits in the processor,  halting intruction execution. Power
consumption in this standby mode is greatly reduced.  Processing and power
consumption can be resumed by  resetting the processor or by generating an
interrupt.  The frequency of operation  can  be lowered to reduce  current
consumtion while the device is in LPSTOP mode.


                                PHYSICAL

The MC68060  will be available  as 50 MHz and 66 MHz versions,  with 3.3-V
supply voltage, an in ceramic PGA and CQFP packaging configurations.

                            The Great GENIE
                                   or
            When Is a Price Increase a Not a Price Increase?

 
by Lloyd E. Pulley, Sr.
 
     A long, long time ago, in a far off world, there was a rich and
powerful land called GEIS.  The ruler of GEIS was so rich that he only used
his lands during the daytime throughout the week, leaving the lands
virtually empty during the nights and weekends.
 
     One day a cousin of the ruler of GEIS came to him with a plan.  The
cousin, known as the Great GENIE, said "Why not rent me the use of your
kingdom when you're not using it? I know of many people who would pay for
the right to have some place to play in the evenings and weekends.  This
way you and I can make a few extra dinars while supplying these people with
something they want."  The ruler of GEIS thought that this was a good idea
but warned his cousin, "Make sure that you don't rent out more space than
we have. I will not spend dinars to expand my kingdom just to give your
people more room."
 
     So the Great GENIE came to control a vast territory. However, much of
this territory was a vast waste-land (what came to be known as the Basic
areas). True, there were a few oasis' with popular settlements in this
wasteland (SciFi, Religion and a few others) but most of this territory was
sparsely settled and seldom visited.  Most of the population and visitors
to his land stayed in the civilized areas (what came to be known as the
Value areas) and seldom ventured into the unsettled territories/wasteland.
 
     While the Great GENIE was a mighty man inside his own lands, he was
considered a 'minor monarch' in comparison to some of the other countries 
that surrounded his territory.  The empires of CIS, Delphi, Prodigy and 
others all had populations greater than his.
 
     The Great GENIE knew that population was the key to power and riches. 
His country had the resources (known as CPU power) to handle 2-3 times as
many people as it currently held without expending much of the gold
contained in his tightly held purse strings.  With more population, there
would be more tax money and more people to spend money in the civilized
areas.  With more population, the Great GENIE would be a power to be
reckoned with.
 
     After long and detailed consultations with his viziers, the Great
GENIE came up with a plan that would entice some of the people from the
surrounding countries to his territory.  He would allow them to settle into
is wasteland for FREE.  There they would be free to build the types of
communities that they wanted.  Social and conversational intercourse would
spread throughout this once desolate area, making it bloom.  To make the
deal more enticing, the Great GENIE decided to include free access into the
few oasis/settlements in this wasteland.
 
     The Great GENIE was nobody's fool.  While he would allow them to
settle for free, he would charge them a small monthly 'settlement' fee
(aka, service charge). This settlement fee would cover the small additional
expense that they cost him (remember, the Great GENIE had all of this extra
resources/CPU setting idle, so his additional expenses weren't great),
while adding greatly to his coffers. Not only would he make money from the
settlement fees, he knew that many of these new settlers (aka, newbies)
would also go into the civilized areas - thus spending money there and
increasing his tax revenues.
 
     The Great GENIE decided to use part of his new settlement fees to
reduce the tax-burden on his current subjects. This would keep them happy
and not be too upset over the newbies getting free what they had to pay
for.  
 
     For several years, everyone prospered.  People came and settled the
previous wasteland, creating new and exciting societies.  As word spread,
more and more people came to settle. Prosperity was had by all.  Almost
everyone raved about how wise the Great GENIE was.
 
     But a dark cloud hovered on the horizon, a cloud that kept growing and
coming closer, a cloud that brought cold winds and omens of bad things to
come.
 
     As more and more people came to this land, more and more of the Great
GENIE's resources were needed to handle them. Roads that used to be clear
and fast, now became crowded and slow. People used to be able to visit
other parts of the land in just seconds, now sometimes had to take many
minutes to make the same trip.
 
     Even inside the civilized enclaves, the area that was still being
taxed, citizens found things rapidly growing sluggish. The newbies were
clogging up streets and taking up space at the restaurants and shops. 
Resources that were needed to keep the enclaves running smoothly had been
shunted off into the wilderness in an attempt to keep that area running
smoothly.

     It wasn't long before everyone started to blame everyone else for the
problems. Some blamed the Great GENIE for not having more resources to
handle things properly. They forgot that the Great GENIE was not the real
ruler of this land and had no power to get more resources/CPU.  Others
blamed it was the newbies for not paying their way and for being system
hogs. They forgot that these newbies 'settlement fees' had helped to lower
their taxes - and that the newbies in many cases had created paradises out
of former wastelands.  While others blamed it on the old citizens for
taking too much of the system resources to play games, grab files and chat,
all the while forgetting that without the old citizens taxes, there would
have never been the new territories.

     The Great GENIE decided to play Solomon. In order to restore his
kingdom back to normal, he would cut taxes in half!!  All of his citizens
would now pay taxes, but at only half of the previous rate.  Also, to help
cover the additional costs of giving service to his now inflated
population, the Great GENIE decided to increase the settlement costs by
almost 80%.  The Great GENIE knew that his new tax plan would be unpopular
with some, and that some of his citizens would leave. While this saddened
him, he knew it was for the best.  With these citizens gone, many of his
resources would be released so that he could give better service to the
citizens that remained.

     On hearing this news, a great uproar was heard throughout the land.
The citizens of the civilized territories shouted in glee.  Their taxes had
been lowered again!! Not only that, but those ungrateful system hogs, those
newbies would now be paying 'their fair share'.
 
     However, many of the newbies did not view the new taxes with the same
enthusiasm as their brethren in the civilized lands did. They felt that
they had been enticed to this new land with the promise of free lands, and
now that they were here that promise had been broken.  They didn't see
themselves as system hogs, but rather as people who had created a paradise
where none existed before.  Now that a paradise had been created, the
creators were being asked to pay to use their creation.  Some even felt
that they'd been enticed to do a job and once it was done, they weren't
wanted anymore - that the new tax was just a way to chase them off.

     What will the future hold for the Great GENIE's territories? No one
knows for sure. Most of the old citizens will stay around but some will
leave. Some had gotten used to visiting the new territories and find the
new taxes there unacceptable - unacceptable enough that they will move to
other countries instead of staying.

     But will enough of the newbies stay? Will there be enough to keep the
quality of life in the new territories up to the current levels?  Will
there be enough to keep the quality of life in the new territories at an
acceptable level?  Or will enough newbies leave so that the new territories
will gradually sink back into a wasteland - a wasteland with memories,
echoes of better times and filled with ghost towns?
 
     The Great GENIE hopes for the first, will settle for the second and
fears the third.

FInf            A very versatile directory listing utility.  It can examine the
                contents of files and display a short type description.  In
                addition, FInf has a whole slew of options that allow you to
                filter files by type, date, age, size etc., as well as recur-
                sive directory descending, and adjustable output formatting.
                So next to simply listing directories, FInf is extremely useful
                for creating hybrid commands that perform functions closely
                tuned to your specific needs.  Version 1.15, binary only.

                you!  Version 1.01, binary only.

Today I had a conversation with a lady.

Lady:   "What do you do?"

Me:     "I'm a UNIX programmer."

Lady:   "Really?  I can program, too."

Me:     "What kind of computer?"

Lady:   "Macintosh"

Me:     "What language?"

I swear I am not making this up.  I have all my buddies as witnesses.
