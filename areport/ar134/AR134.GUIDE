The Amiga Report Internet Mailing List is no longer accepting requests for
additions, deletions or changes.  The individual managing the list is no
longer able to continue this task.  The Amiga-Report-Request address has
been disabled, so any mail sent there will be bounced back.  The actual
list is still active as it stands, and will be for another week or two.

We are in the process of converting the list over to another system, and
hope to have the move completed in a few weeks, hopefully sooner.  In the
meantime, if you are not on the mailing list, I suggest you try to get AR
from either a major online service, or from one of the many offical AR
Distribution Sites.  That list continues to grow, as we've added four more
sites since last week!  Thank you for your patience.


And now, back to our regularly-schedule editorial...

Have you ever wanted to see your name in writing?  Are you technically
inclined, or good at writing reviews?  We're looking for some writers
to do original pieces.  Naturally, since we're a free magazine, we have
no budget in which to pay people.  The only thing we can offer is the
good feeling you'll get by knowing you're helping the Amiga Community!

We're interested in all kinds of articles... reviews, programming
instruction, helpful hints and tricks (remember the DOA Amiga Tip of the
Week?  We ran out of ideas).

If you have anything you care to contribute, we're more than happy to take
a look!  Please send submissions to Rob-G@cup.portal.com.  Thanks!

                   ** Atari Ships $250 Jaguar System **

   Last week, Atari Corp. formally launched its $250 64-bit games mach-
ine, the Jaguar.  Computergram International said the machines will go
on sale in New York and San Francisco in the next few weeks, in the rest
of the U.S. early next year, and in Europe later next year.  Atari says
that next year it will offer a $200 CD-ROM drive add-on to play audio
compact disks and disk-based games.  The Jaguar systems are being made
for Atari by IBM's Charlotte, N.C., operations.

   Atari chief Sam Tramiel has told reporters he expects the company to
sell 40,000 to 50,000 Jaguars before Christmas and at least 500,000 in
1994.  "The critical requirement," comments CI, "is for successful soft-
ware, and there will only be four games this year, and perhaps two
dozen next year; the games will cost $40 to $50."  The Jaguar ships with
one game cartridge included.

   In a related story, this week, Atari Corp. and Accolade Inc., a
nota- ble publisher and developer of Sega and Nintendo video games,
jointly announced a licensing agreement that will enable Atari to bring
five proven, hot titles from Accolade to consumers on the new 64-bit
Jaguar Interactive Multimedia System by Fall 1994.

   Commenting on the company's decision to work with Atari, Accolade's
chairman, Alan R. Miller stated, "That Atari Jaguar is definitely cool,
new technology that is being introduced at a price point attractive to
consumers. We think Atari has a real shot at establishing Jaguar as a
successful system, and we want be part of that effort." The Accolade
titles for Jaguar include:

   Al Michaels Announces HardBall III; Brett Hull Hockey, Bubsy in:
Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind; Charles Barkley Basketball; Jack
Nicklaus' Power Challenge Golf.

   "Accolade's list of titles adds significantly to the Jaguar product
line," said Sam Tramiel, president and chief executive officer of Atari.

   "Accolade's proven titles enhanced by the 64-bit power of Jaguar
will enrich the Jaguar player's library of video games with life-like
sports adventures and real-time 3D animated characters that speak. The
Accolade titles help us to attain our goal of delivering a high quality
selection of Jaguar titles that will entertain all age groups."


               ** 3DO Posts $7 Million Quarterly Loss **

   3DO Co., reported a fourth- quarter loss of $7 million for its
second quarter ended Sept. 30.  This compared to a loss of $2.1 million
for the prior-year quarter.  3DO posted quarterly revenues of $2.6
million from development systems shipments to its software licensees. It
had no reve- nues in the year-ago quarter.

   3DO has started selling its $700 Interactive Multiplayer, a device
that merges capabilities of the video-cassette recorder, the personal
computer and the video-game player.

   3DO unveiled a prototype player, dubbed Opera, at the winter
Consumer Electronics Show last January in Las Vegas, Nev. The company's
backers include American Telephone & Telegraph Co., Time Warner Inc.,
Matsushita Electric Industrial, venture capitalist Kleiner Perkins
Caufied & Byers and Electronic Arts, one of the key developers of
video-game software.

   Early reviews of the system, powered by a 32-bit computer chip and
playing compact disks, have been generally positive although some anal-
ysts think its price tag may be too high for many consumers. But backers
believe the machine will catch on with trend-setting buyers and will
take hold because it can be used with both adults and children.

   3DO will face competition from Atari Corp.'s Jaguar video-game
player, due in some stores before the end of the year. Analysts have
been impressed with early reports about the $250 Jaguar, which runs on a
64-bit chip will sell for about twice the price of Nintendo's and
Sega's 16-bit machines but considerably less than 3DO's $700 player.


          ** Which Systems do MultiMedia Developers Prefer? **

   The answer - Apple Computer's Macintosh and Sun Microsystems' SPARC
platforms for developing software - at least, that's what the new Data-
quest survey tells us.

   The market researcher surveyed 200 multimedia developers who work on
a wide range of products including video games, corporate
presentations, CD-ROM title development, advertising, kiosks, training
and education. Nearly 63% of the respondents said they prefer the
Macintosh platform when developing multimedia software on personal
computers, and less than 36% said they prefer IBM and compatibles. Of
the respondents who use workstation platforms for multimedia
development, 38% said they prefer SPARC and 31% noted a preference for
the Silicon Graphics platform.

   "It's ironic that, while multimedia software developers prefer to
use the Macintosh platform by nearly two to one, the majority of their
reve- nue will come from producing DOS- and Windows-compatible
products," said Bruce Ryon, principal analyst of Dataquest's Multimedia
service.


                 ** Japan's Computer Shipments Down **

   Japan's shipments of small business computers in the April-September
first half of the current fiscal year fell 20.7% from a year earlier to
68,541 units. In terms of value, shipments dropped 22.4%.


         ** Washington Post to Create Interactive Newspaper **

   The Washington Post Co. announced this week it has created a new
unit that will produce news and information products for distribution
through computers, faxes and telephones. Called Digital Ink, the
company's first product will be an online, interactive version of The
Washington Post. It will be available in July 1994.



                    ******* General PC News *******


                     ** IBM to Shrink Computers **


   IBM on Tuesday formally signaled a big change in the way it builds
large computers, saying it would gradually adopt a design that costs
less money and takes less energy and space.

   The design is called parallel processing because the computer makes
decisions and crunches data with dozens or hundreds of the chips found
in personal computers.  Big computers in the past have typically been
built around one or a few large processor chips. Parallel-based compu-
ters take up the space of a refrigerator compared to previous monoliths
that filled a room.


                ** New Version of Anti-Virus Software **

   Trend Micro Devices, Inc. has announced PC Rx 4.0, a new version of
its anti-virus software for DOS- and Windows- based computers. The soft-
ware features rule- based activities monitoring and virus scanning and
removal. It also incorporates a new technology called MutieClean.

   MutieClean is designed for the elimination of mutation engined
viruses, codes which previously could not be detected or removed if in
an advanced state of infection generation.

   PC Rx 4.0's rule-based virus trap doesn't require virus pattern up-
dates and is able to filter virus infected programs from legitimate
applications.


           ** Okidata Introduces New 600 dpi-class Printer **

   Okidata Monday introduced the newest member of its 4 page-per-minute
(ppm) family, the OL410e.  It is a compact, 4 ppm, LED/laser-class page
printer designed for individual PC users who require 600 dpi-class out-
put for desktop publishing, graphics, word processing and spreadsheet
applications. An affordable choice in 600 dpi-class printers, the OL410e
carries a suggested list price of $899.

   The new OL410e joins Okidata's recently introduced OL400e, a
compact, 300 dpi LED/laser-class page printer designed with a suggested
list of $699.

   Specifically, the OL410e, with its 600 dpi-class output, is targeted
at users of 386/486 PCs who have the need for higher quality output for
external selling and marketing documents, such as presentations,
flyers, newsletters and brochures.


             ** PC Price Cuts - Getting Ready for Comdex **

   IBM cut prices up to 26% on its top-of-the-line personal computers
that run networks of desktop models.

   Hewlett-Packard chopped the prices of several mid-range PC's up to
12%.


               ** Sound Blaster Owner Sues Covox Inc. **

   Creative Technology Ltd., which owns the trademark of Sound Blaster
products, has received a preliminary injunction pending trial in U.S.
District Court to restrict Covox Inc. from selling products bearing the
word "Blaster."  Covox produces speech recognition software bearing the
name "Voice Blaster."

   Pending the hearing, Covox "is obliged to adhere to the court's
order that by Dec. 1 it must provide stickers to its customers
disclaiming any association between Voice Blaster and Sound Blaster."


             ** miro Introduces Two New miroVideo Cards **

   miro Computer Inc. announces two new PC video cards, its first
entries in the U.S. multimedia market.

   Both cards can do high-resolution, real-time single-frame or motion-
video captures, and are compatible with Microsoft Video For Windows,
and each offers significantly more. The economical miroVideo Model D-1
is available for $279. The professional-grade miroVideo Model DC-1 is
$899. The Model D-1 will ship by the end of December, the Model DC-1 by
the end of February.


                ** Cyrix Releases '486 Upgrade Chips **

   Cyrix Corp. has added the Cx486SRx2 to its Upgrade Microprocessor
family. The Cyrix 386 to 486 Upgrade Microprocessor models allow users
to upgrade their 16, 20 or 25MHz 386SX systems to 486 performance. The
chip maker says the upgrade extends the life of existing 386SX desktop
PCs by delivering up to a 70% improvement on application performance
while maintaining software compatibility.

   The Cx486SRx2 is a single chip module. A clip-on device,
co-developed with Augat Inc., snaps the Cx486SRx2 on the existing 386SX
micropro- cessor, disabling the original chip and allowing the Cx486SRx2
to take over all the microprocessor functions.  The design works in all
desktop systems tested, but it's not suitable for notebook
applications, since it requires 1-inch spacing to accommodate the
Upgrade and heat sink and allow for proper airflow. Cyrix says it's
evaluating plans for upgrade products for the 386SX notebook market.

   The Cx486SRx2 25/50, for upgrading 25MHz systems, has a suggested
re- tail price of $299. The Cx486SRx2 20/40, for upgrading either 16MHz
or 20MHz systems, has a suggested retail price of $269.


                  ** Epson Expands ActionNote Line **

   Epson America has added new systems to its ActionNote line of '486
portable computers. In a statement, Epson says:

   -:- The ActionNote 700, built around 486DX/33 processors, includes
monochrome, dual-scan passive matrix color or TFT active matrix color
versions. The monochrome sidelit LCD screen offers 64 shades of grey,
while the passive matrix and TFT active color screens feature 256
simultaneous colors.

   -:- The ActionNote 500C offers an enhanced passive matrix color
note- book with a 486SLC/2-50 clock-doubled processor and local bus
video.

   Available also is a removable hard disk drive available in
configurations from 80MB to 213MB.


                    ******* General Mac News *******

  ** Rumor - Apple to Launch MS-DOS-Based Mac at Next Week's Comdex **

   Rumor has it that Apple Computer Inc. will be launching its combina-
tion Macintosh-Windows machine as the Quadra 610 DOS Compatible at
Comdex next week.

   Sources say the machine, code-named Houdini, "includes the Apple
Win- dows co-processor board and enables users to switch among the
System 7, MSDOS and Windows environments with a hot key." Look for the
system to include an 80486 processor and a VGA graphics chip.

   Insiders say that "It will use the screen, RAM, SCSI ports, serial
ports and hard disk of the Quadra," "Once the hot key is pressed, the
Microsoft Corp. environment takes over the screen; a second keystroke
returns the user to the Mac System 7."

   Supposedly the machine will be offered in three configurations: a
basic unit with 8MB and 160MB disk and floating point unit, the same
setup with built-in Ethernet and another with a 230MB disk.


                     ** Seagate Signs With Apple **

   Seagate has signed a new contract to supply Apple Computers Inc.
with volume quantities of its 209MB ST9235N hard drive.  Financial
details were not released.  Reports say that the drives will be used
with Apple's portable computers.



               ** Two New Macintosh Viruses Discovered **

   The Triangle Software Division of Datawatch Corp. this week announ-
ced the upgrade of its popular Macintosh anti-virus software, Virex, to
version 4.1 to detect and repair the newly discovered CODE 1 virus.

   CODE 1, discovered at several sites in the United States, can infect
application programs and system files of any Apple Macintosh computer.
Once infected, CODE 1 will rename the hard disk to "Trent Saburo" when
the system is restarted on October 31 of any year. Although the virus
employs a trigger date mechanism tied to October 31, system crashes and
other damage can occur at any time of the year, as CODE 1 attempts to
alter system files.

   "CODE 1 is the first Macintosh virus to utilize 'stealth'
techniques, indicating growing sophistication among virus writers,"
stated Andrew W. Mathews, general manager of Datawatch's Triangle
Software Division. "With version 4.1 we have once again demonstrated our
ability to combat this increasing sophistication."

   A separate virus, named MBDF B, was also recently reported to Data-
watch as a "new" virus strain. The MBDF B virus can cause unintentional
system damage, such as system crashes and malfunctions in application
programs. Because of its advanced detection capabilities, Virex versions
3.6 and greater already detect and repair MBDF B.

   For more product information on Virex or any of the Datawatch
Triangle Software Division products, please call 919/549-0711.

                             » COMDEX Opens! «


LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, U.S.A., 1993 NOV 15 (NB) -- Comdex has become so
large it is hard to tell what the big story or announcement will be.
Will it be the battle between Novell's UnixWare and Windows NT? Will it
be the Apple Newton, or some other personal digital assistant (PDA)?
Will it be multimedia, by whatever name it is going by these days?

In fact, it will be all that, and more. The user base is so splintered,
with different types of people in different types of situations
requiring radically different tools, that it is hard to tell what will
happen. This at a time when Microsoft Windows is as big a standard as
DOS once was -- the DOS market is drying up.

For now, it seems that PDAs, personal communicators or hand-held mobile
devices are giving Microsoft's rivals one last chance to shine. Devices
running Microsoft at Work, a stripped-down version of Windows, are not
due until next year. Meanwhile there are three versions of the Zoomer
under Geoworks -- from AST, Tandy, and Casio -- the Apple Newton, and
the AT&T Personal Communicator with its PenPoint operating system. All
will try to get a piece of the market before the 800-pound gorilla, now
known as Bill Gates, decides where to sit down.

Speaking of Microsoft, many are featuring the Microsoft Office suite of
applications -- including Excel, Word, and PowerPoint -- which is
putting pressure on Borland, WordPerfect and single- purpose programs.
By selling a collection of applications at a discount, all of which work
together, some argue that Microsoft is making major application
software into a two-horse race -- with itself and Lotus, with help from
Notes, being the two horses.

The show itself will be housed in four venues -- the Las Vegas
Convention Center, the Las Vegas Hilton next-door, the Sands Expo
Center, and Bally's -- but that does not mean it is getting smaller.

Instead, cozy tents have been set up, some for exhibits, others for
functions like the press center. Parking will be impossible, but at
least there will not be the long rides to the Tropicana or Riviera to
worry over. Speaking of long rides, however, many people are literally
staying 50 miles or more from the show, and cabbies are taking people in
suits to hotels they would be scared to visit most days. The official
noise is 170,000 expected, although the word on the street is more like
185,000.



                     » Editorial - The Online Future «


ATLANTA, GEORGIA, U.S.A., 1993 NOV 12 (NB) -- By Dana Blankenhorn.
There's a great and growing paradox online. Users remain tied  to modems
running, at best, at 9,600 bits/second. Their main  choices are among
CompuServe, GEnie, America Online,  Applelink, and Prodigy on the
consumer side, Dialog, Dow  Jones, or Mead Data Central on the business
side. Meanwhile,  billions are being spent to "dominate" the coming
world of  multi-megabit services linked to cable TV. 

While information providers and service providers work at arms- length
in today's online world, and anyone with an idea has a  shot at the
market, there's a growing assumption that only "brand  names" need apply
in the future. The need to control such brand  names has created a
feeding frenzy among players, who like  BellSouth, are determined to be
"survivors" in a game that hasn't  really started. 

I don't know if anyone has noticed it or not, but Prodigy has yet  to
turn a profit, and will never, ever, make back the $500  million IBM and
Sears invested to open it. This is because  Prodigy continues to think
it can control what people say and  read online, choices best left to
free people and free markets.  The same hubris is now consuming such
otherwise intelligent men  as Bell Atlantic's Ray Smith, BellSouth's
John Clendenin and  TCI's John Malone. 

The reasons for it can be found in the Bells themselves. The  networks
they offer are, compared to their promises, pitiful. If  I were Ross
Perot, comparing the Bells' promises and performance,  I'd be a little
crazy too. A decade ago the Bells promised a raft  of new services based
on a digital standard called ISDN. ISDN  delivers two 64,000 bit/second
data channels and a 16,000  bit/second signaling channel to residential
customers. Today ISDN  is offered in only a few places, and I still
can't get it in  Atlanta, despite living just a block from a major urban
switch. 

Even Bell-heads are in on this joke -- if the Bells were selling  sushi
they'd call it cold dead fish. Bell-head suppliers were  happily
pinning "cold dead fish" buttons to their lapels at this  year's
Supercomm trade show, and the Bell-heads were laughing  right along. 

The problem today remains the same as it was 10 years ago, when  ISDN
was the big buzzword. The Bells like to talk about  competition, but all
they really understand is monopoly. They  won't make investments in
plant and equipment unless they see a  guarantee of profit. The same is
true of the cable companies.  That's what this feeding frenzy over
Paramount is really all  about -- control. The Bell-heads and cable-head
ends figure if  they don't control what goes over their systems, its
cost, and the  ability to keep others' content off, investments in the 
"information superhighway" just aren't worth it. 

As Ross likes to say, "I find that fascinatin'." Every other  business
in the world seems to have figured out there's a  difference between
content and distribution. The former must  always be risky, in the way
that art and science are risky. There  can be no guarantees the product
will be as promised. There's no  way to guarantee against a movie like
"Ishtar" or "Popeye," no  way to prevent a "Paula Poundstone Show" from
reaching the air  for two weeks. The risks are inherent in the process
of trying  something new. Distribution risks are different. They're
about  balancing the cost of obtaining business with the cost of 
providing service. Producers don't know if there will be any  business.
Distributors just worry about getting their share, and  at what price. 

My point -- billions and billions of dollars are going to be lost  in
the next few years, billions and billions of dollars that  could have
been profitably invested in fiber wires and high- capacity switches,
billions and billions of dollars which will go  instead to lawyers,
deal-makers and accountants. The Japanese  thought they had this game
wired too, so Sony bought Columbia  while Matsushita bought
MCA-Universal. Now Matsushita wants out -- even deep pockets have a
bottom to them. You'd think the Bell- heads would take a lesson from
that and stick to their knitting.  Not a chance -- like those old ladies
fleeced by Zero Mostel in  Mel Brooks' "The Producers" a
quarter-century ago, they've got  stars in their eyes and sawdust in
their veins. The tragedy is  this time we'll all pay for that, in the
form of higher phone  rates, and less technology online than we'd like,
that we  deserve, and that we'd pay for.

                   » Commodore Announces Another Loss «

PHILADELPHIA - Commodore International Ltd., after months of unexplained 
delay, revealed late Friday (11-12-93) that it lost $356 million for the 
year ended June 30, obliterating shareholders' equity, which fell from 
$325 million June 30, 1992, to negative $53.2 million.

The report raises "substantial doubts about the company's ability to 
continue as a going concern," Commodore said in the report, which normally 
would have been issued in August.

The West Chester, Pa., firm also said it lost $9.7 million in the quarter 
ended Sept. 30. Officials were unavailable.

@node P1-4 "INOVAtronics releases Text editor"
@toc "menu"

   » INOVAtronics Releases New Professional Text Editor for the Amiga «

                                  "Edge"


EDGE is a powerful and easily configurable text editor for writing and
editing common ASCII text files.  Uses include editing AmigaDOS batch files
(such as the Amiga's Startup-Sequence), as a "front end" editor for Desktop
Publishing programs, and as a source code editor for various programming
languages such as C or ARexx.  EDGE is desirable for any project where a
conventional word processor would embed unwanted, invisible formatting
codes in your text. Toaster users will find EDGE a perfect companion to
Directory OPUS and great for tweaking those Lightwave render files.
  
  
EDGE Feature List
-----------------
 · May open an unlimited number of files (limited only by available memory).
  
 · Allows an unlimited number of windows per file (limited only by available
   memory).
  
 · Real-time update of a file's windows.
  
 · Files may be saved with Snapshot which maintains the local editing
   environment in the icon for the project.
  
 · Extensive AmigaGuide on-line help everywhere; pressing the Help key at
   any time brings up the relevant section of the help file in AmigaGuide
   hypertext, which allows you to jump around as you wish or retrace your
   steps.
  
 · Powerful undo and redo feature. You may define the size of the undo buffer.
  
 · EDGE's custom screen is public, allowing other applications to exist on
   its screen.  Command Shells, ARexx consoles, Directory Opus, etc., may
   exist on the EDGE display.  The custom screen may run on any monitor 
   added to the display database.
  
 · Can open on the Workbench screen, a clone of the WorkBench, or on any
   application that uses a public screen (i.e.  EDGE may open on the
   Directory OPUS screen).
  
 · User definable fonts.  The screen and gadget fonts may be any font;
   monospace or proportional, between 6 and 64 points.  The text font may be
   any monospace font between 6 and 64 points.  All three fonts support user
   definable softstyles bold, italic, underline, and font scaling.
  
 · Has the ability to hide sections of text inside "folds".  Folds can be
   nested.  Commands include: Show, Hide, Shownested, Hidenested, Showall,
   and Hideall.
  
 · Unlimited number of ErrorMarks and IMarks, 10 BookMarks, one AutoMark.
  
 · When EDGE is running, it opens a device much like a "RAM Disk".   This
   device works just like any disk on the WorkBench, inside Directory Opus,
   or when named in a Shell.  You may drag and drop a project file icon on
   this device/disk icon and it will load into EDGE for editing.  The EDGE:
   device gives instant access to all files loaded into EDGE.  You can do
   most things with the EDGE: device that you can do with a normal ram-disk
   (including creating and deleting files).
  
 · User definable menus, user definable keyboard layout, all texts, messages,
   errors, prompts, titles, etc., are completely definable.
  
 · Fast search and replace.  Searches can be stopped by pressing CTRL-C.
   Supports AmigaDOS 2.0 wildcards (in single line searches), whole words,
   case significance or not, circular searches, and multiple line searches
   with replacement.  You may search and replace non-printing characters
   such as '\000'.  You may copy text (blocks) to the search or the replace
   buffer.  EDGE supports searching for assembler/C labels and C function
   definitions, and it will test for matching brackets.
  
 · Powerful, well integrated ARexx support with a rich set of editor ARexx
   commands, as well as a macro recording facility.
  
 · You may iconify and deiconify EDGE via window gadget or hotkey.   User
   definable hotkey and cx priority.  You may also select to disable the
   icon-window in the WB screen.  "Wakeup" is fast since the config files
   aren't "release" during iconification.  EDGE may be started in iconified
   state.
  
 · Search/replace commands include: find, findchange, findnext,
   findchangenext, findlabel, findcfunction, findimark, findbracket.
  
 · Backup-system supports auto-numbering and handling of multiple backups
   per file.
  
 · All config files and startup scripts may be overridden at startup using
   special keywords or tooltypes. 
  
 · Wordwrap with user definable right border.  Paragraph formating using
   either left, right, centered or filled justification which uses the
   wordwrap right border.
  
 · AutoSave via user definable timer (in minutes).  You may also define how
   the AutoSave works: you may choose to save only the current file or all
   open files; save files only if changes have been made or save them
   regardless.
  
 · Two clipboards, one local to the current file and one global which is
   shared by the whole Amiga.  Available block commands include: copy, cut,
   paste, erase, uppercase, lowercase, swapcase, printclip, saveclip,
   clearclip.  EDGE supports vertical or columnar blocks.
  
 · Powerful printing system.  User definable printer device, user definable
   header and footer titles with separate printer initialization strings,
   date, filename, page numbering, tab converter, margins and paper length. 
   By having the init strings user definable the user may specify more
   advanced options for his/her printer than with normal 'bold', 'italic',
   etc., buttons.
  
 · Each file has a user definable local environment that may be saved with
   the file in the icon (scroll borders, flags, bookmarks, IMark image, wrap
   border, window size/position, tab list, search/replace stings, rx string
   etc).  The local environment is easily changed with a point and click
   requester.
  
   The flags contain features such as: safe saves, icon creation, convert
   tabs to spaces, layout, auto indent, line wrap, word wrap, backup,
   editable or view only, insert/overwrite mode and the search flags - case,
   words, wildcards, direction and circular.
  
 · The EDGE global environment, which affects all EDGE files, is also
   controlled with a point and click requester.  The entire environment can
   be controlled from ARexx.
  
 · The user may elect to use either the Commodore standard ASL FileRequester
   or the EDGE built-in requester.
  
 · All the EDGE requesters may be user positioned or pointer relative
   (appearing where the pointer is).
  
 · EDGE task priority is user definable, as are the ARexx-console and the
   time delay to wait before closing the ARexx-console.  You may also define
   the threshold for errors reported to the user (all EDGE errors have user
   definable error-levels); the maximum number of files in the
   last-used-list.  The EDGE file requester maintains a history of files and
   is completely keyboard controllable.
  
 · The EDGE icon toolname is user definable and so is the EDGE project icon.
  
 · The status line may be either in the top or bottom of the window; the
   ink and paper colors are user definable.
  
 · The EDGE text windows can have 'autofunctions' attached to them: bring
   window in front of all other windows at activation, zoom window at
   deactivation, unzoom window at activation, adjust window size to even
   chars when the window is resized.
  
   Suggested retail price is $99.95.  For more information, contact

     Well that time has finally come! A good friend & I have created
     the Reggae Mods Contest.

     If you can find or create Reggae style MOD(s), submit it to me at
     my address or Email me for ways to transfer your entry to me.If
     you are creating a MOD for entry, we would like you to get your
     inspiration from famous artists such as Bob Marley, Peter Tosh,
     3rd World, UB-40, etc. We do not want you to copy their songs,
     just use their idea or similar rythem as inspiration for your own
     creation. Copying songs is a criminal offense. Any MODs received
     not meeting the above criteria will be deleted from the running.
     Your entries, provided we do not have that particular file online
     already, will be put into a "Grand Pot" (Computer DataBase),
     along with your name,phone number and complete address, and any
     information concerning the MOD entry (Where you got it, author,
     inspiration, etc). All original works entries are to become
     property of Sandals Resort Hotels. I will periodically update
     everyone on Usenet of the progress of the Contest along with all
     entries already online.

     The drawing will be on December 31th, 1993. The winner will
     receive an all expense paid week in one of the four Sandals
     Resort Hotels in Jamaica (airfare not include) for themself and a
     guest of their choice.

     All Sandals Resort Hotels are all-inclusive resorts which
     include: unlimited food & beverage; wide range of watersports;
     group activities; taxes and gratuities. All Resorts are for
     couples only and located on romantic beach settings.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     All MODS must be in standard pro-tracker or noise-tracker format.
     Pro-Tracker and Noise-Tracker are MOD(modules) creating programs.
     The reason for this is that MODs will be used in a Scala
     environment, which can only use these type of formats. All MODs
     will be used for advertising commercials in Jamaica on a certain
     channel within the hotels compound.

HOST NAME

     Depending on how many MODS are received, there will be a
     directory created on wuarchive.wustl.edu for allocation of these
     MODs. Meanwhile you should send all mail to me at:
     59236014T@Servax.fiu.edu which happens to be my brothers account
     at Florida International University. Send me Email so we can
     find a way to get your MOD into the drawing.

TITLE

     The package ZeusSCSI.lha contains the following executables:
     ConfigMem, KickLoad, PatchZeus, PatchZeus2 and ZeusSCSIfix.

VERSION

     The version numbers of the executables in ZeusSCSI-package are:
          ConfigMem: 37.4
          KickLoad: 1.0
          PatchZeus: 1.1
          PatchZeus2: 1.2
          ZeusSCSIfix: 2.9851

DESCRIPTION

     These programs make owners of Progressive Peripherals Zeus 68040
     card a lot happier than they are without them. The PPI supplied
     SCSI driver has the annoying feature that it uses a CPU polling loop
     for waiting the SCSI DMA transfers to complete. The supplied patch
     programs make the SCSI driver to use Signal()/Wait() mechanism to
     wait for the completion. This allows other tasks to use the CPU
     while a task is doing a SCSI transfer.

     The patches also fix a nasty problem which is related to the
     copyback cache of 68040 processor. The PPI driver pays no
     attention to this problem which can cause disk reads to be
     corrupted. So even if you don't want better performance consider
     using the patches.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Zeus 68040 accelerator card with ROM version 2.98 is required to
     use the patches. Some of the programs may work or could be made
     to work with OS version 1.3 but to be safe at least 2.0 is
     required.

HOST NAME

     The package is available from Aminet sites. The main Aminet site

                    » The Music Web available for FTP «


TITLE

    "The Music Web"


VERSION DATE

    First release -- November 1993


DESCRIPTION

    The Music Web is an extensible, interactive, graphic-diagram
    environment for building configurations of elements to manipulate
    MIDI event streams (and perhaps other data).  Modules with specific
    functions can be `plugged together' by placing icons in a diagram and
    linking them in the desired configuration; paths may branch and join
    at will to form a two-dimensional network.

    This is a first release, with a limited set of modules, including an
    8SVX `instrument', intended for real-time performance (no sequencer
    module yet).

    You will probably be able to take best advantage of this package if
    you have some kind of multitimbral, multichannel MIDI setup, but it
    should be useful for even the simplest.  With more modules to come,
    I hope it can become one of the most flexible music environments
    around.

    A list of most of the current functions:

        MIDI IN and MIDI OUT (of course!)
        Loudness (reduce velocity value of a note event)
        Transpose (up or down by semitones up to two octaves)
        Key Range (pass a specified range of notes)
        Key Filter (block specified notes of the scale)
        Msg Filter (block specified types of MIDI messages)
        Set Channel (of events on that path)
        Delay (make delayed copies of note (and other) events)
        Instrument (an 8SVX-from-MIDI player)


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    The Music Web needs the 2.04 or later operating system; it should run
    in a 1MB machine.  It really needs something faster than a 68000 to
    be useful (though it will run on one).

    Of course an essential requirement is a MIDI interface on the Amiga
    serial port.

    Documentation is in AmigaGuide form, so you should really have this
    on your system.  A plain text version of much the same stuff is
    avaiable on request.

    [NOTE: An inadvertent reference to `shadow.library' was left in the
    current installation sequence.  This is *not* used by the MIDI version.]

On November 4-6, IDG Communications (magazine company) presented the
Australian Macworld Expo at the Sydney Exhibition Centre (Darling Harbour).
In conjuction with it, they also held the first Publish / Multimedia World
Expo.  I went along on Saturday to have a look, and see what's happening in
the world of Macs.  I also expected to see some "interesting" applications
of PCs (along with the Macs) in the multimedia section.

The exhibition was divided into two equal-sized halls, one devoted to
Macworld, the other Multimedia.  According to the floorplan, each was
arranged in the same way, with the major exhibitor having the largest stand,
in the centre of each hall.  For the Macworld Expo, that was, of course,
Apple Computer.  In the adjoining multimedia hall, the major exhibitor was,
you guessed it: Commodore Amiga!  They had actually booked as much
floorspace as Apple, at a predominantly Mac show.  To understand the
significance of this, it helps to know that, on the exhibition floorplan,
every exhibitor is identified by a number only, except the two major
exhibitors: Apple and Commodore.

The show catalog is divided into two halves - open it at one end and you
get the Macworld show guide, but open it from the other, and it's
Multimedia world.  On opening the Macworld section, the inside cover and
first page is a two-page Microsoft spread.  Open the guide from the other
end, though, and the first thing you see is: "Amiga.  The affordable
multimedia solution!"  Very professional looking.  Less professional is
the facing, inside cover, which is a full-page ad for the "Amiga CD^32
32-bit CD based entertainment system."

Turning to the exhibitor list, we see, under Amiga:

    Commodore at Macworld?

    Commodore has some pretty exciting news for visitors to Macworld -
    but it has nothing to do with Macs!

    Commodore will be showing visitors to its stand in Multimedia World
    the amazing Amiga computer: the perfect alternative to the Mac on every
    count.

    Specifically, Commodore will be demonstrating its top-of-the-range
    Amiga 4000, the computer which has become the machine "of choice"
    amongst the professional video/graphics industry.

    The Amiga 4000 is designed for multimedia - a job it does exceptionally
    well at amazingly low cost.  In fact, countless TV stations, video
    production companies, advertising agencies and in-house video units
    have adopted the Amiga.  But it's more than a multimedia performer:
    desktop publishing, desktop presentation, desktop video, disktop audio
    and even interactive design are just some of the fields the Amiga 4000
    is found in today.

    If you're thinking about a computer for multimedia, think again - and
    think Amiga.  Try a hands-on demonstration of the power of this machine
    at the Commodore stand at Macworld.

Obviously, Commodore found someone who knows what hype is to write the
above.  :-)

In fact, saying that the Amiga is the perfect alternative to the Mac on
every count is a bit over the top (although, with an Emplant, you do pick
up most of the software base) and it's the sort of claim that could have
left Commodore to fall flat on their face.

But -

I hadn't looked at the showguide when I wandered in.  It's my usual
practice to look quickly around a show to see what's there, before
stopping at individual exhibits.  So, I started in the Mac hall, and saw
lots of Macs doing amazing things.  Then I gazed across toward the
multimedia hall and the first thing that caught my eye was a large sign,
with a spotlight moving on it, hanging from the ceiling in the middle of
the hall, saying "Amiga - Multimedia _now_".  Needless to say, my jaw
dropped and I rushed right over.

They had a video wall set up, which was connected to a CD^32.  Plugged into
the back of the CD^32 was an MPEG board, and playing on the video wall was
good old Bon Jovi.  Now, there were lots of 24-bit quicktime animations
playing on high-end hardware, over in Mac land. But, none of it could touch
the quality and smoothness of the video being played by the humble little
A$1100 CD^32 (the console is $699 here; the MPEG board will go on sale here
for A$399 (US$267) next month).  They had seats set up, continually full of
people watching the screens.  While not demoing CD^32, they showed an
Opalvision video.

Some of Commodore's area was taken by a video production company, although
I didn't really check it out - video not being my thing.  Another area was
taken by a dealer (Sigmacom?), who had a display that was impressing quite
a few passersby.

They were showing off the new 150MB Bernoulli drives by playing 24-bit
animations off one, while subjecting it to a repeated drop test.  What I
found nicest though, was the Workbench screen on one of the Amigas there.
They had an EGS board in an A4000, connected to a NEC 6FG, which is about
20", and sharp as a whistle.  The WB was running at 1280x960 in 256 colours,
and was quite fast to use.  They had set it up with background and window
pics, and had installed MagicWB.  The whole thing looked very appealing,
and it made the Amiga look like a truly professional system, able to match
it with the big boys.

I was most impressed when a couple of "suits" walking past, noticed this
screen and remarked on what a good-looking desktop it was.  These guys had
never even heard of an Amiga, and it had to be explained to them that they
weren't looking at some new Mac OS.

Of course, the price tag of that sort of system is way up there, but no
higher than most of the other stuff on display at that show.

All in all - words fail me.  It was one thing that Commodore grasped this
opportunity to present themselves to a receptive and influential audience
in such a big way.  It was quite another to see the Amigas attracting much
interest, and quite able to match any other display at the show.  Add to
that, actually getting to see CD^32's MPEG in action, and, well, I'm glad
I went, to say the least!

Let's hope they keep it up, and maybe try some of the same in the US.
I think the American Amiga supporters could do with some good news....  :-)

/Gateways/Usenet/comp/sys/amiga/announce/Virus on Disk 919 and CD-ROM
17258.3.705.1 Virus on Disk 919 and CD-ROM
11/7/93 21:42 76/3835 fnf@fishpond.cygnus.com (Fred Fish)


On Nov 2nd, two hours before I had to leave to get on a plane to go to
the WoC show in Cologne Germany, I got a FAX that said there was an
active Saddam Hussein virus on disk 919 in the BBBF submission.  This
was later confirmed when I arrived in Cologne on Nov 4th.

Because the contents of disks 911-930 are on the Oct Fresh Fish
CD-ROM, this problem also affects that CD-ROM.

The details, as I understand them at the moment, are:

(1)     The virus is on disk 919 in the BBBF submission.  The exact
        filename is "BBBF/FileVirLib/VirusToTest/Saddam_Hussein_virus".

(2)     The virus is only dangerous if you are running kickstart
        1.2 or 1.3.  However it is a *very* dangerous virus.

(3)     In order to infect your system you would need to execute
        the file containing the virus.  Under normal use of the
        CD-ROM, there is no danger from the virus.

User's might legitimately ask how such an error could occur, including
an easily detectable virus (using most virus checkers) and one with an
obvious name as well!  The only explanation I can offer at this point
is that we obviously didn't run a virus checker over all files on the
CD-ROM (though we do normally have virus checkers running on the test
systems that will detect viruses when they get run), and that the
person working for me on that batch of floppy disks didn't realize
that this was an actual working virus and not just a test file that
simulated a virus or a castrated virus that would be no danger.  It's
still my responsibility though, so any blame for including it must
fall on me.

As soon as I return home, on about Nov 12th, I will reissue disk 919
with the virus removed, and send copies of the replacement floppy to
all of my direct subscribers.  I will also send a letter to all of my
direct CD-ROM subscribers, notifying them of the problem and offering
a replacement CD-ROM at no charge, should they wish to return the
virus infected one.  I will not insist that all CD-ROM users return
their CD-ROM's, except those that use the CD-ROM in such a way that
the file containing this virus is publically accessible, such as on a
BBS or ftp server.

Once we were certain that the CD-ROM contained an active virus we
halted further distribution of the CD-ROM.  This meant that I had to
destroy approximately 500 CD-ROM's at the WoC show in Cologne, much to
the frustration of local German users who begged to be allowed to
purchase them.  The optical side was carved up with a knife, I signed
the front, and we gave them away as souvenirs of the show.

Ultimately I expect this virus to cost me about $3,000 to $5,000 in
lost productivity time, CD-ROM replacement production costs, and
shipping charges.  So you can be very sure I'll be doing everything in
my power to avoid future virus problems.

I am very disappointed that Safe Hex International apparently offered
no warning that their distribution included an actual working virus
rather than just a file simulating a virus or a castrated, harmless
virus.  Furthermore, to pick such a dangerous virus seems to me to be
very irresponsible.  I'm not contemplating any sort of legal action at
this time since I don't feel that the submission had any malicious
intent, though I'm also not ruling such action out for now, or in the
future should I discover new submissions containing trojan horses or
viruses.

Because of the time I will lose dealing with this problem, the next
Fresh Fish CD-ROM may be delayed a week or so.  My best estimate at
the moment is that the December Fresh Fish CD-ROM (aka the second
monthly CD-ROM) should ship about the second or third week of
December.

/Message Bases/General Q&A, Announcements, and Help!/CBM at COMDEX.... not!
16026.3.638.1 Centaur has the booth
11/15/93 18:34 32/1458 Harv


Commodore does not have a booth at COMDEX/Fall (Nov. 15-19, 1993,
in Las Vegas... 170,000 attendees expected. Over 2000 exhibitor booths).
They are listed in the ridiculously huge show book/directory but upon
arriving at the "South Annex" hall and looking for their booth number,
instead I found Centaur Development with their familiar OpalVision
demo booth, being manned by Greg Niles, tireless demodude and
Centaur phone support guy.

Greg had a bad sore throat and was not enjoying the prospect of facing
an entire week of doing demos during which he narrates his on-screen
actions to a crowd of viewers.

Greg told me that it was his understanding that CBM turned their booth
space over to Centaur at virtually the last minute.

Hopefully CBM will, as they promised at the WOCA show in Pasadena in
Sept. '93, have a good showing at the upcoming Consumer Electronics
Show (CES) also to be held in Vegas the first week of January, 1994.
I would certainly hate to see them bail out of that show too, since that
is when/where they claimed they were going to roll-out CD^32 to the
full USA market.

COMDEX is about 98% PeeCees. Bill Gates, Intel, and IBM own this show,
for all intents and purposes. There are a few Amigas scattered about
here and there, but I won't kid ya, the Amiga is practically invisible
here unless you know where to look.

Ah well, there are plenty of other things to do in Vegas for the rest
of the week ;-)

     RE: usual questions (Re: Msg 19981)
     From: LMCCLURE     To: XIS (NR)


DCTV is Digital Creation's Digital Composite TeleVision, totally
unrelated to Commodore's CDTV. (Well, not *totally* unrelated...it was
long expected that Commodore would be bringing out a DCTV display-only
expansion for CDTV. However, this never occurred).

DCTV is a black box that attaches to the DB-23 video port on the Amiga
and to the parallel port. It has a DB-23 pass-thru port for your RGB
monitor, a composite out port (for DCTV video), and a composite in port
(for digitizing). BTW, the parallel port connection is needed only if
you are digitizing.

While DCTV is not true 24-bit output, I would say it is every bit as
good as what you see on TV, and at best resolution, actually better than
what you get from a typical VHS tape, based on my own experience. (Yep,
I've got one). From what I recall from my last digitizing session,
"RAW" format files take up around 450K, while "DISPLAY" files take up
*much* less (around 96K, as I recall). This is for an image that is
stored in Amiga RAM as a 4-bitplane, hi-res interlaced, overscanned
image. I see used DCTV's pop up for sale for $200 or less, a savings of
$100 off the new mailorder price. If you are interested in one, and have
nothing against used goods, I strongly recommend this route.

The RGB convertor, so that you can use an RGB monitor, and more
importantly, use DCTV graphics with a genlock, runs $200 new. I rarely
have seen this item for sale used separately, and not that often in
combination with the DCTV itself. Of course, with used color composite
monitors available for well under $200, the only real need I see for
this is genlocking DCTV graphics.

As I recall, the A3000 has 4 slots, the same as the A4000. The video
slot is inline with one, and PC slots are inline with the other three,
if I am not mistaken. Since the A3000 already has a flicker fixer and
SCSI controller built in, this should be adequate for most folks,
especially if you don't plan on using a Brigdeboard. This would give you
room for one card (Videotoaster, Opalvision, etc.) in the video slot, a
Retina or other video card in a regular slot, with two more slots left
for other goodies, such as a VLab framegrabber, DKB memory expansion,
multiport board, etc. To put it another way...if you could afford to
fill up all 4 slots, you could probably afford to buy an A3000T (which
has more slots)! <GRIN>

The Toaster 4000 will work in the A3000 without modification. (It has a
video I/O section that snaps off and changes the configuration...it
comes set up for the A4000/A3000). The older Toaster board (intended
only for the A2000 series) would work, but either required the A3000 or
the Toaster board to be physically modified for it to fit.

The flicker fixer in the A3000 is certainly worth it, as it is
included! <grin>

Seriously, if you are talking about getting one for the A2000, I would
give the Microway FlickerFixer a definite thumbs down...the places I see
still selling it ask as much or more for it as Commodore's own 2320
board, and it does not work as well. ICD's Flicker Free Video 2 has the
advantage of not taking up the video slot, but costs the most... over
$200 new (actually, around $225). I have seen some places selling
Commodore's A2320 new for as little as $125 (and used prices even lower
on occassion), so unless you have something intended soon for the video
slot, I strongly recommend it. Your first few sessions with rock steady
640x400 Workbench displays on your Amiga will convince you it was money
well spent. Also, for normal use, all the 2.04 ECS modes except Super
hi-res (i.e. 1280x200 and 1280x400 interlaced) will work with an
inexpensive VGA monitor with a Commodore A2320 or the ICD FFV2.

*** Subj: THE BEST OF AMIGA

Has anyone ever had any dealing with the people who put out a monthly
publication on disk (usually 3 disks) with PD & shareware programs on them,
called "The Best of AMiga".  Well I have, and it will be my first and last
dealing with them!!!!  Over  2 months ago I purchsed a 3 disk set in which 2
of the disks had read.write errors.  Inside the package was a little note
stating thatif you received defective disks to send them back.  Well I did,
along with 2 follow up letters, and they never responded to me!!!!!  Now I'm
out $15.00 for the purchase of this, but worst of all I do not have these
programs which I really wanted in the first place.  I'll be damned if I'll go
out and buy it again.  I have no use for companies like this who do not have
the decency to respond to the customers needs.  I told them in my last letter,
that it was the final one, and if I did not receive a reply them, I would
handle the matter myself by telling the AMiga community about thier
non-existent disk replacement service.  I hope a compnay like this goes out of
business tomorrow!!!!!!!!  I have no use for them.  I should have known better
when I had seen that they operated out of a P.O. Box.  I had sent the disks to
a place in Cape Coral Florida.

So the next time you see this publication anywhere, think twice before you
purchase it, for if the disks are defective, odds are, you are NOT going to
receive replacements for them!!!!!!!

Dear Member of the Commodore Community,


Minutes before trading ended on the NYSE this evening, Commodore released 
their financial statements for the last two quarters.  For Q4 93 ending 
June 30th, Commodore had a loss of $82.9 million; making a total loss of 
$356.5 million for the year.  Q1 94 ending September 30th had a loss of 
$9.7 million.  Demand that Commodore meet with the Commodore Shareholder 
Movement.  We all have a stake in the fortunes of this company, and the CSM 
offers the most promising and lasting route to recovery.  We can only 
achieve this with your participation.  Please support the CSM by dup-
licating and sharing this questionnaire (at user groups, dealers, shows, 
etc.).  By the way, if you are planning to buy stock, Monday might be a 
good time.  Thank you.

Well, much to my surprise, when I called a local dealer Friday to find
out if anyone tried When Two Worlds War yet (both the dealer and I are
waiting for a first-hand report, since it's been pretty trashed on the
local nets) I asked if there were any new releases. He remembered me,
asked how the story was doing ("still having troubles with it?" ;), but
started listing new IBM titles, the brat. I said "How 'boot on the
Amiga, Duncan?" and he laughed (a bit embarrassed I'll bet). "Let's
see..." checking a list. "Frontier, um..."

"FRONTIER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU HAVE FRONTIER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I blew his ears off. I hadn't slept in a long time, but I said "hold it
for me I'll be right there" and rushed into the city.

And I've got it! Man, what an amazing program. It almost doesn't seem
right to call it a game - it's a universe!

100,000,000,000 planets is a nice number. But look at the galactic map,
and zoom out, waaaaaaaaaaaaaay out, until you realize that that huge
map they give you (looks nice in any room by the way - already on my
wall!) is only a few pixels on a screen full of 'em. It's amazing. I
spent an hour in the star map, zooming in and out, scrolling around
(it's gorgeous...it moves so smoothly on the A1200!). I discovered an
undocumented feature carried over from Elite - use shift with the cursor
keys moves the view in the star maps a sector at a time, instead of in
minute increments. ZOOM! The map flies, and it goes on, and on, and on,
and on..."Unexplored," "Unexplored" the stars all say. <GRIN!>

(At least, I think that feature is undocumented, I haven't found it in
the manual yet).

There are some pretty wild star systems in Frontier. You name it, it's
there. I've even visited a system with 6 stars (though one was a brown
dwarf and considered a sub-star). Two binary stars, each set of binaries
rotating around a white dwarf (I think) and a brown dwarf around that
little white star as well. A planet around the brown dwarf, and a space
station around that planet. Sometimes it's a long trip to get to the
planet, though, since there's a lot of open space in this system (if the
computer tells you it's out of range, shut off the engines and fly
manually using RETURN for forward and SHIFT for reverse thrust. The
Autopilot decelerates using reverse thrust, but it's never as powerful
as forward thrust. I recently bought a new ship (an Eagle Long Range
Fighter Mk 2 to replace my Mk 1 - it's got more forward thrust, less
reverse thrust, and 2 tonnes more cargo space than the Mk 1, which is
why I wanted it ;) and while it has 28 Gs forward thrust, it only has 4
Gs reverse thrust. So pedal to the metal, then coast, flip around, and
decelerate with the main engines.

You also have a better chance of avoiding hostile ships if you go
faster - ships catch you when you're coasting or decelerating, usually,
and the less time you spend decelerating, the better.

Combat in Frontier is not for the weak hearted! Battles last a lot
longer than they ever did in Elite, I find - lasers now are very hard to
use, the little 1 MW pulse laser you start out with (and a bigger laser
almost requires a bigger ship or forget trading anything - lasers take
up hull space like everything else you buy) in the recommended starting
position (there are 3 starting positions - more later ;) isn't that hot,
and you have to get really close (under a kilometer, which is a lot
harder than it sounds) to get a good shot, unless the target is flying
in line with you at the time - then you can try thrusting at him with
guns blazing but hope you blow him up before he does you, or before you
collide.

Save the game often in spaceflight if you have to. It's easy, Frontier
has the quickest file requestor I've ever seen. It's gorgeous to use.

It's really weird - HD installation consists of opening up the drawer
on your HD where you want Frontier to be, and moving the single icon
over to it. That's it. That's absolutely it! And Frontier loads faster
off the HD than my Workbench loads, for heaven sakes. It seems to me
that somethign over 600k usually takes longer than that to load, but
maybe I'm just in all around shock right now. <g>

The game is very nicely done. You have a choice of using Elite-style
controls, or using controls better suited to the mouse. After struggling
in combat with the Elite controls (thing just move too fast in combat,
sheesh) I switched to the mouse, and have had better success.

The game is very open ended, of course, but you really have to work to
make money. Trading animal meat and robots between two rich systems is a
good way to go, but when you only have 3 tons of cargo space and one of
them has to be used for Hydrogen Fuel (and hope you don't need more ;)
you don't make much per trip. That's why I moved up to the Mk 2 Eagle,
as soon as I could afford it - 2 more tons of cargo space.

There are a good number of ships in the game, and they're very nicely
rendered in combat and otherwise. But there's so much to decide! The
Constrictor is there <g> but while it has cargo room it's relatively
slow and needs an extra crewperson to man it, which you'll have to find
and hire (in other words, you have to pay him a wage!). The Cobra Mk III
is very tempting, being a 1-pilot ship, and with lots of cargo room,
but it's slow compared to the new fighters. It has room for some real
equipment, though, like more powerful lasers and shield generators.

Frontier gives you the option of starting in any of three different
situations. Recommended is the first position, with an Eagle Long Range
Fighter already equipped with the essentials on Ross 158, nice and close
to Sol. Position number two puts you on Mars (terraformed ;) with an
Eagle that has a larger Beam laser but nothing else. Position number
three is for old fogie Elite die-hards, giving you a Cobra Mk III in
orbit around Lave (yes it's there! Part of a small group of stars with
only one planet arond them ;). You have a laser and that's about it, but
the ship is worth a LOT if you want to sell if off real quick...and you
have a lot of cargo room, so you can make money quickly. The kicker is
that you start off as a Fugitive in the eyes of both the Federation and
the Empire - Lave is an independent world, so you're safe enough for
now. But things get really hot with a price on your head. Police fines
are bad enough for us honest folk, fire a laser accidentally in the
wrong place (even ifyou don't hit anything) and you might face a 7000
credit fine.

Of course I'm not done yet.

Included with the game are a nice manual (though a bit sparse in some
areas, compared to the original - there's more to cover though), a
Gazetteer of famous star systems with some hidden hints, a book called
"Stories of Life on the Frontier" with little stories set in the Elite
universe, a quick reference card, a very nice star map (though only a
fraction of what's out there), a notice for a Frontier T-shirt (I want
one! Call me an easy mark but I want one!) and two disks - the game
disk, and a Data Disk. What the Frontier Data Disk does, I don't know -
unless it sneaked its way onto my hard drive while I wasn't looking, HD
users don't use it (or will it be asked for later in the game? Who
knows). It's only 13% full anyway - I suspect it's included mostly for
saved games.

It took me a while to understand the physics in the game - versus the
lack of physics in the original <g>. For instance, in the orginal, the
space bar increased your speed, and another key decreased it, and you
maneuvered a la Star Wars. In Frontier, you accelerate and decelerate.
In manual flight the ship spins on its gyros and you point it wherever
you like, and the computer works the thrusters to bring the ship to that
course. If you're already moving pretty fast, the speed might not even
seem to change if you turn 180 degrees, because of scale, and the fact
that it takes a while to change speed even with 25 Gs. In other words,
your inertia is taken very much into consideration now. In combat, it
may seem as though you're zooming around your opponent, but you're still
moving in your original direction at great speed. Say I'm heading for
the planet Discovery, and I'm doing 20,000 km/s (kms^-1 in the game,
same thing). A Sidewinder attacks me, and I thrust towards him. What
I've done is add a component to my velocity vector, changing it
slightly. My line-of-flight crosshairs won't seem to move, because at
20,000 km/s a few seconds of thrust to move 8 kilometers left or right
doesn't mean much. Once you're able to shake off the feeling that your
velocity (or line-of-flight) vector doesn't HAVE to move for you to be
zooming around your opponent, everything's fine.

Targetting tunnels help a lot in spaceflight, by giving you instant
feedback on the closing velocity between you and the targetted opponent.
And it's best to switch off the engines and control thrust yourself.

Outrunning opponents is possible if you have a faster engine, but if
you're heading for a planet you can't just thrust towards it forever -
you have to think about deceleration at all times. But if you're careful
you can keep an opponent at bay by thrusting for the planet, then
turning and decelerating at the last possible moment. Most likely the
other ship will zoom past you harmlessly, and if you keep up your thrust
he'll have a hard time catching you again. Of course, if the other ship
has more powerful engines you'll have to do this many times. It's
possible to beat off the fast ships by reversing your thrust and keeping
them in a yo-yo chase, but it's tricky to do that without overshooting
the planet you're aiming for.

In combat ships' designations are shown on screen, and you can actually
identify ships by it - I've had run-ins with the same ship after
evading it once before on another trip. The designation appears on most
ships' hulls, and that's indicative of the wealth of depth in this game.
If you thought Elite seemed real, ha ha, wait till you try the
Frontier.

Bounty hunting is still possible. You no longer collect a bounty on
every ship - only on those that are wanted. And, you collect nothing
unless you've got a Radar Mapper to positively identify the ship, and
give you information on its specs. It takes up a ton of cargo
space...ship building in Frontier is laced with choices. Do I go for
that beam laser, and lose another 4 tons of cargo space? Do I really
need an atmospheric shield? If I only take one missile I can take an
extra tonne of goods each trip...

There are faster military engines available, that burn special fuel,
but its converted into radioactives yo have to pay to have dispose of
(jettisoning anything is illegal and results in a fine ;). There are
amazingly powerful weapons but only large ships have room for them.
Everything is a trade-off. You can make good money fast running errands
for people, but keep an eye on the date! People aren't happy when things
are delivered late. And not everyone keeps their half of the bargain -
I've delivered parcels and had the authorities notified instead of
payment made! Good thing I asked for half-payment up front, or I
wouldn't have seen a penny.

If you have any imagination. If you enjoy games where the goals
parallel those of life itself, and the aim is to survive. If you want
your games to last as long as you want them to. If the thought of
exploring strange new worlds excites you.

Buy Frontier!

AMERITECH AND SCALA FORM MULITMEDIA ALLIANCE

        Ameritech now will help its Midwest customers create proprietary
information delivery networks of multimedia presentations combining, text,
video images, animation and sound.
        The company today announced an alliance with software firm Scala,
Inc., to market computer-based information network that are both
cost-effective and easy to use.
        With this alliance, Ameritech now will offer its customers Scala's
proprietary multimedia network product, known as InfoChannel, for uses
ranging from employee information video magazines for corporations to class
registration and campus event information networks for schools to
point-of-sale advertising displays for retailers.
        Specifically, customers can call upon Ameritech to design, install,
maintain, and provide training for their own multimedia networks which
utilize the Scala InfoChannel software to create the on screen material and
to update, schedule and transmit the information over standard telephone
lines.
        For example, J.C. Penney uses InfoChannel to produce and broadcast
its daily employee news program, McDonald's uses it for point-of-sale
advertising at several stores in England, and the University of Michigan
uses it to assemble and send important campus news to 15,000 students at
their residences.
        Ameritech will package these kinds of applications using Scala
software and market them through its business units to customers in many
markets, including the health care, education and financial industries.
The alliance also calls for joint development of multimedia products for
customers in specific markets.
        "Scala products let you produce unsurpassed multimedia programming
on a desk-top computer, with a minimum of training, at a price point that
no other product can match, " said John Hillman, Scala marketing vice
president.
        Businesses, government agencies and schools can create these
multimedia programs and then transmit them over standard lines or ISDN
(Integrated Services Digital Network) lines to stores, remote offices,
schools or other sites.  The information can be updated and displayed at
these sites on television sites, desktop compute monitors or interactive
touch-screen kiosks.
        "Ameritech is quickly expanding from an order taker of network
components to a value-adding partner and market maker," said John Vaughan,
president of Ameritech information industry services, the Ameritech unit
that serves third-party network services and information providers.
        "Scala's multimedia products, coupled with our networking and
marketing ability, enable us to provide many exciting customer applications
in both existing and new markets." Vaughan said.
        With 45,000 users in 40 countries, Scala is the leading
international developer of multimedia authoring software for distributed
information systems.  Scala was founded in Oslo, Norway, in 1987 and
incorporated as a U.S. company in Delaware in 1992. Today's world
headquarters are in Reston, VA., with domestic offices in Portland, OR,
Philadelphia and Chicago.
        Ameritech is a leading provider of full-service communications and
information services to about 12 million customers in the Midwest, and it also
has operations in New Zealand, Norway, Poland and other countries. Its 1992
revenues were $11.2 billion, and its assets exceed $22 billion.       
Customers may call (800) 451-5283 for more information. ###

*** Subj: OMG! I saw an Amiga and a Squirrel!


In our never ending quest to find occurances of the Amiga in any media I
have just found it again in an unlikely place...

I even got to see a squirrel!

Pickup the comic "Ninja High School Yearbook 93" by Antarctic Press
(Issue 5 for Oct. 1993) that just came out this month.

You will find a story called "Ninja High School Prequal" by Amiga
Animator "Eric Schwartz".  The cartoon stars every Amiga owners favorite
female, Amy the Squirrel along with a cameo by his newest character
Sabrina and an unnamed sexy female mouse.  You will find an Amiga
computer with the familiar Amiga Checkmark on the screen in one panel as
well as the Commodore Logo on the "Die You Bastard Die!!" handgun.

Looks like Eric might be branching out into comics. ;)

Okay all you naysayers of the echo,  I have four words for you:

                          SIERRA'S BACK IN TOWN!

Yes,  we will see King's Quest VI on our AGA Amigas!  Of course,  if you
get Amiga World,  you probably have read that by now.  That,  and an AGA Wing
Commander.  *Maybe* an AGA Day of the Tentacle from LucasArts.

KQ VI won't be another cheap Sierra port,  oh no,  it'll be done by
Revolution Software of England.  Sounds great,  doesn't it?

Amiga World lists 50 AGA games that are under way or out.  They did have to
stretch a little with some PD and a rumor,  but there's still 50 games listed.
The AGA games are really coming now.  Even some of the "big boys" are back in
the Amiga arena,  so it's not all gloom 'n doom as some people are so fond of
claiming.

We've got some great,  amazing productivity software coming soon,  great
Amiga games and a fair amount of ports from Clone games.  CD³² is selling
extremely well in Europe,  which could bring even more developers into or back
to the market.  Commodore plans to advertise,  bringing more recognition for
the Amiga name.

I suppose you can look at it in two ways.  It's simply that markets change.
You can look at the loss of the old as bad omens or the new potential.  I'll
look at the bright side.

*** Subj: Lost Kitties


Noting the recent traffic concerning Joan's lost kitty -- I've a very soft
spot for lost animals, cats in particular -- something few people realize is
*how* cats and dogs get lost.  In the hopes that somebody can make use of this
information, I'll pass it along.

According to Desmond Morris (author of the best-selling _The Naked Ape_ and at
least two books on cats), cats and dogs orient themselves differently.  Once a
dog loses sight and scent of his or her domicile, the dog is lost.  Period.

Cats, on the other hand, seem to have almost a magnetic orientation.  They
have been known to travel hundreds of miles to a former home, unerringly.

Problem with cats is, they don't always realize when their families have
moved.  People often lose cats shortly after moving because they let the cat
out, and the cat tries to find its way back "home."  It's tragic, really.

I always suggest to people with cats that after they move, keep the cat in
doors at least for two months -- maybe three.  You want to give the little
furball enough time to realize the new place is really "home."

*** Subj: Final Copy font trick


I don't know if anybody has posted this trick before or if it is even
appropriate in this area but here it comes:

This trick works with KickStart 2.04 and up.

If you (like me) think that the screen font that comes with Final Copy has a
certain 'flair' but is not quite what you like you will find that there is no
way to change the font Final Copy uses using one of the preference requesters.

Here's how you can do it:

1. rename the original "SWScrFont" directory and "SWScrFont.font" file in the
   "FCFonts" directory to something else, f.e. add ".orig" to both names. That
   way you'll always have a backup.

2. copy the ".font" file of the font you like to the "FCFonts" directory using
   the name "SWScrFont.font". This font can be propotional or even an outline
   font.

3. Copy the font directory of the font using the _original_ name to the
   "FCFonts" directory. Make sure there's a font in it that is about the same
   size as the original SWScrFont.

4. Start Final Copy: Tadaa!

Apparently Final Copy is _completely_ font sensitive! I don't see why the
writers haven't added a font requester to change the screen font.

I agree with most of your post but I strongly disagree with your elitist
attitude.  If C= hadn't pumped out millions of cheap computers the yuppies
and the so called 'business' types (who only look for tax deductions) would
STILL own the microcomputer world.

When I think of the likelyhood of $10,000 Apple ][s or $25,000, 64K I*M
PeeCees I could puke......

I go back to the Personal Electronic Transactor, VIC-20 days when an Apple
cost $1500 for an entry level machine (B/W too).  Those machines were mostly
bought by people with the need to show off (with pirated software usually).
The less fortunate, unwashed masses were to be mildly pitied and allowed to
admire the neat toys, even play with them, but NEVER to enter the hallowed
halls of COMPUTER OWNERSHIP!

If the VIC-20 wasn't available in 1982 at $149, I would never have purchased
ANY computer.  (And I was thankful for the PD creations from the PET as well
as -few remember- 'type in programs')

I fear that the world of computing would be very much the poorer if all
those eager teens hadn't the chance to discover the joy of machine language!
Imagine the legions of so called "MIS Professionals" who would only
understand Time Share and Batch Processing.

Save us from the "business school" types and "professional computer users".
Long live the programmer with ML under his/her nails and the urge to create
something more than a prettier spreadsheet.

POWER TO THE PEOPLE!!!  AMIGA!!!

BTW, as you can see this touched a VERY raw spot.  I agree that C= needs to
work closer with 3rd party developers to maximise EVERYBODY'S profits.  I
just don't think that C= needs to beg at the feet of the monied few.  It
didn't work too well for Apple, in the long run either.

LIST PRICE

        GPFax version 2.01 had a list price of $120 (US), but I was unable to
find the list price of any of the current versions.

        I paid $74.99 for my copy, although I know some mail order companies
will be lower.  You can sometimes obtain this software more cheaply when it
is bundled with a faxmodem.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS


        HARDWARE

                This version of the software requires a Group 3, Class
                2 TIA TR29.2 supporting faxmodem.

                At least 1 MB of RAM is required, but the manual says:
                "HIGHLY RECOMMEND a minimum of 1 MB of CHIP memory and
                at least 0.5 MB of FAST memory."

                A hard drive is not required, but the manual once
                again recommends a hard drive "for most efficient
                performance."  The program and supporting files on my
                hard drive take up about 230,000 bytes including its
                own font and printer driver.

                The program can be run on a 68000 CPU, but faster
                processors are recommended, especially for higher
                characters per second throughput on Workbench 1.3.

        SOFTWARE

                Workbench 1.3 or above is required.  It works fine
                even under Workbench 3.0.


COPY PROTECTION

        None.  Hard drive installable.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING


        Amiga 4000/040
        2 MB Chip RAM, 4 MB Fast RAM
        Workbench 39.29, Kickstart 39.106
        SupraFaxModem v32.bis 14,400 baud


REVIEW

        There are two versions of the GPFax software: one for the Supra
modems, and another "generic" version for others.  Although I have a Supra
modem, I was able to purchase only the generic version, as my retailer
carried only that copy.  However, Dr. Perry has told me that for an
additional $25, one can cross-grade from the generic version to the Supra
version.  So, to save money, buy the correct version.  (The generic version
works fine on my SupraFaxModem; so until I get a large shipment of money in
sometime, I think I'll stick with it.  Supposedly, the Supra code is more
optimized for the Supra modem.  I'll followup if I cross-grade.)

        The first thing to check when you boot up your program the first
time is its version.  GP has released several versions in a relatively short
period of time, ranging from 2.01a, 2.01b, 2.30, 2.341, and 2.342.  I had
2.01a (2/5/92).  Don't fear; the patches are available on the Aminet ftp
sites, although one may have to apply more than one patch to get to the
current version (2.342).

        However, because of this upgrading fiasco, the included manual does
not list all of the features of the software.  For example, in order to use
the program on the Workbench, you need to enter "SCREEN=WORKBENCH" as a
tooltype in the GPFax icon.  Such information is included in some of the
updates but may be missing in others.  I basically downloaded all of the
patches and then read all of the documentation files to make sure I didn't
miss anything.  A more current, complete manual would be very welcome.

        Installation onto a hard drive is relatively simple; just double
click on the Install-GPFax icon on the included floppy, and Commodore's
Installer program will guide you through the process.  (Note: some of the
upgrades include "new" fonts and printer driver, which you may need to
install manually.  I do not know if these fonts and driver are actually any
different than the ones included with 2.01, but for safety's sake, I
installed them.)

        The drawer created will have the GPFax program, a ViewFax
program to view faxes without actually having to enter GPFax, a FAX_IN
drawer and FAX_OUT drawer (where Faxes are stored when they come in
and before they are sent out, respectively), a directory with some
ARexx examples, some configuration files, and some documentation
files.

        Once booted, the GPFax screen (or window, if you set that tooltype)
is shown.  The first thing you may notice is the lack of menus.  Everything
in GPFax is button/keyboard driven.  I suppose this is used as a
simplification device, but I found it slightly annoying in the beginning,
though I have since grown accustomed to it.

        The first time you run the program, you will need to set some
environment variables.  These variables include your company name,
your fax number, and your phone number, all of which will be printed
onto an optional cover sheet for each fax.  Also, you can set which
device you wish to use, how many rings before Auto Answer picks up the
phone, and the default font used for the Convert function (described
below).

        In addition to the above "Environment" section, there is an
"Options" section in which you can set other preferences such as Quiet Modem
(which deactivates your modem speaker), Make Icons for faxes, create a
Workbench Appicon (for drop-in faxing capabilities), and Use Security (which
allows you to screen faxes by their incoming ID number).

        There is, of course, a phonebook in which you can store your most
often dialed fax numbers.  Here, you can enter a Name, Number, a Comment,
and a Group field as well as cover page details for each entry.  The number
field can be marked with a "Man!" before the number itself if the fax
receiver must be notified to place their fax machine into receive mode
before sending the fax.  The Group field can group certain names into the
likes as "Customers" and "Vendors" to facilitate faxing a group of people.
The cover page details include your company name, the name of the person
sending the fax, your fax number, your voice number, the name of the company
to which the fax is addressed, the name of the person to whom the fax is
sent, a "header" IFF to place at the top of the cover page, and a
"signature" IFF to place at the bottom.

        In creating a fax, you have two choices:  create an ASCII text or
2-color IFF picture which is fed into the Convert program, or use a word
processing program or a desktop publishing whose output will be sent to the
faxing driver rather than the normal printer driver.  The former will use
the aforementioned font that was set in the Environment section to create a
fax of the text in that font, or just plainly use the two-color IFF
pixel-by-pixel.  This, of course, will not produce a very professional
looking fax.  The latter option, to use the fax printer driver, is much
better, producing a fax output of up to 210 dpi by 196 dpi.  This is much
simpler too, as all you need to do is create a document (for example, in
Pagestream), set the printer configuration to send to the preferences
printer, and print.  GPFax will intercept the file and send it to its
Fax_Out drawer, converting it into a FAX format on the fly.

        Before sending the fax, you can view it on the screen using
the Display command.  You can set the resolution of this screen within
the Options sections; I use a Super72 Super Hires Laced screen.  Here,
you can specify if you wish to view at a 1:1, 1:2, or 1:4 ratio.  (The
1:1 shows about 10% of the page, 1:2 shows about 60%, and 1:4 shows
the entire page for me.)  You also have the option of printing the fax
if you wish for a hard copy before sending it.

        In order actually to send a fax, all you have to do is select which
fax pages you wish to send, choose the phone number to which you wish them
sent, either enter a number or choose an entry from the phone book, and
you're done.  The fax is sent!

        You can also Schedule your faxes to be sent at a specific time, in
case you wish to save money by faxing after 11pm, or perhaps during your
lunch hour.  GPFax will even reschedule your transmission until a later
time, if it attempts the fax but find a busy number.

        In order to receive a fax, you can either set the Auto Answer mode on
within the Options section, or manually Receive a fax.  Either way, the fax
will be downloaded into the Fax_In drawer, which you can Display (as
explained above) or Print to your preference printer.  If you wish, the
program will convert the fax into an IFF file.

        GPFax also includes an ARexx capability to, as the manual states,
"allow almost complete remote control of the program from an ARexx script."
I, being no ARexx guru, have not used the ARexx capabilities at all.  Ich
kann nichts sagen.  Es tut mir leid.


DOCUMENTATION

        The manual included with the original disk was created for version
2.01.  The upgrades on Aminet also have additional information regarding the
upgraded versions.

        The documentation is mediocre.  Because of the upgrading, I found
some discrepancies between the illustrations in the manual and the real
screens in the program.  However, the manual is followable, and the program
is really pretty simple to use, luckily.

        As I mentioned above, the documentation included with the upgrades
could be better.  For example, the documentation for the generic version also
included a lot of information regarding the Supra version.  Why is it in
there?  It's not needed.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

        I found GPFax to be pretty easy to use.  The no-menu interface
annoyed me at first, but I have grown accustomed to it now.  The quality of
faxes it sends and receives is good.

        There are a few things I do not like, though.  GPFax, whenever it
receives a fax or intercepts a printing file to create a fax, uses a pretty
cryptic naming convention to name the faxes.  Although this can be slightly
modified using a "Popup" print menu to assign another name to these fax
files, the fact that the program appends an ever-increasing number (starting
from 002 and working its way up) to the end of that file name on each and
every file.  I keep finding my self renaming each fax as it is created in
order to keep track of which fax is which.  A more intuitive fax naming
convention could have been used here.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        When I first got my faxmodem, I tried out the "elcheapofax" public
domain program.  I found it to be quite cryptic, and now find GPFax to be a
pretty good buy.


BUGS

        I haven't found any bugs per se, but have encountered a problem in
creating files by having the program intercept the file being printed.
Although most programs can route their output to the printer chosen in
the Workbench Preferences, some programs are unable to do this.  I could not
get Word Perfect to output directly to GPFax, and had to resort to
Pagestream to use this capability.  (Of course, Pagestream presents a MUCH
better output than Word Perfect, so I shouldn't complain....)

        In addition, one of the upgrade documentation mentions a problem
when using Final Copy I and II.  It states that "this has been an ongoing
problem for a several [sic] months now and we have been getting a number of
irate users of GPFax complaining bitterly to us.  After considerable
analysis of this problem, we found that Final Copy II (Release 1 sep 26.92)
was the culprit."  The note concludes, "Enough! If you are one of the people
who suffer from this problem, COMPLAIN TO SOFTWOOD not us!!  After discussing
this problem with Softwood, they have kindly offered to upgrade users of
earlier version [sic] of Final Copy II to the later version which has been
rewritten to work correctly."

        As aforementioned, don't forget to get the GPfax patches from Aminet
(under biz/patches) if you get a version older than 2.342.


VENDOR SUPPORT

        I sent E-mail to Dr. Greg Perry regarding the possibility of
cross-grading from the generic version to the Supra version, and he replied
with a note saying $25 and the original disk will allow me to upgrade.  I
personally find that amount to be expensive and will reconsider whether or
not to cross-grade.

        I am not associated with the vendor in any way except as a customer,
unless I have some psychic link with them I don't know. :-)


WARRANTY

        There's a 90 day warranty on the supplied disk which must be
accompanied by a proof of purchase, and applies only to the original
purchaser.


CONCLUSIONS

        On a scale from one to ten ducks (one duck being the equivalent to
"Pond Scum," and ten ducks garnering a "Totally ducky!"  description), I
give GPfax eight and a half (ouch) ducks.

        My final impressions are that I'm quite happy I got the program, and
I hope they'll continue to provide upgrades available through Aminet.


COPYRIGHT NOTICE

        I hereby relinquish the copyrights to this review to Daniel
Barrett, as he is such a cool guy and posts funny articles to Usenet.
Whatever he wishes to do with my inane words, he is free to do so.  So
nyaah.


BLAZEMONGER NOTICE

        For you BLAZEMONGER II players out there, this review, in its
entirety (including the headers), is the secret password jump from
level 323,832,123.021 to 763,334,292.8A0. Just type it in during the
digitized sample of Dave Haynie screaming "MEGA1-RAMMM-SEEYYYYYYY!!!",
and you're there.  Wow.  How did the BLAZEMONGER programmers know?
(And when did Mr. Haynie say that?)



                      ------------------------------



        Here's a small followup to my previous GPFax review.

        I just received E-mail from Dr. Greg Perry of GP Software thanking
me for writing the review.  This, I would like to say, is a good aspect of
customer support.

        Dr. Perry also stated the following:

                "You may like to know that we are now shipping [the GPFax]
                 product with [a] completely re-written manual with all
                 upgrade[s] included."

        I'm sure you can contact Dr. Perry for further details on receiving
an updated manual somehow.

  have on an Internet-connected system.

# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Tymnet 9600bps services is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

/// The Emulation Rambler
    ---------------------
    By Jason Compton
    (jcompton@tcity.com)



It's going to be a relatively short Emulation Rambler this month...I've
been preoccupied with trying to upgrade my system to a 3000.  But, I DO
have  some news.

1. First off, thanks a lot to the guys who have been sending me mail in
response to my call for benchmarking PC-Task.  I've got to get together
the programs first, but after that I should be sending them along...

2.  Second, here's something I got in mail from Mike Greene...

  "I found the following file a week ago, it was in a GENIE file
   library: 

   sxtest.zip...the included readme file:" [A lot of stuff saying you
   need to run the file off of a VERY stripped down IBM system
   configuration: this is the file that checks to see if Cyrix's new 386SX
   clip-on attachment will work with a particular 386SX]

  "I ran this on my A2386/25 and it came up saying I could use this
  clip on 486 chip.  So, I would assume it should work with all 386 BBs."

Can anyone else confirm this?  It sounds like for $200, 386 bridgeboard
users could be getting a REALLY good deal, especially if they bought
them for the $200 the boards were being wholesaled for when C= was
trying to get rid of them...even with a Golden Gate 386, it wouldn't be
bad at all.

3. Finally, thanks very much to Jim Drew of Utilities Unlimited, who
has pledged an Emplant to me for sometime near (before or after) WOC
Canada... I'm hoping by then I'll have my 3000 system to do some
higher-level testing, but I will do the best with what I've got to work
with.

Thanks to everyone for sticking with me, please keep the mail coming,
and I'll see you all again soon.

First off...I'm in NO way making fun of the Emulation Rambler - I was just
not very clever this week :)

Thanks to those who responded to my articles on using the Internet via
Email. I've been working on more, more of those type of articles for those
who only have email access, and some on the Internet in general. Putting
some of this stuff together takes a while at times, so I have to put it off
yet another week. BUT if you have any idea, suggestions, or questions, send
me a note at the address above.

How many of you call a multitude of Amiga BBSes each day, week, or month?

OK.....

Ever hear that speech by the former President Kennedy? Well, I'm going to
distort it a little bit...

"Ask not what your Sysop can do for you, but what you can do for 
your Sysop"

Sysops are funny little things that hang out on the other side of that
system you've been calling. Whether it be the free access system in your
local area or the SIG mangagers at the online commercial networks.
Whereever they are, they go through (the good ones anyways) alot to bring
you whatever they can. At times, at a huge cost to themselves.

I ask you this. Do something nice for your Sysop. Make November the
"Amiga Sysop" month or something. Do anything from donating some money,
time, uploads, messages, or simply tell the Sysop 'THANKS'.

Most Sysops really do alot for little credit or recognition. It's time we
pay them back ...whatever we can.

On the last note, I've wanted to do something for quite a while. Next week,
we will add the "Great Amiga Report" questionaire. Simply put, it's just a 
questionaire about you. The Amiga User. What you use, what you do, what do
you use your Amiga for, etc. I'll compile all this information and feed it
back to you close to the end of the year. Basically to give us a feel on who
the Amiga community is, and what you're all about. Do me a favor and fill it
out and send it to me! I'd love to hear from you all!

@node P4-6 "BIX"
@toc "menu"

/// BIX - Byte Information Exchange             Lots of information!
    -------------------------------



BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and enthusiasts.
While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is the place for 
knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  You're likely 
to find many others in similar situations who can offer advice, give 
technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.

BIX is divided into areas called conferences, each devoted to a 
particular area of interest.  They range from algorithms to windows,
from writers to amiga.  Conferences are categorized into groups,
usually referred to as exchanges, so that you can browse through
whatever groups interest you and see a list of the conferences it 
contains.


                  These are some of the exchanges on BIX:

amiga.exchange - the place for Amiga developers and enthusiasts
byte - the full text of each issue of BYTE magazine; source code too 
e.and.l - Entertainment and Leisure; music, pets, games, more
ibm.exchange - everything from OS/2 to PC clones
mac.exchange -  Mac news, support, software, advice
professionals - consultants, engineers, financiers gather here
programmers - some of the best brains in the business!
wix - the Information Exchange for Windows; Windows Magazine online
writers.ex - the professional and amateur writer's exchange


                       *** FULL INTERNET ACCESS! ***

BIX also features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription. 


                      ==============================
                      Rates and Connect Information:
                      ==============================


BIX membership costs $13 per month, plus connect time.  There are several 
different ways to connect:

SprintNet*              $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet:**               $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
(SprintNet and Tyment rates shown are for 48 contiguous US states only.)
                                                        
Tymnet Canada:          $4/hr eves/wkends           $9/hour weekdays

There is no surcharge for up to 10mb of Internet mail per month (sent
and received).  There will be a charge of $1 per 100,000 bytes 
thereafter.

                             ================


                20/20 PLAN OPTION (for USA-48 users only):

Volume users can choose the 20/20 Advantage Plan, which is $20 per month
and includes the first 20 hours of access by any combination of methods 
from the contiguous United States.  Additional use is $1.80 per hour 
(additional use for telnet access is $1 an hour).  The 20/20 Plan's cost is 
in addition to the $13 monthly fee.  


                           INTERNATIONAL USERS:

If you wish to connect internationally through Tymnet or SprintNet, 
please contact your local PTT.  BIX accepts prepaid international calls,
direct dial, or telnet connections.  In order to make a "collect" (not 
prepaid) call to BIX, your account must be verified before the charges 
are accepted.  When you complete the registration, we'll mail you a BIX
Membership Agreement by regular US Mail.  Whe you receive it, sign it 
and return it to us by mail.  When we receive it here, we'll authorize
your account to make reverse charged calls.

If you want to access BIX right away, contact your local PTT to set up a 
prepaid account.  You'll pay your local carrier for your calls to BIX in
advance, so there's no waiting period or verfication needed. Or, connect 
at BIX via telnet to x25.bix.com.

SprintNet international calls from most locations are $24 an hour.
Tymnet international charges vary, but are generally between $20-$30 an hour.


                           ====================
                           Billing Information: 
                           ====================

You can charge your monthly BIX membership fees to your Visa, 
Mastercard, Discover, or American Express card.

You may have your company invoiced for one or more BIX memberships with 
a BIX Corporate Account.  To do so, send by US Mail or fax a Purchase Order 
including a Purchase Order number, invoice address, contact person, a 
phone number where we can reach the contact person, and the company's 
fax number.  Please direct it to the attention of Connie Lopes, who
handles corporate accounts.  Our fax number is 617-491-6642.  Your 
corporate account will generally be set up within 24 hours.


                            ===================
                            To Sign Up For BIX:
                            ===================

   Dial by modem 1-800-695-4882 or 617-491-5410 * 
   (use 8 data bits, no parity, full duplex)

   Press a few carriage returns until you see the Login:(enter "bix") 
   prompt, then type  bix

   At the Name? prompt, type bix.amrpt

* Users already on the internet can telnet to x25.bix.com instead.
  At the USERNAME: prompt enter bix, then bix.net at the Name? prompt.
  Once your account is registered, you can connect the same way, except
  at the Name? prompt you'll enter your BIXname and then your password.


Using the above procedure will allow users in the 48 contiguous United 
States to take advantage of our special "5 for $5" offer.  This offer 
lets you use up to 5 hours of evening/weekend time on BIX during the 
current calender month (whatever month you sign up in), for $5.  
Additional time is $1.80 per hour ($1 per hour for telnet).  At the end 
of the calender month, you will be placed into our standard rate plan, 
at $13 monthly plus connect charges.  You may also join the 20/20 Plan 
at this time.

If you have other questions, please contact BIX Member Services 
at (800) 695-4775; send a fax to BIX at (617) 491-6642; or send Internet

- Somewhere, Texas

  It is rumored that Microbotics is working on an expansion board for the
  CD32.  This board will have parallel, serial, floppy, and IDE hard drive
  ports, plus RAM expansion and MPEG support.  No firm price has been set,
  but we anticipate it to run around £139.
