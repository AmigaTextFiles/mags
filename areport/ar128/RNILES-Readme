I can take over sending AR out over the internet list if you want, unless it's
easier or cheaper for you to do it.  If it doesn't cost you anything to send
stuff out from your board, then you wouldn't have to upload it to me on Delphi.
Just send it out normally and I can pick it up from Portal's Utility area.

Let me know how you want to do it.

Later.

Thanks!

Rob
