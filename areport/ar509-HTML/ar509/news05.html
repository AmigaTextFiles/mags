<p>Amiga Forever 1.0 Preview Edition Shipping

<p>Given the strong interest expressed by users after the original
announcement of Amiga Forever, a special "Preview Edition" of Amiga
Forever, with a version number of 1.0, has been released, slightly ahead of
the planned schedule.  This version allows the more technically-experienced
users to immediately explore many of the features of the final release,
without paying an additional price (the list price of the upgrade from the
preview version to the final version will not be higher than the difference
between the two).

<p>For additional information please refer to the Amiga Forever Home page
at <a href="http://www.cloanto.com/amiga/forever/">http://www.cloanto.com/amiga/forever/</a>.
The page has been recently extended with a Frequently Asked Questions
section.
