<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b>

<p>This tool is used locally to move the files you have in your download
directory to a local Aminet mirror on your harddisk.  The program uses the
*.readme files and the "Type:" field to determine where to put the files. 
If drawer(s) of the Type: field don't exists MTM will create them when
needed.  It also uses the Short: field (which is required in Aminet readme
files) as filecomment for the main archive.

<p><b>NEWS</b>

<p>o  New options.
<br>o  Checks filesize on old files and dumps it before copy/move
   (in verbose mode only).
<br>o  Bugfix: "couldn't create dir .." is fixed - was due to problems
   with files downloaded via a PC which add character code 13
   (RETURN code) to each line of the readme.
<br>o  Bugfix: make comment before moving/copying file.

<p><b>FEATURES</b>

<p>o  Uses the README file to determine where to put the files.
<br>o  If sub dirs of the destination (e.g. "util/misc") don't exist MTM will
   create the sub dirs.
<br>o  It can add file comments using the "Short:" field of the readme file.
   If used, the original file comment can be moved to the readme file.
<br>o  Can add short: as a file comment before move in case if there is
   missing a type: field.
<br>o  Can clone the original file's attributes such as file comment, date,
   and protection bits.
<br>o  Can use pattern matching to move certain files.
<br>o  Can either copy the files or move them (deletes the originals).
<br>o  You can choose to only copy the main files and exclude the readme files.
<br>o  You can choose to uppercase or lowercase all the sub dir names.
<br>o  Auto-corrects bad "type:" settings (ie. types with spaces).
<br>o  Debug/verbose option to watch every action.
<br>o  Prints size of the existing file (if any) and the new file size.
<br>o  Very fast copying routine (large-buffered).
<br>o  Small in size (core ~5 KB + texts and startup) and quick due to
   beeing written in assembler.
