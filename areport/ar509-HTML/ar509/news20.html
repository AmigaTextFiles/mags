<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b>

<p>MidiTracker is a MIDI sequencer that uses the 'tracker' concept for
composing songs, hence the name.  :-) Unlike other tracker programs that
have MIDI capabilities, MidiTracker has been designed specifically for MIDI
composing and does not use amiga audio (except for the metronome).  If you
have used trackers before, then it shouldn't take you too long to get
accustomed to MidiTracker.

<p>The intention with MidiTracker is to keep everything as dynamic as possible
thus giving you more freedom and control over your MIDI data within a
tracker environment.  For example, have you ever had the problem of wanting
to realtime record pitchbend, modulation, aftertouch and sustains but the
tracker either didn't get the notes properly or wasn't capable of doing so?
Miditracker can do it.
