<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b>

<p>tcpdl is a program which downloads files from a http host.  It can follow
links (across sites if required), and can be configured to ignore certain
file types.

<p>It makes full use of AmigaDOS multi-tasking, and can download up to 15
files at a time.  A status window reports current activity.

<p>tcpdlpp is a post processor for html files downloaded by tcpdl, which
converts all links to those files downloaded to relative URLs.  Links to
files that have not been downloaded are made to explicitly refer to the
site where they can be found.

<p>tcpdlpp provides a summary of the number of occurances of every link found,
for both downloaded files and remote URLs.

<p>Using these programs together allows you to make a local copy of selected
sites, which can be browsed off-line.  Links to files that have not been
downloaded can be followed when you are on-line.
