<p>It's been an interesting history in the Mac emulation market on the Amiga
if you've been keeping score, and much of the developments over the past 4
or 5 years have revolved around Jim Drew and his lesser-sung partner in
crime Joe Fenton.

<p>Mac emulation began with the A-Max, A-Max II and A-Max II+ from Readysoft
of Canada.  Black and white, back in the days of System 6, and the
emulation took over the Amiga--but you could reliably emulate a Mac for a
variety of purposes.  Then full-page ads started appearing in magazines for
an emulator (Emplant) which would be full-color, full-multitasking Mac
emulation.  While it got off to a shaky start and required several software
revisions to stabilize, Emplant eventually delivered.

<p>Readysoft tried to counter with A-Max IV, which offered similar features
to Emplant but didn't keep step with upgrades and eventually fell by the
wayside.

<p>Emplant ruled the scene for quite some time.  Then came ShapeShifter from
Christian Bauer, and for the first time Amiga users didn't have to pay
hundreds of dollars for a hardware and software based emulation package.
ShapeShifter was shareware.  It didn't take all that long for Emplant to
follow suit with a version that did not require the custom Zorro board of
earlier versions.

<p>But the market spoke and seemed very happy with Shapeshifter, which was
being frequently updated and was widely available.

<p>Drew and Fenton were hardly done, though.  They started regrouping and, in
the meanwhile, Bauer discovered Be, Inc. and their fledgeling BeOS.  Much
of his development efforts have shifted over to that platform, making
Shapeshifter upgrades few and far between.

<p>Enter FUSION.  Drew and Fenton (now operating under the Microcode Solutions
name) have released a hardware-independent Mac emulator which seems to
offer the features of Shapeshifter along with a more active level of
support.

<p>FUSION, like any Mac emulator, requires the native Macintosh ROM to
function properly.  If you're interested in Mac emulation, by now you
probably know the standard things to expect.  It's the new stuff in FUSION
that's quite interesting.

<p>FUSION has a wide variety of graphics board drivers, including some very
speedy CyberGraphX and Picasso96 "direct" modes, offering increased speed
at the expense of some graphical glitches if you switch over to another
screen and the Mac screen keeps updating.  It also has the best Mac/Amiga
filesharing I've seen on a Mac emulator.  You can mount Mac partitions on
AmigaDOS, making them accessible through Workbench and the shell, as well
as any other programs you like.  (DirOpus 5 can address them as well
although you need to manually call them up through a lister.)

<p>FUSION has a "pseudo 24-bit" fallback emulation mode for those programs
which are not 32-bit clean (but purport to be--you can't run the really old
stuff this way.) I've so far only found one game that this applies to, but
there may be other software out there that you would find it useful with.

<p>FUSION will make use of AHI as well, offering full 16 bit support.
ShapeShifter can use AHI but only pumps 8-bit audio through the AHI device.

<p>Modem and printer Port support, the little annoying but necessary memory
patch utility, they're all here.  FUSION's CD-ROM support was pretty touchy
and wouldn't recognize a number of discs until Jim Drew put out a new
driver (See below.)  I no longer find myself installing software on
Shapeshifter so I can run it under FUSION.

<p>FUSION's price varies worldwide but you should expect to pay under US$80 to
run it.  If you're not using FUSION 2.0 you should upgrade, as they fixed a
number of the annoying glitches from the earlier versions.  It looks like
Drew has regained the dominant market position for Mac emulation on the
Amiga once more.

<p>FUSION is published and distributed worldwide by Blittersoft.

<p>Those of you who have followed my reviews of PCx and have heard me talk
about FUSION know that I've never had good luck with the CD-ROM support. 
Well, most of the problems seem to be solved.  Microcode Solutions just
released a new CD support device for both emulators which does a far better
job recognizing real-world CD-ROMs.

<p>Some time ago, Microcode promised to release a low-cost emulation bundle
of an Atari 8-bit and Apple II emulator on CD-ROM.  These plans were
stalled and now it looks like the emulators may simply be distributed
online as free or shareware.  The PowerMac incarnation of the Microcode
Atari emulator has already been released.  I was fortunate enough to see an
early version of the Amiga emulator and was very impressed...and am very
embarrassed to report that I subsequently lost it.  The Apple II emulator
didn't seem to offer much of anything that we didn't have already through
Apple 2000.  We'll see what happens when they're finally released.

<p>The floodgates have opened and we've been inundated with Nintendo
Entertainment System (NES) emulators for the Amiga lately.  No less than
four authors or teams are working to bring high-quality NES emulation to
the Amiga.  Some are doing a better job than others...

<p><b><font size=+1>DarkNESs:</font></b>
<p>To my recollection, the first one released and the one who got the ball
rolling.  Mark Van Hal has also tried his hand at Sega MasterSystem
emulation and his standard is the same here--shoot for high graphical
support, including graphics cards.  DarkNESs is stable although not always
the speediest emulator.  It supports double-buffering and frameskipping.

<p><b><font size=+1>AmiNES:</font></b>
<p>From Juan Antonio Gomez, who also created AmiGameBoy, AmiMSX, and
AmiMasterGear.  Never intended to be finished, Gomez' emulator works fairly
well for the limited range of games it is compatible with.  Takes over the
system, and when you quit a guru is probably not too far distant in the
future...

<p><b><font size=+1>CoolNESs:</font></b>
<p>And the puns keep rolling in.  CoolNESs from Fredrik Olsson offers sound
support (only to registered users--the thing to get you to register.  But
if you don't know how good the sound support is before paying...),
generally quicker graphics than DarkNESs, and a straight PAL AGA display. 
The documentation claims that some games run at full speed even on an
030/25, although on games I'd really like to play there were still the
occasional glitches on an 060/50.  (Contra in particular.) The speed is
quite respectible, however.  The CD32 gamepad is supported, a significant
improvement over using the keyboard.

<p><b><font size=+1>A/Nes:</font></b>
<p>Just don't pronounce it as one word and we'll be fine.  A/Nes from Fredrik
Schultz and Morgan Johansson offers the most polished GUI of all of the
emulators, and is probably the overall best to use, although CoolNESs still
performs better on some games (like Contra).  CD32 gamepad and sound
support requires registration.

<p>All of the emulators are available from Aminet in <font size=+1><tt>misc/emu.</tt></font>

<p>For the November 1997 issue of CU Amiga, I was asked to do a feature on
using Mac emulators to play Mac games on the Amiga.  I wound up writing way
too much.  What got published was really just an overview--below are some
game capsule reviews which would be a shame to let go to waste.

<br><p><table width=100% border=0 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=0>

<tr><td bgcolor=000000></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The obsession of the Amiga gaming market for years now, which as of this
writing has still not produced a major title legally ported across from
another system.  But the Mac has a ready supply waiting for your killing
urges.

<p>The forerunners of the genre, Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, are available, but
they're somewhat passe, n'est-ce pas?  Instead of revisiting old territory,
here's what's more current.

<p><b><font size=+1>Duke Nuke'm Atomic Edition:</font></b>
<p>This was the 3D game that shook people out of
their funk while they waited for Quake to come along.  Duke took the basic
Doom approach but gave it a set of really fun, sometimes campy weapons
(shrink ray, anyone?), a ridiculously macho hero, and a great attention to
design and atmosphere and created a game that doesn't become repetitive
after the first three levels.  Duke on the Mac was welcomed by the
game-starved masses, who wanted to hear Duke preen for a mirror and say
"Damn, I'm lookin' good!"
<p>One of the complaints about Duke is that the variety of enemies was
limited--this is definitely true in the first mission but was improved upon
for the other three.  The levels range from very linear to large and mazey,
although most stay away from being so complicated "hunt the key" wise that
they become boring.  And the cheat codes are included in the manual, so
what's there to complain about?
<p>Duke can be played on a fast 030 system and AGA, but I'd recommend using
FUSION or one of the go-faster Shapeshifter video drivers if you don't have
access to a video card.  On an 060/CyberGraphX system, Duke completely
hauls.  The game offers hints for keeping the speed playable--smaller
window size is always obvious, but you can also choose to draw only every
other line and play at a lower difficulty level (less monsters=less CPU
time spent controlling them.) Even if the game looks ok while you run
around, leave a safety cushion--combat tends to slow things down, as do the
scary little _Alien_ knockoff beasties.  (When half a dozen hatch and come
after you, it's frightening enough trying to get away without the game
seizing up on you.)
<p>Duke is a lot of fun.  Turn the speakers up and put on a smirk.  The game
doesn't take itself seriously, so you can just have a good time.
<p><i>Stars: *****
<br>Requires: Fast 030 or better, CD-ROM.  040 and graphics card recommended
<br>Compatible: Both Shapeshifter and FUSION.
<br>Price: About US$45</i>

<p><b><font size=+1>Dark Forces:</font></b>
<p>When I first saw Dark Forces, it was an alpha version running
on a 486/100 on a table at the Chicago CES in 1994.  It was so primitive
that nobody could shoot at anybody, and the bad guys had a habit of walking
through walls, floors, and ceilings.  The game came along quite nicely, I'm
happy to report.  While it got written off as mediocre in the PC mags, I
think Dark Forces is the most clever and enjoyable "man against the world"
Doom clone I've ever played.
<p>Perhaps it's got an unfair advantage since it draws on the Star Wars
universe, but the game creates a sense of atmosphere above and beyond most
of the carbon-copy first-person shooters out there.  I'm not the world's
biggest Star Wars fan, but there's a certain level of extra satisfaction in
shooting an Imperial officer than there is in killing some impossible demon
monster.  The use of the angled gun which doesn't shoot in a straight line
straight in front of you is an excellent innovation as well--and the extra
challenge is probably what those lazy PC reviewers hated.
<p><i>Stars: *****
<br>Requires: Fast 030 or better, CD-ROM.  Graphics card recommended.

System 7.6 and Shapeshifter.

<p><b><font size=+1>Marathon:</font></b>
<p>The Mac market's big home-grown 3D shooter: its AB3D, or Gloom,
if you prefer.  Like most of these games, it's you against the world.
"You" in this case are the sole (to your and the computer's knowledge)
survivor of an attack by an unknown alien force on your spaceship, the
Marathon.  All you have at the outset is a pistol, a few clips, and the
occasional advice of the computer--and even that is unreliable after a
while.  The aliens are funny-looking guys in a variety of colors who carry
pain sticks or various energy weapons.  Your goal is to survive, find out
who the aliens are, and repel them.
<p>Marathon's graphics are a nice change from the mega-chunky look of most
games of this ilk--the spaceship looks polished and smooth, and the
monsters look fairly lifelike, although their animation is stilted.  Combat
is pretty difficult since aiming is fairly picky, and ammunition is very
difficult to come by--making the game more cerebral than some others.  The
pace is good and you do get the sense of urgency as you and the computer
race against the bad guys.
<p>The strange thing about Marathon's engine, which I found very difficult to
work around, is the way you move.  It's much more like gliding than
walking--rather like Wolfenstein 3D, but in a way worse because Wolf3D was
cartoonish and it fit the overall design better.
<p>Marathon is decent, but definitely not best of show.  The demo is available
practically everywhere, so it won't hurt to see if you disagree with my
evaluation.  Any 040 should be enough to run Marathon near full capacity.
<p><i>Stars: ***
<br>Requires: Fast 030 or better.
<br>Compatible: Both.
<br>Price: About US$30</i>

<p><b><font size=+1>Damage, Inc.:</font></b>
<p>I had never heard of Damage Inc.  before it arrived in the box from
MacSoft.  After playing it, I have to say I'm completely shocked.
<p>I am a little sick and tired of being pitted against the world with just a
pistol in my hand, taken completely by surprise at the hordes of aliens or
mutants or rednecks who want to kill me.  I want professional planning, air
support, and a team I can rely on when I do my killing.  Damage, Inc.
gives me exactly that.
<p>The idea behind Damage Inc.  is that you are a field leader for FITICA, a
crack unit of the US Marine Corps dedicated to top-secret assault and
recovery missions.  You can assemble a team of marines (up to four), armed
to the teeth, typically with hand grenades, a pistol, and a rifle with
grenade launcher.  You are similary equipped, and given a set of mission
objectives--sometimes simply clearing an area of baddies to find an
entrance to an enemy base, or rescuing hostages, or something perhaps more
important to national security.  As you go on, you learn more about
FITICA's real objectives (after all, you're field personnel, not an
officer).
<p>Damage is based on the Marathon engine, but forget the nasty things I said
about it, because the Damage crew fixed it up.  You travel through the very
convincing 3D environments at a very good clip, and the arsenal at your
disposal will cut down your enemies in a variety of effective fashions. 
But remember that team I mentioned?  They'll take their best shot at the
bad guys too--and most of the time they're better shots than you, too. 
They have rudimentary AI and can accept simple commands (explore a
direction, seek and destroy enemies, or follow you or another team member.)
Friendly fire does become a serious concern in heated firefights, and it's
up to you to make sure you don't blow away one of your own squad, or that
you don't take a shotgun shell in the back from an overzealous Marine.
<p>It would probably be enough for the missions and the graphics to be as
engrossing as they are, but what really puts the game over the top is the
digitized speech.  Each of the twelve Marines has their own personality,
and they acknowledge all of your commands as well as offer their own
commentary on the subjects they hold dear.  One believes he's John Wayne,
another kills for Christ, one hates violence but is so dedicated to the
Corps he will solemnly kill anyone who threatens his teammates.  Of
particular interest is Banzai, who peppers the action with totally
inappropriate comments.  (After gunning down a white supremist, Banzai
offers: "I hope I don't meet him in the afterlife.  'Oh, hi, I killed
you.'")
<p>Damage is a great cure for the sameness in a lot of 3D shooters.  Highly
recommended.

<p>While some software manufacturers on the Amiga have finally
taken to bundling several old titles at a single title retail price, few
have taken the logical step to doing it on CD-ROM, keeping their price
higher than it should be because they're copying all those floppies.  The
Mac market has moved beyond this, and you can find multi-CD sets for very
reasonable prices.

<p><b><font size=+1>Budget Bundle #1: Aztech's Mac Pack Counter Attack</font></b>
<p>Retailing at around US$30, this pack contains 5 CD-ROMs with a variety
of games and "edutainment" commercial titles.  There are some hits and
misses here.

<p><b><font size=+1>BB#1 - Lunicus:</font></b>
<p>Straight out of the bad old early days of multimedia CD-ROMs. 
This sad attempt at an engrossing space adventure RPG (sort of) was paid
for by Paramount, the massive Hollywood movie company.  It didn't do much
good.  Lunicus is slow and plodding, with plain graphics.  Lots of
digitized conversation isn't enough to make you care about the people or
the places you need to go to figure out why you're playing this game. 
Avoid.   
<br>Stars: * 
<br>Requires: 030, CD-ROM.  
<br>Compatible: Shapeshifer.  FUSION can run the game but with garbled audio.</i>

<p><b><font size=+1>BB#1 - Sim City Classic:</font></b>
<p>Just what it says, a classic.  The Mac version is
graphically rich and will run on a variety of systems.  Sim City isn't for
everyone (I personally find that many sim games try too hard to be
realistic, and that I'd just be better off getting a job as a theme park
manager and being paid for my efforts rather than slave over an unforgiving
simulation), but Sim City has, in my view, a pretty balanced system of
challenges and rewards.  Two versions, one with fewer colors and less
processor requirement, are included, meaning just about anybody should be
able to run Sim City.
<p><i>Stars: ****
<br>Requires: 020, CD-ROM.  Faster system recommended.
<br>Compatible: Both.</i>

<p><b><font size=+1>BB#1 - Leisure Suit Larry 6:</font></b>
<p>From the folks at Sierra, who also bring you the
King's Quest and Police Quest series.  Faced with the option of playing a
Sierra sequel or beating the proverbial dead horse, the latter often has a
lot of appeal.  The original Leisure Suit Larry was actually a tribute and
recreation of Sierra's early smash hit text adventure "Softporn Adventure",
and was whimsical and sophomoric despite not being everybody's cup of tea.
LSL6 has come a long way since the more primitive 16 color graphics of the
original, has added a fully digitized soundtrack (all game response is
verbal, not textual), and a whole new sex farce adventure to run that
squirmy little weasel Larry Laffer through.  It might be good for a laugh,
you might just enjoy puzzle solving for its own sake, but my guess is that
only Larry completists will run for this game.
<p>Actually, LSL6 (and most Sierra games in general) wouldn't be so bad if it
weren't for the horrible interface they keep insisting on using.  Lucasarts
got it right, Sierra got it wrong, and their customers keep paying the
price.
<p><i>Stars: ***
<br>Requires: Fast 030 or 040 system, CD-ROM.  Faster system recommended.
<br>Compatible: Both.</i>

<p><b><font size=+1>BB#1 - King's Quest VII:</font></b>
<p>Included in the Counter Attack pack is another sequel to the venerable
King's Quest saga which made Sierra rich and made Roberta Williams possibly
the most famous woman game designer in history (and in the top echelon of
the co-ed list as well!) KQ VII proved incompatible with both emulators for
different reasons: ShapeShifter crashed shortly after the title screen,
while FUSION can play the game but the audio is garbled (as in Police Quest
IV, see below).

<p>Perhaps the most disappointing part of the Counter Attack pack is the
CD-ROM which neither emulator nor the Amiga's CD filesystem can read,
containing Outpost, Jump Raven, and Space Madness.  Another "watch and
see".

<p>Counter Attack Pack overall rating: ***.  Will probably be a 4-star entry
if those CD-ROM issues get sorted out, although part of the problem is the
shoddy job Aztech did in their mastering process.  Not having access to
that disc of 3 games is a big problem.  If you have access to a real Mac,
you might want to try using it to shuttle these games across to your Amiga
system.

<p><b><font size=+1>Budget Bundle #2: Aztech Mac Pack Sneak Attack</font></b>
<p>After the Counter Attack, Aztech drummed up more titles for a 4-CD
release, again for about US$30.  Here's how the notable games fare:

<p><b><font size=+1>BB#2 - Blackthorne:</font></b>
<p> The 1996 copyright on this game gives me the impression that
the market didn't respond too well to this one.  Blackthorne is an
unapologetic derivative of Prince of Persia, except instead of a lithe
martial artist, you're a burly guy with a huge shotgun and hover bombs.
You jump across lots of holes which are "just a little too long" to land on
your feet, so you have to pull yourself up, etc. etc.  One interesting
innovation which most side-to-side platform type games never get around to
implementing is ability to dodge--your character can stand flush up against
any wall, rendering him impervious to most of the things the bad guys shoot
at you.  It also means you can't shoot them, though.
<p>Blackthorne is nothing special--the graphics are nice but there's not a big
hook to keep you playing.  If you decide you're interested, though, it
would occupy an afternoon or two.
<p><i>Stars: ***
<br>Requires: 030.
<br>Compatible: Both.</i>

<p><b><font size=+1>BB#2 - Police Quest IV: Open Season:</font></b>
<p>Sierra's not afraid to make sequels, although
for the Police Quest games they've tried to take their time to make games
which are procedurally accurate, and, since PQ 3, somewhat grotesque as
well.  PQ IV is similar to Leisure Suit Larry 6 in that all of the game
response is verbal rather than textual--this can be a real problem,
however, if the game gets slowed down and a stray mouse click skips over a
very important detail.  I can't help but think that a different
interface--any interface--would be better than what Sierra offers.
<p>The colors in PQ IV are rather washed out, which is odd considering Mac
games if anything tend toward the garish--but this is an uninspired port
from the PC, the same thing Sierra did to Amiga users with unfortunate
regularity.
<p><i>Stars: ***
<br>Requires: Fast 030, 040 recommended.
<br>Compatible: ShapeShifter.  (FUSION ran the game but audio was garbled.)</i>

<p><b><font size=+1>BB#2 - Shadow Wraith:</font></b>
<p>Out of all the games I played for this review, this is
probably the most "Amiga-like".  You are the pilot of a super single-seater
jet plane in "cyberspace".  Oh, never mind where you're supposed to be,
it's a high-tech maze full of nasty little cubes and enemy fighters who
want to kill you in the worst way.  You have a machine gun, missiles,
mines, and grenades at your disposal as you whip through the maze,
collecting keys and hitting the afterburners to make it through to the next
level.
<p>The smoothness of the graphics is phenomenal, and not in the artificial way
most Mac games tend to feel when they try to accomplish this.  If a little
hard to control with the keyboard (remember what I said about joysticks!),
Shadow Wraith is a lot of fun for those of you who hearken back to the
salad days of Psygnosis.
<p><i>Stars: ****
<br>Requires: 030.
<br>Compatible: FUSION.  (Requires FUSION's "pseudo-24 bit" mode as Shadow
Wraith was somewhat poorly coded.)</i>

<p><b><font size=+1>BB#2 - Brain Dead 13:</font></b>
<p>Oh, the irony!  Brain Dead 13 is the game Readysoft dropped all of its
Amiga development and support in favor of producing.  Among the dropped
products was A-Max IV, the Mac emulator!
<p>Other than A-Max, Readysoft has one major claim to fame--they ported the
Dragon's Lair and Space Ace games to personal computers including the
Amiga, and developed sequels and knockoffs (like Guy Spy).  So, when in
1994 they wanted a new product, what else would they choose but a game in
the genre they knew best?  Of course, impossible and illogical animation
slideshows!
<p>The quality of the animation in BD13 shows a lot of work--Readysoft claimed
in an interview I did with them at the time that they had over 100 artists
working on it.  But 1,000,000 artists can't make these games enjoyable as
anything other than walkthroughs, with the exact winning sequence of moves
ready at hand.  There is absolutely no way to be a "good" player of these
games--it requires you to be patient and figure out every move, usually by
trial and error, and keep at it until you win.  I saw a lot of copies of
Brain Dead 13 for the PC and game consoles get dusty at local computer
stores.  With good reason.
<p><i>Stars: ** if you don't have the walkthrough, **** if you do

<p><b><font size=+1>BB#2 - A-10 Attack!:</font></b>
<p>Combat flight simulator.  The first thing you should do if you really
want to play this is print out the documentation--these Aztech packs come
with no printed documentation and it is impossible to successfully fly a
simulator unless you know what the buttons and knobs are and how to use
them.  The game puts you in the cockpit and allows you to fly a variety of
exploration and combat missions, although it mostly serves as an ad for the
game which followed, A-10 Cuba.  If you were disappointed by JETPilot maybe
you should take a look, but on the other hand F/A 18 Interceptor is still
more fun.
<p><i>Stars: **
<br>Requires: 040.
<br>Compatible: Both.</i>

<p><b><font size=+1>BB#2 - Masterpieces of Infocom:</font></b>
<p>The nearly entire back catalog of Infocom text adventures.  With the
exception of Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy (the rights to which now
belong to Douglas Adams, not Infocom) and a couple of forgettable graphical
games, this is the entire collection of Infocom's work in the 80s, when
they defined adventure games.  Comes complete with Adobe Acrobat
documentation--not as good as the toys and clever packaging of the
originals, but since you're paying so little for each game it's difficult
to complain.  While not every game was a "masterpiece", a great number

<p><b><font size=+1>Budget Bundle #3: Alone In the Dark Trilogy</font></b>
<p>For about US$30, you can pick up the Alone in the Dark trilogy series.
These games, originally developed by Infogrames (now called I-Motion),
tried to capture the elements of 3D gaming in a way fast enough for most
computers to run.  The result was a compromise--3D characters in a set of
static, conventionally drawn landscapes.  Combined with atmospheric
storylines, the games are still classics.
<p>By far the best game is the original--it plays like a classic horror novel.
Its engine is perhaps a little less polished than in the later games
(although few changes were made for the future games--they were made
because the development cost was so low and the enthusiasm for the products
pretty high), but the unfortunate part is that the Mac implementation of
the first game was poor, so it does not run nearly as fast as the other
two.  You'll probably need to stay in 320x200 mode on any system, even the
fastest.  For 2 and 3 you can bump up the resolution.
<p>Alone 2 and 3 pit you against more supernatural foes, but it starts to feel
a little played out.  The actual navigation of the worlds is a bit easier,
so they're worth checking out.

<p>Yes, the Mac has a pretty active free and shareware
developer base, too.  Not everything is a work of art (many are living
examples of why you maybe should NOT put a sampler port on every machine
you ship) but there are some games you should really check out given half a
chance.  The home of Info-Mac, the Mac shareware archive, is at
ftp.hawaii.edu.

<p><b><font size=+1>Arashi:</font></b>
<p>Ever wanted to play the arcade classic Tempest on your computer?  This
is it, practically blow for blow.   The vector game looks great on a decent
configuration, and the mouse control is actually pretty comfortable.
Unless you've got an Amiga with a high enough spec to run Tempest through
arcade emulation, check out Arashi.

<p><b><font size=+1>Rescue!:</font></b>
<p>Since time immemorial (we're talking decades, here), computer geeks have
written games based on Star Trek.  Up until the 80s, these were text-based,
where you entered warp speed and direction and gave phaser energy to shoot
at Klingons who wanted to blow up starbases.  Rescue took this to an art
form, with authentic graphics, sounds, and great action gameplay for the
90s.  Unfortunately, the higher profile 90s meant that Paramount, who owns
Star Trek, saw his activities and didn't take kindly to the heavy use of
their trademarked material.  Rescue shed some of the original Star Trek
spellings in later releases, and it seems that in late 1994 he gave up the
project entirely.

<p>Which is a damn shame, because Rescue is a lot of fun.  Your job is to
rescue colonists from defenseless outposts, as a major invasion of Rulans
and Cardaians (remember that changed spelling) threatens their safety.  The
Kigons are your allies, and the Fengis are generally neutral (although
they'll pitch in with you if the odds are good, or take a potshot at you if
your shields are damaged.)  You have to ferry the colonists to starbases,
which can come in handy as resupply posts as well as teammates in a
fight--but even starbases can fall to the Rulan Superhawks, which can
cloak themselves.  You can face over 30 enemies, and if that's not enough,
you can set the game to send the Borg after you.  (Alternately, if you make
Q, who makes a guest appearance in the game, mad, he'll summon them to
waste you.)

<p>Rescue is not enormously speed intensive--if you need to, you can kill the
sounds or play in monochrome mode.  The killer is that the interface is
somewhat large, spread out over several windows, so a standard Amiga NTSC
or PAL resolution display may make having everything easily accessible
difficult.  Even at 800x600, you can't fit all of the windows on the
screen--it's not always necessary, though.
<p><i>Stars: *****
<br>Requires: 030.  Graphics card recommended for large display.
<br>Compatible: Both</i>

<p><b><font size=+1>Solarian II:</font></b>
<p>If you have Mac owning friends who've told you about a game they love,
odds are pretty good it's Solarian II.  I'm not sure why, however.  It's
Space Invaders, with the twist that your enemies do not move sideways
across the screen but spin in circles at the top, and some of them
dive-bomb you with 100% deadly accuracy.  But it's tough to control and not
enough of an improvement on the original design to make it better or more
worthy than, say, Deluxe Galaga (or the arcade Galaga itself.) The samples
are really annoying, too.

<p>This isn't a shopping list, it's an overview.  There's a lot more out
there.  If you want to look into these titles further, or want to buy and

<p>Remember--using your Amiga's resources to play these games isn't
"abandoning" the Amiga or somehow diminishing the efforts of Amiga game
programmers.  Mac emulators broaden the horizons of what your Amiga can
run, and you've got a unique opportunity to draw on two large software
libraries.  Enjoy the treasures out there.
