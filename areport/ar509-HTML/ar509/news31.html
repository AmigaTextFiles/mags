<p>The Alpha-test version of REBOL/Core is in its final stage of development
and internal testing.  Over the last month the software has become stable
enough to use for important jobs, such as running our email list server
(Rebot) and converting our reference documentation to HTML.  Over the week
ahead we will be finishing a few important documents and will begin to
distribute the main program, documentation, and examples to the people on
our Email Announcement List who have asked to test it.

<p>Why just an Alpha Release?

<p>This release of REBOL/Core is packed with many useful datatypes and
functions; however, we consider this to be an Alpha because some of the
main concepts are still evolving.  We need the freedom to continue to
improve REBOL's core technology without concern for compatibility of an
application base.

<p>In other words...  function names and operations are subject to change as
testing proceeds.  (Prototypes testers should expect that the Alpha will be
different from the earlier versions.) In addition there are a number of
crucial features that are not currently implemented that we would like to
include in the Beta release.

<p>REBOL on Multiple Platforms!

<pDuring October Carl ported the REBOL/Core to a few other platforms,
primarily as a test of kernel code computability.  The Alpha version now
runs on the Amiga, Linux (X86), PC, and Macintosh.  All of these will be
available for Alpha release, and we expect to add other platforms in the
months ahead.

<p>How to obtain REBOL

<p>REBOL is not yet available for general distribution.  However, if you would
like a private copy of the Alpha release for testing, join our Email List
for information and instructions.

<p>What Does it Cost?

<p>We are planning to release REBOL as shareware ($50 US) for private
non-commercial and educational uses.  This will be a fully enabled version,
with no sly shareware limitations, tricks, or gimmicks.  Commercial,
packaged, and licensed versions will also be available for businesses,
institutions, and government use.  However, we remain open to your comments
on this topic.

<p><center>What is REBOL?</center>

<p>REBOL is the Relative Expression-Based Object Language designed over
several years by Carl Sassenrath, the software architect known for the
Amiga multitasking operating system.

<p>REBOL offers an easy way to share and exchange information and functions
between computers and applications.  It is designed for organizing data and
executing simple tasks.  REBOL is meant for users, hobbyists, educators,
web writers, multimedia authors, technicians, experimenters...  anyone who
seeks solutions to various problems that they face in the modern world of
network computing.

<p>If you've written HTML or shell scripts, you can write REBOL.  It is a
messaging language, not a programming language.  In essence, REBOL scripts
treat the Internet as if it were your own personal computer.  Messages can
be transferred using existing Email, Web, and FTP (file transfer), but it
will also allow direct communications through a new type of message port. 
Messages can be as simple as a single line or as complex as a
mini-application.

<p>How is REBOL pronounced?  We say it as in the noun rebel, which means "a
person who resists authority, suppression, or domination".  (And, a lot of
people like to add the words "of Microsoft" to the end of that definition.)

<p>REBOL Examples

<p>A few examples will quickly provide you a general sense of how REBOL can be
used.  If you want to print text, you can do so with a single line such as:

<p><tt>print "Hello World!"</tt>

<p>or, if you want to send that text as an email message to a friend:

<p><tt>send friend@domain.com "Hello World!"</tt>

<p>To execute a REBOL script stored on a web site:

<p><tt>do http://www.rebol.com/scripts/address-book.r</tt>

<p>or, from an FTP site (anonymous login used here):

<p><tt>do ftp://rebol.com/scripts/address-book.r</tt>

<p>If you want to grab a web page and save it as a file, you could write two
lines:

<p><tt>file: load http://www.cnet.com
<br>save %cnet.html file</tt>

<p>or just the line:

<p><tt>save %cnet.html load http://www.cnet.com</tt>

<p>But, what if you need to send that page to a friend:

<p><tt>send friend@domain.com load http://www.cnet.com</tt>

<p>Or, maybe you want to examine your email, but you don't want to remove it
from the server quite yet:

<p><tt>foreach message mailbox [print message]</tt>

<p>However, suppose you need to do a few, more sophisticated operations, like
getting information from your friend's address book application:

<p><pre>
info: ask rebol:domain.com/friend/address-book [
    find-name "billy"
]</pre>

<p>which you're going to store in your own address book application running as
a separate program on your computer:

<p><tt>send rebol:/address-book/new-entry info</tt>

<p>Another friend wants you to email all the files in your current directory:

<p><tt>files: load %*
<br>foreach file files [send ami@there.net load file]</tt>

<p>or, perhaps all the files should be sent as a single message:

<p><tt>message: ""
<br>foreach file files [copy tail message load file]
<br>send ami@there.net message</tt>

<p>In thinking about it, you decide now would be a good time to send your broker
that stock transaction (which her computer receives and auto-executes):

<p><pre>
send broker@sell-it-now.com {
    Company: "Microsoft"
    Symbol:  MSFT
    Shares:  1000
    Price:   132.54
    Action:  sell
]</pre>

<p>Your boss wants several web pages emailed to him at 10:30AM each morning
for the next ten days.  So, you fire up a separate unattended REBOL task:

<p><pre>
bossy: make task! [
    pages: [
        http://www.cnet.com
        http://www.rebol.com/docs/doc.html
        http://www.news-wire.com/news/today.html
    ]
 
    loop 10 [
       wait 10:25AM  ; (boss likes stuff early)
       foreach page pages [send boss@work.net load page]
    ]
]
do bossy  ; (make it happen)</pre>

<p>Or (this one is "complicated"), your friend is going to send you an email
with a REBOL script that you need to execute as soon as it arrives, then
send the result back to her:

<p><pre>
wait mailbox
foreach message mailbox [
    if ? find message hillary@wh.gov [
        send hillary@wh.gov do message
    ]
]</pre>

<p>You get the idea!  But, how would you ever know it could be this easy?  To
start, we will provide 101 basic scripts on our WWW.REBOL.COM web site.  In
addition, we will archive thousands of scripts written by others...  as
source code that you can use to create your own messages and scripts.

<p>REBOL v.s. Java

<p>They are totally different.  REBOL, as was said above, is for sending
messages, organizing data and executing simple tasks...  and, it is meant
for users, hobbyists, educators, web writers, multimedia authors,
technicians and experimenters.  The examples above give you an idea of how
it can be applied.

<p>Java is an advanced object-oriented distributed programming language meant
for software engineers and application designers.  It is very good...  what
C++ should have been ten years ago.  In Java the "Hello World" example
above would be:

<p><pre>
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main (String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}</pre>

<p>To those who understand object-oriented programming, Java is good stuff. 
Programmers love it!  But...  more casual users might want other choices
too.

<p>E-Mail Announcement List

<p>If you would like to be kept informed of REBOL news and releases, please
send a message to our REBOL "BOT" (written in REBOL of course):

<p>To: <a href="mailto:rebot@sassenrath.com">rebot@sassenrath.com</a> (yes rebot, not rebol)
<br>Subject: Add

<p>You will receive a confirmation that you have been added to the list, and
you can remove your name at any time.  More features will be added to Rebot
in the future, such as allowing you to request documentation, examples,
program updates, registration, applications, etc.

<p>Reference Manual Changes...

<p>Due to a shortage of resources, the REBOL Reference Manual previously
published on this Web site has fallen behind actual changes.  Although the
basic ideas remain the same, a few of the details have changed and new
concepts have been introduced (many aspects of the system have not yet been
published, e.g.  the concepts of Paths, Ports, and Tasks).  We will be
publishing the manual again, once it has been updated.
