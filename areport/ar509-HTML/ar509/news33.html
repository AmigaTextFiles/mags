<p>Fred Fish and Cronus have come through for Amiga Report again!

<p>Effective immediately, a new mailing list for Amiga Report readers is
available.  The list will be used for general announcements about the
magazine--usually, to inform readers that a new issue of the magazine is
now available and online for viewing and downloading, for those who prefer
to browse online or FTP from Aminet rather than receive AR in their
mailbox.

<p>To subscribe to this list, send e-mail to <a href="mailto:majordomo@ninemoons.com">majordomo@ninemoons.com</a> and in
the body of the message, place the text:

<p><tt>subscribe areport-announce</tt>

<p>You will be added to the list.

<p>Amiga Report will be distributed in HTML archives on the current, main
mailing list.  If you wish to continue receiving AR in this form, do
nothing.  If you are not presently on the list and want the HTML archives
sent to you, send to the above address but place

<p><tt>subscribe areport</tt>

<p>in the body.

<p>Similarly, if you wish to stop receiving Amiga Report in the mail, send

<p><tt>unsubscribe areport</tt>

<p>to the above address.

<p>So, for example, if you are presently an Amiga Report subscriber but wish
only to be told when AR is available so you can view it on your favorite AR
mirror, you would want to send

<p><tt>subscribe areport-announce
<br>unsubscribe areport</tt>

<p>to <a href="mailto:majordomo@ninemoons.com">majordomo@ninemoons.com</a>.
