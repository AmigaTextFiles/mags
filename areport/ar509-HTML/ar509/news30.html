<p>November 13, 1997 - Earlier this week Longbow Digital Arts (LDA) announced
the release of Tiger's Bane, its first shareware release for the Amiga
family of personal computers.  Tiger's Bane is a mix of side-scrolling
action game and flight simulation, letting the player experience modern
helicopter warfare through a combination of fast action graphics and
realistic flight controls, weapon systems, and battlefield hardware.

<p>Tiger's Bane isn't your average action game, according to Seumas McNally,
the game's designer, "I wanted to create a game that would blend the
excitement and action of a side view shoot-'em-up with some of the realism
of a flight simulation.  In Bane you have to think before mindlessly firing
off your weapons, and you have to think about which weapons and helicopters
to bring along in the first place."

<p>The registered version of Tiger's Bane features 5 Operations with more than
80 missions in total, 7 flyable helicopters, up to two computer controlled
wingmen, F-16 and A-10 air support, over 25 different enemy and allied
ground, air, and sea units, weather effects, night and day missions,
multiple skill levels, and a random mission generator.

<p>Tiger's Bane is currently available from the Longbow Digital Arts web site
at "<a href="http://www.kanservu.ca/~longbow/">http://www.kanservu.ca/~longbow/</a>",
or through your local AmiNet archive mirror site as
"<tt>/pub/aminet/game/shoot/TigersBane.lha</tt>".
