<center>AWeb-II, 3.0b patch update for v3.0 now available!</center>
<hr><br><p>

<p>An update for version 3.0 to 3.0b of AWeb is now available from our website
as a patch archive for download by all 3.0 owners.  You must have installed
AWeb-II version 3.0 previously before you can install this patch, and you
will need your original 3.0 disks.

<p>New in this version
<hr>
<br><b>o Fixes the following bugs:</b>
<br>- AWeb could hang or crash (01000008, semaphore in illegal state)
sometimes.
<br>- Large paragraphs of text could be messed up.
<br>- Small images on a line by themselves could take up too much vertical
space.
<br>- Scrolling horizontally, then going back would not display the
document correctly.
<br>- Opening a new window could load the document again.
<br>- Reload of a redirected page when the redirection changed (like random
Yahoo) didn't display the new page.
<br>- With image loading set to "maps only", other images already in memory
weren't displayed.
<br>- Submitting a form from an unloaded image "button" didn't always work.
<br>- ... and a few more minor items.

<p><b> o Added support for image scaling for nontransparent images when using the
internal (datatype based) decoder.
<br> o Added support for all Windows characters in the range 128-159.
<br> o Added support for RAmiga-C in text form fields (copy contents to
clipboard)</b>.

<p>MSRP remains unchanged at $45.00US / $60.00CAN plus $5.00 shipping on
direct orders.  For Canadian orders only, add 7% GST to the above for a
total of $69.55CAN.

<p>Current owners of AWeb v2.x or the shareware version may upgrade to the new
version 3.0 for $20.00US / $27.00CAN, plus $5.00 shipping.  For Canadian
orders only, add 7% GST to the above for a total of #34.24CAN.  Please
