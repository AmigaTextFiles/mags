<p>PC-Task 4.3 has now been released!  This major upgrade and demonstration
version is available from the PC-Task web site at:
<br><a href="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~pctask/">http://www.ozemail.com.au/~pctask</a>

<p>PC-Task 4.3 now has the ability to run Windows 95*.  With higher
compatibility, ability to use up to 64Mb RAM under MS-DOS, and improved
video support, this new version can run most modern-day software.

<p>* We do not recommend you try to install Windows 95 unless you have a very
  fast Amiga (68060).  While it will work, the slow speed would make it
  very painful to use.

<p>PC-Task 4.3 Specifications
<hr><br><p>

<p>With 80486 compatibility, now you are able to run that much needed
software, and with the development of Dynamic Compilation you are able to
experience major speed increases over previous versions.  PC-Task is the
fatest PC software emulation available on the Amiga, and is a necessity if
you need to run PC software.

<p>See below for a full wrap-up.
