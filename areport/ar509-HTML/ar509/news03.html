<p>To:  All Amiga fans accross the Internet.

<p>Just to let you know that the Honorable Mention web page has exceeded 500
total articles.  As you probably know Honorable Mention indexes positive
mentions of the Amiga computer in the non-Amiga specific press so you can
find out what is being said about our favorite computer.

<p>Many of my articles includes links to full text, mail to links to the
authors, and links to the news sources home page.

<p>Some new features I have added in HM include a Recent Articles page so you
can quickly link to stories dated within the last two months as well as
links to model specs, technical terms and company home pages whenever
mentioned in an article.

<p>Please stop by at <a href="http://www.rust.net/~mignash/hm.html">http://www.rust.net/~mignash/hm.html</a>
to view news coverage of the Amiga from the latest word, all the way back
to reviews of the Amiga Inc.  Joyboard and Powerstick 13 years ago, and
everything in between.
