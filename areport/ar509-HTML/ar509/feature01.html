<center><font size=+1><b>RESULTS</b></font></center>

<p>The votes are in, the sums have been done, and finally, after much blood,
sweat and broken calculators we can bring you the results of the first
Amiga Report Top 100 (hereafter known as the AR100).

<p>We had over 750 direct votes from the main web page, and another few dozen
e-mails, all voting on the author's personal favourite 10 Amiga games from
the last 12 years.  We were quiet overwhelmed by the response, and glad to
see there's still such enthusiasm and vigour in the Amiga scene.

<p>Of course, nothing went as smoothly as we'd have liked.  I (Ken) changed
jobs in mid-July, meaning for a while, half of the votes were stuck on a
server I couldn't access.  Also, the e-mail acknowledgement system
steadfastly refused to work from day one, so apologies to everyone who's
still waiting for a reply e-mail.

<p>The range of votes was staggering.  Games I've never heard of popped up in
every second vote, and there were just as many nominations for shareware or
PD games as commercial.  A couple of people got very confused and voted for
Miami, Voyager and AWeb - strange games indeed.  And a couple of wags voted
for Myst - obviously in crystal ball mode, and there were more than a
couple for Doom and Quake.

<p>More surprising were the games which DIDN'T appear.  No Bubble Bobble -
it's stuck at #141.  Wizkid made #207.  SuperCars II, #186.  And not one
single person voted for Troddlers.  I'm shocked and stunned, ladies and
gentlemen.

<p>When counting the votes, we've decided that each separate game should
count, even if they're a sequel or even just a new version.  That's why
Worms and Worms DC both feature in the AR100.  In cases where people voted
for a game without specifying a version number - for example, Megaball -
we've taken the vote are referred to the latest version.  Most votes,
however, were quite clear about which title in a series they were
nominating.  Any votes for "all of the Lemmings series" or "Monkey Island 1
and 2" had their vote distributed evenly between each title.  And don't
worry, no-one from Amiga Report voted.

<p>Finally, I'd like to thank Matt and Sean at the Data Haven Project (DHP)
for the web space and excellent service, aTmosh for adding the IRC FAQ, Nik
Shearer and Mark Wilson (tecno on IRC) for testing, Seppo Typpo for the
explanations on his vote, and finally Carter USM for the soundtrack to the
votecounting.

<p>So, in true Miss World fashion, we'll start at number 100 and work our way
to the top ...

<p><b>#100 BLOOD MONEY (Psygnosis/DMA Design) - 55 points</b>

<p>Dave Jones chucked in a job in the Timex factory in Dundee, Scotland (the
city where I work, fact fans) to found DMA Design.  The first release was
Menace, a simple shoot'em'up, and it was quickly followed by Blood Money;
another shoot'em'up, pushing the Amiga further than anyone else had at the
time.  The game now looks ridiculously simplistic with set-pattern aliens
and boring graphics.  The intro can still impress, however, and it's good
to see people taking a long-term view to Amiga games rather than only
thinking about the last two years.

<p><b>#99 MORTAL KOMBAT II (Virgin/Probe) - 55 points</b>

<p>Long after the craze for simple martial arts games had died away (leaving
IK+ as one of the greats; sadly, it's unlisted this time), the whole
beat'em'up thing flared up again, this time with combination moves, special
powers and alien players.  Mortal Kombat was converted from the arcade with
mediocre success; Kombat II manages things better and faster, with only the
lack of a hard drive installer marring things for the angry player.

<p><b>#98 DUNGEON MASTER II SKULLKEEP (FTL) - 56 points</b>

<p>Although the original Dungeon Master already had a sequel of sorts - Chaos
Strikes Back - it was really little more than a level add-on kit, and the
world waited for the true follow-up.  Six years afterward, it finally
arrived, and unfortunately little had changed.  The characterisation of the
Eye of the Beholder series or the imagination shown by Tony Crowther's
Captive and Liberation hadn't rubbed off on FTL, and we still were forced
to use an archaic control system and predictable - and frankly, boring -
level design.  The legion of Dungeon Master fans could forgive this, and
soon began reliving memories of exploring and slashing around in grubby
dungeons.


<p><b>#97 RAINBOW ISLANDS (Ocean/Grafgold) - 57 points</b>

<p><img src="97_rainbow_islands.JPG">

<p>The follow-up to the classic Bobble Bubble, Rainbow Islands is perhaps the
only game in the AR100 that can really be dubbed "arcade perfect".  The
graphics were taken directly from the coin-op original, and the gameplay
has been carefully honed to mimic the arcade parent perfectly, even down to
the infinitely complex bonus system.  The Braybrook and Turner partnership
at it's very best.

<p><b>#96 SHANGHAI (various) - 58 points</b>

<p>The ancient Chinese game of tile-picking seems popular with our readership.
No-one bothered to specify which Shanghai they were voting for; somehow,
I'd tend to favour one of the public domain versions rather than the
Activision "official" release.  If in doubt, pick your own favourite.

<p><b>#95 ANGBAND (public domain) - 59 points</b>

<p>Another Un*x port, basically NetHack with a different name.  The usual
character-based dungeons and goblins style romp.

<p><b>#94 THE KILLING CLOUD (Mirrorsoft/Vector Grafix) - 59 points</b>

<p>Three-dimensional flying fun, set in a lawless cyberpunk city.  The Killing
Cloud was one of a handful of games to attract the attentions of civil
rights group Amnesty International.  A subgame involved "interrogating" a
suspect, using various dubious methods of torture to get your information.
Amnesty appealed to Mirrorsoft's owner, the late "Capt'n Bob" Robert
Maxwell, who intervened and removed the scenes by proxy.

<p><b>#93 MECHFORCE (Shareware) - 60 points</b>

<p>BattleTech clone, in which you pit two huge lumbering piles of technology
against each other, armed only with Windows 95 and a soldering iron.

<p><b>#92 SPEEDBALL (Mirrorsoft/Bitmap Brothers) - 60 points</b>

<p>Second in line to the throne of futuristic sports sims (the crown belonging
to the sequel), Speedball has the Bitmap trademarks of groovy graphics and
superb sound coupled with the charms of football and extreme violence.
It's very much the poor brother of the sequel, but it set a standard on
it's release.

<p><b>#91 INDIANAPOLIS 500 (Electronic Arts) - 62 points</b>

<p>Before Formula One Grand Prix, Indy 500 provided the most realistic way to
race on your Amiga.  Fast(ish) filled vector graphics and plenty of ways to
tinker with your car made up for the fact you were really only roaring
around the same track for infinity.

<p><b>#90 DUNE (Virgin/Westwood Studios) - 63 points</b>

<p><img src="90_dune.JPG">

<p>Westwood, better known for the Eye of the Beholder series, took on the
challenge of converting the cult book and film into a computer game.
Inferior to the classic sequel, more on which appears below.

<p><b>#89 SWIV (Virgin/The Sales Curve) - 64 points</b>

<p>..  or SilkWorm Is Vertical, as it was dubbed at the time.  The unofficial
follow-up to the classic Silkworm (appearing below) combined great gameplay
with technical excellence.  Using a technique only seen before in an
obscure Sales Curve coin-op conversion, "St. Dragon", SWIV avoided the
traditional "please wait" messages usually encountered when accessing the
floppy by continually loading the next area of the playfield.  As a
consequence, SWIV had no real levels, just one big long
vertically-scrolling area to drive your helicopter or jeep through.  
Detailed graphics and thumping, woofer-shaking explosions help SWIV earn
its rightful place in the AR100.

<p><b>#88 ALIEN BREED (Team 17/Andreas Tadic/Rico Holmes) - 65 points</b>

<p>The game that made Team 17, and the first entry from ex-demo coder Andreas
Tadic, who brought the Amiga the once-popular sequencer Games Music
Creator.  Alien Breed was little more than a Gauntlet clone with familiar
graphics and squelchy sound effects, but it provided atmosphere and
terrific entertainment.  The storyline worked well with the format,
providing opportunity for manic dashs to lifts and exits whilst being
chased by acid-spitting baddies.  Special mention must go to Alistair
Brimble's classic soundtrack - one of the best pieces of Amiga music ever.

<p><b>#87 XENON 2 MEGABLAST (Mirrorsoft/Bitmap Bros) - 66 points</b>

<p>A huge hit at the time of it's release, partly due to the incredible hyping
it got in the flourishing 16-bit press, mainly due to the soundtrack.  The
Bitmaps obtained the rights to use the track Megablast, formally a minor
hit for Tim Simeon's acid/house group Bomb The Bass.  David Whittacker was
drafted in to convert vinyl to module, and a brilliant job he made of it. 
The game was little more than a vertically-scrolling shoot'em'up, with nice
big weapons and reasonable graphics.  It's dated terribly since then, and
the music remains the most memorable feature.

<p><b>=85 BATTLE CHESS (Electronic Arts/Interplay) - 67 points</b>

<p>Battle Chess caught the public imagination soon after it's release; the
merging of the traditional with the latest technology was an perfect
vehicle for new Amiga-owning teenagers to demonstrate the power of their
purchase to technophobic parents.  The chess engine behind the gloss isn't
a particularly strong one, and the graphics can become monotonous.
However, Battle Chess is still one of the games user's load after buying
their first hard drive, just to see if it's any better without the
horrendous delay in loading the animations from floppy.

<p><b>=85 DELUXE PACMAN (Shareware/Edgar M Vigdal) - 67 points</b>

<p>The best adaption of the arcade classic.  Featuring the cult Eighties'
hypochondriac pill-popper, Deluxe Pacman keeps the adrenaline, the ghosties
and the "wokka wokka wokka chomp" effects, and introduces the Amiga's
presentation skills in all the right places.

<p><b>#84 SILKWORM (Virgin/The Sales Curve) - 68 points</b>

<p>Near-perfect arcade conversion, with the winning combination of a jeep and
chopper blasting the baddies along a horizontally-scrolling landscape.  The
sequel, SWIV, did it the other way around with perhaps more technical
flair, but the original's simplicity places it higher up the chart.

<p><b>#83 INDIANA JONES IN THE LAST CRUSADE (LucasArts) - 70 points</b>

<p>Another point'n'click graphic adventure from the team behind the Monkey
Island series.  The graphics, involving plot and wry sense of humour kept
many people puzzling long into the night.

<p><b>#82 SKIDMARKS (Acid/Guildhall) - 71 points</b>

<p><img src="82_super_skidmarks.JPG">

<p>Popular with the Amiga magazines purely for the opportunity to crack cheap
gags, Skidmarks was a cheap'n'cheerful racing game, with lightening-fast
buggies roaring around the screen and into each other.  Skidmarks was
blighted by featuring the system stability of a one-legged man doing the
hokey-cokey; in other words, regular players could expect one guru every
half hour.

<p><b>#81 F/A-18 HORNET (Domark?) - 73 points</b>

<p>More flying fun; not overly technical, which is usually a good thing for a
flight sim, but with enough aeronautical nonsense to keep the odd
frustrated fighter pilot satisfied for a few weeks.

<p><b>#80 AMBERMOON (Thalion) - 74 points</b>

<p>Spooky role playing from the German masters of hardware bashing, Thalion. 
It's yet another dungeon romp, but with plenty of expert coding pushing the
Amiga to the limits, creating a very intense atmosphere from the poor
Amiga.

<p><b>#79 BATTLE SQUADRON (?) - 75 points</b>

<p>One of the first games really to push the power of the Amiga's fledgling
chipset.  Battle Squadron, a shoot-em-up with few frills, could easily be
mistaken for a mid-eighties arcade game.

<p><b>#78 BLACK CRYPT (Electronic Arts) - 76 points</b>

<p>A game which placed much of it's appeal in the fact you required a 1Mb
Amiga to play it; at the time, meg Amiga's were the preserve of the rich
socialite, rather than the poor common A500 owner.  Still a reasonable
D'n'D romp.

<p><b>#77 THEME PARK (Electronic Arts/Bullfrog) - 77 points</b>

<p><img src="77_theme_park.JPG">

<p>Bullfrog's last game for the Amiga (or is it?), they took on Maxis (of Sim
City/Earth/Ant fame) and almost beat them at their own game.  Little people
wandering around, paying money to go on your rides, eating your hamburgers
from your stalls and eventually throwing up on your nice clean grass is
cute fun.

<p><b>#76 KICK OFF 2 (Anco/Dino Dini) - 79 points</b>

<p>Kick Off dominated the Amiga world for a few weeks; Kick Off 2 followed on
and brought things to a standstill for months.  There was a kind of
hysteria about the game; Future Publishing (publishers of Amiga Format) had
a severe problem with the staff spending all day playing the game and not
writing magazines.  Nowadays, it appears dated, with a lack of control in
the gameplay meaning it's more like pinball than football.

<p><b>#75 POWERMONGER (Electronic Arts/Bullfrog) - 80 points</b>

<p>Bullfrog established themselves with Populous, but they went one step
beyond with PowerMonger.  Taking a slightly different approach to the
God-sim genre, PowerMonger presents itself in a pleasing rotatable
three-dimensional landscape, and is more strategic and long-term in it's
gameplay than Populous.  For extra entertainment value, leave one of the
farmers alone on a hillside with a sheep for ten minutes, and watch closely
...

<p><b>#74 GOAL (Dino Dini) - 82 points</b>

<p>Until the release of Sensible Soccer, Dino Dini's Kick Off games held the
Football Simulation cup.  However, after Sensible shook things up, Dino
fell out with his old software house, Anco, and disappeared for a year or
so, only to re-emerge with Goal, his last attempt at regaining the
premiership title.  However, it may be that there was just too much ground
to make up, and Sensible kept the momentum and the pressure building.
However, Goal is the best of the Kick Off series (Kick Off 3 wasn't a Dini
creation), and is still good for the odd un-Sensible kick about.

<p><b>#73 THE GREAT GIANA SISTERS (Rainbow Arts) - 84 points</b>

<p>An early Amiga title, first released when the Nintendo NES/Famicom was
still going strong and everyone wanted to play Super Mario Brothers.  Giana
Sisters has all the elements of the famous Mario series: horizontally
scrolling levels, bricks to headbut and secret passages to explore. 
Nintendo got a bit twitchy about the similarities, and eventually managed
to remove the game from sale.  The Amiga version had escaped, however, and
soon found its way onto a thousand pirate single-file collections.  I'd be
willing to bet most of the people who still have a copy of Giana Sisters
are faced with a bouncing "Red Sector" logo every time they load it up...

<p><b>#72 MEGABALL (Shareware/Intangible Assets Marketing) - 85 points</b>

<p>A breakout clone which started it's life as a shareware title, before
gaining sufficient popularity to go commercial, being sold by the US dealer
Intangible Assets.  Megaball takes the traditional breakout/Arcanoid route
of bats'n'balls with knobs on, rather than the refreshing approach of
Poing.

<p><b>=69 THE BARD'S TALE (Electronic Arts) - 86 points</b>

<p>Old-fashioned role playing, dating back originally to the Commodore 64 and
character-based displays.  Still a favourite of those looking for authentic
nostalgic goblin-bashing.

<p><b>=69 SUPER SKIDMARKS (Acid/Guildhall) - 86 points</b>

<p>A revamped outing for the multi-player racer, with more fault tolerance for
less off-screen crashes.  Also includes the unforgettable cows on wheels.

<p><b>=69 TV SPORTS: FOOTBALL (CinemaWare) - 86 points</b>

<p>Slightly wobbly American football sim by the (by then) reformed adventurers
CinemaWare.

<p><b>#68 NETHACK (Public Domain) - 87 points</b>

<p>A Dungeons'n'Dragons game, steeped in almost as much legend and mystery as
the genre it portrays.  Nethack developed and grew with the underground
hacker culture, mainly in UNIX-ridden West Coast America.  The hacker's
bible, "The New Hacker's Dictionary" (aka Jargon) described Nethack as "a
dungeon game similar to rogue but more elaborate, distributed in C source
over Usenet and very popular at Unix sites and on PC-class machines.  
Nethack is probably the most widely distributed of the freeware dungeon
games)".

<p><b>#67 PROJECT X (Team 17/Andreas Tadic/Rico Holmes) - 88 points</b>

<p>Another classic from the winning Tadic/Holmes combination.  Team 17, in
their first few years of business, approached every classic genre of arcade
game and tried to deliver the best yet, with varying results.  Project X
put forward impressive graphics, the usual excellent Alistair Brimble
soundtrack and a fair wallop of speed, throwing graphics onto the screen at
a rate of knots.  It was just a bit on the difficult side, and the whole
game showed no real innovation, unlike the excellent Apidya - sadly,
unrated in this AR100.

<p><b>#66 F-18 INTERCEPTOR (Electronic Arts/Bob Dinnerman) - 89 points</b>

<p>Popular in part because it was bundled with the best-selling "Batman" Amiga
500 pack and others worldwide, but mostly because it is perhaps the most
approachable of any flight simulator.  It doesn't waste time by confusing
the player with unnecessary jargon or controls; neither does it sacrifice
detail for playability.  It entranced a whole clutch of people who would
normally steer well clear of any flight sim, and is still played by many
today.

<p><b>#65 CHAMPIONSHIP MANAGER (Domark) - 92 points</b>

<p>Ever since Kevin Tom's sat down at his ZX81 and gave the world "Football
Manager", the European computer gamer has been fascinated with soccer
management simulations.  Night after night many an adolescant sat staring
at screenfuls of figures and performance statistics, determined they could
do on better on screen what the men in sheepskin jackets couldn't do in
real life.  Years later, the world was blessed with high resolution, high
colour graphics with which to display the screenfuls of figures and
performance statistics.  Championship Manager engrosses the faithful with
the best of them; here's looking forward to the sequel ...

<p><b>#64 GUNSHIP 2000 (Microprose) - 101 points</b>

<p>Gunship 2000 is a game which achieves the tricky task of balancing
technical accuracy with playability.  It doesn't bog the player down with
endless pages of numbers and statistics, and you can happily bounce your
helicopter off the ground without worrying about falling out.  It has lots
of scope, starting the player off on simple fly-about missions, and giving
the opportunity to retire and play general by directing others about.  The
kind of game that could keep the occasional player going for months.

<p><b>#63 TURRICAN (Rainbow Arts) - 102 points</b>

<p>Rainbow Art's first crack at the Turrican format: silky smooth sprites,
funky tunes and huge levels.  They didn't get it quite as good as the hoped
for, but righted the wrongs in Turrican 2: essentially the same game tarted
up, and it's coming up later ...

<p><b>#62 FAERY TALE ADVENTURE (Electronic Arts/Microillusions) - 103 points</b>

<p>I have to admit, I know absolutely nothing about this game.  If you're a
fan, please feel free to mail me and tell me more; this high a placing is
sure to make the AR100 next time around.

<p><b>#61 MARBLE MADNESS (Electronic Arts) - 104 points</b>

<p>One of the very first Amiga games; so old it can be persuaded to run on an
original A1000 with Kickstart 1.0 and 256K of memory.  It's actually an
arcade conversion, being the first of a whole clutch of forced-perspective
manoeuvring games.  Marble Madness was the first for the Amiga, and
inevitably the public, used to inferior 8-bit conversions, were wowed by
the arcade-realistic graphics and mouse controls.

<p><b>#60 SENSIBLE SOCCER (Virgin/Sensible Software) - 105 points</b>

<p><img src="60_sensi_soccer.JPG">

<p>When veteran software coders Sensible Software announced they were going to
have a go at beating Kick Off by writing a better soccer simulation, not
many people took notice - others had tried and failed.  Sensible actually
delivered a beautifully playable game, popular even with those who hated
football in real life.  The realistic ball control, the twee players and
the comprehensive and up-to-date team database all added to the annoyingly
addictive gameplay.  The only fault was the goalkeepers, who seemed to
swing from unbeatable to utterly hopeless.  And this was to be corrected in
Sensible World Of Soccer ...

<p><b>#59 SIMCITY 2000 (Maxis) - 110 points</b>

<p>Way ahead of it's older brother, SimCity 2000 added isometric graphics,
more buildings and took away the speed and, sadly, much of the playability
and character of the original.

<p><b>#58 LOTUS ESPRITE TURBO CHALLENGE (Gremlin Graphics/Magnetic Fields) -
112 points</b>

<p>The sequel appears later, but the original Lotus makes a entry at #56. 
Magnetic Fields - former by ex-Gremlin coder Shaun Southern - made their
name with car games such as the Lotus and SuperCars series, before striving
to be different with the quirky platformer Kid Chaos.  On it's release,
Lotus took sprite-based racing games further than ever before, with
extremely smooth and playably fast action.

<p><b>#57 IT CAME FROM THE DESERT (CinemaWare) - 114 points</b>

<p>CinemaWare's graphical ability and the tackiness of a sixties B movie were
made for each other.  Placed as a stereotypical hero in a stereotypical
town facing invasion by huge styrofoam ants, there's lots of
tongue-in-cheek entertainment packed into It Came ...  it even prompted a
rare sequel, AntHeads, which was more of the same.

<p><b>#56 TV SPORTS BASKETBALL (CinemaWare) - 115 points</b>

<p>Gorgeous still graphics and simple gameplay brought CinemaWare fame, but
not enough sales to keep them in the market. They reinvented themselves
with new programmers and a company shake-up, and started out in the arcade
game with the TV Sports series. The most playable of the lot is Basketball,
but then basketball sims aren't exactly thick on the ground, probably due
to the fact not a lot really happens in basketball, full stop.
<br><i>[While not a big basketball fan myself, I just thought I'd say on behalf of
everyone who might be that saying that not a lot happens in basketball is,
well, arguable.  Ken probably hasn't played NBA Jam.  -Jason]</i>

<p><b>#55 INDIANA JONES IN THE FATE OF ATLANTIS (LucasArts) - 117 points</b>

<p>Yet Another LucasArts Adventure, with the same quality of graphics,
gameplay and gags as it's stablemates.

<p><b>#54 POPULOUS II (Electronic Arts/Bullfrog) - 125 points</b>

<p>The sequel to the ground-breaking classic, Populous II tidied up some of
the loose ends and introduced a few new tricks to keep the would-be God at
the computer.

<p><b>#53 SUPER STARDUST (Acid/Bloodhouse) - 134 points</b>

<p>Asteroids brought kicking and screaming in the nineties.  On the surface,
Stardust's ray-traced boulders bear little resemblance to the jaggy,
monochrome vector graphics of the Atari seventies arcade.  However, the
same shoot-or-avoid gameplay remains intact, with the addition of a
stunning tunnel sequence between levels.  Not the deepest or the most
addictive of games, but a fine addition to the one hundred.

<p><b>#52 EMPIRE (Interstel) - 135 points</b>

<p>A bare nuts'n'bolts war game that delivers exactly what many players want -
a nuts'n'bolts war game.  No fancy graphics, extraneous options or unwanted
clutter, Empire delivered a strong opponent for the war fan.  Empire was
also popular with the pirate mail-traders, thanks to the play-by-mail
option, where a file was saved to floppy and loaded on the other players
machine.

<p><b>#51 EYE OF THE BEHOLDER (SSI/Westwood Studios) - 136 points</b>

<p>The game that took on Dungeon Master and won.  EOTB took DM's gameplay and
folklore, added to the atmosphere, and gave it a small but vitally
important extra - a plotline.  This brought the characterisations alive,
and gave the genre a new, dynamic edge.  It still had the same dragons and
spellcasting approach that people still love, but the added American gloss
provided by SSI meant that DM's days as the top Role Playing Game were
over.

<p><b>#50 PIRATES (Microprose/Sid Mier) - 137 points</b>

<p>Swashbuckling fun courtesy of the king of sims.  Nowhere nearly as
sophisticated as Sid's later titles, but plenty of fun for the seafairing
players, charging around the oceans, being generally unpleasant to as many
people as possible.

<p><b>#49 DEFENDER OF THE CROWN (CinemaWare) - 141 points</b>

<p>The screenshots echo'd around every fledgling 16-bit magazine for months;
the graphics were beautiful, as was to be expected from CinemaWare.  The
gameplay wasn't quite as complete, however; great fun for a few rounds, but
not a game to keep the player enthalled for months, especially combined
with the horrendous floppy disk access; hard drives were still the preserve
of the rich in the mid-80's.

<p><b>#48 LEMMINGS II (Psygnosis/DMA Design) - 142 points</b>

<p><img src="48_lemmings_ii.JPG">

<p>Following up Lemmings was always going to be a difficult task.  Tinkering
with the simple game mechanics could spoil the appear; so DMA decided to
keep the basics and build on it.  Larger levels and various new lemmings
were the main changes.  For some, it was enough, for others, the extra
additions and lack of two player mode spoiled the broth.

<p><b>#47 POPULOUS (Electronic Arts/Bullfrog) - 144 points</b>

<p>One of the many games in the AR100 that can claim to have created a whole
new type of game.  Populous casts you as an semi-omnipotent God, who can
shape and control a world in which your followers must prosper, grow and
ultimately beat up the baddies.

<p><b>#46 HIRED GUNS (Psygnosis/DMA Design) - 146 points</b>

<p><img src="46_hired_guns.JPG">

<p>The only notable post-Lemmings release from Scottish coders DMA, Hired Guns
took the first-person isometric game style away from the castles and crypts
of Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder, and into a futuristic
environment (a la Captive, which I'm surprised to say didn't make the
AR100).  Hired Guns also broke ground by allowing four players to take part
at once, one player to control all 4, or a combination of both.  Gorgeous
hi-res graphics and atmospheric sound create a wonderful atmosphere; fans
of Hired Guns tend to be almost religious in their praise for it.

<p><b>#45 GODS (Renegade/Bitmap Bros) - 149 points</b>

<p>Mythology, puzzles for the lateral thinker and platforms made Gods a
surprise hit at the time of it's release, but the brilliant graphics and
curiously intelligent enemies hooked many a gamesplayer for weeks.  The
Bitmaps took the Gods engine, changed the graphics and released Magic
Pockets six months later, but it couldn't match it's predecessor for sheer
class.

<p><b>#44 CHAOS ENGINE (Renegade/Bitmap Brothers) - 152 points</b>

<p><img src="44_chaos_engine.JPG">

<p>The Bitmap's had long been working towards creating a more intelligent
opponent in their games.  Two-player games are fun, but there are always
occasions where the player is alone, and computer opponents or assistants
were usually wooden and predicable.  The Bitmap's finally cracked it with
the Chaos Engine, a top-down maze game, slightly reminiscent of Gauntlet,
but with the puzzle element of Gods, and the usual pixel-perfect graphics.
The Heath Robinson-esque backgrounds combined with the brilliant level
design made a game which many people spent far too much time playing to the
bitter end.

<p><b>#43 PINBALL ILLUSIONS (21st Century Software/Digital Illusions) - 154 points</b>

<p><img src="43_pinball_illusions.JPG">

<p>The final instalment of the Pinball saga from Digital Illusions; the men
who left the demo/pirate scene to bring the world's first decent computer
pinball simulation added multiball and a high resolution mode to the
proceedings.  This time, however, there were only three tables in the set
to play, and as usual one of them was a duffer.  The other two were up to
the usual high standard, but one can't help feeling DI had lost the
momentum by this point, and it took Liquid Dezign's Slam Tilt to show how
things really could be done.  However, there is no beating the "Babewatch"
table and it's superb Beach Boys-style music ...

<p><b>#42 SUPERFROG (Team 17/Andreas Tadic/Rico Holmes)  - 155 points</b>

<p>Coded by Team 17's founders, Andreas Tadic and Marco Holmes, Superfrog was
one of T17's finest hours, and certainly one of the Amiga's best
platformers.  Yes, it was cliched and stole ideas wholesale from other
games (Sonic and Mario being the main influence), but Superfrog carried it
off with a superb feel, a gentle difficulty curve and a touch of humour.

<p><b>#41 LOTUS ESPRITE TURBO CHALLENGE II (Gremlin Graphics/Magnetic Fields) -
156 points</b>

<p><img src="41_lotus_2_turbo.JPG">

<p>The pinnacle of sprite-based racing simulation, Turbo Challenge 2 improved
on the technical excellence of it's little brother and delivers a stunning
ride.  The speed and smoothness of the corners and hills still impress
people today, even in the age of texture-mapped Ridge Racers.  Not quite as
groundbreaking as the predecessor, with the lap-based format being dropped
in favour of a multi-stage course, but a classic game earning a respectable
placing.

<p><b>#40 WING COMMANDER (Origin) - 157 points</b>

<p>The Wing Commander series is legendary in PC circles for it's involving
plot, superb filmed sequences, intriguing character-based sections and
complete lack of gameplay.  Luckily, the latter curse only effected the
sequels, and the original is a fine space shoot'em'up, using gourad-shaded
graphics and dramatic orchestral music to get the pulse roaring.  Not so
much fun on a plain A500, but anything a bit more powerful should have no
trouble.

<p><b>#39 SIMON THE SORCERER (?) - 162 points</b>

<p>A graphic adventure of the usual making; perhaps with slightly inferior
graphics to LucasArt's Monkey Island and Indy games, but making up for it
in puzzles and plotline, with the obligatory daft sense of humour.

<p><b>#38 GLOOM (Acid/Guildhall) - 163 points</b>

<p>The first real Doom-clone to hit the Amiga; it's actually more a
Wolfenstein clone, having a strictly two-dimensional map rather than the
floors and ramps of Doom and Alien Breed 3D.  Still, it's a hugely
enjoyable blast'em'up romp, and everyone should be looking forward to the
forthcoming Gloom 3; hopefully we'll see it in the next AR100.

<p><b>#37 PINBALL DREAMS (21st Century Software/Digital Illusions) - 166 points</b>

<p>The game that proved pinball could be transferred to home computer. 
Nintendo and Sega had laughable attempts at bringing the silver ball to
their consoles; Atari even tried an arcade game - TimeScanners - with a
computer conversion by Activision (under their Electric Dreams label), but
no-one managed the fluid ball movement, the realistic flippers and bumpers
and the flashing lights in a way which convinced.  Then Digital Illusions,
having cut their coding teeth as Scoopex on the pirate/demo scene
(responsible for many games in this chart), came from nowhere with Pinball
Dreams; 4 simulated tables of pinball bliss, with secret bonuses, great
music and compulsive gameplay so addictive people had to be physically
removed from the shift keys.  Dreams led to a few sequels, but more
importantly it proved pinball could be done on the small screen.

<p><b>#36 ANOTHER WORLD / OUT OF THIS WORLD (Delphine Software) - 171 points</b>

<p><img src="36_another_world.JPG">

<p>The predecessor to Flashback, Another World has rather more primitive
graphics but with the same quality of animation and detail.  By using
filled vectors rather than sprites, the designers were free to zoom in and
out of the action as the game required.  Delphine's adventure background is
evident in Another World, but despite this Another World suffers from being
just a bit easy to complete.

<p><b>#35 EYE OF THE BEHOLDER II (SSI/Westwood Studios)  - 176 points</b>

<p>Using much the same game engine as it's prequel, Beholder II is superior
due to better level design, more non-player characters and acres of
dungeons and crypts to wander through.  Extremely involving, and the sense
of accomplishment on completing the game is enough to provoke you to start
all over again.

<p><b>#34 ALIEN BREED 3D - (Team 17/Andy Clithero/Ocean) - 177 points</b>

<p>The Amiga public almost demanded that their favourite Alien romp follow the
trend and have a go at being a Doom clone.  The result was a brilliant
game, using a blocky but fast engine, wonderful squelchy sound effects and
intelligent aliens.  Unlike the sequel, the difficulty curve was just about
perfect, and the plotline makes sense.  The best feature is the level
design; clear, sensible and with plenty of opportunity for exploration.

<p><b>#33 BREATHLESS (Power Computing/Field of Dreams) - 179 points</b>

<p>Yet Another Doom; probably comes off second best technically with The
Killing Grounds, but still a fine romp for the beefier Amiga.

<p><b>#32 CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AGA (ClickBoom) - 185 points</b>

<p>Modern-day beat'em'up; the genre has been slowly dying since the heady days
of Ye Ar Kung Fu and The Way of the Exploding Fist.  The pinnacle of Amiga
beat'em'ups was probably IK+, which despite the simple gameplay and fact it
shipped on a single disk, provided just the right "feel" for the player; as
the old Chinese saying goes, "a game that feels right is a game that is
played often".  After Street Fighter II, a beat'em'up HAD to include
strange alien characters (complete with unpronounceable names),
extra-sensory/kinetic powers, and enough pixels flying around the screen as
to confuse ten players at once, never mind the standard two.  Capital
Punishment is the Amiga's answer to all of this; forgoing the constraints
of emulating an arcade game, and concentrating on using the Amiga's
hardware to the maximum and delivering a fine, playable bout of non-serious
violence.

<p><b>#31 ELITE (Firebird/David Braben/Iain Bell/Mr Micro) - 186 points</b>

<p>It's hard to imagine anyone doesn't know of Elite by now; suffice to say
it's probably the ultimate space combat and trading simulation.  First
released for the BBC Micro (all 32K of it), it's been ported to every
format imaginable, including a fairly respectable Amiga conversion
(complete with the "Blue Danube" docking theme).  Sadly, the Braben and
Bell partnership disintegrated soon after Elite was written; it is Iain
Bell we have to thank for Elite's gameplay - Braben was all for making
Elite far more like the sequel, "Frontier", an ambitious project for a 32K
machine.

<p><b>#30 SHADOW OF THE BEAST (Psygnosis/Reflections) - 202 points</b>

<p>Probably sold more Amiga's than all of Commodore's advertising, ever.
After all this time, Beast still looks drop dead gorgeous, with countless
layers of paralax scrolling, smooth animation and photographic stills.
There's very little game behind all this gloss, of course, but who wants to
play when you can just drool?

<p><b>#29 RAILROAD TYCOON (Microprose/Sid Mier) - 206 points</b>

<p><img src="29_railroad_tycoon.JPG">

<p>An early attempt by Sid at corporate simulation, and is really the
predecessor to the more Maxis-influenced A-Train.  Still, the old school
style appeals to many, and like all of Meier's games it's curiously
compulsive.

<p><b>#28 XTREME RACING (Acid/Guildhall) - 216 points</b>

<p>One of only two attempts at recreating "Mario Kart" on the Amiga.  XR is
technically very clever, but the level designs are a bit naff; however,
there are plenty of replacement tracks available in the PD, and
multi-player racing is a guaranteed laugh.

<p><b>#27 CANNON FODDER (Virgin/Sensible Software) - 221 points</b>

<p><img src="27_cannon_fodder.JPG">

<p>Richard Joseph's music kicks in - "War has never been so much fun", the
vocals sing, and you feel good.  And then you're into a sombre, beautiful
soundtrack accompanying a field full of gravestones and recruits - the
cannon fodder - lining up at the gate, and you begin to realise what a
waste of time war really is.  A true game of conflicting interests, Cannon
Fodder is perfect in just about every respect; the controls allow the
player to activate a whole range of manoeuvres without moving their hand
from the mouse, the difficulty level is pitched steeply but not unfairly
so, and there's the odd macabre humour which never really goes so far as to
offend.

<p><b>#26 TURRICAN II (Rainbow Arts) - 222 points</b>

<p>Hardware banging at it's best.  Super smooth platform action, Turrican II
isn't massively different from it's predecessor; it's almost as if the
author's went back to Turrican and decided to polish it up a bit.  Lovely
half-chip, half-sample music and the same gameplay polished up and buffed,
Turrican II can still impress; indeed, it has become the de facto game with
which to test Amiga emulators on other platforms.

<p><b>#25 SPEEDBALL II - BRUTAL DELUXE (Mirrorsoft/Bitmap Brothers) - 228 points</b>

<p><img src="25_speedball_ii.JPG">

<p>The highest placed of the five Bitmap Bros games in the AR100.  Based on
the same "sport" as the prequel, it's slicker, better, faster and more of
the same; build up a technologically-enhanced team of brutes, barge each
other around the pitch and score goals whilst beating each other up.  Great
soundtrack with the classic "ice cream!" sample between goals.

<p><b>#24 FLASHBACK (Delphine Software) - 233 points</b>

<p><img src="24_flashback.JPG">

<p>The sequel to Another World; combining the two-dimensional filled vector
graphics of the original and beautiful rotoscoped characters, giving a
realism of movement in the animation of the main character not seen since
Broderbund's Prince of Persia.  It's a large game, too, with an intriguing
plotline and fine attention to detail.  The fluidity of the graphics make
it a great game to watch as well as play.

<p><b>#23 PINBALL FANTASIES (21st Century Entertainment/Digital Illusions)
- 236 points</b>

<p><img src="23_pinball_fantasies.JPG">

<p>The second, and in the eyes of the AR100 the best, of Digital Illusion's
famed Pinball series.  Not much was added technically, but the design
carried through the same quality of tables which made Pinball Dreams such a
success.  The "Party Land" table remains probably the finest computer
pinball table ever.

<p><b>#22 FORMULA 1 GRAND PRIX (Microprose/Geoff Crammond/Pete Cooke) - 237
points</b>

<p><img src="22_f1gp.JPG">

<p>The legendary Geoff Crammond built on the success of his classic BBC Micro
game Revs and presented us with Formula 1 Grand Prix.  The vector graphics
may look a little primitive today, with the evolution of texture mapping
and shading, but the engine is still one of the most realistic around, and
a whole legion of racers still compete for the best lap times.

<p><b>#21 SIM CITY (Maxis) - 240 points</b>

<p><img src="21_simcity.JPG">

<p>The first, and most would say best, of the Sim games.  Curiously, Sim City
is available in two Amiga versions: the European version and the far
superior US version.  I've no idea which one everyone was voting for, but
it's irrelevant, as Sim City was a trend-setting game, converting action
game fans to the more sedate world of strategy games.  You just can't help
joining up those little roads to make a bypass, and then adding another
department store, and then making another little road, and ...

<p><b>#20 STUNT CAR RACER (Microprose/Geoff Crammond) - 259 points</b>

<p><img src="20_stunt_car_racer.JPG">

<p>Another vintage title, Stunt Car is a combination of simulation and
fantasy.  Racing an almost-indestructible car along roller coaster tracks
is improbable but excellent fun, especially in two-player serial link mode.
Unfortunately, the twelve tracks aren't enough after almost a decade, and
the often promised follow-up hasn't made it to our screens ...  yet.  In
the meantime, however, for the best results we would recommend as big a
viewing screen as possible.  Playing on a 21" monitor, expect to experience
vertigo and that sinking feeling in your belly ...

<p><b>#19 DELUXE GALAGA (Shareware/Edgar M Vigdal) - 288 points</b>

<p>The most popular shareware game in the AR100, Deluxe Galaga is a revamped
version of the old 80's coin-op, Galaga.  It's Space Invaders with knobs
on, but those knobs fairly spice things up.  Money to be spent in shops,
memory games, asteroid belts, and more aliens that is entirely sensible,
Deluxe Galaga have been tweaked across several versions to provide just the
right feel to the controls and enemies.  It's a shame development seems to
have stopped now, and I hope the author, Edgar M.  Vidal, is inspired by
your votes and starts the next version as soon as you've all paid your
shareware fees.

<p><b>#18 COLONIZATION (Microprose/Sid Mier) - 290 points</b>

<p>The long-awaited follow-up to the hugely successful Civilization.  The
gameplay was loosely similar to Civ, taking the exploring and developing
concept a little closer in, but still keeping the engrossing gameplay.  The
Amiga version was a particular delight, as it broke the mould of PC ports
by taking advantage of the Amiga's multitasking and comprehensive GUI
facilities.

<p><b>#17 SYNDICATE (Electronic Arts/Bullfrog) - 306 points</b>

<p><img src="17_syndicate.JPG">

<p>Bullfrog finally shook off the ghost of Populous and delivered Syndicate, a
storming blend of shoot'em'up, strategy and corporate capitalism.  The
player aims to achieve world domination by corrupting, kidnapping,
assassinating and usurping, which of course makes it jolly good fun,
especially with the sound turned up.

<p><b>#16 UFO - ENEMY UNKNOWN (Microprose/Julian Gollop) - 311 points</b>

<p>Julian Gollop is a legendary name in certain RPG circles; he wrote many
classic 8-bit games, still played by many nostalgia freaks on the multitude
of emulators.  Bringing his talent to the Amiga, UFO is a huge exploratory
romp, seeking out the alien intruder without being squashed - all in a
strategic way, based on thought rather than reactions.  Long-term
entertainment for the more cerebal player.

<p><b>#15 SENSIBLE WORLD OF SOCCER (Renegade/Sensible Software) - 327 points</b>

<p><img src="15_SWOS.JPG">

<p>Sensible's world class Soccer game, backed up by an unusually complex
management and fronted by an easy-to-use interface.  The goalkeepers even
behave properly in the soccer game to end all soccer games; thanks to
regular team updates and the multitude of ways to play, SWOS remains the
best soccer game on any platform, ever.

<p><b>#14 SLAM TILT (21st Century Entertainment/Liquid Dezign) - 334 points</b>

<p>Truly a case of the young pretender usurping the throne.  Liquid Dezign
entered the pinball games area from nowhere and immediately resigned
Digital Illusion's series of games to the second division.  Slam Tilt had
all the standard features - multiball, tilts, themed tables - but added
enjoyable fun sub-games, and for once every table was worth playing.  We
called it "Smooth, fast, playable" and "extremely addictive", and at number
twelve, we're glad you agree.

<p><b>#13 WINGS (CinemaWare) - 336 points</b>

<p>CinemaWare's finest hour, according to our voters.  The usual quality of
graphics and characterisation, with even more character and depth of
gameplay than would normally be expected of the author's graphic
adventures.

<p><b>#12 ALIEN BREED 3D 2 - THE KILLING GROUNDS (Team 17/Andy Clithero) - 338
points</b>

<p>The culmination of the legendary Alien Breed series, The Killing Grounds
throws everything it can at the Amiga hardware.  With a powerful enough
machine, TKG provides the ultimate "Doom" engine, with superlative lighting
effects and super-intelligent opponents.  On a less porky box, it crawls
slightly; furthermore, the difficulty curve, so well pitched in the
prequel, climbs like a rocket and makes things very tricky, even in the
early levels.  This said, TKG is the best way to convince PC owners that
the Amiga can still cut it when it comes to first-person perspective games.

<p><b>#11 THE SENTINEL (Rainbird/Geoff Cramond) - 343 points</b>

<p>A real surprise.  Over ten years after it's release, The Sentinel appears
as Geoff Cramond's top game.  The Sentinel is almost totally unique - set
on a mountainous chequered 3D landscape, the player must teleport their way
up to the highest position and absorb the ever-watching "sentinel".
However, get in it's line-of-site and it'll absorb you.  Basic graphics
enhance rather than detract from the atmosphere, and there's a curiously
eerie air as you hunt for the hunter.

<p><b>#10 FRONTIER - ELITE 2 (Gametek/David Braben) - 371 points</b>

<p>The world waited for the follow-up to Elite, and waited, and waited, until
finally Frontier appears, and many were more than a little disappointed. 
The game map had been expanded beyond belief, making it very easy to get
lost, and the dogfighting, so beloved of the original, was made so easy as
to make it irrelevant.  Die-hard fans immersed themselves in the game, and
reaped the rewards; the legends of wormholes and secret ships soon popped
up and continue to do the rounds on Usenet.  Truly a game that gives back
what you put into it.

<p><b>#9 SETTLERS (Blue Byte) - 374 points</b>

<p><img src="09_the_settlers.JPG">

<p>Unlike other "God-sims", The Settlers is a much gentler game.  There's none
of the fire and mythology of Populous, or the cut'n'dried world of SimCity.
The Settlers is almost rural in it's approach, very laid back and therefore
quiet relaxing to play.  The calm way in which your worker saunter around
the playscreen, chopping trees, fishing in the rivers or feeding the pigs
(with the absolutely delightful oinks eminating from the speakers), it's an
undemanding but treacherously addictive game.

<p><b>#8 DUNGEON MASTER (Mirrorsoft/FTL) - 419 points</b>

<p>Probably responsible for the sale of more Amiga peripheral hardware than
any other game.  Dungeon Master was originally released on the Atari ST to
critical acclaim.  The port to the Amiga should have been a simple one;
however, once Intuition and the background system had grabbed it's chunk of
the memory, the game itself wouldn't fit into the standard half meg of
memory the vast majority of the A500-owning market possessed.  Sales of
half meg trapdoor expansions rocketed.  Nowadays, Dungeon Master looks
dated compared with Eye Of The Beholder or the clutch of first-person
perspective games, but it started the market and still can grab the
attention of the role-playing fanatic.

<p><b>#7 WORMS (Team 17/Andrew Davidson/Ocean)  - 439 points</b>

<p>It's less than 2 years since Worms was released, yet it's firmly entrenched
in the Amiga's history as a gaming great.  Critics say it's just an
artillery clone, but what a clone - silky-smooth presentation, polished
beyond belief, with dozens of unorthodox weapons and an extremely silly
sense of humour.  What makes it more remarkable is that it was written by
just one guy (the infamous Andy Davidson), using a single Amiga and a copy
of Blitz Basic, and from there it's gone on to be a best-seller on every
format from PC to PlayStation.

<p><b>#6 THE SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND 2 - LECHUCK'S REVENGE (LucasArts) -
445 points</b>

<p>Just as much fun as the original, and with even more disks.  In the days
before adventures came on CD-ROMs with voice-overs and huge animated
sequences, Monkey Island 2 managed to cram a whole film, complete with
sub-plots, witty dialogue and believable characters onto thirteen (count
'em) disks.  The same quality as it's prequel, just more of it.

<p><b>#5 WORMS - THE DIRECTOR'S CUT (Team 17/Andy Davidson/Ocean) - 465 points</b>

<p>Little surprise the both "Worms" games make it to the top ten of the AR100.
The Director's Cut adds a few extra weapons to the original game, along
with more options to design levels and customize the game.  Underneath it
all, however, it's just Worms, and only the most fanatical fan will own
both.  On the other hand, every Amiga owner should own at least one, and
Worms DC is the logical choice.

<p><b>#4 THE SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND (LucasArts) - 492 points</b>

<p><img src="04_monkey_island.JPG">

<p>The humour, the graphics, the plot, the scale, what can you say about
Monkey Island that hasn't been said before?  It is _the_ classic graphic
adventure, carving a place in adventuring history as much as The Hobbit did
in 1984.

<p><b>#3 DUNE II (Virgin/Westwood Studios) - 550 points</b>

<p><img src="03_dune_ii.JPG">

<p>After the impressive but little-bought prequel, it was a bit surprising
Westwood decided to follow on.  However, Dune II set the foundations for
the hit PC game Command & Conquer, several clones of which are making their
way to the Amiga this year.  Dune II has the quality Westwood coding, the
gameplay of Sim City and the ambition of Civilization, and hopefully the
C&C clones will carry through the good qualities set by this classic game.

<p><b>#2 LEMMINGS (Pysgnosis/DMA Design) - 562 points</b>

<p>Probably the best known Amiga game ever.  Lemmings was released at the very
peak of the Amiga's popularity, and even though it hence appeared on every
format thinkable, it's still thought of as very much an Amiga title.  On
the face of it, guiding tiny stick figures from A to B doesn't sound much
fun, but Lemmings was a game where losing was almost as much fun as winning
- with the "bler!" as they smack into the concrete after a long fall, the
"oh no!" as they detonate, and the unrivalled pleasure of nuking a whole
gaggle of lemms and watching them pop into tiny tiny pieces ...  couple
this with the much-underrated (and unique to the Amiga, it would seem)
two-player mode, and it's a real pleasure to see Lemmings achieve such a
high place in the AR100.

<p><b>#1 CIVILIZATION (Microprose/Sid Mier) - 873 points</b>

<p><img src="01_civilization.JPG">

<p>This is it - the game that you've decided is the best Amiga game ever, and
I must say it caught me by surprise.  Sid Meier's conquest game is
intriguing and addictive; challenging the player to evolve with their
charge through the ages, from primitive man to present day and beyond.
Hugely absorbing, the game sucks in the player and has been responsible for
many late nights and bleary eyes.  The recent re-issue on CD should ensure
Civ stays at the top of the AR100 for a while yet.

<br><p>
<table width=100% border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0><tr><td bgcolor=000000></td></tr></table><br>

<p>So there we have it.  By my calculations, the Bitmap Brothers come level
with CinemaWare as the top coders, and Team 17 have seven games in the
AR100, making them the premier publisher.  Sad that all of these talented
people have deserted the Amiga ...

<p>That's it over with for now.  The AR100 will be back early next year, so
keep watching for details of how to vote again.  If you've spotted any
mistakes or errors in the chart above, please let me know so that we can
get it right next time.  Thanks once again for making the AR100 a success,
and we'll do it all again in six months ...
