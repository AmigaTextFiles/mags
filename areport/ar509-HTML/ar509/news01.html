<p>THE FINAL ODYSSEY - This masterpiece of a game will be released at the end
of November.  Best described as an Action/Adventure/Puzzler, the Final
Odyssey combines detailed and entertaining graphics and gameplay to
perfection.  You play the part of Theseus on his quest to free six rather
lovely maidens from the evil clutches of the Minotaur.  The Final Odyssey
is so vast that we have been unable to reach the end (somewhat disturbing
as we're supposed to be testing it) but then rather unsurprising as some of
the levels reconstruct themselves everytime you play......

<p>Peter Spinaze is Vulcan's multi talented developer of this fine game.  The
beautifully crafted graphics in The Final Odyssey have won Peter a
scholarship at Silicon Studio which is a state of the art international
facility dedicated to training digital artists.

<p>Silicon Studio is one of only 3 flagship training centres world-wide and is
the most advanced digital media training centre in the industry in the Asia
Pacific region to date.

<p>Peter's particular scholarship is a 3D Animation scholarship.  He is using
Alias/Wavefront PowerAnimator as his 3D Rendering software and using the
latest Silicon Graphics hardware.  The same gear they used to make Jurassic
Park etc.  The hardware consists of O2's, Octane's, and an Onyx2 Infinite
Reality supercomputer.

<p>We are all very proud of him here at Vulcan but not at all surprised.

<p>Kind Regards
