Jay Miner is the ultimate in Amiga cult icons.  While he is not necessarily
everyone's personal hero, it is generally accepted in the Amiga mythos that
more or less everything got its start with him, even if he was ultimately
burned and disgusted by Commodore and spent the rest of his life largely in
non-Amiga pursuits.  Jay did not live to see the Escom or Gateway eras in
the Amiga's history...whether we pity him or envy him for that is another
issue.

<p>In 1989, the Metroplex Commodore Computer Club (MCCC) had Jay as their
guest for their annual METCOM Amiga gathering.  At the event, Jay gave a
talk and fielded questions from Amiga users, and someone was clever enough
to tape the event for posterity.  Now that Jay Miner has passed, the MCCC
decided that perhaps people might want something to remember the man by. 

<p>The Memorial tape first replays Jay's speech, along with some of the
commercial Amiga advertising (yes, there really was some) of the time.
Jay's speech is largely very measured and consistent--he's not a rockstar
or a crowd-player, he's just recounting his story and the Amiga's story.
He then fields questions from the crowd, which range from everything from
an anachronistic discussion on the relative merits of MaxiPlan to a few
condemnations of Commodore (and another anachronistic reference to "twelve
[American] Amiga magazines"...we wish..).  Some stories you've likely heard
before, others are worth hearing for the first time.

<p>After Miner's speech, the second half of the tape is devoted to more
MCCC-specific concerns.  Their first 5 METCOMs are documented, with various
footage (most of it in 1.3 blue and white given the timeframe, but the 1990
and '91 versions bring 2.x on to the screen) being shot from all sorts of
programs.  There's a neat demo of the GVP IV24 in the 1991 footage but it
doesn't really go much beyond using the card as a framebuffer, genlock, and
flickerfixer.

<p>Obviously, the second half of the tape isn't going to be as engrossing as
the first.  The quality of the footage varies somewhat across the entire
tape--the Miner portion is well enough shot (Although a little dark) and
it's sometimes difficult to hear the questions being asked of Jay, although
his voice is clear.  It's a neat trip into the past.  There's no vitriol or
dirty jokes ala Deathbed Vigil, just one of the founding fathers of the
Amiga sounding off.  For US$15, I think it's a good buy.
