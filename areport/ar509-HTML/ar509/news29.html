<font size=+1><b>CLICKBOOM AMIGA WEB RING
<hr><br>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b></font>

<p>Toronto, Sep. 30, 1997

<p>Dear Amiga users,
<p>we would like to introduce you to a brand new concept called

<center>"CLICKBOOM AMIGA WEB RING"</center>

<p>No, it's not a new game, as a matter of fact, it has very little to do with
games.

<p>"clickBOOM Amiga web ring" is our non-profit project intended to connect
all (personal and commercial) Amiga web sites on Internet!

<p>It's a brave plan, and for it to ultimately succeed we need all Amiga web
site owners to join this magnificent way of making the Amiga web presence
stronger and more organized. 

<p>If you have an Amiga-related web site, this absolutely FREE way of
promoting is a must.  It will improve traffic on your site, while also
contributing to linking all Amiga web sites in the most efficient way.

<p>We will outline the basic principles and benefits of Amiga web ring here,
but for the complete information and application form, please visit
<a href="http://www.clickboom.com/">http://www.clickboom.com</a> .

<p>1. How does it work?
<br>2. Benefits for web surfers
<br>3. Benefits for owners of personal home pages
<br>4. Benefits for commercial web sites

<p><b>HOW DOES IT WORK?</b>
<hr><br>
<p>Imagine for a moment that every Amiga web site on its front page has a
simple control panel, similar in looks to that of a CD player.

<p>A visitor to any site in this "Amiga ring" can simply click on the "next"
button to jump to the next site in the ring.  He can then explore this new
site, and at any time use the panel from this site to go to the next one in
the ring. 

<p>Going from one site to another would allow a user to eventually visit all
Amiga web pages and after making a "full circle" he would be back to the
site where he started from. 

<p>In addition to this, the ring allows a user to go in both "directions",
skip, see the next/previous five sites, or jump to a random site in the
ring. 

<p>This might seem like a complicated thing, but once you see it on the main
page of clickboom.com or pxlcomputers.com , you will realize how simple,
yet effective it can be.

<p><b>BENEFITS FOR WEB SURFERS</b> 
<hr><br>
<p>clickBOOM Amiga ring is a dream come true for any surfer looking for Amiga
information on the web:

<p>1.  A simple uniform control panel allows for easy "flow" from one Amiga
site to another.  This will discover hidden Internet Amiga gems - and
that's what surfing the Net is about. 

<p>2.  Visit all Amiga related sites, no matter how small or large - from a
personal web site of an Amiga user in Alaska to a manufacturer or retailer
carrying Amiga products.  No more same few links, over and over on every
web site. 

<p>3.  No need to use search engines to look for Amiga sites.

<p>4.  No dead links!  As soon as any site is removed from the web, it is also
removed from the ring, and panels on all sites are instantly "informed" not
to use that site anymore. 

<p><b>BENEFITS FOR OWNERS OF PERSONAL HOME PAGES</b>
<hr><br> 
<p>1.  Adds traffic to web sites.  ANY VISITOR to ANY SITE in the clickBOOM
Amiga ring is a potential visitor to your site, as well! 

<p>2.  A site next to a high traffic one like clickBOOM will receive all the
hits from surfers who choose "next" from such a site! 

<p>3.  No programming, or maintenance necessary.  Once the HTML code is added
to the page, it automatically handles traffic from and to the web site. 

<p>4. It's absolutely, positively FREE! 

<p><b>BENEFITS FOR COMMERCIAL WEB SITES</b>
<hr><br>
<p>No matter how popular a site is, it can never have too many users visiting
it.  Amiga web ring will increase traffic on any site, guaranteed. 

<p>1.  ANY VISITOR to ANY SITE in Amiga ring is a potential visitor to your
web site! 

<p>2.  All surfers to use the ring are Amiga users looking for more
information on the web. 

<p>3.  Commercial web sites can even use an alternative panel without a
clickBOOM logo, no questions asked.  (contact us first to obtain such
panel)

<p>4.  It's FREE! 

<p>Thanks,
<br>clickBOOM
