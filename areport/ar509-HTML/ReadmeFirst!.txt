Welcome to the HTML version of Amiga Report 5.09!

Point your browser into "ar509" and load up index.html.
You'll be off and running in no time!

Just a couple of quick notes.  You may notice that there are
two directories in this archive--"ar509" and "Images".  The
Images are pictures that will be reused from issue to issue of
AR and should be kept exactly where they are.  We suggest you
create an "AR" directory (if you don't have one already) and
de-archive this and future issues of AR to it.  If you have AR508 in HTML,
you should copy this new Images directory over your old one--we made a
couple of changes.
