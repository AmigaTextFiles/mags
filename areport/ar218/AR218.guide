Another week with only rumors abound. Sorry, nothing concrete
...interesting stories, guesses, assumptions, etc. But I will stick with
what I stated before ...I really don't wish to start rumor mongering so...

On to something else. :)

Quite a few of you out there have Internet connections ..or have the
ability to send mail to someone on the Internet. So in the next issue
I will give out addresses to Magazines in which you can write letters to
the editor. The week after, I will compile a list of email addresses in
which you can contact major developers of Amiga software and hardware.
While these might not be very Amiga specific, it might show how "involved"
you can get with magazines, developers, and the infamous via email. The
interaction is quite interesting.

Until then, we have some interesting articles from Mr. Compton, 
Mr. Tiberio, and others....

...but before I go, I need to ask you a favour. 

Michael Witbrock, the owner of the Commodore Information Resource on the
World Wide Web (WWW) is in need of a paint program that (preferably) works
with the Picasso II board. He's been updating the Resource and a bit of it
involves pictures (a site to see if you have the ability to use Mosaic on
the WWW).

I ask that if any of you individuals or companies wouldn't mind donating
him a paint program, please get ahold of him at:

witbrock@cs.cmu.edu

I thank you all!! Enjoy!!!

AR Mailing List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No Official Amiga Report Distribution Site in your local calling area? Are
you tired of waiting for your local BBS or online service to get Amiga
Report each week?  If so, have we got a deal for you!

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report
in UUENCODED form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put
on the list, send Email to rniles@hebron.connected.com.  Your
account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact copy.
For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.

Many thanks to PORTAL Communications for setting this service up for us!

P.S.:  Please be sure to include your Email address in the text of your
request message, it makes adding it to the list much easier.  Thanks!

** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!

                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
World Wide Web
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AR can also be read with Mosaic (in either AmigaGuide or html form).
Reading AmigaReport with Mosaic removes the necessity to download it.
It can also be read using programs found in UNIX sites such as LYNX.

Simply tell Mosaic to open the following URL:
http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/People/mjw/Computer/Amiga/AR/MainPage.html

Mosaic for the Amiga can be found on Aminet in directory comm/net, or
(using anonymous ftp) on max.physics.sunysb.edu

Mosaic for X, Macintosh(tm) and Microsoft Windows(tm) can be found on
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu


                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Aminet
~~~~~~
To get Amiga Report from Aminet, simply FTP to any Aminet site, CD
to docs/mags. All the back issues are located there as well.
(ftp.cdrom.com or ftp.wustl.edu are two sites)

MangaZone Announces GeNe and Maestro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dear Amiga User,

As you know we are a young and aggressive software house as well as a 
distributor for several products here in Italy.

Even though the recent problems in Commodore, we still are fully dedicated 
to the Amiga line. We believe in the machine and we will be doing 
everything we can to keep it from falling down.

In fact we are now announcing a new product! After the successful release
of GeNe(TM), our stock management and invoicing program with features as 
an over 4 billion client database, product database, and many other 
exiting things, we have started working on a major product that will 
revolution the whole DTP world when it comes to music!

MAESTRO!(TM) is a fully blown Music Processor with basic DTP for 
incorporating words into music. Here you will find fome of its major
features:

-   Easy keyboard input as well as standard mouse input.
-   * .MID readout and layout with automatic percussion transposition and 
    general midi istruments patterns.
-   Template support.
-   Infinite level (Memory controlled) undo.
-   Postscript support for smooth print out.
-   Postscript support is included at the engine level. The display is 
    seen as a low resolution printer.
-   Lyrics.
-   Basic DTP with music and words for printing such products like
    musicals.
-   Top ranges for music istruments.
-   Automatic transposition for istrument with different keys.
-   Score optimization for deleting empty parts for printing a reduced 
    Director's version.
-   Instrumentally reduced score for Director's version.
-   On screen "Score Collapsing" for better section linking.
-   Automatic time calculation based on all time and tempo changes.
-   Up to 256 Staffs can be addressed.
-   And many many more exiting things!

The software will be distributed on CD-ROM, together with the Amiga and 
Windows version. The approssimative RRP should be around US$1000 for a one 
system licence. Multiple platform/site licence can be bough. Tentative 
release date will be on the first quarter 1995.

A Junior version will be available as well as a special pricing to 
students and free first copy for any educational institute who makes a 
formal request (please enquire with us for details).

User manual will be on-line as hypertext. Optional paper version will be 
delivered under request. Details are still not available on the manner 
this will be executed, but of course there will be also a funtion to 
print out the manual on a Postscript printer.

All in all, you can see we are and want to remain fully dedicated to the 
Amiga market and we will continue to develop solutions for this computer
for a long time. In fact by mid June we will be releasing a free update to
GeNe.

For further information you can call us, we'll be pleased to be of help.

The Puzzle Factory Announces WinkBug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Debugging Code was Never Easier"

WinkBug(tm) consists of a small 2-line by 16-character LCD display that
can help you to debug programs more rapidly and to be more productive.
It comes installed in a 3-position parallel port switchbox for added
convenience.  All 25 positions are switched.

As you may be aware, certain types of programs do not lend themselves
very well to the use of a debugger.  The program may be automatically
loaded by the operating system, and not give you any way to "attach"
the debugger.  Even if this is not a concern, the debugging software
itself may change the environment enough so that the program no longer
behaves in quite the same way as when the debugger isn't present.

WinkBug will solve these problems by virtue of being almost
"invisible" to both the OS and the program being tested.  Your program
may write debugging messages to the WinkBug display by means of
software contained in the wink.library.  There is even a built-in
beeper that responds to the ASCII BEL character.  The display speed is
fast enough for all but the most time critical code:  40us/char.  The
code in wink.library is very tight as well.

WinkBug will be useful in debugging device drivers, libraries,
handlers, interrupt service routines, and many more difficult pieces
of code.  Utilities are provided so that you may redirect Software
Alerts to WinkBug or watch task-switching in real time (only 7%
overhead).  Enforcer support is also provided.

Although there are debugging applications where a full ANSI terminal
is indispensable, you will find that for many uses, WinkBug will
function just as well, with the additional benefits of taking up
almost no space and drawing a negligible 10mw of power.

Even if a full ANSI terminal is available where you normally work, you
will find WinkBug indispensable for debugging code in the field.  It
is even possible to build hooks for WinkBug display routines into
your code, along with special access codes.  You could then send the
WinkBug hardware to a customer a continent away for remote debugging.
Imagine the possibilities!

WinkBug is plug compatible with all models of Amiga computers except
the A1000.  No external power needed.

PRICE

   US$54 + shipping.
   Shipping is $5 in the U.S. and Canada.  Others please call.

From: Andre Lackmann <76711.710@compuserve.com>
To: AR <rniles@hebron.connected.com>
Subject: SimCity 2000

Hi Robert!

I was sick and tired of having no answers to the question:

'Will SimCity 2000 be released for the Amiga?'

So I went and asked the publishers! Heres what they said:

#: 80551 S8/Maxis
    02-Jun-94  08:57:53
Sb: #80426-SimCity 2000 Amiga?
Fm: Maxis 71333,1470
To: Andre Lackmann 76711,710 (X)
 
Funny you should ask... my understanding is that one of our European
affiliates is developing a version for Amiga, and there is a good
possibility that we'll soon distribute it here in the States.  I'll let all
know once there has been a final decision.

You know, I AM still serious about that disk magazine thing.  To date,
though, I think I have three interested people on the list.  If you want to
sign up for the Coverdisk Mailing list, drop me a line.  I'm sending out
a mass mailing to our AR distributors tonight to see if they're interested
in directly carrying the disk magazine as well.  Remember, it's bound to
be about a 650k mail file...

Samsung...did they or didn't they?  Usenet rumors say that C=
distributors are being told it's a done deal, but nothing official yet.
We'll watch and wait.

Upcoming software reviews from me include MaxDOS, PhotoWorx,
DirWork 2, and Video Creator for the CD32.  Hardware reviews
include the Vortex 486SLC2, the SX-1, and the Toccata 16, assuming
I ever get it to output sound at all.

24-bit video boards?  I'm still trying.  GVP and Centaur finally are in 
the "No thanks, we're washing our hair and can't send you a board" 
column. 

Expert Services is supposedly getting one ready, DKB has me marked
down for a Talon, NoahJi's has me marked down for a Retina ZIII, and
Spectronics has me marked for a Merlin, assuming they get some more
that work.  (memory problems, the same think Expert Services told me
has held up some Picasso IIs.)

CD32 software?  Well, British Magazine Distributors seems to be the
source of choice for both of the US Amiga magazines, and I've sent
them off an Amiga Report sampler disk in the hope that I can
prove our worth to them.  We'll see.

Accelerator reviews?  I've sent off a sampler to Micro R&D in the
hopes of winning an Excalibur away for a month.  MacroSystem
Development is building Warp Engines with very long production
times and small profits at the moment, so they told me to call
back in a month or so.

Oh, yeah, there IS a review of Lock 'n Load sitting somewhere
in Robert Niles' mail.  It's a trifle short, and I don't plan to end
it with that, there's more to be said.  Don't worry.

[Ed: Ummm....I don't have it :) Will post it in AR219 ]

So, here's to hoping I get something in motion.  See you next
week, and maybe someone will own the Amiga by then.

Floppy Disk Port Based Amiga Network
By Douglas J. Nakakihara

   Spectronics International U.S.A. is now shipping a terrific 
product called AmigaLink that allows Amigas to be networked using the 
floppy drive port! Now even slotless models like the A500, A1200, and 
CDTV can be part of a network. 

   Although networking usually involves multiple users, single users 
can also benefit. Each step in the evolution of the Amiga has meant some 
incompatibility or another. As a result, many Amiga owners continue to 
hang on to them, even after purchasing a newer model. By networking 
them, peripherals can be shared, allowing maximum use of all hardware. 

ParNet 

   Of course, many Amiga owners already rely on the freely-
distributable ParNet software to network Amigas. Like ParNet, AmigaLink 
is also a so-called peer-to-peer network because all of the nodes (i.e., 
networked computers) are equals, and any one of them can access 
another's storage devices. A4000-Toaster owners will appreciate the fact 
that AmigaLink also doesn't use an expansion slot. 

   However, as wonderful as ParNet is, it's just a toy compared to 
AmigaLink. A downside of using ParNet is that only two Amigas can be 
networked, AmigaLink can have up to 20. Furthermore, because ParNet 
monopolizes the parallel port, it can be a real pain using other 
peripherals that use this port, like a printer, scanner, or audio 
digitizer. ParNet also provides no access-security between nodes. 

   Although, 20 is the recommended maximum number of nodes, that 
number can be exceeded, as can the recommended cable length limit of 330 
feet. Apparently, the amount of interference at the network's location 
determines the actual maximums. But this can only be determined by trial 
and error. For example, using shorter cabling between nodes, may allow 
you to exceed 20 Amigas. 

Installation 

   Although the manual provides adequate step-by-step instructions, 
they are spread over several chapters and the process takes longer than 
it should. Because installation is fairly involved, it would have been 
much better if the installation steps were consolidated and preceded by 
a brief overview of the procedures. In spite of this, I had two nodes up 
and running in about one-half hour. 

Hardware Hookup 

   To install AmigaLink, you must first physically connect the 
computers. The petite AmigaLink adapter is basically a 23-pin connector 
with a BNC T-connector protruding from where a cable would normally 
exists. A removable terminating cap is attached to one end of the T-
connector. AmigaLink will work with pass-through connectors and you can 
still have up to three floppy drives on each Amiga. 

   Each Amiga must have its own adapter and 50-ohm RG-58 coaxial 
cabling is supplied to connect the them together. By removing the 
terminating cap, you can daisy-chain multiple computers together; 
however, there must be a terminating cap on the first and last nodes. 
The procedure is easy and you don't even have to open a computer case! 

   The T-connector portion of the adapter is removable and you can 
disconnect or reconnect nodes without powering down. Connections will be 
re-established once nodes are reattached. However, you should never add 
or remove an AmigaLink adapter while the computer is running. 

Software Installation 

   The software is installed in three steps. First you must install 
the device driver on each Amiga. This is accomplished by merely clicking 
an icon and following the instructions. The manual provides detailed 
instructions on what AmigaDOS commands must be available for the 
installation script to work properly (e.g., Run, NewCLI, Copy, etc.). If 
the software is being installed on a floppy disk, you must delete some 
files to make room for the AmigaLink software. A handy list of deletable 
files is provided for Workbench 1.3 and 3.0 disks. Between the two, you 
can come up with a list for a 2.x Workbench disk. Obviously, you should 
use a copy of your original Workbench disk. 

   The second step is to install the file system software on each 
computer. Again, this is a click-and-go procedure. During this process 
you will be asked for a "host" name. Each node must have a unique name, 
like "Dougs4K", or "CDTV1." I'd recommend that you keep names as short 
as possible for reasons you'll see later on. (I was surprised to find 
that the AmigaLink device driver is SANA-II compatible (Standard Amiga 
Network Architecture). This means that ENVOY or other SANA-II compatible 
networking software can be used instead of the AmigaLink file system 
software.) 

Configuring Nodes 

   Once the device driver and file system are installed on all 
Amigas, the third step is to run the configuration programs on each 
node. These programs do not have to be installed on each node and can be 
run from the AmigaLink floppy disk. However, I found it more convenient 
to copy them to my hard drives for possible future configuration 
changes. There are two configuration programs: Import and Export. 

Export 

   Export allows you to identify which devices are available to other 
nodes. Remember, AmigaLink is a true multi-user network. As such, you 
can keep certain devices private and not allow remote access. This 
covers all storage devices including RAM: and removable media, like 
floppy drives (a disk must be present).  

   The Export settings can be saved as a default or just used for the 
current session. The settings file is saved in the ENVARC: directory 
under Networks. (ENVARC: is a standardized storage area for 
configuration information.) You can also save multiple settings. 

Import 

   Running the Import program brings up a list of the other nodes on 
the network, called "hosts." By selecting one of the hosts with the 
mouse, a list of all of its available (i.e., exported) devices appears. 
You can then select which devices should be mounted on this particular 
node. (Normally, the Export program should be run on all nodes before 
running the Import program.) 

   To avoid name conflicts, Import automatically appends the name of 
the Host to the front of the device and volume names. (Remember, every 
Amiga storage device has both a device and volume name, which are 
usually different.) For example, the device and volume names "HD1" and 
"Work" on host "A3000" become "A3000-HD1" and "A3000-Work", 
respectively. So if a node already had a HD1 device called Work, a 
similarly named device on a remote node could be accessed without 
conflict. The default names can be changed, however. 

   The Import settings are saved in a file in the WBStartup drawer. 
Although this is a logical location, booting up without all nodes active 
will yield a slew of annoying error requestors. You can drag the Import 
icon out of the WBStartup drawer, but you'll have to move it every time 
new settings are saved. I remedied this by adding some lines to my 
Startup-Sequence that checks for the Import files in the WBStartup 
drawer and then moves them to another drawer. This works because the 
Startup-Sequence is executed before WBStartup programs are run. I don't 
know why the Import settings aren't saved in the ENVARC: directory just 
like the Export settings. This would allow the Import startup icon to be 
placed anywhere. 

Utilities 

   Diagnostic utility programs are also supplied. One is a self-
testing program which identifies hardware problems. Two other programs 
test the receiving and sending abilities of computers on the network. 
The Statistics program monitors and displays network performance 
information. 

Network Printing 

   AmigaLink comes with a utility program called Spooler, which 
allows multiple nodes to "print" to the same printer. Spooler is run on 
the node with the printer, referred to as a "print-server." The program 
monitors a user-specified directory for activity. When a file is 
completely "printed" to that directory, Spooler sends it to the printer 
port, usually PAR:, and then deletes the file. 

   All other nodes must run the AmigaDOS CMD command, usually found 
in the Tools or Utilities drawer. Generally, CMD is used to redirect 
printer output to a file in RAM:. However, the output it intercepts can 
also be redirected over the network to the monitored Spooler directory. 
You should be able to set up multiple print-servers, each running its 
own Spooler. Nodes could then print to any of these servers by simply 
changing the CMD redirection. 

   Do not run CMD on the print-server, however. Doing so will create 
an endless loop: CMD redirects data headed for the parallel port to the 
Spooler directory, Spooler then sends this back out to the parallel 
port--you get the idea. 

OS1.3 

   Although, AmigaLink was developed for OS2.0+ users, it functions 
fine using OS1.3 (reportedly even on an Amiga 1000). It's not as 
automated as under OS2.0+, so you'll have to use some CLI commands. 
However, you can modify your Startup-Sequence to automate the process. 
Remember to include the StartServer command, as the installation process 
does not do it for you. 

My Network 

   My test network consisted of an Amiga 3000, 4000, and CDTV. The 
CDTV required using a pass-through external floppy drive. Since many 
external floppy drives, like the "official" black CDTV ones, do not have 
a pass-through connector, Spectronics will be releasing an inexpensive 
T-connector providing pass-through capabilities. An adapter for CD32 is 
supposedly in the works too. (Note: If you don't have a keyboard for 
your CDTV, there are a few public domain utility programs that emulate 
keyboard input using a mouse.) 

   I was extremely impressed with the AmigaLink. The network is 
professional and well implemented. Remote devices function just like 
local ones and their icons appear right on the Workbench, including 
"left out" icons (OS2.0+)! The network is virtually invisible. Here is 
where my earlier suggestion for short Host names comes into play. Volume 
names that display wider than their icon, will make for a real ugly 
Workbench! This is not a functional problem, but could become 
aesthetically annoying. 

   To network a CDTV, you'll need to have a non-booting CD inserted 
into the unit so it will boot off the floppy drive. I was happy to find 
that AmigaLink handled changing the CDs. Although the volume name didn't 
change, I could still access it. To get the name to change you must 
unmount and remount the device.  

   When I rebooted a node, I found that on remote nodes, I had to 
unmount and then remount any devices imported from the rebooted node. 
This was so, even though the Import program indicated the devices were 
mounted. You can click the "mounted" button twice or do it from the CLI. 
When there are a lot of devices, a script file to unmount devices works 
great. 

   I also found a conflict between by Goldengate 486 board and 
AmigaLink. However, as long as I didn't try to access a device on the 
Amiga with the GG486 while it was emulating, all was fine.  

Performance 

   Since Amiga floppy drives are no speed-burners, I was very 
interested to see what kind of performance a floppy port network could 
achieve. The manual states that the data transfer rate is 450,000 bits-
per-second, which translates to about 55 kilobytes-per-second (kbps). My 
best case was a disappointing 40kbps on my network, while ParNet 
achieved around 61kbps. 

   However, this is only half of the story. During transfers, ParNet 
hogged CPU time, while AmigaLink barely required any. So although 
AmigaLink is slower than ParNet, it uses substantially less system 
resources, which could be a factor when multitasking. Still, AmigaLink 
is just fast enough not to cause an anxiety attack. 

VideoToaster Farm 

   Spectronics is also considering releasing software to do 
simultaneous Lightwave rendering on multiple Amiga/Toaster systems. This 
is an excellent application for AmigaLink because a fast transfer rate 
is not a requirement. "Rendering farms"--just like the big boys (i.e., 
Amblin Imaging (seaQuest DSV) and Foundation Imaging (Babylon 5))--are 
now within the reach of smaller 3D studios. 

Worth The Price 

   This is an extremely important product for the Amiga and one that
I am very excited about. At $260 for a two-node network, AmigaLink may
seem a little expensive, but a functionally equivalent Ethernet-based
network would cost you many times that. AmigaLink performs like a full-
fledged network--albeit a little slower--and is well worth its cost.

$124.95 for each additional

TITLE

     SatTrack 

VERSION

     Current Version is SatTrack 4.1.  
     All new version are free to registered users.

AUTHOR

     Randy Stackhouse, N4RTL
     EMAIL:  R.STACKHOUSE@GENIE.GEIS.COM

DESCRIPTION

       A satellite tracking program.  Allows for selection of a database
       that can contain up to 1000 satellites.  Tracks satellites on a
       graphics display of the world.  All graphics are IFF compatible
       allowing for loading of display to standard painting program.
       SatTrack allows for input of satellite data using either standard
       data format or by simple user input.  Satellite database files 
       are included, also information for obtaining database updates from
       public domain and government locations.   All operations use 
       standard windows and menus.  SatTrack has a simulation mode that 
       allows for predictions in the future.  Operates on Workbench 1.3,
       2.X and 3.X.  This is version 4.1. SatTrack is keyware, see the 
       registration file for more information.  SatTrack Demo is fully 
       operational until the expiration time is reached.

NEW FEATURES
	
       New for SatTrack 4.1
       Addition of support for various sized screens.  This allows for
       better support of PAL users and users with extended graphics
       cards.  
 
       Also included is Sun tracking which allows for calculation of 
       sun position.  Sun position is required to allow SatTrack to
       calculate the times when a particular satellite, shuttle or MIR
       is "in the sun" and you are not.  This determination allows the
       SatTrack user to predict when a space object is visible.

       Overhead view is a map of the sky from your location.   It is
       representative of where the satellite will travel within your
       view.   The display represents a circle.  The center of the
       circle is "up".  The outside circumference of the circle is
       your "horizon".  Another circle 1/2 the size of the other circle
       with the same center is the 45degree azimuth from your location.

BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED'S statement on CBM situation

   By now, we've all heard the sad news about Commodore.  Since the
announcement, we at BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED have been bombarded with 
calls, letters, e-mails, rotten tangerines, dismembered weasel carcasses,
etc., all asking the big question:  "What is going to happen next?"  Well,
here is some news to dispel all those nasty rumors and set your minds at 
ease. Unless you're one of the dweebs who threw the weasels.  We've got a 
surprise in store for YOU.  Heh heh.

   And now, as a public service, BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED proudly
presents the TRUE ANSWERS to the most pressing questions that have been
rattling around in our tiny little brains for the past few weeks.

Q: Is Commodore dead?
A: According to Ron Nibbly, head of our "Legal Department", Commodore
   has "filed for bankruptcy under Bahamian Law.  This is a highly
   technical process which consists mainly of filing several hundred
   legal documents and then drinking oneself into a stupor on a sunny,
   tropical beach."  (Hence the term, "voluntary liquidation.")  So no,
   Commodore is not dead:  it's blind, staggering drunk.  Except for the
   Marketing Department, which amazingly is going to turn a profit this
   quarter.

Q: Is somebody going to buy Commodore?
A: Yes, absolutely.

Q: I heard that Samsung is buying (or considering buying) Commodore.
   Is this true?
A: No.  This ridiculous story began on USENET because of a network
   glitch.  A bunch of people in c.s.a.advocacy were talking about the
   Massachusetts-based Free Software Foundation, the makers of GNU
   software (gcc, emacs, etc.).  Somebody's network node hiccupped, and
   the letters of "GNU MASS" got rearranged to spell "SAMSUNG".  Yes,
   it's true.  Amazing how rumors start, eh?

Q: Oh yeah?  Then who is going to buy CBM, Mr. Smarty Pants?
A: We at BLAZEMONGER INC. have direct access to the most up-to-date,
   secret information about the impending purchase of Commodore.  Ten
   or fifteen vendors are currently battling it out, and Commodore will
   apparently go to the winner.  Nobody knows for sure which vendor
   will emerge victorious, but BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED is betting on
   "Bob's Bait 'n Tackle."  This popular fishing supply store in
   Chickenmilk, Wisconsin, hopes to get the rights to the AAA chipset.
   According to the owner, Bob "Bob" Bob, "them there Super Duper Agnes
   chips done make a excellent bait fer catchin' all kinds 'o fish."
   If he wins the rights, Bob plans to license the technology to other
   vendors if they can successfully answer a 15-question quiz about
   mackerel.  Anyone wanting more information can write to Bob at
   bobbobbob@fishnet.bnt.com.

Q: Where is Irving Gould now?
A: Having recovered from his beachside "liquidation", Irving has
   retired and moved to Skink City, Iowa, where he has opened up a PC
   clone dealership.  Reports say he sold 8 computers this month and
   somehow managed to pull in a $1,400,000 salary.

Q: And where is Medhi Ali?
A: We're offering him a job as a punching bag for the "Customer
   Service" department.

Q: And for THAT matter, where is Sue West, our favorite ex-CBMer whose
   bulletins used to grace the comp.sys.amiga.announce newsgroup?
A: After her unfortunate dismissal from CBM during one of the last
   rounds of layoffs, Sue vanished from sight, but we managed to track
   her down.  It turns out that as Sue was leaving CBM for the last
   time, she was mistaken for someone else, abducted, and committed to
   the West Chester Home For The Mentally Wacky.  Fortunately, we at
   BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED were able to negotiate with the doctors
   there and get her out.  Actually, we just sent a few helpful
   "Customer Service" folks to the Home carrying a big sign that said
   "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE."

Q: Will BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED continue to support the Amiga?
A: Yes, definitely!  We will continue bringing you the finest
   ViolentWare (TM) products on the planet... and then some!  Next
   week, we'll be releasing BLAZE-MELTDOWN, a new "simulation" type
   game in the spirit of Sim City, Populous, etc., but not like those
   WIMPY TRASH PSEUDO-GAMES.  In BLAZE-MELTDOWN, you get to simulate
   the operation of an actual nuclear reactor.  The feeling of realism
   is intensified by forcing your computer monitor to emit FIVE
   THOUSAND TIMES its normal amount of RADIATION.  We are sure that
   you will have an exciting reaction to this explosive new product.


   Well, I hope this article clears up some of the LIES and
MISINFORMATION floating around the Net.  More should become clear as the
weeks go on.  And if not, we'll be happy to "clarify" some more. :-)

                                                        Dan


ps:     Thanks to Dense from IRC for preening my pet basilisk, "Boinky".

Ever wonder what all those files are on your hard drive? A lot of them
don't really do anything but sit there and stare back at you. In fact,
that is what most of them do... and in some cases when you need to use
a file, it will be there for you. But keep in mind that for years,
Amiga users have been using Workbench disks with virtually no files on
them other than the LoadWB command, since most of the important stuff
is located on the Kickstart ROM.


Here are some files on most Workbench disks, with a quick explanation of
what they are there for:

.backdrop       On Workbench 2.0 or greater machines, this tells the
                Workbench which icons have been dragged out of a
                drawer and onto the Workbench.

.info           Contains some information about the current directory.

<file>.config   Not set by the Workbench, but used by some third party
                programs that you may have bought or downloaded, and will
                contain information that you or the program set to use
                as a configuration or preference. In other words, it
                contains custom information that the program will use
                to set itself on your system.

<file>.datatype This is a type of display driver that works with the
                Workbench Multiview utility on Workbench 2.1 or greater.
                Each datatype will support an image format, an audio
                format, text format, or other multimedia format. This
                replaces programs such as More, AmigaGuide, WDisplay,
                etc.

<file>.device   This is a special type of library that is used by
                programs. This might explain how to produce speech,
                how to access the serial port, or how to use other
                types of hardware.

<file>.font     Here we find information about fonts, such as the name
                of the font and what sizes are available.

<file>.guide    These are hypertext documents that are included with
                Workbench 2.1 or greater. You can download AmigaGuide
                from a BBS if you have another Workbench, at least
                version 1.3. These are often used as help files or
                online magazines. :)

<file>-handler  This is a type of library that explains how to use
                things such as the mouse and keyboard, as far as
                receiving input. It is often used to pass information
                around the system.

<file>.info     This is the image used for the icon of a file, along
                with other information such as the stack size and
                parameters to pass to the file, which can be changed
                from the Workbench.

<file>.library  This is the collection of commands that allow programs
                to run. These are some of the most frequently used
                commands. Instead of a program containing its own
                commands, it can share libraries with other programs.
                These commands might include math operations like
                sine and cosine, or openning windows and drawing
                lines.

disk.info       This contains the icon for the current partition, floppy
                disk, or hard drive.

kickstart       This files is located on many Amiga 3000 computers. It
                contains the Kickstart ROM on disk. Many Amiga 3000
                computers do not have the ROMs on chips, and load
                them off the hard drive. Without this file, you computer
                may not boot. Some machines have this file and a ROM
                chip because Commodore put the ROM chips in without
                removing it from the hard drives. This was not a bad
                decision, but however it does use 1/2 megabyte of disk
                space. If you know you have the ROM chips on your
                motherboard, you can delete this file. If your computer
                no longer boots, you will have to reinstall the Kickstart
                from the SuperKickstart install disk. Better left alone!

loadwb          This small command loads the Workbench, which is stored
                in the Kickstart ROM. The Loadwb command is stored often
                in the C directory. If you ever have a shell open but the
                Workbench is missing, try typing loadwb.

mountlist       This contains information on the hard drives and floppy
                drives attached to your system, such as the partition
                size. Newer versions of the Workbench and Kickstart do
                not require these files, but in many cases use them for
                RAD: devices and other similar devices.

shell-startup   This script is executed whenever you open a shell or
                CLI. You can change the prompt, or write messages to
                yourself :). Mine sets aliases to make it similar to
                cshell, which is used on UNIX machines.

startup-sequence This is executed whenever you boot your computer. It
                loads all the files it thinks are necessary for you to
                be happy.

user-startup    Here is a type of startup-sequence that you are welcome
                to modify to suit your needs. The startup-sequence, in
                most cases, will execute it while booting.

 - THE PRIZE FOR NEXT MONTH -

     The Amiga Report contest is still going on, and it is not too
 late to enter. This ongoing monthly contest allows Amiga Report
 readers a chance to win software by either solving a puzzle or by
 entering a random drawing.

     The prize this month is the Amiga/Toaster Reference Manual v2.221,
 from Area52. This is a 1,000 page help system for the Amiga and Video
 Toaster, covering the Workbench, AmigaDOS, Lightwave, and more ($34.95).
     The second prize choice is the FutureShock audio CDROM,  which was
 produced using Amiga computers by SideWinder. There are some Sidewinder
 music modules on Aminet that you may want to look at for a sample of
 the audio CD ($12.95).
     Previously we have offered the ARexx Reference Disk by Merrill
 Callaway, which was awarded to a previous winner. Contact Whitestone
 for more information (505) 268-0678.

     All monthly contests end on the morning of the first of the
 following month. Any entries beyond this date will be entered into the
 next contest.


 - THE MONTHLY DRAWING -

     To enter the random drawing, select a number from 1 to 262,144
 and send it to me at one of my addresses listed below, either by
 the postal service or email through the Internet.
     Also, you may enter by solving the following puzzle. The winner
 of this puzzle will be decided within the same time frame as the
 random prize, to allow the contest information to filter through the
 networks, and to allow your letters and postcards to come in.


 - THE PUZZLE -

     Since people complained that the first contest was too hard, and
 that the second was too easy, I made one that anyone can solve with
 a little thought. Once you get some of it decoded you will be able
 to solve it with ease ::heh heh::!

         Decrypt the following encoded message: 17851 47932

         Each location in the code represents one character in the
     ASCII character set from A to Z. Also provide your method of
     obtaining the answer.


 - TO ENTER -

     To enter, simply let your fingers do the talking and write an
 email and send it to dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu. You MUST put
 the word CONTEST in the subject line of the email header! Otherwise
 you run the risk of having your email deleted (don't ask, it is a
 long story!) or send a post card or letter to:

     Amiga Report Contest
     c/o David Tiberio
     6 Lodge Lane
     East Setauket, NY 11733

     Is it possible to win via snail mail? You might think that your
 chances of winning are better by entering in email (much faster of
 course), but last month's winner send in a letter that arrived the
 day before his winning number was drawn!

     In your letter or email, please provide the following:

     Your full name and address. Please keep in mind that many of
 you may have addresses that I am not accustomed to, so please include
 your country or any other information that I would need in case you
 win. An email address should also be included, if possible.

    You must also include a brief one sentence overview of the editorial
 in this issue of AMiga Report. Just to make sure you are reading it. :)
 You must also include the issue number. For example, if you read this in
 AR213, then include that in your correspondance. Also, a prize winner
 will be determined by a random number generator. Choose a number from
 1 to 262,144. The closest winner or winners to the randomly generated
 number will receive the prize in the mail. Anyone who does not provide
 a number will have one assigned to him randomly.

     All prizes will be mailed within one week after I get my hands on
 the published version of AmigaReport. I am doing this for a few reasons.
 First, every winner so far has given the correct puzzle solution before
 I have received the editon of AmigaReport that announced it. :)
 Second, I don't like to go to the post office every day if I can avoid
 it. Third, you never know when someone's power supply might blow up
 (right Mr. Editor?!).


 - RULES AND REGULATIONS -

 1. In the evnt that the editor's power supply fries, the contest for
    that month will have its deadline postponed to a later date, to be
    announced. Any contest entries for the random drawing will be added
    to the next month's drawing, to be held once per month near the
    beginning of the month.

 2. All prizes are donated. I cannot be held responsible for any damage
    caused by a prize. For example, if you leave your prize on the
    stairs and your grandmother slips on it, I will not pay her medical
    bills.

 3. We are not doing this for any profit, and cannot be held responsible
    if we go out of business or are otherwise financially unable to give
    you anything! We are actively looking for submissions from other
    software authors.

 4. Good things come to those who read the rules and regulations! Here
    is a tip to help you win: every problem is a trick problem, or gives
    you clues that are not part of the problem itself. Read the whole
    entire contest entry looking for clues. And read my other articles
    for more clues. I give some very obvious clues :).

 5. If for any circumstance you are awarded a prize but do not receive
    it, contact me at (516) 476-1615. I will promptly attend to any
    mistakes that have been made.

 6. These rules are subject to change at any time without warning!


 - THE DISCLAIMER -

     DISCLAIMER: This contest is being provided as a service to the
     Amiga community and all persons involved in running this contest
     cannot be held liable for anything that costs you money or
     lifetime pain and anguish. Rules are subject to change. All entries
     must be received by whenever TBA. Any entries beyond this date
     will be entered into the next contest, if any.


 - THE CHANCE YOU WILL WIN -

     Odds of winning are approximately 1:50 for the random drawing and
 1:15 for the correct answer to the puzzle, based upon current entries.

     SPECIAL THANKS to SideWinder for donating the Future Shock albums
 for inclusion in our contest, along with Merrill Callaway for his ARexx
 Reference Disk!

%% Emulation Rambler                                  by @{" Jason Compton " link P8-2} %%

IMPORTANT!  KEEP READING TO SEE A UNIQUE CHANCE TO
HELP THE RAMBLER IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED!

Well, let's just say I haven't DONE much, but it's not for lack of trying.

My wonderful friend Katie Nelson just got her Vortex 486SLC2 emulator
board.  Unfortunately, we've had nearly zero success getting it up and
running on her 4000...it seems that just about every command we can
give it crashes either just the emulation or the emulation AND the Amiga.
This is not good.  We'll work on it, though, and find out how good GMR's
technical support REALLY is. :)

The SX-1 made it out of alpha and beta boards are being built this week.
I'm calling Thursday to confirm the status of mine.  When I asked about
the results of the alpha boards, I was told by Jerry at Paravision,
"There's too many damn wires," and that they had a few problems 
getting around CD32 design flaws that apparently violate Commodore's
own standards.  I'll keep you posted.

My MaxDOS package is shipping now.  If I haven't mentioned it, or you
haven't heard of it, it's basically a Macintosh file system for the Amiga,
meaning you can access Mac disks and hard drives as AmigaDOS devices and
files.  Not a bad idea, is it?  When I get it, I will of course give you 
a comprehensive review.

My summation of the Emplant/A-Max review series has met with some
criticism on c.s.a.emulators, particularly from those who feel that I was
too easy on A-Max IV for supporting far less 24-bit video boards than
the Emplant.  To that, I say that I gave the evaluation that I felt was
deserved.

I will readily concede that I could have done a more thorough job if
I had 24-bit boards at my disposal, but STILL, no company has
been interested in providing one for review, or at the very least
has actually come through with the goods.  I do my best.

Chris Hames has been talking about V3 of his PC-Task IBM
software emulator.  No release date has been set yet, but an
important addition will be support for 286 code meaning <drum roll>
you can run Windows 3.1 on it!  <cymbal crash>

Finally, V1.1 of Kevin Kralian's moderately controversial Apple 2000
emulator has been released.  He still doesn't mention me in the doc
file. :)

Seriously, he claims to have sped up some routines a bit and has
added support for two things:
1.  Support for the "generic disk image" format, which is popular on
    Apple II FTP sites.
2.  Support for the A1020 5.25 inch drive, included as a separate
    utility written by Ron Menelli, for transferring Apple II disks to a 
    usableimage.

Finally, I suppose you're interested in finding out what it was I was
talking about above, in terms of helping me out.  Well, I'm in the market
for a new bridgeboard-preferably a Commodore 386sx, but that's
negotiable.  My net address should be listed around the magazine,
but for repetition's sake, here's all of my important information-

Jason Compton
1203 Alexander Ave.
Streamwood, IL  60107-3003
jcompton@bbs.xnet.com
Fax: (708) 741-0689.

Thanks for your time.  Keep the emulators warm, and sell me a bridgeboard.

                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

  Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

  The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software, online.

  Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

  Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES.

  35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

  No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

  Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

  Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

  Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

  FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
  Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  

  Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

  The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
  Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
  All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

  Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

  And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

  UNIX "telnet" program from an account you may already
  have on an Internet-connected system. 
% 9600 bps Sprintnet in over 300 cities areas
+ $10 rate prevails at smaller US Cities
# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

/// BIX - Byte Information Exchange             Lots of information!
    -------------------------------



BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and enthusiasts.
While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is the place for 
knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  You're likely 
to find many others in similar situations who can offer advice, give 
technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.


                       *** FULL INTERNET ACCESS! ***

BIX features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription. 


                      ==============================
                      Rates and Connect Information:
                      ==============================


BIX membership costs $13 per month, plus connect time.  There are several 
different ways to connect:

SprintNet*              $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet:**               $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
(SprintNet and Tyment rates shown are for 48 contiguous US states only.)
                                                        
Tymnet Canada:          $4/hr eves/wkends           $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet Hawaii:          $10/hr eves/wkends          $20/hour weekdays   
Telnet(via Internet):   $1/hour, round the clock
Direct dial (Boston):   $2/hour, round the clock (up to 9600 bps)
 
 * SprintNet daytime hours are from 6am to 7pm, M-F, ET.
** Tymnet daytime hours are from 7am to 6pm, M-F, ET.

                20/20 PLAN OPTION (for USA-48 users only):

Volume users can choose the 20/20 Advantage Plan, which is $20 per month
and includes the first 20 hours of access by any combination of methods 
from the contiguous United States.  Additional use is $1.80 per hour 
(additional use for telnet access is $1 an hour).  The 20/20 Plan's cost is 
in addition to the $13 monthly fee.  


                           INTERNATIONAL USERS:

If you wish to connect internationally through Tymnet or SprintNet, 
please contact your local PTT.  BIX accepts prepaid international calls,
direct dial, or telnet connections.  In order to make a "collect" (not 
prepaid) call to BIX, your account must be verified before the charges 
are accepted.  When you complete the registration, we'll mail you a BIX
Membership Agreement by regular US Mail.  Whe you receive it, sign it 
and return it to us by mail.  When we receive it here, we'll authorize
your account to make reverse charged calls.

If you want to access BIX right away, contact your local PTT to set up a 
prepaid account.  You'll pay your local carrier for your calls to BIX in
advance, so there's no waiting period or verfication needed. Or, connect 
at BIX via telnet to x25.bix.com.

SprintNet international calls from most locations are $24 an hour.
Tymnet international charges vary, but are generally between $20-$30 an hour.


                           ====================
                           Billing Information: 
                           ====================

You can charge your monthly BIX membership fees to your Visa, 
Mastercard, Discover, or American Express card.

a BIX Corporate Account.

                            ===================
                            To Sign Up For BIX:

   Press a few carriage returns until you see the Login:(enter "bix") 
   prompt, then type  bix

   At the Name? prompt, type bix.amrpt

* Users already on the internet can telnet to x25.bix.com instead.
  At the USERNAME: prompt enter bix, then bix.net at the Name? prompt.

current calender month (whatever month you sign up in), for $5.  
Additional time is $1.80 per hour ($1 per hour for telnet).  At the end 
of the calender month, you will be placed into our standard rate plan, 
at $13 monthly plus connect charges.  You may also join the 20/20 Plan 
at this time.

     This is an update to Yak 1.57, it fixes 5 bugs and introduce some
     new features :

     * Now when alt key is pressed, Yak doesn't blank the mouse 
       so that accessing menus via keyboard is easier.
     * Now compilable with both SAS C 6.51 and with DICE !
     * Black border for screens (available only in 3.0+).
     * New layout of the GUI.

TITLE

    FGP2

VERSION

    2.02

AUTHOR

    Simon Austin (austins@sol2.uel.ac.uk)

DESCRIPTION

    At the start of this Formula One season Autosport magazine
    started running a Fantasy Grand Prix competition.  FGP2 is a
    program which allows you to avoid working out how many places
    your driver gained on his grid position and shows how many points
    Rubens Barrichello scored by coming in third.  FGP2 has a simple
    command line interface and takes most of its input in the form of
    human-readable ascii files which can be created on any text
    editor.  FGP2 comes complete with enough data files to get you up
    to date (currently the Monaco Grand Prix), full instructions and
    rules.  As of this release FGP2 2.02 can cope with up to 50
    fantasy teams and contains details for all the drivers who have
    driven in this season.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    None.

@node P5-3 "DeepSpace v1.2"
@toc "menu"

TITLE

      DeepSpace

VERSION

      V1.2

AUTHOR

      Todd & Darrell Neumiller
      (Darrell Neumiller - neumille@hpspkla.spk.hp.com)

DESCRIPTION

   DeepSpace is a Shell/CLI multi-player, multi-node BBS, space roll 
   playing game.  Real time fighting, chat and etc.  You can have up to
   20 players playing the game at the same time.  Only 10 players are
   allowed to play a game in the unregisted version, and up to 100 
   users after DeepSpace has been registered.  If your BBS can't run
   a Shell/CLI door, we have a Paragon door version too.  You can also
   play DeepSpace locally from a SHELL while other players are playing
   the game at the same time.

FEATURES

   - Documentation is in Amigaguide format.
   - Easy to use installation program.
   - On-line Editor for players, aliens and planets.
   - Up to 50 definable names for Alien races can be used in a game.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

   We haven't finished everything we originally set out to accomplish 
   with DeepSpace.  Here is a few of our version 2 enhancement ideas.

   - If you go through the BlackHole when it's un-stable (and make it 
     through) you will see the planet 'Praxis'.  The players will be
     able beam to/from the planet.  Hostile Mutants, Aliens and on-line 
     players could be on the planet.  Different objects could be obtained
     there, Weapons, Crystals, and Better Scanners? ect..  An example 
     that's being considered: A weapon that can be left at the DeepSpace
     port, which could be programmed, via DNA scan, to detonate when a 
     certain Explorer arrives at the port.
   - Gambling at the DeepSpace port.  Possibly against other on-line
     players as well.
   - The Shap Shifter could be anywhere!  Could be selling illegal
     items from planet Praxis?  Could end up in jail with no way out,
     or will there be a way out?

DISTRIBUTION

   DeepSpace is shareware.  It is freely distributable, as long as
   you distribute all files.  Feel free to include it in any public
   domain collections (i.e. fish disks).

REQUIREMENTS

   Workbench 2.0 or higher.  You install DeepSpace with its own 
   installation program.

@node P5-4 "SpiroDraw v.04"
@toc "menu"

TITLE

     SpiroDraw04  - Spirograph(tm?) simulator of the spiral-drawing toy.
                    Simple, fun and addictive!

VERSION

     This is version 04.  Fixes an ugly GADGET message bug and a couple
     obscure bugs.  Also improved usability of Random and Previous data
     functions in the program.

COMPANY

     No company, just an AMINET upload by "yours truly".

AUTHOR

     SpiroDraw04 was written by me, Chuck Kenney.  My particulars
     (address, etc.) are included in the user document in the archive.

DESCRIPTION

     SpiroDraw04 simulates the Wheels-and-Rings-and-Pens spirograph
     drawing toy.  Allows the user to specify different parameters for
     the "Drawing Wheels, Drawing Rings", etc.  The use of a computer
     to generate the SpiroDraw designs actually enhances some of the
     capabilities!  SpiroDraw04 is mouse-driven (MENUs, GADGETs, etc.)
     and provides an easy way to create one's own 'eye-candy'.  It is
     fun _and_ addictive!  SpiroDraw04.lha also contains a very nice
     freely distributable "screen-to-IFF" saver utility written by
     Preben Nielsen (thanks, Preben) so that SpiroDraw designs can be
     imported into "paint" programs.  SpiroDraw04 is shareware but does
     not nag the user in any way and all features are fully functional.

NEW FEATURES

     The user now has the ability in SpiroDraw04 to interrupt a
     SpiroDraw design-in-progress with a Left Mouse Button click.

     Moved the "Random" and "Last" (previous) data functions from
     MENUs to the "Set Data..." user-input window so the user could
     get immediate viual feedback on the "new" parameters that are
     set by these two functions.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     There are no special requirements that I know of.
     SpiroDraw03 has been tested on an A2000HD (OS 2.1)
     and an A1000 (OS 1.3).

HOST NAME

     SpiroDraw04.lha has just been uploaded to the AMINET site,
     ftp.etsu.edu (192.43.199.20) and should soon be available on
     all AMINET mirrors.

DIRECTORY

     aminet/gfx/misc/SpiroDraw04.lha

FILE NAMES

     SpiroDraw04.lha is 57,195 bytes long.

PRICE

     The asking shareware price is the amount sent to me by my first
     sharware contributor (Thanks go to Bill from Glendale, AZ!).
     This requested shareware fee is $5.00 (US).  

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     This program is freely distributable but is a copyrighted (1994)
     shareware program by me, Chuck Kenney.

OTHER

     SpiroDraw04, and other programs in progress are coming out of my
     basement as a result of the availability of a truly wonderful
     "BASIC-but-much-more!" compiler, "ACE" by David Benn.  I would
     like to sincerely thank Mr. Benn for renewing my enthusiasm in
     programming and for making it possible for me to make my programs
     available to more than just my friends and immediately family!
