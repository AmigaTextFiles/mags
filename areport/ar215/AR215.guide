You've asked for it ...you'll get it!

Quite a few of you out there have asked for more pictures within
Amiga Report.  So...it's a start but as you might have noticed, a 
few pictures have been added ....and we'll be adding more in the
future.  David Tiberio has been kind enough to help us out in setting
up the installer for Amiga Report, and setting up the script that we
are using to display the pictures.  David has made the script to 
find out and run the picture viewers that you have on your system.
This help us a bit since we won't have to worry and wonder how you
have your system set up.  Hence, there is a script, now included with
AR called 'display.s'.  Don't delete this, as AR is set up to find this.
Give me feedback on how you like it.

Also Jason Compton will be organizing and distributing a "CoverDisk"
for Amiga Report.  Since we don't want the size of the magazine to
increase dramatically, we are doing this seperately.  Read the
announcement, and let us know what you think!

In the meantime, I'll let you get on with your reading!

INOVAtronics announces EDGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EDGE Professional Text Editor Version 1.721

Retail Price US$99.95

EDGE is a powerful and easily configurable text editor for 
writing and editing common ASCII text files. Uses include 
editing AmigaDOS batch files (such as the Amiga's Startup-
Sequence), as a "front end" editor for Desktop Publishing 
programs, and as a source code editor for various programming 
languages such as C or ARexx. EDGE is desirable for any project 
where a conventional word processor would embed unwanted, 
invisible formatting codes in your text. Toaster users will 
find EDGE a perfect companion to Directory OPUS and great for 
tweaking those Lightwave render files.


EDGE Feature List

- May open unlimited number of files (limited only by memory).
- Allows unlimited number of windows per file.
- Real-time update of a file's windows.
- Files may be saved with Snapshot which maintains the local 
  editing environment in the icon for the project.
- Extensive AmigaGuide on-line help everywhere.
- Powerful undo and redo feature.
- EDGE's custom screen is public, allowing other applications 
  to exist its screen.
- Can open on the Workbench screen, or on any application that 
  uses a public screen.
- User definable fonts.
- Has the ability to hide sections of text inside "folds". 
  Folds can be nested.
- Unlimited amount of ErrorMarks and IMarks, 10 BookMarks, one 
  AutoMark.
- When EDGE is running, it opens a device much like a "RAM 
  Disk". This device works just like any disk on the WorkBench, 
  inside Directory OPUS, or when named in a shell.
- User definable menus, user definable keyboard layout, all 
  texts, messages, errors, prompts, titles, etc., are completely 
  definable.
- Fast search and replace.
- Powerful, well integrated ARexx support with a rich set of 
  editor ARexx commands, as well as a macro recording facility.
- You may Iconify and deiconify EDGE via window gadget or 
  hotkey.
- Many Search/replace commands.
- Backup-system supports auto-numbering and handling of 
  multiple backups per file.
- All config files and startup scripts may be overridden and 
  startup using special keywords or tooltypes.
- Wordwrap with user definable right border.
- Autosave via user definable timer (in minutes). You can also 
  define how autosave works
- Two clipboards, one local to the current file and one global 
  which is shared by the whole Amiga.
- Powerful printing system. User definable printer device, 
  header and footer files, etc.
- Each file has a user definable local environment that may be 
  saved with the file in the icon.
- The EDGE global environment, which effects all EDGE files, is 
  also controlled with a point and click requestor. The entire 
  environment can be controlled from ARexx.
- The user may elect to use either the Commodore standard ASL 
  FileRequestor or the EDGE built-in requestor.
- All EDGE requestors may be user positioned or pointer 
  relative.
- EDGE task priority is user definable, as are the ARexx-
  console and the time delay to wait before closing the ARexx-
  console.
- The EDGE icon toolname is user definable and so is the EDGE 
  project icon.
- The status line may be either in the top or the bottom of the 
  window, ink and paper colors are user definable.
- The EDGE text windows can have 'autofunctions" attached to   
  them: bring a window in front of all other windows at 
  activation, zoom window at deactivation, unzoom window at 
  activation, adjust window size to even chars when the window is 
  resized.

Xenomiga Technology announces XENOLINK 1.90
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Next Generation Professional Bulletin Board Software
Copyright =A9 1990-1994 Xenomiga Technology

The principle upon which Xenolink has been designed:

"If a QuickSort in C is faster than a Bubble Sort in Assembly Language,
then let Xenolink be the QuickSort in Assembly Language."

It has been a year since the last release of Xenolink; Version Z.3a.

In that year, Xenolink has been redesigned and completely rewritten, to
incorporate the features that users have requested, and to support more
ambitious features, some of which are already under development.

Xenolink's efficient new architecture is now faster and more compact than
ever.

The changes are obviously far too numerous to list, but a brief synopsis
of the areas affected is listed below:

    o Attractive AmigaDOS Release 2 interface
    o Vastly enhanced security features
    o Improved door support
    o Completely redesigned FidoNet support
    o Decrease in the already low usage of memory and disk space
    o Even faster operation than before

Xenolink 1.90 has been tested as never before, by countless beta testers
with setups ranging from Amiga 500's to 4000's, 68000's to 68040's,
CD-ROMs, FAX-Modems, HST 16.8k modems, Point hosts, Network hubs,
multi-line systems - the list goes on.

Overview
--------

   o Designed and written for AmigaDOS Release 2 and above
   o Superlative reliability
   o Very easy to use
   o Attractive interface
   o State of the art software design and system architecture
   o Full multi-line capability
   o Configurability to an almost sinful degree
   o Foreign language support
   o Highly efficient use of memory and disk space
   o Optimised high speed performance
   o Object Oriented library and door interface
   o Full XPR (External Protocol) support
   o Low CPU usage
   o Supports all serial cards and all baud rates
   o Uses Commodore's (GUI) Installer program for easy installation
   o Mature software; large amount of third party Xenolink software 
     available
   o Large private support network linking together hundreds of Xenolink
     owners with Xenomiga Technology

Base Software Architecture
--------------------------

   o Xenolink Resource Handler controls access to all Xenolink resources
       - Avoids unnecessary disk activity if a resource (such as a message
         base or file area) is in use by more than one process
       - Crash protection; if a door crashes or hangs a Xenolink node, 
         system data files and log files are preserved, even on the node 
         that crashed
       - Automatic resource preloading enables Xenolink to asynchronously
         open files before they are required, thus reducing the bottleneck
         caused by disk activity

   o Memory usage
       - Dynamic memory and resource allocation
       - Xenolink and its accompanying utilities are residentable
           (extremely low memory usage for multiple nodes)
       - Extensive use of xenolink.library shared library routines
       - All executables are very compact
           (needless compiler overhead eliminated)

   o Disk space usage
       - Two files per message area, for unequalled speed and compactness
       - Three files per file area
       - Compact user data files
       - Real-time data compression used on compiled nodelist
       - Xenolink's compact data files have numerous advantages:
            o Very high speed operation due to the small number of files 
              used
            o Minimises disk fragmentation
            o Data files are easily archived
            o Makes backing up very easy (very few files to back up)

   o Speed
       - Very fast implementation of fast algorithms (both are important!)
       - Enhanced Global Quick Indexing (EQDX) algorithms enable virtually
         instantaneous location of any file catalogue entry or user
       - Written in C and assembly language, using SAS/C Version 6
       - Any area requiring speed has been written directly in assembly
         language; this includes:
            o Screen/modem i/o
            o Mail processing parsing and i/o
            o Searching
            o Sorting
            o Hashing
            o Semaphoring
            o CRC checking

   o Ease of use
       - Only a few assign statements required
            o Xenolink does not require you to add countless assign
              statements to your startup-sequence
            o Location of all directories specified in "dir.config" file
       - Separate configuration files, stored in a single directory:
            o General/global configuration options
            o Node configuration
            o Message bases
            o File areas
            o User access templates
            o Bulletins
            o Archivers
            o External protocols
            o BBS text
            o BBS entry points
            o Access restrictions
       - FidoNet configuration files stored in a separate directory:
            o Node security (password, default protocol, archive type,
              send type)
            o Nodelist configuration
            o NetMail routing and forwarding
            o EchoMail area configuration (origin lines, feeds,
              passthrough areas)

Sysop Interface
---------------

   o AmigaDOS Release 2 interface
   o Different fonts (and different point sizes) supported.
   o Pulldown menus and keyboard shortcuts
   o Font/Overscan preference aware; most Xenolink screens size
     themselves to the largest size configured via AmigaDOS preferences
   o Automatic screen centering
   o Xenolink front end can open on any public screen
   o Can display all 256 characters in any font, including the 
     international character codes 128-160, which cannot be displayed by
     the standard Amiga console or CLI
   o Full 16-colour high intensity ANSI support, on both the local screen
     and remote
   o Supports many IBM PC ANSI extensions not supported by the Amiga 
     console, such as cursor save/restore
   o System configuration is stored in text files, for easy editing with
     either a text editor of your choice, or a Xenolink GUI program
   o Can change resolution and colours of screen while node is running
   o Up to 5 "favourite" resolutions/bitplanes can be stored for easy
     point-and-click retrieval

Security
--------

   o Logging of all node activity
   o Xenolink can automatically inform a user via mail whenever an illegal
     access attempt is made on his account; the user will be told the
     passwords used
   o User passwords are stored in the user file using a non-reversible
     encryption algorithm, so that if a hacker ever does manage to steal 
     your user files, user passwords will be indecipherable
   o New user procedure requires that user passwords are at least 8
     characters long and include both letters and numbers, to hinder brute
     force dictionary based decryption attempts.  New user procedure 
     written in AREXX so this feature can be altered or disabled
   o Xenolink mail processor ensures that only specific systems can write
     mail in certain areas; Xenolink automatically sends a message to the
     system operator whenever a system attempts to illegally write mail
   o Packet level passwords used; Xenolink also protects against mail 
     packets using an incorrect packet password (this feature can be 
     disabled for individual nodes)
   o Xenolink FidoNet mailer logs illegal connection attempts, as well as 
     the password used by the remote system
   o Password protection of any menu command
   o Xenolink prevents co-Sysops from moving messages/files from areas in
     which they could not edit/delete them, into areas in which they can
   o Registration file and log files are locked while Xenolink is
     running, to hinder hackers
   o Built-in protection against the mail unpacking hack which afflicted 
     many Amiga BBS programs
   o Xenolink is shipped with Xenomiga Technology secured versions of UNARJ
     and PKAX
   o Protection against remote file transfers which attempt to send over
     complete device/path names or wildcard characters
   o Individual BBS lines can be configured to allow/prohibit
     logins/uploads/downloads from users at specified access levels/baud
     rates at specified times

SHAREWARE REGISTRATION COMES TO AUSTRALIA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Amiga users have often found it difficult to register the latest
and greatest program available for their computer. Many of the authors 
are in out of the way places, such as Germany, Scandinavia or the USA. 
As you can expect, many have been reluctent to send money, not knowing
whether they will get what they were after in return. This has now
changed..

Continental Drift BBS in Sydney, Australia has recently expanded its 
scope of Amiga support.

We have recently added a Shareware Registration section to the BBS, and
invite all Australian Amiga Users to come and have a look. 

Currently, the programs that can be registered at this site are:

    DASModPlayer       - A great Pro-Level ModPlayer by Pauli Porkka.
           
    MagicUserInterface - Allowing users to change the look and feel of
                         their programs        
    
    MagicWB            - Which has made the Amiga Workbench, one to be
                         envied. If you haven't seen this, you haven't 
                         seen anything! 


If you are interested in registering your copy of the above programs and
live in Australia or New Zealand, then drop us a line, preferably by

This is an emotional weekend; this is the last weekend that my 'pride
and joy' will sit alone on it's table.  Next weekend it will share the
space with a bright shiny new... PC-Clone.  We sit here alone, this last
Friday night, Ami- and I, and I think of all of the times that we have 
shared in the last 8 years.  It has certainly made me laugh enough, and 
cry enough, and sometimes pull at my hair, but we have been lots of 
places, the old girl and me.  

I remember when I brought it home the first time.  The monitor had a 
bashed in corner so it was quickly replaced with another, though this 
one's tube was cock-eyed a quarter-inch low on the right side, and is so
to this day.  Like a cleft chin or curled lip it just added more character
to this thing that has occupied so much of my time since then.  There was
the neat trap door, right there on the front for all to see, that actually
let me double the memory to a a wiz-bang 512K!  

The games were great, too.  Some of them are only a memory, though.
They don't like the new WorkBench, but that's OK, they were great while 
they lasted.  Then there were the pieces of software that actually let me
do something constructive.  Textcraft, then Textcraft Plus... there would
be no end in sight when I could play a game if I tired of writng a letter.
Now, if I'd had a proper Amiga printer driver back then that would really
have been something!  I could have printed it out, too! Then we added a 
second disk drive; that was really something. Talk about convenience!  
Then a modem; wow, so much software just a phone call around the continent
away.  Soon after it was time to add even more storage space so a hard 
drive was in order.  By that time the Amiga 1000 was peacefully at rest 
in the Commodore Home for the Orphaned so an A500 came home to us one day.
The Amiga 1000, but not the monitor with the lop-sided grin, was 
sacrificed to a long-necked kid who had a Vic-20 or C=64 or something and
to whom the heady brew of an Amiga 1000 was almost intoxicating.  I ran in
to the kid some time after that and found out that my old sweetheart had 
been in a couple of homes after his.  If it were ever to come around this 
way again there would be room here, kind of like a resting home or some 
such.  I still think about that trap door on the front.

The flood of cool software from Europe was followed soon after, though
PAL and NTSC was something that needed to be mastered with software hacks
and boot disks and a hard-to-find screw on the back of that silly monitor
and such.  Inconvenient, to say the least, and it started to add to the 
price we were beginning to pay for this great machine.  At least, we knew
it was great, even then.  Because we had paid the price of admission, the
price of purchase, to find out.  After all,Commodore tried to keep it a 
secret, didn't they? 

How many of us old-timers have heard  "Commodore Amiga?  That's like a 
Mac, isn't it?"  That used to irritate me then, but I understand now.
Later in the week Ami- will slide down the table to the end.  The
PC-Clone will occupy the place where I can look up and out the window to
see the kids playing.  When they come in and ask to play on the computer 
it will be the Amiga they are talking about, I know.  This new computer 
with the funny icons that Dad is so busy at won't scare them as much 
their father, though they'll be wondering why he's cursing the windows 
so much.  I'll keep the old VCR hooked up to the old crooked monitor, too.
That way I can watch TV while working at the new computer.  That's kind of
like multi-tasking, isn't it?

And my first piece of software?  Well, it will be 'Flight Simulator 5'.
Flight Simulator II was one of the first pieces of software I had on the
Amiga and I figure that it started me on an interesting journey, in more 
ways than one.  So, I will start out from the same place as I did before,
though this time in a different direction.  I will look over my shoulder 
many times at first, though it will become less and less as time goes by.

What a shame.

A. M. Robinson

@node P1-4 "Creating AmigaDOS Scripts"
@toc "menu"

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Creating AmigaDOS Scripts                          by David Tiberio %%
%%                                     dtiberio@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Creating AmigaDOS scripts is easier then you might think. Variables can 
be passed to scripts, files can be executed, and simple structures can be
created. Hopefully this will introduce you to some basic script abilities
without covering too much at the same time. And remember that the best 
way to learn is to practice programming your own.

An AmigaDOS script is basically a collection of AmigaDOS commands with 
the addition of variables, labels, and script-specific commands. One of 
the most important uses of scripts is to simplify repetitive tasks. For
example, I use my scripts almost exclusively with programs like 
Directory Opus which can feed filenames and parameters to my scripts.


- PARAMETER PASSING -

The first line of the script, when passing parameters, uses the ".key"
command, followed by a list of variables. This might look like this:

key parameter1, parameter2, parameter3

To access the parameters, place them within <> brackets, such as
<parameter1>. This will replace that variable with the item passed to the
script. The following script is used with EdPlayer to load music modules
from Directory Opus and then play them with a seperate gadget. Notice how
the infile parameter is used in "sys:c/telled JUKE <infile>". This uses
two programs. First, it runs Edplayer (by Ed Mackey) in the background, 
and then the Telled command that comes with Edplayer.

key infile/a

run sys:c/edplayer -h       ;run edplayer in the background
sys:c/telled DCOL 4
sys:c/telled PALM           ;set it for PAL mode
sys:c/telled AUTO 3
sys:c/telled JUKE <infile>  ;load the module passed to the script
sys:c/telled NEXT           ;start playing the music

The advantage of these types of scripts is that I can select hundreds of
music modules with one mouse click (in Directory Opus) and then select my
JUKE gadget which passes each file to the script, one at a time. In my
existing script, the last line is remarked out so that the music does not
play while loading in each new file. A seperate button is used.


- IF EXISTS -

Here is a line that is probably in your s:startup-sequence. In fact, don't
ever change it... the Installer expects it to be there, and may create a
new one if it is not found exactly as originally printed. This could cause
your s:user-startup sequence to be executed more than once during booting!

if exists s:user-startup    ;check to see if "s:user-startup" exists
  execute s:user-startup    ;execute "s:user-startup" is it exists
endif                       ;must end every IF statement

The IF command cannot be used from the command line. Otherwise, AmigaDOS
reports the error "Must be in a command file".


- REDIRECTION -

Many files do not detach from the command line. In the event that this
happens, execution of your script may halt. There are a few ways to avoid
this. One simple way is to redirect the output to the NIL or NULL device.
For example, try this command which displays a message to the command 
line.

echo "Hello, world!"

This will redirect the output using the > symbol:

echo "Hello, world!" >NIL:

The NIL: device should be available on all systems, while the NULL device
is availble in the public domain.


- DETACHING FROM THE COMMAND LINE -

You can detach commands from the shell by using the Run command or the
public domain Runback program. This should allow you to continue running
other programs in the same shell, or write scripts that do not halt when
each file is executed. In some cases, the shell window will still not be
able to close even though the command line is free.


- WAITING -

Another program that was commonly used on floppy based systems is the Wait
command. This causes the shell or script to wait for a specified number of
seconds, allowing other tasks to finish executing. It can also be used for
timing. For example, I did a demo at the World of Commodore in Toronto
which displayed various movies and companies that used the Amiga 
worldwide. In my demo, I used the Wait command to determine how long to 
wait before a music module would be played or before images would scroll 
up the screen. Unfortunately I only had 2 weeks notice, so it crashed 
every 90 minutes or so. :)

wait sec=10         ;waits for ten seconds

wait min=2          ;waits for 2 minutes

wait until 19:02    ;waits until 7:02pm before continuing.


As Edward Cayce might say, that is all for the present...

Ok, not really.  Well, sort of.  Let me explain.

What we here at Amiga Report want to do is this:  Every month, in much
the same fashion and style as Amiga Report, we will compile and send out
a "coverdisk" of sorts, featuring software selections from just about
anywhere we can get it: new FTP releases, old favorites, game demos,
or maybe even those "exclusives" that the big European magazines seem
to get.

It would be distributed along Internet and (hopefully) the same AR
FIDO distribution system we have going.  Since I'll be coordinating
it, the channels may not be identical to the AR magazine, but I'll do
my best to keep it faithful.

What is your role in all of this?  Well, to start with, tell me if you
think it is a good idea.  At the moment, I'll be using this E-mail
account to handle all mail.  On FIDO, Talk City is 1:115/372,0.  Let
me know if you're interested in getting on the mailing list.

I'm targeting late May to mid June as the first release.  Please get
the word out on this and respond.

(Incidentally, I'm more than willing to take submissions from all
interested...)

REVIEW

The plot behind this game is basically the same as every other
shoot'em up ever released.  There's a big nasty doing big nasty things and
it's your job to stop them.  In this case, the "nasty" in question is the
Chaos Engine, a powerful machine that's gone haywire and is generally
causing a nuisance to everyone.  When you boot up the game, you get a 
short animated intro explaining all this, and it's backed up by a full CD
soundtrack with narration.  Very nice indeed.  Now on to the game 
itself....

When you start the game, you can select between 1 or 2 player modes.
In the 1 player mode, the second character is controlled by the computer,
so you always play this game as a team even if no humans want to play with
you. :-) At this point, you can restore an old game by entering a 
password, or start a new game.  I'll talk about the password system a bit
later.  When you start a new game, you are presented with a character 
hiring screen.  You start off with a certain amount of money and must hire
a character to use. There are 6 characters in all, each having individual
strengths and weaknesses (strength, speed, etc.) and special abilities.  
With that done, it's off to take on the nasties.

The game is split into 4 worlds, each with 4 levels.  The action is
viewed from above and at an angle which lets you see the front of the
characters and nasties.  Your job is to kill as many nasties as possible 
and find your way to the exit of each level.  Before you can get out, 
though, you must activate "nodes" that are scattered around the levels.
These are tower-like things, and you activate them by just shooting them.
Once you've activated all the nodes, the exit (or exits) will open.  On 
most levels, there's actually more than one exit, and each one will cause
you to start from a different place on the next level.

When you shoot a nasty, it'll leave behind a coin which you can pick
up and add to your bank balance.  There are also coins laying around on 
the ground to be picked up.  Other things you can pick up include:  weapon
power-ups, keys that open doors and secret passages, food (for restoring
energy), extra lives, etc. etc.  There's more than one way of finishing 
most levels; in fact, there are often alternate routes which lead you to 
heaps of bonuses (and usually a swarm of nasties as well)! :-(

At the end of every 2 levels, you are taken to the Shop screen.  Here
you can buy all sorts of goodies to improve your characters' performance.
Things you can buy include: health, speed, weapon power-ups, lives, 
special weapons, and more.

The end of the last level takes you to a showdown with the Chaos
Engine. (Surprise, surprise. :-))

When your game ends, you are given a password which allows you to
restart at the beginning of the world that you were up to.  The way this
password works is bit different from other games, and it is great.  When 
you restart with a password, you start at the shop screen with the total 
amount of money that you had collected during the last game.  You can then
re-buy all your weapons etc. or choose to buy something else instead.  
This is great because you can try different tactics:  for instance, 
starting with heaps of lives, or starting with MEGA guns. :-)


DOCUMENTATION

The CD sleeve contains a brief introduction to the game.  Full
instructions are provided on the CD in English, French, German and 
Italian. They are very nicely presented as a series of pages which you 
flip through with the controller.


LIKES

Superb gameplay.  This game just feels great!  This is a game which
has been thoroughly play-tested, I simply cannot fault it in terms of
playability.

The password system is the best I've ever seen.

The 2 players' characters can walk through one another.  While this
isn't exactly realistic, it does make the game more playable.

The background graphics are excellent.  They have enough detail to
make them interesting, but not enough to make it difficult to see what's
going on.  The sprites are nice and colourful. The 6 player sprites look
great, they're really well drawn and each have their unique character.
Also, the introduction animation is quite good (although short).

The CD music tracks on the title and between-level screens are
fabulous.  Also, the CD sound effects during the game are very well done 
and add lot of atmosphere.  Music in the game itself is Amiga-based, but 
is still very atmospheric because it changes depending on where you are 
in the level.  For instance, as you approach the exit the music builds 
up to make it a bit more tense.  Sound effects are also excellent.  The
nasties have all sorts of weird (but appropriate) noises, and there's a 
bit of speech too.

Basically, the overall look and feel of this game is superb.


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

The action does slow down noticeably when there are a lot of objects
on screen.  This suggests to me that the programmers have just added the 
new AGA graphics to the code from the Amiga version, instead of re-writing
it for 68020/AGA.  I expect that adding some Fast RAM would help, as would
running the game on the A4000 CD32 add-on.  As neither of these exist 
right now, I can't try them, but I assume the game will make use of extra
speed because the Amiga version did.

The game doesn't use the full PAL screen.  PAL users can force it
into NTSC using the boot-menu though, and it then fills the screen.


BUGS

The game occasionally freezes for an instant.  I think it might be
when it's changing CD tracks.  This does not affect gameplay at all 
though: it's hardly noticeable.


VENDOR SUPPORT

An address is provided for support, but unfortunately not a phone
number.  I have not needed to contact them as yet.


WARRANTY

Unknown.


CONCLUSIONS

In my opinion, this is one of the CD32's best games to date.  I
already had the Amiga version, but for me the CD32 version was still a
must-have, even though it has no extra levels.  If you're a CD32 owner who
hasn't played the original Amiga version, then get this game!  If you had
the original Amiga version, then get this game anyway!  A lot of people 
whinge about CD32 games which are ports of Amiga titles, but I'm not 
complaining when the games are this good.  The Bitmap Brothers have taken
a classic Amiga game, enhanced the graphics/sound, and produced a classic
CD32 game.

I'd give it about 90%, and a bit more if it didn't slow down.

This review is freely distributable.  Just leave my name in :-)

Here's an update on what I've been pursuing for your reading enjoyment...

No word from the 24-bit video companies since I last told you about them.
Not a one.  Not a friendly lot, are they?

I'm working hard to establish some sort of CD32 review column for AR.
Since Liberation has been reviewed into the ground, it seems the column
will launch with the PD collection Lock 'N Load, from NorthWest Public
Domain.  (who had guessed I wanted one for free from the moment he
picked up the phone)

MONEY SAVING TIP FROM NW PUBLIC DOMAIN---

The CD32 has the infamous "AUX" port, which is really a keyboard port
suitable to the 4000 keyboard plug.  (I've heard of hacks to use modems
and disk drives on that port, but we're talking about the intended purpose,
here.)  Users of 2000 and 3000s, with big, unfriendly keyport ports instead
of the small, cute 4000 port had the option of buying the conversion piece
from Amigaman for $15.  The guy I spoke with at NW Public Domain told
me it was a $5 part at Radio Shack: an AT to PS/2 keyboard adapter.
Score one for the thrifty.

More CD32 news:  As early as mid next week, Paravision will send me
a "functional" SX-1 expansion for the CD32.  What do I mean by
"functional"?  I mean it won't have a case.  No problem, I simply won't
rest any drinks on top of it.  I'll throw on a disk drive, modem, printer,
ParNet when they send it to me, and maybe even a hard drive if I'm
lucky and tell you how it stacks up.  I'm looking forward to running
AGA demos.

Yet more CD32 news, again from the helpful guy at NW PD:  Frontier,
which a lot of people have questioned on CD32 since it doesn't seem
to have anything CDish to offer (no 650 megs of speech), was
apparently recompiled in 020 code for the CD32 version.  There you
have it, the exploitation of the technology to the fullest.

Commodore seems to still be alive.  This morning, though (Tuesday), the
stock did an odd thing.  It opened at 1 with a high of 1 and a low of 1  
and a close of 1.  500 shares traded hands.  Now, I'm no expert,but in  
watching the tables I know that on average about 40,000 shares of C=     
trade hands each day and that last week, that number was 210,000 in one  
day.  500's awfully low.  Maybe everyone is waiting for something.
I haven't heard any good rumors about it.  Or bad ones.

That should wrap it up for me this week...I'll have more meat for you
when next you read me.  Until then, keep...whatever you want warm.

Have any of you readers ever connected a CASIO Digital Diary to the
Amiga?  My CASIO is a 64KB SF-7500.  It has got some sort of serial
connector and I know that it is possible to purchase a PC-interface
which is quite expensive.

If you have a hint on how to build my own HW-interface and what software
to use then, please let me know (Internet adr above).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For those of you who do not have access to Mosaic, but still 
would like a nice interface to the World Wide Web (WWW) and 
all that it entails, should consider a program found on many 
UNIX sites called LYNX.

@{"Lynx" system "display.s 650 100 AR215_pic1.iff Lynx"} is a user-friendly hypertext interface on UNIX and VMS 
platforms (just type 'lynx' at the shell prompt). There's 
nothing that compares to the ability to run Mosaic, but Lynx 
comes close. It lets you use the cursor keys to browse around 
the WWW, you don't get the pictures and such, but you do get 
the information. Lynx was written by Lou Montulli, Michael 
Globe and Charles Rezac.

Why use Lynx to access the WWW? Because for you, the Amiga 
User, there's quite a bit of information available to you that 
you might not be able to find elsewhere ...and of course 
there's plenty of information that you WOULD find elsewhere, 
but the WWW makes getting that information easy.

There are quite a few places for information but most can be 
accessed through the "Commodore Amiga Information Resource" 
interface (for lack of a better word).

The @{"Commodore Amiga Information Resource" system "display.s 650 100 AR215_pic2.iff CAIR"} is a collection 
items interesting to the Amiga community. Tell Lynx or Mosaic to open 
the following URL:

http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/People/mjw/Computer/Amiga/AR/MainPage.html

It is maintained by Michael Witbrock (witbrock@cmu.edu). There he has 
information about the Amiga, and links to other places that support the 
Amiga in one way or the other. Like:

- @{"Amiga Report" system "display.s 650 100 AR215_pic3.iff AR_on_the_WWW"}
- GEnie's 5 minute news, and Viewport
- Access to Public Domain software and the Aminet
- The World-Wide Amiga BBS List
- Information on User Groups
- The Amiga FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
- David Tiberio's "Famous Amiga Uses"
- And more!


Now there is much more out there...but I'll leave you to find it 
...and I know that there's nothing like using Mosaic, but Lynx will 
get you "there"!

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA.  If you have an account on another 
Internet-connected system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet 
programs, from anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users 
can now Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

  Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files

   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES.

  35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.

  No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.

  Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.

  Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

  Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.

  And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

  UNIX "telnet" program from an account you may already
  have on an Internet-connected system.

+ $10 rate prevails at smaller US Cities
# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

/// BIX - Byte Information Exchange             Lots of information!
    -------------------------------



BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and enthusiasts.
While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is the place for 
knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  You're likely 
to find many others in similar situations who can offer advice, give 
technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.


                       *** FULL INTERNET ACCESS! ***

BIX features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription. 


                      ==============================
                      Rates and Connect Information:
                      ==============================


BIX membership costs $13 per month, plus connect time.  There are several 
different ways to connect:

SprintNet*              $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet:**               $3/hour evenings/weekends   $9/hour weekdays
(SprintNet and Tyment rates shown are for 48 contiguous US states only.)
                                                        
Tymnet Canada:          $4/hr eves/wkends           $9/hour weekdays
Tymnet Hawaii:          $10/hr eves/wkends          $20/hour weekdays   
Telnet(via Internet):   $1/hour, round the clock
Direct dial (Boston):   $2/hour, round the clock (up to 9600 bps)
 
 * SprintNet daytime hours are from 6am to 7pm, M-F, ET.
** Tymnet daytime hours are from 7am to 6pm, M-F, ET.

                20/20 PLAN OPTION (for USA-48 users only):

Volume users can choose the 20/20 Advantage Plan, which is $20 per month
and includes the first 20 hours of access by any combination of methods 
from the contiguous United States.  Additional use is $1.80 per hour 
(additional use for telnet access is $1 an hour).  The 20/20 Plan's cost is 
in addition to the $13 monthly fee.  


                           INTERNATIONAL USERS:

If you wish to connect internationally through Tymnet or SprintNet, 
please contact your local PTT.  BIX accepts prepaid international calls,
direct dial, or telnet connections.  In order to make a "collect" (not 
prepaid) call to BIX, your account must be verified before the charges 
are accepted.  When you complete the registration, we'll mail you a BIX
Membership Agreement by regular US Mail.  Whe you receive it, sign it 
and return it to us by mail.  When we receive it here, we'll authorize
your account to make reverse charged calls.

If you want to access BIX right away, contact your local PTT to set up a 
prepaid account.  You'll pay your local carrier for your calls to BIX in
advance, so there's no waiting period or verfication needed. Or, connect 
at BIX via telnet to x25.bix.com.

SprintNet international calls from most locations are $24 an hour.
Tymnet international charges vary, but are generally between $20-$30 an hour.


                           ====================
                           Billing Information: 
                           ====================

You can charge your monthly BIX membership fees to your Visa, 
Mastercard, Discover, or American Express card.

You may have your company invoiced for one or more BIX memberships with 
a BIX Corporate Account.

                            ===================
                            To Sign Up For BIX:
                            ===================

   Dial by modem 1-800-695-4882 or 617-491-5410 * 
   (use 8 data bits, no parity, full duplex)

   Press a few carriage returns until you see the Login:(enter "bix") 
   prompt, then type  bix

   At the Name? prompt, type bix.amrpt

* Users already on the internet can telnet to x25.bix.com instead.
  At the USERNAME: prompt enter bix, then bix.net at the Name? prompt.
  Once your account is registered, you can connect the same way, except
  at the Name? prompt you'll enter your BIXname and then your password.


Using the above procedure will allow users in the 48 contiguous United 
States to take advantage of our special "5 for $5" offer.  This offer 
lets you use up to 5 hours of evening/weekend time on BIX during the 
current calender month (whatever month you sign up in), for $5.  
Additional time is $1.80 per hour ($1 per hour for telnet).  At the end 
of the calender month, you will be placed into our standard rate plan, 
at $13 monthly plus connect charges.  You may also join the 20/20 Plan 
at this time.

If you have other questions, please contact BIX Member Services 
at (800) 695-4775; send a fax to BIX at (617) 491-6642; or send Internet
mail to info@bix.com.

TITLE

     ReqChange

VERSION

     3.1

AUTHOR

     Magnus Holmgren
     Internet: cmh@augs.se
     Fidonet:  2:204/404.6

DESCRIPTION

     ReqChange is a program that replaces the most common requesters
     in AmigaDOS with the ones available in ReqTools.  This program
     is similar to RTPatch (included in the ReqTools distribution),
     but offers a lot more, such as a builtin "AssignWedge", the
     ability to send a Rexx message when a requester appears and
     several other options (for each requester type).

NEW FEATURES

a CD-ROM drive running in a Novell network. The BBS software is a
Norwegian origin MBBS running in a DesqView windows.

We have now (26th March 1994) over 10000 files online (mostly for
the Commodore Amiga line of the personal computers.)

Every user has an access to download filelist (LAHOFIL.ZIP), list of the
Finnish 24-hour BBS's (BBSLIST.ZIP or BBSLIST.LHA) and every issue of
the Amiga Report Magazine (AR101.LHA-AR???.LHA) even on their first call.

The system has been running since 1989 and is sponsored by the local
telephone company, Vaasan Lnin Puhelin Oy.

BTW, LAHO stands for "LAtomeren Hyrylaiva Oy" = "Barnsea Steamship Co."
