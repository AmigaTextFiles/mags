What you'll need for these programs:

2.x or above for most of the utilities, but 1.3 or 2.0 for CLIanywhere.

A decent working knowledge of an un-LHA/LZH program and of the shell,
or a good directory utility.

A 68020 if you want to use Apple2000.

A bit of patience and the willingness to support the idea of the AR
Coverdisk...

Thanks.
