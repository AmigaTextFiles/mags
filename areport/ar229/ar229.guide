AR Mailing List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report
in UUENCODED form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put
on the list, send Email to listserv@bbs.xnet.com and in the body of
the message put:

ADD <mailaddress> armag

ie: ADD rniles@goofy.com armag

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an
intact copy. For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming
messages.

Joining the Amiga Report Coverdisk list is just as easy, but REQUIRES
that your mail site be able to handle messages in excess of 600k.
Place the following in the body of a message to listserv@bbs.xnet.com:

ADD <mailaddress> ardisk

ie: ADD rniles@goofy.com ardisk

Many thanks to X-Net Information Systems for setting this service up
for us!

** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!

                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
World Wide Web
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AR can also be read with Mosaic (in either AmigaGuide or html form).
Reading AmigaReport with Mosaic removes the necessity to download it.
It can also be read using programs found in UNIX sites such as LYNX.

Simply tell Mosaic to open the following URL:
http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/People/mjw/Computer/Amiga/AR/MainPage.html

Mosaic for the Amiga can be found on Aminet in directory comm/net, or
(using anonymous ftp) on max.physics.sunysb.edu

Mosaic for X, Macintosh(tm) and Microsoft Windows(tm) can be found on
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu


                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Aminet
~~~~~~
To get Amiga Report from Aminet, simply FTP to any Aminet site, CD
to docs/mags. All the back issues are located there as well.
(ftp.cdrom.com or ftp.wustl.edu are two sites)

UUEncoding/Decoding (thanks to Bob Tomasevich for the quick tutorial)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is uuencoding and uudecoding?
----------------------------------
uuencoding is converting a binary file into text (ASCII) which can be
sent through mail or Usenet.  uudecoding is reversing the process
(e.g. converting the file back to binary).


Why would I want to do this?
----------------------------
You have to send a binary file to a user who does not have
FTP access, or the user is too lazy to FTP the file.


What is the normal procedure?
-----------------------------
1. Convert the binary file into ASCII, using uuencode.
2. Send the file, through email, to the user.
3. The person on the receiving end gets the email, which may
   be split into parts.  If the email is split into parts, the
   parts must be combined, in the order received, into one file.
4. Receiving person converts the file back into binary, using uudecode.


What does a uuencoded file look like?
-------------------------------------
The start always has:

    begin 644 <encoded file's name>

So, for the file happy-happy-joy-joy.txt, it would look like:

    begin 644 happy-happy-joy-joy.txt

The encoded file begins right after:

M1TE&.#=A@`+@`9<````$`*QB15=2.+&/@R(Y)XM8.=J]H+*%7BL6#8]F6EP_]
M*$=E5"L?L-Z8A-:#60\@$,9P27-4-YB#;4HY)U!L9KZNE\O"O["#;8]82SDF>
M&[%J4FI',.&:E`48#="4@SE41M61<R`@%R$\,9:.?&!Z=NWM_\V';H-D1TI`=

.. more lines like the above ..

M>(`)N(`-^(`1.($5>($9N($=^($A.((E>((IN((M^((Q.(,U>(,YN(,]^(-!+
&V"\"`@`[&
``
end              <-- the end of the encoded file
size 151341      <-- size of the original file


So, how would I do this on the Amiga?
-------------------------------------
There are many uuencode/decode variants out there, but most usually
have kept the old UNIX command line, which can be confusing to novices,
or, require you to remove all mail headers and other, non-uuencoded text.

Luckily, Asher Feldman took the time to write UUxt.


What is UUxT?
-------------
It is a program which performs both the uuencode/decode operations in
one executable, AND, can also pack/unpack LhA archives.


Tell me more.
-------------
The UUxT archive contains UUxT, the CLI version, and UUxtGUI, the
Workbench interface.  I will give a short summary of how to use
both.  Detailed instructions are included in the UUxT archive.

  CLI Version:
  ------------

  Running UUxT without any options gives the following:

     UUxT Version 2.1a Copyright (c)1993 Asher Feldman
     USAGE: UUxT [option] [archive name] <LhA archive name> <file(s)>
     options: a - encode           l - LhAencode
              x - decode           u - LhAdecode

  showing the format of the command line and the valid options.


  Some example command lines:

  1. Normal encoding - UUxt a filename.uue filename-to-archive

  2. Normal decoding - UUxt x filename.uue

  3. LhA archiving and encoding -

            UUxT l filename.uue filename.lha file1 file2 ...

  4. Decoding and LhA unarchiving - UUxT u filename.uue

  For LhA encoding and decoding, you will need LhA by Stefan Boberg.


  Workbench (GUI) Version:
  ------------------------
  Below is a ASCII rendition of the UUxT-GUI window (from UUxtGUI doc):

  (1) Clicking on this brings up a requester to select the file you want
      to perform the operation shown in gadget (5).

  (2) You can manually type here the filename of the file affected by the
      operation indicated in gadget (5).

  (3) Used only for encoding, brings up a requester to select where the
      encoded file should go.  Selecting an existing file will cause the
      existing file to be replaced by the encoded file.  You can also use
      this requester to create directories.

  (4) You can manually type the filename of the file to be the encoded file.

  (5) The operation to perform on file shown in (2).  The operations are
      the four provided by UUxT (uuencode/uudecode/LhAEncode/LhADecode).

  (6) The name of the archive created with the LhAEncode option.  Ignored
      when any other operation is selected.

  (7) Does the encode/decode/LhAEncode/LhADecode and pops up a requester
      indicating if the operation was successful or not.


I need this!  Where can I get it?
---------------------------------
If you use the Internet from a local BBS, you may find it there.  If not
you can FTP it from wuarchive.wustl.edu, in the directory

                          pub/aminet/arc/UUxT.lha

It should also be on the Aminet mirrors.


Thanks for the explanation!  How can I reach you if I have questions?

Hello, everyone.  It's October...and the end, allegedly, is in sight.

Stop me if you've heard this before: The liquidator is supposed to present
his decision to the Bahamanian Supreme Court October 15 or earlier.  Of
course...that could mean Oct. 15, 1995 at this rate.  Who knows, though:
this has to end sooner or later.

A bit of housekeeping: Starting next issue, Amiga Report will be put into
a split form for E-mailing.  With the issues constantly above 200k, the
compressed and UUencoded form is simply too big for many mailing list
readers, so I've decided to make the change.  I will try to keep the
splits two-part only, so there is minimal effort to put them back
together.  Some mail readers and UUCP shells will do the combining
automatically.  Those who don't have this convenience can easily pull
the two halves together with a simple text editor (MEmacs will suffice).

I'd also like to answer a couple of charges against me.  One is that I am
geocentrically rooting for CEI to obtain Commodore.  The answer to that
is this: Amiga Report has been carrying a large amount of CEI info lately
because we can get it.  Commodore UK has been asked to appear for online
conferences and has been invited to call me, but no response yet.
As for Escom, the German company that recently submitted a bid: I am
trying to gather contact information for the company.

I am NOT trying to block news.

I've postponed some reviews this week, simply because the magazine was
filling up.  Next time around, we'll have reviews of GPFax, Guardian,
Cyber Sphere, MaxDOS, and Dave Haynie's new video (information is
listed in the Amiga News section of the magazine.)

Enjoy the issue.

Jason

P.S.  I've received a few requests for an article on AmiTCP.  Any takers?

A source inside Commodore Engineering at Norristown, PA has the following
information regarding David Pleasance's C= UK MBO bid:

Pleasance's financial backing comes from a Chinese company, known for
producing illegal Sega clones to be sold on the Chinese market.

The Chinese representatives were at the Norristown complex Sunday and
Monday.

Dan Stets, the Philadelphia-based newspaper reporter who has
been covering the Commodore situation, saw a group of Chinese he believed
to be affiliated with Commodore UK at the Norristown complex in late
September.

It is not known at this time what percentage of the bid such a company
would represent, nor how they affect Pleasance's much-publicized plans
of his version of the future of the Amiga.

On the 9th December, at the World of Amiga exhibition in London,
Almathera will hit the market with their remarkable new product
- Photogenics.

Photogenics combines the features of a powerful image manipulation package
with the ease-of-use and creative freedom of a traditional paint program.

You can load a variety of different images (JPEG, GIF, IFF, etc.) and save
them in different formats, but Photogenics is much more than just a simple
conversion system.  Artists will love the multiple built in natural brushes
(chalk, pencil, pastel, etc...), or you may perfer to retouch pictures
with the airbrush.  Through the variety of operations and the powerful
visual alpha channels, image manipulation has never been so enjoyable.

You can edit multiple images - each in its own resizable window.  The
realtime HAM-8 display gives you full-colour painting without needing a
24-bit graphics board.

Designed for graphics artists and serious painters, Photogenics gives a
professional working environment offering many features not even found on
PC or Mac packages.  The open-architecture design gives programmers the
freedom of writing their own loaders, savers or effects.

The minimum system is an Amiga 1200, floppy drive, Kickstart 3.0 or higher
and 2Mb Ram, (4Mb ram and hard drive recommended).

Photogenics will be available for sale at the World of Amiga Exhibition on
stand 27, or contact Almathera on +44 181-687 0040 (0181 687 0040 inside
the UK) or write to Almathera, Southerton House, Boundary Business Court,

Subject: Amiga report mail: GVP's Tech Support or the lack thereof

While on the subject of GVP, I would like the opportunity to tell a
little story.  Recently an external SCSI HD failed.  I attempted to
reformat the disk and block out the bad sectors by using GVP's
FastPrep.  A message came screaming though my display, which I
missed, and now the HD isn't recognized by the workbench, FastPrep
or ExpertPrep.

You must understand that I am no computer genius but can work on
systems at a basic level.  I am not a Human Computer Virus!

I decide this is a little beyond my capabilities and call GVP's tech
support.  Their Automated Tech Support doesn't address my problem and
fax a very brief and generic question to them thinking I would get
voice response back.  24 hours later I receive their response fax asking
for my mailing address.  I fax that.  24 hours later I receive another
response that primarily says "contact your dealer" and addresses an
anomaly inherent in SCSI devices.  This was my fault as I expected a
voice response and didn't go into much detail.  So I draft a detailed
letter and fax it.  It's now 48 hours later and I haven't heard a word.

I really expected to hear from their tech support people via phone, live
in an interactive format.  I may just be me, but I prefer dialogue
rather than listening to commands and pressing a number pad.  Monkeys
were treated this way in the early days of the space program, weren't
they?  And listening to the monotone voice without any interaction,
well I gave that up when I graduated school.

What is it I hope to accomplish by submitting this "view mail"?  Maybe
someone at GVP reads Amiga Report.  Maybe this will create a reaction
at their corporate level.  Maybe they will realize that sometimes
"right sizing" a company, cutting corners dropping services might foster
poor customer relations.  Poor customer relations will destroy a
company.  After all its the customer that makes a company, not a Board
of Directors.

Thanks for letting me use Amiga Report to vent my frustration.  All I
want is to get my HD back.

Signed,
No HD in Texas:)

Subject: Response to AR227
Date: Mon, 3 Oct 1994 02:19:53 -0600 (MDT)

In response to the concerns put forward by Hans Bergengren in AR227:

   DMA CONTENTION

Although the Amiga 3000/4000 have primitive "time-share" logic to prevent
things such are serial overruns when used with Zorro III cards, the A2000
and A3000/4000 with Z2 cards does not.

To clairify, the Amiga 2000 serial port is especially intolerent of DMA
host adapters.  There is a very specific moment that the serial port must
fetch the incoming data.  The Zorro II bus can very quickly saturate with a
fast hard drive and controller causing the CPU to miss this window of
opportunity. There isn't much that can be done (other than a solution
similar to GVPPatch) to remedy this problem with the internal port.

The source I drew upon for my conclusions is based on information
posted by Dave Haynie on Wednesday, 24 Aug 1994 18:45:07 GMT

Of course, you compromise performance in either case; one hard disk
performance, the other interrupt performance. You'll find much the
same case on the FastLane Z3 card when running with a very fast drive
using the "Rev I Buster" workaround. With the workaround in place, you
have the drive on the controller for extended periods of time, which
gives you the fastest transfers on the A4000, but can sacrifice
interrupt performance.

>(The A3000 has logic that supposedly causes the bus to "time share"
>with other things demanding it.

Unfortunately that's only with Zorro III devices.  The bus controller can
start and stop Zorro III DMA devices on a cycle-by-cycle basis, so it can
attempt to schedule them.  It's still rather primitive on the A3000/A4000,
but it does help.  On Zorro II, once a bus master has the bus, there's
nothing the controller can do to stop it, other than force an error (which
would crash the card or at least damage most Zorro II bus transfers)."

>With this facility I can STILL cause occaisional glitches on the

It needs some kind of bus fairness mechanism, like the A4091 has (by
virtue of the 53C710). The only solution on Zorro II is to build a
controller which will back off at intervals. Unfortunately, that's
almost always an overall performance hit, since there's no way to tell
if anything actually wants to use the bus. This isn't strictly a Zorro
III problem, it's been a problem with all 680x0 CPUs (or buses based
on their bus protocol, like the Zorro II bus or A3000/A4000 local bus)
up until the '040, which can actually indicate when it wants the bus.
--- End included text ---

The main point is that although the 68040 speed will allow for much higher
transfer rates for the internal port (I reliably get 115,200 bps), it will
not work well when the on-board GVP SCSI controller is accessed and the
solution GVP provides did not work in my machine.  Since the review was
published, I've been contacted by a number of other G-Force owners who are
experiencing the same problems with the GVP serial port and I'm still
looking for a solution.

The bottom line is that the serial port problems are not the fault of GVP.
I'm sure they did the best they could to make a fast, yet cooperative, DMA
host adapter.

(In practice, applying GVP Patch to the G-Force 040 causes a hard drive
that typically does 1.8MB/sec to 800KB/sec.  That's about 40 times the
speed of a typical floppy read on the same system, and faster than many
hard drives hooked up to an unaccelerated machine.)

   SCSI-BUS INTERFACE CONTROLLERS

GVP Series II controllers do NOT and have NEVER used the same bus interface
as an A3000/A2091.  GVP uses the AMD AM33C93A-16JC, while the Amiga 3000
and A2091 use a Western Digital WD33C93A-00-04.  The Western Digital
upgrade to a 00-08 fixes bugs in the revision -04 chip.  The SCSI command
set is implemented through the device driver.  GVP's driver supports the
SCSI-2 command set and Commodore's scsi.device does not.

The word "PROTO" printed on the Western Digital chip merely means the chip
is from the first production run (according to Western Digital).
A WD33C93A-00-04 is the same as WD33C93A-00-04 PROTO,
while a WD33C93A-00-08 is the same as a WD33C93A-00-08 PROTO.

The GVP chip does not need to be replaced as it does not share those
problems that A3000/A2091 users so often experience with CD-ROM drives.

The A3000T had a WD33C93A-00-08 when I purchased it, both A3000's I tested
the drive on were upgraded to -08 chips.  Again, the chip does not
automatically make the driver support the SCSI-2 command set.

Dave Haynie pointed out what may be part of the problem.  The IBM SCSI-2
drive I tested seems to use something called "FPT" (Forced Perfect
Termination).  It was not compatible with any controller I tried - except
the GVP.  It is not billed as a SCSI-1/SCSI-2 drive, so after much testing
I gave up on it with SCSI-1 controllers.

The only difference I could find with this drive other than the hardware is
that it reports a response data format of SCSI-2, while the SCSI-1/SCSI-2
drives I tested all reported a CCS (Common Command Set) response format.

The fact that the GVP controller handles it just fine when other fail is
still the point of the evaluation.  The question of any review is "what
does it do for me?" In this case, for whatever reason, the G-Force works
with a wider range of drives.

   EXPERT PREP

I have also tried HDToolBox with my GVP controllers, but it is typically
unwise to use software from other controllers because they often set
options specific to the controller and companies do sometimes implement
ambiguous options differently.

Personally I like RDPrep, but I set up my drives with ExpertPrep (2.5)
because it tends to enjoy setting it up in a specific logical
configuration.  Also, the GVP driver will not mount RESERVED partitions
regardless of the prep software used.  That is my major complaint.

When purchasing a $1,200 product, I don't feel that the purchaser should
have to go find programs to replace the included ones.  When a 33MHz 68040
based Macintosh Quadra costs the same as a G-Force 040/33 for an Amiga
2000, I expect benefits including solid, well-written, complete programs.
What's included with the G-Force looks like a good start, but it seems
almost as if GVP took the programmers off the job once they just got it
working.  The software has a good foundation, it just doesn't seem
polished.

   68EC0x0 PROCESSORS

There can only be two types of 68EC030's.  Those that have the MMU totally
and permanently disabled, and those that have been remarked to fulfill a
larger order than Motorola could provide at the time.  If your chip has a
plastic package, the MMU is disabled and cannot be activated.

Before a 68030 goes through testing, it is decided whether or not it will
be a 68EC030 or a full 68030.  If it is going to be a 68EC030, the MMUDIS
pin is permanently grounded, effectively disabling the MMU without removing
it from the mask.  This insures a lower power consumption (CMOS logic
doesn't consume power when it's not changing states), and since there is
less heat generated, it can be put into a plastic package without the
possibility of melting.

So technically, the MMU is in the "mask" of ALL 68030's, but there is no
software that can magically "unground" the MMUDIS pin, causing the MMU to
function.  Since the registers are still there, some software will
erroneously report that an MMU is present and try to use it.

The transparent translation registers _still exist_, though they are called
access control registers, which greatly reduce the need for testing.

The 68LC040 has the FPU physically removed from the mask resulting in a
smaller die and less time needed for testing.  The 68EC040 is an even lower
cost version that disables both MMU's and the FPU _from the mask_.

Thanks to Skipper Smith of Motorola Technical Training for this information.
[For more information, see: Amazing Computing, Volume 8 Number 8, page 91]

The main points are:
1) Motorola does not ship "failed" 68030's as 68EC030's.
2) The terminology with regard to an MMU not being used and an MMU not
   active or present in the chip is confusing, causing a lot of unnecessary
   phone calls to GVP (and others) and probably led to fax-only style
   support.

I find it hard to believe that the MMU will work with the MMUDIS pin
grounded.  Perhaps you have software that just deals with the registers
hence thinks and acts as if an MMU is present.

Date: Sat, 8 Oct 1994 05:23:48 +0100 (MET)
Concerning: AR #228, Reader Mail - wishes for new Amigas.

My thoughts on the new Amigas CPU:

First of all, I don't like the idea of a RISC processor in the new Amigas. I
have to work with those PowerPC Macintosh (too bad to work with anything other
than Amiga, but with 040 Macs you didn't have to go nuts) as a programmer and I
do not like the mass of incompatibilities produced by the new processor
technology.
Most important, with Apple being unable to port their operating system to
native RISC code, it is al slow as a 030 mac. And that does not seem to be due
to a bad emulation for 680x0 code - the emulation is real good, much more
stable than the OS.
I would not want to spend lots of money for an Amiga that is much slower than
A4000/40. I certailnly would not buy such a system. And I don't expect Amiga
Int. to get all the OS running on RISC code in time, let alone all the
commodities ... one got accustomed to - not if they have to write a real good
68040 emulator for the new machine, too. And anything else, which would render
the new Amiga  incompatible with previous ones, would be suicide.
I have another more personal point in favor of 060 processors: I like to
program in assembler. The motorola one is quite good. And did you ever try to
program RISC assembler ? It's almost as sick as intel one...

Of course I know that you have to go with the time - and CISC processors seem
to come to an end - but they did not reach it yet ! The 060 is a fine machine
and would be perfect for the near future. You can clearly see how many
customers Apple scared by it's too-fast switch to the PowerPC and how much OS
engineering could not be done because they set themselves too tight deadlines.
(e.g. they still didn't implement preemtive multitasking :(
RISC may be the choice of the future, but don't be too quick. It's no good to
re-start the Amiga with a premature OS, it would take much longer to rewrite
all and everything for an integrated concept with a new processor than building
a good CISC computer so Amiga-owners can stop buying PCs and start to see a
perspective in the Amiga again.

My thoughts on AAA / 3D RISC.
are similar. I really don't believe Mr Pleasant if he says AAA OS
implementation would last 18 month whereas the implementation of a completely
new system could be done in 6. There has to be a miscalculation !
But if AAA is really as old stuff as stated (e.g. not much ahead of AGA), most
impotant if the Customchip data throughput is not MUCH higher they should
really can it. There would be no point making a computer which could not be
competitive to PCI in terms of BUS performance (or contain PCI :) and to the
cheap PC sound/gfx cards in terms of custom chip speed/ 16bit audio/ large
Chip ram ...

But after all, a new Amiga with only the name would be nonsense too ! There has
to be Amiga OS on it (even if it could take some stylish improvement -> X11)
and there have to run Amiga programs on it. OK, I'll give the old games a go,
but most of the applications should run on it !

And I would be willing to spend real money on a "professional" Amiga - not too
much a low end machine. If you see the prices of other non-IBM-compatible
which sell for over 6000 DM ($3.900) a price similar to this for a top notch
Amiga would be acceptable.


-   That's quite a letter.  I'll let it stand on its own.  -Jason

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This time yours truly is going to report from the Photokina expo that
happened September 22-27 in Cologne / Germany.  The Photokina is probably the
largest consumer photography/video/film expo in the world.

There are two parts to the photokina, one covering consumer oriented
photographic products (ranging from frames for pictures to genlocks) and a
pro part, covering everything from lighting equipment to video beamers and
SGI's.

I was mainly interested in the pro video stuff, especially the M-JPEG
boards for the Amiga (If you read my previous article on that subject then
you might have noticed that this subject fascinates me.  May be its because
I want to buy one of those suckers in the near future ;-).

Let's do a quick rundown of the products on the show.

MacroSystems
------------

They were showing of their new VLab-Motion board, on an A4000 with a 40Mhz
Warp Engine, and a Retina BLT ZIII board.  Unforunately their demo was,
frankly, crap.  They only had a 260 MB Partition reserved for the
VLab-Motion, no demo Videos/Animations on that partition and the Toccata
audio board wasn't installed either.  Instead they grabbed some live video
from a cheap HI-8 camcorder and played around with their editing software
(which is very nice BTW, very similar to Adobe Premiere for Mac's/PC's).

The MS rep was extremely boring (the kind of guy that would sell you his
grand ma, you know the type), and just talked to much instead of showing
off the board.  So there is now way I could compare the image quality to
the DSP PAR that was also exhibited at the same booth (by a different
company).

MS was also demoing Elastic Reality for PC's, but it didn't impress me too
much, the PC kept crashing all the time ;-))

dcp
---

was the other company at that booth, they distribute SGI and Amiga
software, mainly for the video / interactive market.  They were demoing
Lightwave 3.5 PAL, the DSP PAR and Elastic Reality for SGI's.  I don't
think I need to tell you anything about these great products.

BTW:  They are selling A4000's with the DSP PAR board as an alternative to
single frame recording, 'tis funny though that they don't mention the name
"Amiga"...

on to the next one:

ProDad
------

were showing all their software, including an early beta of their video
editing program CAVIN.  It sounds quite promising (I couldn't see much of
it, it kept crashing ...).

It supports all kinds of hardware (Control-L, LANC, PANASONIC-EDIT, RS 232
and RS 422 protocolls) and timecode (VITC, TCTC, RAPID).  You can also use
infrared signals for older hardware.

CAVIN hast timelines for A & B VCR's, graphics / animation, hardware (i.e.
framegrabber, M-JPEG boards, cd-player), audio (Amiga, audio boards or
external). So you can use it as a complette A/B editing system.

You can of course configure CAVIN to work in conjunction with other Pro Dad
products, such as clariSSA, Monument Titler and Adorage.

ProDad has also upgraded older products.  Adorage 2.5 now supports a
transparent colour 0, image conversion and loading of different image types
(i.e.  TIFF, PCX) and has some new 3D effects.

There are two new modules for clariSSA, the Loaderpackage allows you to
import new image formats (i.e.  GIF, JPEG, PCX), while the "motion sound"
add on allows you to add samples to your SSA animations.

electronic-design
-----------------

were at the same booth as ProDad.  They demoed their new genlocks (mainly
the Neptun), and their Framegrabber / Framebuffer combo FrameMachine.

The Neptun looks very nice.  It is the only "low cost" genlock I know of
that allows you to use a simple kind of alpha channel.  You can define one
colour as beeing semi-transparent, while the others behave as normal.  The
Neptun is also fully software controlable (Very nice if you use SCALA for
video editing).

Oh, and Tobias Richter was there (known for his amazing Star Trek / Star
Wars animations), showing off some of his work.  It is amazing what this
guy can do using a raytracer (Reflections) and a DCTV.

after a long day and blisters on my feet...
-------------------------------------------

Well, that is about it Amiga wise.  electronic design was also showing the
genlocks at the consumer part of the show, but you could also find lot's of
PC video solutions there as well (such as FAST's Video Machine).

Some PC People got very excited at Caligari Broadcast (for Windows), which
has added features (and decreased performance).  SGI were there too,
showing all kinds of media solutions (I hate SGI's, they always make me
drool, yeuch, what a mess...).

We got bored at the fair after 6 hours, so we went to Cologne to have a
beer (Koelsch) and enjoy what is left of summer.  Nice city, go there if
you're in the area !

This is all for today, next is a review of GVP's TBC Plus (in an A2000,
unaccelerated :-(), and hopefully soon the Cyberstorm.

Cheers !

%% Why?                                             By: Maxwell Daymon  %%
%% A dark view...                                   mdaymon@rmii.com    %%

                                     Why?

Commodore is all but dead.  The future of Amiga is in the hands of
liquidators who have a responsibility to creditors who alledgedly couldn't
care less what happens, as long as they get their money.  Further, the
industry is not stopping to take notice - the Amiga isn't going to be the
"future" forever.  So why do people still cling to the Amiga?

Obviously some have stopped and are (happily?) computing on some other
platform.  After all, a computer is a computer.  Others are holding on to a
large investment of time, money, or both.  A number of users are simply
familiar with the system and don't want to switch for that reason alone.
After all, isn't it hard enough to learn one OS?  There are also those who
subscribe to the old principle of "don't fix what's not broken" and plan on
using their Amigas until they literally break down.

Many look beyond the superficial and practical reasoning.  Especially those
who see the Amiga as more than "just" a computer.  In all honesty, AmigaOS,
Macintosh System X, and OS/2 are the three last choices the general public has
in terms of an operating system, that number is about to be reduced to two.
There's always the various flavors of UN*X for the so called techno-gods, but
they certainly aren't for the casual user and it's not the kind of OS you'd
want to recommend to Aunt Matilda and the kids.

These are the people who don't like the idea of getting a book of what you are
allowed to use in your programs to avoid litigation for using so-called
"industry trade secrets." These are the people who can't help but to notice
that there is one company that has a huge number of people convinced that an
integral part of all computers is DOS (*MS* DOS, that is) and they not only
produce the operating system, but many of the applications and development
tools FOR that operating system.  Isn't it obvious that when one company
controls the cars you drive, the roads you drive on, and the fuel you put into
your car, you don't have quite as much freedom as you thought?

To paraphrase Henry Ford, "You can have any operating system you like, as long
as it's made by Microsoft."

REVIEW

        I've checked out many Amiga Guide makers, but this one is the best.
        It has an easy to use GUI along with many usefull features.  Perfect
        for beginner or advanced user.  Has support for many of WB 3.0 features
        and also has ARexx support.  Allows you to start right out and go make
        an Amiga Guide.  So if you do alot or just a little Amiga Guide creation
        this is a must.  And with registration price as reasonable for such a
        good program it is worth it.

        Documentation is in Amiga Guide format. Layed out well for the beginner
        or experienced Amiga user.

LIKES

        The easy to use GUI interface.

DISLIKES

        No real dislikes on this program.

BUGS

        No bugs found.

CONCLUSIONS

        This program is excellent and is a must addition to any WB.
        I give it 5 stars out of 5.  *****

[Editor's note: Mr. Solmaz went to quite extensive lengths to reach me
with his article.  I have decided to print it because opinions on the
future are relevant and important to the entire community.  However,
some of the information within is based on conjecture, and should not be
considered to be set in stone.]

First hi to everyone who owns an Amiga !

I would complain, that everyone?, wants an Amiga 5000/RISC?/AAA?
under $1400! Guys where are you living ? I visited a German Computer Shop
called Vobis (They discount low cost PCs and also now Macintoshs)
The Price for an PowerPC 8100/80 is 12.000 DM (nearly $6.900)

The 8100/80 PowerMac has a PPC601, 80 MHz !
a 500Meg Hard drive,
a Video-Adapter with 2MB VRAM
 (That's REAL Expensive, The AAA Chipset would also use it,
 if it ever comes out to public),
TWO Onboard SCSI Host adapters
 (one with Standard SCSI-2, the other with Support for FastSCSI-2),
16 Meg Ram,
 (I think they are using low cost 70ns Simms)
Apple Talk
 (Apple proprietary Network Protocol)
Ethnernet
 (The Worldwide Used Network Protocol)

And now we make a comparison:
An Amiga 5000/RISC/AAA? (what I like to see)
with 4MB VRam,
 (Don't forget with the AAA Chipset you need a minimum of 4MB Chip ram,
  OR can stick on your AGA/ECS Machine)
a PPC604 80MHz or 100MHz Processor
 (These Machine must be comparable against Pentiums and PowerPC`s)
a FastSCSI-2 Host adapter on Board
 I need that for my soon? Micropolis 2.4 Gig HD)
at Minimum 16 MB Memory on Board
 I am going with my A3000 with 14MB Ram, many times out of memory,
 and don't forget that Risc Code is 50%-80% longer then normal
 CISC Code (68030/040/060/486/Pentium
(I (myself) would put then there for sure 32 MB Ram.
Also I would like to see Ethernet on Board
 (Its a must today, every better class PC and the Risc based
 Macintoshs/Quadras have that.
 I personally would like see FAST ethernet with a Transfer Rate of 10Megs,
 because its an ISO standard and it would be more used
 then FDDI in the Future)
540 Meg Hard drive (Quantum preferred, NOT SEAGATE)
 (Don't forget the RISC native Software is 50%-80% longer then normal
 CISC Code, also there is a need for big storage because 24 Bit Pictures,
 Animations and 16 Bit sound eats lot of Memory)
DSP would be recommended, but its not important to have one !
 (Anyway, most of the DSP Software Support is done, and there is also
 1 Program which (also which I only know) supports the DSP Card
 (then maybe Onboard) ImageFX 2.0 !
 You can find in ImageFX2.0 such strings like "vcas.library", "dsp3210.device"
 ALSO a DSP can play a ROLE of 3D Chip !No Problem at all !

 Here is a List of the possibilities of AT&T DSP3210
              Hardware:
              - 32-bit floating point arithmetic
              - 32-bit addressing
              - large 8K on-chip cache 0 wait
              - 33Mflops of power
              - shared bus with Motorola CPU
              - Serial I/O with DMA 24 Mbits/sec
              - Barrel shifter
              - mu-law & A-law encoding
              - Bit I/O general purpose 8-bit I/O port

              it can emulate:
              - V32 / V22bis MNP5 / V29 G3 fax / modem emulation with fallback
              - subband coder
              - G.722 7khz speech coder (1000% better than SAY)
              - DTMF generator/decoder
              - JPEG still/ MPEG encode/decode
              - Call progress detector
              - Non integer sample rate converter
              - delta-spectrum feature extractor
              - text to phones LPC, LPC to speach
              - speech recognizer
              - talker verification
              - 3d GFX library
              - MIDI music synth with EMU proteus soundlibs
              - perceptual image coder
              - perceptual audio coder
 There are many things which you CANT do with a 3D Risc Chip, but with a DSP !!
 You can also hold more then 1 DSP in the System !The Commodore DSP Card
 had two 66MHZ AT&T 3210DSP`s !Also the DSP Software support this!

-4 PCI Slots (In one slot is the MPC604 Card)
-5 Zorro III Slots,

Good Design and good Quality (ALSO IMPORTANT) of the Case, Keyboard,
Mouse,.. Parts!
 (I like the A3000 Mouse, and also A3000 Keyboards are excellent, some A4000`s
 keyboards and all A600/A1200 Keyboard are like typing on a 1940`s Typewriter
 or maybe worse, in short words, its SH*T.)

And a good price for this Setup would be around $4000-$5000! Thats a good
price for what you get !And not terrible expensive like Apple!

the AAA Low End Machines (comparable to the PowerMac6100/60)
must at start $2000 (3400 DM) !
System must be:
 Processor MPC603+, 80 MHZ
 2 MB Vram,
 270 Meg HD (Quantum preferred)
 8 MB Ram
 3 PCI Slots
 1 or 2 Zorro III Slots !

And don't forget:  if a Computer costs much, then there would be software
which also costs much.  And generally this kind of Software is much more
powerful then low cost software (not all the time, but most times)
(Show at the Mac`s)

And what me make ANGRY, are people want to see all this for $1200.
That's _NOT_ Possible.

If you have No Money get another Hobby or stuck on
your CD32/A1200/A600/Low Cost IDE PCs/Nintendos/ Kids' Computers?.
Without such kind of People, the Amiga would have be a BETTER Status in the
Computer world, and not like a TOY-Machine.
(except the some TV Stations which are some Amigas using)

I would like to see that the Amiga get a High Class Status like a Macintosh or
like in the 1986.
At this time People said "WOW" to my A1000, and at this
time it was REAL expensive, and that was Good so, and today I will get
pissed of, if I go to a Computer Shop and tell them that I have an Amiga,
and then the Dealer would be say to me:  Get a professional Computer, a PC
or a Macintosh! or a better Game Machine like SNES & 3DO !

Anyway one day I said to one Dealer, that I have an Unix Clone (You can say that
on a Amiga with a MMU (No A1200/A4000/EC030 hehe) without any Problems
with
NETBSD, which is a Common Unix, and don't forget that the Amiga Operating
System has some UNIX like functions)
with a resolution of 1024*800, and its Motorola based, has 400 megs SCSI-2
Hard drive.
And his Comment was: "WOW, Cool Machine, How much did you pay for it ?"
Then I replied:  "More than a 486 Class Computer." (That's right, I payed for every
4 Meg in my A3000 440 DM=$290! :-) )

Another Important Thing is:  Commodore has designed their own Chips,
designing Amiga Hardware is not cheap like designing PC or Macintosh Hardware.
Do you every heard that Compaq, Digital, The Taiwan PC Clone Makers?,
uses Custom Chips (designed by themselves) ?
(The VL/PCI/ISA Chipsets are designed not by the common PC Makers, its
designed by Intel, OMTI, and 3 or 4 others)

The Macintoshs (the newer ones) have only 3 Custom Chips, 1 for
SCSI DMA (only in the PowerMacs, the older ones uses PIO), 1 for Sound,
1 the NuBus Slots.  Thats all !

My Amiga 3000 has 8 Custom Chips:  Fat Agnus, Paula, ECS Denise, DMAC, Ramsey,
Fat Gary,
Fat Buster, Amber, and the two CIA`s !

A Triple A System would have these Chips:  Monica, Andrea, Linda, Mary,
PCI -> ZorroIII Bridge , Some kind of Ramses & DMac & Gary!

(Only the Chips:  Monika, Andrea, Linda, Mary have a 700.000 Transistors,
a AGA Based System has only 80.000 Transistors)

That's costs a Hell of a lot to develop & produce such a Custom Chip Set!


Also designing the System Operating software is a hell of work!
Microsoft have been trying to design good System Operating software since 1980, but
until now, they have not succeeded!  PC Clone Makers don`t invest Money
to develop Operating System, they only pay ? (or better) the customer pay
for a license to use MS-DOS&Windows!  And in this World are aprox. 80 Million
PC`s.  And every PC had a MS DOS License!  License costs around 50 Dollar !
$60 * 80 Million Licenses = $4.000.000.000!
This is 4 Billion Dollar !
(That's only with the Operating System, not to forget to mention the
Microsoft Software Productivity? Software like Winword, Excel)

If the New Amiga Company has success, then they can also do a little challenge
with the AmigaOS against Microsoft WindowsNT and port the AmigaOS to the
PreP Platform.
And then they will get also there a new UserBase and some Money (that's important)
If we say the OEM license costs about $80 and then they sell it over, and get
some money (Show the Example with Microsoft above).
With the superior AmigaOS would that be not a big problem, except
the marketing!


Here is a List of Directions of the next Apple OS, System8.0 (Maybe some
Commodore People (Also Alex Amor?, David Pleasance?,) read this!)


System8.0 (Codename Copland) will come up in the fall of 1995 !
~~~~~~~~~
-OpenDoc Support (Would like to see that in future Revisions in the AmigaOS,

-Needs at minimum a 68030 with MMU or a PowerPC !
(Apple only use only real 68030 with MMU!not such Shit like 68030EC like
C= in the A4000/030, (This Type Guys can buy the Cyberstorm, WarpEngine,
GForce
Accelerator Card hehe))

-Preemptive Multitasking for new Programs, cooperative Multitasking for the
 old Programs (The Amiga has Preemptive Multitasking since the beginning!)

-Memory protection only for new Programs !

-Concurrent IO, Access to multiple Peripherals !

-Changed Human Interface (Would be also good for the Amiga, something like
                          MUI or a HUMAN Interface in the SCALA Design
                          then every Idiot can use the Amiga. I know many
                          of them!)

-Filenames could be 48 Chars long and can use UNIcode Characters!
                      (The Limit on the Amiga is 30 chars, 64 Chars would be ok!)

-Volume Limit is by 256 Terabyte (=262144 GByte)
 and you can have a maximum of 65536 Files on a volume

(On Amiga there is a Volume limit at 4 Gigabytes and HDToolbox plays crazy
if you had more then 2 Gigs! Commodore give not any warranty for Drives bigger
then 2 Gigs :( !

I don't know if there is a File Limitation on the Amiga, I have on my Amiga
aprox 14000 Files!, if I had my 2.4 Gig Hard drive then I could test it out :-) )


System9.0 (Codename Gershwin) will come up in the fall of 1996 !
~~~~~~~~~
-Mircokernal Architecture
(The AmigaOS is now nearer to Mircokernal Architecture then any other OS,
except MACH (NextStep is based on Mach), only Mircokernal Architectures can
use the advantages of Multiple Processor Systems)

-Also preemptive Multitasking for the old (System7.x Programs)
(See my comment above, and I would like to see how they will implement it)
-Full Memory protection (for old and new Programs)

-3D Graphic Software Engine !
(that means you can play something like doom in the Desktop, and automatically
a 3D Engine Chip would supported, would be a GREAT Idea for the AMIGA?-3D
RISC
Chip (On this Chip is David Pleasance and Alex Amor talking about)

-Volume Limit is now by 8 ExaByte (=8192 TeraByte=8388608 GigaByte)
File Limit is now at 4294967296 (=4 Billion!!!) Files on one Partition!


In Generally these Steps must also the AmigaOS Follow! I know some People,
who have Problems with the Filesystem on their Hard drive bigger then
2 Gigabytes (Some Days ago somebody left a message on the German UseNet
(de.comp.sys.amiga.tech) that he has a 9 GB Harddisk,
but he cant use all the storage, he is "only" able access 4 Gig from
his 9 Gig Harddisk!)


My hardware setups are:
1xA3000 (14 MB Ram, 400 MB Harddrive, 4 Greytone A2024 Monitor, CBM
2060 Arcnet)
and 3xA1000
(one with 68030, 10.5 MB, 200 Meg Harddrive, CBM Arcnet Card) and the
2nd A1000 has 2.5 Meg and a Sidecar!
Besides that, I have 2 USRobotics DSTs, they costs me more then todays 486`s!

(But anyway I'm proud NOT to HAVE a PC, except the Sidecar, its has a 4.77MHZ
8088! but the Case looks NICE! :-) )

And at least I am 19 years young, NOT Working, I am going to school, for the
next 1.7 Years!
(I work in my holidays, but that's another story)
Soon I will await my 2.4 Gig Harddrive, then I will open perhaps an Amiga
Bulletin Board !

All Prices are German prices! Not US Prices! It seems that in Germany
some things costs more! Now everyone think we, Germans?, are rich Guys !

If you have comments on this Article, then you can me send a mail,
but it would be better if you sent it to Amiga Report Stuff, so
everybody can read it.

Message from System Manager...

Our FORMAL session is now started.

[Valorie]* We welcome you to the BIX formal CBIX session with our special
[Valorie]* guest Alex Amor of Creative Equipment, International. Our thanks
[Valorie]* go to the following individuals for helping to set up this session:
[Valorie]*      For the suggestion:
[Valorie]*      Chrisopher Aldi, President, Phantom Development Co.
[Valorie]*      John Basile, V.P. for Operations, Phantom Development Co.
[Valorie]*      For the 'leg-work':
[Valorie]*      Jason Compton, Editor in Chief, Amiga Report
[Valorie]* Thanks also to our Exchange Editor, Joanne Dow and the moderators
[Valorie]* of the Amiga Exchange for their behind the scenes work to make
[Valorie]* this evening possible.
[Valorie]* If you are not familiar with CBIX commands please take a moment
[Valorie]* to scan them using the /help command.
[Valorie]* Also, please be aware that everything typed on channel 1 is
[Valorie]* being recorded for the transcript of this evening's session.
[Valorie]* If you wish to chat with other participants as well as listen
[Valorie]* to our guest speaker please move to another channel (>30)
[Valorie]* and then monitor channel 1.
[Valorie]* Since this is a formal session, we ask that participants
[Valorie]* please refrain from making any comments on channel 1 --
[Valorie]* that channel is reserved for the Chairperson and our guest.
[Valorie]* Failure to abide by this request will result in ejection
[Valorie]* from the formal session.
[Valorie]* If your telecom package has a chat buffer or console window
[Valorie]* you may find it helpful to activate it now. This will prevent
[Valorie]* extraneous keyboard characters from being transmitted and
[Valorie]* interrupting our guest.
[jdow] On behalf of the Amiga Exchange I would like to welcome Alex to our
       special CBiX event.
[Valorie]* This evening's session will have two parts. First, a short period
[Valorie]* during which Alex Amor will make his opening statement. During
[Valorie]* this period you may queue questions to the questions moderator.
[Valorie]* After Alex finishes his opening statement we will begin submitting
[Valorie]* questions to him from the queue. The decisions of the questions
[Valorie]* moderator will be final as to which questions are asked and the
[Valorie]* order in which they are asked.
[Valorie]* The moderators for this evening are:
[Valorie]* Chairperson    -- Valorie King, moderator, Amiga Exchange
[Valorie]* Questions Mod. -- Joanne Dow, Exchange Editor, Amiga Exchange
[Valorie]* Please submit your questions to the Questions Moderator using /msg
[Valorie]* unless she informs you to use another method (i.e. moving to a
[Valorie]* specific channel to discuss your question with her).
[Valorie]* Our guest will have DND (do not disturb) turned on so that he is
[Valorie]* not bothered with trying to handle both public and private questions.
[Valorie]* If you do not wish to receive messages you may also set /DND ON
[Valorie]* This will not block messages from the moderators.
[Valorie]* We also have two other roving moderators present. Rich and
           Nancy. Thanks for coming and helping out!
[Valorie]* Thank you for coming. We hope you find this evening enjoyable and
[Valorie]* informative. Please remember that our purpose here is to listen
[Valorie]* to Alex and to extract as much information from him as we can
[Valorie]* without using the instruments of torture <grin>. So, grab a cup
[Valorie]* of coffee or a soda and settle in for what we anticipate will
[Valorie]* be a very informative and pleasant evening.
[Valorie]* Alex, would you like to start with an introduction of yourself and
           whatever preparatory comments you have?
[alex-CEI]* Thank you Valerie..
[alex-CEI]* Good evenening.
[alex-CEI]* As you know CEI is a Commodore Distributor in the U.S.
[alex-CEI]* who is interested in purchasing the Commodore assets (Amiga)..
[alex-CEI]* and making a go...we appreciate the tons of support we have...
[alex-CEI]* received from end users, engineers, developers and dealers...
[alex-CEI]* I'm available for any questions.

[jdow] And here is the first question mostly because it is foremost in my mind.
[jdow] sodekirk: How will the buyout affect the existing user base, developers
       and developer support, etc. in the USA? Will support continue here for
       us? Will marketing and promotion continue in the USA? Will there be
       efforts made to increase the visibility of the Amiga in the USA? What can
       we realistically expect?
[alex-CEI]* Boy, what a loaded question... I hope they get easier from
            here on...
[alex-CEI]* First and foremost, the Amiga community (developers, users, etc)..
[alex-CEI]* have had a tough road as far as support fro the old C=...
[alex-CEI]* our partners in this venture have analysed the mistakes tath C=..
[alex-CEI]* made.  We are committed to an aggressive marketing campaign..
[alex-CEI]* in both the U.S. and overseas.. I believe that a product must...
[alex-CEI]* be succesfull in the U.S. if it is going to survive world-wide.
[alex-CEI]* As far as other support our staf will be made to understand who is..
[alex-CEI]* number one...the customer.  Ours is an attitude of openess and..
[alex-CEI]* cooperation.
[alex-CEI]* I hope that answers your question.

[jdow] OK - lemme hunt up the next one - which is another toughie
[jdow] bobr1: Q: When do you expect a *final* answer as to who wins the
       bidding war?
[alex-CEI]* We are happy to announce, that based on our meeting with the
[alex-CEI]* trustee, we are close to the acquisition of Commodore and it's
[alex-CEI]* assets.  An announcement can come within the next 3 weeks.
[alex-CEI]* ??

[jdow] VaxBrat: Dealer network.  Assuming there are any local dealers left to
       pick up the line what are your plans for distribution and other support?
[alex-CEI]* During this lull our staff has been working with major...
[alex-CEI]* players in the distribution and retail channels to make..
[alex-CEI]* sure the Amiga can come back in style. Closely after acquisition..
[alex-CEI]* we expect to make announcements which should be welcomed by...
[alex-CEI]* dealers, end-users and developers...  We realize that the core...
[alex-CEI]* of the business should be handled through the local dealer...
[alex-CEI]* but greater public awareness is important as well as better..
[alex-CEI]* penetration.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] This is a distillation of several: What new models do you expect to be
       delivering in the near future?
[alex-CEI]* Without making any major announcements (that would get engineers
            upset).
[alex-CEI]* it is logical to expect the introduction of the A4000 tower in...
[alex-CEI]* a number of different flavors including a 68060 when time time..
[alex-CEI]* is right...in addition the intro of a higher performance a1200...
[alex-CEI]* (read 68030) would follow .... the CD1200 and CD4000 are also..
[alex-CEI]* very close to coming off the drawing boards...as well the ..
[alex-CEI]* latest release of the operating system.  Our major concern at..
[alex-CEI]* present is filling the backlog of Amigas currently on order.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] Another generic question: Is there still enough dealer network out
       there to make distribution of the Amiga feasible?
[alex-CEI]* Yes, the good dealer is still left.  As you know only the good
            survive.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] bobr1: Q: How will existing warranties on machines already purchased
       this year be supported by the new organization.  What will the new CBM
       be called?
[alex-CEI]* The current working name for the new company is Amiga Technology
            International.  This name of course is subject to change.
[alex-CEI]* As far as warranty, we are working on a program to alleviate to log
            of warranty work.
[alex-CEI]* One of our options is to charge those old C= customers with only
            the minimum labor charges.  We realize that the warranty
[alex-CEI]* is not our responsibility but would will do everything possible to
            garner good will from Commodore's old customers.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] twalsh: Alex, in the event you acquire C=, any thoughts on getting
       Amigas into education markets? Good opportunities exist in multimedia
       applications where the Amiga still has the edge.
[alex-CEI]* As some of you are aware my company has been responsible for
            getting major Amiga based education labs in the state of Florida.
[alex-CEI]* Educators require high performance computers, and good prices
            ( sounds like Amigas to me).
[alex-CEI]* I do not expect the Amiga to become a replacement for PCs but to
            fullfill a specific market niche in multimedia,
[alex-CEI]* video editing courses, arts, and music.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] jbasile: Q: Will CEI work more closely with developers, providing
       timely info, prototype machines, and future market directions?
[alex-CEI]* In order for the new Amiga company to work it is ESSENTIAL
            to form strategic partnerships with developers.
[alex-CEI]* We realize that machines dont sell its applications that
            sells machines.
[alex-CEI]* We will have developers conference in both the US and Europe
            immediately
[alex-CEI]* following acquisition of Commodore.  In addition a steering
            committee of
[alex-CEI]* developers and end users will be formed to report directly
            to the board.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] jcompton: CD4000?  Are we still talking about the Akiko/MPEG hybrid
       Zorro card?
[alex-CEI]* Yes.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] dray: Q: Do you plan to finish development of AAA...and if not will
       future Amigas retain the OS that we all know and love?
[jdow] jcompton: This is from several people who are concerned about the new
       OS: What about making it processor-portable?
[jdow] (Both sorta go together.)
[alex-CEI]* Based on the information which has been provided from the
            current Commodore engineers the AAA
[alex-CEI]* program does not look promising.  Of course since I am not
            an engineer I am
[alex-CEI]* open minded to restarting the project.  The future seems to
            lie in a hybrid of
[alex-CEI]* 3d/RISC and current Amiga technology.  In addition, we are
            faced with the
[alex-CEI]* dilema that the 68060 is the last processor in the family.
            It is important
[alex-CEI]* to deal with the migration issue and we need to do it sooner
            not later.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] Oh you mentioned the magic number.... {^_^}
[jdow] A6000: Supposedly "AmigaCorp USA" has demonstrated the A6000 at World of
[jdow] Commodore in France. It has 100MHz 68060, AAA, Obese AGNUS with 64 sound
[jdow] channels, no mouse, two trackballs on the keyboard instead, and a 300
       pin ZORRO4
[jdow] slot for PC cards, Z2 and Z3 cards and Bridgeboards.
[jdow] (I just saw this letter today.)
[alex-CEI]* News to me!!!! But sounds pretty neat!
[alex-CEI]* ?
[jdow] It did appear to be a splendid hoax. {^_-}

[jdow] jcompton: Will we ever see the CEI 4000M (for the short of memory, the
       A4000/Emplant combo package from CEI) hit the streets in big numbers?
[alex-CEI]* The 4000MC (A4000/Emplant) still makes a lot of sense.  If
            we can get the price
[alex-CEI]* of the A4000 in line this combo has a real future ahead.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] Since lots of people are interested: ecarroll: Q: If CEI's bid is
       successful, do you intend to stick with the Amiga's  current OS,
       perhaps ported to a RISC platform, or will you be looking at
       alternatives already in use elsewhere (e.g. Windows NT)?
[alex-CEI]* The Amiga OS needs to continue into the next generation!  It
            would be nice if our new machines supported multiple OSs
[alex-CEI]* We'll need to get engineering working on this.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] bobr1: Q: What about a 'professional' low end machine, like an A1200 w/
       detatched keyboard, to compete with the likes of the Mac LC?
[alex-CEI]* First of all there was a low cost Amiga machine designed by
            Commodore engineers.  But, we
[alex-CEI]* view the price reduction of the Amiga 4000 as a more
            important move.  If the A4000
[alex-CEI]* was priced attractively we could compete with the Macs.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] dberez: Alex: Can you be a bit more specific on the O/S enhancements?
               How about imbedded network support for example.
[alex-CEI]* Network support, RTG, DIG, etc, are all important and
            necessary additions.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] twalsh: Alex, any ongoing discussion w/ NewTek you could elaborate on?
[alex-CEI]* We have a good relationship with Newtek and has promised to
            support their efforts as well
[alex-CEI]* as the efforts of other Amiga developers.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] bobr1: Q: Will SCSI be included on the motherboard of future A4000's,
       since most users waste a slot adding it anyway?
[alex-CEI]* YES! YES! YES! I hate IDE.
[alex-CEI]* ?
[alex-CEI]* Price reduced (not feature limited)! (move here as post comment ED)

[jdow] (I presume he means the cost reduced A4000 model.)
[jdow] Two together:
[jdow] jcompton:  be a competitive upgrade from OS 3.1 to your recent OS 3.2?
[jdow] Keith Burns: Q: What does 3.2 offer that 3.1 does not?
[alex-CEI]* Pricing on upgrade needs to be competative to maintained the
            install user base at the latest revision.  In the past upgrade have
            been largely ignored by C=.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] Valorie: Q:  Assuming you successfully get the remains of CBM, will you
       keep your operation based in the US?
[alex-CEI]* Yes, our plans call for establishing a facility in the West
            Chester area where the majority of current and past engineers are
            located.
[alex-CEI]* ?
[jdow] twalsh: CEI currently offers an alternative to the 1942 monitor. Any
       plans on either resuming production of 1084 or a clone of it? Monitors
       with composite modes are in big demand.
[alex-CEI]* Yes, we have begun negotiations with suppliers to provide
            new monitors for Amiga Technologies.
[alex-CEI]* They include a composite monitor and a wide band multisync.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] lhinckley: A former C= engineer commented last nite that the Norristown
       facility had been sold.  What does this mean to your plans?
[alex-CEI]* The Norristow facility is the center of the chip production.
            We expect to reach agreement to have the new owners manufacture the
[alex-CEI]* necessary chips for production of current and future Amigas.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] +Nancy: Q: Is there any chance that C= stock will be worth anything, or
       do the deals (rule that out).
[jdow] I think I already know this answer; but, we need a laugh.
[alex-CEI]* I have utilize my stocks to wallpaper our bathroom;)
[alex-CEI]* ?
[jdow] Me too. <sigh>

[jdow] Keith Burns: Q: What RISC platform will be/has been chosen for the
       future Amiga
[alex-CEI]* This decision has not been made.  Once we are succesfull we
            will need input from developers, engineers and end users.
[alex-CEI]* Of course our interest are a PA Risc, PowerPC and others.
[alex-CEI]* ?
[jdow] (If you win...) Is there really going to be hardware available for
       Christmas?
[alex-CEI]* The likelyhood is that there won't be any hardware available
            for Christmas other than a few CD32s.
[alex-CEI]* Our marketing people are looking at other options to make the
            holiday season a profitable
[alex-CEI]* one for dealers.
[alex-CEI]* ?
[jdow] dequeen: Why is the buyout taking so long?
[alex-CEI]* You must remember Commodore was a large company with many
            divisions located in many countries.  This scenerio did not
            allow for a quick resolution as we had all hoped for.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] twalsh: Alex, any thoughts of selling/building a 24-bit A4000T? From
       the factory with a 24-bit graphics card already installed.
[alex-CEI]* I believe we should wait for a little more OS support (RTG).
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] reinhards: Any chance to see an Amiga with a DSP?
[alex-CEI]* We like the DSP option but need software support to really
make it viable.  Since the Amiga is a true multimedia machine sound and video
inputs and outputs should come standard on future Amigas.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] jcompton: Q: What I was driving at with my 3.1/3.2 question was this:
       Will people be in another 2.04/2.1 situation, shelling out another
       $100-$150 in a few months?
[alex-CEI]* The major concern is releasing an operating system which is
            consistant and accesible to all user.
[alex-CEI]* It is not a financial issue.  We need to stabilize the customer
            base before real progress can be made.
[alex-CEI]* My suggestion is acquire 3.2 when we release it.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] lhinckley: Q: Will there be a flea market or a museum from the
       Westchester auction goodies? I saw the C65 and the PC palmtop...
[alex-CEI]* Yes, we are in the process of cataloging the items from the
            west chester facility and will hold an online auction in the future...
            did you
[alex-CEI]* say pizza size Amiga (we have one) how about a C65 yes we
have them too..more to come.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] twalsh: C= UK is planning an Amiga developer's party next week. Could
       CEI perhaps throw something similar  (win or lose) to keep
       developers/dealers together?
[alex-CEI]* Once we are succesful then we can move forward immediately with a
            working developers conference (we'll supply the beer and chips)!
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] VaxBrat: Third party.  What plans for enticing third parties to develop
       and port strategic software and hardware from other platforms?
[alex-CEI]* You mean more than beer and chips:)
[alex-CEI]* The key will be to support the developers (both large and
            small) by
[alex-CEI]* bundling software with the machines.  In addition the new
            company is willing to
[alex-CEI]* pay developers to port over the software.  This is something
            C= almost never did.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] dray: (any plans for) an A4000T with an '060 ??
[alex-CEI]* Yes!
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] Keith Burns: Q: We have been hearing 3 weeks since July, is 3 weeks
       realistic?
[alex-CEI]* The dates which you have been hearing are generally rumors.
            This is the first time that I am sufficiently confortable to say
            the end is near.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] jcompton: Q: WHEN you release 3.2?  Is it a definite, irrelevant of the
       result of the buyout?
[alex-CEI]* Result of the buyout.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] This one seems to have been missed in a double above:
[jdow] bobr1: Q: Many periphs, such as audio digitizers, waste the par port.
       Will new models include audio samplers or extra par ports with these in
       mind?
[alex-CEI]* I think I already answered that.... The new machines should
            have both audio/video inputs and outputs built into the motherboard.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] dray: (any plans for) an A4000T with an '060 ??
[alex-CEI]* Yes.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] twalsh: GVP, once a cornerstone of the Amiga market, is a mere shadow
       of its former self. Have you been in contact with them, and, if so, your
       thoughts, please?
[alex-CEI]* We are having constant conversations with GVP as most
            developers they are sitting in the side line waiting for something
            to happen.
[alex-CEI]* Once this process get underway I expect that GVP will
            continue to support the Amiga and move forward with some of their
            exciting products.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] twalsh: Any thoughts on a television advertising campaign should you
       win the bid?
[alex-CEI]* Realistically, major advertising campaigns are at least 9
            months away.  We need to contentrate on rebuilding the developer
            base, the dealer channel, new products and then to Hollywood.
<then he followed up ED>
[alex-CEI]* Initial advertisement will be conducted in the niche trade
            presses (video magazines, tradional Amiga magazines, multimedia mags
            and even general computer mags (Byte)).
[alex-CEI]* This will be followed by a very aggressive show schedule
            around the world.
<end followup ED>
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] dberez: Alex: You still havn't told us what will be in 3.2?  Can youi
       be more specific as to features and availabilty?
[alex-CEI]* Let me follow up on the last question first.
<answer lost in the followup frenzy. ED>

[jdow] bobr1: Q: Will you produce a laptop or lunchbox portable, or license
       the chipset to outside vendors interested in such a product?

[alex-CEI]* 3.2 will feature minor improvements over 3.1 it will also
            stop the illegal distribution of 3.1 by unscroupulous developers.
[alex-CEI]* Remeber there are certain entities which a properly selling
            3.1 but we have seen a number of manual copied on Xerox machines
            with beta versions of 3.1.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] twalsh: Alex, have you been in contact with C= Canada, or do they
       factor into your plans? There's many Amiga users north of the border.
[alex-CEI]* Yes, we have an extremely good relationship with the Canadian
            operations.  The Canadian market holds a lot of promise for the
            Amiga.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] (A loaded one) bobr1: Q: No matter who wins, is there a possibility of
       CEI and C=UK joining forces and sharing resources to be truly
       international?
[alex-CEI]* As I have said before, the door remains open to C=UK. I cannot
            say if the reverse is true.
[alex-CEI]* ?
[jdow] jgoodmon: Q: will the prices of machines (1200/4000) be the same as
       before?
[alex-CEI]* One of our goals is to work on reducing the price for the A4000
            machines.  I do not believe a lot can be done on the 1200 pricing.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] twalsh: In your last on-line conf., you mentioned the assembly plant in
       the Phillipines being under the trustee's possession. Do you plan to
       re-open it?
[jdow] jdow: Speaking of which - - - I heard a rumor of counterfeit AMigas
       appearing from that plant!
[alex-CEI]* The rumours of counterfeit Amigas is that..a rumour.  As far
            as reopening the Phil. factory
[alex-CEI]* we have no plans.  The quaility of the product and the
            distance between it and major
[alex-CEI]* markets do not make economic sense.  We are working with a
            major manufacturing partner
[alex-CEI]* to build quaility Amigas in the good ol' USA and Europe.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] A financial pair:
[jdow] geocresswell: How long can CEI operate w/o any income form the Amiga
       line?
[jdow] elminster: How well financed are you? Do you have the money to support
       all these plans?
[alex-CEI]* CEI was not only an Amiga distributor but also a number of
            third party peripherals and a manufacturer of several products
            ourselves.
[alex-CEI]* The group of investor who are backing our venture for the
            acquisition of COmmodore have commited significant
[alex-CEI]* resources to make our plans happen.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] Keith Burns: Q: Apple payed Microsoft to port Office to the MAC because
       no one wants one (machine for accounts and another for word processing.)
[alex-CEI]* Your question?
[alex-CEI]* ?
[jdow] I think he wants to know if you plan to "entice" MS or WP to port their
       products perhaps with financial enhancements.
[alex-CEI]* There are a number of products which are important for the
            Amiga.  Of course we are willing to pay to have them ported.
[alex-CEI]* I am however not ready to have Office ported for the Amiga
            yet.  I think Bill Gates has plenty of money already:)
[alex-CEI]* ?
[jdow] Grin!

[jdow] sodekirk: Is the Amiga the ONLY computer line CEI handles?
[alex-CEI]* Yes
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] dberez: Assumming you buy out CBM, any chance of the new company going
       public?
[alex-CEI]* Yes, our investors would like to see the company public
            after two years of operations.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] bobr1: Q: Can you identify this group of investors? What control will
       they have in the company?  Will the company go public?
[alex-CEI]* Unlike the former C= day to day decisions will be made by
            management team who understand the Amiga and the market not by
            money guys.
[alex-CEI]* I am not at liberty to discuss the investors, only to say
            that they are technology driven and understand the potential of the
            Amiga core technology.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] jbasile: Q: Do you have plans to continue WOCA type shows in the USA?
[alex-CEI]* YES!  Shows will be affordable to the developers, vendors
            and end-users.  All the Amiga shows are very important.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] ecarroll: Q: Any plans to add "Scan-doubler" technology to future AGA
       machines to overcome problems they currently have with VGA monitors?
[alex-CEI]* At this time this is an open subject to discussion, no
            decisions have been made.  C= did have some prototypes in house to
            solve this problem.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] jbasile: Q: In addition, new locations for WOCA should be chosen, i.e.,
       Boston, MA, Montreal, etc. NYC is getting stale.
[alex-CEI]* How bout Walla Walla Washington? hehehe
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] dray: Q: Have you been in contact with anyone about compilers and other
       development tools needed by developers if you do switch to a RISC CPU?
[alex-CEI]* No, the decision for which RISC processor has not been made. Once
            it is they will be approached for the proper tools and support.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] Bill_L: "Does Apple's recent announcement that it will be licensing the
       Mac OS affect your marketing strategy?
[alex-CEI]* No, not at all. AmigaOS stands heads above the Mac System.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] dray: Q: If you drop AAA, would you allow 3rd parties to license it?
[alex-CEI]* If the design stage is sufficiently far along for AAA to be
            useful to developers of course.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] twalsh: If you win the bid, acquire C= lock, stock, and barrel, is
       there a one-, two-or five-year business plan you could briefly outline;
       i.e., distribution, European market development, product strategies?
[alex-CEI]* I have written books on this question literally.. let try
            the Cliff Note version here.
[alex-CEI]* The A4000 can be migrated upward to take advantage of the
            68060 with a number of enhancements and then unto RISC.
[alex-CEI]* The low end (A1200) still has a lot of life as a low end
            computer (68030,040, etc)
[alex-CEI]* We will control a variety of niche market in which the Amiga
            excels:
[alex-CEI]* Videography, 3#d rendering, multimedia and entertainment.
[alex-CEI]* By getting the Amiga name recognize as the ultimate graphic
            machine the machine will blossom
[alex-CEI]* into new vertical applications.  We have reached tentative
            agreements with Europen distributors and
[alex-CEI]* dealers to support the Amiga in those markets.
[alex-CEI]* That's the Cliff Note version.
[alex-CEI]* >

[jdow] Do you need a brief recess? {^_-}
[jdow] (I have LOTS more queued up.)
[alex-CEI]* No, let's continue for the next 15 minutes.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] jcompton: What sort of lines of communication between "ATI" and the end
       user do you see?
[alex-CEI]* Friendly, :), technical support and cooperation.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] bobr1: Q: Do you plan to make a laptop or lunchbox portable, or if not
       license the chipset to interested outside developers?
[alex-CEI]* It does not make sense to develop a laptop with the current
            AA technology.  My understanding is
[alex-CEI]* that the next generation will be better suited for this
            application.  If someone is interested
[alex-CEI]* in making a "luggable" we will be more than happy to
            entertain offers.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] twalsh: If a co. wanted to buy/inspect the Phillipine plant, do they
       contact the trustee, the Phillipine gov't., or ???
[alex-CEI]* Call the trustee, serious inquiries are being accomodated.
[alex-CEI]* ?
[jdow] (I'd call the insurance agent first.)

[jdow] dray: Do you plan on having both/either internet and phone support for
       both developers and user??
       (Hopefully continueing here on BIX, jdow {^_-})
[alex-CEI]* yes, communication is important to the new management team.
            Plans include having a constant online presence.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] jcompton: Q: Will that sort of manufacturing/distribution of peripherals
       continue?  Will there once again be a truly "full" package from one
       company at once?
[alex-CEI]* All aspects of manufacturing and distribution will be

[jdow] bobr1: Q: Will the CD32 be continued and enhanced for the long haul, or
       do you see it as the end of the line as far as game consoles & the amiga
       are concerned?
[jdow] In line with that I know several kiosk manufacturers who are VERY eager
       to get CD32s.
[alex-CEI]* I love the potential of the CD32 and expect to continue and enhance
            the product. But it is not very realistic to
[alex-CEI]* fight a battle with the Titans (Sony, Nintendo, Sega) at this time.
            We think there is a great market for the CD32 as a low cost
            multimedia delivery platform.
[alex-CEI]* The CD32 will continue to do well in Europe as a game console and
            once a deal is finalize new software should be coming online.

[jdow] Keith Burns: Will you constant online presence maintain the developer
       conference on BIX? (I invite him to examine it. I can ask Carloyn to

[jdow] Two together again:
[jdow] twalsh: C= often spoke of "infomercials" for CD32 that never happened.
       Planning some?
[jdow] twalsh: Also, QVC is rumored to have bought/leased the W. Chester bldg.
       Some of the former C= management approached them to market CD32. Has CEI?
[alex-CEI]* It appears that the "infomercials" have not been succesful for
            Phillips.
[alex-CEI]* I am familiar with the discussions of C= and QVC, there is always a
            possiblity to further those discussion but not agreement or decision
            has been reached.

[jdow] jcompton: Can you realistically see the Amiga being sold in the same
       markets as a Mac or PC in the future?  ("Home Office", that sort of
       marketing lingo...)
[alex-CEI]* No initially, we are directing the marketing funds towards
            the market were we have a significant chance of winning.  If we
            are succesfull there then we'll take the challange.

[jdow] Bill_L: Mac OS again - providing Mac compatibility in a bundle could
       sway purchasers to the Amiga. Do you see this as a good possibility?
[alex-CEI]* Yes, we saw this opportunity early on, that's why we bundled
            Emplant with the A4000.
[alex-CEI]* ?
[jdow] hughcrawford: Are there any plans to do a Amiga on a board to fit in a
       slot of a computer such as a PC clone or the pci slot of the upcoming
       Power PCs, sort of a reverse BridgeBoard?
[alex-CEI]* There are a lot of discussions on that topic but nothing solid yet.
            I like the idea of introducing the world to the Amiga OS.  This
            would also solve a lot of problems for the Amiga developer
            breaking into the PC market.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] elminster: When will the new version of RKM (revised to cover 3.1 or
       higher) be released? Is there already something in the works?
[alex-CEI]* As we speak I am almost finished with the new RKM:)
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] ecarroll: Both Apple and IBM have announced TCP/IP support in future OS
       releases. Will CEI follow suit?
[alex-CEI]* This time we will follow, next time we will lead.
[alex-CEI]* ?
[jdow] VaxBrat: Any Plans for A FEDERAL sales group.  Support of Amix or Posix
       type O/S?
[alex-CEI]* The Federal government has purchased substantial amount of Amiga
            products in the past.  We expect to rebuild that part of the market
            slowly.  Don't expect a new division of new OS soon.
[alex-CEI]* ?

[jdow] Demetri: Since time is the biggest factor, what will you do to try to
       keep the remaining Amiga users stick with the new C=?
[alex-CEI]* The one thing C= did right was excellent deals on Power Ups.
            If we can bring new exciting machines to market with reasonable
            pricing and upgrade paths there is no reason to lose the loyal
            users.

[jdow] jcompton: Presuming you win in 3 weeks or so, what will you be doing

[jdow] geocresswell: any plans to hit NAB next year?
[alex-CEI]* If we can complete the acquisition in time my marketing guys
            have come up with a wild event for CES.  Yes, trade shows
            including NAB are important to our goals.

let me discuss these plans online.:)

[jdow] One last serious one then....
[jdow] dequeen: What should we expect in terms of worldwide marketing? Will
       there be efforts made to let more people in on the secret of the Amiga?
       whavens: Q: What will the relationship be between CEI and CBM UK if you
       win? If not?
[alex-CEI]* A two part:
[jdow] Um - oh well - two crept into the buffer
[alex-CEI]* The best sales tool for the Amiga computer is to have people
            experience the Amiga and its operating system.
[alex-CEI]* If we can get consumer awareness success will come naturally, to
            that extent we will work to educate the consumer through the
            right marketing channels.
[alex-CEI]* As far as the Commodore UK group, I will repeat myself a thousand
            time, I have left the door open to work jointly if we are
            succesfull. The Amiga needs friends and supporters not waring
            factions.

       victory party? And will the owner of the floor scrubber be invited?
[jdow] jcompton: (Please ask this before Alex leaves:) Alex, can you please
       detail your plans for keeping the ATI office floors properly scrubbed?
[alex-CEI]* We might not have time for a party there is a lot of work for
            developers, dealers, supporters and ourselves.  As far as floor
            scrubbing I understand you excel Jason.

Title: ALIEN BLAST

Genre: Arcade
Language: AMOS
Rating: *

In the scroller, the author notes that he'll not apologize for the
simplicity of the game/graphics (one or both...I forgot), that the game is
a first attempt and just an excuse to kick some alien butt.  Well, I can't
fault him there...good call.  But I hope he won't fault me for calling 'em
as I see 'em.  Poor title page, jerky scroller, garish backgrounds and
mediocre gameplay.  It's really not so awful that it is unplayable, it's
just not worth one's time with so much really BITCHIN' stuff out there!
In the game's defense, it IS uncompiled (hence the jerkiness?) and it is
still better than most of what you'll find in the PD scene on other
computers (or equivalent to...)

Title: ALL ROUNDER - A CRICKET SIMULATION
Author: Gary L. Brown
date: 1992
Genre: Sports
Version: 1.03
Language: AMOS
Origin: UK
Availability: 17 Bit Disk 2225
Rating: ***

Author Brown has ported his own Cricket game from its original versions on
the VIC-20 and BBC computers, this time out offering a more realistic
simulation of the game (in other words, the computer team is not perfect).
This version saves averages, scores and league data.  Upon loading the
game, you'll note the slick title page and info screen...nice touch.
Shame that after that, the text overwrites the graphic screen boxes (an
AMOS bug, I believe).  This mess is seen on the Main Menu and subsequent
screens.  From that menu, you may choose to view or reset the leagues and
averages, or you can play a single match or continue league.  After moving
into the game choice, you'll need to select the competing teams, match
length, and control (human, CPU, summary).  A coin flip determines who has
the option choice over batting or fielding.  From this point on, it is the
simulation itself, which features reasonable graphics, but just barely
tolerable sound.  Many of the menu boxes are designed in such a way that
they look like a PC program, so that's not good.  Otherwise, this is
probably the best PD/shareware cricket sim you'll find.

Title: AUTOMOBILES
Author: Tero Heikkinen/Overflow Productions
Date: 1994
Genre: Racing
Language: AMOS
Rating: **

Apparently inspired by the PC game SLICKS & SLIDE, this is an overhead
racing game for 1-3 players (3-player mode only available for 14Mhz+
systems).  Blitz Basic has its commercial baby SKIDMARKS and now AMOS has
this, although this is not necessarily a good promo for AMOS.  The title
page looks nice enough, but wait states on the Options screens are too
sensitive on accelerated systems.  The game comes with 9 tracks and
promises more to follow...quite personally I'd rather see better control
of the cars, as they handle much the same as all other overhead racing
games (except SKIDMARKS).  The potential seems to be here for a good game,
but it needs a bit more polishing off first.

Title: BIONIX II - THE CHALLENGE
Author: Mirage
Genre: Shoot-em-up
Origin: Holland
Rating: ****

For PD, this is pretty spiffy.  The intro delivers some nicely digitized
speech before loading the vertically scrolling space shooting action,
which is somewhat on the average side.  There are 55 enemies to shoot at
and 14 different enemy types.  They come charging at you, and you simply
blast them to smithereens.  According to the programmer, he uses
Quatro-Buffering (4 buffers) to move the enemies in 32-color real-time.  A
decent diversion.

Title: BLEED - A JOURNEY THROUGH VIOLENCE
Author: Zaz/Dual Crew
Genre: Adventure
Origin: Sweden
Rating: ***

Apparently this is a port of a C-64 adventure game by THE GNN (?) and is
ported to the Amiga by Dual Crew, a team of graphics coders, trainer
makers and (I assume) crackers.  The text parser is loaded with
obscenities, as one would expect from this crowd.  Likewise, there are
many sick references and violence that could only appease young teenage
cyberpunks.  You play Brad Nixon, a 27 year old NYC traffic cop, circa
1985.  If you try to play a serious game, you'll find yourself
investigating a schoolhouse slaughter, but you'll not be playing a serious
game, so...  The interface is nice for a text adventure, but somewhere,
you should be informed that you have to use the spacebar to play.

Well well well - back for more sickness, eh?  Damn kids!  Essentially,
more of the same.  A music soundtrack has been added, but a toggle would
have helped since you grow quite sick of the toon through your
exploration.  The text element continues with more nihilistic, racist,
homophobic humor (?) that also shows a total disregard for children, the
elderly and animals (I'll bet Liberals LOVE this game!).  Resetting is
tougher since the ninnies locked the keyboard from reboots (sigh).

Simply splendid piece of shareware.  This commercial quality platform
arcade game gets your attention from the start with their shareware plea
(a more reasonable deal you'll not find!) and offers not only the right to
play this game, but a poster for their upcoming release (THE COMPLETE
DUNGEONEER, a 3D RPG) and a discount on that game as well.  Those gifts
aside, this game is a great value on its own.  Like in most games of the
genre, you play a cute young boy who walks, hops and bounces across
colorful Nintendo-ish platforms and walls, killing bugs and other
psychotic enemies.  Power-ups will give you more powerful weapons.  Avoid
pits of lava (at least it LOOKS like lava to me) and getting hit too many
times by the baddies.  This game is a gas!

Yet another online game based on a slew of others.  It all started with
ARENA, which spawned its more popular clone FOOD FIGHT.  Loads of clones
of the latter appeared before BRAZIL, but the game sat in limbo in its
MS-DOS counterpart for one reason or another.  It has transmogrified from
its MS-DOS Pascal beginnings up to this Amiga SAS/C version for DLG
Professional BBS.  From that point, it's the basic fighting stuff that
you find in its predecessors (and clones).

Title: DRIP
Author: Art Skiles
Date: 1989
Genre: Arcade
Origin: USA
Rating: *****

Wow!  I still remember my disbelief when this first came out...never
before had I seen such a polished public domain offering.  In reality,
this could have easily been a big performing commercial effort, since it
eclipsed so much banal product out at the time (actually, a lot of what
is still being released!).  Drip is the main chracter, a drip of water who
has the task of getting to the 16th floor (15 levels) by moving across the
pipes, rusting them all, which allows you to advance to the next floor.
No mean feat, since you have enemy forces to avoid, like acid, plasma,
ice cubes which shoot from the pipes, clouds which clean the pipes,
lasers, electric bubbles and coils, and crystal balls - all with their own
particular characteristics.  It's offset by two help thingies:  bubbles,
which will allow you to ride in them, making your job more swift, and
balloons which will carry you across pipes that you normally must follow
on track.  The sound and graphics are near perfect, with cuteness
plastered all over them.  But don't be fooled - the strategy element is
fierce, so don't expect to make it to floor 16 any time soon!  Get this
game!

This sequel is chock full of beautiful graphics, you can't take that away

game, send Matt the requested fiver, okay?  E-TYPE II is, like it's
parent, an update on the ASTEROIDS theme, only with spiffy visuals.  There
are some problems, though.  As you shoot at the rocks repeatedly, they
just take the shots in a static way until they've been blasted enough and
then they finally explode...hard to swallow that concept.  And it's still
just ASTEROIDS with fancy duds on, but that's not a completely bad thing
to be.  If classic arcade shooters appeal to ya, you can't go much wrong
here.

Genre: Racing
Version: 4.1
Language: AMOS
Origin: UK
Availability: 17 Bit Disk 2025 (v3.0)
NOTE: Full version from Deja Vu Licenseware
Rating: ****

Let me begin by noting that this game (v3.0) is neither PD nor shareware,
although you CAN try this version out in a non-saving demo.  Author
Rennocks has apparently spent a great deal of time and put a lot of work
into this product, which features music (two toons) & sfx, as well as
graphics.  It is more of a management simulation than an arcade racer,
which is why you'll want to register the game for saving your season(s).
The included season is 1992, which autoloads.  As the game loads, you
choose how many players (1-4), skill level (easy, average, tricky, or
impossible?), and choose a team (from 15 cars).  After that, it's time to
spend your money (1,000,000) on your engine (14 choices), tires (or
tyres, as the Brits call it), and driver (50 choices).  With all of that
out of the way, the Main Menu lets you choose info on Championship,
drivers (including tables for career points, wins, pole positions, and
pitstop times), records if any, weather conditions & forecast, cars &
drivers of players, race details (with track details, season, country,
circuit & lap info), load/save, credit screen, and finally, The Race,
which displays the racers and weather before loading the game screen.  The
race is 72 laps and is played on a split screen; the bottom half is the
track with its cars flashing by, while the top half displays racing
statistics as they happen.  The positions are listed and updated each lap
with incidentals posted as they occur (car failures, wrecks, pitstop
times, fastest laps, spins, rejoins).  The sound of cars racing past is
aggravating with its sloppy thump at the start of the sample.  At the end
of the race, several conclusion screens display winners and placers,
however quite often the text is too large for the screen which simply runs
off the screen - this seems to be fixed in the 4.x version(s).  Apart from
these minor shortcomings, the game is thorough and loaded with managerial
fun.

One of those Euro-stats-sports type disks that they seem to enjoy making

code holds its own against the pack.  The program itself keeps accurate
records of your courses and your current handicap, while also offering

use of maps/tiles (this is a tutorial in how NOT to use game maps!) and
average sound.  Couple this with the below par title page and you have a

saucer, it drops tokens which give such bonuses as faster movement, faster
shooting, extra shots, double firepower and extra lives.  Certainly worth

The distributable version of this game is a bit stripped down, while the
registered version contains 40 new levels (rather than 9) and a whole
bunch of other k00l stuff spread out across two disks!  But the version I
looked at failed to make an impression on me.  The routines were slow and
annoying: the title screen gives you options to play game, enter password,
view high scores or get in-game help.  Upon choosing any of them gives you
a redundant animation that is slow and jerky.  Even loading the game
itself is slow and cumbersome (I loaded it from RAM!!! and even still had
to hear my hard drive grinding away...and the game was NOT packed!) - and
still the display was messy with text, even though the font assigns were
correct.  Game-wise, in a Q*BERT-style, your character (Jelly) hops across
various blocks, each with different values and actions.  His object is to
rescue the jelly beans that were kidnapped from General Jelly and taken to
Castle Jelly (are we back to the redundancy check again?).  There's more
to the story (MUCH more...), but space is at a premium and I really didn't
like the game due to lowsy control and ill thought-out bothers.

The Tetris clone rears its ugly head again...well, not exactly.  To begin
with, this is not ugly - in fact, the graphics are quite pretty!  As you
may have gathered from the name of the game, it is a cross pollination of
two hit games, KLAX and TETRIS.  There are three levels of difficulty
(Easy, Medium, and Hard - duh!) and each feature their own unique
background and drop piece design.  Each high score table is separately
created for that level of gameplay.  As in its parent games, the 3
interlocked blocks drop to the bottom of the well and you can shift the
color in a loop.  The idea is to create matches of three colors or more in
order to wipe out that pattern.  The assembly language coding makes for
smooth play, if a tad sensitive.  Command line alterations will let you
use your own choice of music for the game (NoiseTracker mods).  I only had
one problem with the game and that is the poorly written documentation
(being the English purist that I am) - somebody should tell this guy to
put spaces after commas and periods, among other awful grammatical errors.
I know this is nit-picking, but I didn't bother reading it due to this
annoying writing style.  The game, however, is quite enjoyable and very
durable.

"...blast as many ST's and aliens as possible...blast your way from the

this anti-Atari arcade excursion.  And quite a good shooting frenzy it is!
As the game loads its nice little pics and anims, we here the strains of
Queen's "Another One Bites the Dust" before the robot from Lost in Space
blasts the Atari logo <grin>, then a selection screen gives us a host of
choices, such as 1-2 player game (always a plus) and level of difficulty
(normal, easy, medium, missile, block, fire).  The action is as fast and
furious and challeneging as any SPACE INVADERS clone I have played (and
yes, it IS a SPACE INVADERS clone) and is a competent shooter even without
the esoteric undertones.

Hey, I can't really find too much problem with this nifty little
Demolition Derby arcade game.  The car/vehicle sprites may take a couple
of seconds to figure out which end is which, but once you get going, it's
a real blast!  You are given $50,000 (or 50,000 - depending on whether
you are in NTSC or PAL...a nice touch!) which you may spend on various
doo-dads for your vehicle.  Without going into too much detail, here's a
wrap-up of the features: NTSC/PAL support, Quitting (ESC or tilde), cheat
mode, 6 vehicles (which can be played simultaneously) to pick from, 6
backgrounds (which I assume could be replaced with your own designs?!?), 7
power-ups, 6 damage upgrades, and many other nice features that you should
discover yourself.  The author insists on the demo being called a demo
(between that and his shareware plea, the brevity of his doc is pushed to
the max).  Hell, register this game...it is better than many commercial
outings.

Yes, another text adventure.  Take the disk, CD to the ANATT directory (or

ANATT.hlptext for a lot of mumbo jumbo about the state of gaming, text
adventures, global politics, programming, etc.  I don't know why, but it's

somewhat limited, the use of English is stunningly abysmal (run-on
sentences, misspellings, grammatical errors, and general
incomprehensibility) and a general lack of interest all combine to make an
unsatisfying adventure experience.  I also found it far too easy to lose

A possible good idea that is flawed due to flaky graphics and piss-poor

in the face with a recession (silly, innit?), so to prevent the spread of
crime and poorness the government decides awarding cash prizes in a
Lemmings Olympics will solve the problems (Clintonomics?).  All that
nonsense for a simple waggling TRACK & FIELD game?  It's worse - the
graphics are so simple that they are revolting, it's a waggler but you
waggle with the mouse (joystick waggling was bad enough, but this?), and
lastmost, you haven't a clue how well you are doing until after the event!
You compete in the 200 Metre Race, Horse and Cart Race, Javelin Throw,
Long Jump, Rowing Race, Skateboarding, and Swimming competitions, but no
amount of choices can make the gameplay work.

Coded by a 17-year old junior, this game borrows a lot of inspiration from
SUPER MARIO BROTHERS (plotwise only, since none of the NES banner game's
playability made it to the translation).  The story: the evil Brutus has
taken away Peter's girlfriend Daphne, so in order to rescue her, Peter
must follow the trail of (and collect up) hearts which are littered along
various platforms.  The 20 levels of the game are obliterated by deadly
porcupines and other such menaces, while a dosage of bonus may also be
obtained (coins, mushrooms, etc.) to help you in your quest.  Each level
must be completed within a time limit.  Sounds okay?  Now the bad news:
this is yet another attempt by an American programmer to create an arcade
environment in the C language.  Created on a 512k A1000, the game suffers
from graphic glitches (probably only goes away when using the exact
system the game was written on!) and slow, aggrivated sprite movement.
The sound samples of Daphne are so irksome that it may induce madness
before you even complete one level.  Even updated versions from 1991
contain the same wretched weaknesses.  I wouldn't bother if I were you.

Perhaps not the best of the genre, but nonetheless playable.  A couple of
the old 8-bit classics will pop to mind, namely THRUST.  You are assigned
various missions in which you man your spaceship and maneuvre it to
docking stations using directional and thrusting skills.  Along the way,
the missions become more strategic with foreign enemies awaiting you with
firepower, so docking becomes the least of your worries!  It's all a bit
slow moving and some of the between level routines become annoying but
it's not a total loss.

An adult adventure game coded in 1 days for a demo party.  Load, save or

questions such as your name, girl's name, and slang words for certain body
parts and sex acts, among others.  The spelling and prose is rather crude,
and the expected horny boy storyline is rather predictable (in an
adolescent sort of way) with the expected boolean choices and results.  A
juvenile fantasy that may appeal to young boys (or those with similar
mentality), but the rest of us will want to pass, as it is neither erotic
nor humorous.  Allegedly the first in a series - it is easy to see why no
others followed.

Hmmm...dunno quite where to begin on this one, as there really is no equal
that I have ever seen.  And I thought the BLEED games were crude!  What is
it I am babbling on about, you ask?  A very sick idea that is executed in
a very slick way (sorta).  Animators is a Euro Demo coder group who
created this here game that pokes fun at those who are bound in
wheelchairs.  Although they do apologize and stress that they have nothing
against the handicapped, they still put a lot of work into quite a sick
joke.  TRACK AND FIELD was never like THIS!  There are four events:  1)
MOUNTAIN ROLLING, one of those waggling games I hate so much, in which you
waggle the joystick left to right at your fastest speed (until your arm
collapses) in an attempt to build up enough speed to get your cripple up
the mountain to the finish line; 2) ROAD ROLLER is a fairly well done
racing game with our wheelchair bound victim replacing the vehicle and
dodging the many obstacles along the way; 3) LONG JUMP is sorta like the
javelin throwing events or a real long jump, only you waggle to a fast
enough speed to send your paraplegic through the air and onto his head;
and finally, 4) HOSPITAL RACE is a bit of a maze wherein you move your
character through the hospital maze without hitting dead ends or patients.
Most events are close to impossible to win...probably not the point
anyway.  At the end of the events, you are instructed to insert the second
disk or the on-screen victim will be killed.  Obscenities are dispersed
liberally throughout the game.  Sounds pretty worthless, yes?  Well, I
cannot deny that this crew really have some good programming skills, as
the game is better quality than many commercial games.  The sportscasters
resemble quite closely those found in the TV SPORTS series of games!  The
music soundtrack (by Jeff) is also quite nice, consisting of mostly BP
Soundmon and JamCracker toons.  The ending displays a high score table and
an option to save your scores, then proceeds with the usual demo greetz
and messages.  If the descriptions found in this review are offensive to
you, then by all means avoid.  But if you are more daring (or liberated?),
then you may want to indulge in the carnage and give it a go.

With that out of the way...  So how does this all figure in?  Well, it's
sort of a God sim.  Your objective is to buy animals which you place on a
map for breeding.  You are in a race against the computer god, with your
animals represented as red and the computer as blue.  Strategically, you
must take into account food supply, which can be countered by purchasing
trees for forest growth.  Then there's weather and other forces of nature
to contend with.  A lot of care and detail here, right down to the fully
custom icons on the disk.  But the real care is in the game itself.  The
interface should be familiar to fans of POPULOUS and its sequels and
lookalikes.  The graphics are very presentable, as is the sound.  Quite an
impressive affair, considering one man did it all here - certainly this
exceeds the traditional PD fluff of clones of SPACE INVADERS, MINES,
SOLITAIRE and TETRIS!  Highly recommended!

Playable demo version (with no save) that is distributed in floppy version
(single drive only - lame) or hard drive version.  Unfortunately, I
chanced upon the floppy version (lha'd no less!!!) that looked like the
hard drive version (with the Disk1 & Disk2 files in the root dirs - what
an annoying waste of time this caused).  That cost this game a point...
irritation is always a setback when I have to make disks myself (note to
author: DMS!!!), to say nothing of the sparse documentation.  After all of
the unsuccessful attempts at running the game from RAM: or hard drive, I
finally made the appropriate disks (yes, assigns failed too!).  And oh yes
- that second disk drive is far too advanced a concept for the game to
understand.  After getting past the decent looking, yet flickery menu page
and my mission was chosen, the game continued its annoying disk swap
nonsense before kicking me back to the system (which it takes over, by the
way).  What went wrong?  Is Kick/OS 2.x too advanced?  Is it incompatible
with my 68030?  Who the hell knows - after almost 45 minutes of hacking
with this nonsense, I'd rather spend my time on yet another Minefiled or
Tetris clone (at least they work!) - I never even determined what type of
game this is!!!
UPDATE: I went ahaed and gave it another try (it's my job!) and booted
from the disks and the game actually ran.  That out of the way, I flew my
ship (?) through some starfield-like space and did absolutely nothing.  No
encounters with other ships or aliens, although I was able to shoot.
Although a patient guy, I bailed after five minutes of this tripe.  Also
worth noting is the disk swapping is immediate when entering the game and
there is no sound to speak of.  My * grade stands.

can appears which you must pick up in order to continue the carnage - all
before the time counter reaches zero.  After picking up the gas, the
counter is reset and you can massacre more folks.  Not entirely unplayable
little game - a bit shallow, but certainly worth a look.  One quibble is
that is MUST be run from its floppy since the game looks for its graphic
screens on the disk you booted from (even "assign sys: DF0:" did no

crap music accompanying this type of game.  The graphics, while not great,
are better than usual.  A few Liberal jokes are tossed in unneccesarily as

The PD version of Spectrum Holobyte's WELLTRIS is, in fact, far superior

This is superior to WELLTRIS in every way...more visually appealing,
better sound, more addictive (I never even cared for the commercial
version) and this version has some user programmable features (colors,
sounds, etc.).  And it's nice to not have to deal with manual-based
look-up protection in order to play!  For the uninitiated, this is TETRIS
played in a 3D well, where you combine multiple shapes in order to create
the filling shape.  There are three levels of difficulty to choose from,
and you can play in Normal or Clock mode.  Control is handled via the
keyboards, but read the docs, as the keys change depending upon the mode
you are playing.  And speaking of docs, they are quite well written and
couldn't be much improved upon, outside of being printed in manual form!

various effects, including a syringe for worm-doping, ice block to freeze
enemies and test tube for invulnerability.  The worm with 7 bonus points
wins, achieved via the opponent worm crashing or by collecting hearts.
The joystick control is odd in how it changes direction randomly.  Aside
from the far-fetched plot, it's quite average.

Title: ZALYCON
Author: Jag/Fanatix
Genre: Arcade
Language: AMOS
Number of Disks: 2
Rating: ****

A very good example of what can be done with AMOS.  An arcade fest with
loads of things going on, which I'll try to give you a taste of.  In the
year 2176, space travel becomes commonplace and the Moon colonizes.  20
years later, the Moon of Zalycon employs you as a Solar System Scout to
protect it from the alien invasion of Zalycon's moonbase.  This requires
several feats, the first of which is getting there by flying your
spaceship through an asteroid field.  This is similar to the bonus level
of PROJECT X, only with collision avoiding of those arcade rocks, rather
than the caves.  Next comes a moon buggy level where you must attempt the
impossible - getting to the end!  Too many jumps and too many obstacles
make for a difficult job that I wasn't able to pull off.  A wonderful
music score is ripped from the likes of The Silents, SAE and 4-Mat of
Anarchy, among others.  The Options screen allows you to toggle sound/
music/both (good call!), instructions on/off (quite useful, actually),
music test (test the toons first hand!), score save (see next option), and
easy/normal/hard.  The difficulty level has its price: on Easy, there is
no score save or end sequence, the Medium level offers only the score
save, and the Hard levels gives you everything (like you'll achieve it!).
As a whole, this is a beautifully done work, with an exception of the
annoying flashing text on the info screens (may not occur on systems that
have no accelerator).  One final quibble is the lock on quitting - why do
programmers do that?  The game even multitasks, but will not quit!  That
one cost you a point!  Long review, I know, but I'm gonna run and try to
get to the next level! <grin>

Harv Laser had an entertaining solution for the Commodore Buyout conflict.

"I think we should settle this by holding a no holds barred hot oil grudge
match monster truck slug'it'out between amor and pleasance in the seattle
king dome."

                     Who's bought Commodore?
======================================================================
1. Barney: The new Amiga's will have 16-bit sound, but will only play
   "I love you, you love me...".  It will have 16 million colors, but
   all of them are purple.

2. Atari: The only company that can do *WORSE* than C=.

3. Sony: Unfortunately, all software is now shipped on MiniDisks.

4. Samsung: Your Amiga will now glow in the dark.
    (Remember the Korean nuclear problem?)
    Who cares about megabytes, when we've got megatonnes?

 5. Me! Hey, if Irving can do that bad, I can't do any worse. :-)

 6. Microsoft: A new chip will be added - the Bill chip, which sucks
    money out of you. The operating system will now be dos only.  A
    $200 program will replace workbench, running on top of AmigaDos,
    and attempts to multitask. When it fails, it will load solitare.
    If you have 30MB of ram and a 1000 MHZ 68080, you can buy the
    $500 program to replace the above programs.

 7. Hyundai: Now you can drive your Amiga to work. Don't forget to park
    the Hard Disk!

 8. Lego: Playing with your Amiga takes on a whoe new meaning, and you
    don't need to worry about running out of those blue connectors. :-)

 9. IBM: They'll grant licence to everybody else, release an XGA Amiga,
    remove the ZII and ZIII slots, (leaving the ISA, naturally) and then
    there'll be a proliferation of self-conflicting, useless standards
    that nobody cares about, and then you'll have to decide what type of
    non IBM Amiga you'll buy.

10. GoldStar: The new machine will be GO-AMIGA which by itself is more
    advertiseing that has been done in the last 3 years. A definate
    improvement. Added to this marketing insight will be the cheap parts,
    cheap manufacturing etc.

11. Sam Walton: Okay, fine he's dead, but either way, Walmigas would be
    cool.
    When you boot, a person will greet you and show you today's specials.
    Here's where a certain manufacturer could learn a thing or two about
    SERVICE.
    Service means more than one nice guy in the service department.
    Hundreds of nice guys should be around to help you.

12. HP: Amigas will now have built in printers, so you won't need to worry
    about drivers.

13. Apple: There will now be a new food group: Chips & Amigas. You can take
    a byte out of your computer when you're hungry.

Got another buyer? Send it to me at Mark_Yovorsky@comnet.cbmtor.gts.org

*** "WINDOWS(tm)" *** MACHINE INDEPENDENT, DEBUGGED VERSION ***

WINDOWS is undoubtedly one of the most widespread user interfaces within the
realm of computer technology. Due to the success of the IBM PC (and its many
clones) in the past decade, a demand eventually rose for other means of
communication than the DOS prompt; something like the graphical point-and-click
interface of the Apple Macintosh would be "kinda neat", some people thought.
WINDOWS was the answer.
WINDOWS was capable of performing almost every DOS command without demanding
any mental effort from the user (however, a great deal of patience was needed,
 because WINDOWS is so amazingly slow, that it is sometimes hard to tell if it
 is doing anything at all (a small joke on the behalf of the developers,
I suppose)).
"Kinda neat", people said. "Look, my PC has a GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE with
MOUSE POINTER and STUFF", people said, not realizing that virtually any
other system already had the same (like with graphics and sound cards, by
the way). "Kinda neat", the RAM manufacturers thought, knowing that WINDOWS
would create an instant and excessive demand for RAM, or else it would refuse to
run. "Kinda neat," Bill Gates thought, "I think I'll pretend that this is my
invention and make another billion". And so he did, although the whole lot is
ripped off from the MAC OS Finder & Amiga OS Intuitution. "Kinda neat", Intel
stockholders thought, "people will actually BEG us for faster processors". "Kinda
neat", the hardware dealers thought, "if we get them to believe that this thing is
a "must",then we will see them again upgrading in the near future!". And if a few
bewildered sheep actually failed to see the neatness, there was advertising
 a lot of it! And so, in spite of the sacrifices as for processor power
and RAM, and the total lack of multitasking, people were happy. They were
all happy. The emperor had got his new clothes.

Now, why do you need this system? BECAUSE this is NOT the official WINDOWS
from Microsoft, but an improved (yet compatible) version. In my effort to
disassemble the PC-version, I stumbled upon some minor flaws, which I have
done my best to correct when converting it. The program is written in assembler
for improved speed and efficiency, and as an extra bonus, the program doesn't
take up quite as much precious HD space or RAM as the original. The program
is written for Amiga, but even for some PC-users, it may be an advantage to
assemble the included source code and replace the old WIN.EXE file. So why
do you need this system? Here is why:

[*] It does just as much as the original WINDOWS, yet it is very much faster.
[*] The familiar WINDOWS feel is still there (as skilled programmers will tell
just from a quick glance at the code).
[*] All bugged and obsolete routines have been removed, which saves a lot of HD space.
[*] Uses less RAM than the original and instantly gives it back upon exit.
[*] It is machine independent, just assemble and run on virtually any processor.
[*] Benchmarks from the C64 show it to do just as much good as Microsoft WINDOWS
[*] on a PC486 --- only it is slightly faster!
[*] Thorough documentation of all advanced features.
[*] The full, commented source code for you to study and improve upon.

please note that it is BANANAWARE. To become a registered user, you must mail
a banana with your name to the queen of England in Buckingham Palace, and
within three weeks, you will recieve a registered version on a disk signed
by the queen herself. Also, it is strictly forbidden to run this program on
any machine involved in the production of anything containing pineapple.
This also applies to persons, who are involved in the production or
distribution of pineapples or who have relatives working with pineapples.
 I really hate pineapples.
A special rule applies to commercial software distributors. You are NOT
allowed to distribute this archive without the prior, written consent of
the PKK, the Khmer Rouge, Allan Cowboy, and Che Guevara (that was the catch).

History:
v0.9 (never released). A fully working version, but a little slower than
I had hoped.
v1.0 (this one!). Weeded out the last remaining, obsolete routines.
Removed two NOPs to gain speed.

Future:
In the near future, I hope to be able to add some additional graphics
(just for the kinda neat look of it), however I hope to be able to preserve speed.
Maybe some optimizing of the main programme to gain even more speed
(I already have a few ideas).

DESCRIPTION

        AmiKiss stands for Amiga Kisekae. Kisekae is Japanese for "changing
clothes". This is a popular game for little girls where they are given
paper dolls and a set of clothes to put on them. In particular,
numerous Kiss data can be found on the internet that feature collections
of popular Japanese Anime/Manga characters and sets of clothes that they
can try on. Kiss programs have been found already on Mac, PC, and X-window
platforms. AmiKiss is an Amiga implementation for playing Kiss.
The player can click and drag items of clothing onto the characters displayed
on the screen. Three sample data sets are provided with this archive.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        Requires AmigaDos version 2.04 or above.
        Amigaguide.library is needed and is included in archive.
        Should have at least 1 MB chip ram.

@node P5-2 "EyeCandy03"
TITLE

     EyeCandy03 - Generates various designs:
                  Spirograph(tm?) simulator of the spiral-drawing toy,
                  "YarnBall", "CircleStar", "RotoBoxes", "RotoAngle"
                  and "PolyGen".  Simple, fun and addictive!

VERSION

     This is version 03 which replaces EyeCandy02.
     See "NEW FEATURES" below for enhancements.

COMPANY

     No company, just an AMINET upload by "yours truly".

AUTHOR

     EyeCandy03 was written by me, Chuck Kenney.  My particulars
     (address, etc.) are included in the user document in the archive.

DESCRIPTION

     EyeCandy03 generates various "eye candy" graphics.  Currently these
     are:  "SpiroDraw", "YarnBall", "CircleStar", "RotoBoxes", "RotoAngle"
     and "PolyGen".  All designs have different values that can be changed
     by the user which dictate the final appearance of the designs.

     "SpiroDraw" simulates the SPIROGRAPH(tm?) drawing toy.
     "YarnBall" generates designs that look like balls of yarn.
     "CircleStar" generates designs that look like 3D checkerboard stars.
     "RotoBoxes" generates "spirally, tunnelly" designs using squares.
     "RotoAngle" is a bit like "RotoBoxes" but uses lines and angles.
     "PolyGen" generates "tunnelly" designs using concentric polygons.

     "EyeCandy" Allows the user to specify different values for many of
     the parameters which dictate the sizes and shapes of the designs -
     "Drawing Wheels, Drawing Rings", number of "YarnBall" spokes, sizes
     and angles of change, etc.  There is also a "Random" function for
     each design.  The use of a computer to generate the various SpiroDraw
     and other designs actually enhances some of the capabilities!
     "EyeCandy02" is all mouse-driven (MENUs, GADGETs, etc.).
     It is a fun _and_ addictive program!  .. but I'm biased, of course!

     EyeCandy03.lha also contains a very nice little freely distributable
     "screen-to-IFF" saver utility by Preben Nielsen (thanks, Preben) so
     that "EyeCandy" designs can be imported into and animated with
     "paint" programs.

     "EyeCandy" is shareware but does not nag the user in any way (except
     if the user selects the "About" MENU item) and all features are fully
     functional.

NEW FEATURES

     The major new enhancement is that EyeCandy can now accommodate
     font-sizes up to 15 (though 13 is the practical limit).

     A bug in the SpiroDraw "Set Data..." function, "In/Out" was fixed.

     User Selection of SCREEN resolution has been moved from a selection
     window into the main "Preferences" MENU.

     EyeCandy03 has also been compiled under a new version of the compiler,
     "ACE" by David Benn, which enabled further enhancement and enjoyment
     of the user-interface in terms of look, feel and functionality.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     There are no special requirements that I know of.
     EyeCandy03 has been tested on an Amiga 2000HD (OS 2.1)
     and an Amiga 1000 (OS 1.3).

HOST NAME

     EyeCandy03.lha has been uploaded to the AMINET site,
     ftp.etsu.edu (192.43.199.20) and is also available on
     all other AMINET sites.

DIRECTORY

     EyeCandy03.lha and EyeCandy03.readme reside in the
     "aminet/gfx/misc" directory.

FILE NAMES

     EyeCandy03.lha is 81,335 bytes long.

PRICE

     The asking shareware price is the amount sent to me by my first
     shareware contributor to SpiroDraw, EyeCandy's predecessor.
     This requested shareware fee is $5.00 (US), in the hope that
     many little sharewares will add up to more than a few bigger ones!

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     This program is freely distributable as long as the documentation
     accompanies the program but is a copyrighted (1994) shareware
     program by me, Chuck Kenney.  If this program is included in any
     CD-ROM collection, I ask that a copy of the CD-ROM be sent to me.

OTHER

     EyeCandy03, and other programs in progress are coming out of my
     basement as a result of the availability of a truly wonderful
     "BASIC-but-much-more!" compiler, "ACE" by David Benn.  I would
     like to sincerely thank Mr. Benn for renewing my enthusiasm in
     programming and for making it possible for me to make my programs
     available to more than just my friends and immediately family!

DESCRIPTION

   At last there is a product for the Amiga computer where young
   children can have fun learning about music! WindShadow Software has
   introduced "Making Music with Bertie Bunny". This is a product that
   is only available for the Commodore Amiga computer. It fully
   employs the multimedia capabilities of the computer.

   There are many features to enhance your enjoyment:

    - Fun for children of all ages. Even a 2 year old can "Bang Keys"
      to control Bertie. Bertie Bunny will  automatically move from
      place to place on the display. The child can simply bang on the
      keys to cause Bertie to choose an  instrument or tune.

      Older children can use the mouse. This makes it quicker to make
      selections and helps them to develop fine motor skills.

    - Learn to recognize the sound of various musical instruments.

    - Learn to recognize various musical tunes from one or more of 4
      different parts: the melody, a counterpoint to the melody,
      an obbligato  accompaniment or a rhythmic accompaniment.

    - Hear how different instruments sound in combination with each
      other.

    - Use the computer keyboard as a musical instrument. You can
      select which instrument sounds are to be used and then play
      notes (up to 4 at a time will sound) and see the corresponding
      key-presses on a piano keyboard.

    - Readily installs on a hard drive. Installation uses Commodore's
      Installer utility.  The Installer program is supplied
      under license from Commodore.

    - Supports the NTSC and PAL video standards and 6 languages.

    - Multitasks on the more powerful models of Amiga. Other
      software can run in the background at a low priority, for example,
      3D rendering, compiling large programs, or downloading batches of
      files.

    - the manual is in AmigaGuide format. The AmigaGuide program
      is supplied under license from Commodore.

   This product is unusual in that it is easy to use for children as
   young as 2 years old, while providing creative opportunities for
   older children to explore.

TITLE

        ProCrypt

VERSION

        Version 1.0

AUTHOR

        Mathias Kretschmer

DESCRIPTION

        ProCrypt is a brand new tool which encrypts the data on selected
        partitions. ProCrypt can be the perfect solution for your
        security problems.

        ProCrypt is a powerful program which protects your data from
        unauthorizied persons. It does so by encrypting blocks on a very
        low level of your device during writing and reading (in real
        time). If you access the file later for reading, the file gets
        decrypted at once.

        Once having ProCrypt installed (takes about 7 minutes) you will
        soon forget that there is an online-crypter working in the
        background. You will be able to continue your work without
        noticing any changes to your environment. The only
        difference will be the password request you have to enter after
        the crypted device is mounted.

        Everytime you boot your system ProCrypt will be started
        automatically by mounting the partitions which are crypted. This
        procedure can be "hidden" from foreign eyes. So they will never
        know that there is a crypter installed in your system.

FEATURES

        ProCrypt uses the two different algorithms for coding. Both are
        extremly secure. They differ sligtly in security and speed.

        All actions of ProCrypt are fully transparent. You will notice
        only a very slight delay during file operations. You don't have
        to worry about your files.

        Very secure system-lock and a simple but effective protection
        against random manipulation (ie. Viruses) of diskblocks integrated.

        ProCrypt has a graphical user interface but can get also started
        using manual editing of mountlist entries.

        For the easy installation process Installer (by Commodore) is
        used. Even unexperienced users will have no problems to install
        ProCrypt. An OnlineHelp (using HotHelp-System from
        Maxon-Computers) is also provided for easy explanation of
        advanced usage.

        ProCrypt is a carefully tested program (Enforcer/Mungwall and
        Resource-Tracking proofed). There have been serveral testers in
        germany.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        ANY Amiga and Kickstart/WB2.0+
        Maybe you should have a HardDrive but it also works
        with FloppyDisks.

DESCRIPTION

        ProxWatch is a localized font-sensitive clock program for the
        Amiga.

        ProxWatch  uses  a  template for printing the time and date in it's
        window. The default string is '%T' which prints the time only, e.g.
        '01:23:45'.

        You may change this by editing the tooltype WATCHSTRING.
        For example try:
                Date: %d.%m.%y - Time %T
        this may result in 'Date: 17.8.94 - Time: 16:59:12'


FEATURES

        o ProxWatch is a small utility for your WBStartup drawer.

        o The string used for displaying date and time is totally user
          definable.

        o The window can be opened on your favourite public screen.

        o Using a borderless backdrop window the watch text may be visually
          attached to the screen title.

    NLA:      14:101/200.60

DESCRIPTION

    `phonebill' is, simply said, a log file analyzer. What it basically
    does is scan log file(s) generated by a terminal program or a mailer,
    extract all information about calls you have made by using your modem,
    and store this in its own (short) format. After extracting the calls
    `phonebill' can generate various reports in which you can find
    information on duration and costs of the calls.

    Here is a small list of the main features:

     * Very flexible user-configurable rates, supporting exceptions for
       certain days and dates. Handles fees and time units with up to 9
       decimals (e.g. $1.2344657 dollars per 30.225678 seconds).

     * User-configurable log scanners: `phonebill' by default supports
       various log files, but for any log file that is not supported the
       user is able to create a scanner. The following is a list of log
       files that are already supported:
          * AutoPilot
          * CyberPager
          * GPFax
          * JrComm
          * MagiCall
          * MicroDot
          * Multifax (both v2.0 and Multifax professional)
          * NComm
          * Term action log and Term call log
          * Terminus
          * TheAnswer
          * TKR-BTX
          * Trapdoor
          * Trapfax
          * UUCP TimeLog
          * XenoLink

     * Log files can be automatically truncated if their size exceeds the
       maximum size.

     * Generates miscellaneous reports: statistics, total costs, ....

     * Context-sensitive online help.

     * Requires Kickstart 2.04 or higher.

     * Supports new 3.0 features (new look menus, ...).

     * Nice `Amiga User Interface Style Guide' conformant user interface.

NEW FEATURES

    The following is a list of the most significant changes:

     * Bug fix: Updating the binary log files on MC68000-amigas could
       crash because of reading from an odd address.

     * New: Hosts can be assigned to groups, over which reports can be
       generated seperately, for example: create a group called "Poll"
       and assign all hosts you poll for mail to this group.  Then you
       can view reports concerning these hosts only...

     * Changed: The cookie %a only accepted certain phonenumbers, which
       caused a lot of problems. Now %a accepts any string.  So now,
       "Calling %n (%a)" and "Calling BBS (123-AMI)" match.  "A BBS 123"
       and "%n %a" match too: name="A" nr="BBS 123", to resolve this "%n
        %A" should be used.

     * Added some average costs/calls/online per day to the stats.  Also,
       if the <to date> is set somewhere in the future, `phonebill' will
       estimate the total costs on that date (bill report).

     * Added German and Swedish catalogs, updated Swedish rates.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    Workbench 2.04 or higher.

@node P5-9 "C-Shell 5.39"
TITLE

     C-Shell (csh)

VERSION

     5.39

AUTHOR

     Andreas M. Kirchwitz (csh 5.20+),
     based on csh 5.19 by Urban D. Mueller

     E-Mail: csh-fan@zikzak.in-berlin.de

DESCRIPTION

     C-Shell is a replacement for the AmigaDOS command line interface.
     Many builtin Unix-like commands, very fast script language, file-
     name completion, command-name completion, comfortable command line
     editing, pattern matching, AUX: mode, object oriented file classes,
     abbreviation of internal and external commands.  Supports multiple
     users.

     C-Shell is easy to install and to use.  Online help for all
     commands, functions and various subjects.  ARP-free!

NEW FEATURES

     Changes since version 5.39 (summary):

      - New builtin variable "_timeout" (in microseconds) sets maximum
         response time for terminal to answer WINDOW STATUS REQUEST (for
         window bounds). Defaults to 1 (for local usage), must be set to
         higher value for remote connections. Only used, if window pointer
         is not available.
      - Removed command line length limitation (140 chars) for ARexx scripts
         that ends with ".rexx" but are started without the trailing ".rexx".
      - Removed command line length limitation (518 chars) for ARexx scripts
         and external shells (#! in first line), this was a limitation in
         AmigaOS' System() function.  DOS scripts still have this limitation,
         because you cannot RunCommand() "execute".
      - Not only "*" and "?" but also "[" and "]" recognized as AmigaDOS
         pattern. (that means, to use "[" and "]" you must quote (") or
         escape (\) them!)
      - ... and much more workarounds for serious bugs in DateToStr() and
         Locale.
      - Fixed bug: making an assign to an executable and calling the
         executable by its assign crashed machine.
      - Fixed bug: builtin command "cp" sometimes used already freed memory
         for generating error messages (resulted in some strange error
         messages).
      - New flag for for command abbreviation ($_abbrev):
         8, search DOS path-list if command wasn't found in Cshell's
         internal program hash list (see "rehash" command)
      - CTRL-D now shows matching files if current word is not a directory.
         (if directory then shows contents of directory -- as usual)
         In its current implementation this may have unexpected side effects
         if current word is already a pattern.
      - Class definition for AmigaE in class.sh
      - Now internal timer (eg, %e in the titlebar) not set to zero when a
         null command is encountered. (same for return code, %x in titlebar)
      - The idea of always using the variable "_dirformat" for "dir" wasn't
         a good idea.  So, "_dirformat" is only used if option -z is given
         (when "_dirformat" is unset then use first argument as format
         string).
      - New control-code for line-editing: "^V" (ctrl-v) quotes next char.
      - New builtin variable "_kick" holds version number of Operating
         System.
      - Builtin command "assign" now prints volume name if assign points to
         an unmounted volume (eg, a removed floppy disk) and doesn't pop up
         a requester "Please replace volume ..."
      - It was a stupid idea to force redirecting of all Cshell-related
         system requesters to CSH's screen, because requester windows
         inherit the window title of their "initiator". They appear now
         again on your default public screen.
      - Fixed serious bug (crashed machine) with redirection and launching
         programs into background. (files closed twice)
         Known bug: it's still not possible to run pipes into background...
      - When running programs into background (run, rback, &), internal
         commands and aliases are recognized and executed with "csh -c".
         Aliases WON'T be resolved on this level so they must be declared
         in .cshrc to run them into background.
      - Execution of Rexx-Scripts (without trailing ".rexx") and any other
         program with "#! my_prog" or ";! my_prog" in first line of script
         now possible also from DOS search path and not only $_path.
      - New builtin variable "_mappath" (see manual), enables pathname-
         mapping for commands if script starts with "#!" or ";!" in first
         line.  Converts Unix pathes like "/usr/..." to "usr:...".
      - New option "-w" for Cshell, don't use window pointer (useful for
         KingCON).
      - New option "-V" for Cshell, send only VT100 compatible control
         sequences.
      - Internal variable "o_vt100" now used (if option -t or -V is set),
         don't send control sequences that are not VT100 compatible (eg,
         special Amiga control sequences).
      - Various changes/enhancements to existing commands.
      - Miscellaneous bug fixes.
