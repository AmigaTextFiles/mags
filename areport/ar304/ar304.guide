Oh, how many limbs I would give for a resolution to this soap opera that is
the liquidation of Commodore International, Limited and its holdings.

Has anything happened?  Not really.  I haven't received any news from the
UK group.  CEI's Alex Amor has been haggling with his investment group for
the past couple of weeks, and MAYBE will put in a new bid this week.

A new rumor has surfaced about two new bidders.  As of now, I can't confirm
or deny anything, because I haven't even heard the entire rumor yet.

Hoo boy.

In the meantime, Doug MacGregor, President of Commodore Canada, once again
denied that his company was selling newly manufactured Amigas.  In essence,
Commodore Canada is slowly sliding towards the liquidation-they're still
able to pay their bills, but with no new Amigas to sell, it's difficult to
keep running a company that's supposed to be selling Amigas.

In case you sent something to Amiga Report, for my perusal or for the
magazine, and don't see it this issue or haven't seen a response yet, don't
be too upset: we had too much material this issue and my bbs.xnet.com mail
site has been down most of the week.

So, what's on the horizon?  Well, we've got some things in mind for Amiga
Report, both based on the surveys we've seen and our own schemings.
Speaking of which, the survey ends soon, so your last chance to get in your
opinion (and a chance to win a Light-ROM CD) is upon you...

It becomes more and more bizarre...but keep the faith.

Jason

P.S. If you had any doubts about Amiga development, check out the FTP
Announcements section.  It's rather large this time around...Also, some of
the prices in the Editor's Choice section have dropped, so if you were
scared away before, give it another look.

Well he's back!

Saw your article.  Wish I would have read it Thursday!

There is a user on the net going by the email address of
MAHZTER@delphi.com.  He's using the name of David Miller but his M.O.  is
the same and the address he gave me was:

2486 Lincoln Way East 76-107
Massiloon, Ohio 44646
216-683-7983

Taka was given the following information:

2316 Lincoln Way East
Massilon, OH 44657
216-683-7881  (notice the number? ;) )

I know of at least two other guys who were taken for cash.  This guy is
friendly and quite knowledgeable about Amiga's.  He won't take COD because
he claims he has had too many people send stuff back.  He also suggests
sending a Western Union wire right before hanging up to "help speed things
along!" I have contacted the Massiloon Police Department (216-830-1735) and
a detective Hendricks (216-830-1749) has been assigned the case.  I'm
suppose to call him back Monday morning around 9:00am.  The Feds will
probably be brought in.  I'll relay your article to Detective Hendricks on
Monday.

I've been leaving rather mild warnings in c.s.a.marketplace to discourage
new "marks" but I don`t want to scare this guy into closing up shop and
moving to another city before the police can find him.  If he does I think
we need to put out the "NET" looking for the clown to surface again and I'm
sure he will.  It would be nice to find any contacts in the Ohio area
around these two cities.  I'm going to look them up tonight on my atlas.

We have enough problems right now in the Amiga community without bastards
like this one.  I WANT TO PUT HIS ASS IN JAIL!!!

I would be more than happy to compile a list of victims for the police.  If
your newsletter would like to get the word out, I'll take information at
this e-mail address.

BTW: Someone sells CD's containing the directory listings for the entire
US.  If one of your readers has access to this information maybe they can
do a search on the phone numbers I've provided.

Hello!
I would like to make a comment on this "Phoenix" deal.  First, the largest
portion of the Amiga market lie in Europe.  Most of us European's do not
speak English as our first language, "Phoenix" isn't a very easy word,
people will have trouble not only writing it, but maybe even pronouncing it
right.

2nd.  50 million other things already use this name !  Also, the
pronouncements in all countries will be different, "Amiga" is a basic word,
and most countries do not have a problem differing it from "Omega" like
some do..

Opel Omega
Opel Amiga.

BIG difference, maybe not for Englishmen and Americans?  For Germans and
Scandinavians etc.  it's not even close.  But how will 'Phoenix' be
handled in the different countries ?

A Swede could hear the word from a friend and then he might write it like
"Finix"...  and the PC-nerds in Sweden might call it for "f}n-ix", sort of
like "silly-ix".

Anyway, can't we just end this stupid "Phoenix" campaign now ?  It just
doesn't make any good sense, wow...  because some 'rise and return from the
ashes' nonsence ?  or what ?  I say...  bah!  :) Why not "The Amiga Vision
5000" just as well ?

Kind regards,
Fredrik

Might it be easier to add features to Linux or NetBSD, than to try to
rewrite an entire existing OS, make significant enhancements to it (like
retargetable graphics, for the 64-bit graphics cards the "rest of the
world" are moving on to), catch up with improvements made to competing OSes
while you're doing it and then try to persuade application developers to
produce new versions to run on your new platforms?

A DEC Alpha running AmigaOS would be a great system to play with, but the
only things you could run on it would be stuff you have the source to, and
which doesn't make too many assumptions about word length etc.  (apart from
the stuff running under any 680x0 emulator that might be part of this
project).

DEC managed to move from VAX to Alpha, Sun from 680x0 to Sparc, HP from
680x0 to HP-PA, so it is possible, but none of those people had to reverse
engineer the existing OS, and working in assembly is more common on the
Amiga.  On the other hand, if someone doesn't succeed in buying Commodore
soon, rewriting the OS might be the only way we'll ever see a new version.

[Eric Rainbolt provided a detailed tutorial on how to escape Amiga Beige
through marbelizing.  Yuri Tacher took him up on it...]

From: Yuri Tacher
Subject: Marble-ized Amiga

The aches and pains of marble-izing an AMiga 4000.  (And doubts and fears.
:)

Well, after reading the article in AR about marbleizing your Amiga I
decided I was sick of my ugly A4000 case and thought "why not?" I purchased
the Black Onyx kit after looking for it for almost a week.  I finally hit
upon an art supply house that had 2 kit's left (phew!) I bought one of them
for the grand total of $34 bucks.  Not bad I say.  With instruction manual
in hand, I proceded to sand my computers plastic parts (with a cloud of
friends telling me it wasnt going to work, and I'd have the UGLIEST amiga
in Mexico) Goood friends suporting me all the way :)

I decided to do my A4000, my 1960 monitor and the keyboard, so I took them
apart and washed them first, then started sanding the back panel on the
monitor first (not visible if I screwed up) Sanding in small square
patterns It took me all of 7 hours sand everything CAREFULLY.  Then I
decided my nerves where dead for the day, so I took a rest :)

The next day I decided now was the time to die (or end up with the coolest
amiga in Mexico :) And proceded to paint the plastic parts as per the
instructions which I might add, are pretty well written.  Over the next 2
days I aplied the base coat and let it dry.  A black A4000 is WAY cool!
but I wanted marble, so I went ahead with the process :).  Now, in AR and
in the kits manual, they say not to be too carefull when putting on the
veins, and thats true :) I was so nervous (after sanding the machine and
having it look nice, I just wanted to stoip there) But if you are nervous,
the veins come outgreat!

So, after 4 days, I put my now VERY cool looking Amiga back together, and
my fellow amigans are royally pissed off, because the kits finished, and
I am the only one that had the guts to do it, and now I'm the ONLY one
with a marble-Amiga :) And with NetBSD running, people think I have a NeXT
machine.  :) So, if you wanted to try out that little project, go ahead,
it loks GREAT!  :)

For Immediate Release                                   January 1, 1995

 The Premiere Third Party Developer for DLG Professional BBS/OS (DLG) has
purchased all rights for DLG BBS/OS from TelePro Technologies.

              Bold Move Re-Affirms Faith in Amiga BBS Market!

        Phoenix, Arizona - Automated Telephone Information Systems (ATIS)
has purchased TelePro Technologies (TPT) of Red Deer, Alberta, Canada.
ATIS is a software technology company, developing automated solutions to
tedious and expensive business problems, including voice response systems
for use in the research industry under DOS and OS/2 platforms.  TPT is the
original designer and creator of a bulletin board system for the Amiga
platform called "DLG Pro BB/OS" in the late 1980's.

        The purchase of TPT includes all sources and rights to DLG Pro
BBS/OS, the only Amiga "bulletin board operating system" in existence. 
This move signals that ATIS is committed to strongly supporting all
existing users, as well as developing a new generation of software.  This
bold move also signifies a resurgence of interest in developing high
quality, dependable and reliable software for the Amiga platform.  It is
the intent of ATIS to redefine the standards that all bulletin board system
software be judged against.

        ATIS has acquired the entire database of DLG Pro Customers and will
be informing current DLG Pro BBS/OS owners of the new ownership.  This will
also include information regarding software upgrades, compatibility lists,
bulletin board lists, third party developer support and annual newsletters.
Information regarding the imminent release of V2.0, along with a list of
upgraded features will be released very shortly.

        ATIS's development and marketing team consists of Steve Lewis, Greg
Bastow and Jeff Webster.  As the author of DLGMail, selected from among
several Fidonet mail processing software candidates for license and
inclusion with DLG Pro BB/OS by TPT, Steve brings several years of hands-on
experience in working with the software and source code.  Steve also wrote
several other modules under the label of PDQMail Utilities that finish
integrating Fidonet and DLG Pro.

        Greg Bastow was a part of the original beta team for DLG Pro BBS/OS
V1.0, and has pushed the software to its limits running Tunnel-Vision BBS,
a 4 node multiline system with 6.2 gigabytes of storage, 4 CD-ROM drives
and over 700 users - running in 5 networks including Usenet, and operating
as a regional hub in many of these networks.  Greg has also been involved
with numerous beta products over the years and brings his development and
design knowledge with him.

        Jeff Webster is the new recruit into the DLG Pro domain, though he
has always shown tremendous enthusiasm, creativity and skill in programming
the Amiga.  Jeff has been authoring software for several years.

        ATIS is confident that with the development team in place, they
will set new standards that bulletin board system designers of all
platforms will strive for.  Fully expanding and enhancing the already
stable DLG Pro v1.0 product, one that takes full advantage of the many
unique advantages of the Amiga's operating system, is the goal of ATIS.

{Disclaimer.  I do not take any responsibility for any damages incurred by
trying the things in my article.  Take it as a guideline.  If you are not
comfortable with these procedures, ask a more experienced friend, or your
user group.  Remember, I will not take responsibility}

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
        What scares me late at night, is not the threat of nuclear war in
Korea, the late night talk show circuit contest, nor the demise of the
Amiga.  Actually, it's the fear of my happy little Amiga 3000 overheating.
I've never really given much thought to my two other Amigas-the 2000 was
always cool, and ran for days without trouble, and the 500, well I just
didn't care.  But my newly acquired A3000/25 is my most cherished piece of
computing hardware-something I can depend on when everything else is
falling to pieces.  So when my Amiga 3000 began to overheat, I decided to
look into finding extra ways to keep my machine cool.

        First off, let me describe my A3000 configuration-an original LP52S
hard disk, plus 2MB of standard 3000 DIPs.  In addition, a SupraRAM 2000/2
memory board, a A2300 genlock, the ever amusing A2088D bridgeboard, and an
XT Tecmar board.  I recently was given a 20MB SCSI hard disk as a gift, a
rather hot running Miniscribe.

        {which makes me ask, when visiting a friend, is a hard disk a good
gift?  Usually, I bring chocolates, or maybe a cheesecake I've baked
myself.  And what does one offer, when presented a hard disk?  Offer a
danish pastry, or some cheap instant coffee?}

Suggestions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Let's take a look at some of the things you can do to keep your
hardware cool.  Many are things we take for granted, but read it.  You may
be forgetting something.  Simple environment things:

1.  Keep Your Environment Healthy-For you and your Amiga.  Make sure it's
ventilated, cool, and clean.  Dust is a killer.  Change your air
conditioner filters.  Non Amiga using householders will thank you too!  
Dust will get into your fan filters, making your life miserable and keeping
air from leaving your machine.  {vacuum, often!  I sound like a
househusband.  I decided to wipe down all my working surfaces, plus do a
good clean up}

2.  Place Your Amiga Well-Don't put it in the sun, next to a radiator.  
Think smart about how heat rises-and moves inside your working area.  {I
placed my A3000 in front of a window, facing north.  Which isn't a great
idea, but the only spot in my room.  I remember to close my drapes in the
daytime} Also, make sure nothing blocks the back of your machine, give at
least six inches behind your computer.  For those with those every popular
hutch type desks, remove the particle board panel to allow proper air flow.

              And now, some more important hardware things:

1.  Remove Unused Hardware-There are some, who like every piece of
hardware they own attached to their Amiga simultaneously.  My
recommendation-Take it off!  Genlocks don't need to be powered at all
times-and if you do, they will age faster and restrict you from certain
screenmodes.  Likewise, other things don't need to be online, like your
modem.  Turn it off.  And for those of you with one button powerbars,
consider one that has multiple switches to selectively control what you
have on and off.  Increased heat, even from external devices, will
generate extra heat in the room.  {in my case, I removed my 2088
Bridgeboard and XT expansion card, plus my genlock.  I returned them to my
A2000.  Don't worry, more silly Bridgeboard articles will come}

2.  Heat Sinks-Some chips in your Amiga will run hot.  Buy some heat sinks,
which are little funny shaped metal things that dissipate heat from hot
components and some heat sink grease to attach them-they aren't glued on
though.  You can find both at a Radio Shack store.  Be careful about
applying the grease.  Read the manual.

3.  Place Expansion Cards Wisely-{I made the stupid mistake of placing my
2MB RAM card on the lower slot, below the genlock, XT bridgecard, and XT
expander.  I removed the three cards, as above, and placed the SupraRam at
the top of the machine, so heat from the motherboard would escape though my
secondary fan (see below) and heat from the RAM card would be drawn out via
the main fan} RAM cards generate the most heat, followed by hard disks.
Place them correctly.  For you lucky folks with 2000's and 3000/4000T's,
space your cards out if you have the free slots.  It's rather stupid to
place your accelerator, hard disk controller, and graphics board all next
to each other, when you have five slots to fill.   Space them evenly, if
possible.  The Amiga's autoconfig doesn't care if you place them all in a
line, or spread out.  Some cards must be in certain spots-do the best to
place cards around them.  Also-the 3000 and 4000 bridge slots are
dynamically allocated-unlike the 2000 design, where placement of your
bridgecard determines how many Zorro's you have, the new machines let you
place cards all over.

4.  Clean Your Fan-While it may be dangerous to open your power supply,
where the fan is-some machines will have a fan filter, which should be
easily removable.  If not, remove the power supply from the machine,
remembering where everything is connected, and use a powerful vacuum
cleaner and suck out all the dirt and dust.

5.  Take Off All Decorative Duct Tape-Actually, be careful, sometimes, we
think we're quite stylish in placing duct tape over strategic areas.  The
ventilation grilles on the front of the 2000 and 3000 have a purpose.  So
do the grilles on the top of console type machines.  Same goes for leaving
papers propped up in front of our Amigas and on top too.

Amiga Fan Club:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        And now, the special part of this article.  A do it yourself, extra
fan project.  I take no responsibility for your actions, by the way.  And
opening your Amiga does void the warranty.  Okay!  The idea here is to
install an extra fan into your machine to draw more air out.  Other ideas:
Buy a dual fan card, for about $69 dollars.  Or, remove the existing fan,
and add a more powerful one.

1.  Get a fan.  (make an album, promote it...apply all Latoya Jackson jokes
here.) Fans can be purchased at most electronics stores.  I ventured out to
Active Surplus here in Toronto, Canada.  It's on Queen West, if you need to
know.  They look like little black frames-more or less like the fan on the
back of your machine.  Good brands are Boxer and Panaflo.   First, make
sure it's a DC Brushless type.  Brushless fans generate less electric
noise, meaning better for computers.  Next, examine what kind of voltage
and what kind of power draw it has.  My Microboxer was a 12V, 0.10 Amp
model.  Your Amiga should be able to generate both 12V and 5V.  DC, by the
way.  Look at how much air it blows out.  Air flow is measured in cubic
feet per minute.  Compare numbers and prices.  My fan was $6.00 Canadian. 
It should end in two wires.  Some may have a convenient header block.  Let
them show you a demo unit.  Feel the air coming out.  Is it strong?  Or
weak?

2.  Take the fan home and open your Amiga.  Find a good spot for it to
sit.  I opened up a few unused expansion slots on my A3000, and put it on
the back, sitting it on the little "ledge" in the expansion card port
area.  I attached it with twist ties, wrapping around opened slot covers
and the like.  Strategically placing hardware allowed me to put the fan
where it could suck through the open slot covers.  Placing a fan requires
knowledge of how air is supposed to flow around your specific machine. 
For instance, on an A3000, air is sucked through the back left, across the
expansion slots and motherboard, over in a U shape around the drive area
and back out through the power supply and normal fan on the rear right. 
By adding a fan sucking in (make sure you're sucking or blowing, wherever
appropriate-god that's sick) at the back left, I increase airflow in the
way Commodore intended, cooling the components.  If you have conflicting
airflows because you put the fan in the wrong place, or set the polarity
wrong, then you'll have trouble.  On the A2000, air is sucked from the
front grille across all the components out the back right on the power
supply.  This is rather stupid sometimes, because it sucks dust through
your internal floppies.  A good place in my view to put a secondary fan
would be blowing out on the left rear.

3.  Attach the fan via a spare molex 4 pin connector (male) to a drive
power cable from your power supply.  The centre two are ground, and the
outer two are five and 12 volts positive DC.  Make sure your fan is either
5 or 12 VDC!  You may need a small piece of electricians tape or rubber
band to keep the connector snug.  The result system will look like this:

         ____               |
        |    |------[||]----|
        |____|------[||]----|
                            |
         fan        molex     PS
                    connectors

4.  Close up your Amiga and replace everything making sure the fan works
the way you want before you put in the screws.

THE GIF CONTROVERSY: A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER'S PERSPECTIVE

    GIF and Graphics  Interchange Format are  service marks of  CompuServe
    Inc.,  an H&R Block  Company. PostScript is  a registered trademark of
    Adobe Systems Inc. TIFF is a trademark of Aldus Corp.

During the past eight years, GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) has
peacefully become the most popular file format for archiving and exchanging
computer images.  At the end of December 1994, CompuServe Inc.  and Unisys
Corporation announced to the public that developers would have to pay a
license in order to continue to use technology patented by Unisys in
certain categories of software supporting the GIF format.  These first
statements caused immediate reactions and some confusion.

This is a very interesting case, which could teach more than one lesson on
the theory and practice of software and the laws.  There are many entities
involved.  Fingers have been pointed at lawmakers, Unisys, CompuServe and
developers.  In theory, it may have been possible for any or all of these
parts to prevent the matter from creating so much anxiety in the first
place.  Yet we are all here, debating on this issue.  This article intends
to provide a collection of information from the history of the controversy
to the most recent events, as they were perceived by a software developer.

CompuServe released GIF as an open specification in 1987.  GIF soon became
a world standard, and today it also plays an important role in the Internet
community.  It was well supported by CompuServe's Information Service, but
many developers wrote (or acquired under license) software supporting GIF
without even needing to know that a company named CompuServe existed.  GIF
was relatively simple, and very well documented in books, articles and text
files.

GIF images are compressed to reduce the file size.  The technique used to
compress the image data is called LZW (after Lempel-Ziv-Welch) and was
first described by Terry A.  Welch in the June 1984 issue of IEEE's
Computer magazine.  Unisys holds a patent on the procedure described in the
article, but the article describing the algorithm had no mention of this. 
The LZW procedure was simple and very well described, and it soon became a
very popular technique for data compression (just as GIF would become a
standard in its own field).  It appears that neither CompuServe, nor the
CompuServe Associate who designed GIF, nor the computer environment in
general were aware of the patent.  GIF is not alone in the use of LZW.  The
TIFF file specification also includes LZW-compression among its compression
methods, and so do dozens of very popular file archiving programs (such as
Compress).

Normally, procedures such as LZW are published on magazines so that they
can be shared by the community of software developers.  LZW itself is a
refinement of other algorithms published in the years before (Ziv-Lempel
and others).  Software is usually protected by copyright law, but in recent
years (since around 1981 in the USA) in several countries it has become
possible to patent software.  While software patents have become an
opportunity for many, they remain a controversial danger for others.  Any
programmer or publisher might be trapped at any time by a patent
infringement claim that could not be foreseen or avoided.

While having the right to pursue legal action or seek damages against
infringing LZW developers and publishers, Unisys has so far been very
accomodating and fair.  It is likely that the success of LZW and its
thousands of implementations, especially among small developers, caught
Unisys unprepared.  Otherwise, it would be difficult to understand how
Unisys could first allow a very large number of small and big developers to
use LZW for years, and then, after the establishment of various standards
based on LZW, change its attitude.

The original CompuServe/Unisys licensing agreement text which had upset so
many developers was immediately followed by clarifications from both
CompuServe and Unisys.  Given that the on-line community tends to be
suspicious about anything that is big, has a legal department or owns
software patents, Unisys had to face a particularly delicate challenge. 
But it probably wasn't easier for CompuServe, who had to explain the patent
issue to its own developers, some of whom felt "betrayed".  The outside
world would learn about this issue from the press in the following days.
Even Time magazine reported about this matter, although like most of the
newspapers it concentrated on GIF more than on TIFF, LZW, Unisys or
software patents.  The full texts of four official statements from
CompuServe and Unisys are included at the end of this article (scan this
text for #1).

Among the first reactions, some bulletin board systems had all GIF files
deleted from their hard disks (or converted into JPEG format).  Common
remarks included:

    "PROTEST OF NEW COMPUSERVE-UNISYS GIF USAGE TAX !!"

    "They [CompuServe] seem to think that GIF is the greatest thing
    since free online magazines."

    "The announcement by CompuServe and Unisys that users of the GIF
    image format must register by January 10 and pay a royalty or face
    lawsuits for their past usage, is the online communications
    community's equivalent of the sneak attack at Pearl Harbor."

These reactions may require some clarification.

GIF files are not covered by the patent.  There is no risk in distributing
GIF files or in using the GIF name.  According to a CompuServe
spokesperson, "Recent discussions of GIF taxes and fees are totally without
merit.  For people who view GIF images, who keep GIF images on servers, or
who are creating GIF images for distribution, the recent licensing
discussions have no effect on their activities."

Only the software employing the LZW algorithm for writing GIF files is "at
risk".  The Unisys patent includes claims which specifically cover the
decompression of LZW-compressed material, so it may also affect simple GIF
readers.  However, it is in theory possible to create and read GIF files
without using the LZW procedure.  Some developers have produced results
which are similar, if not equivalent, to the LZW algorithm, basing their
routines for compression of binary data and text on Shannon-Fano and AVL
trees.

Unisys, and not CompuServe, has been "trying to impose" a royalty.  The
problem is not specific to GIF, but includes TIFF and archiving software. 
However, it was later clarified that "...  Unisys does not intend to pursue
previous inadvertent infringement by versions of GIF-based software
products marketed prior to 1995...  Unisys does not require licensing, or
fees to be paid, for non-commercial, non-profit GIF-based applications,
including those for use on the on-line services..."

The most popular computer systems still have display and memory
configurations which make them considerably more efficient in displaying
palette-based images.  This is 8-bit indexed data, as supported by the GIF
format.  The creation of a palette-based picture may take hours of
professional color quantization and remapping applied to 24-bit data, in
order to achieve 8-bit results which cannot easily be distinguished from
the original.  The resulting GIF files can quickly be processed with
minimum RAM requirements.

JPEG is excellent for many applications, but it is not an alternative to
GIF.  Unlike GIF, JPEG is lossy (i.e.  it changes the images as they are
compressed) and it does not support palette-based images.  Also, it was not
designed with professional high-resolution images in mind.

CompuServe stated: "CompuServe is announcing that we will coordinate the
development of GIF24, a successor to GIF capable of 24-bit lossless
compression.  CompuServe is committed to keeping GIF24 as an open
specification, available without cost."

The CompuServe licensing agreement was intended as a voluntary service to
the few dozen developers creating software for use primarily in conjunction
with the CompuServe Information Service (CIS).  This includes applications
such as CompuServe "navigators", but does not apply to general purpose GIF
readers/writers (which are not intended for use primarily in conjunction
with CIS).

Any organization using LZW should look at whether they have an infringement
on Unisys' patent.  CompuServe is not involved in any of these discussions
- they are between Unisys and outside developers.

Other interesting considerations emerged.  For example, there is more than
one patent involved.  Lempel, Ziv, Cohn and Eastman patented their original
LZ78 algorithm (US patent 4,464,650).  One Internet leader has collected
information on more than 350 patents on lossless data compression and 100
on lossy image compression.  The LZW algorithm which is now attracting so
much attention is patented by both IBM (4,814,746) and Unisys (4,558,302).
The IBM patent application was filed three weeks before that of Unisys, but
the US patent office apparently failed to recognize that they covered the
same algorithm.  (The IBM patent is more general, but its claim 7 is said
to be exactly LZW.)

The LZW patent issue first surfaced in the press in 1989, when the BTLZ
algorithm (a procedure similar to LZW developed and patented by British
Telecom) was to be approved for data compression into the V.42bis modem
standard.  Unisys said on at least one occasion that it first began to
learn of the widespread use of LZW in connection with the development of
this standard.  The first licensing arrangements put into place included
those with modem manufacturers ($ 20,000 for each one-time license) and
with Adobe PostScript developers ($ 10,000).

An article on "LZW Data Compression" was published in the October 1989
issue of Dr.  Dobb's Journal (see bibliography for more details - scan this
text for #3).  A reader replied in the December issue explaining that the
algorithm was patented.  The author of the article added that he was
unaware of any patent on the algorithm.  More readers wrote, and in the
March 1990 issue the editor-in-chief dedicated his Editorial to this topic,
which in his words "sparked a forest of fires".  The same issue also
contained an official statement by Unisys Corporation, which confirmed that
LZW was patented, mentioned the modem industry, and indicated how
developers could contact Unisys.

In the October 2, 1989 issue of PC Week a columnist wrote:

    "Alas, there's no consolation for developers of archiving programs
    that rely on the LZW data-compression algorithm. While cruising
    the bulletin boards last week, Spencer learned that Unisys has a
    patent on the algorithm, upon which a slew of data-compression
    programs are based. Watch out."

Probably in the same period, an article in InfoWorld mentioned modem
manufacturers paying or agreeing to pay royalties to Unisys for the right
to use LZW.

The better informed developers were aware of the LZW patent, and this issue
was debated among a small group of members of the CompuServe PICS Forum
(now GRAPHSUP).  The general feeling at that time was that "Unisys only
intends to get royalties from hardware vendors," and there was some
consensus on the idea that Unisys "wouldn't do anything about pure software
implementations."

Until the end of 1994, debates on CIS show no clear mention of the
requirement to get a license from Unisys for using LZW in GIF applications.
During 1988 at least one developer stopped working on GIF tools because of
considerations regarding the LZW patent, and reportedly "made CIS aware of
it".  This apparently was limited to private verbal conversations, and
information on this behalf could be found neither in the press nor in CIS.

Page 132 ("LZWEncode Filter") of the PostScript Language Reference Manual,
Second Edition, published in December 1990, contains the address of the
Welch Licensing Department at Unisys Corporation.

At this point, at least the readers of some publications were potentially
aware of the LZW patent.  But still, there was no link to GIF.  Unisys
apparently didn't know about GIF, nor did most GIF developers know that GIF
contained LZW technology.  And those who may have known, not necessarily
knew about the patent.

Among the developers who contacted Unisys between the end of 1990 and the
beginning of 1991, there was at least one GIF developer.  He recently
described his experience:

    "Finding the right person was the most difficult part of licensing
    LZW, but hopefully it's easier today (perhaps only 5 phone calls
    would be needed!)... When talking to Unisys back then, my
    recollection is that we had to basically tell the people at
    Unisys, 'Believe me, you DO own a patent on LZW; who do we talk to
    about LICENSING?' When we finally reached the licensing/legal
    department, THEY knew they had a patent, and spelled out the
    terms. I recall the person we were dealing with saying something
    like, 'They [Unisys] laugh when I make all these $1 deals, but we
    have to charge something to protect the patent.'"

The standard back then for PC based software products was $1 per copy sold
(or a 1% royalty), after a $100 advance payment.  Apparently, Unisys still
didn't know that GIF was based on LZW.  In January 1995, Unisys stated:
"Two years ago, Unisys learned that the LZW method was incorporated in the
GIF specification and immediately began negotiations with CompuServe in
January of 1993.  We reached agreement with CompuServe on licensing the
technology in June 1994..."

Two years before that, at the end of 1992, Cloanto, an Italian software
house, contacted Unisys because it was originally interested in a license
for the possible use of LZW in its PostScript Level 2 drivers.  That
correspondence also mentioned GIF and TIFF as using LZW, and anticipated
some of the controversies which would follow 25 months later.  Unisys
replied: "...  You raise a number of interesting issues which require
consideration..."

While disclosing the full contents of this correspondence would probably
not serve anyone's interest, the text of two letters sent to Unisys in 1992
is included at the end of this article (scan this text for #2), because the
author feels that this 1992 perspective could complement the article with a
few interesting ideas.  The letters have not been edited, so some details
(such as the reference to ZIP) may be incomplete with respect to current
knowledge.

Unisys offered Cloanto a $ .25 per unit royalty (1% of the net income) as
an alternative to the PostScript one-time license, but did not directly
answer the question risen by Cloanto: "If we implemented a software GIF or
TIFF image file loader and saver (both formats are based on the LZW
algorithm), would we need a license from Unisys Corp., as far as U.S.  
Patent 4,558,302 is concerned?".  According to public statements, Unisys
did however contact CompuServe the following month.

Between 1993 and 1994, the majority of developers still didn't know that
GIF employed a patented algorithm, although both Unisys and CompuServe were
aware of this, as the developers would learn in December 1994.  Different
opinions have been expressed on this.  Some developers feel that reaching
an agreement behind the scenes was the least destructive thing that could
be done.  Other (at times passionate) opinions picked up on electronic
media are similar to these three:

    "Consider this. CompuServe admits to knowing about patent problems
    with the GIF file format as early as January of 1993. ... [We]
    added GIF support... months after CompuServe admits knowledge of
    the patent problem... We relied on the information that was
    supplied to us by CompuServe. If CompuServe had told us the truth
    when they knew it, we never would have added GIF support..."

    "If I chose to put GIF encode/decode functions in my software
    development toolkits, my main threat of legal liability would not
    come from Unisys, but rather from one of my customers being sued
    by Unisys, who would turn around and sue me for selling them some
    code that contained patented algorithms."

    "I still don't have a clue what my situation is if I want to sell
    source and object code that imports and exports GIF images. I am
    not in the end-user app business, but my customers are, and they
    certainly will have to have an LZW license, but what about me?
    I've talked with Unisys by voice and E-mail, and the voice
    discussion was entirely unsatisfactory as I posted when it
    happened - basically the Unisys guy said anyone who sells code for
    $100-$300 a pop was a total _____ for selling it that cheap. The
    E-mail discussions I've had said 'OK - we hear you - we'll get
    back to you.' Never happened."

Unisys replied in part with reassuring clarifications to the general
public, explaining that if the software was developed prior to 1995, or if
it is public domain or freeware, the developer need not to worry.

On January 27, 1995, Unisys announced new licensing policies regarding "The
Welch Patent".  These include a .45% royalty on the total unit selling
price of GIF/LZW products (minimum $0.10, maximum $10.00 per unit) and a
.65% royalty on GIF/TIFF/LZW products (minimum $0.20, maximum $25.00).  For
further information and a copy of the written agreement it is possible to
call Unisys at +1 215 986-4411.

While this enables many software publishers to again ship their products
after a month-long pause, other GIF developers prefer to wait and see how
this situation further evolves.  One developer asked "What if I sign up and
then they announce a new GIF specification which does not use LZW?"

Some of the most active developers prefer to collaborate on the design of a
patent-free evolution of GIF (and TIFF's LZW compression mode). 
Suggestions can be sent via E-mail to GIF24@csi.compuserve.com when sending
from the Internet, or CSI:GIF24 when sending from CompuServe.

Several backwards compatibility issues related to GIF24 are currently being
evaluated by CompuServe and by the other communities participating in this
cooperative project.  Examples of contributions from third parties include
the specification for a "GEF" graphics-exchange format, and the experience
gathered by the developers of the GZIP procedures for data compression.

At the end, it appears that if so many efforts converge into a new,
improved standard, we still have to give part of the credit to the LZW
patent...

    Any comments, or experience you would like to share, would

Unisys Clarifies Policy Regarding Patent Use in On-Line Service Offerings

The concerns, inquiries and some apparent confusion that have resulted from
the December CompuServe advisory clearly indicate that we need to clarify
our policy concerning the use of the Unisys Lev Zempel Welch [Lempel Ziv
Welch] (LZW) patent by software developers for the major on-line services.

We want to reiterate earlier communications that the issue of patent
licenses is not focused on the end users of on-line networks, including the
Internet.  We encourage end users to continue to take full advantage of the
outstanding benefits of a rapidly growing on-line community.

Unisys was awarded the patent in 1985.  We became aware of the increasing
interest in our LZW patent beginning in 1990 when many companies approached
us to license the patent for their hardware and software products.  The
growth in the use of compression technology was mushrooming in order to
meet the demands for transmitting increased amounts of data.  To date, more
than 100 companies, including hardware, software and on-line information
services, have licensed the Unisys LZW technology.

Two years ago, Unisys learned that the LZW method was incorporated in the
GIF specification and immediately began negotiations with CompuServe in
January of 1993.  We reached agreement with CompuServe on licensing the
technology in June 1994, which calls for CompuServe to pay Unisys a royalty
of 1% of the average selling price it charges for its software.  This
represents approximately 11 cents for each copy sold and connected to its
information service.

Under the agreement, CompuServe, at its discretion, could relicense the LZW
technology to commercial developers using the GIF specification in software
that connected directly to the CompuServe information service.

With the agreement completed on June 21, 1994, CompuServe was given six
months to implement the terms of its license.  CompuServe later asked for a
one-month extension, which we granted.

Unisys did not require CompuServe to pass on any fee to its sublicensees or
end users.  Such a decision, and the content and timing of CompuServe's
advisory, was at their discretion.

Consistent with the entire information industry's desire to protect
intellectual property, Unisys will expect all of the major commercial
on-line information services companies employing the LZW patent to license
the technology from Unisys at a reasonable rate.  The on-line service
companies are not required to sublicense the technology to developers
producing software for the commercial on-line services.  It will be, as it
is today, at the on-line service's discretion as to whether it charges a
license fee to developers or chooses an alternative method to account for
its licensing fees payable to Unisys.

We recognize and are concerned -- thanks in large part to the recent and
very active use of the on-line network -- that developers did not
understand that the patented technology was resident in GIF.  Taking that
into account, Unisys does not intend to pursue previous inadvertent
infringement by versions of GIF-based software products marketed prior to
1995.

Concerning all future software product development and enhancement of
existing products for accessing on-line services, Unisys expects developers
of commercial, for-profit sftware to secure a license from Unisys, or
through the licensed on-line service, for the use of the patented
technology.  The very reasonable terms should prove no financial barrier to
the introduction of product into the on-line network.

Unisys does not require licensing, or fees to be paid, for non-commercial,
non-profit GIF-based applications, including those for use on the on-line
services.

Concerning developers of software for the Internet network, the same
principle applies.  Unisys will not pursue previous inadvertent
infringement by developers producing versions of software products for the
Internet prior to 1995.  The company does not require licensing, or fees to
be paid for non-commercial, non-profit offerings on the Internet, including
'Freeware'.

Commercial developers of GIF-based software for the Internet are expected
to secure a licensing agreement with Unisys for software products
introduced beginning in 1995, or enhancements of products that were
introduced prior to 1995.  Again, terms should not preclude the entry by
these firms into the marketplace.

For organizations introducing World Wide Web servers and 'Home Page'
offerings, most will not be required to secure a license from Unisys.  Most
organizations acquire software from other developers to create their
offerings on their servers.  Therefore, only the software firms who sell
the enabling software for profit would be expected to secure a licensing
agreement from Unisys.

Unisys understands that this issue has caused concern.  We want to reassure
all users and developers that we are strong proponents of the on-line
industry.

We're proud that this important Unisys technology has played a role in the
introduction of innovative products and services, many of which are fueling
the explosive growth of the information superhighway.

As members of the information community we want to strike the appropriate
balance between information access and the rights of all information
companies, including the developers of software, to protect their
intellectual property rights.

Unisys LZW Patent FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS             January 6, 1995

Since we released our statement this morning clarifying the terms of our
LZW patent licensing agreement, we have received several questions from
both the press and the on-line community at large.  We thought we would
share with you some of the most frequently asked questions -- and our
answers.  We hope this may help answer some similar questions you have.

What is the LZW patent?

The LZW patent covers methods and apparatus for lossless compression and
decompression of digital data.  Unisys holds a U.S.  patent (number
4,558,302) as well as equivalent patents on the technology in Canada,
France, Germany, U.K.  and Italy.  Equivalent patents are also pending in
Japan.

How did Unisys get the patent?

Data compression and decompression is a critical aspect of data
transmission and storage and is very much of interest to Unisys and the
industry.  The patent is the result of research done by Terry Welch at
Sperry Corporation in the early 1980s that extended previous work by
researchers Lempel and Ziv.  Sperry Corporation was granted the U.S.
patent in 1985.  Sperry and Burroughs merged in 1986 to form Unisys, thus
Unisys became the owner of the Sperry patents.

Why is LZW so widely used?

It is a very efficient compression method and a highly advantageous way of
compressing and decompressing data for a wide variety of purposes.  It is
easy to implement, operates at high speed and results in high compression
ratios without loss of data (that is, it significantly shrinks the file
size).

GIF has been in use since 1987.  Why is Unisys enforcing its rights now? 
Unisys only became aware of the use of LZW in the GIF specification two
years ago.  We immediately began negotiations with CompuServe at that time
and reached an agreement in June, 1994.  The existence of the patent has
never been a secret.  In fact, we have completed licensing agreements for
LZW technology with over 100 companies since 1990, for products including
hardware, software and on-line information services.  With most of these
companies, it was the licensees who approached Unisys, not Unisys forcing
the taking of a license.

Why did it take you so long -- almost five years -- to figure out that GIF
was infringing on your patent?

As is common in industry, we don't have massive people resources devoted to
searching and finding products which may be infringing and then undertaking
the complex task of reverse engineering the products to determine whether
or not they have infringed on the patent.  In the case of GIF, as soon as
we became aware we immediately sought to protect the patent through a
license to CompuServe.

Is this part of a larger campaign to enhance your revenues?

No.  The actual revenue derived from this particular patent is not
significant.  However, Unisys has invested hundreds of millions of dollars
in overall technology development and has protected its investments in the
form of thousands of patents.  We have a responsibility to our shareholders
to ensure that we protect these valuable company assets.

Why have you targeted the on-line industry now?

Unisys has not specifically targeted the on-line industry, evidenced by the
fact that we have licensed this technology to hardware, software and
information services companies over the past several years.  We became
aware of the applicability of our patent to the GIF specification and we
simply undertook negotiations with CompuServe as the primary stakeholder in
this specification.  The announcement content and timing of CompuServe's
action was solely a CompuServe business decision.

The agreement with CompuServe says I can only use GIF in accessing
CompuServe?  What about other on-line services?

Our relicensing agreement with CompuServe allows CompuServe to relicense
the technology only for use in accessing the CompuServe information
network.  However, commercial, for-profit developers are free to contact us
to secure a license for LZW.  Non-commercial, non-profit users aren't
required to secure a license to use the technology.

Is Unisys willing to negotiate with other developers?

Absolutely.  Unisys wants to encourage the use of its patented technology
and is therefore continuing to make licenses available under the patent at
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions to any interested
party.  Keep in mind that Unisys can only license the patented LZW
technology.  Unisys has no other stake in GIF (other than using it for our
own graphics transmission).

What do you consider "reasonable terms"?

While we will conduct negotiations with each applying developer, the
CompuServe royalty rate is somewhat indicative of the terms that should
cause no financial barrier to product entry into the on-line marketplace,
or anywhere else.  The CompuServe agreement calls for the company to pay
Unisys a royalty of approximately 1% of the selling cost of the product for
each product sold and connected to the on-line service.  Given the
calculation of the average price of CompuServe products, this came out to
about 11 cents per product sold and connected.

GIF is used extensively on the World Wide Web.  What does Unisys intend to
do there?

Unisys in no way wants to discourage end users and developers from making
use of this technology.  We intend to license commercial software
developers.  However, non-commercial, non-profit products, including
freeware, need not pay license fees.  Organizations introducing a World
Wide Web server and home page to the Internet are not expected to license
the technology if they used a third-party software application to develop
their server offering.  Only the commercial third-party developer in that
case should secure a license.

What about Internet browsers?

Again, our focus is on the developers and not on the end user.  Also, our
action is primarily focused on for-profit developers.  If a developer
intends to make a profit or provide a product for commercial use, they
should negotiate a license from Unisys.

Will this hurt the use of GIF?

We certainly hope not.  GIF has been outstanding for handling graphics
files and its use of LZW technology is one of the factors in its success. 
Again, the licensing terms are very modest and should not be a barrier to
its use.

Will users of CompuServe have to pay a royalty to Unisys every time they
upload or download a GIF file?

No.  Revenue to Unisys under the CompuServe license is independent of the
number of files transferred.

What will be the impact on end users and commercial software developers?

There should be no impact on individual end users.  We encourage them to
take full advantage of GIF.  For developers, the impact should be minimal.
Again, Unisys continues to make licenses under the patent available to any
interested party at reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions.
License fees for this technology should not be a barrier to any software
developer.

Why did you announce the changes during the Christmas holiday?

We concluded the license with CompuServe on June 21, 1994.  CompuServe was
given six months to implement the terms of the license agreement. 
CompuServe asked for, and we granted, a one-month extension.  The timing
and content of the announcement, and for that matter, the need for the
announcement, were entirely of CompuServe's choosing and without Unisys
knowledge or approval.

I'm using freeware or shareware that can manipulate GIF files.  Can I still
use it?

Yes.

What about freeware developers?

Our focus is on commercial, for-profit developers.  Freeware is exempted
from licensing fees.

And shareware developers?

Shareware developers that intend to make a profit from their software
should negotiate a license with nisys.  Alternatively, if their software is
intended to access CompuServe only, they might want to take advantage of
CompuServe's relicensing agreement with us.

Was the Unisys patent ever challenged?

The Unisys LZW patent was challenged in 1993, re-examined by the United
States Patent and Trademark Office, and the patentability of all claims was
reconfirmed in January of 1994.  This is a valid and fully enforceable
patent.

 From Cloanto/Unisys - November 6, 1992

[salutation]

   Thank you for your kind reply.  I don't want this matter to take you
more time than necessary.  I'll try to concentrate on a few very practical
points, confident that Unisys understands the position of thousands of
developers like us, and will maybe increase both its popularity and its
profits by applying more diversified policies.

   Let's suppose we added the Welch algorithm for data compression in our
low end paint program and word processor, sold at $ 99 and $ 49 list, with
a 75% distributor discount.  Data compression is clearly not one of the
major reasons why one would buy such a product.  Also, there are more
efficient and specific algorithms than Lempel-Ziv-Welch.  A 1 $ royalty (as
in your standard proposal) would increase our costs by more than 25%.  The
book-keeping overhead alone would be a good reason for us to employ
different compression algorithms.

   So, why would we use LZW?  Ever since the original 1984 article on data
compression by Terry Welch, this algorithm's diffusion was boosted by an
incredible number of publications, "public domain" source code and de-facto
standards.  Just look at the TIFF and GIF image file formats and the many
LZW based file archivers no BBS or PC-user could do without.  Nobody (and
here I must include Unisys) has ever done anything practical in order to
let reasonably informed programmers know that Unisys Corporation could some
day ask 1 $ for each product sold.  Given the success of the algorithm, not
taking a strong position was equivalent to encouraging people to use it.

   On the other hand, it is not quite clear to what degree and in which
countries the Unisys patent should be relevant to pure software
applications.  (I was asking you something similar in my first letter.) At
the same time, while public discussions rise awareness of these issues,
many opinion leaders are warning about possible degenerations of a system
which accepts "software patents".  I understand that in this complex and
potentially unstable situation Unisys may prefer prudent and diplomatic
moves.

   Adobe Systems' developer support material says that "Unisys has agreed
that ISVs may obtain such a license for a modest one-time fee." A una
tantum solution seems to be very appropriate to me (in the 50 to 250 $
range?) I know and work with several companies with similar standards.  No
doubt that, excluding hardware applications and compression-oriented
software (which is what I expect you to be more interested in protecting),
such a policy would allow to Unisys to address the smaller developers and
software vendors with more success and less bureaucracy.  In the case of
your proposed license agreement, I would have no problem paying the
required advance (i.e.  one time fee) and signing for a 0 $ royalty (and at
the same time becoming a strong Unisys supporter).  Reconsidering Adobe's
note quoted above, maybe I just received the wrong contract proposal.

[regards]
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
 From Cloanto/Unisys - November 12, 1992

[salutation]

   I appreciated receiving your second letter.  As far as my case is
concerned, I would only like to repeat one simple question.  Beyond this, I
am very interested in the various aspects of the matter, and would like to
provide you with some stimuli from my point of view (corporate developer
support programs, developers, developer conferences, specialized press,
etc.)

   My question: If we implemented a software GIF or TIFF image file loader
and saver (both formats are based on the LZW algorithm), would we need a
license from Unisys Corp., as far as U.S.  Patent 4 558 302 is concerned?

   If I were on your side, and had to start from scratch, I would consider
different groups of LZW implementors.  In the first group, I would put
everybody who developed an interface to handle the very popular PC
standards for file formats (e.g.  GIF, TIFF, ZIP, ARC, ZOO, LHA, LZH,
IFF-C1C0/C1K0, Compress, etc.  - mainly bitmap graphics files and file
archiving formats) which derived from the 1984 article by Terry Welch.  In
the second group, I would target all those interested in hardware
implementations of the algorithm, and software which depends heavily on the
use of the algorithm.  I don't know enough about your business or the
Patent to define more groups.

   Maybe all the above names of file formats do not mean much to you.  If
you have a friend who enjoys PC graphics, he or she certainly uses (knowing
it or not) those formats, and has several files ending with ".GIF" or
".TIF" on the hard disk.  If you also know somebody who has a modem
connected to the PC, all the archives he has ever transferred probably had
one of the other suffixes mentioned.

   A bitmap file format specifies how images you use on your PCs should be
stored on disk for future reuse, or exchange with other software.  An
archiving program merges several different files, belonging to the same
collection (e.g.  a piece of software and its support files), into a single
file, which is easier to store and transfer.

   Right now, LZW is certainly not the most space efficient way for
compressing an image or another type of file for archiving purposes, but
all this started back in 1984, and has now become a standard.  There was a
big boom in 1985.  Back then, only Huffman and run-length compression were
widely used.  Ancestors of LZW, like LZ77, LZSS, LZH and LZ78, were blurry
defined and had not encountered much success.  The programs I mentioned in
the first group do not even depend on LZW because of its run-time speed
(one of the key aspects of LZW), but because it was supported and
documented everywhere.  It's a bit like the history of VHS videotapes (Beta
was the better format, but VHS somehow became the leader).

   There are hundreds of publications explaining LZW without a single
reference to Unisys.  I see new articles every few weeks on very popular
magazines.  There are CD-ROMs sold for less than 50 $, each containing
hundreds of references to LZW.

   The applications of the first group are not "broader than simply driving
PostScript printers".  I write PostScript drivers and can assure you that
only very few companies and people will ever have to handle LZW for this
purpose.  PostScript is a very specific case, and it is not simple.  File
formats, instead, are everywhere.

   The reason why I put hardware and software in the same second group is
that the distinction between the two is becoming more and more faint.  For
example, on many PCs equipped with a Digital Signal Processor, a modem
featuring the V.42bis standard you mentioned can be emulated in software. 
I know of several modem manufacturers who distribute new releases of their
microcode on private or public electronic bulletin boards, so that users
can either reprogram their modems automatically, or burn a new EPROM and
install it into the modem.

   If it were difficult to decide whether LZW is strategic to a piece of
software which cannot immediately be classified as belonging to the first
group, the usual royalty agreement could be applied.  However, I wouldn't
expect this formula to encounter much popular success.

   Once a solution had been found for settling the de facto situation,
defining which file formats fall into the first group, and a clear policy
for approaching those implementing the formats, one would have to start
advertising, contacting all magazines, publishers, BBSs, etc.  Somebody
would have to be hired to keep track of all the new material which is
published every day, attend conferences, etc.

   The royalty solution will not work with the first group.  It will even
be hard to convince them to accept that there is a patent involved (is it
relevant, after all?) People would find solutions for not paying royalties
(like writing a paint program and then releasing public domain external
modules to handle GIF and TIFF).  Of all the solutions I have seen
companies adopting, I feel that only a one time, 50 $ to 250 $ fee, would
be accepted.  It could be bundled with a package of technical documentation
on LZW, and a dissertation on the patent, so that people could better
appreciate what they receive in change.  It would have to become a popular
solution, something the small developer would be proud paying for because
"He has licensed a patent from Unisys Corporation".  You could even
authorize everybody to use LZW for free for applications in the first group
(possibly starting with us), but you cannot afford to have the public
against you.

While Finishing up the last of my upper level EET classes at Texas A&M
University about 10 months ago, I began to notice how many hard core Amiga
users were making the choice of either upgrading to the "New and Improved",
32 bit, AGA power houses, or jumping ship all together and getting a
486DX66, a double speed CD ROM player, and the latest "Lucas Films Saga" on
CD.  I also noticed, working as a part time "Authorized Commodore"(?!)
Amiga Tech, that many of my customers were beginning to squirm at the
prospects of throwing out all their old gear and making the leap of faith
into the AGA realm.  After all, we had all heard the _HORROR_STORIES of
"Incompatibilities" and how all those great games that we once played until
numb, in the world of AGA would leave one blankly staring into the now
politically reformed guru message, "Software Failure"!.  These two harsh
choices were making Amiga owners across the land , and admittantly myself
also, second guess their position and wonder wether or not they stick with
their ole faithful , lowly A500 systems, dump it all and buy a Klone, or
just "Take the AGA Plunge"!

This got me thinking...  Well..  I have acquired quite a system here over
the years and have just got it set up the way I like it!  I don't wanna
sell it to some little snotty nosed, teenageNintendoMasterWannabe!  Hmmm..
If I could only mold my system into...

                           THE TOWER OF POWER!

I already had a MASSIVE (for when I bought it) 160Meg, 5.25", HH, SCSI
drive, a 44Meg SyQuest (that I bought off some blonde bowhead at the
Dallas 1st Saturday flea market for $35 (she thought it was a floppy
drive!  HA!)), a CLtd Kronos SCSI controller, and my little Supra RX with
4 Meg of Fast RAM!  My first move to the T.O.P.  was to kick up my
processing muscle... 

I had always been a keen observer of Amiga technology and never leaped onto
hardware bandwagons.  As having been an Amiga tech since '89, I found it
was much wiser (and cheaper) to watch others jump on the bandwagons and
learn from their mistakes in the form of unsupported hardware, defunct
defacto standards, and unstable hardware add-ons.  But now it was time for
me to make my move...  GVP was liquidating their 16 bit machine
accelerators and my best friend, my Visa card, was my ticket to ride!  I
watched all the mail order prices like a commission brochure and caught an
A530 40MHz 030 with 4Meg of RAM and NO DRIVE for $399!  WOW!  What a LEAP!
My next big move was to get a tower case...  I mean my A500 was like 6 feet
wide with all the stuff I had plugged into it!  I was sick of all the
wires, cables, extra power supplies, and besides, all my Klone friends had
those nice elegant cases...  Why not me!  So, with one of my techie
acquaintances, I managed to get a Diamond Black Mid Tower Case for $140
delivered (whole sale cost), which due to an ordering error ended up being
dark grey, but I could wait no longer, I had the fever!  I had chosen this
case very carefully, keeping in mind the dimensions that I would need to
make my machines metamorphosis feasible.  The case had 4 5.25" exposed
drive bays and two internal 5.25" HH bays, a 300W power supply, a cool case
stand, and an real slick CPU speed/indicator panel.  It was 8.5" inches
wide inside which would give me more than enough horizontal space to mount
the A530 in that orientation.  I went to work!

My first move was to make sure that the mother board could be mounted... 
I was in luck..  the two screw holes on either side of the Zorro Expansion
connector matched up perfectly with two of the mounting brackets of the
case leaving my machine oriented with the rear connectors towards the
rear, and the right hand side of the mother board flush with the top of
the inside of the case!  This was great!  But two mounting points were not
enough.  I needed AT LEAST one more point for ANY stability.  I found
another bracket on the case that would do but I would have to <gulp> drill
a hole into the double sided mother board...  "No Problem" I said..  I've
done more hard core mods than this (but just never to my own baby!)...  I
carefully lined it up so that I was only cutting through a ground plane,
and then, made the first incision!  <Whew!>..  It was clean (thanks to my
handy Dremel Moto Tool).  I then turned it over to examine for any
mischievous, loose copper shrapnel...  and....  <GASP!> I was devastated!
I just drilled through three address lines on the top side of my baby
Rocklobster!!!  Arrrrrgggg!  ....<sigh> I knew now there was no turning
back. 

I cleaned up the hole, cut back the address lines and rerouted them
leaving room for the metallic screw to form it's grip.  I then finished
mounting the mother board on brass standoffs, and with the help of an old
power connector off a now retired KlOnE 286 PC board, made a power cord
adaptor that skipped that old square DIN connector all together and used
the IBM power supply's standardized Molexish connector to give my bantling
back its breath of +5, +12, -12, and GND that it was so desperately crying
for (in my head).  I powered it up.  It came to life and uttered the
familiar "pause...click-click" that took me back smiling to the good ole
days of floopy based operation.  I then took on the MAJOR task of bringing
each and every connector on the back of A500 to the back of the T.O.P.'s
case...  this could be an article all unto itself!

The next step was to bring the A530, 40MHz, 68EC030 power house into
play...  "Hmm..   I know that I needed an 86 pin zorro female for this job
if I am to mount the A530 as I have imagined." , (in the bottom of the
tower case...) But where to get one?!  I could have ripped one off an old
A1000 expansion device if I were back home surrounded by dead Amigas, but
I had to make due...  Digikey and Mouser were no help...  So I tucked my
tail between my legs and went to...  "The Shack"...  Yea..  Thats right...
The Rat Shack, The Hole, The Idiot Shack..  All the Engineer's derogatory
slangs for Radio Shack rang through my ears as I walked through the door
to the ever predictable and greedy welcome of, "May I help you find
something?"...  "Heh..  I doubt it..." I muttered under my breath...
"Uhh..  Sir..  Are you looking for something in particular?" ...  Hmm... 
Ok...  I'll play...  "Yeeeeea..  Ok..  I need a standard female, 16 bit,
ISA bus expansion connector with either wire wrap or PC mounting
solderable connectors."...  <silence> "Mmmm...  Ahh Iiii'm afraid we don't
have that, but our Tandy 2500SX/33 has THREE of those ISA thingies in it
and it's on SALE right now for..."...  "Uhh..  Yea..  I'll just go have a
look here in the back..  Thanx anyway..".  I got my connector, chucked it
on the counter and as fast as I could udder the last four digits of my
phone number, I was outta there. 

I got back home, made the required and carefully measured marks on the
connector to make the cut and then sicked Mr.  Dremel on that nasty, ugly
IBM ISA connector.  The cut was clean and looked accurate enough.  I then
whipped out my trusty LOCTITE, 2 part, cold welding epoxy and lined up the
two halves of this home made Zorro connector that I had sliced into being,
let it dry on a sheet of wax paper over night (making sure that it was
perfectly straight lest I have to go back to the Rat Shack) ..."and if all
goes well, I should have my Zorro connector in the morning!"

In the morning I skipped my first 5 classes and decided to tear out the
ribbon cable and make this 3 inch ribbon nightmare a reality.  I must say,
it's some of the toughest soldering I've ever done.  I had to solder 86
pins onto that hacked ISA connector and then the other 86 pins to the
board side of the connector on the GVP A530, having to _BEND_ every other
connector leg to get my solder tip in tight enough to get the job done!  I
never sweat so much in my life.  After I finally got THAT up and running,
I could now take all of my previously external SCSI drives and shove them
into...

                               THE T.O.P.!

Some of the other hacks I had previously made to my system over the years
just seem to fit into place as if by devine enlightenment, as if planned
in the past by something outside myself, something that knew that the
T.O.P.  -M-U-S-T--B-E-...!  <hehe> sorry..   got carried away there...  My
switch debounced, TTL buffered, LED indicated, NTSC/PAL switch was set up
so that it could be hooked directly to the cases elegant RESET button and
Turbo LED.  The A530's Game switch was now hooked up (with ease I might
add) to the ever powerful TURBO button.  The front LED MHz display was
easily set to "40".  The C= HD floppy drive took some doing trying to get
to fit into a Klonez 3.5" to 5.25", 1/3rd height, floppy drive adaptor,
but the pieces were quickly coming together! 

The next step was to internalize my fairly new purchase of one Line Link
14.4kBaud V42.bis, Voice/Fax modem into one of the 5.25" drive bays.  This
was tricky and I was not sure it would work because I had to cut the hell
out of the multi layer board it was manufactured on to get it to fit, but
I knew the areas I had to cut did not bear any important signals but
merely the Vcc and GND planes so I did it and it worked.  I did, however,
have to build a new power supply (9VAC) out of a 12.6V Rat Shack Xformer,
and a few clamping diodes to dissipate some of the extra juice.  I then
drilled holes in the dummy face plate I was mounting the modem behind (for
the LED's to peep through) and brought the power switch up to the front. 
I needed, of course, to access the phone jacks on the back of the modem,
so for this I got a hold of an old 1200 baud internal Klone Head modem
(for free) and took great pleasure in cutting the hell out if it to
extract the needed PC backplane with the RJ-11's in tact.  By simply
cutting a Male to Male RJ-11 cord in half and soldering IT to the
backplane jacks and plugging it into the back of my modem, I was set!
Then for the final touches, I used rub on lettering to define the modem
LED indicators and the power switch.  The T.O.P was beginning to take form
an elegant and usable form!
 
I decided THEN that I would DEFINITELY not want people coming over and
mistaking my T.O.P.  for some run of the mill, MSB, Klone headed, 386DX40,
so I stenciled onto the side in big 3" High Letters, "AMIGA" for the whole
world to see...

All in all it turned out rather nice.  I got my T.O.P.  dream machine
(with a little epoxy, solder, sweat, & tears), have a unit that turns 12+
MIPS (about 486sx25 speed), have plenty of room for expansion, and even
enough case room to maybe even put in a dual Sling Shot type device for
preparation of my REAL dream of: a GVP EGS 24 bit Spectrum Board (for
emulated AGA) and an Emplant Mac/586DX emulator!!! 

With a little patience and some good technical support, anyone that's handy
with a soldering iron can do these types of modifications.  Even if you
DON'T choose the T.O.P.  route, there are still MANY options open to the
often scoffed at, and lowly A500 user!  The only limits are your own
imagination...  (and your current credit card status.)

@node REVIEW1 "Review:  QwikForms CD-ROM"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                         REVIEW:  QwikForms CD-ROM
    Ivo Kroone                                         raymond@cs.vu.nl
===========================================================================

After seeing promising advertisements announcing the "QwikFroms" CD-ROM in
Amiga World, I thought it would be the perfect disc for me.  Clipart in
ILBM format, ready-made documents in PageStream format, spreadsheet
templates, standard letters and fonts compatible with PageStream.  Although
a little pricey (I paid Dfl.  59,-, which is about $ 35) this should be
worth-while.

Configuration for testing: Amiga 500 plus (68000/Kick 2.04/ECS)
                           A570 CD-ROM drive
                           HP LaserJet 4M

                           PageStream 2.22HL
                           TypeSmith 2.5a
                           ViewTek 2.1

Everything the ad promises is true.  But still I'm disappointed.  The
first, nasty, problem is that the disc has no label.  No label means no
booklet and a name-less volume.  So far I have not found a picture of
ready-made document providing the user with a print-it-yourself sleeve for
the CD-case.  Because of this, I decided to create a sleeve while exploring
the CD to write this review.  The sleeve can be found on any AmiNet site:

/pub/aminet/text/dtp/QwikForms.lha

one needs to have the CD present as the project uses fonts (Fox/McGarey-
Fractured/Mongrel) only found on the CD.  Of course only images from the CD
have been used.

ScalaMM cannot use this disc, it gets hopelessly confused by the name-less
volume.  With DirectoryOpus using "expand path names" the entire CD is not
usable!  Opus will keep returning to SYS: instead of reading CD0:.  The
solution is making an ASSIGN to it so the disc has a name, and turning off
"expand path names".  So after:

 Assign foo: CD0:

one can access the disc as "foo:".  WorkBench has no problems with a label-
less disc, but as there are no .info-files the disc seems not to be meant
to be accessed from the WorkBench.  The volume size is 381 MB.  There's no
accompanying book showing thumbnails of all pictures.

Playing around with the CD learns that this item is aimed at the Amiga as
well as the Atari ST market.  Lots of directories contain sub-directories
"AM" and "ST".  Most of the sub-directories contain the same data but
stored in other formats.  So most of the clip-art is stored in IFF and IMG
format.  As the Amiga is a true wizard at reading exotic file formats, this
might be a waste of disc-space.  On the other hand, using a slow Amiga like
I do the IFF format alone is a reason to buy the disc, duplicates or no
duplicates.  All file-names are MS-dos style.  A big turn off to me,
especially compared to those more than excellent AmiNet CDs.  The short
upper-case filenames are really annoying.  We have a capable operating
system, a special Amiga CD-ROM (more about that later) and still MS-dos is
bugging us!  On a brighter note, there are a couple of pretty funny anti
IBM pictures on the disc.  :-)

                                 Contents

Clipart is spread over a number of directories. The root reads:

 CLASSICW (dir)
 CLIPTO1 (dir)
 CLIPTO2 (dir)
 EPSALOT (dir)
 FONTFRM1 (dir)
 FONTFRM2 (dir)
 LOGOLIBR (dir)
 MORECLIP (dir)
 MOREFONT (dir)
 QWIKFORM (dir)
 QWIKLETR (dir)
 TEMPLCTY (dir)
 UTILITY (dir)
 READTHIS.TXT

The first directory contains 38MB of so called classic software, from 1989
that is.  Because of the Atari/MS-dos style file-names most software is
crippled and therefore ot usable.  16MB of the total 38MB is Amiga
software, the remainder can be used with your favorite Atari emulator!  The
Amiga programs can be used without any unpacking.  Except for the silly
".INF" files it's a nice archive of real oldies.  Much of them still have a
".FNF" file showing their origin (Fred Fish).

The UTILITY directory is much like the classic software.  Real old
utilities with truncated filenames.  This time usability is even less as
everything has been put in one big directory.  It is up to the user to find
out which files belong to which program.  Worthless.

                            Bitmapped ClipArt

Finally a CD-ROM with Amiga clipart, ILBM and PostScript!  The directories
have been separated in an Amiga and an Atari part, totalling 63MB of ILBM
files.  Both containing the exact same pictures, only ILBM (abbreviated
.LBM) for Amiga and IMG for Atari.  Using your average IFF viewer one
easily can browse trough the images.  And again "The Sterling Connection"
company disappoints.  Lots of the files contain nothing but a big mess
(yes, with all viewers).  Reading the file with a HEX editor proves that
all files have been converted to IFF using "GraphicWorkshop 6", which seems
to be a bad program as about 20% of all ILBM files has been crippled.

The other 80% varies from useless to good.  The useless category contains
things like arrows (I could never have drawn a real arrow myself!), dots
and boxes.  More useful are the classic holiday, travel, school, people and
cartoons which will surely make every document more attractive.  As far as
this is concerned this CD-ROM is no less than any other ClipArt CD-ROM I've
seen for other platforms.  The big difference is, of course, that this one
contains IFF pictures.  Most others are meant for PC (PCX/GIF) or Macintosh
(MAC/TIFF) computers and therefore mean lots of conversion.  For those with
fast Amigas running KickStart 3.0 converting pictures should be no problem,
still I personally prefer the native Amiga format.

When using bit-mapped pictures for DTP purposes the pictures should be as
big and oversized as possible.  Even a real cheap matrix printer will
output 200x200 DPI.  Which means that a 200x200 pixel picture can only be
printed on a square inch without getting jagged edges.  The pictures on
this disc will just about do.  Most are black'n'white (1 bit plane) hires
lace, taking up very little memory.  Judging quality: all pictures have
been scanned, none have been drawn by hand.  Scanning quality is good.

Other directories contain GIF files (colorful and therefore less useful for
DTP purposes) redefining the word miscellaneous: everything from girls to
open heart surgery.  A "PI1" directory contains low-quality artwork from
the Atari drawing package "Degas" (to be imported in PageStream).

                            Structured Clipart

The "EPS a lot" directory contains 5MB of postscript pictures.  These will
be recognized by PageStream as both "IBM postscript" and "Illustrator".  
This directory however is a mess.  Pictures are not sorted in any way, just
thrown in EPS1 to EPS9.  Still these are nice, useful quality images.

Another directory comprising 26MB of clipart-files is less useful.  
PageStream recognizes these as "IBM EPSF" which can be used but simply
don't look very good on paper.

                                  Forms

The unique thing about this CD-ROM are the ready-made PageStream documents.
All have a ".DOC" extension, which is odd because Amiga owners usually end
their filenames with ".PgS".  As PageStream runs on both Atari and Amiga
the creators had an easy job.  Indeed PageStream accepts every document on
the disc.  Regrettably quality of the documents leaves much to be desired.
Many are so simple one can make them in a matter of minutes.  Others are so
specialized I doubt anyone will ever find a use for them.  Yet others only
apply to American culture or law so no one outside the USA will ever make
use of them.

Same goes for the text files.  Most of them are extremely short (less than
1024 bytes).  All contain extra carriage returns which have to be stripped
by Amiga users.  What did they think, the Amiga is the latest type-writer
from Commodore?  :-)

Templates (13MB) for various spreadsheets are nice but again chances are
small one needs exactly the template found on this CD.  Templates for
Analyze!, MaxiPlan and Superplan are included.  I tried most of the Analyze
files and they all seemed to work OK.  Models include things like book-
keeping, savings plans, calendars and biorhythm.  I found this library
especially useful for examples.

                                  Fonts

CompuGraphic, Outline and Type1 fonts can be used perfectly well with
TypeSmith.  Exploring with TypeSmith learns that all fonts are indeed
public domain, some have even been created using TypeSmith!

Installing is a breeze, just add them using PageStream's FontManager.  This
does not mean the QwikForms CD has to be in the CD-ROM drive from now on. 
As soon as a font from the CD is accessed a request will pop-up asking for
CD0:.  This again shows how anoying it is not to have a label attached to
the volume.  The solution is to access the CD by it's assigned name and
using that assign from within the fontmanager.  With any other CD in the
drive, PageStream will accept that volume but cannot find the fonts.  This
means a big problem when working with more than one font CD-ROM.  Fonts
work pretty quick from CD, there's absolutely no need to copy them to the
harddisk.

As with all font-collections quality varies from nothing special to real
smart or funny.  Well, just take a look at the file I created for the
sleeve, it uses a couple of interesting fonts.

                                Conclusion

This CD-ROM comes in handy when doing DTP work.  If your system handles
GIF, PCX or other non-Amiga formats as easily as ILBM, this CD might not be
the perfect solution for you.  If, on the other hand, you prefer native
Amiga formats over everything else this CD is good.

Compared to jewels like AmiNet4 the Sterling Connection did a very poor
job.  From a technical point of view this CD is terrible: no volume name,
upper case filenames, 8 character file-names, crippled files, only 381MB
used and old software.  It seems like the CD has been mastered using an
Atari ST or MS-dos machine and no one ever took time to test it with the
Amiga.  Still I had a lot of fun exploring the CD and creating a CD cover
for it.

My advice is to wait till it gets real cheap and then buy it.  At $ 40
this disc is way overpriced.

                          REVIEW:  SplatterPaint
                               @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}
===========================================================================

There are times you want to come up with a masterpiece-something you want
printed on magazine covers, t-shirts, and framed in a gallery.  Or, a
really incredible picture you can distribute proudly far and wide, knowing
you have composed a masterpiece.  You'll be retouching and retouching with
a graphics package, making sure everything is just right.

Splatterpaint isn't for these times.  Splatterpaint is more for the times
when you've got a lot of random creative energy and don't really want to
get complicated.

Splatterpaint is a free paint package.  No, it's no ImageFX, Photogenics,
Brilliance, or DeluxePaint.  It's really not even a DeluxePaint II.

What it is is a 64-color, 320x200 IFF paint program with some of the
"standard" features (circle, polygon draw, fill, palette selection, etc.)
and the title feature-the splatterpaint, which is essentially three
spray-brushes with a twist, in that they "splatter" outward or downward
across the page.

What's to say?  The painting itself works, although often the "outlines" of
polygons to be drawn are too flickery.  The options and preferences are
somewhat sparse, but it doesn't promise what it doesn't deliver.  The "file
requesting" is thoroughly evil, requiring you to remember the name of
everything, since it's just a line prompt.

The palette changes can get problematic, as some buttons disappear if you
turn their color to black.  Oops.

Splatterpaint was sired by Pete Storonskij, author of such fine games such
as Mangled Fenders and Conundrum.  He once again proves that while he's a
good programmer, he's not much of a documentarian.  The sparse text hypes
the splatter-painter and says that the program contains many of the same
keypresses as DP or Brilliance.  This is not a big help.

Plusses?  It's free.  It's good to just screw around with and come up with
some pictures.  It DOES have undo and a sort of magnification tool.
Minuses?  It doesn't multitask and it's not exactly bogged down with
options.  But the splatter painter IS sort of neat...

@node REVIEW3 "Photogenics from Almathera"
@toc REVIEW

===========================================================================
                           REVIEW: Photogenics
                               @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}
===========================================================================

The first thing I noticed about Photogenics was the fact that Almathera is
the only company I've ever encountered with letterhead packing tape.

The second thing was that there was a rather nice t-shirt included.

The first was amusing, the second a thrill (not only do software companies
want to keep me well-stocked with programs, they want to clothe me!  This
is great!) But it was time to actually get to the issue at hand-

Photogenics, the AGA and 24-bit image manipulation package.

Photogenics ships in a rather large, sturdy box with a pull-out binder
that contains the documentation-Almathera clearly is a member of the "big
box" school of packaging, since the included documentation doesn't REALLY
warrant a binder, as it's only 70 pages or so.  But the box does draw
attention to itself, with an attractive Photogenics-generated logo and
large, friendly lettering.

The program itself is contained on three disks, easily installed on your
system.  Note-while the package does NOT require AGA, it DOES require that
you have either AGA or a 24-bit graphics board AND at least Kickstart 3.0.
Almathera only specifies two supported graphics boards-OpalVision and
Picasso II.  I will check with Almathera to see if the unlisted boards are
supported for next issue.  You are also allowed to run the program on
floppy and/or with a scant 2 megs of memory...but do you really want to
mess with 24-bit images that can, depending on how you save them, take up
more than the capacity of a regular floppy, or do you want some real
power?

Photogenics' working environment is much more reminiscent of a paint
program than of an image manipulation package such as ImageFX.  You are
provided with a window full of tools to select, and can load in images in
their own windows.  A substantial difference between IFX and Photogenics,
though, is that you choose from 16, 256, or HAM-8 previews of the image
being worked on.  The HAM-8 preview is astounding...but rather slow.
While you can exclusively work in it if you choose, 256 will be
considerably more comfortable.

Photogenics is designed with a slew of effects to be "painted" onto the
image.  Effects such as AddNoise, Blur, Deinterlace, Emboss, MotionBlur,
Roll, and Tile are all applied by brushes of configurable size and
"pressure", allowing the ultimate control of their outcome.  The brushes
include pencil, chalk pastel, and my favorite, watercolor.  The effects
themselves come with a variety of mode settings to let you do what you
want, quickly and efficiently.

Another of Photogenics' operating quirks is that the area you "paint" with
an effect is that, until you select to Fix your changes with the
appropriate click, the areas you have "painted" can be altered to be any
level or effect you choose, by simply selecting a new mode.  So, if you
decide that the apple would look better Pixelized than Blurred, you just
select Pixelize and it will change accordingly.

The file formats supported by Photogenics are in the vein you would expect
and find most useful-variations on the Amiga IFF/ILBM scheme, JPEG, GIF,
etc.  Another nicety is the ability to load CDXL or QuadAnim (Almathera's
format for Video Creator) frames.  Unfortunately, CDXLs and QuadAnims
cannot be created with this package.  Direct grabbing from V-Lab is also
supported, as is a screen grabber Almathera claims will work on all
video boards.

I consider the easy handling of Alpha and Secondary channels to be
Photogenics' greatest strength.  These "channels" (actually just other
images) are used for effects involving blending or "rubbing through" onto
the main image.  The organization is handled on a thumbnail bar at the
bottom of the screen-each image loaded into Photogenics is represented,
and the appropriate nail can be dragged into the "Alpha" or "Secondary"
box at will.

To round out the package of options, a limited number of antialiased fonts
are included for your works.  They're rather nice, and of course Almathera
is more than happy to tell you where to get more: one of their own
CD-ROMs.

A number of sample images, including three frames from the inception of
the Photogenics logo, are included to get you started and get you through
the tutorial in the manual.

Photogenics is an excellent manipulation package.  Its speed is
considerable on a 4000/040 25mhz.  On the base required system (a stock
A1200) you'll have forgotten what it was you were trying to achieve before
you actually finish.  In terms of functionality, it is not the end-all and
be-all of image processing, but it does an excellent job of applying
effects.  Missing is a more detailed manual (it's not bad, but there was
some room for elaboration) and some sort of ARexx support for a more
integrated image-processing system.  But in general, Almathera has come up
with a winner.

DESCRIPTION

        RexxOpt optimizes your ARexx scripts by removing all information
        not necessary.  This results in a faster execution speed, making
        working with ARexx much more comfortable.

        When run in default mode (no switch given in command line) the
        following is done:

          - all unnecessary blank characters (ASCII 9, 32 and 160) are
            removed
          - all comments are removed
          - consecutive strings are merged to one single string
          - ';' is inserted in front of any DO within the script
          - all blank characters outside strings and comments are
            replaced by <space> (ASCII 32)
          - all (remaining) lines are put into one single line
          - a new comment line is put in front of the script because
            ARexx requires ARexx scripts to begin with a comment.

        This is V1.7, an update to V1.6.

NEW FEATURES

        - New switch DEOPT: (re)insert linefeeds
        - Minor code optimization concerning nested comments
        - New switch FIRSTCOMMENT: Don't strip first comment
        - Filehandling rewritten: it is no longer necessary to provide a
          destination filename. This introduced some new error messages and
          made some of the old obsolete.
        - Titlecomment and filecomment are now set according to current mode
          (optimize/deoptimize).

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        You need AmigaOS 2.0 or better to run RexxOpt.

        Additionally it would be a good idea to have ARexx installed on
        your system since it makes not much sense to optimize ARexx scripts
        when you can't use them.

@node FTP5 "New IP policy"
@toc FTP

Well, the results are in from my survey about who needs IP numbers for FTP
sites.  My thanks to everyone who responded.

My conclusion is that DNS is widely established.  Direct IP numbers are
still needed only in two rare situations: the DNS local installation is
broken or the host is new and the name has not propogated up through the
DNS servers.

Neither of these situations are a real problem for the needs of the readers
of this group.  Most FTP sites are well-established.  Most of the software
goes on Aminet.  People with broken DNS servers can get the numbers from
the list of Aminet sites (which are included in the administrative posts).

Therefore, I will no longer require IP numbers of FTP sites.  If you are
posting software somewhere other than Aminet, I strongly recommend that you
include the IP number.  However, I will no longer require that you do so.

Instead, I will require the more modern URL.  This will make things more
convenient for users of certain software.  It will also make posts a little
shorter.  As an example, one of the archives of this group would be
specified in a URL as:

ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/docs/anno/announce450.lha

Further notes:

If your file does happen to be on Aminet, please say so.

Please list the size of your files.  Some of the readers here do their FTP
by mail.  They really like to know what they are getting into.

I'll have the revised administrative posts out soon to reflect these
changes.

    Web:    http://www.cs.latrobe.edu.au/~burton/

DESCRIPTION

    -- Script to download HTML systems across the network --

    GetURL.rexx is an ARexx script which will download World-Wide Web pages.
    With a simple command line it will download a specific page, and with
    more complex command lines it will be able to download specific sets of
    documents.

    The intention was to create a tool that allowed local caching of important
    Web pages and a flexible way of specifying what pages are important. The
    script has no GUI as of yet but may have at some stage in the future.

    If you have ever tried to download and save to disc a 200 page document
    using Mosaic, then you know what this script is for. Mosaic will only
    let you load a page, then load it to disc, then load another page etc.
    This is a very frustrating process. GetURL automates this process and
    will run in batch mode without user intervention.

    The major features of GetURL.rexx are as follows:

    * doesn't require AMosaic, you you can be browsing something else
        with AMosaic whilst this is running

    * save pages to your hard disc so that they can be read offline and
        you can also give them to friends on a floppy disc. Who know, 
        you may even be able to sell discs containing web pages :-)

    * flexible set of command line switches that allow you to restrict the 
        type of pages that it downloads

    * ability to specify files for the lists of URLs that it keeps so
        that any search for pages can be stopped and restarted at a later
        date. i.e. you could run GetURL for 2 hours a day whilst you are
        online and gradually download everything in the entire universe
        and it won't repeat itself.

    * ability to download itself when there are new versions.

    * will use a proxy if you have access to one, in order to both speed up
        access to pages and also to reduce network load.

    * will download binary files (*.gif, *.lha) as easily as text and html
        files.

    * documentation is in the top of the script file.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    * Until somebody writes a TCP: device for the AS225 TCP/IP protocol
        stack unfortunately this script will require AmiTCP.

    * requires the TCP: device be mounted

    * either restraint, or an extremely large hard disc - your choice :-)

    * This script is no use at all unless you have AmiTCP set up and running.
      If you don't know what this means then please ask me

      2- Evaluate the computing performance of your Amiga and
         compare it to others :

        + AIBB includes 20 different tests (integer, graphics,
          floating point, memory access, ...)
        + AIBB achieves comparisons by storing and retrieving the
          results of these tests in a very small file : a module.

    This is the 1.0 version of CompilAIBB, constituted of modules
    made with 6.0 or newer versions of AIBB. It features lots of
    68030 accelerator boards for the A1200 and the A2000, 68040
    accelerators boards for the A2000 and the A4000 and a 68060
    prototype board for the A4000. Some boards are represented twice
    or more with small differences such as the Kickstart version,
    Kickstart location, cache status, etc.

    A big AmigaGuide document is provided with an inventory of
    these modules and instructions to provide the author with new
    ones.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
    The AIBB modules require the 6.0 or newer version of AIBB.

    The AmigaGuide documentation  require either the Amigaguide
    software included in the 3.0 (V39) or 3.1 (V40) Amiga system
    or the standalone Amigaguide V34 package.

    Maximum efficiency can be obtained from the documentation if your
    humour board is plugged in...

AUTHOR

     Thomas Kessler (kessler@fim.uni-erlangen.de)

DESCRIPTION

     CDBoot is a tool for booting almost any available CD32 game on
     any A1200 or A4000.

     CDBoot works with any AT/SCSI/PCMCIA CD-ROM drive and any
     available CD-ROM filesystem.

     It is possible to create config files for each CD, where a
     specific joypad emulation and language selection can be saved.
     The emulation supports up to four joypads, as planned by
     Commodore.

     Game high scores are saved to floppy or hard disk (if high score
     saving is supported by the game), with the nonvolatile RAM
     emulation.

     Usage and installation (Commodore installer) is very easy. There
     is no need to press any keys or buttons during startup to boot a
     CD. Harddisk usage is supported as well as floppy usage. CDBoot
     can also be removed again with the supplied installation script.

     The games are playable with joystick and/or keyboard as well as
     with an original CD32-joypad. Special emulations for some games,
     which would need a joypad for serious playing (e.g.
     SuperStardust by Team 17tm) are included and are
     described on the installation disk.

     CDXL anims will play on any CD file system.

     Playing ECS games (released on CD) with an upgraded OS3.x ECS-
     Amiga like A3000(T) is also possible, but not guaranteed.

     Pure audio tracks are not supported for all controllers/
     filesystems due to incompatibilities with the original CD access
     of the CD32.

REQUIREMENTS

     Required:
     - OS3.0 or higher
     - A1200/A4000(T) PAL/NTSC
     - CD-ROM drive (any)
     - CD filesystem (any)

     Recommended:
     - CD-games :-) PAL/NTSC

PRICE

     The price is DM 69,- (German Marks)

  Solar System Wars

VERSION

  1.37

AUTHOR

  James Cleverdon

DESCRIPTION

  Solar System Wars is a game similar to Space Wars, pitting two
  players against each other, in orbit around 0 to 4 stars.  Choose
  from 53 different solar systems, or turn on the random system
  selector for a new challenge every round.  A variety of weapons are
  available.  Two or three button joysticks are strongly recommended,
  but not required.  Both NTSC and PAL are supported.  Binary only.

NEW FEATURES

  * Now support for three-button joysticks!

  * Everyone now gets Full Shields all the time, controlled by the
    third button, or the left/right Alt key.

  * New extra weapons!  Get ready for the Anomalizer, Disruptor,
    Guided Torp, and the Cluster Pod!  Sadly, Flip Ship has gone to
    that bit bucket in the sky.

  * Four star solar systems!

  * New Beginner mode, which keeps the Random System mode from picking
    high-gravity solar systems.

  * Each player now gets twelve active torpedos instead of nine.

  * Improved Seeker code.  They no longer are useless in high gravity
    systems.

  * SSW's sound effects now come in an IFF file!  Add your own sounds!
    Amaze your friends!  Confound your enemies!

  * Fixed the sprite glitching problem on slower machines.

  * SSW no longer adds an input event handler to eat mouse events.  No
    more compatibility problems with Commodities or other handlers.

  * Added a New Game requester that shows up after someone wins.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  Works with AmigaOS 1.3 or higher.

     email: iske@informatik.uni-frankfurt.de

DESCRIPTION

     ForceIcon is an utility mainly for users of CD-ROM drives
     or users of networking software capable of sharing devices
     and icons. Since one can not snapshot the position of a
     volume's icon (on read-only media), nor replace it by a
     user-defined one, I wrote this utility. ForceIcon allows
     you to set the position of a disk's icon and/or replace
     it by a different image/icon which doesn't have to be a
     disk.info file. All types of ".info" files may be selected.
     Special features include inheritance of device specific
     settings, specifying the root drawer`s size/position
     and display flags/modes. ForceIcon may even change the
     look and position of AppIcons.

NEW FEATURES

     - Fixed severe bug in conjunction with ToolManager

     - Add NewIcons icons

     - Fixed problems with determining whether an old version
       of ForceIcon (non AppIcons supporting) is running

DESCRIPTION

     MUIProCalc is a MUI-based calculator much like Jimmy Yang's
     Calc 3.0. It still lacks the plotter, but it offers a quite
     flexible history facility for inserting previously entered
     expressions. If offers different output formats and plenty of
     functions the user may choose from. Furthermore the look
     of the calculator may be customized.

     MUIProCalc comes with a fancy GUI you may configure to your needs.
     Function gadgets may be flipped through using pages so that they
     don't eat up too much of space. MUIProCalc supports an input/output
     history you may configure so that you may re-insert previously entered
     expressions/results. History entries may be copied to a user definable
     clipboard unit. It features various display/output bases such as decimal,
     hexadecimal, octal, and binary and of course calculation sizes ranging
     from 8-bit to 32-bit width. Angles may be displayed as radians, degrees,
     or grads. MUIProCalc offers an ARexx port you may use to calc expressions
     externally. These commands are able to return TeX compatible output
     such as "1\cdot 10^{-5}". It comes with two example scripts for use
     with CED Pro.

NEW FEATURES

        - Added support for GRADS

        - Added great support for physical constants. 31 listed

        - Added full featured linear regression support

        - Added standard deviation support

        - Added (n k) n-over-k function, 1/x, and the y-th root of x
          function.

     EGSShow 1.2 - GIF, JPEG and IFF viewer for the EGS window system

AUTHOR
     Dietmar Heidrich   s_heidri@ira.uka.de

     This software uses JPEG code from The Independant JPEG Group Version 5 and
     the GIF decoder written by Steven A. Bennett. IFF ILBM support by Dietmar
     Heidrich.

DESCRIPTION
     EGSShow is a viewing program for GIF, JPEG and IFF files on the EGS window
     system. This program is able to read the JPEG format as well as the GIF
     formats GIF87a, GIF89a and all future GIF files compatible with both of
     the above as well as valid IFF ILBM files, including EHB, HAM6, HAM8 and
     IFF24. The format of the file is detected automatically.

     EGSShow needs a lot of memory for bigger pictures ( > 640 x 480) and EGS
     version 6 or higher. Selecting a lower colour depth than 24 bit for the
     EGS default screen will save you lots of memory.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
     Enhanced Graphics System Version 6 or higher.

     EGS, the Enhanced Graphics System, is a high-performance 24 bit true
     colour window system for the Commodore Amiga computers. It's the first
     system that brings 24 bit drawing capabilities to the Amiga. A demo EGS
     version for the native Amiga chipset is available on AmiNet. EGS is
     available for almost all Amiga graphics boards, among them EGS Spectrum,
     Piccolo, Piccolo SD64 and EGS 110.

NEW FEATURES
     The main difference of version 1.2 to version 1.11 is speed. GIF was sped
     up by 20%. IFF was sped up by 30%. JPEG was sped up by 45%. There is a new
     submenu for the JPEG mode which lets you select various output size
     scalings. Grayscale JPEGs now work.

DESCRIPTION

Hi, all!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
        First off, WHAT IS T3DLIB???

        T3DLIB is a 3D object manipulation "kit" and converter and
        programmer's library and ASCII format, and all sorts of other
        things too.  :-)  It runs on a slew of different machines.
        (Basically, anything with a Real C compiler: djgpp, Watcom,
         gcc; UNIX, Amiga, PC, etc.)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

        I just released version R43 of T3DLIB, and placed it in
ftp.luth.se:/pub/aminet/new.  It should show up in /pub/aminet/gfx/3d
soon... The files are T3DLIB_EXE_R43.lha (Documentation and Amiga
executables) and T3DLIB_Src_R43.lha (Source) (with their .readme
files, of course).

        The main change is that Rob Hounsell added Imagine 3.0 support
to it.  Thanks, Rob!  See the CHANGES file for more info.

        This will most likely be my *last* release of T3DLIB, unless it
has a major problem.  Many thanks to the few people who have sent in the
registration fee over the years.  I very much appreciate it!  Believe it
or not, T3DLIB has been around since 1988, when it started as TTDDD.
It, I believe, has served its purpose well, and it is time that I lay it
to rest.  :-)

        Feel free to e-mail questions or comments to me at either
"glewis@netcom.com" or "glewis@pcocd2.intel.com".

        Take care all, and thanks again.

@toc FTP

NAME
        KingFisher

VERSION
        2.7

SYNOPSIS
        An update to the PREMIER "Fish Disk" & CD-ROM software catalog
        maintenance and search tool available to all Amigas with KS2.04
        or later.  See PURPOSE section below for more details.

NEW FEATURES
        ----- KingFisher 2.7 ------------------------------------------
        Clipboard               - Now write Search Sets, too
        Version Links           - Scan to build Prev/Next version links
        Adding Fish             - fixed bug where 'No' == 'Cancel'
        Server interaction      - No longer restarts when server quits
        System Requesters       - Now show up on same (custom) screen
        Miscellaneous           - Some options available through menu

        ----- KFServer 2.7 --------------------------------------------
        kfcSETPOS               - Index referencing bug fixed

        ----- RexxFisher 1.9 ------------------------------------------
        RF_TRUNCATE             - Permits truncation of database

PURPOSE
        KingFisher is a tool specifically designed to maintain and
        search one or more databases for software.  The program permits
        manual browsing, but offers a powerful expression parser through
        which you can explain to KingFisher exactly what you are looking
        for.

        The layout of database records for display is programmable, as
        is the format used for printing and that for writing records to
        a file.

        KingFisher uses a resizable GadTools window on the default
        public screen or on a custom screen, offers the choice of both
        smart and simple refresh windows, and supports proportional
        fonts (including scalable fonts) of nearly any size.

        KingFisher supports more than one database, and databases that
        are larger than a single disk volume, which are spread over any
        number of disks to be mounted on request.

        Using advanced Client-Server Technology, KingFisher supports
        multiple simultaneous users with a minimum of memory overhead
        (as little as 25K) for each user.  An ARexx-based interface,
        named RexxFisher, provides a BBS with the means to serve many
        databases to many users!

        KingFisher is localized.  Catalogs are supplied for Dansk,
        Deutsch, Espanol, Nederlands, Suomi, and Svenska.  More are
        expected as translators are found (hint, hint!)

        Context sensitive and fully integrated AmigaGuide provides
        help on gadgets, menu items, reference sections, etc. in over
        150K of widely cross-linked text.

        KingFisher comes with a complete, read-to-use database of
        descriptions for Fred's "Fish Disks" 1-1000!

REQUIREMENTS
        With Fish Disk Database (1.5MB), approximately 2.2MB of harddisk
        space is needed.  The program requires about 300K of memory to
        run, depending on the size of the database index files and some
        other factors.  Kickstart V37 (2.04) is required; V38+ (2.1) is
        required for localization.

COMPATIBILITY
        Tested with 68000 through 68040 CPUs, V37, V38, V39, and V40
        system software, Picasso II graphics board.  Enforcer and
        Mungwall used during testing.

PRICE
        Shareware registration fee is $20(US) or DM30.  A registration
        site in Germany is available for European users.

RESTRICTIONS
        The freely distributable, unregistered (EVALUATION) version is
        limited to a maximum of two simultaneous users.  Register for
        the full version and give your support for future development!

DESCRIPTION
        HTML-Heaven is a suite of three programs intended to make the
        creation and maintenance of WWW (HTML) pages easy. The programs
        in the suite interface with your favorite editor (providing it
        supports text insertion via ARexx) to provide you with a very
        comfortable environment. Now inserting HTML commands is as simple
        as point and click. This is the upgrade from version 1.0 with a
        host of new features.

            to be in upper or lower case.
          - MENU (COMBINESPLIT) specify if the menu should be with
            submenu's for the different HTML categories. (Like version
            1.0) or that each HTML category gets their own menu.
        * New editors supported. Turbotext and Textra.
        * Now also supports HTML fill-in forms.
        * A number of other HTML commands like <CENTER>, ALT=, HEIGHT=,
          WIDTH=, <HTML> and so on have been added.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        email to Daniel: Daniel.Stenberg@sth.frontec.se
        FidoNet to: 2:201/328

DESCRIPTION

        FrexxEd is probably the most configurable/programmable text editor made
        for the Amiga. It uses the one-window concept, where a multiple of
        views are displayed in the same window.

        The main mission with FrexxEd has been to create an editor which is
        capable of doing whatever *YOU* want it to. To enable *very* much
        reprogramming/configuration for those who feel the need.

        A few of FrexxEd's features include:

        o 100% recursive undo, changeable undobuffer size and on/off toggle
        o unlimited number of buffers/blocks/macros in memory
        o unlimited line lengths and buffer sizes
        o 100% programmable, everything can be done by a script instead of
          interactive
        o *very* C-like programming language (FPL)
        o clipboard support, export to/import from any unit
        o uses V39-style memory pools
        o V39 aware, uses V39 functions when available
        o easy macro record/edit/view/play/save/load
        o customizeable look of any ASCII character (to i.e enable the inverse
          CED-look or the \xxx Emacs-look or...)
        o programmable keyassigns, make any key do anything
        o programmable mouseactions, make any mouse action perform whatever
          you want it to
        o programmable menustrip, make it contain whatever you please!
        o supports XPK and PowerPacker compression/decompression and
          encryption/decryption.
        o startup-script that loads any file into a running editor
        o ARexx port, capable of reading and writing ARexx variables!
        o A *LOT* of additional scripts that perform a multitude of different
          things. From mousedragging-style blockmarking, archive-flag removal
          when saving, center line, binary editor, snake game, incremental
          search, interactive C indenting and word wrap to generic assembler
          filters, bookmarks, backup, autosave and programs that easy
          interfaces RCS...
        o binary loading/editing/saving
        o font sensitive GUI
        o ability to replace/change the workings of any internal function
          through an advanced hooking procedure

NEW FEATURES (since 1.0)

        o Lots of bugs removed.
        o Lots of new functions added.
        o Iconify()/Deiconify() uses appicon
        o Write protected files can't be modified with the 'rwed_sensitive'
          flag set.
        o A *LOT* of New and updated FPL programs
        o Doubleclick on appicon generates an exception which does a
          WindowToFront() by default.
        o Full regular expression search/replace, Emacs/UNIX style.
        o Smaller and faster executable
        o fpl.library v10 with lots of new features (100% ANSI C style when
          dealing with the &&, || and ?: operators, built-in sprintf() and
          more).
        o Time controlled function invokes! Once or repeated.
        o and much, much more...

DESCRIPTION

        ImageDesk is a program to catalog directories of picture
        files. It generates small representations of the pictures
        (so-called "thumbnails") and internally expands them to objects
        which include all essential attributes.  It can save multiple
        thumbnails into a single catalog file for quick availability.
        With XPK installed, it can save files in packed format.

        The following picture formats are currently supported and are
        be recognized automatically:

        * IFF ILBM (std. palette upto 256 cols, EHB, HAM, HAM8, DEEP)
        * GIF (87a, 89a)
        * JPEG (by the use of Christoph Feck's 'Tower JPEG codec') 
        * PCX (1 bit upto 32 bit)
        * BMP (4,8 & 24 bit, OS/2 and Windows formats, unpacked only)
        * PCD (upto BASE size)
        * PNM (P4, P5 und P6)
        * TARGA (all formats)

        ImageDesk 1.2 includes two image viewers (window and screen)
        for displaying pictures corresponding to each thumbnail.
        CyberGraphics and Picasso special screens are supported.
        ImageDesk can also use external picture viewers.

DESCRIPTION
           
         MTool provides all standard features of a directory utility:
         You can use it to copy, move and delete files, analyze a file
         type and perform an action on it (i.e. show pictures or ani-
         mations, play mods, edit texts...).

         MTool handles LHA-archives like ordinary directories. You can
         doubleclick the name of a LHA-archive and its contents will
         be displayed in the filelist. Files can be deleted or copied
         to and from the archive.

         The layout of MTool resembles the good old DiskMaster (V1.4).

         MTool has been developed using the look and feel of OS2.04
         and WB2.1. It works with WB2.0 (not localized, no screen mode
         requester), some features are added with OS3.0; KS1.3 is not
         supported any more. It can be run on an own screen, a public
         screen or on the Workbench (resizable, position and size can
         be configured).

         Docs and/or catalogs are included in English, German, Swedish,
         French, Norwegian, Danish, Italian, Finnish, Dutch and
         Slovakian.

NEW FEATURES

         V2.1:
         - Optional action buttons at bottom of window
         - Directory caching
         - AppIcon
         - Number of selected bytes is displayed immediately
         - Copy/Move as
         - File notes are displayed in file lists
         ...and many more.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

         MTool is shareware. It is freely distributable, as long as
         you distribute all files! Feel free to include it in public
         domain collections (i.e. fishdisks).

REQUIREMENTS

         Workbench 2.04 or higher

         To use the archive support of MTool, you need any version of
         the LHA archiver (not included)

         To view pictures or animations, to play mods etc you need
         programs that can be included in the configuration of MTool. 
         (i.e. VT, Player...)

         To install MTool with its installation script, you need the
         commodore installer (not included)

==                      Amiga Report Mailing List                        ==
===========================================================================

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to jcompton@bbs.xnet.com and in the body of the
message ask nicely to be added to the list.

ie: Please add me to the mailing list for Amiga Report magazine.  My
     addresss is <your net address>.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!             **


          *** The following is only for Australian readers!  ***

To circumvent the new pay-per-megabyte system for Australian Internet
communication, Paul Reece has been kind enough to set up an AUSTRALIAN-ONLY
mailing list, to save his fellow countrymen some money.

You can join the list by sending mail to:   majordomo@info.tas.gov.au

with the single line (in body of message):

Amiga Report will then be bounced to you.

==                        UUDecoding Amiga Report                        ==
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your

                The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
          -------------------------------------------------------

Portal is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-service online SIG
(Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users. We promise, and
WE DELIVER ongoing & aggressive Amiga support!

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in many ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA high-speed modems (you pay for the phone call
if it's not local), or though any SprintNet or Compu$erve indial anywhere
(with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell service!  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help, and you can easily customize
it for your favorite terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1000 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at

 * Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, Elastic

 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.
 * Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
      related and get quick replies from the experts.

      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine.

      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You

      entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  And you get FREE unlimited
      usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting

      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
