Like the new front-page logo?  Then thank Gareth Edwards
(config@ultim.demon.co.uk) for the fine work on short notice.  Thanks,
Gareth.  With the change in look for the old Amiga logo, it was decided
that AR should follow suit.

So, what's news this week?  Well, all of the "official" releases from Amiga
Technologies (both of them) are included in this issue.  As for the news
that comes through the pipeline...sometimes it changes so fast it's
difficult to keep up.  Suffice it to say, there have been no major
developments or changes in Amiga Technologies policy, at least nothing we
can hold them to.  Indications point to a new company called ISE, a startup
totally unrelated and unowned by Escom, that has been subcontracted to do
ALL software and hardware development for the Amiga, leaving Amiga
Technologies to be a marketing and sales company only.

This, in itself, is not necessarily a bad thing.  But more on it as news
becomes available.  Hey, engineering is engineering, it doesn't matter what
the label is, as long as there is quality behind the product.

Engineering.  Sales.  Marketing.  In what other computer or technology
industry do the users pay so much attention to these things?  We are, all
of us, armchair CEOs, PR agents, advertising directors, technical support
personnel and product planners.  Nowhere else in the world could Escom have
found a group of people so willing to speak their minds and share their
thoughts and ideas.

At times, though, it has turned into a shouting match.  "Low signal to
noise", as the disdainers call it.  Just as Amiga magazines exist to
condense news and events into digestible product, this energy needs, has
always needed, a focus-a way to present it in usable form to the Amiga's
owner, without seeming aggressive or overbearing.

Enclosed in this issue you will find M-PLAN, a comprehensive plan for a
first step towards this goal.  Amiga Report highly recommends reading this
document.

Nowhere else in the world is there anything quite like the Amiga, a machine
and a culture that has literally stood on the cutting edge-and the
brink-since its existance, able to change so many minds yet be dismissed
out of hand by so many others.  But the ride, for those who stay and work
with it, is unparallelled.  Nowhere else in the world would an M-PLAN
exist.  There would be no users staying up late into the night just to hear
news of corporate liquidations, no world-class FTP network, no calls to
radio programs just to extoll the virtues of a computer, no vigilant group
of users bursting with ideas and suggestions.  I could never create
anything like Amiga Report anywhere else in the world.  Under the crazy
conditions of the Amiga, these things flourish and form something truly
incredible.

This is it.  What are the options?  Against what seem to be incredible
odds, Amiga Technologies needs all the friends it can get.  Against these
odds, the fight can be given up, the Amiga can become a closet culture and
join the ranks already bursting with the fallen, near forgotten platforms.
But if that happens, not just a computer is lost.  A culture, a community,
a neighborhood, is lost.

It's worth working together for.

Jason,  

I've just read AR314.  And I'm writing (for the first time) to say so long.

During the five or so years that I've owned an Amiga, I've been one of it's
most vehement, confrontational and persuasive proponents in the city I live
in.  Although I own and work at a record store, I am constantly talking
computers with various customers and friends, and have always turned the
conversation into an evangelical plea for the computer users in this
country to drop their PC clones and Mac cubes and invest in a computer that
can truly allow them to lead their lives without the limitations that "the
other two" impose on them.  Don't wait for a disk to format OR a file to
print, buy a computer that can do two things at once.   Don't bother with
DOS or Windows when you can have both.  Don't spend money on another 4Meg
SIMM, buy a computer that sips memory like a bird.   Don't worry about
spending money and time on graphics adapters and sound cards, buy a
computer that has it already, for no "extra" and which needs no IRQ's.
Don't buy a computer that requires you to pay for style and name and
condescends to your serious needs, buy one that is built on substance and
open-endedness.

And you know, a very few people actually listened, and went out of their
way (55 miles to nearest dealer from my apartment in Huntington, WV) to
purchase an Amiga.

But their are some very odd facts that have kept most people in the land of
the "others".  This is how I see the past, present and future of the Amiga
in the United States.

First, and foremost, I've got to speak on the most trivial aspect of the
Commodore Amiga, the name. 

The first thing anybody in the US remembers about Commodore is the C64 that
is still sitting in their old room at their parents house, gathering dust,
or possibly still being used by Mom to write you letters while you're in
college.  The next thing they remember is...  nothing for a LONG time.
Then they hear that Commodore, makers of the Amiga computer, are out of
business.  They have probably heard of the Toaster, of course, but that is
often mistakenly associated to the Mac platform in the mass media (I guess
they figure that if it doesn't look like a Windows screen, then it must be
a Mac).  Maybe a lucky soul like the ones here in Huntington have a wacky
friend who is willing to go out on a limb and rant for an hour about a
computer that they have never even seen, and so, vicariously, experience
the Amiga's better qualities.  But mostly, when you say "Amiga", people say
"Huh?". 

Strike One; no brand recognition, except nostalgia, in a country that
cannot see the Amiga through the haze of commercials and hype for those
other brands.  No Wal-Mart circular has ever sported an Amiga, overpriced
or not.  No funny logo or commercial with cool monks has ever swayed an
opinion toward the Amiga.  No hour-long, overly-friendly,
three-easey-payments infomercial has taken up a lazy Sunday afternoon and
tempted the credit card holder to "Go Amiga, Amigo".  Nothing.  And that is
nobody's fault any more.  That's all history.

The second item is a case in point.

A close friend, after years of using a Mac Classic, was considering the
jump to another platform.  He wanted to be able to do musical stuff,
mostly, so I went to bat for the Amiga.  I showed him how similar my OS was
to his Mac's, I showed him catalogs and Amiga World's and talked a good
game.  Another friend was leading him toward the Atari, and still another
was a Mac user and told him it was easier to stay Mac.  The Connectix
QuickCam decided it all for him.  A $99 camera and clever software.  The
closest thing on the Amiga is $250 or so, and we couldn't find anything
like it for the Atari.  He saw that thing in a big, glossy, well planned
and executed MacMall catalog.  On the next page he saw a Powerbook 150 for
$999, he picked up the phone at 8pm that evening, and had them at his door
at 11am the next morning.  Just like that, another potential Amiga buyer is
lost due to, in my opinion, the combination of three things, that tie very
closely together (as any Marketing 101 prof would tell you), product,
placement, and promotion.

Strike Two; the Amiga loses on product because it has steadily become more
expensive to own, relative to the others.  Commodore has always gone the
low-end/high-end route and there was never an Amiga that carried that most
ideal of computer price tags $1500.  Always a cheap-o unit and a
"professional" model.  The former was regarded as a toy (fair or not, that
is what many consumers feel when they see Amigas only slighly more
expensive than a game machine) and the latter was always just a little out
of range.  Also, I've never heard of an Amiga buyer picking up the phone
and getting their system next-day-aired to them.  As a matter of fact, I
know a guy who paid for a defective A1200, and after grudgingly returning
it, waited over a year before getting his money back and moving on.  One
final dig at every potential buyer out their is the incredibly inflated
used market, where you'd better be willing to pay near retail for a used,
hacked, or (often) stock system. 

As for placement, well, we all have vented plenty about how Amigas should
have been donated to schools and businesses for legitimization purposes,
and how a nice catalog from a vendor would be great to lure prospective
buyers.  No offense to anyone out there who has struggled to continue
selling Amigas, but the catalogs that I have seen from several companies
fail on many levels to both show the power of the Amiga and to properly
place and market their products.  The best I saw were those from Amigaman
and Tenex, but even they were not up to par.

And as far as promotion is concerned, no amount of money could reverse the
horrible lack of even simple concern that Commodore showed to its own user
base, let alone begin to establish the Amiga in this country as a viable
alternative to the might of Microsoft, IBM or Apple.

And now we learn from AR (love you guys and wish you the best), that the
A1200, Escom's only real hope for digging into the mass market in this
country, is dead.  The A4000T is going to be outrageously overpriced and
still missing the essentials in a computer of that price level, a CDROM,
16bit sound, 24bit graphics, and a monitor.  No hope for even an '030 1200,
or a 1200CD, or anything, except that (now) $2700 A4000.

Strike Three.

I've tried for years to help this computer system out in a very real way. 
I talked to people around me and tried to sway opinion.  I played salesman
and never got (nor would have accepted) any commission, attention, or even
thanks.  I often just got dull stares, but still that didn't dim my
enthusiastic light.  I wanted people to see that light.  Now I realize that
that light is a cop, and he works for Escom, and he wants me to step out of
the car, please.

Enough is enough.

I only hope that those folks over at the Amiga OS replacement project are
cooking up something big, because my next computer, unfortunately, will be
something that won't be able to give me AmigaDOS.

And I hope that all of you out there would consider this letter an
expression of my current state of mind and a product of years of
desparately clinging to the hope that the Amiga would pull through, and not
and excuse to flame me to prove your undying loyalty.  But if you must,
well, bring it on, I can take it.

Respectfully,
David Bias

-    I haven't heard anything out of the Amiga OS Project for months now.
     But if it's a reason to stick with the Amiga you're looking for, I can
     only offer the fact that we have one of the most unique communities in
     the world.  That, and we're the last barrier to complete
     Microsoft/Apple dominance in all but the smallest of niche and
     enthusiast markets (Atari ST, C-64, et al).  Tough job, big
     responsibility, I know.  But that's what AR is for-to make coping with
     the responsibility a bit easier.  -Jason

Hi Jason,

Well, I just got done reading the "Escom/U.S.  distributor meeting" article
in AR 3.14 & it really depressed me.  I can say that I will not be buying a
4000T as I had anticipated.  I just cannot see me putting anymore money
into this platform (and I have spent SEVERAL thousand dollars on it
already).  It seems, from what I read between the lines anyway, that they
are going in for a quick kill, recoup some of their bucks & that will then
be the end.  Maybe I am wrong, but that is the impression that article gave
me.  I have been running The Gateway BBS on Amiga's for several years,
starting out with an A500 with a GVP A530 & finally moving up to the
current system which is built around an A3000T.  I won't go into all the
details of the system as that is irrelevant to this letter but I have
definetely been a staunch supporter of the Amiga platform & always been
more than happy to show it off to my ibm users.  Many have been impressed
but there will always be others that go through life with blinders on &
will not believe anything besides what microsoft tells them to believe.  I
will continue to run The Gateway BBS on my Amiga 3000T till it dies but I
will move on to other computers so that I do not fall behind on my
knowledge of different systems.  I currently have a home built clone
running linux & it works quite well so I will not be without a computer
when the 3000T dies.  My hopes had been high for Amiga Technologies but now
my heart aches miserably.  :( I hope my feelings are wrong but
unfortunately all the signs are there telling me I am not.  I guess I
should close this out...I just needed to get it off my chest, so to speak.

-    Everyone, AR included, wants the respective gut feelings worldwide to be
     wrong.  Amiga Technologies is made up of falliable human beings like
     the rest of us.  Unfortunately, the task ahead doesn't allow for many
     cock-ups.  Hopefully, the right decisions will be made, and soon.

Here's a quick hack review fo Amijam calgary.  Not as big of a turnout as I
thought, but I thought it was worth the 5 hour drive I made to attend.  
Good deals on stuff (If I had any money :-) And the seminars easily
justified the trip.

RAM not an issue since it can be bought after
No drives
Easily pay $3000 US but don't want to pay $3500 Bare bones with an I want
EsCom to do some good with our machine, and I want a 4000T as badly as
anyone, but face it, as Amiga users, we are not stupid.

I would find it very hard to justify $3500 US for a 4000T, I'd rather buy
the Teraclipse 233Mhz DEC Alpha for that price, and we've owned Amiga's
since the 1000.  If they price it too high, everyone might wait for the
next generation of Amiga, but with everyone waiting, no money will be
spent, EsCom will think Amiga is a dog and drop it.  I think $2000 - $2500
is more in line for what they want to offer in a 4000T.  First off, the RAM
would have to be updated, and then the Processor, not to mention a 540 MB
drive is almost getting a little small these days.

But hey, who am I, no one, just a rabid Amiga user like all the others who
are hoping for some good to come from this sale.  Amiga users are really a
devout community who have supported our platform through these dark times,
but I think we deserve a little respect.  Because we are hungry for new
machines, hopefully we won't be taken advantage of.

Cloanto PNG Toolkit

When we heard news that several, very popular, graphics formats were
menaced by software patents, at Cloanto we took a strong position in favor
of a new, improved format: PNG (Portable Network Graphics).  This format
was designed in a joint effort of experts from all over the Internet
community as a replacement and extension to GIF and LZW-based TIFF, after
Unisys Corporation began demanding royalties on GIF/LZW code.

PNG is gaining general recognition as the best lossless format for storing
digital images.  (JPEG remains recommended for storing real world images
where minimum storage occupation is a priority and loss of information is
acceptable.) PNG has the potential to replace both GIF and TIFF, and as a
unifying force it should attract more attention beyond that.

Cloanto developed a toolkit containing a PNG DataType for the Amiga (68000
and 68020 versions), some background information on the GIF controversy and
PNG, sample source code to use DataTypes and an ARexx script (designed for
Personal Paint) to automatically find GIFs and convert them to PNG.  The
latest version of the png.datatype (v.  43.0) supports 24-bit DataType tag
extensions, and can pass true color data to supporting applications (e.g. 
Cybergraphics software).

The PNG Toolkit is distributed freely over the Internet, via Aminet.  An
extended version of the toolkit, with PNG test files, full PNG specs,
documentation and reference source code is included on the Cloanto Personal
Suite CD-ROM.

as follows:

      650M of software newer than Aminet CD 6 (more than ever before)
      350M of images
       50M of top downloads

    These consist of:
      1500 pictures   (+7700 clip art images in large archives)
      1250 tools
       380 mods
       130 games
        70 demos

The pictures were collected from various sources besides Aminet, and will

single mouse click.

Extensive search facilities.  Finds words in descriptions or readmes, and
outputs matches as an index that allows direct viewing.

New access features for the following categories of files:

- Images: All .jpg images can now be converted to IFF using a single mouse
  click.  There is also a simple batch conversion facility.

- Clip art: The clip art images on the CD are organized in large archives
  but can be displayed individually.  The clip art has meaningful names and
  sometimes comments.  Clip art can be viewed using thumbnails, slide shows
  or descriptions.  There is also a textual search facility for the clip art.

- Software changes: The 'Find' program can search for several words at a
  time now, PicZoo has comments for many pics and runs on gfx boards (at
  least with clip art).  And of course various bug fixes.

@node NEWS6 "CyberGraphX 2.08 Available"
@toc NEWS

The CyberGraphX system was designed to define an independant graphics
standard for graphics boards.  We also wanted to continue our development
of graphics extensions.  We could include all our knowledge of about 3
years of gfx board software development (graphics extensions for visiona,
domino, picassoII and now the cybervision64).

CyberGraphX is based on hardware dependant monitor drivers and hardware
independant libraries.  This has some advantages: Bug fixes in the graphics
extension or speed optimizations is of benefit for ALL gfx boards that are
supported by the CyberGraphX system.

CyberGraphX allows using of 15/16/24 screens independant of the used color
model.  You are able to use the cybergraphics.library functions to modify
this screens.

Currently there are versions for:  Domino
                                   PicassoII
                                   GVP Spectrum
                                   Piccolo Z2/3
                                   RetinaZ3
                                   Cybervision
                                   PiccoloSD64

From now on each update will have its own version number.  We left the old
version numbering which was derived from the version number of the main
library (cybergraphics.library).  The archive is now called CGraphX20u.lha
because we changed the whole system name from CyBERgraphics to CyberGraphX.
The product has gone commercial now.  A complete archive with some features
disabled will be available in biz/demo soon.  Full versions will be
available from Softwood in US or phase5 in Germany.  More information about
that topic will follow in the complete aminet archive.

TITLE

  ShapeShifter

VERSION

  3.1

AUTHOR

  Christian Bauer

  EMail: bauec002@goofy.zdv.uni-mainz.de
  SMail: Christian Bauer, Langenaustr.65, 56070 Koblenz, Germany

DESCRIPTION

ShapeShifter is a multitasking shareware Macintosh-II emulator for the
Amiga computer.  It allows to run Macintosh software concurrently to Amiga
applications without hardware add-ons or modifications.

Some of the emulation's features:

   - Color display up to 256 colors on AGA Amigas (16 colors on ECS)
     and up to 16,7 million colors on graphics cards
   - No MMU required, even runs on A1200
   - Macintosh hard disks can be simulated in Amiga files or Amiga
     hard disk partitions
     [unregistered version has no hard disk partition support]
   - Can use Amiga floppy drives, serial, parallel and SCSI ports
     from the Mac
     [use of SCSI not possible in unregistered version]
   - Mac HD disks can be read directly with an HD floppy drive,
     Mac 720K disks can be used with any Amiga floppy drive. To use
     Mac 800K disks, you have to own CrossMAC and an original Mac
     drive
   - Multichannel sound output and parallel-port sound digitizers
     supported
   - Access to Ethernet networks
   - Text clipboard sharing between Mac and Amiga
   - File handler to access Macintosh volumes from the Workbench
   - Speed comparable to a real Mac with equivalent hardware

The most important changes in V3.1:

   - The SCSI routines have been completely rewritten. If you continue
     to encounter incompatibilities with certain SCSI devices, it's
     most probably a hardware or driver problem.
   - AppleScript runs
   - EtherTalk is fully supported
   - ShapeShifter can now use external video drivers. To make a start,
     a "Retina Z3" driver is being supplied.
   - The graphics refresh in Amiga Bitplanes modes is faster.
   - "MacMem" is now integrated into "PrepareEmul".
   - DeviceDisks can now be used with removable media.
   - The 68060 FPU is recognized correctly
   - The "ShapeShifter PRAM" file format has changed. But a file in
     the old format is recognized automatically and converted on the
     next shutdown.
   - Those who own "CrossDOS" or "CrossMAC" and a Macintosh 800K disk
     drive supported by CrossMAC can read and write Macintosh 800K DD
     disks with ShapeShifter (truly spoken, this always worked with
     ShapeShifter). AMAX and Emplant formatted 800K disks can also be
     accessed, then.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

OS2.1, 68020 processor, 4MB of RAM, HD floppy drive recommended.  A copy

JULY 25, 1995

GEOFFREY WILLIAMS' INTERACTIVE GUIDE TO DIGITAL VIDEO AND MULTIMEDIA

The complete cross platform guide to digital video and multimedia
production for those using an Amiga computer is now available in a special
offer at a significant savings.  Eighteen megabytes of data, over 100
freely distributable interactive programs and utilities, over 100,000 words
by Geoffrey Williams describing everything from how to translate file
formats between different computers to the basics of 3D animation. 

It will keep your Amiga an active part of your work environment, even if
you now primarily use a Mac or PC, and will provide you with many utilities
that will never be made available commercially.

This is a digital book, with search capabilities, an easy to use interface,
and direct access to all of the programs from the text.  You never have to
use the Workbench or a CLI to launch a program, or worry about how to make
a program work or set it up or install it- click a button in the text and
the program is launched.  IGDVM installs easily from compressed floppy
disks. 

Now just $40!!! 

That's cheaper than if you were to buy equivalent shareware disks, without
the complete guide and without the hypertext interface.  An incredible
price for an incredible resource.  Why so cheap?  While the Amiga market
continues, I had to move on to other things during the long period of
uncertainty.  With the loss of so many advertising and distribution
channels, there is no real way to make any money off of this project,
despite hundreds of hours of work.  My loss is your gain, as I'm selling at
a giveaway price, so that at least some of you will be able to take
advantage of all it has to offer.

Here's a listing of the contents:

Animation- Introduction to how computers create animation.  How to get the
fastest animation play back, including design tips and information on hard
drive play back and various hardware options.  The basic animation formats
on Amiga, PC, and Mac.  Includes tools to edit animations, translate them
into different file formats, and play them back, including directly from
the hard drive to play animations larger than memory.

Sound- The importance of sound design.  Sound manipulation and editing
basics.  Copyright laws and fair use.  Sound formats on Mac, PC, and Amiga.
Synchronizing sound to video.  Includes utilities to translate sound file
formats, edit sounds, synchronize sounds to animation, and create sounds. 

Music- Music and copyright law.  Algorithmic music generation.  MIDI
basics.  Music resources for buy-out and licensed music.  Includes
utilities to playback, create, and compose music. 

Compression- How compression works.  Com- pression standards on different
computer platforms.  Includes utilities for compression and decompression
as well as compression tools for non-24 bit images.

Fonts- The basics of font design.  Font formats on all computer platforms.
Using fonts in video titling.  Font layout tips.  Includes 30 scaleable
video fonts. 

Clip Art- Types of clip art.  Organizing your clip art collections. 
Copyright issues.  How to use clip art in video, even if it was designed
for print.  How to make dithered clip art look like 24 bit.  Clip art
resource guide.  Includes almost 2 megabytes of clip art.

Image Processing- Basic image processing capabilities and how to use them.
File formats on Mac, PC and Amiga and conversion issues.  The merging of
paint and image processing features.  Some advantages of Amiga image
processing programs that might make you hold onto your Amiga a little
longer.  Morphing tips.  Copyright laws as they pertain to the manipulation
of images.  Also included is a great image processing program that can do
effects over time for animation, and includes some very neat effects not
available in commercial programs.  You also get a great morphing program,
which can also do animation and even handle moving morphs (where you morph
two different animations or moving video sequences).  There are also
utilities that will convert most image file formats on the PC and Mac to
Amiga format and back.

Algorithmic Image Generation- An explanation of how computers generate
images using mathematical algorithms.  You also get utilities for
generating fractal clouds and scenery, Brownian motion, Mandelbrot and
Julia Sets, Lyapunov space, DLA fractals, iterated functions, and much
more.

3D Animation- Basic 3D terminology.  Single frame recording.  Rendering
services resource guide.  Real time playback options.

Video Basics- How video works.  Sync and TBCs.  Keying.  Computer graphics
and potential problems with their translation to video.  Monitor adjustment
and video signal testing.  Time Code.  Video Toaster basics.  Resource
guide to Video Toaster utilities.  Resource guide to video editing
software.  Resource guide to Amiga video hardware.  What you need to set up
your own video editing bay, with options for a variety of budgets.
Includes video utilities and test screens. 

Digital Video- Introduction to non-linear editing.  Round-up of hardware,
including NewTek's Flyer.  The limitations and mythology behind non-linear
editing.

CD-ROM- How the CD-ROM market is developing.  How to create your own
CD-ROMs.  How to get your film developed directly onto Photo-CD, and the
advantages of the Photo-CD format.  Resource guide to CD-ROMs.  Includes
utilities for loading Photo-CD images, a CD-ROM file system, and audio
control. 

Planning and Organizing Multimedia Presentations- Flow charts. 
Storyboarding.  Hardware selection.  Laser disc and video.  Preparing the
graphics.  Preparing the audio.  Programming.  How to save money at every
step.  Multimedia and presentation programs.

The Business End- Setting up shop.  What to charge.  Costing out a project.
Contracts.  The Business Plan.  Creating a demo reel.  Creating inexpensive
but impressive customized promotional pieces.  Negotiation basics.  The
Sales Meeting market.  Future opportunities in digital video, digital book
publishing, entertainment, and cable. 

Resource Guides- Information on suppliers of hardware, software, production
music, CD-ROM mastering services, slide transfer services, rendering
services, stock photos and video, Photo-CD, magazines, trade shows and
conferences, and much more.

                 M-PLAN: A PROPOSAL TO THE AMIGA COMMUNITY
  Giorgio Gomelsky                                        gio@phantom.com
===========================================================================

[Read this.  -Jason]

Introduction
------------
Recent events in the AMIGA community have ignited a voluminous amount of
vigorous and spirited reactions.  True to their unflinching dedication and
their heartfelt loyalty to this most singular of machines(!!) - unmatched
anywhere in computer chronicles - AMIGA users have once more manifested
their indisputable common sense, their vigour, vitality and serious
concern.  (Sounding of trumpets!)

Although, and as usual, one could quibble, bicker and brawl about some of
the argumentations, (see newsgroups!) to an observer, the urgent need for
the advent in the AMIGA community of a whole new spirit, energy, mood and
substance, appears as a self-evident summation.  Gone must be the traumas,
disappointments and yes, betrayals, of yesteryear.  Gone must be the
old-fashioned separation between user and manufacturer, gone must be the
sense and practice of isolation and exclusion.

Approaching the year 2000 we are now entering a new and most revolutionary
phase of our civilisation.  We have the technology to discover more and
more how the universe functions, to invent solutions to nagging, stubborn
age-old problems and conflicts, yes, and why not, to create better
conditions on this small yet wondrous planet.

Anyone who has seen the documentary THE HISTORY OF THE AMIGA knows that the
motives of the original team were pretty close to this ideology.  That's
why they called their invention AMIGA, friend.  We the users are the
inheritors of this spirit, of this dedication and have proven our
fortrightness and tenacity many, many times.

We owe ourselves a big pat on the back for having kept the faith.

We are entering the second computer-wave.  Technical advances are now going
hand in hand with with almost instant applications and increase of interest
by the lay population.  NetScape is a hit on Wall Street, Apple
underestimated the demand for their new PowerPCs, only about 35% of homes
in the US have computers.  There is big "frontier" out there and it is
opening up very fast.

Through the development of new media, marketing techniques are also
changing at lightning speed.  We're about to get cruising on the Global
InfoBahn.  We better sort out where we want to go...:)))

The main underlying issue in marketing-PR is CREDIBILITY and the best
advertising money you can spend is in achieving it.  One of the very latest
marketing concepts is what in "marketese" is called THE POWER OF THIRD
PARTY ENDORSEMENTS.  What it means is this:

What better if your credibility doesn't come from your own statements,
pronouncements and hype but from being "endorsed" by your clients (users),
press, media and other observers?  You are saying nothing, they, the third
parties, do it for you.  What better way of attracting attention?  Of
making old and new users feeling cool and energized?  Of expanding your
market share, of gaining a great reputation?

The enormous, practically incalculable, advantage the AMIGA has over any
startups is its history, its survival, its existing USER BASE.  Any first
year student of marketing will tell you, having done a proper SITUATION
ANALYSIS that the

              #1 STRATEGIC MARKETING OBJECTIVE should be

             REWARD AND MAINTENANCE OF CURRENT CONSUMERS

the rationale being, quite simply, that user loyalty cannot be bought! 
Furthermore, by calling for their participation in a new venture you give
them a VESTED INTEREST in the success thereof.  You might call this an
ORGANIC MARKETING STRATEGY.  Chief benefit of this is the strengthening of
loyalty, establishment of solid TRUST and ENDORSEMENT and, wait, the
eventual purchase of new equipment!  AMIGA users are known to own more then
one machine, to be upgrade freaks and great "spielers" for their machine. 
Perfect "mouthpieces", wouldn't you say?

So, the worse that can happen in this situation is to scare, fail to
re-assure and terminally alienate the existing user-base.

One of the principal research tools in marketing is the FOCUS GROUP.  AMIGA
users are a ready-made and huge focus group.  Since time immemorial they
have wished nothing better than to be used as such.  But AMIGA users are
more that that too.  They are a kind of CULTURE.  Unique in their
passionate pursuit of solutions with perhaps the best PD, share-ware,
free-ware, gift-ware, what have you, developers; scores of volunteer
writers, online magazine-publishers, proselytizers, marketeers,
dealers-wealers, artists, musicians, multi-media authors, intro-demo
producers, videomakers, animators.  They cover a vast area of activity, are
immensely talented and resourceful and, for the most part, no quitters.

Not to consider them in any meaningful marketing plan is a serious mistake.
They ARE the AMIGA's best friend.  This is why I have taken off a day from
work to put out to the "AMIGA community" (or perhaps we should call it
"neighborhood"?  this proposal for a plan.  It is not polished and is not
meant to be a final document.  It is meant to stimulate and encourage
ideas.

:market alone could make AmiTek/Escom richer than Croesus. You will not
:make these big  bucks by nickle and dimeing it. This is also a big risk
:high stakes game it will cost serious $$$ to get into the game, and to
:win. In poker, it always comes down to smarts and guts. That is the way it
:is in business too.

Hear, hear!!!  These comments are definitely on target.  With such an
"original" as the Amiga one could map out a marketing/promotion and PR
campaign that would be a killer...

This plan presupposes that the "many-to-many, one-to-one/many to one, not
few to all, all to none, etc..!!" mode, is now practicable.


                           M-PLAN DRAFT #1
                           ---------------

PART ONE: THE USERS

FIRST OFF:  Create the INTERNATIONAL AMIGA USERS GROUP (working title)
            Create, activate and  develop a dynamite world-wide website

(At the core of this group there could be THE AMIGA WISE MAN COUNCIL - in
memory of J.Miner - Honoring prominent personalities in the AMIGA community
from developers to users, also a kind of AMIGA HALL OF FAME and
SHAME!!;)...

This council, in true Amiga tradition, could, of course be called upon to
ponder, fight over, provoke, insult, forgive and consider any questions
that might need answering.

Its members would act as "omboudsmen" and regularly be available for
conferences on IRC and other devices...

THEN:        Establish and open up a WWW communication system
             with all existing users groups and unattached users
             and put a team equipped with the necessary talents
             in charge of organizing and maintaining it.

                       THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING!!

Thanks to John Paden from AMIGA USERS GROUP in Lawrence, Kansas:
dangermo@falcon.cc.ukans.edu Here is his report:

John Paden says:

"As I understand it the three purposes of the IAUG group are:

(1) Provide an incredible resource of information on the Amiga computer and
give the Amiga community the ability to contribute to the resource which is
what will give it power.

(2) A communication tool to Escom AT.  Something through which the user can
speak and listen to Escom AT.

(3) To make sure a similar situation as with Commodore does not arise
again.

For this purpose I have set up a IAUG page.

My main intention is to provide a great resource for Amiga
developers/users/possible buyers.  The only way to do this is to get every
one involved in donating information to the pages.  I'll try to explain the
pages more precisely:

AMIGA USERS GROUPS
Fairly straight forward...  It is a list of all the user groups I've
collected.  This is where I could use the most help.  I have the list from
Amiga Shopper, but the task is rather daunting and it would be great if
usergroups or members thereof could send in info.

INTERNATIONAL AMIGA USERS GROUP MEMBERSHIP LIST
Also straight forward once membership is opened

INDIVIDUAL AMIGA OWNERS/USERS LIST
Immagine having a list of all Amiga owners?  Very ambitious but not
impossible...

AMILETTE (Amiga Roulette!)
This is just a fun thing for people to click on that will take them to a
random web site that has something to do with the Amiga.   It will be
chosen from the Amiga Resource Database.

DATABASE OF RESOURCES
This is just a long list of all the Amiga resources and links to them that
we can possibly find.  This is the source of the Amilette.  We want to
describe the sites a little and I'm going to end up placing them all in a
file and write a program that build the page and also takes care of
Amilette.

AMIGA ROUND TABLE
Meetings on IRC or other channels, like eventually ACuSeeMe and other
conferencing devices.

Discussions etc...digests...

DEVELOPERS being written at this very moment by Chris Hall,
chall@clover.cleaf.com

PRESENTATIONS
This is for Amiga User Groups for putting on presentations.  I know as the
president of the Lawrence Amiga Users Group it's a real pain to have to put
a presentation on every month on two or three programs or pieces of
hardware.  This is part of my original idea.  People could just send me
whatever they had done or a link to their resource and I would add a link
to that particular piece of software/hardware's page.

QUESTIONARES/SURVEYS
This is our interface to the user AND to Escom/AT.  With Amosaic 2.0 out
this is a viable option.

COMMENTS ON THE AMIGA PAGES
So people can leave comments about the pages.  Improvements/Ideas/etc.,

AMIGA RESOURCE PAGE
Michael Witbrock's "Amiga Home Page"

AMIGA TECHNICAL PAGE
Information on Amiga systems.There doesn't seem to be any where you can go
to get all the information about a certain Amiga computer.  I want to
compile all the resources on the net as well as start adding stuff to it.

INFORMATION ON AMIGA PERIPHERALS
This would have links to different resources on Amiga peripherals.  For
instance video cards, sound cards, and monitors.  I want to include more
hardware information and programming information.

INFORMATION ON NEW AMIGA PRODUCTS
This would have links to all the information on upcoming products.  i.e.
A4000T and A1200.

VIDEO/MULTIMEDIA APPLICATIONS
Links to Toaster, gfx, music websites etc.,

The main point of all this is the collection of data and to inspire people
to contribute resources to the pages.  The International Amiga Users Group
should bo a resource from which people can draw to get information
(including developers!) - and I mean useful information, not useless
information that no one's going to use.  The other purpose of the
International Amiga Users Group is to interface with Escom/AT.  It is very
hard to make a difference as one person, but as a large community of users
we can give them suggestions and advice that they would not normally have
access to.  There is also the fear that Escom/AT may be performing somewhat
like Commodore did, maybe not as bad, but possibly detrimental to the Amiga
society.  One way they can show their goodwill and intent is for them to
participate and help in all this (see M-PLAN further on).  Right now Amiga
is riding on a thin wire, but it can recover and make a comeback if we find
intelligent ways to operate and Escom/AT goes along with it.  It is in
their and our MUTUAL interest.

I set up this system so it's easy enough to add any other links to it.  I
still have work to do on the server side, and that is what I'm going to be
doing as well as enrolling and finishing up on the web browser I'm working
on to release to the public.  I hope this covers everything..."

                    http://www.omnipresence.com/Amiga/
                then to The International Amiga Users Group


PART TWO:   USERS-ESCOM/AT INTERFACE & PARTICIPATION


Create a worldwide AMIGAUSERS-ESCOM/AT connection
-------------------------------------------------
1.  ESCOM/AT offers to pay for every users-group to get internet access
($20/month for 6 months, on average) to receive regular reports about their
meetings, their opinions, information about dealers, events, etc.,etc

2.  Where there are no groups, ESCOM/AT offers 100 un-attached and
qualified Amiga owners worldwide internet connection as AMIGA SPECIAL
CORRESPONDENTS.  (A kind of Amiga Corps!) In return ESCOM/AT will have
access to regular "localized" info/feedback as needed.

3.  Ask each and everyone concerned in the above "network" how they can
help; groups could organise small shows, demos, events, individuals could
send information on what their friends (probably mac or pc users!) are
saying about and doing with their computers (a sort of Personal
Intelligence service to get the "lay of the land" in the competition.) This
would allow for very up-to- date feedback for determining "next step
strategies".

4.  Set up a user-developer area where these two groups could be in
constant touch with eachother and developers can use as feed-back.  (See,
further on, The Developers Participation article)

5.  Set up a "regional" promotional support system (eventually in
conjunction with designated local dealers,say),with a pool of machines and
applications groups and individuals could borrow and use for specific
events, demonstrations, competitions, etc., (Say 30 to cover the country)

6.  Collaborate and sponsor AMI-EXPOS, like the ones AMUSE NEW YORK did,
say 4 per year in various locations.  Set up "open devcons" where everyone
can particpate free.

7.  Sponsor an ongoing multimedia AMIGA FESTIVAL with a yearly competition
and awards event (at one of the expos, e.g) with serious prizes, in
kind/cash.  (An offshoot of this could be a source of ideas for logos,
adverts, commercials and promotions).

8.  In conjunction with distributors/dealers and groups and where possible,
set up AMIGA RESOURCE dept.in stores and pay young people to organize
demonstrations for different levels of students from various schools, and
local associations (senior citizens, lawyers etc.) with perhaps special
attention to arts/graphics/music; eventually even visit schools for on the
spot demos, which could include online connections/visits to famous Amiga
users and websites.

When ready with new machines do the same as above but aimed at professional
users, like MANNY'S in NY does regularly for musicians.

9.  Collaborate in producing a monthly AMIGA TV show for syndication and
public-access distribution.  (Here in NYC we already are on the air on
Manhattan Neighborhood Network, bi-monthly with AMUSE-TV)

PART 3: ESCOM/AT
 
10.Design an initial ad campaign, again based on ideas and work submitted
by real users.  For instance:

With the exception of the AMIGA logo, buy totally empty pages in magazines
and say

                           WE ARE AMIGA TECHNOLOGIES:

                                 WATCH US GROW

and during the next few months begin to fill the page with designs, views
and news, lists of stores new users, developers, applications, website
infos, best computer jokes, anecdotes, quotes from newsgroups, digests.
etc.,etc.  cleverly laid out, of course.

11.  Sponsor a competition for and pay for the printing of stickers and
other cool merchandizing materials, t-shirts, etc.,

12.  Produce a 30 min killer infomercial not using actors but real users
and why not, when ready, work towards a "battle of the platforms..." a la
MCI/ATT battle.  (Apple just put out an immensely successful one for their
"Bring Learning Home" campaign selling Performas)

13.  Sponsoring of a travelling event, like a combination demonstration bus
and "cyber-rave- party" to tour the country and appear in clubs, colleges
at computer fairs and in big and small stores.  (This could work as
follows: In the afternoon appear at some store near a college, like in
Harvard MASS.  at the LEARNING SMITH store and in the evning throw a party
at a local club).  Such a "circuit" could be based on info gathered from
local groups/users and would sponsor AMIGA musicians/artists etc., as well
as demonstrate machines and software.  An occasion also to invite local
press and media.

COSTS OF USERS PARTICIPATION

As SYMS CLOTHING say on their commercial "An informed customer is our best
customer", "maintaining credibility" is the #1 object of public relations
and with customers having access to more and more information, PR is
growing more important than straight advertising in the marketing mix and
first off, a hip PR company that would be turned on by such a plan should,
of course be retained.  I know of a few good ones.

In the present circumstances I don't have the time to propose an in-depth
budget, but here are some thoughts:

Since, in part, the above plan deals with a new area, the users
participation, it's difficult to precisely quantify the costs.  Say 200
usergroups and 100 individuals get support for being "connected" for 6
months at roughly $20/mo, this would come to $6,000 US/mo and over 6 months
to $36,000 or $72,000/yr a paltry sum compared to more traditional
advertising costs and with much deeper penetration.

Apart from the highly precise and focussed feedback this would deliver,
figure the amount of press-coverage such a collaboration between users and
manufacturer could gather in column/inches.  All the other items, with the
exception of the TV show (which could be co-sponsored by third party
developers, software companies, dealers and distributors) and the
Infomercial, could cost very little and yield high degrees of
coverage-ratio.

Much of the print advertising could also be co-operative.  The 100 or so
odd machines for demonstration purposes would cost whatever they'll costs
(?), we don't know and no doubt other items will need to be worked out.
      
Whole in whole an initial "soft-sell" campaign based on the above would
make the AMIGA and its manufacturers very visible indeed at a fraction of
the costs of "mainstream" approaches.

Leaning on the already existing and best support system there is for the
AMIGA, its users, allowing them to actively participate in the building of
a broader base, would in itself be worthy of media-coverage which in turn
would amount to free advertising of inestimable value.  Furthermore the
good-will thus created could just not be paid for by ordinary publicity
budgets.


CONCLUSION

What we all suffered from under C= was EXCLUSION.  ESCOM should agressively
go the opposite way towards INCLUSION and turn this into a tool for new
marketing methods, such as are being pursued by hip companies, like, don't
laugh, BEN&JERRY, THE BODY SHOP, and others, who have gotten a lot of
exposure for breaking the "corporate" mold by participating among other
things in local socio-cultural events, by creating scholarships or
donating a percentage of their profits to educational or worthwhile causes.

I know this all implies a very shrewd understanding of the new forces at
work in society and marketing, and a considerable immagination on the part
of "corporate" thinkers to see further than their noses and show innovative
and original enterpreunership.

Difficult times need intelligent, well-informed, courageous and dynamic
leadership.  The AMIGA community is crying out for such a lead.  The man
that brings this off could well become very, very fast a serious player on
the worldwide computer scene.  It seems to me that ESCOM's main man,
Manfred Schmitt has this possibility right now.  He seems to have the
ability, intelligence, ambition and the means to undertake such an
adventure and leave the kind of mark on the info-age business that the
AMIGA potential still makes possible.  Implementing the above
recommandations would surely be a way of starting the ball (!) rolling (not
bouncing?!).

                        THE HUNT FOR commodore.com
  Karl Jeacle                                             jk@broadcom.ie
==========================================================================

[commodore.com disappeared, not surprisingly, with the auction of the
company.  But it's back, and the net community has taken notice.  After
some initial stabs were taken, Karl Jeacle went in for a close
look...-Jason]

I decided to do a little more digging.  Log of what I found attached below.

In summary, there are a few machines running on a commodore.com LAN.  You
can't send mail to the commodore.com domain (no MX records), but there is
an SMTP daemon running on a mail machine.  Internet access is provided by
Net Access of Philadelphia (www.netaxs.com).

It's the same set of IP addresses register a few years ago, but
configuration has definately changed.  I remember doing this in 1993 and
getting long lists of engineering machines.

===========================================================================
                         THE LATEST INTERNET SCAM
  Chris E. Donnell                                   cdonnell@infinet.com
===========================================================================

[Amiga Report is listed on a number of Internet directories for online
magazines.  One of them has spawned an informal mailing list.  This is one
of the more interesting postings that has come across it.  And I think >I<
have problems. -Jason]

Hello, my name is Chris Donnell and the events in the last few weeks have
left me both shocked and cynical about the way businesses practice in the
United States.  Being an entrepreneur myself, I thought that I was one of
the least gullable people but I found out that anyone can be scammed.

At the moment, I am the victim of threats of legal action from a company
that has defrauded hundreds of businesses and entrepreneurs like myself.
It all started about 13 weeks ago when I decided to create Entrepreneur
Weekly, a weekly Internet based newsletter designed to discuss the latest
and greatest Internet marketing techniques.  One of my goals in starting
this electronic newsletter was to bring together other entrepreneurs to
work together to create something that is as of yet does not exist on the
Internet.

Soon after my first newsletter went out, which explained my idea that
entrepreneurs should work together and create an Internet shopping mall
that is totally unique, I was contacted by Reed Caldwell, the president of
ServInt Corporation.  In great excitement, I discovered that he was on my
mailing list that the newsletter was sent out to and very soon we had an
agreement.  ServInt promised to provide our members with world wide web
sites at 'group rates' and to host the Internet shopping mall.

Very recently I found out that all these promises were in fact lies and
that ServInt had both defrauded our group and potentially ruined my
integrity for recommending them.  Based on this information, I planned a
switch for all our members to a different Internet access provider and
drove down to D.C.  to confront Reed Caldwell and the ServInt Corporation
with their lies.  Since then, I have been threatened by the ServInt
Corporation's attorneys and most of the group that was with the ServInt
Corporation have switched over to the other provider and are most grateful
for saving them before any major harm was done.

Some of the lies that ServInt Corporation told were:

1) They were an $8.2 million company that did a lot of work in office
automation for law firms in D.C.  and Richmond.

Fact: Servint was founded in early 1995 and has never had any office
automation type of clients.  Furthermore, Reed Caldwell is the sole owner
and employee, besides an attorney on retainer of the ServInt Corporation. 
Not only are they not a $8.2 million company but they were founded on
monies given to Reed by his rich mother.  ServInt Corporation was making a
loss every month until they got the business that I referred to them.

2) Reed Caldwell stated that he had graduated college in 2 years.  And when
asked directly about his age he implied that he was in his late 30's.

Fact: Reed Caldwell is 20 years old, born May 24th 1975, and flunked out of
the University of Richmond last year.  When I confronted him with this lie
on my trip down to D.C.  he said, "I never said I GRADUATED from college in
2 years." , referring to the wording of his previous claim which was "I
finished college in 2 years."

3) ServInt Corporation promised a secure payment system and secure
transactions to our members.

Fact: ServInt Corporation never had the ability to implement this on their
existing hardware and operating system, since there was no way to do this
on a Linux machine.  After looking into buying a Sun, which would run the
necessary software to make this available, Reed decided that he would
rather spend the investment capital buying himself a BMW 325i Convertible,
and could not afford to do both.

The secure payment method, promised to our group, was therefore both not
possible and ServInt Corporation had no intention to make it possible.

When I confronted Reed in D.C.  he promised to write an apology letter to
my group explaining the truth about ServInt and he promised to be fair with
refunds that would be requested by people canceling their service.  Since
then, the ServInt Corporation has both denied everything I have told the
group about them, continued to lie about their history and number of
employees, and has refused to refund some of the money due to our members.
Also, they are refusing to allow people who canceled their service to
retrieve the files that were stored on ServInt's server.

The way I found out this information about ServInt was a combination of
investigative calling and inside information provided to me by someone who
was very closely involved with ServInt and disagreed with their policies.

Please email me with further questions and feel free to check out our
website with a picture of Reed Caldwell and a little more detail on this
mess.

[Many months ago, pcmcom.device, a driver to allow the use of popular
PCMCIA modems with PCMCIA-equipped Amigas, was announced.  Shortly
thereafter, I was contacted by two people who were having difficulties
obtaining the program from its author.  Money was involved and the people
were rather upset.  Finally, I was successful in raising the author, Erik
Quackenbush of Scala.  The edited text of his e-mail to me follows.
Hopefully, this will help clear the air. -Jason]

Jason,

Thank you for your message.  I appreciate you taking the time to get
involved.  PCMCOM is a hobby of mine-I did it for fun, and I barely need
two digits to count the number sales I've had.

I am aware of two customers who are anxiously awaiting a new version of
PCMCOM- Mike Miller and Alan Redhouse (of Eyetech/U.K.).  The new version
is not ready yet- it is long overdue, and I am guilty of spending too much
time at my real job and not trying harder to solve their problems.  If
there are other people waiting for this update they have either not
contacted me or I incorrectly assumed that they were satisfied with my
response.

I also have three customers who have unfilled PCMCOM orders: Ring Video
Systems(Illinois), CD Video (Canada), and Corrie Dixon (Brisbane).  Only
Mr.  Dixon's order is prepaid, and I am emailing the old version to him
today.

There are also a couple of people who have requested free review copies,
including Denny Atkin.  I plan to get them the new version once it is
ready.

If you're aware of anyone else who is waiting for an update or a delivery,
please let them know that they aren't on my list.  Please feel free to give
them this email address.  They can also fax me at (610)277-9006.

People who have been waiting can:

1.  Request a full refund.  I will issue it promptly.   Nobody has done
this yet.

2.  Request an old version.  I will send it out, but it may not work with
their hardware, and I don't have a new version yet.

3.  Wait for the new version.  It is late, but I made no guarantee of a
delivery date or of compatibility with all existing hardware.


Yours,


-Erik

===========================================================================

[Duncan Fraser, late of Commodore Canada, now serves as vice-president and
general manager of TVI, a Canadian multimedia development company.  His
company submitted it for inclusion...-Jason]

Duncan's Trip to Germany!

We have recently contracted with "Think Video Interactive" which will do
R&D and marketing on behalf of TVI.  As the President and CEO of Think
Video, I was recently in Germany representing both companies in meetings
with ESCOM AG and Amiga Technologies.

TVI is an Amiga (as well as Windows) developer, and we use the Amiga in our
development work and production units, so this was an important meeting for
us.  Our discussions were fruitful and I can let you know that I am pleased
with the direction that the Amiga family will be taking.  Of particular
interest to us was, of course, that the Amiga continues to be available and
that there was a commitment to its development.  I left Germany convinced
that both issues are in the positive.

As we are an Internet and WWW Provider, I was especially pleased that our
meetings included Jozsef Bugovics, the technical director at ESD, a group
that have designed an electronic credit card which will provide secure
transactions through the Internet.  This hardware product for secure
transaction processing has a tremendous potential to change the use of the
WWW and create a whole new business structure.

Think Video is also developing an ATM layer for the CD32 game console that
will allow it to become a full-fledged set top box for any
transaction-based system.  The Amiga operating system, its dedicated chip
set, an ATM layer, and secure transactions should provide any content
provider with a low cost set top box with which to deliver his message. 
Whether that provider needs full-blown ATM or not, the use of Amiga
technology will allow Think Video to provide cost effective systems for set
top applications to online banking systems.

A CUP O' JAVA...

Our programming group has initiated relationships with other developers
throughout the world who are interested in accelerating the development of
Java for the Amiga.  More information will be announced about this project
as it develops...

               REVIEW: SMOKE 'EM POKER 1.4.1 BY DAVE O'BRIEN
                             By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON} 
===========================================================================

Oh, sure, it's always nice to get that big bubble-wrapped package from
England with a game inside to review.  But it's been a while since one of
those graced my mailbox, so I decided it was high time to hit Aminet and
see if I could come up with anything genuinely fun that was worth mention
in AR.

It took me about five minutes.

I've been interested in cards for years, and was even successful in getting
together a regular Friday-night poker game in the past few months. 
Blackjack and poker are my usual haunts, and I've got a few programs on the
Amiga that are worth clicking away at during long downloads or simply when
there's little else to do.  Usually, they lay idle for months until I
remember I have them, though.

I don't think I'll forget I have Smoke 'em Poker.  Dave O'Brien, a regular
poker freak himself, has come up with a very memorable, very PLAYABLE
5-card draw poker game, unique in that instead of being a "video poker"
(single player, merely trying to get a high enough hand to win a reward
proportional to the odds against getting that hand) game, it is a "real
deal" poker game, with up to 5 computer opponents of varying skill, where
the goal is not just to get the best hand, but to outplay the other guys. 
Or girls.

Smoke 'em's interface opens on an overscan NTSC High Res screen, to
accomodate the 6 squares that hold the cards.  (The player's cards are in
the lower middle space.) Betting is done with three options (default to a
raise of $10, $25, and $50, but alterable through preferences.), players
can fold at any time.  The computer players have skill levels of Bonehead,
Fair, and Good, and you can opt to know or not know how good they are. 
Interestingly enough, in my experience, Good players often lose more money,
simply because they don't take the sort of chances Bonehead players do.

The player can configure the opponents, giving them male or female voices.
Did I say voices?  Yes, voices.  O'Brien uses the very dusty SPEAK: device
to give the game some atmosphere.  The voice parameters he chose aren't the
greatest, but at least they're comprehensible.  You can also opt to see
everyone's cards, but that's cheating.

The game can, between hands, generate statistics on the game so far,
including each player's win/loss/fold ratios, their best hand shown, the
breakdown of hands shown and how many times they were the winners, and a
line graph of each player's cash over the past 100 hands.  (I've never had
the stamina to make it that far, though.)

If the strain is too much for you, you can opt to sit out some hands and
let the computer players fight it out.  The sounds and speech can also be
disabled at will, which you may want to do if you plan to think about a
hand for a while-the computer gets impatient and prods you to make your
move.  Nice touch.

Smoke 'em Poker was written in CanDo, which I suspect may have something to
do with the rather large size of the executable (over 500k).  There is also
apparently a small memory leak that I haven't seen yet.  The game requires
2 megs of memory and an 020 or better is recommended.

O'Brien declares this game as BeerWare (a variant of freeware in which the
user should drink a beer if they like the game), and welcomes suggestions
for future enhancements.  Hey, I'm sold.

How about 7-card stud, Dave?

===========================================================================
                  REVIEW: TURBOCALC 2.0 FROM SCHATZTRUHE
                             By: @{" Jason Compton " link JASON} 
===========================================================================


Business software, business software, business software.

Ask most Amiga users what the Amiga is lacking, and you'll probably hear
those three things.  Well, maybe they'll bemoan that we still don't have
Doom, but let's stick with the subject.

It's simply been the unfair fact that large business software companies
such as Lotus, WordPerfect, and Microsoft haven't been inclined to bother
supporting the Amiga.  WordPerfect took a stab at it back in version 4, but
that was the end of the road.  Microsoft's own Bill Gates just went on
record saying that his company didn't develop for OS/2 or the Amiga because
the market isn't large enough.

Some companies, such as Oxxi, have tried, but their market presence has
been lacking somewhat lately.

Enter TurboCalc 2.0.  Published by Stefan Ossowski's Schatztruhe, perhaps
more widely known as the publisher of the Aminet CDs, TurboCalc 2.0
delivers serious spreadsheet punch at a VERY realistic price.  Really, now,
US$40 is NOT a lot to ask.

The entire package is sharply laid out, from the detailed (and refreshingly
well translated) manual to the function key overlay.  And then of course
there's the software itself.  Loosely similar in layout to Excel, TurboCalc
can open a window on a public or custom screen, with the standard row of
buttons and large scrollable spreadsheet below.  A screendepth of 8 colors
offers lightning performance on my 030/25, but of course you may wish to
bump that up for visually intense presentations involving tons of graphs.
Sheet size is limited only by memory, which is rather frugally used (1 meg
of memory recommended, the base program takes roughly 300k to start.)

Besides the obvious options for simply adding up rows and columns for
bookkeeping purposes, TurboCalc offers over 100 formulas, easily accessible
from a menu list (in case you forget, or simply get tired of typing them
into cells.)  In addition, TurboCalc has a large library of ARexx commands
to help you integrate it into a larger suite of programs.  

The easiest way to explore the capabilities of TurboCalc is to tour the
included tutorial and demonstration projects.  Included are skeletons for
invoice generation (including a rudimentary but usable generator straight
out of the box, that allows for quantity, product description, and price,
kicking out a TurboCalc record file suitable for filing and/or printing),
demonstrations of chart abilities, an example of the database functions
(which are often worth the price of admission on any spreadsheet package),
and even a "Connect 4" clone written in the macro language.  I'm quite
impressed with the quality and comprehensiveness of the tutorial
inclusions, if for no other reason than it's often more easy to do by
example than to learn it from a manual.

Online help is satisfactory, but it's still essential to keep the manual
nearby for reference.  Since TurboCalc is in no way copy protected and
quite small (it fits on a single floppy), they don't want to give you the
world in online help.  Wise decision.

Printer output is, of course, included, with a decent set of preferences.
Output can also be directed to an IFF file.

Not all is perfect with TurboCalc-after all, you can't have everything for
$40.  What I miss the most is a linear solver akin to the one found in
Excel or in add-on packages such as What's Best! for old versions of Lotus
and Quattro Pro.  While they're not everyone's cup of tea, for management
decisions they are a very useful tool.  I wouldn't put it past a skilled
programmer to find a way to do it within the TurboCalc suite, but for me,
it's not an option.  Perhaps an add-on pack?

Even if it can't quite do everything Excel can, at least it supports the
import and export of files from Excel, Lotus, and ProCalc.  (Actually, it
can only import from ProCalc, not export to.)  This is a Good Thing,
capital letters intentional.  While I don't consider it necessary to have
the Lotuses and Microsofts of the world develop for the Amiga,
cross-platform interchangeability is a must.  Too many times, the phrase
"But I have to use Package X at work" has meant a lost sale for an Amiga
productivity package.  You still may need Excel at work to maximize profit
by making the optimized inventory purchase decisions, but at least you can
set up the sheet at home.

A few minutes at the helm of TurboCalc should convince you.  I might not
have been quite so enthusiastic at the original price of US$115, but for
$40...you really can't beat it.  Do yourself a favor, grab the Aminet demo
and give this program a look.

PRODUCT NAME

SwitchHitter PC keyboard to Amiga adapter


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

A keyboard adapter that allows you to use IBM AT compatible keyboards on
your Amiga 2000/2500/3000/4000 and CD32.  (More than likely, an easy
solution will be available for A500/1000s.)


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

E-mail: Dana_Peters@Mitel.COM
World Wide Web: http://www.worldlink.ca/~dana

LIST PRICE

$45 (US), ground shipping included.

SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

HARDWARE

Needs a "keyboard port." I believe the A600 and A1200 machines would
require some rather extensive hacking to be able to accept this adapter.

SOFTWARE

None.  This product simply replaces the standard Amiga keyboard hardware.

COPY PROTECTION

None.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

A2000, A2500, A3000, A4000 and CD32.


INSTALLATION

Just power down the Amiga, unplug the old keyboard, plug the SwitchHitter
in and the PC keyboard into the SwitchHitter and power back up.

There are some DIP switches for customizing the setup, but the default is
fine for a start - more on this later..

REVIEW

I'm _forced_ to use a PC Clone at work.  The latest thing to appear on my
system there is a Microsoft Natural(c) keyboard.  This is one of those
'Ergonomic' keyboards with the left-hand side of the keyboard slightly
offset (approximate 10 degree angle) from the right-hand side, and the
numeric keypad is more 'sculpted' to fit the fingers in the 'ten-key form'
of entry.

Actually, I've gotten to like this keyboard.  I've only been a marginal
'touch-typist' and this keyboard has helped enforce proper practice.
Besides - it looks cool!  :-) So, it was time to start looking for keyboard
adapters so I could use one on my A4000.

During my search, Dana Peters and I got into an EMail exchange about a new
gadget he was developing, the SwitchHitter.  I was looking for support of
the additional 'Windows' keys(at the bottom of the 'alpha' keys at
approximately the same position as the 'Amiga' keys on a standard C=
keyboard).  Dana was very supportive and essentially did a custom design
for the 'Natural'.

When I received the prototype, I was pleased to see that not only was the
'Natural' support well done, but Dana had also added other features:

o StickyKeys - a convenience to those who prefer to type with one hand,
and/or enables users with limited manual dexterity to use the Amiga.
Enabling 'Sticky Mode' is just a matter of pressing and holding the
ScrollLock key.  After two seconds, the 'Scroll Lock' LED flashes on to
indicate sticky mode is on.  Now, whenever a modifier key is pressed and
released (Ctrl, Shift, Amiga or Alt) it will be automatically 'stuck' down,
the 'Scroll Lock' LED lights to indicate the modifier is stuck.  The stuck
modifiers are automatically released after any non-modifier (or the Scroll
Lock) key is typed.  If a non-modifier key is typed while a modifier is
being held, the modifier does not remain stuck when it's released
permitting normal two-handed typing while in sticky mode.  Exiting Sticky
mode is like entering - press the ScrollLock for two seconds and you'll get
a flash from the 'Scroll Lock' LED.

o Keyboard Mouse - yes, the Amiga _does_ have that feature built- in - this
is just a nicer way of taking advantage of that...  When 'NumLock' is on
(indicated by it's LED), the numeric keypad 8,2,4 and 6 keys are up, down,
left and right respectively, the 0 and .  keys are the left and right mouse
buttons.  In conjunction with Sticky Keys, the 'mouse buttons' in this mode
can be locked on for even easier manipulation.

o For those Not using the 'Natural' keyboard - there are four DIP switches
for several optional keyboard mappings.  One setting provides a proper
'spatial' orientation for those that prefer not having to re-learn a
keyboard layout. 

o Almost all of the keys are mapped to do something useful:

           101-Key         Amiga               And in addition and
           AT Keyboard     Equivalent            Most Notably :-)

           PrtScr/SysRq  |  Help                Natural KB   Equivalent

           End           |  Shift right arrow
           Page Up       |  Shift down arrow


DOCUMENTATION

One 8 1/2x11 two-sided page.

This is all that was required for a product of this type.  The DIPs were
explained in a logical, easy to understand fashion.


LIKES

I like the complete support of the Micro*oft Natural keyboard and the
'StickyKeys' feature is quite cool


DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

My only suggestion would be some way to 'program' the F11 and F12 keys.  I
had no other use for them as the MS Nat.  has a place for the 'Amiga' keys.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

The only other device like this that I've had my hands on is the PC
keyboard socket in the SX1 (CD32 expansion).  There are some 'keyboard
buffering' problems with that one.  I went back to the keyboard socket on
the CD32 when the SwitchHitter freed up my A4000 keyboard.  :-)


BUGS

None that I could find.


VENDOR SUPPORT

I've been quite pleased with the support so far.  No need as yet to test
his repair support. 

My only association is as a beta tester for the prototype - I now own a
production unit.  I have no vested interest in his company and Naturally
:-) wish him the best.


WARRANTY

No warranty is mentioned in the simple documentation.  Very little could go
wrong with a discrete component like this, anyway.


CONCLUSIONS

I'd give this six out of six stars.  A very cool gadget.

I'm very happy I found this product - it's made my clone friends envious
that it can make a Natural KB even better than when it's plugged into a
'native' system.

TITLE
    CompilAIBB

VERSION
    1.1

AUTHOR
    Yann-Erick Proy

    e-mail : Yann-Erick.Proy@Imag.fr or Proy@Merlin-Gerin.fr

DESCRIPTION
CompilAIBB is a collection of small files, called modules, created
with the AIBB software from Peter Lamonte Koop.

AIBB (Amiga Intuition Based Benchmarks) enables you to :

  1- Check the hardware and software setup of your Amiga :

    + processor kind : 68000, 68020, 68030, ...
    + its frequency : 14 MHz, 33 MHz, ...
    + possible presence of mathematics coprocessor
    + specialized chipset identification : Agnus, Alice, ...
    + possible presence of expansion boards
    + Kickstart version, i.e. system version : 37.175, 40.63, ...
    + system main libraries versions : exec.library,
      graphics.library, ...
    + Kickstart locations : ROM or RAM
    + ...

  2- Evaluate the computing performances of your Amiga and
     compare it to others :

    + AIBB includes 20 different tests (integer, graphics,
      floating point, memory access, ...)
    + AIBB achieves comparisons by storing and retrieving the
      results of these tests in a very small file : a module.

This is the 1.1 version of CompilAIBB, constituted of modules
(86) made with 6.0 or newer versions of AIBB. It features lots
of 68030 accelerator boards for the A1200 and the A2000, 68040
accelerators boards for the A2000 and the A4000 and a 68060
prototype board for the A4000. Some boards are represented twice
or more with little differences as the Kickstart version,
Kickstart relocation, caches status, etc. Quick module
identification is now provided by the mean of the AmigaDOS file
comment (sender name and setup summary).

A big AmigaGuide documentation is provided with an inventory of
these modules and instructions to provide the author with new
ones. It is available in english (well, sort of...) and french.
Most (if not all) of the bugs of the 1.0 guide files have been
removed and a product index has been added.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
The AIBB modules require the 6.0 or newer version of AIBB.

The AmigaGuide documentation  require either the Amigaguide
software included in the 3.0 (V39) or 3.1 (V40) Amiga system
or the standalone Amigaguide V34 package.

Maximum efficiency can be obtained from the documentation if your
humour board is plugged in...

AVAILABILITY

CompilAIBB is available on Aminet in 'util/moni' (as AIBB) :

ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/util/moni/CompilAIBB1.1.lha

PRICE
CompilAIBB is free. If you use it, the author would appreciate
from you that you send him a nice postcard from where you live
(only one did, currently... :-( thanks New Zealand !).

DISTRIBUTABILITY
CompilAIBB may be freely distributed on condition that :

  1- the original form under which its author has published it is
     respected ;

  2- the price asked for its diffusion is not more than usually
     asked for Fish floppies ($3, 15 FF, etc) or CDs ($30, 200
     FF, etc) ;

  3- diffusion may stop immediately if asked so by the author.

CompilAIBB is Copyright 1994, 1995 Yann-Erick Proy.

OTHER
If you have restricted access to Internet (no FTP) you may require
that CompilAIBB is sent to you by e-mail at every release.
To suscribe to this service, send the author an EMPTY message of
which the subject is "CompilAIBB by e-mail". There is no warranty
you will ever receive CompilAIBB this way : the author may be
prevented to do so by many reasons.
If you suscribed to this service when previous versions were
released you should be contacted for a new delivery AFTER the
Aminet new release and the corresponding annoucement. Please be
patient.

TITLE

    R3


AUTHOR

    Bruce Webster

    E-Mail: b.webster@student.canterbury.ac.nz


DESCRIPTION

1 or 2 player arcade game.
It's a bit like Thrust, only much better.

For the uninitiated:

  You fly around in a one-engine ship, killing things that shoot
  at you and finding your way past various obstacles to collect
  some cargo.  You then take that back to your base to complete a
  mission.

  Or you could play dogfight, and just blast the other player to
  pieces.


This game has:

* 1 or 2 player missions and dogfight levels

* 15 different ships to buy - all with their own ammo, range,
    shield, mass, cargo capacity, fuel efficiency, response,
    engine power, etc.     (the demo version only has 12 ships)

* lots of nasty things- chain guns, dish-guns, missile launchers,
                        radio-guns, etc, etc.  Less stuff than the
                        REGISTERED version, though.

* shields  You can rebound off the walls, take hits, etc.

* damage After losing all your shield, blinky lights and "Warning" voice
  may tell you that you have stabiliser damage, fuel blockage, power
  failure, turbine overheat, launch failure and/or a burst fuel valve.  It
  is difficult to fly your ship by that stage, but it's quite amusing to
  watch.

* lots of firepower - some ships can fire 60 bullets per second.

* homing missiles   - you have them, but so does the enemy!

* deflectors, water, gravitational attractors, fans, teleporters, lifts...

* various doors, buttons and switches.

* neat sound effects

* nifty side-by-side two-player mode.  (instead of skinny rectangles above
  one another)

* 60 frames per second screen update

* decent graphics (for non-AGA at least)

Tested on:  A500, A1000, A1200, A2000, A4000...


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

It works on any 1meg amiga - although bullets can slow down on
68000 machines (everthing else stays at 60fps).


AVAILABILITY

R3 is available on Aminet as the archive "R3_demo.lha" in the
game/demo directory.  For example:

ftp://ftp.netnet.net/pub/aminet/game/demo/R3_demo.lha    (397452)


PRICE

Shareware Registration costs 10 pounds sterling or US$15 or NZ$20.
That includes P&P.  The equivalent in other major currencies
should also be OK.

Registration gets you a (very nice) level editor, lots of levels
(over 90), more baddies/traps/features in the game and another
great (previously unreleased) game called "Tritus".  Yes, you get
TWO games.


DISTRIBUTABILITY

The demo version archive is freely distributable.

TITLE

     GUICreator - interface builder for OS3.x

VERSION

     1.2

AUTHOR

     Markus Hillenbrand (m_hillen@informatik.uni-kl.de)

DESCRIPTION

This program is a useful tool for all programmers who want to 
create a GUI for their applications.  You can simply design a
GUI (like GadtoolsBox) using mouse and keyboard and create the 
source for it.

This far, source code for these compilers can be made:
o Maxon C/C++
o SAS/C
o GNU C
o DICE

One of these generators should work together with your C compiler,
too.

Support for these compilers is in work:
o Amiga Oberon
o Modula-2
o Amiga-E

These features are implemented:
o font sensitivity (uses the default fixed font)
o no global variables created in source
o easy and readable code
o generation of a main program (just compile and run to test)
o automatic resizing of windows 
o no external library needed (except gadtools.library of course)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

o Amiga OS 3.x
o One of the above mentioned compilers

AVAILABILITY

GUICreator is available from Aminet, e.g.:

ftp://ftp.uni-kl.de/pub/aminet/dev/gui/GUICreator12.lha (543K)

PRICE

     Shareware: 30,- DM or 30 US$.

DESCRIPTION

JACOsub is designed for displaying timed sequences of titles and
graphics over a video.  Professional-quality output and flexibility
have been the primary goals since the program's inception.  It was
originally written for the Japanese Animation Club of Orlando (JACO)
to lay English subtitles over Japanese-language films and TV shows.
The program grown in popularity due to its flexible script format,
clean multi-buffered title transitions, and other features:

 *  Non-sequential events.  Title time ranges may overlap.

 *  Fully integrated text-based script editor with optional user interface
    for title appearance attributes, and mouse-positioning of titles.

 *  Handles all kinds of time units: SMPTE, 1/100 second units, etc.

 *  Timing script file format allows comments, blank lines, text directives,
    global configuration commands, and inclusions of other scripts.

 *  Complete script-based control over text position, margins, font, style,
    colors, palettes, backshadow, word-wrapping, justification, genlock
    fades, etc.

 *  Real-time script timing procedure allows timng of scripts in small
    sections, and in independent tracks.  The program offers intelligent
    calculation of title end times and forced gaps, leaving you free to
    concentrate only on title start times during timing.

 *  IFF pictures/brushes may be displayed independently or with titles.

 *  Multi video buffering and page switching.  Images appear instantly
    during the vertical CRT blanking interval.

 *  "On the fly" time shift and drift adjustments while script is playing.

 *  Support for ARexx, AGA, and several 3rd-party script formats.

2.11


AUTHOR

EMAIL : benjamin@ritz.mordor.com


DESCRIPTION

The new Fitter V2.11 is a program that automates the copying
of files from your hard drive to floppy disks, although any
device(s) can be used as a source and destination.  Free up
your well needed hard drive space and let Fitter automatically
keep track of where your files are for easy retreival.  Fitter
is ideal if you collect GIFs, MODs, demos, programs,
etc. while on the 'net or your on-line service.


NEW FEATURES

Note that Fitter V2.11 contains no enhancements (over V2.1).
It is a maintenance release to V2.1, containing very
significant bug fixes.  See the HISTORY section of the
documentation for these.

Expect to see the following enhancements in V2.1 over V2.0:

o Disk usage options:  The Fitter Add Files routine has been
enhanced so that you can select: 1. to use only new disks
(formatting each one), 2. to use only disks already in your
catalog for copying new files to, or 3. a combination of 1 and
2.

o Dynamic disk labeling: You can now keep your disks write
protected while adding them to your Fitter catalog!  In this
version, Fitter keeps track of each individual volume label,
and has a disk relabeling feature, for when you want to rename
your disks.

o Write enable flag:  You can now flag each disk in your
catalog as writeable (or not writable), so that the Add Files
procedure knows whether or not it can use a disk or not for
copying new files to.

o New catalog dumping (exporting) option!  Create an ASCII
dump of your Fitter catalog, sorting by file name, file size,
or by disk contents.

o Menus (and menu hotkeys) now available from the main window.

o And more, including bug fixes!


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

Any Amiga with WB2.x or greater.  Hard drive or other mass
storage device reccomended.

DESCRIPTION

AmiWin is an X11R6 (X-Window-System) package for AmigaDOS,
somewhat similar to "DaggeX" by Kari Mattinen, or the
X11R4 package by GfxBase.

X11 is a GUI interface standard that is particular common
on Un*x systems. Many popular Un*x programs (such as xv,
Mosaic, NetScape etc.) use the X11 standard. AmiWin can be
used to redirect the GUI of these programs to your Amiga.
It is also possible to run some X11 programs directly on
your Amiga.

AmiWin includes an X11 server with several display drivers
and a few X11 clients including the window manager "twm".

AmiWin supports the following graphics boards and chipsets:

 - OCS/ECS/AGA: monochrome

 - OCS/ECS/AGA: 4-256 colors

 - A2024: 4 greyscales (reg. version only)

 - Picasso-linear with VillageTronic software: 256 colors

 - CyberGraphX boards: 256 colors

 - Picasso-linear with VillageTronic software: 32768/65536
   colors true-color (reg. version only)

 - CyberGraphX boards: 32768/65536 colors true-color
   (reg. version only)

AmiTCP/IP 2.x/3.x/4.x and AS-225 R2 are supported, too.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

- At least 4 MB of hard disk space.

- Kick 2.04 / WB 2.04 or higher

- At least 4 MB of RAM

- A graphics output device that is supported by AmiWin (see

TITLE

CyberShow

VERSION

4.2

AUTHOR

Helmut Hoffmann
Rubensstrasse 4
41063 Moenchengladbach
Germany

EMail: hhoff@pool.informatik.rwth-aachen.de

DESCRIPTION

A slideshow presentation program (including effects)
and universal picture viewer (incl. PhotoCD) and converter
for all Amigas and esp. for Cybergraphic users.

This program can display pictures in many file formats (see
below) directly in windows on the Workbench (default public
screen), in windows on public screens or on it's own screen.
It also offers (borderless) viewing as slideshow. Optional
transition effects can be used to make viewing multiple files
more interesting. If you have a suitable
graphic board with Cybergraphic WB emulation
installed you can even watch the pictures in full color
quality (HiColor/TrueColor) on your Workbench. Without
Cybergraphics the normal color restrictions (2 to 256
colors) will lead to a reduced quality, but smart pen
allocation during displaying will still give surprisingly
high quality with 256 colors.

You can switch forward and backward between images and
scroll images in their resizable windows. An automatic
preloading feature will reduce waiting time to a minimum.
While you watch one picture (and maybe scroll it around),
the next picture will already be loaded, so that it will
be there if you decide to switch... You can select down-
scaled loading for viewing in reduced size. Unlike many
viewers, this viewer reduces most pictures during
loading and will thus be faster for reduced size loading.

Additional features include conversion to some 24Bit formats
(incl. JPeg, IFF-ILBM24, Targa) and fast direct transfer
to famous image processing and painting programs (ImageFX,
XiPaint, ArtEffect/PicoPainter).

Internally supported formats for loading:

1) IFF-ILBM (1 to 24Bit incl. HAM6/HAM8)
2) PhotoCD (Base format 768x512 or 512x768 (portrait))
3) JPeg (color and greyscale)
4) PPM/PGM/PBM (P1&P4 b&w, P5 grey, P6 color)
5) QRT (also known as dump format by PD raytracers as POV-Ray)
6) Targa
7) PCX
8) BMP (uncompressed)
9) TIF (packbit-compr./uncompr.)
10) EGS7.x window icons
11) DEEP
12) YUV
13) VLAB raw
14) RGB
15) HHsYUVSq sequence format
16) IFF-PBM (DPII)
17) ACBM
18) FBM
19) Sun raster (uncompressed)
20) MacPaint (b&w compressed 1Bit format; datafork only)
21) HHsXRL formats

The additional DataType support extends this list by many
formats; DataTypes can e.g. be found on Aminet in util/DType.
The DataType support is very fast, so that you can also view
pictures in GIF or other formats quite fast for which Datatypes exist.

NEW FEATURES

New since V4.x: + SlideShow or window presentation including
                  currently 11 spectacular transition effects
                  (some of the effects are only available for
                   TrueColor/HighColor viewing with CyberGraphX)
New since V3.4: + Parameter support for both CLI and Workbench
                  (tooltypes) to make CyberShow usable and
                  configurable in many environments

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

OS3.0 (unlike previous versions OS3.1 is not needed anymore)
4MBytes FastRAM recommended

Optional for TrueColor/HighColor viewing:
  cybergraphics.library V40 or higher and a suitable graphic board.
  The Cybergraphics emulation is compatible with many graphic boards
  (e.g. CyberVision, Piccolo, SD64, Spectrum, Picasso2, Retina-Z3,
        Domino)

===========================================================================

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report in
@{"UUENCODED" link UUENCODE} form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put on
the list, send Email to listserv@itesmvf1.rzs.itesm.mx.

Your subject header will be ignored.  In the body of the message, enter

subscribe areport <your real name>

ie: 

subscribe areport A. R. Reader

The system will automatically pull your e-mail address from the message
header.

Your account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact
copy.  For example, many systems have a 100K limit on incoming messages.


** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over   **
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a  **
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your  **
** address in it, it will be removed from the list.  Thanks!             **

          *** The following is only for Australian readers!  ***

To circumvent the new pay-per-megabyte system for Australian Internet
communication, Paul Reece has been kind enough to set up an AUSTRALIAN-ONLY
mailing list, to save his fellow countrymen some money.

You can join the list by sending mail to:   majordomo@info.tas.gov.au

with the single line (in body of message):

subscribe ar

Amiga Report will then be bounced to you.

==                        UUDecoding Amiga Report                        ==
===========================================================================

If you receive Amiga Report from the direct mailing list, it will arrive in
UUEncoded format.  This format allows programs and archive files to be sent
through mail by converting the binary into combinations of ASCII
characters.  In the message, it will basically look like a lot of trash
surrounded by begin <filename> and end, followed by the size of the file.


To UUDecode Amiga Report, you first need to get a UUDecoding program, such
as UUxT by Asher Feldman.  This program is available on Aminet in

     pub/aminet/arc/

Then you must download the message that it is contained in.  Don't worry
about message headers, the UUDecoding program will ignore them.

There is a GUI interface for UUxT, which should be explained in the docs.
However, the quickest method for UUDecoding the magazine is to type

     uuxt x ar.uu

at the command prompt.  You will then have to decompress the archive with
lha, and you will then have Amiga Report in all of its AmigaGuide glory.

If you have any questions, you can write to @{"Jason Compton" link JASON}

==                    Amiga Report Writing Guidelines                    ==
===========================================================================

The three most important requirements for submissions to Amiga Report are:

     1.  Please use English.

     2.  Please use paragraphs.  It's hard on the eyes to have solid
     screens of text.  If you don't know where to make a paragraph break,
     guess.

     3.  Please put a blank line in between paragraphs.  It makes
     formatting the magazine much much easier.

Note:  If you want to check ahead of time to make sure we'll print your
article, please write to the @{"Editor" link JASON}.  Please stipulate as
well if you wish to retain copyright or hand it over to the editor.

                The Portal Information Network's Amiga Zone

          The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
          -------------------------------------------------------

Portal is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, a full-service online SIG
(Special Interest Group) for Amiga owners and users. We promise, and
WE DELIVER ongoing & aggressive Amiga support!

You can dial into Portal to access the Amiga Zone in many ways: direct
dial to our San Jose, CA high-speed modems (you pay for the phone call
if it's not local), or though any SprintNet or Compu$erve indial anywhere
(with a small hourly fee) or via the World-wide Internet "telnet"
program to portal.com (no hourly fee).

Even Delphi and BIX users can Telnet into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month,
with *unlimited* use.

Portal is NOT just another shell service!  Its Online system is fully
menu-driven with on-screen commands and help, and you can easily customize
it for your favorite terminal program and screen size.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 * 2.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific file space - we have so much Amiga Stuff
      online, we've lost count!
 * The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable software,
       online.  ALL 1000 disks!
 * Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
      once, of any size, with one command.
 * Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, Elastic
      Reality (ASDG), Soft-Logik, Apex Publishing, and others.
 * 40 "regular" Amiga libraries with over 10,000 files.  Hot new stuff
       arrives daily.
 * No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
      often as you want, and never feel pressured doing it.
 * Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you will
      recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.  We
      have given away thousands of bucks worth of Amiga prizes - more than
      any other online service.
 * Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything* Amiga
      related and get quick replies from the experts.
 * Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, AMosaic, LightWave, EGS,
      OpalVision & others feed right into the Zone message bases.  Read
      months worth of postings.  No need to clutter your mailbox with them.
 * FREE unlimited Internet Email with 5 meg of free storage.
 * A FREE UNIX Shell account with another 5 meg of free storage.
      You can run Amiga Mosaic through your shell and explore the
      vast World Wide Web!
 * Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which you can read
      and post articles about virtually any subject you can possibly
      imagine.
 * Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
      UNIX, Science Fiction, Disney, and dozens more.  ALL Portal SIGs are
      accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever. You
      never worry "Ooops... Am I paying for this area?" again!
 * Portal was THE FIRST online service to offer a full package of Internet
      features: IRC, FTP, TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  And you get FREE unlimited
      usage of all of them.
 * Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end" for
      Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your waiting
      email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail and
      messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are sent
      automatically the next time you log into Portal.  (PortalX requires
      Workbench 2.04 or higher)
 * Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether you log in
      at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low price.
