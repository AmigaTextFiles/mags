    ----------------------


Please be sure to read the new Internet Mailing List announcement by
Robert Niles.  The list has been moved from GNU to Portal, and is now
being managed by Mr. Niles.  I really appreciate his willingness to take
over this task, since the 'founder' of the list, Mr. Bob Caron, has been
unable to handle it any longer, due to an extreme workload.

I also want to give a big vote of thanks to all of our Amiga Report
Distribution Sites.  These privately-run BBS's have volunteered their
system and hard drive space to keep the latest issues of Amiga Report
available to their users.  The list of these systems keeps growing, and
maybe one day, we'll have enough of them so that the internet mailing list
will no longer be needed.

Yesterday was Turkey Day... I hope everybody had a pleasant one!  Just
think... less than a month until Christmas!  Egad.  I need to figure out
just WHAT I'm going to get people this year.  Oh well... I have plenty
of time to worry about that.  (yeah right)

/// CPU Status Report                     Late Breaking Industry-Wide News
    -----------------



                  ** Time Warner Plans Online News **

   An interactive news-on-demand service enabling users to choose and
control the content, length and order of their news programming is in the
works by Time Warner Inc.  Time Warner said this week the service will be
first offered late next year to customers at Time Warner's Orlando, Fla.,
interactive services experiment, the Full Service Network.

   Reports say the new service is to use the resources of the company's
Time Inc. publishing unit and New York 1 News, its 24-hour New York City
cable news service. It will be run by Walter Isaacson, currently Time
Magazine's assistant managing editor, who will become editor of new media
for Time Inc. and president of News-On-Demand; and Paul Sagan, who will
become senior vice president of Time Warner Cable Programming Inc.

   The new service will include local, world and national news, business
and finance, sports, reviews, health news and weather.


          ** Intel Hopes to Set Video Conferencing Standard **

   An Intel Corp. executive said this week that the firm hopes its new
Indeo technology will set the standard for PC-based video conferencing.

   Richard Pierce, marketing manager for Indeo, told attendees at the
Piper Jaffray conference in New York that the purpose of Indeo is to
develop an open systems architecture in the newly emerging PC-based video
conferencing market.

   "We care about desktop video publishing because it is something that
will truly drive growth in PCs," Pierce said. "Our strategy is to drive
the standards," in what is a nascent industry of PC-based video
conferencing.


     ** Matsushita Sends 30,000 Game Machines to U.S. Each Month **

   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. says it has been exporting its $700
Real Multimedia Game Machine, using 3DO Co.'s technology, at a monthly
rate of some 30,000 units since its debut last month.

   Reports say the firm plans to put the machine on the Japanese and
European markets next spring.

   The machine is equipped with a 32-bit RISC (reduced instruction
command set) chip. Besides games, it also can run multimedia software
such as educational software and photo compact discs on a television
screen.


         ** Logitech to Market 'Eraser Head' Pointing Device **

   Logitech Inc. says it has signed a letter of intent with Interlink
Electronics of Camarillo, Calif., to distribute new pointing sticks based
on Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) technology.  The agreement will allow
Logitech to exclusively market compact pointing devices with roughly the
same diameter as a pencil eraser, residing on or near a computer
keyboard.

   Similar to the device found on the IBM ThinkPad keyboard, Logitech
notes that pointing sticks based on FSR provide an extremely convenient,
highly accessible and cost effective means of pointing.

   Logitech says it intends to market FSR pointing sticks to keyboard
manufacturers and notebook and desktop system manufacturers.


                 ** IBM Being Sued by Woman Engineer **

   IBM has been sued by one of its engineers who says her bosses forced
her to have sex with a Pentagon official so IBM could get millions of
dollars in government funding.

   Veronica Gunther, 35 years old, alleges superiors threatened to fire
her in 1991 and 1992 unless she maintained a sexual relationship with
Gary Denman, director of the Pentagon's ARPA (Advanced Research Projects
Agency).

   Reports say the named defendants in the state court suit, which seeks
unspecified damages, were IBM and two of Gunther's managers, Ray Blonn
and Nancy Green.

   IBM spokesman Scott Brooks said the company doesn't comment on pending
litigation and ARPA spokeswoman Jan Walker also declined to comment.



              ** Windows Shipments Pass 40 Million Mark **

   Microsoft Corp. reports that shipments of its Windows operating system
has passed the 40 million unit mark.

   The Redmond, Wash.-based software publisher claims that Windows has
been responsible for the founding of more than 500 new companies and for
the direct creation of more than 17,300 jobs outside of Microsoft. It
notes that Microsoft Windows has been responsible for the creation of at
least $280 million in annual revenues for new small companies and for
more than $1.3 billion in incremental revenue for existing small
companies.

   Microsoft reports that more than 16,000 software companies throughout
the U.S. now develop Windows-based software. These companies expect their
revenues to increase by 35 percent next year, and they expect Windows
based products to account for at least half of their total revenues, says
Microsoft.


                      ** Dell Offers Pentium PC **


   Dell Computer Corp. says its new Pentium-based Dimension XPS P60
computer will start at $2,999, including a super VGA color monitor. The
company said it will start shipping it later this month, with
availability in Canada by Dec. 1.  Dell also says it now offers factory
installation of IBM's OS/2.1 operating system on its PCs.


               
          ** Apple's IBM-Compatible Unit Unveiled at Comdex **

   Apple Computer Inc. has used the world platform of the Comdex trade
show in Las Vegas to unveil its new IBM- compatible Macintosh computer.

   Reports say the Macintosh Quadra 6100, DOS Compatible version,
includes both a Motorola Corp. 68LC040 microprocessor to handle Mac
programs and an Intel Corp. 486SX chip to run Microsoft Corp.'s
IBM-compatible Windows and DOS software.

   Vice President Ian Diery of Apple's personal computer division said
the system will be marketed to home office users and small businesses,
adding, "We don't want compatibility to be an issue for our customers.
By developing its most compatible personal computer, Apple intends to
provide its users with all of the advantages of the Macintosh platform
while protecting their investment in DOS and Windows-based software."

   Apple said it will charge less than $500 over the price of its low end
Quadra 610 for the new machine, meaning it will probably retail for under
$2,000. It also said it will sell a DOS Compatibility Card to upgrade the
Quadra 610 and Centris 610 for less than $500.

   Officials with Apple did not say how soon it will begin selling the
new machine.


                   ** Megahertz Reaches Apple Deal **

   Megahertz Corp. has reached a long-term agreement with Apple Computer
Inc. to market a Megahertz-produced PCMCIA modem with XJACK for use with
the Newton MessagePad.

   The credit-card size modem slides into the Newton's PCMCIA slot and
consumes very little power. Megahertz says Apple will begin shipping the
Newton Fax Modem Card with XJACK later this month through its authorized
Newton distribution channels.


                    ** Power PC Newsletter Debuts **

   Macworld Communications Inc. has announced the launch of Power PC
World, a newsletter dedicated to Power PC computing.

   The San Francisco-based company says the monthly standalone newsletter
is dedicated to providing IS managers and volume buyers of Macintosh
products detailed, up-to-date information, advice and guidance on Power
PC technology and the transition to RISC-based computing. Power PC is a
new computer platform based on the Power PC microprocessor jointly
developed by Apple Computer, IBM and Motorola.

   "The Power PC microprocessor family offers the next big leap in
performance and will provide the basis for the popularization of exciting
new technologies and applications," said Adrian Mello, editor of Power PC
World, and editor-in- chief of Macworld magazine. "The transition to
Power PC is Apple's most important challenge since the introduction of
the Macintosh, 10 years ago."

   The premiere issue's topics include: "Power PC -- The Future of the
Macintosh," "Navigating the Power PC Upgrade Path" and "Power PC
Development Tools."


       ** Apple Computers Will Never Again be Priced Above Market **

   Apple Computer Inc. chief executive officer Michael Spindler said the
firm will never again price its products above the market, although it
will maintain its role as a technology innovator.

   Spindler said Apple will accelerate delivery of products across many
computing platforms, including Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating
software.

   But he said the key to Apple's strategy was to "aggressively" price
computers and software.

   "We will not as an industry leader price technology too high -- ever
again," said Spindler.

                    » Compton's claim over multimedia «


LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, U.S.A., 1993 NOV 17 (NB) -- Does anyone own
multimedia? Compton's New Media, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tribune
Publishing, claims it does and it has the patent to prove it.

According to the company, anyone selling information in a multimedia
format will need to pay license fees to Compton's no matter what the
device used to distribute multimedia. Company officials say interactive
television services like those announced by Time Warner and GTE,
graphical on-line services such as America Online and Prodigy, and
compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM) title developers will all be
obligated to pay or face legal action.

The US Patent Number is 5,241,671 titled: "Multimedia Search System
Using A Plurality Of Entry Path Means Which Indicate Inter-relatedness
Of Information." The patent was issued on August 31, 1993, and describes
the technology as: "A database search system that retrieves multimedia
information in a flexible, user friendly system. The search system uses
a multimedia database consisting of text, picture, audio, and animated
data. That database is searched through multiple graphical and textual
entry paths."

Compton's was purchased by Tribune around the time the patent was
issued. When asked why wait so long to make the patent announcement,
Norm Bastine, executive vice president and general manager of Compton's
said the company wanted to complete the sale first.

Tribune Publishing describes itself as an information and entertainment
company with six daily newspapers, seven television, and six radio
stations, as well as offering syndicated information and programming to
avariety of print, electronic, and broadcast media.

The announcement has angered a variety of multimedia developers, some
of whom claim they developed the same technology before Compton's
development of its multimedia encyclopedia, on which the patent is
based. Brower Murphy of The Library Corporation in Inwood, West
Virginia, claims he was using similar technology in 1984.

Bastine says Compton's should be compensated for its "pioneering work"
which it submitted for patent in the mid- 1980's and was granted patent
pending status in 1989.

Four ways were enumerated for the licensing: one percent of the net
profits, rising to three percent for those who do not comply by June 30,
1994; a strategic licensing agreement; distribution of multimedia
information which it will buy for resale at a 65 percent discount; or
purchase of a Compton's tool set for title development with accompanying
run-time fees for distribution.

    is the most common.  AmiFlick plays FLI and FLC animations on all Amigas.
    It fully supports AGA and can also write frames as IFF pictures.

NEW FEATURES
    A few bugs have been fixed, such as double buffering under 3.0.  The
    animation file can now be specified without the '.FLI' or '.FLC'
    extension.  Under 3.0, BestModeID() is used to pick the display mode.
    (Note that the hires HAM option is gone as it will now automatically
    be used).  The display mode can also be selected by name or by ID.

                      » HP48 GROB saver for ImageFX «


TITLE

    HP48 GROB Saver Module for ImageFX
    Version 1.03


AUTHOR

    Greg Simon


SYNOPSIS

    This program converts the ImageFX storage buffer to Hewlett Packard
    'GROBS.'  GROBs (Graphic Objects) are the memory storage format for
    the HP48 series calculators.  An image, once in this form, can be
    downloaded onto a HP48 calculator, and displayed at will on the LCD
    screen.  This allows one to create diagrams, graphics, or just view
    your favorite *.gif (1 plane only) on any HP48 calculator.

    This program works ONLY with ImageFX's storage buffer; an independant
    version is most likely to follow.

REQUIREMENTS

    - ImageFX, any version
    - Hewlett Packard HP48 Calculator( S, SX, G, GX )
    - Any Amiga which runs ImageFX can use this saver module.

    If you want to download the image to your calculator, you need
    a terminal program, and an HP48 cable.

TITLE

  uuIn and uuOut

VERSION

  v1.01

AUTHOR

  Nicolas Dade / nicolas-dade@uiuc.edu   (me)

DESCRIPTION

     Both uuIn and uuOut are very rapid uuencode/decoders.  They beat
anything currently available on aminet by a good margin, especially on
decoding.

     The usual set of features are supported, along with automatic file
splitting for the encoder and automatic non-data lines stripping for the
decoder (things like e-mail or net-news headers, personal comments, etc).

Both programs are pure so that they may be made resident.

     A uuencoding utility is used to prepare binary files for transmission
over text-only channels like e-mail and net-news.  Each triplet of bytes is
replaced by four ASCII characters, producing a file that looks like a lot
of uppercase and punctuation garbage.  A uudecoder can then decode this
ASCII into the original binary file.  Check out the *.binary.* newsgroups
for examples of uuencoded files.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  Workbench 2.04 or higher is all that is required.

HOST NAME

  Any aminet site. For example, ftp.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4).

TITLE

     Universal Message System (UMS), Public Release

VERSION

     Version 10.8

AUTHOR

     Private developers

DESCRIPTION

     The  Universal  Message  System  (short  "UMS")  is a system for
     managing   all  kinds  of  messages  ('e-mail'  and  'news')  as
     universally and efficiently as possible.

     It  uses  its own, network-independent format, thus allowing the
     user,  the  'newsreader'-  and  tool-programs  to read and treat
     messages from different networks in a unified way.

     Special  programs  called  'importers' and 'exporters' deal with
     the  specific  formats  of  all  these networks. In this release
     importers/exporters  are  supplied  for  UUCP,  FidoNet, Mausnet
     (German) and Z-Net (German) as well as for a proprietary format.

     UMS supports multiple users and manages individual access-rights
     for each user.

     UMS  provides  a  common interface ("ums.library") for access to
     the  message-base,  which  is  used by all programs dealing with
     UMS.

     Developer-material for using UMS in Amiga-Oberon, ARexx, C and
     Modula-II is included in this package.

  Also included:

      - all binaries and tools needed for the central data-base

      - two 'newsreaders' for reading and writing news and mail.
     One very nice and intuitive one (needs MUI), and one "not-so-
     intuitive" one that works on every Amiga- or VT100-console.

      - importers and exporters for UUCP, FidoNet, Mausnet and Z-Netz.

      - everything needed for using UUCP or Z-Netz with UMS.
     The   other   importers/exporters  still  need  some  additional
     transport-oriented  tools  (e.g.  "TrapDoor"  (c) by  Maximilian
     Hantsch  and  Martin  Laubach  or "VLT" (c) by W.G.J. Langeveld,
     SLAC).

      - many  tools  that are useful and/or instructive in how to use
     UMS and write other tools.

      - an  Installer  ((c) Commodore-Amiga, Inc.) script to  install
     UMS  with  any  of  the above networks in a simple setup (i.e. a
     "point"- or "leaf"-node).

NEW FEATURES

      - improved Installer script
      - several tools have been updated

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     AmigaDOS >=V2.0, >=3 MB RAM, >=2 MB hd

     MUI (Magic User Interface, (c) by Stefan Stuntz) recommended
     (but not needed)

     A modem (:-)

@PID: WWIVgate 1.11
From: sullivan@msri.org (John Sullivan)
Subject: Scam to Get Calling/Credit Card Numbers From Parents
Organization: TELECOM Digest

I just got this e-mail from my mother.  As you will see, someone is
trying to get people to give out their calling card numbers by
pretending to have collect calls from loved ones, and then saying
there is a block.

        -------  begin message -------

Last night just as I was leaving the house, the phone rang. A male
voice said said, "I have a collect call from John Sullivan. Will you
accept the charges?"

I was surprised, but of course said immediately, "Yes!"

He started to put the call through but then said, "I can't put the call
through because you have a block on your line."

"What?"

"You have a block on your line that collect calls can't be accepted."

"Well then what can I do, that's my son and I have to hear what he wants!"

"You can use some other form of payment."

"Like what?"

"A calling card or a credit card."

"Well, I guess my calling card, but let me ask my husband."

Dad and I agreed it sounded fishy but still what if it really were you trying
to get us. So, I decided to try to find out some more to see if it could be
legit. I asked, "Where is the call coming from?"

"I don't have that information."

"Can you give me your operator number?" (I forgot to say to you that he had
identified hiumself as an AT&T operator.)

"19076."

I told Dad on the side that if you really weren't on the other end we
could immediately call and cancel the calling card number.  So I gave
him an AT&T number and he said he'd put me through and then got back
and said, "I'm sorry the party has hung up. Thank you for using AT&T."

So, we then were pretty sure it was a scam. I immediately called AT&T
to cancel the number. The AT&T woman took down the whole story (I
guess so they can alert people) and said that the operator handling a
collect call would definitely know what area code the call was coming
from. She also said that, given that we would have been the ones to
originate a block on collect calls that should have been a tip-off. I
agreed but said when you hear that your child is calling collect
reason gets overruled.

The AT&T woman said their operators would _never_ ask you for your
card number.

So, I doubt he got in many calls to Borneo or wherever before the card
was no good anymore.

                      screen you can read:

                      "This  is  the:  Jeff-Viruskiller  V2.67  press  left
                      mouse-button to continue.

                   2. Then  you  get a blue/black text on a grey background
                      in the next screen and the following text:

                      "Jeff-Viruskiller V.2.67

                      Please  inset  a disk  in  drive  0.  Then press left
                      mouse-button to kill Jeff on it".

                   3. If  you  don't  have an unprotected in this drive you
                      will be asked to remove the write-protection!

                      But  if  the  disk  isn't write-protected the disk is
                      already  infected with the virus long time before you
                      have pressed the left mouse-button.




DigitalDream virus    This  is  the  bootvirus,  which  is installed by the
                      DigitalDream  trojan.  The  bootvirus is spreading at
                      kickstart 2.0 and it is a mutation virus.  That means
                      the  virus is changing it's code every time the virus
                      infects a new disk.

Our story is big because technologically sophisticated customers, who 
feel passionate about a product, are becoming owners of the provider 
company.  Newspapers are beginning to pick up on this story.  E-mail me 
if you can be available to give constructive quotes to reporters over 
the coming weeks (provide your voice phone number).  An example message 
might read:

EXAMPLE 1
"This is Mike Levin, a Commodore customer from Philadelphia.  I feel 
that the Commodore Shareholder Movement represents my interests as a 
customer of the company.  I consider myself part of the Commodore 
Shareholder Movement, and will be basing my future purchases of 
Commodore equipment on Commodore management's response to the CSM."

@node P1-8 "Usenet Review - Time Tracker v1.0"
@toc "menu"


/// Usenet Review:  Time Tracker version 1.0
    ----------------------------------------
    By Edward D. Berger
    (eb15+@andrew.cmu.edu)



PRODUCT NAME

        Time Tracker version 1.0


BRIEF DESCRIPTION

        Time Tracker is what the DOS/Windows world call a Personal
Information Manager, or "PIM" for short.  It is basically a combination
of appointment calendar (with alarms), address book, phone note editor,
"to do" list manager and calculator.


AUTHOR/COMPANY INFORMATION

        Name:           INVENTURE
        Address:        P.O Box 777
                        Morrison, CO  80465-0777
                        USA

        Telephone:      (303) 697-5270
        FAX:            (303) 697-5260

        E-mail:         Unknown

        The program was written by M. Joel Guerra.


LIST PRICE

        Unknown.  I purchased the package for $69.95 (US) at a local
Amiga dealer.


SPECIAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        HARDWARE

                512K RAM or more.
                Hard drive recommended, but not required.
                Battery backed clock recommended, but not required.


        SOFTWARE

                AmigaDOS 1.2 or higher required.
                AmigaDOS 2.x and 3.x compatible.
                req.library required (and is provided with the
package).


COPY PROTECTION

        None.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        Amiga 3000/16
        2MB Chip RAM
        12MB Fast RAM
        AmigaDOS 2.1


INSTALLATION

        Drag the program drawer from the floppy to a hard drive
partition. To get automatic startup, drag the special project icon to
your WBStartup drawer and manually edit the icon tooltype with the
correct AmigaDOS path to find the program.  Under AmigaDOS 1.x, you add
aline to your startup-sequence and add req.library to your LIBS:
directory.


GENERAL INTERFACE

        Time Tracker is a multiple window program that can open on the
Workbench or on a custom screen.  When run, it pops up its calendar
window, or you can set it to start iconified with or without a digital
style clock.  It uses the AmigaDOS 2.x 3D-style buttons for its calendar
days and other uses.

        Unfortunately the program has the Topaz font hard-coded into
its interface.  I'd prefer it to use either my default screen font or my
default system font (Times 11, Courier 13) for its text.  When Time
Tracker is opened on the Workbench screen, its title bar and menus are
in my default screen font (Times 11).  When opened on its own custom
screen, it uses my system default font (Courier 13) for its screen title
and window title bars and menu texts.  The gadgets' texts always remain
in topaz.font.  I would prefer this to be consistent, and preferably
user-configurable.  The program would look more professional if the Day
buttons matched my Workbench font or used a prettier font like
Helvetica.

        Time Tracker is unaware of public screens (AmigaDOS 2.0 and
up). Other programs cannot easily open on the Time Tracker screen, and
the Time Tracker windows cannot open on a named public screen.  These
are general faults of programs written for AmigaDOS 1.x.  Perhaps a
newer version of Time Tracker will be enhanced for later versions of
AmigaDOS.

        One slightly quirky thing about the interface is that some of
the windows are available by way of button gadgets at the bottom of the
calendar window, and some through menu items in the calendar's 'other'
menu.  I think they should be available by both methods.  The Icon
button at the bottom is also redundant since it performs the same thing
as the window's close gadget does.  While there is a button gadget for
help in the calendar window, the program does not respond to the
keyboard 'help' key.  Also the help gadget only puts a text help on top
of the calendar display.  I'd like it to pop up a separate window with
AmigaGuide help.

        The menu layout does not follow the Amiga User Interface Style
Guide.  The menus do have many shortcut keys, using an unusual
combination of both upper and lower-case shortcut keys.  Unfortunately,
the shortcut keys are not always consistent between the various windows
of the program, sometimes leading to confusion for this user.


CALENDAR AND APPOINTMENT REMINDER

        From the calendar window, you can click on a Day button to pop
up that day's schedule window and add an event.  Once you add an event
to the calendar, the button for that date gets a highlight added to the
right side of its button.  A small horizontal line appears relative to
the time of the appointment, with earlier events being towards the top
and later ones toward the bottom of this highlighted section.

        With the pre-marked Alarm times for non-repeating events you
can add events for times on the hour or half hour between 8:00am and
5:30pm.  You can enter any time you wish; but if your schedule is quite
different, you may wish that the preset times listed would either go
24-hours or be user configurable.

        Below the preset times is a subsection for writing notes about
the day.  A short note can be added to a given date's button on the
calendar window by typing an exclamation point before the alarm text. 
The alarm text will be spoken, if you have the appropriate speak-handler
software installed from AmigaDOS 1.3 or 2.04, or it will use the
standard AmigaDOS "display beep" function.  I would prefer to have the
addition of using multiple sampled sounds instead of one display-beep. 
Alarms can also launch AmigaDOS programs if you precede the command with
a "^" character.  The programs do not inherit Workbench's search path. 
They can only find C:  and "Current_Dir".  You could work around the
display beep limitation by using an outboard AmigaDOS program which can
play a sample.  You must specify the commands full path such as
"SYS:mybin/play8svx".

        ARexx is not supported by the alarm, nor the rest of the
program.

        Adding repeating events is handled one of two ways.  The first
way is for 'every month on this day' type of events which you add by way
of a requester, and a user-defined abbreviation of up to four
characters appears on the calendar day.  The second way uses an editor
window where you type 'first Sunday of every month' or similar verbose
descriptions.  This allows for such things as 'every Wednesday' or 'odd
Thursday'.  Unfortunately, you can't enter 'the Wednesday after the
third Sunday'.  I'd need this for one of my user group meetings.  I was
also unable to enter 'last weekday of every month:  Pay day!'.  I'd like
to see more flexibility here.

        It would be a welcome addition if you could choose images to
appear on the day button for a given event, such as a dollar symbol for
paying someone or a telephone for reminders to call someone.  This would
probably require a less cluttered view such as a 'view by week' instead
of the current monthly format.

        The 'Tickler' button gives you a preview of the next seven
days' events.  The Monthly summary gives a listing of all the month's
entered events.  Both of these are editor windows and you can delete all
the lines that you feel are unimportant.  I think the event editor
should have a line option so you can exclude events from the monthly
summary at the time you enter them.  I plan to use the monthly summary
for work related reports. You can print either of these out.  You can
only have one or the other open at a time as they use the same window. 
I'd like to have two separate windows instead.


TO DO LIST MANAGER

        The To Do List manager opens up with a blank text editor
window. You can select from one of three lists.  To enter an item, you
simply click and start typing.  To show that you have finished an item,
you press Shift and click on the left mouse button with the cursor on
the line you wish to check off.  It then displays a copyright symbol in
front of the line.  I think this interface, while usable, is not
intuitive.  A 2 column arrangement with the first column having some
sort of GUI selection for, say, a check mark and other visual queues for
such things as priority (How important is this To Do item?) would make
this much more appealing to use.

        After an item is completed, you can have the program transfer
that information to the Calendar's Day Note's subsection.  This is
useful for preparing a monthly report.  I think that at least one of the
To Do lists should be configured to do this transfer automatically. 
The others should have it as an option.  I would like this subsection of
Time Tracker to have more than 3 lists.  I'd like to be able to name
such lists things like 'Work', 'Home', 'User Group', 'Amiga', etc.  Of
course you can currently just add such headings as Text to the current 3
lists.

        There is an option to print To Do lists, and the manual
suggests you precede your items with the "[]" characters so you have
something to check off.  I think this should be added automatically and
save time.


ADDRESS BOOK

        The Address Book features 2 lists -- Business and Personal. 
I'd like to have more lists such as: Family, CoWorkers, BBSes, Clients,
and Suppliers. There is a listview gadget on the left side of the window
for finding your entered items.  To enter an item you click on the
'New' button and start filling in the various string gadgets.  There are
2 phone number entry gadgets.  One is for phone and one is for FAX.  I
could use more phone entry gadgets for things like home phone as well as
business phone numbers, or multiple extensions at a place of business
to try to reach someone.

        There is a gadget to have your modem dial the number in the
string gadget.  There are the standard fields for street address, city,
state, Zip Code, country, and additional notes.  I'd also like to have
multiple addresses per entry.  For business use, this could be address
for billing, and address for shipping.  For personal use, this could be
home address and work address.  There are options to print from here,
but I haven't had time to evaluate that -- yet.


CALL NOTES AND NOTEPAD

        The Notepad is a basic text editor.  By default, it opens the
last opened file, usually 'Call Notes'.  I think that since there is a
menu item for editing 'Call Notes', The Notepad should have its own
default file, so the user doesn't have to select 'New file' or 'Open
File...' every time they start the Notepad.  Unfortunately, you can only
have one of these editor windows open at a time.

        The editor has some quick menu shortcuts for things like Enter
Date, Enter Time, Enter Calculator Answer, etc. It does not support
drag-select, nor does it use the standard AmigaDOS Clipboard, so I can't
copy text from TurboText to the NotePad, nor copy an address to a
letter I'm writing in Final Copy.

        While there is word wrap, there are no options for using
non-default fonts or any styles such as bold or italic.  There is a
separate 'Call Notes' editor which you can access from the phone book,
by way of a gadget next to the phone number.  I think the 'edit call
notes' should not run the Notepad; instead, it should call this a editor
with the timer turned off and an option to turn it on if appropriate. 
This would keep the call notes separated from the Notepad, which is how
they belong in my opinion.  This separate Call Notes editor
automatically time stamps your entry and starts a timer to let you know
how long you've been on the phone.  This is good for keeping track of
what you talked about on the phone.  It has the same basic feature set
of the Notepad with the addition of the 2D analog clock style timer on
the left side of the editor window.  A prettier LCD type of display, or
a3D-style clock, would enhance its appearance.  A settable alarm for how
long you want to talk would also make a welcome addition.


CALCULATOR AND PUZZLE

        The calculator is a separate window with 2.x style buttons and
a visible paper tape to let you see your previous calculations.  It
responds to the numeric keypad just like the standard Workbench
calculator.  Its main additional features are memories, square root, and
percentage functions. While you can paste to other Time Tracker
editors, this calculator does not support the Amiga clipboard and thus
external programs.

        The included puzzle is a separate window with 3D-style buttons,
each containing a number from 1 through 15 which are shuffled.  The
object is to put the numbers back into appropriate order by clicking on
the piece you wish to move to the empty spot in the puzzle.  Just
something to waste time while you are waiting for someone to answer the
phone.


DOCUMENTATION

        The program comes with 74 page manual + 1 page addendum for
AmigaDOS 2.x and above users, explaining the WBStartup installation. 
The manual's binding cuts off some of the printed text so that it can be
difficult to read.  The print quality of the text and graphics is also
of poor quality, also hindering its ease of use.  Once you get past
that, the manual reads well and provides a useful reference for the
program.  It starts out with a tutorial, for those in a hurry.  The
manual then provides supplemental information and examples to help you
to use the program well.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

        I like the basic functionality of the program and the 3D-style
gadgets.

        I dislike the hard coded topaz.font, and think the program
could sell better if were written for AmigaDOS 2.x and above and used
prettier fonts.  I almost declined to purchase the program when I saw
the screen shots on the box.

        I'd like to see some more features added:

        - support of the AmigaDOS clipboard.
        - ability to send and receive ARexx commands.
        - support of AmigaDOS 2.x public screens.
        - ability to resize the calendar, address book, and puzzle
          windows.
        - alternate views for calendar (by month, by week, by year).
        - additional visual cues for events in the calendar.
        - user configurability of the default times listed in the event
          editor.
        - more and user titled To Do lists, with their own separate
          windows.
        - a more intuitive To Do List interface, with additional items
          like priorities.
        - more fields in the address book.
        - ability to print out in fonts other than the printer
          defaults.
        - a font sensitive interface.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

        I had previously purchased versions of Who!What!When!Where! and
Nag Plus, only to find their AmigaDOS 1.3 style interfaces reduced my
desire to use them.  Time Tracker does have an AmigaDOS 2.x style to
match my Workbench.  I don't have enough experience with these or the
various shareware packages to make any detailed comments here.  The
shareware packages I have taken a cursory glance at either had similar
misfeatures or a less attractive interface, in my opinion.


BUGS

        I didn't find any bugs.


VENDOR SUPPORT

        The registration card had a stamp on it, suggesting the company
wishes to keep track of their customers.  The technical support phone
number is listed as being available only on Wednesdays 9am-4pm Mountain
Time.


WARRANTY

        The diskette is warrantied for 90 days.  All else is
disclaimed.


CONCLUSIONS

        Overall, I have mixed reactions to this program.  It has much
of the functionality I require and will use.  I think the program could
be greatly enhanced to be both more functional and attractive.  I'm glad
I have something to use today.  I'd like something better to use
tomorrow.  I think the author should consider a rewrite with AmigaDOS
2.04 as a minimal platform, using more up to date things like clipboard
support, ARexx support, AmigaGuide help, an Installer script, and a font
sensitive interface.  The program is quite useful, but could be even
more so, with further development.

@node P1-9 "Windows 4.0 'Chicago' News"
@toc "menu"



/// Windows 4.0 "Chicago" News                   Like anybody cares...
    --------------------------
    Found on Usenet


The next major release of Windows will bear little visual resemblance to
Windows 3.1.  Wincows 4.0, code named "Chicago," entered pre-beta testing in
September, with shipment of an experimental version to more than one hundred
testers.
 
The user interface is based on version 2.0 of Microsoft's OLE (Object
linking and embedding) technology, and resembles thje Macintosh desktop more
than it does Windows 3.1.  In addition, it behaves very much like the OS.2
Workplace shell.
 
Instead of Windows discrete File Manager, there's a Macintosh-style desktop
with folders and icons,  Some folders are analogous to Windows 3.1 File
Manager groups.  Other folders, like Windows 3.1 File Manager folders,
represent disk directories.  Still other folders and icons represent a new
level of abstraction..  All networking, for instance, is accessed through a
world-globe icon that opens to a folder full of network icons.  Double
clicking on one of the network icons opens up a folder showing servers.
Double-clicking on a server icon opens a folder of shared resources, and so
on.
 
DOS is gone completely; underneath the new user interface beats a completely
new, 32-bit multitasking, multithreaded heart.  The Chicago kernel demands
substandtially less overhead than it's distant cousin Windows NT, and
executes easily in just 8mb of RAM.  Opinion varies on the probably RAM
requirements for a shipping version.  Some say as little as 4mb, but others
wonder what may be left out to achieve such a lean package.
 
Virtually all DOS and 16-bit Windows programs run from Chicago; It's
possible to execute Windows 3.1 itself from a Chicago command-line prompt,
and Chicago runs most Windows NT Programs.
 
Still, Chicago is not NT Lite.  Clearly, it's feature set bespeaks a nearly
ideal network client (and standalone desktop) operating system.  Chicago has
many of OS/2's advantages, yet preserves commonality with its ancestors.  It
doesn't make programmers -- or users -- choose between Windows and an
incompatible 32-bit model.  Yet is has 32-bit performance like Windows NT,
and might actually share drivers with NT.  It's disk performance is so
strong that we suspect Chicago is using some of NT's impressive virtual
memory disk caching technology as well.  It's capable of offering all this
without requiring outrageous amounts of RAM in a desktop system.  It
provides outstanding DOS and Windows application compatibility while
prividing true pre-emptive multitasking and multithreading.
 
The precise packaging MS will pursue with Chicago isn't clear as we go to
press.  The pre-beta version now in limited distribution includes Windows
for Workgroups-style peer-to-peer resource sharing.  Whether it will be
included with the Basic Chicago product was unclear at press time.
 
The pre-release version of Chicago is remarkably polished (some say it's
more stable than the late betas of Windows NT were), leading to speculation
that MS might be aiming for an early 1994 release.  But at MS's ODBC
developers conference, VP Mike Maples reiterated MS's intent to ship Chicago
in the Summer of 1994.

Major features:
 
New object-oriented user interface features folders, icons, true Desktop
metaphor.  (it's about time!!! -- mt)
 
32-bit engine delivers high performance, multitasking.
 
Runs easily in 8bm.  (shipped version may run in 4mb)
 
Requires (and exploits) 386 or better CPU.

   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.

/// Another Moronic, Inane and Gratuitous Article
    ---------------------------------------------
    By Chad Freeman
    (cjfst4+@pitt.edu)



Well, its once again time for your irregularly-appearing moronic, inane
and gratuitous article (yay!).  I have to admit to you folks, its
getting harder and harder to be funny about a dying computer platform. 
Commodore is in pretty dire straits at the moment, and while I've ridden
out worse storms than this one, it never puts me in a good mood.  Its
because, like most of the Amiga users out there now, I am not just a
user, I'm a fan.  I think that's what seperates people who own an Amiga
from other platforms with less personality.  And lets face it, the Amiga
has lots of personality.  From Guru Meditation Errors to Video
Toasters, the Amiga is platform that stands out in today's drab world of
look-alike, act-alike carbon-copy machinery.  Of course, that's the
Amiga's biggest drawback as well as its biggest asset.  The advertising
slogan that most truthfully describes our favorite machine is "The
Commodore Amiga.  Its Kinda Wierd."

Which brings us back to this article, which is REALLY wierd.  The AMTL
(Amiga Mis-Testing Labs) has been busy recently with its move to the
Love Canal, but 5 moving vans, 13,204 boxes and approximately 1 million
searth-friendly packing peanuts later, they have finally nestled in to
their new quarters and are back to mis-testing the latest hardware and
software for your Amiga.  Watch for a report soon from that wacky crew
(Hi Moe, Larry, Laverne and Charlie!  How's the glow down there?).  In
the meantime, I would like to present to you a special interview with
someone very high up in the Commodore chain, who has never granted an
interview before, and appears here only on condition his identity is not
revealed.  What he has to say is shocking, so pay close attention.  And
now, here it is...

THE AMIGA INTERVIEW WITH SOMEONE REALLY HIGH UP IN COMMODORE
(TAIWSRHUIC)

AMIGA:  So what should we call you?

SRHUIC: Call me Deep Pockets.

AMIGA:  OK, Deep Pockets, you hold a position very high-up in the
        Commodore organization.  What exactly is going on there nowadays?

DP:     Well, as you know Commodore is in a bit of trouble right now. 
        But I am here to reassure everyone here that Commodore will soon be
        making a big announcement that will brighten everyone's hopes for
        the future.

AMIGA:  Can you give us some hints as to what that announcement will
        involve?

DP:     No, but I can say there was an interesting report on the UPI
        wire this week about a new Japanese development.  Apparently the 
        Japanese have invented technology to turn sewage into sausages!

AMIGA:  Uh, WHAT?!

DP:     That's right!  Now I can't say what this has to do with Commodore, 
        but there's definately a relation between the two!

AMIGA:  Umm, OK.  Well, what new developments on the _computer_ front
        does Commodore have up its sleeve?

DP:     Well, the crack, highly-paid Commodore Engineering Staff is
        working on some exciting new products, and THOSE I can tell you 
        about.

AMIGA:  Please go on...

DP:     Well, the Amiga has turned out to be a computer that can
        emulate almost any other computer out there, right?  Well, with 
        that kind of ability, one doesn't really NEED AmigaDOS to sell 
        these machines, right?  So, the Commodore Engineering Staff is 
        now working on the Commodore Emulator Machine (CEM), an exciting 
        new platform that we think will sell in the hundreds!

AMIGA:  Uh, why wouldn't people just buy the other machines?  They
        usually run better than the emulators (although the Implant is the
        exception, see the AMTL report a while back!).

DP:     Hmm, uh, well, umm, oh, heck.  Hold on a sec, I have to use the
        phone.

AMIGA:  Sure...

DP:     Ok, I'm back.  Well, anyway, aside from the recently discontinued 
        CEM, our crack Engineering Staff has also been working on an
        exciting new games console, the VT^32!

AMIGA:  VT^32?

DP:     Yes, the CD^32 was just at too high a price point for most consumers,
        who aren't willing to pay more than about $150 for a game machine.
        So we looked for ways to cost-reduce it even further.  We thought
        about selling it without the controllers, documentation, plastic 
        case, box, power cord, and solder, but then I came up with a
        brilliant concept; replace the CD player with a videotape player!  
        Who needs niceties such like random access?  We'll give it to 'em 
        for $60 and they'll eat it up!

AMIGA:  You're a looney!

DP:     But wait!  There's more!  We're changing our name!  We will no
        longer be Commodore Business Machines!  Instead, we'll be Internal
        Brighteyed Numbercrunches!  IBN!  People will just think its a
        misprint of IBM and buy our machines in droves!  And we'll put a 
        little plum with a bite out of it on the box!  And advertise our 
        machines as 100% IBM compatible, and say in small print (with 
        seperate computer)!  I'm a genius!  I love myself!  I'm good 
        enough, I'm smart enough, and darnit, people LIKE ME!  I'll make a 
        billion!  I'll make a trillion!  I'm AWESOME!  Hey, where's that 
        guy with the middle-eastern sounding name that I can never remember!
        I've got to tell him about my new idea,  Commodore Commodes!  
        HAHAHAHAHEHEHEHEHEHE!!!  I'll show you yet, mom!  I CAN be on my 
        own!  HEHEHEHEHEHE!

(At this point DP ran out of the room, laughing uncontrollably and
leaving a trail of drool in his wake).

Well, there you have it folks.  I don't know about you, but IG, I mean,
DP has reinstilled my faith in Commodore as a business powerhouse.  See
you next time!

/// The Emulation Rambler
    ---------------------
    By Jason Compton
    (jcompton@tcity.com)



It looks like I have considerably more to write about this week than I did
last.  So I'll get right to it.

First off, I'd like to announce that I have upgraded my system. I've now got
an A3000/25 with 2 chip/8 fast megs and a 1950 monitor.  Bad part? In
upgrading, I had to sell off my 286 bridgeboard, so any IBM work I do is
solely on PC-Task (and let me tell you, I won't be doing much...) But next
week I will have my preliminary benchmark reports, and if any of the people
interested in doing marks on even faster systems would return my mail,
I'll send them up my benchmark package.

General alert:
As if we've never heard Commodore rumors before...but now, since 
they've released their quarter report, the alarms are going off again.  I
believe I've suggested a good course of action for them, and from what
Jim Drew at UU has told me, it was being followed (not because I
suggested it, but...) I had proposed an Amiga/emulation bundle long ago,
and I was told that there was going to be a 4000/Emplant bundle coming
up.  I haven't heard any more news on it, but I hope it's coming. Good thing,
too, because if you read last week's Amiga Report, you would have seen the
report of an upcoming Mac Centris system which comes built-in ready to
run cross-platform (Mac System and DOS/Windows) software...the report
seemed to imply that the three would not run simultaneously, at best in a
"wait-state", activated by hotkeys.  What better time would it be for
Commodore to turn around and announce a TRIPLE platform system, 
capable of Mac System 7.x, Windows 3.x, and Workbench 3.x?  Shut
Apple up, get them off their high horse, and present a major threat to
EVERYONE in the industry.

My congratulations go out to ALL emulation manufacturers throughout the
years.  They have, in the vast majority, made their emulators into very good
investments for an Amiga owner.  Now it is time for emulation to become
more.  It must become the reason to buy an Amiga.  Not to wait for a Centris
"DOS Compatible" system, not to wait for a PowerPC computer (I find it
VERY, VERY interesting that Apple would release a cross-platform system
with PowerPC allegedly so close.  Maybe it's not nearly as useful as we've
been lead to believe?), to buy an Amiga TODAY.  NOW, dammit.

While I currently am a backer of Emplant and anxiously await my evaluation
board, it seems that ReadySoft is about to step back into the picture and
release A-Max IV.  This has been confusing me for about a month, as the 
rumors have flown...since I don't remember a III ever existing.  At any rate,
here's what ReadySoft purports:

{Begin comp.sys.amiga.emulations quote, my comments with dashes}

Runs Apple System 7.0, 7.1, 32-bit QuickDraw, QuickTime, AppleScript
and other Apple system software, with your Mac 128K ROMs.
-Stop right here.  128k ROMs, eh?  ReadySoft must have done some
SERIOUS patching in order to make 128k ROMs act like 256k ROMs.

Supports Mac color applications running on multiple display devices
forming a virtual Mac desktop.  Display devices can be several Amiga ECS
or AGA autoscroll (any size) screens (up to 256 color), and displays on
third-party video cards such as the Picasso II, Retina, EGS and others,
up to 24-bits per pixel.  Multiple displays are configured with the Mac
"Monitors" control panel which allows the displays' relative position
and number of colors to be set.

Addresses up to 2Gb of RAM, with a 32-bit clean memory manager that
allows Mac application memory to be dynamically allocated from AmigaDOS
as programs are launched from the Finder.  A memory management unit
(MMU) is no longer necessary to address 32-bit RAM.

Multitasks with AmigaDOS and Amiga applications, and uses standard
Amiga System 2.1 or 3.x device drivers to control hard drives on any
controller, floppies, serial and parallel ports (including ports on
third party devices).  There are no longer any A-Max hard disk drivers
required nor any limit on the number of partitions or the number of
controllers to be accessed.
-Interesting.

Accesses Mac SCSI devices such as CD-ROMs, hard drives, laser printers
and scanners etc. through your own SCSI controller.

Access Ethernet networks with any SANA-II compatible controller.

Supports Mac stereo sound.

Transfers files directly between any AmigaDOS storage device and any

Macintosh hard drive partitions or floppy disks.  User friendly software
allows conversions between text, MacBinary, MacPaint and IFF, and

PostScript files.  Text translation now handles international,
accented, and special characters.

Saves ImageWriter 9 and 24-pin output as Amiga IFF files, for printing
to an AmigaDOS printer device.

Supports text cut and paste between the AmigaDOS clipboard device and
the Mac Finder.

The Apple SuperDrive is emulated to support 720K MS-DOS disks (or 1.4
Mb disks with high density drive) with the Apple File Exchange file
transfer program, and other applications such as SoftPC, the IBM
emulation package.

Lots of preferences and options, controlled by a new Workbench 2
startup program.

Requires any 68020/68030 or 68040 processor, Apple System version 7.0
or higher (7.1 recommended), 2Mb free RAM, System 2.1 or higher.

A-Max II Plus owners get this gem for $119.95.  Original A-Max owners
can purchase A-Max IV for $349.95 and send in their original cartridge
for a $100 rebate.  The price is $279.95 when your order is accompanied
by a "competing" Mac emulator for the Amiga (ouch!).

{End comp.sys.amiga.emulations quote}

Well...wow.  But sometimes I'm glad I don't send my article out to Rob as 
soon as I'm done with it...Jim Drew just informed the CSAE crowd that 
Utilities Unlimited has filed a restraining order against ReadySoft for 
patent violation.  What patents?  I'll let you know when I find out.

Next week I should have my first preliminary PC-Task vs. SoftPC vs. 486/66
comparisons...run of course on my new 3000/25...all I can say at this point
is that we lose the first round big time. :)

That's all I've got this week.  See you next time...

                      Macintosh Quadra 610 Computer
                      =============================

Apple Unveils Plans for Macintosh Quadra Computer with MS-DOS- and
Windows-Compatibility

LAS VEGAS, Nevada--November 15, 1993--As part of its commitment to
provide cross-platform computing solutions, Apple Computer, Inc.
today announced it is developing a Macintosh Quadra computer with MS-
DOS- and Windows-compatibility.  Packed with the powerful Motorola
68LC040 and an Intel486 SX microprocessors, the Macintosh Quadra 610,
DOS Compatible version computer is being designed to enable users to
run Macintosh, DOS and Windows applications.  The company will unveil
its plans for the product today at Comdex, the largest personal
computer tradeshow in the U.S.

    The Macintosh Quadra 610, DOS Compatible version, which is planned
to be preinstalled with MS-DOS 6.2, is being designed to provide users
with multiple-platform options and protect their current investment
in software.  Apple's goal is to deliver a product that is ideally
suited for home office users and small businesses with cross-platform
computing needs.  At the touch of two keys, users will be able to
switch from the Macintosh computer environment to DOS and back again.

Users to Work in Two Environments at the Same Time
---------------------------------------------------
    The Macintosh Quadra 610, DOS Compatible version is planned to
feature dual processors, enabling users to work in both environments
simultaneously.  The Macintosh Quadra 610, DOS Compatible version is
being designed to feature a 25 MHz 68LC040, powering the Macintosh
computer environment, and a 25 MHZ Intel486 SX, which runs DOS or
Windows-based software.  Because the  Nobody home...dual processors will
work independently, users will be able to run Macintosh and DOS or
Windows' applications in tandem and even cut and paste data between the
two environments.

    Dual monitor support is designed to provide customers with the
option of viewing the Macintosh and DOS environments at the same time,
allowing the user to add the second display monitor without
purchasing an additional video card.  The Macintosh Quadra 610, DOS
Compatible version is expected to support most VGA, SVGA and
multisync monitors as well as the Apple 14" or 16" Macintosh Color
Displays.

    Apple expects the same hard drive to run Macintosh, MS-DOS or
Windows applications and plans to offer an optional internal CD-ROM
drive designed to run Macintosh, DOS and Windows CD-ROM discs, providing
users with access to the hundreds of exciting CD-ROM titles currently
available.  In addition, Apple expects DOS and Windows applications
to print to any Apple- or Macintosh-compatible printer through a
built-in serial port or optional Ethernet port.

    Comparable in cost to most Macintosh- or DOS-only systems today, the
Macintosh Quadra 610, DOS Compatible version is expected to be priced
at a U.S. ApplePrice of less than $500 over the Quadra 610 model.

Upgrade Information
-------------------
    A DOS Compatibility Card for Macintosh is being planned for Quadra
610 and Centris 610 owners to upgrade for less than $500 in the U.S.
Apple will provide pricing and availability information when the
product is completed and ready for release.

Hello!

This week we changed our distribution site for those of you who have
Amiga Report sent to you via Internet email. For more information
click on this button --> @{" Mailing List " link P4-5}
Many, many thanks goes to Bob Caron for making the mailing list
available in the past...through his help we were able to reach a 
larger audience, and now I wish to thank Portal Communications for
letting us use their facilities to distribute Amiga Report. We would
have lost the abilities to distribute Amiga Report to over 300 sites
without their help!

This week we also have the "Great Amiga Report Questionaire". If you
all could please take just a little bit of your time and answer these
question, and then send it back to me it would be fantastic. Basically
we want to find out a little bit about you...the Amiga User. What do you
have, what are you using the Amiga for, what would you like to see. We'll
have the results of the survey and put it in our last issue of Amiga Report
for this year.

On other fronts....

I talked to Supra Corporation the other day, and asked them a few questions
on what we might be seeing from them in the near future.

My first question was about the V.Fast (Vee Dot Fast) standard, and if
they were planning on adding this to their line of modems. 

The answer was yes ....but.... since the commitee that is setting up
the standard is not quite finished, it will still be a while...we will
not probably see it until the fall of 1994 or later. But Supra is
planning on creating a modem using an interim standard. It which should
work and act much like the final V.Fast will. The expect to have this out
somewhere in the spring or late summer.

Will there be voice compatabilities for the Amiga using a Supra?
Well ...he said "YES". They have brought this out for the MacIntosh
already, and he said that they will have it and it will be available
in conjunction with the MS-DOS version or shortly thereafter. He wasn't
able to give a specific time frame.

The last question I had was about the possibility for an internal
14.4 baud modem. The answer on that was a pretty big "No". He stated
that on the internal 2400 baud modems (the 2400zi and 2400zi plus),
they sold poorly. So poorly in fact that they sold more HD controllers
and hard drives than they ever did the internal 2400  ...by a huge
margin. He said that the only way they might even concider creating
an internal 14.4 is if CBM changed their outlook on how to market
the Amiga and help create a larger user base.

Kinda sad, but I can't blame them.

Did any of you read Mike Royko's (Chicago Tribune) article on the
internet...well, he gave an account of what it's like for a
newcomer. From his accounts, it sounds like his host was Delphi...although
I can't be sure here, but I would bet on it :)

Anyways, he talks about his introduction to the Internet as only he can
describe ...the strange things he comes across, like World-Wide-Web,
Gopher, Archie, and Veronica. Which sounds kinda like Bill Murray meeting
the comics in Charlotte's web (Huh!??). He kind of understood and talked 
about the things we all see on our first encounter ...and the challenge 
we all face to overcome the first Internet hurdle. It may all be new
to us, but I have a feeling that soon our children will be learning
about all of this in school.  Good!

@node P4-6 "BIX"
@toc "menu"

/// BIX - Byte Information Exchange             Lots of information!
    -------------------------------



BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and enthusiasts.
While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is the place for 
knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  You're likely 
to find many others in similar situations who can offer advice, give 
technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.

BIX is divided into areas called conferences, each devoted to a 
particular area of interest.  They range from algorithms to windows,
from writers to amiga.  Conferences are categorized into groups,
usually referred to as exchanges, so that you can browse through
whatever groups interest you and see a list of the conferences it 
contains.


                  These are some of the exchanges on BIX:

amiga.exchange - the place for Amiga developers and enthusiasts
byte - the full text of each issue of BYTE magazine; source code too 
e.and.l - Entertainment and Leisure; music, pets, games, more
ibm.exchange - everything from OS/2 to PC clones
mac.exchange -  Mac news, support, software, advice
professionals - consultants, engineers, financiers gather here
programmers - some of the best brains in the business!
wix - the Information Exchange for Windows; Windows Magazine online
writers.ex - the professional and amateur writer's exchange


                       *** FULL INTERNET ACCESS! ***

BIX also features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription. 


                      ==============================
                      Rates and Connect Information:

- Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia

  A developer version of the CD32 appears to have an A4000-style keyboard
  connector, labeled "AUX."  Connecting a keyboard actually works.  Reports
  are that games such as Pinball Fantasies work better using the standard
  keyboard key commands.  Other reports include individuals trying to 
  connect Subaru automatic seatbelts and Toyota power steering pumps.
  These attempts, however, have failed.

New users can call and get ANY copy of Amiga Report.  These are considered
"free" downloads, they do not count against any file ratio.  The latest issue
of Amiga Reports can be Freq'ed (FileREQusted) from here as "AR.LHA", as "AR"
or as ARxxx.LHA where xxx is the issue number.  Freq's are valid at ANY time.

For users interested in reading AR, but who do not have access to AmigaGuide,
you can freq ARBUL and get the AR in bulletin form.  This service is provided
for persons who do not have Amigaguide (such as IBM users).  Please note that
any pictures distributed with the "regular" Amiga Reports archive will NOT be
sent with this freq.  This file is not available for dial-in users, but you
can read bulletin #5 with your capture buffer open and get the same file.
