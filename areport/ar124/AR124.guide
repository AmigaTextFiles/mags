/// From the Editor's Desk                        "Saying it like it is!"
    ----------------------


Somebody said something to me the other day that got me thinking.  Where
exactly is the Amiga headed?  I don't mean Commodore or their financial
problems, or even the possibility that they might go out of business.  I
mean, _where_ is the Amiga's future?  Motorola's 68K line of microprocessors
is nearing the end.  I seriously doubt there will be a chip above the 68060.
The future is RISC.  I read a document from Apple recently stating that they
are moving the entire Macintosh line to PowerPC.  PowerPC is a new RISC chip
that was developed jointly by Motorola and Intel.  It's a neat processor,
with a lot of features.

The 486 is on its way out.  Pentium systems are already approaching afford-
ability (okay, $4000 isn't THAT affordable, but in three months, they'll
probably be under $3000).  DEC's Alpha chip is another contender in the
high-power CPU wars.  Windows NT already runs on it.  These new CPUs will
outrun most mainframe systems.  I was talking with the director of computer
operations at a leading health insurance company this morning, and he told
me that their Amdahl mainframe runs at 72 MIPS.  The 68060 and the Pentium
are both rated at 100 MIPS.  And they don't require forty tons of cooling
equipment to operate!

The point I'm making is that Commodore cannot rely on the 68000 series for
much longer, if it expects to have the Amiga compete with Apple and the
clone makers newest systems.  If the word from that Commodore Insiders
conference on GEnie a few weeks ago is correct -- that Commodore really
doesn't have a 68060 machine in the works, then perhaps its time for them
to move elsewhere.  I think Commodore should consider moving the Amiga line
to the PowerPC chip as well.  Why?  First, it'll be the easiest move.
There will be plenty of programmers familiar with porting 68K code to
PowerPC systems, since Apple is already going that route.  Secondly, it's a
fairly inexpensive, yet very powerful CPU.  So what about existing software?
Apple will be including a software emulator with all PowerPC-based Macs
that will run existing applications at a reasonable speed.  The same could
be done with the Amiga.  Sure, the games aren't going to run, but that's
what used 500's and 1200's are for.  Besides, if you want a game machine,
get a PC -- that's where the games really are!

But beyond the decision to move to a new processor is the question of IF
the Amiga can survive.  It is, without a doubt, the best OS ever made for
any personal computer.  But with PC's becoming easier and easier to use,
and with Microsoft's dominance in the software industry (what new PC
DOESN'T come with Windows and Works??), can the Amiga continue to
compete?  I think that unless Commodore really screws up and goes out of
business, the Amiga will continue on as a video productions-based computer,
just like it has in the past.  It will continue to have a loyal userbase,
but it won't be a large one.  Many Amiga owners will either have fully
blown PC's to supplement their machines, or they will have Bridgeboards
decked out as far as they will go.  Just because it's where the software is.

Now on the optomistic side, if C= really did go PowerPC (quickly), and
actually market the machine, it might have a real chance at being taken
seriously.  It would also be the first affordable RISC-based computer on
the market.  You can guess what the PowerPC Macs are going to sell for
when they arrive (yikes!).

The bottom line is that I don't think the Amiga will become extinct. It will
simply continue on in the shadows as the kick-butt computer it always has
been.

IBM LAUNCHES FEATURE-PACKED NOTEBOOKS

SOMERS, NEW YORK -- Hoping to repeat the success of earlier ThinkPad models,
IBM has launched the ThinkPad 750 series, which brings to the notebook line
new multimedia capabilities still rare in portable computers. 

The new notebooks have built-in stereo audio subsystems, with jacks for
microphones, headphones, or speakers. Options promised by early next year
include an add-on device that will let users display a television or video
signal on the ThinkPad 750's screen, and a mobile communications module for
wireless telephone, facsimile, and electronic mail. 

Another option, IBM VoiceType Control speech recognition software, will let
users control the machines with spoken commands. 

The new ThinkPad 750 line includes four models. The basic 750 is a monochrome
notebook, though it can be upgraded to an active matrix color screen or one
that accepts pen input. The 750P accepts pen as well as keyboard input. The
750Cs has a 9.5-inch, dual-scan, passive matrix color display. Finally, the
750C has a 10.4-inch, active matrix color display. 

All four models use a 33-megahertz (MHz) 486SL processor, and come with a
Personal Computer Memory Card Interface Association (PCMCIA) Type III slot, as
much as 20 megabytes (MB) of memory, and a choice of 170-MB or 340-MB hard disk
drive. 

All four also use the TrackPoint pointing device, a small lever mounted in the
middle of the keyboard to take the place of a mouse or trackball. 

In spite of their special multimedia capabilities, the machines are expected to
appeal to a broad market, an IBM spokesperson said. 

The ThinkPad Dock I docking station provides a full-size Industry Standard
Architecture (ISA) expansion slot, and support for as many as five Small
Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) internal or external devices, with one SCSI
drive bay that can hold an optional compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM)
drive. The Dock I also includes built-in stereo speakers and a battery charger.

There are also two port replicators meant to allow easy connection to a network
when in the office. The Port Replicator I has a PCMCIA Type III slot, while the
Port Replicator II does not. 

In the first quarter of 1994, IBM plans to provide the ThinkPad TV Tuner
module, a device that will let users plug TV or video feeds into the notebook
and see them displayed on the screen. To use this option, ThinkPad 750 owners
will need to take out the notebook's removable diskette drive. The TV Tuner
module will fit in the space vacated by the drive. 

Users can also remove the diskette drive to lighten the machine when
travelling, IBM said. Without the diskette drive, the basic 750 weighs five
pounds, while the other models weigh up to 6.1 pounds. The diskette drive adds
half a pound to the weight, the company said. 

Removing the disk drive will also make room for another option, a cellular
digital packet data module called the ThinkPad CDPD. This will allow for
wireless phone, fax, or electronic mail communication, and is due to be
available in the first quarter of next year. 

IBM claimed the 750 offers impressive battery life. The company said the 750
and 750P will run for about 12 hours in typical use and the color models will
run about eight hours. 

IBM PC Direct catalog prices are: $3,199 for the ThinkPad 750 with 170-MB hard
disk; $3,749 for the 750 with 340-MB hard disk; $3,749 for the 750P with 170-MB
hard disk; $4,299 for the 750P with 340-MB hard disk; $3,899 for the 750Cs with
170-MB hard disk; $4,449 for the 750Cs with 340-MB hard disk; $4,699 for the
750C with 170-MB hard disk; and $5,249 for the 750C with 340-MB hard disk. 

All models are available now, IBM said, except the 750Cs, which is due to be
available by the end of November. 

The ThinkPad Dock I is also available now at $899, while the Port Replicator I
and II are available now at $299 and $109 respectively. 

The machines have a three-year warranty.

IBM OFFERS OS/2 PUBLICATIONS ON CD-ROM

AUSTIN, TEXAS -- IBM has announced that the OS/2 Online Book Collection,
the first compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM) compilation of OS/2-related
documents, is now available worldwide. 

The disk contains the text and graphics of more than 100 product manuals,
publications, and white papers, all published by IBM, a spokeswoman for the
company said. According to the company the contents would cost about $1,000 if
purchased separately, but the list price for the CD-ROM is $49. 

The CD-ROM also contains the IBM Library Reader, which lets users view books
under OS/2 or DOS and provides search and retrieval functions. Tools included
on the CD-ROM let users upload books to a workstation hard disk or a mainframe,
the company said. 

"Now, instead of paging through books, users and developers can find the
answers they need through a quick CD-ROM search," said Wally Casey, director of
marketing for IBM's Personal Software Products business unit, in a prepared
statement. 

Books are grouped into "bookshelves" such as OS/2 Product Documentation, OS/2
Technical Library, Communications Manager, LAN Server, and Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) for OS/2. Users can also create customized
bookshelves that contain only the books they refer to most often, IBM said.

QUICKEN 3 FOR WINDOWS CUTS DATA ENTRY W/CALENDAR 

MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA -- Intuit claims the best new feature in Quicken 3 for
Windows is its new calendar that looks like a paper calendar and can be used
to schedule automated payments, record past activity, or just mark an
upcoming event. Intuit claims the calendar metaphor is not only easier to
use, but eliminates much of the repetitive data entry involved in using a
financial program. 

Intuit says its research decidedly showed a universal dislike for data entry.
The new Quicken 3 product is aimed at eliminating as much data entry as
possible. Some transactions must be entered, but Quicken says once they are,
users can simply pick those transactions off a memorized list and drop them
onto the calendar. 

Users who like the checkbook metaphor will be glad to know that it remains in
the product. 

The calendar can also be used to track birthdays and special events, just like
a paper calendar, the company added. Recurring transactions can be set up for
automatic entry as well, with or without the requirement for the approval of
the user before the transaction is posted. 

The program can also track investments via built-in spreadsheets so users no
longer have to export the information to a spreadsheet product in order to view
investment performance, the company said. Different views of the spreadsheets
offer the ability to look at investments from varying viewpoints, such as
estimated income, return on investment, percentage yield, market value, market
value change, and percent market value. Views may be customized as well. 

In addition, the Quickzoom feature, originally introduced to show the numbers
behind graphs and reports, has been expanded to the register so users may
create summary reports from their register transactions. A Quickreport feature
offers standard report layouts, and a new Comparison Reports feature has also
been added. 

Visual representation in the forms of graphs is available via the Financial
Planning Graph feature so users can see projected net worth, cash flow, and
future account balances. Trends in the current financial situation can be
viewed as well, and different what-if scenarios can be created and saved,
Intuit said. The program can even earmark funds for future financial goals and
let you know if current spending will impede those goals. 

Intuit says it offers better loan tracking in Quicken 3, so users can review
and manipulate all the information on their loans in one place. For those with
variable rate loans, anticipated interest rate changes can be forecasted and
stored and projected loan payments may then be calculated. 

Quicken also exports financial data to tax programs such as Turbotax from San
Diego, California-based Chipsoft. As a matter of fact, Intuit recently
announced it is purchasing Chipsoft, for an estimated $225 million and the
companies are boasting this merger will have the long term effect of making
financial integration and tax reporting even easier for users. 

Quicken 3 for Windows requires Windows 3.1 and 2 megabytes of random access
memory (RAM). The product is shipped on 3.5-inch disks, but users have the
option of receiving 5.25-inch disks by mail. 

The new version is retail priced at $69.95. Those upgrading from previous
versions of Quicken who purchase the product through retail channels get a $10
rebate, and new users get a $5 rebate. However, current users will find they
receive a substantial savings by ordering the product directly from Intuit for
$29.95 plus $5 shipping and handling.

TOSHIBA/MICROSOFT PACT INCLUDES MICROSOFT AT WORK 

REDMOND, WASHINGTON -- Toshiba is the second company to actually license the
Microsoft at Work (MAW) operating system, according to an announcement made
by the two companies. 

Both Microsoft and Toshiba said they plan to work closely together in order to
make the Windows operating system and its graphical user interface (GUI)
off-shoots, such as MAW, work smoothly in consumer and computer hardware from
Toshiba. 

While the companies say they will work together on notebook and handheld
devices, specifically handheld devices that use MAW, Microsoft representatives
said today's announcement should not be viewed as a product announcement by
Toshiba. International Data Corporation (IDC) says Toshiba is the leading
vendor in the US portable computer market with 16.2 percent of the volume for
1992 and leads the notebook market with 20.7 percent of the sales 1992 volume. 

Microsoft announced MAW, internally known at the software giant as "Winpad," in
June of this year in New York. Over 65 companies announced support for MAW and
Compaq has licensed it for use in a planned handheld device. 

MAW is an operating system for smart office machines. The idea here is to make
products where all the features of the product are available via a graphical
user interface (GUI), instead of users having to learn to use the device
standing at the machine with the manual in one hand. Microsoft describes MAW as
a real- time, pre-emptive multitasking operating system designed to
specifically address the requirements of the office automation and
communication industries. MAW will hopefully offer digital connections between
the various types of office devices, such as fax machines and photo copiers, as
well as with personal computers running Windows. 

Specifics of the agreement are sketchy, but are outlined by Toshiba and
Microsoft as cooperation on: the next generation of Microsoft's operating
system software, currently planned to contain mobile services for notebook
computer users; handheld computing devices incorporating MAW software "Plug and
Play," which allows hardware and software to automatically configure the system
with minimal user involvement; and product support and marketing programs that
include technical support and marketing communications. 

This announcement is on the heels of an announcement by Sharp that it plans to
incorporate the GUI DOS-compatible Geos operating system in its next handheld
device, the PT-9000. Expected for fourth quarter introduction this year, Sharp
is calling the PT-9000 a Personal Information Assistant (PIA) and says the
steno-pad sized pen-based unit will have a detachable keyboard. Casio and Tandy
have already announced adoption of the Geos operating system for the Zoomer, a
personal digital assistant (PDA) expected for introduction later this month. 

Microsoft representatives said there have been no plans announced to
incorporate Windows into the hardware of Toshiba notebook computers.
Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft introduced a palmtop computer, the Omnibook, in
which Windows is incorporated into the hardware of the notebook in much the
same way Apple Computer has incorporated its operating system into the
read-only memory (ROM) hardware of its computers. 

Toshiba Computer Systems (TAIS) is headquartered in Irvine, California and
boasts $1 billion annually in sales. It is owned by Toshiba America, a
subsidiary of the $39.9 billion Toshiba Corporation of Japan. Microsoft is the
world's largest software company, headquartered in Redmond, Washington. 



                      ------------------------------



RUPERT MURDOCH FIRMS UP DIGITAL SATELLITE PLANS 

LONDON, ENGLAND -- Rupert Murdoch, the millionaire magnate behind the
British Sky Broadcasting (BSB) satellite TV network in the UK, has
revealed he has signed a deal to develop a common international satellite
TV system. 

"We have been for some time developing the means with which people will access
the almost infinite wealth of programming and services (which) digital
compression will bring the consumer," Murdoch said, adding that he has now
signed a contract with National Transcommunications Limited (NTL), the UK
telecom research company, as well as Comstream, the US high technology firm. 

The contract was signed last between News International, Murdoch's media
company, and NTL plus Comstream. 

Although Murdoch has given no further details of the agreement, industry
sources suggest that the digital TV system will be tested on the Astra 1D
satellite which is scheduled to begin transmissions some time next year. The
Astra 1A, 1B and 1C satellites, which between them, carry 48 satellite stations
across Europe, work to analog standards. 

Using digital transmission standards could, in theory, increase the number of
channels per transponder from one to eight, meaning that a 16-transponder
satellite such as Astra 1D could carry as many as 128 different channels. 

In the short term, there are unlikely to be many broadcast channels available,
Newsbytes notes. Instead, what is likely to happen is that the same movie will
be transmitted on eight different channels, each channel staggered by 15
minutes from the others. So, no matter what time a viewer tunes in to a movie,
s/he would wait no longer than 15 minutes for it to start.

BABYLON 5 TV PILOT WINS AN EMMY!


By J. Michael Straczynski

We just received word the other day that Foundation Imaging, Ron's company,
which did the CGI EFX for the Babylon 5 Pilot, was notified today that they
have received an Emmy Award from the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
We are now an "Emmy Award Winning Show for Best Special Effects in a
Television Movie."

The CGI special effects -- yes, the very ones Jeff Jarvis called "cheesy" in
TV Guide, along with a few others -- just won an Emmy from the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences for Best Special Effects in a Television Movie.

It's practically *unheard of* for a pilot to win an Emmy in this category.
Best of all, it's not a popularity contest award, it's a tough panel,
examining everything. You can stuff ballots a bit by having lots of people
working on the show in this category vote, but that doesn't work with a jury
like this. It's given strictly on the merits.

We haven't even gone on the air yet with the regular series, and we've got an
Emmy under our belt, thanks to the very hard work of some very dedicated and
talented people -- and that ain't *nothing* compared to what's going to be in

@toc "menu"


MICROTOUCH SYSTEMS INTRODUCES LOW-COST TOUCH MONITOR FOR THE AMIGA


MicroTouch Systems, Inc. today introduced the low-cost TruePoint CA-42
Touch Monitor, a durable touch screen monitor for Amiga-based multimedia,
kiosk, training, and business applications. The TruePoint package includes
the new high-resolution Commodore 1942 14-inch display, a completely
integrated capacitive touch screen, controller, and the AmigaTouch Driver.
Now all Amiga applications can use a touch screen -- providing all the
functionality of a mouse but with a much friendlier user interface.

Plug-and-Play

The TruePoint CA-42 Monitor is a plug-and-play solution that offers greater
ease of use and convenience to VARs and systems integrators seeking to add
touch screen input to their new or existing applications. By offering a
completely integrated touch monitor, the unit addresses an important market
need for a touch system that doesn't require assembly from a touch screen
kit.

Superior Touch Performance

The TruePoint CA-42 Monitor uses MicroTouch's industry-leading patented
analog capacitive touch technology, which involves the sensing of electrical
signals generated on a conductive coating. The unique construction of the
MicroTouch capacitive sensor makes it the only touch technology that delivers
high resolution, optical clarity, speed, and durability all in on package.
(Technology Backgrounder available upon request.)

Computer Network, Inc., a systems integrator, has recently installed an
Amiga-based Touch Screen Kiosk in the Las Vegas Hilton. The information kiosk
allows hotel/casino visitors to learn about the hotel's services and
activities. According to Kevin Kostiner, president of Computer Network, Inc.,
"We looked at several touch screen products and selected MicroTouch due to
the high quality of their capacitive touch screns. In a hectic casino
environment we need an extremely durable touch screen solution."

The Power of the Amiga Combined with Touch

Amiga computers, with advanced graphics and enhanced audio and video
capabilities, have become increasingly popular in multimedia applications.
The recently announced Commodore 1942 monitor was specifically designed for
multimedia applications. The monitor includes built-in stereo speakers and
audio input making it more convenient for multimedia developers. Combining
the Amiga computer and the 1942 monitor with the user-friendliness of touch
screens makes Amiga systems the perfect solution for many different
multimedia applications.

AmigaTouch Driver Specifications

The AmigaTouch Driver allows all Amiga software to run seamlessly with the
touch screen and comes complete with control panel to set touch screen
preferences, including cursor offset and sensitivity. The AmigaTouch Driver
supports two-button mouse emulation, multitasking from Workbench or CLI,
simultaneous mouse and touch screen usage, and is compatible with both PAL
and NTSC Amiga computers.

Touch Montior Display Specifications

The TruePoint CA-42 is based on the high-quality, Commodore Amiga 1942
monitor. This high-resolution, Super VGA 14-inch monitor has a dot pitch of
0.28mm, a maximum resolution of 800x600 non-interlaced, a vertical scan rate
of 45-75 Hz, and a horizontal scan rate of 15.6-15.8 to 27.3-31.5 KHz. The
monitor comes complete with stereo speakers, audio input, front accessible
controls, and a tilt/swivel base.

Pricing, Availability, and Warranty

The TruePoint CA-42 Monitor is available immdiately through dealers or
directly from MicroTouch. The list price for the TruePoint CA-42 is $1,495;
volume and dealer discounts are available. The MicroTouch capacitive sensor
has a five-year warranty, the controller has a two-yar warranty, and the
Commodore Amiga 1942 monitor has a 90-day warranty.

MicroTouch Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: MTSI) headquartered in Methuen, Mass., is
the leading manufacturer of touch screens used in point-of-sale, information,
and self-service kiosk, gaming, industrial, multimedia, and other
computer-based applications. The company also markets fully-integrated kiosks
and digitizers for pen computing. MicroTouch, a public company founded in
1982, reported sales of over $30 million in 1992, and was recently ranked by
Forbes Magazine as the 23rd Best Small Business in the United States.

/// Mindless Babble
    ---------------
    by Robert Niles


Well I guess it's one of those months in which I get to babble a bit,
which if you ask some of the people I know, is something I do best!

There's going to be some changes with my system in the next week. I will
be converting over to a different "BBS" ...if BBS is what you would call
it. I'm going to be using AXshell, by Pasi (Albert) Ojala, as a host in
which the users will be able use InterNet email and participate in
various newsgroups. ....so if you call @{"In The MeanTime" link P2-1-2} to get Amiga
Report, you will definately notice some changes (of course there will 
still be file transfers!!). At the same time I will be coming off of the
FidoNet, and will not be able to accept File REQuests (FREQs). Sorry, 
but not too much I can do about it right now, hopefully that will change
in the future.

NPR (National Public Radio) spoke about InterCON which I think was held
in San Francisco (brain has been dead lately). The convention was mostly
all about the InterNet and it's functions. One company (and again, my
forgetfulness) has designed a system in which you can access the InterNet
using cable...the cable that cable T.V. comes on....FAST transfer rates
during FTPs and Telnets, etc. The representative from the company demo-ed
the system there at InterCON and ran around the US and Europe getting
files, playing music, and viewing pictures. Now if we all could have this
feature in the near future, then our on-line lives would be so much the
better...I hope to see this take off!!

Anyone read UNIX Review?? Well they narrowed down all the reasons NOT to
use MS-DOS to only 50 reasons. Side-stepping that difficulty, some of the
reasons were quick pot-shots at Bill Gates to important ones like lack of
security. Although one might think that there is a bias within the
article, it really layed down some good reasons NOT to own the MS-DOS
platform...and it raises the question as to why MS-DOS is so popular.
Who of you have tried out MS-DOS v6.0??

I'm glad to own an Amiga!

Ed Dukeshire (FidoNet 1:324/134), the creator of the World-Wide Amiga BBS 
List (WABL) has already sent out another edition of this wonderful list. 
You most likely can find it on quite a few BBSes and on the commercial 
services (I don't know if it's on the InterNet yet) as WABL9309.LHA. The 
BBS list keeps getting bigger and better. Look for it if you haven't 
already, but more importantly, get the Application for WABL (included in 
Amiga Report #1.21,or in the WABL archive), fill it out and send it to 
Ed. Information on how to contact him is within the application.

On another note Mario Bonelli (FidoNet 1:273/934) has started up the
AMIGA_HAM echo. Right now this echo is not on the backbone but his goal is
to get enough systems connected so that it can be. The AMIGA_HAM echo is
simply to talk about and get information on how to use the HAM radio with
the Amiga. Ranging from just being a HAM to packet radio. For more
information on connecting to this echo please contact Mario at the FidoNet
address listed above. There's some REALLY interesting stuff here!

Well that's all for this week, ya'll take care!

@node P1-7 "PCMCIA Ethernet Adaptors for OmniBook"
@toc "menu"


SOCKET DELIVERS FIRST PCMCIA ETHERNET ADAPTERS FOR THE HP OMNIBOOK 300


Socket Communications Inc. today began shipping PCMCIA Ethernet adapters
for Hewlett Packard's popular OmniBook 300 sub-notebook. The SocketLink(TM)
package, which includes a high-speed, 16-bit Ethernet adapter plus software,
coverts the OmniBook to a workstation for Novell's NetWare and NetWare Lite,
Microsoft's LAN Manager and Windows for Workgroups, IBM's PC LAN, Banyan's
VINES and other popular networks. The SocketLink EA handles 10BaseT Ethernet
and the SocketLink EA+ handles both 10BaseT and 10Base2 Ethernet.

"SocketLink is an economical way to give the OmniBook a giant boost in
functionality and performance when communicating with other PCs," says Socket
president Mile Gifford. "We see SocketLink as a companion product to
Traveling Software's LapLink, which comes bundled with the OmniBook. It's the
nature of mobile computers  that your environment keeps changing. You run
LapLink when you want to talk to a PC which isn't attached to an Ethernet
network. You run SocketLink when you have access to an Ethernet connection.
Together, these two packages give the OmniBook super flexibility for wired
connectivity."

Gifford states that the most important difference between SocketLink and
LapLink in a LAN environment is the different physical interfaces used by
each product. "LapLink uses the OmniBook's built-in RS-232 serial port to
talk to other PCs. SocketLink uses the OmniBook's PCMCIA interface to
implement a full-scale Ethernet connection. This gives SocketLink a big edge
in connectivity and performance. Because SocketLink uses Ethernet instead of
a serial port, it transfers files over 10 times faster than LapLink.  And by
converting the OmniBook into a network node compatible with any popular
network operating systems, SocketLink opens the door to features which
LapLink can't provide, such as printer sharing, compatability with all e-mail
programs, and a true client/server architecture." All this comes at no cost
in DOS memory, a resource which many OmniBook users are eager to conserve.
"Since our Ethernet drivers are relatively small, OmniBook users end up with
more DOS memory available when using SocketLink than when they use LapLink,"
says Gifford.

The key to SocketLink's high performance is its use of the PCMCIA interface
which comes standard with the OmniBook. "The PCMCIA interface makes all this
possible," explains Gifford. "PCMCIA is an externally accessible 16-bit
memory and I/O interface with roughly the performance of the popular ISA bus
found in PC-AT computers. There's almost no limit to the connectivity you can
add to a mobile computer via PCMCIA. In fact, Socket also offers a high-speed
16550 serial port option and a Global Positioning System for the OmniBook
300, and we'll be announcing some important new products at COMDEX in
November. The OmniBook 300 is a great example of how manufacturers like HP
can harness loads of features simply by designing in the PCMCIA interface."

Founded in 1992, Socket Communications' mission is to design, manufacture and
market seamless connectivity products for mobile computers. Socket holds a
leadership position in the development of mobile I/O products, having
introduced the first PCMCIA Ethernet adapter, serial adapter and Global
Positioning System. Socket is a member of the PCMCIA LAN Working Group, as
well as the Working Groups for Socket and Card Services and for the 32-bit
Card Bus. Socket's designs stress cross-platform compatibility, as
exemplified by the Socket EA Ethernet adapter. This is the only PCMCIA LAN
adapter which works on all of the following platforms: PC notebooks including
the OmniBook 300, Elonex and Librex; the Commodore Amiga; and the AT&T EO.
Socket often works with corporate partners to adapt existing communications
technology to a variety of host platforms equipped with PCMCIA slots.

The manufacturer's suggested retail price for the 10BaseT-only product is
$399. The MSRP for the 10BaseT/10Base2 combination is $420. SocketLink is
available in the U.S. through Tech Data.

     stark@wc.cdrom.com

DESCRIPTION

     KeyBang is intended to provide a constructive means for young
     children to interact with your computer.  KeyBang is
     entertaining so it encourages children toward the computer.
     It also provides a secure barrier between children and
     computer data so parents can feel comfortable with this
     encouragement.

     KeyBang traps all mouse and keyboard input to your Amiga
     and responds with polygons, images and sounds.  The images
     and sounds are IFF ILBM and 8SVX files which you can create
     with most Amiga image and sound editors.  A large set of
     images and sounds are supplied with KeyBang.  KeyBang also
     reads special Multimedia files which allow its behavior to
     be programmed.  You can learn to program KeyBang yourself
     or use modules provided by KeyBang Software.

     Under AmigaDOS 2.0 and greater, KeyBang can be installed as
     a screen blanker to activate itself if you leave your Amiga
     unattended.  It can also be made to run in any available
     screen mode.

NEW FEATURES

     Version 1 of KeyBang was released as shareware just over a
     year ago.  It lacked the ability to display IFF ILBM images
     and to be installed as a screen blanker.  It also wasn't
     programmable with the special multimedia files.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     KeyBang is compatible with AmigaDOS 1.3 and higher.  Under
     1.3 it runs on PAL and NTSC machines.  Under AmigaDOS
     versions 2 and greater KeyBang can use any screenmode
     available on your system.  It can be installed on a hard
     disk (Which will make loading images and sounds much
     faster)

GETTING KeyBang VERSION 1

     KeyBang version 1 was uploaded to grind.isca.uiowa.edu
     The file name is /amiga/misc/KeyBang1.0.lzh

     KeyBang version 2 is currently only available from
     Walnut Creek CDROM.

PRICE

     $19.95 (US) including shipping.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     KeyBang version 2 is commercial.

OTHER

     Shareware donors for KeyBang version 1 will receive a free
     copy of KeyBang version 2.  As a consequence, shareware
     donations for KeyBang version 1 will no longer be accepted.
     Thank you to those of you who supported this project in its

ARN v1.03a AVAILABLE FOR FTP


TITLE

        Arn

VERSION

        V1.03a

AUTHOR

        Roland Bless
        rob@spirits.ka.sub.org
        Fax: +49 211 623818

DESCRIPTION

        Arn is a newsreader for USENET/UUCP messages to use with
        Amiga UUCP installations (CNews and derivates or AmigaUUCP D).

        Arn is a fast newsreader which allows you to select groups and
        articles individually. It uses small databases (~2% of newsvolume)
        for providing fast overviews over articles. It's simliar to the
        well known UN*X 'tin' and 'nn'-newsreader, but its no ported
        software.

        It offers much functionality to the user and is well configurable
        (runs with nearly all UUCP-installations). Especially when you have
        a lot of newsgroups and articles Arn is a good choice, because other
        newsreaders hold all their information in memory, but Arn tries to
        use as little as possible.
        Arn has a new scheme for managing newsgroups, which makes
        subscription and unsubscription easy (no annoying questions
        about subscription at beginning of a session).

        Arn is completely controlable via the keyboard. Intuition/mouse
        support is planned for further versions, but it has the advantage
        of working via serial ports.

        Features:

        * table overview over newsgroups and articles

        * selection of groups and articles of interest

        * five different article-overview display-modi
          - subject-threads in alphabetical order (within a thread 
            chronologically)
          - subject-threads in chronological order (within a thread 
            chronologically)
          - no threads, article sorted by date
          - compacted versions of the first two, which hide follow-ups

        * auto-selection and global/local kill-files

        * fast overview presentation of all articles by use of small
          databases

        * doesn't require much memory and is fast even with really many and
          large groups

        * configurable display of article-headers

        * built-in pager, recognizing extra long lines

        * full usage of screen sizes

        * multi-user support

        * works over the serial line (using termcap), too

        * rudimentary MIME support

NEW FEATURES

        Since the V1.03 there were some bugfixes:

        - fixed bug in time.c which produced empty Date:
        - fixed error msg when active-file was 0 bytes
        - fixed LF in moderators-mailaddress
        - fixed bug when pressing CTRL-C
        - no longer private Public-Screen (sorry for forgetting this)
        - fixed deallocation of memory in getconfig.c (some bytes were lost)
        + new option -s waits for a keypress after initialization
        + does 5 retries if it couldn't open database because it was in use
        - compiled under SAS/C 6.3
        - fixed bugs in ArnMaster which caused enforcer hits.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        Arn should work on any Amiga model with OS2.04 or higher.

        Naturally, UUCP software is required for getting news.
        This can be CNews, wCNews or AmigaUUCP 1.16D for example.
        CNews/wCNews have an advantage over AmigaUUCP by providing an
        "active"-file, which lets ArnMaster build its databases
        faster (no scanning for new articles needed).

16026.3.589.1 EMPLANT, Sound and the Picasso II!
9/3/93 19:16 19/1077 rmunoz

Hi All!

Well, just wanted to let you know that I am currently testing a version
of the EMPLANT software that provides SOUND support!  So far it is
incredible!  The games really come to LIFE!  I just got Arashi, a
Tempest clone, and this thing is INCREDIBLE!  And ofcourse, with my
Picasso II and the 4 Picasso video drivers, the speed of the Mac emulation
is incredible!  Once again, Jim and Joe have done an incredible job,
both with the sound support, the Picasso drivers and the overall emulation!
For those interested about the Picasso, you may want to drop by the
Picasso area (which I think is under construction) by 'go picasso'.  In
anycase, the usage of the Picasso is a very, very TRANSPARENT graphics
card from the point of view of the user!!! AWESOME card, which makes
my A3000 with EMPLANT just Amazing!  I believe that Jim Drew will be
showing the sound support at the WOC, and I am not sure if he is going to
release it before the show, since they are still working on it, but so
far it is GREAT!  Aah... What a difference the emulation makes now...

Call for Amiga Developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Silicon Prairie Software
2326 Francis Street
Regina, SK  S4N 2P7
Canada   (306) 352-0358

Silicon Prairie Software is seeking experienced Amiga programmers for
contract work.  Programmers will work remotely, so reliable Internet
access is a must.  Qualifications desired:

* Extensive Amiga C programming experience
* Detailed knowledge of Intuition, Exec, and DOS library
* Experience in operating systems programming
* Experience with GUI building tools such as GadToolsBox
* Experience in the development of consistent user interfaces
* Familiarity with the SAS C 6.3 development environment
* 680X0 experience is an asset
* A BA/BSc/MSc in Computer Science is an asset, but not required

Silicon Prairie is embarking on a new development project and requires
the services of 4-6 experienced Amiga programmers.  Since we are located
in Canada, we are seeking developers capable of working half/full-time
at their home locations.

The successful candidates will be given detailed specifications for
modules of the development project.  The developers will submit weekly
archives of the current local source tree for source code management
at the main office.

Interested parties should submit a summary of prior development experience
and qualifications.

Citation of currently available commercial or freely-distributable
programs is encouraged, although binary samples are declined unless
requested.

Email your inquiries to:  plummer@hercules.cs.uregina.ca

The "interview" process will intially consist of a programming problem
emailed to all candidates.  The submissions will be reviewed on the
basis of:

* Program Correctness
* Program Style
* Conformance to CBM's User Interface Guidelines
* Program Performance
* Prompt submission

All inquiries will be held in confidence.

/// Amiga Report Mailing List
    -------------------------


Are you tired of waiting for your local BBS or online service to get
Amiga Report each week?  Have you been spending more money that you want
on long distance phone calls to download it from one of our Distribution
Sites?  If so, have we got a deal for you!

If you have an internet mailing address, you can receive Amiga Report
in UUENCODED form each week as soon as the issue is released.  To be put
on the list, send Email to Amiga-Report-Request@gnu.ai.mit.edu.  Your
account must be able to handle mail of any size to ensure an intact copy.
For example, GEnie has a limit of about 40K per message, and most of our
issues are well over that limit.

Please do not send general Email to Amiga-Report-Request, only requests
for subscription additions or deletions (or if you are not receiving an
intact copy).  All other correspondence should be directed to the editor
at ROB_G@Delphi.COM.

Many thanks to Bob Caron for setting this service up for us!

P.S.:  Please be sure to include your Email address in the text of your
request message, it makes adding it to the list much easier.  Thanks!

** IMPORTANT NOTICE:  PLEASE be certain your host can accept mail over
** 100K!  We have had a lot of bouncebacks recently from systems with a
** 100K size limit for incoming mail.  If we get a bounceback with your
** address in it, it will be removed from the list immediately.  If it
** persists, we will discontinue the internet mailing list.

/// Amiga Report Available via the World Wide Web!
    ----------------------------------------------
    By Michael Witbrock
    (mjw@cs.cmu.ed or witbrock@x25.bix.com)


Although AmigaGuide is still the best way to browse Amiga Report, the
magazine is  now also available in a form which may be more convenient for
people with direct Internet access.

Amiga Report is being converted weekly to a document readable via the World
Wide Web, allowing immediate access without the chore of dearchiving and
downloading to an Amiga.  Within a day (often less) of its release, each
Amiga Report starting from AR118 will be  converted into an HTML hyper-
document that behaves as similarly as possible to the AmigaGuide version,
and will be made available at this URL:

<a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/People/mjw/Computer/Amiga/OnlineMags.htm
l">
OnlineMags
</a>

For those who don't recognize that, a URL is a Uniform Resource Locator,
which specifies access method and location information for information
readable with WWW browsers such as NCSA mosaic. NCSA mosaic is a self
contained program running under the X window system, and is  available
for anonymous FTP from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in directory /Mosaic.

Even if you don't plan to read AmigaReport by this means, I strongly
recommend that you get a copy of NCSA mosaic and play with it. The
amount of information (in the form of pictures, sounds, text, and mpeg
movies) it makes easily available is astounding, and the program itself
is a marvel of good user interface design. I hope that someone will use
the recent attempts at PD TCP/IP networking solutions and port the
program to the Amiga.

Happy browsing!

It has come to our attention that some copies of PC-Task may be infected
with a Virus, the EmWorm virus. It is recommended that you run Virus-
Interceptor v1.11 or greater, while using PC-Task to detect if your
version is infected. 
  
However because of the lack of information on this infection, 
you are using PC-Task at YOUR OWN RISK.   
 
Virus-Interceptor v1.11 - v1.14 is available in the AMIGA Safe Hex
file Areas On Both SHI Regional centers and SHI Superkillers disks.
  
It runs only under Workbench 2.0 or higher.    
 
        We will inform you as more information becomes available. 

                                Thank you,

 The end of Virus_Checker is very near at hand. 
   
 Why???? 
   
Simply because no one is sending any viruses to me and/or any support. 
Its no use me updating Virus_Checker all the time when there is nothing
to add. I have not seen any virus sent to me in over 3 months, except
what I get from SHI.  Even after repeated requests for the F??K virus I 
still have not seen it. 
   
Its no use sending all the viruses to SHI  as they do not seem to be 
receiving that many, and by the time they get it and then send it to me
it is long after the virus has been around. 
  
So this is fair warning about the fate of Virus_Checker. Make sure
this message gets around. 
   
 --cut-- 
   
I think we should all let John Veldthuis know we all appreciate his
efforts.

/// Portal:  A Great Place For Amiga Users
    --------------------------------------



                   Portal Communications' Amiga Zone

         The AFFORDABLE alternative for online Amiga information
         -------------------------------------------------------

The Portal Online System is the home of acclaimed Amiga Zone, which was
formerly on the People/Link System.  Plink went out of business in May,
1991 and The Amiga Zone's staff moved to Portal the next day. The Zone has
just celebrated its second anniversary on Portal. The Amiga press raves
about The Amiga Zone, when compared to its competition.

If you live in the San Jose, CA area, then you can dial Portal directly. If
you live elsewhere, you can reach Portal through any SprintNet (formerly
Telenet) indial anywhere in the USA or through Tymnet from anywhere in
North America.  If you have an account on another Internet-connected
system, you can connect to Portal using the UNIX Telnet programs, from
anywhere in the industrialized world.  Delphi and BIX users can now Telnet
into Portal for a flat $19.95 a month, with *unlimited* use.

Some of Portal/Amiga Zone's amazing features include:

 - Over 1.5 GIGabytes of Amiga-specific files, online, 24 hours a day.
   Portal has dedicated a 2.5 GIGabyte disk drive to the Amiga Zone.
   We have virtually unlimited space for files and new uploads. 

 - The *entire* Fred Fish collection of freely distributable
   software, online.  All of it.  Every disk.  Well-organized so
   it's easy to find exactly what you're after.

 - Fast, Batch Zmodem file transfer protocol. Download up to 100 files at
   once, of any size, with one command. 

 - Twenty Amiga vendor areas with participants like AmigaWorld, ASDG,
   Soft-Logik, Black Belt, Apex Publishing, Stylus, Prolific, NES,
   and many others including Compute's Amiga Resource with over
   4 Megabytes of exclusive Compute magazine disk stuff you won't find
   elsewhere.

 - 35 "regular" Amiga libraries with thousands of files.  Hot new
   stuff arrives daily.  Since Portal has FTP connections we can get
   new freely-distributable software online within MINUTES of its 
   being announced on Usenet.

 - No upload/download "ratios" EVER. Download as much as you want, as
   often as you want, and never feel pressued doing it.  Start downloading
   files with your first session on Portal. 

 - Live, interactive nightly chats with Amiga folks whose names you
   will recognize.  Special conferences.  Random chance prize contests.
   Famous Amiga folks aren't the exception on Portal, they're the norm.
   Instead of stumbling around in frustration you can talk to the
   people who design your hardware, who write your software.

 - Vast Message bases where you can ask questions about *anything*
   Amiga related and get quick replies from the experts.

 - Amiga Internet mailing lists for Imagine, DCTV, LightWave, HyperAmi,
   Director and Landscapes are fed right into the Zone message bases.
   Read months worth of postings.  They don't scroll off, ever!
   No need to clutter your mailbox with them.

 - FREE unlimited Internet Email.  Your Portal account gets you a
   mailbox that's connected to the world.  Send letters of any length to 
   computer users in the entire industrialized world.  No limits. 
   No extra charges. No kidding!
   
 - Portal has the Usenet.  Thousands of "newsgroups" in which
   you can read and post articles about virtually any subject you can
   possibly imagine.  Usenet feeds into Portal many times each hour.
   There are 14 Amiga-specific Usenet newsgroups with hundreds of
   articles posted every day, including postings by Commodore 
   personnel.  Since Usenet is distributed worldwide, your questions
   and answers can be seen by literally hundreds of thousands of
   people the same day you post them.  

 - Other Portal SIGs (Special Interest Groups) online for Mac, IBM, Sun,
   NeXT, UNIX, Science Fiction, Writers, amateur radio, and a graphics
   SIG with thousands of GIF files to name just a few.  ALL Portal SIGs
   are accessible to ALL Portal customers with NO surcharges ever.

 - The entire UPI/Clarinet/Newsbytes news hierarchy ($4/month extra)
   An entire general interest newspaper and computer news magazine.
 
 - Portal featues an exciting package of Internet features: IRC, FTP,
   TELNET, MUDS, LIBS.  Free to all Portal customers with your account.
   Internet Services is a menu driven version of the same kinds of 
   utilities you can also use from your Portal UNIX shell account.
 
 - All the files you can FTP. All the chatting you can stand on the IRC.  
   And on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) you can talk live, in real time 
   with Amiga users in the U.K., Europe, Australia, the Far East, 
   24 hours a day. 

 - Our exclusive PortalX by Steve Tibbett, the graphical "front end"
   for Portal which will let you automatically click'n'download your
   waiting email, messages, Usenet groups and binary files!  Reply to mail
   and messages offline using your favorite editor and your replies are
   sent automatically the next time you log into Portal.
   (PortalX requires Workbench 2.04 or higher)

 - And Portal does NOT stick it to high speed modem users. Whether
   you log in at 1200 or 2400 or 9600 or 14.4K you pay the same low 
   price.

How does all that sound?  Probably too good to be true. Well, it IS true.

# PCPursuit is a service of US Sprint. Portal is a PCPursuit
 "Direct Access Facility" thus connection to Portal with a PCP account
 is simply a matter of entering C PORTAL,PCP-ID,PCP-PASSWORD  at the
 SprintNet login prompt instead of C PORTAL. 

Note: 

   Portal Direct 9600/14400 bps service is availble for both USR HST
   modems, and any V32/V32.bis modems. There are dozens of direct-dial
   high speed lines into Portal.  No busy signals!

   SprintNet 9600bps service is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Tymnet 9600bps services is V.32 modem protocol only.
   Again, Portal does NOT surcharge high speed modem users!

   Portal subscribers who already have an account on an Internet-capable
   system elsewhere, can use that system's "telnet" program
   to connect to Portal for $0.00 an hour. That's right ZERO. From anywhere
   in the world.  If you're in this category, be sure to ask the Portal 
   reps, when you signup, how to login to Portal from your existing
   Internet account.  

Call and join today.  Tell the friendly Portal Customer Service
representative, "The Amiga Zone and Amiga Report sent me!"

[Editor's Note:  Be sure to tell them that you are an Amiga user, so
they can notify the AmigaZone sysops to send their Welcome Letter and
other information!]

That number again:  408-973-9111.

3.8 MB.  The game works just fine with OS 2.04.  While it is possible to play
Dune II on a "basic" 68000 system, a faster CPU is highly recommended.


COPY PROTECTION

        Dune II features an infrequent "look up a fact in the manual"
check.  The five installation disks are not copy protected, so you can back
them up if you feel the need for additional security.  I think this kind of
copy protection is acceptable.


MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

        I am playing Dune II on an A2500/030 running OS 2.04, using a GVP
Series II host adapter.  The machine features 1 MB of Chip RAM, 4 MB of
32-bit RAM, and 2 MB of 16-Bit Fast RAM.


REVIEW

        Somewhere in time and space lies the planet Arrakis, also known as
"Dune."  It's surface is a gigantic desert, inhabited only by the "fremen"
and the ferocious sand worms.  And yet it is of vital interest to the Empire,
because it is the only known source of the spice Melange, a drug with truly
wondrous powers.

        The scenario starts out with the Emperor in dire need of great
quantities of spice.  In order to increase the harvesting, he offers a
contest to the three most powerful families on Dune:  the family who
produces the largest quantity of Melange will be given exclusive harvesting
rights.  So the righteous Atreides, the cunning Ordos and the treacherous
Harkonnen get down to battle it out among themselves.

        You play the role as Chief of Staff for one of the three houses of
Dune, bound to win nine battles in a war for total domination of the
planet.  Each house offers its own specialised units, and also represents a
different level of difficulty.

        Each battle starts out with a short briefing by your advisor, after
which you get to the main game screen.  It consists of a large map area,
with a command box to the right.  Just below the command box is a small
radar screen that can display an overview of whole playfield.  From two
sort-of menus at the top of the screen, you can get help about the game.  An
option window allows you to load and save games, set game speed, and such.

        Scattered around the map are your buildings, vehicles and soldiers -
usually called "units" in that genre.  You command those units by clicking on
them to activate them, and then selecting an action from the command box.
Depending on the type of the unit, your choices vary.  For example, to
create buildings you instruct your construction facility to do so.  Step by
step, you build up your base complete with factories for armored vehicles,
power generators, and perimeter defenses.  Most vital of all are the spice
refineries, because only by harvesting spice and processing it can you gain
the money necessary to build up your outpost.  Once you feel up to it - or
whenever your opponent feels up to it - the battle starts.  Dune II features
an impressive array of mobile and stationary weaponry that can be put to
good use.

        Orchestrating a battle on Dune can be much fun, but it also takes up
a lot of time.  While the earlier conquests can usually be handled in a few
minutes, they get rapidly more and more taxing while the game progresses.
Also, between conquests, there's a tactical map display that lets you select
your next battle, so there are 66 scenarios in all to explore.  And the
ending?  After having finished the last battle, you find yourself in disgrace
with the Emperor - so the battle will possibly continue in one or several
Dune II Data Disks.

        Like the original Dune game, the graphic presentation is quite
convincing.  While the game itself doesn't depend solely on its graphics,
they certainly enhance the gameplay.

        The sound effects accompanying the game are nice, but probably
nothing to write home about.  Basically, it's atmospheric background
music interspersed with "action" sounds like shells going off, and unit
commanders responding with "operation complete" and such.  Maybe they've
gone a bit too far by letting soldiers die screaming when you hit them with
a truck....

        Overall, the game control is very intuitive, so you can get right
down to playing once you have understood the basics of the game.  Since each
level of the game offers more and more hardware to play with, the fight for
supremacy on Dune never gets dull.  Your computer opponent isn't too smart,
but he's got some quite effective offensive maneuvers up his sleeve.
However, at no level the computer player exposes the same cunning as an
expert human player would do.


DOCUMENTATION

        Dune comes with a nicely designed 56-page A5 booklet containing
basic instructions for the game as well as some "background" information
on the political situation on Arrakis.  A thorough description of the
different units in the game serves as base for the protection lookup.

        The Amiga version also includes a "quick start" leaflet with
instructions on how to install the game.  While this is rather short, I
found the information presented to be sufficient.


LIKES AND DISLIKES

        I would like to see a version of Dune II that allows two or more
players to engage in head to head combat via modem or (even better!)
network.  However, I don't expect to see this any time in the near future:
the additional effort in programming couldn't possibly be offset by extra
sales.

        While I have no conclusive information as to the state of things
concerning Dune II Data Disks, I have heard such disks are already available
for the IBM PC.  I'd just love to see them on Amiga, too.

        Last but not least, I have to congratulate Virgin on publishing a
great game with a reasonable price tag! I hope users all around will catch
on and make their experiment worthwhile.


BUGS

        What I really hate about Dune is the fact that the game grabs its
input directly from the hardware, no matter if its screen is currently
active or not.  Basically, this prevents you from using multitasking for
anything else but batch jobs.


VENDOR SUPPORT

        Virgin offer customer support for exchange of defective media and
such.


WARRANTY

        Virgin does not offer any kind of warranty except as such provided
by local law.


CONCLUSIONS

        Dune II is certainly a very good game, and possibly a bargain at the
price asked.  If you like playable strategy games, this one's for you.  With
Data Disks coming out, I feel it's got a great long time value.  I rate it
4 stars out of 5.

/// Usenet Mini-Review:  DPS Personal Animation Recorder
    ----------------------------------------------------
    By Michael B. Comet
    (mbc@po.cwru.edu)



        Hello to all in Renderland!  I have just gotten my DPS PAR a couple
days ago. Since I know others who read this are thinking of getting one, I
thought I'd post my view of it.  I will try to keep if brief.  I am not
affiliated with DPS.


MANUAL AND INTERFACE

        The manual is very good, and is nice and compact.  The user interface
is equally friendly and has the look of a traditional VTR for playback.  The
software takes up very little room on the standard amiga drive, though it
requires at least 1 Meg of RAM to run at all times.


STILLS AND ANIMATION PLAYBACK

        In my Amiga 3000/25 with the recommended Seagate 500 Meg drive, I
obtained true 30fps playback.  Very smooth, very good quality.  I have heard
that there are problems playing back at slower speeds, though I haven't
encountered that.  You can also drag the frame bar back and forth and move
one frame at a time with a mouse click.  Using the latter -- i.e, Rewind and
Fast Forward -- the frames actually go by faster than 30 fps!

        Those that use AREXX will be happy to know that the software has and
AREXX port so you can sequence playback and so on using it.

        The quality at the highest level Q23 is essentially identical (to me)
to the original image.  For stills, the storage benefits alone are
remarkable.  For animations, the program sets the Q level for you.  I have
seen it work at around 19 to 14 depending on the image.  14 is pretty
acceptable for video using both composite and SVHS (sorry, I can't test
MII/Betacam output).  However, JPEG type artifacting is still slightly
noticeable.  The NTSC composite output is very good, and the SVHS was almost
identical to the RGB from my Firecracker board.


DEFICIENCIES

        There are not really too many deficiencies in the device.  However
there are some things that are important to know.  One item is that
animations, while they can be looped on playback, do not loop without a
pause.  That is, if you have a 30 frame anim and play it, there will be
about a 1/2 second pause on the last frame.  To do a perfect pause-free loop
you must append the animation to itself some number of times.  The software
can do this quite easily so it is not really a problem, though more drive
space gets eaten this way.

        Also relating to projects, there seems to be no way in the software
to rename projects.  Also, with merging of animations in different projects,
I have not been able to find a way to splice together anims from the
different subdirectories.

        Playback speed is normally 30fps; however there is a button to select
slow playback.  As far as I can tell, you can set it only to preset values:
from 30fps to 15fps, then 7.5fps, and some more down lower.  I would like to
see user adjustable settings here.


OVERALL

        In all I have to say the PAR is great for 24 bit animations. There
is no longer any hassle of single framing with tape, etc., and it enables
the animator to view the anim easily and cut, paste, splice and mutilate
anims into a final piece.  It also has great capacity for still frame
storage.

        One really great thing is that everything happens with just the
click of a button.  No longer do you have to wait to decompress JPEG images
to show as stills.  No longer do you have to wait to load up animations.
Just click on a still frame and it appears on the output.  Click on an
animation, and the first frame is shown.  Hit play and it goes.  Really nice.

        For those looking for a single frames alternative at a reasonable
price, this is a great product.

/// BIX - Byte Information Exchange             Lots of information!
    -------------------------------


BIX is the premier online service for computing professionals and enthusiasts.
While other online services cater to computer novices, BIX is the place for 
knowledgeable people to go for answers to tough questions.  You're likely 
to find many others in similar situations who can offer advice, give 
technical assistance, or point you in the right direction.

BIX is divided into areas called conferences, each devoted to a 
particular area of interest.  They range from algorithms to windows,
from writers to amiga.  Conferences are categorized into groups,
usually referred to as exchanges, so that you can browse through
whatever groups interest you and see a list of the conferences it 
contains.

These are some of the exchanges on BIX:

amiga.exchange - the place for Amiga developers and enthusiasts
byte - the full text of each issue of BYTE magazine; source code too 
e.and.l - Entertainment and Leisure; music, pets, games, more
ibm.exchange - everything from OS/2 to PC clones
mac.exchange -  Mac news, support, software, advice
professionals - consultants, engineers, financiers gather here
programmers - some of the best brains in the business!
wix - the Information Exchange for Windows; Windows Magazine online
writers.ex - the professional and amateur writer's exchange


************FULL INTERNET ACCESS!************

BIX also features access to the Internet - you can use FTP to transfer
files from sites all over the world, telnet to log on to other online 
services, schools, and research sites, and send Internet mail to millions 
of people at services like DELPHI, CompuServe, America Online, MCI Mail, 
and other sites and services.  Services like "WHOIS" and "Finger" are 
also available, with more features on the way (like USENET newsgroups; 
our newsreader is currently being tested and should be available very 
soon!)  There are no usage fees or special charges for Internet access - 
it's all part of your BIX subscription.

 - Hard Drives from Hell?

   Look for some new NINE GIGABYTE hard drives to debut at Comdex in
   November.  They are likely to be 3.5" units in fact.  Guess that
   fancy 250 meg tape backup is going to seem pretty small now, huh?

 - Micropolis' super-size IDE hard drive

   Meanwhile, Micropolis is shipping a new 1.2 GIGABYE 3.5" IDE drive.
   Reports say that it is faster than the company's own SCSI drive of
   the same size.

 - IDE Expanding

   Western Digital is reported to be coming out with a new IDE specification
   that will allow more than two devices.

"I have SOLID information that Windows NT will be distributed in chain
letter form.  Within 60 days you will receive a letter containing a list
of names and addresses, along with instructions to write 10 lines of C
code and send them to the address at the top of the list, before you add
your name at the bottom and mail copies to 84 of your friends.  Having
done that, you will simply sit back and wait a few weeks to receive
12.5 million lines of NT source code, which you will then compile and
link to form your NT system."

Our machine is a 386/33 with 20MB of memory, 1GB harddisk and upcoming
CD-ROM drive. The BBS software is a Norwegian origin MBBS running in
a DesqView window. 

We have over 6000 files online (no CD-ROM yet) containing titles for PC
and Amiga or both like GIF-pictures, music-modules and text-files. The
upload/download ratio is a very lousy 1:100.  (i.e. you upload a 20k file
and may download 2MB).

Messages are mainly written in Finnish, but English is widely used by
Swedish-speaking and international callers.

Download-access will be granted when asked. Also Amiga-areas are available
for those who will need them to avoid 'wars' between PC and Amiga users.
Access to sex pictures and stories are only for persons over 18 years
and given when requested.

Every user has an access to download filelist (LAHOFIL.ZIP), list of
Finnish 24-hour BBS's (BBSLIST.ZIP or BBSLIST.LHA) and every issue of
the Amiga Report Magazine (AR101.LHA-AR1??.LHA) on their first call.

The system is 4.5 years old and sponsored by the local telephone company,
Vaasan Laanin Puhelin Oy.
