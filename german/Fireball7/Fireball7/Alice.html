<h3>It was a beautiful summer day. Alice and her sister Emily were sitting under a
tree. They were the most beautiful girls in the whole country. Alice was the
most beautiful girl, and Emily was the second most beautiful girl. Both girls
had their most beautiful dresses on. Emily was reading a book of erotic romance
novels, but Alice was just dreaming of boys licking her bare breasts.
  Suddenly Alice spotted a white rabbit with clothes on. It was holding a watch
and shouting "I'm late, I'm late!" Alice thought this most peculiar and began
running after the rabbit. Alice had trouble running in her most beautiful
high-heeled shoes, but she valued beauty over agility and decided not to remove
her shoes. Suddenly the rabbit disappeared into a rabbit hole. Alice went after
it, being careful not to get her most beautiful dress dirty.<p>

Suddenly the ground gave way under Alice's knees. She was falling freely down
the rabbit hole until her dress burst into a parachute. As the air tickled
Alice's legs she remembered she had forgotten to put any underpants on. She
thought it wouldn't matter. Alice landed in a beautiful ballroom decorated with
pictures of naked girls that Alice greedily inspected.
  The room featured a table with lovely little cookies on it. Alice picked up
one which was heart-shaped and had pink sugar dressing on. Alice licked the
dressing and shrunk down to tiny size. Now she noticed a door in the wall, no
bigger than her foot when she was at her normal size. Not knowing how to open
the door, Alice gently kissed the doorknob. The door began to talk.
  "Not enough", the door said, "To open me you have to both kiss my knob and
open me with the key." "Key? What key?" asked Alice. "The one on the table",
said the door. Just as Alice was thinking of how to acquire the key, she
noticed that a certain liquid as dripping onto her breasts from a bottle on the
table. Alice licked a drop of the liquid, which tasted like syrup, and began to
grow.
  Alice grew so big she filled the whole room. She was sure she now wouldn't be
able to open the door, let alone pass it. Then she began to cry. Tears rolled
from her face onto her lovely breasts, then onto her delicate legs, then onto
the floor. Alice cried so much that she caused a flood which caused the door to
give way under the water pressure and herself to be drained out of the door.<p>

As Alice was floating in the water, she bumped into a bottle and ended up
inside it. Alice sailed in the bottle until she landed and crawled out of the
bottle. She then noticed curious figures dancing in a ring. They were very wet
like Alice, but they were dancing to get dry. Their leader Dodo grasped Alice
by the arm and pulled her to dance with them. The waves washed the dancers
which wettened and wettened instead of drying, but Alice was the only one to
notice this. She left the others.
  As Alice ran inland her wet dress was gluing itself to her body. Her hair was
all wet and her hairstyle was ruined. Alice soon found a road, so she stopped
running and began walking along the road. She found a small jewelled comb which
she picked up. Then she combed her wet hair back to normal state. Alice liked
the comb, so she put it in her shirt pocket. While doing so, Alice's fingers
brushed her breasts and she remembered she had forgotten to put a bra on. She
thought it wouldn't matter.<p>

While walking along the road, Alice was greeted by two boys. She curtseyed
prettily to them and introduced herself. The boys pinched her breasts and
introduced themselves. Their names were Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Alice
curtseyed prettily again and bid the boys farewell. The boys pinched her
breasts and said "Not so fast, little lady! You must hear our story first." So
they pinched her breasts and began to tell the story. The story was a long
erotic romance story. After the boys pinched her breasts she was sweating of
passion. She then thought it would be best to leave. She curtseyed prettily and
resumed walking along the road.
  The road took Alice to the white rabbit's house. The white rabbit was
shouting to her: "Marian, come here and get your swimming suit!" Alice went to
the rabbit to tell him her name wasn't Marian. The rabbit grasped Alice by the
arm and shoved her inside, shouting "Your swimming suit is upstairs, Marian. Go
get it!" Alice felt she'd better obey the rabbit, so she went upstairs.
  She opened the drawer in which the rabbit kept girls' swimming suits. As she
did so Alice fell silent because of the sheer beauty of the swimming suit she
discovered. It was the most beautiful swimming suit she had ever seen. It was
made of rubber which made it strong and flexible, yet it was light as a
feather. Alice would have left herself staring at the swimming suit forever if
the rabbit hadn't shouted her to hurry up. She decided to put on the swimming
suit. To do so, she stripped herself naked. As the room was small, she could
only do so in front of the open window.
  Then, she put on the swimming suit. It was so tight she barely managed to
pull it all the way up her body, but she finally did it. Then she hurriedly put
on her dress over the swimming suit. Alice was just beginning to leave as she
found a cookie in the drawer. She licked its dressing and grew so much she
filled the whole house. Her delicate legs sprang out of the doors. Her pretty
arms sprang out of the windows. And her lovely head popped out of the chimney.
  The rabbit thought Alice was a monster and asked his friends Dodo and Bill
the Lizard to help him get it out. Bill had climbed up to the roof and was
about to smoke Alice out as some liquid began dropping from a bottle in his
pocket down onto Alice's tender breasts. Alice licked a drop of the liquid and
shrank down to her normal size. She quickly ran out of the house, not having
time to think that she had stolen the white rabbit's swimming suit.<p>

As Alice soon began walking again, she came upon a tea party. Three peculiar
creatures, a Funny Hare, a Mad Hatter and a Dormouse were having an unbirthday
party. "No more room, even for such a beautiful girl as you!" they shouted to
Alice as they noticed her. "But today is my unbirthday too", she said. "In that
case," said the Hare, "you can join the party, because you're such a beautiful
girl too!"
  Alice took a place between the Hare and the Hatter. "Some tea, perhaps?" the
Hatter asked her, spilling tea onto her breasts. Alice's question whether it
would be better to serve tea in cups instead of pouring it over girls' breasts
was unnoticed. The party was suddenly interrupted by the white rabbit, who was,
as usual, shouting "I'm late, I'm late!" Then the Hare quickly took the
rabbit's watch and said it had stopped. To fix it he opened it and spread
strawberry marmalade inside it. The clock didn't resume working.
  Then Alice snapped the clock from the Hare's hand. She kissed it gently. It
didn't work. Then Alice licked the marmalade from inside it and kissed it
again, this time with love. The clock resumed working, so Alice gave it back to
the rabbit, who quickly sprang away. "More tea?" asked the Hatter, pouring tea
onto her breasts. Alice thought it best to leave.<p>

As Alice was walking along the road she ended up in a royal palace. She found
little card soldiers painting white roses pink. She asked them why they were
doing so. The soldiers said: "We had bought some white roses and then found out
that the Queen hates white roses. Normally we would be painting them red, but
today the Queen is going to sentence a beautiful girl, so we are painting them
pink." "What's the poor girl accused of?" asked Alice. "Nobody knows," replied
the soldiers, "perhaps she just happened to be more beautiful than the Queen."
  The Queen appeared and invited Alice to the trial. Alice took a place in the
audience gallery. "Bring in the accused!" the Queen shouted. Two sturdy card
soldiers escorted the girl to the courtroom. Alice fell silent because of her
sheer beauty. She was the most beautiful girl Alice had ever seen, and she had
a lovely red dress on. She was chained and gagged, and seemed to have accepted
her fate. Alice fell in love with her instantly.
  "Now for the judgement!" the Queen shouted. She stated that the girl was to
be stripped naked and imprisoned in her jail cell forever. And so was it. Alice
got up to protest about the Queen's judgement system. To emphasize herself, she
licked the two cookies she had taken from the tea party. She knew one would
enlarge her and the other would shrink her, but she had no time to ponder which
would be which.
  As Alice licked the cookies she grew so tall she almost filled the whole
courtroom. Taking advantage of that, she began viciously protesting about the
Queen's judgement system. As she was doing so, she shrank down to her normal
size. The Queen took advantage of that, and sentenced Alice. "Off with her
clothes!" she shouted.<p>

Alice quickly left the palace. She ran madly along the road, with the card
soldiers following close behind her, some even ripping pieces of her dress.
Then she heard her sister's voice.
  "Wake up, Alice!" Emily was shouting while she gently rubbed Alice's breasts.
Alice soon awoke. She thought it had just been a dream. For fun, she put her
hand inside her collar and touched her breasts. As she did so, she found out
that she was wearing the lovely swimming suit she had stolen from the white
rabbit's house. It hadn't all been a dream, she thought. But being a clever
girl, she didn't mention it to Emily.<p>

The girls' mother appeared. "Alice and Emily, I've got great news for you!" she
said. "I have sold you as slaves. The boy who now owns you will soon be
appearing here. Since you are the most beautiful girls in the country, he has
paid a large sum of money, which I'll be keeping all of to myself. You won't be
getting a penny. Isn't it great?" "Yes, it is!" shouted Alice and Emily. They
had always secretly wanted to be sold as slaves, and now their wish was
fulfilled.
  The boy then appeared, and took Alice and Emily with him. Before they left,
the boy chained and gagged the girls. The boy escorted his girls to his home.
There Alice was very surprised. In front of her stood the very girl that had
appeared in the Queen's courtroom. She had her red dress on, and was chained
and gagged.
  Alice asked her owner who the girl was. "Oh, this girl," said the boy,
rubbing the girl's breasts, "this is Angelica, my slave. Her mother sold her to
me as a slave just as your mother sold you to me a slaves. The list says she is
the third most beautiful girl in the country. Now that I have the second most
beautiful girl and the most beautiful girl as well as her, I truly am the
luckiest boy ever!"
  Then the boy commanded Alice, Emily and Angelica to work, which they
immediately started doing. Alice, Emily and Angelica devoted their lives to
service and cherish the boy and lived happily ever after.<h3><p>
