<LI>FT:<B> Please tell us something about yourself and RamJam Consultants
     Ltd.  What  have  you  done before getting in touch with Opera
     Software?</B>
<P>
<LI><B>TC:</B>I'm a software engineer with 17 years  industrial  experience.
     I've  worked  in  a  variety of positions, from programming to
     project management, mostly specialising in the development  of
     compilers  and  related  tools.  A  little  over 5 years ago I
     established Ramjam Consultants in order to allow me to do more
     of  the things I enjoy, and less of the administration that is
     necessary in the large companies I used to work for.
<P>
     I've been a keen Amiga user since the A500 was released in the
     UK.  Until  Commodore's  collapse,  I  was  a registered Amiga
     developer. I still use Amigas  to  run  Ramjam  -  we  have  a
     ethernet network of 3 A3000s, and an A4000.
<P>
     When I needed parts to keep our A3000s running,  I  discovered
     that  it was hard to find suppliers. I was so impressed at the
     AmiFAST 3000 ZIP-to-SIMM adapter that I  decided  that  Ramjam
     should  sell  this  in Europe. We also sell a few other items,
     but our main business is in software development.
<P>
     We started "adopting" good orphaned Amiga freeware a couple of
     years  ago,  and we support programs such as tcpdl - a program
     that can download web sites very quickly.
<P>
     When I saw Opera I  immediately  thought  what  a  good  Amiga
     application it would make, and I wanted Ramjam to do the port.
<P>
<LI>FT:<B>How did you get in touch with Opera Software?</B>
<P>
<LI><B>TC:</B>Initially I just e-mailed them. Since then I've been  to  Oslo
     to talk face to face with them.
<P>
<LI>FT:<B>  Will Opera Amiga  have  full  functionality  compared  to  the
     original Opera for Windows(e.g. Realaudio, Javascript, Java(in
     V4))?</B>
<P>
<LI><B>TC:</B>  Javascript certainly. We're aiming to have  the  functionality
     as  close  as possible to the W95 Opera, but there may be some
     licencing issues to be resolved for some things - these  often
     take longer than the technical work.<BR>
<P>
     We'd very much like to port V4, but we have  to  get  V3  done
     first!
<P>
<LI>FT:<B>Will you use MUI for the Opera GUI?</B>
<P>
<LI><B>TC:</B>No. The choice of GUIs is something  that  divides  the  Amiga
     community.  Not  everybody  likes MUI, and it is also a little
     resource hungry. We're basing the interface on gtlayout,  with
     some  custom  extensions.  It  gives a good compromise between
     speed, size, and appearance.
<P>
<LI>FT:<B>There are already three fine browsers available for the Amiga.
     Do you think Opera has a real chance in the Amiga market?</B>
<P>
<LI><B>TC:</B>  I like the existing Amiga browsers, but they  are  weak  in  a
     couple of important areas<BR>
     1) stability - whan you run a business on your Amiga you can't
        afford to have it crash when you're browsing.<BR>
     2) yesterday's features  -  since  the development  teams  are
        small (often 1 person working in their spare time) there is
        no  way  that  the  existing browsers  can incorporate  new
        features as fast as they arise.
<P>
<LI>FT:<B>Which  features does Opera offer,  which no other Amiga Browser
     has?</B>
<P>
<LI><B>TC:</B>I think that the really important feature is the size  of  the
     development  team.  With  a large team developing Opera, and a
     team of 4 working part time just to port it to the Amiga,  new
     features should arrive on the Amiga much sooner.
<P>
     Of course, having Opera available on  a  number  of  different
     platforms will be an advantage too, especially for people that
     need to use other machines.
<P>
<LI>FT: <B> When will Opera Amiga be released?</B>
<P>
     The official date is December - although the exact  date  will
     be  determined by Opera Software. There will be updates on the
     Project Magic web pages whenever there is any news.
<P>
<LI>FT:<B>  How much will Opera Amiga cost?</B>
<P>
<LI><B>TC:</B>Again, that's up to Opera Software to decide, but  I'd  expect
     it  to  be around the same price as Opera currently sells for,
     i.e. $35.
<P>
<LI>FT:<B>  Will there be a PPC version  of  Opera  Amiga(e.g.  for  image
     decoding)?</B>
<P>
<LI><B>TC:</B>  We'd like that, but we'll have to see  how  development  goes.
     Also,  the  PPC  user  base  is  still very small (around 4000
     users) so we'd have to be careful about the effort we expend.
<P>
<LI>FT:<B>  What is your opinion on the Amiga OS 4.0 developer machine? Is
     this an interesting perspective for you?</B>
<P>
<LI><B>TC:</B>  Absolutely. Although of course it is only a bridge to the even
     more exciting OS 5.0 machines!
<P>
<LI>FT:<B>  What is your opinion on the future plans of Amiga Inc.? How do
     their  plans  influence  your plans on future developments for
     the Amiga?</B>
<P>
<LI><B>TC:</B>I must admit  the  announcement  at  WoA  wasn't  what  I  was
     expecting. However, I think that AI's plans are very exciting,
     and I don't think everyone has realised the  impact  that  the
     new  generation  of  Amigas could have in 18 months. We're now
     even more determined to increase the Amiga  developments  that
     we're involved in over the next year or two.
<P>
<LI>FT:<B>Thank you for answering our questions.</B></UL>
