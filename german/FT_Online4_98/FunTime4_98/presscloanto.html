<B>CLOANTO RELEASES PERSONAL PAINT 6.4 AS A FREE GIFT TO THE AMIGA
COMMUNITY, ANNOUNCES DEVELOPMENT OF VERSION 8</B>
<P>
In the evolution of Personal Paint, which has become the leading title
for editing palette-based graphics, version 6.4 represents a milestone
in new features, reliability, diffusion and new code written. In
hindsight, it might have deserved a version number of "7" (just as the
features introduced in the latest version might have justified an "8"
release, instead of the more humble 7.1). The particular release of
Personal Paint 6.4 now on Aminet (biz/cloan directory, PPaint64.lha
archive, easy access from <A HREF="http://www.cloanto.com/amiga/download.html">(http://www.cloanto.com/amiga/download.html)</A> is
little more than 18 months old, and includes support for anim-brushes
and ARexx, which were not supported by the first 6.4 release (also
bundled with some Amiga computers).
<P>
With few exceptions, such as the lack of full documentation and no
support for file formats such as GIF (which is included only with the
commercial package, under license of Unisys Corporation), this is the
full retail version of Personal Paint 6.4, including 20 different user
interface languages. Additional information on the distribution is
contained in the archive, as is a special upgrade offer to the latest
version 7.1. The version of Personal Paint 6.4 now released for free
download is not a demonstration version, but is fully functional, and
may be used without limitations for productive applications.
<P>
Personal Paint 7.1 remains the latest version, while we are working on
version 8, which however is not expected to be ready at least until the
second half of 1999. Personal Paint 8 requires a major re-write to
support features such as true color, layers, and advanced animation
functionality. At the same time, it is now very important that the new
code be written in a portable style, because it is still unknown what
the new Amiga OS will look like, other than it will not be the Amiga
that we are used to. Suggestions regarding the features of Personal
Paint 8 are very welcome, and can be addressed to
<A HREF="mailto:suggestions@cloanto.com">suggestions@cloanto.com</A> (preferably containing "Personal Paint 8" in the
message title).
<P>

Cloanto web site at <A HREF="http://www.cloanto.com/amiga/">http://www.cloanto.com/amiga/</A>
