  For Immediate Release: Deimos Design Cancels PPC Support
  Date: 01/05/1998 
 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  Deimos  Design, the team behind Maim & Mangle has decided to cancel any
  and  all  PPC  support in it's forth coming title, Maim & Mangle.  This
  was  not  an  easy decision to reach, however, we feel this is the only
  ethical way for us to continue development.
 
  This  decision  came  as a result of many factors, and we would like to
  take  the  rest  of this announcement to address these points.  For the
  ecord,  we  fully  believe  that  any hope the Amiga platform has of a
  future  is  with  open,  industry standard hardware, and an updated OS.
  owever,  we  do  not  believe  that  this future lays with the PowerUp
  boards.
  
  Cost Of The PowerUp Investment
  ------------------------------
  An  overwhelming  factor  is  cost.   The big-boxed PowerUp boards (the
  CS-PPC  range,  with a 50Mhz 060, a 233Mhz 604e, and no RAM) costs just
  under  $2000  CAD  after  taxes.   No  other solutions exist.  For that
  price,  one  could  buy  a  complete  Pentium  II  system.  For the few
  benefits  you  get,  we cannot justify the cost to ourselves (try as we
  might).
  
  That is an economic reality that a lot of people (including some of us)
  will  no  longer  ignore.   Hence, not all of us will be buying PowerUp
  cards, now or in the future.  Now, if we will not purchase these cards,
  it is simply hypocritical of us to ask fellow Amiga users to do so.  We
  will not do that.
  
  Lifespan of the Hardware
  ------------------------
  We also believe that the PowerUp boards are a short term stepping stone
  /  hold  over.   There  is no guarantee that a future AmigaOS will ever
  support  these  boards,  and therefore, they potentially have even less
  value.    Until  the  OS  supports  the  HW,  any  and  all  future  HW
  developments  are  one  big  bandage.   It  does  nothing  to  heal the
  sickness, it only prolongs the suffering.
  
  Which System To Use?
  --------------------
  Our  first priority upon obtaining the PowerUp hardware was to evaluate
  each  SW system for ourselves, by ourselves.  We ignored the statements
  from both sides (as each side is obviously biased towards their system)
  and decided to investigate them independently.
  
  Suffice  to  say, that from our own analysis we decided that WarpUp was
  the  best  solution  for Maim & Mangle.  It clearly won us over on many
  factors:
  
  1 - Documentation
  2 - Installation and ease of use
  3 - PPC native graphics support (RTG Master)
  4 - Stable development system, which worked as documented
  5 - Shared Libraries *now* - a large part of our shared code
  
  We  then  decided that since our game would be supporting PPC hardware,
  Phase5  would understand our decision (even if they did not like it) as
  it would only mean more sales for them.
  
  We could not be further from the truth!  Basically, we were expected to
  support  PowerUp,  no matter what the cost.  Our viewpoint was that our
  usage of WarpUp meant:
  
  1 - It was still support for their fledging hardware
  2 - It would mean more sales for them (regardless of the software used)
  3 - Using PowerUp would adversely impact our development schedule
  4 - Using PowerUp would effect the PPC support of the title (as less code was
      appropriate for the PPC side under PowerUp (the graphics system being a
      major consideration for this game))
  5 - It would effect the overall quality of the title.
  
  Despite  the  fact  that is was still support for their product, it was
  not good enough.  It was basically all or nothing.
  
  We  then decided to go back and re-evaluate PowerUp, with the potential
  side  effect  of  scraping several months of work.  Needless to say, we
  were not pleased.
  
  Ulterior Motives?
  -----------------
  As Phase5 are first and foremost an add-on hardware company, one has to
  wonder  why  they  are so forceful about using only the PowerUp system.
  After  all,  no matter what software is used, it is only more sales for
  them (they are the only provider of Amiga PPC hardware).
  
  It  does not tax their support department, they have stated that WarpUP
  is  not  a supported system (obviously this job falls to H&P).  It does
  not  hamper  future  developments, WarpUp would have to adapt to future
  hardware developments, not the reverse.  What then, is the problem?
  
  In  Deimos  Designs  opinion,  it  comes down to the fact that Phase5's
  objectives  do  not  coincide  with  the  Amigas  future.   Phase5 have
  publicly  stated  that  PowerUp is a migration path to a "real PPC OS",
  with the side effect of speeding up the current host system (i.e.  your
  Amiga).   This  has  been  stated  in  public  forums and on the Phase5
  website  (http://www.phase5.de).   It  has  also  been stated that this
  "real  PPC  OS"  is  not the proposed Amiga OS 4.0.  This can only mean
  that  this "real PPC OS" is the planned A\Box OS, not a future revision
  of the Amiga OS.
  
  That  is  fair  enough  - they are free to do whatever they please with
  their  company  and products.  However, Deimos Design does not consider
  such  plans  helpful  to  the  Amigas  future and therefore we will not
  support their efforts with our software.
  
  Why Not WarpUp?
  ---------------
  At  this  point, you may ask "Well then, why not use WarpUp?" That is a
  very  valid  point,  and  one  which  we considered.  Deimos Design had
  planned to go ahead with WarpUp until recent activities came to light.
  
  The  final  straw  came  when  Phase5 elected to put the PowerUp system
  software  in  the  flash-ROM.   We simply disagree with the practice of
  starting *any* software system from third party hardware.
  
  The  purpose  of  an expansion card ROM is to configure the card for OS
  usage, not to start up a dedicated OS extension.  Despite asking Phase5
  some valid, open questions, they chose to simply ignore us, rather than
  provide a valid technical justification.
  
  You  might now say, "Well WarpUp will find a way to disable the PowerUp
  software".   Very  true,  there will always be a way around the PowerUp
  software,  eventually.  That is the key word, "eventually".  Phase5 are
  free  to  change the manor in which the PowerUp SW is started with each
  and  every  update  of  the  flash-ROM.   This  means that WarpUp could
  conceivably  be  disabled  for  weeks  at  a  time, with each and every
  flash-ROM  update.   While  WarpUp would eventually circumvent this, it
  would  have a very negative effect on any products based on WarpUp.  In
  Deimos Design's opinion, this is the desired effect.
  
  Effects On Maim & Mangle and The World Foundry
  ----------------------------------------------
  The  main  concern  is  - what are the effects on Maim & Mangle and The
  World Foundry?
  
  The  first  concern  is  Maim  &  Mangle.   Unfortunately,  some of the
  features  will  obviously  have  to  be  scaled  back,  or  be  removed
  completely.   As  far  as  the overall impact on Maim & Mangle, this is
  still under evaluation.  When we have completed our evaluation, we will
  announce the results.
  
  The   second   part  is,  how  does  this  effect  The  World  Foundry?
  Unfortunately, TWF is also drastically affected.  The World Foundry was
  first  and  foremost  established  to create and promote utilisation of
  high  end  equipment  by  games.  Obviously, Deimos Designs decision to
  cancel PPC support has a fundamental conflict with that goal.
  
  Therefore,   Deimos  Design  has  withdrawn  from  The  World  Foundry,
  effective  immediately.  We would like to assure everyone that we still
  have  a  strong relationship with our former partners, however, we feel
  it would be unfair to them to remain a part of TWF.
  
  To  remove any and all doubt, we would like to state (on behalf of TWF)
  that  Explorer  2260  PPC  is  still  being  actively  developed.  This
  announcement does not effect Explorer 2260, or the remaining members of
  TWF, only Deimos Design and M&M.
  
  Conclusion
  -----------
  In  conclusion,  the Deimos Design team has currently decided to revert
  to  a  68K  only  development  plan.   We  will not support attempts to
  migrate  the  remaining  market  to  an alternate platform.  The market
  needs to unite instead of bicker, now more than ever.
  
  If  the  Amiga  ever  sees  a native PPC OS, we will of course consider
  supporting  it  with  PPC native games.  However, at this point we will
  bow out of the Amiga PPC market.
  
  We  realise that this will not be a popular decision, and that not many
  people  will agree with it.  That is, of course, your right.  No matter
  how  unpopular this will make us, we stand by our decision and will not
  support  a  company  that  tries  to  artificially  limit the end users
  choices.   It  is  your  right  to  run  whatever  software you want on
  hardware you have purchased, not a privilege which a company can revoke
  at will.
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Any  questions or comments should be directed to Deimos Design, not The
  World Foundry.
