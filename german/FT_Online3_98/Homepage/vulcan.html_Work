          Vulcan  Software  Limited is proud to announce the signing of the
          development  team  Black  Flag  from Portugal along with their 30
          million year old master piece CAVEMAN SPECIES for the Amiga CDRom
          & PC CDRom platforms.

          All at Vulcan are honoured to have them aboard!


          CAVEMAN SPECIES
          ---------------
          A  small planet in our universe bares witness to the emergence of
          intelligent life!  In this evolutionary rage of power, the weaker
          will  not  stand  against the breed who shall inherit the land of
          the caveman species...
          
          Caveman  Species  is a real-time strategy war game set in a world
          comprising   of  3  continents  that  enclose  over  90  playable
          locations.
          
          Each  location features it's own unique storyline that creates an
          ever evolving and intriuging plot.
          
          The  players  goals  will  be different for each location and can
          include, wiping out the enemy tribes, reaching a certain level of
          tribe  progress  or perhaps discovering ancient cities or finding
          lost tribes.
          
          Special  features  allow  tribes  to interact with elements like,
          witches  with  magical powers `who can weaken the enemy in battle
          or  turn  them into frogs` or visit Stonehenge to invoke the gods
          `who  can  fill  your  enemy with the plague` or kidnap dinossaur
          eggs  for  breeding or ultimately hunt the infamouse T-Rex, train
          it,  then  ride on it`s back into battle to tear your enemy apart
          with one single bite!
