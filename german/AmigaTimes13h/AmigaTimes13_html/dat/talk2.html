<p>Amiga.org and Haage &amp; Partner announced today that they will 
team up to make Amiga.org's Mitchy Resource Retriever the best 
possible resource directory and search engine for Amiga-related
information, resources, and Web sites. Mitchy is a powerful 
Yahoo-like link directory with a search function that includes 
the number of hits for each resources, a rating system, Top 10 
lists, and much more. Mitchy currently has about 1.000 entries.</p>

<p>&quot;After the well-known CUCUG Amiga Web Directory was retired
at the end of 1999, we wanted to create a successor of our own,&quot; 
said Markus Nerding of H&amp;P. &quot;We made a plan and started to 
investigate suitable software but then realized that Amiga.org 
already offered such a service. Their Mitchy resource retriever
had all the features we wanted to see in such an Amiga directory, 
and so we stopped our project and have teamed up with Amiga.org 
to make Mitchy even better and well-known to the Amiga community.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We started on Mitchy in early 1999,&quot; said Wayne Hunt, father and
programmer of Mitchy. &quot;I am just now making some major changes to 
improve its usability and performance. This partnership with H&amp;P 
will help us to make Mitchy more known to the public, as well as to 
increase its contents. For instance, there will be regular raffles 
for visitors of our Web site with attractive prizes donated by H&amp;P.&quot;</p>

<p>Amiga.org is the Web site of the North Alabama Society of Amiga Users 
(NASAU) and is run by Wayne Hunt, Wayne Martin, Kent Seaton, and 
James Russell. The site's main services are news, the Mitchy resource 
retriever, and several forums. Amiga.org staff can be contacted at

<p>Haage &amp; Partner is the leading manufacturer of development systems 
and applications for the Amiga family of computers, including the new
Amiga OS 3.5. H&amp;P's mission is to provide the Amiga market with the 
most effective tools and applications possible. H&amp;P staff can be
