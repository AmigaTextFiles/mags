Greetings to one and all:
<br><br>
A great deal has occurred over the last couple of weeks, and it is only
going to get hotter as we move forward.
<br><br>
In the last two weeks we have announced our new OS partner, began technical
training and began meetings with future technology partners.
<br><br>
The response has been overwhelming, and we are but keeping our heads above
water.
<br><br>
On January 8, 2000 at CES in Las Vegas we announced our partnership with
Tao-Group as our foundation OS partner. This is a strategic relationship
and brings us great rewards. I have asked Fleecy to write a short document
highlighting the Amiga/Tao relationship from a more technical perspective,
other than my telling everyone how incredible great and fantastic it is.
<br><br>
In the next two weeks we will make another strategic partnership
announcement with regards to the new Amiga and the operating system.
<br><br>
After a week long trip to Germany and England I have come back with a much
better understanding of what we can not do. As mentioned before we are not
going to make promises or product announcements. We will announce to you,
the community, only after the deal is signed. This will help preclude from
the continuance of rumors, and the continued deterioration of the Amiga.
<br><br>
Our job as a company is to create exciting market opportunities for Amiga
developers to take advantage of, and Amiga users to enjoy. This is more
than just an upgrade to the OS. This is a complete strategy involving all
aspects of the business.
<br><br>
Many of you have sent us business proposals, and product marketing ideas,
for this we thank you, and ask your patience as we look over these plans.
Some of them offer us some good ideas and perspective into areas and
desires of the Amiga community as a whole that we may not have considered.
<br><br>
Over the next several weeks there will be some companies that come out with
their own plans, or state that we do not have the community at heart as we
move on. The reality is, they do not know what we have planned. In order to
keep focused and to keep the incredible pace up and moving we are not
sharing our plans outside of our signed partnerships. This means that if
you hear something that you have not read on our site, or from a member of
our team directly, it is not true.
<br><br>
Plain and simple.
<br><br>
If you did not hear it from us, or read it here on this web site it is not
true.
<br><br>
We are not asking for your trust or your undying belief. We only ask that
you take us on our words and deeds.
<br><br>
We will begin official meetings in Germany, England and the US for
developers and dealers. This will include introductory training seminars
for the new OS, and introductions to the retail pricing and schedules. We
will also begin the process of bringing out the new web site, and more
details will emerge as this happens.
<br><br>
I want to thank each and everyone of you for your hospitality during our
meetings and your continued opportunities for us to move forward. We have
had the chance to meet with end users, developers, dealers, and new
partners.
<br><br>
There is a great deal of activity, and some great things happening. New
partners, old faces joining the team, and we are already in the process of
moving into bigger facilities.
<br><br>
Keeping the faith,
<br><br>
Bill McEwen and the rest of the Amiga Team.
