<b>March</b>
<br><br>
Hi,
<br><br>
TWF News
<br><br>
1. TWF Opinion Polls<br>
2. Explorer 2260 Update.<br>
3. Maim &amp; Mangle Update.<br>
4. Next News Update<br>
<br><br>
<b>1. TWF Opinion Polls</b>
<br><br>
The poll we have been running for over a month now has now finished. We
asked the question:
<br><br>
With the recent buyout of the Amiga by Amino just before the new year, do
you think this will reverse the amigas fortunes ?
<br>
<ul>The final votes are:
<li>Yes        - 142</li>
<li>No         - 19</li>
<li>Don't Know - 26</li>
</ul><br>
A new poll has been added with the following question:
<br><br>
With quite a number of ports of popular PC games currently being ported
to the Amiga platform, what would be your prefered option for TWF to do ? 
<br><br>
Just two choices this time, Game Ports or Originals.
<br><br>
<b>2. Explorer 2260 Update.</b>
<br>
<ul>News this month:
<li>A lovely picture of the shipyard that appears in the game was added to
      the E2260 section of the TWF website early this month.</li>
<li>Finialised jump engine configurations and space/weight requirements.
      Reworked some of the theoretical hyperspatial physics to allow for
      multidimensional effects.</li>
<li>Redesigned several ship system areas to use realtime 3D generated
      visuals instead of pre rendered scenes.</li>
<li>Added 2D animation facilities to the graphics abstraction layer</li>
<li>Investigation of PowerPlay communications protocol started.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>3. Maim &amp; Mangle Update.</b>
<br><br>
<ul>News this month:
<li>Work is progressing on porting the game engine to using miniGL
      developed by Hyperion.</li>
<li>Work is also being on adding the path finding to the game. Both these
      parts are due for mid March.</li>
<li>All the Terran units have been modeled.</lu>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>And nathan has this to say.
<li>Getting myself up to speed on the M&amp;M documentation.</li>
<li>Learning the layout of the engine source and where my code is going to
      go.</li>
<li>Putting the engine source through various compilers. This is a benefit
      to me as I use several compilers, and for the future linux port.</li>
<li>Digging though my stacks of magazines (game developer etc.) and books
      for anything useful. I've done a fair amount of reading this month.</li>
<li>Playing games (not that much!) for ideas and inspiration.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<B>2. Explorer 2260 Update.</B>
<br><br>
<B>News this month:</B>
Altered galaxy structures [down to planet level] to provide more
details in navigation.
Additional work compiled for the CEG including work on the Ovaska,
Dah'Screwe, Elarien, Mogensen and hyperspace documents done. Will appear in
CEG in due course.
Encountered compiler problems. Investigating alternatives...
<br><br>
<B>Plans for next month:</B>
Remove a colony of bugs from the texture file editor.
Complete the entity and object texture editor.
The plans for chris to take over the world have been put on hold till
he gets those game editors finished. Development must be getting to him. :)
<br><br>
<B>3. Maim & Mangle Update.</B>
<br><br>
<B>News this month:</B>
<br><br>
Nathan our new programmer has been settling in with testing out the
current game engine and editors, familiarizing with game design documents
and setting up a development environment for developing both amiga and
linux versions.
A new Terrain Editor version has been released, which implement new
routines used on the new engine.
Work on the engine itself was delayed a little bit due the intensive
work done on the StormC implementation of the upcomming minigl link library
and porting GLQuake ;-)
<br><br>
<B>Plans for next month:</B>
<ul>
<LI>A new and improved engine (40% faster then the current one)
<LI>Porting of the engine to MiniGL may start.
<LI>A few updates for the editors
<LI>A new prototype GUI up and running for the game.
<LI>Work on the pathfinding and AI routines to be restarted.
</ul>
