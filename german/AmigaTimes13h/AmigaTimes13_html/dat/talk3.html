Stockholm, Sweden - Wednesday, February 23, 2000.<br>
It's time to cast your votes in the 1999 AAA Awards! This year, we have made some changes to <B>easen up</B> the procedure, added a <B>Product award</B> - and we are now also <B>represented in the USA</B>! Oh, and yes, it <i>should</i> be 1999 - for greatest achievements during 1999.
<br>
New awards!<br>
As a response to public opinion, we now have a new <B>Product award</B> category, for best Amiga or Amiga related product of the year! Currently, it is available for the <B>International</B> and <B>USA</B> awards. The Product award winners are selected by a <B>jury</B>, from your suggestions.<BR>
The "old" awards have been named <B>Community</B>, and are for greatest achievements in/for the Community during the year. The Community award winners are <B>selected directly</B> by all of you. The one with the most votes wins! So, no more three-nominee votings!<BR><BR>
If you want to <B>read more</B> about the awards, go to <A HREF="http://www.aaa-awards.org/overview.html">http://www.aaa-awards.org/overview.html</A>.

<A HREF="http://www.aaa-awards.org/vote.html">Vote now!</A><br><br>
Voting is open for everyone until <B>March 26th</B>, around the clock. Cast your votes right away, so you won't forget! This is your opportunity to <B>say thanks</B> to that shareware programmer, the helpful company and so on.<BR>
