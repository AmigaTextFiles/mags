<BR><H1 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Amiga goes Linux - commentary by Robert Niessner</B></FONT></H1>&nbsp;

<BR><FONT SIZE="+1">The latest decision by Amiga Inc. not to use the QNX OS
now and instead use Linux has hit the Amiga community quite
hard.</FONT><BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="01" HREF="#00"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#02"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR>The essential question now is: &quot;What does this all mean&quot;?<BR>

<BR>Inevitably the assumption will be made that Amiga Inc. is attempting to
jump on the band wagon, to get a bite in the big Linux kitchen. The
direction they're taking is not quite so stupid: many people are fed up
with the Micro$oft Empire and are searching for an alternative. If someone
were to now present a new platform with made-for-Linux hardware instead of
an Intel-based computer - surely all Linux worshipers would get wide-eyed
and fall for the product. With a little history-making marketing strategy,
they could attract tens of thousands to the Amiga in one hit - with the
motto &quot;Essentially Linux&quot;.<BR>

<BR>Regarding lack of software, you shouldn't have any worries. There's
plenty, as much as sand on a beach, and in any case big firms are becoming
weak at the knees with Linux at the moment. Gateway itself could lend a
hand in one way or another. I also wouldn't be surprised if Gateway
suddenly introduced Intel-based Linux computers to their product range.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="02" HREF="#01"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#03"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR>The question that still remains unexplained is how compatible is the
placement of the AmigaOE on the Linux kernel to the rest of Linux. Drivers
can't be so simply translated, as Collas would lead us to believe. And
LinuxPPC already runs on the Classic Amiga, despite the fact there's still
no driver for the UW SCSI of the CyberstormPPC...<BR>

<BR>Perhaps Amiga Inc. would like to save money in development and leave
everything to be programmed by the community, gratis? These thoughts don't
seem to be so absurd; in end effect Open Source is really just a great Hype
anyway. And it is also quite nice not to have to part with pennies for
innovations.<BR>

<BR>One could say about QNX that till now you could see a demo and recently
also a few screenshots, which to a certain extent shows an impressive GUI.
It seems QNX really has competent designers behind it, but that is in no
way conclusive of a finished AmigaOS, with its look-and-feel, and no-one
can say beyond doubt whether this all means a loss for the future NGAmiga.
Too much is being speculated and quibbled; some users are probably even
using crystal balls to get a glimpse of the near future, destabilizing the
community with rumours and emotion. :-) In the end there's nothing else
remaining except to further wait and see what the face of the Amiga past,
for every user familiar territory, will mean.<BR>

<BR>On the other hand, there is the question Where's the Amiga Revolution
when they are anyway advocating an old proprietary UNIX (Posix). The
niceties of the AmigaOS are its practical functions and speed. The AmigaOS
was certainly not especially simple to use, but the technology of its
genius is revealed when you understand the system directory structure -
right up till today.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="03" HREF="#02"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#04"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR>Whether Linux is brilliant or not, I venture to doubt, as there are too
many programmers tinkering about and too few users around, and as is well
known, one group has different ideas about User Friendliness as the
other.<BR>

<BR>Had Micro$oft built the most important parts of Amiga functionality
into windows, I would have run over with fluttering flags - but in the end
it's really down to feeling good with an operating system when at work! For
example screen swapping, locales, device handling, clear system structure,
ramdisk, etc.<BR>

<BR>One notices how good OS3.1 is when practically everything and all
PC-Trends have found their way to the Amiga. Sure, it has its weaknesses,
but show me an OS that has nothing to show for itself. And even though the
AmigaOS has no memory protection, I have, in my long Amiga career, had
fewer losses of data than in 3 years on Mac or PC. Which OS can be copied
to another partition, the System partition formatted, the contents copied
back and then normally carry on working?<BR>

<BR>That all being the case, the future lies in tangible proximity, the
world will not go under, and Amiga Inc. will some day bring out an AmigaNG,
be it revolutionary or not.<BR>
