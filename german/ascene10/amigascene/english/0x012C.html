<BR><B>SK:</B> Hi Ross !!<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> Hello :)<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> Be so kind and tell us something about your person...(how
old, where u live, jobs,....)<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> Me? Well, I'm 20, living in the UK (Harrogate, North
Yorkshire to be exact) and I'm the Director of PR and Marketing here at
Rosande, although most of my time is spent running the company side of
things. I also help design the gameplay, draft the contracts and arrange
the finances...<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> What were the first contacts to the `AMIGA` ? Have you ever
been an active member of the `scene` ? Tell us...<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> I'm not really an active member of the Amiga scene - well,
it'd be difficult as I don't own one... However, I have had influential
contacts in the amiga industry since I was seven, most important of which
was a guy called Bill Donald - he's written a few books on the Amiga and
was one of the very first people to own an A500 - it didn't even have a
badge!<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> ok. We already know, that you`re director of marketing/PR.
Are you a founder of `ROSANDE LTD.` or when did you join?<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> I'm one of two founder members of Rosande Ltd (The other
being Andrew &quot;Oondy&quot; King). Rosande was only officially formed in
November last year.<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> So when did `ROSANDE LTD` start developing? (which
platforms)<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> Well, as I said, Rosande started in November, but we've been
working on FUBAR seriously some 3 years now. We were originally called
Q-Group software, and we were all working on it part time. Our main
programmer, Oondy, has done numerous bits and pieces, and was a contributor
on Foundation. Now both myself and Andrew work on the project full time -
it kind of has a life of its own...<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> Who else is in `ROSANDE LTD` ?<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> Well, most of the people we use are freelance. We bring in
the skills when we need them. There have been a lot of contributors, chief
amongst which have been Andy Kinsella, our long standing GFX artist and
Will Morton's Q-Labs who are responsible for the soundtrack. We also have
contributors like yourself and Jean-Pierre Rossouw who contribute
specialist gfx and fmv.<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> I know, that at the moment you`re developing a game called
`FUBAR`.How much can u already tell us about the game, genre,
highlights,...<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> FUBAR is a strategy war game which incorporates lots of
different ideas from different genres to create something altogether
different. Highlights would be the way in which you can create vehicles and
weapons based on three different types of technology - Nuclear, Electrical
and Biochemical. Other highlights include the graphics, music and the
lovely Rosande logo ;)<BR>

<BR><CENTER><IMG WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=180 ALT="[Logo]" SRC="../images_10/rotatestill.jpeg"></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>SK:</B> Sounds interesting ... tell us more ...<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> Okay, well the game functions in three stages. The first of
which is the world map screen, where you can position troops and keep an
eye on your cities. In this screen, the game is very much like
Civilisation.<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> Then we have the city screen, where you control the
population, vehicle building, troop training and so forth. You need manage
yourself before you attack others.<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> Finally, the battle screen. This is a real time strategy
affair, like Command and Conquer in many respects. This is where the action
takes place and you get to &quot;test&quot; your weapons...<BR>

<BR>However, FUBAR is much bigger than the sum of its parts so to
speak...<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> When and why did you start with the idea of such a game ?
Who had the idea ?<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> Originally Andrew had the idea of releasing a PD North and
South clone, with updated graphics and gameplay. The project had been kinda
shelved when I met him, but together we re-invented it and came up with
what would be the foundations of FUBAR.<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> How much is finished yet? Is there a demo version
available?<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> The demo that was available is so old that it no longer
represents the game at all! We're about 40- 50% done, but we have
everything in place to ensure that the remainder is finished comparatively
quickly. The GUI is in the final programming stages, and there's a game
engine up and running too. It's basically a case of cobbling everything
together. We're also using our own programming language (!)<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> So when will it be in the shops ?<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> Well, it'll be finished in August if everything goes
according to plan, so September.<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> ok then. At least you`ve sent me some nice screenshots ;)Any
comments?<BR>

<BR><CENTER><IMG WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=180 ALT="[Rocket Tank]" SRC="../images_10/fubar_2.jpeg"></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><CENTER><IMG WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=180 ALT="[Scene 1]" SRC="../images_10/fubar_3.jpeg"></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>SK:</B> Well, I think its very hard today to live from developing
for `AMIGA` only (although the situation is getting better). How profitable
is it really?<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> The Amiga isn't really profitable anymore, mainly due to
piracy - people who buy hardware and think that they're entitled to rip off
the software because they're &quot;Supporting the market&quot; are kidding
themselves. If we can't make any money on the Amiga, we'll concentrate on
the PC - but we are really keen to stay with the amiga!<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> One solution is, to develope a game for other markets, too.
Will you do that ?<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> FUBAR's source code is already optimised for conversion to
the PC and Playstation. That's where we'll make our money. We already have
the DirectX and 3DFX programmer ready and willing (last time I checked...),
so a PC version won't be far behind the Amiga game.<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> I`d like to know the relation of the profits (if you`d
precalc them) between the sales ofan amiga-version and a pc-version of the
same game.<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> Erm... Times the Amiga profits by hundred and you're
probably getting warm. The market is far bigger on the PC...<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> I think its time to show the people out there some more
screenshots ... here they come...<BR>

<BR><CENTER><IMG WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=180 ALT="[Title]" SRC="../images_10/fubar_6.jpeg"></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><CENTER><IMG WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=180 ALT="[Tank]" SRC="../images_10/fubar_5.jpeg"></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>SK:</B> Lets talk again about `FUBAR`. You know, that there are many
other good games (and clones) out there. If you want to produce a
top-selling game, you have to be different to the others, in fact,you have
to be better than the rest.How do you want to reach that with `FUBAR` ?<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> Well, FUBAR aims to succeed by offering options and ideas
not available in any other game of this kind. On the subject of clones, the
problem is that people like them - otherwise they wouldn't sell. How many
Doom/Quake variants are there out there for example? Look at Half Life
compared to Quake II - practically the same format, but implemeted
differently - Half Life opts for strategy and offers highly intelligent
adversaries as opposed to Quake II's &quot;scrag and run&quot; format.
FUBAR will be the intelligent and more varied relative of a host of other
games.<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> To come to an end, what will the future bring us? Whats your
opinion about the classic-Amiga &lt;-&gt; NG-Amiga discussion?(G3-boards,
OS3.5, OS5.0, QNX, ...)<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> It's not a discussion I really enter into to be honest.<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> Do `ROSANDE LTD`-games support the PPC?(powerpc or ppc,
warp3D, rave3D)<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> We've been asked to by Blittersoft, and we will if it's
viable. The problem is that there's no support for developing programs on
PPC, so it depends how much work it will take.<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> Will `ROSANDE LTD` support the new NG-amigas (if they`ll
ever come) ?<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> If it's financially viable, then certainly. We like
supporting the Amiga, but we have to be able to support ourselves first.
We're anxiously awaiting the specs that are promised at Londons World of
Amiga show this year!<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> What are the future-plans of `ROSANDE LTD`? are there plans
for a new game ?<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> I already have a team waiting to go on the next project,
working title &quot;Silver Falls&quot; which will start as soon as FUBAR is
in the can. There's a band ready to supply some decent vocal tracks to it
and I have a very talented artist called Vanessa Wells ready to do the
character designs and posters. Q-Labs will be producing the soundtrack
again and I've lined up Technoarts cc to produce the FMV.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><IMG WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=180 ALT="[Soldiers]" SRC="../images_10/fubar_4.jpeg"></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>SK:</B> Is there anything else you want to say to our readers ?<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> Well, most importantly, support the Amiga by buying the
software even if it isn't ours - a machine lives or dies on it, it doesn't
matter how good the hardware is. Just look at the dearth of titles on the
N64... There were more second hand N64's in Japan than new ones when
Squaresoft moved to Sony in the first six months :)<BR>

<BR><B>SK:</B> oki. I think thats the end now. Thanks alot for your time,
and much success with `FUBAR` !<BR>

<BR><B>RL:</B> Thanks very much :)<BR>
