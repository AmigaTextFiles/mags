<BR><FONT SIZE="+1">MP3 has become the accepted compression standard for
music on almost every platform. But only a few know the excessive
inefficiencies that are hidden behind the functionality. It is like the
telephone, everybody uses it but hardly anyone know how it
works.</FONT><BR>

<BR>The goal of this article is to bring the secrets of MP3 out into the
open.<BR>

<BR>First of all; MP3 stands specifically for MPEG 1 layer 3. But as PC
users know due to the problem with long file name extensions these are
always shown as *.MP3. (Windows recognises file types based solely on their
endings. Therefore a *.doc file is some kind of MS Word document, a *.xls
an Excel file, a *.mpg is an MPEG, and a *.puke is a puke file :-)<BR>

<BR><H3><B>Who created this?</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>Development for MP3 has been carried out by the Frauenhofer-Institute
in Erlangen in cooperation with TU-Erlangen for the so called
EUREKA-Project since 1987 (Not as new a technology as you might have
thought?). Dr. Karlheinz Brandenburg (Phd in engineering) who at the time
was director of the Department of Audio technology and Multimedia at
Fraunhofer Institute is credited as the father of the MP3 process <A
HREF="http://www.iis.fhg.de/amm">http://www.iis.fhg.de/amm</A><BR>

<BR>The goal of Eureka was among other things to drastically reduce the
relatively high data rates of an Audio-PCM-Signal which can, for example,
in a CD exceed 180 KBytes/s. With the previous nonlossy compression
algorithms this could not be realized, therefore concentrated effort was
made to develop a lossy compression process that would retain the highest
possible quality. From this inspiration the MPEG coding process for audio
and video was developed which became known in audio circles as MPEG 1 Layer
1.<BR>

<BR>One of the commercial uses for MPEG was the digital compact cassette
(DCC) from Phillips. Thanks to MP1, delivered files were only a quarter of
the size of the source data. The MiniDisc from Sony later employed a
similar non conforming MPEG process with a compression factor of 5:1.<BR>

<BR><H3><B>The further development</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>Soon afterwards the standards for MPEG layer 1 and 2 were
differentiated. Layer 2, with its better compression, being the winner and
only being sent into retirement by the follow on process MPEG 1 layer 3.
The new concept utilized in MP3 was a decision to concentrate upon the
maximum obtainable compression factor instead of upon the available CPU
processing capability.<BR>

<BR>The newest technology is MPEG-2 AAC (Advanced Audio Encoding) and is a
sequential further development of MP3. AAC offers, in addition to
significantly better coding efficiency, (the same audio quality with a
higher compression rate) extra functional capabilities such as the support
for more programs with up to 48 channels or reception frequencies from 8 to
96 kHz and much more. Unlike MP3 free unlicensed AAC decoders will not be
tolerated. Therefore this process will not be particularly interesting for
the Amiga (unless of course Amiga Inc. licenses the process and builds it
directly into the NG Amiga OS.)<BR>

<BR><H3><B>How does MPEG function now?</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>The basis for all types of Audio coding is the psychology of
acoustics.<BR>

<BR>This scientific field concerns itself above all else with physical
measuring methods to determine at what point differences can not be
perceived. Decision measures utilize the so called masking effect, the
principal of which appears in two forms. For people it is not possible to
resolve two neighboring tones of slightly different frequencies that also
differ in volume as the softer tone will not be perceived and therefore the
softer tone need not be retained.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A HREF="../images_10/mp3-simul_mask-small.png"><IMG WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=238 ALT="[MP3 Simul Mask]" SRC="../images_10/mp3-simul_mask-smalltn.gif"></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR>see also enlarged Figure MP3-simul_Mask-big.png<BR>

<BR>The bottom green curve shows, what sound pressure (SPL) is required to
just hear a specific frequency. A tone of 1 kHz at 80 dB alters the minimum
threshold drastically. The curve marked with 80 shows the area of mask. A
tone of 2 kHz must now be louder than 50 dB instead of 10 dB to be heard
next to the louder 1 kHz tone. A softer tone with a similar frequency to a
louder tone is over a specific range masked by the louder tone to such an
extent that the softer tone is unnecessary and can be removed. This is
precisely how an MPEG-encoder functions. The resolution (of the sound
differentiation) is dynamically processed to remove the portions of the
signal that can not be perceived. The capability of the process is
dependent upon splitting the entire frequency spectrum into 32 frequency
bands (Layer 1 and 2). In layer three each of these 32 bands are further
divided into 18 sub-bands. The encoder begins to function when the entire
information content can not be carried within a preset bit rate. A 1 kHz
sine wave with a bit rate of 128 kBits/s will for practical purposes be
unaltered because all of the information will fit into the 128 kBit/s data
stream. As one raises the frequency the information content also climbs and
thereby also the amount of the required reduction (compression). Dependent
on the quality of the applied algorithm and the availabilty of adequate CPU
processing power an encoder can manipulate and optimize the incoming
signal. The highest quality is delivered, naturally with the Fraunhofer
encoder, because it works with signals upto 20 kHz, while the Xing encoder
is limited to 16 kHz and is relatively noiser over the remaining
frequencies, however it is also approximately twice as fast!<BR>

<BR>In addition there is a timely cover effect which results in quiter
passages immediately before and after a sound louder than the average sound
not being recognized. Hearing requires a recovery period from quieter as
well as louder sounds until fully restored.<BR>

<BR>Thus the encoder has two important principles of functions for dynamic
signals available in order to differentiate on a digital level between
unrecognizable and recognizable signals.<BR>

<BR>The principles of masking so far described are sufficient to push the
bitrate to 32 kbyte/s. This results in a compression ratio of 5:1 for CD
sound. Further procedures are necessary for stronger reductions of the data
rate to 16 kbyte/s. As this bitrate is normally used in stereo sound the
next sequential step is self explanatory: an (imperceiveable) reduction in
sereo information. In principle the impression of stereo is comprised of
phase - and tone differences between the left and right channel. The human
determines the direction of any sound event according to it.s freaquency..
Deeper sounds cannot be located (subwoofer-principle), medium sounds are
located by the left or right ear via combination of loudness differences
and timing of arrival; high frequencies (pitches) however are only located
by the differences in loudness.<BR>

<BR>The Fraunhofer Encoder uses at first one of the basic functions of
stereo techniques below 32 kbyte/s known as &quot;Joint Stereo
Coding&quot;, which is he middle/side-coding. The stereo signal is thereby
taken apart into a middle (l+r) plus a side signal (L-R). As this side
signal contains less information it results in reduced data compared to two
fully separate stereo-channels. In this way large amounts of data are
avoided as well as the reduction of stretches of irrelevant information.
When using even lower than 8 kbyte/s data rates the &quot;Intensity Stereo
Coding&quot; can be applied. For each frequency band only a sum channel and
information regarding directions will be translated for a given frequency
band. Because of the low data rates good quality results are obtained,
however there exists noticable deviations from the original.<BR>

<BR><H3><B>What happens inside the Encoder</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>At first the audio data is routed thru filterbanks. This results in
partial data streams which are then assigned to the available bits in the
quantisizer and coder ( quantisize is defined as the difference in
resolution of the frequency band according to its requirements). The
resolution varies dynamically between 2 and 15 bit ( originally 16 bit). A
type of masking data base containing all possible maskings controls the
assignment of bit resolutions.<BR>

<BR>This data bank is set up using data from very detailed test procedures
with test subjects known to have excellent hearing. So far it had not been
possible to measure human hearing and its realization using classical
measurement techniques. Because of the progress made in digital techniques
and DSPs we now have, at least initially, a very promising basis to support
the development and improvement of the Encoder.<BR>

<BR>The search for the best possible type of masking for a given signal is
very time consuming and largely responsible for the time required for the
encoding. The logic of recogniation isutilized in an attempt to optimize
this search via step by step aproximations (iteration).<BR>

<BR>Last not least the Huffman-coding as used for instance in package
programs, is responsble for the suppression of redundant bits within the
data stream (fi.e. bits without or with the same contents of
information)<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="07" HREF="#06"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#08"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>It's easy for the Encoder</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>In comparison, decoding is relatively simple. Although filtering of the
original signal has to be recalled, a search for the matching masking
method does not take place at all. Decoding in todays computer systems
usually runs in the backgound without a burden on the CPU (except if you
have a lame 68k proccssor). In addition the decoder has firm definitions,
improvements of the procedure thus only happen with the encoder.<BR>

<BR><H3><B>Encoding as fast as the wind</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>In the PC world the available selections from various vendors leaves no
wish unfulfilled. However on the Amiga the selection is more limited. At
this time I only know of three usuable encoders, among these are Lamer and
Encoder. The latter is commercially available from Titan-software and
should offer similar quality as the Fraunhofer Encoder. This account is not
necessarily complete and is also not the actual topic of this article. We
will deliver a test report as soon as the first commercial encoders are
available.<BR>

<BR><H3><B>Competition - MS Audio</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>As usual Micro$oft also attempts to conquer this market and guide it
into a monopoly headed by Microsoft. By hitting the advertisement drum and
by turning on the marketing machinery the lurching giant from Redmond
stomps towards a frightened end user and threatens with raised finger:
&quot;Our audio standard is far better than MP3 and we are also faster at
the coding process&quot;. It is natural to raise the question how they
accomplish this within such a short time frame As we had mentioned before,
the optimization of the coding procedure is a very time consuming matter
and as such one has to think whether the patents.........<BR>

<BR>The results of the Fraunhofer Institute have been thoroughly documented
and published - it is here where foreign knowledge was borrowed and (ab)
used extensively. Of interest as well is that Micro$oft has so far not
registered any patents.<BR>

<BR>As noted by different parties the quality of MS Audio was not really
overly impressive compared to MP3, its speed is about that of the Xing
Encoder, however with far poorer results.<BR>

<BR><H3><B>The End</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>We don't need to be afraid of these matters , it is not expected that
M$ will transfer its MS Audio to the Amiga. MP3 has its recognition and
will be enjoyed for a long time by its users (it allows you to put 10 hours
of music on one CD).<BR>
