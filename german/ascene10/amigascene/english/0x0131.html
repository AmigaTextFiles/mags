<BR><H1 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Interview - with &quot;The Newslady&quot; Petra Struck</B></FONT></H1>&nbsp;

<BR><FONT SIZE="+1">A number of AMIGA friends should already know her page,
and if not - it's definitely worth a visit. Concentrated recent news, all
about AMIGA, and committed work - what more could one wish?</FONT><BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="01" HREF="#00"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#02"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><A HREF="http://www.amiga-news.de/">http://www.amiga-news.de</A><BR>

<BR>To have a look at the successful homepage from the
&quot;backstage&quot; perspective, I asked the web-mistress Petra Struck
for an interview.<BR>

<BR>RN = Robert Niessner / AmigaScene<BR> PS = Petra Struck /
www.amiga-news.de<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="02" HREF="#01"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#03"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>RN:</B> Could just introduce yourself briefly?<BR>

<BR><B>PS:</B> Well, let's start with the fact that I'm 42 years old,
married, and have an 8-year-old daughter. I haven't been working full-time
since Ivana's birth, so I've had plenty of time for my hobby AMIGA. My
friend Meike is here right now, so I asked her to describe me briefly. Here
we go:<BR>

<BR>&quot;One can definitely rely on the fact that she means what she says
and says what she thinks. That can be a pain in the butt, but it's a good
starting point for work. Most of the time we have great fun with each other
and we do a lot of nonsense together, but Petra is also someone who not
only listens to other people's problems but also helps and gives good
advice. To cut it short, her striking characteristics are honesty and
cheerfulness - she's the perfect &quot;best friend&quot;. You can really
get along well with her - as long as you don't try to call her before
10AM.&quot;<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="03" HREF="#02"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#04"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>RN:</B> Yes, I had a similar impression when I first visited your
homepage: one can see at a first glance that someone has put a lot of love
and care into it. If there was a prize for the homepage with the
friendliest text, you would most certainly get it! How long did it take you
to make your HP what it is now? Will there be any improvements? You've
already made a start with the Logo-Competition.<BR>

<BR><B>PS:</B> The very first - really horrific - homepage I let loose on
humanity in 1996 IIRC. It was a single huge exercise in self-glorification
and the &quot;intellectual value&quot; was equal to zero. Since then, the
page has been constantly changing, developing and improving. This will also
be the case in future. There is no final, ultimate look and no unchanging
content. The page will always be under construction. I have plenty of
ideas, but there just isn't enough time to put them all into practice. For
instance, I really should go over the hardware questionnaire and make it
run with an internal CGI-script. Perhaps there is someone &quot;out
there&quot; who knows a bit about CGI and AMIGA-hardware and who would like
to help me? I would also like to make some changes in the Hotlist. I don't
want to say too much about the really new ideas, so they don't get
&quot;stolen&quot;. :-)<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="04" HREF="#03"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#05"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>RN:</B> How did you get to AMIGA and for how long have you been
using the system?<BR>

<BR><B>PS:</B> Since I've never been content with the role of a
&quot;typical housewife&quot;, I decided to get a PC. Then I saw the AMIGA
500 on which a friend was playing an adventure game. I was fascinated by
that at once and I decided to get an AMIGA. I think that was around 1992.
The first few years I didn't even have a hard disk and the only thing I was
using my AMIGA for were adventure games. Much later, I got interested in
the operating system. Then, I just had to buy an A1200 and a modem.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="05" HREF="#04"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#06"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>RN:</B> What does your system look like now? Are you planning to get
an AmigaNG in the near future?<BR>

<BR><B>PS:</B> My system is quite simple to describe: A4000T in a
RBM-tower, Zorro III board with CyberSCSI onboard, Cyberstorm MKII from
Phase5 with a 68060-50 MHz CPU, Picasso IV, 2 + 64MB RAM, modem DataBox
Speed Dragon, an HP Deskjet 510 printer and a 17'' monitor.<BR>

<BR>And I'll be the first one to get an AmigaNG. :-)<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="06" HREF="#05"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#07"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>RN:</B> Your newspage is of unique quality within the
German-speaking (Amiga-)area. How much time do you spend on average per day
in front of the computer and in the WWW?<BR>

<BR><B>PS:</B> That depends on my mood. It can be anything from two hours a
day to six or eight hours a day. I work mostly at night when my family is
sleeping. :-) My husband Gert makes this possible since he supports me by
doing all the morning routine with my daughter.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="07" HREF="#06"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#08"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>RN:</B> You seem to really fond of family life. Without that support
you probably couldn't continue your time-consuming work on the homepage,
could you?<BR>

<BR><B>PS:</B> No, I certainly couldn't do that without my husband. And the
best thing about our relationship is that we accept each other's hobbies
and support each other in that area.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="08" HREF="#07"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#09"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>RN:</B> Have you ever thought about quitting? I guess, if you
weren't having fun with your page, you would have quit a long time ago.<BR>

<BR><B>PS:</B> No, I've never really thought about quitting. But there are
days when it just doesn't work as well as usual. I am a really cheerful
person, but I can't be in a good mood all the time and then I get really
annoyed, for instance by readers hyping about some small mistake,
smartasses who think they can do everything better and then can't answer a
concrete inquiry, webmasters who flood my mailbox with huge pics, people
telling me to publish something &quot;immediately and unedited&quot;, or
people who think I have to write something about their homepage (usually
the &quot;my AMIGA, my hobby, my dog&quot; - style) and are then pissed
because I don't.<BR>

<BR>But that kind of day doesn't come up often and 95% of the time I really
have fun working on the Amiga News. Also, I really enjoy the positive
feedback.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="09" HREF="#08"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#10"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>RN:</B> What do you actually do the rest of the time - when you're
not working on the News?<BR>

<BR><B>PS:</B> Oh, I do a lot, especially with my family and my friends. My
daughter also has a bunch of loud friends. There is not that much work
around the house, but I read a lot, sit in cafes and make fun of people.
;-) From time to time I help out in a boutique. It all small every-day
stuff. Incidentally, I'm also the web-mistress of the Amiga-Club, but to be
fair I have to say that I get a lot of help there.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="10" HREF="#09"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#11"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>RN:</B> Wow! Hearing this makes one think that you a have a
48-hour-day. :-)<BR>

<BR><B>PS:</B> Oh, no, not at all! It's just a matter of organisation and
of course also of attitude. Also, I don't need more than seven hours of
sleep which leaves me another seventeen hours per day to do things. And you
can do a lot in seventeen hours! :-)<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="11" HREF="#10"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#12"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>RN:</B> You have, mostly through your newspage, a good overview of
the situation on the Amiga market. What do you think about the general
attitude in the community at the moment?<BR>

<BR><B>PS:</B> I see completely different moods and attitudes every day:
from &quot;completely utterly crazy with joy&quot; to &quot;weeping and
grieving&quot;. My personal attitude is optimistic. The impression I got at
the meeting in Frankfurt was the Jim Collas is someone who can really move
things and who will keep his word.<BR>

<BR>However, like many other users, I keep pondering some events, and
sometimes there is a certain feeling of frustration. It's high time
something happened - otherwise even more Amiga users will change to other
systems.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="12" HREF="#11"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#13"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>RN:</B> I can only agree with you. I think that all of us - the
whole Amiga community - are anxious to see what happens. This is probably
the very last chance for Amiga.<BR>

<BR>Something else: For some time now there've been advertising banners on
you page. What are the reasons for this and what consequences does it have
for you and the web-page?<BR>

<BR><B>PS:</B> I think the reason is quite clear - the immense costs of
being online all the time. I do get a lot of news by e-mail, but I have to
verify the URLs given and I still have to &quot;hunt&quot; the major part
of the news myself which takes a lot of time online.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="13" HREF="#12"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#14"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>RN:</B> I heard (from you of course :-) ) that a lot of people have
been hyping about the banners recently. Would you like to make a statement
on that topic here?<BR>

<BR><B>PS:</B> I just couldn't take an average phone-bill of 700DM on the
long run. It's simply too much for a hobby. The homepage is very successful
and therefore interesting for advertising purposes. Why shouldn't I use
that in order to get at least part of the money back in? I don't see a
conflict, even though some people have been talking about
&quot;commercialising&quot;. People who don't like the banners can go
&quot;news-hunting&quot; on their own if they wish. ;-)<BR>

<BR><B>RN:</B> Would you like to say anything special to our readers at the
end?<BR>

<BR><B>PS:</B> Yes: Enjoy life, let the sunshine in, enjoy the summer, read
a good book, give your partner a nice present and stay as you are! :-)<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="15" HREF="#14"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#99"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>RN:</B> Well then, I thank you for the interview! :-)<BR>

<BR><B>PS:</B> Thanks for your interest. I had a lot of fun doing the
interview.<BR>
