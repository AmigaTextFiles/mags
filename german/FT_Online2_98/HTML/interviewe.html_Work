FT: clickBOOM was there, out of the blue, and conquered the Amiga games
    market almost instantly.</TR></TD>
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#9E9692"><pre>
cb: Well, it started with Capital Punishment, and almost two years of 
    work on it prior to its release. So, it's not so sudden as it may 
    seem.</TR></TD>
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#30A1BC"><pre>
FT: What is Your secret ? All the long years since Commodore`s death,
    we heard that PC-games were too difficult and too expensive to port.
    Now, MYST has proved them wrong, but how was it possible for You to do
    what others never did ? </TR></TD>
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#9E9692"><pre>
cb: There is not much secret really. It's just a matter of doing 
    things right. Conversions too difficult? It depends on the team's 
    skill. Conversions too expensive? It depends on the publishers 
    ability to pay for it, and more importantly sell enough to return the 
    investment.

    I wish an answer was as simple so I can put it in one sentence. 
    However, as I said, there is no secret, it's a powerful combination 
    of vision, organization, development and promotion.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#30A1BC"><pre>
FT: MYST was Your first port, and the result is one of the best Amiga 
    games ever. Now the crowd yells for more!</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#9E9692"><pre>
cb: Thanks. It really is a great game, and Amiga port looks and feels 
    great.

    What about RIVEN, the sequel to MYST ? Any chance that this, too, 
    will come sooner or later to our Amigas ?
    Rumours say that it is already being worked on....

    It is still too early to know the final Myst sales, as it appeared on 
    the market less than two months ago. However, if sales continue to be 
    good as they are now, we will definitely want to convert Riven. 
    Furthermore, we are collecting registration cards from Myst, and a 
    very important question there is "Name 1 game you would like to be 
    converted to the Amiga". At the moment, Riven is number 1, and if it 
    continues to be that way, it will mean that Amiga owners of Myst 
    loved it and would like to see Riven. Great thing about Riven is that 
    it's not just a sequel, it's a whole new world, and it would be a 
    great challenge to develop it, and a great game for Amiga users to 
    play.</TD></TR>

<TD BGCOLOR="#30A1BC"><pre>
FT: The Conversion Wishlist on Your homepage revealed that most people
    would like to see an Amiga-version of "Monkey III".
    Is it possible ? Any chance that LucasArts will let You port it ?
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#9E9692"><pre>
cb: Obviously we created Wishlist because we wanted to know what Amiga 
    users want. Since they want Monkey Island 3, we will see what we can 
    do about it. Is it possible? Why wouldn't it be? Anything is 
    possible. The question is not will Lucas Arts "let us" port it - the 
    major mistake everyone makes is thinking that another company will 
    "let you" convert something. Of course they won't. It's not a matter 
    of writing an email to them and saying "Hi, I would like to convert 
    your game to the Amiga. Will you let me?", it is much more complex 
    than that. It took us 6 months to finalize the agreement for Myst, 
    and another 6 for Quake.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#30A1BC"><pre>
FT: Is all the effort You take to give the Amiga these games rewarding
    for You ? Are Your sales satisfying ?</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#9E9692"><pre>
cb: At the moment, we are very satisfied with Myst sales, and response 
    for Quake preordering is great, so it seems we have found the right 
    recipe.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#30A1BC"><pre>
FT: The Amiga`s market situation seems to improve. At least, it looks like
    it is becoming more and more stable.
    That is what AI and others think.
    What is Your position ? Do You see a future for the Amiga, now that even
    APPLE has problems ?</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#9E9692"><pre>
cb: If we didn't see future in the Amiga we would definitely not risk 
    with the biggest conversions ever! :)  It's as simple as that. There 
    is still potential on the Amiga market, and things have drastically 
    changed since one and two years ago.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#30A1BC"><pre>
FT: 1998 looks promising.What are YOUR plans ? More ports in sight ?
    Any original clickBOOM games in the making ? A sequel to Capital
    Punishment ?</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#9E9692"><pre>
cb: Well, clickBOOM wouldn't be what it is if we didn't have surprises 
    for the Amiga users. So, naturally, we will surprise them more in 98. 
    We started wit Quake early in the year, and there are 10 more months 
    for surprises.

    More conversions? Maybe.
    More original games? Maybe.
    A sequel to CP? No.

    Thanks a lot for Your time :-)
