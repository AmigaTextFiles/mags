More products and lower price for Power Computing's Digital Camera 

Last Saturday, 28 March 1998, a particularly excited Tony Ianiri has officially 
launched in the presence of Amiga Format's Deputy Editor, Ben Vost, a series of 
new hardware and software products.
Oliver Roberts, of F1GP Editor's fame, and author of the PowerDC100 software for 
Power's Digital camera, illustrated all the features of the camera and its 
accompanying software (which even allows for taking a series of shots within a 
user's specified interval).
Read the updated Info page with more samples and a shot of the program's GUI.
The camera (including the software) will only cost £99.95 and it should be available 
within this week.
The Amiga used for the demostration was connected to a high resolution SVGA monitor 
thanks to Power's new Scan Doubler which comes in various models, including a 
flicker fixer.
The price for the internal model is £59.95, £79.97 for the external and £99.95 for 
the flicker fixer.
Nobody can stop you anymore from buying a nice, inexpensive, PC compatible monitor 
(call for price and models, all sizes available).

We kept for last the most innovative product of the event.
All the way from Italy, Lorenzo Caprio, director of Underground Software, was 
demonstrating PowerMovie, which is going to offer to the Amiga community the long 
awaited tool for easy Full Motion Video editing.
We expect it to become popular for the development of Multimedia projects, 
videogames and to put together thousand frames long 3d rendered animations with 
synchronized soundtrack and soundF/X.
Just like us, you will have to see it to believe it, and Lorenzo is doing all his 
best to make a demo available for Amiga Format's May issue (in the mean time you 
can ask Ben :-).
If not, you will have to come at the World of Amiga, where it should be ready for sale.
In order to keep its price down, Power Computing is going to license PowerMovie 
according to its final use.
A cheaper licence for personal, strictly non-commercial usage, for all the Amiga 
enthusiasts around.
A business licence, for companies planning to use this software (and the files it 
creates) for commercial products (videogames, Multimedia CD-Rom, Info-Points, etc)
PowerMovie is the natural outcome of two years of development of a brand new game, 
The Golem, which is going to be the first of a new breed, using interactive Full 
Motion Video at this quality.
All rendered with Lightwave, the few animated sequences made a few jaws to drop, 
and the finished game will fit on two CDs.
The game includes different sub-games: a beat'em up, an adventure, a spaceship 
fighter, etc.
We will have a page with some screen shots soon.
The game needs a 6xspeed CDRom, and where it should play fine with a 68020 and 
some fast memory, we recommend a 50MHz 68030.
Versions for graphic cards are also on the pipeline.
Keep in touch for more up to date information.
