<center><h1>ANNEX Interview</h1></center>



Nearly every Amiga user has already heard of the Amiga hymn CD,
and it has been accepted with enthusiasm. We have prepared an
interview with the group ANNEX for this issue.
Have fun with it!
<p>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top"><b>AT:</td><td> First, I want to congratulate you to your great CD!</b></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Daniel:</td><td> Thanks a lot. And we thank the Amiga people for their support.
        Every day we get a dozen of eMails from all over the world,
        that gives us a lot of courage.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>AT:</td><td> Since when does ANNEX exist?</b></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Daniel:</td><td> Georgette, Sandra and Neal have already been on stage four
        years ago with a self produced dance performance.
        Two years ago the contact to Ricardo P&eacute;rez was established.
        When the cooperation between AMIGA and P&Eacute;REZ MUSIC appeared
        in outlines, Neal got the two befriended female dancers
        Ornella and Mimi for the team. With that, ANNEX was born.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>AT:</td><td> How did you get this idea ?</b></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Daniel:</td><td> I am an enthusiastic AMIGA-Freak since many years, who had the
        idea to compose a song for the international fan community.
        First of all, I wanted to create an international musical
        idenification sign for the fans, on the other hand, I also
        wanted to call people's attention to the AMIGA, for so announcing
        the big AMIGA comeback in public. Also the text of the song is
        orientated to that.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>AT:</td><td> How long did the production take ?</b></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Daniel:</td><td> I already began with the song in mid 1997. All together we have
        filed nearly eight months on the hymn.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>AT:</td><td> Which systemconfiguration was used ?</b></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Daniel:</td><td> I used an A1200/060/50 MHz. You don't have to own a highly extended
        Amiga to make music with it. If anyone is interested in my exact
        configuration, he can email me.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>AT:</td><td> Which program did you use ?</b></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Daniel:</td><td> I used OctaMED Soundstudio Pro. It is simply brilliant.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>AT:</td><td> Why did you produce this CD with the Amiga ?</b></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Daniel:</td><td> The answer ist simple: I just do not own a peecee or Atari,
        and I also will never buy myself such thing.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>AT:</td><td> What do you think of the Amiga in general
        respectively what is your attitude ?</b></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Daniel:</td><td> One should think, that there ist no better computer, but unfortunately
        software companies cross our plans again and again. Alone these
        applications that run with real good performance on Fusion or
        Shapeshifter should be truly a convincing argument for further
        software development. Besides that, unfortunately quite nobody does
        professional public advertisement for the Amiga, and all these
        companies that do develop Amiga software, underestimate their software
        by lengh. Maybe the theme CD and the song &quot;Back for the future&quot; will
        arise corresponding attention in the media and so cause free Amiga
        adversising. It is now time for massive advertisement ... however, the
        Amiga is for me an unreplaceable &quot;friend&quot;, that I never would exchange
        for anything in the whole world.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>AT:</td><td> How has your idea been accepted by the Amiga users ?</b></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Daniel:</td><td> Fantastically, before the acception by AI-president Petro Tyschtschenko,
        some international user clubs agreed to the next official song.
        So is the today's mostly positive resonance of the Amigians, that ist
        demonstrates to us every day by a lot, lot of eMail from all over the
        world.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>AT:</td><td> Will you produce something different for the Amiga in future ?</b></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Daniel:</td><td> We'll see, what future brings; but we will try everything to get more
        and more atention for the Amiga and to push the computer system. If
        we'll have success with &quot;Back for the future&quot;, we would like to give
        to other AMIGA musicians the chance to release their songs. Maybe on
        some kind of AMIGA compilation. The first demo tapes from users have
        already been sent to us.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>AT:</td><td> How will it be commercialized - also in cd shops or just in the amiga
        market ?</b></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Daniel:</td><td> Besides the distribution of the fan release cd via AMIGA International,
        &quot;Back for the future&quot; will be available in shops soon. We are now in
        dialogue with different big marketing organizations. But in spite of
        that we urgent need air plays to give more weight to the song (and
        therefore to Amiga) in public. We hope to get the support of the
        amigians.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>AT:</td><td> Will your song also be hearable/viewable in radio or television ?</b>

<tr><td valign="top">Daniel:</td><td> Yes, that's what it looks like now. A lot of amigians asked us to
        coordinate an eMail campaign to the most important radio stations.
        They are convinced to be able to express their power as user by this
        way (, also without the support of AI). So it is not just our aim to
        sell the CD possibly more often, but to make it largely and
        internationally known.<br>
        The realisation of this idea may will be made by the FunTime magazin,
        that wants to organize the eMail-campaign for germany honorary. May
        other magazines will join with this magazine to cause an AMIGA
        advertisement campaign of the superlative, made by fans. News can
        always be found on our ANNEX Homepage at:<br>
        <a href="http://home.t-online.de/home/ripera/nx.htm">http://home.t-online.de/home/ripera/nx.htm</a>
<p>
        There is in case of appropritate receipts from the CD selling also a
        video planed. But a clip can easily cost DM 30.000, so we ja need
        those appropriate receipts. But if someone already should have good
        contacts for live-performances of ANNEX (i.e. concerts, television),
        please write to us.We are thankful for any support.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>AT:</td><td> What do you think should happen to the amiga ?</b></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Daniel:</td><td> A lot of more professional advertising will be te most important
        in future to inspire new users for the Amiga. And then user groups and
        freaks should continue to work on good software (i.e. conversions of
        games). They are the true engine and the real power center of our
        &quot;Amiga movement&quot;.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>AT:</td><td> What would you want to say to the Amiga users ?</b></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Daniel:</td><td> Help us to spread the song around the whole world. It is a trojanian
        &quot;media&quot; horse to make the AMIGA again be talked about. At this time
        Amiga Inc. itself has evidently not enough means to start huge ad
        campaigns. So now it lies in the hands of the fans to make the Amiga
        heard in public, in the full meaning of the words.<br>
        For questions please directly ask us by mail: <a href="mailto:perez@gmx.de">perez@gmx.de</a></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>AT:</td><td> We want to thank you for this interview and wish you all the best
        for the future !</b></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Daniel:</td><td> Thank you very much. We wish also all the best for your magazine.
        SUPPORT AMIGA!</td></tr>
