<BR><H1 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Amiga Computer Survives by Enthusiasts' Fervor</B></FONT></H1>&nbsp;

<BR><FONT SIZE="+1">Technology Focus 2/6/97 15:48</FONT><BR>

<BR>Chicago, Feb. 6 (Bloomberg) - Legend has it that when the late Jay
Miner was developing his personal computer in the early 1980s, he looked to
his dog for guidance.<BR>

<BR>When Mitchy the Pomeranian failed to wag his tail in approval, that
part of the design was scrapped.<BR>

<BR>If that story's embellished, there's truth in another: Tens of
thousands of enthusiasts remain so smitten by Miner's elegant machine that
they're waiting out the company's turmoil and patch- ing their aging
computers rather than succumb to the Microsoft Corp./Intel Corp. duopoly
that powers most of the world's PCs.<BR>

<BR>The saga of Apple Computer Inc.? No, Miner invented the Amiga, a
machine most folks today have never set eyes on. Yet, the parallels to
Apple's Macintosh can't be ignored. Dubbed dazzling at its 1985 debut, a
series of poor management decisions and unexpected market forces has left
the Amiga an orphan technology entangled in a German bankruptcy court.<BR>

<BR>&quot;The Amiga is like a John Wayne movie. It's been to hell and
back,&quot; said Dwight Parscale, president of NewTek Inc. NewTek makes
Video Toaster, an Amiga add-on used by hundreds of television and video
production studios for special effects.<BR>

<BR>Another company, QuikPak Corp. of Norristown, Pennsylvania, is the only
one licensed to make the top-of-the-line version of the Amiga used by
filmmakers. It's made a bid for the company and expects a decision by
month's end.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="01" HREF="#00"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#02"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>Amigans Keep the Faith</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>While the Amiga's trials proceed, an army of devotees, much like Mac
loyalists, keeps the faith.<BR>

<BR>There's no machine like it for creating inexpensive special effects and
video manipulation, said NewTek's Parscale. The Star Trek and Babylon 5 TV
series have used it in their productions.<BR>

<BR>The Internet is laced with Amiga Web sites and newsgroups where users
swap tips, gossip and encouragement. Hundreds, some say thousands, of Amiga
programs are available free or at a nominal price over the Net.<BR>

<BR>Amigans also form clubs to exchange ideas and sell or swap scarce
parts. At a recent meeting in Atlanta, an elderly woman offered to sell an
8-year-old Amiga because, she reluctantly admitted, she had been lured to
an IBM clone. She had no problem finding takers.<BR>

<BR>Lamar Morgan, president of the Amiga Atlanta club, fancies himself an
evangelist spreading the &quot;Word of Amiga&quot; in a land of PC
infidels.<BR>

<BR>&quot;There is a vicious war going on for the soul of the computer
user,&quot; Morgan said. &quot;The Amiga's story is not just about a
machine. It's about the people who made it and the people who use
it.&quot;<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="02" HREF="#01"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#03"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>California Roots</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>Like Apple, the Amiga got its start in California. In 1982, Miner and
three others formed a company to design a video game box to compete against
the popular Atari, one of the first home gaming systems that plugged into a
TV.<BR>

<BR>When development costs depleted seed capital, the founders sold Amiga
to Commodore International Ltd. in 1984 for $27 million in cash and stock.
Miner, Mitchy and crew stayed.<BR>

<BR>In mid-1985, a date of biblical proportions to the Amiga faithful, the
$1,295 Amiga 1000 computer was unveiled.<BR>

<BR>Compared with the monaural sound, black-and-white Apple or two-color
International Business Machines Corp. computers of the day, Amiga offered
4,096 colors, full-screen animation, four- channel sound and a television
connection. And, unlike the Atari and other gaming machines, it was a
full-fledged computer.<BR>

<BR>&quot;Technologically, it's a dazzler,&quot; Time magazine wrote at the
time.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="03" HREF="#02"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#04"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>Trials and Tribulations</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>Commodore's handling of the Amiga, however, was less than stellar. By
1986, industry observers wondered if Commodore fumbled by marketing the
wunderkind machine as a toy. A lack of software also didn't help.<BR>

<BR>New Amiga models were introduced, but Commodore and others were hurt by
a deep slump in the computer industry. Commodore filed for protection from
creditors in May 1994 and liquidated its assets. About two months later,
Miner died.<BR>

<BR>Germany's Escom in 1995 bought Commodore's assets for a
bargain-basement $6.6 million.<BR>

<BR>Amigans rejoiced, but their joy was brief. The company went into
receivership in 1996 and sold its assets, including Amiga Technologies
GmbH.<BR>

<BR>Visual Information Services Corp. of Chicago made a $40 million bid to
acquire Amiga Technologies last year. That bid dropped to $20 million after
Escom filed for bankruptcy in July.<BR>

<BR>Now VIScorp, whose Securities and Exchange Commission documents say it
can't generate enough cash flow from operations to meet business
obligations, won't be buying Amiga after all.<BR>

<BR>So the technology rests in the hands of a German court- appointed
receiver and the hearts of the faithful.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="04" HREF="#03"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#05"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR>&quot;There is a danger of Amiga sliding, sliding away,&quot; said Don
Hicks, managing editor of Amazing Computing magazine, which covers the
Amiga world. &quot;It is a 10-year-old design, and we need someone to own
it long enough to make improvements.&quot;<BR>

<BR>As Amigans paste and solder their machines, privately held QuikPak
makes Amiga models for video professionals.<BR>

<BR>Dave Ziembicki, QuikPak chief executive, said if QuikPak's bid for
Amiga Technologies succeeds, the company will make modestly priced machines
for the home.<BR>

<BR>Meanwhile, Amigans the world over hang on. In Atlanta, enthusiast Joe
Torre put his 12-year-old Amiga 1000 through its paces. He popped the top
cover to reveal not only its original virtues but his handyman efforts to
maintain and upgrade the system.<BR>

<BR>He then pointed out an Amigan secret.<BR>

<BR>On the plastic cover's inside are the signatures of the Amiga's
developers. Next to founder Jay Miner's handwriting is the embossed paw
print of Mitchy, his canine companion and reputed computer design
consultant.<BR>

<BR>Maybe there is truth to some legends. And maybe the Amiga, and Apple's
Macintosh, will survive.<BR>

<BR>After all, as Amiga evangelist Morgan says: &quot;It's about beating
the odds.&quot;<BR>
