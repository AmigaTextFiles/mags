Oberursel, April 3, 1997:  phase 5 digital products, a leading vendor of
CPU Acceleration and Graphic Expansion products for Amiga computers,
today welcomes Gateway 2000 as the new owner of Amiga Technologies.

"We appreciate the fact that with Gateway 2000 a new owner is going to
take over Amiga Technologies, who can provide a strong base for a future
development of the Amiga and the Amiga market" says Wolf Dietrich,
General Manager of phase 5.  "We hope that Gateway 2000 will be
interested in the future of the Amiga itself as an alternative computer
system.  With their economical strength and market position, Gateway 2000
can start the creation of new products with a vision for the future, not
being limited by short-term economical constraints.  Insofar, we believe
that there are big chances for the Amiga future if Gateway 2000
understands the heart and soul of the Amiga and it's users."

generation, PowerPC-based processor cards into existing Amiga systems

steps, the results of which the company is ready to share with Gateway
2000 and Amiga International.  "Once again, we are open for a
technological cooperation which could result in nearly immediate
availability of powerful and inexpensive new technology for the Amiga"
comments Wolf Dietrich.  "A year ago, we had already started such a
cooperation, before Amiga Technologies cancelled all development on their
side.  We have continued with the project that we had initiated, and
today we are just weeks ago from the release of a new, sensational
product generation.  We will contact Amiga International in the near
future, to discuss the opportunities for technological exchange, and if
it is wanted, we are ready for an extensive cooperation both on the
hardware and the software sector."
