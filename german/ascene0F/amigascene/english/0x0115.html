<BR><H1 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Greetings to all of you, folks!</B></FONT></H1>&nbsp;

<BR><FONT SIZE="+1">Its been along time since we could speak over the
leadership of our mother company. First, they gave us nothing to talk about
and secondly one could hardly talk about the subject without breaking out
in tears slamming your fist on the table or drowning in a large beer mug
(dependent upon ones mood and temperament). Has anything changed? Even our
beloved Petro gives often cause for anguished complaints, and the Yanks
have done nothing but cause us to pull our hair out by the roots, or so it
would appear.</FONT><BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="01" HREF="#00"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#02"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR>But lets check out <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de/e-fr.html">The People
Behind Amiga</A><BR>

<BR>At one time there was only Nicole Gottfried, who knew all of her
customers personally, listed as official spokesperson. Had we really grown
so small? Now, there are again more. As we direct our attention to these
new additions we realize with certainty how in truth Amiga has changed into
a company we can no longer complain about.<BR>

<BR>Have they finally figured it out? Do they now know what an Amiga is and
should be? And have we, as end users, finally been noticed? Has someone
finally noticed how Petro, with nothing in his hands, has managed to keep
the name Amiga alive, in spite of having nothing to sell?<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="02" HREF="#01"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#03"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR>It does give one cause to think (although this time in a positive way)
that at one time the people who have bought there way in, were previously
well known far earning their daily bread in small but rather interesting
companies. Jim Collas, who is now the designated leader of the entire Amiga
group, founded in 1987 a small firm of the name <A
HREF="http://www.anigma.com/">Anigma, Inc.</A>, who produced from product
inception through production complete motherboards and other customer
specified products. Perhaps we don't have to leave our special hardware and
precious coprocessing chips if the good Jim himself has produced hardware,
programmed video games, and after that acquired a masters degree in
electronics.<BR>

<BR>A bit less well known man is our charming associate, Richard LeFaivre.
His list of previous experiences is splattered throughout the who-is-who in
the computer industry. he previously worked for SGI, Sun, and Rutgers
University in New Jersey. He has his degree in Mathematics and Computer
Science. Maybe he won't really be needed as chief technician with his many
projects and diverse committees.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="03" HREF="#02"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#99"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR>What remains? Coming from both the land of burgers and Cokes as well as
Germany are 14 additional people. Among these there are many well known
names from previous shows and exhibits such as Jeff Schindler and Bill
McEwen. Axel Kraemer is also not exactly unknown to us.<BR>

<BR>But will it work? For that we can, as before, only &quot;wait and
see.&quot; But don't look for me to rain on this parade. They are doing
well; and when this fall in Cologne we see OS 3.5 perhaps no one will rise
from their chair, but we will no longer have to knock around a five year
old operating system. So people, off to the key boards and let our friends
celebrate with us!<BR>
