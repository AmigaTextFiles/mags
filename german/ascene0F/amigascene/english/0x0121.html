<BR><H1 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>PacMan&acute;96 - the yellow ghost-hunter has returned!</B></FONT></H1>&nbsp;

<BR><FONT SIZE="+1">Once upon a time there was a young boy. This boy walked
along the seaside with his brother and his mother. The midsummer heat would
have overheated his head, had he not worn this cap which looked rather
silly but fulfilled its purpose though. Along the lake there was much life:
masses of people everywhere - some of them were swimming in the water, some
were sitting in boats; at land they enjoyed the pleasures of delightful ice
and shadowful places. And under one of these shadowy places the boy beheld
something which fascinated him right from the start and should be destined
to fascinate him ever since: a videogame called <B>PacMan</B>
...</FONT><BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="01" HREF="#00"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#02"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<A HREF="../images_0F/coolegrafik.gif"><IMG WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=128 ALT="[Intro screen]" SRC="../images_0F/coolegrafiktn.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=15 VSPACE=15 BORDER=0></A>

<BR>At that time I of course understood quite nothing of computers and even
less of videogames, and I did not obtain the skill to judge about the
quality of these games. I had just become aware of something new and found
it was great. I luckily can&acute;t remember my first time with the
joystick in my hands, but shameful it really must have been. But gladly I
recognized - other than some family members not to be mentioned - the raw
idea behind <I>PacMan</I>. (our mothers and aunts, years after, whilst
watching <I>Lemmings</I>: &quot;Look, things are falling down
everywhere!&quot; - what more needs to be said?)<BR>

<BR>But now arises one question: why test a game much older than 15 years
which is known by almost everyone, simple in its ways and of barely any
interest to anyone? Of course just because my brother has forced me to do.
- No, that was just a joke: I guess that also classic games have the right
for new versions, and these really have the right to get reviewed. And so
be it with <B>PacMan&acute;96</B> ... it is old indeed, but still good!<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="02" HREF="#01"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#03"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>of unbelievable importance: the guide ;-)</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR><B>PacMan&acute;96</B> can be quickly downloaded from the mighty
<A HREF="http://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/aminetbin/find?pacman96">Aminet</A>
archives as a Lha-file and get unpacked, and all of the files fit into one
single DD-Disk. A nice gift is the file <B>X-Mas96</B>: a double click
leads us to a funny picture drawn by Tom, our untiring graphic artist and
divine creator of many fantastic AmigaScene-graphics. At the same time a
short sample asounds, reminding me of Peter Steele&acute;s description of
the forthcoming <I>Type 0 Negative</I> album (&quot;the new songs are going
to sound like Black Sabbath playing ten minutes backwards and drunk&quot;).
I suppose that the sample played backwards would possibly reveal some
satanic messages or a call for violence and suicide; alternatively it could
also be some kind of &quot;merry X-mas blah blah&quot;. Be it either way: I
like that gag!<BR>

<BR>The guide files can be read either in German or English. They reveal
that the main force behind <B>PacMan&acute;96</B> was Andreas Oberdorfer,
one of the programmers of the legendary <B>Alcatraz</B> (some people prefer
to call them &quot;Alk-Matratz&quot; which means alcoholic mattress) who
are responsible for the whole production, despite the fact that in the
guide they describe themselves as a bunch of drunk &quot;Seppels&quot;, but
fortunately would never accept living animals as a present. And I feel the
obligation to say here that no one should miss all the hidden gags, and so
everyone should read the whole guide instead.<BR>

<BR>The earlier mentioned Andi was really frustrated about the fact that
his wonderful Amiga 4000/40 was indeed a fast and cool one but denied the
cooperation with all older <I>PacMan</I>-versions regularly and apparently
with much joy. So he tried to create a new version which was designed to be
able to work together with even the most senseless configurations and to
make friends with every OS. Using C++ and assembler, he and <I>Alcatraz</I>
managed to develop a code running perfectly in multitasking and on all
gfx-boards and even being playable in workbench windows! That last thing
only works with 8-bit-screens (256 colours), and it is the same for all
gfx-board-screenmodes.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="03" HREF="#02"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#04"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>The yellow eater and the ghosts ...</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>One of the most wonderful things about <B>PacMan&acute;96</B> is that
it indeed runs perfectly in multitasking and on all screens. Due to the
system-friendly code it needs 400 k chip- and 500 k fast-ram and works only
with 68020 and OS 2.0 or better, but this should not cause any problem to
the amiga-users nowadays. Of greater importance seems to me the fact that
weak CPU-and gfx-power may cause the game to lose smoothness and slow down
when using some screenmodes. On my 68030/50 (guess the readers already know
that) a productivity-workbench-window causes the game to run much more
slowly. This nice slow-motion feature may well decrease the level of
difficulty, but then the game doesn&acute;t really make sense unless I use
a faster screen. When played on a &quot;normal&quot; screen the game is
much faster while NTSC naturally is even faster than PAL due to the
diffenence of frequencies. The preset screenmode is DblPAL:LowRes.<BR>

</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE>&nbsp;

<BR>The options and settings gloriously can be saved: controls, sound,
volume of music and FX, task priority and screenmode or usage of a
wb-window. In the mighty level editor one can easily create new levels and
save or load them at will. During the game - in the pause-mode - the sound
settings can also be changed. And of course a top-10 highscore list exists.
By and grand the control and usage is quite easy - no big surprise but
nonetheless a pleasure!<BR>

<BR>What can be said about the graphics and sound? Naturally the graphics
of a <I>PacMan</I>-clone are rather simple - at least it is not necessary
at all to include thousands of animations and backgrounds as they would
only attract the awareness of the player and decrease his level of
concentration. And in addition I feel that for nostalgic reasons one should
try and make the clone in some way similar to the original, thus leaving
the not so necessary ornaments away. All who want to please their eyes with
cool graphics can go ahead and code their own <I>Quake</I>-style
3D-<I>PacMan</I> with spinning fractals on the walls or something like
that. Really nice indeed is the funny background of the highscore screen.
About the sound I cannot say much because apparently I did not obtain some
kind of audio.library (should seek and download it soon!), and so I
can&acute;t enjoy the cool soundtracks (hmpf!), but what I can listen to is
the original (and thus quite average) FX. Again it is obvious that the idea
behind that clone was not technical perfection of the appearance but rather
the revival of the original idea.<BR>

<BR><H3><B>the same again, but this time with alcohol, please!</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>(and I really said this just because I couldn&acute;t find any better
words - and yes, I know what you think of me now)<BR>

<BR>Because of the sudden lack of creativity (as can be impressively seen
in the sentence above) I ought to come to the final words of this review.
The overall impression of <B>PacMan&acute;96</B> is that the game has a
very &quot;clean&quot; and efficient code with the advantages of great
stability and flexibility. It is strongly influenced by the original game
and does not use any really new features, for example no
2-player-simultaneous-mode. Thus it seems to be of quite &quot;low
quality&quot; for the standards of today. But I not only know that it was
planned to become so &quot;simple&quot;, I also feel that this is the best
way. A typical comparison of mine, just to make sure how strange my
thoughts are sometimes: when one tries to &quot;copy&quot; the <I>Mona
Lisa</I> and gives her lipstick, coloured lenses, another haircut and then
indeed a secuctive neckline, then at least the <I>original</I> attraction
will be lost. (it has to be determined by every reader himself whether this
comparison has any sense in any way or not)<BR>

<BR><B>PacMan&acute;96</B> is <I>AnyWare</I>. This means that the
programmers will accept not just money but also <I>any</I> other creative
gifts - the more crazy, the better. But mind you, as stated before, that
living animals do not apply to this - a fact that will make all defenders
of animal rights take a deep breath. And as said above the game can be
found in the glorious <A HREF="http://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/aminetbin/find?pacman96">Aminet</A> archives.<BR>

<BR>Now to the most difficult task: the scores!<BR>

<BR>Of course it is not easy to judge over a game which really has to look
like the original and can only walk on new pathways of system-friendly
coding, not on the ones of great graphics or animations. The animations are
very much like the original which means that the are extremely simple. I
will have to find a way in between, a way that includes both points of
view. So my judgement must be considered as my personal one and taken with
care (like the game itself, because the programmers do not take any
responsibility for any kind of damage it might cause). Nevertheless I want
to state clearly that <I>PacMan</I> should be an essential part of every
household and more important than the phone; that <B>PacMan&acute;96</B>
should be the first choice of all <I>PacMan</I>-clones; and that our
parliament should for the first time do something cool and create a law
that forces all people to possession and daily usage of
<B>PacMan&acute;96</B>. So that the little yellow eater can do what Pinky
and Brain try to do every night. :-)<BR>

<BR>And finally coming back down to the level of reality and reason:
<B>PacMan&acute;96</B> from <I>Alcatraz Entertainment Software</I> must be
highly recommended. Get it!<BR>
