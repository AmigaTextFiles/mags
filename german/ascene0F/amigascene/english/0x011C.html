<BR><H1 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>ArtEffect 3.0 - graphics aftertreatment like Photoshop</B></FONT></H1>&nbsp;

<BR><FONT SIZE="+1">So, this is now the third article about ArtEffect in
the AmigaScene; there always are new versions of this beloved Image
Processing program on the Amiga. This is naturally a positive sign in a
time where one is always anxious if there will ever be new versions of
Amiga programs.</FONT><BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="01" HREF="#00"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#02"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR>This time it's about version 3.0, which compared to the previous 2.6
has no revolutionary changes or enhancements, but a few practical and
useful new things, and it's these we want to cover in this article.<BR>

<BR>The program is delivered on four disks, and installation was without
problem. The handbook is still that of version 1.1. All additional
functions are completely covered in the installed AmigaGuide.
Unfortunately, there's still no online help in the program itself, so the
Help key is rather redundant. In any case, there are help bubbles which
give a short tip on the various tools in the tools window when you move the
mouse pointer over them.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="02" HREF="#01"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#03"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>A quick overview of image processing</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>Although we can't and won't go into an exhaustive introduction in image
processing on the Amiga or ArtEffect specifics, for those that are
interested but are not familiar with image processing programs, a short
explanation of this topic.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="03" HREF="#02"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#04"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR>The customary pixel-based paint programs - the best known is surely
DPaint - is well understood by every Amiga user. Pictures are mainly drawn
or painted with such programs. In their heyday, it was also a
characteristic of these programs that there were only a limited amount of
usable colours available on the screen simultaneously, due to the
limitations of the hardware earlier used. Despite this shortcoming,
talented artists could and can achieve quite astounding results with such
programs, by careful colour selection and combination.<BR>

<BR>Later, as these colour limitations slowly disappeared with better
graphic cards and greater computer memory capacity, paint programs with
so-called &quot;True Colour&quot; came into being, that is, pictures that
could be created with 65 thousand or 16 million colours. In contrast to
&quot;True Colour&quot; painting programs the other is called &quot;palette
based&quot;, because they work with a so-called colour palette that
represents a selection from the total available colours.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="04" HREF="#03"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#05"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR>Once the colour limitations were lifted, further areas of use came into
being. You were no longer required to draw everything by hand, but could
suddenly very easily transfer photographs without any considerable quality
loss into the computer. Naturally, there were unthought of possibilities.
Naturally, pictures could later be very simply altered with True Colour
paint programs. With True Colour pictures, you can accomplish entirely
different operations rather than just a little painting around. You could,
for example, colour correct specific areas, lighten, darken, retouch, etc.
Everything that earlier only a photo laboratory could handle and much more
is today be within the power of an image processing program. And now we
have reached the theme. Image processing programs are specialized mainly
for the manipulation of existing pictures. You can still paint freely with
them, but most are used with pictures from various sources such as those
scanned-in or photographs from a digital camera or artificially rendered
pictures. You can, for example, repair damage in photos or composite
elements from different pictures into a new one.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="05" HREF="#04"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#06"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR>If you should now suddenly realize that for a long time an image
processing program is just what you needed, or perhaps you would like to
try for yourself what the author in the previous confusing sentences has
tried to clarify, then simply download the demo version of ArtEffect from
the <A HREF="http://www.haage-partner.com/">Haage &amp; Partner
homepage</A>.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="06" HREF="#05"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#07"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>Support for palette based pictures</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>A new feature has appeared in ArtEffect 3.0 that converts True Colour
pictures down to greyscale or palette based pictures from 2 to 256 colours.
An optional Floyd-Steinberg dithering routine to improve quality can be
utilized. Other dithering routines are not supported however. Such palette
based pictures can also be further processed in a restricted manner with
ArtEffect. Simple operations such as mirroring, scaling and rotation are
also possible. Most of the painting tools can also be used in a very
limiting way with such pictures. Working with masks is in any case not
possible with greyscale or palette based pictures.<BR>

<BR>This feature is especially useful when one needs a picture for the
Internet. Such palette-based pictures can now be saved in GIF format, with
a colour depth of 1 to 8 bits. Transparency is also supported.<BR>

<BR>Likewise, they can be saved either in ILBM(IFF) or PNG format. Only
colour depths of 8 bits are used for these, which altogether doesn't seem
to make much sense. If you have a picture that you have, for example,
reduced down to 4 colours, then you should be able to save it as an ILBM
with a colour depth of 2 bits (equals 4 colours). This should be something
for the next version. In the meantime, this has to be accomplished with an
external program.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="07" HREF="#06"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#08"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>Further possibilities with layers</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>Layers are a very useful feature. One can imagine these as clear
plastic sheets that lie over each other in a certain order. Drawn elements
on overlaying layers cover parts that lie underneath. A layer doesn't
necessarily have to completely conceal underlying layers, as the layer
itself and the colours applied to the layer has an adjustable opacity. Each
layer can be modified and painted independently to each other. There is now
no longer any artificial limitation on the number of layers. Naturally,
there is a greater demand for memory for each additional layer. In
addition, the demand for computer power increases. As well, it is now
possible for drawing elements of overlaying layers to cast shadows on
underlying layers. These shadows are automatically rendered, and can be
switched on and off at any time, and the opacity and position of the shadow
can be set as well. The layers can also be moved around against each other,
and subsequent placement or shifting of picture elements that lie on
different layers are possible at any time.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="08" HREF="#07"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#09"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>The brushes have a few more features</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>You can vary the size of the brush dependent on pressure (especially
interesting for pressure sensitive graphic tablets) or randomly during
painting. The defined sized is the maximum size, which becomes smaller as
pressure is reduced. The minimum size can be set as a percentage of maximum
(100%), which determines the intensity of the size variations.<BR>

<BR>A further effect of the new brushes is the possibility to set a
specific spray behaviour. This means the colour pixels won't necessarily be
applied under the tip of the mouse pointer, as is normally done, but
randomly within an adjustable radius. This is the same effect as the spay
can in the paint program DPaint.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="09" HREF="#08"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#10"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>New in filters</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>Of course the filter modules, with which one carries out different
effects and changes to the image, have been expanded and improved. A new
addition is the deinterlace filter. With the two fields you get from a
freeze-frame of a video picture, a flickering picture will be seen with
moving scenes. This situation is caused by the interlace sequence, which is
used in television. The flickering pictures are always only either the odd
or even lines being displayed. Every second line is skipped. Because of the
movement of the displayed object between the two fields, you get two
slightly different pictures over each other. The deinterlace filter
generates a new picture from either the odd or even lines without the
flickering. It is not simply that every second line is just left out and
replaced by the neighboring line, but an interpolation between both the
fields is performed.<BR>

<BR>In addition, the caricature and gaussian filters are now faster and
have new options.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="10" HREF="#09"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#11"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>Improvements with graduated colours</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>Art Effect now lets you define very nice colour graduations. You can
set the colour value as well as transparency. To set this, you basically
have a frame which represents the whole graduation, in which various
keypoints are defined that have a specific colour value assigned to them.
An example of such a graduation is included with Art Effect, &quot;the
Rainbow&quot;. This is accomplished using the key colours red, yellow,
green, cyan, blue and magenta. The position of the key points can be
changed at any time, and numerical entry of the positions are also
planned.<BR>

<BR>Transparency can be set by the same procedure with an alternate
frame.<BR>

<BR><H3><B>Internal improvements of version 3.0</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>There aren't only new functions, but also improvements in the program
itself. There are reduced memory requirements, which can be a deciding
factor with the use of many layers. Also the refresh operation has been
changed and is performed asynchronously to drawing.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="12" HREF="#11"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#13"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>Summary</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>The program gives all in all a very stable and practicable impression.
However, my tests with scaling a greyscale picture seemed sometimes an
endless operation.<BR>

<BR>To some extent you must have a computer with an MC68060 processor and
plenty of memory for any serious work. Also a fast harddisk is advisable,
as virtual memory is used due to the program's high memory demands, where
data always has to be exchanged between the harddisk and memory.<BR>
