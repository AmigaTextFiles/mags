<BR><H1 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>ProTracker - the History of a Legend</B></FONT></H1>&nbsp;

<BR><FONT SIZE="+1">We write in the year 1999, and the Aminet is inundated
like never before with MODs and more recently MP3s - these are small in
number, but with quite remarkable filesizes however. But all-in-all, how is
it that the MOD format, which was invented by deep-scene Coders (not
wanting to put down anyone), still hang on? It's a long story, almost as
old as the Commodore Amiga herself. And exactly 9 years ago, in May 1990,
the ProTracker was born at last on the Amiga.</FONT><BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="01" HREF="#00"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#02"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>SoundTracker</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>In 1986 <B>Karsten Obarski</B>, whose trademark was as musician with
&quot;reLine&quot; (Oil Imperium, Traders), found that chip tunes and
sample loops really weren't the final solution for the insight of computer
musicians, and began to develop a program on the basis of samples, which
would make simple composition of music pieces possible, in that samples
were used as instruments, with 4 channels (tracks, hence the word Tracker)
available - with this, one could really make a start. The program
<B>SoundTracker</B> V1.0 wasn't sold in as great the numbers as the number
of copies that were around shortly thereafter - yeah, there were plenty of
crackers, and why pay when you could get it by some other means?<BR>

<BR>Soon there were umpteen versions of this program around and in the end
Karsten gave up developing the program further. Understandably, who still
has any interest when your own program creation is not sold, but instead
widely stolen and disassembled?<BR>

<BR>Even though by today's standard SoundTracker was anything but
comfortable or usable, it quickyly obtained a high degree of popularity and
the program became quite widespread. It could already load 15 instruments
as samples and the format was suitable for the fundamentals of MODs of the
time.<BR>

<BR>SoundTracker V1.1-V2.3 were the work of various groups, in particular
the following: <B>Dr. Mabuse/D.O.C.</B>, <B>T.I.P./The New Masters</B>
(responsible for the TNM-Coder and probably also the Floppy Disk Destroyer)
and MnemoTroN/Spreadpoint. At the same time as the mysterious &quot;Version
II Professional&quot; SoundTracker from Marco Nelissen, which should be
given no special meaning, <B>Andreas Tadic</B> (Team 17) attempted
something with the <B>Games Music Creator</B>, which also stole a few ideas
from SoundTracker.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="02" HREF="#01"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#03"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>Noise Tacker</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR><B>Mahoney &amp; Kaktus</B> hit upon a huge success with their <B>Noise
Tracker</B>, which was based on SoundTacker version 2.3. Firstly, you could
work with 31 instruments, and there was a seperate screen for
configuration. The popularity of NoiseTracker was so enormous that even
<B>MnemoTroN/Spreadpont</B> couldn't make a comeback with newer versions of
SoundTracker (V2.4 and V2.5).<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="03" HREF="#02"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#04"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>ProTracker - Part I</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>While NoiseTracker was enjoying an ever-growing popularity, the still
relatively unknown <B>Amiga Freelancers</B> began at that time to take
apart and improve the code from SoundTracker - what eventuated was
<B>ProTracker</B>, with numerous new bugs and (!) features, the consequnces
of their work of which Mahoney und Kaktus had well only dared to dream.
ProTracker now became the de facto standard, and you see once again that
only products with many bugs and features do catch on! ;)<BR>

<BR><CENTER><IMG WIDTH=296 HEIGHT=236 ALT="[ProTracker V1.3]" SRC="../images_0F/pt_v13tn.jpeg"></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR>Despite all this, for the Amiga Freelancers it was at some time all too
much, and they publicly released the source code to the Internet. That was
at the end of 1991; later another two versions came out, but after this it
was more or less the end (from the point of view of ProTracker).<BR>

<BR><B>Mushroom Studios/Noxious</B> developed V1.3 further and corrected a
huge amount of bugs, also added a few meaningful features to ProTracker,
but gave up with it again relatively soon, when at the beginning of 1993
<B>Cryptoburners</B> came out with V3.0.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="04" HREF="#03"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#05"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>The Competition</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>Meanwhile, MnemoTroN/Spreadpoint tried to win us over with a new
variant of SoundTracker (V2.6). The special feature of this version was
that the patterns (sections of a module) comprised not of 4 tracks, but
every track (channel) had its own pattern. IMHO an excellent idea that was
often discussed in specialist circles but didn't find many supporters.
Well, I'm no expert in this area, so I have nothing I can really say, but
nevertheless I find this variant somewhat more flexible.<BR>

<BR>A short time later <B>Exolon/Fairlight</B> surprised the world of the
Amiga Sound Wizards with their self-created <B>StarTrekker</B>, based on
NoiseTracker V2.0, which permitted you to compose with eight (!) voices.
Actually, Chris H&uuml;lsbeck and Jochen Hippel also did this quite nicely
with the TFMX Sound System. Then there was also a special version of
NoiseTracker (1.3D), which could compress, just like IceTracker
(SoundTracker 2.6 offshoot), Audio Sculpture (StarTrekker successor), and
at some stage trackers started to get worse and worse, in operation at
least: OctaMED, QuadraComposer to name but two examples.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="05" HREF="#04"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#06"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><H3><B>ProTracker - Part II</B></H3>&nbsp;

<BR>Back to the history of ProTracker. Mushroom Studios/Noxious gave up in
the end, even though many people didn't want to know anything about the new
ProTracker version from Cryptoburners. The main reason was really the
change from PAL LoRes (320x256) to PAL HiRes (640x256). All a question of
philosophy. Now we come to a point where ProTracker took different paths.
Some prefer the version from the Amiga Freelancers and Noxious, others the
version from Cryptoburners and Osiris. But we'll get to Osiris later.<BR>

<BR>At some stage the Crptoburners supposedly (!) placed the source code
directly into the hands of <B>MAW</B>, who attempetd to acheive 14 bit
quality with DYN samples. He also programmed an editor that supported more
than 4 voices, sound synthesis and 16 bit samples! AFAIK he could't
complete his work, and after a long, long delay, at last <B>Tom Beyer</B>,
who himself alternated between both versions of ProTracker (the versions
from Cryptoburners and Noxious), decided to program his own version.<BR>

<BR>In 1996, he made public a few versions under the title of
<B>Osiris</B>, and in 1997 even attempted an 8 channel version with many
new features, but it seems he may have given up in the meantime. For the
time being, V3.61 remains the last official and non-beta release of the
most popular tracker in the World. And that ends our little history
lesson.<BR>
