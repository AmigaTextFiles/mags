Team Happy present Amiga Tomb Raider  Nov '97

At last! The *only* version of the Amiga
replacement engine for the PC version of Tomb raider!

Firstly. it is for real BUT you are gonna need one
hell of a machine to get it working on!

These are the specs:

040 Processor
AGA or CyberGraphix graphic card
PowerPC Processor
8 Megs Minimum Fast RAM (Still needs 2 MEGS CHIP RAM)

Also of course you need a PC version of Tomb Raider!

Instructions
************

To get Tomb Raider working on your Amiga you will need
to put all the PC Tomb Raider files onto your HardDrive.
This of course means the animations - but there is
a option in our program that can skip these.

These files should be put in a drawer called TombRaider
or something like that.

After this, you need to look in the actual Amiga Tomb
Raider drawer and move the contents from LIBS into your
Workbench LIBS. Move the contents from DISPLAY into
either DEVS: OR keep them in the Tomb Raider PC drawer.

REMEMBER if you have an AGA only machine just use the
AGA.driver. If you have a Graphic Card use cyber.driver AND
AGA.driver.

Then copy the drawer called XLS into the PC Tomb Raider
drawer.

Finally place the file called "AmigaTombRaider" into
the PC Tomb Raider drawer and click it (or run from
shell). The screen will come up telling you whether
your Amiga will run tomb raider or not. Hopefully,
if your Amiga is good enough it will work -if not
it will report back toyou saying one of the requirements
are not there.

How does it actually work?
**************************

Well the main PC Tomb Raider engine is completly re-written
and NO original code was used whatsoever. It all started
of for a little PD game that was a bit crap but was looking
like Tomb Raider. Then someone from our group said " We
arn't gonna make a game outta this - lets make a replacment
engine to make it work on the Amiga!"

And so we did!

We got it working on a PowerPC-less A1200, but it was
SO S-L-O-W. It was moving at 1 Frame per 15 seconds on
a 040 and 1 frame per 10 seconds on a 060 (probably would
have gone faster if we coded it better though). Then we
re-write some of the code and converted it to PowerPC
and it runs really smoothly - on the lowest spec PowerPC
and a 040 it ran fall speed!

In the future we may try and get a version going just for
040-060 Amigas (so you don't need PowerPC) but we all have
full time jobs now and we don't have time to update it.

By the way, over 8 Months, there were 7 of us working on the
engine - 3 coding the main engine, 2 on the XLS files, one
on the Graphic Drivers and one on the Libs.

Also the XLS files were something we made up to get them working
on the Amiga. They are shrunkened versions of the orginal
2000k Files. yikes!

We havent got an e-mail address, but if we do, we will put it
on the next version(if we make one)

Good luck - You will need it!
