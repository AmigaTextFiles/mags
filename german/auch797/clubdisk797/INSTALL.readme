iX-Guide 0.7d installation
--------------------------

Just copy all the files and directories into the same drawer.

It is recomended that your insert somewhere in your starup-sequence
or user-startup the following line:

'path <drawer_where_iX-Guide_is_installed>'

If you have 'userinfo' utility installed (you can find it on Aminet
- ui125.lha) then edit ixg.prefs file and change UIPATH to path where
your userinfo is installed.
