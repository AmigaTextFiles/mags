<BR><H1 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Interview - with Ganja / Nerve Axis</B></FONT></H1>&nbsp;

<BR><FONT SIZE="+1">This time the AmigaScene decided to invite Marcus
Castren AKA Ganja/NVX to an interview, covering the future of the Amiga,
the scene and other interesting facts for us Amiga-users. As you may have
already noticed, this file is completely written in English and maybe one
day the complete AmigaScene will be. We will see. And now enjoy the
original interview...</FONT><BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="01" HREF="#00"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#02"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>AS:</B> Would you like to introduce yourself first?<BR>

<BR><B>G:</B> Yeah, hi y'all! In the scene people know me as Ganja and I'm
a member of Nerve Axis-demo group. My main function is being a musician.
People might remember me best from the demos &quot;Pulse&quot; and
&quot;Relic&quot;, but there are several other productions I've been
involved with too.<BR>

<BR>At the moment I'm 20 years of age and waiting for the Finnish military
service to begin in January (eugh!) - so yes, I live in Finland :). I don't
study anything yet, but work in a new-media company in Helsinki. And that's
all you are allowed to know.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="02" HREF="#01"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#03"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>AS:</B> How and when did you enter the Amiga scene and what happened
since?<BR>

<BR><B>G:</B> I got my first 'miggy in 1989 which was an A500. I've always
been very interested in the demoscene and what happened there. I've
&quot;followed&quot; it since 1990 and finally entered it in 1992 when I
got a modem and was able to be in contact with other people more easily.
I've been composing tracker music also since 1992. I've had a rather low
profile until 1995. Before joining Nerve Axis I've been in groups like
Delusion and Mystic.<BR>

<BR>When asked about why I joined the demoscene I really can't tell you - I
don't even know myself. Just that, the whole thing has always fascinated me
a lot and I've always wanted to be a part of it.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="03" HREF="#02"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#04"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>AS:</B> Can you tell us something about &quot;Nerve Axis&quot;?<BR>

<BR><B>G:</B> Nerve Axis (NVX for short) is a UK-based demo group which was
born in 1992, but I just found out that the old NVX was also involved in
the cracking scene, but it's not been so for ages. Anyway, we also have
members in other countries like Finland and Iceland. I joined NVX in 1995,
but we've not been very well known until 1996 when we released a diskmag
called &quot;Pressure&quot;.<BR>

<BR>Nerve Axis is kind of going through its second era as there's only one
original member left in the group (who quit for few weeks but couldn't live
without being away ;) ). Also, NVX is probably the only UK scene group left
at the moment - and the only quality one since Anarchy ;).<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="04" HREF="#03"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#05"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>AS:</B> &quot;Relic&quot; was really awesome - can we expect more
from NA?<BR>

<BR><B>G:</B> Most certainly. There's something planned already for the
Party 8 in Denmark this Christmas. The only reason for us releasing so few
productions per year is that we only have one coder and big productions
like Pulse and Relic take a lot of time to finish (Relic was 8 months) and
we want everything to be top notch.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="05" HREF="#04"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#06"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>AS:</B> How many MODs have you ever composed? Which ones are your
fav's?<BR>

<BR><B>G:</B> Oh that's a hard one. As far as I've kept the record, I've
made about 250 *finished* modules. If you'd include all the
unfinished/unreleased ones it would be another 250 more.<BR>

<BR>There aren't many that I could call favourites as I'm only starting to
get satisfied with the mods I made this year. Some my top picks would
certainly be &quot;My Fluffy Angel&quot; which was 4th at the Spoletium98
party in Italy, &quot;Coffeeshopping&quot; which I made for our diskmag
&quot;Pressure #2&quot; and &quot;Sweet Things&quot; which was made for
&quot;Scenetime #12&quot; diskmag.<BR>

<BR>The most popular tracks have also been the modules from our demos Pulse
and Relic as I've had a huge amount of requests from people wanting them.
If you're after any, some of the best ones are on Aminet.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="06" HREF="#05"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#07"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>AS:</B> What do you think of the Amiga's future?<BR>

<BR><B>G:</B> Well, it's a bit confusing at the moment. It looks somewhat
bright but then again even more dark. Surely it's nice to see AI actually
doing something for a change, but I don't know what's gonna happen to this
&quot;Classic&quot; Amiga platform.. If the OS5 won't run on it I think
it'll die sooner or later and so will the Amiga demoscene as people stick
rather strongly to the 0x0s.<BR>

<BR>I'm willing to wait for few years to see what happens as I've put quite
a lot of money to upgrade my hardware and as long as there are active
sceners I've no reason to leave.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="07" HREF="#06"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#08"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>AS:</B> Which Amigas do you own and for which purpose?<BR>

<BR><B>G:</B> I got an A1240T with lots of hardware, though I still need a
few more things (don't you always?). I use it for making music, playing
some games sometimes. It also does the 'net well enough so I don't need a
PC for that either though all the plugins would be nice. Finally, I also
use it for HTML &amp; designing, but the only thing is doesn't do is image
processing where I have to use a PC :( - one more reason to upgrade for
me.<BR>

<BR><CENTER><A NAME="08" HREF="#07"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_li.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A><A HREF="#09"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=26 SRC="../images/_schraeg_re.gif" ALT=" " BORDER=0></A></CENTER>&nbsp;

<BR><B>AS:</B> Finally, what can be said about the Amiga scene today?<BR>

<BR><B>G:</B> Not a lot good actually :(. Like the most things that become
more popular, people start making money with it and the real meaning is
lost sooner or later. This has happened with the demoscene as well. It's
now very commercial and that shows! Party organizers are money hungry
sh*theads who don't care about the &quot;sceners&quot; or the real feeling.
This is also visible in the grouplife as most groups don't release anything
outside a party except for diskmags (thank heavens for those) and it's
mostly because there's a catch - money. Why release a cool demo just anyday
when you can score some extra buck with it? Of course there are exceptions
too.<BR>

<BR>The productions themselves have also changed a lot. Some say it's bad,
cos nowadays you don't see many effects other than 3D stuff. The demos and
intros have kinda lost their original meaning, but this is very much due
the commercialism.<BR>

<BR>So that's how it is today - I don't want to guess how it looks
tomorrow. :(<BR>

<BR><B>AS:</B> Do you have a picture of yourself?<BR>

<BR><B>G:</B> Yes, attached to this mail.<BR>

<BR><B>AS:</B> That's it. Thank you for the interview, and may the Amiga
live long and prosper! :-)<BR>
