Greetings all,
<P>
Issue 16 of The Amiga Informer is now available at all our retail
dealers. To get an issue, you can either contact one of the dealers
listed in every issue of The Informer and on our website, or call us
to subscribe.
<P>
You don't want to miss issue 16. We bring you inside information on
the recently announced OS 3.5 upgrade and what you can expect from
it. We also take a critical look at the work that needs to be done by Amiga
Inc. to get the ball rolling again. In addition to other recent news and
our usual columns like Workbench Enhancements, Caught in the AmiNet, and
Audio Adventures, issue 16 brings you a truck load of product
reviews. This issue evaluates 13 products, including; Wildfire,
EZ-VGA scandoubler/flicker-fixer, WebFTP, Picasso 4 review in
progress, Pablo II video encoder, Digital Quill, Soundprobe II,
Games Master System, Quake, Big Red Adventure, Virtual Karting 2,
A-Z of Amiga games, and Shadow of the Third Moon. Phew!
<P>
The Informer magazine is also happy to announce that it is now being
distributed in the UK and other European countries. Amiga Survivor
distribution is dispersing The Informer to shops throughout The UK,
Sweden and other countries. You can visit them at
