<B>GOODBYE AMIGA CLASSIC!</B>
<P>
Vulcan is finally closing the lid on Amiga (classic) software
development after half a decade of support! 
<P>
The decision to leave comes close to Vulcans 5th anniversary.
<P>
Paul Carrington states '..after much deliberation we switched off our
Amiga development systems at the mains, quickly wrapped them in brown
paper and hid them in the Vulcan vault! It's quite sad to see these
babies being turned off but it is something we all knew was inevitable
(and perhaps long overdue).'
<P>
Since 1994 Vulcan has Developed and Published 10 Amiga floppy titles and
5 Amiga CDRom titles and currently has 2 more Amiga CDRom titles still
in production and nearing release.
<P>
I hope that our departure from Amiga (classic) software development does
not receive the same insulting and slanderous response as previous
departing companies had experienced, but our decision is based purely on
a commercial and financial level due to the current state of the
existing Amiga market. 
<P>
To show our loyalty to the platform (which was responsible for 
our companies success) we will remain as an active Amiga Publisher as
long as there are external developers out there creating exciting
products and require our services and as long as our Amiga distributor
still has an outlet to sell limited quantities of Amiga titles.
<P>
Vulcan has just released a limited edition Amiga compilation CDRom of
it's MiniSeries titles as a tribute to it's golden days and we can still
expect the Alien adventure 'Wasted Dreams' Amiga CDRom to be released
before Xmas 98 with Explorer2260 Amiga PPC CDRom scheduled for early 99.
<P>
Live Long & Prosper!
<BR>
