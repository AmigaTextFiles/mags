Dies ist ein englischer Text über Shapeshifter-Kompatibilitäten von Andreas
Etzrodt. Er ist im AmigaGuide-Format, so daß man ihn am besten auf diese Art
anschaut, wen die fehlenden Links bzw. die vielen Formatanweisungen nicht
stören, der kann natürlich auch bei APT bleiben.

@node "Why" "Why this list?"

 Why this list?
 --------------
 
 You may know that there are not too much games especially
 written for the amiga - also only some Jump&Run-Games are
 being converted from PC.
 
 But why not using SHAPESHIFTER to run the Macintosh-games
 that will never be available for Amiga-players? Here is
 the problem: Is my hardware good enough to play this game?
 
 So I'm trying to collect as many information as possible
 on the subject: What game needs what kind of hardware 
 (RAM, processor)?
 
 The version 1.0 of this list consisted only of *my* own
 games. Since V1.1 there are *many* tests from @{"other" link "Helfer"0}
 people.
 
 But if you want that I include some text from you
 there's no problem. Just send it to me. I will mention
 in a special chapter of this list that I got it from you.
 
 Send your game-text to:

 ***************************************************************
 * Important note: Don't get confused... there's another list  *
 * on the Aminet (mine was the first one) which is called      *
 * "ss-compa.lha". This is similar to my list-name:            *
 * "sscomplist.lha"... Not a good idea of the author, I think! *
 * Also I have to say that it covers much more games but only  *
 * the DEMO-VERSIONS !!!! Use *my* list and you won't get any  *
 * trouble, ok?                                                *
 ***************************************************************
 
 I can't be held responsible if you buy a game because
 I wrote it works and it doesn't work on your machine !!!
 
 Use this information at your own risk!!!
 
 
 This list is contribution-ware. This means that if you find it
 useful you have to help creating an unbeatable list of games
 and applications - "The Shapeshifter compatibility list".


 *My* games have been tested on:
 
 - Amiga 4000/040
 - Cyberstorm 040/40MHz
 - Cybervision 64/2MB
 - 18MB FastRAM
 -  2MB ChipRAM
 - Kick and WB 3.0
 - 6XSpeed CD-ROM drive
 - 260 MB AT HD on internal IDE-adaptor
 - 52MB SCSI-HD on A2091 with GURU-ROM V6
 - HD-Floppy
 - 17"-Monitor (82kHz)

 Shapeshifter has been used in the latest version 3.6.

@node "fragen" "Questions & Answers"

 Questions and Answers
 ---------------------
 
 I hope that someone out there knows how to answer these questions!
 
 Q: What do I have to do to use an ATAPI CD-ROM drive as an SCSI-
    Drive whit IDEfix? Some games (Super Wing Commander, Frankenstein,
    Deadalus Encounter...) really NEED an SCSI-drive!
    
 Q: Is "Al Unser Jr. Arcade Racing" running on the Shapeshifter?
    How?
 
 Q: Has anyone experience with the SCSI-CD-ROM drive "Pionieer
    DR-A10X". I want to buy it, but I'm not sure that it works with
    Shapeshifter.
