<b>1. Website Update</b>
<br><br>
We have unvealed our newlook TWF and Explorer 2260 websites in March with a
couple of nice pictures suitable for your workbench backdrop. The E2260
section has been brought fully uptodate so you know what to expect from the
game. Hope you like the new look. The M&amp;M site should have a new look by
the end of first week in April.
<br><br>
<b>2. TWF Opinion Polls</b>
<br><br>
The current poll we've been running asked the question:
<br><br>
With quite a number of ports of popular PC games currently being ported
to the Amiga platform, what would be your prefered option for TWF to do ? 
<br><br>
Just two choices this time, Game Ports or Originals.
<br><br>
The current scores are:
<br><br>
    - Game Ports 44<br>
    - Original Games 136
<br><br>
So a resounding vote in favour of original games development. We have no
plans at present to port other games anyway, we were just curious to know
what people think on the subject. :)
<br><br>
Another poll will be put on as soon as we can think of a new one.
<br><br>
