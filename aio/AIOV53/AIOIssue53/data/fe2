To Zip or not to Zip:{p}
There are two ways to format a ZIP disk; either like a hard drive
partition (RDB) or as a floppy.  Which to use?  Personally, I'd recom mend as
a floppy and here's why.  It's {italic}removable{noitalic} media, right?
HD partitions don't do so well on the sliding in and out a lot, but a
normal floppy sty;e format is a breeze or sessions where you're working
different ZIP disks.  Using them to run your PC emulator off of is still
no problem, and what's best is MultiFileSystem works perfect with it.
All you need is the right mount file, of which an Aminet search (or past
AIO issue) will provide.

Printers:{p}
Having recently upgraded from an HP550C to an HP932C, I had to use the
printer drivers supplied with OS3.5/3.9.  I found an odd little clitch
when printing from Wordworth using the printer's fonts; at the end of
each page there would be an extra form feed, ejecting out a blank page
for every printed one.  Never happened when set to use the computer's
fonts, and still happened with the Generic driver.  However, a bit of
experimentation revealed one nice solution...{p}
The driver for the 550C supplied with the Wordworth distribution works
perfectly fine on the HP932C.  So, if you use Wordworth stick with the
drivers supplid with it, or if you use some other program like Final
writer then try the drivers that come with that program first.{p}
Remember, this only affects Printer Font mode, not Computer Fonts or
Graphics use.
