There are multiple ways to play the game. The story mode is a one
player game which must be completed against time. There are four
islands to complete which each island divided into two phases and
each phase divided into five stages. At the end of the two main
phases you will be asked to free one of the nymph sister and to then
challenge the end of level boss. Those stages are different from the
normal ones. In the nymph level, for instance, you have only three
different coloured bubbles at your disposal but you can choose which
colour you want to launch. Unfortunately only three bubbles will
burst at one time while more rows are added to the top of the screen.
The purpose here is not to eliminate all the bubbles, but to reach
the nymph which is trapped on top of the screen. Hit her several
times and she will be free to go. The boss level instead is a
head-to-head game where you have to compete against the bad guy while
dealing with his special abilities.

The championship mode puts you head-to-head against the computer in a
set of three battles. During the game you will have the opportunity
to transfer some of your bubbles to the opponent screen by creating
and destroying big chains. While you do that the bars in the middle
of the screen will light up activating the Armageddon Mode. Each
player can now use their character special skill against the enemy.
For instance you could push the opponent wall down, fill the opponent
screen with more balls, etc.

Least but not last you have the deatmatch mode which is dived into
'Until Death' mode, a two human player version of the Championship
mode, and 'Target Or Die' where you could win either by freeing the
nymph on top of the screen or by letting your enemy be flooded by
tens of coloured bubbles.

I have really enjoyed playing this game. There is enough gameplay to
guarantee hours of fun in front of you Amiga. The plot in the story
mode is very basic and you will soon get bored of reading it reaching
the fire button to skip it. The championship and deatmatch mode add
longevity to an already  beautiful game and can generate hours of
fun, especially if you are blessed by having very understandable
friends. The graphics in the game are very colorful with nice
backgrounds, cute animations and lots of 'cartoony' characters. There
is also some Japanise humour in the game represented by the rather
funny facial expression of the bubbles or the way the main characters
express their anger or sadness. If you have a graphic card you might
also notice the slightly blocky look of the game.That is due to the
higher refresh rate of RTG screens. Gamers who play the AGA version
should not have this visual inconvenience. Also, I found rather
annoying the fact that I had to select the cd device and unit number
every time I run the game. I am sure Arcadia could have easily
allowed us to save the options selected.  The sound is what you would
expect in a puzzle game: loads of funny and silly effects accompanied
by a rather dull sound-track. The levels are pretty balanced, in
spite of the randomized level design which might leave you with the
chance to complete a level in just few seconds.

What is really important here is the gameplay. This game can be very
dangerous to your health due to the high level of  the 'addictive
factor'. Do not blame me if you notice that you have reached the
early hours of the day while kidding yourself with the 'just another
go and I'll go to sleep' statement. Indeed I love the tension the
game creates, especially when the bubbles are almost reaching the
ground level and you have just few second to find the right bubble
colour to gain more precious time. If there is anything I would like
to see in this game is the use of higher resolutions which would make
the graphic even more crispier. This is a great title; an experience
you must have.
