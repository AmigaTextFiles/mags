Well, we {italic}{bold}FINALLY{nobold}{noitalic} have a new Games
Editor.  His name is Vincenzo Morra, and for all you people who horde
fatcs, he's 33 years old, has had an miga for several years, and his
computer experience goes back to the ZX Sinclair and on upo through
the various Amiga flavors.  He's worked as a journalist for a long
running Italian Amiga Mag named Enigma Amiga Run asa their game
editor.  His system for reviewing games on is an A1200 PPC tower set
up that I'd almost give blood for, and he apparently has multiple
Playstations.

In other words, it looks like he's kinda qualified.

So, let's all welcome him aboard the AIO staff and wish him a nice
long stay.  He's starting things off with am interview you'll find in
the Articles section.

Now on a more sad note, our Utilities Editor Robert is suffering rom
that infamous dreaded condition known as editor burnout.  As such, he
has formally asked to be replaced, so once again I must send out the
call.  Robert will be missed, but if you want to replace him then send
a call out to general@aioworld.com.

Helloe Vincenzo, good-bye Robert.
