{pp}
This is the first new product release for PageStream in almost three years! PageStream
4.1 first began life as the Table Editor add-on, but it became clear from our customers
that this wasn't an optional feature in PageStream, but an integral part of every day
document design. So, the Table Editor has been scraped, and from its ashes arise the
newest release of PageStream with tables built right in! Feature:
