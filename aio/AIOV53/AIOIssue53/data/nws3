Mike Tinker has ceased development of the BoXeR, a new Amiga computer with
a mixture of the old Classic Amiga and the new standards including PowerPC, PCI
and more speed.

This is a sad day, the BoXeR would have made an ideal upgrade path for existing
Amiga owners a few years ago but unfortunately, events have overtaken the BoXeR
with new PCI boards for the Classic Amiga and faster PowerPC accelerators and
the developement of AmigaDE.
