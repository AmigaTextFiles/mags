If you're for some reason looking with envious eyes at Windows, this
is a little program that will probably end that once and for all.
It's more of a gag program and not really usable for anything other
than a little laugh (unless you're really serious about wanting a
shut down window, and who is??).

After you either launch, or attach the program to your favourite
start button application, the nice window you can see above in the
screen shot pops up and you can choose from the four options. The
first turning your screen black until you press the left mouse button
(this is naturally 20 times as fast to do on an Amiga than a real
PC), the second waits for ten seconds then display a couple of
pictures which anyone that has used a Windows PC will recognize, and
then it will allow you to turn off the computer by pressing the power
button. The last one being the best of all, allows you to reboot your
computer and then start in Shell mode, which requires some simple
editing to your startup-sequence and is explained in the manual.

Well, it works... and, well, what else does it need to do? (It is
limited on a graphics card equipped Amiga, but works under AGA and
ECS (I suppose), but seriously, does it matter?)
