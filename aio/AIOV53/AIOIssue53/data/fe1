While playing Payback I found a moment to give myself a break and
speak to James Daniels from Apex Design. Here is what he said.
{pp}
Vincenzo Morra - Hi James, thank you for your time. Can you tell our
readers something about yourself?
{pp}
James Daniels - I`m 23 years old and live near Banbury. I used
to work for Hewlett Packard in Edinburgh until I quit in March last year
so that I could work full-time on Payback. When I`m not working (which
isn`t a common occurance at the moment! :) I like to go out, listen to
music and play on the PS2.
{pp}
V.M. - Great. What was your first Amiga and how did you become aware of its existance?
{pp}
J.D. - My first Amiga was an A500 (with the Batman Pack). I was in my
early  teens at the time and my parents bought it for me for
Christmas. I had originally wanted a Sam Coupe so I was a bit upset
at first - but I quickly discovered that the Amiga was way better
than the Sam - or anything else for that matter!
{pp}
V.M. - So, what Amiga do you own now?
{pp}
J.D. - I have got an A1200T with a BPPC 040@25Mhz/603e@240Mhz, a BVision, 96 MB RAM and OS3.5.
{pp}
V.M. - What software have you developed for Amiga?
{pp}
J.D. - Before switching to C, I wrote 6-Tris, Fire Power, Frontal Assault and
Air Wars in AMOS and released them into the public domain. For the last
3 years I`ve been working on Payback.
{pp}
V.M. - Are you planning to develop for other systems (i.e. PC, MAC, etc.)?
{pp}
J.D. - A Mac port of Payback in underway (although I`m not doing the coding
myself). A PC version of Payback is also likely but whatever I do in the
future I`ll try to find some way for it to also be released on the Amiga.
{pp}
V.M. - Good! How did Payback come to life?
{pp}
J.D. - A friend of mine was working on a map editor for the PC version of Grand
Theft Auto at around the same time as I was deciding what my next game
was going to be like. It occured to me that there was nothing like GTA
on the Amiga and it was a style of game that was within the Amiga`s
capabilities so I set about writing a game based on the best bits of GTA
and a few extra ideas of my own. I originally thought it would take
about 18 months to write (which is much longer than any of my PD games
took) but so far it`s been in development for almost 3 years!
{pp}
V.M. - How many people were involved in the development of the game and what was your role?
{pp}
J.D. - The game has been translated into roughly a dozen languages, and there
were two people (a translator and a proofreader) involved in the
translation to most of those languages so I`d guesstimate there were 24
translators. On top of this probably about a dozen people contributed to
the soundtrack and a few more worked on the graphics. There were roughly
another 15 betatesters so in total about 55 people were involved in the
development of the game. I did all the coding, map/object/mission design
and sound effects, as well as about half the graphics.
{pp}
V.M. - It sounds like there are many people who are a part of Apex Designs?
{pp}
J.D. - Well, technically, I`m the only person who`s actually a part
of Apex Designs. All the other people either contributed their time
for free or in exchange for a copy of the game.
{pp}
V.M. - As I mentioned in my review I truly enjoyed the soundtrack of Payback.
How did it come to life?
{pp}
J.D. - Whilst I was still working at Hewlett Packard, I downloaded roughly 1.5
GB of MP3s from MP3.com, and I was very impressed with the quality of
some of them. I contacted the musicians responsible and they were more
than happy for their songs to appear on the game`s soundtrack because of
the free publicity it would get them.
{pp}
V.M. - Let's talk about Payback sales. I read somewhere that they
were not very good. Can you confirm that?
{pp}
J.D. - Yes, that`s true.
{pp}
V.M. - What do you think are the reasons behind that?
{pp}
J.D. - I think one of the main ones was that the game didn`t initially support
PPC processors. This was because I found it virtually impossible to get
hold of PPC card. However, I finally managed to get one a few months ago
and I've made a PPC update for the game (and I`ve also added Warp3D
support) so I'm hoping that this will improve the game`s sales. I think
another reason is that quite a few people assume that the game isn`t
their cup of tea without trying it first. I`ve heard stories from people
who thought this but ending up buying the game after trying the demo.
{pp}
V.M. - I have recently played Grand Theft Auto 3 on PS2. But I truly
enjoy Payback because it is very focused on playability, and that is
essential for the success of a game. In order to convince the people
who have not bought it yet, why don't you just mention three great
things about Payback?
{pp}
J.D - + It's great fun and it`s got very varied gameplay as you said.
+ It's expandable (there's already a dozen extra maps available on the
Apex Designs website) - so it`ll keep you interested for a long time.
+ It`s well supported (check out all the updates that have been released
since the game`s original launch - these aren`t just bug fixes (in fact,
the original version had very few bugs) - they add major new features as
well).
{pp}
V.M. - Any plans for a mission disk?
{pp}
J.D. - Possibly, although Payback sales would need to improve to justify
spending the year or so it would take to make a decent-sized mission disk.
{pp}
V.M. - Let's talk about the future. What can you tell me about Payback 2?
{pp}
J.D. - It`s a very, very long way off. Seriously though, there are several
other ideas for games that I want to make first so I don`t expect to
even start coding Payback 2 for at least 5 years! I can promise it`ll be
fully 3D though.
{pp}
V.M. - That is quite a long time. What is Apex Designs planning to do in the meantime?
{pp}
J.D. - There should be an announcement about our short-term plans soon. In the
long term, I plan to write the two other games (and eventually Payback
2) mentioned before - but I don`t want to give details of those yet.
{pp}
V.M. - After all those years of changes, promises, and buy outs many
people have lost hope in the Amiga coming back as an alternative
platform. What is your opinion? Do you believe in the Amiga Inc.
strategy?
{pp}
J.D. - I`m optimistic about the future of AmigaDE, although I do have doubts
about the long-term viablity of the AmigaOne. I certainly hope it`ll be
successful though.
{pp}
V.M. - Will you be buying an AmigaOne?
{pp}
J.D. - If it`s successful, yes.
{pp}
V.M. - As a developer, do you honestly believe that it is possible to
bring Amiga back to its throne?
{pp}
J.D. - I believe it`s possible that the Amiga will again be as successful as it
once was - but not in the same way as before.
{pp}
V.M. - So, where would you like to see Amiga in three years time?
{pp}
J.D. - On every desktop, PDA and mobile phone.
{pp}
V.M. - I truly hope so. Going back to your peronal life, what do you
see in your future?
{pp}
J.D. - In the long term, I`d like to becoming a successful games
developer, and it would be really nice to actually make some money as
well!
{pp}
V.M. - What is the latest music cd you have bought?
{pp}
J.D. - Radiohead's "Amnesiac".
{pp}
V.M. - What is the latest movie you have seen?
{pp}
J.D. - A.I. (Shame about the last 15 minutes.)
{pp}
V.M. - What is the latest piece of software you have bought for Amiga?
{pp}
J.D. - StormC 4.
{pp}
V.M. - What games do you like to play on Amiga?
{pp}
J.D. - I play Wipeout 2097 and Doom from time to time.
{pp}
V.M. - Do you own a game console? What games do you like in general?
{pp}
J.D. - I`ve also got a PS2. In general, I tend to go for FPS's and driving games.
{pp}
V.M. - If you were allowed to keep only on piece of software for your
Amiga what would that be?
{pp}
J.D. - The OS. Or is that cheating?
{pp}
 V.M. - Not at all. Actually, I quite agree with you. Thank you for
your time James. All the best!
{pp}
J.D. - My pleasure.
