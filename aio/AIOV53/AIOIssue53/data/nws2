6.11.2001 AmigaOS4 Project Management
{pp}
Fleecy Moss: "Amiga is in control of OS4.0 - we have merely outsourced the project
management. I am in daily contact with Hyperion and a feature document and deadlines
 and timescales are mulled over in minute detail."{p}
"As I explained at the show, this deal is more about freeing Amiga up to work on the
SGA (Second Generation Amiga). AmigaOS4.0 was always more to do with getting a PPC
based OS working on very specific PPC HW, and we were wasting a lot of time bouncing
backwards and forwards. With the outsourcing agreement, the implementation has been
moved much closer to the first piece of HW itself."

 5.11.2001 AmigaOS 4.0 contract signed
{pp}
"Yes the contract was signed - and yes it was the real contract, not just a
mockup for publicity reasons" - Alan, Eyetech CEO
{pp}
Alan explained that the contract gave Eyetech, Hyperion, H+P etc the right to
develop os4.0. Amiga Inc will then take control of the OS back for a 'consideration'.
{pp}
Ben Hermlans, Hyperion: "'Consideration' is a legal term used in the contract law
of common law countries such as the UK and the US. It refers to the benefit (money,
action, transfer of property etc.) one contractual party can hope to receive from
the other."
{pp}
Ben Hermlans, Hyperion: "Stop whining please and get your ass to the Cologne show
[..] reserve judgement until that date."
