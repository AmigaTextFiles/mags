Review by Robert Karlsson

This is an extremely extensive database program for a wide variety of
science-fiction TV series and movies which include among a heap of
other Startrek, Startrek Voyager, X-Files, etc., etc. And all of the
featured series are nearly almost the newest episodes included that
have been aired or released (mainly in England), or can be obtained
on the Starbase website. The most important updates are also uploaded
on Aminet.

Installing the program and making it work on your system is very easy
and is done with an installer script. Altering the screenmode is easy
to do if you're not satisfied with your current settings, all you do
is hold down left Shift key when you run a database and the
screenmode requester pops up. The program itself is divided into
different scripts containing episodes of the series of your choice,
or you can run the program in its complete form, it then uses all
available databases.
{pp}
There is also a very elaborate search method used, you can either
type in keywords or simply clicking on  word to do a search in the
database you're currently looking at (using the left mousebutton) or
a global search (using the right mouse button), meaning you run the
search criteria in all loaded databases.

And for the real die hard Startrek fan there are settings to have the
classic Startrek beeps and sounds enabled while you run the program.
This does however get a little tiresome in the long run, so it's easy
to turn these functions off or on.

If you for some reason should find the content of Starbase to be too
scarce, you can also edit it by yourself by including the very latest
episodes, add your own screenshots or perhaps use the Starbase
inteface for your records or video tapes. This however demands some
skill, and is explained further in the manual. If you for some reason
don't like this interface that Starbase have, there are utilites
available to convert the databases into amiga guide format.

I really like this program, and find it very usable. It's a goldmine
for all science-fiction addicts out there, which I guarantee you will
be able to spend countless hours in front of your screen.
