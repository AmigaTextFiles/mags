Cloanto is proud to announce that it licensed both the "Picasso96" software
 from Alexander Kneer and Tobias Abt, and Brian King's "UAEgfx" Monitor
implementation, for use in Amiga Forever.
{pp}
A shareware version of Picasso96 has been providing RTG (Amiga retargetable
graphics) functionality to the emulation software which is part of Amiga
Forever since 1997. With the new license Cloanto would like to acknowledge
the precious contribution of the Picasso96 Team to the ease of use,
compatibility and speed which made Amiga Forever so successful, and further
contribute to the future development of the Picasso96 software. The new
license replaces the shareware status of the Picasso96 software included
in Amiga Forever. Support and upgrades will continue to be provided by
Cloanto as part of the Amiga Forever product. Read more
