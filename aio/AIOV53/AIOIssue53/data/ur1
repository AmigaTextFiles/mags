We all have to go through the nightmare of paying bills at one point
or another in our life, some rip their hair off and scream over the
huge bills and debts every month, and then there are those that take
it more mildly and pay in silent despair. Those that go through the
second mentioned method are very likely to be clinically insane; or
using Homebank.

Homebank is an utility made to help dampen the effect of the shock
that horrible time in the month when you most of all feel like
shooting your mailman and go berzerk at the tax office with the
nearest table spoon in the house.

Homebank has a very nice interface (depending on your MUI settings)
which is fairly easy to get acustomed to. If you are several persons
within the household you can also specify different "wallets", which
can also be password protected in case you prefer to keep your
transactions to yourself. Integrated in the program is the calculator
(this is the standard Workbench calculator), which can be quite
usable for persons that are less gifted in the fields of math. You
can specify different accounts, on which you edit the costs and
incomes that's drawn from your account, or the cash you spend and
compare them against each other to see if the final results add up,
or if you'll be forced to sell a kidney or two to be able to pay for
your leisures. You edit the accounts you've created simply by
double-clicking on them (or by pressing the appropriate button), the
results for all accounts, get graphs and bars of the total statistics
and costs. It's also possible to keep track of how much your driving
costs, you do this by specifying the amount of petrol you fill it up
with and what it costed and you get the results of how much your
driving has costed you a specific month.
{pp}
The easiest way to use Homebank is using the expenses or income
system groups and archives. Using these is either done manually or
automatically, under the condition that this is a regular expense or
income every month, you specify these easilly by creating them at
first, and then add the value to be decreased or increased every time
you activate this function, or specify when you want the
expense/income to be automatically added/removed from your figures.

The newer versions of Homebank come with an Euro conversion system,
this works by that you manually edit the exchange rate of the
currency, upon where you can view your costs and incomes in Euro
instead of your regular currency. However good this is, I think it
would be a nice feature to be able to connect to one of the many
currency converting websites on the internet for automatic currency
conversion in realtime at the click of a button, perhaps this will be
something to add to future versions?

In addition to the regular toolbars, there are also some to download
on the Aminet, which makes it a little more interesting and provides
some variation.

Homebank is a simply brilliant program which I really can't find any
flaws or annoying bits with, there are also regular updates which
makes the program better and better for every time there's a new
version out.
