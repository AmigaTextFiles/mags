Gee, 2001's almost over already?!  Well, I won't boar you with
Thank-Giving sites, especially since only those of us in the US seem
to have something like that and even then we'd be bored to tears ofer
roast turkeys.  So instead, I found an ecclectic variety to keep you
entertained and informed.  Enjoy.

{bold}Seeing Stars- The Ultimate Guide To Hollywood And Celebrities{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.seeing-stars.com/{noitalic}{p}
Want to know where the stars eat, play, or shop?  Care to tour the
studios or look up what is (or was) being filmed where?  Everything
you'd ever want to know about stars, Hollywood, films sites, and even
a few tips on how YOU might become a star (yeah, good luck on
{italic}that{noitalic}).

{bold}Culture Jammer's Encyclopedia{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.syntac.net/hoax/index.php{noitalic}{p}
Not a site I can describe in 50 words or less, but basically devoted
to showing how people can be manipulated, from campus pranks and how
someone conned the US Drug Enforcement agncy out of $65 million to The
Barbie Liberation organization, art forgery, and  religious hoxes. 
Easiest way is to jiust take 20 or 30 minutes out and check this site
out...  Then the next hour or so for the rest of it.  There's THAT
much there.

{bold}Cyborg's Amiga Security Page{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bridge/5737/Main/sw/security.html{noitalic}{p}
A continually updated site on security holes in Amiga Internet
software, what they are, and how to void or fix them.  'Nuf said.

{bold}History Of Amy The Squirrel{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://rigby-jones.net/ericschwartz/amy/{noitalic}{p}
The history, in pictures and words, of our favorite mascot- from the
point of view of the animated character as a real person (you mean she
isn't ?!).  You'll have to center the window though, as (on Voyager at
least) it comes out to something with eccessively large margins.

{bold}Ain't It Cool News{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/{noitalic}{p}
Going back through my list of reviewed sites, I just couldn't believe I
hadn't covered this site a long time ago.  I've had it bookmarked nearly
forever and go there all the time, so I guess in defense I can only
claim sporadic mental retardation.{p}
Disclaimer aside, this sitew is a must-bookmark for anyone into the
SciFi-movie scene.  Regular reviews of current films that give as
balanced an opinion as you're ever goiing to find (by {bold}real{nobold}
people no less), complete with making
sure you know what mood the guy was in when he reviewed it so you can
judge if his opoinion might have been colored.  Then to each there's
always the obligatory reader remarks to be posted.{p}
The main usefulness of the site though is in the sneak-peaks and rumors
long before anything is ever out.  They have spies everywhere in
Hollywood it seems, and so have had such things as reports from the set
of Lord of th Rings and X-Men long before either was finished filming.
The rumors are more accurate then most (Harry Knowles tries to get them
confirmed as much as possible), though never perfect, but if nothing
else good for wetting the appetite.  Any spoilers ar clearly noted so
you've only yourself to blame if you read on too far.{p}
It's a site meant to bring back the anticipation to coming releases and
films in the making that an old issue of Starlog used to give, to put
the {italic}fan{noitalic} back into fandom.  So, if you're a genre fan
of any sort, marking this site is a must!{p}
I'm just sorry I forgot to mention this a lot earlir.{p}
