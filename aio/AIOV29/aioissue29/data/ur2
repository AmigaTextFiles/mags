BackClock is another clock (Analog and Digital) that puts it's window on the WB,
with a difference to many others, it can be made transparent!
{p} {p}
The installation program is a standard Commodore installer script, choose the path
and language of the Guide (English, German, French) and then it's installed...
{p} {p}
One thing that is lousy IMHO is that you have to have a environment variable that
tells where the BackClockPrefs program is... Well, that's not so bad.
{p} {p}
I couldn't find any way to be able to start the prefs program, so I have to live
without it! Not a nice thing there, even tried SnoopDOS and such, but to no avail.
{p} {p}
Then I saw a program called BackClockDesigner, which is used to design the look
of the nails (arms) on the clock, this worked quite nicely, but when I tried to
remove the point, where the nail is supposed to spin around, the Mr. GURU(tm)
came to visit.
{p} {p}
But, enough about those things, let's see how good the actual program is...
Well, it does start, although it gives a CyberGuard hit right away (something
that the author really needs to look into)... But after that it seems to work
very well... Although I can't make out the numbers behind the clock, this could be because
I need to set something in the prefs program (that refuses to start)...
{p} {p}
After a thing that can be called an accident, I found out that if you press and
hold the left mouse button on the borders (which you don't see) you can move and
resize the window to whatever size you want!
{p} {p}
The documentation is very brief, but it describes how to use it in a nice way
nontheless...
