I'd like to thank everyone this month for their mail, but I still aim to
have a more bumper mailbag each month, so.... Do you have an idea? want
to complain about Gateway? want to praise someone or even just say hello
and birthday greetings then get writing.

Regarding AIO #28:  I really enjoyed reading the Bjorn Lynne
interview.  He is quite a legend and it was interesting to hear
how he started and what he's up to.
{p} {p}
It's also interested, and I think saddened, me with the news I've
been hearing about Gateway and Amiga, etc.  Not having all the
facts always leaves us shaky, but I generally agree with Chris'
"rants and raves about Gateway".  It is up to US to support what
is left of Amiga.  No producers are going to stay with Amiga long
if people aren't purchasing their products.

Whilst I unreservedly welcome the new AmigActive magazine I can't help but
wonder if this is a gamble doomed to failure. I don't know the gestation
period of a new magazine but it has evidently been dreamed up shortly after
the demise of CU Amiga and with the AmigaNG on the horizon ready to provide
for a new generation of Amiga fans purchasing the new machine. Sadly the
new machine does not appear to be a viable proposition and therefore the
main source of revenue for AA has been cut off before it really got going.
This is disappointing for all concerned as two lively and competing
magazines can only be of benefit to the whole Amiga community. The new
magazine appears to be well produced if a little thin but with plenty of
content. I particularly like the back2back articles. The only
disappointment for me was the CD with the 2 main software items, PPaint &
Octamed Sound Studio, having appeared on other cover CD's. PPaint 6.4 has
been superceded by PPaint 7 as far back as AFCD26, with the very same
version of Octamed on CUCD8 but there again if you haven't actually got
these programs they are both excellent value. I suppose it's down to
the lack of new software but the T-Zero Demo is fiddly to run as it needs
1.7MB+ to run which is not easy unless you have a graphics card.
All in all I rate it at 8/10 and hope to see an improvement in the future.
I've already placed my regular order at the newsagents and I'm pleased to
have 2 fixes a month instead of the one.

Hi,{p}
Great to see so much activity on the amiga scene!! Any info on how to hitch
up a 486dx to My A1200/50? I tried parnet, but no dice, as I think it has
to be run on both platforms to work. I don`t want to rely on loads of software
if it`s avoidable, is there a simple way?
{p} {p}
I`ll read the mag later, but at 2.28am gmt, I think for now I`ll just hit the
sack!!
{p} {p}
`bye for now
{p} {p}
mistral.

{italic}Parnet? I don't think parnet is out for PC's. Anyway, there is software
around to link PC's and amiga's using a null modem cable (I think there's
some free on aminet too ;),
{p} {p}
Infact you could just use terminal programs to transfer data.{noitalic}

{italic}The parnet cables only works Amiga<->Amiga .. you should use standard
laplink parrallel nullmodem cables, (or a standard serial nullmodem cable),
and a program like pc2amiga or twinexpress, or if you like you can use a
tcpip stack like Miami or AmiTCP/IP and a plip driver{noitalic}
