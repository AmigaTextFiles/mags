Hi, Dr Strange here (hence the column title), off from Web Wandering for
a bit to offer an opinion on certain situations. Since the last issue
events have turned completely upsidedown, having many wondering if there
is any sense in this world, and leaving little doubt that more
malevolent forces exist.
{p} {p}
First Gateway purchases the Amiga, and after much mulling around sees a
profit potential in the resurrection of our favorite machine. And
indeed there is; during a time of falling favor with the Wintel way of
life, the market is primed for an alternative and nothing is better
than a new generation Amiga.
{p} {p}
But then Amiga had a shakeup and Gateway changed their plans. With Tom
Schmidt at the helm again they dropped all ideas of hardware, said they'd
just do software, and then explained that they wouldn't even be doing a
real operating sytem, just an outline of one. No Hardware, no OS,
nothing that can be marketed.
{p} {p}
They DO want to make money, don't they?
{p} {p}
Their former plan had the potential to make loads of cash by coming in
at the ground level of the newly emerging market of Digital Convergence.
Their present plan earns nothing and just shows that they enjoy wasting
time, money, and effort. If they aren't going to DO anything with the
Amiga name and concept then why even bother with the company at all?
{p} {p}
At their present strategy they should just fold up the Amiga company and
sell off the whole lot to a consortium of INTERESTED developers that
will DO something with it.
{p} {p}
The only thing I can conclude is that either Gates is paying off Gateway
to keep the Amiga name busy and out of his hair, or that Gateway
management (and the current Amiga President) are just sadists.
{p} {p}
It's time to get serious about things, and rid ourselves of all these
sadists, plots, counter-plots, secrets, backstabbing, and all the stuff
of bad soap operas.  Gateway, if you can hear me, either get off you
dirty backsides and go forward with Collas' dream, or sell everything
off to an interested Amiga consortium and then stay WELL out of our way.
There is a new future here and SOME of us want to see it.
{p} {p}
And to any prospective consortium (including the Phase 5 bunch), I would
offer this advice. Get thee to mass marketing. A new generation of
Amiga will NOT survive on our small community; it MUST be brought to the
attention of the world in general and marketed in a way that will tempt
millions away from their staid computers of yester-year.
{p} {p}
That's my opinion and I do NOT appologize for being blunt. If I have
offended anyone then Good! There's no time left to mince words, we need
solutions NOW.
{p} {p}
And no excuses like "well, do you have any idea how long it takes to
design and market a new system?", because YES I do; REAL computer
companies manage to do it in substantially shorter times than the
Amiga's own glacial progression, so there's no reason why we can't have
a next-gen system SOON.
{p} {p}
You're out of excuses.
