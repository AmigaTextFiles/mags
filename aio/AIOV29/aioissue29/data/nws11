PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX Announces SViewIV (6/Oct/99)
{p} {p}
SViewIV is the direct successor of SViewII.  Nope, there's no version
3 - following a great tradition in Amiga products.
{p} {p}
Unlike all other updates since 1993 it won't be free for registered
users of SViewII, they will have to be charged again. This is to
ensure funds for further development of the program.
