RackRunner is a German version of an old classic game. Unfortunately the
old classic game I am talking about has escaped my mind and I can't remember
its name for the life of me.

The game is also a little like the Amiga game PPHammer in which you took the
role of PPHammer and had to bash through blocks, if I remember correctly
you had a certain length of time before these blocks regenerated and came
back. This is exactly the same case for RackRunner.

As I am writing this review it comes to me attention that I think the game
I am trying to remember the name of was called Blode Runner but I could
be mistaken so don't hold me to that.

Anyway enough of my rambling... on with the game. You take the role of a little
person who has to run around inside this pyramid collecting what looks like
crosses. The game isn't as easy as it sounds because some are hidden away
in other parts of the pyramid and the only way to access them is by throwing
your bomb things which remove the block directly infront/below you. You cannot
move more than one away so you have to be careful the way you get to the
cross otherwise you could get stuck and when the block regenerates you will
get sqashed and killed.

That is the whole idea of the game. It is very challenging and will keep
you puzzlers entertained for a long time, it has that classic feel and look
and is quite difficult. So difficult in fact I didn't get past the first
level.

Again this game is in German only as far as I can see so for you that don't
speak a word of German, F1 is for one player, F2 is for two players and
ESC will quit the game.
