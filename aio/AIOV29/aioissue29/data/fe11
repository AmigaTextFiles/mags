New Amigas, we keep looking for them. Phase 5 won't have anything out
for a while, and the I-Win machine has been prooven to definitely be a
hoax (confirmed by my sources). However, there is one outfit I've found
that is making something with what's out there.

The X-Machine is basically a Boxer in a custom I-Mac style looking
frame, coming in five different colors, it's made as a Video Toaster
workstation and sports a variety of slots and ports and can be equiped
with up to the G4 chip, or even the G7 when it comes out (yes folks, you
read right; G7 will be a G4 at 750 MHz).
