Yes. the cartoon we all love to hate has now made its way in some form onto
our Amigas. Yes... of course i'm talking about the adult cartoon, SouthPark.
No, don't get too excited it isn't a SouthPark game and its nothing special
but is worth getting for a laugh.

The idea of the program is you have a picture of cartman on your screen
and with a CD32 joypad only you can move him about, make him do certain
tricks, play a sound sample and even get him to play the "cartmans a
b***h" song.

Thats it...
{p} {p}
Yes Really....
{p} {p}
Its a gag, as the directory it is in on the aminet suggests, its nothing
less its nothing more... if you like southpark then take a look, if you
don't or you have small children avoid.
