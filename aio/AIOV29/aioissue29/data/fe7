Well, they've made the final announcement; 3.5 is due out on October 18,
or by the time you read this. Many questions have been raised by people,
concerning it's usefulness and actual need.
{p} {p}
How many bugs will it fix? Will it add any new things or just be a
compilation of the assorted hacks that we all have? Just how useful will
it be?
{p} {p}
Well, save your questions because- if all goes well (fingers crossed)-
AIO will have a review of the full 3.5 package (hopefully by next issue).
In it, I'll not only go over all the features, improvements, and add-ons,
but  will include something rather useful to all you hack-mongers like
myself: a complete list of which hacks and types of hacks are no longer
needed, which are replaced or improved upon, which ones you can now
forever leave out of your WBStartup drawer or User-startup.  I'll do all
the work, you'll get all the answers.

So, stay tuned, it will only get better.
