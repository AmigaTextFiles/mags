TView is a program that checks what's on TV... I reviewed an earlier version in
an issue not too far back, namely in Issue 25.
{p} {p}
I will quickly explain, read further in issue 25 to get to know more about it!
TView will connect to a server, for instance, www.dagenstv.com and get the
information on the channels that you have decided to check... It will then show them
in a list listed there...
{p} {p}
The installation is nothing to it, you will only have to extract the archive to a
place on your HD and then run the program, it will then automatically open the prefs
window since it's your first time... There you must set a few things, like what server
to check on, and ofcourse what channels you want to get info about... You can also
set a few other things, like what arexx script to run on Doubleclick, on start, or
on finished DL... It will default to run a script named GetNewTView.rexx on start,
this is a very nifty script that will check if a new TView is out, it nicely interacts
with the GUI (and is ofcourse written by me ;) )... Ah, enough about me... ;)
{p} {p}
It is also localized, it comes with the following catalogs, dansk, deutsch, francais,
norsk and svenska... It will also come with a German guide, but not in this betaversion..
1.0 will come later tonight, and will contain a german guide!

When you have gotten some data from a server, it will look something like this:

You can sort by Hour, by Channel, or even show all channels and all times at once...
Whatever you like the most...{p}
It will write the additional information of the TV show in the lower part of the
window when you mark one... It also have some nice features, you can search for
a given string and it will then show all matches in the list, or you can set a
alarm on one or more programs, it will then open a window 5 minutes before it
starts so you have time to make coffee or something!
{p} {p}
If, but I doubt, there is anything you don't understand, just press the HELP button
since it's a MUI program... Whoopps... I shouldn't have said that, since the TView
author haven't included that yet ;) I guess he will after he reads this tho'...
Well, if you take the unneccesery long way of opening the Guide, you will notice
a quite well structured documentation... It will guide you through TView in a few
minutes... It has a quite extensive part which describes the different parts of
TView...
{p} {p}
And since it's ShareWare, then what's the limitation, well, it will only show
half of the programs in the list, the others will just say Demo!
{p} {p}
You may think, should I really spend any time or money on this, well, you really
should if you watch TV more than 1 hour a day or something, because this will
make it so easy for you to find out what's on!
