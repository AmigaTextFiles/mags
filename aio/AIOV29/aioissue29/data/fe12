So many bad things have been happening to the Amiga lately you'd almost 
think it was a conspiracy, right?
{p} {p}
Hold that thought.
{p} {p}
The following is a summary of information obtained from, among other 
sources, someone who has a contact inside Amiga, as well as several 
dealers who been on the recieving end of some tactics from the home
office that would seem geared best to supress the Amiga instead of
promoting it. So read on... and hope it isn't too late.
{p} {p}
TO start, it's well suspected that Microsoft has been after the Amiga 
since Commodore went under; in fact, Bill Gates had some agents there
at the first bakruptsy trials submitting bids. They just didn't submit 
any really large bid lest they draw suspicion.
{p} {p}
Fast forward to the last bankruptsy and the Amiga refuses to die. 
Microsoft had been funding a research project for Transmeta to develop a
new "super" chip; one that could handle graphics, sound, and have an OS
at under 2 Megs RAM. A couple years and 3 billion dollars and they still 
couldn't do it. Then along comes the Amiga, once again up for sale.
{p} {p}
Amiga, the one computer that's been able to do ALL Microsoft was after, 
not to mention multitasking, but it wasn't in Gates hand and it had a 
fanatical following that would never stand for him having it. But, the 
Amiga must die, for the Gates Empire relies on the Wintel PC; there is 
NO room for anything else.
{p} {p}
Enter the Gates Plan.  A new emergence of the Amiga could threaten the 3 
billion dollar fiasco that is Transmeta, not to mention the rest of the
Dynasty (forget the point that Gates and Microsoft have enough cash to 
just coast for a century or two without earning another cent). So, they 
figure this; Gates' master plan.
{p} {p}
The Microsoft flunky Gates put in charge of Transmeta makes a deal with 
Gateway. Gateway buys the Amiga, announcing they will bring it back, and 
eventually putting one of their senior VPs in charge of it. The orders 
are to kill the Amiga but not quickly- that would instantly launch the 
entire Amiga Community into action. No, a slow death is the need. Pester 
the Amiga with mismanagement, set-backs, and a gradual loosing of faith 
by the Amiga supporters. The Amiga slowly dissolves into a quicksand of 
disinterest, never to return as all of it's supporters get bored and 
leave on their own. Things gradually fall apart, Collas quits with a 
tail of frustration, and no body has anyone to blame as Gateway sighs 
and finally folds of the Amiga.
{p} {p}
A short time later, Transmeta then comes out with their brand new 
"Super" chip; boasting sound, graphics, multitasking, and a 2 Meg OS, it 
sweaps through the PC world as a revolutionary invention of Microsoft,
while the rest of the world has forgotten all about the real computer
responsible for it all.
{p} {p}
Then, just what IS the rumored "Super" Chip?
{p} {p}
The Amiga.
