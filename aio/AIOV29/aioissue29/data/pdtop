FIRSTLY, I am very sorry for not being able to include this list in the last issue,
well, here it is, maybe for the last Issue... This is sad news for me, I really
thought that more than three people would vote, and they did previously...
{p} {p}
So, I will tell this, if the interest for this list isn't going up, then I don't
think it's a big idea to keep it going...
{p} {p}
Pretty please just take a minute or two to vote for your three favourite utilities!
Who knows, it might be that You find an util that you never thought could be that
handy, and someone else might also find some new utils! Now please show Your support!
{p} {p}
To send Your votes, send a mail to {bold}lorens@aio.co.uk{nobold} with the subject: {bold}AIO Toplist{nobold}
{p} {p}
If You vote, You must choose three utilities, You will give 3 points to the one You
like the most, 2 points to the second, and 1 point to the third!
