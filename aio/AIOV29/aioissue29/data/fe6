Well, here we are with the first real Hints And Tips column entry, and
already we have a submission fresh off our favorite mailing list. But
first, just a note about the nature of this column.
{p} {p}
In general, anytime a program is mentioned, it will only be in the
nature of an advisory. It is not the purpose of this column to review
any program, merely to point out what might be useful. It is left up to
the reader to download or buy said program and either read the
documentation that comes with it or consult a full review that may have
been published of it.
{p} {p}
That said, let's get on with the first tips.
{p} {p}
Directory Utilities{p}
Yes, there are still some of you that haven't tried out a good directory
Utility.  Be it Directory Opus, or the old DiskMaster (now available off
of Aminet), there are many benefits over both Workbench and Shell. The
Workbench is great, but if you have a program burried more than two
drawer layers deep, then waiting for all those icons to display can get
a little bit tiresome.  As well, the power of shell can only be accessed 
through a lot of typing.
{p} {p}
Enter a good directory utility. Clicking through a directory listing is 
much faster, and many shell commands- complete with your assigned 
default commandline arguements- can be slaved to the press of a single 
button. Never a complete replacement for the shell, but it can certainly
take up the slack for your most commonly-used commands.
{p} {p}
If you want to get more out of a multitasking command environment, then 
check out a directory util; if you're a power-user like some of us, then 
a directory utility is a definite must-have.

WarpOS and PPC
{p} {p}
One request off of Just-Amiga:
{p} {p}
Question:{p}
Can you describe a way to boot up so that you can choose between PPC
or WarpOS without lots of fiddling around?
{p} {p}
Two answers were submitted:{p}
1)  Try using the ppclibemul. With it you can run PowerUP and WarpOS
programs at the same time. PowerUP compatibility is fairly high
now, and many program for it run under the emulation [wrapper].

2)  You don't really, have to, as WarpOS switches PPC off
automatically. There is a BlizkiOS module that disables the PPC
lib, and you could just use Warpos and the PPC lib emulator.

    3)  Install the WarpOS PowerUP emulation
