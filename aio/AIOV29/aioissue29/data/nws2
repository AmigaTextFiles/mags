Stockholm, Sweden. Tuesday October 5, 1999.{p}
The AAA Awards, the Amiga Community's grand achievement awards, are in need of a new Information Manager to handle its Public Relations.
{p} {p}
What is it?
{p} {p}
As Information Manager, your job is basically to handle the AAA Awards' internal and public communications.
This includes:
{p} {p}
external information, such as press releases, web pages and print material{p}
"Art Director"{p}
prize design{p}
compilation of nominee suggestions
{p} {p}
When it comes to external information, a lot of templates and such exist to get you started, which also goes for prizes.
The AAA Awards have a webmaster handling the web pages, so your main role in web design would be as an "art director".
It might also be possible to split duties between committee members.
{p} {p}
The AAA Awards is a non-profit project, and thus no-one is payed for their work.
{p} {p}
Who are we looking for?

Anyone who can agree with these statements:{p}
I love the Amiga{p}
