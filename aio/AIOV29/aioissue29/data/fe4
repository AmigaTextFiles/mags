{subhead} Amiga Law Suit Part I{def}{p}
Article by Mark Tierno

{p} {p}

Well someone's finally doing it. The Amiga Dealer's Association (ADA)
is suing Amiga and Gateway in a class-action suit for breach of promise,
messing everyone up, and being general bad guys. The overall total seems
to be somewhat over 3 million dollars (US) and is aimed at making a
bunch of sore people feel better.
{p} {p}
Of course, this might sound all nice and fine to people, but I
personally see a little flaw in their plans that just might prove
troublesome (actually, a flaw you can drive a truck-load of PCs
through). Allow me to demonstrate...
{p} {p}
ADA: Gateway, we're going to sue you and Amiga.
{p} {p}
Gateway:  We're happy for you. But you may have noticed that Amiga is
now an independent company, so we really have no control over their
day-to-day operations. As such we can't be included in your law-suit. We
do wish you well in suing Amiga, but we're legally protected from any
involvement.  Have a nice day.
{p} {p}
Amiga (with Gateway wearing their hate): You're suing us? Well gee, we
don't have any money since we haven't actually SOLD anything yet, so we
can't cover your law-suit. I guess this means we'll have to declare
bankruptsy. Oh well, we're out of buisiness and you don't get any money
for it. Nice knowing you.
{p} {p}
Gateway: Hmm, seems our subsiderary went under. Oh well; I guess we'll
take back our patents and the Amiga name now. And since it seems as the
Amiga will never fly we won't bother to bring it back and in fact won't
even put it up for sale to someone else. We'll just sit on it for now.
Have a nice day.
{p} {p}
ADA: Wha' happen?
{p} {p}
Amiga User 1: You killed off the Amiga, you idiots!
{p} {p}
Amiga User 2: Get a rope!
{p} {p}
Of course, that's just my take on things. To develop your own opinion on
this, just keep reading. I've included below the full text of ADA's
legal filing, so look it over and see what you think.
