Connect is a small program written in ARexx, it's purpose is to start your TCP/IP
stack and also a few other programs at the same time, and also connect!
{p} {p}
You will have to specify the browser, TCP/IP stack and FTP client in the installation
program, the weird thing is that when you then start the program (after the installtion)
you will have to set these programs again...{p}
Also, it will only support Miami/MiamiDeluxe, so no AmiTCP/IP users here...
{p} {p}
But the worst thing (besides only Miami) is that you can only specify a browser and
an FTP client...
{p} {p}
It doesn't have any kind of documentation either, but that's not really needed in
this application...
{p} {p}
I would give one piece of advice, unless this is updated to suit more programs, it's really
kinda worthless... The only good thing is to connect and launch two programs with
one click!
