{subhead} Mushroom Software buyout F1 Software{def}
{left}
{p} {p}

Earlier this month, Mushroom Software has been in negotiations with Phil
Wilkinson to purchase F1 Software, and all it's other Amiga pieces,
including 5th Dimension Licenseware. Now that most of the smaller and
technical details have been taken care of, I can make this announcement to
the public.
{p} {p}
Now that I own the companies, I will be making a lot of changes to the way
it is operated. I will be adding a lot more titles to the collection, as
well as some good quality utilities. The collections have been weak in the
past when it came to utilities, and I also hope to start adding some
internet software to it's collection very very soon. I also want to sell a
lot more titles online, and I want to encourage my other distributors to do
the same. So far, I have experimented with eBay and found the response
quite surprizing. Visit our webpage for a link to our online auctions,
where you will be able to pick up some great software titles.
{p} {p}
At this time, I will be keeping the existing F1 distributors around the
world. There will be at least 1 new distributor set up within the next few
weeks in the UK, but I will give more information on that when everything
has been taken care of on this end.
{p} {p}
As I said above, I will be looking for new titles to add to the collection.
If you have a game or utility that you have been writing, and would like to
earn some serious cash, then feel free to contact me at the above email
address for more information. Author's do not have to live in just the USA,
I hope to recruit more programmers from around the world.

The mushroom Software homepages will now become the official home for F1
Software, and I strongly urge all of you to bookmark
{link http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk}http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk{end} and take a look at some of the games
available. Every game sold gives the programmer a large royalty, and our
prices are not high compared to some of the other titles available on the
Amiga market, which the programmers will most likely benefit from a lot
less.

If anyone has any questions or comments, please feel free to email me at

some demo software, please visit{p}
