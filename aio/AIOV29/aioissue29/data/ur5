WBJoyTest is a util to test if your joystick(s) is working or not...

There is no installation really, just copy it to wherever you want it to be, as easy
as it can be...

So, all you have to do is to start it and you will get a small little window on
your WB... BUT, there is alot more than it seems, it will play different samples
when you move the joystick, and another set of samples if the button is held down.
This can be set in the icons tooltypes, and you can also set the rate of the samples.

It comes with a very nice AmigaGuide document, much nicer than many other programs,
and this is yet a very small program, so that is very nice...
