Hello and welcome to another exciting issue of your favourite Amiga
magazine. I'd like to first start off by thanking everyone that has
so far returned the AIO readers survey but would also like to point
out that to all those who haven't yet received it to go and fill it
in now. It only takes a few seconds to fill in the text version in
this AIO archive or to fill it in online at our website. So go and
do it before you carry on reading this issue,

Right, if you've done that then thankyou so much, you really are helping
the continuation of AIO and if you haven't done it then think that
you could be helping kill off AIO by not showing your support. Again
thanks to everyone who has already filled it in.

The general Amiga front has been very quiet on a whole since the
announcement that the Amiga MMC project has been cancelled and little
or no word had left the Amiga HQ. Everything had been kept hush,
hush, probably because the main reason that us as a community are
angry for being fooled yet again. Like I said last issue though we
are survivors and the people who the current Amiga needs is (you may
find a shock)... you. I know I have already said in last issues editorial
but without us the Amiga will die and if we want it to we can make
it carry on. We have to be realistic that there are not going to be
any major changes but we should face facts that since the demise of
the original Amiga nearly 5-6 years ago little has changed which has
on a whole made the Amiga any different. We are still using things that
could be bought back in those days so why should we decide to leave
our computer now. I think a few Amiga users, maybe even you reading
this now will leave the Amiga in the next few months to a year but
on the whole I really hope that you will decide to stay.

I have said, don't think buying a PC is a sin, if thats what you want
to do then do it, people may frown at your choice but if you want to
buy a PC then do that but please stick with your roots and carry on
using the Amiga and supporting it as much as you would when the Amiga
was at its height. I am not planning to buy a PC and cannot see me
buying one because the simple fact that the Amiga is the computer I
enjoy using and it does the things I want, like I have previously
said, I miss some features that I see on PCs these days but can
live without.

One major factor that will determine the survival of the current Amiga
is if we support our authors or not. We, the Amiga community on
a whole are bad in most cases of supporting our authors, this has been
written about many times in other print magazines and I also agree with
it. If you like something and use it regularly then register it or tell
the author. I think there are a very small amount of authors who make
their software for the financial gains because they are realistic about
what they are going to gain that way. It is when we have someone who
makes a product and asks for no money and gets very little response even
though people are using that product many times.

My message for this month is support your authors... if you do not then
you will kill the Amiga.... its our choice... make it the right one.
