{subhead} GoFetch! Released to AmiNet{def}

{p} {p}

GoFetch! is an FTP client with a bit of a difference. Instead of
viewing a list of files and downloading them in one go, GoFetch! is
designed to download extremely big files over several days.
{p} {p}
The idea of it is that you don't want to download a 20MB file in
one call, at least not a BT rates.  With GoFetch!, when you call
your ISP to get your mail or do some browsing the program will
continue to collect your files, and will continue doing so over
however many calls and days it takes.

GoFetch! is available on AmiNet or Zeus Developments webpage at
