Here's an update on WebVision, a WebCam program that I reviewed in issue 28 (the
one before this one)... Has it been improved?

Well, I won't take any time on the installation or such, because it hasn't changed
one bit... The same goes for the documentation... This is only an update, not a full
review, since it got reviewed in Issue 28, and you all probably remember what I
said back then, and if not, read about it!

One very nice thing is that the author managed to fix a very annoying bug in the
listtree... It wouldn't always close the tree when it should and so on... This
was one thing that I hated very much about the previous version...
{p} {p}
Another nice new thing is that you can clone groups now... Very handy!
