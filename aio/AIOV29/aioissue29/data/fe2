Many words have been written, both to condemn Gateway and to bewail the
apparent demise of the Amiga. The unfortunate upshot of all the rhetoric
is the great spirit of the Amiga, a spirit of friendship and sharing,
has been turned into a spirit of blame and attack.
{p} {p}
How many businesses have you seen fail lately? Far too many, for sure.
Most of those businesses started with a good plan and optimistic goals.
So what caused them to fail? Many things caused the failure, from
unreachable goals to deliberate sabotage. To an outsider, the failure
was just that, no matter what the reasons. I do not recall seeing the
owners of those businesses hauled into the streets and flogged. People
just shrugged and said "Too bad."
{p} {p}
With Amiga and the MCC that is not the case. By the sounds of some things
I have read, there are those who want the principles at Gateway strung
up. They call for this punishment without the knowledge of just why
Amiga failed to deliver the MCC and was forced by Gateway to give up.
{p} {p}
Don't get me wrong. I am very disappointed that the MCC and the new
Amiga/Linux OS has been abandoned. At a later point, when and if I find
out the details of that abandonment, I may feel like taking Gateway and
its leaders to task. Right now I cannot feel justified in any rash
judgment. I also cannot say that I am very optomistic about all the other
things in the works, hardware and software. As soon as they have actually
appeared on the 'market,' then I will make my decision. From now on all
my hopes for the Amgia are going to be quite guarded.
{p} {p}
My chief concern now is to decide what to do in the short term. My
system is well used and I have no desire to chuck what I have and buy
something else. I have software that I have not learned to use fully.
Although I would like to have my programs operate at greater speed, the
programs I have run much better than similar programs I have observed
running on other types of computers. My Amiga still operates in the
mode that impressed me the first time I fired it up. I use my Amiga for
personal use, so I cannot reasonably justify speeding it up. Besides that,
I cannot really afford the expense, but that is beside the point.
{p} {p}
The real point is that I am happy with my Amiga. Sure, I would love many
of the apparent advancements other systems have. But I will not die
tomorrow if I don't get them.
{p} {p}
Personally, I have decided to look at what I can affordably do to
upgrade my Amiga to make my use of it more pleasurable. I am also looking
at the current advances in software to help make my Amiga more pleasurable
to operate.
{p} {p}
One last observation I would like to make is, if the MCC was truly a
great concept then I believe it will happen. But to be a great concept
it also has to be attainable. In today's business world it may not be
attainable. It may have even been too short a step forward. There may
be something on the horizon that will truly be the computer we have all
been desirous of. Now would be a good time to raise our eyes up and look
for what is on the horizon. We also need to be a little more skeptical
of the claims of what is new. Maybe that is the upshot of all this. But
I believe it will take more than this to effectively kill the Amiga as
some have claimed it has done.
