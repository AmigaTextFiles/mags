Well, it's October and- in most countries at least- some form of
Halloween is nearly upon us (my personal favorite day of the year). I've
always found it a day to celebrate so why not pass my joy around.
{p} {p}
In other words, it's theme-day again (any flimsey excuse). All the sites
this month are dedicated to Halloween, horror, and similar likes. So
strap on those vampire teeth, break that skeleton out of the closet, and
have fun.

Here we have Halloween how-to. You want to make up a Proper haunted
house in your yard? well Bob here has it all planned out for you. An
entire yard designed into one big Halloween creepy, he's broken it all
up into individual segments. From crypts to floating ghosts to a
Mausoleum, there are designs, plans, and construction details for how to
make it all, with individual pictures of each finished product.

So get to work, you've only a few days left.

Vampires, they're everywhere, hiding amongst us, engaging in their
secret mascarade. But forewarned is forearmed. So slip into this site to
get all you need to want to know about the legends of the vampires, the
make up of their clans, and the game which some say might be more than
fiction.

Another props page, dozens of Halloween props and step by step
instructions on how to make them. But if that's too much work for you,
and if you live in the New York area, they'll make it for you then
bill you and ship it to you. I think those Horror Ribs could come in
real useful.

What Halloween isn't complete without a good Vincent Price flick! Here's
a whole site just devoted to one of the old masters of horror films,
complete with descriptions of all his films, his endless television
appearances, his art collections, and even some of his cooking recipies.
A good tribute to one of the best.

Ever wonder where all those dark and creepy things go? Where Satan
lives, or the aliens hide out? Well, just possibly they went to this
site. An eclectic horror-themed site, it's doors await only for the
brave to enter.
{p} {p}
First off, you can sell your soul. That's right, send in an email
asking what you want, and it and a reply will be posted on the site,
complete with the date your soul was sold. Of course, I can't say that
your request will Actually come true, but it's a fun stop nonetheless.
{p} {p}
See the list of horror-themed alchoholic beverages. Recipies for actual
drinks, but with names like Alien Urine Sample, Red Death, Brain
Hemmorage, and the ever popular Zombie. Should add some life to those
Halloween parties.
{p} {p}
You've seen the movies, but have you seen THESE versions of those
films? Cartoons and animations themed on films from Of Mice And Men to
Independence Day, though never like you've seen them.
{p} {p}
Then you can relax to a nice calming midi tune- if you think moody
Disney Haunted House type stuff is relaxing, that is. Just the tunes to
get you in the mood.
{p} {p}
There's also an on-going story, started by the site creator and added to
by reader submissions. If you think you have a good enough chapter to
add then write it up and send it in and it just might get added in.
{p} {p}
No good horror site is complete without monsters, and here's plenty of
them. Picture galleries of creatures clipped from all your favorite old
movies. From an assortment of aliens to Dracula, to the devil himself
(the one out of Legends is always a classic), they're here waiting to be
downloaded.
{p} {p}
Well, that's all for now. For myself, I've got my own haunted house to
finish up...
