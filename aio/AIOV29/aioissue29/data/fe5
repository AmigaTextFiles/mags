IV. THE FINAL JUDGMENT AND RELEASES
{p} {p}
If the Settlement is approved by the Court, the Court will enter a
Judgment dismissing with prejudice all "Released Claims" against all
"Released Parties" (defined above). "Released Claims" means the
claims, rights, demands, obligations, actions, causes of action,
suits, cross­claims, matters, issues, debts, liens, contracts,
liabilities, agreements, costs, expenses of any nature, including
"Unknown Claims" (as defined herein), whether under Federal law or
regulation, or the laws or regulations of all states or subdivisions,
of Plaintiff and/or any and all Settlement Class Members arising out
of any purchase by any of them of a personal computer advertised,
marketed or sold under a brand name or trademark of Amiga (as
described above) during the Class Period, to the extent that such
claims (a) arise out of or relate to the selling as "new" personal
computers containing previously sold, used, recycled, refurbished, or
recertified parts during the Class Period, including any alleged
misrepresentation or omission regarding any such practice; or (b)
relate to any allegation that either was or could have been asserted
in the Complaint, or which might in the future be asserted by
Plaintiff or Settlement Class Member against any of the Released
Parties that would arise out of, or relate in any manner, directly or
indirectly, to any acts, facts, transactions, occurrences, conduct or
representations alleged in the Complaint arising out of or relating
to either the sale during the Class Period as "new" of any Amiga
personal computer that allegedly contains previously sold, recycled,
used, refurbished, or recertified components or parts, or any alleged
misrepresentations or omissions regarding the use of such components
or parts. This release shall extend to all of the Released Parties
and to any distributor, retail seller, or other reseller of such
personal computers, whether or not named as a defendant in this
action. "Unknown Claims" means all claims arising out of facts
relating to any matter covered by the Released Claims, which in the
future are or may be found to be other than or different from the
facts now believed to be true, so that each person or entity so
affected shall be deemed to have expressly waived all of the rights
and benefits of any provision of the law, either state or federal.
{p} {p}
All persons or entities providing releases under this Settlement
Agreement, including all Settlement Class Members, upon the Effective
Date shall be deemed to have, and by operation of the Judgment in the
Action shall have, waived any and all provisions, rights and benefits
conferred under section 1542 of the California Civil Code and any
comparable law of the State of Illinois or any state or territory of
the United States, or principle of common law, which is similar,
comparable or equivalent to such provision. All persons or entities
providing releases under this Settlement Agreement may hereafter
discover facts other than or different from those which he, she or it
now knows or believes to be true with respect to the subject matter
of the Released Claims or the claims described in the Settlement
Agreement, but such person or entity, upon the Effective Date, shall
be deemed to have, and by operation of the Judgment in the Action
shall have, fully, finally, and forever settled and released any and
all such claims, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected,
contingent or no contingent, whether or not concealed or hidden,
which now exist, or heretofore have existed upon any theory of law or
equity now existing or coming into existence in the future, including
conduct which is negligent, intentional, with or without malice, or a
breach of any duty, law or rule, without regard to the subsequent
discovery or existence of such different or additional facts.
