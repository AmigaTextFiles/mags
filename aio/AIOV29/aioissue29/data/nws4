Code name Hell Squad, new action-adventure game.

Last month we have purchased resources of one unfinished

looked very promising to us, so we have decided to buy it.
Now we are improving it and next week you'll have a chance
to take a closer look on it when we upload the demo. In
the mean time find out what it is all about on our web site
(games/hellsquad).
