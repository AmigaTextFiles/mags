Sick and tired of getting jerked around by corporate powers that don't
care a <insert favorite explative here> about the potential of quality
products and just want to line their pockets? (aside from the fact that
they could have done a better job even doing that if they'd just
listened to the Community).  Well, so are several others in the Amiga
Community.  Phoenix Platform Consortium is up and operational and needs
everyone's support.
{p} {p}
Formed by a collection of all our favorite Amiga developers and
companies, it's their aim to provide a common ground for all
Amiga Hardware and Software developers, a chance to make a go of a new
Amiga on our own.
{p} {p}
Of course, this doesn't mean that we have a few vitals like a public
promotion campaign of a new computer system that will attract the
attentipon of the general public, but it's a start. The best way of
summoning their purpose up is to quote the mandate given on their web
site...
{p} {p}
"The Phoenix Platform Consortium provides a healthy professional
climate for developers by fostering communication between members,
presenting a unified voice to outside concerns, and maintaining
channels to and from the user community. The main goal of Phoenix is
to promote an Amiga-inspired reference platform by ensuring
cooperation and collaboration, building and sustaining a marketplace,
and cementing relationships with primary technology and capital
providers.
{p} {p}
As such, Phoenix goes beyond traditional categories of software and
hardware membership to encourage status for marketing specialists,
dealers, publishers, agents providing financial or project management
services and support, and think-tank out-sourcing. Phoenix is
independent and self-supporting, and urges strong autonomy at the
same time providing mechanisms for the formation and evolution of
active research and implementation groups.
{p} {p}
We provide a common voice that unites all developer interests."
{p} {p}
Everyone is invited to join in or help out, or at the very least support
the cause. If interested, then more information can be obtained from
their web site at:
