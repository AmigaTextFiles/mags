Wazit is a gravity game by NC.Gamez (1997) where two players can control
fragile vector space craft and fight against each other in an arena.
Because all the in-game graphics are vectors, it allows for an interesting
feature: "zooming".  When the two ships are far away from each other,
the arena is viewed from a distance, but when they get closer the arena
magnifies. Strange?  Yeah, but it works quite well.

There's about 15 ships to choose from.  Each is a different shape and
varying statistics (speed, rotation, acceleration, etc).  Once both
players have chosen their ship, they move into the arena.  The first
one to deplete their opponent's shield wins.

The game plays okay, but does get slow on a 68020.  I was disappointed at
how few bullets I could fire, as well as how hard it was to aim.
The sounds are annoying too, and remind me of some Commodore 64 platformer
than a game involving solid crafts of destruction.

The author released Wazit without completely finishing it.  This means
that a few features are missing, and there are some bugs.

While a competent production, Wazit doesn't get me excited. Perhaps the
option for more players and maybe some computer players would've been good.
It is nice for a few minutes, but lacks lastability.
