           As you can see the first issue took off pretty good, otherwise we wouldn't
 be back this month would we now? This issue we've got loads of good files reviewed so
 you'll have another month to fill reading this :)
  The Amiga Games side has finally got back to being pretty big now with thousands of
 new files pouring onto the Aminet each week. Not forgetting the utils side which as
 always is full to the brim with execiting new things to make that WB look 100 times
 better than, Windows95. ahem.

@node "cuami" "News from the CuAmiga mailing list"

@{fg shine} CuAmiga Mailing list - Andrew Korn@{fg text}

 Hi all.

 In response to the various "was there anything other than what is in the
 press release" stuff -

 I met with Petro Tyschtchenko this morning to discuss his plans and ask him how
 the show had gone. He is following the GW2K party line on not making any rash
 announcements - get used to it, this is the way real businesses are run, even
 if it isn't the way certain tin toy companies we're used to hearing from work.

 However Herr tyshctchstchstychetcetera was able to clarify a number of
 issues and answered many of the points which have been of concern to the
 Amiga community.
 Expect a full write up of this in the next issue of CU, but a few choice
 questions will be answered for the chosen of the CU-LIST

 GW2k bought the Amiga to make money. They do not expect to make money now, they
 see it as a long term development. This can only be a good sign. They do not
 entirely understand the Amiga, and they recognise this. They do however realise
 that the Amiga has a fiercely loyal userbase, and this is why they bought it.
 GW2K's sales philosophy is to encourage user loyalty through good service, and
 it was the amazing loyalty of the Amiga market that they want to buy into. They
 do NOT expect us to start buying Amiga badged PCs.

 GW2K also believe that the market is lead by enthuisiasts, and view the Amiga
 as being the ultimate enthusiasts platform. GW2K reps at WOA were very
 impressed at the general level of understanding about the platform Amiga users
 have.

 AI are selling off old stocks of A1200s and A4000s. These stocks are small,
 and
 AI do not intend to make more. AI will be concentrating on R&D, OS development
 and supporting 3rd party developers before commiting to a next gen machine.
 They
 will not commit to a particular CPU until they have done more research.

 AI will concentrate on licensing OS & technology to allow those more advanced
 in research to provide true Amiga machines. PPC Amiga OS is a priority and
 AI want to see PIOS 1 and A/box running genuine Amiga Workbenches.

 My feelings about the buyout is that it is better news than we could have
 expected. Petro is a happy man, and GW2K seem to be genuinely serious about the
 Amiga. I hope this answers some of your worries, and check the July issue for
 more depth and a bunch more info.

 Comments, anyone?

@{fg shine} CLICKBOOM POWERUP SUPPORT PRESS RELEASE@{fg text}

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

 Toronto, May 5, 1997: PXL computers and clickBOOM are
 proud to announce a cooperation with Phase 5 Digital Products on
 making games for Power Amiga.

 "We strongly believe that the future for the Amiga computer lies in
 PowerPC processor. Furthermore, we believe Phase 5 is and will
 continue to be the Amiga hardware leader. Therefore, we have selected
 Power Amiga as our future platform of choice", says Alexander
 Petrovic, PXL and clickBOOM producer.

 Appropriately enough, the first ever Power Amiga game will be Myst
 from clickBOOM. It is a perfect opportunity for Myst and PowerUp
 accelerators to appear at the same time. Following Myst, other forth
 coming clickBOOM "killer games" will be fully optimized for the
 PowerPC chip, as well.

 Phase 5 Digital Products highly appreciates the development of Myst
 for the PowerUp accelerators and the plans of clickBOOM to add PowerUp
 support to more titles in the future. "We are happy to see how engaged
 clickBOOM has realized all their ambitious projects in the past, and
 we are excited that their new projects will be targeted for the
 PowerUp accelerators" says Wolf Dietrich of phase 5. "Beside all the
 demanding creativity software that we expect to come for the PowerUp
 boards, it's good to see powerful games with the real thrill coming
 also soon. What would such a powerhorse Amiga be without some
 breathtaking amusement? Still fast, but less fun... It's really
 impressive and good to see that clickBOOM is in the front line of
 visionary development for a new performance dimension."

 Support for Power Amigas will have several distinct advantages:

 1. It will give users a valid reason to upgrade as soon as
 PowerPC boards become available.

 2. New clickBOOM games written for Power Amiga will be
 breathtaking and a serious competition to the games on other
 platforms. This in return, will make the rest of the industry
 look very positively on the Amiga market.

 3.  Impressive CPU power will allow clickBOOM a technical freedom to
 convert any big game from other platforms to the Power Amiga.


 The exact timeline of clickBOOM Power Amiga releases is still to be
 decided. Currently, clickBOOM's strategy can be outlined in two steps:


 1. Starting with Myst, a couple of forth coming projects will
  support both 680x0 and PowerPC chip.

 2.  ClickBOOM will use this transitional period to work on a first
 Power Amiga-only  "killer" game. After its release, all the following
 games will be Power Amiga-only.


 For more information about our future strategy visit clickBOOM web
 site at www.clickboom.com

 We hope you like our plan and share our vision. Naturally, for the
 Power Amiga to ultimately succeed we need your support and input. As
 always, please feel free to contact us at info@clickboom.com

 Best regards,
 PXL computers and clickBOOM

@{fg shine} AUI Finished@{fg text}

           Another Amiga magazine has come to a close, being one of the very
 first Amiga mags around it will be sadly missed. The AUI was the only Amiga
 magazine to have used Amigas to create it and started off by mail order only.
 There was a sign that it was going to close when they had to resort to articles
 on things like Samsung, CIX and girls in the USA playing video games. I don't
 like to say this but it looked as if they didn't put as much effort in as the
 remaining Amiga magazines. Thanks to CuAmiga, AmigaFormat and Amiga Computing
 we get bumper packed magazines with only Amiga related materiel. Don't worry
 though if every Amiga mag closed we would still be going :) Hopefully that
 won't happen though.

@{fg shine} Vulcan go CD only@{fg text}

           Vulcan have taken the step to go CD only, after many disk releases they
 feel that games are getting to good and big to fit onto disks. This will be good
 news as it will encourage all Amiga users to either get a CD-Rom or be left out.
 They will be releasing one more disk based game which will be their exciting 5 aside
 football game. We hope Vulcan can pull this off and continue to produce excellent
 games in the future.

 @{b}Epic sign AF1@{ub}
           Epic Marketing have signed Alien Formula One. The amazing game with
 amazing speed an graphics has made a big impression after being featured on all
 the Amiga magzines in the UK. Alien Formula One was reviewed last issue and
 earned itself 91% overall. Hopefully we will be able to get a quick interview
 with epic for next issue!

 @{b}A1200's back!@{ub}
           Wizard Developments are re-stocking the last stocks of the Amiga 1200
 so if you want another A1200 or want to upgrade then get in touch with Wizard
 on 01322 527800 as they are limited stock.

 @{b}A600 goes o3o@{ub}
           At last the Amiga 600 gets power. Until now Amiga 600 owners could only
 match the speed of a basic A1200 owner but thats all changed as you can now get
 a spanking new 030 accelerator. 25MHz 4MB - £99.95 / 25MHz 8MB - £115.95 /

 @{b}CD-Rom hits big time@{ub}
           Up until now games on CD have been a thing of the future for Amiga owners
 but now it seems that games on disk are suddenly a thing of the past. Most games
 now will at least require a CD-Rom maybe even soon an accelerator, GFX card and sound
 card. Who knows what will happen but it looks like time to splash out on a CD-Rom.

 @{b}Imagine stays@{ub}
           Imagine is going to stick with the Amiga. Impulse were threatening to pull
 out of the Amiga market as there was not a big response to recent versions of Imagine
 This however all changed when they released version 5 for just $100. They say they
 will definalty be producing Imagine 6.

 @{b}CALLING Norwich Amiga users@{ub}
           The Norwich Amiga Users Group are looking for new members, they hold
 their meetings every fortnight at the Belvedere Community Centre off Dereham road
 in Norwich. They welcome any Amiga user no matter what experience they have with
 an Amiga. For more information phone 01603 867663.

 @{b}Power Amiga@{ub}
           Direct Software's Power Amiga has finnally been released, it was released
 at the World Of Amiga show in London, England. In case you didn't know it inclueds
 CD-Rom, 1 gig HD, 22 meg, Monitor, Zorro Slots, 3D chip, 64 Bit, 060. The full
 set-up will cost you £1.499 and it looks to be a good deal.

@{fg shine} Evil's Doom@{fg text}

           For those of you that have been waiting for a new Dungeon Master game
 your wait is finally over. It's been a long time waiting but I think the wait was
 worth it. As soon as you load the game and see the title screen you know the game
 is going to be a blinder. The graphics are superb and the music is so good it makes
 you feel like your actually there. At the start you have to go to different locations
 on the map and talk to different people, some of the people you talk to will join
 your party others just won't want to talk to you. You start off with two charictors
 and it's up to you who becomes the other two. Every location has a different piece
 of music which makes the game huge. The demo I have tried was 2.2meg LHA'ed. You
 may think spending all that money downloading this demo isn't worth it but let
 me tell you now you've probably never seen a game as good as it. Once you've
 selected your party you progress into the dungeons, the dungeons are as good as the
 rest of the game, basiclly you have to go round different floors opening doors,
 solving puzzles and killing baddies. Overall this games is @{b}GREAT@{ub} there is
 only one problem, the full game has to be bought all the way from Croatia. Don't
 worry thought i've heard rumours that Direct Software UK might be publishing it
 and theres always some truth in rumours.

 is quite good as well. At the moment there is no music just the rumble of the engine.
 The speed of the game depends on the speed of your processor, so if you own an o6o
 then you'll really love this game, don't worry though there are three different
 versions of the game in the archive each with different graphic qualitys so everyone
 from super powered o6o owners to basic o2o owners can enjoy this game.

@{fg shine} MonteCarlo@{fg text}

           MonteCarlo tries to bring roulette to your own home, sadly I think it
 has failed. I really wanted to like this game as I have never played proper
 roulette in my life but I have to be truthful I hated this computer version.
 The main problem is the layout of the game on a separate WB window is awful, the
 background is green maybe to simulate the table cloth but this just anoys your
 eyes after a while. Another problem is there is no picture of a roulette wheel
 spinning so you just get a light flickering on whatever number the ball has last
 landed on, although not really a major problem it would of been nice to see
 something spinning and maybe a cheer sound effect. After all those problems
 if you really like roulette then this is probably for you.

           There have been a lot of shoot-em-up games over the years with the basic
 2D sprites, and thats about it, were all used to them so no one has ever complained.
 That was until this game, the graphics are just so good for a shoot-em-up, fly up and
 you can see under the spaceship, fly down and you can see the top of the spaceship.
 All the main sprites are rendered, the background isn't but that doesn't matter because
 it's the baddies and main spaceship that catch your attension. At moment the game
 is in it's early stages so you can only play one level. Even if you don't like shoot-
 em-ups this game might change your mind, i'm just waiting for the full game.

@{fg shine} Genetic Species DEMO@{fg text}

           Just when you thought the battle of 'my doom engine is faster than yours'
 had faded out, another one is released. This one is actually quite good and although
 I've only had the chance to play the demo the game looks like it could be a big
 hit. Depending on how fast your processor is depends on how fast the game will run,
 but don't worry as you can adjust the screen size to suit the speed of your computer. 
 If like me you still own and 020 the game can run at a good speed in the two smallest
 screens. This may seem like a bad thing but I think the smallest screen is the best
 out of them all as the graphics are more compact which makes them clearer and less blocky.
 The game supports a selection of graphics cards which will make the game even better and
 it should be released very soon.

@{fg shine} Bloodbath@{fg text}

           If you liked Operation Wolf you'll love this, for you that don't know
 what Op Wolf is it's a shoot-em game, the idea is your looking out the persons
 eyes and you can see various baddies pop out from different places on the screen
 and you have to shoot them. The only difference with BloodBath is that the screen 
 doesn't scroll. The first thing that hits you is the graphics, they are just sooo
 good, the reason they are amazing is that the authors have filmed the people so
 it is real digitized levels and real digitzed people which adds to the fun of
 the game even more. The only real problem is the graphics are in black and white
 so don't be expecting colour, is suppose the graphics being in black and white is
 alright because the game at the moment is already 1.8meg and thats with black
 and white graphics. The intro itself takes up 1.8meg when decompacted even though
 it is very short, but it's worth it. There are only three levels to the game but
 if you have enough time to download 1.8meg you must get this just to see the
 graphics.

           Wayhay! What a game, this game is quite funny actually. The graphics are
 nicely done and cartoony but very simple. The idea of the game is to shoot the sheep
 that come shooting onto the screen, it's a bit like the clay pigeon shooting. The
 more sheep you shoot the more score you get and the higher the level gets. Thats it
 really but this game is nicely done and will keep you amused on a boring day.

           This file will only appeal to a majority, it is meant to be something to
 do with Amiga users on IRC although I can't really figure out what it is. The inter-
 face is very good, it is easy to use and looks like a web page. There is some
 different information about different Amiga related subjects but I still can not
 figure out what the point is. I can't really comment to much on this but what i've
 seen there is no point to it at all, the only good thing about it is the layout.

@{fg shine} AsciiArt Pro V4@{fg text}

           If your into the world of colourful logos and wierd objects and you like
 doing them with text then this is the program for you. It is easy enough to use
 and even a begginer AsciiArtist could use this. It offers all the symbols in an
 easy point and click symbol bar, or if you prefer you can just use the keyboard.
 One of the programs most useful options is the IFF to Ascii. This will allow IFF
 pictures to be converted into Ascii without having to lift a finger, although the
 rendering of the picture takes a while the end results are pleasing and worth
 the wait. Ascii art can be done using a text editor but this program gives you
 some very useful options that only an Ascii Artist would need. This program is
 great and even got me doodling away.

@{fg shine} NSA-Patch@{fg text}

           NSA-Patch is a very useful utility, the idea of it is to look through
 your program and replace any old speed commands with up to date new ones which
 will improve the speed of your program. I have used this program on nearly
 everything on my HD without any problems and alot of the programs have sped up
 nearly 2 or 3 times faster. Not everything will be sped up but on the programs
 it does speed up it's worth it. There isn't that much else to say about it but
 if you see it make sure you download it.

 useful, go round to a mates house and while there not there install it in there
 startup-sequence and watch with pleasure as they scan there HD with virus checkers
 and other such things. There isn't much point to this file but if you have a friend

           ViewDIZ simply allows you to look at a File_ID.DIZ without having to use
 a text editor/displayer, it also allows you to look at a File_ID.DIZ without
 unarchiving the file, at the moment it caters for lha, lzx, dms, txt, nfo, lzh and
 in future versions it will cater for everything. This program works really well
 with utils like DOpus and other disk managers. It has quite a lot of features for
 such a small program. If your constantly looking at file_ID_DIZ's then download this.

           From this issue onwards if any Amiga mag inclueds AIO in the magazine
 or features it in there pages I @{b}MUST@{ub} be sent a copy of the magazine.

           From the next issue (issue 3) we will have a new Deputy Editor, he
 will be helping out and taking some of the work load off me :) So treat him
 how you would treat me. His name is Sean Talbot and you can contact him by
 sending an email to the useual address but in the subject line put 'Sean'.

           We are very sorry that we couldn't bring you the interview with Paul
 Carrington from Vulcan Software but over the next couple of issues we are hoping
 to get some interviews with other BIG Amiga people inclueding Paul Carrington.
