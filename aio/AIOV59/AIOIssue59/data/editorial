There could be three significant events this Summer...  The newest Star Wars
comes out, governments finally decide to do something about terrorism,
and the new miga is released.  Me personally I think that last one
stands the best chance of changing the world.  The hardwares said to
be done, it just awaits the new OS.  My comment?{pp}
Hurry up and write the darned thing, some of us can't wait!  You
gotta bet that two weeks after it's released I'm gonna have a new Ami
sitting on my desk and introducing it to it's father.  The leanest OS
on the planet running native on the power of a G3 or G4?  That puppy's gonna launch
my pointer straight across my room!  I, and I'm sure many others, are
getting a bit antsy.

In other news, you'll notice a new Utils Editor this month.  Read his
stuff, see what you think.

Okay, so what ever happened to the CD issue?  Still coming, just a few
delays.  First thing there's some news it'll be posted to the usual
news sites as well as to subscribers.  Just keep watching.

And since it's nearing Summer where I am then here's wishing everyone
a good Summer (sorry, Australia).
