Well, I'm writing this after just having seen the newest Star Wars so
I'm sure everything I find on the web will seem exceedingly diminished
in comparison, but for your sake I'll try anyway.  I'll avoid the
temptation of squeezing in a Star wars fan site s no mere web thingy
is going to possibly do that film justice.  Well anyway, on with the
sites...

A site with more potential then it actually displays, it's devoted
mainly to girls that once long ago were the hot babes of their time,
what they were and what they are now.  My complain is not in the
cpontent but in the web programmer...  If viewed in Voyager expect a
reset-crash at every other click; if viewed in AWeb expect never ending
cookies (about 5+ per link clicked).  Otherwise it's a good trip through
nostaligia land.

As long as that <I>other</I> movie's out there then why not a site for
it?  Pics of movie posters, collectibvles, old comics, pics of the
spider-man ride over at IUniversal in Florida, and bunched more of
Spidey stuff. This site recently had the trailer available of the
spiderman twin-towers thing that was pulled but had to take it off his
site due to too great a demand that caused his hosting bill to rise too
much; well, maybe he'll put it back up later on.  At any rate, there's a
bunch of spiderman stuff to still go through.

{bold}Trent Harris- Cult Films and Books{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.cc.utah.edu/~th3597/index.html{noitalic}{p}
Trent Harris is apparently a small independent film maker who has mad a
small handful of films, the main one being Plan 10 From Outer Space.
No, not Plan 9, but Plan 10, a quite different little bad film.  Worth a
quick check.
