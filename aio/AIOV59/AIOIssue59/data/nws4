Welcome to a second set of patches and additions to Amithlon 1.0.1.
{pp}
This archive contains a couple of previously unreleased patches, and an
update to one previously available patch. At least one of those patches
is highly experimental, so please read the descriptions to find out
which patches you want to install, and then read the "INSTALL" section
on how to do it.
{pp}
The following patches are included in this archive:
{pp}
{fixed}
   patch2_vec.o:     This is an updated version of the "safety net" patch
                     included in H&P's AmigaOS XL update. This one makes
                     pgp 2.6.3 work on Amithlon
   patch1_p4.o:      This one will check for a peculiarity of the Pentium4
                     (which in one detail behaves different from any other
                     x86 CPU I am aware of), and if it finds it, works around
                     that peculiarity. Please note that this will slow things
                     down a little bit on P4 machines, but without this patch,
                     P4s may exhibit strange behaviour (like checksum errors)
   patch1_zip.o      This is a highly experimental patch improving the
                     handling of removable media (ZIP and LS-120 drives)
                     in Amithlon. Note: Don't install this if you don't need
                     it. The things it does are *not* nice.
                     With this patch, you should be able to eject disks at
                     any time.
