Well, we got two replies for our Hot Topic this month.  The question
was:  "Do we really need to support the x86 platform?  Or if given a better choise will people abandon that aged
architecture and beat a path to the PPC and other alternatives?"{p}
and here are the replies...

I don't think we should have a support for x86. Amithlon was a nice idea but
it's just an emulator and there is already WinUAE that is free and should stay like that.
WinUAE is updating and it's good for x86 users.{p}
The real amiga is PPC especially for OS4 :)....{p}
If OS5 comes out some day it could be good to make support for x86 and many others like
planned. But i'm more into OS4, heh.

Hi.{p}
Although the argument is a bit pointless as the future of AmigaOS is
now definatly with PPC, many people still seem to want to make the case
of x86. There are two very good reasons for not going x86.{p}
The first, and most important, is that by porting AmigaOS to x86,
competition with Windows and Linux would instantly become ten times
worse. Apple realised this long ago, and so stuck to 68k and PPC.
Although a move now would be hard, because of all the legacy PPC
software, they could do it, but don't.{p}
The second reason is more a matter of oppinion, but I think it's a valid
point. The x86 architecture sucks, and so do the chips. Not only are
Intel and AMD looking to move to new (and competing) 64bit platforms
anyway, but who really wants a fan oven inside their computer when they
could have a silent and cool PPC?{p}
Regards,{p}

The Hot Topic for next month:  "When the Amiga One comes out, do
appearances matter?  Are you hoping someone takes a creative/futuristic design approach
the way Apple has done with their recent cases or will grey boxes suffice?"

Send in those replies and we'll print them up next month.
