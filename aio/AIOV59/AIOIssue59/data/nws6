 "Some of the Amiga Inc efforts to obtain support for the AmigaDE
 were revealed this week when a Metrowerks representative surprised
 Amiga users by suggesting that they were to meet senior members of
 AmigaInc in London.

Metrowerks is an important company in the computing world as their
product, the CodeWarrior helps developers to create and deploy
content and applications for a multitude of media devices with a
minimal amount of porting. The fact that Metrowerks are meeting with
Amiga Inc could signal that they intend to supply development tools
to Amiga developers. The Metrowerks representative stated, 'we are
aware this is a thriving and active 3rd party community out there and
we are eager to support your endeavours'."
