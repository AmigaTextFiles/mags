Until OS4 comes along the old standard requesters need a lot of
improvement.  But of the three major replacements out there, which one
to choose?  That's what we're here for.{pp}
ARQ was great with animated requesters and small files but is old,
crash prone, and you're stuck with the images built in.  This leaves
either MRQ or ReqAttack.{pp}
ReqAttack has the potential to be a great requester package, but
there's a big "however" that goes along with this.  Anyone ever try to
config this thing?  It needs a lot simpler method, one where you can
just set it up for the half dozen common classes of system requesters
instead of guessing at the more common phrase pattern-0matching that
it now entails..  Put in a some pre-programmed slots in the prefs that
can be configed for and you got something.  Something like "Quit",
"Printer trouble", "warning", and similar standard requesters.  Noone
feels like entering in dozens of pattern-matching requester titles to
get the thing started; it should be there already.  The other thing
with ReqAttack is that if you want an animated requester prepare for
100K animation files per requester and thus watching your chip ram
go flying out the window.{pp}
While MRQ is the one I use it's not perfect either.  The prefs are
divided into loaidng up the MUI prefs or the config file.  Of course
the button that loads up the configfile does absolutely nothing, so
it's back to the old text editor to enter in new classes of requesters
(but at least it {italic}does{noitalic} go by more generalized
classes unlike ReqAttack) nd the accompanying images.  The MUI portion
of the prefs is a simple enough way of getting some color and better
appearance into your requesters, and if you're careful enough with
your choise of images you won't loose too much memory just on
requesters.{pp}
Memo to the future of the OS regarding requesters.  First, they should
look pleasing but ot take up much in the way of system resources. 
These {bold}are{nobold} merely requesters after all (we don't ned to
do a Microsoft on these things).  Second, the prefs should be really
simple and intuitive.  Perhaps a popup list of all standard types of
system requesters to select which one to config for followed by the
usual selectors for images used and such.  One should be able to
config the requesters in just a couple of minutes and a few mouse
clicks, not half an hour editing a file or entering in a list of
string patterns.{pp}
Developers, please take note of the above.
