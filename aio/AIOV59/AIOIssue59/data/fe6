Did you know that you can still use the pointer with the mouse DISCONNECTED?

{bold}WARNING:{nobold} Switch OFF the AMIGA before connecting or disconnecting any hardware.

failure of equipment or data caused in any way by the use of this
information.{p}
Now read on...
{pp}        
{bold}Overview:{nobold}  From at least WorkBench 1.3x the facility to move the mouse pointer and
left click or right click from the KeyBoard has been available....{p}
This is NO trick, but was put into the OS from the start. At this point
I do not know if this facility is available using WorkBench 1.2x or less.
Perhaps someone could let me know...{p}
It all stemmed from the ~TestGear?~ projects that I have developed over
the years, when a young lad that I know owns an AMIGA A500 WITHOUT a mouse.

{bold}Abbreviations:{nobold}

     OS = Operating System.
    LAK = Left Amiga Key.
    RAK = Right Amiga Key.
  L-Alt = Left Alt Key.
  R-Alt = Right Alt Key.
     LA = Left Arrow Key.
     RA = Right Arrow Key.
     UA = Up Arrow Key.
     DA = Down Arrow Key.

{bold}How To Use The KeyBoard Mouse:{nobold}
{pp}        
A) BEWARE...{p}
This works faultlessly under WorkBench, BUT some third party programs
are NOT user friendly to the facility and can cause a GURU or system
lock up, so therefore get used to using it first under the OS, then
try your other software with it...
{pp}
B) Moving The Pointer:{p}
1) The mouse does NOT need to be disconnected to test this facility out,
but it is much better fun practising without it connected...{p}
2) Hold down either the ~LAK~ or the ~RAK~, it does NOT matter
which.{p}
3) Whilst doing 2) press any ONE only of the ~ARROW~ keys, ~LA~, ~RA~,
~UA~ or ~DA~.{p}
4) The pointer will now move in the direction of the arrow.{p}
5) The longer the two keys are held down the faster the pointer will
move.{p}
6) This is ~Equivalent~ to the mouse movement BUT can only go Left, Right,
Up or Down, NOT diagonally or in a circle.{p}
7) Move the pointer over an icon, (say a disk icon), and then release the
TWO keys.
{pp}
C) Emulating The Left Mouse Button Or The Right Mouse Button:{p}  
1) The Left Mouse Button is equal to the ~L-Alt~ and the ~LAK~ pressed at
the same time.{p}
2) Conversely the Right Mouse Button is equal to the ~R-Alt~ and the ~RAK~
pressed at the same time.{p}
3) With the pointer over an icon, (say a disk icon), press the ~L-Alt~
and the ~LAK~ keys quickly twice and ~voila~ the window will
appear...  Refer back to Paragraph B) Part 7).{p}
4) This has EXACTLY the same function as the Left Mouse Button, and will
work at the same speed as your mouse click preferences.{p}
5) Similarly with the ~R-Alt~ and the ~RAK~ keys... This works EXACTLY the
same as the Right Mouse Button and will access any menus available.{p}
6) Practise the ~L-Alt~, ~LAK~ and an ~ARROW~ key together in ~Drag-n-Drop~
mode.{p}
7) Practise the ~R-Alt~, ~RAK~ and an ~ARROW~ key together to access the
~Pull Down Menus~{p}.
8) Practise ~Double Clicking~ the ~L-Alt~ and ~LAK~ keys.{p}
9) Remember that these operations are a little tricky so practise them
thoroughly...{p}
10) Also remember that the mouse does NOT need to be connected for this
to work.
{pp}
{bold}And Finally:{nobold}
{pp}
Refer to the AMIGA ~User's Guide~ for further information about the use
of the KeyBoard shortcuts, and any other KeyBoard-Mouse subtleties not
mentioned in this document... For example the use of the ~SHIFT~ keys,
with the above keys, to speed up pointer movement.
