OK, OK, I have 5 games to announce! But, not all of them at once.
And before I do, I would like to remind any interested programmers,
that it is because of these five games that we are looking for
another Amiga/PC programmer who would be able to help with
development of our other Amiga titles (N2,Z).

666 - Last month I told you about our new "unnamed" game. Now I can
finally announce the name to you. It's the ever-frightening,
ever-demonic, the one and only sign of the Beast. It's 666. This is
our new original game. We've been working on it for quite some time,
and it's shaping up quite terrifically, thank you. However, it is
very far from being finished, and there are no screenshots yet. It's
probably better not grouping it in any particular genre, as you'll
see for yourself once it's ready. But, if I had to find a category
for it, it would probably be a 3D action-adventure, but with many,
many new twists. 666 is a very ambitious project, certainly our
biggest. 666 is currently planned for PPC Amiga , PC and Mac. ETA Q3
2003.
