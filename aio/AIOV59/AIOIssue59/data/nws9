"As the release date for the next generation of Amiga desktop
products gets ever closer, we have been innundated with requests for
glimpses of how the new system will look. Amiga has thus asked our
partners at Hyperion to provide us with a set of screenshots to show
off some of the upcoming features, and this will become a regular
event as we seek to highlight particular aspects of our future
offering.
{pp}
For the first set, we chose to highlight the many different
customisation options that a user can apply to the AmigaOS4.0
interface. Taken from a VGA setting on one of the core team
development machines, this set highlights such effects as
transparency, shadow, texture, gadget shape and colour. This will
allow the Amiga community to continue to create and enjoy the most
varied of experiences.

Ben Hermans, Hyperion: "Before you complain, nearly everything can be
changed and these shots do not yet include the new system graphics by
Matt Chaput."
