Multiview is great for a number of file types but sometimes you want
something better, or the datatypes that Multiview uses just aren't
enough.  There's a plethora of file viewers out there, but which to
choose?  Well, that's what we're here for.  Just a quick list of good
viewers without any crippleware going on.{pp}
Cyberview is a good all around picture viewer suppoorted through
datatypes; I use it as my default one in DOpus.  For other more
specific picture types there's CyberAVI and CyberQT, though recent
versions of Quicktime format appear unsupported and unrecognized. 
Xanim is a good general animation viewer for just about anything else.
 For mpeg video Osiris is good but Frogger also supports mpeg video
off of CDs.  Mostra I keep around because it supports color cycling
and I still have a few favorite old pics that use that; also the OLD
superview3.1 (going way back here) does color cycling.{pp}
For sound Hippor Player does midi, mods, and mpegs, and mpega itself
is good to slave to a DOpus button or filetype.  GMPlay is my current
midi player of choise, not that I use midi much anymore (too tinny for
my tastes).  Most mpega GUIs (including Amplifier) use way too much
CPU just for the interface, which is why SPlayer is still the best
GUI for mpegs.{pp}
Finally in the subject of textx, here Multiview is quoite sufficient
except for pdfs.  For those you'll want Apdf, which can also be
plugged into browsers.{pp}
What, no postscript viewers?  Well, since I use the t1manager plugin
approach to postscript font use instead of the horrendously immense
Ghostscript package, the subject's never really come up.{pp}
Well, that's about it.  Just a quick summary of some good viewers, all
of which can be found on Aminet with a quick search, and all of which
are DOpus friendly.  Happy viewing.
