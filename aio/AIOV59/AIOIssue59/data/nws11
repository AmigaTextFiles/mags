SoundFX 4.2 has entered the final betatesting stage. If things
proceed well the final release will appear in a couple of weeks.
Important internal changes have been made to the new version so that
advanced features (like realtime processing) are possible in the
future. Many bugs have been fixed, and a number of useful features
added. Among them there are: saving selected ranges, faster ARexx
port, Tips of the Day, About-window with extensive system
information, direct access to SoundFX homepage from within the
program, improved Hall operator, and more.

SoundFX is a sound-processing package developed by Stefan Kost. For a
shareware price it offers professional features, many of which are
quite unique on the Amiga. It is a real must for every Amiga sound
designer or music producer."
