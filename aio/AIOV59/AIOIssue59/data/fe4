{italic}Editor:  The following is an interview by Chris Seward with the Bitmap
Brothers.  Enjoy it.{noitalic}

{pp}
CHRIS:  Firstly, thank you for taking the time to answer our questions.
{pp}
1) Please could you tell us a bit of background history about The
Bitmap Brothers. How did it all begin? etc.
{pp}
BB:  The company was originally set up in 1987 by three friends (not brothers)
to create a single game, the scrolling shoot-em-up Xenon. Xenon became
instantly famous, featuring as a viewer challenge on the popular Saturday
morning kids show 'Get Fresh'. The rest, as they say, is history.
{pp}
CHRIS:  2) Which platforms does the company currently develop for?
{pp}
BB:  We are currently developing for PC, PlayStation2 and XBox, and we have an
external development company developing our titles for handheld platforms
such as GBA, PDA and mobile phones.
{pp}
CHRIS:  4) What personally is your role in the company and what have you been
working on of late?
{pp}
BB:  I'm Business Development Director, and I am currently creating an all-new
version of Speedball for next-gen platforms, as well as producing the
conversions of our back catalogue to GBA.
{pp}
CHRIS:  5) Currently how many people are employed?
{pp}
BB:  Around 20 full-time staff, although we are about to enter a period of
expansion, so you can expect to see that figure increase in the coming
months.
{pp}
CHRIS:  6) How many of the original staff who worked on the classic Amiga
games are still left at the company?
{pp}
BB:  Several, surprisingly, given the massive staff turnover at some of the
larger development houses! Dan Malone, the original artist for Speedball 2,
did a lot of the current Speedball Arena concept artwork for us recently on
a freelance basis, and Mark Coleman (probably best known for Xenon 2 and
Gods graphics) still works for us. John M Phillips, of Nutcracka,
Impossaball and Nebulus fame is also nearing his tenth year with us.
{pp}
CHRIS:  7) Is there any evidence of the Amiga in the company offices. If so, are
they used in anyway at all?
{pp}
BB:  There is one no more than 10 feet away from me as we speak, as well as a
CD32. It gets used for sporadic Speedball 2 and Sensible Soccer sessions
mostly!
{pp}
CHRIS:  8) Would the company consider releasing the past Amiga games as free
software and/or as an open source?
{pp}
BB:  Well at the moment it's tricky because they are still commercial products,
in that the Amiga code is being used as a base for the conversions to other
platforms such as the GBA and Pocket PC. However we may consider releasing
the ROMs at a later date so watch this space!
{pp}
CHRIS:  9) Are the company in anyway interested in seeing a future Amiga and
would they be prepared to publish games for the platform if they
were approached by Amiga Inc?
{pp}
BB:  From a nostalgic point of view, yes it would be great. Commercially
however, you have to look at the current console and home computer markets
and wonder where exactly it would fit in, and how many people would be
seriously willing to support it, by which I mean hardware and software
manufacturers as much as consumers. 
{pp}
CHRIS:  10) The games industry has changed dramatically since the demise of the
Amiga, what is the difference in the size of production teams and
costs since the days which Amiga games were produced by yourselves?
{pp}
BB:  It's funny, we did an update of Xenon about a year ago for PC Format
magazine as a 6 month programming tutorial. With a team consisting of
myself, John Phillips (programming), Mark Coleman (graphics) and Chris Maule
(sound) we managed to produce the game, split it into 6 concise sections and
write the tutorials etc. in a time frame of 4 months, in our spare time!
Compare that with our last AAA title, Z: Steel Soldiers, which took a team
of around 20 over 2 years to produce! Fortunately, there are some quality
middleware engines currently coming of age that can cut team sizes and
development time considerably, which can only be a good thing.
{pp}
CHRIS:  11) A lot of the Amiga community have specific talents for high end
programming, graphics & music. How would one go about applying to The
Bitmap Brothers for employment?
{pp}
BB:  Send a CV to employment@bitmap-brothers.co.uk
{pp}
CHRIS:  12) What do you personally miss about the Amiga computer if anything?
{pp}
BB:  It combined the flexibility of a home computer but with the fixed platform
of a console; none of this having to cater to a huge variety of hardware
configurations you get with the PC market today.
{pp}
