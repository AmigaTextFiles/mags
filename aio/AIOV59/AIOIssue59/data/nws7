April 10, 2002 Snoqualmie, WA Amiga, Inc. announced the release schedule
of the Amiga Anywhere Entertainment Pack #1 for Windows Powered Devices.
The Entertainment Pack will run on devices using Windows CE 3.0, Windows
CE .NET, Pocket PC, and Pocket PC 2002 including handhelds, smart phones,
web pads, and set-top boxes.

The Entertainment Pack #1 will contain four applications and the Amiga
Anywhere Content Engine. These include the award winning Planet Zed and
Convex games from ZeoNeo as well as Gobbler and Solitaire from Pulsar
Interactive. The Amiga Anywhere Content Engine allows access to more Amiga
Anywhere applications available now and in the future.

Since announcing a change from hardware to software Amiga has strived to
create and distribute content that can run on numerous digital devices.
"Amiga is now focused on the vision that all digital content should be
available on all digital devices", said Bill McEwen, President and CEO of
Amiga Inc. To that end Amiga has announced distribution of dozens of
applications that can run on a wide range of different types of devices
with hundreds more currently in development.

The Amiga Anywhere Entertainment Pack #1 will provide an exciting
experience for owners of Windows Powered handheld devices without using
the amount of resources consumed by other applications. Amiga developers
are creating rich content using few resources. The average size of an
Amiga Anywhere application is under 300KB and yet delivers a more robust
experience than titles that are over 2 MB in size.

"As mobile devices become smarter and more powerful, users are asking for
rich entertainment and gaming experiences", said Scott Horn, director,
Embedded and Appliance Platforms Group, Microsoft Corp. The combination of
the Windows CE operating system´s multimedia functionality and Amiga´s
software solution allows developers to deliver rich applications for a
broad range of Windows Powered devices.

Amiga Anywhere Entertainment Pack #1 will ship on April 15, 2002. More
