OK this program doesn't really do much but tell information about
mounted drives.It sits where ever you want and gives info about
total size/used size/free size.
{pp}
VolumeMeter opens a small window on workbench (or Dopus Magellan) and displays
a bar chart of your harddrive and ram usage (icluding any drives mounted over
a network). The last two bars are chip and fast ram. All bars show the amount
USED and are colour coded as follows:-
{pp}
{fixed}
Blue     0-49%
Green   50-80%
Amber   81-94%
Red     95-100%
