This came to my attention from the Amithlon mailing list.
It's a mpg player and requires a fast Amiga,040 or better.
I use it on AmigaForever and AmigaXL and have been happy.
The one problem is with mpgs that have a sound track.For
some reason I have not been able to get the whole sound track
to play even when increasing the stack.The video play back is
fast and crisp.
