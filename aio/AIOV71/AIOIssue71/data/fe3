For my last Hints & Tips I just thought I'd give a quick rundownon
some available utilities that everyone should have on their hard drive.
All can be had from Aminet.  These are in the "toolkit" category of
such programs and not what might be termed bells and whistles.  Well, on
with the list.
{pp}
Scout.  If you don';t have this get it.  This one program alone is
nearly half your toolbox.  Break or quit a program, get a list of
screens and windows you can close, and too many other things to sit
here and name.  It's MUI and an easy click to operate.
{pp}
Enforcer or Cyberguard.  Both have the same basic funcxtion of catching
the lesser crashes before they can bring a program down, the only
difference is that Cybverguard is for those with Cyberstorm boards. 
it won't stop the direct-to-reset Voyager type crashes (the only type
V seems to have) but is great for the more annoying ones.  Put in yous
startup-sequence or like me as a WB menu item to call upon when you're
about to run that one program or wordprocessor <coughWordworthcough>
you expect to bring up a hit.
{pp}
SnoopDOS.  One of those you won't use too often (unless you betatest a
lot) but when you Doneed it you'll be glad it's around. Helps you
trace down those mysterious crashes.
{pp}
A good text editor.  CED or GoldED are safe bets, just something better
than the bog standard one that comes with the usual OS release.
{pp}
A disk recovery program.  Disksalv or Quarterback, just somethingfor
those post-crash emergencies.  As a note, version 2 of Disksalv, while
old, still has the Validate function in it omitted by later versions,
which is good for forcing that validation the OS doesn't seem to want
to giuve after Yam or V crashes.
{pp}
A good Virus Checker.  The last of ourimportant essentials is, of
course, a good virus checker.  VirusZ, Virus_Checker, anything that
works easily enough in the background and gets updated fairly enough,
or at least uses the xvs.library external virus scanner library.
{pp}
Well, that's it for basic essential tools, except maybe a good
internet connection so you can keep updated on the upcoming OS4
release.
