C-One (world premiere) The C-One is a multiple faster than the C64 and has
standard interfaces (PS/2-Mouseport, PS/2-Keyboard, Parallel-Port) to
communicate with the outside world. PCI slots allow the use of todays
PCI-cards, but also the periphery of the C64 is supported, as well as
the clockport expansions modules of the Amiga 1200 will work in
the C-One. But the C-One is more: It is reconfigurable and thereby
the first of its kind. The used techniques allows changing the hardware
by means of simply exchanging a file. Jens Schoenfeld will give an
explicit, free of charge seminar on the C-One and will explain all the
C-One functions. Jens will also answer all questions related to the
other products from individual Computers. The products of individual
Computers can be bought at the show.
