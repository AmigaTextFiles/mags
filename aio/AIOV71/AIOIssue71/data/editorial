Well, here it is; the very last issue... (engage reverb)
{italic}ever.{noitalic}  We've said all there is to say, done all that
we came here to do, but in the end, well there {bold}is{nobold} an
end.
{pp}
Or to be more correct, a transition, for endings and beginnings are
often much the same thing.  The Amiga stands poised to evolve into a
whole new creature that may well see a reinactment of the original
stormof change that rose up back in 1985.  History does tend to go in
cycles.  Amiga generation 2 has been slow in coming but when it gets
here, then watch out.
{pp}
AIO has been a child of the first generation of the Amiga, and so as
the Amiga now readies to move onto Generation 2 so too must AIO stand
aside and permit a new standard bearer to join the march.  This is not
death but change.
{pp}
For many years we have tried to find the bright spot in a long dark
tunnel, but now that there seems to be a light on ahead you no longer
need someone to hold the torch.  We have been around for six years
now, as of this very month, and through all of that time a great many
people, editors, artists, and even coders have come and gone, a list
so long it needs it's own article.  If you want to know who to give
thanks for, and who it is we are all grateful for, then you might want
to check out the {link fe4}Final Credits{end} link.
{pp}
But does this mean we will be forever gone?  That we'll all be leaving
the Amiga for all time?  If you believe that then you haven't been
paying attention these last six years.  Myself, I looked at all
the other platforms before I got my first A500, because it was
overall quality that I desired and I really don't care if 90% of the
world is either too stupid or too enclased to make the same thoughtful
choise.  We do not run with the crowd, we have our own race.
{pp}
As for AIO itself, perhaps when the next generation of the Amiga is
off and going we might start up a AIO Generation 2, complete with
taking advantage of all the new capability that the new OS and
hardware will be capable of (an updated interface, for one, comes to
mind).  No promises either way, but I have a feeling that once
Generation 2 of the Ami comes out there'll be a whole lot of new
enthusiasm to go around.
{pp}
And what of us now unemployed editors (like we ever got paid in the
{bold}first{nobold} place)?   I don't think anyone will be leaving the
Amiga scene.  Speaking for myself, I intend on sticking it through for
some time to come.  I love the Amiga OS, the whole pride in
programming instead of the cludge approach to muddy programming seen
to frequently out in the Winblowz world.  When I buy a higher spec
machine I want an OS that can SHOW me that increased capabaility, NOT
one that sucks up what improvement there is so that I might was well
be on a 286-spec system.  My new-found spare time will be used for
what I've been doing on mny Amiga all along.  Writing.
{pp}
Didn't know I was a writer, did you?  Well, an
as-yet-to-be-published-fantasy writer and I'm very picky about the
machine I type all my (hopefully to be classic) stories on and have no
time for the many and amusing eccentricies of Windoz.  If you want to
keep track of me then just link to {link http://members.tripod.com/~dr-strange}http://members.tripod.com/~dr-strange{end}.  I'll know it's you.
{pp}
Well, it's time now to close the curtain on all of this, but first my
own personal thanks.  I want to thank all our present and past
editors, you the faithful reader, and of course our first editor and
founder Chris Seward who somehow roped me into all this.  First for
the Web column then to Articles Editor and then as Chief Editor, it's
been a long ride.  I don't have a social life anyway, so Chris thanks
for giving me something to fill up a few free evenings with.
{pp}
It is with keyboard in hand and a catch in my throat that I thank you
one and all and take my last bow.
