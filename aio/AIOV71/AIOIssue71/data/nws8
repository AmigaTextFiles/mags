At the complete new prinzip "reconfigurable computer"the borders of
the austere separation of graphiccard,soundcard an d processor are
coming together. The new computer is so flexible that it is able to
adapt itself to the programms, which should run on it. To the
demonstartion nearly all programms could be used, which were written
for the legendary C-64, the most sold computer of the World
(Guinessbook of world records). The C-One is much more faster and
contains about standard interfaces for communication with the world.
Modern equipment could be locked at the C-One, but also the
peripherals, of the lovely calld "Breadbox" computer of the 80 ies is
getting a use.
