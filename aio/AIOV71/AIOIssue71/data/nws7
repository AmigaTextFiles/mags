{subhead}Bluetooth-Adapter on Amiga (RS232){def}
{left}
{pp}
On a Bluetooth-enabled PC, Amiga Explorer also works with a Bluetooth serial adapter
attached to the Amiga serial port. The PC side must support the Bluetooth Serial Port
Profile, which makes it possible to select the Amiga side as a standard COM port in
Amiga Explorer. Depending on the adapter, no configuration may be required (the
adapter attached to the Amiga serial port automatically runs as a "slave"), or, in
some cases, the adapter must first be connected to the PC serial port and configured
via the included software. Some adapters have a built-in web server which allows for
remote configuration.
{pp}
In either case, no Bluetooth software is required on the Amiga. A 9-pin to 25-pin
adapter may be required to connect a 9-pin Bluetooth RS-232 adapter to the Amiga
DB-25 serial port connector. Such Bluetooth devices can cost as much as $200.00,
and include Blue2Space's blue2link, Sphinx Elektronik's PICO Plug, LinTech's
Bluetooth RS232 Adapter, Inventel's BlueAirPlug, Laurde's Serial Port Adapter
and SMART Modular Technologies' Blue Lapis Serial Port Adaptor (these devices
are not endorsed and have not been tested by Cloanto).
