Hello Mark
{pp}
it is very hard to see and sad that one of the last amiga mags will die!
in germany we have no online mag anymore (all rip)  with AIO and the crypt
you are the last english mag!
{pp}
you wrote you will come back perhaps if there is a new amiga ready but if
everyone will only wait the amiga dies faster! :-(
{pp}
i think there is enough stuff to write,remember here in germany is the last
commerciell print mag released every month with full stuff (amigaplus)
{pp}
if there a no more mags who will review new amiga products?
{pp}
hmm i hope it would be possible to buildt a new team of writeres!
{pp}
i wish you all the best for the future and saya big but sad thank you for
your great mag and work!
{pp}
keep the amiga alive!

Best Regrads Olaf - the fire still burns!

All this years were wonderfull reading the AIO.
I want to thank you for making it uptoday.
Sad that its going down. However the spirit is still
there. We have amigart, ann, amiga-news etc etc
that still is going on. So there is still something for
everyone. Not much amiga news today but it sure will be
more when OS4 is released...
{pp}
Thanks again and maybe in future there will be a new
AIO reborn.
{pp}
Great regards / Kicko

Very sad to read this... But i totally understand it, as sad as it might be,
the Amiga community is shrinking so its very hard to make profit enough to keep it going.
{pp}
I whish you good luck in whatever you people do in the future!

It's the effort of people such as yourselves that have made the Amiga
community so intimate and colleagial. The affiliation and relationships
have marked an enjoyable part of my life. Time to move on for us all.
{pp}
Thanks for all the effort over the years guys. Best wishes.

Hope that this is only end of the begining for Amiga users. Alternative
computing doesn't deserve to die. AIO was important piece of
information mostly for those without internet. Sadly there's nothing to
write about. Hope the situation will change with full release of PegasosII
with MorphOS and AmigaOS4. Rest In Peace and thanks for making Amiga computing more fun.

I'm sorry to hear that AIO is closing. It filled a vacuum created with the
departure of Amiga Report and became increasingly important after the
closure of Amiga Active. Hopefully the decision to close will not be final
and the 'zine will return in better times.
{pp}
Best wishes to all involved in the production process.{p}

Thanks for all the good reading throgh the yaers. I have been reading this
nice mag since number 23 and it's a pity that you dissappear. Hopfully with a
stronger AMIGA-market there will be a reborn of you again in some way.

Hi Mark,{p}
       That's a shocker! =:o I'm all kind of choked about this. With rumors
of a new CEO, the continous waiting for the Aone, and this AIO headline,
makes for unhappy Amiga camping. :-\{p}
       Nice picture on the Front Cover!{p}
