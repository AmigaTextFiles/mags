I would to say a great "Bravo" to all AIO menbers. it was a very good job since 6 years.
I'm an e-zine editor too and I can say making such a monthly free magazine is a real exploit.
{pp}
Thanks for all.

Hello!
{pp}
I would like to thank you for your work and all the issues of AIO. It is sad
that I will not be receiving the sumary of the whole month. It was always
pleasure and fun to read AIO, to get some news, to be up-to-date
(especially when you are modem owner and doing everything you can to change
- it is impossible).
{pp}
I hope you will come back in AIO - The Next Generation. I will be looking
forward to it!

Hello AIO,
{pp}
your software magazine was really great. It is
true, there is nothing interesting around the
Amiga to write. A very few infos.. and almost of
the people have the Internet. I'll keep AIO in
my memory.
{pp}
cheers,

Hi!
{pp}
I really hopes that you will come back when the NG Amigas are released! AIO
is one of the best things that the amiga community has! It's a pleasure to
use with the great looking GUI that you've done and it's free, it just
can't be better.
{pp}
Anyway... thanks a lot for everything that you've done and I hope to see
you soon again!
{pp}
Regards /Jorgen Danielsson
