Date              Event</B>              
                  
1982              Hi-Torro company created by Jay Minor and Dave Morris (later 
                  renamed  to Amiga Inc). Team included RJ Mical, Carl Sassenrath,
                  Dale Luck and others. They developed the first prototype Amiga 
                  called  'Lorraine' made of loads of breadboards and lots of chips
                  (which broke .. frequently).

1984              January 4th. First Amiga prototype hardware displayed at 
                  the  Winter CES. Boing ball demo shown.

1985            * Amiga Inc getting very short of cash. Atari and SGI were 
                  first interested but Commodore gave the best offer of 
                  $4.25 a share.

                  In June, the first silicon based Amiga shown. Not many 
                  people could believe the kind of graphics it could do. 

                  <img src="a1000.jpg" alt="Very First Amiga A1000">  
                  A1000
                  
                  On July 23rd, the A1000 was displayed  with Andy WarHol 
                  at the launch who drew a picture of Blondie on the spot. 
                * The A1000 was released in September. It cost half the 
                  price of a EGA based PC.
 
                  Amiga World magazine released. The famous Juggler demo 
                  released.

1986              Original A2000 designs were rejected by Commodore, instead 
                  they went for a German design. As a result, more than half 
                  of the  original Amiga crew were laid off. Within months, 
                  none of the original crew remained.

                  Defender of the Crown game released. It was so impressive 
                  that it sold thousands of Amigas.

1987            * The Amiga 500 and the A2000 were released. Both came with Workbench
                  1.2, although upgraded to Workbench 1.3 later (which has Hard disk
                  boot code, Recoverable RAM (RAD:) and New Console).

1988              Sales of the Amiga rose.

1989              Batman Pack (A500) released. It sold in the 100,000s.

1990              The Amiga became the world's best selling home computer.

                  On April 24th, the Amiga A3000 was unveiled and in May 
                  it was released. It had the new Workbench 2.0.
                  
                  <img src="cdtv.jpg" alt="CDTV"> 
                  Commodore Dynamic Total Vision (CDTV)
                  
                  In June, the CDTV was released, which looked like a VCR 
                  with a  CDROM and used the old Kickstart 1.3. It was very 
                  expensive, and marketed not as a Amiga  computer but a 
                  home appliance. 
                  
                * In August, the A500+ was released which had ECS chipset and 
                  Workbench 2.04 There were problems with software 
                  compatibility as a lot of  programs hit the hardware which 
                  didn't work on the new hardware which caused a few problems 
                  for new buyers.

                  In November, the Newtek Video Toaster was released. It was 
                  widely used in TV and Video productions including some 
                  famous ones such as B5, Seaquest DSV, Star Trek TNG, 
                  Quantum Leap, Robocop, Alladin and Jurrasic Park etc.

1991              The CDTV was a financial failure and Commodore themselves 
                  made some mistakes as well. The A600 was unveiled which was 
                  no better than the A500+ (although it included PCMCIA port 
                  and IDE interface, but some had ROMs with no scsi.device 
                  in it!), it didn't have a keypad.

1992              The A3000+ was shown which had AGA and was very expandable, 
                  but  Commodore scrapped it, in favour of the A4000.

                  A600
                  
                * In March the A600 was released, it caused an outcry for 
                  those people who still bought the older A500/A500+ (CBM 
                  never released information until the last minute). 

                  Amiga Format magazine, reached reader figures of 130,000 
                  and peaked at 160,000 readers.
 
                  On September 11, the A1200 was unveiled which had AGA 
                  and Workbench 3. It was an actual prototype but if it
                  was developed further it could have been even better.

                * The A4000 was released in December and the A1200 was 
                  released slightly later to cash in on the Christmas
                  sales. The A4000 was good but was priced too high.

1993              Commodore starts laying off people, the new AAA chipset
                  is shelved due to lack of money. Rumours of Commodore's
                  demise is rife and the PC starts to gain a lead over the
                  Amiga.
                  
                  Amiga Report, an online magazine by Jason Compton, was 
                  started in March.

                  By April, the A1200 reached 100,000 sales.
                  Workbench 3.1 was released to developers for testing.
                  The Emplant Emulator was also announced this month, which
                  emulates the Apple Mac.

                  <img src="cd32.jpg" alt="CD32">
                  CD32
                  
                  In September, the CD32 console was released (contained a 
                  CDROM drive and AGA chipset). It had a lukewarm reception
                  and Commodore promised lots of games for it - which never
                  appeared. They planned advertising, costing £7million.

1994              In March, Commodore announced huge losses and by April 
                  they laid off a lot of their staff. By the 25th, only
                  30 employees were left, of the original 1000.
 
                  On Wednesday the 27th, the West Chester facility was
                  closed down.

               *  Finally, on Friday April 29th, 4:10, Commodore filed
                  for liquidation.

                  Later, another sad event, occured, Jay Miner, the 'father'
                  of the Amiga, died on June 20th due to a long illness
                  in El Camino Hospital In Mountain View.

1995              Chelsea Football Club considered taking legal action 
                  against Commodore for due sponsership money.

                  Commodore UK tried a management buyout until the last
                  minute.

                  On March 1st, the Amiga World magazine was cancelled.

               *  In April, Escom and Dell fought over Commodore. Escom
                  offered £7m while Dell offered £15m but wasnt sure they
                  wanted the Amiga...!? Escom won the contest.

                  <img src="a4000t.jpg" alt="A4000T">
                  A4000T
                  
                  Escom created Amiga Technologies to sell the A1200 
                  and A4000T which went back into production. There was
                  a small problem with Escom made A1200s, the floppy drive
                  had a small flaw that caused some programs to fail to
                  load! The A4000T was priced at £2000-£2500 for 040/060
                  Amigas...!

                  On April 16th, GVP went out of business. They were very
                  popular hardware manufacturers for the Amiga (GVP-M have
                  now taken over).

1996              On April 11th, Viscorp (STB company) announces that it 
                  will try to  buy the Amiga from Escom (they tried all
                  year, keeping the community in the lurch).

                  A range of 15" and 17" monitors will be released for use 
                  on the Amiga by Microvitec on 8th May.
                  
                  May 15th, Phase 5 announces its PowerUp accelerator 
                  boards for the Amiga.
                  Also, Eagle Computers announce that they will make
                  A4000TE computers.

                  Walker prototype  Walker Innards
                  
                  The Walker was shown to the public, it used AGA, had a CD,
                  floppy drive, a standard sized motherboard and Zorro slots
                  but the Black curved casing caused some controversy - 
                  Darth Vader's helmet, a vacuum cleaner?!

                * On July 15th, Escom filed for bankrupty. They bought out 
                  hundreds of shops across the country and underestimated 
                  the growth of PC sales.

                  In a shock move, Carl Sasserath (author of Amiga's Exec)
                  resigns from Viscorp on Nov 24th.

                  On Nov 29th, Viscorp's bid for the Amiga was cancelled.

                  Jason Compton (author of Amiga Report) resigns as spokes
                  man from Viscorp, disillusioned, on Dec 4th.

                  Amiga Power, a games magazine, was closed in September.

1997              On Feb 1st, QuikPak (makers of A4000s) makes a bid for
                  the Amiga.

                  On March 2nd, Phase 5 announces that they will be making
                  the CyberStormPPC and BlizzardPPC boards which will 
                  use fast PowerPC 603/604 chips along with 68040/68060
                  to run OS functions.

                  Villagetronic discovers that the number of OS 3.1
                  upgrade kits are in short supply by March 19th.

                  Vulcan and Clickboom took on the Amiga market and managed
                  to release new games. Myst and Quake were converted to
                  the Amiga and sold thousands of copies.

                * On March 27th, a new owner was found for the Amiga.
                  Gateway 2000, bought out Amiga from Escom and rename Amiga
                  Technologies to Amiga International to sell the remaining
                  stocks of Amiga to the public. They have sold a lot to
                  various third world countries including India.

                  May 9th, Haage &amp; Partner announces that they will bring 
                  Java to the Amiga (we are still waiting in '99).

                  Amiga Inc, the Research and Development arm was opened to
                  develop the new Amiga. Staff includes Jeff Shindler,
                  Dr Havemose, Bill McEwen and Fleecy Moss (who later left). 

                  In June, Amiga User International magazine closed and 
                  Amiga Computing in July. Finally, Amiga Review closed
                  as well due to lack of advertising.

                  Access
                  
                  On July 5th, Index Info. gets a licence to make Amigas
                  such as the Access machine and the BoXeR.
                   
                  On July 10th, Intrinsic Computers also get a licence!

                  On Sept 15th, Amiga Intl now has a list of spare parts
                  to sell.

                  Cloanto releases Amiga Forever CD containing UAE and
                  Kickstarts and Workbenchs licenced from Amiga Intl
                  on 10th Oct.

                  DCE Gmbh gains a licence to sell its own Amigas on
                  October 29th.

                  On Nov 11th, Index releases their Access Amiga box to
                  the world.  Ideal for information points etc.

                  Amiga Intl. announces that a large order of Amiga 
                  1200s are going to India on Dec 21st.

1998            * 15th May, World of Amiga show, gave a shock to the Amiga
                  Community. They announced Amiga OS 4 (actaully Amiga OS 5
                  dev) to be run on an industry standard developer machine
                  (x86 based) at around US$999. 

                  The current Amiga range is declared to be legacy or
                  'Amiga Classic'. Amiga OS 3.5 upgraded has been cancelled.

                  AmigaOS 5 machines will be aimed at Digital Convergance
                  platform for customers. No details of processor or
                  hardware were released.
 
                * At the Amiwest show in July, further details about the
                  AmigaII or AmigaNG were released:
                   3D graphics, Dolby AC3, multi-MPEG decoding, Internet,
                  scalable multimedia processors, HDTV, OpenGL, Java,
                  Firewire, USB, ADSL and Autoconfiguration!

                  At the MAE show in October, Amiga Inc, announces that
                  AmigaOS 3.5 WILL after all be developed as a gift for
                  the Amiga community. Features includes new interface,
                  better CDFS, Internet capabible, better printer support,
                  RTG and RTA (later dropped), PPC support, new FFS,  plus 
                  bugs fixed from WB 3.1.

                  On November 11th, Amiga Inc, announces that QNX Software
                  Systems Ltd will utilise the QNX realtime OS as the
                  foundation for the Next Generation Amiga.

                  Due to loss of a partner the Developer box did not appear. 

1999              On February 26th, Jim Collas will take over Amiga Inc
                  and has moved its HQ to San Diego and start Fast
                  Track Development Plans. Former head, Jeff Shindler 
                  will take over product strategy for the new Amiga.

                  On July 16th, Amiga Inc releases Technology brief detailing
                  their new Amiga Operating Environment using AmigaObjects,
                  and Java using the Linux (instead of QNX) operating system.

                  They also announced the specification of the Amiga Multimedia
                  Convergence Computer (MCC) based on a unknown High-performance
                  next generation CPU and the latest hardware technology such as
                  SDRM, 3D graphics, DVD, MPEG, TV, 16bit surround sound etc.

                  Phase 5 announces the new AmiRage K2 computer based on the 
                  PowerPC and using QNX as the operating system instead of Linux
                  on 5th August.

                  In a shock move, Jim Collas, President of Amiga, resigns, 
                  probably due to differences of strategy with Gateway. Tom 
                  Schmidt takes over as President (1/9/99)

                  Amiga files 17 new patents on various Digital Convergence
                  technologies.
