I'm saddened to know that AIO #issue 71 will be the last one ever.
{pp}
Because of my involvement in several Amiga related projects, I lack
the spare time to be a regular reader of disk based magazines, and
the fact that I'm betatesting OS4 severely reduces the chances that
something which usually opens its own screen (using potentially
demo-like, OS unfriendly code) may work properly.
{pp}
Not such problem with AIO. If I could point out only one good thing about
it, that would be the neat layout. While the first time that I looked
it felt awkward to use when compared to pure HTML, I can't but praise
how nicely it was all lately integrated. And while you can sometimes
scream when finding the odd typo (but then again this comes from a
"professional" proofreader), you can't argue that the whole thing
oozed good will and a desire to keep going despite the lack of real
happenings in the Amiga scene and new products to review - and then,
of course, you have the current batch of the called "news" sites,
making disk based magazines less and less appealing to the casual
reader as people gets hooked to the anarchy and the innuendo transpiring
the place. A shame really.
{pp}
I'd suggest reviewing also MorphOS related products, but then again
I guess you decided to stick to Amiga-only related stuff? Nothing to
say about that really, but perhaps you might consider this option
until things get better in the Amiga front.
{pp}
Nevertheless, I wish you all the best of luck, folks. If only AIO set
the minimum standards that an Amiga online magazine had to meet, that
would be on its own a great service to this community.

Hasta la vista,

Hello,
{pp}
My name is Michal Bergseth, 23 years old and oldtime Amiga user. I own
www.amigaworld.org and it started up not so long ago. 23.04.03 to
be correct. Its been on-line before, but because of problems with the
hosted webserver for a year ago. Its been a bit hard for the new
webhost company here in Norway to get it to me.
{pp}
I also do a Amiga magazine here in Scandinavia, called Amitopia. So
www.amigaworld.org is a part of Amitopia. The articles that we get for
Amitopia, will after 4-5 weeks be on-line for everyone. AmigaWorld does
also give guides and tips on how to improove and give Amigas
a better life. hehe :)
{pp}
Well, now its all oki and AmigaWorld Magazine is on-line!
{pp}
If you feel that you want to write for AmigaWorld.org or maybe our magazine
could use your articles and so on? Thats all up
to you offcourse. I would like to takeover for you. If there are some
contributors or will to contribute. Youre all welcome!
{pp}
Regards,{p}
Michal, editor of Amitopia and webmaster of AmigaWorld Magazine{p}
