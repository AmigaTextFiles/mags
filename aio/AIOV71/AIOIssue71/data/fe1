In my last Strange Opinion, I thought it dueto comment on a recent post
to a popular news group.  Apparently there is some blood-sucking lawyer
type is tryingto get a class-action lawsuit against Amiga by all Amiga
Club Members, suing apparently for the liusey $50 and promising that
if they participate they'll no doubt never get any merchandice again.

Is someone out there CRAZY!?!  Amigais finishing up the first
revolutionary OS update in ages, nearly from scratch (and mind you,
developing a modern-day OS normally takes YEARS), and someone out
there wants to start a lawysuit that would no doubt take the entire
company completely DOWN?!  The only that THAT would guarrentee is
complete {bold}{italic}oblivion.{noitalic}{nobold}

Okay, so there's been no T-shirts or coupons yet. Considering those
coupons are meant to be applied towards the purchase of OS4 then just
what good would they do before OS4 is finished?  When the new OS is
done then they'll mail out the coupons.  As for the T-shirts, given a
choice between a completed OS and somne shirt, I'll take the OS any
day.

So someone wants to sue Amiga over a late T-shirt?  I hope I'm not
theonly one that sees how silly this all is. The fact that this even
comes upis both laughable and frightening.  On the eve of a brand new
OS someone wants to take it all down over a piece of cotton. This all
sounds excrutiatingly self-defeating.

Are we sure this guy's not being paid off my Microsoft?
