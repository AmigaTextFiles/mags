In co-operation and with permission of Maik Schmidt Amiga Arena makes the release of

AlphaBase is a clear and easy to learn database program. It is possible to enter
variously arranged (e.g. German and American) addresses in one common database.
Addresses can be printed on envelopes and labels. Data which have nothing to do
with addresses can be linked with comments, pictures and sound files.

System requirements: AmigaOS 3.0 Workbench & Librarys as well as 1 MB ChipMem +
2 MB FastMem
