{subhead}AMIGA-MANIA Gets On-Line File  Server{def}
{left}
{pp}
New Special AMIGA-MANIA File Server online now in the
#Amiga-Mania channel in GalaxyNet when SysOP - Songonco are online.
{pp}
This new special Amiga FServer contains all the last new Amiga aplications,
patchs, Librarys, Emulators, Fonts, last 2 AIO magazines, Games, MP3,
etc., all now online.
{pp}
For the commands to search and download the files ask the SysOP
Songonco :)
{pp}
Works good, fast, and easy, a special for all Amiga-Mania channel
users to enjoy.  I await Amigans feedbacks ;)
{pp}
I get a 24h Net Cable connection soon here. When I have this faster
cable connection here I can spend more time online in #Amiga-Mania
channel in GalaxyNet, so I like to see all real Amigans there.
{pp}
I try to join all real Amigans there, programmers, musicians, GFX
designer, etc to do new Amiga projects, a p2p for Amiga is one of
these projects.
{pp}
Best regards,{p}
