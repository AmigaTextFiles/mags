With news of the completion of Elbox's Mediator PCI expansion for the
A1200, Eyetech have announced their own version including PCI, as they

"The Predator will be available in two different form factor designs, one
for the A4000 desktop and one for the A1200.  The A1200 form factor version
will come with 3xPCI and 1 x AGP simultaneously usable slots and will fit
in any tower capable of taking a Z4 busboard.  The A4000 desktop form
factor version will come with 2xPCI and one AGP slots plus one shared PCI
and regular, Video Toaster-compatible A4000 video/Zorro3 slot (making 4
simultaneously usable slots altogether).  Both form factor versions will
also have provision for a G3/G4 PPC & SDRAM slot.  Each form factor design
will be available in two versions, the Predator-SE and the Predator-Plus.
The Predator-SE will be a low cost version supporting PCI cards only,
albeit over the high speed PPC local bus connector (see below).  The
Predator-Plus will be the fully featured version with AGP, G3/G4 and SDRAM
slots activated.  A trade-in/upgrade option will be available for
purchasers of the Predator-SE who subsequently wish to add Predator-Plus
facilities."
