Well, it's September and Olympic season, so you'll all be seeing no end
of Olympic programming.News channels, television, Internet, radio,
endless sources of Olympic Information...
{p} {p}
Which means you won't need {bold}me{nobold} telling you anything more.
No Olympic {italic}anything{noitalic} here.  Just a bunch of fun
sites...

Prawnography{p}

Okay, so I'll finally give you a Porn site.  Softcore, Hardcore,
fetishes, gay, movies, the works.  Every type of porn you perverts out
there could ever want...
{p}
...Okay, so it all just happens to be between shellfish.  Prawn
Pornography, and that's about as close as you'll ever get from me, so
there.  :)

PvPonline.com- The Daily Online Comic{p}
http://www.pvponline.com/{p}
Another ddaily online comic, this one with a cast of regular characters
that includes such magazine production types as an Editor in Chief that
likes 80's arcade games, a pompous know-it-all creative director, two
professional slackers, and an intern that's a Troll.  A fun read.

The Spark{p}
http://www.thespark.com/{p}
Name a test and they have it here.  And such tests!  The Wealth test,
Sex Test, Unintelligence Test, Purity Test, Death Test, Pregnancy Test,
a Personality Test and more. And if that's not enough, there's Cupid,
Stinky Meat, Stinky Feet, and a poetry contest. Lots of fun.

The Darwin Awards{p}
http://www.officialdarwinawards.com{p}
An awards site of sorts, but this award is given, usually posthumously,
to the individual(s) who remove themselves from the gene pool in the most
spectacular fashion.  For instance; the guy who would have lived through
his car crash had he not had his finger up his nose at the time
(straight into his brain; OUch!), or the drunken guy who thought he aw
ants on his genitalia so proceded to take them out with a hammer-
genitalia and all. Stupidity of this sort is not only too bizzare to
make up but loads of fun to read.

Pick Of The Month

{p} {p}
The Satyr{p}
http://thesatyr.com{p}
Another satirical news site, this one with a blend of blatantly manufactured
articles with enough ones that just {italic}might{noitalic} be real to
leave you laughiung as you wonder just how stupid the world might really
be.
{p} {p}
There's their Top News section, of course, with headlines that say it
all.  "Survivor Winner Dies Of Irony".  Or how's about "Angry Woman
Waving Arms Must Be Having Her Period".  Or for the kiddies, "Big Bird
Killed Off In Season Opener Of Sesame Street".  All based on current and
topical events.
{p} {p}
The News In brief includes such enthrawling tidbits as report on how
well the wet paint is drying at some small town's store, or how some
three kids were lost on a game of Hide and Seek.  All news appear to be
updated periodically enough to make this site worth a daily check.
{p} {p}
Some comics can also be found here.  Lexx (no, not THAT Lexx), Three
Reasons, and Dysentary.  And if their names aren't enough to entivce
you, then trust me, at least one or two of them are worth the look.
{p} {p}
Then the departments are out there as well.  Want to see if you might be
a killer?  Then take the onlin inkblot test.  Or maybe send an ekiss?
Or, for the interviews junkies, there's "Random Interviews With
Strangers".
{p} {p}
Getting the idea that maybe this guy's the online version of Dave
Letterman?
{p} {p}
Finally, even the links column is full of links that look bizzare enough
just by their titles: Fugly, School Of Ass, or even Dookieburger.
{p} {p}
Whichever way you see it, The Satyr is one funny site.  Hmm,... I wonder
if a few of their links might make good future web articles...
