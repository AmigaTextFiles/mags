Yes, Virginia, AIO now has a Technical Editor!
{p} {p}
As you may have seen from this issue's Tech Guy article,  Paul Harvey
will be doing a monthly technical column, with subjects ranging 
hardware and soft.  A feature that AIO has long been lacking and one
for which I have been searching for someone to fulfill, we can fill a
void requested by many AIo readers.  So, look forward to Paul's
monthly additions to AIO.

But wait, there's more!
{p} {p}.
Paul will also be our Tech Guy to which {bold}you{nobold} the reader
can send in you questions for which he will supply answers right in
an AIO column.  Have questions about some program?  Maybe hardware
compatibility or if a certain new board is compatible with your
hardware configuration?  Well, just write them down and email them to
Paul.  He'll try and answer you both in Email and in the more public
annals of AIO.
