Here at Kickstart we are big fans of the excellent range of Amiga
hardware available from the French Amiga developers, Ateo Concepts,
and have many happy users.
{p} {p}
 They still provide one of the most economic
and simpliest ways of having a graphics card on an Amiga 1200 tower
using their superb Pixel64 card on the Ateo Bus Board system.{p}
 Plus their range of other exapnsion cards is constantly growing and now
includes such delights as Fast Serial and Parallel cards, Ethernet
cards and a SCSI card.
p} {p}
To help promote their products here in the UK we have decided to
include this installation Guide on our web site, just to show you all
how simple and rewarding a purchase it is.
{p} {p}
We can also supply the highly recommended {bold}"Kickstart Ateo Installation Kit"{nobold} to ease the job even further.

The Ateo equipment can be engineered to fit most towered A1200s, but
to ease installation into the popular Power Tower it is best to use
the Kickstart Ateo Installation Kit shown here.{p} It includes custom
wiring to maintain the use of the activity lights, plus mounting
bracket and posts for easy fitment.
