You now need to attach the two large ribbon cables from the
Interface/Breakout board into the two sockets on the top of the Bus
Board.{p}
The sockets on each board are numbered 1 and 2, ensure they are
plugged in so 1 goes to 1 and 2 goes to 2.  {p}
At this stage you should also supply power to the Interface/Breakout
board using a small power connector from you PSU onto the socket on
the back of the board as shown in the photo.

Now supply the power to the A1200 motherboard.{p} Use another small power
connector from your PSU and plug it into what used to be the DF0 power
connection on the motherboard (see photo).
