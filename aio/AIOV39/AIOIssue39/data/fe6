Amiga user groups can be hard to find, and in many cases non-existent.  
Perfect example:  I live in southern California and you'd think with all 
the population around here there'd be {italic}something{noitalic}.  
Well, realizing that my position is not by far unique, I've come up with
this idea.

If you're looking for either a user group in your area, or failing that 
want to find enough local Amigans to get one started, then just post it 
here!  Send in your region (Country: region or county, local majpor
cities), name, and optional contact info.  It will then be posted here 
for all others to read.  If another reader sees that you're in his area 
and {italic}knows{noitalic} of a local group, then he can respond to 
either you or through this column for the benefit of others.  Failing 
that, said second person might be interested in a new user group as well 
and can then contact either you directly or via this column.  Either 
way, there's a chance that you might get connected up.

In other words, AIO is willing to act as a catalyst in the promotion of
Amigan User Group formation.  Just mail any such User Group search
requests to:{p}

with a Subject title of:{p}
User Group Search.

That said, I'll start this bit off myself. Behold below, my little User
Group Search add:
