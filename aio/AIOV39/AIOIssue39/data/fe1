Floppy Disk Drives:{p}
Have an A4000 and trouble with inserted disks?  Keep getting bad or
unknown disk with every other insert? Simply use Diskchange (comes with
the OS) to have the system re-read the disk and all will be fine. I
put it on a menu option myself, though a hotkey will do as well.

Also, if you have a second disk drive and it's not an original Chinon
drive, then it's probably one of those PC drives with a hardware hack at
the rear. These types are unreliable and can actually mess up a high
density disk on a write. Use your High Density disks in the original
Chinon drive only.

Voyager:{p}
The most recent version of Voyager seems more crash prone, but a
completely new re-write is on the way. In the meantime you may want to
go back to an older version, as I've found that not even the likes of
CyberGuard will stop Voyager from bringing down my system when it really
wants to.

New Hard Drives:{p}
We all know that the Directory Caching option can be useless or
downright dangerous when used on modern harddrives as they now all come
with their own on-board cache. But, beware also of other programs that
might use their own form of caching, including some emulators that I
suspect might be culprits.
