An update on AROS, the Amiga compatible OS, from Aaron "Optimiser" Digulla:
{p} {p}
Again, more than one month has passed since the last status update *sigh*.
It's not that there are no news; it's me :-) Ok, again whole six weeks of
news:
{p} {p}
Michael Schulz had to stop working on AROS Native/i386 because he's moving.
Nonetheless, the native version of AROS boots (you can move the mouse and
you will see some windows) but since there still is no filesystem, you
cannot run any programs.  We try to get the sources for SFS to fix this.
The author has been positive to open the sources but he wants to clean them
first.
{p} {p}
Work is also being done to make AROS boot with Bochs and VMware.  It
already works with VMware but VMware is quite expensive.
{p} {p}
Also, we try to compile AROS on UAE ({link http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~uae/}http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~uae{end})
with the new JIT ({link http://byron.csse.monash.edu.au/}http://byron.csse.monash.edu.au{end}) by Bernie Mayer.  The
JIT seems to work, the compile doesn't (yet).  This would be a great step
to help to debug AROS.
{p} {p}
Some bugs were introduced into BGUI by porting it to AROS but these were
squased.  BGUI now compiles on AROS and AmigaOS.  We plan to develop our
version of the Workbench with it.  Also, work has begun to move the BGUI
site to the AROS site (which means that it will be much more often be down
;-) Honestly, I'm working on fixing this :-)
{p} {p}
Also, the AROS port to NetBSD/x86 has been updated (it compiles again) plus
there is a new port to Solaris/sparc.  The new port compiles but AROS
doesn't start, yet.
{p} {p}
On a sad note, the AROS project at my company, the Sowatec AG
(http://www.sowatec.com/) has not started.  On the positive side, it has
not been dropped, either.  The problem is that we simply cannot find enough
people to staff it.  So if you're living in Europe, interested in the Amiga
and willing to work with PCs and Unix, please get in contact with us (the
restriction with Europe is just because of the problems we would have to
get a work permission for you plus the higher risk we would impose in you
moving here).
