Trogladite Software are currently looking for more developers.  We are not
funded in any way, and you will be generally working for free communicating
with the other members over the internet.  We need people who have a fair
amount of free time as we will be coming up with various new projects to
create very soon.  If you're interested, email neil@trogsoft.org.  C or C++
skills preferred.
