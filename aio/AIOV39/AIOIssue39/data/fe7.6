Now carefully slide the female side of the Ateo Interface/Breakout
board onto the A1200 expansion edge connector (where an accelerator
card would normally go) and push down.{p}

Now add your accelerator card to the male edge connector of the Ateo
interface/Breakout card as shown.{p}
The photo shows an Apollo '040 card,

accelerator card for the Ateo Bus to operate correctly, it will not
work on a standard '020 powered Amiga 1200).
