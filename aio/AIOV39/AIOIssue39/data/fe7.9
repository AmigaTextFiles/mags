Here we have mounted the main body of it on a standard tower back
plate and the toggle switch on a spare front blanking panel. We have
then mounted it in a spare expansion slot at the back of the tower.{p}

This is where your monitor will now connect.  The two ribbon cables
are then connected to the Scan-Doubler's output and to the Pixel64's
output respectively. Also note that the switch requires a power
supply, so connect a spare cable from your PSU.

To flick between AGA and Graphics Card output is now just a case of
simply operating the toggle switch on the front of the tower.  Very
handy for older AGA-only Games, and of course it gives you instant
access to the early boot screen when your Amiga has a tantrum !

We hope this helps with the installation of Ateo's products, and we
hope it helps you get more from your Amiga.
