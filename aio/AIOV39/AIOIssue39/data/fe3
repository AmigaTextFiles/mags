PRESS RELEASE - 11.9.2000 - Innovative announces future plans
{p} {p}
Innovative, known as the developers of popular AMIGA®-titles such as
fxPAINT, fxSCAN, VHI Studio and Ultraconv today announced the future plans
of the enterprise.
{p} {p}
 fxSCAN 3.0 with intelligent OCR-engine (OCR = Optical Character Recognition)
{p} {p}
fxSCAN will soon be available in version 3.0.  It will be a major update
including the following new features:
{p} {p}
 intelligent OCR-engine{p}
 Support for free BetaScan-drivers{p}
 comfortable Copymachine-function{p}
 reworked user-interface{p}
 JPEG-files are now loaded via PPC{p}
 many small improvements{p}
{p} {p}
The price for V3.0 will be at 69.- DM/35 EURO/35 US$.  An update from
V1.0/V2.0 will cost 59.- DM/30 EUROR/30 US$.  We won't offer updates from
V1.0 SE (ScanQuix-special edition).  fxSCAN 3.0 can already be ordered from
Innovative's online-shop (http://www.innovative-web.de/) and will be
delivered as soon as the final product becomes available.  A completly new
fxSCAN-website will be online at the time the new version is introduced.

{bold}The present{nobold}
{p} {p}
Innovative regards the AMIGA®-market as too small to further exist only
from revenues of this market.  The enterprise doesn't see any tendencies
towards improvement, as key-enterprises have either left the AMIGA®-market
or went out of bussiness and important hardware-products are only available
as long as they are still in stock.  Faster, more up-to-date or completly
new hardware doesn't seem to be within reach and major improvements of the
current Classic-AmigaOS® are not to be expected in near future.  The AMIGA®
SDK is a highlight, but it is not a garantor for the future existance and
maintenance of the new AMIGA®-Operating-/Computersystems.
{p} {p}
The current situation forces Innovative to look for new markets and to no
more exclusivly work in the AMIGA®-market.
{p} {p}
{bold}The future{nobold}
{p} {p}
After the availability of fxSCAN V3.0, Innovative will intensify work on a
new technology (details are not available due to reasons of protecting
Innovative's intellectual property).  Programs developed with the aid of
this new technology (Codename "InNT") will be more comfortable to use and
will have an even more spectacular optic.  Furthermore programs developed
with it will be highly portable to other platforms and CPUs.  Indeed
porting an application is expected to take only a few days, cutting down
both the amount of development-time and -money that has to be spent for
that task.  As soon as the first version of this new technology is finished
we will start porting already known Innovative-titles to the new technology
and a variety of different platforms.  Besides the AMIGA®-market, the
Windows®- and Linux®-market will be target of the developments of the
company.  It's also planned to hand out licences for this new technology,
but this still has to be decided.  The result of the decision will be
announced in a later, seperate press release.
{p} {p}
{bold}The AMIGA®-conversions{nobold}
{p} {p}
We regret to say that our new technology will most probably not be able to
run on 68K-PPC- Dual-CPU-Systems as it is currently used in some AMIGA®s,
as a seperation of the GUI and the program will be hard to perform and a
68060 definatly seems to be too slow for fluid and comfortable work.  Once
the development of the first version of the new technology is finished,
Innovative will evaluate the possibilities of a portation to MorphOS and
APUS Linux and is currently planning a portation to these platforms.  The
Tao® Elate®-based new AmigaOS® will be supported by Innovative as far as it
is available.  This way, AMIGA®-users will be able to continue enjoying the
high-quality and highly innovative software by Innovative.
{p} {p}
{bold}The current products{nobold}
{p} {p}
It can't be denied that future plans are in conflict with the further
development of the current product-line for AMIGA®-computers.  Nevertheless
the currently existing products will be developed further and updates will
be available at a regular basis though not as often as in the past.  As
soon as the versions developed with the new technology are available, users
get an update-offer.  So everybody buying an Innovative- product today,
buys a product that will be developed further in future and that he will be
able to use even after switching to other OSes like Windows®, Linux® or
"Amiga® NG" as well.
{p} {p}
{bold}The webservices{nobold}
{p} {p}
We will stop offering webservices, as the amount of time and money spent
can in no way be justified with the resulting revenues.  Existing contracts
will continue to exist for a yet undefined time whereas we won't do any new
contracts.  Of course we will continue to offer special solutions for
companies in the future and we'll also keep updating the "Amiga Link
Directory".

*2.7.2000 VHI Studio reads from SonyR MemorysticksR!*{p}
Thanks to a new VHI-driver (sony_msac_sr1.vhi), AMIGAR-users finally can
access SonyR MemorysticksR. The driver uses the "SonyR MSAC-SR1"-reader
for the serial port, that is shipped with most SonyR-cameras. If you want
to see MemorysticksR and CompactflashR-cards compared regarding their
size, visit our website and click on "Press release" below to see some
