{center}{bold}Installing the Software:{nobold}{p}{left}
You are now ready to install the Ateo software supplied with their equipment.{p}
 Start with the disk labelled
{bold}"Installation: AteoBus, Picasso96, ModePro"{nobold} and follow the on-screen
instructions. This will activate the BusBoard and the Pixel64 card.
Once this is all working then follow with the installation of the
appropriate software for any other cards you have got.

All the software is also available to download from the Ateo web site

If you have chosen to fit the Pixel64 Graphics Card you may find it
annoying that you no longer have easy access to your old AGA screen
modes, but this can easily rectified.  If you have a Multi-Sync monitor
then fitting a simple monitor switch is all you need. If you have
upgraded to a SVGA monitor for your new Graphics Card, then fitment of
a Scan-Doubler and a monitor switch is what's required. {p}
In the example Amiga used for this guide we have fitted a Power
Computing Internal Scan-Doubler/Flicker-Fixer on the AGA outout for
SVGA compatibilty.  One of the nicest and most convenient ways to
switch between the output of your Pixel64 card and your scan-doubled
AGA output is to use one of the excellent Eyetech electronic video
switchers.  The model suitable for this example installation is the
SMON/V as shown.
