Big issue this month and a few changes to our staff.{p}
First off, we have a new Utilities Editor.  Between school, work, and
everything else, Lorens has just gotten too busy so something had to
give; our loss, it was us.  But fear not, after a long and thorough
search we now have Robert Karlsson, a good friend of Lorens, to
replace him.  Lorens has already given his blessing, so I'm sure
you'll enjoy Robert's and his writing style.
{p} {p}
Welcome aboard Robert, and good luck Lorens!

Next, you may have noticed a new addition in this month's heavily
packed Articles section. Just a little somerthing I've been searching
far and woide for, lo these many months, and that is AIO's new
{bold}Tech Guy{nobold}!  Paul Harvey is our new Technical editor, and
aside from doing monthly tech articles (a much requested feature), he
will also be handling all incoming technical articles.  So, if you
have any question about hardware, software, or whatever, just send it
in to Paul at paul@aio.co.uk and he'll try and answer your question
then post it in the Tech Guy Q & A section of AIO.

You asked for it, we found it. welcome to the team Paul.

Well, after all that welcoming some of you may still be wondering
about our deficient Games section.  Still working on that, and I have
do have someone that may be taking it up next month.  In the meantime,
enjoy David's contributions.

Well, that's about it for thi month.  Enjoy the isue and start writing
in to Paul.
