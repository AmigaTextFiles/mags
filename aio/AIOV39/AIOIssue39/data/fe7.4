P8 goes towards the front of the tower and P9 towards the back.{p}
The P8 and P9 cables from the PSU
may not be long enough so may need extending. If adding extensions be
sure to ensure continuity of colour codes and polarity. Also at this
stage, connect the blue wire from the Interface/Breakout board to the
connector labelled {bold}JP1{nobold} on the Bus Board.

Now add your chosen Ateo expansion cards into the slots on the Bus
Board.{p}
Support the Bus board by placing your hand behind it (between
it and the motherboard) and carefully slot in the cards.{p} They often
require quite a shove, so ensure they are lined up correctly before
applying any pressure.{p}
Shown here (from bottom to top) is the Pixel64
Graphics Card, the Fast Parallel and Serial Card, and the Ethernet
Card. Secure the expansion cards to the rear of the tower using the
screws at the ends, as originally supplied to hold in the blanking
plates.
