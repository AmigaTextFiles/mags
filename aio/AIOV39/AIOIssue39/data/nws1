CDs, PSX Controllers And Bug Fixing
{p} {p}
Sorry for the delay in writing this report - I've been on holiday for the
last week - but progress should be swifter from now on.  Despite this,
there's been a reasonable amount of progress this month, although a lot of
it has involved making new levels, so I can't tell you about that.  (Well,
I could, but then I'd have to kill you.  :) Apart from that, here's what's
new this month:
{p} {p}
CD audio playback code was added.  The game supports two CD playback modes
- continuous and radio (the music changes as you change vehicles).  The CD
playback routines run independently to the main game task, which means the
game isn't held up by the CD drive.  More bugs were fixed this month,
including one that took over a week to seek and destroy.  I was not amused.
I'm considering adding support for PSX controllers - let me know what you
think.  Two new weapons and a couple of new vehicles have been added.  But
I'm not going to tell you what they are.  :) The game engine has been
optimised to make it even faster.  A lot of the graphics used by the game
have been redrawn professionally.

That's all for this time - see you next month!
