Did you ever think that setting up different archivers in DOpus is to
hard for you? Or perhaps you just don't like fiddling around in the
CLI when you want to archive/extract your files, then this is a
program that definately would be worth to take a look at. MiraWizArc
is a frontend MUI-GUI for LhA, LZX, ZIP and UnZIP, all you have to do
really is to specify where the different programs needed are located
and then you're off, the configuration is really easy and
comfortable, just as it should be. It functions pretty much as
another share ware program called X-Arc, with a few differences, such
as that it is a frontend (X-Arc handles archives internally), and you
can't run installer scripts from within the archives like you can in
X-Arc, the latter mentioned would be quite handy, but it isn't
something you can't live without. The manual comes in form of
different text files, which aren't long at all, mainly because it
simply isn't needed, it comes in both English (translated by ATO) and
Italian - there are also Swedish locale and docs, translated by
myself actually, but I haven't got around to upload it to the Aminet
yet, I will do that now sometime. I also recall seeing Polish locale
available for this program on the Aminet. You can also specify a
reader, MultiView by default, to look at pretty much everything
you've got datatypes for within the archive, this is a very practical
feature.

The program is a sort of "e-mail ware" type of product, and you'll
obtain a personalised, CPU specific executable of the program, which
probably is a little faster than the non-registered version, simply
by specifying your name, organization, and a few other details. This
did however take quite a few weeks, at least it did for me, but I
have heard of others who registered and got the executable in just a
few days.
