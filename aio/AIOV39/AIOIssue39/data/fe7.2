First of all, remove your A1200 motherboard from the Power Tower and
disconnect the normal power supply cable at the back, this will no
longer be required and must {bold}NOT{nobold}be left in place.

Now replace the motherboard into the tower as normal.

When re-connecting any IDE Interface, ensure it is mounted as flat as
possible on the floor of the tower and is secured, or else it could
foul the Ateo Bus Board.{p}
Here a standard 4-way Buffered Interface is
shown neatly installed and secured down with cable ties passed through
small holes drilled in the floor of the tower.  Also at this stage,
remove any blanking plates that may be over the rear expansion
slots and disconnect the Power Tower LED interface from the
motherboard.

Using the parts in the Kickstart Ateo Installation Kit, screw the
posts to the mounting bracket, and then bolt the bracket to the Bus
Board as shown in the photo.{p}
