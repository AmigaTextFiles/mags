Continuing last months peek at audio encoding programs for the Amiga,
here's Pegase. What differs this one from previously reviewed
encoders is that it only encodes MP2 files. So, what about that? As
you may or may not know MP2 is an little older technique of keeping
audio files in a more convenient size. There are however downsides to
this, in order to get the same quality as a (good) MP3 encoder, you
have to use higher bitrates - 192 Kbit is as far as I know equivalent
to the quality of an 128 Kbit MP3 (provided that you compare 128 Kbit
with CD sound quality; my own tests show that an MP2 encoded in 192
Kbit gets a little thicker, fuller sound than that of a 128 Kbit
MP3). Pegase does not encode MPEG layer 3 songs because there are
patents issued by The Fraunhofer Institute that makes it difficult to
make MP3 encoding software, without having to pay royalties to them,
naturally if you are a hobby programmer, doing free- or share ware
programs, it's hard to cough up all that money that they want. What
are the good sides about it, then?

Yes, Pegase is blazingly fast, even on lowspec computers, highly
optimized and small. The quality generated by Pegase isn't bad at
all, so it's very usable indeed in case you're playing around with,
say, music of your own, and aren't lucky enough to have got your
hands on a PPC yet, and you want to check out how your AIFF saved
song sounds like, without having to wait all day for the MP3 encoder
to do the job instead. MP2 encoding isn't quite as demanding for the
CPU, so a little bit of Pegase's speed can be explained through that.
Pegase is based on the source code to the Amiga version of MusicIn,
and from thereon changed to its current state. It comes with an array
of CPU specific versions, from 030 up to even PPC. The manual is fast
and easy to get through, and describes all functions in an easy and
understandable way. Pegase also comes with locale support, which
should make French and Spanish users happy, English is inbuilt.
Pegase functions via the CLI, or it can be started from Workbench
where all commands are specified via tooltypes, and both ways work
just fine. The testing results below come from the CLI use of Pegase.

As you can see, amazingly fast! (The size of the file was about 49 megabytes; 4:38 minutes long)

A word of caution before I sign off with this review. The author of
Pegase has during the last couple of months recieved zero feedback
from it's users and is therefore likely to stop developing Pegase,
which I think would be very bad, Pegase is a really good complement
to MP3 encoding, especially if you don't have much juice in your
computer, so if you happen to test Pegase after reading this review,
take a few minutes to mail Pegase's author and tell him what you
think of it!
