We continue yet again in the audial realm of the Amiga (I really like
music, hehe), this time we're going to take a closer look at a nice
little program called The Mpeg Enc GUI. This is a frontend for a
large variety of new and old MPEG encoders available, and as a little
plus on top of all this it has a interface for MPEGA. Upon starting
this program we notice the nice MUI-GUI, showing the settings for
MusicIn, Pegase, Ncode, MP3Enc, Lame, BladeEnc and MPEGA. All
functions worth your attention are crammed into every possible (and
impossible) places, however, the default and most important settings
needed to get the best quality with the MPEG encoder of your choice
are easy both to find and to use (the basic functions of each encoder
is also available through the menu, such as stop and starting the
encoding, displaying the output window, saving the settings, etc).
One thing I in particular favour about this program is the ID3-Tag
editor, which is quite flexible and easy to use (I can't imagine an
ID3-Tag editor being hard to use, though). It also supports ID3 1.1
tags and all possible genres, and it's also possible to set the tags
of already existing MP3's. The best thing about this program is
however the ability to encode multiple files, which is just excellent
if you suddenly get the urge to backup a CD or two. Alongside the
main window is the encoder output window, which shows all statistics
printed out by the encoders themselves.

Over to the manual, which is by all means good, it covers everything
about the program, how to use it, and (in some cases) a bit outdated
links to where to find the MPEG encoders needed, but you probably
won't have too much trouble finding what you need anyway.

The Mpeg Enc GUI is something the autor refers to as "Key-mail ware",
which means that The Mpeg Enc GUI needs a keyfile to get rid of all
requesters that pop up now and then. Of course I got a keyfile of my
own - it took a few days to have it sent to me, so nothing to
complain about there.

This program is just great, even though I myself prefer using the
good old CLI instead of frontends, I can imagine how useful this
program is for those who doesn't. Only thing I sort of miss with this
program is the lack of pop-up help.
