@{fg shine} Welcome@{fg text}

           Hello again, another month over already, hmm these months are going quick. We've
 got loads to keep you busy this month, firstly as always we've got loads of games & utils
 reviews from the latest Amiga selection also the AIO chart is hotting up now. As a new regular
 section we've got the articles which inclued a great report on the Australian Amiga Gathering 
 '97 stright from the mouth of our own Austailian reporter. There is also me moaning about re-
 releases, the final part in our WzonkaLad tutorial and a review of the Dynalink 33,600bps modem.
 If you thought that there couldn't be any more stuff packed into this issue then you wrong
 because we have an exclusive inteview with Vince Pike from Epic Marketing in the articles section.
 This is also our biggest issue yet boasting over a 25k bigger size than normal issues and this
 is something we plan to continue. You must all be shy because we don't have any letters, come
 on get them sent in, any articles that you have wrote are wanted so get them sent in aswell.
 Well I hope you enjoy this months selection, see you next time.

           Street Racer is finally going to hit the Amiga. Street Racer is a Mario Kart
 style driving game which has been a big hit on other platforms. Although the Amiga version
 was finished some time ago it was shelved for unknown reason (-Ed take a guess) it will be
 released by Guildhall Leisure and it looks to be very good. You can contact Guildhall by
 phoning 01302 890000.

 Super Skid Marks Plus, Civilization and some others at £14.99, with Blitz Basic and Dpaint
 5 at £19.99, also on the way is the previously unreleased Street Racer and Gloom 3. Look

 been released so we'll be having the new versions up for a head to head battle to see who
 comes out on top, will it be AmiGameBoy again or has Wzonkalad pulled off the stunts and 
 overtaken AmiGameBoy???
  You may have noticed that this issue is over 25k bigger than normal issues well i'm
 pleased to tell you were going to try and keep it that way with each issue hopefully
 getting bigger and better. The games reviews are a little small this month but from next

           Boche as you may of guessed is a planes flying game, the plot of the game is
 you fly along in a british war plane and you have to shoot various german planes, people
 and buildings. This is a pretty avarage game made with the now obsolete Shoot 'em up
 construction kit (arggg I thought SEUCK games went out years ago) this game is mainly let
 down by that fact that the author was limited in what he could do with the SEUCK. The
 graphics do the job but aren't by any means fantastic and the sound is pretty poor as well.
 The game will keep you amused for a while but as you get to further levels it becomes hard
 and anoying.

@{fg shine} Rez&Sparky@{fg text}

           Rez&Sparky is a comic book with speech. It comes with around 11 pictures and
 has a speech sample to go with each picture. The pictures are nicely drawn for a free
 program and the sampled voices go well with the pictures. This program is aimed at kids
 mostly but the novel idea of having speech will impress nearly everyone, although the
 comic is quite short with only 11 or so pictures the samples are quite long which makes
 the download worth while. Rez&Sparky is a novel idea and will impress kids but download
 it anyway as the voices make it execlent.

@{fg shine} Archery@{fg text}

           Arhcery is presented nicely and the menus are layed out well but the rest of
 the game is terible. The idea is to shoot a moving target which moves past at a random
 speed and you have to shoot at it, where ever you hit on the target will be displayed
 in the corner of the screen. The graphics are not well drawn and there isn't much point
 to the game. A good option is to show where you have hit on the target but thats about
 it. The title menus are very nice but that gives a false impression of what the game is
 going to be like. Avoid this.

           As you can guess by the name this game is Asteroids in a WB window, this game
 is supprisingly good, the best feature is you can resize the screen to whatever size
 you want and it will be saved. There is also a highscore board which is saved so you can
 challenge other people and prove to them that you acheved that score. The graphics are
 simple but do that job as the author was looking for an orginal look. The speed is ok
 and the playability is amazing, there isn't anything that really lets this game down.

           If you've ever played Skidmarks you know exacly what this is going to be like, it's
 nearly the same. For a PD game and one that is Freeware it is execlent it is nearly upto the
 quality of Skidmarks. The author has given it away as Freeware as he doesn't have much time
 to spend on it but it is worth a registration fee. The main menu is presented well with lots
 of options for you to play around with like what car you want, what colour car you want,
 joystick options, what track you want and much more. At the moment there are only 4 cars the
 Monster Buggy, the Monster Truck, The Formula One and the Camero, each car has it's own
 advantages and disadvantages for example the Formula One is the best and fastest on the
 road track but on sand it is the slowest. The game comes with three different track sizes,
 5x5, 6x6 and 7x7. There are about 10 or so ready made tracks for you to use but the great
 option is the map editor to create your own tracks, it's easy to use and has alot of
 features like raise the road, put a ramp in it, bends, twists and turns. This game has
 got to be one of the best Freeware games available, download it.

@node "gr6" "Wackban"

@{fg shine} Wackban@{fg text}

           Another Pacman clone hits the...thing...but is it any good? Personally I can't stand
 Pacman clones, but just for you, I'll review this one. Wackban has the advantage of a small
 Multi-tasking window that sits nicely in your Workbench, but it is far from OS friendly. Start
 the game, set `Easy' from the menu (used via the right mouse button) and a window pops up showing
 a tiny game window with the usual four-or-so ghosty type things wandering 'round waiting for you
 to play. Press space and you use the arrow keys to control your... whatever it is... Pacman/Wackban.
 After a while I got bored so held down the right mouse button to change to HARD when. Disaster!
 Major Crash alert! Oh dear. Have to reset to try out the other features. Not a good sign. The
 controls are hardly responsive either, and you have to wait for the 'man to get to the next block
 (a fault by the programmers) before he can turn round. This really detracts from the gameplay and
 somewhat spoilt it for me. This is really meant for what Minesweeper is meant for Windoze 95 on
 PeeCees - A break during a long computing session. Hang on a moment! We're Amiga users! We don't
 get bored and even if we do we just load our favourite game with Workbench running! We don't have
 to Exit to DOS or any of that stupid stuff stupid people with PeeCees have to do! Pant pant etc...
	So anyway, Wackban is a good try but only to spice up your Workbench using sessions. The
 graphics are pretty bad, but I think it configures to your set up. You can choose the music on,
 but it just gets irritating after a while as it is so short and loops.

@{fg shine} WarV1.1@{fg text}

           Now here's a game that looks slightly inspired by the new game Zone 99, the problem
 being that this was made before anyone had heard of Zone 99, so is it the other way round?
  War! V1.1 is a top-down 2-4 player shoot `em up game using Tanks.The game takes place on a rocky
 battle field, with each player relegated to a small quarter of the screen to look around in as you
 travel. There are a variety of different weapons you can use to kill the others and you  can change
 the amount of lives you have too. It plays very nicely in 4 player mode, with a good accelerator
 but not as well in 2 player as you still only have a quarter of the screen - the same  goes for 3
 player mode!
  These problems and the fact that you can't use a 4-player adaptor are quite annoying, as the
 keyboard controls for players 3 and 4 are quite bad, but there are some really good points too. The
 graphics, especially the title page, are rather nice to look at, and the sound of your gun shooting
 is very satisfying, and remarkably Red Alert like at some points (which is nice)!
  If you don't yet have a Hard Drive then I would not recommend this as loading times are quite long.
  A basic `020 slows occasionally, but not too much unless you're all firing at the same time in
 4-player mode (but this does happen all the same!).
  I do like this game, but it just isn't as fun or playable as games like Extreme Violence, which
 is one of my favourite PD games of all time (sad I know).

@node "ur1" "MakeCD"

@{fg shine} MakeCD V2.4@{fg text}

           Having recently acquired a Cd Writer ( Yamaha CDR200t ) I took a quick look at the
 software needed. Although it may seem currently out of most peoples financial reach, the prices
 of CD Writers are dropping all the time, and for quite a few, they represent the best value for
 money backups available.
  MakeCD has been available for quite a while now, and this latest version was recently released,
 with many upgrades and bug fixes. Most of the available CD Writers are supported, including all
 the industry standards, so there shouldn't be a problem there, but as a limited edition is freely
 available on the Aminet system, you can try before you buy. As a newcomer to CD burning, I was
 pleased to find that MakeCD's documentation contains a section for beginners, with easy to follow
 guides to making data and audio Cd's. As CDR's are a write once device, a mistake can be costly,
 so this is a very welcome feature! Unfortunately, CD burning is a VERY hardware intense activity,
 and I'd imagine that a fairly powerful Amiga would be needed for even single speed burning of CD's.
 As most writers available today are at double speed, this means that for most people, a fair
 investment in ram etc. would be required to even think about recording your own CD's. MakeCD CAN
 record CD's 'on the fly' without using too much extra hard drive space, BUT this requires an even
 more powerful computer, otherwise a ruined CDR is the result. If you have a CD Rom drive capable
 of sending data over the SCSI or IDE bus, then CD to CD copies are possible, but most older or
 cheaper drives aren't capable of this. Also, the standard Amiga IDE port ( A1200's and A4000's )
 isn't very fast and will also probably cause problems. But if you have the hardware required,
 MakeCD performs admirably. I've burned about 10 CD's, and apart from a mistake on my part, I've
 had no problems. I've found that the easiest way to compile a CD is using a whole 650 meg partition
 on my hard drive, and then setting that up as I would the CD, and then using makeCD to burn a copy
 from that partition. This results in an exact copy of the partition, including snapshotted icons
 etc. and produces very pleasing results. The GUI used by MakeCD is provided by the Triton library,
 which produces clean resizeable windows, and font sensitive support. Also available is a 'bubble
 help' system, which if you leave the mouse pointer over a button etc., comes up with a window with
 some help text contained in it. Whilst not replacing tyhe documentation, this helps clear up any
 small quibbles whilst running the software, and helps to make up for the lack of any printed manuals.
  On the whole then, MakeCD is a functional and useful program, let down by hardware requirements.
 Now being distributed by Power Computing also means it is more readily available, and if you have
 the hardware and need to burn CD's it's the most sensible option currently available.

@{fg shine} APlayer V2.22@{fg text}

           Well here's another modplayer, they seem to be coming thick and fast this month,
 don't they? This is another play all, do all kind of modplayer. It uses a system of libraries
 to play the mods, rather like Eagleplayer and Delitracker do, which is a flexible method of
 reducing memory usage. This also means that only the kind of mods that you play need to have
 libraries loaded, and any new formats can be catered for easily. Most of the common formats
 are catered for by APlayer, with a few noticeable exceptions, like the TFMX 7 channel format,
 which means that quite a few top notch modules can't be played. At the same time though, APlayer
 is the only Amiga tracker player that currently supports Impulse Tracker mods from the PC, which
 is my favourite PC tracker, so it seems like it's horses for courses on that front. Facility
 wise, APlayer has an impressive list up it's sleeve, marred by a few oversights. For example,
 if you download an archived mod from a BBS, and then load it into APlayer, ALL the archive
 contents are displayed, thus leaving the user to select the actual mod to be played. Compared to
 Hippoplayer, which is also reviewed this issue, which automatically plays the mod, this is a
 serious fault. Also, on my system, APlayer occasionally crashed for no reason, although an A4000
 with Warp Engine and 38 megs of ram can't be considered a 'normal' system, and I was multitasking
 several programs at the time! APlayer GUI is also not as clean and tidy as other mod players,
 needing several clicks on buttons to get to the required page, before the options can be altered.
  To sum up then, APlayer is a competant mod player, which is let down in a few areas. Unfortunatly
 it isn't as good as Hippoplayer in several areas, and unless you need to play some of the formats
 it supports, then in my opinion, Hippoplayer has it licked. Try it for yourself, and compare them
 side by side.

@{fg shine} Hippoplayer V2.40@{fg text}

           I'm sure that most of you have lots of music modules hanging about on your hard
 drives. Well the latest version of Hippoplayer is here, and it's probably the best all round
 mod player available! Support for ALL the major formats is included, and the replay routines
 for the most common of these is built into the program, saving memory and storage space.
 Other lesser known formats use a player-group file, which can be loaded as and when needed,
 thus conserving memory if required. Support for the AHI device is also included so that people
 with soundcards are able to utilise their full potential and/or save modules to disk as AIFF
 files to master to CD's. ( see review of MakeCD V2.4 in this issue ) There is also a neat
 little GUI to compliment Hippoplayer, and this makes the task of loading and playing mods quick
 'n' easy, with support for custom screens, custom fonts and general preferences. All in all
 this makes Hippoplayer a breeze to use and Hippoplayer also possesses an AREXX port, so people
 can write their own scripts to make a fully customised playing system. Whilst playing mods,
 very little CPU time is required, unless multichannel mods like Octamed SoundStudio and/or PC
 style mods are used, which means multitasking is unnaffected. Thus Hippoplayer can play away
 whilst you continue to work on your latest projects! It can even be used to compile a list of
 favourite mods and play them at random, jukebox style for added listening pleasure!
  Overall, I have no hesitation in recommending Hippoplayer. In it's latest version it is ALMOST
 the complete mod player, just a few tweeks here and there would make it untouchable. As it is
 however, it is the best all round solution to your mod playing needs.As far as I know, there
 aren't any bugs either, so full marks go out to the author K-P Koljonen.

@{fg shine} MultiCX 2.74@{fg text}

           Multi CX ( or MCX for short ) is an all singing and dancing commodity designed to
 provide some enhancements to AmigaDOS V2.04 and up. Now available in version 2.74, it's been
 around for a long time, with numerous updates and bugfixes, and has been ever present on my
 system since version 2.41. When placed in your WBStartup drawer, in called from startup-sequence,
 it provides many useful features in a small 23k package. These include a versatile screen
 blanker, mouse acceleration, clock and memory minder, improved workbench about command, automatic
 mount wedge, and much more. For example, say that you clicked on a program, and a certain volume
 or device wasn't mounted. Well normally the program in question would exit sharpish, but with
 MCX, a requester comes up allowing you to mount the device etc. This feature alone makes MCX a
 worthy addition to any system, and coupled with loads of other features help make using you
 Amiga even more productive. What's more, MCX seems very stable, bug free, and is highly
 configurable. However, to fit into a small program, MCX uses tootypes in the icon, and can be
 hard to configure from scratch. Once setup though, it works like a dream, and can be left in
 the background and forgotten. This proves that small CAN be beautiful, and really is indispensable
 once installed. Totally recommended to ALL serious Amiga users.

 around at the bottem right hand side of the screen in a nice black and white window
 (although you can't move it) with a nice friendly quit button. This shows the time and
 the date, and that's about it. As these go, it does the job, but offers nothing new.
 Obviously, you'll need a battery backed up clock to run it, but no doubt you've got

@{fg shine} Re-Releases, do we need 'em?@{fg text}

           Over the past few months i've noticed a lot of adverts saying that such and
 such a program is going to be re-released and everyone goes mad over it especially the
 Amiga computer mags. Whenever something is re-released Amiga magazines feel the duty
 to re-review them thus filling up pages that could be better used for something more
 interesting. Mentioning no names a company is about to release some old Electronic
 Arts and Bullfrog games, do we really need them? ok some games you can't get any more
 but things like Theme Park and Fifa are easily available from almost everywhere. To
 get to re-release this software these companys have to ring up places like Bullfrog
 and EA to get permission and maybe give them a percentage of the profits they make from
 selling the re-releases but what impression does it give to companys that used to make
 good games for the Amiga, most of them are probably thinking the Amiga is dead now and
 they don't have enough software they've got to re-release our old software. Insted of
 these companys thinking they are helping by re-releasing why don't they sign up some
 programmers and get new games/utils out.

@{fg shine} Wzonkalad Tutorial - Part 2@{fg text}

 Part 1 : The basics (Issue 3)
 Part 2 : Getting the hang of things (Issue 4 - This issue)

 @{b}Part 2 :@{ub}

 After last months 'The basics' tutorial you should of got the basic hang of things.
 This month we are going to concentrate on the preferences and what you can change
 with them. Explained below are what each option does.

 FRMSKIP : Frameskip allows some of the frames to be skipped while in play, this option
           is useful if you have a slow machine so the slower your machine the more frames
           you should set to skip. DO NOT pick 'all' as you won't get any picture.

 RENDER  : Render is used to select which screen you would like the games to be displayed
           on. First is 'Win+Screen' this will display your games in the main Wzonkalad
           WB window. Second is 'Screen' this will display the game in a window with no
           border on its own screen. And last is 'AGA H/W' this will display the game
           on its own screen at proper size, this is my favourite screen and is also
           the fastest.

 REFRESH :

 XPK LIB : This is to select what compactor you want to compact the catridges with.

 CONTROL : This is to seclect what method of control you want to use, either Keyboard,
           CD³² Joypad or Joystick. Keyboard stays half working with Joystick.

 BDROP   : This turns on/off the backdrop on the Wzonkalad screen.

 DEBUG   :

 At the bottom of the prefs window there will be three buttons 'useable' the first is
 to save your prefs, the second is to select what screenmode you want Wzonkalad in and
 the third is the palette prefs. You can load in cetain palettes for certain games.

 Thats it for our WzonkaLad V0.80 tutorial, we'll try and sort something out for next
 issue and don't be afraid to ask if you would like a tutorial on a certain program.

@{fg shine} 33,600bps Dynalink modem reviewed@{fg text}

           I have been a long user of a 14400 X-link modem and I thought it was about
 time I upgraded mainly to cut phone bills down. I selected the Dynalink modem from
 Active Software as they specialize in modems and Amiga internet software. When I
 received my modem I was very pleased with it, even though it was two days late.
 The modem is very small and compact which is good, the casing is made of plastic, less
 safe than my 14400 made of metal but plastic does the job. The design is very nice and
 the LED's are well explained and clear. The downloading depends on what serial port you
 have, I'd recommend getting a faster serial port because if you have the standard A1200
 one sometimes you will download at 38000 but most of the time you download at about 28000
 and on really bad times (only occasionally) you will download at about 20000. The modem
 is really for a PC because it comes with PC software and some PC manuals but who needs
 them it's just a modem. If you have a 14400 or lower I would defiantly recommend this
 as it cuts downloading in half but if you own a 28800 you'd better get a 56 baud modem.
 This modem is great the only problem I had with it is the serial connector is too short
 so make sure it's going to be close.

@node "aus" "Australian Amiga Gathering 97"

@{fg shine} Australian Amiga Gathering 97@{fg text}

           It has to be said that the Amiga's presence in Australia is small 
 indeed when compared to the number of PC's that are now on everyone's desktops.
 This show however, is proof that whatever the case, the Amiga itself is still far
 from dead Down Under.  On the weekend of the 28th (Saturday) and 29th (Sunday)
 of June, the Australian Amiga Gathering 97 (AAG 97) was held in Sydney, at the
 Sydney showgrounds (Kensington Exhibition Centre) Moore Park.  The show itself
 was a product of the efforts of the team producing Australia's only remaining
 Amiga publication, the Australian Amiga Gazette.  I must confess that although
 I had intended to attend both days, the second days weather was so poor with
 heavy rain that a long slog on public transport did not appeal to me.

  The show was to begin at 10am and I arrived around that time, following
 another bunch of people who looked as if they were headed in the same direction.
 True to form, they led me right to the entrance!  There were no actual signs to
 lead people to the Exhibition centre, although there was a big "Amiga" banner
 at the entrance. I paid for my tickets (for the 2 days) and went in.  Some
 people were still setting up their stands, and at that stage people were only
 beginning to trickle in.  As the day progressed however, many more people came
 to have a look and I was suitably impressed.  At last count, almost 1000 people
 ended up coming to the show over the 2 days I was told.

  I didn't expect too much from the show, and it certainly wasn't big by any means,
 a smattering of stands and a tent at the end where demonstrations and speeches were
 delivered.  There was even a quiz show game played there during the day, with
 questions all Amiga related!  The surprise to me was the presence of Power
 Computing all the way from England, and the only overseas retailer present.  Due
 to customs problems, they only brought in small goods such as A1200 accelerators,
 copies of the game "Big Red Adventure" and some graphics boards such as the PicassoIV.
 Tony Ianiri, Power Computing's director was friendly and very easy to chat with,
 and he had a fairly positive attitude about being an Amiga retailer.  He did
 mention to me that Phase5 were having a few problems, and that apparently they
 had lost some engineers, although this would have to be counted as rumour.  Worrying
 though.

        The list of companies present were:

        - Amadeus Computers
        - GSoft
        - Software Buyers Service
        - Power Computing UK
        - GP Software
        - Computa Magic
        - Tech Media
        - Resource Management Force
        - Amiga Genius
        - Unitech Electronics
        - Unicorn Solutions
        - Australian Amiga Gazette

  Most of these were retailers showing off their goods, but having not expected
 as large a turnout, were perhaps understocked, especially those who came from
 outside Sydney!  There were a few nice touches however.  The Australian Amiga
 Gazette ran a shareware booth where you could get your favourite shareware and
 be registered all in the one spot.  There wasn't a big range, but the idea was
 a good one.  Unfortunately I was informed that some shareware authors were
 reluctant to give away keyfile programs for AAG's use.  This meant that some of
 the biggest shareware such as SASG's Magic User Interface and Magic Workbench
 were not among the choices.  Regardless, the stand was still very popular.  You
 could subscribe here too!

  Tech Media's stand continuously drew a crowd due to their running demonstrations
 of Macrosystem's Casablanca digital video editing suite and the Draco. The Draco
 in particular impressed me when they took a tape from someone in the crowd and
 immediately edited both sound and picture and played it back.  Wow.  St. John's
 Park High School were there demonstrating a few animations and pictures done by
 students on video playing a slideshow, and a few A1200's being used by some students
 with Dpaint just to draw.  They seemed very familiar with it.  Unitech Electronics
 sponsor the school.

  Jonathan Potter and Greg Perry were there plugging Dopus and the now customary
 Dopus t-shirts.  They were very enthusiastic in their presentation and demonstrations
 of Dopus at the stand, and during the day there was also a demonstration in the tent
 of Dopus Magellan's capabilities by Greg Perry.  Plenty of people stopped by this
 stand to have a chat.

  There were some user groups as well, but I didn't find the opportunity to chat to
 anyone there.

  I had expected to see Phase5 there, but they never showed.  There was no Gateway2000
 presence at the show either, but Amiga International had a representative present,
 one Mr. Basil Flinter.  He's also the driving force behind TAEN (The Amiga Education
 Network), an effort to promote the use of Amigas in schools.  From speaking to Basil
 I learnt that Petro Tyschtschenko (president of Amiga International if you didn't
 know) was unable to come to Australia due to other commitments, but had a speech faxed
 to Basil to be read to those at the show.  The speech had a strong emphas is on working
 together with partners (and the search for potential partners), and there was mention
 of interest at working with companies like Phase5.  Apart from that, the strategy set
 out at the UK World of Amiga show has not changed, but was reiterated here.

  Overall the show must be considered a success.  The number of people who attended,
 the enthusiasm displayed and the fact that support is still present in Australia for
 the Amiga means that we as Amiga users are still far from extinction Down Under.

wELCOME
~~~~~~~
      After about 8 months away from Nicron Productions we are pleased
to be back :) We've scrapped all the old projects and are starting again
with new stuff. At the moment only two small projects have been completed
but we hope to make that tally rise quickly, with your help (hopefully!!)

wHAT wE nEED
~~~~~~~~~~~~
      We are looking for people who can do anything, we want good utils,
games, mods, pics, asciis and anything else good. If any good ansii artists
want to join we will definalty welcome them, we are thinking of doing a
monthly ansii collection if anyone is interested. We are NOT a cracking
group or any pirate related group we are here to save the AMiGA with
freely distributable software. Real names or handles are excepted. We are
not really classed as a group more as software producers.
