Well, January's here, by some people's measure the
{italic}true{noitalic} begining of the Millenium, and I
{bold}still{nobold} refuse to do any Valentine's Day sites.  :){p}
That asside, I have a nice fun assortment to keep you warm during these
cold Winter nights (or cool of during those hot Summer nights, for
those of you south of the Equator).

The Smoking Gun{p}
http://www.thesmokinggun.com/{p}
One of those "the truth is out there" type sites, this one brings you
confidrntial and quirky news supplied little elsewhere, complete with
scans of the actual documents to prove it, all obtained under the old
Freedom Of Information Act.  Sometimes informative, sometimes fun,
sometimes wierd.

Dead People Server{p}
http://dpsinfo.com/index.shtml{p}
Want to know which famous person died when, or {bold}if{nobold} they died?
This site will tell you, organized by date, and complete with bios.  In
the case of some of the more famous stars there's links to their entries
in the Internet Movie Database as well.  Nice morbid way to start off
the day.

Ugly People Dot Com{p}
http://www.uglypeople.com/{p}
Like the banner says, a site intended for immature audiences only, here
we get to see lots of people that have actually submitted their
picture for viewing on a site that {bold}tells{nobold} you it's for ugly
people only.  Men, women, and even a few celebs they scooped up from
somewhere, it's a bit of fun to see the variety of looks out there...{p}
And it's not like they can hear how you make fun of them in front of the
monitor.
{p} {p}
Henson.Com{p}
http://www.henson.com/{p}
A colorful link site to guide you to anything of the Henson universe,
you can link yourself to anyone of anyone of a dozen sites each of which
is devoted to another Muppet prouction.  There's also news and a
calender of their productions and events. Pretty well laid out and
colorful fun to see.

Dr. Seus Web Page{p}
http://www.seuss.org/{p}
A Seussian compendium of anything you ever wanted to see of the Cat In 
The hat vreator and then some.  Here The Center For Seussian Studies 
will guide you through unofficial lists of his books, films, and even 
parodies.  An information explosion that ould even make the Grinch offer 
up one of deliciously his evil grins.
{p} {p}
First up the expected list of all of Seuss' works and where to buy them, 
complete with the date first published; quite a lot actually.  ALong 
this loine is also a list of all the Seussian films and which are
available on video.  Then finally there's the incomplete biography of Dr. Seuss
himself, for those interested in the truth behind the cartoon.
{p} {p}
Then we have the parody page, filled with links to a long list of Dr. Seuss
parody pages.  Seuss like the man never intended, with such lumninary
titles as How the Gingrinch Stole Congress, Spam-I-Am, and The Rat In The Vat.
Possibly more amusing then the originals.
{p} {p}
But amongst all this here, possibly the most treasured find is the words
to You're A Mean One, Mister Grinch.  Read it, sing it, strike that low
tone for the propper effect.  You'll find yourself humming it as you
finish off with the rest of the site.
