Does anybody else think instruction manuals are things on which to
place your coffee cups? You can't be bothered reading detailed,
long-winded instructions? You like games you can just load and play?
Then look no further. Help is at hand with Fnurr 2000. This game is
so simple it would be an insult if instructions were included.
{p} {p}
Load up Fnurr and you find out this game was created in 1995-1996 and
only updated with new URLs and e-mails. Hmmm bit old. Still,
downloaded it now so I'll have to play it. Hold on! It also states it
only has 26 moving pixels. What sort of game is this going to be???
{p} {p}
After pushing any key you have the usual intro screen and tune. Not
bad but, then again, not good either. This is also the story and
instructions screen. A grand total of 25 words. The only one of any
importance being "Move"! What's going on?
{p} {p}
If you still decide to press the fire button then you find yourself
straight into the game and you're a tiny light green pixel in the
middle of 25 other red pixels and all you have to do is avoid them
for as long as you can. You die by either hitting them or getting
caught in an explosion when the red pixels collide.
{p} {p}
Your score increases by the length of time you are alive and the
points gained by the deaths of the red pixels.

As you might have guessed your pixel moves faster than the enemy but
there is one thing to note. The longer an enemy pixel is on the
screen the faster it gets so you have to roam around the whole screen
to destroy a good selection of red pixels before they are as fast (if
not faster) as you.

The background tune is really good and sets off the frantic nature of
this game. It's so easy to play as it is but if you press F1 in game
then things really do get a bit hairy!
{p} {p}
A great game and my score of 8405 is unassailable.
