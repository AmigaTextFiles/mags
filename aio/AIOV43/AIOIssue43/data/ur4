This is a ID3-Tag editor, which supports most versions of the
ID3tagging standard for MPEG audio. It reads these version of the ID3
tags available "1.0, 1.1, 2.2, 2.3" and can write versions "1.0, 1.1,
2.3". The installation is painless and quick (all you do is copy the
program where you want it and a library to Libs: Startingn the
program reveals a blobby OS 3.5 GUI that doesn't at all appeal to me,
but it's pretty standard otherwise and really nothing spectacular or
anything worse than that. The quickhelp however is a good thing which
helps out when using it.

Still, the standard GUI may be ugly, but at least it's fast, which is
the most important thing. There's nothing complicated about this one,
so if you are nuts about tagging and sorting your MP3's this might
very well be worth taking a look at.

In general, this one does what it's supposed to do, but not much more
I'm afraid, plus the lack of a complete genre listing lowers the
score furthermore. And the fact that it's entirely in German adds to
that somewhat as well. Fortunately my knowledge of the German
language is more or less adequate, but I suspect this will make alot
of other people not want to use this program because of that alone.
