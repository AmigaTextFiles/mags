Hello,
{p} {p}
I was wondering if AIO or readers know much about the different models of
A1200s.  As I have 2 and they both seem to have different downfalls.
One has a wierd AGA chipset, which won't allow me to view dblPAL or modes
like that, that are used for SVGA monitors etc..  And the other has a
serial port that cannot connect above 56Kbps or it will just get constant
errors.  I haven't got the first one with me at the moment, but the other
model is 1.4.D.
{p} {p}
Just wondering if there was actually a model of the A1200 made, that works
100% :)
{p} {p}
Also, clock ports seem to differ from model to model.
{p} {p}
Cyas later, thanks in advance for any help.

offcourse hapiness. Have a great party you all :-)

Hello Paul

In  response  to  your  reply to "A1200 Ressurrection" in the December 2000
issue of AIO.

You said that with a 030, DOOM would be sluggish.  Sorry but it isn`t.  :)
{p} {p}
I  have  a Magnum Mk 3 (Apollo) 030@40 Mhz FPU and 16 meg of fast mem and I
get  a considerably playable speed with DOOMAttack tested with all the main
WADs,  full  screen with visible info bar, low detial, in CGXNTSC:  Low Res
with  such  programs  running as SetMan, CMQ030, StackAttack, QBC, BlazeWCP
and  FBlit running with CPUControl enabled caches, FastROM and MOVEVBR, and
replacement  faster  math  libs  (not sure if DOOMAttack uses the math libs
though) installed.

Hello JoNty,
{p} {p}
Well, it looks as if I could have been a bit hasty saying the 030 was
a bit sluggish in running doom. The key words here are "a bit". I used
to spend hours trying to finish Doom on my A1200, which had a CSA 12
guage 50Mhz 030 & '882, + 16MB of 70ns FP RAM. With full screen, full
detail, the frame rate hovered close to 10 FPS with the Doom 2 wads
and ADoom. Most of the time, in big levels, I had to run it in low
detail to make it enjoyable. I have heard reports that DoomAttack is
faster than ADoom, but judging by the poor performance of my
A4000ec030 @ 25Mhz with ADoom, and the fact I have a much more capable
PC to run Doom, I decided that on average, Doom is "a bit" sluggish on
030 systems. Of course, everyone's mileage will vary (especially with
the patches you've mentioned), and different people tolerate
different frame rates.
{p} {p}
I might just add that my A4000 is still my main computer (I've done
two commercial web sites with it now), and whilst it is "a bit"
painful doing the graphics work with an ec030, the CV64-3D makes it
all possible, and my PC is used purely for games, previewing my
work with IE 4, Netscape 4.72, and Opera 3.60, and a bit of work with
Delphi. So until I decide whether to buy a fast 040 or take the plunge
and get a PPC board, my Amiga will still be "a bit" sluggish :).

I have been using AMIGA for many years now and have been running the
brilliant MUSIC X sequencer.
{p} {p}
I am now trying to set up a PC based system but cannot find any sequencer
that I like as much as MUSIC X
{p} {p}
Is there anybody who has converted MUCIC X for PC use?  If so, do you know
where I can get it?
{p} {p}
Hoping you can help

Hello Gary,
{p} {p}
Unfortunately, after doing a little searching, it seems that Music X
stopped development long ago (Perhaps '94?). In the review for Music X
2.0 on aminet, (see {link http://aminet.net/aminet/dirs/aminet/docs/rview/MusicX2.0.txt}http://aminet.net/aminet/dirs/aminet/docs/rview/MusicX2.0.txt{end}, there
is a snippet of an email correspondance with the original author, who
says he traded Music X 2.0 to Hollyware in return for the rights to
some of his other products, when MicroIllusions was bought. If there
has been any more development (I haven't seen any signs of that at
all), it wasn't by the original author.
{p} {p}
On the bright side, there are dozens of popular sequencers on PC.
Obviously, it will take some getting used to, after using Music X
for all these years, but I hear good words about Cakewalk
(www.cakewalk.com), Audition ({link http://www.bowrad.ndirect.co.uk}link http://www.bowrad.ndirect.co.uk{end}), and
Massiva ({link http://home.c2i.net/jaase/massiva.htm}home.c2i.net/jaase/massiva.htm{end}).  I know Bars & Pipes is
fairly well known on PC, but I think it's not generally regarded as a
professional midi sequencer. I'm not very familiar with midi
sequencing though, so I guess your best bet would be to look
around and talk to someone who knows their stuff and see what they
think.
