This program simply rules!
{p} {p}
I have tried quite a few CD-burning programs in my days, but this is
definately the best of them all. Installing it is a simple task, just
specify where you want it and sit back, click here and there a few
times to make sure everything gets copied properly.

When you run MakeCD for the first time you will get up a register
promt (it's Shareware). This review is based on the unregistered
MakeCD3.2d (unfortunately...), so there are a few limitations. For
example, burning can only be made in Test-mode with DAO (Disc at
once; writes the whole disc without interuptions), and you can only
write 10 tracks per CD-r with TAO (Track at once, writes every track
separately), etc. Althugh MakeCD is severly crippled when it's
unregistered, it's still usable to some degree, since it can burn
with some quirks involved, plus the CDDA options are available
(playing, ripping CD audio).

MakeCD has two "general settings", Beginner- and Expert modes. When
using the Beginner (in combination with the additional pop-up
setting) mode you'll get pop-up windows pretty much everywhere you
place the pointer, and it's pretty hard to fail doing the things you
want to achieve when in the Beginner mode. First off you have to
configure the reading/writing drive(s) you are using. After that it's
time to start burning. Burning is quite easy actually, but it might
be a good thing to be prepared to lose a few CD's here and there,
before you get the hang of it. The best thing to do now is to set a
directory where from which you want to burn files. You do this by
selecting the "advanced settings" in the menu, or press the "Advanced
options" button in the main window and then just browse to the
directory you want to use. Here you can also set which type of
burning you want to use, in the demo you can only use the TAO option
however. So this is the one we'll use now. After that it's time to
press the "Add" button, now we get a window with some more settings.
I used the "Filesystem" option, since I want to burn some stuff off
of the hard disk.

Now we can choose a variety of more options, but
the best thing if you ask me is to create an ISO file of the files
you want to burn and then burn the ISO onto the CD-r, this is the get
the best possible speed and avoid interuptions in the burning process
- however, you can burn directly onto the CD-r, I have never managed
to fail doing so, but it's best to keep it safe. Press the button
that looks like an arrow below the "type" headline, choose the
directory you want to burn from, then click OK. You can now press the
"Write tracks" button, or if you want to save the ISO and burn later,
use the "create image file" button. Now, you can also set where you
want the ISO file to be placed, but I usually let it reside in the
root directory of MakeCD. Now, all you got to do is to make sure you
have a CD-r in the burner and wait for the burning process to be
completeted, and before you know it you have a fresh new CD-r to add
your collection. It's as easy as that!

MakeCD has tons of other features and settings, but I think the
manual can explain them better than I could. This should be enough
(hopefully) to get your attention to this program and want to check
it out for yourself. This is really a great program, and if you use a
CD burner, this should be the program you use to get out the most of
it.
