{subhead}The Quantum Leap: StormC 4{def}
{left}
{p} {p}
"The new version of the well-known development system will be a quantum
leap:  Network capabilities, distributed Make, CVS, modified GCC compiler
with Amiga hunk format, global full text search, extended editor, debugging
of tasks and shared libraries and the new StormDOC.
{p} {p}
The most important feature of the new developers system is the step
forwards towards the new AmigaOS.  At the moment everything still runs on
the Classic Amiga, and that is how it will be presented, but everything was
developed anew with easy portability in mind."
