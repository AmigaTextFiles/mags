Our long time News Editor Neil Williams at last has to resign.  It seems
he's gotten too much of a life lately and can no longer find the time to
submit his usual high quality work.  Well, we'll miss you Neil and good
luck on everything.
{p} {p}
That leaves us with a hole, however; namely, one News editor.  So, once
again to I sound out the call from the highland cliffsides for a worthy
one to come forward and claim the mantle, once more do I sift through
the Many for the One.

Translation:  If you would like to be our new News Editor then just
submit an email to {bold}general@aio.co.uk{nobold} and tell me of any qualifications
(sits on the computer and surfs all day, that sort of thing)
or at least enthusiasm you may have.  Duties are basically to keep an
eye on all the usual Amiga news sources and pick out those of particular
interest for inclusion in an issue.  All you have to be able to do is
keep your ear to the ground and submit things on a monthly basis.

So, if there's any takers out there then just drop us a line ands we'll
see who gets it.  And as I said before, good luck Neil.
