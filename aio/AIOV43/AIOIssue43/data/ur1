As most of you should know by now, YAM, the premier (well, almost at
least) e-mail client to the Amiga has been laid on ice by its author,
Marcel Beck and been open-sourced there has popped up a few other
clients here and there, one of those is Simplemail, currently in an
early beta stage, but I still felt it would prove interesting to
check this new program out and voice my thoughts about it with the
readers of AIO; Simplemail is described as being very similar to YAM,
and I can't but agree on that point. However, the idea is that
Simplemail should get some more advanced, not available in YAM,
features. What those are however remains a mystery for the time
being. For now though, I simply see it as a more or less copy of YAM,
and that of course makes the interface and it's features work nice
and give it the, to me, exact the way a mail program should be.

After setting up the program I quickly scribbled down a few lines to
a friend, only to discover that that actually didn't work yet. Hmm,
it proved quite hard to review this program after all. I think that
in order to give a this one a fair review I have to wait a few
versions, but it does look quite promising, so it might be worth the
wait.
