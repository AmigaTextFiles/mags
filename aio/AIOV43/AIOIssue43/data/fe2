This month we'll focus on Hard Drives.  Why?  because I just spent the 
last few weeks/months going through every possible tjhing that can go 
wrong in installing a new Hard drive.  So, to save others out there some
aggravation and painful hair-pulling (and having thus used up all my
spare time to think up anythiung else for this column), I present a few 
tips on installing new Hard drives.
{p} {p}
First, don't bother copying any caches.  Most crashes I've had are from 
browser crashes and occasionally they leave a few loose ends in the 
cache that the disk repair programs might not catch and this can 
conceievably be transported over to the new drive.  besides, who wants 
to watch a few hundred 100 byte files move across your screen?
{p} {p}
Next, make sure your FastFileSystem is updated. I thought mine was until 
I happened to check the version.  Apparently the install/update cript
for 3.9 neglected to copy over the current version (45.9).
{p} {p}
Also, for drives that break the 4Gig barrier, you need to have 
{bold}both{nobold} the filesystem patch in etPatch running AND the most 
recent FastFileSystem installed onto the Hard Drives file systems.  The 
down side of the Setpatch filesystem update however is some trouble
with reading double density disks (though maybe now that I've updated
my 45.1 to 45.9 maybe that glitch is gone, I haven't checked yet).
{p} {p}
Before you do anything, transfer everything to ZIP diks (do we see a
connection with the other article in this issue?).  That's the only way
of backing a lot of stuff up and you {bold}do{nobold} want backups.
{p} {p}
Now, if the disk {italic}still{noitalic} won't format or keeps loosing
partitions, then just have only the new drive plugged in; disconnect the
old one completely. Then boot from floppy (make ssure your boot disk has
your ZIP dosdrivers on them if you need them), install, partition,
format, and the rest.  it just might be sufering from the same problem
as hooking up two high density floppies does in some A4000s.
{p} {p}
Finally a note or two.  I've been told that some OEM IBM drives were
made to work optimally for only certain specific Wintel controllers, so 
be careful there.
{p} {p}
Also, on the size of drives.  The size in gigs they state is actually
((stated gigabyte size) * (1 billion)).  Now, as we all know a gigabyte 
is {bold}not{nobold} eactly 1 billion but a bit more.  So, dividing that 
9 or 18 gigabyte drive by a REAL gigabyte will give a smaller size they
they state.  This is why HDToolBox will report a smaller size they the
manufacturer says it is.  Apparently the industry got min the habit of 
doing it this way back when drives were in the 10 meg range and figured 
it wouldn't make much difference.
{p} {p}
That'll teach them.

{bold}Late Breaking Tip!!!{nobold}

I finally found the clash between the new FastFileSystem patch and
double density disks. First let me assure you it's nothing most of you
out there are going to encounter, unless you have as many old
filesystem mount files hanging around as I do.
{p} {p}
As many of you out there do, I use MultiFileSystem, complete with an
array of mount files for all the usual alternate filesystems,
including Diskspare which I use extensively, and one other which I
don't use but kept in there from long ago in case someone else did. 
Floppy.device was one of those that could squeeze more out of a double
density disk then normal, this one even more then Diskspare.  But I'd
soon found out it was unstable so quite formating any disks in it but
kept the dosdriver for it lying around in the subdirectory for MFS to
find and load up every time.
{p} {p}
It turns out that floppy.device has a similar enough mount listing to
the standind amiga FFS for DD disks that when it's up the OS would
confuse standard DD disks as floppy.device, but sincre they weren't
then read errors would ensue.
{p} {p}
Easy enough fix; I just took out the offending floppy.device file and
now there's no more problems between dd and the latest FFS patch. 
I'ts not like I use floppy.device anyway.
{p} {p}
Which brings up a more general tip.  Search your startup-sequence,
user-startup, and WBStartup for any old entries of things you have
long since stopped using, be it some patch whose function you'e
forgotten or an old assign you no longer need.  Remove the clutter
that tends to accumulate and you'll lessen the chances of any software
clashes whose origins just leave you mystified.  It will no doubt
speed things up a bit and improve overall efficiency.

And save you from a lot of hair pulling.
