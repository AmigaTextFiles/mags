This is the last month for the survey, so if you want your views
heard then mail in those responses now.  next month they'll be
published, with a copy sent to Amiga itself (along with the growing list
of your attached remarks).

For those that have been under a rock or new to AIO, let me recap.  I thought it was
about time to see what the Amiga Community thought of the recent
efforts of the mother company.  So, with that in mind, you will find
an ascii file in the root direction of this issue (AIOIssue42/survey).
Just put your answers into an email (Give the question numbers next
your each of your answers), and send it off to:{p}
survey@aio.co.uk

We'll publish the results next month.
