The new OS3.9 upgrade now comes with ZIP support and mentions
compatibility with everything from 100MB ZIPS to 2Gig Jazz.  But, as a
very recent owner of a brand new 250MB ZIP, upon my perusal of the
entire CD found that only the mount file for the 100MB version is there.

After ranting for a minute, and asking around, I worked at coming up
with my own.  Well, my second attempt worked so I decided that maybe
some other AIO readers just might be interested in it.  So, for those
that ue their ZIPs as DOS devices instead of RDB formatted, here I
present my mount file.

Why use a DOSDriver instead of RDB? well, for one it seemns to be easier
on removable media, and for another it then works with MultiFileSystem.
Just create a "ZIP" directory under Devs:Dosdrivers/ and put all the
assorted ZIP mountfile incarnations in there and that's it.

Anyway, here's the ZIP250 mountfile.  Just clip and save.
