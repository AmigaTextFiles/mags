This is the first ever Amiga only show in the North of England. It is
to be held on the 24th February at the Old Cornmill in Huddersfield,
West Yorkshire. One minute off junction 25 off the M62.
{p} {p}
The show is presented by Huddersfield Amiga User Group (HAUG) and is
co sponsored by Eyetech in conjunction with Wirenet.
{p} {p}
The club were asked to have the show on this date so that Fleecy
Moss, Vice-President of Amiga Inc, could attend and give a
presentation of the future plans of Amiga.
{p} {p}
The venue is now fully booked with most of the Amiga retailers and
several Amiga User groups taking the stands. Formatt Homecomputing
will be launching a new magazine. Shogo will be running in the games
area if it is bug free in time. If not then it'll be Heretic 2. A
good compliment to Sensible Soccer. Napalm will also be networked.
There will be demonstrations of all new hardware and there might also
be a chance of the Amiga 1!
{p} {p}
Definite prizes so far are 2 Amiga magic packs, £100 in vouchers from
Eyetech, AA subscriptions and Shogo or Heretic 2. Lots more prizes
will follow. There is also going to be a small cybercafe. And the
only laptop Amiga made has also been promised as a show piece.
