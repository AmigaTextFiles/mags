Well, we're well into the new Millenium now, by {bold}anyone's{nobold}
measure, so no more harping on that.  Amiga looks hopeful, though that
new Amiga One can't come out fast enough as far as I'm concerned. 
There are enough rumblings in the world outside the Amiga Community to
show that some people are finally beginning to realize that something
is on the horizon and that it could be something big.  it's sort of
like waiting for the hero to rise up from the battlefield and start
kicking that villian back across it.

Well, onto other things.  This is the last month that the survey will
be conducted, results to be put on in next month's issue.  So, anyone
that hasn't yet filled it out please do so.  It's in the root
directory of this issue and should be emailed to survey@aio.co.uk.

Finally, if you see any problems with the way your issue is being
delivered, the web site, or anything else then simply email your
complaints to "abuse@aio.co.uk".

Until next month, Ami-fans...
