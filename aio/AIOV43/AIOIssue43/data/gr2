I don't know about you but my hard drive is mostly filled with games.
They range from games like Napalm down to the little workbench games
and I enjoy them all.

Workbench games are a very underrated source of fun among the people
I know. They mock the lack of colour and sound, which shows they have
not delved deep enough into this gaming genre.

SimplePac is a workbench game of good quality. Once it's on your
drive you open the drawer and are greeted with the game and read me
icons. The read me is general information because you really should
know how to play PacMan.

Into the game and guess what.... It's PacMan! The Intro screen is a
nice picture and the game plays very well. Just move your PacMan
around the screen and eat all the pills. There are four ghosts
chasing you but if you eat a large pill then you have a certain
amount of time to eat the ghosts. That's it, PacMan pure and simple.

The problem is there is just one level and you can only get so much
enjoyment out of one level. I'm not sure but I think the ghosts get
quicker or there is less time to catch them after eating a power
pill but that's the only difference you get for completing a level,
and to be totally honest it was a bit hard to keep playing the same
maze over and over again. I feel this is a great let down.

Sebastian Bauer states this is an old game of his that he has updated
but I think he should have included different mazes.
