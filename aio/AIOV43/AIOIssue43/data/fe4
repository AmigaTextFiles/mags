Well, AIO has had it's first musical submission in the form of a midi
file perfect for GMPlay, submitted to us by Johan Van Mensel.  No guarrentees
who'll like it or not, just load it up and give it a play.  Just look for the file
"More_than_enough.midi" in the AIO root directory and give it a listen.

This has brought up a related matter.  Seems as Aminet is more full of
mods and midis than actual programs so it seems thgat maybe it's about
time for AIo to have a small music corner; someone to cover the Amiga
music scene, recommend the best musical downloads from Aminet, and give
any helpful muscial advice, naturally with a heavily laced Amiga slant.

So, if you think you can handle this light editor's job, or know someone
that could, then just drop us a line at music@aio.co.uk and we'll start
taking names.
