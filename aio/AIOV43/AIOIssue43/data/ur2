If your clock is broken or low on battery, then this is something you
really should take a peek at. DateX is similar in the way of other
applications in this genre in that it pops up a window every time you
cold-start your computer, however, DateX saves the the date and time
that was last stated, thus making it a little easier to get up and
running.

You easilly install the program by copying the executable to the
WB-startup drawer. The program looks as nice as any type of program
that does these things can, I suppose, so nothing much to comment
there. A little plus here, though, is the ability to change the fonts
via tooltypes. There are multilanguage support, which is always nice,
however, it only comes with an Hungarian catalog. The inbuilt
language is however English, which shouldn't scare off too many
people from using this one, hopefully.
