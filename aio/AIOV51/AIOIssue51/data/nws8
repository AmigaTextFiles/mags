Today a web site has been started to drum up support
for a limited relaunch of the Viper 530 CPU upgrade for the Amiga 500. 
This upgrade was the last A500 upgrade (Along with the Viper 520) and 
it held a full SCSI 2 interface, 2 3.5" IDE ports 1X 2.5" IDE port, 
Upto 128 Meg fast ram upgrade and OS 2.04. This card never went into 
mass production but DCE are now willing to relaunch the card if enough 
people want it. If you are looking to kickstart your A500 (Heading to 
the goal of running OS3.9) then this is the card for you. Put your 
name down and lets see if we can get it relaunched. Do it now, You 
may never be able again. Visit www.cdtv.org.uk/viper/
