{pp}
Haage & Partner Computer GmbH and Amiga Inc. are proud to present
AmigaOS XL for x86.
{pp}
AmigaOS XL on a demo system couple run most of the popular Amiga 68k
applications at upto 20 times the speed of a 060 based Amiga by using
a specially modified and highly accelerated 68k emulator.
{pp}
The machine used for the presentation is a 1.2GHz Athlon based PC
fitted with components common to mid-ranged specified PCs.
{pp}
Now you can have super fast versions of PageStream, ImageFX,
ArtEffect, Cinema 4D, Real3D and games.
{pp}
You can install the AmigaOS XL for x86 onto a laptop. This provides
the first Amiga laptop that many users have been waiting for 16 years
to see.
{pp}
The Amiga can now benefit from the new gigahertz CPUs now available
for futher acceleration of the Amiga.
{pp}
AmigaOS XL for x86 includes two emulator systems: Amithlon and AmigaXL for QNX..
{pp}
{bold}AMIthlon - The fastest Amiga ever{nobold}
{pp}
All you need to do is insert the CD and boot into AMIthlon without any installation
worries.
{pp}
The development team of Harald Frank (VMC) and Bernd Meyer even implemented native
support for nVidia and Matrox graphics cards providing maximum graphics performance.
{pp}
With AMIthlon you can even use your old Amiga hard-disk in your PC.
{pp}
{bold}AmigaXL for QNX - The most functional Amiga ever{nobold}
{pp}
The host operating system for AmigaXL is QNX 6.1, included in the package.
QNX has a micro kernel and the drivers are run as separate processes which
can be dynamically started and stopped. This makes the system extremely light
weight and resource efficient.
{pp}
Features that QNX provides can directly be used within the emulated Amiga.
This includes network functionality and multimedia features. QNX applications
like the web browser Opera® can be started directly from the AmigaOS screen.
