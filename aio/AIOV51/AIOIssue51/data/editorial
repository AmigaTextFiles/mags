Little comment here about recent events in New York City, save one
small observation.  Which company has been noticeably absent from
helping out survivors and rescuers, which has NOT made the news with
gifts to relief funds though they have enough money to underwrite the
entire project themselves and call it a tax write-off?  Yes, Microsoft
has once again shown it's dollar-bill shaped heart and complete lack
of concern of anything outside the bottom-line.

Of late, Microsoft has been advertising it's upcoming "revolutionary"
operating system... just a more bloated version of the world's
sloppiest OS.  Revolutionary?
{pp}
...We'll {bold}show{nobold} them revolutionary.
{pp}
Now is the time for every Amiga owner to take a collective evil grin
at the mention of  a revolutionary OS coming out, because we
{bold}know{nobold} wherefrom the REAL revolution will come from.
