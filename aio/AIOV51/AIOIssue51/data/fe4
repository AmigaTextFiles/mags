Recently the following news clip was posted on one of thew Amiga news
sites in reference to the user liscence agreement for Frontpage
2002...

"Under Section #1 [of the End User License Agreement], Grant of
License, the second paragraph headed "Restrictions" states in part:
"You may not use the Software in connection with any site that
disparages Microsoft, MSN, MSNBC, Expedia, or their products or
services, infringe any intellectual property or other rights of these
parties, violate any state, federal or international law, or promote
racism, hatred or pornography.""

It basically says that anyone who buys Microsoft Frontpage is not
allowed to publish anything that Microsoft doesn't approve of.  This
strikes at the heart of free speach and I'm not even sure if (in 5the
U.S.) it would even stand up in court, it goes against the consitution
and the Bill of Rights so much.  Me thinks Microsoft is confusing who it
is that makes laws.  {bold}governments{nobold} make laws,
{bold}companies{nobold} make a profit.

I find it obhorent to that Microsoft would even {italic}think{noitalic}
that it could dictate or change such basic policies of social rights,
that they are not only above the law but that they ARE the law.  The
government doesn't have the right to tell you what you can say or publish,
certainly no mere company has any such rights.
{pp}
Let not this encroachment upon social acceptability go unnoticed.  Urge
your friends to do two things.  One, do not buy Frontpage or other
Microsoft products that have such things in their user agreements, and
two email Microsoft your displeasure at such affrontary.

If the courts won't teach them a lesson by breaking them up, then it's up
to the people to send them strong signals that we will not allow them to
get away with such presumptuous activities.  With Microsoft's history,
if this goes unnoticed then they'll only try something more; they are
convinced they are above the laws and moralities that govern real
people.
{pp}
They are wrong.
