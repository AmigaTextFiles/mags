Welcome to the letters page. This is the section where you can
air your views to the Amiga public. No matter what you want to say,
write in and we'll most likely publish it.

Hi guys.
{pp}
Well, I thought that maybe it was time to think about why I still love
my Amiga, and hopefully shine a little light for a few people.
{pp}
Lets start with Intuition, the Amiga's GUI. Can anyone honestly say they
have found a faster, easier system? When I say fast, I mean in the sense
that I can access everything I want quickly, and don't have to spend
time looking for it. When I say easier, I mean it's simpler to use and
less hassle, although perhaps a little more work for beginners. Okay,
these days you need a few patches and MUI, but essentially Intuition has
got all the basic principals right. Just look at Opus, it couldn't work
on any other windowing system.
{pp}
Next, some of the Amiga's special features. You may think that the
custom hardware is next to useless now, with everyone using graphics
cards, sound cards, I/O cards etc. Well, think again. I wouldn't write
off AGA or Paula anyway, but just look at some of the other stuff in
your Amiga. The floppy drive interface, for example. It might be a bit
slow for HD disks, but at least your computer does freeze up when you
format a disk like Windows does. The CIA timers are something that
gerneric PC hardware can't compete with too. Ever noticed how a PC can't
even seem to play animations on the net at constant speed? What about
games, they are never running at constant speed and it gives many people
vertigo sickness. Well, the CIA timers provide extreemly accurate timing
for just such applications.
{pp}
Lets not forget the classics of the past either, which still run today
on Amiga hardware better than any emulation. Not just the games, but all
the serious software. Plus, the Amiga PD scene is still one of the best,
with some amazing shareware and freeware software available. Can you
name a better editor than GoldED? What about a better email client than
YAM?
{pp}
Sometimes, you have to use a PC, but it's not like many people enjoy
wrestling with Windows apps. What Amiga users have is something special,
something that is too good to let die.
{pp}

Hello,{p}
i want to UNSUBSCRIBE from AIO mailing list. The reasons are:
{pp}
1. Very, very slow loading of articles{p}
2. Font is bad{p}
3. Articles are bad even more, they are too short, with no pics
(except for AIO logo on top), no instuctions on how to use, no speed
comparisions on differents amiga (for example, usability of Riva on
040 proccesors or similar stuff)...{p}
4. Mostly, your articles are based on others people experience and
commercials which i can read on news site every day (but with pics){p}
5. Too often you have bad links, leading to nothing (assembly results
and techical details about scope projects in ish 50){p}
{pp}
{italic}Editor Replies:{p}
Regards the first two, we DO have someone workoing on the GUI but he,
like a good number of our editors, also happens to be busy with
college work and other projects as well.  Work IS being done
though.{p}
Regards the next two, one of our editors has been having a rather busy
time of it (school, job, computer problems), and another needs
replacing (care to be our Games Editor?).  Slow output from the Mother
Company doesn't help much either.  Just a couple of slow months is
all.{p}
As for the last point, the article in question was a bit of a rush job
and we were unable to be as thorough in checking anything out.  When
information comes directly from the guy behind a given project you
tend to take their word for the veracity of the links (maybe we
typed one in wrong?  Or the site was temporarily unavailable?).{p}
On the other hand, if {bold}you{nobold} have any suggestions or ideas
for an article then be all means write in or submit something.  We
thrive from input ("Need more input"- quick, name that film).{p}
