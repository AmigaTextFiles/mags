We've all seen them, and despite AOL's claims to the contrary we know 
they date back to the old BBS days.  They're Smilies (some people that 
like big official-sounding names like calling them Emoticons, but Smiley
would be the correct term), originanly started out to express emotions 
that would be otherwise hard to type, they've evolved into an artform 
unique to computer remote chatting.   A few years ago I started
collecting them from a number of different sources and finally decided 
it would be fun to post them up here.

This isn't anything meaningful or even useful, it's just for fun.  In
this issue's root directory you'll find the file 
"SmiliesDictionary.text"; this is a standard ASCII file with a rather
long list of Smilies and a few shortcut phrases.  Many you'll know, a 
lot you won't, and I can see some of you now on IRC just waiting for an 
excuse to use some of them.  JUst use it for your own enjoyment.

Got any not in the list?  Then email them in and I'll do a follow-up
article sometime.  Maybe even offer a free issue of AIO to the most
creative entry (okay, so that's not really a big thing).
