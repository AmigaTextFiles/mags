Just an ecclectic variety here this month folks, only one isite of
which is really serious.  So, without further ado...
{pp}
{pp}
{bold}Chef/Jive/ValSpeak{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/jbc/home/chef.html{noitalic}{p}
A translator page of sorts, just type in some text and select which
language you wish it translated iunto then clickthe RUN button.  The
twist:  Available languages are Swedish Chef, Jive, Valley Girl, Pig
Latin, or all of the above.  Rather amusing.

{bold}Terrorism Research Center{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.terrorism.com/index.html{noitalic}{p}
Little need for comment here, in light of recent events.  A site with
information and essays on terrorism, how to combat or avoid it, what
to watch for, counterterrorism measures, and even profiles for
terrorist and counterterrorist organizations.

{bold}Spam Mimic{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.spammimic.com/explain.shtml{noitalic}{p}
Not a site promoting Spam... exactly.  Actually it's a way of sending
encrypted email without anyone knowing it's really encrypted.  What it
does is convert your entered text (simple one line message) into something that looks just like
spam.  You then pout the output into your email. and mail it.  The guy
at the other end then clips that out and goes back to this site to
have it decoded.  Even government email snoopers filter out Spam  and
what's more it doesn't LOOK encypted.  Worth a try for the truly
paranoid.  Warning; it's Java is a bit more then Voyager can handle;
either use Aweb for this site, or when the otherwise-blank screen
comes up with the word "Encoded" then do a View Source to see the output text.

{bold}The Brunching Shuttlecocks{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.brunching.com/{noitalic}{p}
Another humor site, though harsd to give this one a strict focus. 
They have movie reviews, they have reviews and ratings of other
things (types of psychic powers, stuff from The Airline Catalog,
Wonders Of The Ancient World), humorous pictures and Flash animations,
humor from real life (like the newspaper headlinre that reads "17
remain dead in Morgue Shooting Spree"), and a bunch of other odities. 
Irregularly positioned humor worth the look and a chuckle.

{bold}Art Bell Official Web Site{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.artbell.com/{noitalic}{p}
Art Bell is a radio personality local to California that runs a talk
show that's just a bit different.  He'll talk about anything from
extraterrestrials to professional vampire slayers.  There seems not a
subject he's afraid to tackle and his web site reflects this
variety.{p}
The "Wat's New" link gives a list that looks like The X-Files exploded
all over it but it's basically the list of things sent into Art Bell.
Photos of creatures and phenomena, his own photos of objects that
have been sent him, and the like.  Makes for a real education of what
you {italic}didn't{noitalic} think was out there.{p}
The Library has archives of daily news from around the world
(including more mainstream stuff), earthquake and volcano locator
maps, archives of bumnper music played on the show, email, links, and
the Roswell crash site stuff that was annonymously sent him.{p}
The Gallery is where you'll find his pictures of Bigfoot, the Shadow
People, UFOs, US space shuttles and Aurora sketches, and some fun
stuff.{p}
The Program link tells you how to tune in on radio, TV, or satellite. 
If that isn't enough, Interact gives chat rooms and call-in phone
numbers because, yes, Art Bell will talk to just about any
serious-speaking person on his show.{p}
All in all, there's enough archived and updating information at this
site in so many strange and interesting things as to keep one going back
here for quite a while.  Maybe the X-Files script writers should
visit this site a few times.
