{subhead}XDM 2.0{def}{p}
Review by Robert Karlsson

{pp}
In these times of virtually no disks circulating around, I was a
little surprised to find this program, even considering it's from
1995, when HD's were starting to gain ground even on the Amiga.
Anyway, the idea is  good, so I decided to see what it was all about.
XDM comes with a huge array of features, to make it better and more 
efficient than its predecessor DMS, you can even convert already
existing DMS  archives into XDM format (this requires DMS to be in
C:).
{pp}
XDM isn't an entirely "new" invention, it's based upon the
compressing methods of LZX, and therefore requires LZX to be present
on your  system. It also has support for some commands only available
on a registered version of LZX (which shouldn't be too much problem
to obtain these days of non-development). You can also compress
CrossDOS disks and Mac disks (untested).
{pp}
So, how are the results then? I tested DMS, TransADF (later
compressed with LZX) and finally XDM. The disk I began with for
packing is somewhat of a rarity, it's the jubileum disk of AUGS
(Amiga User Group Sweden) from 1991, I chose this one because it's
smacked to the limit with texts, pictures, archives and programs, to
give the most diverse packing (this is also an OFS disk).
{pp}
The old trustee DMS gave a nice performance. Here are the results:
{pp}
{fixed}
 FILE: aio-test3.dms
 SIZE: 371714 bytes
 TRKS: 80
 TIME: 0 mins. 47 secs.
 RATE: 102 tracks per minute
{def}
{pp}
TransADF imaged the contents of the disk in about 38 seconds, but
then the LZX archiving was of course not made. The results with both
the imaging and the archiving I estimate would be slightly faster
than DMS (not accounted for is the time it takes to launch the LZX
archiving process and so on...). The LZX archived image ended up
being 357181 bytes, a considerably smaller end result.
{pp}
{fixed}
XDM gave these results:
Archive size      : 353170 bytes
Percentage Saving : 61 %
Mashing time      : 51 seconds

* (Archive size      : 356644 bytes
Percentage Saving : 61 %
Mashing time      : 53 seconds)

(* this is the same operation but with "All AmigaDOS Tracks" option,
which is primarly used for non-standard disks and PC/Mac disks, as
you can see this is slightly less efficient.)
{def}
{pp}
The archive that came from this operation was 353170 bytes in size,
slightly smaller than the LZX'd ADF file, but it had the slowest
finishing rate.
{pp}
Dearchiving the XDM files goes just excellent, it is slightly slower
than DMS. It took 82 seconds, whereas DMS took 1:19 minutes. Marginal
difference, which I imagine comes from that de-compression of XDM is
a little more time consuming because of the smaller archive.
{pp}
Moreover, you can also convert DMS archives into XDM ones. I tried
this with the DMS I used for this review. Only thing I dislike about
it is that you need a disk to temporarily store the unpacked stuff
(alternatively you can use a RAD: disk), so this is a rather slow
process, but it might come in handy if you decide to use this program
on a regular basis.
{pp}
XDM won the little test with a small marginal. The advantage XDM can
however be questioned. It's not exactly a well established format (I
at least have never come across something packed with XDM). But who
knows, maybe that'll change some day. On the other hand, I think that
disks are pretty much obsolete on any computer platform, and I think
most people would agree with me on that point, so the questions I ask
is Do we really need another diskarchiving program? And does it
really matter nowadays with huge harddisks to store files and fast
connections to get them?
