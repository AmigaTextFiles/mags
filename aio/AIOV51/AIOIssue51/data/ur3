This is what I would call the best filesplitter/joiner there is for
the Amiga. This particular version of the program is however not
available to the public because the author has left the Amiga scene
for good it seems, he did however supply me with this updated version
before he left, and it's been lying on my harddisk ever since without
ever really being used until I got a PC. If you're looking for easy
and fast ways of splitting archives for transfer to a Windows PC and
the easiest way there is to re-join it, this is it. Filesploin allows
you to create a batchfile, which when executed automatically joins
the files through the internal join command in Windows.

All you really do is choose what file you want to split, the size
(either you type it yourself or use the predefined sizes available).
You can't choose where to you want to split the archive, which is a
little downside, it automatically splits to where you took the file
to be splitted from. It's the same when joining, then you also must
make sure you have enough space to put the file together again where
you have the splitted files stored. When you've set all things
necessary, it's just a matter of splitting the files and begin the
fun of carrying tons of disks down to the PC.

Filesploin was written in ARexx, and that makes it a little slower
than a program made in C etc., would be, but I think that is a small
price to pay for such a useful program. I have however now and then
run into a few bugs in the past, but these have never really made any
real problems, so in general I would say this is a pretty stable
program, and despite the small flaws, I would think twice every time
I decided to split a file for transfer to a PC.
