Cloanto had the pleasure of joining Saku 2001, the Amiga event organized
by the Finnish Amiga Users Group and held at Heureka, the Finnish Science 
Center, on September 1st.

During the event the public and Cloanto developers had a chance to 
exchange ideas about the Amiga universe in general and Amiga-PC 
connectivity and emulation in particular. The latest experimental version
of WinUAE, which includes a just-in-time (JIT) compiler created with the 
gracious contribution of Bernd Meyer, was available for testing, and
impressed for its amazing speed. Tasks such as opening folders, compiling 
Personal Paint with SAS/C, image processing and word processing appeared 
to be more than 10-20 times faster (more than 50 times faster at certain 
specific operations, such as color reduction with Personal Paint) than 
with the emulation as included in Amiga Forever 4.0. Use of DirectX
functionality and native x86 code for graphics-intensive tasks resulted in 
speeds which appeared to easily exceed those of JIT-enabled emulators on 
other platforms, while at the same time supporting the widest possible 
range of hardware. Like other programs which have recently been announced,
although very fast, this new emulation still needs a few refinements, 
after which it will be available as a recommended and free upgrade to
users of Amiga Forever. Buzzwords like "custom chips", "native x86 code", 
"virtual memory", "TCP/IP", "run from CD" and "fastest Amiga ever", to
mention only a few, while perhaps not completely familiar to those who 
just joined the enthusiasm for Amiga emulation, have been associated with
Amiga Forever since 1997, when Cloanto made it possible for emulation to
grow and prosper to the levels it reached today without fear of legal
consequences. Cloanto also announced that it will soon release a
completely new and free tool to the emulation community.
