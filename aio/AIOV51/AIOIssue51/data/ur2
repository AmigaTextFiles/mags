Following the line of diskarchiving, here's a program that is nearly
a must if you use DMS more or less frequently. DMS2HD is, as the name
states, a program made to extract the contents of a DMS archive to
your harddisk (or RAM:). It's really easy to use, and it does what
it's supposed to without the slightest fuzz. You can also use DMS2HD
in filemanagers, such as DOpus. It's comprised of a MUI GUI, through
which all functions are executed (additionally you can use the CLI,
especially if you want to use it alongside with DOpus you better
consider this option). DMS2HD works so that it automatically creates
a temporary RAD: disk in RAM:, to which the contents of the DMS
archive are extracted. This is a brilliant idea, it's as simple as
that. One small (but not very strange) disadvantage is that you can't
unpack no-dos disks to the RAD:. I, along with nearly every other
person that has used this program (I can imagine), tried it to see if
it was really true, and yes, Mr Falkenhahn didn't lie, it didn't work.

There's really nothing to mention about the configuration, all you do
is set the whereabouts of the DMS executable. After that you're set
to go.
