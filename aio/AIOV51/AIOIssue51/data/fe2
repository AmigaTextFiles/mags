A little theme here which should become rapidly obvious.  In all cases
of cleaning or repair your Amiga should be turned OFF and the power
chord unplugged just in case.  Even then, be careful what you touch.

Keyboard acting funny?  Always trying to signal you with that caps-lock
liught no matter {italic}how{noitalic} many different ways you reboot?
Well, before you go out looking for a new keyboard just try cleaning it.
take off the screws, carefully open it up, then take one of those cans of
pressurized air they make just for cleaning electronics and start
spraying.  There's a good chance that just might clear things up,
seeing as how there's no reason why dust can't itself conduct (it worked
for me).

Related to the above, it might also be a good idea to give your old Ami
a good dusting from time to time.  I'm beginning to think that those
cans of air are one of the better little investments a computer user can make
(and you don't even have to be a technician to use one).

If there's still some other problems, before you go posting to news
groups or someplace to have the thing serviced, always check the
obvious.  All connectionc secure?  Anything loose?  Did you accidently
bang your machine lately?  (that actually was enough to loosen my own
CPU daughterboard once).  Never underestimate the simple and obvious to
drive you nuts.

And above all, don't panic (okay, if you see a big hole in your
motherboard where one shouldn't be {bold}then{nobold} you can panic).
