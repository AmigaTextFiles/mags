German company to continue porting Opera to the Amiga
{p} {p}
The initial Amiga team has ended its involvement in the port.  We are
making good progress negotiating with a German team, and hope to have
finality on this very soon, too.
{p} {p}
We remain committed to the Amiga platform, but please bear with us as we
look for a new team.  Below, please find Tim Corringham's assessment of the
situation resulting in him giving up the project:
{p} {p}
"Unfortunately the Cologne show did not provide the hoped for boost for the
Amiga Classic market, and Ramjam Consultants have therefore abandoned the
Amiga Opera port.
{p} {p}
Previous offers of support from Amiga Inc appear to have been withdrawn,
and the future for the Amiga Classic market now seems even more bleak than
at any other time.
{p} {p}
While the big public news from Cologne is undoubtably good for the future
of the new generation of Amigas expected to be released sometime during the
year 2000 - the new kernel will be Neutrino from QNX Software Systems Ltd -
a lot has happened out of the public eye to cause most remaining Amiga
Classic developers to lose confidence."
