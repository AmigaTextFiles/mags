Aminet's readme-files are really easy to write by hand with a simple text
editor, right? Yet there are a couple readme-creators around... Well don't
bother, you were right all along! ARF-wizard is a good example of this.
{p} {p}
  First I thought I'd just run ARF-wizard directly, but it said "Can't Find
IFF 'BODY'" with two "OKAY!" buttons. Uh-oh, looks like Blitz... Well, it
obviously needs some file, so I decided to run the installer. But the icon
was outrageously deceitful; instead of the standard Installer tool I got a
DOS script that just did some things and disappeared!
{p} {p}
  Well then, let's have a little look-see at the script... okay, it copied
"ed" and "join" versions 37.x to C:, replacing my 39.x versions. Thanks!
It also shoved the pic it needs to ENV: (hmm...). Ok, on with the testing.
The program itself looks irritatingly like an installer from Windoze;
one question per "page" and back/next buttons on the bottom. It asks all
the required and some optional fields and lets you edit the description
with "ed" (you can't choose the editor). After that it presumably uses the
"join" command to generate the readme file (which, by the way, can't have
spaces in the file name or it'll be cut).
{p} {p}
  That's it, then. There you have an "easily" generated readme file, which
would've been loads easier to write by hand if you've already managed to
create something you want to send to Aminet. On top of this all, the "Bugs"
section of the manual is quite interesting. "May crash on exit if used from
WB".. "NO error handling on cli interface" (!!!!)... and something about the
GUI not working... Wonderful, don't you think?
{p} {p}
  The funniest thing in all of this is that writing readme-files shouldn't
even be easy, or as in this case, so limited. The readme is the number one
reason why people download a file or skip it, so don't you think you should
spend some time writing and preparing it if you want someone to actually try
your program or game, or whatever? :o)
