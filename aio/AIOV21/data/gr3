I downloaded this, because it was small, only 6K, but was it worth the 6
seconds I waited for it to download?

For the size, I wouldn`t expect this to be spectacular, but it was quite
enjoyable. It seems that many people are making snake games, mainly because
they are easy to program. This one is easier to program than most, because
the snake constantly gets longer, so there is no need to delete the end of
the snake, while you are moving. Simple.

The idea is to collect so many white blobs, without hitting the black
blobs. (I think those colours are right). When you have collected enough
white blobs a big blue door opens and you have to get inside to go to the
next level.

It is simple, but great fun to play while your disk is formatting, or your
downloading a 1MB file. You get the idea.
