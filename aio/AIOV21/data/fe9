Last month I covered utilities designed to enhance the function and
productivity of your Amiga, this month I'll go into all those extra,
really unnecessary, programs that only affect appearance and
environment. Such utilities, however, do have a function, in that they
make your computer a lot more relaxing to work with. And when you're at
your computer for any number of hours a day that definitely counts for
something in the user-friendly category.
{p} {p}
Of course, all this assumes that you have enough resources in your system
to handle such fun little extras without bogging down your computer's
performance. Any bell or whistle that gets in the way of your computer
doing it's job shouldn't be used. That said, let's get on with my
selection.
{p} {p}
All programs herein are to be found on Aminet, and again I've not given
anything more than a quick overview, leaving any full reviews to the
Utils section.

First for the obvious. If you don't have New Icons by now then crawl out
of your hole and download it. Considering that icons are a major part of
your Workbench's appearance, nice-looking ones are almost essential to
your sanity, expecially when they don't take up any precious Chip Ram.
With up to 256 colors an icon, graphics board users can get some really
good looking icons to ease their eyes with.  One set I recomend is the
Glow Icons set, a recent archive that steers away from the well-colored
but highly unimaginative New Icon sets that usually proliferate.

Arq (V1.83) is an oldie but a goody for sooping up your system's
requesters with animated images. Out of development for a while, it's
still fun to have around and pretty stable, though a fast procesor is
advisable (or then it WILL crash). There's another similar one around
(MSQ, I think it's called) that seeks to replace it with an updated
program, but that newer one uses only still images that completely lack
anyt sort of animated pizzazz to them.  I'll stick with ARQ.

Want your windows to explode when they open up, spiralling pyrotechnic
displays that make the MAC expanding window function look dull? Then
Caboom is a perfect choise, complete with user-configurable explosion
style and speed.

Screen blankers have become less a screen-saver and more of an
entertaining artform; eye-candy for an inactive computer when it's
waiting for something better to do. Of the many good ones out there,
Garshneblanker is defintely at the top of the list, cpomplete with a
rather large variety of blankers availablke. But I've recently switched
to madhouse because it can not only import blankers from all the other
major blankers out there but it will also play selected MOD files with
chosen blankers, comething I haven't enjoyed since the old Maxon days.
Word of warning though, Madhouse will sometimes crash if left running
for too long and development has been discontinued (though it's now
released as freeware).

Everyone needs system sounds, they liven up every little action your
computer takes. Open a screen, a Boing sound is heard, close a window a
crashing might be the efefect, insert a disk and yet another files
plays. By far the best one for this is IFX, with too many configuration
and settings preferences to be covered in anything less than a complete
review (anybody in Utils want to take this one?).

Solid windown dragging, ability to drag a window off screen, asorted
window and screen hot keys, iconify gadgets, and anything else window
and screen oriented are to be had with PowerWindows. A good central
source for all your window conveniences.
{p} {p}
Also by the PowerWindows author is PowerWB adds gadgets for things like
the Cleanup and "View As" window functions, as well as allowing you to
add window title bar gadgets to perform any desired WB menu function.
Throw in a few hotkeys for any window functions that Power Windows
missed and it adds fingertip-easy convenience- always a good thing.
{p} {p}
The last one is pure unnecessary eye-candy.  Birdie changes the default
colors for active and inactive windows into user-definable patterns,
choosing a random pattern to outline each window in for each window
opened, and a single chosen pattern for active windows. Amusing to look
at, but be careful with this one because it isn't the most stable hack
in the world, and it IS a hack.  This one's for graphics boards only and
I'd recommend a fast processors at that.

Well, that's it for this time.  If you happen to have any useful tips
yourself for sooping up an Amiga then by all means write in and I'll
continue this series with your input.
