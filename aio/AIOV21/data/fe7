Introducing KOSH
{p} {p}
It may seem odd but I'm actually going to talk about another operating
system this month. Nope, I haven't deserted the Amiga, far from it, just
introducing a new development which has so much of the Amiga community
spirit, 'look and feel', and power that it's an Amiga in everything
except name. No matter what your background, the Kommunity Operating
System and Hardware project (KOSH for short) may well be a dream come
true - no Amiga experience necessary. If you're reading this, then
you're obviously very receptive to the idea of life beyond Windoze...
ideal KOSH material, really.
{p} {p}
While other visions of the Amiga's future have focused upon updating the
operating system or the hardware, there has been one component left to
one side - the Amiga community. Let's face it, the Amiga, for all its
achievements in OS design, revolutionary hardware and integration,
would have died an uncomfortable and lonely death in the post-Commodore
years without community spirit.Community spirit thrives on many
platforms, notably the so-called 'alternative platforms' (Linux, Mac,
Palm, Acorn, BeOS, etc.), and every community expresses their own
frustrations with the corporate machinery controlling their platform
(yep, even Linux!).
{p} {p}
KOSH aims to wipe the slate clean, so to speak. Put the community firmly
in charge - no one person or corporation controls the system. No
bankruptcy worries, no monopolistic attitudes, no marketing hype, no
politics or squabbling, no abandonment - the way it should be. Linux has
been a shining example of the benefits of community driven OS
development, and KOSH aims to take this concept to the next logical
step - introducing the strong possibility of community-oriented hardware
development for good measure. With the slate clean, the community can
build without the baggage of the past, without conformance to external
politics - putting the emphasis back on revolution and vision in
computing.
{p} {p}
Okay, so these are hefty words with more than a little optimism and
idealism. Not a line of code has been written, this is the beginning, we
just have promises and words (however, if you subscribe to the open KOSH
discussion lists, you'll find a LOT of wise words!) but nothing tangible
as yet.Community is one  thing, but what will KOSH actually offer over
contemporary operating systems? Why should you install KOSH on your
precious computer?
{p} {p}
KOSH aims to deliver a highly flexible system based upon a dynamic,
'organic' environment called an 'Object Sea'. Objects in this digital
sea communicate between themselves, react, create, develop and maintain
according to the requirements placed upon them. From this stems the
ability to customise, reconfigure and expand your hardware and software
investment with ease - computers should never place artificial limits on
the user without some very good reasons. The 'vanilla' KOSH OS will
provide a basic set of objects which the user can expand upon to taste
from a selection of developer created objects. Users can purchase the
objects they need, building their own OS to taste, rather than dealing
with a bloated system bundle containing things they'll probably never
use, but have to install anyway.
{p} {p}
If you work with graphics, you can add JPEG, PNG, GIF and other objects
to the sea for transparent handling of these image formats - or maybe
sprinkle some objects for pens, paint, palette, some image processing
objects and so on. If you're on a network, a few extra objects provide
seamless distributed processing with other KOSH machines (Beowulf on an
office LAN anyone?), or maybe allow you to 'drag' your current desktop
to another desktop, taking the still-running applications and settings
with you. Don't like the GUI? Don't want a GUI? Need KOSH for embedded
systems work? Drop in the appropriate interface objects and use them
instead. With this type of fully expandable object-oriented environment,
the boundaries become temporary ones - each user can set their own
limits, and work the way they want to work.
{p} {p}
Sound exciting?
{p} {p}
Best of all, KOSH's community is growing and evolving rapidly, and the
growth relies upon people of all talents - KOSH values your ideas, not
your money. How many other OS developers are more interested in you than
your wallet? Programmers, artists, musicians, managers, writers, web
developers - whatever your talents, KOSH needs you and will offer
something in return for anything you contribute. Unlike Linux, KOSH
isn't a platform for the advanced user, but something for all - which is
why your participation will always be warmly received... whether you cut
your teeth on a PDP-11, or bought your first computer yesterday.
{p} {p}
As a programmer, there are few things more rewarding than stepping back
from something you've just coded and saying "I built that!" - now its the
turn of the non-programmer to join shoulder to shoulder with the
programmers and say "We built that!" as the first versions of KOSH are
installed on computers across the world. No longer will the average user
or platform community have to put up with software designed by a
corporation who think they know best, but built by the same people who
actually use it every day.
{p} {p}
So if you've ever been frustrated by a computer that works the way
someone else decided; if you're a developer unhappy with the support
from the powers that be; or you're an artist, writer or musician who
feels their creativity constrained by computer software; if you've had
to reinstall an entire OS for the third time this week because the
manufacturer was more interested in adding new features than getting
their existing code to work properly - then it's likely you feel no
one's listening.Well, KOSH is listening - so maybe it's time you wiped
the slate clean and made your computer work for you, not the other way
around?

it looks like a good idea, take a look at the official website:
