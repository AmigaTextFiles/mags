MegaBook is a simple address book for OS 2.04+. At first glance it looks
a bit rough, mainly because of topaz and GadTools. The button bar is very
clear: you can load, save, print and search the phonebook and of course
add & delete entries and browse through them. Starting a new phonebook is
as easy as it can be; just click a button and then enter the data. That's
about all you need to know to get started; everything about MegaBook is
pretty self-explanatory.

  There's not much you can do about the GUI; it's supposed to accept any
fixed-width font, but I only got the system default font (XEN 9 on my system)
working in addition to topaz 8. Selecting a font caused it to just use topaz,
or if it was on its own screen it used topaz and trashed the window drag bars.
I've been told that a new version should be released soon, so it'll probably
be fixed by then.

  You can also change the field names ("Name", "Address" etc.) except for the
country field :) The two string gadgets in the bottom left part can be filled
with anything, and you can select their meaning with the cycle gadgets on the
left. The possibilities are: tel, fax, home, work, email, data, URL or empty
(not specified). But I'm surprised that you can't enter all of them, just two
of your choice. There are also ARexx scripts that you can use to launch a fax,
email or WWW client directly from the program, with the corresponding field
given to it as a parameter. And finally, you can also add extra notes for the
entry with a text editor.

  MegaBook is very simple to use and fast. You can also import and export
many different types of phone books. The lack of configurability makes it a
bit limited, and for some purposes inadequate, but it's very well suited for
regular phone books and you can start using it right after unarchiving :)
