Sometimes you need to know the hex number of a screen mode (e.g. for some
game done by a pretty lazy programmer :) and GetHexModeID is a small tool to
help you do just that. It'll simply open a screenmode requester and print the
hex and decimal representation of the selected screen mode. Yes, that's all
it does! :) But still, it'll come in very handy sometimes :)
