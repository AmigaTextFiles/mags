Welcome to what will hopefully be a regular article, where we go over
possible new features or changes to be included in the next generation
of our favorite machine. Maybe Amiga Inc will read this and get a few
ideas, maybe not, but at least there's a place to sound them out. I will
start this month off with my own ideas, but if any of you out there have
something you would like to see done to either the hardware or OS for
the next Amiga, then by all means write in and I'll include it in a
future edition of this column. And now for the first installment.

Disk Drives. Some say the old floppy is dead and that we only need CDs
and Zips, others say we just need to upgrade to High Density Drives. For
my part, the following has to be considered before deciding the fate of
the old floppy.{p}
    1) Backwards compatibility. Let's face it, there's always going to
be some double and high density disks out there and they're going to
need something to be run with. Any solution will have to run them as
well.{p}
   2)  Reliability. Zip isn't all that reliable. It IS after all a
series of floppy disk films stacked on top of one another, which runs
the risk these filmy things bouncing up against one another with a good
rap on it from someone's finger.{p}
   3) Capacity. Two megs just ain't cutting it anymore, what with
continually larger programs and information overload. Something with
enough capacity yet still portable. Stuff like 1 Gig SyQuest and 2 Gig
Jazz drives are great for large-scale backup, but too much for normal
pasing-around disks.

The solution? Anyone check out the LS120 lately? 120 megs capacity in a
standard floppy-sized disk, with only a single floppy platter so you
don't have the Zip problems, and best of all the drive can take all the
old double and high density disks. A perfect and obviouss solution. My
first input for the next gen mahcine would be to have TWO LS120 drives
as standard, replacements for the floppy drives.

And yes, I still think we should have two drives. No matter how much
people say about only one floppy needed if any at all, having two is
still good for disk to disk copying, and those times when you're trying
to compare what's on one disk that isn't on the other or just need to
shuffle stuff around from one disk to another. The LS120 would be the
logical and perfect inheritor of the old floppy legacy.

Next month, more dreams for Amiga Next Gen.
