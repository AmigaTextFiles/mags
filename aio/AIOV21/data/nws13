Wasted Dreams or Distant Space?{p}
-------------------------------{p}
We have received many letters from Amiga fans requesting that we give back
the old name to the game Wasted Dreams instead of new one Distant Space.
So we have decided to fulfill that request and to come back with the old
name, so from now on the game will be known as Wasted Dreams.
