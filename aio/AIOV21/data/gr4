I actually got this off an Amiga Format cover C.D (AFCD36), but it is also
available on the Aminet, but its hardly recent. Oh well.

This is set to be the next Monkey Island on the Amiga. It stars Gilbert who
has to find a magic mushroom, which his grandfather had to protect, but it
has gone missing, just before the big mushroom party, of which it is
needed. Gilbert`s grandfather has been thrown into prison and is going to
be executed, unless Gilbert can help him, by finding the magic mushroom and
the theif.

This is a very early demo, and only features two rooms, which is
surprising, if you take into the account the size of the archive. The game
is set to be developed on P.C and Amiga, and will be on C.D, which is good,
because you would need about 20 disks for 40 locations, at the rate the
authors are working at the moment.

When you load the game, you`ll get a long conversation with two villagers,
after that you can move around and go into Elton`s laboratory. There isn`t
much else you can do in the demo.

The graphics are brilliant, and if the rest of the game is going to be the
same, then this is going to be a big hit with Monkey Island vetrons.
