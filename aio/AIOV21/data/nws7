LhA is back in development
{p} {p}
The LhA file archiver has been out of development for as long as the author
has been programming for the Bill Gates Empire. But the LHA standard has not
stood still, with recent additions being new compression systems (known to
people who try to depack them on the Amiga as "lh6 and lh7 *again* :("). Now
Jim Cooper has taken up the code and is updating LhA to cope. Check local
BBSs and AmiNet for the new LhA 1.94 archiver. It is a beta, but works, and
is now freeware.
