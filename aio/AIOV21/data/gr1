 Draughts is a game that has (probably) been around for thousands of
years and its my guess that most of you will know what it is. Draughts
can also sometimes be called checkers. All the versions of Draughts
that I have played have been with red and blue counters although I
suppose you could have other colours, maybe its black and white in
checkers?

 This age old game has finally come to the Amiga to give us hours (!?)
of entertainment and bring back memorys of past childhoods. Draughts
is a two player game with this version letting you play two humans,
two computers or human vs. computer. On one side of the playing board
you have 12 red counters and on the other you have 12 blue counters,
the idea is to take all the other opponents counters. To take one of
their counters you need to jump over it and land in an open space,
if the space after the counter is not free then you can not take it.
In the situation that you can take the counter you {bold}MUST{nobold} even if
taking it doesn't suit your plan, this is one of the rules of the game
and this computerised version enforces the rule so no cheating!!!

 If you manage to get one of your counters to the far side where your
opponent started that counter will become crowned, ie. King, normally
your counters can only go forwards-diagonal but now they become king
you can go forwards&backwards-diagonal. If your counter becomes king in
the board game your opponent will have to use one of the 'taken' counters
and put it on top to make it king, in this game your counter receives
the letter K to signify King.

 You can jump as many opponent counters as you like as long as there is
a space to jump into. Once you have taken all counters you are the winner.
There are different difficulty levels from 1 to 9, with 1 being very
easy and 9 being very hard.

 Overall this is a nice little conversion, the graphics aren't stunning
but they are good enough to make this an enjoyable game. The sound on the
game is very poor with only a few 'pings' and 'bangs' which are taken
from built in Amos sound. If you like Draughts or Checkers it is well
worth taking a look at this.
