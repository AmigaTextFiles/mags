The following should be taken as rumor, though my source is an Amiga
dealer who has talked to Petro and a few others of note. Keep that in
mind when reading this.
{p} {p}
{bold}OS3.5 is WRITTEN!{nobold}{p}
QNX, the ones in charge of writting the core of OS4.0/5.0 was also the
one in charge of OS3.5.  Well, two things happened. One, 4.0 was
finished a year ahead of time, and now awaits only AI's plugins and a
machine to run on. The second thing is that OS3.5 is also finished.
{p} {p}
The problem? General Manager of AI said "no that's not what we wanted"
while QNX said "Yes, it's exactly wehat you wanted, here it is". In the
midst of this Petro said "Hey, it's finished, looks great, I'll market
it no matter WHAT the upper management at AI says.
{p} {p}
When's it coming out?  Answer: MARCH- according to Petro himself. News
of what's in OS3.5 include the following:{p}
  -RTG: despite AI saying they were taking RTG off the list, QNX put it
in, with support for every Amiga card out there.{p}
  -PCI card support:  for those A4000s with PCI slots attached.{p}
  -And now for the big one: Industry Standard Driver Support: Everything
from printers to scanners has a drivers disk that comes with it; fine
except it runs only on IBM and we Amiga people have to pay extra money
for third-party drivers. Well, 3.5 will RUN those standard drivers that
come with all those peripherals, allowing you to run the device exactly
as the manufacturer intended it.{p}
    Yes, everytime it says "IBM drivers" included, you can just use
those straight off the disk. Never again be deprived of proprietary
technology from your favorite printer or scanner.
{p} {p}
Other news: All those A4000s that Quickpak was trying to sell were taken
over by the Escom bankrupsy judge and given to Petro for immediate
liquidation. They're stock A4000/040 but the price is going to be
$240 (USD). Rumor has it someone's in negotiation to try and bring to
the price of the powerup/060 boards down to $800 to package with it.

Another rumor: The name of the Superchip is the "M1", or something like
that.
