 With all the clickBOOM rumours that are flying about we are going to
do a {bold}HOT TOPIC{nobold} on it next month, so if you have any ideas on
the current situation then drop us a letter. Do you think it will effect
sales of future games? will it put developers off signing with clickBOOM?
we want to hear your views so get writing.

Hi!
{p} {p}
Just wanted to say how cool your AIO mag is! The first one I
checked out was #19, and shortly I will get #20. The GUI is very
nice to use.

I have written a game which is on Aminet under {bold}<echaos.lha>{nobold} and
was wondering if anyone wanted to review it...?  Also, if you
review animations, i've recently uploaded {bold}<LETO-FishyKitty.lha>{nobold}
to pix/anim.
{p} {p}
Thanks,{p}

Hello Leto, it seems the nice comments are still comming in! As issue
19 was your first issue you will have missed your game review, it
was in issue 18, Aminet:Docs/Mags/AIOV18.lha.
{p} {p}
Unfortunally we don't review animations but if anyones interested
why not download Leto's anim and tell him what you think.{noitalic}

Hi!
{p} {p}
I have generated a programming tool for visual programming in pascal called
JVP (Jey Visual Pascal) and have uploaded it to the aminet. Now I need to
know if it is useful or not. There are a large amount of ideas which should
be implemented in it, but I feel it maybe worthless and it may be a risk!
So I decided to let ppl tell me to continue or stop developing.
One of my friends suggested me to ask you and other online magazines to ask
the readers to give their opinion about JVP.
{p} {p}
I would be pleased if you help me and thanks in advance.

regards,{p}

Well, if you have seen Shirdasht's program then please send him comments
at {noitalic}{bold}Shirdash@www.dci.co.ir{nobold}{italic} so he knows if he should continue
producing his program.{noitalic}
