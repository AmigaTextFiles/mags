The Vaporware website is back with a new design
{p} {p}
"Over the last two and a half years, VaporWare has lead the way in Amiga
Internet application development.  Vapor.com is home to such well-known and
highly regarded titles as AmIRC, the Amiga's premier IRC client, and
Voyager, the highly acclaimed web browser.
{p} {p}
We recently announced the addition of four new titles to our library -
Genesis, Scalos, X-Arc and Contact Manager.  Many of the applications here
are the work of Oliver Wagner, including AmIRC, Voyager and Microdot II.
We also feature applications written by Simone Tellini, the author of
STFax, Federico Pomi, and Mathias Mischler.
{p} {p}
VaporWare now offers automatic online registration using the SecuraPay
system, for secure online transactions.  Your keyfiles are sent to the
specified email address almost instantly.  If you've been looking for a
good opportunity to register some VaporWare applications, this is the
perfect chance.  Remember, discounts apply to bulk registrations.
{p} {p}
We hope you enjoy the clean and open new look we've given Vapor.com.  If
you have any comments, feel free to send email to webmaster@vapor.com."
