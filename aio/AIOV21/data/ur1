  Megallan II is an update from Dopus 5.5 and Megallan and includes
hundreds of new features and changes since the last release many of which
were suggested to GPSoftware since the last release.{p}
  The new features added since Dopus Megallan I are as follows:

space gauge, inline editing and drag and drop files into sub-directories.

{p} {p}
and other minor improvements.
{p} {p}
  Installation of the new features was very quick and painless and after
a reboot you especially notice the new menus although I did lose my configured
user menus. This was fixed by renaming the user_menu.old file back to user_menu
in the Buttons directory in Dopus. I have now started using the new FTP
functions rather than AmFTP like I used to and I love it, you can now copy
files to other sites without having to load up another program to do it and
it just uses standard listers to display the contents of the FTP site. I do
have to remember to run FTPQuit or else Miami thinks that there is still a
connection open, closing the FTP lister does not auto close the FTP site. A
simple script could fix that.
{p} {p}
  If you have ever used Workbench but dislike its lack of multi-tasking and
limited user-configurability will be in heaven with Dopus 5 and Megallan II.
The busy pointer is used less often, so you can do other things while copying
or moving large groups of files and you can configure listers to open in
icon or name mode but have action buttons at hand to manage your files
very easily without having to move to the menus at the top of the screen
like on Workbench.
{p} {p}
  I have yet to use all the new functions of Dopus 5 MII but I am
discovering new things with it and unlike Workbench they are integrated
and not hacked on with more programs, patches or commodities like the old
Workbench. Workbench is no more on my machine, Dopus rules!

{p} {p}
No bugs found as yet.
{p} {p}
{bold}GOOD POINTS{nobold}
{p} {p}
 Very powerful and useful file manager and Workbench replacement ever.
{p} {p}
{bold}BAD POINTS{nobold}
{p} {p}
 Requires a decent Amiga setup to get the best out of it despite the minimum
requirements supplied, can seem a bit slow in some cases esp. with a lot on
the screen. There is a steep learning curve to get the best out of Dopus
but it's well worth it once its configured to your liking!{p}
  Can seem just a bit expensive but if you look at it as an OS upgrade then
it very good value for money.

{bold}ALTERNATIVES{nobold}
{p} {p}
 Scalos by Alien Design{p}
 MBench{p}
 Workbench 3.5 by Amiga Inc (1st Half 99){p}
 Various file manager programs{p}
 eg SID, Ordering, Filer etc
{p} {p}
{bold}CONCLUSION{nobold}
{p} {p}
 If you find Workbench too simplistic and limited as it is even with patches
and commdities and long for the look of Windows 95/98 and Macos 8 then
Dopus Megallen II is for you. Well worth it and Workbench will never grace
your screen again!
