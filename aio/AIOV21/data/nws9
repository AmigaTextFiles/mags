The User Group Network (UGN) is pleased to announce the availability of the
User Group Startup Documents.  This kit provides a valuable resource to
those individuals wishing to start an Amiga related user group in their
area.  It can also provide useful information to existing user groups
interested in making their group better.
{p} {p}
The User Group Start Up Kit is a compilation of materials assembled by the
UGN's own Robert Hamilton (Lostman).  Robert has searched high and low to
include information on the following topics:  starting up, legal issues,
club services, user meetings, user needs, and working with other groups or
companies.  Also available is the User Group Startup Guide from Inprise
Inc.  (formally BorderBund).
