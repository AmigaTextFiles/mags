ClickBoom's Masterpiece Ready
{p} {p}
Two delays and over a month late, Napalm from ClickBoom is ready to ship to
customers and stores. Napalm is an original game from ClickBoom and not a
port from another platform, this games oozes Amiga excellence all over. The
demo has been played to death in many households, and even the extra time
offered by ClickBoom for pre-ordering hasn't keep many people from wanting
the full game as soon as possible.

Expect the game to arrive soon - a full review should be in the next issue
of AIO!
