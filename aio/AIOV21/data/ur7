What happens when you click "Use" or "Save" in some prefs program? Well, the
prefs file is saved to either ENV: (an assign to Ram:Env) or both ENV: and
ENVARC: (which is on the hard disk). The ENV: must be on Ram Disk, otherwise
clicking "Use" will have the same effect as "Save". Also, on every boot the
contents of ENVARC: is copied to ENV:. Now, this is where the problem is. On
my system it takes about 15 seconds to copy them all to ENV: - on every boot.
And that's where HappyENV steps in; it is a file handler that manages these
things so that there is no need to copy all the files to Ram Disk. And
clicking "Use" will still work the same way it did before!

  There's not much more to say about HappyENV. Installation required only
changing a couple lines in the startup-sequence, and I haven't found any
problems with programs (well, running DiskSalv caused an "unsupported packet"
warning from HappyENV but it didn't affect anything). HappyENV is a fully
OS friendly disk handler; the only hack in it is hiding the new device from
WB and file requesters, which is optional. I can only recommend it; it'll
save memory and speed up booting :)
