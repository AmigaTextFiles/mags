Depth Charge is a small and simple game. You take on the role of what
I would guess is a war ship which is placed on top of the sea, below you
are submarines and fish (?!) you have to release a bomb so it leaves
enough time for it to connect with whatever you want to hit and if you
hit it you gain more score. You have 30 charges to hit various bits and
the highest score you get is shown on the main menu.

Yes that is all... not much fun huh? well honestly the lastability on this
game is pathetic. You play it for a few seconds and it seems ok, then
suddenly you realise there is no excitement to the game. The graphics
are quite nicely drawn and the music has been done to an acceptable
standard but other than that there isn't alot of praise I can give the
game.

Ok it is the authors first attempt at a game but I can't see what the
point to it is. The game has one level and the screen doesn't even clear
from the first time you played it so you are left with many sunk 
submarines below and dead fish, why on earth you would want to use a
bomb to hit a fish is beond me but oh well its the authors choice.

If you can be bothered entering the directory to play this game then
by all means do, otherwise i'd just leave it be.
