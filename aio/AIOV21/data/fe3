Well, it's 1999 and the millennium approaches. Will it bring the suicide
cults and and of the world or just a whole lot of partying?  Several web
sites have sprung up in answer to this question, a couple of which are
given here. As for the rest of the usual eclectic variety, just read on to
find out.

Lost In The Translation{p}

{p} {p}
A little humor to start things off with, this time derived from the
seemingly inevitable problems that arise when translating something from one
language to another. In this case from other languages into English.
{p} {p}
The examples given in this site are numerous and categorized, not to
mention rather amusing.  From signs (in hotels, street signs, posters), to
advertisements, product names ("Assglue"- a Chinese glue), food and menu
descriptions (from Nepal: "Fried friendship"), packaging, and film
subtitles with colloquialisms that don't translate too well ("I'll fire
aimlessly if you don't come out").  Several pages of hillarious
linguistic missteps wait here.

For those that really want to know the exact second when the millennium
arrives, just check out the provided link for the number of months, hours,
days, minutes, and seconds till the world goes boom.  Or if you tire of
that, enter in your own date that you want to count down to.

The History Net{p}

{p} {p}
The perfect place for the true history place, or those students that
don't want to go hunting around several libraries on foot to get enough
material for their research paper. History here is classified by category-
world history, the U.S. civil war, great battles, aviation and technology.
Add to that the nearly 500 articles on different periods of history
(categorized and searchable), historical interviews, accounts from
eye-witnesses, and information and links to a massive number of historical
magazines and this should be source material enough for anyone.  And if
that isn't enough, you can look up historical related travel sites to
plane your vacation around, or even look up what happened on the daily-
updated "what happened on this day in history" page.  Definitely
interesting reading.

The Smithsonian Institute{p}

{p} {p}
Another site to wet the appetites of the curious intellectual with no
Saturday-night social life, it shows just how massive the Smithsonian
really is.  With a map that gives the locations of the over a dozen
Smithsonian museums, as well as the research centers and shops (with
Smithsonian-related gift shops), there seems little parts of the
intellectual pie that the Smithsonian isn't into.  Events and activities,
special exhibits, and tours are listed for the convenience of those
planning their visits, and a long list of subject areas (from Aeronautics
to Zoology) allows one to connect up with links to sites hosted by the
Smithsonian that pertains to that subject.  From archives to institute
libraries, the available scholarly services are rounded out with a list
of available publications, catalogues, and productions.  It'll take some
real stamina to get through  everything this site has to offer.

Millennium Alliance{p}

{p} {p}
Well, this site has their own answer to what the new millennium will
bring, and that answer seems to be parties.  And lost of them!
{p} {p}
Every Year 2000 event around the world is given here, from major events,
to parties, special events, and just about anything with the name Y2K
attached to it.
{p} {p}
Take the Major Events section.  There's a North Pole to South Pole hike.
An international Internet conference, Earth Day 2000, and the World
Millennium Balls at 24 locations around the world.  And that's just to wet
the appetite.
{p} {p}
Parties and events can be searched for by several categories.  Pick a
Region, be it continent, region, or island grouping, or perhaps a Country
(in alphabetical order, and a LOT of them).  If you're looking for
something more local, then you can search by City, with parties listed for
a number of major cities all around the world.
{p} {p}
International or Synchronized activities are listed, be it global marches,
peace days, global telethons, and more from an unbelievable variety.
{p} {p}
The Special Events section is also rather fun to look at.  Pilgrimages,
leap year specials (yes, Y2K is a leap year as well), parties at places
like the Pyramid at Cheops, and others, giving you the impression that
humans are searching for just about any way possible to celebrate the
Millennium.
{p} {p}
Finally, the Mega events are not to be missed.  Times Square plans to
have a gathering of 1 million people, but California is not to be outdone,
organizing their own 2.5 million person event.  The Olympics of course
will be very special this time, but the place to be will be Greenwich.  It
has been designated as the official starting place of the Millennium
when the magic hour strikes.
{p} {p}
Still not satisfied?  Then finish off with enough links to Y2K resources
and events to keep you busy for several hours.
{p} {p}
Now if I can just decide which event I want to do...
