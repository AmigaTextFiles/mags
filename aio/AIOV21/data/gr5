Something different hit the Aminet this month, a spot the difference game.
You can guess the idea, but it is really hard to find those 10 differences
in 11 different pictures.

The pictures are practically identical, the only difference is that at 10
points on the picture on the right of your screen there is nothing, just
pick them out and you`ve done it; Game Over.

The graphics aren`t brilliant, they make the game look like it`s come from
the late 80`s, but at least they are better than any atempts I could make
if I were to atempt to draw something.

There are 11 pictures, and you can do them in any order. But after each
picture it is game over, it would be better if you score was passed on to
the next puzzle, and then onto a high score table when you finally give up.

You have the option to give up at any point during a puzzle, but when you
do it goes straight back to the title screen, without telling you which
differences you missed.
