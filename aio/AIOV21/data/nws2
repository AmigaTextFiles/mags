We had some trouble with our keyfile generator.... Some of our customer
should received wrong keyfile (The device said "This keyfile is not valid 
for this computer") We are really sorry about this and the wrong keyfile 
has already been replaced. If you have this trouble, please contact us.

Because we receive lots and lots of emails! (Thanks!! :-) we must put some
rules if you want to send us an email of more than 10Kb, please inform us 
one day before.

If not, your email will be deleted by our mail server...:-))

The serial device of the AteoSer and AteoIO card is buggy. If you use it
with a modem, you should loose the line or you should even not be able to 
take the line. It should be out soon :-)
