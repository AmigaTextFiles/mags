The author reckons that Tetris wasn`t invented, but it was discovered. Does
it really matter? Well, this is a 6 player version of Tetris. You play in
individual wells and the aim is to last longer than the other players.
There are some different game types which you can try, but really this is
just another Tetris simulation.

The graphics are satisfactory, instructions are in the game. I would have
prefered them in a text file, but oh well.
