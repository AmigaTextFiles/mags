I don't know about you, but I sometimes need the standard "info" command. It's
just a bit stupid, especially because it displays the sizes in blocks. This
is a replacement command, which promises not to cause deadlocks, and will show
the disk sizes in kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes, whichever is appropriate,
plus some extra info. Well, see for yourself; it's a lot clearer than the
original command, and you can even see the filesystem :)
