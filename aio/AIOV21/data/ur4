Here's another Aminet Readme-creator program. Now this is even usable! The
GUI is nice, and you can write the required & additional fields in their
logical places, and even select the directory (and edit the list of
directories, but maintaining it might be too boring so it'll probably just
be what it was by default :). The description editor itself just isn't
too comfortable; it's built in to the program, and you can't use your
favourite one :/ You also have to insert an extra empty line at the top of
the description (so it'll appear between the headers and the description),
because the program won't do it itself (even when it's required, IIRC).

I still think that writing readme-files is important and you should spend
some time doing it (and with a proper editor :), but if you really
can't / don't want to do it and you want an easy way out, then you could
try this utility. :)
