   Welcome back to AIO, last months issue was a bit hectic with all the
chaos of organizing the biggest and best issue of AIO ever and released
dates slipped etc so it all fell apart, but we managed to get the last
issue out even if it was 3 weeks late.. opps :( Due to all the things
going on last issue there was a mistake, the picture said that it was the
April issue where in the magazine itself it said it was the May issue,
due to AIO12 coming out so late it ended up being the May issue thus
skipping any April issue. So to clear it up there was no April issue.
 
   Well we are now here with the June issue which is on time, i've had
over a month to do this issue and it was a pleasant change giving me
plenty of time to do the issue and a bit of a break after 1 years solid
AIO production! It's back to its usual size again but with non of the
quality loss, still we are bringing you the latest reviews, news and
articles. This month we recieved Quake and Genetic species so look
out next month for full reviews of them both and them head-to-head to
see which comes out the better.

   Two sad losses this month, the first being the long running AIO utils
editor, Adrian Hendy, and the second being the newly employed Deputy
Editor, Paul Steadman. We now have both job places vacant and if you are
interested in being part of the fastest growing diskmag then please get
in touch with me the editor!

   With the summer rolling in AIO becomes harder to do with less time on
the computer because either it is to hot or i'm off sunning myself some
where, then there is always the World Cup which rules my life for a month
so i've been doing AIO at half times and any other spare time i can get.
Good luck to the England team!! Although all this has happend we have
survived a year and are planning to survive for many more years to come.

   No news breaking stories this month so the most exciting news is that
Genetic Species and Quake have both been released, until next month, ciao!

@{fg shine} The Amiga Community Liaison Group@{fg text}

The Amiga Community Liaison Group (ACLG) is a group being formed by
members of the ICOA, Team Amiga, and the Jay Miner Society, among
others, to help them keep in touch with each other and coordinate
their activities where this makes sense.  Our intention is to include
representatives from Amiga organisations all around the world in this.

The first two subjects considered by the ACLG have been the need for
an independent channel for Amiga news, and the question of how to
provide support for the ICOA User Representative to be elected in
June.

The first of these has been dealt with by the creation of the Amiga
News Feed.  This is a system by which Amiga news will be collected and
forwarded to Amiga magazines, news sites and other interested parties.
News items will not be edited, but must be attributed and limited in
length and format.  Amiga Inc and others have already arranged to send
out their news via the Amiga News Feed.  The News Feed will take the
form of a read-only mailing list.

The second question is under continued discussion.  The purpose of
having a User Rep is to keep developers in touch with the needs of
ordinary users.  Therefore we hope that those user group members and
magazine staff in daily contact with people who are doing useful
things with Amiga computers, but who aren't part of the online
community, will join these discussions within the ACLG.

@{fg shine} phase 5 and Haage & Partner Announce Cooperative Effort@{fg text}

May 18, 1998: In a joint anouncement after the recent World of Amiga show in
London, and as a reaction to the plans revealed by Amiga Inc., Haage &
Partner and phase 5 digital products have emphasized their full and
continued support for the PowerPC integration. With joint efforts both
vendors will further support the developers and the users of PowerPC
technology, and will ensure a fast growing number of stunning and powerful
applications. With many thousands of PowerUP boards beeing shipped so far, a
number of installed systems which is rapidly growing, the PowerUP boards
already provide an attractive market for all developers. This fact is
underscored by many upcoming PowerUP releases of major Amiga software
packages, and the increasing support of software vendors which has been
agreed on during the WoA even after the announcements of Amiga Inc.

Haage & Partner and phase 5 digital products emphasized that the competition
of their different approaches towards PowerPC integration, as well as the
public dispute about this, are a matter of the past. "We will ensure that
users of PowerUP system have a transparent integration of their PowerPC
software, and will see a rich variety of most powerful applications to be
released soon" say representatives of both companies. Further development of
PowerPC system software shall be done with close consultations between the
companies; beside that, cooperations in the development of powerful
PowerPC-based system libraries and other OS extensions are being discussed.

In meetings of the managements of Haage & Partner and phase 5 digital
products with Amiga Inc. already during the WoA show in London, it has been
agreed that a new proposal will be presented to Amiga Inc. which outlines an
alternative option to "Amiga Bridge" system planned by Amiga Inc.

This alternative is a new PowerPC-based system, which will feature the
planned Amiga OS upgrade and can be out for sale in the retail channels by
end of the year already. Beyond incorporating standard industry components
and interfaces, such a system can provide additional options which allow for
creative development and expansion in the spirit of the Amiga and can also
run the current and next releases of AmigaOS.

Based on the PowerPC, this system will also provide continuity and innovation
for all users and developers, and will allow the Amiga community to take
part of such stunning developments such as Motorola's new AltiVec
technology, an extension to the G4 PowerPC processors which will provide a
breathtaking performance already early next year. With approval and support
of Amiga Inc., this technology can introduce the long-awaited revival of the
Amiga platform already this year, quickly providing a growing market of
powerful systems which users can buy, and for which developers can develop
and sell software and add-ons.

Haage & Partner and phase 5 digital products also encourage all Amiga
developers who want to participate today in an existing innovation, and who
want to be a part of an Amiga market which provides growth, continuity and
innovation from now on and during the next years, to speak out now and
commit themselves to support the PowerPC as the heart of the next generation
of Amiga systems.

@{fg shine} Amiga Inc. Announces "KICKOFF THE FUTURE WITH AMIGA®"@{fg text}

Strategic direction and future plans include new software technology,
system availability and Web site

London, UK  May 15, 1998  Amiga Inc., a pioneer in multimedia
development, today announced plans to provide a new software architecture
that will offer enhanced levels of performance and useability for the Amiga
community.  Amiga will develop and license software technology that offers
leading multimedia solutions for the emerging digital convergence market.

"Amiga has the opportunity to move ahead of the industry in setting
standards to follow," said Jeff Schindler, general manager of Amiga,
Inc."By working closely with Amiga developers and user groups, we will all
have the opportunity to share in this exciting, emerging market."

To build upon Amiga's legacy as a multimedia leader, the company announced
Amiga OS 4.0 which is slated to launch in November of '98.    Amiga OS 4.0
will have a new user interface and support Amiga legacy software with an
integrated emulator.  Hardware developers are already working on solutions
for software and hardware backward compatibility with the new Amiga
architecture.

Amiga, Inc. also announced plans to unveil a personal computer that is an
industry standard architecture solution.  The new system will provide a
bridge to the next generation of Amiga technology.  The system is scheduled
for availability in November with a suggested retail price of  USD$999.
These systems will be available through Amiga International.

Also available soon, Amiga Inc. will host www.amiga.com, the official web
site for developer news, information, and relations.  Amiga International's
site,  www.amiga.de, will continue to be the location for Amiga
distributors and legacy product sales and licensing.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Frequently Asked Questions About Announcement at World of Amiga

Are you abandoning the Amiga?
No, we are focusing our efforts on the development of the next generation
architecture and operating system. We are working with third parties to
create an open architecture necessary to bring the Amiga back for the
future.

Isn't the new Amiga really just a PC with Amiga slapped into it?
While it is true that the next generation of Amiga will use the x.86
platform as a development system, this is meant to be used as a bridge to
take the Amiga to version 5.0. Amiga 5.0 is a brand new Amiga, using the
most evolutionary and revolutionary technology of software and hardware
architectures.

Why didn't you choose PowerPC for the next generation Amiga platform?
The Motorola roadmap does not match our vision for the future that we have
targeted for the Amiga. The Amiga Classic line will continue to support PPC
as an accelerator the current systems.

So do I just throw away all of my Amiga applications and start over?
No. The Amiga 4.0 will support most of your existing applications through
software emulation. We are working with another third party hardware vendor
to develop a hardware add-on (Amiga Classic Card) that will make the bridge
system backwards compatible.

Are you really abandoning the Amiga OS and licensing another OS?
We are NOT abandoning the Amiga OS. We are investigating the option of
leveraging a state of the art kernel of another OS to speed the development
process and decrease our time to market the next generations of the Amiga
OS.

Summary

We are focusing our energy on bringing the Amiga technology and the
community into the 21st century, ahead of the pack. We will target our
efforts on the operating system and an open architecture necessary to truly
be a leader in the multimedia, digital convergence marketplace.

 Just a brief intro this month, a quick happy birthday to the ed whose

you a belated birthday card, maybe not, too much money! [-ed OI]

 A big hello must go to Stephen Gadd who wrote me a very cheeky letter 
asking me to call his BBS, as I have no access to BBSes as I only have a 
school account which only lets us poor students use the WWW and the schools
E-Mail. If anybody reading lives in Cornwall or the surounding area, I 
doubt if Stephen would mind me giving out details:

      "The BBS is called tHE bINARY rEFINERY, and is open 2230 - 0600,
                Fri,Sat&Sun and the number is 01209 715095"

 I hope you get a few more users Stephen, until next month, enjoy the

@node "gr1" "Blob"

@{fg shine} Blob@{fg text}

 From the moment you load Blob you can tell your on to a winner, there is 
no fancy intro sequence, just a straight forward menu, but some how the 
author makes it look so good. You have a variety of options and then you go
onto the player selection screen. At this point find as many people as you 
can, get the family together, call your neighbours and friends round, and 
when you have 8 players plug in your 2-way joystick adaptor and click on 
go! [-ed but i thought you had no friends lee :)]

 Actually I was telling a lie, you don`t need 8 players, or a 2-way 
joystick adaptor to play this game, but the more players the better, if 
you have two players it is not that good and you can`t really get a 
playable game in. Three players is really the minimum, and if your 
wondering about a one player option, you can`t have one, you actually need 
friends to play this!

 When you eventually get into the game the first level loads which, I 
assume, is called "Yikes! Clouds!". All the players Blobs will now fall 
down from the sky, a while later when the 4 players huddled around the 
keyboard realise what colour they are you can start to play. The idea is 
to jump on one of the other Blobs, which in turn are trying to jump on you,
this is why you need quite a few players, when two of you are playing it is
really hard to jump on each other, and once on of the blobs is dead you 
can`t go for another one.

 If you have a few players playing at one time you could get bonus' by 
getting 3-in-a-row or a pant dropping 10-in-a-row`s, both acompanied with 
there own sounds. However, this is much harder in a team game because when 
you jump on your own player you`ve lost your only chance!

 Another great thing about this game is the sounds, you have to hear them 
to get the feel. The music is great too.

 As this is the shareware demo version of the game, you are limited to only
four levels of play, which are all really good and have their own good and 
bad points, the cost of the full game is 5 english pounds, a bit over 
priced if you ask me, you can get hold of commercial games for 2.25p if you
know where to look.

 All my friends really like this, and I would go as far to say, this is the
best P.D game ever, and i`m sure my friends would agree. All that is 
missing from this game is a decent one player option in which you can 
select as many computer players as you want. Oh well, can`t have 
everything, or can I?

@node "gr2" "Soap Star"

@{fg shine} Soap Star@{fg text}

 This is a game based on the classic arcade machine, Puzzle Bobble. Except 
this is based on Australian Soap Stars! Yes, its wierd, and the author 
thinks its funny firing mini heads around the arena and trying to match 
them together in order to burst them! Personally, I think its quite sad!

 At the end of the day the idea is simple, match 3 heads to burst them. 
Burst all the heads to progress to the next level. Something which is very 
hard!

 I really admire the author, what a good idea it is to distroy all 
Australian soap stars, but the way he has done it is not as good as the 
actual idea, if you get what I mean. I would prefer the soap stars to walk 
across the screen and alow we to kill them with the various weapons I 
would have.

 Anyway, the game, yes, umm, its bloody hard! The idea as a mentioned 
before is to burst the horrible Australian soap stars by matching three 
heads together, This is really hard, if I haven`t mentioned it before.

 You get a little `ball blaster' at the bottom of the arena and you fire by
pressing the FIRE button on your joystick/joypad etc. A head then pops out 
in a stupid direction and either bounces from side to side or just wacks 
into another head. If there are three heads to get they fall out of the 
arena along with any heads which are now not supported by another head. 
(Very complicated I know)

 The idea is there but the game just doesn`t play that well, its just too 
hard, I can`t even get past the first level, maybe i`m not that good, but 
believe me it is very hard, if your up for a challenge download this, if 
your in for a laugh don`t, you`ll be wasting your time.

@node "gr3" "A3dSim"

@{fg shine} ModelSim@{fg text}

 ModelSim is not really a game as there is nothing to do. "Whats the point 
of making a game where you don`t do anything?", I hear you ask, well, the 
game is just an extra in the archive. The point of this is to demonstrate 
how to use AMOS 3D to create a flight simulator, and having a brief look at
the source code which is included, it looks very hard to programme, but 
don`t worry, because there are loads of REM`s about!

 Well, the idea here, is to control a model plane around some landscape, 
thats it, its quite hard at first, but when you get used to the controls 
you`ll have that rush of speed which makes this simply brilliant.

 When you first boot up this game you are presented witha dull text-based 
title screen telling you the controls, once disk activity stops it tells 
you to press any key to play, doing that, you get to the playing screen, 
in front of you there is the background scenary which is quite good, its a 
bit dull, but it really adds to the `feel' of the game.
                                                                  .___.
 To control the power you must press on of the number keys or the | _ |
key, its best to just press the 0 key, as that is quite a nice    | - |
speed, although it is harder to control than, say 4, it lets you  +---+
get some speed up and perform some great stunts in the air.

 As I think its brilliant, I took it down to my friends to show him that 
there is still life in his Amiga, I showed him briefly how to move, and he 
thought it was crap, but when he had a go, he changed his mind instantly.

 This is a great game, its best to play it when your own your own, because 
when your friends are round they`ll fall asleep watching you.

[-ed I have also played this flight simulator and would like the author
to make it into a full blown game, maybe with enemy planes etc that you
can destroy. So if the authors reading please make it into a full game ]

@node "gr4" "Phaser Blast"

@{fg shine} Phaser Blast@{fg text}

 Phaser Blast is a remake of the Atari Classic Laser Blast. The idea is to 
destroy the tanks below before they destroy you, and it is easy.

 The graphics in this game are by far the worst i`ve seen, the tanks which 
roam about at the bottom of the screen don`t look a bit like tanks! But 
they say graphics are not the most important part of the game; the most 
important part is gameplay, but there isn`t much of that either!

 You`ve most proberly guessed that I hate this game, by now, but dispite 
that fact i`m really quite good at it (me showing off again). At the 
start of the game you get 3 space ship things which you can move about in 
an area about half the screen in size. Every now and again tanks come 
along and the idea is to fire your blue beam at them so they blow up and 
you get 30 points, sounds easy? Well, yes it is, but the tanks fire their 
red beams at you! They hardly ever fire straight up at you so look out!

 Every 1000 points you get you are rewarded with an extra ship/life, 
whatever, you don`t really need that many lives as you rarely die! 

 After you have played your first game you have the option to play again, 
if you are stupid enough to press Y then you`ll start another game, but this 
time you start with your previous score and you gain a few lives depending 
on how many points you got. Maybe a bug there Mr. Author????

 I hate this game, personally I think it is crap and it hasn`t been thought
through that well, but at least it is better than a number guessing game. 
If you were stupid enough to buy an Atari and actually liked this game you 
might want to get this, but if not, don`t waste your time!

@{fg shine} Artillerie Duell@{fg text}

 "Kanone ist klar zuw, Sir!" Have you got any idea what that says because 
I haven`t got a clue. It looks like German so I surpose this game is by a 
German person. Yes! I`m right! "ArtillerieDuell von Andreas Barth." Well, 
is that a German name?

 Anyway, you must have got the fact by now that this game is in German 
which is not much help to us English folks who want to play a good tanks 
game.

 The object of the game is to blow away your opponents tank which is on the
other side of the screen. The idea is simple and has been used many times 
before by other authors, but what Andreas takes pride apon is the fact that
both tanks can fire at the same time! Wow! Its amazing! Well, actually its 
not that amazing, but it really adds to the playablity.

 What I really like about this one is the graphics, they have been really 
thought through, although there not the best around when compaired to games
like Myst, they look really good. Take a look at the screenshot, it gives 
you a fair idea of what it is like, but unfortunatly it doesn`t show how 
the blue background gets lighter and lighter towards the bottom. (I think 
its called a RAINBOW to all you AMOS programmers out there)

 Overall I really like this game, but there is not much I can say in words,
if you can understand a bit of German it might help when reading the 
instructions and understanding the options!

@{fg shine} Complete solution to The Final Odyssey@{fg text}

 A few issues ago we featured the solution to level one of the Final

 Step on the pressure pad on the bottom right of the arena. Go back to the
left and take the bottom exit. Get on the one way path and collect the key
 there. Take the other path to the money and collect it. Leave by the left
                                   exit.

Take the transporter at the bottom left to collect the pickups in the bonus
 room. Return. Talk to Griffin who will give you a stopper. Go to the top
  and take the left exit. Make your way through the maze, taking care to
avoid rolling boulders. Collect the money at the top left of the arena and
return back to the previous arena where Griffin is, this time take the top
 exit. Get past the random arena by destroying all the monsters and taking
                           the exit at the top.

   Quickly go left to avoid the homing domes and drink the invincibility
potion. Destroy the domes, step on the pressure pad and the wall will open.
 Go through it. Use a bomb to destroy the cracked wall there. Walk through
 it. Blow up the other wall down the bottom right. You will see 9 pressure
   buttons on the ground here. You need to push 9 stone columns onto the
pressure buttons. Once they are all activated, the picture on the left hand
  side of the arena will unlock allowing you to reach the exit. Push each
    stone column through the middle gap in the wall and down. Cover the
  pressure buttons on the side first, leave the middle vertical row until
 last. This way you won't get trapped. Go back and push on the picture on
 the wall. The wall should now slide into the ground allowing you to take
                              the left exit.

 Push the stone column down and left so that it is sitting just behind the
 pit. Take the transporter into the room with the pressure pad. Step on it
 to make the wall disappear so you can push the stone column into the pit.
  Take the transporter. Push the 4 stone columns in this room so that the
  image on top of them fit together to form a square. Once the puzzle is
  joined together, the image formed is the path you must take in the next
 arena. Take the transporter back. Make your way up to the top left of the
 arena. Remember to collect all the money you can find along the way. Take
                              the left exit.

Go down and through the automatic doors. Here you will find a room full of
 tiles. Some will fall if you step on them, others won't. Follow the path
that you learnt from the previous arena, ie. start on the 2nd tile from the
left. Walk 2 down, 3 right, 3 down, 2 left, 1 up, 2 left and 3 down. Go to
          the top to collect the money and take the bottom exit.

 Collect all the items in this arena then go to the bottom right. Open the
iron gate with a key and take the bottom exit. The kings treasury. Destroy
all the cracked walls that stand between you and the treasure. Collect all
the money here (including the underground area). Your money bag should now
 be full. Take the right exit. Destroy the dome with the spinning spheres
  and collect the key it leaves behind. Go over and take the right exit.

 Give your money bag to Gorland who will give you an orb. The only way to
  get to the other side of this arena is by taking the stairs here, going
    underground and popping up on the other side. Once there, take the
transporter. You will be taken to a room full with more transporters, take
the bottom right one. Go to the top to collect the money there. Return back
to where Gorland is and take the left exit. Collect all the money here that
you couldn't collect before. Take the left exit into the kings treasury. If
 there's any money there to collect, get it. Take the right exit. Go down
 through the arch and open the door with a key. Leave via the bottom exit.

 Destroy the life stores to gain extra lives. Use an orb to free the girl
 from the prison. Take the bottom exit There is a combination switch here.
  Press the first and last switches. Go down and press the switch on the
 right. When the maze has transformed, step on the pressure pad at the top
  and return. The wall has now disappeared. Walk through it and press the
switch on the right hand side here. Take the bottom exit. Free the girl by
 walking through the tunnel and collect the money. Leave by the top exit.
     Press the switch again. Go up and to the left and take the bottom
transporter. Press the switch in the little room here and leave by the left
                                   exit.

 Collect the 2 keys in the chests and all the money. Take the bottom exit.
Go through the automatic doors and destroy the 2 damaged walls there. Move
the rock to the side then press the switch that was behind it. Collect all
the goodies. Your money bag should now be full again. Go back on a journey
 to visit Gorland and give him your money bag to get another orb. Once you
 have the orb, make your way back to where the first girl was imprisoned,
then take the bottom exit, then take the left exit in the next arena, then
take the exit at the top where you will find the 2nd imprisoned girl. Free
the girl and take her back to the tunnel to free her. Once free you will be
              transported back to the beginning of the level.

  Take the one-way path down to the bottom. There is another one-way path
along the bottom that you can't reach because there's a boulder in the way.
 Push it right. Get on this new path going right. Keep pushing forwards on
the joystick because you have to get off before you reach the end as there
 is a trap there. There are 3 one-way paths going upwards. Take the one on
the right and leave by the right exit. Destroy the homing domes and collect
   the key. Only open the door on the right. Go through it and push the
  boulder out of the way to reveal a switch. Push the switch. You can now
collect all the money here as the doors are all open. Go back and push the
       switch on the top right of the arena. Leave by the top exit.

Get through the random maze by destroying all the creatures and leaving by
the top exit. The trophy room. Smash all the mirrored spheres by using the
crossbow. Push the painting on the right hand side to make is disappear. Go
                  to the top and leave by the right exit.

 There are 2 boulders at the top. Push the left boulder down one. Push the
 right boulder 2 left and down into the first pit. Push the other boulder
 left and down into the 2nd pit. Go through the doors and collect all the
food. Use a bomb to destroy the cracked wall on the bottom right. Above the
 wall that you just destroyed is a boulder. Push this boulder down through
       the now open wall and into the pit. Leave by the bottom exit.

Go down and up through the flamers. Step on the pressure pad. The wall will
turn into a mirror. Walk through the mirror and take the transporter. Leave
 via the bottom exit. Destroy all the guards and make your way through the
                       maze to take the bottom exit.

 This one's fairly complex. There are 3 pressure pads below you. Walk down
over them and you will see the wall disappear and reappear. Walk back over
them so that the 2 walls separating you and the transporter are gone. Take
the transporter. Step on the pressure pad and return. Go up and step on the
pressure pad to open the wall and walk down to the spikes. Go down and step
over the pressure pad twice. You will now be able to reach the bottom exit.
If you want to get the bonus items, step on the pressure pad near the exit,
  go back to the 3 pressure pads where you started. The top one of the 3
  opens the wall at the top left of the arena. Go to the top left and you
will now be able to step on the pressure pad there. Once you've done that,
go back right where you'll now be able to walk below to the bottom pressure
pad. Step on it. A wall will disappear on the right. Go around and through
                         to collect the chain gun.

 Step on the 2 pressure pads here. You will now be able to collect the key
   above you as well as the food and chain gun at the top. Leave via the
 bottom exit. Go down to the 4 transporters. Take each transporter in turn
 and step on the pressure pads. Use a bomb to destroy the cracked wall on
 the far right. Go down to take the left exit. The guard room. Destroy the
 guards and take the left exit. Push the switch. Walk to the top and press
 the switch on the top wall. Walk down and step on the pressure pad. Press
 the same switch again. Push the switch just below that one and walk down
  and step on the other pressure pad. The 2 walls on the right should now
have vanished. Walk up and press the same switch again. Walk down and push
the first switch you used. You can walk up and press the switch at the top
      right. Step on the pressure pad and push the same switch again.

 Push the first switch you pressed when you arrived at the arena and walk
 through the maze to get to a new switch. Press it. Go right and press the
 other new switch there. Step on the 2 pressure pads to remove the 2 walls
 on the left. Return and walk through the 2 walls that are now open. Press
  the switch on the left of the arena. Use a bomb to destroy the damaged
 wall. Collect the bonus items, especially the kings key. Go back and take
   the right exit back to the guard room. Once there take the top exit.

You will see the gatekeeper on the right, (the green transparent creature).
Take the transporter to the top. Go to the right, step on the pressure pad
 and return. Use a bomb to kill the 2 guards protecting the gatekeeper as
they're very tough. Take the transporter into the gatekeepers room. Talk to
 Naga the gatekeeper and give him the kings ring. You can now take the top
 exit. Get through the random maze following the same procedure as usual.

 There is a combination switch here. Push the 2nd and 4th switches and the
 wall below will vanish. Take the one-way path and leave by the left exit.
Get the key and open the iron gate. Walk to the far left. A guard will now
be activated. As you can't reach the pressure pad above, you must make the
   guard step on it for you. Move right and the guard will come down the
one-way path. Move back left and he will step on the pressure pad. Quickly
             walk through the mirror and take the bottom exit.

 Destroy the mirrored spheres in this arena. Take the transporter. Blow up
  the damaged wall. Push the 2 boulders on to the pressure buttons on the
    floor. Push the other boulder into the pit above. Push one of the 2
boulders here on to the pressure plate at the top and return. There should
now be a mirror at the bottom left of the arena. Walk through it. Open the
   wall with the picture on it, (if it doesn't open you probably haven't
       destroyed all the mirrored spheres). Leave by the left exit.

    Go to the top and push the 3rd switch. Walk down left and take the
transporter. Stop the lava coming out of the minotaur's head by pushing the
stopper you have into its mouth. The lava will solidify. Walk down and push
 the switch. Take the bottom exit. Step on the pressure pad at the bottom
   right of the arena. Walk up and take the transporter. Step on all the
pressure pads. You can now go into the room with the flying arrows. Destroy
 the homing dome and collect the key it leaves behind. Open the iron gate
                         and take the bottom exit.

   Make your way to the left destroying all the creatures. Step on the 2
  pressure pads on the top left of the arena. Go back and take the right
exit. Destroy all the homing domes and collect the keys they leave behind.
 Leave via the right exit. Step on the first pressure pad you come across,
  twice. In this room with the rolling boulders, step on all the pressure
   pads except for the middle one. Go down and to the left. There are 2
 pressure pads here. Step on both of them. You should now be able to reach
                              the right exit.

 Push the boulder out of the way to reveal a key hole. Open all the doors.
 Go to the bottom and destroy the 2 damaged walls with bombs. Push one of
   the boulders on to the transporter. It will be transported to the one
  above. Push the boulder again to the right on the transporter there. Go
   back and take the transporter on the far left of the arena. Push the
 boulder 1 down, 1 right, and down into the pit. Repeat the same procedure
   with the boulder movement to get the other boulder on to the pressure
                                  plate.

Walk through the mirror at the lower right of the arena and take the bottom
exit. You have now finished level 2. Don't get a big head, there's still a
                              long way to go!


                                  @{b}Level 3@{ub}

Collect the nuke at the top left of the arena. Use the bomb to destroy the
 iron gate. Walk over the pressure pad twice to close the trap door. Leave
   by the bottom exit. Take the bottom transporter. Collect the key and
 return. Take the transporter in the middle of the arena and open the door
with the key. Go through the door and take the transporter there. Go up to
 the top where there is a red brick wall. One of the bricks is actually a
                             switch, push it.

Once the maze has transformed, go back down and take the transporter. Walk
down to the bottom where you will now have access to a new switch. Push the
 switch and a pressure pad will appear behind you, step on it and push the
 wall switch again. Walk up through the door and use the transporter there
   again. Walk up and push the switch again. Walk back down and take the
        transporter. You should now be able to take the right exit.

 Walk up through the automatic doors. There is a stone statue of a monster
 here. This statue can be moved around the maze. Push it 5 left, 2 down, 6
  right, 1 down, 4 right and down into the pit. You can now walk over the
  pit. Remember to collect all the money you come across on your journey.
   Walk down to the other stone statue. Push it 5 right and up onto the
transporter. Walk up to where the statue has been transported and push it 1
 right, 3 up, 4 left, 1 down, 4 right, and 6 down onto the pressure switch
on the floor. Now that the switch has been activated, you can open the iron
                    door and get out via the top exit.

Be careful of all the monsters in this arena. Collect the nuke and walk to
 the bottom left. Push the statue away from the iron gate and place a bomb
where the statue was to destroy the gate. Push the brick switch to activate
  the stairs. Go underground, collect all the money and key you will find
there and return. Move the stone statue 1 right to reveal a key hole behind
it. Open the hidden door using the key you just found. Take the right exit.

 Avoid the electric fields on the ground. Destroy the rotating balls that
  fire homing bolts at you. There are 2 keys in the chests above, collect
 them. Get the money in the underground level and return. Open the 2 doors
                         and take the right exit.

Go up and blow up the iron gate with a nuke. Go back down, walk past the 3
 wall flamers and take the transporter there into the room with a line of
      stone statues. The 5th statue can be moved, push it up onto the
transporter. Take the original transporter back. Take the transporter just
 above the one you're on into the little room with the blue pressure pad.
Move up onto the next transporter. You should be back in the room with the
   statue you just transported. Push this statue 2 right onto the other
 transporter. Take the left transporter back to the beginning. Where the 2
transporters are, take the top one to where the statue is now located. Push
 the statue 1 up onto the blue pressure pad. A secret door has been opened
 on the left. Go back and walk through the door that looks like a mirror.
                           Take the right exit.

 Walk through the automatic doors into the room with the presure pads in.
  Step on all the pressure pads except for the bottom right pressure pad.
Collect the money at the top. Push the stone statue on the left, down. You
  can now move right and push the other statue right to collect the money
  there. Push the 3rd statue down into the pit and take the bottom exit.
 Collect all the money in this arena. Walk through the automatic doors and
          destroy the girl in the machine. Take the bottom exit.

  Walk around to the top left of the arena to destroy the 2 girls in the
 machines. Go back and destroy the 3 iron gates with nukes. Talk to Scylla
  then take the left exit. There is a door with a key hole here, but you
  don't have a key. The door is a decoy. Push the stone statue 1 right to
  reveal a switch behind it. Push it. Go through the automatic doors and
destroy the homing spheres. Step on the pressure pad on the left and go to
 the top and press the wall switch. Destroy the homing spheres and step on
 the pressure pad on the left. Walk down and collect the bonus items. You
will see a set of stairs has appeared. Go underground and collect the money
             there. Return to the surface. Take the top exit.

 Walk to the top of the arena and talk to Ravana. There are 3 guards along
 the top that must be killed before the exit will open. Destroy the guards
and take the left exit. Be careful of all the stone statues in this arena.
Most of them come alive. Collect all the items at the bottom right and take
 the bottom exit. Make your way down the bottom. One of the statues won't
turn into a monster, push it 1 right to reveal a switch. Push it. Walk left
 and push the switch, then walk up and press the switch there. Walk to the
bottom left of the arena and press the switch to reveal the exit. Take it.

Destroy the 2 girls in machines in this arena. You will have to blow up the
  iron gate to get through. If you have been collecting all the money you
come across then your money bag should be full. Give it to Gorland who will
give you an orb in return. Take the bottom exit. Use the potions wisely as
 they're your only chance of survival. Take each transporter in turn going
 counter clockwise stepping on each pressure pad as you go. Then take the
                   transports to reach the bottom exit.

 In this arena you must push the stone statues on to the pressure switched
on the ground. Only when all switches are pushed down will the iron door be
  able to be opened. Push the statues on the left first so you don't trap
 yourself. In the bottom left room are 4 switches. Push a statue on to the
bottom switch first, then the right switch, then another statue on the left
 switch and another on the top switch. Push the last moveable stone statue
 on the floor switch near the transporter. You should now be able to open
the iron door. Take the transporter into the room with the homing spheres.
 Destroy them, collect all the items in the room and take the transporter
 back. Take the bottom transporter, open the door with the key, and leave
via the bottom exit. Collect all the coins in this arena then take the left
                                   exit.

Push the first stone statue you come across up into the pit and destroy the
gate with a nuke. Walk through the automatic door and push the stone statue
 down 1. Walk back around, destroy all girls in machines. Walk up through
 the 3 automatic doors to the stone statue again. Push the statue 3 right.
Walk back around so you can push the statue up 1 on to the pressure switch
on the floor. You should now be able to open the iron door and collect the
  key. Use the key to open the door into the bonus room. Collect all the
                       items and take the top exit.

Get on the one-way path. Keep moving to avoid the rolling boulder. You will
come across 3 paths heading downwards, you need to get on the middle path.
  Take the transporter you find there and take the top exit. Kill all the
 guards in the random arena and the top exit will open. Take the exit into
 the next arena. In this arena you will find heaps of one-way paths. Go to
the right where you will find a food bonus. Take the stairs and collect the
   money. Return to the surface. Walk to the top and take the left exit.

  Free the imprisoned girl with an orb and take the bottom exit. Take the
 transporter and use the stairs to go underground. Collect the money there
are return to the surface. Take the transporter back and destroy the 3 iron
gates with nukes. Collect the coins and take the bottom exit. Free the girl
  by taking her through the tunnel of light. Your money bag should now be
                         full. Take the top exit.

You need to make your way back to Gorland to get the last orb. Take the top
exit, then take the right exit. Take the top exit, then the right exit. You
should now be back to where Gorland is located. Get the last orb by giving
 him your full money bag. Walk back the way you came to get to the second
 girl. Free the girl using the orb and take her to the tunnel of light as
 before to free her. Return to the arena where Gorland is again. Take the
   left exit, followed by the next left exit. Walk through the automatic
 doors. Take the transporter and destroy the 2 girls in machines. Return.
  Walk up through the 3 circular doors and take the top exit. Destroy the
         girl here and take the exit back to where you came from.

Walk down again and around through the wall spikes. There is a combination
  switch here. Push in switches 1,3,4 and 6 to reverse the one-way paths,
allowing you to get through. Take the top exit. Get through the random maze
as per usual, by destroying the guards and taking the top exit. Walk up to
 the left of the electric floors, when the arrow reaches the top opening,
  push the stone statue right to trap the arrow allowing you to walk back
around over the electric floor tiles without being hit by the arrow. There
is a secret door in this arena. In the room with all the stone statues in,
   there are 3 along the very bottom. Push the middle statue 1 left and
upwards on to the blue pressure plate. The secret door has opened. Collect
        the key and open the other door with it. Take the top exit.

  Make your way through the maze being careful to avoid the boulders (use
potions wisely). You will find a switch at the top right of the arena. Push
it to transform the maze. Make your way into the middle of the arena where
you will find an amulet. Pick it up and go back and push the switch again.
 Go back as before and take the bottom exit. Now that you have the amulet,
  you need to return it to Ravana. To get back to him, take the exits as
 follows. Take the bottom exit, then the right exit, followed by the right
  exit. You should now be in the arena with Gorland in it. Take the right
exit, then the top exit, followed by the right exit. You should now be with
  Ravana. Give him the amulet and he will give you an iron rod in return.
                           Take the bottom exit.

 Press the wall switch, walk through the door, press the switch there and
take the right exit. Walk up to Scylla and talk to her. She should now give
    you the secret to the combination switch below. Push in the first 2
  switches and the last 2 switches. The man guarding the exit should now
 disappear. Take the exit. Push the switch. Take the transporter. Step on
  the pressure pad and return via the transporter. You can now get on the
one-way path. Press the switch at the end of the one-way path and take the
 bottom exit. Make your way through the maze destroying all the creatures
                         and take the bottom exit.

  Walk right. Step on the pressure pad being careful to avoid the arrows.
 Step on the transporter just below that. You should now be in a room full
of stone statues. The 5th statue can be moved. Push it 2 down, 1 right, and
  up on to the transporter. Take the transporter back. Walk up and around
 through the automatic doors. Walk down and take the transporter you will
 find at the bottom. You should now find yourself in a tiny room with the
transported statue just above you. Push it up on to the blue pressure pad.
Take the transporter the statue was sitting on. Walk up through the secret
 door and collect the key. Walk down and push the 2nd stone statue 2 up on
  to the transporter. Use the right transporter to get back to where you
  started. Push the stone statue you just transported 1 left, 3 up, and 8
 down into the pit, allowing you to walk over it. Use the transporter and
                            take the left exit.

 Get through the labyrinth destroying all the monsters. Take the top exit
into the random arena. Get past the random arena as per usual and take the
top exit. This is the arena with the Vortex in it. To get past the Vortex,
you must shove the iron bar you have in to the fan generator to destroy the
  computer. Take the top exit. This arena is full of fall-away tiles that
give way and fall after you've stepped on them. You can get trapped easily,
so take it slowly. Best to save the game before you try this, just in case.
               Once you make it through, take the left exit.

  Make your way through the maze collecting the nukes and take the bottom
 exit. Destroy the iron gates one by one using your nukes until you reach
                      the bottom exit. Take the exit.

Take the master exit at the bottom to reach level 4. Phew, that was a tough
                                   one!


                                  @{b}Level 4@{ub}

  Level 4 is more of a combat challenge than puzzle orientated. Take the
following exits to reach the end of level 4. The direction tells you which
  exit to take. ie. 'right' means take the right exit to the next arena.

 Take the bottom exit to the next arena. Go down and take the bottom exit
again. Go right. Up. Get through the random maze. Right. Down. Get the key
  in this arena. Go back up, left, down, and left. Take the bottom exit.
 Right. Open the fourth door with a key and collect all the keys you find
 there. Open the last door and take the right exit. Down. Go to the bottom
right of the arena, open the door with a key and take the right exit. Take
 the transporter to the secret room and open the door with a key. Take the
 transporter in this room and take the bottom exit. Right. Take the bottom
                             exit to level 5.


                                  @{b}Level 5@{ub}

Get the key and take the top exit. Up. Get through the random maze. Up. Up.
  Right. Down. Right. Down. Right. There is a section of the castle with
cracked walls. Blow it up with a bomb to get through. Up. Left. Up. Walk up
to the picture with a black monster on it and the wall will disappear. Take
the left exit. Up. Left. There is a food bonus here. Make sure you get the
potion first. Take the right exit. Up. Random maze. Walk through the walls
  and take the left exit. Left. Dodge the arrows and continue to the left
  exit. Down. There are a series of arenas here that look identical. Each
 time you take the bottom exit, it appears as if you are still in the same
arena. Keep going down until you find the key and return to the top. Right.
  Right. Open the door with the key and take the right exit. Down. Right.
 Down. Walk through the wall on the right. The wall next to the window can
 be pushed out and moved around. Push it and get the key in the next room.
  Open the door at the bottom and take the right exit. Up. Random. Left.

  Take the transporter into the room with the Minotaur. Dodge the rolling
rocks. Stay towards the back of the arena and fire at him from a distance.
If you get close he will throw fireballs at you. If you have some chaingun
 ammunition left us that as he's real tough. Don't move around too much as
 there are a large number of Goolyns around. Kill the Minotaur and you've
                            completed the game.

                                 The End!

@{fg shine} Solution to Level 3 of Uropa2@{fg text}

 As promissed last month after running the solution to Uropa2 level 1
and 2 here is the soltion to level 3.

                                   SPARK

You are in Base Aurora. First, make your way south to the supply room that
     contains numerous colonists hiding there. Walk back into the main
transporter room and wait for them to file in. Select the "StarShip" option
          on the transporter and wait for them to be transported.

Now, transport yourself to the first translink room. Search the box at the
back of the room to get a TED. Transport back to the main transporter, then
  west towards the first security room. Use the TED to blow the security
 door, then go in and access the security computer to get the access code
                       and also to unlock the doors.

Now, go north and enter the colonists room to the west of the first foyer,
 search the bed with the dead colonist on it and collect the credit card.
Now, go east then north and turn east after reaching the hydroponics room.
   Continue north and enter the room east of the next foyer. Destroy the
  Kapone here and pick up the weapon container it dropped. You now have a
                                   gun.

 Go west and pick up the hidden hologram projector on the north wall. You
 need to take out the Kapone commander to get a base card, so be careful.
 Once in the commanders room, search the bed to find an empty fuse. Travel
                  south, then west to find two colonists.

Make your way back to the first foyer north of the security room. Tell the
 colonists to stay there. Enter the security room to the east and then out
     the north exit. Travel until you get to the lockup and rescue the
 colonists. Travel back to the foyer and then to the main transporter and
                 transport the colonists to the starship.

Now, go to the supply room to the south and buy a 100amp fuse wire with the
  credit card. Now using the inventory window, drop the fuse wire on the
               empty fuse and you now have a complete fuse!

 Go west past the first security room until you reach the second security
 room. Enter the room to the south and destroy the Kapones and pick up the
  control key. Head back to the first security room and then south to the
T-junction. Enter the control room to the west. Read the number on the key
via the inventory and use that number to access the computers. Examine the
generator to find the power fault. Head east to the reactor room and insert
 the fuse into the generator. Head back to the control room and enable the
                                generator!

Note: There is an armory room to the east of the security room that is near
 the lockup. You should go back there after gaining credits and buy better
                        weaponry and/or ammunition.

@{fg shine} Games reviews and what there score means@{fg text}

 Games are reviewed mostly on playability and how long they will last
you, although some big games with fancy graphics might be expected to
get good reviews it is not always the case. A small 10k game might
get a better overall score than a 1Mb game. It is not that the 1Mb
game isn't any good it's just that the playablility might be non
exsistant and there is no point in downloading a huge file if it
will last a couple of minutes and you will only run it to show off
to friends.

 90%+    -  AIO GOLD (amazing)

 70-89%  -  Nice but some let downs

 50-69%  -  Not to good but it'll do

 30-49%  -  Hasn't really been thought out to well

 0-29%   -  POOR! AVOID!

 Amigaload is a program to display various things like your cpu power
and how much chip, fast mem you have left on an attractive looking wb
window. It has four meters for CPUload, Ready, Fast and Chip. Fast and
Chip are meters to show you how much memory you have left. CPUload is
to show how much of your CPU power is being used at that time, so if you
are running many applications then you will find that the meter is 
further over than if you were running less. I don't really know what
'Ready' does as i've scoured the whole document but can't find anything
relating to this but it obviously must be something useful!

 One of the best features of Amigaload is that you can connect up a
small circuit which plugs into the mouse/joystick ports and can have
real life flashing LEDs and LCD displays insted of the wb version,
of course you'd have to build the circuit but diagrams are supplied
so it shouldn't be to hard for you people who like to have a tinker with
the hardware.

 Overall a nice simple program that can do more than meets the eye, if
your interested in how much cpu is being used by various programs make
sure you download this either from aminet or www.hgs.se/~tl94hfl/

@{fg shine} REset@{fg text}

 REset is a very, very, very small program, the whole idea is just to
reset your computer, plain and simple thats it, no fancy options but
a nice and quick reset, you run the program and then it has a 5 second
count down before it resets, you can stop the reset by pressing ctrl+c
and it won't reset.

 The reason I like this program is many times when I have been running
AmIRC 2.0 and just reset it starts to quit AmIRC then resets so my HD
is invalidated, if it clicked this and then realised i could just quickly
press Ctrl+C to stop this happening.

 Although not a hugh complicated program at just 1,152k in size its worth
getting hold of as it could save you some HD invalidates and other
problems.

@{fg shine} c00ltext@{fg text}

 If you've ever seen writting where one letter is up and the next is
down and they continue on like this then you'll know what i'm on about.
This program does exactly that. It takes your normal text file and 
converts it into up and down text with other funny charictors thrown
in here and there. Its quite a good program but I can't see any real
use for it, why would you want your letters up and down so it makes
text harder to read? The main problem is there is no interface so you
have to use commands after running the program in a cli. This is not
the best possible way for this program as you need about 5 different
commands and if you get one wrong you've got to re-do the whole thing.

 Overall this gets the job done well but there isn't much point to
this type of program is there? if you need to do weird text or just
want your documents to look funny get this, otherwise you'd have no
real use for it.

@{fg shine} HyperAnsi@{fg text}

 HyperAnsi allows you to make your own, or colour your ansi drawings,
ansi is a form of ascii but with colour and for you that don't know
what ascii is it is basically text. Today ascii is ascii art and is what
you would call big letters, a bit below this review you can see an example
of ascii.

 Hyperansi gets the job done well although I have seen other programs
that allow you to use a paint option where as this doesn't so it can
become a little hard to design your asciis and take longer than other
programs of this kind on the market. The best thing about this is it
saves you so much time when you are colouring ansis in. If you've ever
used BBSes you'll know they contain many fancy coloured ansis and for
you that design them it is a real pain typing the colour escape codes in
by hand. With HyperAnsi you just select your colour and type away then
your ansi will be in whatever colour you selected.

 Here is an example of an ascii :-

   ___________    ________
   \_ _       \__/        \
    //   /    /  \   /    /
  _/       _//   /  /  _//
.-\____/____/ _//_______/---aMIGA iNFORMATION oNLINE---.
`---------/____/-gt^sy---------------------------------'

 It may not look exactly right but to see it properly load AIO issue 13
up into a text editor to see it. This was done by Gribbet of the group
Synaptic. It is a logo for AIO as you can probably see. It has no colour
but could easily be coloured in in HyperAnsi to look better.

 Overall HyperAnsi is very useful to colour in your text, it will save
you plenty of time but lacks some features of other similar programs.

 Utils are not marked on how good they are compared to other utils,
they are marked by usefulness and what purpose they serve. As there
are so many different utils that do so many different things it is
hard to review something like MUI and then when reviewing a program
like a WB clock say it wasn't up to the standard of MUI. This is why
it is not possible to have a Top Ten list for utils.

@node "fe1" "Telnet"

@{fg shine} Begginers guide to telnet@{fg text}

 Telnet is a system that allows you to connect to online terminal systems
while you are on the internet. You can log into shells, bbses and other
online text terminals, probably even some basic muds etc. For this article
I am going to focuss on the connection to bullitain board systems (BBS)
which if you've been a reader for a while you probably know i go on about
them alot so it is a subject of interest for me.
 
 One of the main benifits of telnet is allowing connection to bbses through
the internet, no doubt many of the regular bbs goers that are reading
dread when the phone bill arives as long distance calls to bbses can lift
up a hefty phone bill if you don't get free calls like some countrys. The
price of calling national or international bullitain boards is probably
one of the main causes to the dimise of bbses on a whole as the internet
is much cheaper with ISPs being at a local call or for USA or countrys like
that even a free call. While on the net either web pages, irc, ftp or
whatever you can connect to a bullitain board that maybe on the other
side of the world and you are still being charged a local call or whatever
it costs you to dial up the internet.

 The two main disadvantages are one that it is really slow and not even
half as fast if you called through dialup and the next is that the sysop
of the BBS either has to have an ISDN line to have 24hr connection or
the bbs will only be on telnet access at certain times to keep the sysops
phone bill down aswell. Telnet is alot slower than normal bbs access and
can become a pain but if you can put up with that you can really cut your
phone bill down by telnetting to your favourite boards insted of calling
them up via a terminal package etc.

 To get onto a telnet bbs you are obviously going to have to have internet
access, next you will need a telnet package, you can use normal terminal
packages like term, termite and ncomm but it will take some settings changes
and the results are never as good as a specificly programmed telnet
program. There are about 3 good telnet packages around, AmTerm, DCtelnet
and Virterm, for this article we are going to concentrate on DCtelnet which
is probably the best, you may be wary of using this as it is produced by
the group Digital Corruption and many comments have been made by Holger
Kruse about this being a backdoor program to allow Digital Corruption
members into your computer. I personally don't believe it is a backdooring
program as i have been using it for over 6 months with no problems at all
but if you don't want to use this software then that is up to you.
 
 Anyway, load up DCtelnet and goto the menu, it won't take any setting
up so you go into the menu option 'connection' once the menu has scrolled
down you will see connect, highlight it and let go. A small window will
pop up asking you to enter the ip of whatever, but in this case the 
BBS ip. If you don't know where to find the ip ask the sysop what it is
and he will give you a 4 sectioned code which will look like this but
with different numbers.

                       194.94.83.43

 Some sections of that code may contain 3 numbers insted of just two but
don't worry it is still the same. Enter that number into the box on
dctelnet and press return, it will begin to connect to the telnet bbs,
if there are no nodes free you will get the message

'There are no free units available to service your connection at this 
time.  Please try again later.'

 Otherwise you will connect and the BBS will come up, it is just the
same as a normal bbs but you will notice the speed difference, depending
on the time of day and where the BBS is located can effect the speed,
if you connect early morning to a BBS local to you it sometimes goes
the speed of a normal BBS but at othertimes it will be slow.

 I hope this has got a few of you into telnetting to BBSes but if you
need any more help or have any questions please forward them to

 @{b}22nd May 1998@{ub}

 Deimos Design, the development team responsible for the Amiga
PPC CDRom title 'Maim & Mangle' have come to the painstaking decision
to cease all development on the Amiga platform and move to the
PC-CDRom platform.

 Since early 97, Deimos Design has existed with one goal in mind, to
support the Amiga with high specification PPC products. Throughout
development of 'Maim & Mangle' many things have affected the fluidity,
but the overwhelming factor that prompted the change of platform was
the economic realities of the Amigas constantly eroding user base.

 Vulcan Software are also sad to see the disappearance of what promised
to be an awesome Amiga title but fully understand and support their
decision. Deimos Statement

 @{b}17th May 1998@{ub}

@node "fe3" "Blizzard 603e PowerBoard For Amiga 1200"

@{fg shine} Blizzard 603e PowerBoard For Amiga 1200@{fg text}

 * Product Name          : Blizzard 603e PowerBoard For A1200(T)

 * Model Tested          : Blizzard 603e/166 Mhz with 
                           68040/25 Mhz with FPU (No SCSI)

 * Company               : Phase5 Digital Products

 * Price Paid            : 400 USD

The Review Of Blizzard 603e/166:

 Blizzard 603e comes in a big box (2 times bigger than a Blizzard 1240/60
box).When you open the box, you can see Blizzard PPC in a anti-static 
cover, a English/German User Manual, a 880KB PowerUP System Floppy and 
PPC CD-ROM V2 which includes PPC Utilities, PPC Tools and PPC Demos.

 Unlike Blizzard 1240s or 1260s, Blizzard PPC has components and chips 
on its both faces. On one face Motorola PowerPC with a black cooler 
(which looks like a Pentium II)  and Motorola 68K is mounted,on the other
face there are two 72-pin Simm slots also the BVision 3D graphics card 
slot. The concept and the hardware design is really amazing.

 Blizzard PPC is upgradeable up to 128 MB Fast-RAM, fully autoconfigurating
and 2 Simms slots make memory upgrade easier. I`m using two 16 MB Edo-Simms 
which gives me 32MB fast ram. If I need it, I`ll replace one of the 16 
MBs with a 32MB simm and I`ll have 48MB fast memory.There are no jumpers 
on Blizzard PPC, everything is Plug And Play !.Also there`s a FlashRom on 
the board which stores the PPC startup software (ppc.library V45.16 ,e.t.c) 
which can be updated on demand by software.

 I`m using Blizzard PPC in my Micronik Infinity A1200T,but you can use 
Blizzard PPC with a desktop Amiga 1200. If you will use Blizzard PPC in a 
desktop A1200,you should leave the trap door open or cut a hole in plastic 
trap door and put a heat sink/cooling fan there. There are no heating 
problems in tower A1200 like mine.

 Blizzard PPC boards doesn`t work with standart A1200/A600 PSUs. 4,5 Amps 
for 5 Volts is needed for A1200 with a Blizzard PPC,but standart A1200 
PSU outputs only 3 Amps for 5 Volts.Old A500+ PSUs outputs 4.5 Amps,so 
you can use one of these. Of course best solution is buying a reinforced 
PSU (like Goliath,e.t.c) or buying a Power Tower/Micronik Infinity with
a strong PSU.

 Blizzard has 66 Mhz PowerPC bus.PPC cpu always uses this 66 Mhz bus. Also 
the Bvision slot which the reaches the PPC cpu directly is perfectly 
suitable for 2D/3D acceleration in graphic operation.

 As I said before there`s a flash-rom installed on the board. So the 
Blizzard 603e/+ is ready for use after power up.A special version of the 
RTG system Cybergraphics is supplied on PPC CD-ROM.Insert your PPC CD 
into your CD drive and open PHASE5/CGX3 drawer.Here you`ll find a file 
called CGX41_70.lha . Unpack the archive and install Cybergfx-PPC for 
AGA chipset.(P.S.:Visit [http://www.vgr.com/cybergfx] Official 
Cybergraphics Web Site for updates.) Cybergfx doesn`t speed up AGA chipset 
but it only emulates Cybergfx on AGA hardware. With this emulation 
you can play mpegs with ISIS 2.9 PPC player in a small window with 
dithered colors.

 By the way, I think that Blizzard Vision PPC is a must for any Blizzard 
PPC owner. AGA is good for some purposes, but it`s too old and too slow.
Blizzard Vision has a modern 2D/3D chip called Permedia2 which is 
manufactured by [http://www.3dlabs.com] 3D Labs. Permedia2 has all the 
features that you expect from a 3D card.Blizzard PPC will show its real 
power when BVision is released by Phase5. Phase5 will release BvisionPPC 
gfx card in June/July 1998.

 Below are the results of the tests I`ve done with Blizzard PPC/166 :

 * Candy Factory (Gfx Effect Software)..Effect Creation
PPC 603e/166 Mhz |  68040/25 Mhz
2.65 sec         |   53.30 sec

PPC 603e/166 Mhz |  68040/25 Mhz
0.5 sec          |  24.0 sec

 * Memory Access Benchmarks (With Phase5`s PPCMemTest Tool)

And here`s the list of currently avalible and forthcoming PPC Software :

 Available PPC Software

 * Doom II PPC - Game
 * Elastic Dreams PPC - Real Time Morph
 * Art Studio PPC - Image Catalog/Process
 * Burn-It 2.1 - CD-R Software
 * Wildfire 5 PPC - Animation Process
 * Reflections 4.2 PPC - Raytracer
 * Isis 2.9 PPC - Mpeg/VideoCD Player For SCSI CDs
 * PPC Mp3 Player - Mp3 Player
 * Amiga AMP V1.1 - Mp3 Player
 * Candy Factory PPC - Image Process
 * TurboPrint V6.02 - Printer Software

 Forthcoming PPC Software

 * Fusion PPC - Mac Emulator
 * PC-Task PPC - Wintel Emulator
 * Quake PPC - Game
 * Shadow Of The 3rd Moon 2 PPC - Game
 * Maim & Mangle PPC - Game
 * Explorer 2260 PPC - Game
 * Claws Of The Devil PPC - Game
 * Image FX 3.1 PPC - Image Processing
 * Tornado3D V2.0 PPC - Raytracer
 * Imagine 6.0 - Raytracer
 * Voyager 3.0 - Web Browser
 * Miami Deluxe - Internet TCP/IP
 * Aladdin4D 5.1 PPC - Raytracer

 A Blizzard PPC plus a Bvision PPC combo is a perfect upgrade solution 
for current A1200 owners who are stuck with AGA.With a PPC 603e/250 
plus 68060/50 you can buy a very fast card or you can buy a powerful
entry level PPC 603e/166 plus 68040/25 if you don`t have enough money.
I`m sure that Blizzard PPC boards will push the market forward until new 
Amigas like Pre/Box or Boxer 2 PPC are released in 1999.

 I won`t give any ratings,because Blizzard PPC isn`t comparable to any 
other accelerator board available in Amiga market.But I can say that it`s 
the best hardware development since the release of Amiga 1200.

 Final Words: Join The Amiga PPC Army !

Hello Amiga fan!!!

Thank you for a *very very* good AmigaGuide. But I have a little suggestion
about your guide. Why do you use Viewtek to display your nice jpglogo? Have 
you tested Fastjpeg? Its much smaller than VT (26 kb) and the most important,
it is much faster!

Thankyou for your letter Magnus and i'm pleased you like the mag... i use
Viewtek as it can be used to view the iff pictures that are in the mag
aswell as other picture formats like jpg, gif, etc. Although FastJpeg is
very good it is only limited to jpeg pictures and i won't unfortunally
be able to display other pictures types. I'll look further into this though
and thanks for your suggestion.
