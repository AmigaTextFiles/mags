Just a little preview of what may come from the new Amiga partner Tao
Group, this one concerning the proposed font engine to end up in the
next Amiga OS. So, in their own words, I present their announcement...

intentTM Font System For Tao's Digital Content Heaven
{p} {p}
More best of breed technology for networked digital appliances
exclusive to the intentTM brand

Reading, England, February 17th 2000.

The Tao Group has today provided further proof of its continuing
drive and success in making its intentTM digital content engine and
toolkit the very best the industry can offer in terms of quality,
footprint, performance, flexibility, and portability. This has come
in the form of the announcement of Tao's intent Font System. intent
is Tao's binary portable applications layer for networked digital
appliances, combining the most advanced technologies for an
integrated  JavaTM language, C and portable assembler environment.
intent also consolidates audio with both 2D and 3D graphics in one
complete package. It is available across most market leading
operating systems and almost the complete range of major processor
families for consumer products.

Tao had already revealed details of its own 2D drawing, windowing,
compositing and gadget libraries, the integration of Criterion's
RenderWare® 3D solution and the SSEYOTM KoanTM audio engine as part
of the intent digital content platform. As reported last month,
Francis Charig, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Tao told
analysts, "intent is so named because we are putting together the
leading multimedia technologies for the creation of compelling
interactive content. In spite of strong demand there has been an
industry vacuum in this area, that intent is now filling."
{p} {p}
Tao has now released the details of the intent font system, which Tao
executives believe will further position its software as the standard
content foundation for networked digital appliances.
{p} {p}
The Font System consists of three layers: glyph caching technology,
vector rendering engine and format decoder plug-ins. It has achieved
an impressive roll-call of objectives: including having a low memory
footprint, high performance, and high readability. It is customer
extendable, the system has flexible configuration options and it is
fully platform independent.
{p} {p}
Plug-ins include TrueType®, PostScript® Type 1, Windows® Resource
Fonts and ROM Fonts with additional plug-in options to follow.
{p} {p}
Features include 1 bit, 4 bit or 8 bit anti-aliasing, on-the-fly
gamma correction, configurable cache memory, configurable font name
mapping, PanoseTM matching, Micro-spaced printing, co-existing
plug-ins, and it has a typical footprint of 50KB.
{p} {p}
The font engine enables high quality rendering, with on-screen easy
readability, even on low-end consumer devices and yet can scale up to
the highest quality DTP typographical requirements.
{p} {p}
The font system is an essential component of the development kit to
be announced shortly by Tao and its partners. Further announcements
of world class tools for the intent engine will be made shortly.
