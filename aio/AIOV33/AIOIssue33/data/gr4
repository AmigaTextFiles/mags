Ever wondered what happens to your brain when you just CAN'T work it
out?!?! Well, now your going to find out!
{p} {p}
MadMatrix is a game weighing in at just under 8K. It can run on any
Amiga with KS2+ and requires only 30kb of disk space for full distribution.
It was programmed in assembler by a clever French bloke and uses MUI3+.

In this game you are given a square between 2x2 to 4x4. Each block of
the square is then given a number from 1 to 2x2, 3x3 or 4x4. You then
tell the program to 'Shuffle' and it changes the order of the numbers by
rotating several blocks of 2x2 either anti-clockwise or clockwise. It is
then your job to put the numbers back in the correct order by your own
use of rotating blocks of 2x2 either anti-clockwise or clockwise. E.g
{p} {p}
1 2 3{p}
4 5 6{p}
7 8 9
{p} {p}
I could turn the first 2x2 block clockwise to make it look like;
{p} {p}
4 1 3{p}
5 2 6{p}
7 8 9
{p} {p}
and then the bottom right hand corner of 2x2 anti-clockwise;
{p} {p}
4 1 3{p}
5 6 9{p}
7 2 8

Thats it. Theres no special graphics, no music or sfx. Just the
documentation in AmigaGuide - which can be read in French or English -
and the program!

Whether you like this game or not will depend on your desire for a
mental challenge. You might not like it tonight, but my be itching for a
good old brain strain tommorow afternoon! - It will probably be a game
you come back to time and time again when you can't be bothered to watch
TV!
