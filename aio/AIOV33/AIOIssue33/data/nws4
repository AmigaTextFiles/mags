Met@box have released some information about the release dates of their G3
accelerators.  The A1200 cards will be released first, followed a month
later by the version for the A3000(T) and A4000(T) CPU slot.  Another three
weeks later the version for the A2000 will be released.

The Met@box G3 cards feature the Motorola or IBM G3 PowerPC processors and
use the popular 168pin SDRAM memory modules.  They will be unique in
emulating the 680x0 part of the Amiga rather than using a dual processing
system like the Phase5 PowerUP series.
