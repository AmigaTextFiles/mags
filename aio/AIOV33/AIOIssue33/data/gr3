Well, in comes the second Space Invaders clone of the issue.
{p} {p}
The game has now been released with its source code (included in the
archive) and is programmed in Blitz 2.
{p} {p}
When starting up the game you are greeted by a fairly colourful Main
Menu screen with one option (Fire - to play). The first thing you
MIGHT notice is a bit of screen corruption which occurs seemingly at
random - I have been unable to find what it clash's with, but its almost
definetly software.
{p} {p}
After pressing FIRE to start the game you are presented with what
appears to be a promising game. You get a funky ship, and a couple of
cool lasers to boot. The first set of enemy's come streaming in after
only a couple of seconds, alas, in a hugely predictable pattern. The
graphics arn't bad at this point though and there's no complaint with
the sound - which consists of over-used laser sfx, explosions (of which
i believe their are two types) and the enemy's 'bob' when they shoot at
you.
{p} {p}
The second and third wave of enemy ships approach, and already you begin
to feel the huge letdown of the game. There is no apparent change to the
gameplay and you simply fight wave after wave of pattern movement ships.
{p} {p}
There is one nifty feature to save the game from complete disgrace -
your shield energy. You are provided with a shield stregth of 20 points.
Being hit by the ammo of different ships takes off various amounts of
energy, but its usually 3 or 4 units. On my various adventures through
the game I found no weapon or shield upgrades, although I didn't progress
much further than the seventh wave of enemy ships due to complete lack
of actually WANTING to go any further.
{p} {p}
I may have been a bit harsh in this review, but there is really nothing
to report. You'll either love it for its genre, play it because it poses
as quite a challenge, or just delete it.
