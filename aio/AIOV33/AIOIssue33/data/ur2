MpegClean-r is a program to clean up Mpeg audio files.
{p} {p}
There is no installation at all required, just copy it wherever you might want
to have it!
{p} {p}
The usage is also real simple, it's a CLI only tool (why make a GUI for this small
utl?), and you just have to supply the input and output file and it will remove
the unwanted parts in the beginning of the mpeg audio file.

I guess you now think, what is he halking about?, unwanted parts, what's that!
Well, I'll explain, there is two different kind of unwanted parts, first, and
the main reason this was written (I assume), is that it will remove the
ID3-ReadOnly tag so you can alter the ID3 tags again.
Another kind of unwanted part is if you hear a beep or something else right in
the beginning that doesn't belong there.

The speed is NOT impressing, a 8.5MB mp3 took more than 2 minutes to do. It's a
good thing this program isn't needed that often :)

There is a small readme, nothing fancy, but it'll do.
