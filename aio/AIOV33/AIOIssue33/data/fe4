Dellert of DCE regarding the question of Phase 5, wherein he assures
everyone that their supply of product will not be interrupted. But
don't take my word for it, following is the interview in it's
entirety...

These are excellent news! Will DCE take over repaire services for
those products, too?
{p} {p}
Thomas Dellert:{p}
DCE will take over repair services for those products. So, owners of
elder boards don't have to worry about that.
{p} {p}
amiga news:{p}
Will the licences and the availability of Phase5 products be impaired
or even endangered by Phase5's application for insolvency?
{p} {p}
Thomas Dellert:{p}
We've obtained exclusive rights for these products in April 1999
allready. We are not paying any licence fee to P5. Rather than this
we obtained the licences by a single payment. There are
unobjectionable contracts. The availability of the products is
secure.
{p} {p}
amiga news:{p}
Will there be further software updates relating phase5 products? Are
you allready in contact about this with Ralph Schmitdt?
{p} {p}
Thomas Dellert:{p}
A good an very important question, Petra. Yes, I had a meeting with
Ralph Schmidt and Frank Mariak two days ago. We have come to terms
that in the future we will cooperate very close. There will be a FTP
server on oure homepage, where device updates will be found for
download.
{p} {p}
amiga-news.de:{p}
Are there any plans for new developments based upon Phase5's products?
{p} {p}
Thomas Dellert:{p}
For sure existing hardware will be produced at first. There are a lot
of preorders. Since Permedia II chips have been announced by TI, we
probable will be able to produce only a number of 1200 BVision or
CV-PPC boards. Hence we are thinking about a Permedia III board for
Amiga. This might be mounted upon the existing BVision or CV-PPC
platform. Frank Mariak will develope the software for us. With the
entire amount of technical know-how of Phase5 we now have a powerful
package at our disposal. In any case there will be activities
relating PPC. For the time being as a dual CPU resolution only.
{p} {p}
amiga-news.de:{p}
In particular: Will there be a Phase5 G4 board from DCE, and will
there be pay regard to prepayments Phase5 allready recieved relating
those boards? Or will there be hardware at cheaper prices, similar to
Stefan Ossowski's Schatztruhe offering to all those Euromail harmed
people AminetCDs at a price of DM 5 or bricks?
{p} {p}
Thomas Dellert:{p}
Relating that I allready met with Wolf Dietrich. Indeed at this time
I cannot tell, if we will decide for a G4 project.
{p} {p}
amiga-news.de:{p}
Do DCE have access to hardware of Phase5' customers, which lies at
Phase5's for repair at this time?
{p} {p}
Thomas Dellert:{p}
No, we haven't.
{p} {p}
amiga-news.de:{p}
Thomas, thank you very much for your informativ answers. We are
pacifyed and pleased that production will contiue, and that customers
who have Phase5 products will be able to take up a competent service
for repair at DCE.
