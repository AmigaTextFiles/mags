{subhead} Phase 5 are dead!{def}

{p} {p}

A bit of shock news: phase 5, designers and producers of Amiga
accelerator and graphics cards for many years has announced bankruptcy.
While this means that the fate of their G4 accelerators is in doubt, there
is no need to worry about the availability and support of the PowerUP 603
and 604 cards, and the existing 680x0 range.  DCE, {link http://www.dcecom.de/}http://www.dcecom.de/{end} ,
have exclusive and unaffected licenses to build these cards.

Although the reasons for phase 5 going out of business are not clear yet
(apart from the fact that they went bankrupt..) it's speculated that
Motorola's inability to ship the G4 processors which phase 5 have required
since October 1999 have certainly contributed.

Is there any good news in this?  Perhaps: the 'kernal war' between phase
5's PowerUp and Haage&Partner's WarpOS can now be said to be over.  Also,
the rather odd plans to run a QNX OS, rather than AmigaOS, on the G4
accelerators can be forgotten as a bad idea.
