Just a note for all you 3.5 users. If you haven't seen it on Aminet yet, 
there is an unofficial FAQ reguarding 3.5 that covers quite a few 
questions.  Its too big tro reprint here, so I'll simply tell you about 
it and recommend that you download it now. It just might prove useful

You'll find it on aminet under docs/help/OS35FAQ.txt

It's the second edition of the file so it does get updated. You'll 
probably want to keep an eye out for any future updates.
