TCPScanner is a program to scan what ports a computer have open...
{p} {p}
No installation, just run it from CLI only!
{p} {p}
Not very much to say here, you select a host and some ports and begins scanning.
It will then report which of them was open!

If supplying -s switch it will switch the most common services ports. It also
has a few other switches, like -V for more output etc...

It's a very slow portscanner, takes ages atleast on my modem.
{p} {p}
The documentation is a poor 1kb ascii file, but that's all that's needed...

Okay, don't think that this is all illegal, because it's not (in all cases :) ).
It's perfectly legal if you scan yourself to see if you have set the IP filters
in Miami correctly, and when used on other computers, the correspondant countries
laws apply, so take care...
