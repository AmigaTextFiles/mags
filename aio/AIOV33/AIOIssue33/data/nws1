3.2.2000 amiga-news.de now with Amiga Link Directory (ALD)
{p} {p}
amiga-news.de opened the new Amiga Link Directory (ALD) for the public on 23.1.2000.
The new directory's aim is to become THE directory for AMIGA-pages. Innovative
({link http://www.innovative-web.de}http://www.innovative-web.de{end}), a software-company based in Herzogenaurach/Germany
developed the required technology for this exciting enterprise.

Entries are sorted by categories and letters or can be found easily via the available
search-function. In order to guarantee an always up-to-date database, entries can be
changed by the "owners" of the entry at any time via a previously defined password.
For every entry, if provided by the "owner", further information is available. This
can include, but is not limited to the postal address as well as the phone-number,
email-adress and homepage.
{p} {p}
The ALD will also partially (means: only entries of "owners" who want their entries
to be part of a "directory" on the Aminet-CD) be available via the popular Aminet-CDs.
For the first time there will be a bridge between the AMIGA-online and -offline-world -
and it will be called ALD. This way communication within the AMIGA-community will
improve and companies can also reach users, that don`t have an internet-connection yet.

Help us building the greatest online-directory for AMIGA-websites worldwide and
add your website today.
