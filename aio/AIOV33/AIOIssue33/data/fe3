Everyone the world over knows of Disneyland, so this site is truly an
international draw. Focusing on the rides and attractions of years past,
it's a fun anfd informative view of Disneyland past.
{p} {p}
You can browse descriptions and facts of rides now gone, sorted out by
the given Land section they were in. The Astro-jets in Tomorrowland,
the Mike Fink Keel Boats in frontierland, or the recently evicted Swiss
Family Treehouse in Adventureland. There are pictures and complete descriptions of
each of these attractions, and the dates of their operations.
{p} {p}
Various memories of Disneyland are given in the form of submitted
articles from people that grew up or worked there, giving unique
perspectives of some of the inner workings of the Magic Kingdom. Views
of early Disneyland or articles from people who witnessed such momentus
events as the very last electrical Parade. Even a history of how the
ticket system evolved.
{p} {p}
Finally, you can see what might be destined for the yesterland pile,
attractions that have either just been closed or are rumored to be near
to getting the axe.
{p} {p}
This is a site good both for reliving past memories of the Disneyland of
your childhood, or for those that were never there for any of it to see
how the park has evolved. I found many good memories of my childhood
flashing back, perhaps you'll find this site as enjoyable. If nothing
else, you over-seas people can see what all the fuss is about.
