Well, this month a couple things on Hard Drives, mainly because I've 
just got a new one myself and have been putting myself through several 
painful experiences getting it to behave.

Firat a bit of background.  I use the MultiFileSystem, and as such have
my old Format command patched in with the one sup-plied by MFS.  When
the new Format command came in with OS3.5, I decided to leave that
version unpatched because I wasn't sure if it would work with the new
Format.  As such, I use the old patched Format as default for my 
floppies but keep the new Format around just in case.

With that in mind, I found out something when using the new HDToolbox 
with the Old Format- it really messes things up. Several reboots and 
various attempts later, I can say, if you're using OS3.5, then use the
new HDToolbox with the NEW Format.  You'll save yourself a lot of pain 
that way.

Also, something I found out when trying to rearrange my hard drives.  
Shapeshifter doesn't seem to see my MAC partition anymore from the MAc 
side. Nor does the Mac side seem able to propperly boot from a Mac
System Disk.  I don't know the reason for this, but if anyone knows the 
answer, or if you'rew having the same problem, then write in and the
answer will be posted here.
