SimpleFind is a search tool... Ie, it will search your HD for files!
{p} {p}
Installation is real simple, it's done with a normal C= install script, no hassle,
no pain!
{p} {p}
First you might want to configure SimpleFind, it's no real need of it though, because
the defaults are very good... But just to see how extensively you can configure it, I
will tell you a little about it...
{p} {p}
First of all you can, of course, configure some directories and programs, like your
favourite viewer, the archiver of choice etc... But there is also some very neat
things there, like adding/removing buttons, adding a popupmenu, and the entries there
and also you can add a extra menu.
{p} {p}
When started, you will see a MUI window, containing alot of different options!
{p} {p}
First you must select on which device to search, of course. And then the word to
search for, okay, this is very basic you think, so what other neat stuff does it
have you think. Since they are quite many, I will just mention them very fast:
Max directory depth, Search in name, Search in Comment, Minimum size of the files,
maximum size of the files, within last days/weeks/months/etc, between two dates,
the protection bits, the datatype, the contents and a compare mode.
{p} {p}
So if that ain't enough for you, then nothing is!
{p} {p}
It's very fast in searching, even though it doesn't use indexes. One bad thing though
upon searching is that it will give a few CyberGuard hits right before it starts
searching.
{p} {p}
During the search it will update the list of files in a window, which you can browse
through, and when it's ready, there you go, the file(s) is found and listed with all
the information about them as possible.
{p} {p}
But this is not all, did you remember that you could create buttons and menus? This is
where you will have use for them, the default buttons let's you do the following:
Information, Copy, Delete, Show, Archive and Unpack.
{p} {p}
This program is also localized, and it comes with 8 different languages, the docs
comes in 5.
{p} {p}
It also has a ARexx port, which I think all Amiga programs should have, yes even
something as simple as a calculator or something. :) It's quite big, and you can
do qutie a few things with it... It also comes with a few scripts that also could
be of use for you.
{p} {p}
The documentation is VERY well organized, it covers all possible things you might
want to know, although it's very brief when it describes some buttons etc, but
that's because that's all that's needed.
