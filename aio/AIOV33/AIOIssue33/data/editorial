Welcome the loyal readers I have come to know and depend on. What
am I talking about? Well this issue will sadly be the last that
I am in charge of. From issue 34 onwards your new full time Editor
will be the current Articles Editor, Mark A. Tierno.
{p} {p}
You may be wondering why i'm leaving a production I started nearly
3 years ago, so i'll explain. The reason is not that I am leaving
the Amiga so please don't think that because I will continue to
be 100% Amiga. The main reason I am handing over the running of
the magazine is the fact that I think my work has become stale and
I don't seem to have the motorvation that I once had to write articles,
reviews and genrally run the magazine. Thats not to say I've stopped
loving the work I do because the feed back I have gotten over the
years and the contacts and people you get to know are a big plus
and something I will seriously miss.
{p} {p}
Although I will miss alot about the magazine I think it needs a
new way of running and I think my personal way of doing things has
brought it to a point where I personally can't improve what we
have. With the new Editor I hope the magazine can expand further
and become more popular than it currently is because overall I want
to best for the magazine I started and I feel I cannot offer what
the magazine requires.
{p} {p}
I am still going to be contributing to the magazine as regularly
as possible, this will allow me to write articles and reviews
on my own terms and in my own time. No deadline dates will force
me to write something and so I hope I can create and work on some
articles that you will enjoy.
{p} {p}
Unfortunally when Editors of some of the more main stream magazines
claim they are leaving but will still support the Amiga they suddenly
disappear only to one day resurface on a PC magazine or other type
of computer than the Amiga. This is something I will not be doing as
the Amiga has been my computer of choice for 10 years and is something
I am not about to just leave, so please believe me when I tell you I
will still be actively supporting our computer.
{p} {p}
You may not hear my name for a while as I take some time to think
about new ideas and other projects I could start but I will be helping
slightly with the running of AIO until Mark has a full hold of the
way things work. I'm sure it won't take him long but still expect to
see my name on the sidelines of AIO with contributions when I can.
{p} {p}
I hope you give your support to the new Editor and help him continue
the magazine that many people enjoy to read. The new ideas will all
depend on what route he decides to take and if you have any ideas you
would like to see in this new period it would be a good idea to let
him know. Some decisions you may not like, some you may want but they
are not carried out, but in the end support him and the rest of the
editorial team so we can see AIO rise to the top.
{p} {p}
It has been my greatest pleasure to run this magazine with a reader
base like yourself, I would like to thank anyone that has ever helped
with the magazine or written to me about it, you can read the list
of people I would like to thank in this months articles section. I
would also like to say a big thankyou to the loyal readers who have
been reading from the first issue like a religion and all our new
and future readers for making this cause worthwhile.
{p} {p}
The last article about me will be in the next issue so for that article
I would like you to send in your Goodbye messages to me, if you want
to say anything or just want to say goodbye to me then please send those
to;
{p} {p}
{bold}goodbye@aio.co.uk{nobold}
{p} {p}
These letters will be printed next issue. I would still like to keep
in contact with people so in future you can contact me at either
of these email addresses.
{p} {p}
amiga@fdn.co.uk{p}
chris@aio.co.uk
{p} {p}
I am now Amiga 'jobless' so to speak, if someone has a project that
they would like help with then I'm open to your suggestions and offers,
let me know at either of those addresses above.
{p} {p}
So with a tear in my eye, for the last time I must say thankyou and
goodbye.
