DirScanner is a search tool... Ie, it will search your HD for files!
{p} {p}
There is no need to install DirScanner, just run it...
{p} {p}
When you start DirScanner you will see a MUI interface appear, it's not
complicated at all... There is way of configurating anything, so you can't
change to your favourite viewer, it will use Multiview to show files.
{p} {p}
You can search in the following things: Name, Size, Comment and Date.
And the different conditions is: Equal, Unequal, Less and More.
{p} {p}
When searching, just type it in, add one or more paths, and press search,
it will then search and add the results to a list.
{p} {p}
The only things you can do with the files that it found is: View (only files
which you have a datatype for), Path->Clip (very handy function indeed) and
Copy to...
{p} {p}
This program isn't intended to be as configurable or as many options as
SimpleFind3 (as stated in the docs), but it does a great job...
{p} {p}
The only trouble I have had with it was when I tried to search for #?s#? on two
of my big partitions, after a while it threw out CyberGuard hits and crashed,
I guess I wasn't specific enough for my amount of memory or something :)
{p} {p}
It's localized, and comes with two languages (three with english)...
{p} {p}
The documentation is in english only, and is very short, but since this search
tool was written with ease of use in mind, the documentation isn't needed at all,
the program is so easy to use.
