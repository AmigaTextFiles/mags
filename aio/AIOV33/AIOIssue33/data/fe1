Over the years there have been a great number of people who in
some way have contributed to the cause of AIO. Some of these
people have just done minor things, like a small program has
been used of theirs and some where vital to how AIO has turned
out at this stage and probably could not have survived without.
{p} {p}
This magazine will have soon enough been running three whole
years and over that time many people I have forgotten about
and unfortunally some who have put hard work into the dream
of AIO which I thought up in April 1997 and finally started in
May 1997 will not be mentioned. If you are not mentioned and
you have previously or recently worked on AIO then please
except my greatest regrets.
{p} {p}
My main gratitude goes out the the current and previous
editor base who without I would not have been able to continue
the AIO dream. Thankyou very much!
{p} {p}
I would now like to thank from the bottom of my heart these
following people who have shaped and brought you AIO up to this
point :-
