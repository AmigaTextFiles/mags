Well, its another Space Invaders clone - but one with a few twists.
{p} {p}
You have to control your ship horizontally across the bottom of the
screen and shoot the badies flying overhead. The badies don't fly in
formation which makes the game just that little bit harder than you
would expect. The enemy ships also fire alot more regularly than on any
other Space Invaders clone I've ever seen - which again, makes for
interesting and difficult gameplay.
{p} {p}
The real corkscrew is the LIMITED ammo feature. You are given 70 (what
the programmer calls) rockets to start off with. Once you run out of
these, the game is paused and you are given the option to use one of the
three 'sub' games to earn back some rockets. Alternatively, you are
sometimes lucky enough for extra life's and extra ammo to drop from the
heavens and its your responsibility to catch them before they drop off
the screen.
{p} {p}
The three sub levels are called Siezure, Elusion and Brod Pinball.
Strangely enough Siezure and Elusion end up being the same game,
although the docs give the impression they are two different games.
{p} {p}
Anyway, Pinball is by far the more enjoyable game. You bassically have
to keep the call in the 'play' area using the left and right ALT keys to
control a couple of flippers. The ball bounces off targets collecting
your points, which then turn into rockets when you re-enter the main
game. The logic of the ball is programmed very well, and I dare say
there is little difference between the logic of this game and the logic
of the commercial Pinbal Illusions and the such. Because the game as no
scrolling screen the whole play area is of strange dimensions, but
surprisingly you have little trouble getting the ball into various parts
of the screen despite the insane wideness of it all.
{p} {p}
The Siezure/Elusion game is not documented any further than saying that
you use the joystick for it. In this game you are your usual ship, but
there are lots of different coloured dots flying past you and I presume
you have to collect them. Some are going faster than others, but
sometimes you explode. This part of the game is not very interesting
because not only do you get out with far fewer rockets than if you
played the Pinball game, but you don't actually even know what your
really suppose to be doing! Sometimes you collect a dot/pixel and you
earn a rocket - yet sometimes you collect a dot/pixel and explode, thus,
losing a life. The sound effects for this sub level are also the worst
in the whole game. Everytime you collect a dot you get the sound of a
badly digitized frog crock - which is cut short.
{p} {p}
The sound throughout the main game is not very accurate. Its un-clear
what the programmer has done, but sometimes you get noise when you fire,
and sometimes you don't. The game seems unable to play more than 2 sound
effects at any time, yet there is no in-game music and so you would
presume 2 channels are still empty.
{p} {p}
The Pinball sub level has been spruced up quit a bit with sound fx. There
are little pings and tunes playing when you manage to hit certain targets
or highlight 3/3 sensors etc.
{p} {p}
The graphics through-out the game are crude to basic. Again, the Pinball
game seems to have had the most attention in this respect with
animation, graphics and sound working together in harmony. All 4
channels seem to have been put to use as well. All in all its 3 average
games in one package.
