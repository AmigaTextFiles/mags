This is a re-release of a 1997 game by the programmer. He has cleared up
a few of the bugs apparently, but even said himself "although it still
has bad gameplay.".
{p} {p}
The aim of the game is to move a cannon up and down the right hand side
of the screen, and shoot the on coming sheep one by one from the left
hand side the screen. Each Sheep has a point value which is either 25,
50, 100 or 500. As you progress through the game you run out of ammo, at
which point you are transported to the text based gun shot to buy some
more ammo and exchange your 'extra' lives for more points.
{p} {p}
The game goes on and on like this for about 10mins, until you find that
the price of ammo goes up everytime you enter the gun shop. It comes to
the point were you cannot exchange enough lives and earn enough points
in one level to buy sufficient ammo for the next and you WILL actually
end up loosing due to the fact you have no ammo to stop the Sheeps
invasion of your part of the screen.

The grahpics are nothing to send a dog to the moon about. The one and only
sfx to the game is a very distorted BLAH. IT doesn't actually sound like
anything, except distortion for half a second.
{p} {p}
The best part of the game has to be the Main Menu. You are presented
with a well drawn and designed menu, with two simple options "1> Play
with mouse. 2> Play with joystick". The background music is of a Techno-
Pop type and supplements the games story introduction as well as the
main title screen.
{p} {p}
This is the kind of game you reserve for absolute bordem. You might want
to play it while doing a 2 minute download, but its programmed in Amos
and isn't multi-tasking.
