Continuing with our look at some of the great Amiga classics, we
now move on to Frontier: Elite II. Anyone who remembers playing
the original Elite on the BBC micro and other 8-bit machines will
be familiar with the idea behind this space-trading simulation.
The classic original Elite had a whole universe made up of simple
wire-frame graphics, yet the atmosphere and scope of the game
were unparalleled at the time.
{p} {p}
One of the authors, David Braben, set about creating a sequel.
This was to take many years of hard work, before finally being
released to the world in 1994. With the power of the Amiga,
Braben had been able to create an enormous universe with millions
of worlds, dozens of different craft to pilot, and almost an
infinite amount of things to do. This time proper filled polygons
were used, and Braben (being an amateur astronomer himself) had
worked on accurate flight physics and the effect of gravity from
the planets. In effect, this made it as much a simulation as a
game.

Of course, the game elements were clearly present too - you could
make all your money off attacking and destroying pirate ships.
However, most of us started the easier way. You were dropped
onto a small planet with 100 credits in cash, and a rather
weak spacecraft. To start making money - albeit rather slowly
and boring - you could do cargo runs between various star
systems, trading in the items they were short of.
{p} {p}
Once you had built-up enough cash, though, the fun really
started. Huge ships, like the Panther Clipper, could hold heaps
of weaponry and tools like shields. You could fit passenger
cabins and take people between systems. You could buy a mining
machine and collect ore from the surfaces of distant planets.
Or you could work for the military.
{p} {p}
The Frontier universe was split into 3 major factions: the
Federal Systems, of which our current solar system was the
capital; the Imperial Empire, which had its base on Achenar,
and the Independents who wanter to remain neutral. Who to
work for, of course, will be the subject of debate for years,
but suffice to say it lead to a more exciting and prosperous
existence than solitary mining.
{p} {p}
You started off delivering messages - not much fun, but you do
have to prove your allegiance. After a few missions, you moved
on to taking secret documents (and your ship started to get
attacked when travelling to starports). Once they knew you
well enough, you could end up doing assassinations and launching
nuclear missiles at enemy bases.
{p} {p}
Actually, we're jumping ahead here. You can be the most faithful
military serviceman in the world, but if you're useless in combat
situations then no-one will want you. This is where the Elite
Rating comes in. Basically, the more kills you amassed, the
higher your Elite rating became. It took many, many kills to
even get anywhere near Dangerous and Deadly, let alone Elite.
When your rating was high, you could do the scarier stuff for
the military, and even do freelance assassinations for people
on the Bulletin Boards.
{p} {p}
It was this sheer level of freedom that made Frontier such
an incredible game - even a way of life. Admittedly it wasn't
for everyone, and if you're the kind of person who just fancies
a quick 10-minute blast every now and then, it wouldn't be your
cup of tea. But with prolonged playing came rewarding
discoveries. There was always something else to do. Of course,
nothing goes on forever and there came a point where you think
you've exhausted it all, but simply travelling to new and
distant worlds was entertaining enough in itself.
{p} {p}
So much of the universe had been carefully crafted, and it
really made you feel part of it. For instance, you could go
outside a space station above a planet, float by the huge
docking-bay doors, and threaten to destroy the place. They
would send out masses of police ships, which (if you had a
good enough laser) you could blast as they left. This would
knock up your Elite rating, but of course you'd become a
fugitive and would have to pay a hefty fine. So you'd go and
work for the real guys in the Empire.
{p} {p}
Frontier is still incredible to play, simply because there
isn't anything else quite like it. Any Amiga with 1MB of
RAM will run it, and it fits onto a single floppy disk.
As we said, the game is an acquired taste - you need to
spend time with it, before judging if it's really for you
on not. The whole style is unique - from the cheesy renditions
of classical music to the bizarre appearance of space station
staff. Whether it becomes your life or not, you just need to
have played it once.
