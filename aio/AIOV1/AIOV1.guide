@node "can" "Digital Candy changes hands"

@{fg shine} Digital Candy@{fg text}

           After 3 years of running on an Amiga4000 Digital Candy one of the largest
 BBSes in the UK has changed hands. Digital Candy is a well known BBS in the 'Scene'
 it has all the latest demo/party releases and a mixture of other files that nowhere
 else has ever seen. Digital Candy has around 1000 users and offers free email
 access and also has all the latest Aminet CD-roms online at all times. It runs 24hrs
 7 days a week and is hardy ever offline for problems. You can find the information
 below in the 'news release' :-

 Dear user of Digital Candy,

 A short time ago I announced that I wanted to sell the whole Digital
 Candy BBS system. Well a buyer for the complete set up has been found
 and I'm pleased to announce that DC WILL continue running as it is now
 but under a new Sysop and new number.


 The move date is  6th April 1997.

 The new number is 01889 579 854 (West Midlands).

 The new Sysop is  Simba.


 All the Digital Candy accounts will be preserved, in fact the BBS will
 be exactly as you see it now, just on 5 nodes at first instead of 6. We
 will soon be back up to 6 lines though!

 I will still be invloved in DC as a remote co-sysop so you haven't
 escaped my watchful eye just yet!

 Of course, thanks must go to all the guys that have made DC such a very
 special place in the 3 years it has been running.


        PLEASE SUPPORT THE DIGITAL CANDY MOVE AND THE NEW SYSOP TEAM.


               SPREAD THE WORD AND KEEP IT THE BEST THERE IS.


 Your ex-sysop

 Hybrid.

@{fg shine} Gateway2000 News Release@{fg text}

 NORTH SIOUX CITY, S.D., March 27, 1997 - Gateway 2000, Inc. (Nasdaq: GATE)
 today announced that the company has made an offer to acquire the assets of
 AMIGA Technologies including all patents, trademarks and trade names. The
 company is a subsidiary of ESCOM AG, a German-based computer company that
 went into bankruptcy in July of 1996. AMIGA led the industry in combining
 computer graphics, animation, and film sequences with stereo sound known
 today as multimedia.

 The offer has been accepted by the court-appointed Administrator in
 Bankruptcy in Germany acting on behalf of AMIGA. The agreement is subject to
 regulatory approval.

 "This acquisition is good news for Gateway and customers of AMIGA," said Rick
 Snyder, president and COO of Gateway 2000. "It will strengthen our
 intellectual property position and invigorate a company that has been a
 pioneer in multimedia solutions and operating systems technology."

 AMIGA Technologies will be renamed AMIGA International. The company will
 operate as a separate business unit and will retain its current president,
 Petro Tyschtschenko, who will work to develop new products for the AMIGA
 market.

 "Gateway 2000 will give us new life and energy for the future," said
 Tyschtschenko.

 About Gateway 2000

 City, South Dakota, has manufacturing facilities in the United States,

 What Chris Seward the Editor of AIO had to say :-

 "Gateway2000 came out of the blue, no-one expected them to buy the Amiga
 we all thought it would be QuikPAK or VIScorp. Now all we can do is hope
 and pray that Gateway2000 do something unlike Escom who just buggered the
 whole thing up, but i'm putting my full support behind Gateway2000"

@node "Myst" "Myst come to the Amiga"

@{fg shine} Myst press release@{fg text}

 Dear Amiga users,

 We at PXL computers and clickBOOM brought to you Capital Punishment
 last November. It went on to become the biggest game of the year.
 At the same time we promised more great things to come...

 Today, we are proud to announce we are developing and publishing
 the Amiga version of Myst!

 What can we possibly say about Myst that has not already been said
 a thousand times? It is hard to imagine a more important game for
 the Amiga, since Myst is the bestselling CD-ROM game ever!

 Myst is not about polygons, frames per second, megahertz, or other 1997's
 jargon. It's a thinking man's game, with intelligent gameplay. It shows
 you don't have to be chasing bad guys with a shot gun to have fun with
 a computer game. In 1996 every team (including clickBOOM) was trying to
 squeeze the life out of the machine they were programming for, in order
 to get the fastest action. On the other hand, there was Myst with its
 brilliant adventure puzzles - and it became the bestselling game of
 the year for both PC and Mac!

 Myst is what happens when a team of extremely talented and hard working
 people creates a vision. Cyan, developers of the original Myst, have done
 a tremendous job in the graphics and sound department, topping that with
 the best adventure puzzles.

 Myst will also be the biggest challenge for the Amiga market. If it
 succeeds, you will be seeing many more hit games coming - some through us,
 some through other big companies who temporarily left the Amiga market.

 Amiga version, like the original, will be CD-only. If you do not own
 a CD-ROM drive, you have a couple of months left to get it, or you will
 be lagging behind. For the rest of you, get a copy of Capital Punishment
 while you are waiting for Myst. :)

 On Mac and PC, Myst was the first game to push hardware limits, requiring
 faster processor and a CD-ROM drive. It is clear we want to continue our
 revolution on the Amiga, and this time our task is to push the hardware
 limits.

 The exact specifications for Myst are still not known. At the moment, it
 appears that the following requirements will be necessary:

 Minimum Hardware:
 CD-ROM drive
 AGA or Amiga with a video board
 4Mb of FAST RAM
 '030 CPU

 Recommended Hardware:
 8Mb of FAST RAM
 '040 or better CPU

 Specifications:
 - OS-friendly
 - Fully multitasking
 - Video board support (CyberGraphX, Picasso 96) in 16 million colors
 - AGA in 256 colors
 - Hi-res screenmodes (productivity, double PAL/NTSC, interlace).

 Developer: clickBOOM
 Publisher: PXL computers
 Release date: Summer

 We will be constantly keeping you up-to-date with our development progress.
 The best place for the latest information is our web site, located at
 home.ican.net/~clkboom/
 Additionally, Myst screenshots and sounds are available for download.
 Prior to the release of the game, you will be able to enjoy some playable
 demos.

 As always, feel free to contact us at  clkboom@ican.net

 Best regards from your clickBOOM team.

@{fg shine} The Big Red Adventure@{fg text}

           The Big Red Adventure is finally going to hit the Amiga. It will be
 released at The World Of Amiga Show in London, England on the 17th of May. 
 Power Computing will showing off and selling TBRD so you should get to there
 stand if you want it. It will be released as a CD-Rom game only due to the
 amount of locations. The screens of the game have been directly ported from
 the PC so they will be no different, it also means that the game is AGA only
 and has to be played in hi-res which may cause some problems to non-monitor
 owners. This is probably the biggest adventure on the Amiga boasting a huge
 100 locations with taxing problems so it should last you a good while to. In
 a recent review in the English Magazine the CUAmiga it was rated 90% overall.

@node "Alien" "Alien Formula One"

@{fg shine} Alien Formula One@{fg text}

           Alien Formula One is the BEST racing game i've ever seen. The graphics
 are console style and the speed is unbelievable even on an 020/25mhz A1200. The
 view is out of the front window, but this is optional and you can race in about
 4 postions. If you like you can watch what the other cars are doing which is great
 on it's own seeing them speed around at great angles. The only real problem is the
 game is controled by the mouse which takes some getting use to but once you've masted
 that you'll never want to stop playing the game. AFormulaOne is in it's early stages
 and the author is very busy meaning that he doesn't have much time to program it, but
 maybe everyone should download it and give him some incouragement.

@{fg shine} Euro League Manager@{fg text}

           Euro League Manager seems to just be another management game. It 
 doesn't offer anything new and i can't justify why they've charged £19.99
 for it. The layout and replay scenes are quite good but everything else has
 been done half heartedly. The major bad point is the teams don't use real
 players so most of the fun of a management game is taken out stright away.
 Maybe you should wait for Championship Management 2 and then compair which
 one is the best. Overall if you just want a nice looking management game
 well then you should definatly get this.

@{fg shine} ApexGolf@{fg text}

           At last we get a new golf game, but is it any good? This golf game is
 licenceware and is probably about that quality. The main sprite is pathetic but
 the ingame graphics and the courses are drawn quite good. There are 9 holes on the
 demo version and loads more on the full version. The game costs £14.99+75p P&P
 and is probably worth it the amount of holes you get. You can even play one player
 so if your bored and have noone to play with well this will cheer you up. Overall
 this game is great and should keep you busy for months.

@{fg shine} SoreFist@{fg text}

           Remember back to the days of Spectrums and Commodore 64s, do you remember
 a game called Renegade, for you that do this is an Amiga version of it. This version
 isn't as good as i remember the classic version but for you that haven't got Spectrums
 or C64s this will give you a good idea of what it was like. The basic idea is to go
 in and beat-up everyone up on the screen. You start in the middle with about 8 baddies
 around you and punch and kick and just hope you can beat them, after you've beat them
 all up a big hard end-of-level boss comes over and starts punching you, it's quite
 easy to kill the boss but getting to him is a bit to hard. Even on easy mode the baddies
 seem to over power you, but i suppose if you did have 8 people round you it'd be hard.
 This game is quite good actually and will give you some hours of enjoyment.

@{fg shine} Ital 2.5@{fg text}

           "Nel mezzo del viaggio della nostra vita lo ho trovato me stesso in una foresta
 oscura" - Dante, translated from Italian to English by human, and back to Italian by
 computer. Cards on the table, I can read only just read enough Italian to get a vague
 idea of what is being said but compared to the translation software which returned the
 phrase "for better or worse", via the Japanese, as "to decay or beat" Ital 2.5 looks
 good to me.
 Ital 2.5 is a pre-release demo version. It will develop into something more comprehensive
 in time, but right now it works and it's free. It conjugates, it's context sensitive, and
 has a fair vocabulary.
 It can translate on the fly or translate documents, has an ARexx port, and will even
 translate AmigaGuides. It does alas only translate one way. I guess the main use of it
 right now is to provide translations of your shareware docs.

@node "swsed" "SWOSEd"

@{fg shine} Sensible World Of Soccer Editor@{fg text}

           SWOS has got to be one of the best football/management games on any platform
 even if it hasn't got fancy 64bit Graphics. Now for some of you that own the older versions
 the teams and players are out of date so this is where SWOSEd steps in. Even if you own
 the latest '96/'97 edition this can still be very useful. The basic idea is to edit what-
 ever team you want, you can boost everything from how much there worth to the speed of
 the player. There's not really much more to it but this util is brilliant and I don't
 know how I lived without it. The only problem with it is that the English league is so
 big you cannot edit that as SwosEd won't directly compact it, you will need a program
 called ProPak. If you havn't got this then you don't know what your missing out on.

@{fg shine} Sensible World Of Soccer HD installer@{fg text}

           Another useful util is this one, the basic idea is to install SWOS to
 your HD so you don't have to bother with long disk access and you don't have to
 bother with disks at all. I was really looking forwards to installing SWOS '96/'97
 to my HD with this installer but I was sadly dissapointed. The documentation
 states that you should be able to run SWOS directly from your HD but my problem
 is I have to use a boot disk. Although very fast I would have liked to beable
 to just click on it. Maybe this is just me so I won't put it down for that, but be
 warned it might not be as simple as clicking on an icon. Overall I would recommend
 this as it loads up very quickly indeed.

@{fg shine} AmTerm Version 1.1@{fg text}

           Most of you who frequent BBSes will probably be using software like Ncomm,
 Term or Termite but now theres another option... AmTerm, out of all the four this
 uses the best interface boasting the easy to use MUI interface. Although it is no
 use what so ever if you don't own MUI it is still worth downloading if you do own
 MUI. The set up and prefs are easy enough to use so you won't get stuck setting them
 up, but when you resize the window and save it doesn't seem to save the window size,
 the ANSI colours are also quite anoying to set up if you don't have a clue about
 setting ANSI up. Overall this package has good points and bad points, you really
 need to check it out yourself to get the feel of it.
