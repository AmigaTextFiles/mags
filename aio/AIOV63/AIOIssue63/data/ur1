{subhead}YAM vs AEMail{def}{p}
Review by Mark Tierno

{pp}
With AEMail comingf out with updates of late, and YAM in new betas, I
thought a little comparison was in order.  Nothing detailed, mind you,
just a sor5t of thumbnail review of each in terms of the other.
{pp}
First off, YAM is MUI and AEMail is CLassAct.  MUI can configure more
options, including some things that AEMail has to put specifically
into it's own prefs, such as Fonts.  MUI also allows the user to
choose if YAM is on the WB or on it's own screen.  AEMail appears on
it's own screen- period.  There is no way to put AEMail on another
public screen, for those that like their mailer in a small window and
not taking up the extra system resources of a full screen.  However,
certain functions of AEMail will switch temporarily over to the WB and
back again, which is a bit much on the screen switching.
{pp}
AEMail allows multiple users each with different email addresses,
project icons, and config fiiles, and also password protected.  YAM is
single user but you can have as many email addresses as you want to be
checked.  Both programs can iconify but AEMail's icon is a long menu
bar and YAM's is a nice colorful icon.
{pp}
Filters work a bit differently.  YAM has quite the variety of filters
to be set, and able to set which ones operate automatically and which
have to be manually activated.  AEMail has limited filtering except
when setting up folders; it's filtering capabilities are built into
the setting up of new folders, whoich means you can't set any up
independently, that they will always operate automatically.
{pp}
Folders are different too.  In YAM they are physical directories, in
AEMail they appear to be merely logical assignments in the main
directory, which means files everywhere.  In YAM files can be
transfered by Drag and Drop; in AEMail it's Drag and What?  I'm not
even sure if AEMail {bold}can{nobold} easily transfer files to other
folders you have set up (other then Delete, of course).
{pp}
Both programs allow the headers to be viewed, but in YAM they're in a
second window in the main mail window with titles in color, which is a
neater look; in AEMail it's all just plain text in one read window. 
Both have MIME prefs for viewers, though in AEMail since they appear
on the WB that's another screen flip.  HTML mail is viewed in AEMail
by a script that launches your browser, but then there's a script or
three for YAM for the same thing.
{pp}
Some of the windows to configure different things or set up new
folders take up the whole screen and aren't resizeabale.  YAM has a
lot more versatile prefs and is also a lot more color looking with
it's buttons and MUI interface.  In fact, in general YAM appears more
versatile in terms of appearance, GUI, and overall interface, as well
as a bit more functionality.  There's also the fact that AEMail is $30
shareware and YAM is free.
{pp}
Overall, between it's cabilities, versatility, and appearance and
layout of interface, I would say that YAM rates a few points higher
than AEMail and the scores reflect this.  Of course, some might say
there's also AmigaMail but that has far less capability then either
here and has a problem with it's menus merely overwriting th first
three WB menus instead of replacing the whole thing (those of us with
Tools Daemon notice this).
{pp}
I guess what I'm saying is that I'll stick with YAM.
