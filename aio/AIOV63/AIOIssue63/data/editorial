So who else is counting the days until a new Ami system?  Reports make
it look like a few things may be left out like suppoort for 880K disks
(which I can't understand since the PC world must have ways of reading
older disks), and draggable screens 9at least for now), but remember
that much of that may be fixed with the next release after 4.0.  They
just had the draw the line somewhere in order to get this out, and now
doubt everything after that line will be for whatever version number
comes next.

Oh, but just think of what we'll have by 5.0!  Maybe the world will
start to believe, as we all do, that an OS doesn't have to be a Gig in
size to be good, or a system hog to be doing something.  My personal
beliefe is that you get more advanced hardware then you should notice
a similar increase in performance and productivity of your OS and
apps, not just OS and apps eating up that increase of resources just
to have the same effective productivity.  Many Wintel users, no matter
what they upgrade to in Hardware, are so bogged down by the software
"upgrades" that they are actually accomplishing little more then back
when they had a 486. Doesn't sound like progress to me.

But that won't be us, not by a {italic}long{noitalic} shot.
