IBrowse Development Team: "As many of you will know, IBrowse has been
without a proper home on the web for a while, until now. Obviously,
this website is a bit minimal at the moment, but we are planning to
address this situation soon. We are currently busy preparing IBrowse
2.3 (68K) for release - as yet we have no indication of a firm
release date, but good progress is being made and we are doing our
best to get IBrowse 2.3 ready for release a.s.a.p. In the meantime,
for those of you who are not already aware of it, you are invited to
join the mailing list."
