September 5, 2002 - From the desk of Bill McEwen{p}
Greetings to one and all:
{pp}
I would first like to thank all of those that I had the chance 
to meet in Sacramento. While a short trip it was indeed great 
fun and real delight meeting with all of you and hearing not 
only the encouraging words, but also sharing in your concerns, 
desires, and dreams. We are looking forward to deliver on what 
we discussed with you.
{pp}
When we purchased Amiga from Gateway there were many out there
who said that we would fail. There were many out there who
have worked against our efforts, and others that have
misrepresented fact and manipulated privileged information in
order to further their obviously self serving goals. There
have been those who have wronged us, and caused us damage.
{pp}
But, guess what? We are still here! We are still delivering!
We are going to stay here! Amiga is about people, technology,
excellence, we are a most tenacious people, and we have the
community to prove it. Has it always gone according to plan?
no. Have we made some adjustments to the plan? yes. Are we
delivering on the plan? yes. Will we allow others to dictate
our future? Absolutely not. Period..
{pp}
Because of you, the Amiga dream lives, because of you, Amiga's
are still being used throughout the world performing amazing
tasks and activities, and because of you, we are still here
and moving forward.
{pp}
Amiga is a giant resting for the day of the fight, and gaining
strength quietly, for, as we embark on this mission together,
nothing will tear us apart.
{pp}
Thank you once again for supporting us, and showing to the
world that what was begun in 1985 was truly only the beginning.
{pp}
Bill McEwen, and the Amiga Team

I would also like to take a minute and say a special howdy to
all of the club members. It is really encouraging to see all
of the activity and input from you with regards to the shirt
design and name for the club. The "I am Amiga" name did not go
over as well as I had thought, but in the next couple of weeks
(after we get the ok from those who already have the name that
was selected) we will all have the name and shirt design with
which an be happy and proud to wear. Each member will receive
their first newsletter in the next two weeks, and there will
be all sorts of great announcements and information e, so look
forward to it in your inbox.
{pp}
As a reminder we will be having a new drawing for an Amiga
Enabled Cell Phone in September, and we would encourage those
of you who have not joined yet, to get in here and do so. We
have many plans and activities coming up for the club, and
once again for only $ 50.00 you will receive the newsletter,
Shirt and other special promotions. The lifetime membership
offer has ended, but we would encourage you to be a part of
something really exciting as the members will continue to
receive special discounts and exclusive programs directed at
the membership. We will honor the "$50.00 off" certificate for
the next members who join through the end of September, at
which point we will hold the draw for the new cell phone.

As mentioned in Sacramento at AmiWest, we had offered amnesty
to those people/companies/entities who have knowingly stolen
our IP and used it for their own gains, or who have shipped
product knowing that they are illegal had until the end of
August in order for them to comply and to get legal.
{pp}
Now, I am not going to mention names nor am I going to get
into a public discourse on what is happening.. But legal
action has begun. In the next two weeks papers will be served.
We will target one violator at a time with the hope that we
will send a very clear signal that this is very serious, will
not be permitted and will be stopped.
{pp}
This is a private action between Amiga Inc, and those who wish
to continue in this practice. While we announced publicly our
intentions, the actions will be private. I am sure that
everyone can understand this and I hope will support this.

{bold}AmigaOne Update:{nobold}
{pp}
Well, the amazing team of Eyetech and Hyperion are doing a
great job. Many of you already have in your possession the
AmigaOne boards, and many more of you have seen the hardware
in action. This is indeed another major leap forward as we
near the release of the new hardware and OS 4.0. Eyetech and
Alan Redhouse have been doing a great job of keeping everyone
informed of the progress, and we look forward to the products
release.
{pp}
{pp}
{bold}AmigaOS 4.0:{nobold}
{pp}
Hyperion and the team are making amazing strides here. The
screen shots that we all see and the updates from Ben and the
people working on it shows great progress. I know that they
are working hard with regard to the integration into the
AmigaOne, and I for one am looking forward to seeing it all
working together, and from what I hear we are not too far off
from making that happen. With this stated we have received
some more shots of the interface from the OS 4.0 team. You can
see the new AmiDock screenshots here.
{pp}
{pp}
{bold}PDA/Cell Phone Update:{nobold}
{pp}
As mentioned in Sacramento the Amiga Anywhere Content Engine
and associated content will be shipping on the new Sendo(TM)
SmartPhone(TM) when it ships. Now, to answer the many e-mails
that I have received about the Sendo phone. I do not know
when the device will ship commercially; it is out of our hands
with regard to when they will have the phone available. I will
tell you that before the end of the year we will be making at
least two more Cell Phone announcements and at least two more
PDA announcements.
{pp}
We are really starting to move on getting these business deals
done and there will be many more opportunities for our
developers to create new products for these cutting edge
devices.
{pp}
{pp}
{bold}A Possible New Product Offering - Let me know your thoughts:{nobold}
{pp}
In recent dealings with one of our hardware OEM's they offered
an opportunity.{p}
This opportunity is for excellent laptop hardware at excellent
prices. They would be dual boot systems with Linux/UAE, and
Bernie Meyers product (formally known as Amithlon) pre-loaded
on the device. Here is a sample of some of the pricing that
you could expect, all prices quoted are in US$:
{pp}
   Intel® 1.2GHz Celeron(TM) Processor - 256MB RAM - 15.0" TFT Active Matrix 20GB Hard Drive
- DVD Drive - Linux/UAE Ami*- $999
{pp}
   Intel® 1.6GHz Pentium® 4 Processor - 256MB RAM - 15.0" XGA TFT Active Matrix
- 20GB Hard Drive - DVD/CDRW Combo Drive - Linux/UAE Ami* - $1579
{pp}
   Intel® 1.6GHz Pentium® 4 Processor - 256MB RAM - SXGA TFT Active Matrix 
- 30GB Hard Drive - DVD/CDRW Combo Drive - Linux/UAE Ami* - $1679
{pp}
These examples are notebook computers. There are other options
available, but I am trying to find out how many of you would
be interested in purchasing these through your local Amiga
dealer. Let us know by sending an e-mail to
interested@amiga.com. There are also desktops and other
configurations but I think that a notebook Amiga would be
compelling. Let us know.
{pp}
{pp}
{bold}The Product Formally Know as Amithlo*:{nobold}
{pp}
As mentioned before Bernie Meyers has a wonderful product, and
we expected it to be out by now. However there have been a
couple of delays, none of these are engineering driven, that
has delayed the release. I can tell you that the new product
will be out very soon, and will offer some new requested
features, and from what I understand is really going to knock
your socks off. We will have an update concerning the timing
of this release and the new name very shortly. So contrary to
what you may have heard, it will be available soon.

{bold}Developers:{nobold}
{pp}
This message is an update for you. You have created some of
the greatest content that the world has ever known. Your skill
sets and your tenacity have overwhelmed many, and everyday you
become more and more important to the future.
{pp}
If you have been sitting on the sidelines I encourage you to
jump in. We are getting requests from many of our OEM partners
with regard to content that they are looking for on their
devices.
{pp}
While it has been a slow start (as is always the case in
developing a market), this next quarter is going to see major
movement, and distribution. We have many programs ready to
take place for the Holiday season and we want you to be a part
of it. So I encourage you to jump in make contact with us.
Join us in creating the future.
{pp}
{pp}
In closing I wish to thank each and every member of the Amiga
family for their support and good wishes in this amazing
journey that we have embarked upon together. We are closer
today than we were yesterday to the dreams and goals of Amiga.
Tomorrow we will be closer again, and soon we can all share in
the rewards.
{pp}

Sincerely,
{pp}
Bill McEwen and the rest of the Amiga Team
