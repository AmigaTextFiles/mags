Hmm, late September and getting near to the time of the year when I
have to start readying up my own haunted house. In the meantime
though, here's an ecclectic little mix of sites, including one devoted
to my favorite holiday.  Enjoy...

{bold}Ultimate Haunt{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.ultimatehaunt.com/{noitalic}{p}
Over here in California, a local amusement park called Knotts Berry
Farm has there famous Knott's Haunt, wherein for about the entire
month of October they dress up the park for a special in-park
scare-fest.  Now you can see for yourself the monsters, sights,
streets, and events, in a site devoted entirely to the Knott's Haunts
of years past, complete with pictures and past archives.  See what all
the fuss is about and have fun.

{bold}Coffins and models{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.cofanifunebri.it/la%20produzione.htm{noitalic}{p}
Okay, technically this is a commerical site and only part of one at
that, but an entertaining part.  Their hook for drawing people in to
buy their coffins?  Have scantily-clad models show them off.  Quite a
unique thing for such a serious product, but this {bold}is{nobold} an
Italian site.

{pp}
{bold}Trekweb{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://talk.trekweb.com/{noitalic}{p}
Another trek info site, it good for keeping up on the latest trek
movie, the new series Enterprise, and general trek-oriented online
chatting.  So for all the latest Trek news, give it a try.

{bold}Association for Computing Machinery{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.acm.org/{noitalic}{p}
A nice general resource site for computing info, the ACM is a good
place to start for all things computer with SIGs on dozens of
subjects.  Bookmark it for future reference.

{bold}The Adrenaline Vault{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.adrenalinevault.com/{noitalic}{p}
You like games?  Well, while this site seems to cater to every sort of 
gaming platform {bold}but{nobold} the Amiga, it {italic}is{noitalic} a 
good resource for action computer gaming in general, be it computer or gaming
console.{p}
The selection seems to range from PC games to consoles such as XBox and 
PS2, as well the usual multi-platform selections.  They only care about 
games here, and the most common and popular platforms are supported.  
get the latest news on upcoming selections, previews, demos, reviews, 
and even regular articles on the hardware, gaming strategy, and more.  
Developers of games and gaming web sites too have a place, and of course 
the usual cheats, hints, and downloadable patches.{p}
So break out those gaming consoles and get all the latest sccops on 
them.  As for myself, ah but if I only had the time to game at all...
