On the comming weekend we are proud to present you the Pegasos and
the Amiga One to the public. The Pegasos computer will be demoed by
the german Thendic France partner DYXS GmbH. We already recieved the
new Rev. "B" Amiga One G3SE mainboard and will present the board
running the new updated BIOS. We hope Linux will make it until the
weekend. Beside MorphOS we will demo current pieces of the AmigaOS4
and the Thylacine and Highway USB solutions incl. peripherals. Also,
the first time in Austria: Linux on the Playstation 2.
