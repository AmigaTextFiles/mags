Nearly everything in YAM can be configured but some things take a bit
of hunting around.  Perfect example are the colors.{p}
In tyhe YAM config itself, the Settings-->Read allows ypou to set the
colors for colored text and old quotes, while through the MUI menu you
can set just about every other color of text, background, and
button... with one exception.  When reading an email, your lower half
of the window has the text of the message while an upper window has
the more technical info such as Recieved, From, and the rest.  In this
latter these titles are printed in a glaring red which is inaccessible
from either YAM or MUI.  Annoying when you're trying to keep it from
clashing with the background you've chosen and really like.{p}
The answer is in the Workbench's Palette Preferences program.  The
color that YAM uses for these header labels is that of the "Important
Text" in the Palette Prefs and can be altered via that interface.

Another common YAM question regards html text and the reading thereof.
 Personally, I think html wastes bandwidth in an email, but for those
that want it, one good way is through the use of YAM2URL.  Just set it up
in the Settings--->MIME of YAM, with the Attachment Type being
"text/html", Extension being "html", and the viewer set to 
"rx SYS:Rexx/YAM2URL.rexx %s".  Another one is a script called
"HTMLmail.rexx".  The docs in both will tell how to configure them for
use between YAM and your chosen browser.{p}
For opening up a clicked-on
URL there is OpenURL or Hurl, both of which can be found on Aminet. 
The Rexx script that comes with OpenURL is a bit  twisted, however, so
just configure it in YAM under "When Clicking On A URL" as "OpenURL
NEWWIN" and it'll work just fine (the rest is in OpenURL's own prefs
program).

On another subject, this tip comes in response to a question from one
of our readers.  He asked how to open up LHA files on his PC so he
could unarchive his issue.  One answer is the program PCOpus on the PC
includes built-in LHA support; it's available from
http://www.sonic.net/alanwall/i.html and it's free.
