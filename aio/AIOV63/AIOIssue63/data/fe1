Now that the run-on-anything Digital Environment is nearing completion
and with it our first real OS update in a long time, there is perhaps
one little type of application that developers should not forget, and
this one especially would be easy under the new DE.
{pp}
Emulators.  No, I'm not just talking of the older AOS, but IBM and MAC
as well.  If the new DE can run on any platform with only a single file
to make a difference, then the obvious solution raises it's head.
Rather then the old-style other-platform emulators, a better solution
would be to have another one of those DE files for each other platform's
programs you wish to run, so that even while running on AOS, when you
try to run a PC or MAC program said interface will kick in.  I'm not
talking emulation with the unnecessary PC and MAC screens popping up,
but running natively just like any other Amiga program.
{pp}
I know this should sound obvious with the new capabilities of the DE,
but sometimes the obvious needs reminding.  A native-task emulator with
no unneeded foreign screens should be fairly easy with the new
capabilities, just run it through or in parrallel to the AOS layer.
So get cracking, all you developers.  We want it all and we want it
now.
