This is an official statement on behalf of the Elbox Computer company aimed at explanation of the recent misunderstanding concerning support for the Spider USB cards in the Poseidon stack.
Chris Hodges, author of the Poseidon stack, approached our company several weeks ago with the proposal of co-operation. He suggested that we prepared hardware drivers for Mediator for the Poseidon to enable operation of USB cards, the support to which under our own USB stack was to be released in a short time.
The proposal from Mr. Hodges was analysed in detail and accepted after many additional mutual considerations.
Its basic principles were presented in the mutually accepted announcement: http://www.elbox.com/news_02_09_11B.html.

To clarify the issues once and for good:
{pp}
1. The number of models / types / of USB PCI cards supported by our
drivers was never the subject matter of the mutual considerations.
Elbox, the party who prepared the drivers, decides which cards to
support.

2. One of our proposal: bundling by us or by our distributors the
registered version of the Poseidon stack with the USB PCI cards, was
rejected by the author of the Poseidon stack. And we accepted it.
