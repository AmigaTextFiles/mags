Welcome, welcome to the amazing game of ten green bottles, with 3D
GFX and all.... well not exactly but thats what the author seems to
think it is. The game has the same idea as the old childs rhyme
ten green bottles. We've probably all sang it and tried to avoid
small children who ring out with joy "ten green bottles hanging on
the wall, ten green bottles hanging on the wall, but if one green
bottle should accidently fall, there will be 9 green bottles hanging
on the wall". Oh the memories just flood back.

As I said it has a similar idea to the song, except you do the smashing
of each bottle. Firstly you start off with about 10 bottles and you
have to click on each one to smash it, for a start the bottles look
nothing like any bottles i've ever seen but maybe thats just me. In
the corner of the screen is a small counter which is probably the
most complex piece of coding the author has done, pity really as nothing
highlights it or lets you know its actually there until you spot it
for yourself. You click on the bottles and {bold}try{nobold} to smash them all
before the time limit runs out. I don't actually know what the time
limit is because you can smash the bottles in super fast time. Once
you have smashed 10 bottles you move onto the next level which has
20 bottles and so on up til the last level (level 6) which has 60
bottles, oh! what a challenge <sarcastic>. I don't know if the author
decided not to test his game or he couldn't work out how to fix the
problem but you can just keep hold of the mouse button and pull over
every bottle in the row, too easy really.

The graphics are poor, the sound is corney and the gameplay doesn't
exist. Overall this game is about as good as a damp sock.

The thing that has always puzzled me is that the author of a program
writes his own .readme, plenty of times have I seen in the description
line "excellent game" only to find out it's terrible, but this one just
takes the biscuit. The author explains his masterpiece as,
{p} {p}
"easy to complete & fun to play, 6 level game, 3d gfx,
can you shoot all the bottles within the time limit
mouse controlled, A600/1200 only."
{p} {p}
Easy to complete is correct but fun to play? 3d GFX, honestly I really
think he is pushing it here. The game just sounds so exciting, can
you shoot all the bottles within the time limit. Oh how pathetic.

I'll leave you with a picture of the title screen and say no more...
