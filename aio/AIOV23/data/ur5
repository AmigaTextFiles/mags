KeyMod is a silly little program that generates typos. Hmm? I don'r jnow how

Ahem, let me retype that ;)

I don't know how many of these you've seen, but I haven't seen many that work.
But this one works pretty well!! It monitors how fast you type, and of course
when you type faster it generates errors more often. It changes keypresses to
look like you pressed the key on the left or the right side of what you
actually pressed, so even the Amiga keys can change into spaces etc.

KeyMod either checks your keymap or changes the keypresses at a very low
level, but anyway you get typos according to your keymap so if your keymap
has Z and P right next to each other they can get mixed.

KeyMod behaves very well; it hasn't crashed and it's a commodity so you can
quit it with Exchange or Ctrl+C if you prefer. And you can set a number
regulating how easily it'll change keypresses, so you fast typers out there
can still make SOME sense :)

Well, at least it'll be entertaining if you use it at 3.00 a.m... ;)
