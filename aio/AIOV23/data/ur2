This is another Swatch time util, please see the review for {link ur1}BeatIt{end} first.

bITime is more to my liking; you can set the font, font size, colors, window
size, window position and the public screen to use. Furthermore, it gets your
time zone from the locale settings, so you won't have to mess around with the
TZ variable. The window has an invisible close-gadget in the top left corner,
too. You can also make it display the real time on either side of the Swatch
time (or only the real time). And it even supports scalable fonts! Which means
CompuGraphic fonts and any other types that are being "emulated" as CG fonts
by some patches. Oh, that bullet (·) you see on most of these windows should
be an @ but the fonts didn't have it.. :)
