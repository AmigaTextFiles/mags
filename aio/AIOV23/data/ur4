This is another Swatch time util, please see the review for {link ur1}BeatIt{end} first.

ITimeCalc serves no real purpose to the average user, but it can be useful
for programmers. The exe itself only prints the Swatch time to the shell
window, and gets the time zone from the locale settings like bITime. As
such, it can be useful for script-writers (wouldn't it be sooo nice to see
the Swatch time sent to the channel in AmIRC ;) but the included source code
makes it useful to other programmers too (a couple lines of C, actually :).
In case you're really so interested in calculating the Swatch time in your
programs :)
