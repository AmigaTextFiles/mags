If you have not heard the hype or read the news articles then I am
glad to announce that all your hard work with donations has finally
paid off and I would like to thank everyone who donated to get this
site off the ground and to everyone who supported the AIO project.

I would like to thank some people who without, this registered site would
not be possible and people who have helped in the process of getting to
this stage. Firstly I'd like to thank all the editorial team of AIO, past
and present who have helped me bring a publication to many readers all
over the world. I would like to thank Chris Brown for hosting the current
site, even though he did slow on updates a bit to the end and also to 
Andrew Crowe who created the web site which I have hacked to bits and
added various areas. I would like to thank Conor Kerr who will be getting
the registered domain for me and the work he has done to bring it to life.
Last but not least I would like to give great thanks to the people who
believed in AIO enough to donate which without again we would not be
seeing the domain today, these great people are, Malcolm Harnden, Ian
Urie, Stuart Walker, Andrew Cashmore, Paul Steadman, Gerald Hobbs and
Raynald Le Moing.
