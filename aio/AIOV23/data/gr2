Biplanes is a very old game from September 1990, originally written by a
man called Peter Mason. This gem of a game was lost in the many years that
have past since then. Now, in 1999 we find this great old game brought
back to life to be compatable with the A1200.

Alot of games through the years have become memories because they never
worked with peoples new A1200's. Biplanes until now was one of them but
a nice chap called Mark de Jong has decided to dust off this game and
give it another chance to show us what the old games where like. At
last a classic game fixed to work on the A1200.

Biplanes as we should all know is the game where you have two biplanes
which fight in the air, also known as dogfight and various other names
that have been tagged to games of this type through the many versions
and updates people have made. You take control of one plane and the
computer or a friend takes control of the other. The idea is to take
off and blast your enemy out of the skies. If you are playing against
the computer then this is a hard task because the computer controlled
plane seems to be better equipt and throws various moves at you when
you least expect them. The game is alot of fun to play in one or two
player modes, the second being the choice of many. You can sit for
hours playing this game swearing and shouting at your friends and then
for a second take a step back and wonder why you are playing this old
game.

The graphics are not much to look at but the gameplay is excellent,
you will find yourself rooted to your seats for hours on end. Many of
todays games could learn a few things from this, as is always the
case the simple ideas are the best. Forget your 3D flight sims and
your texture mapping routines thrown in every console game under the
sun, get out Biplanes Fix 2 and have a good old waggle
