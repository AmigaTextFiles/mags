Gideon and me got together in March again to deepen our game-model. We
soon figured out that keeping a game model abstract and still keep it
making sense where a difficult mix. In the end, we started thinking about
the games ( potential ) interface. The main problem was that our universe,
contrary to most universes in games of this type, is both three-dimensional
and is capable of changing. The idea is that the universe itself plays a
small role in the game as well. You wouldn't want to live on a planet
orbiting a star which will go supernova in a couple of years...

For complexity of programming, having a 3D universe is not much more
difficult than having a 2D universe,  however, creating a usable, intuitive
interface for a 3D universe is another thing. We want the game to be
playable with relative ease. A 3D universe is hard to display in a simple
matter. We are still thinking about what form our interface will take and I
personnally think that it is going to be one of the bigger problems of the
design.

A changing universe is of course a very nice thing to have in a game. Most
games are very static in their games environment. Sure, there are some
random encounters, but basically the world stays the same. This also goes
for most computer players. I never, for instance, saw the computer in
Civilization wage a prolonged war with other computer players. Diplomacy
in such games also usually is rather primitive. We hope to make a game
where these points are adressed. Of course, the player will always be
limited in his interaction with the computer, but we will do our best to
make things as interesting as possible.

Of course, not everything worked out so well last month.. As you may have
noticed, there have been few updates to our website, certainly less
updates than I would want.. We are very much aware that this diary and our
website are the only thing you can read to see the status of our game, so
we will try to improve our website on a more regular basis.

Since our story and other creative people are busy trying to think up a
story worthy of a novel, they have no part in this months diary. I expect
they will have something to say next month, though..

Hope to see you again next month,
