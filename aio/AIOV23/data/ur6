MiLoad monitors Miami's incoming and outgoing traffic and shows the activity
as a graph in a tiny window, looking like many CPU usage meters. That's all
it does, but seeing the graph is sometimes very useful if you're wondering
whether your net connection has jammed for example, and at other times it's
just interesting to see what's going on in there :)

MiLoad can be run directly or you can specify the window dimensions and pens
on the command line. The window doesn't have a resize gadget, but if you can
resize it (e.g. with DragIt) it'll notice the change and adjust the graph.
The fact that when the window is full, it's cleared and continued from the
left border instead of scrolling the contents makes it quite ugly actually
and difficult to read, but it's version 1.0 so maybe we'll see an improvement
soon. MiLoad requires registered Miami 2.0 or higher.
