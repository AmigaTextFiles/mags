A1200 G3/G4, FireWire!
{p} {p}
  phase 5 digital products is excited to announce that the next step in
ground-breaking technological progress will take place soon. Since we first
announced the Cyberstorm G3/G4 project just 10 days ago, the overwhelming
response by the Amiga Community has not only convinced us to extend the
original Cyberstorm G3/G4 project to an extended Amiga G3/G4 product line.
Driven by the excitement of so many Amiga users, we have spent many hours of
additional consideration meanwhile, discussing the requests and demands by
the user community, and going into technical details and cost optimization.
Today we can present some exciting news, which also make some of the
statements of the original announcement and the update obsolete already.
However, if you had not informed yourself about this development before,
please read these original announcements which contain information about
conditions and time frames for this new product generation.
Following the history of world's most established processor upgrade
technology for Amiga computers, and implementing the experience of the
innovator who made the PowerPC technology for the Amiga a reality, we at
phase 5 digital products have also decided to make this new technology
available to a much larger user base, and doing what we always did in the
past years with our stunning products: Offer more value for less money! And
that's what we will be doing again - so go ahead and read about the new
additional features at the new lower prices!
New models: By introducing a second product, the Blizzard G3/G4, we will
also provide the stunning G3/G4 technology and performance to the users of
A1200 Tower systems. Two models - one with G3 and one with G4 processors -
can be ordered now. We are also now taking orders for the 300MHz G4 version
of the Cyberstorm G3/G4.
{p} {p}
New features: All G3/G4 boards from phase 5 digital products come with SCSI
on board - UltraSCSI on the A1200 versions, UltraWide SCSI on the
A3000/A4000 version. Our proven SCSI technology, which has been providing
unmatched performance since seven years, will provide full backwards
compatibility with existing SCSI devices. But even more than that: With the
integration of 400Mbit/s FireWire ports, all our G3/G4 boards open the door
to this future industry standard, including the world of digital video
devices
{p} {p}
New prices: By proceeding with the related projections and calculations, and
going into the details, we have been able to determine new and improved
pricings which will make these stunning products even more attractive. Plus,
we have changed the pricing to EURO (for Europe) and US$ (for outside
Europe).
{p} {p}
New Order & Prepayment conditions: In order to proceed quickly with the
finalization and production of this new product line, we still require the
originally announced quantity of back orders with a prepayment deposit. All
customers who support our development will receive a major discount, as
announced before (please see below for the new prices and discounts for the
different models). But phase 5 digital products is also ready to take orders
now without prepayment, for the suggested retail prices listed for the
different products. These orders will not be shipped by phase 5 digital
products directly, but forwarded to local dealers and distributors. So far
the overview of the major changes in the project. Now here comes the list of
the extended and updated new G3/G4 product line for the AMIGA by phase 5
digital products. Right now, users can choose out of the following four

All prices do not include VAT / MwSt. or any other local taxes or duties
which may apply. Specifications and prices are subject to change.
A note about Software: For the add-on features such as the SCSI interfaces
or the FireWire ports, phase 5 digital products will provide the necessary
software tools and drivers, and also cooperate with other developers.
Additionally, we are in negotiations about licensing useful software to ship
with our G3/G4 boards, and will take care that support of the upcoming
AmigaOS developments is realized.
Another note on the prepayment & discount: Remember, the prepayment which
enables you to take advantage of the discounted price, will go on a special
notary account as announced earlier. The amounts collected there will not
become available to us before we actually ship the products; they are a
deposit which support our efforts to bring out the new products for the
Amiga which the users have been asking for, thus representing a partnership
between the Amiga community and us in realizing this stunning new technology
for the Amiga.
If this new list of stunning product offerings includes the G3/G4 model
which you want for your Amiga 1200 Tower/3000 (T)/4000(T), then do not
