Swatch has come up with this new Universal Time or "Internet Time". It
divides the day in 1000 beats, so one beat is 1.44 minutes (1 min 26.4 secs)
long. The Internet Time doesn't have time zones or daylight savings time, so
@000 means it's midnight in Switzerland (which is GMT+1) and @500 means noon,
no matter where you are in the world. There's a more detailed (well, at least
a longer) description at {link http://www.swatch.com}http://swatch.com{end}

Personally, I think it's a load of b*****ks ;) It's as difficult to use in
practise as the euro currency (damn their eyes! :) whilst less useful. But
you still might want to know how much the Swatch time is, so here's a couple
utils.
{p} {p}
BeatIt opens a fixed-size window at your selected coordinates on the default
public screen, and displays the Swatch time using times.font size 24. It
takes your time zone from the "TZ" environment variable (to calculate the
"real" time in Switzerland) and you must set it yourself, it's just too bad
that many programs use the TZ variable but require a different format! :)
Well, as you can see, the window isn't high enough for the @ sign to fit in
properly, and the only thing you can adjust in BeatIt is the window position.
Well, at least you can close the window with an invisible close gadget in the
top left corner. BeatIt is coded in ACE, so you'll also get two Enforcer hits
at program startup :)
