Well, now that it looks like the new people at Amiga actually LISTEN to 
what we of the community complain about, I'm feeling more confident that 
maybe they might start reading a few of these articles and add in a few 
things. Or perhaps if you see a suggestion you like you might log it in
at the Amiga.org polls where they'll read it. So, it's with a bit more
confidence that I give the next installment in this series.

This month it's ports; those lovely little connections to the outside 
world trhat make our favorite computer the center of attention. Those
PC people (that's Piece of C***) make a big problem out of having enough
ports because of their reliance on IRQs and insane reluctance to just go 
SCSI and have done with all their problems. We don't have such
problems, so this affects the types of ports we really need.
{p} {p}
Parralel? Of course. No real need for the Extended Parrallel, because
of SCSI, but they can have it if that's what it'll take to get the most 
compatibility to what's out there.
{p} {p}
Serial? Put in two of them and make them fast. Phase 5 has a 
communication board for their Cyberstorm series that goes at about 2 
Mbaud, so why not something like that.
{p} {p}
Throw in a SCSI of whatever's the latest modern type, with internal and
external connectors. SCSI is best.
{p} {p}
IDE? Forget it. SCSI's better, IDE's a piece of junk. If you really
MUST have a piecxe of IDE equipment then get an extra add-on board.
{p} {p}
USB? A fad that the PCers need to get past their IRQ problem. Far too
fast for anything that you would normally hook up to a serial port, and
way too slow for any serious piece of equipment that you would need SCSI 
for.  Ever see a USB scanner? Slooooow. The only reason for a port
(and no reason for more than one, since they DO daisy chain) is for 
access to the USB-based equipment out there.
{p} {p}
Firewire. Now HERE's the port of the future, the one that is best for
taking the place of SCSI. This is a Must Have. Put one in.
{p} {p}
Getting past the normal range of monitor ports, extra floppy drive port
(hey, we're STILL the only computer out there that can have 4 floppies
so why not just keep it?), we're left with a type of port which is
perfect for the Amiga but sadly not built in.
{p} {p}
Video.
{p} {p}
The Amiga is the only machine out there that has a native video signal, 
yet amazingly has no built in ports to take advantage of this. You
still have to get an extra board to make use of this. The new Amigas
should have built in Video In and Video Out ports to directly process
video signals from TVs, VCRs, WebCams, and other video equipment. Nothing
fancy, just enough to power up a built in Genlock and capture the signal
for viewing in a window on the Workbench, or more complex manipulation
by other commercial packages.
{p} {p}
A last option would be an Audio In. If this new "Super Chip" is as
powerful as it's supposed to be, then add in a simple digital digitizer
to round things out; something you can plut in any standard microphone
or RCA audio cable from Radio Shack to. The Amiga is supposed to be
the original multimedia computer, so let's make it LOOK like one.
{p} {p}
That's it for this month. If you have any suggestions for things you'd
like to see in the new Amigas then just email me and I'll add it in to
a future article.
