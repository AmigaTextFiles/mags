GuidEd is a MUI-based AmigaGuide editor. You can load in any kind of AmigaGuide
document and edit it, or create new guides from scratch. In the main window you
see a list of currently open guides, and double-clicking a name will get you to
its node list, where you can set options for the guide file and add/delete/edit
nodes. Double-clicking a node will get you editing the text in that page and
also the options for that particular node. Both the options windows have lots
of options, even some undocumented ones (heck, there's probably all the options
that exist :).

Editing the text in the page is like any other editor, except that it's not your
favourite (I should imagine :) since it's just a MUI class :) You can see the
three basic text styles (bold, italic, underline) but the foreground/background
colors and even links show up as the same kind of text you would see with a
regular text editor. That's a really big flaw and until it's changed, GuidEd
isn't actually anything really special. Now it's like a regular text editor, it
just displays the options you have for AmigaGuides and shows the nodes separated
from the others and in a "clear" list. A plus for some people's needs is that
you can see & edit several nodes at the same time, even from different guide
files.

Still, GuidEd could be very useful for people who are just beginning with
AmigaGuide and don't want to actually learn the format, just make some guides :)
Except that there's no real documentation.. :-P Yeah, it says in the Usage part
of the guide: "This part of the guide is not yet started." So you need to be
familiar with making AmigaGuides already before you can use this, but you don't
want to use this if you are :) So, I suggest that everyone just learn the REAL
way of making AmigaGuides (it won't take long :) and use their favourite text
editors to write them, at least until GuidEd gets some comprehensive docs and
tutorials :)
