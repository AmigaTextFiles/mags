Just read the latest issue of AIO, and thought I'd mention a couple of
Amiga sites I work on.
{p} {p}
The first is MetalJoe's Amiga Pages:

{p} {p}
The second is that I write a monthly Amiga article for Suite101.com on
their Operating Systems section. You can find it at:

Hello,
{p} {p}
I have just gone through issue 22 of Aio, I have been reading this
fine mag for quite a while. It is simply one of the best info sources
around, and it is packaged in a very easy-to-use front end (GUI).
{p} {p}
I only have a couple of suggestions/ideas: First, I know that Aio is mainly
for news and reviews, but is there any chance of a tutorial series?? Maybe
"Arexx for the toatally STUPID" (Like how in the world do you address a
program, and then get information from it???) Or maybe, an easy-to-follow
tutorial on Directory Opus 5.11 or better....
{p} {p}
Finally, whatever program used to present Aio is simply fantastic!! Far
better than HTML or AmigaGuide could ever be. I have an 030/33 Amiga 500, so
I look for programs that are easy on my processor :) I can easily browse
Aio while running Dopus, a term. program, and about 25 or so assorted
utilities....
{p} {p}
And, is your software for Amiga Info Online Proprietary (ie, commercial, or
copyright??) Because, it would be perfect for an Amiga user to do an
interactive newsletter, or something. I live in the mid-west US, and Amiga
support DIED about 5 years ago; even the local user group is now just a
shell....
{p} {p}
It would be nice if the software for Aio could be used by an individual for
a reasonable fee......
{p} {p}
Rather sorry to hear about Amiga Format. (Especially since I subscribe!!!!)
{p} {p}
PLEASE, keep AIO going, for many of us, it's our only source of input for the
Amiga world....
{p} {p}
Thank you much, Peace and happiness.......

Thanks for your nice comments Marc, i'm glad you like our production and
we do aim to be one of the best magazines around so its good to see that
some our readers think this to.
{p} {p}
AIO is not restricted to just reviews, articles and news, I would like to
cater for all other aspects and offer tutorials on a range of products but
I think you can appreciate that AIO is run freely and so we don't always
have the same resources as the likes of Amiga Format or any other print
type magazine. I will definately look into this seriously and see what
I can do, in the mean time if anyone who is reading is interested in
helping out our readers by running a tutorial on Arexx, Dopus or anything
else for that matter please contact us at the usual address.
{p} {p}
The GUI for AIO makes it unique and if the GUI were to be used by other
magazines and documents then it would just fade into the background and
be "another one of those Linus Akesson guides". I have spoken to Linus
about this and he has no plans to release the GUI freely or for a fee.
{p} {p}
AIO will keep going for as long as our readers want it to. You can make
us continue by supporting us with your articles, reviews, news and letters
letting us know what you would like to see in AIO and what you currently
like or dislike.
{p} {p}
The current Amiga Format situation is not something to be sorry about
just yet but I see the readership figures for a mainstream magazine a
little worrying. AF keep telling its readers that it is run differently
to CU-Amiga and can cope with less readers, AF now has nearly half less
readers than CU did when it closed. CU-Amiga kept promissing that it
would stay alive for a very long time and look what happend to them...
{p} {p}
I am again glad you like our magazine and I honestly can assure you that
AIO will be staying open for as long as it is required to. We do not have
any profit margins to meet or do not need to have a certain amount of
readers to stay open. It is 100% freely run and we can't be loosing
money if we don't have any to start with.

Hi y'all :)
{p} {p}
  With regards to the recent interview with Petro, I'd like to raise the
issue of advertisement again.
{p} {p}
The first point is that in my opinion, the best form of advertisement
would be more of the merchandise that Amiga owners are proud to display
- if anybody used to buy CU Amiga they'll remember the stickers which
were planned to advertise the Amiga. Epic Marketing are also offering
free Amiga stickers, and all of this is a good thing. Amiga owners are
proud to stand out from the computer-using public and they're more than
willing to put stickers in their car windows, house, office, school etc.
If enough people start wearing 'Amiga' T-Shirts and slapping 'Amiga'
stickers all over their local town, eventually people will start to
wonder. What's this 'Amiga' thing? Wasn't that a crap computer from
years ago?
{p} {p}
  This brings me onto my second point. While it's all very well to get
the name out in public, it's got to mean something. The public's
curiosity will be aroused by the name 'Amiga' appearing everywhere - a
new washing powder? A type of breakfast cereal? A nutty religious group?
Once interest starts to build, it's important that AI do release
full-blown global advertising campaigns, especially in the UK which
seems to be missing quite a bit of the Amiga action - and there are a
hell of a lot of Amiga users in the UK. There is already quite a bit of
publicity on the 'net, so advertising there isn't a priority. Remember
that most 'net users don't own an Amiga and they'd just shrug off any
advertisments or banners. TV, radio and newspaper advertising, however,
would really show people that the Amiga means business. How about a take
on the Intel Inside adverts with our good old Intel Outside? While most
people wouldn't have a clue what the boing ball or Intel Outside etc.
meant, everybody likes to laugh at anything to do with Microsoft. It
would also give the exisiting Amiga 'cult' a boost.
With a few hundred £k AI could launch a pretty big campaing in the UK; a
seriously big campaign on just Radio/Newspapers nationally would cost
less than £100,000 and would make a big difference.

Thankyou for your very interesting letter which raises a number of points
that I fully agree with. The idea of arousing public awareness of the Amiga
before the actual new computer arrives is a very good idea indeed. Not so
long ago I remember an advert on british TV for one of the consoles or
console games that just had the words "Comming 24th April" or some certain
date that whatever it was was to be released. People wonder what it means
and talk about it. This type of advertising makes people want to find
out what the advert is about and will look out for the main advert at the
time of release. Then when the actual Amiga advert comes around people
will take notice of it and then more than likely want to see what the
computer does.
{p} {p}
Taking the idea a step further like you say by dropping hints with Amiga
stickers and T-Shirts is another blinding idea. Instead of having the
TV adverts wasting money that Amiga Inc/Int can't afford to waste doing the
work of arousing public awareness, we the users could do it. Sticking
an odd sticker or poster here and there in public places would do the
trick then a TV and Radio advert by Amiga can advertise the computer when
it is released.
{p} {p}
Some excellent ideas! If it would work or not is different altogether, you
could end up with one sticker on a telephone pole outside an Amiga users
house in the south and then nothing til the peeks of scotland, obviously
not alot of use.
{p} {p}
I do remember when on holiday in the south of england 2 or 3 years ago
seeing an Amiga sticker in the window of a house in Glastonbury which
caught my attention. Maybe the person who lives there is reading :) Write
in and let us know.
{p} {p}
I have a bit of news about Epic Marketing and the supposedly FREE amiga
stickers when purchasing one of the items like dust covers or boing ball
mouse mats. I bought a 14/15" Amiga logo dust cover and requested the
free sticker like it states. Three days later my dust cover arrives with
no sticker and no reason why not. Hmpf.

Hi Chris,
{p} {p}
I`ve just been looking at your latest edition on AIO and i must say that
I`m quite impressed mate. :)
{p} {p}
I`ve heard of AIO but I`ve only just got around to checking it out (AIO
21).  I haven`t bothered reading many online mags etc. for a while but
reading yours has given me a new found interest.
{p} {p}
Keep up the good work..!!!!
{p} {p}
Anyhow,  here is the URL from my own AMIGA support site.
{p} {p}

{p} {p}
 This site is still under major construction but I`d be grateful if you
could add it to your mag for me.
{p} {p}
Cheers.
