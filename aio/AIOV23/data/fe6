Well, it appears that the new Amiga management is true to it's word.  A
feat which would be a first in the Amiga's troubled history. The gist
of what I've gleaned from reports and IRC conferences is summarized here
to help everyone out there keep up to date on what Amiga is up to.
{p} {p}
First, they will be having monthly IRC conferences. They've already had
two this last month, which is more than the past three companies put
together have had.
{p} {p}
Also, it appears that they Do read the poles taken at the Amiga.org
site to keep up  on what the community thinks. So fill out those poles
because Amiga IS watching.
{p} {p}
There will also be a regular newsletter called Amiga Insight that will
soon be up on amiga.com. It will be filled with regular updates on
what's happening and new developments.
{p} {p}
Add to that a couple of web cams being installed in the new San Diego
offices and things are looking pretty rosey.
{p} {p}
So, keep ythe faith, this time it's for real.

PS: Oh, and did I mention they've hired a prominenbt design company to
make sure the new Amigas LOOK good as well?
