Well, looks like Spring's finally here (at least here in the Northern
Hemisphere), and if it isn't where you live, then I'll be glad to send
you a picture of a good old California Spring day. In keeping with the
sunnier weather, this month's selection of sites are all basically
light-hearted, fun, and/or amusing. So read on and have some fun.

Nothing really for graphics here, this is a single text-based page that
is fun in it's own right. From the sublime to the mundane, the witty to
the stupid, this is about the largest collection of actual quotes said
by real people that you'll probably ever find. Download it and save it
to a file, it'll make for a great reference.

We all know about Smilies, use them all the time in online conversation.
But have you ever realized just how many different Smilies there are?
Well now you can find out. This site lists an unnatural number of
Smilies, categorized into six basic types for you convenience, from
Basic to Usenet, Midget to Mega. So, get a copy of this page on hand
next time you're online with someone and start annoying them with
Smilies no one's ever seen before.

People say and do plenty of stupid things, and here's the place to
proove it. A site full of true stories about the stupid people among us,
from bank robbers that try to make their get-away by hailing a cab, to
real headlines that just don't sound quite right ("Stock up and Save,
Limit one."). Divided up into categories such as Criminals, Roommates,
Laws, Lawsuits, and several more, it's all rather funny and good for
making you feel that you're better than at least a few hundred people
out there. If in doubt, there's even a test to determine if you're
stupid.

If you like collecting good art from the net (I have single every Boris
picture on my own hard drive), then thgis is the place. With links to
over 700 artists and galleries that cover the range of science fiction,
fantasy, space, and surreal art, you won't find anything more complete.
The links are alpabetized and broken up into sub-pages for each letter
so you won't be overloaded by a never ending page trying to load. Check
it out; you'll be downloading pics until the next AIO.

Okay, so this AIO is out a bit too late for April's Fool, but I just 
couldn't resist. This is a page with practical jokes enough to cover the
rest of the year anyhow and is guarrenteed to give yoiu a chuckle at a 
friend's expense.

You've got several options here to choose from, be it on online joke
or, web page, or something through snail mail. The following run-down
should give you an idea of the large amount of free time the designers
of this page apparently have.
{p} {p}
Bogus web pages. You can have someone run a Y2K compliancy test on their
PC, or an interactive page for Real Online Pychics that'll make them
think there's some real psychics out there.  Or perhaps give someone a
notice of a web page where their name is mentioned as a Netkid of the
month.
{p} {p}
Fake Mail. Official looking notices and letters delivered anonymously
by the US Postal service. Stool sample request, nude lawn-mowing sifety
tips, or perhaps an organ donation request (live organ transplants,
anyone?). These are only a few of the many possibilities. This one has
a fee but it does deliver outside the US.
{p} {p}
Fake post cards. Want them to think you're on vacation from someplace
exotic? Just send them a phoney postcard.
{p} {p}
Rounding out is a look-up service for tracking down the email address of 
your intended target. Add in a few links for getting humorous cards from 
RubberChicken.Com and some related books from same, and this is one site 
that will spark some great tomfoolery.
