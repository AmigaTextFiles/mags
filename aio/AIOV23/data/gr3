PuttySquad as you may remember was meant to be released many moons ago
in the Amiga failing year of 1994 by System 3. This unfortunally never
happend even though the game was complete, sort of like the TFX situation.
The years past by and we arrive in the year 1999. Over 4 years on an
Putty Squad is to be released, yes those excellent people at Alive
Mediasoft have done it again. A classic game has been brough from the
graves and given a chance, a chance that System 3 decided not to give
it. Firstly well done Alive Mediasoft!

For those of you who don't know Putty stared in an earlier game to which
this is the sequal. The game if I remember correctly was simply called
Putty which contain a little star called Putty, the game was a platform
game which was not rare back in the good old days of the Amiga. Then came
Putty Squad.

Upon loading Putty Squad you will be taken back by the colour graphics
and bouncy music that one day all games contained, back to a simpler
life with excellent gameplay and amazingly colour graphics. The title
screen is very nicely drawn and it is good to see a drawn screen instead
of these flashy rendered screens of today. I don't have anything against
3D graphics, they look excellent but nothing can compete with some lovely
drawn cartoon graphics.

Once you have started the game you are thrust into an unreal world where
you take control of the main player, Putty. Putty is named and taken
I guess from the old childs toy, 'Silly Putty' which people has hours
of fun with. Putty is exactly the same which means that he can pull
of a number of tricks and moves. The little blue blob can jump, walk,
duck, punch, stretch downwards and sideways plus a whole host of other
positions that you could never pull of in a human body.

As with all platformers you go around bashing enemys, collecting gems,
or stars in this case and genrally letting of steam, no thought is
envolved for most of the time and you can just sit back and relax
while playing a great game.

From what I have seen so far Putty Squad looks like a blinding game,
excellent graphics, and outstanding music make this game a classic
and something I miss these days. Way back in 1994 this game may not
have stood a chance because of the many other platform games that
ruled the market at the time. Now we see very little games and hardly
any platform games so it is nice to see something new in todays
Amiga games market. The game maybe 4 years old but it still has the
quality that every game should. A superb game that I just can't wait
to review fully.
