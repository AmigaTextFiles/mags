Welcome to issue 23. This issue I'm just so excited because over the
last few weeks I have been putting together the registered web domain
for AIO. Thanks to Conor Kerr we can bring you the new website for
AIO even quicker than expected. I would like to thank everyone who
donated to this site and the names of these great people can be read
in the press release in the news section this issue, or, of course
on our new site.

If this is the first you have heard about the new site then I can tell
you from today 24th April, 1999. The site is fully online and working
95%. Please visit the site now at,

The site is basically the same but I have decided to make it alot
more interesting and add new features to make it worth visiting. With
the old site it was just a case of visiting it once a month to
download the latest issue or read some slow news updates. If you
have already visited the site you will see that today alone we have
uploaded 4 news articles all of importance and any other new news
we have to tell you will go on the site instantly.
{p} {p}
Aswell as being able to bring you the most up to date news we are
also able to add some new features which I mentioned above. These are
just the start to what could be a very interesting part to the AIO
web site. Firstly the new features that will be updated regularly
with come under the Misc menu which can be clicked on by visiting
the site and pressing the button titled 'misc' in the left frame.
In this section you will find the new areas, the first area contains
all the interviews ever to appear in AIO from issue 1. As we hold
more interviews they will go stright online before they even appear
in the latest issue and then will follow in the up and coming issue.
The second area so far is the readers letters section which displays
all the emails and post we get. For various reasons we do not print
all the letters we receive in the magazine each month but from now
on they will all go online hours after being receive. So send us a
letter now and you will see your name in lights moments later. The
last section for the moment is under construction, this will in the
end be a global survey for AIO and non-AIO readers to fill in to
vote for your favourite companies and which ones you think are best.
At the end we will award these companies and people with awards to
show that the Amiga users recognise them. I will keep you informed
on the progress of this.

With the advent of the new web domain it also brings us unlimited
email addresses on the aio.co.uk domain which will be used to there
full advantage, this already means some addresses have changed which
we have listed below to make contacting AIO even easier and make
our life easier and save alot of hastle of determining which area
things are best suited. Don't worry the old addresses are still working
it is just better to use the below addresses.

Some sad news this month is that Renne will be stepping down from the
position as Utilities Editor and as yet we have no replacement, this
means that if you are interested in becoming the AIO Utilities Editor
you should email me at, {bold}chris@aio.co.uk{nobold} as soon as possible to let me
know. If you have any example reviews or reasons that you would suite
the Utilities Editor position then please also send them along.

The GUI has changed slightly this issue in that Linus our programmer
has added jump scroll to the scrolling. This means if you have an
article that takes up more than one window you can press shift and
up/down cursor keys to jump up/down a screen thus giving faster
scrolling.
{p} {p}
Please remember to visit our new site and let us know what you would
like to see feature on it. We are also looking for more of your
letters so don't forget to scrible your ideas down and send them off
to, {bold}letters@aio.co.uk{nobold}

A matter close to my own heart is my birthday on the {bold}7th May{nobold}. If you
would like to make my day and wish me a happy birthday then you can
send all greetings to, {bold}chris@aio.co.uk{nobold}

Lastly I would like to wish Renne good luck and i'm sure you are all
aware of the hard work he has put in for the issues he has filled the
position of Utilities Editor. Thankyou again Renne!
