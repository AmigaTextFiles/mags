Anoid is yet another Arkanoid clone, "oh no" I hear you all cry and yes
I did say this myself. The problem with Arkanoid clones is that they
are all the same. You can try and try but you will never change anything
radical to make an Arkanoid game something else.

Saying this so far Anoid makes a pretty good attempt at being a good
game, the graphics are well drawn and the music is fast paced to keep
you going. One thing I liked about this version is that the ball
has gravity on it so it does not just go up and down like other versions,
it floats about giving it a more strange feel, like it actually is
a real ball.

The basic idea is Arkanoid unfortunally. This for newbies means
you have a bat at the bottom of the screen and have to hit blocks by
bouncing a ball up and down, once clearing all block you will move to
the next level. There are various power ups and special bonuses to
make your bat do the usual things like expand or stick. I really
wanted to like this game because it is obvious to see that the author
has put alot of work into the game by having interesting music and
graphics aswell as having the nice gravity option. This is not the
case...

As I have said the graphics are nice and the music is good. The only
problem is the game is basically still Arkanoid, its a lovely game
but i've just seen to many of these to keep me interested. I suggest
to the author to keep going but try making a game that had a more
original feel, the author certainly has the talent, its just a shame
that to many bad clones spoilt the Arkanoid clone market. Yes, I am
'anoid' with the amount of these games ;)
