Hellshot is described as a "This is funny arcade game, based on the very
old principle of Scorched Tanks. Found on Atari consoles and arcade
machines." - Yes as well as a great version on the Amiga. Anyway the
game is based around Scorched Tanks as it states but not with tanks,
instead they are replaced with people. You leave your house with arm
with a firing machine and some rocks (?!). The basic idea is to keep
hold of fire until you get to a certain place, let go and fire your
rock. You can take out the other player, superman and a massive range
of other objects that shoot around the sky blocking your way.

The game itself isn't outstanding but is funny in a strange kind of
way. The graphics are nothing to shout about but do nicely for a game
like this. The overall feel of the game is quite nice, the only
problem with it is the power gauge is a bit strange to figure out.
It will go up to different amounts but seems to be fired accross the
screen a huge amount everytime. If you let the bar stay under half
way then nothing will fire at all. Maybe I couldn't play the game
properly but it really did let it down.

If I could figure the gauge then this game would be brilliant and
last for years but unfortunally as I couldn't work the gauge I can't
honestly say it was that playable. By all means take a look, its good
for a laugh and some of the people you can hit are a nice touch. Try
it, you may like it.
