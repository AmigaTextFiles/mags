Hello to all,
{p} {p}
Finally after many months of hard work, Keith - our web designer - has
finshed the all new Alive mediasoft web site. When I say finished I mean
it's up and ready but you can expect to see the rest of the reviews and
pictures to be added over the next few weeks. We are very keen to keep the
page as up-to-date as possible so you can guarantee constant upgrades
featuring the latest news as it breaks as well as full information and
screenshots as games are announced. The catalogues will be updated daily so
you can rest assured that the price lists are also correct.
{p} {p}
We will also feature a monthly "Top Ten Sellers" list. There are also demos
available for download of every Alive product.
{p} {p}
You may have heard about Alive's "Millenium Vote" to decide the best Amiga
games of this millenium. Full details and a voting form can be found on the
site.
{p} {p}
There's also exciting news about Alive's new service to go with the launch
of our new site and details of the new look CD Catalogue V1.3.
{p} {p}
And as if all that's not enough, there is a form available to order your
FREE subscription to Alive's 20 page catalogue/magazine - The Pulse.
{p} {p}
If you have a link on your web site please add the Alive page to the link.
We are working on our own contacts page and would be happy to feature any
Amiga companies in our list.
