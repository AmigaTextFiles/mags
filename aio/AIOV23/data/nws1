There are reports from the major Amiga news services that Corel Office has
been secured by Amiga Inc. for porting the Amiga2 (which is known as the
Amigasoft operating system, as AIO reported last month).

The reports are based on an article that apparently appeared in the
Com-Digit Journal magazine for March 1999.

This is good news and it seems likely to be true, as some of the Amiga Inc.
employees are responsible for creating the deal for Gateway to ship PCs with
Corel Office for Windows.
