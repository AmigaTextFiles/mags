For Immediate Release: 24.4.99
{p} {p}
Amiga Information Online has now moved its web site to a registered web
domain in the UK. You can find this new site by visiting www.aio.co.uk
{p} {p}
The old site (www.amiga1.demon.co.uk/aio) will act as a forwarding
service to people who have the old address.
{p} {p}
I hope you all try this new site and see the speed improvements it
brings. It is now also alot easier to remember and will of course attract
alot more readers. Over the next few months AIO plans a big advertising
blitz in all the Amiga print magazines to advertise AIO itself and also
the new web site.
{p} {p}
The latest issue of Amiga Information Online (issue 22) can now be
downloaded from our new site, www.aio.co.uk - It has an interview with
Petro Tyschtschenko aswell as some other interesting articles, news items
and all the latest games and utilities reviews.
{p} {p}
Also over the next few months we aim to update the site and make it much
better than it is at the moment. We are going to put ALL the interviews
online that have featured in AIO since its opening in May 1997. If you
have any ideas or suggestions on what you think should go on this new
site then please let us know at the usual address, amiga@thefree.net

I would like to thank some people who without this registered site would
not be possible and people who have helped in the process of getting to
this stage. Firstly I'd like to thank all the editorial team of AIO, past
and present who have helped me bring a publication to many readers all
over the world. I would like to thank Chris Brown for hosting the current
site, even though he did slow on updates a bit to the end and also to
Andrew Crowe who created the web site which I have hacked to bits and
added various areas. I would like to thank Conor Kerr who will be getting
the registered domain for me and the work he has done to bring it to
life.
{p} {p}
Last but not least I would like to give great thanks to the people who
believed in AIO enough to donate which without again we would not be
seeing the domain today, these great people are, Malcolm Harnden, Ian
Urie, Stuart Walker, Andrew Cashmore, Paul Steadman, Gerald Hobbs and
Raynald Le Moing.
