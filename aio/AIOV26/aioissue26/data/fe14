Well it's Part 3 and this month we're going over a few of the more
useful addons available for DOpus. Not just things that will interface
with your favorite program or CD Player, but the types that become a
nearly integral part of your DOpus workday. These are little scripts
and modules that you will find nearly impossible to get along without.
{p} {p}
The first one is ArcDir.Dopus5, available on Aminet by Edmund Vermeulen
({bold}edmundv@xs4all.nl{nobold}). I'll leave the installation for the docs (nothing
too brain bending) but once set up, when you double click on an LHA or
LZX archive it brings up the archive's contents in a standard DOpus
lister. This allows you to do the full copy/move/view/read/whatever to
any files in the archive through the same methods as other normal
listers. Definitely more convenient, especialluy if you're like me and
download stuff from Aminet nearly every day. There is an updated
version of the program by  Frédéric Falempin ({bold}spectref@minitel.net{nobold})
that adds in suppport for ZIP and TGZ archives as well, but I'm not sure
if that's been uploaded to Aminet yet; you may have to email someone
about it.

Opus CutnPaste is another handy one for day to day use, available on
Aminet or at {link http://www.halsteadk.freeserve.co.uk/cutnpaste}http://www.halsteadk.freeserve.co.uk/cutnpaste{end}. This one adds in
an additional menu item when you click on the edge of your lister for
the pop-up menu. Starting with Copy and Cut, it will act on the file
highlighted, cutting or copying it to Clipboard. After that, you go to
whichever other lister you want, make it Source, and his the lister
pop-up menu again. Now you'll see a few added things like Paste, Paste
As, View Clipboard, and Clear Clipboard. All self explanatory and rather
good for adding yet another way of moving your files around.
{p} {p}
Finally, everyone's RAM: tends to get cluttered from time to time,
usually from unarchiving files. While it's possible to go to RAM: with a
lister and then manually highlight every files that isn't T:, ENV:, or
Clipboards:, a script can make things easier.  There are two scripts
out there for this. CleanRam'dopus, by Mark Dyer
({bold}mark@permaban.demon.co.uk{nobold}), will take the current Source lister, switch
it to RAM:, highlight everything that isn't the above three directories
or their icon files, and offer you the chance to have it delete them or
not, giving you the chance to un-select any files you don't want to
keep. After it deletes the files, it returns your Source lister to the
original directory that it was viewing.
{p} {p}
The other Ram-clearing script is ClearRAM v1.1 by Steve "Lightning" Masterson. Same
sort of function but without all the bells and whistles; it just simply
deletes everything in RAM: not connected with T:, ENV:, or Clipboards:.
In fact, it's just a one-line script you could probably figure out
yourself.
{p} {p}
These are some basic essentials you should look into, all of which are
available on Aminet, and all with complete docs and easy enough to
install.

One little add-on written in about by reader {bold}Colin Clark{nobold} is CycleMode by D.Clarke
({link http://home.connexus.net.au/~4wd/}http://home.connexus.net.au/~4wd/{end}). Basically it allows you a hot-key
that will cycle from List Mode to Icon Mode to Icon Action Mode for a
given lister everytime the hot-key is pressed. A nice little convenience
if you don't want to right mouse button it all the time, though there
is a slight delay as it calls up and runs the script everytime you
press the hot-key.
