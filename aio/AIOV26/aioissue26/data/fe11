· · David Curtis{p}
Director of Object Technology and Transaction Services
{p} {p}
Director of Object Technology and Transaction Services David Curtis,
is responsible for the development of the Internet-based transactional
services that support Amiga's products. Prior to joining Amiga, Mr.
Curtis was Director  of Enterprise Technology at Inprise, a leading
supplier of distributed object and  transactional infrastructure
technology.  Previously, David was Director of Platform Technology
for the Object Management  Group, the leading international software
consortium for developing standards for distributed systems. Mr.
Curtis managed the OMG platform technology adoption process,
providing architectural direction, and leadership in building
industry-wide consensus. Before joining the OMG, Mr. Curtis was
Vice President of Engineering and Chief Technology Officer at
Expersoft, an early leader in the field of distributed object
technology. He was the designer and architect for the Expersoft
software product line, which included the award-winning PowerBroker
ORB product. Mr. Curtis is the primary author of several key OMG
standards for distributed computing, including the IIOP protocol
standard, the specification for interworking between Microsoft's
DCOM environment and the CORBA environment. Most recently, he has
authored the abstract component model and implementation framework
for CORBA Components, an emerging standard for component-based
server development. Mr. Curtis is the co-author of "Integrating
CORBA and COM Applications" (Wiley Computer Publishing), and is
currently working on a book describing the architecture of the CORBA
Component Model.

· · Dr. Jim Miller{p}
Director of User Experience R&D
{p} {p}
Dr. Jim Miller, Director of User Experience R&D, has worked in the
field of human-computer interaction for over 17 years. He has
specialized in the development of interactive systems that provide
exceptional creative power to their users, while maintaining
exceptional ease of use. Prior to joining Amiga, Jim was doing
consulting on the design and evaluation of the user interface
components of desktop software and  Internet products, and was
involved in startup activities in the area of consumer Internet
technology. Previously, Jim was the program manager for Intelligent
Systems at  Apple's Advanced Technology Group, where he led a number
of research projects on human-computer interaction and intelligent
interfaces,  especially those involving agents and assistants,
speech, and natural  language processing. Here, as elsewhere, much
of his work was focused in supporting technology transfer between
research and product  development teams. The result of one such
collaboration, Apple Data Detectors, is available at
{link http://www.apple.com/applescript/data_detectors}http://www.apple.com/applescript/data_detectors{end}. Some of his other
interests include the ongoing convergence of computation and
consumer technologies, the creation of distributed networked
communities, and  the evaluation methods for interactive systems.
Prior to joining Apple, Dr. Miller was the manager of the
Human-Computer  Interaction Department in Hewlett-Packard
Laboratories, and a project leader in human-computer interaction at
MCC (Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation). Jim has
a Ph.D. and an M.S. in  Psychology from the University of
California, Los Angeles, and a B.S. in Social Science-Computer
Science from Michigan State University.  Jim is also active in
SIGCHI, the ACM's special interest group for human-computer
interaction. He was co-chair of the 1992 CHI  conference, and was
elected chair of SIGCHI in 1993. Currently, he  sits on the SIGCHI
Executive Committee as Past Chair, and is also a member of the
organization's Conference Management Committee.

· · Dr. Richard Lipes{p}
Director of Multimedia Services
{p} {p}
Dr. Richard Lipes, Director of Multimedia Services, is responsible
for delivering 2D and 3D graphics, audio and video streams, and
special graphics effects for Amiga's products. He has over 20 years
experience in high performance computation on graphics, vector, and
parallel computer architectures, gained in large organizations as
well as three startups.
{p} {p}
Prior to joining Amiga, Dr. Lipes was director of software
development at ARK Logic, responsible for design, development, and
maintenance of all software for 2D and 3D graphics accelerators. The
accelerator drivers supported both OpenGL and DirectX technologies.
He was previously at Silicon Graphics where he worked on Project
Reality, which produced the highly successful Nintendo 64 Gaming
system and on Magic Carpet, a project for delivering MPEG-2 audio and
video, AC3 audio, and 3D graphics to set-top boxes and network
computers. Earlier, as director of imaging software at Kubota
Pacific, he was responsible for medical imaging software that
supported 2D and volumetric rendering of key medical modalities.
{p} {p}
Dr. Lipes received his S.B. from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and his Ph.D. from Caltech, both in physics. He is a
member of the Association for Computing Machinery and the IEEE. He
has served on the board of directors of the Caltech Alumni
Association.
