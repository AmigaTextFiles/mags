 July 9, 1999 - San Diego, California. Amiga has selected Linux as the OS kernel
for the new Amiga Operating Environment that is scheduled for release later this
year.   Amiga is selecting Linux after several months of evaluating the
technical progress of the OS and the tremendous industry support that Linux has
gained.

The development community has given Linux a major endorsement and the momentum
that Linux now enjoys is having a significant impact on the computer industry.
There are a large number of hardware device drivers and software applications
written for Linux already and this number is growing daily.

"Our strategy for implementing the new Amiga is to integrate the best technology
in the industry into a new, efficient, exciting and revolutionary computer
platform focused on the future' said Jim Collas, President and CEO of Amiga.
"Using Linux as our OS kernel is only one component of the overall Amiga
Operating Environment.'
