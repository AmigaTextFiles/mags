GHN is a little tool to retrieve HTML files from servers and convert them to
a text file. It's very useful if you want to read different News Sites offline,
like Yahoo Lycosm InfoSeek etc.

It's very easy to use, just setup one or more config files and start it. It will
then either perform on just one config file, or all of them, your choice. After
that it will start download and convert.{p}
But there is a bad thing to, it's quite slow for modem users, and it doesn't say
when it's finished the download so you can't disconnect until it's finnished with
the convertion.

The configuration is simple, just enter the URL, where in the file to start/stop and
some other stuff...

One great thing is that this tool is CLI based, no GUI. And for a tool that's this
small, it's just plain stupid to have a GUI.
