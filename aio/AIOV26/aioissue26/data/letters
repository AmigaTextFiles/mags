    Hi...My name it's jose azevedo and i am writing cause I LOVE always and
forever Amiga, but unfortunally here in Portugal almost nobody uses an
Amiga.{p}
    Firstival I like to thanks to all of you and beg for apologise cause i
not have a good english and for this long letter....i think you are (like
Amiga's) simply the best...{p}
    I am using a Pc, through the Net, but in my Room i have 2 Amiga's - 1200
and an Amiga Cd 32...{p}
    I am so unhappy cause i loved my first Amiga 500, but i sold it to buy
A1200, but my confusion started in there...First i ask for my friends who
know's better Amigas than me, if is possible to mount an HD in 1200...they
say me yes, and the next question was if it's possible to mount a Cd in it
too... the same question yes...{p}
    More and more and i finish to mount an HD 120 Mg and Cd 4 speed, more
memory ( i think 32 mg) and for finish a coprocess 68030 for Blizzard...{p}
    Now i rarely use this computer cause I do not know how to use the
software in there...and i think it's Workbench 3.1.{p}
    My 2nd A1200 it's stoped and it's in a box...no extra ram, no extra Hd
...no nothing..{p}
    My ACD32...it's no nothing too... :-({p}
    But know...i remember to search through the Net and I find you !!! For
God Sake !!{p}
In the last year i was in London, but unfortunally i didn't found nothing
about Amigas !! it is possible ??? Now i think, I am seeing a little light
at the end of the tunnel, and I am totally surprised to found you...{p}
    My friends told me that with the A1200 I can't play games that I love so
much, like shadow of the beast 1,2,3...Hybris...and so many others that i
never forget...because A1200 it's 100 % compatible with A500...there is
anyway to make it 100 % compatible ?? there is anyway to i learn how to
Install a great operating system in the Amiga 1200 with the HD ??{p}
    How operating System you invite me to buy ?? And A500 converter ?? It is
possible to me for have great pleasure like in the golden days ?? Could you
give to me some adresses to buy Games, demos, cd's for Amiga ??{p}
    I was buying Amiga Format, CU Amiga, but unfortunally the sales man told
me that magazines have finished....is it true ?? I only have lot's of Cd's
for those mags, but unfortunally i can't explore them 100 %, why....probs
with my Workbench ??{p}
    I saw in those Cd's things like Mui, MagicWB, and more lots of  things
but i do not know how to operate them...could you tell me why ??{p}
    I also saw Directory opus...it was a friend of mine that install those
thing in there, but unfortunally it missed in the pallette (i think it is in
the Hd), but i think if you could help me maybe i can format the Hd and
start for myself since the beggining, cause when i buy all the extra things
for my A1200, i gave it to my best friend to him install me Workbench,
Directory Opus...and more things for Cd's mags, cause my lack of time. But
for me, Amiga it's like a drug and i cannot forget never it, but please,
please, please.... HELP ME !!!!!!!
{p} {p}
Sorry for this long and terrible letter, but i miss Amiga so much.... I am
like a Desesperated person....sorry....
{p} {p}
A big Hug...very very Big... !!!

See ya !!!{p}
