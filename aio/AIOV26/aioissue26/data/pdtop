There where some people that voted, but I hoped that it would be more
than 13! So, please just take a minute or two to vote for your three
favourite utilities! Who knows, it might be that {bold}YOU{nobold} find a util that
you never thought could be that handy, and someone else might also find
some new utils! Now please show Your support!
{p} {p}
To send Your votes, send a mail to {bold}lorens@aio.co.uk{nobold} with the subject: {bold}AIO Toplist{nobold}

Not many followed this, but I don't mind, it's just that my little
script that proccessed the votes didn't find the votes by itself! :-(
{p} {p}
If you vote, you must choose three utilities, you will give 3 points to
the one you like the most, 2 points to the second, and 1 point to the third!
{p} {p}
Hope you will enjoy this list, and the next one in the magazine will
probably not show the utilities that only got one vote, the list is
beginning to be too long! But check it out on {link http://www.aio.co.uk}http://www.aio.co.uk{end}, it will be there soon!
