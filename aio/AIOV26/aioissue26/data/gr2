SameGame was a small file which I noticed on the Aminet and was the
reason why I downloaded it. In an archive of only 7k lays an lovely
game that will entertain most people

At first I thought the game would be terrible because of the size. The
game features many options which you can alter in the tooltypes. Most
of which include where you want the game to open, on the WB, on its
own private screen or on any named public screen. For best viewing I
opened it on the original set in its own private screen as it will
give full colours as shown in the picture at the bottom of the review.

The idea is simple. You have a board full of coloured balls.... waits
as the reader laughs childisly ;) - which you have to match and click
to make them be removed. The game really tells you which balls can
be removed because it will group them with ticks and all you have to
do is click. I played it for quite a long time and none of the time
I couldn't not win.

It seems really easy to me because the computer shows you what you can
and cannot do and by the time you are at the last balls they all seem
to match up anyway so you complete it. The game is really a thinking
mans game because the more balls you remove together the more points
you get and this is how the game works. It is a who can get the higest
score type of game.

Overall its a nice puzzle game for those who like puzzle games. If you
want something small but interesting then download this. The graphics
look great even though basic and the actual downloading time will be
a few seconds due to its size. On the other hand if you don't have the
time to think or won't be bothered then this isn't the game for you.
