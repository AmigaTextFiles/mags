WBBump is a tool, NOT A HACK, that puts a bumpmapped logo on your WB screen.
The lightsource is the mouse. If you don't understand what it is, then think
of some eyes that follows the mousepointer, this is a picture, and it lights
up towards the mouse.

It's very easy to install this tool, just put your favourite in
WBStartup, or run it whenever you want! But you need to Assign WBBump: first!
You can draw your own pictures too, if you want. WBBump even has two clocks,
one that shows the normal time, and one that shows the Internet Time (Swatch
Beats).

If you have a CPU meter then you will see that it uses all your CPU power, but
WBBump has a priority so other programs comes in first hand, which means, this
will not slow down your system. It also supports Cybergraphics and Picasso96!

There are many ways of configure it, and the Guide describes all of them very
deep, it's not at all hard to understand!
