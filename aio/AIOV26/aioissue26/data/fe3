Note from the Articles Editor: Oops! It appears that someone (looking
around innocently) accidentally forgot to send the June web article to
Chris along with the rest of the Articles section and Chris didn't find
out in time to tell me. I am Really sorry about this but the web sites
reviewed still work.  So, for those that missed them, here is the original
article...

Well, June/July and with it summer for us in the northern hemisphere (sorry
Australia). Since Summer is a light-heart time, included you'll find a
few light-hearted sites. Some humor, music, and art to lighten your
Summer nights. Enjoy!

To quote the web site, imagine if you could pick any two people to get
in a fight- fictional or real- who would it be? Ever want to see if
Popeye could beat up Mike Tyson? Or Calista Flockhart vs food? Well,
each month two contestants are chosen, each side argued for and
against in a heated debate (read as: mud-slinging name calling), and
then the final decision left up to a vote of the web site viewers (that's
you). Now if only they had this on Cable...

Another good web-art source, categorized into icons, bullets (a
Smile-face bullet anyone), animations (600+), clipart, backgrounds, and
bars, with further sub-categorizations making browsing easy. If you're
into these then you can't have too many web art sources, and this one's
pretty darn good.

A great Amiga nostalgia site, though it conentrates primarily on music.
Want to get some of those old mods made in some bizzare format? Want to
Play said format? Then here is where to find them; thousands of tunes
that date back to the C64 days! Add in a growing section featuring some
classic utils, games, and art (a kickstart pic from WB 1.1 days anyone?)
and it's definitely worth a check.

Humor Archives{p}

{p} {p}
Twenty megabytes of 57 uncompressed files all devoted to humor.
Categorized in everything from Babylon 5 and Star Trek, to computers,
politics, and lists, it's good for a few hours of amusement while you're
downloading that big Phantom Menace trailer.

Ever wonder about the supposed basic intelligence of our elected
officials? Ever figure the hamster's dead in that little squirrel-cage
they call a brain? Want proof?
{p} {p}
Well, here it is. A web site devoted to actual laws still on the books.
Laws that go past the rare occurance of amusement to wondering if all
the world's a sitcom. Categorized by country and State (for here in the
USA), there must be thousands of of laws out there that have been made
dumb by the passage of time (some are a century old), or the passage of
a brain cell or two in the guy that wrote it.

To site just a few...
{p} {p}
Baldwin Park California: Nobody is allowed to ride a bicycle in a
swimming pool.
{p} {p}
Arkansas: Arkansas must be pronounced "Arkansaw"{p}
The Arkansas River can rise no higher than to the Main Street bridge
in Little Rock.
{p} {p}
England (This one's {italic}really{noitalic} outdated): All English Men over 14 are meant
to carry out 2 hours (or so) of longbow practice a week supervised by
the local clergy. [-ed Ahhh, so thats what i've been doing in my
spare time!]
{p} {p}
Chelsea Pensioner may not be impersonated (one of you people over in
England want to explain this one to me?)
{p} {p}
China: Drivers of power-driven vehicles who stop at pedestrian crossings
are liable to a fine of up to five yuan, or a warning. -Article 40 of
the Beijing Traffic Laws (Crosswalks must be used as target zones then).
{p} {p}
You get the idea; I could go on like this for pages. Check this site
out, it should be good for laughs for most of the summer.
