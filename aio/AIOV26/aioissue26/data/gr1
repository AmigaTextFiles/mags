WBPerplexity is a simple WB puzzle game in which you have to rearrange
a picture which has been split into a certain amount of sections. In
the case of this game that amount of sections is {bold}8{nobold} with one left
over square in which you can move your 8 pieces in and out of.

I'm sure most of you will know what I'm on about because its a very
simple idea but has been made into an addictive WB game. Those of you
who have been reading AIO for a while will probably know I am a fan of
most WB games that are half good and this one is great!

The idea is you have a picture split into 8 pieces and by moving or
sliding the pieces into and out of the empty spot you can recreate the
whole picture. Very simple idea but it makes for a challenging game and
a very addictive one at that.

This is one of the better WB games I have seen and will take into account
256 colour WB etc. Although I like this game there are some features
missing but some extra features added in. I really like the way you can
just drag and drop any picture as long as it is of required size and
you are then allowed to play with that picture.

See above I scaled the AIO issue 26 title screen down to 153x153 and
dropped it in the WBPerplexity window where in a few seconds it loads it
in and splits it into 8 sections. Excellent!

Although this is a great feature there are some features lacking that
I would like to see in future versions. Firstly you do get a time and
'how many moves you have taken so far' counter but for these you have
to goto the Puzzle Info screen in the menu. I would have liked to see
an updating timer and moves counter on screen at the same time to keep
tabs without the need to check by going to a menu option. The next small
feature that is missing is that when you load the picture in it doesn't
show you a quick version of what the completed picture should look like.
In 8 sections you can normally tell what is what but on some of the more
harder pictures it could be a problem.

The actual archive you download includes 10 pre-made puzzles for you to
play around with. All can be loaded in easily through a menu option. The
screens that come with it are, Default (E9 Logo), Climber, Gromit,
Jennifer, Prodigy, Snorkeling, Snowman, Sumo, Visions and Wallace. I
did enjoy putting together Jennifer Aniston <Wink>, <Wink>!

Overall this is a really enjoyable game. It has some great features and
gives endless possibility with the option to beable to make your own
puzzles. It does however lack a few options which denies it from receiving
an AIO Gold award. If the author adds a few ideas suggested earlier I'll
be more than happy to review the new version and most likely award it
AIO Gold. Brilliant work!

Look out for some puzzles by me on the aminet in {bold}game/data{nobold} in the next
few weeks.
