Review by Lorens Johansson

{p} {p}

YAM is, as the name may reveal to the smart ones, a mailer for the Amiga!
YAM Let's you send and receive E-Mails over the internet, and it has alot of other
great features.
{p} {p}
First of all, to be able to use YAM, you will need a POP3 mailprovider, this is the
server which you connect to and send/recieve your mails. Usually you will get a
POP3 account along with your Internet connection.
{p} {p}
{bold}The installation:{nobold}{p}
After you have downloaded the desired archives (Only the main archive is required!)
the installation procedure can start. And it will go very smoothly, only asking you
about the stuff that you have downloaded. There shouldn't be any problems at all.
As of now, YAM doesn't come in very many languages, but I can bet that there will
come a few on Aminet within a short period of time.
{p} {p}
{bold}First look:{nobold}{p}
When you start YAM, you will see a window that looks like this, ofcourse with the
Toolbar that you choosen, and it's bigger too:{p}

{left}
{p} {p}
It's from this window that you will perform every action. And there is alot to
choose from!{p}
As you see YAM is very easy to understand, it has a very nice layed out interface,
with easy to understand buttons (There is text under the toolbarbuttons if that is
configured in the MUI prefs!).
{p} {p}
{bold}Configuration:{nobold}{p}
You must configure some important stuff in YAM before you can use it, it's very easy,
just follow the steps in the Guide and you will have YAM ready for usage in less than
5 minutes.{p}
Since YAM allows several people to use the same program, you must also configure
User! This is very simple, it's done in less than 1 minute. No trouble at all.
The different users can be configured to share the same Folders, but the folders can
also be configured so only one person will have access to it, it can even be password
protected and/or encrypted.{p}
There is ofcourse alot of other options, but you don't have to touch them in order to
use YAM, but when you have gotten to know YAM, then please read through the chapter
in the Guide that covers the configuration and configure it to your personal taste to
make the most of YAM!

{bold}Write a message:{nobold}{p}
So, how good is YAM when it comes to Writing an E-Mail?
{p} {p}
At the first look at the Write window, it doesn't seem very complex, and it doesn't
look like it has very many options, but the look can deceive, and it does it this
case!{p}
Let's look at the Toolbar first, from left: Open in external Editor, Insert a text,
Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, and then there is four textstyles. The textstyles is the
standard *bold* _underline_ /italics/ and #coloured#.{p}
YAM has a very nice feature in the To: field, when you write the beginning of an
E-MailAddress or Alias from your AddressBook it will complete them just like
modern browser does with the URL!{p}
If you download a SpellChecker like ISpell or AlphaSpell you can also set so the stuff
you write will be spellchecked as you type, or afterwards!{p}
When you have written a mail (or before for that matter) you can set alot of flags
etc in YAM. Like the importance of the mail, Encrypt/Sign it with PGP, CC and BCC to
other people (Carbon Copy and Blind Carbon Copy) and more...{p}
When you are finished with the mail, you can either choose Send Now, which ofcourse
sends the mail right away, Send Later, will send the mail when you press the Send
button and Hold to Hold it so you can edit it later!
{p} {p}
{bold}Read a message:{nobold}{p}
When you read a mail in YAM, you will get a window similar to this:{p}
{center}
{image 26_YAM2_Read.IFF}{p}
- Read Window -
{left}
{p}
It's from here all the reading takes place. And as you see the read window is split
in three parts (as default), you have the toolbar, the Header field and the message
field. If you want you can remove the Header field, and show any other headers too,
and you can also show a picture of the person who sent the mail.{p}
There isn't so much to say about the Read window.
{p} {p}
{bold}Other functions:{nobold}{p}
YAM has alot of other neat functions, I will mention some of them (the more commonly
used ones) briefly!
{p} {p}
{bold}-{nobold} AddressBook: This is ofcourse where you keep the information about all your friends,
you can also setup lists here, like if you have a list of persons that you send a
mail too each week, then all you have to do is set the listalias in the To: field and
it will be mailed to everyone in the list.
{p} {p}
{bold}-{nobold} Search function: The search function in YAM is very good, you can set which folders to
search in, in which field(s) in the mail it should search, and what it should search for!
{p} {p}
{bold}-{nobold} Filters: YAM has a very good filter, here you can setup so mails that is from a specified
person, uses a special mailer, contains this and that, you name it... The comparison part
is really complex, it's virtually nothing that it can't do! You can set different
actions on the mails that matches a special criteria, like: Bounce, Forward, Reply,
Execute, Play Sound, Move, Delete and Don't Download.
{p} {p}
There is more functions in YAM, but these where the most important/used!
{p} {p}
{bold}Conclusion:{nobold}{p}
As you see, YAM is a mailer with alot of functions, but it amazes me that it's so
easy to use, that you can have it up and running in less than five minutes. And ofcourse
for this price (free), you can't find a better mailer for Amiga, I'm not even sure that you
can get another mailer this good on any platform.{p}
There is only one thing to say about YAM: "Use it!"
