Q: One of the questions people ask is, what is AMIGA ?
{p} {p}
A: Unfortunately due to no marketing since 1990 people of the younger
generation never heard of AMIGA . It will soon be 10 that's one whole
generation plus countless other half, third ,etc... generations never
hearing of AMIGA . I'm here to change that and so are countless other
people including Gateway. If you did hear of AMIGA we never refer to
AMIGA as "it" , <Blasphemy>. AMIGA is referred to as a human being
because first and foremost AMIGA acts like a human being hence never
"it". We call her AMIGA - GIRLFRIEND in SPANISH -rather nice and unique
. AMIGA is userable friendly. Plus you may have caught me saying "we"
that's because when you get an AMIGA you are part of a NUCLEAR FAMILY
that is creative as well as smart, yeah true one in the same. You can't
ever find this loyalty except in family -hence we are part of ONE BIG
FAMILY. We even have our own Logo and a band plus a CD a national
ANTHEM if you will.

Back to the question at hand. The AMIGA is a REAL-TIME MULTITASKING
system with REAL MULTIMEDIA. AMIGA uses advanced arch. Called Direct
Access Arch.(DAA). Simply put Motorola uses it and Intel , SGI ,Mac and
the rest including gamestations use bus arch. This same bus arch. That
Motorola used in the 50's. Intel and the rest are copying Motorola's
old arch basically verbatim. This makes them old and obsolete from the
get go. At least 40 year old technology. With the newer technology and
having DAA as the motherboard the AMIGA is faster and also having True
32bit, 64bit, 128bit. This allows for true RISC accessing Where as the bus
arch. Side is limited to 4bit-sound(92voices), 8bit-video(256colors at
one time),16bit bus arch. True the SGI uses 16bit video but why pay that
much more- $15,000. When at that price I can have a Video Toaster
FLYER( The AMIGA that makes all sfx and movies) plus several PowerPc
chips going at 750mhz real-time 2gigs of ram plus other needed stuff.
This brings us to the Price. The avg. price is $1500 or $450( this one
is basically a games machine that can control the security of your house
and get on the Internet!). The A1200 the cheap but expandable AMIGA .

Q: What is Real-time Multitasking?
{p} {p}
A: It is when an Item has more then one processing unit or brain in this
case specialized to do each there own thing . The human brain has that ,
but the main difference is that all are built into one. The AMIGA has
several "brains" each programed to do there own thing plus ease the
"stress" load on the main brain or "CPU". Pcs, Macs, SGIs, gamestations, 
palmtop computers have one CPU. Therefore AMIGA is the only one that can
multitask. Why do we need it hum.. you always ask that question before
but yet answered by saying I want my computer to do this without waiting
for this program or run this and download several files at once. That
is something only the AMIGA can do. That is called Multitasking.

Q: What is Multimedia?
{p} {p}
A: It is when Video, voice over ,sfx are combined into one without
adding any hardware or software. But I have a cdrom player so I have
multimedia. My dear friend so does a stereo and its not considered
multimedia. - Combining all forms of MEDIA into one package.

Q: Since the AMIGA is the lacreme of the lacreme why doesn't the AMIGA
cost more?
{p} {p}
A: Henry Ford - ring a bell, several people making the same computer
-plus its made the same "way" a PC is made only better technology. The
parts are cheap to because they have been around since the AMIGA was
made in 1984.

{bold}Some finer more points of the AMIGA computer{nobold}
{p} {p}
1. When adding older CISC chips we can "patch " them together or Risc
several CISC chips together for a faster betterAMIGA.
{p} {p}
2. When we add a more powerful CPU i.e. 32bit to 64bit the AMIGA becomes
faster in all areas and the AMIGA is automatically a 64bit system
likewise for anything else as well as software.
{p} {p}
3. The OS (operating System ) can multitask in only 256k and the OS only
takes up 6megs of hardrive space.
{p} {p}
4. Real-time Multitasking is when you are able to do 2 or more things
with as little as ram possible but yet operate fast and efficently as
possible. I.E... format the floppy, get on the internet and download
several files at once, and also upload several files at once, and then
go on and do your wordprocessing while making an image in the
background(rendering).

{bold}How did I help?{nobold}
{p} {p}
Way back in 1995 when Gateway was advertising the Destination computer
and touting its capabilities. I called Gateway and got ahold of Jim
Collas (now President of AMIGA then Vice President of Gateway) and
TedWaite , President of Gateway. I told them that I represented AMIGA
yeah but so does anybody that owns one. The point is that I said that
you could be sued and to say that you were the first When the AMIGA is
the first Destination style computer. It has now become liable and for
you to claim as such so you need to buy out AMIGA , and I said that with
a major emphasis on buyout. No sooner had I said that then the
destination commercial that was on was cut off and a stupid old
commercial was put on. Since that time there has been no real
Destination commercials and AMIGA was bought out from GATEWAY with the
express purpose of updating to the AMIGA platform. Hence the two year
upgrade policy they now advertise. Soon the Look and feel will be
different.That will be because there is an AMIGA inside no Intel nor any
other PC piece of crap.
