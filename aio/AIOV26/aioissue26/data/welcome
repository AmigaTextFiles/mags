Howdy everyone! A warm welcome to issue 26. Alot has happend this month
at AIO Towers and i'll give you a brief rundown of all the new features
and happenings around the place.
{p} {p}
As you will see from the start we have a new icon which has been
designed by {bold}Andrew Crowe{nobold}. Thanks to him and also to {bold}Leto Kauler{nobold} who
also submitted some nice icons but in the end we can only pick one
and I just loved the icon Andrew has done.
{p} {p}
The second thing you will have noticed that some of you may be using
right now is that you now have the option to open AIO on its own
public screen with 256 colours. You can of course still open it on your
WB screen for speed but if you want the full effect of AIO showing in
all its 256 colour glory then you can open it on its own screen without
the trouble of changing your WB screen colours.
{p} {p}
One of the other new features which I think is very exciting and useful
which I talked briefly about last issue is the new option to click on
the highlighted download button which you will find at the bottom of most
reviewed files. Then you will be asked where you want to download the
file to and the program which is included with the AIO archive called
GetClient by {bold}Ray Akey{nobold} will start to download that file
to the place you selected. This is a great feature so if you are online
you only need to click on the file you want with no need to load up
any FTP program because it will download it all for you.
{p} {p}
The last new change you will have seen is that AIO in its archive is
now in its own directory which will make it easy for people who store
each issue on their HD. It should also stop any problems like which
occured on one of the recent AF cover CDs where all one issues contents
where over-written.
{p} {p}
This month Amiga announced that it was dropping QNX and replacing it
by Linux for its main kernal. I have heard many remarks about this
being a bad decision but I feel most people have jumped up without
knowing the facts. The idea is you can use Linux as a base but have
the actual graphical OS interface completely programmed anyway you
wish. On the PC you can get WindowsX which is a version of Windows but
to run on Linux. I think alot of people should calm down and wait to
see what is going to happen.
{p} {p}
In the end it is Amiga who make the final decision on what direction
the next Amiga takes and they need our support and backing with no stupid
or childish hate or against Amiga campaigns which is really what is
happening. The people who are working at Amiga are professionals and
know what they are doing. In the end they call the final shot so instead
of being against Amiga lets back them {bold}100%{nobold} and then if they fail you
can always say that you told them so. Please, please, please don't
write them off before they've even had a chance. I know its been a long
time but we need to support them in everyway because it is the only
way the Amiga will be a success.
{p} {p}
I have two more pieces of information I want to give you about AIO.
Firstly a few weeks ago the AIO Phone competition line opened and for
you that havn't already heard about it then a prize will be offered
after each issue and the way you enter is by phoning the competition
line and answering the question. The winners will be picked at random
a few days before each new issue is released.
{p} {p}
This month we have a 56k modem bundle with headset, speakers and a
whole host of other stuff that comes with it. You will also get STFax
for the Amiga or a PC Fax program depending on what computer you
want to use it with.
{p} {p}
The Question is 'Amiga was a codename by the original inventors but
what does it mean?' Once you phone the competition line you will be
given three choices and have to answer the correct one. If you think
you know the answer and live in the UK then phone now,
{p} {p}
{bold}{subhead}0906 613 57 50{nobold}{def}{p}
(Calls cost 60p per min at all times)
{p} {p}
The last piece of information is that now you will beable to receive
AIO in a very basic text (.txt) version for those who do not have WB
3.0 or higher. If you want to receive just a text version via email
then contact us at the usual address found in the {link contact}contact{end} section
each issue.
{p} {p}
Don't forget to mail us your letters for next months hot topic debate
which you can see by going to the {link letters}letters{end} section of
the magazine. If you havn't already voted then also remember to send off
your applications into the {link pdtop}PD Toplist{end} section where we
will be showing what your favourite utilites of all time are.
{p} {p}
I hope you enjoy this issue as much as we have enjoyed making it. Don't
forget to look out for the new design AIO website which will be online
when {link http://www.aio.co.uk}http://www.aio.co.uk{end} is back online in the next 2 weeks.
