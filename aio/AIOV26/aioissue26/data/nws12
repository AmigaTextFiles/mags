PRESSRELEASE, 7.7.1999{p}
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
{p} {p}
WHAT IS FXPAINT ?
{p} {p}
fxPAINT is a new, revolutional image processiong software for the
AMIGA, that will make use of the latest hard- and software existing
for the AMIGA. It`s planned to release a first, full release on CD
within this year (1999).
{p} {p}
MAIN FEATURES
{p} {p}
fxPAINT is a strongly extended image processing software for the
AMIGA. It contains the usual painting tools, but also offers a lot
more. E.g. it`s possible to mark whole areas by a simple mouseclick.
Gradients can be added by a simple dragging, too. fxPAINT allows you
the usage of several, natural pens like chalk, pencil, the so called
"Artist Pen" or simply with pens, that were cut from another picture
before. As you might already have thought, when reading fxPAINT`s
name, fxPAINT is not limit to painting with colors or cutted pens, but
offers you a great palette of high-quality effects. This includes, but
isn`t limited to: Standards-effects like changing of brightness,
contrast or gamma. Special-effects like light-sources or bumpmapped
surfaces, glow- and shadow-effects, waves, explosive supernovas,
distortions, etc. You`ll also find professional tools like
Gradtion-curves or matrix operations. This opens up a great number of
posibilities to create and design pictures. Another special feature is
fxPAINT`s realtime-mode, that shows changes to the effect-settings
immediately after they were made. E.g. Light-sources can be dragged
over the pictures - in realtime and full quality!! fxPAINT basically
is similiar to a layer-based image processing package, but it isn`t
directly equal to it. You can paint with effects while the
Alpha-Channel (that can have full 24bitdepth) is fully used, if
active. Painting-mistakes can be fixed easily by the undo and
redo-function. Of course fxPAINT is not only very usable for changing
and manipulating images but also for creating them. E.g. fire,
fractals, screenshots, videodigitizes, etc. can be made directly from
within fxPAINT by some simple clicks.
{p} {p}
EXTERNAL DEVICES AND MODULES
{p} {p}
The support of scanners and videodigitizers and an open, documented
Plugin-API will make you feel, that other programs aren`t needed any
more. To guarantee brilliant printings, optimized routines for the
printer.device and TurboPrint are available within fxPAINT. fxPAINT
keeps the internal multitasking. You can work even while scanning!
{p} {p}
INTERNAL MODULES
{p} {p}
Maybe you are one of those (like me, too), that don`t make great
efforts to sort the graphics on HD in order to keep an overview over
them. That`s why you might like the inbuilt picture database called
fxALBUM. Editing a picture is very easy then, as you only have to
click on the image and on another button in order to have the picture
loaded in fxPAINT. If you want to, you can print overviews over your
pictures as well. For fast conversions between the file formats, the
module fxCONV is available. It allows you automated conversion of
several directories and/or files full of pictures into another format
easily. If you want to create graphics for the WWW and want to make
use of so called HTML-Imagemaps, fxIMAGEMAP might be your tool,
allowing you easy creation of ImageMaps within minutes!
{p} {p}
THE GUI-SYTEM
{p} {p}
fxPAINT has internal BOOPSI-classes of its own, that ideally adapt to
the used hardware. No matter what hardware is used, the fxPAINT-GUI is
full of images, what makes fxPAINT more usable and effective. Of
course, a bubble-help-system is available describing the most
important buttons, so you needn`t guess, what this or that button
might be for. On truecolor-screens, fxPAINT`s GUI is most impressing,
because it then uses 24bit-gradients, that give it an even more modern
and unique look. fxPAINT offers you the ability to adapt to your
already existing knowledge by offering three modes for novices,
average users and experts.
