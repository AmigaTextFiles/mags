Okay, so I goofed and you didn't get to see last months article until
this month. Well, that doesn't mean that I'm slacking off. I'm Still
doing this month's web article, so consider yourself blessed with twice
the web sites!  The other article covers last month's sites, and this
one this month's. That's ten sites in all, with TWO monthly picks!
{p} {p}
That should keep you people too busy to drown me in complaints.

Ben And Jerry's Flavor Graveyard{p}

{p} {p}
Just when you thought it was enough entertainment to see what strange
flavor names Ben & Jerry's ice cream would come up with next, they think
up this idea for a flavor graveyard. Browse through all the retired
flavors and amuse yourself with the vast numbers of strange flavor names
that have toured on through the frozen section. Sambucca Chocolate Chunk
anyone?

Sporks{p}

{p} {p}
Yes, someone actually put up a web site on that bizarre little eating
utensil (and even bought the domain name apparently!). Aside from the
various uses for a spork (the least of which is eating with one),
there's sporks from around the world, spork links, and an AVI of
someone trying to eat ramen with a spork.  Oh, and don't forget how to
turn one into a Foon, or getting a spork tee-shirt!

Have a yen for more demos?  What with Amiga CD mags vanishing like
American wildlife finding those great looking demos is getting harder.
Well, here's something to get you going.  The demo group IRIS not only
has a web site, but they have a whole bunch of their demos, intros, and
slideshows available for download there.  Check it out and start filling
up your hard drive.

Museum Of Dirt{p}

{p} {p}
Nowadays they'll have a web site for anything, and here's proof. With
carefully cataloges of dirt from all around the world, celebrity dirt,
and more, you can view just what dirt from places you'll never go to
look like; each type of cataloged dirt is accompanied by a picture of a
glass jar filled with the stuff.  Of course to my untrained eyes it all
looks just like dirt, but I guess it'll do until someone comes out with
the paint-peeling site.

Shaolin Gung Fu Institute{p}
{link http://www.webcom.com/~shaolin/home.html}http://www.webcom.com/~shaolin/home.html{end}
{p} {p}
First off, I did Not spell it wrong. Gung Fu is the correct spelling,
Kung Fu is the incorrect English translation (I point this out because
my old Gung Fu instructor would have my hide otherwise).  That said, if
you have ever been curious about the lgeendary mystery that is Gung Fu,
and want a bit more exposure than just the latest Jackie Chan movie,
then this is the place to go. Brought over from China in the early 1920s
by 8 Shaolin priests that fled to America, the information here is as
accurate as it gets.
{p} {p}
Start off with the history. Going back to 540 AD when an Indian
Buddhist priest came up to China to spread his religion and had to
develop certain exercises to keep his priests awake during meditation,
to the burning of the temples after World War I, it's an interesting
dive into a history most consider all but lost.
{p} {p}
From Taoism, to Budhism, to Chan, you can see how the philosophy varies
among the Shaolin and how it affects their training and styles.  You can
also see how the temple structure was laid out, with the titles,
rankings, and general life in the temple.
{p} {p}
Finally, the part that is the most interesting, the different styles of
Gung Fu. Hard versus Soft, External versus Internal, this sites gives
all the general animal forms available as well as several family styles.
With praying Mantis, Crane, Tiger, Dragon, Leopard, and Snake, and the
classic division of Northern versus Southern styles, you can discover
the techniques and history of each style and gain a better understanding
of what was until now just but a name.
{p} {p}
Then maybe the next time you see a Jackie Chan movie you can point out to
the friend sitting next to you "Hey, that's tiger style he's using
there."
