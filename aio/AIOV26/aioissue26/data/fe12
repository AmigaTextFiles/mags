1) We hired Dave Curtis as director of object technology and
transaction services. Dave will be responsible for developing our
transactional object technology. Dave was one of the original
architects of CORBA and has worked for Inprise (Borland), the Object
Management Group (OMG), and other organizations focused on object

1) O/S 3.5 - The target final release is August 21st at the Amiga
Downunder show in Australia. We are talking to Amiga hardware
development companies to qualify hardware products targeted at the
O/S 3.5 release. We plan to come out with a recommended hardware
configuration and list of qualified Amiga hardware products for the
O/S 3.5 release.

2) AmigaSoftTM Operating Environment (OE) We are developing our
next generation operating environment including operating system,
user interface, and some revolutionary software structures to be
disclosed at a later date. Target beta version is late 3Q99 with
final in late 4Q99. We are also looking at the possibility of porting
this new AmigaSoftTM OE to the O/S 3.5 recommended hardware
configurations. If we can accomplish this it will allow people to run
the new OE on specific Amiga configurations with PowerPC boards.
