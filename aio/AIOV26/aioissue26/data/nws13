Activision licenses Hyperion to port Heretic II
{p} {p}
Hyperion is very pleased to announce that it has (in collaboration
with Stuart Walker from [{link http://www.digital-images.demon.co.uk}http://www.digital-images.demon.co.uk{end}]
Digital Images) acquired a license from Activision to port
[{link http://www.ravensoft.com}http://www.ravensoft.com{end}] Raven Software's highly acclaimed Heretic
II to the Amiga.
{p} {p}
Heretic II is the stunning conceptual sequel to Heretic and Hexen and
is based on Id Software's advanced Quake IITM engine. The Amiga
version will require a PPC processor (WarpOS) and a graphicscard and
will take full advantage of 3D accelerators through Warp3D. The
possibility of a 68060 version is under investigation but would in any
case require 3D acceleration. Other features include virtual 3D sound
(supported through AHI) and network-play (internet, modem, LAN).

The Amiga port will be carried out by Peter Annuss (ADescent PPC, EGCS
WarpUp), Joe Sera (AQCVid, Skyline II, ObjectWorkshop), Hans-Joerg
Frieden (Warp3D, ADescent W3D, Shogo) and others. Release is expected
to be early to mid Q4 1999.

"Hyperion's goal is to provide Amiga users with some of the best games
to date and this is just the beginning", says Hyperion's managing
partner Ben Hermans. "High-end games require high-end machines. There
is some really exciting Amiga technology out there today with more on
the horizon and we intend to push it to the limit. If users support us
by getting us the sales we need, they will have a lot to look forward
to".
