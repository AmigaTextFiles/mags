Prayer is a MPEG Audio Layer 3 (MP3) player for those who want looks before speed.
It isn't the fastest MP3 player around (it's not slow either but not just as fast
as some others), but for those who have the power and want to have the BEST looking
MP3 player for Amiga.
{p} {p}
But it isn't just an MP3 player, it can also play CDDA (direct from CDs) WAVE and
everything else that the AmigaOS datatypes supports!
{p} {p}
The installation is very simple, just run the script, and wait some secs.
{p} {p}
To improve the look of Prayer, there are some Robes (like skins) and they look COMPLETELY
different from each other, the size, position of everything, font, everything can be
positioned where ever you want, but to be able to create your own Robes, you have to have
the registered version!
{p} {p}
It also has a Playlist, but you can't save the list in the unregistered version (these
are the only two limitations in the unregistered version).
{p} {p}
According to the doc, this is what quality it can play on different CPUs:
{p} {p}
030/50 MP3 in 22khz, mono, medium quality.{p}
040/40 MP3 in 22khz, stereo, full quality.{p}
060/50 MP3 in 44khz, stereo, full quality.
{p} {p}
But when I try to play a MP3 on my 060, I can't have that, I must either loose some
quality or run it in lower khz.
{p} {p}
It comes with a html documentation, it's VERY brief, but such a tool like Prayer
doesn't need so much; If you can run a Stereo, then you can run Prayer!
