Just recently I have been involved with accusations of Pirate being yelled very
loudly and all over a free giveaway programme on the now defunct CU Amiga
CD27. This CD was the last one issued before CUAmiga passed on to the great
newstand in the sky and part of it's legacy to the Amiga world was a complete
fiasco over the Cd's main feature, Cinema4D. The CD contained the full version
but unfortunately the installer with it didn't work and after you'd struggled to
get it onto your hard drive it asked for a  registartion number. This was also
missing from the magazine at which point many people consigned the CD to the
bottom of the drawer.

Anyone who bought Amiga Format 117 could turn to page 98 where details of the
correct installer and a phone number to ring Hisoft and obtain the correct
registration number. The piracy accusations came about because a man who had
bought both the relevant magazines but had not rung Hisoft at the time decided
to help his son with a school graphics course by using Cinema4D. He rung Hisoft
who told him they were no longer issuing the code number so he appealed to the
Amiga Format Bulletin for the relevant number, where-upon he was jumped on
by Ben Vost and dire consequences were threatened for anyone who gave him the
number. He wanted to see if Cinema4D was suitable for his needs in order to
purchase the latest edition and not buy software blind.

Last year I bought a complete Amiga 1200 system as a back up for mine and
amongst all the goodies were magazine CD's which I already had. I have been
selling these, via an advert in AF to people who wish to complete their sets of
CDs. Does this make me a pirate ? I realise that the CD is not supposed to be
sold without the magazine but many people, me included bought the magazine
floppy versions before upgrading to a CD-Rom drive and wish to buy the
back-issue CDs not now available from AF or CUAmiga.  All the people who have
contacted me have asked for a specific CD number and not the TFX issue or
Opus 5 issue which leads me to believe they just want to fill the gaps in their
collections. For me piracy is making illegal copies of commercial products for
pecumiary gain, not suppling a code number for a free-issue game that the
person has bought.

Also on many CDs are hard-drive installers, many of which remove the copy
protection or have trainers. The jst and Keith Krellwitz ones all state that their
fixes will only work with the original disks. Is this piracy? In effect you are
making an unauthorised copy of the software which was probably never intended
for hard drive installation. The reallity for me is that games such as Settlers and
Breathless would not get played if I had to load up floppies and search through
manuals for the appropriate codes whereas when one click of the menu loads the
game all ready to play.
