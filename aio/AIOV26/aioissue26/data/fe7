{subhead} UK unmetered calls looming?{def}{p}

The UK for a long long time has argued that other countries have either
freecalls or unmetered calls. The arguments that you get nothing for
free are ridicules and are easily solved by having unmetered calls and
not freecalls. Freecalls imply that the call is totally free meaning you
pay nothing not even a one off charge. Unmetered is completely different
where you pay a small fee each time you call someone or dialup the
internet but can stay online for as long as you want without more than
the first one off charge. This basically means the phone companies are
still making money and the customers are happy.
{p} {p}
I have heard lots and lots of for and against arguments all which can
be cleared up and it seems unmetered calls is the way the country will
be going very shortly. As far as I have been able to tell and what I
have been told by a person who delt with my inquiry at the government
organisation OFTEL which regulates telecommunications in the UK is that
only BT is restricted from giving free calls for which they have wanted
to do for a long time but no other company has this restriction so the
hundreds of new cable phone companies can freely offer unmetered calls or
free calls when ever they feel like but they are not willing to at the
moment.
{p} {p}
At the moment in the UK there is huge tension about and personally I
can see unmetered calls coming into effect within the next 6 months
or year at the latest. I do not know this for a fact but the way things
are going at the moment it is very likely something major is about
to happen.
{p} {p}
There are many points that make me think this because alot of new
services have appeared that offer freecalls or other incentives. The
first move was the free ISPs and now most of the ISPs in this country
don't charge any connection charge where most used to charge £10 UKP
which is about $15.20 US$ or 32.20 Dutch Guilders. As I said these
are mostly free with many old companies converting to offer free
service and many new 'free from the start' companies. The next step
is recently alot of ISPs have been experimenting with 0800 number
dialups which are the equivalent of US 1 800 numbers and this means
for those of you outside the UK or US that the call is totally free
and whatever company is running the 0800 number pays for the calls
people make. These types of companies have all started recently and
all around the same time.
{p} {p}
One of the free ISPs called X-Stream offered 0800 dialups every
Saturday for a month. This may be only 4 days out of their history
but it is a start and makes a path for things to come. Another
newer idea is by the UK main phone company which until a few years
ago had about 80% of the people with phones using their company,
since the inception of cable companies they now only hold 60% of
the country connected to a phone line with the many many cable
companies each hold a few percent each. The new idea by BT (British
Telecom) is for those who pay a higher subscription rate to their
company and use their internet company BTinternet can use 0800
numbers every Saturday and Sunday. If your connection is inactive
for 15 minutes then the carrier will be dropped but if it is in
use you get 2 hours before you have to reconnect. This is obviously
to put people off staying on for 48 hour periods with no log off as
BT would have to foot the bill. If this actually gives any benefit
to the customer is left to be seen as you pay a higher rate standing
charge which could pay for your calls anyway. You may appear to
be getting something free but actually be paying for it in other
ways. Who Knows?!
{p} {p}
AOL (America Online in the UK) has recently to my knowledge started
to offer on a trial basis 0800 number dialups 24/7. I'm not sure
how true this is or if they have a disconnect limit after a certain
time or not but as you need to have a PC to use them I wouldn't
know. A new ISP which has caused quite a stir in the UK is called
FreeCall UK which was announced a while ago but has now publicly
opened. The catch is the more time you use on their 0845 number
which for people outside the UK these numbers are charged at local
rate and the company who uses them gets some of the money you pay
your phone company you get more time on their 0800 numbers. If you
used 1 hour on peek time you get 30 minutes on their 0800 numbers
to use at anytime. If you use 1 hour on the weekends then you get
10 minutes on the 0800 number which you can use at anytime. If
you get someone else to sign up using your ID number then you get
100 minutes free time on their 0800 number. To open your account
you have to pay £6 UKP, about $9.12 US$.
{p} {p}
Overall this is a good idea but alot of effort is needed to make
use of this but if you can stand this then you get some free calls
which are not limited to any certain times.
{p} {p}
Another new ISP has just opened that gives local call access with
no charges but the earlier you sign up you will get more shares
in the company when they float the company in the future. The first
certain amount of people get the most shares and as more people
sign up they get less and less shares. By now the big amounts of
shares have already gone and the appeal to join up to get a few
shares is less than pleasing.
{p} {p}
One of the very latest ISPs which has just recently opened can be
found at, {link http://www.4thenet.co.uk}http://www.4thenet.co.uk{end} and the idea is they pay you for the
time you spend online. You of course do not get all the money back
you paid the phone company but you will get a cheque for a certain
amount every 3 months and the amount on the cheque depends on how
much time you have spent online over those three months. This idea
is taken from the US which already exists but was not available to
customers in the UK until now with a dedicated company for the UK.
{p} {p}
I don't know how much money you get exactly and some people may
say that for the amount you get it may not be worth it. I wouldn't
expect you to get much but surely getting paid for something you
would do anyway is a bonus? Why not get paid for doing it no matter
how small the amount is.
{p} {p}
As you can see over the last 6 months and more so the last 3 months
alot of ideas have cropped up that give you free calls, free things
and also pay you to spend time online. These are just a few of the
many new schemes that have opened recently in the UK and the more we
get and support ideas like this then I can honestly see unmetered
calls in the UK in the next 6 months to a year. Obviously I can not
say this WILL happen but the many schemes that have opened suggest
we are on the way to unmetered calls.

For now though if you live in the UK and want to support the campaign
to give UK customers unmetered calls then visit,
