Results are presented in two forms. One for all Amiga
models together and other for each model separately.

Diablo's Land in HI-Res.
{p} {p}
Based on the results of the inquiry form we have decided
to make Diablo's Land Gfx Card version in High-resolution
(640x480) instead of low (320x256) that we have planed
before. However AGA version will still remain in 320x256
with 256 colors. We have start re-rendering the graphics
for High resolution and pictures will soon be posted to our
web site.
