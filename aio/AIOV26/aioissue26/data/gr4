Two issues ago in issue 24 I reviewed a game called Sharks by
Christian Steiner. The game on the whole was nice because it offered
a different type of game that I have never seen before. At the
time I said the game was a bit easy because you rarely get killed.
{p} {p}
Then a few days ago I received an email from the author with the
keyfile to make the game registered. This has improved the game alot,
you get 3 lives instead of one and on the unregistered version you
can only play two levels.
{p} {p}
The registered version can claim alot more action and fun and now
makes the game worth while. So download the game from the Aminet and
register because its a nice game and only costs 10DM or 5$ which is
hardly alot for registering a game. The game can now be made harder
and as your progress through the levels as more and more sharks appear.

You can contact the author of Sharks with questions or if you want
details on how to register by emailing, {bold}C-Steiner@t-online.de{nobold} or
visit his webpage at, {link http:www.t-online.de/home/C-Steiner}http:www.t-online.de/home/C-Steiner{end}
