{subhead} Vodoo, Development of a new game{def}{p}
Article by Vodoo Team

{p} {p}

"VODOO" is the code name for a brand new game project. This new game
will be a wargame - but not an ordinary one. It will be a synthesis of
several great games such as Warcraft, StarCraft, Age Of Empires, Settlers...
and it will have original features as well.
{p} {p}
The action will unfold in real time, on an isometric 3D display, and
network options will be available.
{p} {p}
As for the story, there will be four different races who will confront
one another, but the goal will not necessarily be to destroy the other
races. The players will decide for themselves what goal they want to
pursue. They may want to act aggressively and exterminate everything
around them, like in a Seek'n'Destroy game, but they may find more
convenient, at times, to make alliances, and in that case their main
goal will be to sign a pact. Of course, the players' policy may change
course during the game, leading to plenty of sudden developments...
and possibly endless gameplay :-)
{p} {p}
The 4 races on the spot will be:
{p} {p}
{bold}*{nobold} The Humans{p}
{bold}*{nobold} The Chibas{p}
{bold}*{nobold} The Orcs{p}
{bold}*{nobold} The Krakhen
{p} {p}
Each of the above has its own set of characteristics, which may evolve
during the game, according mainly to the player's choices as leader of
the race. However, since the action starts about 1500 and may continue
well into the third millenium, the technologies, the objectives and
behaviours will change according to the period as well.
{p} {p}
Here's a short description of each race:
{p} {p}
1) {bold}The Humans{nobold} :
{p} {p}
This race is probably familiar to you. These people are average in
every respect, with no special advantages or shortcomings - but that
doesn't mean they're a boring kind :-) Although they are basically
peaceful, they may  get rebellious if their leadership is unwise. Their
scientists can do a fine job, especially if they are well-paid. They
are able to develop every kind of technology.
{p} {p}
2) {bold}The Chibas{nobold} :
{p} {p}
They are an extra-terrestrial race, who arrived on the planet millions
of years ago, before all other races. They once mastered a high level of
knowledge... but unfortunately, in spite of that knowledge (or perhaps
because of it), their society has become decadent over time, and much
of their elders' technology was lost, as they reversed to an agrarian
way of life. However, they will still possess some high-end technology
at the beginning of the game. But they're not going to be very inventive,
since for them inventing means mostly reinventing, and that tends to be
boring. Among them, leadership is assumed by a clan chieftain. They
tend to follow his orders in a disciplined way, and are not prone to
revolt. But everything has limits...
{p} {p}
3) {bold}The Orcs{nobold} :
{p} {p}
At the beginning of time, they were the enemies of the Humans. Their
evolution was a difficult and painful process, due to the awesome natural
conditions they dwelled in. As they have been living in volcanic mountains
for a long, long time, they have grown extremely aggressive and physically
strong, and they are now a rough and wreckless kind. They developed the
technology - and the magic powers - which they needed for survival. But
knowledge is not their passion, and they prefer to steal technology
from other races rather than develop it on their own.
{p} {p}
4) {bold}The Krakhen{nobold} :
{p} {p}
The Krakhen... what can we say... They are a special race, they are,
indeed, dragons. They live on high forested plateaus and have attained a
high degree of civilization. Since they can fly, they are naturally
advantaged in fights, but only as long as they are in the air - they
are rather clumsy and vulnerable on the ground. They have great magic
powers, really impressive powers, and they take orders from their
Great Wizard.
{p} {p}
That was a quick overview of the races, let's now say a word about the
action. There will be 4 different ways of playing:
{p} {p}
{bold}-{nobold} Campaign{p}
{bold}-{nobold} Scenario{p}
{bold}-{nobold} Competition{p}      
{bold}-{nobold} Team (Like the 3 above, but as teams)
{p} {p}
1) {bold}Campaign{nobold} :
{p} {p}   
You will have to make your race evolve, in whatever direction you choose,
and by whatever means you find relevant: you may have to conquer lands,
discover new technologies, defend yourself against the others, etc...
{p} {p}
The main goal is NOT to kill everyone/thing nor to own all the lands;
you want your race to evolve in a certain direction (more knowledge, more
happiness, more order...), so you're going to take the steps necessary
to support that evolution. Your evolution choices will determine how
the game unfolds. At the beginning of this mode, no actual objective is
handed to you, you just have to devise your own goals.
{p} {p}
2) {bold}Scenario{nobold} :
{p} {p}
In this mode, you will have to complete a given mission. All the missions
refer to great episodes of the world's history. The game's world, that
is :-)
{p} {p}
3) {bold}Competition{nobold} :
{p} {p}
Several players, one Graal. All the players have the same particular goal,
and they try to attain it first. The objective can be finding a treasure,
kidnapping a certain character, destroying something, etc...
{p} {p}
4) {bold}Team{nobold} :
{p} {p}
Same as the first mode, but you can play with your friends, up to 8
players at the same time.
