With the imminent release of OS 3.5 for the Amiga Classic systems
available soon, the Amiga Down Under show scheduled for August 21, 22
will be the host event for the official launch of 3.5.

OS 3.5 is the first new product for the Amiga in over 5 years, and it
includes the integration of the most requested features by Amiga
users. "When I took over the management of Amiga, one of my first
decisions was to get 3.5 moving and get it shipping. Now with the
release of the external beta, and the imminent release of the shipping
version of 3.5, I am pleased to say that we are beginning to ship
product", said Jim Collas "This is only the beginning of the New
Amiga."

"This has been a very exciting project for us, and we know that this
is going to be a great product for the Amiga Community" said Juergen
Haage of Haage and Partner - the development partner working with
Amiga to release 3.5. "We look forward to the party in Australia to
celebrate its release."

OS 3.5 is available through your local Amiga dealer or retailer, and
pre-orders are being accepted by most dealers. For those who have
pre-ordered 3.5, it will begin shipping as soon as it is released. We
are using the Amiga Down Under show as our celebration party.
