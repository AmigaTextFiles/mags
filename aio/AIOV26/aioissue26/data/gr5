MUIMine is a WB mine game. We've all played them. The idea is very simple
indeed and has been around for a long time. You have a board with a certain
amount of mines in but every square is covered up. You can either remove
a square which will remove the surrounding sqaures that do no contain a
mine or you can place a flag with the right mouse button if you suspect
a mine is under that square.

When removing the squares that don't contain mines you will get numbers
on some squres to alert you that that amount of mines is near that square.
ie. if the number is 2 then 2 mines are close to that square.

If you manage to put flags on all squares that contain mines you win if
not you will blow up and die.

MUIMine is exactly the same layout and design as the PC mine game that
comes with basically all PCs. The graphics are the same and the game is
mostly the same apart from the fact it is done in MUI and the PC doesn't
have MUI!

Overall its nice and simple, you'll love it or hate it, why not download
it for yourself and make up your own mine (bad joke :)!)
