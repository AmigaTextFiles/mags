Well folks, history is going to repeat itself- this time in a Good way.
What happened in {bold}1985{nobold} is going to happen again- this time in a lot more
noticeable way.
{p} {p}
First let me say, that reading the tech brief- even though it does not
yet merntion what the CPU will be- is like reliving an old episode of
the Jetsons, except this time it's real-life. The big furour over Linux
vs QNX is completely unnecessary as it's such a small component of the
whole thing. That said, let's move on.
{p} {p}
Amiga's aim is to make a virtual computer with an Operating Environment,
wherein the "computer" will be everything with an electric current in
your house... and car, and cell phone, and Internet. The Amiga Object
is a software structure that will make not only programming easier but
will act as cross-platform building blocks out of which you can build
you drivers, interfaces, and what-not for any new hardware (including
stuff that may come out not even yet envisioned) you may want to
integrate into your system without a rewrite of the OS. It uses Java and
Jini, with C and C++ for native apps, but fully Amiga optimized for the
MCc versions (yes, it looks like they've improved Java).  With Amiga
Objects, the system is ready to create virtual devices and new
interfaces, and support all manner of networking and wireless
technologies.
{p} {p}
Yes, you heard me right. Wireless. Your cellphone could be integrated in
as part of your home system.  Furthermore, the difference between say a
local hard drive and your networked home security system is NILL; both
will be as easy to access. The home computer will be the hub of a
distributed home computing network- and not even MicroSloth has anything
in the works that can come close to this!
{p} {p}
The hardware will be available as both an ATX motherboard and the
Multimedia Convergence Computer, with ports for just about everything.
E-IDE, 2 PCI slots, an open bay for ZIP or whatever, a place for your
choise of floppy replacement, DVD, Ethernet, and Firewire. There's 7 USB
ports to replace serial, parallel, mouse and game ports, but fear not
for adapters will be available for USB to old style stuff (like
parallel).  In fact, the only hookup NOT mentioned was SCSI (my personal
preference).  Throw in a minimum of 2 hard drives and it's looking pretty
good.
{p} {p}
Graphics? Try ATI doing 3D with a list of stuff that would give PC Power
Gamers wet-dreams, including 32MB of SDRAM for just the graphics; system
RAM will be another 32MB expandable possibly up to a Gigabyte.
{p} {p}
As far as Linux, they are using it for the kernel- a very small part of
the OS.  But not just off the shelf linux, they plan on optimizing it
for our favorite Ami. They're going to Amiga-fy Linux, sortof reinvent
it for our own needs (we just aren't happy unless we optimize
everything we lay our hands on, aren't we?). Linux was chosen because,
among the technical reasons, it just semes that everyone's writing
drivers and stuff for it, a distinct advantage for our return. There are
plenty of tools available for Linux already, even some linux-based Java
stuff. If we want to fight vertain big powers at their own game, linux
does seem the best way to go.
{p} {p}
Now we come to my favorite part. It seems that they were actually
listening to our dream-machine wishes. The original multimedia computer
with the native analogue signal is finally going to get some analogue
outputs as standard! Well,... that, and (author takes deep inhale of
breath)... analogue video and audio, TV outputs and digitization,
S-Video, FULL channel TV-tuner, 44KHz 16-bit CD stereo input and output,
Dolby output, and possibly even a FM radio tuner.
{p} {p}
All this, as {bold}STANDARD{nobold}.
{p} {p}
(waits while the reader gets over his shock enough to read on).
{p} {p}
Now, me, I don't care What the other guys have brewing, this will beat
the pants off it. It goes so far beyoind just another speed increase or
new CPU that it kind of makes everything else look like pocket
calculators; and that's without even yet knowing what the CPU of choise
will be.
{p} {p}
So, for my money, I think the Amiga's finally come back and is ready to
charge straight into the market like a bull in heat over a baby lamb. I
think it's time that Eric Schwartz broke out his pen and ink for a new
picture again, because we're going past "We're Back" and well into
"and we're taking over!"
