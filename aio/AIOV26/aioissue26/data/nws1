Gordonblimey! I don't think you could find another month with so much
good stuff going on. There's a truck load of new software; the release
of Wasted Dreams, some fantastic image software: ImageFX 4,
Photogenics 4.1, and a whole new package! Not to mention new hardware
in the shape of the more powerful BoXeR, with phase 5 making rumblings
in the background about their PowerPC G3 boards being ready for
September. Amiga themselves are showing some action - whether or not
they're doing the right thing is irrelevant at the moment, they are
actually doing something!

For those unhappy with AmigaNG, AmigaOS itself is coming back with
Haage&Parter - OS3.5 will be here before you can blink.

All in all, not a boring month to be an Amigan. Now you lot out there
have to do your part - if you have an interest in playing a fantastic
game, go and buy {link gr3}Wasted Dreams{end}.  Interested in art?  Got a scanner or
printer?  Go out and get ImageFX, Photogenics and FXPaint.  We are
getting some fantastic support from developers, let's show some
thanks! :-)
