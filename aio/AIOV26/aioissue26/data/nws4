New BoXeR Design Specs
{p} {p}
Access Innovation haven't yet delivered the Boxer motherboards, but
now we see why . . .
{p} {p}
The new BoXeR does not have the real, and presumably now rare, Amiga
custom chip set. Instead those clever people at Access have designed
their own... We can hope that the Amiga clone revolution will
happen now!

Woohoo! Now, if these can be pushed into high street stores... And
yes, I think it is perfectly possible - a low cost, high feature
machine sitting in a window playing some specifically coded demos will
sell, I think.
