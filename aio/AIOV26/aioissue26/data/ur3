Img2HTML is a program to get the Width and Height from pictures, perfect if you
are doing webpages...
{p} {p}
There isn't any need for an installation of Img2HTML, just copy it somewhere.
{p} {p}
The usage is very simple, just run it from CLI with the picture name and path as
an argument (you can add as many images as you want to)... After that it will write
the HTML image tag to a window, or to a file. It's perfect to add in a button or menu
in DOpus!
{p} {p}
It supports JPEG, GIF and PNG imageformats, and that's really all you need since it's
main purpose is to make it faster to make HTML files.
{p} {p}
I can't really say that it comes with a documentation, it has five lines in the readme
that shows how to use it. But since it's so simple to use, you won't need any more!
{p} {p}
Img2HTML has the source in C included, so you can use/abuse it as you like!
