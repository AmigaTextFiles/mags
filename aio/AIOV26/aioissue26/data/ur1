AmTagEd is a ID3 TAG editor for MP3 files. But, it doesn't just edit the
tags, it can also perform some other things on the MP3 file.
{p} {p}
But first, the installation procedure couldn't be easier, it comes with a
standard installerscript. You can choose from many different icons, and it
comes in five different languages.
{p} {p}
After you have started it, you will see a toolbar in the top, the tag edit
fields to the left and the MP3 list to the right.{p}
It's from the toolbar that you performs everything (besides the editing).
You can add MP3s in five different ways, load an old list, insert an old
list, add files, add a directory or add recursive.
{p} {p}
When you want to edit an MP3 all you have to do is to click on the MP3 file
in the list, and start edit it. Very simple. You can set in the prefs if you
want to save the TAG info on the press of RETURN or when you press the Save
TAG button!{p}
Also, if the MP3 has a lousy name, you can just press the Make filename from
TAG to make a nice filename or as a filecomment, the format of the
name/filecomment is ofcourse also settable in the prefs.
{p} {p}
The toolbar is using TearOff.mcc, this might not mean anything to you, but
TearOff.mcc is a class that lets the toolbars be torn off the main window
and you can place them anywhere you want on the screen.
{p} {p}
The documentation is an AmigaGuide which is very well layed out, but it doesn't
go so deep into details, it just mentions everything very briefly... But it
doesn't do anything, since AmTagEd is very self explainable, and it has a little
textfield that explains what everything is for (the thing you hold the mouse over).
{p} {p}
This is THE tool for all of you that has alot of MP3s, much better than the editors
that usually comes in the players!
