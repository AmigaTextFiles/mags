Well, it's the first Wander page of the millenium (and before some of
you point out that 2001 is the start of the next millenium, let ME point
out that the calendar is off by 5 years and it actually started in 1996,
so there!), so I'm bringing you an ecclectic variety of web sites.  Link
up and enjoy.

Human-kind is filled with a variety of hazing rituals, but are we the
only species to do this? Enter squirrel hazing. From charging in front
of dogs to eating out of a cat's drinking bowl, this site describes a
variety of squirrel hazing rituals. Enter into find out more, and see
their pictures of squirrels in the midst of their hazing activities.
Also read up on the squirrel judges and the Squirrels In Black.

This whole thing sounds a little squirrely to me.

{p} {p}
For you blooper fans out there, here's a site that lists every
sniggling little blooper or flub from the original 3 movies, as well as
an upcoming listing for Phantom Menace. From mis-cued lightsabres to
reversed images, there's every type of blooper that anyone without a
life could ever want.

{bold}Find A Grave{nobold}{p}

{p} {p}
Want to know where all the bodies are buried? Search for a grave's
location, and even see a picture of it, by just surfing over here.
Search by name, location, claim to fame, or birth and death dates, and
find the graves of both people and animals. Definitely one of the more
morbidly fun sites I've seen.

With the holidays over, you may be looking for something to do with all
those leftover beer cans (or not, but just humor me). A member of the
Beer Can Collectors of America, you can find out all you need to know
about collecting beer cans, attending trade shows (yes, they have them),
and anything else brew-related.

Start out the millenium with a bit of humor; visit what is probably the
biggest humor archive on the Net. From jokes to cartoons, it's all here.
{p} {p}
The Vault. Storehouse of over 10,000 jokes and funny pictures, but you
need to be 18 and register to proove it as the jokes are completely
unedited.
{p} {p}
Send a humorous greeting card to someone in yet another online greeting
card variant. Just choose from a variety of categories and send one off.
{p} {p}
The Joke Machine. A new joke is displayed everytime you hit the Reload
button on your browser.  Similarly there is also a Cartoon Machine.
Just keep hitting Reload for either of these and you'll be getting the
laughs.
{p} {p}
Humorous headlines are also fun. Take "America Online accuses USA of
copyright infringement for use of the word 'America' " as an example and
you see what I mean.
{p} {p}
Lastly there's also the 1-liner chat area where you can share jokes
with others around the Net but it requires Java. If you have a PC that
needs livening up then you can also download a program that's a
computerized version of the old MadLibs word-game.
{p} {p}
So start the Millenium off with a smile and let the jokes roll.
