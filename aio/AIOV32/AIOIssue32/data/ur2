Amster is a program that uses the Napster servers... Napster is a PC client
that makes it possible for you to go online and connect to a server and share
mp3s from people all around the world!
{p} {p}
Amster is one out of three ports that I know of, there is also a very early
version of aNapster (which the author refuses to release another version)
and there's also AmigaNap, a port which isn't available at all yet (a friend
is coding it)...
{p} {p}
So, this is the only port that is actually being released.. :(
{p} {p}
There is no installation at all needed, just unarchive it wherever you please.
{p} {p}
When started you will have to set your name and pass, and connection speed, it
doesn't seem as you can register an own name with Amster, so you must do that
with a PC client or use the one that is shipped with Amster...
{p} {p}
Amster uses MUI for it's interface, and it's very well designed, there is no
problem at all to understand it... As of yet, you can't make a list of your
mp3s that someone should be able to download from you (what a shame :-) ).
And the chat isn't implemented either, only the search and download... (do you
really need anything else?)
{p} {p}
So, all you have to do is to type a string and press search, it will then add
all it found to a list and from there you can download any you want...
{p} {p}
You can also add different search criterias, like, linespeed, bitrate and
frequency...
{p} {p}
There isn't so much else to say about it, I haven't used it much, because the
phonerates are so high... But now when I am sitting here and writing this review,
I am also downloading a mp3 with Amster, and it seems to work very well, although
I think it's a bit slow... But I guess it's the Napster servers that are slow...
{p} {p}
Amster also comes with an AmigaGuide documention, for those who wants to read them
instead of trial and error...
{p} {p}
Amster is also localized, which is a Good Thing (tm)... It comes in three languages,
danish, russian and swedish...
{p} {p}
The full source is also shipped with the program... (Read the Guide or something for
the licence on it)...
