sNAK3^RP     welcome to amigagames
{p} {p}
[breed-away] and its nice to see Cooksey wont be joining us hehe
{p} {p}
[breed-away] Are you ready to get started Francis?
{p} {p}
DD--i_c_u    :D
{p} {p}
situation    Here we go...

Charig       breed-away:re Cooksey - seconded

Senex        1) One thing "Amiga Aurora" (my suggestion for the new OS's
             name) MUST have: Screens - so how about Screens, Datatypes,
             FFS-support? 2) Why not calling the product family just
             "Amiga", i.e. "Amiga Aurora", "Amiga XYZ", etc.? GA
{p} {p}
Charig       We will be working with Amiga, taking a close look at the
             existing features and making sure that the new system will
             have the same or greater functionality.

Netsplit^    when can we expect to be reaching for our checkbooks, to
             buy something new from u guys & when might it be. GA
{p} {p}
Charig       Bill's in the room and Fleecy can't talk! :) Announcements
             on this will come when the product is ready to ship. No
             more hype!

{p} {p}
Urizen       Will you support hardware-accelerated OpenGL? GA
{p} {p}
Charig       intent(TM) supports hardware accelerated 2D and 3D graphics.
             As for the 3D APIs that sit on top, we encourage all 3D APIs
             to be ported across. Have you heard of Renderware? :)

tOmAsH-BB    What is the real cooperation level of TAO and Motorola? I
             mean,does Motorola want to use your (Amiga?) software, and
             vice versa?
{p} {p}
tOmAsH-BB    GA
{p} {p}
Charig       It is publicly known that Motorola is releasing connected
             appliances utilising Tao's software (e.g. Timeport P1088
             smart phone, see announcement 8.1.00)

dreamstar    Q: will Elate be used as the next generation OS of future
             Amigas? GA
{p} {p}
Charig       Specifics on this will announced shortly. :)

Firebird^    Hello Mr. Charig, my feeling about Gateway 2000's
             (Old Amiga Inc.) plans for using Linux as the OS of the
             new machines is that it would be a mistake. It wouldn't
             be an Amiga, just a Linux box with the Amiga name slapped
             on it. I hope this isn't going to be planned. ;)
{p} {p}
Charig       That was a statement!

sNAK3^RP     :ell there be a Os4.0 chipset...GA
{p} {p}
JoeSchmo     Howdy
{p} {p}
Charig       If you mean, "a new chipset for a new Amiga" then the
             answer is that the new Amiga has been designed to be hardware
             independent, hence Tao.
{p} {p}
Charig       This is why we are partnering together.
{p} {p}
Charig       Also I want to add a couple of other points.
{p} {p}
sNAK3^RP     :will we still have Os  as such...GA
{p} {p}
Charig       The main objective today is to correspond about intent(TM)
             rather than have extrapolations about the precise
             configurations of the new Amiga.
{p} {p}
Charig       ga
{p} {p}
TheB         What is the Amiga "history" that TAO has? It doesn't seem
             very comforting that you have to take a look at the Amiga
             to figure out what it's about. (As for Firebird's statement..
             that's true of any new "Amiga".)   And as for this 'hardware
             independent' Amiga.. is that like java? :)  GA
{p} {p}
Charig       Have you looked at our website to see what technology we offer?
{p} {p}
Charig       GA
{p} {p}
amiga-news_d 1st question: TAO: It was reported you helped funding the
             Amiga buyout. How much of it was "your idea", means, are
             you tech supplier, partner, or even more? 2nd question:
             Will VP Code and/or Amiga documentation be freely available
             for the "just curious"? GA
{p} {p}
fleecy       We talked to Tao when looking for partners and got so horny
             about each other that Tao dropped us some VC names and made
             introductions and recommendations about Amiga.
{p} {p}
[breed-away] Gaij!!!!
{p} {p}
Guest45753   Tao is our foundation supplier. Amiga will be providing
             all the support. Anyone who signs up to develop will have
             access to full APIs.

Swarfega     Apple's new OS X has a lot of it's GUI done with vectors,
             which allows easy scaling, rotating, etc. of pretty much
             anything on the screen. Will that sort of thing be possible
             with new Amigas (or is the OS extensible enough to allow
             people to write their own interfaces)? GA
{p} {p}
JoeSchmo     fleecy's nick got switched..... fix needed.
{p} {p}
charig       We are not intending to have matrix style transformations
             embedded in the lowest layers of the graphics subsystem as
             this inherently slows down all other graphics functions.
{p} {p}
charig       Such vector type operations are available higher up.
{p} {p}
charig       ...where they should be.
{p} {p}
charig       Remember... elegance through simplicity and performance.
{p} {p}
charig       GA
{p} {p}
dark4ces     would there be any performance benefit to writing code in
             VP assembler rather than higher-level languages? GA
{p} {p}
NeRP^cF      $#%@#$% server :)
{p} {p}
charig       There will be the same benefit that writing an assembler
             over high level languages offers in any other environment.
{p} {p}
charig       You trade off slightly higher development effort in order
             to gain tighter, faster code.
{p} {p}
charig       Remember that writing in VP gives you the advantages of
             assembler but no portability drawback.

sNAK3^RP     monolog::rendering will be faster:))))

AmigaDragon  (1) Will the new system (HDW or SW) have equivalent
             (or higher) filesystem support such as CrossDOS/CrossMAC
             including Windows longfilenames?  (2) Fleecy, will we see,
             sometime in the not too distant future, AmigaOS (classic)
             Open source?  GA
{p} {p}
fleecy       Me and 4 of the dev team have been VP for 2 days now and
             it's nothing like traditional assembler, more like C with
             the crap bits taken out. You'll find out soon.
{p} {p}
Guest78547   Answer to AmigaDragon - Q1 - You can mimic multiple file
             systems + they also have their own high performance native
             file system.
{p} {p}
Guest78547   Amigadragon (2) - our lawyers are looking into it but it is
             a much more complicated web than anybody could guess.

TheRiley     if someone wanted to build an "Amiga"-desktop based on,
             say, the POP-standard, and use your new OS , would you
             support it (and if, how)? could the new OS run on phase5
             Amirage for example? (ok, that's 2 questions, but they
             overlap so much that they are basically one :))
{p} {p}
charig       1. Yes. 2. Bill was talking to Gerald Carda yesterday. :)

HaXoR^       Mr Charig / Fleecy, is it just a coincidence this conference
             happening immediately before the transmeta cpu lauch(5pmGMT)?
             GA
{p} {p}
charig       Yes. We are hardware independent.

Cpt_Hbl^     How long has Amino/Amiga and Tao been co-operating ? We know
             all about Fleecy/Bill/Petro but how does Toa feel about Amiga
             community?  GA
{p} {p}
[breed-away] Yup, it was supposed to happen yesterday.....
{p} {p}
charig       We have a large amount of respect for the Amiga community
             which is why we have been working cooperatively with Bill
             and Fleecy for some months, determined to make this really
             happen.

BJS          The Time of Homecomputers of the 80's r over, i mean, what
             does a CHRP board with an strange OS with Amiga in common,
             other than the name, it's just marketing. and the things
             done from 1994 till now r only done for the existing userbase
             and they shrunk, how will u encourage others to buy amiga?
