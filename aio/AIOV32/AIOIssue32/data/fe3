Well, with recent dramatic events being what they are, I thought it time
to wrap up this series of articles with a final statement or two. A
brief analysis, if you will, of just what may have gone on.
{p} {p}
Gateway bought the Amiga, but what did they really buy? everyone had
been after developing a true multimedia-internet computer but the only
tride and true ways to it were covered by 47 patents inaccessible to the
PC world. Gateway buy buys out Amiga, but were they after to develop it?
{p} {p}
I don't really think so. It was a full year before they bothered to do
anything with it at all. Those 47 patents may have been the only thing
they were after. They finally did pull everything Amiga together into a
soherent company and single project, but from here we have a couple of
possibilities.
{p} {p}
They could have finally pulled it together in an attempt to throw the
community off the scent, but why bother? They had the patents they
needed, a few protesting users of failed computer system would have no
finacial impact on their plans. Or maybe they did it to mislead
Microsoft as they fought to get their internet developments on the
market first.
{p} {p}
The other possibilty is that maybe some VP came to see some
possibilities in the Amiga and got the home office to let him give it a
go. Thus Collas came in, drew everything together, and started up some
projects. He may have wanted a new Amiga but the home office had other
ideas; let Amiga develop the software they needed for their PCs, they
would just take it all away when it was ready, leaving Collas as
fall-guy. But maybe Collas found out or began to suspect and that's when
he pulled out and Gateway folded the Amiga efforts back into their main
company. Their cover had been blown so why continue.
{p} {p}
Either way, Gateway gets their much needed patents, of which they will
probably lisence to all the PC outfits sesperately looking for such
solutions, and they bought two extra years to develop their internet
solutions under the guize of a failed attempt at reviving the Amiga.
Amiga slips down, gateway has what they wanted and if anyone else wants
it they have to come to them, and there's no more Amiga around to have
to give any credit to. Extra bonus to bill Gates: no more Amiga.
{p} {p}
And that's where it might have ended.
{p} {p}
The best laid plans of mice and men, and all that... Along comes McEwen,
apparently having been working on his own solutions for two years and
sees a first last and only opportunity  for the Community to take Fate
in their own hands. He buys out Amiga- an act which Gateway has
nothing against since they'll keep what they wanted and earn an extra
buck in the process- and for the first time the inmates are in charge of
the asylum. The only one not happy is Gates, who's having enough trouble
keeping Microsoft in one piece.
{p} {p}
Where does this story go from here? The ending has yet to be written. Is
it too late for a restart on Amiga? Can the kingdom of PCs be overthrown
and the general populous freed from beige-boxx slavery?
{p} {p}
Who knows.
{p} {p}
All I can say is, stay tuned. The best part of this story is yet to
unfold...
