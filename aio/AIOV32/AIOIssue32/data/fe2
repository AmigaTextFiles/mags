Amiga and Tao-Group enter into a strategic relationship
{p} {p}
Las Vegas, NV January 8, 2000 - Amiga begins expressing plans for the
new Amiga with a strategic alliance with Tao-Group.

"Things started going wrong the moment the PC rode into town and the
home computer revolution of the 1980s ground to a halt. We are here
to right that wrong." said Bill McEwen, Amiga's El Presidente. 'We
kind of feel guilty about not having been around to show the world
the evils of the PC, but inept management sent the Amiga off to a bad
place. Luckily, its users and developers have kept it alive, and now
we are back."

"Existing products are very rude." He continued. "Shoving PCI slots,
interrupts, file systems, registries, megahertz, and megabytes right
into your face. My grandmother just wants to play a game, or send an
email, or draw a picture. She doesn't want to have to mortgage the
house and get a masters degree."

"Digital Technology has become stalled because of the predominance of
Windows." quiped in Fleecy Moss. "Putting a thousand monkeys on
typewriters may eventually produce the works of Shakespeare but it's
not something you're going to want to wait around for, and you don't
want to be responsible for cleaning up the mess in the meantime."

"Our approach is outrageous. WE look at what actual people want, and
then give them the most simple, elegant solution. Even calling it
computing is falling into the PC trap. It is participation in the
digital content universe, whether it be developing an application,
playing a game, making your own video, watching TV or buying S&M gear
online. Computing companies are trying to paint digital convergence
as computers and TVs coming together, so they can stick "TV" in front
of PC and continue to sell the same old garbage. Digital Convergence
is something much bigger though. It is about content, information,
services, and activity transforming into a digital format and coming
together in a single place that has no boundaries. If someone tells
you you need a PC to get into this new content universe, smile nicely
and hit them with a big stick."

"Elegance, simplicity, invisible and universal technology." sings
Bill McEwen, trying to get a word in edgeways. "That is why we are
just giddy to be working with the Tao Group. Others rant on about how
their products are next generation, warp capable, but the truth is
that most of them are based upon old concepts and architectures -
that's why you need the latest monster machine just to type letters.
Chris Hinsley (CTO/Tao Group) was one of those smartass child
prodigies you wanted to beat up at school. By age 20, he had already
been a commercial games developer for 5 years, and wrote some great
Amiga games. Being a smartass though, he saw the future, realised
nothing out there was ready for it, and dedicated the last ten years
of his life to making sure the human race was ready when the future
arrived."

"The Amiga was special because it refused to settle for second best.
If something is worth doing, it is worth doing right, and the proof
of that is in the global following that it still has today. With the
nightmare of the past five years behind us, the Amiga is ready to
push out ahead again, and save the future from a muddled, poorly
fitting, frustrating PC enema. With the foundation that the Tao Group
gives us, we are ready to re-introduce the world to a novel computer
concept - fun."

"We aren't stupid enough to think it's going to be easy," interrupts
Fleecy Moss, shoving McEwen to the ground and gagging him. "A lot of
people have been brainwashed by the advertisements and the slick
salespeople. However, the digital information revolution is all
around us, waiting to happen. Everyone can feel it, everyone wants to
be a part of it. Amiga is going to stick a pretty big bomb under that
PC logjam and blow it clean back to Redmond. Elegance, simplicity,
invisible and universal technology. Time to start smiling again."

"We are happier than a crocodile at a waterpark to be working with
Amiga." said Francis Charig, CEO and international stud. "We are very
proud of what we have created in our garden shed. We could have sold
out long ago, but the market was crowded with companies doing that so
we decided to actual create a product and make it a good one. Now we
are finding that OEMs are seeing our product and getting even more
excited about it than we are ourselves; it almost makes the whipping
and torture we have had to inflict on our employees worthwhile. An
Amiga solution powered by Tao technology is a match made in heaven
for everyone."
