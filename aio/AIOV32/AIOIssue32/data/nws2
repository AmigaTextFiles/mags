January 1, 2000 - The Champaign-Urbana Computer Users Group (CUCUG) announced
today that it has retired its popular, award-winning Amiga Web Directory (AWD)
web site.
{p} {p}
Citing continuing declines in the Amiga marketplace and Gateway's failure to
deliver new Amiga computer systems, CUCUG reluctantly decided to discontinue
it's popular web site link directory and news service on January 1, 2000. It
was felt that while CUCUG could continue with the AWD for several months, it
was better to retire now rather than allow the site to slowly decline with the
market. CUCUG is hopeful that the latest owners of the Amiga can turn this
market around for the developers and users who have held on throughout all the
past ownership changes and other difficulties the Amiga has faced.

For over five years, the Amiga Web Directory served as one of the most-visited
Amiga-oriented web sites on the Internet. Its carefully cataloged listings of
Amiga web sites was the most-respected collection of its kind. Each site in
the AWD's listings was reviewed by the CUCUG webmaster to ensure quality and Amiga
orientation. Site descriptions were carefully prepared by hand, resulting in
accuracy not possible on other machine- driven sites or those which allow site
owners to write their own descriptions.

The AWD's Amiga news pages became one of the most imitated features in the
Amiga web community. Dozens of Amiga news sites were inspired by the success
of the Amiga Web Directory's hugely popular news pages.
{p} {p}
A well-known offshoot of the Amiga Web Directory was "Agnes" the Amiga web
searching service. Agnes was also a cartoon character which personalized the
searching service. In addition to the over-2000 Amiga sites cataloged in the
Amiga Web Directory, Agnes could search the general Internet for Amiga
content, newsgroup messages, CUCUG Status Register newsletters and other Amiga-oriented
materials.
{p} {p}
The Amiga Web Directory was one of the first member-supported Amiga web sites.
Amiga enthusiasts joined the CUCUG organization to show their support for the
efforts of the group. These memberships covered the costs associated with
running the popular web service and other CUCUG activities. CUCUG is very
grateful to its members' support which it has received over the years. The
group also acknowledges the many Amiga-oriented companies which have given
assistance.

CUCUG, which has been supporting local computer users in the Champaign-Urbana,
Illinois area since 1983 will now focus its efforts on local user group
activities.
