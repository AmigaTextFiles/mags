Thy          Do you plan to do advertising ? Considering that it should be
             worldwide, can you afford that ? To have the best machine is
             not enough if nobody knows that.  GA
{p} {p}
charig       Yes. We will be doing advertising (Tao and Amiga) with our
             partners.

Senex        How many developers are working currently on "Amiga Aurora"
             (i.e. the new OS <g>), and how many of them are from Amiga,
             how many from Tao? GA
{p} {p}
charig       Amiga has a dozen engineers growing, Tao has 60 + plenty of
             blue chip partners.

RUiNa        Q: Please take this all as one general question about
             marketing. With consoles and settop boxes allowing more
             ability and connectivity, and with super low pc prices,
             do you feel we'll compete with these pricewise or are you
             moving towards some other newer market? we all know marketing
             was the original amiga downfall. is the marketing planned
             and being taken care of by pro's? GA
{p} {p}
charig       Yes. We like to call them "hookers".
{p} {p}
charig       PS Where's Cooksey?
{p} {p}
charig       GA
{p} {p}
FryG_away    Q:will there be any new updates for WB3.5 ? GA
{p} {p}
situation    cooksey doesn't come on this channel any more ;)
{p} {p}
GuardianBOB  he's sitting in #Amiga-3D.  heh heh heh
{p} {p}
fleecy       We have a transitional plan for the Classic that we will
             announce with our partners.
{p} {p}
fleecy       GA
{p} {p}
Nico_Barbat_ Francis, Bill told on the press-conf. that you are an long-time
             Amiga-fan - in which effect could this be useful for the
             *developer* group? WHO is actually working on the new OS? GA
{p} {p}
NeRP^cF      fleecy: I'm talking to him right now.  My morning annoy-c0cksey
             routine.
{p} {p}
situation    hey, there's nothing wrong with Cooksey, he's just a
             misunderstood bloke
{p} {p}
charig       I'll take those in reverse order.
{p} {p}
charig       We already have the foundation layer. I'm not going to
             discuss o/s specifics today. The entire Tao engineering
             staff is working on software which will be utilised by the
             Amiga community.
{p} {p}
charig       Remember that it is not just that we are fans, we also have
             major Amiga engineering history at Tao.
{p} {p}

|MB|         Hello. I am a convinced amigaist, but in what this new
             repurchase is it different from the precedents? How long
             will last your new development? GA
{p} {p}
charig       What?
{p} {p}
charig       GA
{p} {p}
Szczepan-Bla Does new Amiga (or what is named) will have full support for
             "Classic" Amiga apps running just like normal one ? I mean
             that I can use any current program to edit/view/etc. any file
             from disk (not like it is in UAE). GA
{p} {p}
[breed-away] Just like to say that We will be winding down the live chat
             soon..
{p} {p}
[breed-away] so please make these your last questions...
{p} {p}
charig       Announcement soon.
{p} {p}
charig       GA
{p} {p}
ioni         Will there be PCI, AGP, USB, etc. ports in the 'new Amiga' ?
             And support for them ?  ga
{p} {p}

Reticuli     Guest45753 stated earlier (whoever that was and is now :-) ):
             "anyone who signs up to develop will have access to full
             APIs"... The API's WON'T be public domain? Is this wise? The
             Amiga excelled because of the back bedroom developers who
             just decided to have a quick dabble one night and has
             survived years in the wilderness because anyone could
             program it without having to become a formal developer.
             Or did I misinterpret that answer? GA
{p} {p}
[breed-away] Can we make these the last questions pls....
{p} {p}
charig       You are assuming that the development kit is going to be
             expensive... it won't be.
{p} {p}
charig       GA

CraiK        Q: I have got several commodore amiga computers including
             amiga 500, 1200, and CD-32, along with commodore 64. All
             i want to know is, what do you expect the future of the
             AMIGA world will be like (in general)? bright or dark? I
             just want you to make me feel comfortable about the AMIGA's
             future. I come from the middle east, btw just to let you
             know that we also DO care about the MIGGY ;) and thank you
             very much for your time, sirs. GA
