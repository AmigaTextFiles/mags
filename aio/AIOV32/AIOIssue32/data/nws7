Blittersoft have announced that they are importing the AmiJoe G3 cards into
the UK, and have placed a release date on them of February 2000. Very little
details are available other than that they will have full 68000 emulation. No
word on the PPC kernel to be used, but it would be reasonable to assume that
they will use the OS provided kit, WarpOS.
