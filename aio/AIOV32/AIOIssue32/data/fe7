Monitors
{p} {p}
This month's first tip comes in answer to some questions written in to me
by Intruder, so as service to any reading this you get to see it
reproduced here.
{p} {p}
The question concerned monitors. If in upgrading a monitor, dos one have
to get a multiscan or will it Have To synch down to 15Hz, or failing
that will have have to get a scan doubler/flicker-fixer (usually
pricey).  Furthermore, will a multiscan display all screen modes, and if
a graphics card is needed will it fit in a desktop machine.
{p} {p}
First answer, if you don't have a graphics card and 15Hz is the only
output from your mahcine, then yes you have to get somehting that synch
down to 15Hz. Not all Multiscans synch down to 15KHz, but some do. Some
shopping around should find you a good one, but in general they will be
a bit more expensive then Multiscans that don't. If you use one that
doesn't synch down then the native Amiga modes won't show up without a
scan doubler.

In general though, if you're thinking Multiscan then you're thinking
graphics card as well. Both the assorted Phase 5 cards and the Picasso
cards work well and will fit into any Zorro 3 slots (sometimes Zorro 2).
If you have an A1200 you'll have to check what's available for it or
possibly stuff it into a tower.

As far as what screen modes it displays, the monitor will display all
screen modes that fall within it's frequency range; check the monitor
specks to make sure.
{p} {p}
Once you have a monitor and graphics card, then a good screen-mode
promotion prgrams will handle all the old 15Hz screens without need of
a scan doubler or synching down to 15Hz. A promotore like NewMode or
such will handle your chores, though there are a few programs that will
not promote. There erant programs are mainly anything written in AMOS,
some games, and anything that hits the hardware directly.  Also, if the
monitor doesn't synch down to 15Hz you would not have access to your
bootscreen or startup screen (by pressing down both mouse buttons)

Finding Viruses
{p} {p}
Another quick virus tip: MUI custom classes. There's been such a
proliferation of custom classes lately, with everyone coming out with
their own updated versions of someone else's class, that these are a
perfect place to hide viruses in. So, until someone comes up with a
central site at which to exchange all these custom classes, keep an eye
on any updates, watching out for suspiciously large file size increases
for minor updates.
