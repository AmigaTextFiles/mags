Hi Everybody,
{p} {p}
Below is a e-mail conversation with Fleecy Moss to find out what Hardware the
Amiga will run on. It is edited to protect the innocent.....

Hope this clears up "some" of the questions.

Yes - it actually runs on a Virtual Processor,
and the first release of the next wave of
Amigas to the consumer can run on both x86
and PPC processors.

We are not going to get too wacky so if that box
doesn't do any wierd shit then it should be ok.
We are not going to get into the job of supporting
every bizarre combo in the world though.
HW partners will ship systems to the
dealers and they will have ensured that if
they do anything wierd, they support it.

That was one of the mistakes that Be made.

It can be passed on - you answer the questions
it generates though ;-)
