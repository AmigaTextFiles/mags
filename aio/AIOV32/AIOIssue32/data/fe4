A recent post by Fleecy Moss of Amiga gives some ifdea of where the
new company will go. A pretty detailed plan for a company so new, it
proves that these guys mean business and aren't about to rest on
their rears like past wannabe-saviors. Read on and you'll see what I
mean.{p}

Fleecy Moss outlines Amiga's plan ...
{p} {p}
In my trawling around the community hangouts, I have come across
several misconceptions, rumours, and a lot of confusion. Whilst I
can't hope to answer everything, here are some things I want to set
straight.
{p} {p}
0. Amiga will build a digital content universe. Digital content means
anything composed of 0 and1 - applications, video, audio, games,
emails, whatever. We will focus on 2 markets, the pathfinder
market, for digital adventurers, power users, gamers, content
creators, DTPers, artists, video  ppl and those who refuse to
define a computer as a digital appliance. Our second market will
cocentrate on the Domestic Digital Habitat (DDH).
{p} {p}
1. If you are a personal computer person, there will be a personal
computer second wave Amiga.
{p} {p}
2. We will support classic development in so much as we want to help
users and developers transition to a new machine. That will be the
total extent of our support for the classic machine. If this
involves further AmigaOS releases, then so be it.
{p} {p}
3. We are targetting x86 and PPC for the first consumer release of
Pathfinder products (if you are a personal computer person, this
means you).
{p} {p}
4. We will do everything in our power (that doesnt bankrupt us or
interfere with our primary goals) to ensure classic Amiga
software runs on the new machine in some form or another.. The new
Amiga product family (formerly called AQUA) will run natively and
hosted. This is to create a large market fast  for Amiga
developers to profit from. For the first pathfinder release it
will run hosted to see this market grow fast. We see one of our
core duties as serving the developers.
{p} {p}
6. We are talking to the Phoenix Consortium about common interests.
{p} {p}
7. We have been contacted by QNX but currently have no plans to work
with them.
{p} {p}
8. We will develop Amiga products for another market, the Domestic
Digital Habitat (DDH) market. This markets will be kept separate
but products will work together if the installer so desires it.
{p} {p}
9. There will be a new website and it will be public shortly. It has
been tested on all browsers, Amiga and non Amiga, and given the
compatibility problems between the implementations of open
standards, our best effort has been made. The site   will grow
quickly and more information will be added. We want it to become a
village where all Amigans can come to voice their opinions, chat,
and travel off  to different parts of the Amiga universe.
{p} {p}
a. A developer support manager has been selected and they are working
on implementing   the developer support program. This will be in
place before the developer boxes are released.
{p} {p}
b. The developer boxes are specced out, we have contacted several
whitebox manufacturers and we are building the distribution.
{p} {p}
c. Amiga will not provide dates until we have a product. We will
share timelines, but will not attach dates to them. Enough damage has
already been done.
{p} {p}
d. We have had acceptances from 75% of our development team and their
names and roles will be announced once we get back from training
(before the end of the month).
{p} {p}
This mail can be redistributed without modification within the
community. As further questions and issues come up, we will attempt
to answer them.
