Beet is yet another Swatch Beat clock... To show the time in the new (and improved?)
time made by Swatch, to remove the timezones... Ie, when it's @800 in USA it will
also be @800 in Japan or Europe!

No installation needed, eccept setting the correct TZ variable if it's not already
set!

Beet has some nice options, it can easily be used by scripts since it doesn't open
a GUI, only prints the time at the start of it! It can also be used in the same
way as Wait, ie 'Beet WAIT @500' will do the exact thing as 'Wait UNTIL=12:00'!
If you don't add the argument ONCE it will update the time regurarly!

It has some other features to, but they aren't that important... It's a small
Beat Clock, that's it, ideal for scripts!
{p} {p}
The .Guide it comes with is the funniest I have read in my whole life... It's true!
It's not as stiff as the rest of them, it contains alot of jokes, and the features
are written as two people sat there and chatted to eachother! (They are called Jim
and Mike)  And under the Bugs section, it's a button, with the following text under
it: "In case of a bug break glass and press button"...{p}
The Guide also has a "secret" section, not so hard to find :)
