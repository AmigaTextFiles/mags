Hello our great readers, welcome to another exciting installment
of our production, i'm glad to see you back and hope you continue
to read our work.
{p} {p}
The sales talk out the way, I am honestly glad to see you reading
our production as it does give us some peace of mind that people
actually like our work and also that it is worth continuing with
our production.
{p} {p}
I must make a big appology to you, the readers for the little work
I personally have been putting into the magazine over the last
few months. I'm glad my editorial team is hard working and continues
to put life into our magazine. I will try to sort out the problem
of my lack of work on the magazine in the next coming issues.
{p} {p}
I must also appologise for two other things. Firstly sorry again
for another week delayed issue, this is not acceptable and I will
do my upmost to make sure future issues are released on the date
stated. The second thing is only two games reviews this month,
neither of which where done by myself, so a great big thank-you
goes to Mike Saunders & Hugo Wilkinson for the reviews they did.
I hope you can forgive me for my lack of effort of which I am
very sorry for.
{p} {p}
Some exciting news is that Hugo Wilkinson will be from issue 33
onwards our new Games Editor, so look out for a filled Games
section and hopefully some quality work of which I have lacked
doing these last few months.

We have had very little interest in our Christmas Competition, so
there is still lots of chance of winning the bumper selection of
prizes we have up for grabs, check out the link from our main
menu which is easy to spot!

Until next issue have a good time!
