Another shot finally sent the soldier to the ground. The battle had been
long and treacherous. The Empire was all over the field, himself
seemingly the last to hold out against it. But the losses had been far
more costly then expected; his allies had been all but destroyed, some
had even betrayed him, why even Command had turned it's back on him and
left him for the vultures to pick at his motherboard. Even now, CPU
overheating, case cracked, hard drive pressed to the limits, he couldn't
hold out much longer. His only shame was that he was not able to fight
for those he had sword to protect, that the last banner of freedom he
bore would slip down to the ground and be trod upon by the all-powerful
Empire.
{p} {p}
He staggered; another shot hit him in the back, this one from his own
Command.  This was it; he fell, the banner bearing the image of the
sacred checkered ball slipping from his fingers. His mouse-cord flailed
helplessly as his CRT at long last hit the muddy field.
{p} {p}
Out of nowhere, a hand suddenly clasped onto his own; a grip of steel
backed by the strength of an elephant. It lifted him bodily up out of
the mud, while all around the shells of combat continued to fall. But
they didn't reach here, not while his unforseeen benefactor held him.
He was placed back onto his feet, the mud wiped off his monitor and
case, a drink of fresh Lucre pressed gently into his front drive port.
Ah, the nourishment felt good, and with the mud removed from his CRT he
could see clearly for the first time in a long while. But what was this
helping hand here in the middle of this no-man's-land of a battle field?
{p} {p}
A tall man dressed in a smart new uniform.  He snapped a hand up in a
stiff salute, heels clicking together.
{p} {p}
"General McEwan, of the People's revolutionary Forces, at your service
sir."
{p} {p}
The soldier stared disbelieving for two whole verbal blanks; it just
wasn't possible.  The last time Command had sent someone out to help him
it had been with a gun in his own back!
{p} {p}
"We've overthrown Command and taken over," General McEwan explained,
"The People are in command now; the old order has been strung up with
the laundry. I'm here on behalf of the People to offer you our full
backing; we're already organizing some relief troops to help you out."
{p} {p}
Even as he spoke, in the distance the soldier could hear the distant
sounds of new troops rallying; he could see a line of pitchforks, old
keyboards, and angry fists forming at the edge of the battle field. The
people he had sworn to protect from the ravages of the Empire were
coming to HIS aide!  He still couldn't believe it.
{p} {p}
"Sorry we took so long," General McEwan said, "We should have done this
a long time ago, but it took a while for Lietenant-General Moss and I to
deal with those back-stabbing traitors back at Command.  Here, let me
help you."
{p} {p}
As General McEwan lent a welcome hand to the limping nearly dead
soldier, fending off the bullets and shells that constantly targeted in
on them, the aging warrior couldn't help but shake his head in wonder
and relief. It was a miracle.
{p} {p}
"And sir," the General addressed him, "I would like to say how much of
an Honor it is to serve you."
{p} {p}
The soldier sighed, feeling hope for the first time.  Already, the
People's forces were on the field of battle, while in the distance the
dark malevolent eyes of the Empire looked on with sudden interest at
this sudden change in events.
{p} {p}
And for the first time, the Emperor felt fear.

Here's hoping that the new Millenia brings with it a new age in
computers, one in which the Amiga will rise to play the increasingly
important role it has so long deserved.
