Hello,
{p} {p}
Well.  I feel I have to say something about the rather surprising
developments in our cosy little community.  Out with the old and in
with the new as they say.
{p} {p}
Personally, I'm glad that Amiga is once again being put through the
wringer.  It is squeezing out a rather large cancer that was Gateway
and the very dirty water that used to be Commodore and all the other
past Amiga owners, and letting the fresh air (Amino/Tao) blow the
cobwebs out of the shirt.
{p} {p}
So what happens next?  Simple answer to that one: we wait! (Though not
for too long with any luck).  Myself I will be wearing the shirt the
second it comes out of the wringer - even without ironing it first!
{p} {p}
I am soon to get an Amiga 4000 to add to my already well expanded
1200T.  No doubt I will have towered the 4000 up within 3 months! and
hopefully I will be able to endow it with a nice fast G4 soon after.
{p} {p}
Then I will patiently wait for a new generation of Amiga's to "WoW"
the world.  There is, however, two things I want of the new Amiga's,
and both things are purley selfish! - 
{p} {p}
a) The ability to link the 1200 and 4000 up to the new Amiga's so
that they can "talk" to each other and share drives and,{p}
b) The ability to emulate my current set-ups so that all my existing
sofware can be used on the all new power machines.
{p} {p}
Both reasons are selfish, both reasons save me money but in the short
term this will provide a VERY solid start base for the new machine.
And this is, after all, why a lot of new equipment (not just computers)
fail within their infancy - lack of support, ready-to-run applications
and also too expensive.  That of course is another thing: any
groundbreaking machine should be as affordable as the 500 was in its
day, and just as good!
{p} {p}
I say good luck to Amino and Amiga in general.  You have my support
all the way, and beyond!

I Bought Amiga OS 3.5 upgrade whilst in the UK over the festive season,
also caught the flu for free but thats another story. Have spent the
last couple of days attempting to install it, or to be more exact trying
to backup my hard drive in order to repartition the drive, the workbench
partition was too small to accommodate OS 3.5. Backed up Workbench no
problem (10 Floppies) Was informed that I needed 40340 floppies to backup
the Work partition which I thought a bit execesive. Decided I could
reinstall the software direct from originals after completing the
partitioning and installing OS 3.5. This was where the real problems
surfaced because after clicking on the  HDToolbox icon in Tools all I
get is a window titled "Hard Drive Preparation, Partitioning & Formating"
with the following information centred in the window. "Checking SCSI.
Device Address 1 Unit 0. And that is all, the screen has frozen and a
soft reset is the only way to get things going again. What to do?
My computer details are as follows:{p}
A1200 Rev 1a{p}
Blizzard 030/40 with 2x 16 meg sims{p}
1x 250 Quantum 2.5" Hard Drive{p}
CD Rom through SCSI{p}
Software installed includes Opus Magellan 11, Turboprint, Wordworth, Ibrowse 2
etc. non of my software is pirated, ie all paid for and registered.
Hopefully someone can point me in the right direction.
Thanks in advance,{p}

Hi there!
{p} {p}
I am writing in response to your article entitled "The Demo Scene on
Trial" reply.  I must say that as a long time scener I agree totally with
your sentiments regarding Tony Horgan's comments.  I too read his article
with more than a little distaste.  Although the demo scene originally grew
out of the pirate/cracking scene it has become an institution in it's own
right, and IMHO the majority of the Amiga's most talented programmers are
sceners.
{p} {p}
For many people, the scene is what makes the Amiga the Amiga and it has
contributed greatly to the longevity of our beloved machine.  If you
don't like the scene then fine, but to go bashing it in the ignorant way
that Tony Horgan did is not on.  As you say, let's see {bold}him{nobold} write an
amazing demo in pure 680x0/PPC assembly language, and {bold}then{nobold} he might have
the privilege of putting down those members of the scene who dedicate a
good proportion of their time to what is arguably the most imaginative and
lively aspect of the Amiga!
