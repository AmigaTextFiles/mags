fxPAINT comes on a CD, and it constists of 276.3MB of data...
{p} {p}
First of all, what's on the CD you may think, well, first of all, it's fxPAINT :)
{p} {p}
They have also put in demos of three other programs: BlackIRC (IRC-client),
MultiLiveCam (software to have a webcam on your Amiga) and VLRec_NG (video software).
{p} {p}
The fxPAINT part consists of the following: The Program, Developer Section (for
ARexx scripts and plugins), Sample pictures and Workshops, a 222MB video that
shows how to use fxPAINT (really cool)...
{p} {p}
So, after the check on what it consists of, we are now ready to install fxPAINT.
{p} {p}
The installation is with a standard Commodore (???) installer, and it's not hard
at all... It uses less than 2.5MB of HD space...
{p} {p}
When the installation has finished, I was very eager to start it, and so I did,
but that's when the trouble started... It kept crashing, whatever I did, I couldn't
even change the screenmode without it crashing.. So I thought that something could
have went wrong during the installation, so naturally I removed it and tried again,
but with the same results... It really p***ed me off, because the program looked
so cool...
{p} {p}
Since I had no idea on what to do, and it was very late, I sat down and watched the
movie, and it described how to do a very nice flame, and add some different effects
to it...
{p} {p}
The next day I was determined to get fxPAINT running, but without success, I then
went online and started to ask around, and it didn't take long until I noticed that
they had released an upgrade (Enhancement Kit 1), so I dled the 300kb of it and
installed it, now it would finally start without crashing as soon as I tried to
do anything with it! YAY, boy was i happy!
{p} {p}
So now I had it working, okay, it was hard but that's not fun otherwise :) (And
when I tried it on a friends machine, it works without problems, okay, you still
need Enhancement Kit 1, but after that it will work OK!)
{p} {p}
The User Interface uses imagebuttons, they are true 24-bit images, so it looks
really nice! The UI really looks like Photogenics 4.x's... But that's only a good
thing IMHO...
{p} {p}
When I was going to create a new Image, I was presentated with the following choices:
Filled, ScanQuix, VHI, Fractal, Fire and Grab Screen. So you can create new images
from alot of sources! Filled is a normal, one colour image, ScanQuix will import an
image from the Scanner (which I don't have) through ScanQuix, VHI uses a VLab (which
I don't have), Fractal let's you choose from for different kinds of fractals, Fire
will make a fire and grab screen will grab a screen.
{p} {p}
The Save function was very dissapointing, you can only save in the following formats:
BMP, PGM, PPM, JPEG, RGB8, TARGA, NewIcon and IFF24. That's not much at all!
{p} {p}
There is more than ten paint modes, like, line, square, fill, rectangle etc..
{p} {p}
There is also alot and alot of different effects, like: Oil Painting, Button Border,
Blur (many different), distorts etc... And then you can also make plugins for it if
it's a effect that's missing!
{p} {p}
There is also a very nice Brush Manager, what it does, well, it manages brushes :)
Okay, I will tell you a little more, first it let's you choose what kind of brush
you want to use for the moment! You can also create new brushes from a loaded
picture, font, or select style/size... There is alot of possibilities here.
{p} {p}
And there is alot more you can do, but I won't make you die of boredom...
{p} {p}
Let's move over to the fxALBUM shall we!
{p} {p}
fxALBUM is a program within fxPAINT that let's you ALBUMize your pictures! It's a
very easy procedure, just create a new album, add a file or directory and it will
show thumbnails of the pictures in a window!
{p} {p}
When I tried to add a dir with 149 pictures, it showed a requester saying
"DEMO VERSION - PLEASE REGISTER", I then though "WHAT?"... Because if they supply
anything inside the program, I would just take it for granted that it would also
be registered, but no... But, since it's under the EXTRAS menu, I guess it's just
EXTRAS that he wants to promote, nothing bad with that!!
{p} {p}
After you have added your pictures, you can do some very nice things:
Edit Picture (will edit in fxPAINT), Create HTML Album (great for publishing
your album on the net), make a slideshow or print the album.
{p} {p}
When doing the slideshow, it will show all the pictures, and change every 3
seconds!
{p} {p}
Another EXTRA is fxCONV, and fxCONV is a small program to convert pictures...
Add pictures to the list, select the destination format, and convert...
{p} {p}
When I tried fxCONV and added the same pictures many times, it crashed... Not
good. Well, not really so much to write about fxCONV.. Very easy to understand
and use.
{p} {p}
And the last EXTRA is fxIMAGEMAP, as you probably understand by the name, this
one creates imagemaps, to be used on the world wide web! Very easy to use that
too...

Probably around 90% if it wasn't so unstable and unfriendly to use for me, so
please, this review doesn't show how good it is when it works as it should!!!
