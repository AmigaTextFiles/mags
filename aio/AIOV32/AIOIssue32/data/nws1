Executive Update
{p} {p}
January 3, 2000
{p} {p}
YeeHaw and welcome to the year 2000;
{p} {p}
I want to make something very clear from the beginning we have been told, that
Amiga was purchased by Gateway because of the Patents, and that there were not
even aware of the Amiga installed base, or the people.
{p} {p}
Gateway purchased Amiga because of Patents, we purchased Amiga because of the
People.
{p} {p}
Without the people standing behind, developing, creating, purchasing and
continuing to believe in the Amiga there never would have been anything for
Gateway to purchase. We recognize this, and it is because of you, and what you
have continued to accomplish with Amiga that we have purchased the company.
{p} {p}
I want to make sure that everyone knows and understands what this all means to
you the true Amigans.
{p} {p}
Here is what was acquired from Gateway:
{p} {p}
 1. All trademarks logo's etc.{p}
 2. All existing inventory of Amiga International.{p}
 3. All existing licenses.{p}
 4. License to All Amiga patents (Gateway still owns the patents, but we are
able to use them).{p}
 5. All web sites, and registered domain names.{p}
 6. The Amiga OS and all that is associated with the OS.{p}
 7. The Amiga operation as it exists today.
{p} {p}
Specific details of the developer system, the OS partners and how one can
begin developing will be released in the next couple of weeks.
{p} {p}
We will be making an announcement on January 8th, 2000 with one of our
partners at CES in Las Vegas, and more details will follow that release.
{p} {p}
Fleecy, Myself, Petro, and the rest of the team are not going to make promises
and create presentations and demos. We are going to deliver products,
services, and the rest of the world will know what you have already known.
{p} {p}
We will be officially changing the name of Amino Development Corporation to
the Amiga Corporation this week, and we will let everyone know of this change
shortly once it is officially completed.
{p} {p}
I want to thank all of you for your continued support we will make Amiga what
it should have been, and more importantly what it will be.
{p} {p}
Keeping the faith,
{p} {p}
