ReportPlus is a small program that can do three things. They are: Bug Report
Generator, Aminet ReadMe Generator and ACSE administrator!
{p} {p}
So, let's look at the three parts...
{p} {p}
The first one is the Bug Report Generator!
This is supposed to be used to report bugs to Amiga! It's reverse-engineered
from the original... Here you can choose exactly the problem etc... But you can't
really send it, since the old Amiga addresses (from way back) isn't actually
working... (if this came as a shock, where have u been living the past 5 years?)
{p} {p}
The second one is the Aminet ReadMe Generator!
This is a very simple Aminet ReadMe creator, it will present you with a number
of string gadgets, which you fill in those that you want to use, nothing else,
then press the appropriate button and the ReadMe will be created, nothing more
nothing less...
{p} {p}
The third one is the ACSE administrator!
This is a quite fun thing to test, it will show your knowledge about general
programming on the Amiga, and also a little about the hardware. So ReportPlus
is worth downloading just for this part, very fun! When I tried it I managed to
get 6 out of 25 correct answers, beat that if you can! :) Quote from Guide:
", so of the 25 questions you must answer at least 24 of them correctly."
Well, it's a tad more than I got! :)
{p} {p}
So, what use will you have with this, well, the only use you get is a simple
way of creating Aminet ReadMe's (although it's alot more powerful ReadMe
creators available on Aminet!), and the ACSE administrator test isn't so
useful maybee, but it's alot of fun!
