According to the author, this game is based around an old classic on
the spectrum titled "HotShot". After failing to find an Amiga version of
the game when his Spectrum clapped out, he set about programming his
own - and here it is.
{p} {p}
Made with no less than 5 different packages HotSpots is a pang/brick
combination game. You control one of two men, with what appears to be
some sort of sucking device (much like todays vacuums!). With this
technologically ground breaking device, you attempt to guide a ball
around the screen destroying as many bricks as possible whilst
skillfully collecting the many Power-Ups located in the center of the
screen.
{p} {p}
When the ball drops to the floor, you can suck it up with your vacuum
cleaner and launch it back into play. You have to be careful though, you
can only use so much vacuum power for so long at a time - or it explodes!!!!
{p} {p}
This event sadly, introduces the only (apparently) and annoying bug. The
game simply exits and returns you to Workbench. The same happens if you
press ESC at any time and there is no way to pause the action.
{p} {p}
The bug out the way, the game is of good programming quality. The
graphics are that of myself (rather poor but does the job). The sound is
a collection of different frequency buzz's..

The game controls are simple enough. You run a bloke back and fourth
(left and right) within his area and you can use left and right again
with the FIRE key/button to rotate the gun/vacuum cleaner to the desired
angle. FIRE by itself does the sucking!!!

One last note - the author prefers for you not to see the intro-sequence
title animation. To see it, you must start the game, enabled the intro,
save the settings, quit and finally re-load the game. Modest chat eh?
{p} {p}
Verdict: A game idea that is good, but could do with some spicing up in
following versions. Perhaps no gravity, super bricks etc.
