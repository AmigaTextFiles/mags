David Crawford, One of our readers, has made up a basic little utility for those
with many archives of AIO issues and no way to wort through them and
has kindly given it to AIO and we in turn are giving this exclusivly
to our readers.  It's called ReadAIO and will list out the issues in
the directory AIO_Archives in a lister then allow searching and the opening
of archives and readmes at a double-click.  All info you'll need is in
the readme file.

The program requires rexxtricks.library, and since the built-in
language of that library is German then English users must have the
Ebglish catalogue installed from the library's archive to read some of
the buttons.

You'll find it as an LHA archive in the directory
"AIOIssue66/ReadAIO/".  Just look for ReadAIO.LHA and ReadAIO.readme
and enjoy the program.
