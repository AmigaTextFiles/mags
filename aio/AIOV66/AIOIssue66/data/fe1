I imagine by now you've been over-inundated with way too much Xmas
(since about before Halloween, by my estimate) and I'm not going to
add to that.  So, behold a variety of off-the-wall sites and images of
pure escapism...

One of the best SciFi series around is in more trouble then the crew
of a certain living ship has ever been in; the Sci-Fi Channel is
canceling it.  But wait, perhaps something can be done?  Go to this
site and see what might be done to convince the SciFi Channel to keep
it around.

{bold}TopFive.com{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.topfive.com/{noitalic}{p}
The mother of all top-whatever lists, from "Top 18 complaints of Mrs.
Claus" and "Top 14 signs you don't take rejection well" to "Signs your
pet is a terrorist" and "least-loved Smurfs". Register for about 12USD
a year and get more access to their lists.  Fun stuff.

{bold}The Movie Pit{nobold}{p}
{italic}Serving the movie watch{noitalic}{p}
As their tagline says, the best reviews of the worst movies, from the
bad-but-funny to the truly bad, complete with a rating in terms of
numbers of wedges of cheese.  While I don't think Logan's Run was bad (avctually a
classic of the time), something like "Disco Godfather" or "Bad
Channel" are definitely on the list of cheap rentals.  Here the
reviews are almost as entertaining of some of the movies.

{bold}The Funny Name Server{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.funnyname.com/{noitalic}{p}
Straight forward concept, look through the phonebooks and pick out all
the funny ones... a lot of which I can't repeat here, but they're
{italic}actual{noitalic} names.  Just go there and start reading for
yourself.

{bold}Windy's Design Studio{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.windyweb.com/design/index.html{noitalic}{p}
So, at least one practical site, useful for those web designers out
there.  Backgrounds, graphics, web designs, templates, and all for
free.
{pp}
Thumbnails show the different themes then you can download them with
just a single click.  Different templates each month, all zipped and
ready.  The design galleries include fonts, buttons, flash banners,
bars, java scripts, and more, all categorized and ready.  Need some
more?  Then there's the expected links to other places with clip art
and animations.
{pp}
With quite a lot of useful things there, this site should be added to
the list of design-useful sites for all you web designers out there.
