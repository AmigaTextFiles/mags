{bold}Filesystems{nobold}
{pp}
FFS2 FastFileSystem2, fully compatible to FastFileSystem{p}
Data integrity is a priority. All structures are tested for compliance and
errors.{p}
Completely reentrant. {p}
Multithreaded design; attempts are made to schedule all file system operations fairly and evenly.
This means that reads, writes, directory scanning and all other file system operations can take
place seemingly in parallel with no client tying up the file system for extended periods of
time.{p}
Hard links and soft links supported.{p}
'Smart' block allocation system which tries to distribute the contents of directories
evenly across the media and which attempts to allocate large numbers of data blocks
consecutively.{p}
Integrated block caching with LRU cache management. Only file system data structures
are cached -- no caching is performed on data blocks (the exception are OFS data
blocks, which are in fact cached).{p}
Support for removable media; this includes the option to remove a medium from
one drive, insert it into another and to keep working with it.{p}
Support for media larger than 4GBytes, provided that the underlying device
driver supports the NSD or TD64 command extensions.{p}
Support for variable block sizes, i.e. a block can be a multiple of the basic
sector size (512 bytes, 1024 bytes, 2048 bytes per block, etc.).{p}
Support for sector sizes beyond the traditional 512 bytes.{p}
Block memory alignment ('mask') requirements permitted beyond the traditional 2, 4 and 8 bytes.{p}
Drive motor stays enabled as long as the file system is busy; when the motor is switched off,
it is always safe to remove the disk.{p}
Changes to directory contents are propagated up the entire file system hierarchy;
the original file system would only update the parent directory.{p}
All file system types and variants implemented up to and including DCFS (1993) are supported:
original file system (OFS), fast file system (FFS), international OFS, international FFS,
directory caching OFS and directory caching FFS.{p}
Directory scanning code should not be vulnerable to directory entries getting removed
while the same directory is still being scanned.{p}
Support for owner/group IDs attached to files and directories.{p}
Complex and sophisticated error reporting code; unfortunately, to be compatible with
the original file system implementation, only a lowly subset of the error indications can be displayed.{p}
Support for multiple readers and writers which access the same file. Concurrent readers
and writers are supported as well, with special treatment to avoid collisions.{p}
File read and write accesses are clustered if they refer to blocks placed consecutively on the medium.{p}
Support for record locking.{p}
Support for file notification that even extends to linked objects (change the 'original'
object, and notification requests attached to links to it will be satisfied).{p}
Support for ExAll() style directory scanning.{p}
Setting the size of a file to an arbitrary size (truncation or 'growing') supported.{p}
Formatting the media, setting up the file system's data structures supported. This includes
support for serializing the file system.{p}
Built-in file system validator{p}
Long file name support (names can be up to 107 characters in size) in the DOS\6 and DOS\7 variants.
{pp}
SFS SmartFilesystem{p}
Fast reading of directories.{p}
Fast seeking, even in extremely large files.{p}
Blocksizes of 512 bytes up to 32768 bytes (32 kB) are supported.{p}
Supports large partitions.{p}
The limit is about 2000 GB, but it can be more depending on the blocksize.{p}
Support for partitions larger than 4 GB or partitions located (partially) beyond
the 4 GB barrier on your drive.{p}
There is support for New Style Devices (NSD) which support 64 bit access, the 64-bit
trackdisk commands and SCSI direct.{p}
The length of file and directory names is internally limited only by blocksize.
Limitations in the original dos.library however will reduce the effective length of
file and directory names to about 100 characters.{p}
The size of a file in bytes is limited to slightly less than 4 GB. Because of limitations
in original dos.library we will however probably not allow files larger than
2 GB, to avoid potential problems.

Modifying data on your disk is very safe.  Even if your system is resetted, has crashed
or experienced a powerloss than your disk will not be corrupted and will not
require long validation procedures before you will be able to use it again.  In the worst
case you will only lose the last few modifications made to the disk.  See Safe writing
for detailed information on how this works.
{pp}
To be able to ensure that your disk never gets corrupted we use an internal caching system which
keeps track of modifications before writing them to disk. This cache has the additional
benefit that creating and copying files can be a lot faster, especially if the drive used isn't
very fast (ZIP & floppy drives for example).
{pp}
There is a built-in low-level read-ahead cache system which tries to speed up small disk
accesses.  This cache has as a primary purpose to speed up directory reading but also
works very well to speed up files read by applications which use small buffers.
{pp}
Disk space is used very efficiently{p}
Supports notification and Examine All{p}
Supports Soft links (hard links are not supported for now).{p}
Using the SFSformat command you can format your SFS partition with case sensitive or case
insensitive file and directory names. Default is case insensitive (like FFS).{p}
There is a special directory which contains the last few files which were deleted. See deldir.
{pp}
Other file systems (like PFS3) run emulated

{bold}Tools {nobold}{p}
Low level Graphical tools for FFS and SFS (Salvage, Fix in place for damaged volumes, etc...)

Hardware layer abstraction through a standard MorphOS device.{p}
Automatic binding without requiring user interaction:{p}
Real Plug'n'Play{p}.
