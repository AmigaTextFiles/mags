Blastchamber (60 MB) and Jailbreak (30 MB) are now online on the Amiga Quake 2
Page. Both were "Mods of the Week" on Planetquake somewhen in the past, and
especially Jailbreak (killed players don't die - they go to jail, and their
teammates have to free them) is quite well-known. Jailbreak was done by the
same Mod-Team like Gloom.
