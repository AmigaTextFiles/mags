Hi Mark:{p}
Thanks for latest issue. I see issue 65 is 2 Mb. The pics from the
WOASE show is probably why!{p}
Your #64 Editorial was relevant. Amiga Inc. is too small to be having
disputes within itself. It reminds me of the movie -- Pirates of Silicon
Valley.{p}
( Bill Gates didn't like it! Oh, I wonder why !:) Anyway, Apple suffered
from internal problems: the old 'e' division resented the Macintosh division.
A house divided is not good for business. I hope AI can stay integrated
with a good attitude and the rift with MOS is resolved.{p}
Your piece on the Amiga & M$ in JustAmiga ML was interesting.
I think MS is too big to blunder; a 'faux pas' maybe. I would like to know
what MS really sees in Amiga! =:o It can't be games; Box does good.
It can't be business & office; MS owns all that. It's got to be the AmigaDE
and Amiga Anywhere thing and telephony. BTW, there is a corporation
called Amiga Telephony. Now, that's interesting! =:o{p}
I've ordered my A1 back in May. CompuQuick says they'll be getting
to me "after Dec. 31" It would be sweet to checkout AIO in the AmigaOne!
Help, I slipping into a day dream...{p}
