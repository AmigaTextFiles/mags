Well, kinda lonely in here; everyone eems to be on vacation or
something.  Must be them Holidays I hear tell about.  Not sure which
one to wish everybody seeing as how many countries this mag is found in
(do I start with Christmas, Hanuka, Kwanza, Ramadan, or what?), so
I'll just stick with a generic Happy Holidays, and a Happy New Year
for those of you on the old Gregorian calendar.

And now for a message from our sponsor...  Have you recently lost $50
and expect a shirt and coupon to arrive round about now?  Well guess
what, so have I and a bunch of others.  We know Amiga's busy trying to
get this all off the ground but could someone tell them to get going
on that otjher Amiga Club stuff?  The coupon and shirt would at least
make for a sense of something going somewhere.

And while we're at it, you'll notice in the news section that MOrphOS
recently posted it's rather-complete listing of what's in their OS
package, what's compatible, etc..  Maybe about time for Amiga to do
the same?

I was really hoping for a new Ami this Christmas and marketing-wise
it's about the best time they could have released something.  So
what's haappening Amiga?  We've not heard anything out of you on this
subject on a while.  Amiga, are you listening...?
