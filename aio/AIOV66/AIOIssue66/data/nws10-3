{bold}Rave3D - Low level 3D Graphic Drivers (v1.6 implementation){nobold}
{pp}
Rave is a low level 3D driver API. Its design has been discussed and defined by major key graphic companies like ATI.
The MorphOS version is implementing most of it and is adding some extensions like automatic and transparent double buffering,
ZBuffer access... It is completely integrated with the 2D drivers system.
{pp}
Features of the Driver API:{p}
* Vertex array{p}
* Global states{p}
* Multi-Texturing{p}
* Fogging{p}
* OpenGL blending modes{p}
* Antialiasing{p}
* Compressed textures{p}
* Trilinear texture filtering{p}
* Mipmapping{p}
* Texture memory access{p}
* Textures can be bound on a screen bitmap{p}
* Deep Z buffering (greater or equal to 24bits per pixel){p}
* Scaled draw context{p}
* Fully extensible via tags, including the addition of functions{p}.
* Complete blackbox design.
{pp}
Hardware Drivers:{p}
* 3dfx Voodoo3 (Avenger){p}
* SIS 6326{p}
* 3DLabs/TI Permedia2 and 2v{p}
* CVisionPPC (Permedia2){p}
* BVisionPPC (Permedia2)
