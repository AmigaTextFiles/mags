How many of you use Wordworth like me?  Okay, now how many have
realized that that program, while good enough in many ways, has a big
memory problem (I can see those bytes dripping out all over the
place).  After the program closes it leaves eneough junk all over your
RAM so that it is not a matter of IF the next major program suite will
crash but WHEN, especially for such major (and beta-test heavy) apps
such as web browsers (this goes double for Voyager).  Doing an Avail
FLUSH does nothing to stall this off, so when you exit WordWorth,
save yourself some trouble and just reboot to clear out all that RAM
and THEN fire up that Internet software (Voyager specifically has
enough trouble being a 300K reset program without help from
Wordworth).

And while we're on the subject of Voyager, if you think that things
like Enforcer or CyberGuard will fend off a crash or two, except for
the occassional FLash thread hanging, forget it.  Voyager crashes
bypass all software that might attempt to capture them and goes
straight to reset.  All I vcan say for this is when (if?) the next
browser update comes out- no boubt in time for the OS4 package- we can
hope that we'll be given a real browser program that has the capacity
other platforms see (though one would hope certainly NOT the bloat).
