Thomas Frieden, Hyperion Entertainment: "We will have a generic PCI solution in OS4,
meaning that you will not have to write for a specific PCI bridge. However, we can of
course only support PCI bridges we get documentation for. Currently, this includes
the Prometheus and probably also the Mediator. The G-Rex will *not* be
supported."{p}
Ben Hermans, Hyperion Entertainment: "OpenPCI library will not be ported to OS 4.0,
at least not for the GREX. The author has confirmed to Hyperion that bPlan has forbidden
him to do anything which would result in GREX support for OS 4."

G-Rex Petition started online{p}
Mr. M. Lueck has set up a online petition to get developer docs from DCE so that
AmigaOS4 can support the G-Rex with its generic pci library.
