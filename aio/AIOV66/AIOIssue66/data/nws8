Just in time for the fair we have received the produced fxPAINT 2.0
CD-ROMs. Thus, you can buy updates and full versions of this graphics
allrounder at our booth. More detailed information on the new
features in the latest and brand-new fxPAINT-release can be found at
our pages for fxPAINT 2.0. Also in time for the fair, development on
VHI Studio 6.0 has been finalized. Besides many small improvements,
support for USB-cardreaders (Poseidon only for now) and PCI-TV-boards
under Amithlon (via AmithlonTV) are the highlights of this new
version. fxSCAN 4.0, released just a few months ago, will of course
be available as well as all other products we have in our product
portfolio.
