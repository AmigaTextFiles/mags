'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the row
Not a program was stirring, not even Office Pro.
The PCs were stacked, all snug in their racks,
In fear of Microsoft fast on their tracks.
{pp}
The programmers were slumped, face-down on the screens,
cans of Jolt Cola, and tech manuals be seen.
The CD on load and I in the hall,
Had just settled in, for a long Windoz Install.
{pp}
When out on the Net there arose such a clatter,
I had to log on, to see what was the matter.
I turned on the modem and logged on with a click,
But as usual with Microsoft, too many minutes to tick.
{pp}
A moon shone through my screen with an ominous glow.
I thought at first it must be my OS shredding it all into snow.
But what instead should it turn out to mean,
but a red-checked Boing Ball, bouncing across my screen.
{pp}
With a fresh OS and hardware now done,
I knew in an instant, it must be Amiga One.
More rapid than Windoz more powerful than DOS,
It charged through my screen like it knew who was Boss.
{pp}
"No lag no bloat, no turn on and crash!
No more software that costs way too much cash!
The fastest in speed the smallest in size,
Amongst OSes this truly's a prize!"
{pp}
With all this here too good to be true,
I feared Bill Gates would come buy it from out of the blue.
But to the top of the shelf, the top of the Net,
When it came in for sale, I knew not to fret.
{pp}
And then as I sat there gawking in shock,
I could already hear the PCers starting to mock.
But when I tore open the box and started it to boot,
It was soon their own machines, they then wanted to shoot.
{pp}
The Workbench dressed in color, sound, and it all so slick,
Then the apps ran so fast, I knew it'd make them sick.
Through the CD I browsed and ran app after app,
yet no matter how many I ran, the resorces did not sap.
{pp}
The icons how they sparkled, the sound was so clean,
it was hard to believe, it could all be so lean.
The clock cycles spun by so quick in their wake,
three times this hardware you'd think that's what it's take.
{pp}
My friends became so jealous they gritted their teeth,
the smoke from their own boxes circled their heads like a wreath.
When finally they broke down, I could but hold tight my belly,
and laugh till it hurt, my insides like jelly.
{pp}
So far out-classed they broke down and knelt,
some sympathy I had, for their plight I now felt.
A wink of my eye and nod of my head,
in the right direction they now would be lead.
{pp}
I spoke not a word but went straight to my work,
Plenty of systems for all, I'll not be a jerk.
Then laying the cursor on the Order button to click,
We ordered so many systems, Gates we knew it'd make sick.
{pp}
Then we sprang to our feet and gave out with a cheer,
For the likes of Microsoft we'd have no more fear.
But Gates might hear us exclaim 'ere we turned off the light,
We're Amigans returned, and to PCs good night.

Happy Holidays from all of us at AIO!
