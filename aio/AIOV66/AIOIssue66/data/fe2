Just a little update on some of the anti-virus programs availablke out
there fpor those wondering which does what and which ones seem updated
regularily.  Most of them have the full range of file checking, memory
and directory watching, boot sectors, etc..  Watch Dog appears to be
just a memory watcher, and Safe handles memory and file checking.
{pp}
The table below gives the name of several popular viurus checkers,
opposite them the date last updated according to Aminet, although a
few have more frequent updates on their own updates.  Further into for
each of them can be obtained by a search of Aminet for the files, all
of which have readmes which will have any website info that may be
had.

Also a couple of quick tips.  First for in email.  Noneof the Amiga
email programs support inline html, but rather in the form of
exporting it out to a web browser, but just in case a time comes when
some program DOES have such support, TURN IT OFF. HTML in email is
useless, wastes bandwidth (you can turn a simple "hello there" into a
5K file), amnd is great for automatically running external programs
like viruses.  Usually only spammers use html anyway so just trashcan
them.

Also, viruses can hide in some strange places.  I had one that kept
being loaded on bootup then deactivated by my antivirus but no matter
where on my harddrive I searched notuhing could fine it...  It turned
out to be hidden in one of the ".prefs" files in ENVARC:.  A quick
reloading and resaving of one of my prefs files did away with it.  So
never think "oh, it could never be in THIS file".

Well, that's it for now.  If anyone has any tips they wish to share
then just email them in and we'll print them up.
