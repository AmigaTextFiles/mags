A native MorphOS version of Hollywood is now available. This PPC
version is of course much faster than the 68k one, so many effects
can now be displayed in real time at an acceptable speed (on 68k
computers most of the CPU intensive effects were precalculated and
displayed then to make them appear smoothly). It is already very fast
on my Blizzard PPC with 200mhz so it should really fly on a Pegasos
system.
