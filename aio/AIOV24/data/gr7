Since Blob is the highest scoring P.D game ever reviewed in AIO I jumped
at the chance to download the latest version when I saw it in the
Aminet's recent list. When I unpacked the archive and ran Blob I was in
for a shock.
{p} {p}
It was the same!! And it's true. Blob version 1.1 is the same as the
original, but with some extra features which aren't noticeable unless
you read the docs.

This desciption is ripped from the original review...

"...When you eventually get into the game the first level loads which, I
assume, is called "Yikes! Clouds!". All the players Blobs will now fall
down from the sky, a while later when the 4 players huddled around the
keyboard realise what colour they are you can start to play. The idea is
to jump on one of the other Blobs, which in turn are trying to jump on you,
this is why you need quite a few players, when two of you are playing it is
really hard to jump on each other, and once on of the blobs is dead you
can`t go for another one.
{p} {p}
 If you have a few players playing at one time you could get bonus' by
getting 3-in-a-row or a pant dropping 10-in-a-row`s, both acompanied with
there own sounds. However, this is much harder in a team game because when
you jump on your own player you`ve lost your only chance!
{p} {p}
 Another great thing about this game is the sounds, you have to hear them
to get the feel. The music is great too..."

The only new bit I found out was that you can run a program before
playing Blob to define the keys. This is all fine and dandy until you
start to play, because you find some key combinations don't allow you to
run and jump like the joystick does, another perk was that the text
telling you the keys don't change, so if you forget the key
combinations you have to load up the Define Key's program again and
either re-assign them or reset to defaults.
{p} {p}
We are told that if you send the authors £5 you get Wobble mode, and a
new level format for the Blob level grabber which you get when you
register. If you ask me £5 is a bit steep.
{p} {p}
Although the authors admit there hasn't been much change, I am
continually annoyed when the Blob loader comes up and says 'Please
Wait... Making assigns"'. All the authors need to do is put a " after
the Echo command in their script and I'd be happy - but no.
{p} {p}
The original Blob was reviewed in issue 13. In almost a year the authors
could have improved Blob a bit more, and we'd all be happy. I'm still
waiting for a 1 player option...
