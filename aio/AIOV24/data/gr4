Written a year ago by Benoist Jésahel for his girlfriend, his puzzle
bobble clone has only just appeared on the Aminet.
{p} {p}
This clone requires two players, who both use the keyboard. The idea is
to shoot out balls from a thing at the bottom of the screen towards are
group of other balls of different colours. When three or more balls are
together they fall to the bottom of the screen. If there are too many
balls in either players area then they lose.
{p} {p}
The keyboard isn't used in Amiga games, as much as on the P.C. Bobble
Puzzle is a clone based on a P.C. version, the graphics are ripped from
the P.C. version, and the author has added sound, and music, but kept
the rest the same, so that his girlfriend doesn't notice the difference
between the P.C. and Amiga versions.

The game can be pretty competitive, unfortunately, you are limited to
low-res graphics, and you can only have music or sound effects on at one
time.

I found Bobble Puzzle very specilized. If you don't usually enjoy puzzle
games, this won't be your cup of tea.
