A fun little hack for graphics cards owners and those with enough extra
system respources to not mind a little something extra. Basically, it
allows you to change the border pattern around your Wb windows,
specifying a list of patterns to be used for non-active windows, and a
single pattern for the active window. Each time a new window is opened
it's assigned one of the random patters, which will stay with it until
reboot, the single active pattern being used anytime a window is made
active.

That's it. There can be up to twenty random patterns, and are loaded
using datatypes. It's a CLi-only program, though there is a  GUI-based
prefs program available for it, and has a few switches for precision,
floodmasking, and such. It works on public screens, useful for 16-bit
screens or better.

It looks nice but be warned, it is a {bold}hack{nobold}, and a bit unstable. Not
fatally so, and anyone with an 060 and lots of RAM probably won't
notice anything too bothersome, but enough to be cautious about. If you
start noticing any conflicts in your system, then this should be one of
the first hacks you start looking into.

Not an essential utility, but good eye-candy nonetheless.
