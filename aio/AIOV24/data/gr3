This one is a tribute to Bob Dylan. You have to help Bob get through 8
of his best records. Each track on each record is represented by a level
in the game, there are 90 levels altogether. After you have completed a
whole record, you'll be given a code, which means you don't have to play
all those levels again.

On his adventures though the levels, Bob can pick up records. Collecting
99 records gives Bob an extra life. There are other various bonuses, like
shots, to pick up as well.

If you have ever played the 8-bit Nintendo game "Super Mario Bros", you
might find this game quite similar. It is a platformer, and it's very
challenging. I can't get past level 3!!
{p} {p}
There are a lot of different backgrounds, which means you don't get
bored of the same thing over and over again. Each level has lots of Bob
Dylan haters (enemies), bonus', and annoying spikes, water, fire, and
floors which disappear when Bob runs over them.

I enjoy platformers, and this one is good. It is challenging, as I've
said before, but this gives Super Bob Dylan more lastability, because it
makes you addicted.

Sound is good. I can't understand Bob Dylan's voice, but I'm sure what
he says is meaningful. Top marks all round. Game of the month?
