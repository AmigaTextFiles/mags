San Diego - May 21, 1999 - Amiga announces participation at AmiWest99
and World of Amiga 99 shows.

Amiga will be supporting and participating at two major Amiga shows in
July, AmiWest99 in Sacramento, California and World of Amiga 99 in
London, England.  These shows will occur over the same weekend.

"Participating in two shows at the same time will present some
challenges but we are looking forward to simultaneously discussing our
plans for the future with great audiences on two continents," said Jim
Collas.  "We are looking at ways to connect the two events and show that
Amiga users represent a great worldwide community."
{p} {p}
Amiga executives will be at both of the shows, and look forward to
sharing more details about what we have been doing over the past few
months and how we are moving towards the future.

We look forward to seeing as many of you as possible at the shows.
