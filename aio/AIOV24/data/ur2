CutNPaste is an ARexx module for DOpus Magellan 5.66 or newer. It will add
Cut, Copy, Paste, Paste As, Paste into as, View Clipboard and Clear Clipboard
to the lister popup menu. It is like Windoze 95/8's cut'n'paste. It can also
be used in DOpus 5.5, but then you must add some buttons for it, because you
couldn't add stuff to the popup menu in pre 5.66 versions.

It's purpose is quite obvious, to copy files and/or directories in a very
simple way. This will make your DOpus life much nicer! Another big plus
is that it is fully localizied, so it will fit in whatever language you run
your DOpus in!

The installation is very simple, just copy the drawers into DOpus5: and then
it's finished. No need to restart or assign.
