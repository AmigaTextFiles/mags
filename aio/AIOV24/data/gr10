Dieser Zug or to us english speaking, Diesel Train is a WB snake game.
You know the idea and the plot because we have seen many of these
before. A basic rundown is a game where you have to eat dots to grow
in size. The dots will appear at random on the screen having scores
from 1-9. Depending on how much each dot is worth depends on how much
your snake will grow that time.

The game is very very simple with basic graphics but for some reason
has had me addicted since I first played this over 3 years ago. After a
HD crash a while back I lost this game only to find it on the latest
Amiga Format CD. This game is as brilliant now as it was back then and
will keep you playing hour after hour.

Honestly this is one of the best snake games that I have ever played,
couple this with the fact that it runs on your workbench makes it the
perfect game. In the case of small workbench games you'll usually hear
me say that this will be good when you are copying disks or something
else that you need to fill time doing but with Dieser Zug it is a whole
different case. You can be sitting there doing nothing else but playing
this game like mad. A great option is the hi-score table which saves
so gives you a challenge to beat each time you sit down to play this.
While i was testing it for review I kept saying just one more game
until I die to see if I could beat my score but carried on playing
for many more games.

Overall this game is just wonderful, if you havn't got the AFCD this
month and want this game then send me an email at, {bold}chris@aio.co.uk{nobold} and
i'll gladly send you a copy. EXCELLENT!
