This month I'm going to finish up the hardware aspects of our little
dream machine with a quick look at what everything centers about. The
motherboard. It's the single most important aspect of the computer and
should be very carefully considered.
{p} {p}
First off, about this whole chip memory thing. A limit of 2 megs is not
only restrictive, but so is the whole concept of ANY arbitrary limit. No
matter how high you draw the line, next year's apoplications will always
want more. If we must have a division between Chip and Fast Ram, then
why not something a bit more configurable?
{p} {p}
Have a couple of SIMM slots designed to take nearly any configuration
of memory, and the OS to automatically configure itself to what's
stuck in there. Everything else is Autoconfig in the Amiga, why not
Autoconfig Chip Ram?
{p} {p}
Next a minor thing. Never, repeat NEVER, surface mount *anything*,
especially those dreadful CIA chips. It may cound cheap to bening with,
but as all us A4000 owners know, a 400 USD repair bill to replace $5
worth of chips is not pleasant.
{p} {p}
The CPU. Of course give us one with the best speed/MIPS/etc., and as
many instruction pipelines, and as much cache memory, as can be managed,
but why not one small step further. Put one or two extra chip slots on
the board, already to just pop in a couple of extra CPUs if one so
wants. Hardwire in the multi-CPU capability for all those chips in
parallel, ready for just the chips to be inserted. Ship it with the base
single CPU, leaving the option of multiple CPUs open to the user.
Installation would be as simple as popping in a chip, with the OS taking
care of the rest.
{p} {p}
Lastly, the motherboard itself. It's usually quite a piece of time
between motherboards of one design and the next generation, so why not
think ahead to begin with? Forget the 64-bit wide main Bus, go straight
to 128-bit, minimum. It may sound over-kill now, but what will start out
as putting us way ahead of the curve will end up giving us breathing
room as technological need catches up with us. And above all, it'll
reduce that dreaded bottleneckthat reduces so many well-meaning CPU's to
mediocracy.
{p} {p}
Well, that should cover all the hardware aspects. I maybe won't do
anything on the software side, because that's pretty much what Utilities
reviews are for, but you never know. So, until next month, here's
hoping.
