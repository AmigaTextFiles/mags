Review by Lorens Johansson

(Ed- A few months ago in issue 18 I previewed a new racing game, back
then just titled 'race' - A new version of the demo has been released
and is a great improvement, see what Lorens Johansson thought about
the new demo...)
{p} {p}
This is a car racing game, very similar to Test Drive, but the graphics are
awsome. It isn't finished yet, but it is very promising. It's a shame that
it's only one level in the demo.
{p} {p}
When you start Joyride, it will ask if you want Manual or Auto gears, and if
you want to steer with the Joystick or Keyboard. I think the keyboard
keys are mapped very badly...
{p} {p}
You race against five computer cars in this demo and they are quite hard to
beat. You can crash into trees and Amiga Boing Balls signs. :) And when you
have crashed enough, or nearly runout of fuel, you have to get to the
pitstop to repair and get gas.
{p} {p}
It is very fast even on my 030/50, but it doesn't use the whole screen, only
256 pixels wide. According to the author it won't be wider, because it will
be much slower then.
{p} {p}
It is completely system friendly written, but DO NOT run enforcer when
playing Joyride, because it will give you CONSTANT Enforcer HITS, this has
been reported, so it will probably be fixed very soon!
{p} {p}
The sound is quite good, and that enhances the playability alot. But it can
be better!

If you like racing games, then go to {link http://www.nettaxi.com/citizens/milang}http://www.nettaxi.com/citizens/milang{end}
and download it right away. It is about 1.1MB but the server is very fast!
