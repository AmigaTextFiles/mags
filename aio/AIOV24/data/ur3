IBrowse Cache Restore (called ICR from now on) is an utility for making it
much easier to restore pages from the IBrowse Cache onto your harddrive.
{p} {p}
The installation is really simple, just unarchive it and copy it where you
want. It consists of two executables, the main program and a GUI! So all of
you CLI haters, use the GUI, and ofcourse vice versa.
{p} {p}
The GUI is quite nicely layed out, and it is very easy to figure out, you don't
even have to keep the documentation for ICR. All you have to do is the point
where the IBrowse cache dir is and then where to put the files. It is quite
annoying when it will complain about no dest dir set after you set the Cache
dir, but that's details. Then press the ReScan button and voila, here's a
list on all the domains among the cached files. This is both good and bad,
the good thing is that it's very easy to find the correct site in the list,
and the bad thing is that if you want to Restore a site that is on a certain
server then you can't choose which site to restore, it will restore the
whole server that you have in the cache.
{p} {p}
One VERY bad thing it has that I just experienced, if you press the all
button, which I thought was there to mark all the sites, then it will just
start restoring the complete Cache! And it doesn't have an abort button.
Forget about me saying that the documentation was unnecessary, it was in this
case. :(
