Just to proove that we DO listen to your mail out there, based on ONE 
letter written in to the last AIO, I'm starting up this new column for 
revealing some of the finer points to the great Directory Opus. So, if
there are any specific questions you want answered, or if you have some
obscur tips yourself, then by all means write in and I'll see what I can
do.
{p} {p}
As a point of reference, all tips assume use of Magellan II (since
that's the version I currently have), though most of what's said should
work in recent past versions. Well, enough of that, on with the first 
installment.
{p} {p}
This month I'll cover File Types, as in creating your own (another
request, this one from the mailing list). It's been said that the
manual doesn't clearly state how to create your own file type, an
information search which I myself once had to wade through, but it all
comes down to two sinple commands.
{p} {p}
FindFileType and CreateFileType are the two commands here of interest, 
and using them is really very simple. FindFiletypes will sniff through
a file to find what file type it is (a command nearly outdated by the
automatic file type sniffer built into Magellan II). CreateFileType
is used to create a new file type from scratch.
{p} {p}
The best (and probably only) mway to use them is to create a new button
or menu item, and attach one of these as a Command. No arguments are
needed, just "Command   CreateFileType", and no Flags set.
{p} {p}
Using it. Click once on a desired file to highlight it, then hit your
CreateFileType button or menu; the command won't work without a file 
highlighted in the Srce window.
{p} {p}
A window will pop up with all you need for making a new filetype, 
including it's initial best guess at what's needed to recognize that 
file. Name, IFF, Group, ID, and Bytes ae checked as appropriate, with
the first several bytes of the file listed by Bytes, and a cycle gadget 
for case sensitive or not. If what's given seems sufficient, then just
fill in a good name in place of the "Untitled" and hit Save.
{p} {p}
Else, if you desire a more detailed identification, then hit Edit, and 
you'll get the next couple of windows.
{p} {p}
One window is the old familiar one for definng default actions on that
file type for specified events (Double-click, Drag N' Drop, etc.), and 
the additional selections to appear in the Icon Menu for that file type, 
as well as default Icon. That's all pretty standard, but it's the next
window that really matters.
{p} {p}
Here is where you can refine the definitions for recognizing the File 
Type.  You define a file type through a series of commands to Match 
anything from Name, FORM, or bytes, to stuff in the comment field.  Each
command line is connected to the next by a logical AND or OR, and that
IS detailed in the manual.  The window will open with the default
matches that DOpus thought up for the selected file, and you just go
from there, editing those given or adding your own. There's even a View 
File button for allowing you to view a file of the type in question 
while you're trying to deside on what to put in as the matches.
{p} {p}
Just make sure you fill in a Name and ID, and you'll be fine. After
you're finisshed, hit Save at every window and you're done. If you need
help on what types of things you should match for then just edit an
existing file type to view it for ideas.
{p} {p}
Here's an examplre of what might appear in the File Type Edit window 
after you're finished.
{p} {p}
Name: Ascii    ID: Ascii   Pri: -1
{p} {p}
Match DT Group   text{p}
And{p}
Match DT ID      asci
{p} {p}
And that's it. Just make the button, use it on the file you want, and
work your way through the windows the CreateFileType command will
produce.

Next month, some useful add-ons, suggestions from the audience, and who
knows.  We'll see.
