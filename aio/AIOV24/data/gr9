Sharks is a strange little game. You play the role of a diver kitted
out in full diving suit and unlimited air tank so it seems. Your
objective is to collect the gems that lay the bottom of the sea and
return them to your boat which floats at the top of the water. The
game is not as simple as it sounds because while you are in the water
you have to dodge the sharks which swim about around you.

That is really all there is to the game. The graphics are quite nice,
obviously they aren't commercial quality but i've seen much worse. The
sounds are calming like you really are under the sea because occationally
you hear the bubbles that your air mask is letting off.

The main problem I found with the game is it isn't really that hard.
You only get one life which may seem unfair but really that is all you
will need because you rarely get killed. If you happen to touch the
sharks mouth then you will see the shark swim away happily chomping
on your body... game over. It really is quite easy if you take care.
I think that the game would have been much better if the author had
decided to add in some other obsticles like electric eels or other sea
type nasties. As it is the game is far to easy.

Overall the game is pretty good for 5 seconds but after that you'll
get bored because of the little challenge it offers.
