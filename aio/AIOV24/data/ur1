Blizkick is a great tool to rekick any KickStart ROM that you want to use.
It was first intended only for Blizzard boards (might be that the name is
applying to :) ). But now it can also rekick Cyberstorm cards (not all).

The only stuff that is needed for BlizKick is a Blizzard/Cyberstorm
turboboard, 512 kB free fast RAM and ofcourse a ROM image. (The Blizzard
boards must have the MAPROM feature (jumper).

No need to live with the bugs in 3.0 anymore, just ask a friend to write
his 3.1 ROM to a Image file and then use that. This isn't legal, so you must
own the 3.1 ROM too. So you can look at it that you own the 3.1 ROM but you
are to lazy to put it in :)

There is a downside to this though, every time you coldboot the computer, ie
turn it on after being turned off for a while, then BlizKick will rekick
the ROM Image into Fast Ram and then reboot, so you will loose maybe three
seconds on loading speed.
