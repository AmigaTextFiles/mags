Session Start: Wed May 05 20:04:25 1999
{p} {p}
*** havemose (xxxx@xxxx) has joined #amigadk
{p} {p}
<MSkov> Hi Allan... I'm Morten... We are doing this in English like we
agreed, right?
{p} {p}
*** Trez sets mode: +v havemose
{p} {p}
*** UltimateW sets mode: +m
{p} {p}
<havemose> I've promised the US people to do this in english. I don't
mind danish :), but I should keep my promise.
{p} {p}
<MSkov> If Allan is ready and Trez and UW are set, I believe we
should start
{p} {p}
<MSkov> Trez and UW, you're in control
{p} {p}
<havemose> I'm ready :)
{p} {p}
<Trez> MSkov: would you like to begin with a question ?
{p} {p}
<MSkov> allan: you wrote in your last email that you were very busy,
could you tell us a bit about what you're doing lately?
{p} {p}
<Trez> MSkov: remember GA
{p} {p}
<MSkov> GA :)
{p} {p}
*** Trez changes topic to 'Konference med Dr. A. Havemose. UltimateW
tager mod spørgsmål. GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> We are busy designing and implementing the new Amiga
operating environment. Note that, since QNX is providng the
underlying operating system, we ar concentrating on higher level
pieces. GA
{p} {p}
<MSkov> How many people have been hired yet? GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> At this point we're about 20 people in the company. We're
hiring lot's of engineers. Just check our web site to get an idea of
how many people we're hiring.
{p} {p}
<havemose> GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> BIGF^q7e asks; What is the plans for OS3.6 and 3.7 ? what
will be the news ?  ( GA )
{p} {p}
<havemose> I truly don't know much about 3.6 and 3.7. I've spent all
my time on the new stuff. I would think that we need to ship 3.5
first, and then see, but that's all speculation; since I'm not
involved. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Draco^ asks: As QNX is a realtime OS, will higher level
pieces respect this? GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> yes. the new Amiga will be realtime. There a limits on how
much realtime processing you can do, but that aside, we're realtime.
GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> kingsmurf asks: Will AmigaOS5 have Arexx?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> scripting language has not been decided yet. Arexx has
lots of implementation issues (I've seen the source:), so there is
more to it than you would expect. I think the real question is
powerful scripting, not necessarily AREXX. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> kingsmurf asks: What about multiuser support, will this
be implemented in AmigaOS5? GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> we can handle multiple users requesting services. There
are still a few open issues on if we want to support multiple logins
at the same time (via terminals). GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> kingsmurf asks: Will AmigaOS5 have shared
libraries/devices? GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> we'll have shared libraries and resouces, just like the
old amiga. The layout will be different. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Delta^dk asks: will QNX/os5 be multiplatform ? GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> yes
{p} {p}
<havemose> GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Delta^dk asks: we are talking os5 only ? nothing about
3.5 ? GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> I'm not involved in 3.5 at all. I helped identify H&P for
the development, but do not have an active role in the project. There
is more than enough to  do on OS5, so I haven't spent any time on 3.5
GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Yock asks:  will there be support for DVD in OS3.5 / 5?
GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> OS3.5 I don't know. OS5 that's the plan. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Brunis asks: Has any Hardware decisions been made or will
the QNX core run on anything? GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> hardware is not important at this stage. We're developing
to a general hardware independent configurations. QNX currently runs
on a number of processors (x86,ppc,mips and others). GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Trez asks:  back when Amiga were speaking about possible
specs for the cpu of the NG Amiga 80x86 emulation was mentioned. Is
that still something you're counting on and would it work well for
e.g. emulation? (i.e. be able to switch between instruction sets
while the machine is running)  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> I'm not sure I recall that discussion: our initial
development system is x86 based, because we have access to good x86
systems from gateway. We were talking emulation of the ClassicAmiga
thought UAE and AmigaPCI (InsideOut card). GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> PsychoLns asks: what about Java, how much will it be
integrated in the OS? (running java applications like std.
executeables etc.)  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> java has certain limitations: Java is really a "single
application execution environment". We're planning on using Java in a
number of places. I can't be more specific at this point. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Trez asks:  Do you still plan to make a system and apps
directory structure and put all that goes with an app in it's own
directory? and wouldn't it waste a lot of diskspace eventually as
libraries etc. used by single programs might be used several times?
GA
{p} {p}
<Trez> ...just a note: the so-called MMC was supposedly able to
emulate other cpu's instruction sets.
{p} {p}
<havemose> All unique pieces that an application requires goes in the
applications directory. All system wide resources and libraries goes
in the OS directory. I see little waste. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Pede^FUP asks:  Message: Hi Dr. Havemose, I met you at
the Cologne show last year, just wanted to tell you that it was real
cool :) Question: Is the Amiga company involved in developing
hardware?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> We're more focused on software than hareware. We work with
third paties as much as possible to get hardware/silicion developved.
GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Laursen asks:  Generally speaking, are you adopting a
majority of the existing AmigaOS features/ideas/philosophy?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> I'd say as far as philosophy almost 100%: by that I mean
simplicity, elegance and power of the implementations. A lot of the
individual technology pieces are outdated, even though few are
willing to accept that. W'e'll use as much new technology as
possible. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Laursen asks:  Will hardware be important at SOME point
(i.e. will we see custom chips or such) or are you going software
only (like Be)?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> We'll be somewhere in between. The Be model is not good,
in my oppinion: they are not offering any compelling reason to
develop for their OS. Our vision is significantly broader than just
being an OS; we believe that this is important. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Snuden asks:  Can you tell us more about the filesystem
structure ie. will we get c and s etc.? GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Snuden asks:  Can you tell us more about the directory
structure in OS5 ?  GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> (sort of them same Q) GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> I haven't decided on names yet. Personally, it doesn't
make a big difference to me what things are called, ie wheter is C or
bin for instance. GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> continuting ...
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> NoH asks:  What about emulation of kickstart 3.x?  UAE
only supports 1.3 afaik.  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> I am looking at /Amiga being the root directory for the OS
and /Applications for applications. Each then breaks down in the
components it provides or applications installed. GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> UAE is limited, your right. We're looking at what it would
take to support 3.x and AA. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Noh asks:  Have you looked at Opus5 for inspiration?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> I know Greg Perry from way back. Opus5 is nice for a power
user. I would prefer something simpler for consumers. ..more ..
{p} {p}
<havemose> ONe of my key ground rules is that there should only be
one way to accomplish something in a consumer environment. Opus 5
offers many ways of setting the same attributes - for most people
this is confusing  ... more
{p} {p}
<havemose> Develper environments are different, and I understand
that; here Opus5 or similar would be OK> GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> olef asks:  Back in the Cologne show you told us that in
a short while you would be able to say more about the new development
environment. How about now? ;-)  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> We got delayed a bit by Gateway, as Jim Collas has
explained. Unfortunately, that means that there are not many details
that I can give. ... more
{p} {p}
<havemose> we will have a programming model in C++ with good tools.
Java, as mentioned, is also an options, even though java apps are
more restrictive. GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> let me clarify ...
{p} {p}
<havemose> I actually used the wrong tense. We HAVE a programming
model in C++ ... Just want to avoid misunderstandings. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> olef asks:  Can you give us some concrete examples on
what the future AmigaOS will run on? I mean, apart from "normal"
computers.  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> We have talked about information appliances at various US
shows. Think of them a next generation computing devices: handheld
units, set top boxes, web surfing units etc. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Draco^ asks:  do you have any plans on how to get new
companies to develop for the new Amiga? as most users expect eg. Word
compatibility, how are you going to solve this? GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> We're already working with a number of larger software
companies. I can't announce details, but if you look at Jim Von
Holle's CV on our web site, you'll see that he was in charge of SW
for Gateway. :) GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Trez asks:  When was the last time you used an amiga? :)
GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> Probably a few weeks ago. GA <UltimateW> Trez asks:  You
stated that you are probably going to remove the case sensitivity of
the QNX filesystem. Wouldn't it be possible to implement it so that
users could have it either way? after all some prefer one thing and
others prefer another. And what kind of shell will OS5 have? Anything
BASH-ish?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> on case sensitivity: most developers want case
sensitivity, most users don't. We'll have to think about the
customer. You're environment will support the standard case sensitive
FS if you like. I belive that we offer both sh (bash ) and tcsh/csh.
GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Delta^dk asks:   is the public availble to help in any
way (could i help fx) ?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> Actually yes :) We'll be announcing our developers program
soon. But more importantly, I would like to ask everyone to help
control the rumers on the net. ... more
{p} {p}
<havemose> there are many people who have very little interest in
seing Amiga succeed (such as our competition). If we all make sure
that all the unsubstantiated rumors
{p} {p}
<havemose> doesn't gain mindshare, it will make a huge difference. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> kingsmurf asks:  Can you tell us what the next Amiga will
be like? Is the next Amiga an advanced settop box? Or perhaps a
successor to the A500? or is it a real computer that can compete with
modern PC's?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> We haven't decided on form factor yet. But since we are
building a family of products, I would expect that we'll have designs
of various types (A500 style, PC-style, etc.) Those decision are
still to be made. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Laursen asks:  What's your vision, if broader than Be's?
:)  / I've been running BeOS for more than one year by now and it
still feels like a baby compared to AmigaOS 3.1. Be have developed
BeOS for >5 years by now. Can we really expect to see something that
will really rock in the next couple of years? GA
{p} {p}
* UltimateW Please no more questions at this point..... :o) thanks.
{p} {p}
*** Trez changes topic to 'Konference med Dr. A. Havemose. Stil
venligst ikke flere spsm. 39 users - rekord'
{p} {p}
<havemose> I'd say so. The BeOS in many ways has an architecture like
what we were considering for a next generation Amiga,when I was as
Commodore/Amiga. They have, however, focused all their energy on a
particular market segmet. That just does not have enough appeal.
Looks great, though :) GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> nim^unq asks:  Will OS3.5/5 have built-in support for USB
or even FireWire ?   GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> OS5: USB yes, firewire TBD. FireWire has lost momentum in
the PC industry. We'll have to wait and see. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Noh asks:  How about icons?  Will it have something
similar to DefIcons?  Hopefully not the MS-icon way...  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> No MS icons :) We're working with graphic artists to get a
new and better look of the desktop/user-experience.
{p} {p}
<havemose> I need a 2 min break ...
{p} {p}
* Trez will be a pause fisk then ;)
{p} {p}
<havemose> back :)
{p} {p}
<Trez> *blop*
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Delta^dk asks:  what about rebol ?  GA
{p} {p}
<Trez> havemose: GA :)
{p} {p}
<havemose> I have about another 10-15 minutes
{p} {p}
<havemose> Carl has already committed to providing Rebol on the new
Amiga.
{p} {p}
<havemose> GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> noh asks  When you mention bash/sh, it sounds like a unix
clone. What'll it be? GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> :) Not a unix clone. The question was about shell
functionality. I just like the functionality of Csh better than bash.
The old Shell borrowed from both sh/csh, but didn't provide adequate
scripting. I want to change that :) GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> UHolst asks:  To be a viable platform it need software.
Can we expect decent basic applications like browser, news reader,
word processor, spreadsheet etc. when OS5 is released? Are you
working with third parties to accomplish this?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> I answered that above. We are working with 3rd party sw
vendors. I cannot give any details at this time. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> UHolst asks:  We all like our Amigas because of the
famous "Amiga feel" whatever that is. Will OS5 still feel like an
Amiga our will it be just another power OS although based on AmigaOS?
GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> Some of the devices will probably feel more like an amiga
than others, just based on their capabilities. We are working very
hard to have a consistient look&feel across the entire product line.
GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> UHolst asks:  Many have voiced their concerns that you
with OS5 are more interested in the consumer market with powerful
Internet boxes rather than high-end Amigas like the A4000. Will we
see OS5 based high-end computers for the power user?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> We are focused on a subset of products initially. Remember
that it takes a lot of engineering to bring out entire product lines.
How the products are being rolled up is really outside my control. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> UltimateW asks:  Do we need to fear a MS Windows look a
like in AmigaOS5 ?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> NO :) GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> benn asks:  Will the AmigaOS3.5/5 have any kind of memory
protection?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> Yes, fully protected. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Yock asks:  Why AmigaNG, why not just the old Amiga ad we
know it?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> clarification: OS 5 is fully protected. ga
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Trez asks:  Will there be draggable screens in OS5 if the
hardware in the used device allows it? And have you spoken to gfx
card manufacturers like NVIDIA or other leading forces?  GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> (wups...)
{p} {p}
<Trez> :)
{p} {p}
<havemose> it is very difficult to add protection to the old Amiga.
I've discussed this in detail with Carl. We both agree that adding
protection to exec would amount to rewriting exec. -- i'll answer the
next question
{p} {p}
<havemose> I can't comment on who we;re talking to, but the model
allows screens if the hardware is capable of it. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Trez asks:  will you make sure that there are integrated
developer systems right from the launch of OS5? Possibly even
including one?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> developers tools will be ready when we launch the
developers program. They will not be included with a standard system.
GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Laursen asks:  bash and tcsh are great. But how about an
AmigaShell?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> Amigashell is really a subset of bash/tcsh as far as
functionality is concerned. I'll try to answer again then: I want the
functionality of sh/csh. Whether we base our new shell on AmigaShell
or one of the unix ones is largely irrelevant, as long as we get an
easy to use and stable shell. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> BIGF^q7e asks:  Have you talked with any game companies ?
i mean, when launching a new computer, many good games are needed
else people will not buy the cumputer.  / is there actully any
companies who actully knows about your AmigaNG project ?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> I can't talk about who we're doing business with. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> MSkov asks:  How do you see Amiga's first priorities
match the community's? Many user want regular computers at first, but
this may not be your wish. GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> My personal oppinion: We'll make sure that the community
get's the products they want. The community today, however, are
mostly powerusers, and do not represent the "old" community that
well. We'll do products for both. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> NoH asks:  How much is Carl Sassy involved in OS5?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> Carl and I talk from time to time. I can't really disclose
the exact relationship between him and us. That would be
inappropriate. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> xpoint asks:  will there be real virtuel memory support
in os3.5 and os5 ?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> OS3.5: don't know, but suspect no. OS5: yes. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> BIGF^q7e asks:  Will os5 detect file types based on the
file extension ? i hope not!  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> Right answer. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Trez asks:  Will you bring the Guru meditation back ? B)
GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> No guru meditations in consumer products. Developer
release are different :) GA
{p} {p}
<Trez> :)
{p} {p}
<havemose> I have 5 more minutes. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Trez asks:  will you put "powered by amiga" on every
product that is amiga based? I don't know how cool it would be to say
"I have an amiga" "oh.... my dishwasher is an amiga too"..  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> We want the "powered by Amiga" to become pervasive. GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Trez again.. :  Will you be making official "We Told You
So! - Amiga Is Back" t-shirts when OS5 is out? =)  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> :) good idea. We'll see. We'll find a way to celebrate .GA
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> NoH asks:  gurus as similar to the MS 'blue screen'?  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> I actually believe that you can make devices that recover
from faults. That's what I meant. We;ll have to have some last resort
"I'm dead" indicator, but hopefully something more meaningfull than
the blue screen of death in NT
{p} {p}
<havemose> GA
{p} {p}
<Trez> GURU GURU! ;)
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Last question for today:  When will you be back in
Denmark ? (official)  GA
{p} {p}
<havemose> OK. Slut for I dag. Mange tak for de gode spoergsmaal.
{p} {p}
<Trez> And more importantly: Will you be back here?
{p} {p}
<Trez> :)
{p} {p}
<UltimateW> Thank you very much for your time, its been great :o)))
{p} {p}
<havemose> Jeg kommer til DK om et par uger. GA
{p} {p}
<Trez> havemose: tak for de gode svar
