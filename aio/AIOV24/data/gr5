In issue 22 Lee Hesselden our Games Editor reviewed Snake Wars and at that
time I had not played it. Since then I gave the game a go and found it
was totally pathetic and decided to write another review to show you
how rubbish I think it is. Lee must have been feeling rather generous
giving it 44%, i have deducted 10% and awarded it 33%, read on...

SnakeWars is a game which gives you a false sense of its game genre. I
gathered from the title that it would be another Snake game, this is
probably me but obviously I was mistaken. It is not a snake game at all,
well it does throw snakes somewhere into the game but thats really all
is has to do with the game.

The idea behind Snakewars is to go from the bottom of the scrolling
map the the top dodging the "things" as the author puts it in the
documents. You control an ambulance which through-out the game changes
to quoting the author "ordinary ambulance, tank ,speed boat, helicopter,
jet and space shuttle"
{p} {p}
Your plot is to drive some snakes which are injured in a war accourding
to the storyline and get them to the hospital aswell as dodging "things"
on your way.

The graphics in some places are quite nice and seem to been well drawn
but I really didn't like this game for many reasons. Firstly the game
is riddled with bugs. You get "things" that stick to your ambulance and
don't move away. The collision detection is awful, you have to leave
a gap of about 2mm away from the actual "thing" picture otherwise any
closer and you'll blow. The gameplay is also terrible because all you
do is move the joystick left and right, thats it. Lastability doesn't
even come into it because the game is boring and won't last you 5
seconds. The author claims that there is no music because he couldn't
find any good music and then goes onto say he also didn't include any
because "I couldn`t be bothered to change the code as the game was
badly p****ng me off". In otherwords the author does either not know
what he is doing or couldn't be bothered, either way is a disgrace and
if he will take this attitude then he should stop producing games right
now.

The documents are terrible. Swear words riddle it because the author
thinks he looks good doing it and secondly the lines are all over the
place making it unreadable.
{p} {p}
Overall this game is complete and utter rubbish, avoid at all costs
and give the author a good kick up the arse. My tip is to get out some
old toy cars, throw peas all over the floor and you have your own
game of SnakeWars.

I am really quite annoyed with this game and with the author. Please
let me excuse myself for writing a review like this but I absolutly
hated this game and can't understand the authors way of thinking.
