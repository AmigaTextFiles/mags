Major Development Programs:{p}
1) O/S 3.5 - This product is being developed by Haage & Partner under contract from Amiga. The target release date is late July or early August. We are talking to Amiga hardware development companies to qualify hardware products targeted at the O/S 3.5 release.

2) AmigaSoftTM Operating Environment (OE) - We are developing our next generation operating environment including operating system, user interface, and some revolutionary software structures to be disclosed at a later date. Target beta version is 3Q99 with final in late 4Q99. We are also looking at the possibility of porting this new AmigaSoftTM OE to the O/S 3.5 recommended hardware configurations. If we can accomplish this it will allow people to run the new OE on specific Amiga configurations with PowerPC boards.{p}
