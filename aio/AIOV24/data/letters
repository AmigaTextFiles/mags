I've only been reading AIO since about October 1998 & found it very useful
for information, it was more upto date than Amiga Format (& still is!). I
wasn't on the 'net at the time so it was very useful. But just lately, AIO
seems to have gone from strength to strength. The new GUI is excellent, much
better than using a browser & the content has improved. Some of the
interviews have been very interesting. Oh & Chris even included a mod of mine
in one issue, so I have to say AIO is excellent ;-) Keep up the good work &
Happy Birthday AIO!!!

Hello, dear member of the Amiga Community!
{p} {p}
I've made probably the first Amiga font with the new Euro currency
sign incorporated instead of the "general" currency sign.
{p} {p}
FlodisEuro is available for downloading from the Internet address
{link http://come.to/be.euro-compatible}http://come.to/be.euro-compatible{end}
The font is SMS-ware -- go to {link http://www.mtnsms.com}http://www.mtnsms.com{end} and send
a mobile phone message to me (+46709933940)!
{p} {p}
Thanks for your time!

Dear Mr Seward and co.
{p} {p}
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you and the rest
of the AIO team for producing a most magnificent Amiga guide magazine,
which never fails to amuse me every month.
{p} {p}
My `A.I.O Crap Award' that Lee Hesselden gave to me for the `Footy Game'
is currently on my mantel piece and I intend to treasure it forever :) 
{p} {p}
Keep up the great work and sense of humor, and I look forward to reading
more future AIO issues from you.
{p} {p}
Best regards
Matt Briggs
