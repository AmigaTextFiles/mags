Another Software is about to come:{p}
VT will release an OPL3 based plugin Program for Concierto to make
use of the yamaha soundchip that is implemented on the card. You will
be able to control the settings made with the program via a CAMD based
application then.

FMSX was released some days ago that makes use of the special OPL3
features of Concierto for sound emulation. One of the special music
chips that was included in MSX systems are emulated nearly perfectly
with it... Take a look in there too if you own a Concierto.
