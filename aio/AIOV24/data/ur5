If you're like me, you like to make your amiga seem as alive as
possible, personalizing every possible aspect. For me this includes
system sounds, different sounds to be played for any of a number of
events or actions. Unfortunately the last program to give any decent
sort of such support was DeskTop Magic (known in Europe as Maxxon), but
that one meant putting up with the blanker that came with it and paying
the commercial fee that went with it.
{p} {p}
Enter IFX, the best event-sound program around anywhere. The Prefs
editor gives all the different IDs to which sound events can be
assigned, a list which includes windows and screens opening and closing,
half a dozen different types of requesters, disks inserted and removed
from the floppy drive, the system beep, window resizing, and even chimes
for the hour, helf hour, and quarter hour. every time one of those
system events comes up, IFX plays the corresponding sound file you have
it set for.
{p} {p}
But you aren't just stuck with one sound per ID. any number of different
sound files can be listed for each ID, and set to either play one from
this list at random each time that event comes up, or all of them in
sequence. Sound files can be IFF and any datatype-supported sound.
{p} {p}
You can create your own IDs, corresponding to different programs or
tasks, that when launched, will trugger the event. There's even task
Exclusions, so you can list tye types of tasks for which no event will
be triggered; especially useful for screen-blankers.
{p} {p}
Sound events can take any number of different forms, including
pre-loaded sounds, played from disk, speech, messages, or quiting or
restarting IFX itself. You can also loop the play of sound files for a
specified number of times. It's even nice enough to set the priority of
it's own sound playing to the lowest possible, meaning it won't
interfere with other sound of MOD players that might go off at the same
time.
{p} {p}
The only problem is with with the user-defined events and the cli-open
ID. No matter what I do, I just can't get it to play the sound file I
assign to a specified program task (say, when DiskSalv starts up it's
supposed to play Mighty Mouse intoning "Here I come, to save the day!"),
and the cli-open ID always seems to get over-ridden by the open-window.
Maybe it's a matter of priority, something maybe the author can fix.
{p} {p}
I don't know if the author is supporting it anymore, seeing as how his
web site has taken a kind of basic turn for several months now, but even
without another update it's still the best darn event-sound program out
there by far. I consider it one of my basic pieces of window-dressing
for my system, maybe you should try it out as well.
