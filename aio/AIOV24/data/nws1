{p} {p}

It's my pleasure to announce that an update of the audio harddisk
recording program PlayHD is available now on my homepage
({link http://www.wentzler.limit.nl}http://www.wentzler.limit.nl{end}). The name has changed now from PlayHD
to 'Audio Evolution' and besides this change, a whole lot of
new features have been added since my last demo from January.

For the people who have never heard of PlayHD or Audio Evolution:
{p} {p}
Audio Evolution is an audio harddisk recording system primarily aimed at
musicians who want an easy-to-use multitrack recorder for home-studio
applications. It's based on the AHI system by Martin Blom, which makes
it possible to run Audio Evolution on every modern soundcard designed for
Amiga computers. Because of the efficient mixing routines of AHI, it's
possible to play up to 30 tracks at the same time on expanded systems,
even without PowerPC technology. But that's not what makes it a good
harddisk recording system: Audio Evolution also offers a versatile mixing
desk including individual channel and master level display, mute, solo,
panning, subgroups and realtime effects. Besides that, full mixer automation
gives you mixing possibilities only limited by your imagination. Also take a
look at the timeline display with its marker system for fast positioning in
the song, locators and punch in/out features which saves you precious
time in your recording session.
