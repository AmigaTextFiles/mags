The title of the game is basically just 'Game' this does not give you any
idea to what it is so let me explain. A few years back LCD games where all
the rage, if you weren't brought up in this time period then you will
not remember them. The basic idea to an LCD game was a simple game with
cheesy music all packaged together in a cheapy plastic case and shifted
from the likes of Argos and Index along with many other of these types
of shops for a couple of english pounds.

Although the game was simple and the graphics did not win any awards
for quality they had a certain addiction to them that kept you going
back for more. The years when a single £5 battery could power your
£3 game for a lifetime.

Nowadays this has all changed and you have your flashy playstations and
color gameboys that require hugh amounts of power or in the color
gameboys case about 20 batteries before you can even switch it on.

These new hi-tech consoles and expensive handhelds may be all the rage
these days but for us gaming oldies we like to hark back to the good
old days and relive those early years when graphics and sound didn't
matter. This is where 'game' steps in.

'Game' is a scanned in picture of one of these old LCD games with all
original graphics and sound, the sound is great, well not great, I
mean great by the fact that it is just as annoying now as it was back
then and really has that feel of the LCD game age. The graphics are
just like the real thing and this game has the feel and look of one
of those classics.

LCD games came in all types from Racers to what was then a great
game of Mario 1. This LCD game is a version of invaders where the idea
is to stop these aliens from landing so you have to make them
crash into your ship. You can have bonuses when a special ship appears
at the corner and if you key over quick enough you pick up bonus
points for shooting it. The game is a simple dodge left and right
using the keys to make the enemies crash into you. The game gets faster
as the more crashed ships you clock up on the counter. You have three
lives which will go down if you miss a ship and let it through.

Overall this is a great game and one that brings back many memories.
If you liked LCD games the first time and where around in that period
the chances that you'll like this are high. I'm off to dig up that
old copy of Racer, now where is it...
