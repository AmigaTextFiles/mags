This is a actually a very good picture viewer made especially for AGA
AMIGAS, so all you lucky people that owns a GFX card probably doesn't have
to bother getting it.

I came to compare this one to one of my favourite picture viewer, namely
Visage (also available on Aminet).
In comparison between these two viewers I came to this conclusion:
sJFIF is faster than Visage is.
{p} {p}
Test results:{p}
Visage: 3.30s 6.61s 7.15s (Options: filename.jpeg){p}
sJFIF : 1.86s 4.10s 4.90s (Options: fdtc hq sm=pal filename.jpeg)
{p} {p}
It does however not weigh up the multi-format ability that Visage has. But
if you have DOpus 5.8 (or something), like I have, then you will just config
a FileType for JPEGs to use sJFIF
{p} {p}
And it seems sJFIF doesn't work too good on some JPEGs, so a few times
during my extensive testing I had to kill it using Xopa (also available on
Aminet ;) )... But, it might have been any of the millions of hacks I'm using
that doesn't like sJFIF.

The manual isn't much to put in the tree, it takes up the most essential,
which is all you need for a picture viewer, it comes with an easy to
follow example as well as descriptions of all options, which also is good,
since then I don't have to launch a Shell to look at the options myself ;)
{p} {p}
Russian AMIGA users should be pleased to hear that it also comes with a
manual in Russian :)
{p} {p}
In overall this is a very good competitor for Visage (and perhaps also for
other GFX showing utilities which I'm not aware of) - and I guess most
people would prefer this one since it is a little bit faster.
