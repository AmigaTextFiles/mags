PowerStation for ImageFX now Shipping
{p} {p}
Nova Design, Inc., producers of the award winning and best selling
ImageFX package are proud to announce that PowerStation, volume one, the
first package of PowerPC modules for ImageFX is now shipping.
{p} {p}
PowerStation is a package of ImageFX modules designed to work directly
with the PowerPC as a coprocessor. This speeds up the specific modules
up to ten times the speed of the same module running on a native 68060
processor. In many cases the effects become nearly real-time!
{p} {p}
PowerStation premiered to record crowds at the Amiga '99 show in St.
Louis and became the 'must-have' item of the show with preorders greatly
exceeding expectations!

PowerStation Specifics
{p} {p}
The PowerPC effects are for use with ImageFX 3.2 or higher only. This
first volume of modules includes the following effects, which have all
received the PowerPC treatment. The first five modules were originally
announced and premiered at the show - by release we have now added three
more!
{p} {p}
Bubble - creates multiple bubbles over your selected image. You can
control the animation and optional color of the bubbles easily. Create
an undersea effect or psychedelic champagne bubbles!
{p} {p}
Fire - one of ImageFX's most popular effects. Fire can create flickering
candle flames, gas-stove flames, raging forest fires and more. All
parameters can be animated or controlled through a single slider.
{p} {p}
Clouds - recently added to ImageFX, the Clouds effect can create amazing
multi-layered fractal clouds. It can also be used to create fog or smoke
over images, simulated explosions, or even seamless textures of
landscapes with cloud patterns animating across them.
{p} {p}
Liquid - this is an endlessly fascinating effect that distorts your
image as if it were on water. You can create funhouse mirror distortions
or unique video transitions with this effect.
{p} {p}
FXForge - based on the same formulas used in Adobe Photoshop's Filter
Factory package, FXForge can create an infinite number of custom
special effects using mathematical formulas. Color effects, distorting
effects, lighting effects are all possible with this amazing engine. It
remains fully compatible with the thousands of effects available on the
Internet for Adobe's Filter Factory.
{p} {p}
Gaussian Blur - the cornerstone of many image processing tricks and
depth of field effects for videographers, this PowerPC version of
Gaussian Blur will now allow incredibly fast optical blurring.
{p} {p}
JPEG Loader/Save - one of the most popular graphics formats to ever come
along, JPEG images are often a fraction of the original image's size,
and are used commonly on the Internet. In the past this size savings was
at the cost of slow loading and saving times. Now these versions load
and save so fast you may have saved in the time it took you to click
your mouse!
