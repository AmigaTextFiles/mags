sites with current Amiga news, even more links to Amiga-specific
programing, developers, retailers, user groups, and related. There are
also pages with info on such topics as the AmigaNG, Digital Convergence,
AmigaOS (past, present, future, alternate), alternate Amigas (PowerPC,
alpha, Siamese). Something for nearly any need.

With May we have the arrival of the most anticipated movie in film
history, so it's only right that this month's Pick should be a site
devoted to it. I talk, of course, of the new Star Wars prequel, and I've
found a site with enough stuff on it to keep you busy for all those
long hours standing in line.
{p} {p}
Where to start. If there's a piece of Prequel info you crave, it's here.
From current news and false rumors, to a list of every television show
that ever had a segment of the new film on it. Information of the
characters includes descriptions, pics, and backgrounds, for dozens of
characters. A small fleet of ships and vehicles are described, with the
ocasional accompanying sketch. Information on the cast and crew, even to
the snail-mail addresses of the entire crew.
{p} {p}
The usual barrage of downloadable stuff is here, including Wav files
(want to hear Darth Maul speak?), pics, video, including the two
trailers. There's a humor section, with a little spoof video, images,
comic strips, and funny posters.
{p} {p}
News, for movies new and old, covers books, games, comics, and
conventions. There's fan art for all the movies, articles and features,
and even a sub-site or two. Throw in the usual links, and an interface
on one of it's sub-sites that's artwork in itself, and there's almost
too much stuff here.
{p} {p}
So, bring your laptops to the movie line and check out this site as you
wait for your tickets. But don't forget to put that computer away as
you walk into the theater, because even this great site is no reason to
miss out on even one second of the movie that I'm sure will sink
Titanic.
