I just read the Article 7 "The work of satan" and almost gave up half way
down. I think there needs to be a reality check on what is obviously a one
eyed view towards PC's.
{p} {p}
1. What's the name of the computer have to do with anything?{p}
2. I'd agree with this point.{p}
3. Windows 95 uses long filenames + DOS 7. It has been around with 3+ years.{p}
4. Windows 95 lets you store 1.76 Meg on floppy disks. And most Amigans only{p}
have 880K anyway. Amiga HD drives are expensive. How often do people still use{p}
floppy disks? (Editor's Note: Disk Spare let's you have up to 1.98 Megs per floppy){p}
5. PC's usually have sound on the motherboard anyway, 16bit. If not, a PC{p}
sound card at 16bits costs $30 Australian. You can not even buy a PC these{p}
days that comes without sound.{p}
6. I'd agree with this point.{p}
7. And certainly this point.{p}
8. I'd agree with this point too... sort of.{p}
9. Of course there is. Heard of Netscape?{p}
10. Lots of PC motherboards have video on them. 24bit is the absolute standard{p}
minimum that you'll get with a new PC these days anyway. PC graphics cards are{p}
1/4 of the price of Amigas. Workbench can not use HAM8, and HAM8 is completely{p}
slow and useless for anything, other than still pictures to look at.{p}
11. Big deal?{p}
12. Of course it is, accessory hardware are made to industry standards. Are{p}
Amigas?{p}
13. I'd agree with that :){p}
14. I'd agree with that, however serious PC software has about 20x more{p}
features than Amigas.{p}
15. well... maybe.{p}
16. Sure... with a very inexpensive TV card. The money you save on PC hardware{p}
will let you buy such things.{p}
17. Paintbrush comes with Windows, what do you expect. DPaint has to BOUGHT.{p}
18. Compare an Amiga and a PC with similar hardware specifications. I think{p}
you'll find the Amiga is grossly overpriced. That argument has been dead for{p}
years.{p}
19. Yes it does, with DOSKEY. It takes 2 minutes to insert it into{p}
AUTOEXEC.BAT{p}
20. That's true, but you won't be doing anything too useful on a stock A1200{p}
anyway. I get your point though.{p}
21. Yes you do, and better.{p}
22. No you don't, Windows has a screen saver interface and there's hundreds of{p}
outstanding ones over the net for free.{p}
23. huh? (Who cares maybe){p}
24. Good for you.{p}
25. I'm sure there is.{p}
26. Yes and no, they're built into Windows so who cares? You'll always be able{p}
to use the mouse.{p}
27. Emulation of an Amiga on a PC, is about the same as emulating a PC on an{p}
Amiga. Due to the PC's insanely fast CPU's. PC emulation on Amiga is very{p}
slow, tried running Windows 95 under PC-Task/PCx?{p}
28. Can you with an Amiga graphics card? Dragging is nice however, but{p}
something I can live without when I'm working on rediculously fast snappy{p}
32bit colour screens.{p}
29. I'd agree with that, Windows is pathetically memory hungry. How much is{p}
memory these days? Bugger all?{p}
30. I'm sure I could quite easily, I just can't be bothered.{p}
{p} {p}
Please wait for the new range of Amiga OS and Hardware specifications, before
trying to bother competing with PC hardware. Classic Amiga hardware can not
and will not surpass.

I am a huge Amiga fan, and do not own and never has owned a PC.
Amiga: A1200/060/16M Fast. 428 M HDD, 24x CDROM, 1942 Multisync Monitor, 33.6K
Modem.
Operating Systems installed: AmigaOS 3.1, OpenBSD UNIX 2.1, MacOS 7.5.5.
