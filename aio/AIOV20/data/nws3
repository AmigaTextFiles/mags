Amiga of Minnesota Interest Groups Alliance (A.M.I.G.A.)

Is happy to announce that the CDTV upgrade project has reach the release
stage of development. The preliminary tests have shown that with the new
prom chips installed the CDTV will operate correctly under OS 3.1 and the
built in CD drive will function correctly. The upgrade requires that the ROM
chip for OS 3.1 be installed, and the two internal proms that govern CDTV be
changed.
{p} {p}
The 3.1 Rom is the same chip that fits the 500 or 2000. The two proms for
the CDTV are only available from A.M.I.G.A. by a license agreement with
Amiga Intl.
{p} {p}
There will be further testing, but so far it has been determined that the
CDTV will boot from a 880 floppy drive containing the workbench 3.1 disk,
and operate exactly as a 500/2000 with 1 meg would, except that you will
have a fully functional internal CD drive, and S-VHS output. At this moment
the CDTV is the only CBM developed unit to have this high definition output.
{p} {p}
It will also boot the Fred Fish Collection CD Roms that were released by
Hypermedia Concepts, to a 1.3.1 workbench with the floppy drive active. BUT,
it will reset as soon as the eject button on the CD is touched.
