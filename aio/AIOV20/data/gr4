Welcome to the crazy (sad?!) world we live in. Yes thats right, Petro
Tyschtschenko the game is born from the infamous James L Boyd, who if
my memory serves me right brought us that master piece, the Homer
Simpson game, the idea was to drop the food icons on the Homer face to
feed him and he would speak whatever had been dropped on him. Ah that
was a nice little program... oh yeah back to Petro the game, well,
there is a face of Petro in a WB window and a button to click, when
you click it Petro will say his name.

I hear you all gasp, yes you read correctly, thats all it does, of
course this isn't a proper 'game' its a joke, a laugh, something funny
to mess around with?!!? Well whatever it is its ermm ermm, just don't
ask.
