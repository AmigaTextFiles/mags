There will always be those that will argue but the glory days of the
Amiga and therefore the Amiga scene seem to be far gone....  although
there is always hope of a revival it seems so distant at the moment.
{p} {p}
This has led to many talented scene individuals moving into
alternative area, such as the PC scene for example. An increasing
trend with musicians is to begin producing audio CDs. TRSi &
Fairlight Recordz already have numourous releases under their belts
and have even secured themselves an association with Sony on CD
duplication.
{p} {p}
Sidewinder, infamous module creator, has also taken the plunge and
compiled many of his best tracker tunes onto CD called, simply, FUTURE
SHOCK 2. Containing 15 tracks and weighing in at a decent 71 minutes
you are certainly getting the quantity. What about the quality
though? Well, here's the line-up...
{p} {p}
1. {bold}After Shock{nobold} - 3m43s{p}
Initially it sounds like a fairly average techno-dance track but
listen to it a few times and it seems to grow on you. Energetic drum
rhythms and analogue synth screeches keep this tune pumping and it's
nice to see Sidey hasn't been afraid to mix a load of samples in
there, nothing worse than a well made but repetative track, huh!  Only
critisium is that some of the samples could be a bit more, well,
original. How hard is it to sample!! So why does everyone keep using
the same ones in rave tracks!
{p} {p}
2. {bold}Passion Slave{nobold} - 4m37s{p}
In my opinion this is the poorest track on the album. It's techno but
it just sounds very amatuer (and out of tune) in places. There just
doesn't seem to be much structure put into it. Not a complete
disaster but doesn't stand with the other tracks well.
{p} {p}
3. {bold}Catch It Up{nobold} - 3m01s{p}
Absolutely great hardcore that never lets up for a second. If only
that breakbeat sounded slightly more crisper then it would be perfect.
But then again, maybe I'm just nit-picking here. But a very nice
choon, keep the volume up and go crazy!
{p} {p}
4. {bold}Slicetacy{nobold} - 2m25s{p}
So  far, this is my favourite on the disc out of the four tracks I've
reviewed. Slicetacy seems more structured than the other three tracks
with distinctive rhythms asopposed to a mix-mash of samples. Some
great dark analogue synthsounds!
{p} {p}
5. {bold}Rainy December{nobold} - 3m26s{p}
A change of style completely to a softer piano track with a gentle
beat, warm harmonies and a hint of sax for good luck. Nothing
outstanding but a good contrast to all the techno tracks.
{p} {p}
6. {bold}Tribal To Space{nobold} - 7m18s{p}
As the title suggests a spacey breakbeat track. This is the longest
track on the whole CD. The combination of haunting harmonies and the
breakbeat in this trance tune work very well though.
{p} {p}
7. {bold}Reflects{nobold} - 5m19s{p}
Somewhere on the border between ambient and demo style this is another
track that relys heavily on the piano with minimal drum rhythms.
Special compliment to Sidey on the sax though....  verryyyy smooth!  I
like it!!
{p} {p}
8. {bold}Tales From The Rave{nobold} - 5m58s{p}
Old skool rave that although nothing new (remember what I said about
using old samples earlier!) but you'll love it if you like the stuff.
Sounding very much like authentic old rave mixes so extra brownie
points there. You'll either love it or hate it.... like Marmite but
what the hell has that got to do with this review!!  Ahem, I'll shut
up!
{p} {p}
9. {bold}Back 2 A Time{nobold} - 5m51s{p}
More old skool and pretty much the same comments as I wrote for "Tales
From The Rave" apply to this except this one is more structured than
the megamix style of the previous tune. Listen carefully for some
impressive sounding sub-bass effects if you are playing it on a decent
stereo...  why aren't you already!!??
{p} {p}
10. {bold}Anastasia{nobold} - 4m36s{p}
I remember hearing this module on the "Mindfield" demo by Megawatts a
couple of years ago and I remember it growing on me then, so it
brought back memories to hear it on the CD. A more dancey style
techno track as opposed to hardcore with some big'n'chunky drums in!
Everything just seems to fit together on this one and I like it...
very much!
{p} {p}
11. {bold}Transport{nobold} - 5m40s{p}
Absolutely hyper hardcore techno!  Remember what I said about the
Marmite!! You'll either love it or hate it. Love the indian flute
thrown in the middle though as a constrast to the fast breakbeats,
thankfully it paid off well.
{p} {p}
12. {bold}Future Shock II{nobold} - 6m31s{p}
The CD's namesake and yet another another hardcore style techno tune,
although I wouldn't say it stood out from any of the other tracks.
Not really much I can add to this, all been said.
{p} {p}
13. {bold}Control <CUBIC>{nobold} - 3m38s{p}
Surprise, more hardcore techno!  Good use of vocal samples though make
this track stand out from many of the rest.
{p} {p}
14. {bold}Nxl Cio{nobold} - 4m56s{p}
Techno of the hard-cored variety....  these descriptions are getting
more difficult to make interesting! This WOULD have been a good track
apart from the  fact that the sub-bass synth sample used is far too
loud  and just seems to muffle out all the other instruments...  shame
really!  Hmmmm.....  is it just my imagination or was there a blatent
Star Wars snippet in there too!!!!!
{p} {p}
15. {bold}Ari-San <CROSSROAD>{nobold} - 3m36s{p}
The last track to grace the Future Shock 2 album and a complete change
of musical style. I can only describe this as rock-influenced techno
(or techno-influence rock, whatever you want to call it). Uplifting
harmonies  make this a great finale to the CD....  well done
Sidewinder!
{p} {p}
{p} {p}
The  verdict! Cosmetically, the CD cover, inlay and packaging is very
professionally designed with a clear tracklist and tracktimes on both
the box and the CD itself. The obligatory AMIGA tick-mark logo also
makes an appearance too... well, credit where it is due huh! Talking
of which a couple of photos of Sidewinder himself grace the back cover
of the CD case.
{p} {p}
The actual CD audio is high quality and well mixed with no hard
left-right stereo effect as with some audio CDs mixed from Amiga
modules.  The only critisium is that it has that "made on computer"
feel to it.  My only guess being something to do with 8-bit samples
but it's not that serious and if you can get over that you will enjoy
it.
{p} {p}
Being heavily techno based, although there are a couple of alternative
tracks on there to surprise you with, you'll have to like this sort of
music to even consider getting hold of this CD. So take note of that!
{p} {p}
Overall though Sidewinder has produced a very nice complilation album
of his finest tracks that although in my opinion doesn't QUITE reach
the standard of commercial albums due to 8-bit sampling is as
near-as-dammit to warrant a purchase!
{p} {p}
Overall - 84%
