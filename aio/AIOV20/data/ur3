  This is a really small patch to replace the ¤ character (ASCII 164, alt+y on
most keymaps) of the built-in font topaz 8 to look like the euro currency
symbol - this ASCII code is apparently where it will be placed? :) Anyway, it
works, and it won't waste any CPU time or patch any library functions. You can
also remove the patch and get the old symbol back by sending the program a
ctrl+c. It's just too bad that the symbol doesn't fit in with the other symbols
($, £, ¥) or letters; it's not thick enough :) On the other hand it's perfect
for XEN 8 and 9, but with those and all other disk-based fonts you'll have to
use a regular font editor to add the symbol. :)
