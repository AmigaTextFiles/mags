VillageTronic has confirmed it has enough pre-orders to go ahead with the
Voodoo 3D expansion for the Picasso-IV graphics card.  The cards should be
available by March, but this isn't a confirmed date.

The new card should have good support by release thanks to the work on
Warp3D - the new hardware independant 3D libraries.  These allow programs
to run on any 3D card so programs which may have been developed now on
Phase 5 hardware will in the future run on the PicassoIV.
