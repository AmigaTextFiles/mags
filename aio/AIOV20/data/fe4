 In May 1999 it will be the two year birthday issue of Amiga
Information Online and this time I thought I'd do something a bit
more special than last year. What is it you're wondering? Well
how does AIO in a printed magazine sound?
{p} {p}
 If it went ahead, AIO would be printed in an A5 type black
and white booklet and be available in a limited amount to add
that extra specialness. Firstly though I'd need to get quite
a few people interested in it to see if it is financially an
option and enough people to produce it for.

 On the Just-Amiga mailing list it was suggested it could
include some of the older 'classic' things, old articles, interviews,
reviews etc as well as new articles and worth while things to
make you want to buy it.

 A project of this size would be quite a lot of work and to make
it happen we will have to start to organise things as soon as
possible so I'd be grateful if you think this is a good idea
and would be interested in buying a copy to email me right now
and let me know.
