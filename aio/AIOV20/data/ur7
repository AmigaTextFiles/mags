  WBStartup Manager (or WBSMgr) is a small utility that reads the contents
of your WBStartup drawer, and displays its contents in the same order as
they are launched. You can then rearrange their order in the list and when
you're done, it will write suitable STARTPRI tooltypes into their icons to
make Workbench run them in the specified order.

  Since arranging the launch order with Workbench's "Info" function is quite
difficult and slow, this program comes in very handy. I think that I even got
rid of MagicMenu locking the machine (when I swap screens when a window is
opening) just by making it run before other patches that could interfere
with it. And I didn't even think of trying that before I had this program
right before my eyes... What a godsend! :)

  WBSMgr is a bit unfinished; you can't drag the listed programs into their
new positions even when it uses MUI (there are "Up" and "Down" buttons instead).
And when it's reading the contents of WBStartup, it skips the programs that
are only project icons (with the default tool elsewhere in your HD), and lists
subdirectories :) But it does the job and can be quite useful as it was for me :)
