 Labyrinth 2 with its annoying music and dodgy spelling, is it the
best way to spend a Sunday night? hmmm we find out...
{p} {p}
 The short desciption said that this is a one-big-level-platform-game. I
thought, great! As platformers are one of my favourite game genres. I
downloaded this immediatly. You can imagine the surprise I had when I 
found out this was a maze game!

 You are a man lost in a very large labyrinth (aren't we all?). You have
to find the door out. The only thing you have to do is walk...walk..walk
...jump...walk... until you find the door. Exciting eh? Well...

 It took me a whole hour to complete the labyrinth, and this was on my
10th go, using the map included in the archive. The author urges you to
avoid using the map at first, but it is impossible to complete without
the map, and a bit less impossible with the map.

 The man walks rather slowly, so to speed him up, you can press any
mouse button. I find leaving a brick, or your elbow on the mouse makes
the game a bit more playable, because you are not waiting for the man to
move!

 Unlike most other maze games this is a platformer, which makes this
game totally diffrent from the rest. You regually have to climb some
platform things to get higher. If you fall you will most proberly go
right back to where you started!

 This one has taken its time to appear on the Aminet, it was made in
1997, but that aside, if you want a challenge, download this and get
real peaved with it!
