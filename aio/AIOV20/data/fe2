 After a long time of research I have finally found a place to host
the AIO site with the name www.aio.net. It will allow easier access
and allow many more new readers to access the site. As it will be
a professional site the access will also be quite alot quicker than
at the moment.
{p} {p}
 Other advantages are the site will be updated regularly and each
section, editor of the magazine will have a seperate email address
meaning quicker replys and a magazine that bits are better placed.
{p} {p}
 At current we have £50 UKP / £100 UKP and would only need 5 people
to donate £10 or 10 people to donate £5 each and we could purchase
the site. If you can help you will be entered into a competition
to win all of the following :-
