Bouncing Round is an Amiga version of the famous Puzzle Bubble© game
in which two dinosaur players fire different colour balls to hit the
same colour balls. Once a set of three balls has built up the balls
will fall taking any other balls below with it. Bouncing Round claims
to be the first Amiga version of Puzzle Bubble© but i'm unsure about
this, it is the first version I have seen but I can't say that it is
the first or not.

Its a great puzzle game that will keep you hooked for hours, the idea
as explained above is to fire the ball which is randomly placed in
the cannon and you have to hit the same colour balls, once a set of
three is in place they will fall taking any other balls no matter what
colour they are, even if there aren't three. This may sound easy but
every so often a block is placed at the top of the screen and the balls
move down one, al la tetris. Once one of the balls touch the bottom it
is game over, one life and thats it.

As you go through the levels a background picture is built up, I suppose
once the picture is complete you finish the game or another picture
is built up, who knows? I couldn't get that far! This game will definatly
keep puzzle game players hooked and even people who like me aren't
really into puzzle games. Be warned though you do get the urge to 
launch your computer out the nearest window when a ball doesn't go in
the correct place and its nearly gameover.

Overall a great game that will keep most people entertained for hours,
the temptation to throw your computer in the bin is not so good but
definatly a game worth checking out.
