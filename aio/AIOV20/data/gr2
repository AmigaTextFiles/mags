 Can you recognize a mad cow? If you can't, download this. This very
informative piece gives you access to a small database of crazy cows and
normal cows. Well, there are two entries, each with a picture and a raw
sound sample.

 I find the simpliest way to distingish the two cows, is the eyes and
their moo! This is a game/gag program, so don't be alarmed when its not
a exciting as your normal Aminet game.

 Overall this has got great graphics, and funny sounds, worth a look in
my eyes.
