software for yourself. There are many ways to do this, first check
out Amiga magazine cover CD's like those found on the Amiga Format.

How to set up the software:
{p} {p}
There are only two main packages that need to be set up and these
are very simple to do :-
{p} {p}
{p} {p}
Miami (Dial-in software):
{p} {p}
Firstly run the MiamiInit program. Select your serial device and
unit number which for most people will be serial.device and unit
0. Then select your modem from the list supplied. Then you will be
asked to enter the phone number, if you live in london enter the 0181
number that Free dot Net supplied you with, otherwise enter the
0845 number which can also be found on the information sheet you
receive when joining. In the first box 'IP address' select 'Dynamic'
and in the 'Protocol' box select 'PPP'. Next enter your login name
and password which you can find on the sheet Free dot Net supplied
to you.
{p} {p}
Click Dial and wait for the modem to dial up. Once it has connected
you will probably get words that don't mean anything, don't worry
just click 'Send login ID' and then after click 'Send password'
{p} {p}
Save the config and load up Miami the program.
{p} {p}
Goto the menu Settings and click Import from Miamiinit. Select the
Miamiinit.config that you have just made. Go to the dialer section
and make sure the 'Dial Script' is the same as the following :-
{p} {p}
ABORT "NO DIAL TONE","NO DIALTONE"{p}
DIALNEXT "BUSY","NO CARRIER"{p}
WAIT "CONNECT"{p}
ABORT{p}
DIALNEXT "NO CARRIER"{p}
SENDUSERID{p}
SENDPASSWORD{p}
{p} {p}
If not then change it to match the above script.
{p} {p}
In the TCP/IP section 'Use ICMP' and 'Verify DNS servers' should both be
ticked. In PPP section, 'VJC' and 'Get DNS from IPCP' should both be
ticked also.
{p} {p}
Goto the settings menu and select Save and Save as default.
{p} {p}
Click Online and you will be online.
{p} {p}
{p} {p}
Yam (Email package):
{p} {p}
Goto the Settings Menu and load up Configuration.
{p} {p}
In the First steps section enter your real name, full email address
(<WHATEVER>@thefree.net) the Free dot Net Pop3 server which is :
{p} {p}
mail.thefree.net
{p} {p}
And then your password which is the same as your login password, all
in the boxes labeled.
{p} {p}
Go into TCP/IP and in the box marked Server, type: mail.thefree.net
Next in the Domain box type: thefree.net
{p} {p}
Under the title Receive Mail (POP3) should be something which
is similar to your email address, click on it and the previously
fuzzed out boxes will be accessable. In Server type: mail.thefree.net
in User Id type the bit before @thefree.net so if your email address
was CoolAmiga@thefree.net you would type CoolAmiga. Then in password
type your login password. Click the boxes 'Active' and 'Delete mail
on server'.
{p} {p}
The rest of the sections are your own personal choice, click save
and reset your computer.
{p} {p}
Dial in and get someone to send a test email, you will now beable to
receive and send email.
