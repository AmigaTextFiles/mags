Free choice PPC kernel petition Web page
{p} {p}
It's up to Amiga users to choose!
{p} {p}
Since it is obvious that phase5 and Haage & Partner can not make an
agreement between themselfs which can resolve the current PPC kernel for
Amiga situation it is time for Amiga users to decide that for them. This
page is not about preferring one or another kernel (ppc.library or WarpOS),
it is about giving a PPC Amiga user the free choice to choose which one they
want to use. With the time the better PPC kernel will win what will depend
about number of available PPC programs and better particular kernel support
and of course perfomance.
{p} {p}
However, to archieve the equal conditions for both kernel to race against
each other it is important to remove ppc.library from Blizzard PPC flashrom.
Phase5 ppc.library is loaded all the time on BlizzardsPPC and make a lot of
problems for Haage & Partner WarpOS functioning correctly on these boards
(it needs to be terminated).
{p} {p}
This is what this petition is all about... the free choice for Amiga PPC
users to choose which one they want to use without forcing to one solution
or another. Right now ppc.library from phase5 is forcing user to use phase5
ppc.library kernel. PPC.library can be placed in libs: and function
correctly like it already does on CyberStormPPC cards.
{p} {p}
If you want that ppc.library be removed from flashrom and placed in libs
instead, sign petition (open for all Amiga users, not just ones who own
BlizzardPPC card) which will be sent to phase5 (Mr. Wolf Dietrich) with this
content:

Mr. Wolf Dietrich,
{p} {p}
With this petition, the Amiga users ask to Phase5 GMBH to move the ppc.library
of the BlizzardPPC boards from the flashrom to the libs directory (like
in the CyberstormPPC boards). This will not disable ppc.library kernel
in any way, but it will give to the users the freedom to choose which
PPC kernel to use. We all hope in a Your positive reply to this issue.
{p} {p}
Your Sincerely:
{p} {p}
