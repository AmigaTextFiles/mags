  AMarquee is a library (plus some other stuff) that makes it really easy
for programmers to implement Internet communication - no need to mess around
with the sockets. The ordinary user can forget about its existence after
installing it, and the coder shouldn't have trouble getting started with it;
I browsed the programmer docs for about half an hour and it's already pretty
clear to me how to use it :) And in AMarquee it's especially easy to support
more than two players - there's not much difference in the code :)

  Transfering information is made very simple in AMarquee; data packets
arrive to a standard message port and the server has "global variables" of a
sort; the programs may request to be notified when some client changes a
variable. Sending data to multiple clients is easy, and many commands also
support wildcards (e.g. send this to connected clients from #?.org, or
request notification on variables matching "game#?" etc). Clients connected
to a server can easily connect directly to each other "privately", without
data going through the server. AMarquee is re-entrant to minimize memory
usage and multithreaded, so each connection will start a new thread and your
program won't have to wait unnecessarily :) There are far too many nice
features to list here, so I'll stop now :)

  Since AMarquee supports wildcards so heavily and transmits data in a
"high-level" way, it might be too slow for some heavy-traffic things,
such as some games that need to be real-time and send a lot of data. But
since it's so easy to get started with and use, and there's even an
AMarquee for Java, it's a viable option for novice and even expert coders.
From now on I don't want any game programmer telling me that it's too
difficult to support Internet multiplay...! :)
