  TextInfo is a silly little tool that reads a text file, counts words inside
it and displays statistics. It reports the number of bytes read, letters,
words, unique words, subsumes, syllabications etc. Then it lists the words;
the one used most often is first. Next comes a subsume report; for example it
detects that the word "tools" is the same thing as "tool", and then it makes
a list showing how many of the used words you need to know in order to
understand a certain percentage of the text (5..95% with steps of 5%).

  You can configure it to skip some part(s) of the report, and set the endings
to subsume etc, but it still won't be perfect - language is just not that
simple, unfortunately :) It can be fun to see the reports of some text files,
and TextInfo is written with email signatures in mind so you can append
statistics to every message, but it won't be a lot of fun for very long, as you
probably can imagine.. :) Here is a shortened version of the report generated
from this text upto the colon:
