{p} {p}

ShadowWorks Software announces the Version 1.5 update to NewsRog,
the Amiga newsreader which has been called "The best newsreader
available - on any platform", and provides advanced features for the
power user that few other newsreaders anywhere can match.
{p} {p}
Version 1.5 includes over 40 new features and changes.  In keeping
with the NewsRog tradition of being the first newsreader in the
world to introduce cutting edge features such as scrollable quote
blocks, NewsRog introduces a first-of-its-kind algorithm for telling
the difference between nonstandard quotation prefixes such as
"Joe:", and the same string occuring as an accidental part of
unquoted text.
