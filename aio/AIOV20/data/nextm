 Next month will see a full review of PFS2, the new filing system from
RamJam Consultants. Also at last Genetic Species is put to its test,
seeing how good it really is, it took some time for it to be reviewed
in AIO but now it is finally here. We will also be taking a look at
the new game from Digital Dreams Entertainment if it is released in
time.

expect to see a full review in AIO next issue. We are still waiting
in the wings for when Wasted Dreams from Vulcan is ready but expect
to see that reviewed when it comes out.

articles, I hope to see you again next month.
