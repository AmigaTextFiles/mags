Hello, Chris
{p} {p}
I would like to be one of the first to congratulate you for the wonderful
new look of the AIO magazine.
{p} {p}
I think it is one of the best front ends I have seen to a magazine.
{p} {p}
i.e.    simple to use.{p}
        has pictures and text on screen pages.{p}
        does not require any complicated installations.{p}
        fast.{p}
        runs with other programs.{p}
{p} {p}
I particularly liked the articles section taking the !!!! out of the PC. I
have heard so many of these lately that I did not think I would laugh any
more until I read that article.
{p} {p}
I can only say well done I am looking forward to reading the next
edition.
{p} {p}
Bye for now,
{p} {p}
yours sincerely,
{p} {p}
Barry Beeston.

{italic}Hello Barry, thanks for your letter and your kind comments, i'm truely
glad you like the new GUI and please give praise to Linus Akesson for
the hard work he has put in to bring this new GUI to us. If you'd like

Hi!
{p} {p}
Just a few comments on the new AIO GUI.
{p} {p}
It is very slow when running on a 16 Bit screen, scrolling down is a pain,
as it scrolls pixel by pixel, no chance to jump-scroll down.
{p} {p}
It looks more like a Windows GUI rather than an Amiga GUI, why not either
coding it as a standard MUI application or just switch to HTML ? HTML would
be really the best, as it is able to look great on better equipped amiga
whilst it won't loose much of the graphical optics when running on lower
Amigas.
{p} {p}
If the current GUI is used, please insert a better navigation bar, maybe all
buttons of the main window should be placed as buttons on bottom of the
window.
{p} {p}
However I really would prefer using HTML for the future.
{p} {p}
Just my $0.02 ;)
{p} {p}
And HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO THE AIO TEAM!
{p} {p}
Regards,
{p} {p}

{italic}As with all new things not everyone is going to like it and yes it
seems you don't Sascha. Well regarding it running slowly it really depends
on how far you are pushing your Amiga, if you are expect to get the
full benifits from the new GUI using the great new 256 colours on a
basic Amiga then i'll tell you now it just won't work. I suggest you
turn down the screen colours on under powered Amigas. The above letter
says its fast so who knows whats going on?!
{p} {p}
Although MUI is very good and I couldn't live without it everything
done using MUI has that now stale MUI look which doesn't change from
program to program and really I don't see any benifits of using MUI.
This new GUI gets across AIO in a much better way and the cosmetics
of something are only for first impressions, it should really be the
content of AIO you should worry about.
{p} {p}
Currently HTML is not really an option. At the moment there are many
magazines around and not alot stand out from the crowd, to many games
only magazines, to many online/html magazines which I see boring and
plain. AIO is hopefully different and this GUI makes it special and
different to all the other clone magazines. I think this is a strong
point of AIO and I hope most of you would agree.
{p} {p}
Add your $0.02 anytime, feel free to encourage us or flame us, thats
the only way we'll improve.{noitalic}

Hi Chris and Linus,
{p} {p}
First of all, I would like to thank you very much for your effort to
make a such Workbench compliant GUI for your AIO EZine.  I'm a CGX-only
user since a long time now, and your magazine is one of very few through
years that have tried to reach CyberGraphX/Picasso96 as well. Thanks! 
{p} {p}
Now I would like to report that pictures in AIO issue 19 are badly
rendered on Hi/True color CGX screens (false colors).  I hope your next
issue will have this problem fixed! :)  
{p} {p}
Kind regards,
{p} {p}
Francis Labrie
{p} {p}
{italic}Well credit goes out to Linus yet again! The problem with the pictures
in AIO has now been fixed so hope its working for you now, if not just
let me know.{noitalic}

Hi,
{p} {p}
Just a small idea for AIO.. When URL's or E-Mail addresses are displayed,
how about making them a `hotlink'? URL's would be easy using
gotourl.library :).
{p} {p}
Review MegaBook... It's on the Aminet under AAA_MegaBook.lha, a free
registration address book program, I could mail it if ya like :).
{p} {p}
"The Work of Satan" article by Nicky Hunt is a little wrong in some places,
I was bored so I thought i'd correct them :)
{p} {p}
3rd point: 252 characters in Win95, but yeh, basically it only has 8.
10th point: You can't display anything without a graphics card ;) (unless it
has an onboard gfx set).{p}
13th: Try 30 minutes! :){p}
19th: Yeh, it does.. Run doskey (comes with dos/win).{p}
21th: I'm afraid you can get it for Win 95/98/NT :(, runs s**t tho!{p}
25th: Visual Basic 5.{p}
27th: Yes.
{p} {p}
I could think of a few more!
{p} {p}
31. Windows 98 is the worst piece of software ever written, it took me 3
hours to encourage it to install over Win95 and then an hour to stop it
from having Fatal Exceptions every time it booted up. <G>
{p} {p}
32. Exploring your HD as "a web page" is just plain sad :)
{p} {p}
33. Windows tasks can't perform asynchronus file i/o.
{p} {p}
34. Windows treats you like an idiot until it doesn't work, and then it
treats you like a rocket scientist to make it work again.
{p} {p}
35. I hate clouds :-D
{p} {p}
{italic}Thanks for your letter Steve. The hotlink is a good idea which earlier
was also suggested by Renne (Utilities Editor) It has now been implanted
in this issue for web pages and hopefully will work fine for you, just
drop me a note to let me know how its working for you. 
{p} {p}
The article by Nicky Hunt is quite old and wasn't sent to me directly
from him but from Lee (Games Editor) - So somethings could be wrong,
thanks for your updating.{noitalic}

Hello Chris and the rest of the AIO folk,
{p} {p}
I really like your new interface.  It looks lovely and is sooo easy to
navigate.  Ok so it's a tad on the slow side even under CGFX on a CV643D 
but what the heck.
{p} {p}
I like your articles section (hey maybe I should write something soon) 
and the Digital Images interview was a bit of a scoup.
{p} {p}
And of course I have now entered the competitions :)
{p} {p}
So keep up the good work and I look forward to the next issue of AIO.
{p} {p}
{italic}Again as with all the letters this issue thankyou for your very nice
comments. It makes producing AIO worth while when we get feed back like
this. All the effort and hard work the editors and me put in seems
like it has paid off.
{p} {p}
You will find the competition results in this issue of AIO in the
articles section, maybe you have won!?.{noitalic}
