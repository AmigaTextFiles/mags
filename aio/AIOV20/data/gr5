 When I saw this on the Aminet, I jumped at the chance to download it,
it has to be my favourite game as the moment.
{p} {p}
 This version is the same as the previous FreeCell reviewed last month.
Some new features have been added;
{p} {p}
- Added single move undo
{p} {p}
- You can now quit FreeCell in the middle of a game it and continue it on your
  next session. - However, I don't think this works properly
{p} {p}
- Added a tool dock which contains 4 buttons to Start a new game, select a
  game, restart a game and undo the last move.  For those people who are too
  lazy to use the menu.  If you close this window, you can open it again from
  the menu.
{p} {p}
- You can use the 'help' key to bring up the guide.
{p} {p}
- If you didn't like my idea of multiple statistics files, you can now switch
  off that annoying stats file requester and get playing sooner! See the guide
  for details.
{p} {p}
- For new stats files, the original display screen is now cloned from Workbench.
  This may help some people with graphic boards who were having trouble starting
  FreeCell with a PAL (640 x 256) screen.
{p} {p}
- Added the ability to load the solution to a game and play through it. This
  is so you can see how someone else solved the game - or use it for
  educational or fun value.
{p} {p}
- You can now change the number of FreeCells during a game.  This can only be
  done if you resign the current game.
{p} {p}
- The solutions are now stored in their own directory.
{p} {p}
 The game play is still the same, it's great to have an undo feature,
because you can go back if you've double clicked on a card by mistake.
The tool dock is quite handy too, but what I like mostly is the solution
saver. When I got stuck on a game, I EMail'ed the author, and he sent
the solution which I could browse through. I found that getting all the
aces out first isn't always the best way!
