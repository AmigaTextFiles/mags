Well here it is, January with Valentine's Day just a couple of weeks 
away. Time to start stocking up on all those heart-shaped goodies for 
your better half. Does this have any bearing on this month's selections? 
Well, maybe; but you'll have to read on to find out.

Jedi Net{p}

With Episode I coming up, and a second new trailer due out the twenty-
third, sites like this are almost a necesity for the die-hard fan. From 
collectibles available on-line (even for Episode I), to the latest news 
on the new movie, conventions, and most things Jedi. There are parody 
scripts, humorous opinions based on clips from the movies, and a rather 
amusing journel. But even if you tire of the large assortment of Star 
Wars literature, software, multimedia, and previews of the upcoming 
movie, there's still the short films from fans to consider (Kung Fu 
Kenobi's Big Adventure anyone?). Even email Lord Vader. So, if you're a 
wannabe jedi, then this is the place to stop by.

Design your own logo online, complete with choice of font, style, and 
text, with the result being spit out as a jpeg file. Warning though, 
this site uses java script.

Amiga Ring Homepage{p}

With web Rings abounding, it's no surprise that there's an Amiga one. 
The home page of the Amiga Web Ring, a ring that at present has 279 
sites, was created in Sept of '96 and connects to Amiga related sites. 
From sites for programmers, developers, and sales to personal pages, 
everything you need to add your page to the Ring is here; code fragments 
for the Ring images, a brief form to fill out with your site info, and 
an apparent willingness to keep adding to the Ring no matter how large it 
gets. If you've got a good Amiga page, then check this place out.

The Onion{p}
{bold}{link http://www.theonion.com}http://www.theonion.com{end}{nobold}{p}
A serious looking site, with appearance and feel of an actual newspaper,
complete articles written and presented from a newspaper style, 
complete with pictures, headlines, etc. All it's missing is the serious 
part.
{p} {p}
It's a site devoted completely to humor, made all the more funny by 
it's serious-appearing treatment. Every article is presented with a 
satirical tongue, with regular issues like any good newspaper. Example: 
14 year old boy crushed by the weight of company logo stickers warn on 
his shirt, animal activitsts release 71,000 cows into the wild (of which 
a hundred or so are immediately killed by drowning or electrocution), or 
a man pauses to consider his 500+ reclining options in his new chair. I 
think you get the idea.

Valentine.com{p}

Okay, so I managed to find a theme site for Valentine's Day. It has 
everything you'll need to survive the dreaded lover's holiday, and even 
a little something for those finding themselves alone for that day.
{p} {p}
First, for those lonely ones, you can build your own dream date. yes, 
you read right. Answer a few questions, click on a few options describing 
some features of your desired, and a few moments later it matches your 
description up with a real-life celebrity, complete with picture. Of 
course, getting that person's phone number is your problem.
{p} {p}
Already have someone? Well, why not send a web-page greeting card to him 
or her?  Or if you don't like the on-line approach, you can have an 
actual greeting card or romantic letter, with your own personal message, 
mailed out through the US mail; even specifiy the type of letter 
(romantic, amorous, humorous, etc.).
{p} {p}
Have a lost love? Find them from anywhere in the world through their 
name searching engine. Need advice on relationships- that's here too.  
There's even a perfectcard picker, to help you in selecting the card 
that's just right for the one you're sending it to.  Or maybe chat with 
some new people.
{p} {p}
Rounding out the site is a section on "How We Met" stories, not to mention 
the best and worst pick-up lines and their humorous comebacks. This last 
one is almost worth the price of admission by itself.
{p} {p}
Well, that's all for this month. I think I'll go back and try that 
build your own dream date page; that's probably about as close as I'll 
ever get :)
