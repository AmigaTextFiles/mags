The Phase 5 graphics cards for the Amiga 1200 and Blizzard 603e series are
now shipping worldwide. These cards, which fit on the expansion port of the
Blizzard 603e or 603e+ accelerator cards provide the A1200 with high speed
graphics display with 8MB on board RAM - giving displays in 24bits (16.7
million colours) with resolutions greater than a thousand pixels each way.
The cards don't have a pass-through for the AGA video though, leaving those
who need it with the need for two monitors or one of the common switchers
available now.

Want one? Check with your local dealer, but be quick - some dealers sold out

Early shipments of the cards appear to have the wrong driver, Phase 5 have
posted some software updates on their website.
