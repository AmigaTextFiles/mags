This month i've trundled off to the dark room that Mark Wilson of
Amibench is locked. Inside I found Mark chained to the computer
begging for freedom after being forced to type millions of adverts on
the oh-so popular Amibench site.... Well that's not exactly true, but
it sounded good anyhow? After you've read this don't forget to visit
his site and pay him some respects, you can find it at :

CS: Who are you and what do you do?
{p} {p}
MW: I'm currently at college, studying computers, and I'm also a
Archaeologst (but its not the weather for it)
{p} {p}
CS: Whats is AmiBench all about and what does it do?
{p} {p}
MW: AmiBench was created out of a need to have a good buy/sell and
exchange mart, I found Comp.Sys.Amiga.marketplace a bit messy with lots of
spam mails and rubbish posts. It's Basicly a Exchange service, I supply the
space, and the time, and you just supply the advert, which gets displayed
for 2 weeks, and then removed.
{p} {p}
CS: How was AmiBench started and what was the idea behind it?
{p} {p}
MW: It was started after I had the idea about it on IRC; I spoke to a
few people, and we agreed to form what was supposed to be a 'killer' Amiga
Web site, a sort of clone between AWD, Amiga.org, and AmiBench as it is.
After awhile (about 6 months) I felt the project was not working, and left
with my AmiBench idea, I was given, space by a good friend and the rest is
history.
{p} {p}
CS: How hard was it to bring a project this big to life?
{p} {p}
MW: It was fairly hard, as I don't know anything about perl, and I only
had a basic knowledege of html, I asked for help on the CU Amiga mail
list. I got help and support from Malcom Parons and Peter price who help
maintain the site.
{p} {p}
CS: What do you think of Amiga Inc's annoucement?
{p} {p}
MW: Which one?, I think anything that helps the Amiga is good, and the
3.5 one is good as well ...
{p} {p}
CS: If you had the choice how would you set about bringing the Amiga
back on top and what specifications would you have?
{p} {p}
MW: I'd go Amiga Inc's way, except I'd tell people about what I would
do, and lay out a road map, and stick to it
{p} {p}
CS: What is the one thing you would wish to add to AmiBench or would
need to improve AmiBench?
{p} {p}
MW: Sorry, Right now, that's under wraps :)
{p} {p}
CS: When is your happiest memory of the Amiga, what year?
{p} {p}
MW: 97, Because I met my girlfriend on irc (sad but true). We've been
very happy for a year together.
{p} {p}
CS: Is there anything you would like to say to the whole Amiga community?
{p} {p}
MW: Yes, Stick with the Amiga, and keep up the peace guys :)
{p} {p}
CS: Thanks for your time!
{p} {p}
MW: Anytime
