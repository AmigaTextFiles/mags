 Before I have even started this review you should know what it is,
if you don't then I'm not really sure why you don't know. The Aminet
is a vast collection of Amiga software, the biggest in the world
of its type to be correct. It contains all the software ever uploaded
by various authors and is updated regularly. You can only access 
the Aminet fully via the internet so thats is why the Aminet 28 CD
is useful.
{p} {p}
 The Aminet CDs are CDs full of all the software uploaded to the
Aminet in the past two months. Everything that is uploaded in that
time is shoved onto the CD. Aminet 28 has just been released and is
the December 1999 edition giving all files uploaded to the Aminet
since CD 27.

 In true Aminet CD tradition you will normally get the full version
of some software. This CD you get the FULL version of CygnusEd 3.5c
with the option to upgrade for a cheaper price.

 As there isn't alot to say about an Aminet CD except that they
should be bought, here is a run down of how much is in each section
of the CD :

 Overall I would recommend the Aminet CD to anyone, even if you have
access to the Aminet it would cost you alot more to download all the
software contained on this CD. I think that the pictures should be
cut down a little but other than that this is an excellent CD.
