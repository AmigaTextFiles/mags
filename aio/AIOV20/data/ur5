  Modern HTTP servers have supported resuming downloads for ages, but
even now there is no proper support for resume in the most popular web
browsers... That might be about to change, but while we're waiting for
something to happen we might just as well use external tools to resume our
interrupted downloads :) HTTPResume is one, if not the only resume tool
for the Amiga, and it does a great job - the resuming part works fine and
the small GUI bugs of the early versions have been fixed.

  HTTPResume can be used from Shell for scripts and such, but I'll focus
on the GUI. It's made with GadTools, and you can write in the URL to the
remote file, path to the local file, proxy address & port, byte range to
download and your time zone. The proxy is optional but it will usually
speed up the download, and the time zone is only needed for checking if
the remote file has been changed since you last downloaded a part of it.
Clicking the "F" button next to the "File" string will bring up a requester
where you can choose the filename, and if there is an URL in the file's
comment, it will automatically insert it to the URL string. Assuming that
you want to resume at the position where you left off, you can just click
"Start" and it'll continue downloading. The bar at the bottom of the
window will show how much you have downloaded of both the complete file
and the part that was remaining when you resumed.

  There's a fair amount of settings in HTTPResume, such as sounds, name of
screen to use, initial directory for the local filename, number of attempts
etc. Saving the settings will also save the Proxy and GMT fields. HTTPResume
also has an ARexx port so it can be quite handy to use in scripts.
