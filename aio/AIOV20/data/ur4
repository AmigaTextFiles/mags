  This is a great patch for everyone who has lots of fonts in their FONTS:
directory. Normally it takes ages for programs to read a listing of your
fonts, and at best ASL or ReqTools remembers the list the next time you
open a font requester - but after a reboot, the first font requester takes
ages again. FontCache is there to solve the problem: it caches a list of
your fonts on disk, so it will always take only a second or two to show a
font requester.

  FontCache is a patch to diskfont.library v39.3 which comes with AmigaOS
3.x. After you have installed the patch - which requires a little knowledge
of the Shell - the next font requester will scan the FONTS: directory, but
when it's finished it will also save the list on disk, so after that it won't
scan again unless you add or remove fonts. And when you do, FontCache will
automatically detect it and scan the directory, so you don't need to do
anything special. Included is also a new version of FixFonts that updates the
font cache aswell.

  There's not much to complain about FontCache, except that the installation
isn't too easy whilst a script *could* do it automatically. And the FixFonts
program has the same fatal bug with AFS as the original, even though it is a
complete rewrite - why hasn't it been fixed when the author knows about it! :)
But still, FontCache made my font-listings load a lot faster so it's well
worth the trouble :)
