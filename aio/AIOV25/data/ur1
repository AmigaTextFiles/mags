SmartInfo is a replacement for the SFSQuery util. So this will only be useful
to anyone who has SmartFileSystem installed on at least one partition.
The advantage with this over the original SFSQuery is that it has a MUI
interface! Ok, it might not be an advantage in every eyes, but...

So, what is SFSQuery then? SFSQuery is a small tool to check some information
on a SFS partition, like:
The offset's of the drive, bytes per block, total blocks and so on...

So, why would anyone want to use this instead of the CLI tool that comes
with SFS, well, for those of you that hates to use utils from the CLI, then
this will be a lifesaver.

There is one small difference between SFSQuery and SmartInfo, besides the
GUI, SmartInfo shows the Cache Misses percentage with two decimals, whereas
SFSQuery has no decimals at all.

The documentation is a Guide, that's nice, but it doesn't help so much, it
basically takes up the requirements and the authors E-Mail... But for this
util you won't need a doc anyway, just start it and choose the drive :)

It's also localized, but so far it only has one in Deutsch, so if you like
SmartInfo, get busy writing a translation in your language! :)

It also has an installer script, but I can't see that it is needed in this
case, the installation is only to copy it wherever you want to!
