Welcome to Part 2 of this tutorial series. This month we cover the
Lister, and a few nice little extras that can easily go overlooked.
{p} {p}
You will probably have already used the Name mode versus the Icon mode,
and even the Icon Action mode, but switching from Name to Icon mode, just
because there's one program there that insists on beiung run from
Workbench, can be a real nusance. Worry not, mentioned in one small line
buried deep in the manual is a solution of more importance than just the
single line given. While in Name Mode merely hold down the Shift key
while double clicking on the file name and it will be treated exactly as
if you had double clicked on the icon, including passing Tool Types,
running the Default Tool listed in the attached icon, the whole bit.
Useful for script files with attached IconX icons.

Inline editing is another useful item, if you have Magellan. Just go to
Settings-->Environment-->Lister Options to set how the Inline editing is
invoked. It can be set for Left, Left+Right, or Middle mouse button.
When used, y0ou can edit the Name, Date, Access, and Comment fields as
if you were in a normal text editor. The cursor keys can then be used to
move you around, with no need to press Return after each entry- merely
using thre arrow keys to move on will be sufficnent. It actually turns
out to be a bit easier to use than the corresponding feature in MacOS.

Then, a feature that allows you to have different Lister display
formats for specific paths. If you bring up the List Format window (by
double clicking on the given Lister), for a specific Lister, you can
make your display changes and then hit Save.  Since you changed it for
just this given Lister, the display changes you made will hencforth be
used ONLY for the exact same path has had that Lister when you invoked
the List Format. A useful example would be for the Libs: directory; I
add in a Version field so that I can get the versions of my libraries at
a glance, but it's not something I care to have for any other path.
Being able to have custom display formats for such things is a real
blessing.

Navigating a Name Mode Lister with a very long list of files and
directories is as easy as pressing a key. Hit a key and it will scroll
to the first file starting with that letter, enter another key and it
goes to the next file with that letter as it's second character, and so
on. Enter it with Shift held down and it scrolls to directories instead
of files. In either case, what you type is displayed in a pop-up string
gadget until you press Return or activate another Lister, but keeping the
Lister centered with the matching file scrolled to the top.

Finally, a little Hotkey trick. Bring up the Hotkey Editor and make a
hotkey for the following line:{p}
   Command SCANDIR <Directory Path> MODE = <name|icon|action>
This hotkey will then open up a new lister for the path Directory Path,
in the specified mode of name, icon, or icon action. A nice little
feature for those often-used directories.
