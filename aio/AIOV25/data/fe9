Hardware consists of the Power Port Junior High Speed Serial Interface(£30)
which fits onto the clock interface and emerges from the spare port on
the Amiga 1200 and of course a 56K Modem plus modem cables(£55) & 9-25
pin Adaptor(£5). Software consists of IBrowse(£30), Net & Web Disks,
Termite TCP Demo, Termite Demo & the Hypercom Serial Drivers Disk.

As you can see from the items priced up for individual purchase the cost
is about £120 plus Net&Web and the Demo Disks, but is it worth it to save
£20 on the bundle? Even with the scanty instruction sheet the PPJ was
dead simple to install as was the modem, which includes a separate
telephone plug-in. Apart from the superb Ibrowse manual the documentation
was pretty sparse. Net & Web consists of 5 A5 pages with about the same
for PPJ. The Hypercom Drvers had no documentation due to lack of space
on the disk. Accompanying the package is a leaflet enabling you to upgrade
to Net&Web2 for £29.95. When I tried to use the software I found out why
they are keen on selling Net&Web2. It is because Net&Web only allows you
to use one ISP, Demon, who will help you get on line for £140 for set up
fee and 1 years rental. If you cancel during the first month then you are
charged nothing. Net&Web also does not recognise PPP and recommends that
you use the Termite Demo supplied. This demo is limited to 1 up or
download per session, a time limit of 30 minutes. Ncomm which is supplied
on the Hypercom Disk cannot be used with the Hypercom Interface.

With the assistance of AF back issues I got the software installed and
decided to use Ncomm and the standard serial port. This enabled me to
access BBS sites and download files. One of which explained how to join
Freeserve. As advised I then installed Miami and taking the details from
AF I managed to access FreeUK.I don't know why but I was unable to set
up an Email address with FreeUK but I signed up with CallnetUK via
FreeUK and received Email address & Web space.

I have ended up using Miami and Yam which means shelling out shareware
fees, and a registered copy of Ibrowse. Like they say, you get what you
pay for. In the past I have bought Accelerators, CDRom and other sundry
items from Power and I have always had excellent value and service. I
just hope my experience is a one-off. The choice of bundle was between
Power & Active, swayed in Power's favour by the Power Port Junior but
I'm not so sure now how much of a bargain it is.
