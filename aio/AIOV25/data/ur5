TView is a TV-Table-Viewer, it will check what's on in the chosen channels.
This program is mainly aimed to Swedish people, but it can also check some
Norwegian, Finnish, Danish... channels.

TView will connect to www.dagenstv.com to get the channels, so you will need
a TCP/IP stack like Miami started. (It won't even start without one!)

The installation is quite simple, just extract it and edit a textfile to set
which channels it should check. But there is some trouble when you try to
start it, it will need atleast 12kb stack, because it uses NList.mcc, and
since it doesn't have an icon you will have to add one, and increase the
stack... I don't think it's so much work for the author to add an icon when
it's really needed. The documentation doesn't mention this, but that's quite
understandable since the documentation is the Aminet ReadMe file :)
But there isn't so much to explain, so I guess it's enough...

It's very easy to understand, just choose which hour (0-23) and press Update
so it will check what's on, and let you read more about the different
programs if you click on it's name. If you want to check the current hour,
just choose 24!

There is however a problem with the description field, if the TView window is
small, and there is a very long description, TView won't add a scrollbar to
the description field. But you can scroll it anyway by holding down the left
mouse and drag it, so it doesn't really matter.
