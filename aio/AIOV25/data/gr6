MUIMine is a mine sweeper clone, like the one you get with Windows, if
anyone has experienced that crack. The idea to find out where all the
mines are and put little flags over the spots where you think there are
mines. If you press the LMB parts of the area are uncovered, and some
helpfull numbers tell you how many mines are next to the spot. It's
simple really, but I can't explain things.

Although there is a 'Docs' directory, the first thing I noticed about
MUIMine is the lack of documentation. Infact, the only instructions
available are displayed in the progam info GUI: "Find all themines in
the mine field game". Oh, so helpfull!

I would have thought it would be obvious from the title, the MUIMine
requires MUI to work - If you didn't know that, then what did you think
MUI standed for? Ahem.

MUIMine has three different level settings already set up, Beginner,
Intermediate, and Expert. You can create your own difficultly level
using the MUI Mine Level Editor which is part of the main executable.
You can define the name, width, height, and the number of mines.

You can also change the imgagery. There are lots of face pictures, and
digits included in the archive for you to experiment with. There is even
some images ripped from Quake.

A lot of time and effort has gone into MUIMine, and the end result is
pleasing, even though there is no documentation to help you along the
way. I surpose if you wanted to know how to play you could download
another minesweeper clone (Let's face it, there are loads around) and
use the docs from that, but then you might as well play that version.
Oh, I don't know! Leave me alone.
