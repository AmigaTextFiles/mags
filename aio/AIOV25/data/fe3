We here at AIO appreciate feedback and constructive critisim, so I guess
it's about time we proved it. Below is a form you can use to give us all
your gripes, comments, etc., in a more or less standardized form.
Remember only that the key word is Constructive critisism, not Flames.
Flames and things that don't involve any actual useful suggestions will
promptly end up under my Garbage icon so I can hear the toilet-flushing
sound it makes when I hit 'Delete'.
{p} {p}
So, if there's anything you'd like to see changed, added to, altered,
whatever, then please use this form to tell us.  Of course, feel free to
tell us what's RIGHT as well, that way we won't change something you
like.
