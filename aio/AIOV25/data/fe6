This month on the JUST-AMiGA/AIO mailing list the subject of the
AIO icon which has been with us since our birth in May 1997 came
up. One of the members and our readers, Richard Lane suggested that
the icon was less than great.... well actually it seems alot less.
{p} {p}
In the words of Richard himself,
{p} {p}
{italic}"How about a decent icon for AIO? I think you'll agree the current
one is crap."{noitalic}
{p} {p}
So, as we like to take note of what our readers say, most of the time
we've decided to open up a little contest. Nothing major but a
little encouragement to get you all beavering away. The contest
is to design a new icon for AIO.
{p} {p}
If your icon is chosen then you will win a small game or cd or
something similar, nothing major, just as a thankyou gift. So if
you think your up for the challenge then get going.
{p} {p}
The icon should not be too big and {bold}must{nobold} include either the letters
'AIO' or the words 'Amiga Information Online'. If you are going to do
a 'newicons' icon then make sure that you design one that will show
if people do not have newicons installed. The last restriction is it
shouldn't have too many colours, about 32 at the most.

Send icons in lha/lzx with doc to : {bold}icons@aio.co.uk{nobold}

Closing Date : {bold}10th July 1999{nobold}
