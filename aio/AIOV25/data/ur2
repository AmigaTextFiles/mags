AmigaFileViewer is a FileManagement tool, like Explorer on PC (yuck!)...
{p} {p}
AmigaFileViewer (AFV from now on) uses gadtools (I think), so it isn't much
to look at. It has two fields, one TreeLister to the left, that holds the
Volumes and the dirs in the volumes. To the right it has a file lister.
{p} {p}
So after you have pressed a volume then it will list the files... You can
scroll up and down, at a very slow speed though.
{p} {p}
It has some kind of filetypes, but they are {bold}VERY{nobold} lousy. To add a new
filetype you choose Default Apps from the menu, and you will see a new
window, where you can add your own... It recognises the files by their
extension, so it is as lousy as Windows! And then you choose which app to
start according to the extension. But when you have created a default tool,
you can't edit it, you must delete the old one, and make a new... And it is
now that you hit the biggest fault with it, it doesn't work to delete them,
nothing happens when you press the delete button, so make sure to setup it
correctly from the beginning :)

It doesn't have a real documentation, just a Aminet ReadMe file, that doesn't
cover anything really.
{p} {p}
Also, a nice bug in the About window also, it has a picture that should say
"Amiga File Viewer", but on my system I just see "iga File Viewer"...
{p} {p}
I can't say anything else apart from "Stay away from this Util! You won't
miss it!"
