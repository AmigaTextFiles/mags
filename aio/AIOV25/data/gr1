DreamCars is a small racing game. When I say small I mean small. This
game was entered into the 32k or less games competition at the recent
Symposium coding party in Fallingbostel, Germany.
{p} {p}
The general idea of this competition is to create a game under 32k
and the best use of space wins for what they do. This game has put alot
into the 32k limit like music and some nice (for 32k) graphics. In
a 32k game you'd expect poor quality everything but for the space
they have been allowed I think the guys at the {bold}SECRETLY!{nobold} group who made
this deserve an award.

Most of us couldn't make a game like this in 320k never mind 32k. The
game itself is quite good. There are 2 racing cars, one blue and one
purple, it is two player only but I would have liked a computer player,
what can you expect in 32k though? The idea is the general racing game
type that you have the beat each other round the set number of laps
on 3 different courses.

Overall there isn't alot to say about the game because basically its
a racing game and you should all know the plot to these types of
games. The game may not last you long but I think that the authors
deserve the AIO Gold award just for getting a game into this small
amount of space. I suggest everyone takes a look at this to see how
much they have put into 32k. Would a PC competition be 'make the best
game in a small 32mb'? I wonder!
