In short this is an Amiga adaption of an electronic game released 1983.
The original was by Nintendo, and whats happened is your friend gorilla
has been caught by a guy called Mario. You have to get the keys in order
to remove the four chains and to free him.

The game looks and feels like the original. I'm sure I remember
something similar from my childhood, but I can't be sure. The graphics
are dodgy, even a ZX Spectrum could do better, but the game isn't meant
to be fancy. It's meant to be like the original. Which, I surpose it is.

The docs come in three languages, but don't give much explaination to
what you have to do. It even says "Be careful with the crocodiles, the
electric shocks, and the birds who attacks you", but to be honest, I can
just about reconise the birds, but the crocodiles, and electric shocks
are lost on me.

You control the little man using either the cursor keys and shift or the
joystick. I prefer keys as their easier to figure out what you are
doing, and the keys are similar to what the original would have been
like, which makes it more orthentic.

The worse thing about Donkey II is the sound. Gawd. The Amiga is capable
of much better things, but the author insists on the anoying beeps that
L.C.D. games produce. Yuk!

The game is let down by annoying sounds, and bad graphics. If I knew
what to do, in more detail I would be able to have a good game, but I
can't, because I don't know how to play it properly. And that doesn't
help lastability
