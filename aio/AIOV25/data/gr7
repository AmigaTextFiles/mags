This is is very simple shoot'em-up. You are in control of a kind of turret
in the middle of the screen, and lots of bad things shoot at you, and
you have to protect your base by shooting them down!

It's quite obvious the the authors primary language isn't English by
reading through the badly written docs. The docs did tell me how to use
super-bombs which kill everything on the screen. Now, wouldn't they be
usefull in real life? Unfortunately you don't get any points for using
them.

This is really a demo of the full game which is free. Once you get to
level 5 you suddenly die, and the high score table comes up. The
annoying bit is, you don't get told when you complete a level, it just
changes in the corner of the screen, and you know nothing about it.

The game hasn't got amazing graphics or sound...or playable or
lastability for that matter. It is short lived because it has 5 levels,
which can be completed in under 5 minutes.

If you wanted to try this game, I'd get the authors details from me, and
send him a postcard and you'll get the full version, I'm sure that has
many more levels!
