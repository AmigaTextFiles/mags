As per usual I'd like to firstly thankyou for downloading the latest
issue and welcome you to our humble abode. Alot of things have happened
this month so i'd like to talk about a few things before you rush
off to see the other gems in the magazine!
{p} {p}
Firstly and most importantly I'd like to welcome {bold}Lorens Johansson{nobold} who
is our newly appointed Utilities Editor. You may remember him from last
issue because he submitted a few reviews which in the end was the
deciding point on bringing him to our production. This, just his first
month in the Utilities position and already he has done more utilities
reviews than normally for the utilities section. I hope you enjoy
his reviews and enjoy what he has to tell you because I think he has
alot to offer us and our magazine and I hope you all welcome him to
our magazine.

It seems this month that I have caused quite a stir. I am not going to
go into full details about what happend but in short I was a little
annoyed about the review of AIO issue 22 in the latest issue of Amiga Format.
After reading this review I posted a little backup message about the
review to all of our registered readers and the AIO mailing list just to
be sure that we have the support to keep us open. It seems we have alot
of support and will continue to bring you our work. I have been told
by many that they also disagree with the review and to ignore AF on their
points but I want to make clear I only posted what would back-up my
points and nothing towards AF themselves.
{p} {p}
I was originally intending to publish the letters I received about my
message which basically everyone gave us encouragement and hope for
the future. Since I received an email which I do not want to discuss
from Ben Vost I have decided against it being the kind hearted person
I am :)
{p} {p}
I would like to thank everyone that wrote to me for taking the time to
support what we believe in and if you show your support to the Amiga
like you showed to AIO then I have every faith in the users that they
can make the Amiga succeed again.
{p} {p}
On a lighter note i'd like to say thankyou to a very nice chap called
{bold}Per Torp{nobold} who has at the start of June made a whole index
of everything ever to appear in AIO from issue one. It includes all
the titles to the games/utilities reviews, articles and news stories.
If you want a quick guide to finding a review you want then you can't
go far wrong with taking a look at Per Torp's AIO guide at :-

This month saw the opening of the AIOeditors mailing list. It is basically
a list for the important people who work on AIO, namely the editors,
GUI creator, webpage designer, gfx artists and the people who make the
music. The aim of this is to pool ideas between us to make AIO the best
free magazine available. With this I hope we can discuss some interesting
topics and have already started to exchange ideas, some of which you will
see in coming issues.

Two weeks ago the AIO webpage went belly up and decided to show about
2 months old pages. The fact that it wasn't allowing me into the FTP
server to change the page didn't help but now its fully fixed and
online again at, {bold}{link http://www.aio.co.uk}www.aio.co.uk{end}{nobold}.
{p} {p}
You may notice in some of the reviews this month that have received
over 90% (AIO gold) now have a nice picture to show they are AIO Golds.
If you have ever had a piece of software featured in AIO that has
received over 90% then you are free to use this logo on your website
or in future archives. You can obtain the GFX in .gif if you email me.

Next month we'll have a real treat for you which I think is a great
idea... possibly because I thought of it, but anyway. From next issue
when it gives an Aminet or FTP site name of the file, you will beable
to just click on the highlighted text next to the 'available from:' and
it will automatically download the file direct to your computer from
the Aminet. No need for any FTP software, as long as you are online it
will download the file, easy. I'd like to thank {bold}Ray Akey{nobold} for his
GetClient which will be used to download directly through the GUI and
also to our resident GUI guru {bold}Linus Akesson{nobold} for adding this
feature to his already wonderful AIO gui program! You will beable to
find out exactly how to work this next month when you will see it
in working order.
{p} {p}
I'd like to put out a quick greeting to the {bold}Amiga Group Enthusiasts{nobold}
in Fresno CA, U.S.A. who are doing a great job in keeping the Amiga
alive in that part of the world. I took a look at their club magazine
and i'm sure you may also like to take a look, so if your interested
or you want more details about the club contact Don Benson via email
at, {bold}dlbenson@psnw.com{nobold}

As a short piece of information I'd like to tell you that if an
article is very big it may not show if your workbench is in high
amounts of colours. In this case where once you have clicked the
article the display area stays white and the scroll bar goes small.
Then go and lower the amount of colours on your workbench to 8 or
less and then it {italic}should{noitalic} display.

This month I have some good news about another interview that you
could see as early as next issue. I was talking to {bold}Ben Rothwell{nobold} on
IRC very briefly the other week and have lined up an interview with
him. If you don't recognise the name then let me tell you he is part
of the FreeAmiga team which is bringing the famous web-browser
NetScape to the Amiga. So the reason I am telling you this is I want
your questions that I will ask him in the interview. Send your
questions to, {bold}chris@aio.co.uk{nobold}

If you have visited our website in the past few weeks you will notice
a new logo only at the top of the main page. Thanks to Hazy68 for this
excellent rendered spinning logo.

The last thing I would like to say is make sure you enter our 'Find
AIO an icon competition'. The idea is to make a new icon for AIO
and you could win a small prize. Check out the articles section for
more details.
{p} {p}
Well thankyou again for taking the time to read this issue and I hope
I will have the pleasure of your company next issue!
