BreakMan is a little util that makes it easy for you to break programs.
Instead of using the CLI commands Status and Break, you will have a MUI
interface with a list, a refresh list button and a Break button.

The installation is to copy it everywhere you want to, my suggestion is

Why anyone would want this instead of using the commands is a mystery, you
must be a real CLI hater to use this. This program isn't really bug free, it
produces one CyberGuard hit for every time it refreshes the list. For those
who don't know that a CyberGuard hit is (it's the same as Enforcer hits),
then let me explain it briefly: If a program produces a CyberGuard hit, then
it uses memory it hasn't allocated and this can lead to crashes!

What if there is something you don't understand, then the doc won't help you
much. It's 590 bytes in size, I guess that says it all!
