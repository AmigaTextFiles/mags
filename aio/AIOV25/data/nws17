A piece of news you maybe interested to hear is a new Commodore 64
or c64 internet computer is now available.

You may think that i'd gone completely mad but its true. I don't
know who makes it but I don't think Gateway have the rights to the
c64 and I suspect noone does so anyone is free to make c64 anything.

The basic setup is a c64 with 32mb memory. Graphics tablet instead
of mouse and lots of PC software installed. For some reason it comes
with things like Microsoft word and other basic Microsoft programs
which was a shock to me.

The idea of it is a TV internet box job. It allows you to get on the
web with no computer and just your TV. You can also play c64 games
but thats about all the c64 bit is.
