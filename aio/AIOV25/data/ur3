{subhead} AmigaAMP vs. AMPlifier{def}{p}

I am now going to test to see which MPEG Audio Layer 3 (MP3) file player
is the best to use.
{p} {p}
The first thing that came to mind when testing these is to see how CPU hungry
they are, I use the Top command from Executive in the tests!
{p} {p}
The test machine used:
Amiga 1200, Blizzard 060@50 MHz, 16MB Ram, AGA, IDE HD and DOpus 5.81.
{p} {p}
The MP3 file used for testing:{p}
Artist  : Antiloop{p}
Title   : In My Mind (Stoney's Ganstas 2000 Remix{p}
Album   : Remixed{p}
Size    : 6101787 bytes{p}
Length  : 06:21{p}
Bitrate : 128{p}
Format  : 44100Hz Stereo{p}
Emphasis: None

PlayBuf : 1/2s         1s{p}
TaskPri : 1            -
{p} {p}
AmigaAMP idle :  0.39% (No Skin)   AMPlifier idle:  0.00% (No Skin){p}
AmigaAMP idle :  4.42% (Skin)      AMPlifier idle:  1.44% (Skin){p}
AmigaAMP play : 71.52% (No Skin)   AMPlifier play: 73.61% (No Skin){p}
AmigaAMP play : 71.77% (Skin)      AMPlifier play: 76.53% (Skin){p}

When skin was used, it was the original skin for both AmigaAMP and AMPlifier
that I used. The spectrum analyzer was turned off when the tests where
performed in both AmigaAMP and AMPlifier.
{p} {p}
As you can see by these tests AmigaAMP uses a bit less CPU time when playing
MP3s, and both use very little CPU when they are idle. The reason for the
increase in CPU time usage when skin was used, is the text that is scrolled.
{p} {p}
Both programs have Playlists, and the playlists can do the same stuff to,
except for two details: AmigaAMP has a Shuffle mode, which AMPlifier doesn't
have, but AMPlifier has a clear button, which can be very nice sometimes.
{p} {p}
AmigaAMP has an EQ (equalizer), but you must have a PPC to be able to use it.
So I haven't been able to test this feature. For those who don't know, an
equalizer is used to control which Hz's to boost and so on...
{p} {p}
Both can, as stated before, use WinAMP skins, but AmigaAMP has a nice little
feature here, an animation in the lower right corner.
{p} {p}
When they are used without skins, they look like this:

{p} {p}
{image 25_AmigaAMP.iff}
{p} {p}
{center}AMPlifier:{left}
{image 25_AMPlifier.iff}
{p} {p}
As you can see, AMPlifier looks alot better than AmigaAMP, so if you run
your WB in 32 colours, then AMPlifier will be more appealing to the eye!
{p} {p}
So, which is the best then? That's very hard to say, AmigaAMP should be
better for those who have PPC (the equalizer), but on 68k machines it's very
hard to say. My advice to all of you who want a nice MP3 player, try them
both, they are worth it!

The versions used in the test is AmigaAMP 2.6 BETA 3 and AMPlifier 1.55.
