FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
{p} {p}
ImageFX 4 Announced - Now with Animation!
{p} {p}
Nova Design, Inc., creators of the award winning ImageFX package
and the highly received Aladdin 4D v5 package, are excited to
announce a brand new upgrade -ImageFX 4! ImageFX has been the
required graphics application for all Amiga owners and has been a
part of Video Toaster/Flyer owner's toolkits for years. Combining
painting, image file format conversion, image processing, and
special effects, ImageFX remains the undisputed leader in graphics
manipulation on the Amiga.
{p} {p}
Now in it's fourth major upgrade, ImageFX goes animated! If you
work on video using your Amiga or want to work on animations for
the Internet, the new animation controls in ImageFX are exactly
what you've been wishing for on your Amiga. The animation system is
as easy to use as the animation controls in Amiga paint packages
but far more powerful and support full color animation, palette
mapped animation and greyscale animations as well.

ImageFX 4 - the Animated Details
{p} {p}
Nova Design, Inc. has built on the new windowed interface
introduced in ImageFX 3.x and has added controls to directly
manipulate animations within ImageFX. Onscreen VCR-style controls
have been added to the layering system to allow you to move within
the frames of an animation or even playback the animation in your
preview window. Brushes can be animated across a series of frames
and effects can be automatically processed across frames as well!
{p} {p}
These controls make it easy to edit animations for use on the
Internet on your own web pages. You can create hand drawn
animations, brush animations and you can easily rotoscope video
sequences, add effects, and batch process. If you want to modify
web animations, it's as easy as loading now that you can load
animations. Full support for loading and saving entire or partial
FlyerClips is included for Amiga Toaster/Flyer owners.
{p} {p}
Many image processing functions and effects have been updated to
work directly on frames and layers now. And what would a new
upgrade of ImageFX be without new special effects? We don't know,
since we've never released without including new effects before and
we're not going to do so now.We've got some cool new effects in
this release, so read on!
{p} {p}
The new Fireworks effect can create amazing digital fireworks
displays on your images. The parameters for the effect are easily
animated. Fireworks uses a special-purpose particle system and can
even use custom brushes for the firework 'particles' so you can
create everything from a realistic firework burst to a shower of
coins!
{p} {p}
Distorter is the answer to a designer's dream. Similar to the 3D
Perspective Rotate function, Distorter can seemingly rotate your
image in three dimensions but with no constraints on how you move
and adjust the image.You can make it stretch out at any corner or
even twist it around itself. Amazing!
{p} {p}
Blob is a fun, if digitally slimy, effect. With Blob you can set
your parameters to make a translucent colored ooze slide down your
image.Looking to simulate the effect of slime? No problem with
Blob!
{p} {p}
The Text Generator has had so many improvements that it is like a
whole new module. You can now use Postscript(tm) fonts with it in
addition to Amiga bitmap, color, and outline fonts. You have more
control over the fonts.The fonts now can anti-alias for the best
possible display. Best of all you now see your fonts and text,
exactly as they'll appear, on the display of the image in it's own
window!
{p} {p}
CD the Light!
{p} {p}
ImageFX now comes on CDROM for it's standard distribution. If you
don't have a CDROM drive (and you should, they're pretty
inexpensive now) ImageFX will ship with a coupon to order a copy on
floppies. As a bonus the CDROM has sequences of images, animations,
and nearly the entire contents of our Internet site as well!
