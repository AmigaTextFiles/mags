If something can go wrong, it will!

We was fooled around by one (we won't tell which, but it is located
in Eastern Europe) CD production company. They constantly showing up
with some excuses and promise that the CDs will be finished tomorrow
(but tomorrow never comes).
Two weeks later we have lost our patience and redraw Wasted Dreams CD
materials and start looking for a new CD production partner. We've
found it in Germany. Now we can tell for sure that the release date for
Wasted Dreams will be on Monday 21st.
