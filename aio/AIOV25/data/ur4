As you probably understand from the name, JoyTester is a small util to test
if the joystick/joypad is working as it should.

You might wonder, why should I use this tool to test my joystick, when I
just can start a game and see if it works?{p}
Well, I don't have a good answer to that, but if you like to fill up your
SYS: partition with Yet Another Library then install this little util.

It can't test CD³² joypads, well, it can, but only the red button... Which
is lousy, since all serious gamers have one these days!?
{p} {p}
But, I must give it some credits, it has a small graphical interface :)

My conclusion is, that you won't really need this one, if you want to test
your joystick, then start your favourite game and play it... If the joystick
isn't working, you will soon know about it! :)
