Those of you who can remember issue 18 might remember a platform
romp [-ed TeeHee, ok i'll shut up ;)] called WiZiO, which was a
platform type game where you play the part of 'WiZiO the Wizard'
who roams the land collecting potions for power-ups to help him on
his way.
{p} {p}
Wiz 2 uses crude low-res graphics, but nothing fancy is required in this
2D platformer. All you have to do is navigate WiZiO through each level,
killing guards, and collecting various pick-up's that litter the levels.
{p} {p}
Unlike the original, special power-up's aren't just given to you, you
have to collect potions, and when your potion jar is full you drink the
contents and your power-up is enabled.
{p} {p}
You control WiZiO using the joystick, using fire to jump. I'm sure WiZiO
could just futher in the original!?
{p} {p}
As you progress through each level Wiz2's secrets are uncovered, and you
become more knowledgable about each level. You know what you have to do,
and it can be a chore, repeating things over and over, but you do learn
new secret each time you play.
{p} {p}
Wiz² is for 1 or 2 players, 2 player mode is new to version 2, each
player takes it in turns to play. Player 1 is a blue wizard, and player
2 and red wizard. You both try to get as far as possible, before you
loose all your lives. Unfortunately, when it's game over you dont get
told who won!
{p} {p}
The graphics have been slightly modified since the previous version. I
prefer the original graphics, the new graphics appear too pixelised for
my liking.
{p} {p}
Wiz² has many more bad things that its predecessor. Bad things I have seen
so far include rope bridges that collapse as you walk over them, arrows
that appear suddenly and try to stab you. But the worst is a little
bloke which stand there moving his staff up and down [-ed TeeHee, sorry i
couldn't resist it] , and it's almost impossible to get past him without
loosing at least one of your lives!
{p} {p}
Wiz² only has sound effects, the only part of the game to have any sort
of music is the title screen. Saying that, the title screen music is of
adequate quality, and so are the sound effects.
{p} {p}
Wiz² has 10 levels, and there are plans for a level editor. All I can do
is recommend that you download this. It's about 130K, and it's great
fun, until you complete the 10 levels....  . ..... ........ . .  . .   .
