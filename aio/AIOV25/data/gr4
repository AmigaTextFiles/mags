Review by Lee Hesselden

This is the second update of this extremly taxing puzzler written using
Acid Software's bug filled Blitz Basic. 
{p} {p}
You play the part of George, and for some reason you have to collect all
the diamonds from lots of different levels. The only problem is that
boulders and diamonds roll off surfaces that are not falt (including
each other). So if there is noting to support a boulder or diamond in
the air, then it will fall down, and squash you (if you are stupid
enough to get in the way).

The graphics are big, and simple, but the colours are randomised and
some are very displeasing to the eye. Saying that, despite the quality
of artwork, the graphic don't appear to be full of pixels, unless you
look very closely.
{p} {p}
There are lots of different bits and bobs in each level, which are to
hard to explain in this review. All I can say is read the instructions,
because they DO help you.
{p} {p}
The distribution also comes with a level editor to create your own
levels. It uses a {bold}HORRIBLE{nobold} low-res screen, which makes it look, well,
crap. But just because the level editor isn't fancy, doesn't mean the
game is crap as well.
{p} {p}
A good thing about George is that you can do the levels in almost any
order. This means you can solve the harder levels before going through
and completing the easier levels. To be honest, I found the first level
difficult.

You don't get loads of lives, so you often die. Which is good, because
it makes the game adictive. I can see myself loosing sleep when I
finally get the hang of things.
