Well, it appears that Amiga actually DOES know the meaning of the word
advertising, because they've started with some full page advertisements
for the OS 3.5 update in some of the major Amiga mags, and in more
languages than just English. Even with this single add, this latest
company has done more advertising than all the last few companies
combined (a sad fact).

Well, in an effort to help promote our favorite machine (or is it a
lifestyle?), below you'll find a reduced-size version of the full page
add (the American version, since that's where this author is from :) ).
My favorite part is that red circle in the lower right; it reads "Y2K
Compliant. A fact made amusing by the fact that the Amiga has always
been "Y2K Compliant" long before people realized there Was a year 2000
problem. (that's about like advertising that margarine is cholesterol
free)
