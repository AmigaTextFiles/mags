ML-Support is a nice little tool that makes it easy for you to (un)subscribe
to/from mailinglists. Much better than to keep the subscription-mails that the
MailingList admin send you, just setup the subscribe and unsubscribe command
in the settings, and remove the admin-mails!

It will currently only work with YAM, but it seems like it will support Thor
to in the near future, since it has a plugin system. The docs says this is
the final release, but it also says that it will support Thor also.

The installation is as simple as it can get. Start the install script, choose
your language, and where to put it. Done!

It's localized, and it has catalogs in Deutsch, Français and Italiano. So now
you will have something to do this summer if you speak another language then
the ones listed above! :)

When you start ML-Support you will see a window that has a list of all the
configured MLs. You can then choose from the following actions:{p}
Add, Clone, Edit, Remove, All, None.{p}
These is quite self explainable. Atleast I hope so! :){p}
Below there is a cycle that let's you choose from, subscribe, unsubscribe or
custom. And of course a Write button that will make the mail for you!

It's very simple to configure. It even comes with about 10 predefined ML's
and that is very good to have for reference when you are setting up a new ML!
The settings window looks like this:

The documentation is, as mentioned earlier, an AmigaGuide document. It's not
very long, but it covers what you need to know! It might be worth to mention
that the documentation is both in English and French!

This is a lifesaver for everyone that is on atleast one ML!
