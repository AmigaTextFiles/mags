Calculator is, as you should have figured out by now, a calculator.
{p} {p}
When you start Calculator, you will see this GUI:

{image 25_Calculator.IFF}
{p} {p}
As you see, it uses gadtools and it doesn't have alot of functions.
{p} {p}
You might now wonder why the button "." is shadowed, that's because it can't
handle decimals! When you divide 50 with 26, you should expect an answer that
is nearly 2, maybe 1.9 or something [-ed 1.923076923077 to be exact ;)]... But
with calculator the answer will be 1! Nice huh?!? :)
{p} {p}
You might also wonder if the programmer has ever seen a calculator before, I
think not! The reason: Look at the buttons 1-9, I think it's something that
isn't correct there! And also, isn't there a unwritten standard that the 0
key should be down to the left?

I wonder what the author thought, when he released this to Aminet. No
disrespect, I know how it is when you're just learning, but to release this
on Aminet!? Why? Noone wants it!

Well, the documentation might be better? Hrmm, not really. Ok, it's not the
worst I have seen, and it might be hard to write a 70kb doc to a program
like this.

Hmm, a calculator that might produce wrong answers, the layout is completely
wrong and it doesn't handle decimals... What can I say? Use the Calculator
supplied with WB, atleast it works!
