{subhead} AmiFTPd v1.8 Registered{def}{p}

I have gotten the priviledge to test AmiFTPd, a commercial FTP daemon for the
Amiga. An FTP daemon let's you setup an FTP site on your computer, which
let's users have access to the parts of your system that you choose for them!
{p} {p}
Well, let's begin with the installation. It doesn't come with any installer
script, but at this level of simplicity it's not needed at all.{p}
Just extract the archive to a dir where you want, but if you haven't
registered you have to rename the demo key. That's it.
{p} {p}
When you start it you will see the main window (if you use the demo you must
first fill in your name and organisation). The main window looks like this:

{p} {p}
As you see it uses BGUI, a GUI system for Amiga that is freeware. Well enough
about that.
{p} {p}
Now over to the configuration of AmiFTPd, which also is very simple.
In the general configuration you can set the name of your FTP, your mail,
your system and so on... The system configuration part isn't that good, the
best A1200 that you can choose is a 040, so everyone with a 060 will probably
just choose A1200 instead :({p}
You can also set which Welcome text and Login text that should be shown to
the users, and ofcourse how many people that can simultaneously login to your
FTP.
{p} {p}
After that you have to configure the different users, that is really simple.
Just choose a loginname for a user, set his password, the permissions (RWED)
and the credits/ratios. Really simple, especially if you have run a BBS
before. You can have how many different user accounts as you wish.
{p} {p}
The File System configuration is if possible even simpler. Choose a path and
set which Access levels that is needed, and which permissions that is in that
dir (RWED).
{p} {p}
There is however one problem, if there is something you don't understand then
you must direct your browser to their webpage since AmiFTPd doesn't come with
a documentation. So the best thing to do before installing AmiFTPd is to go
to their webpage and save the relevant webpages so you can check them
straight off your HD.
{p} {p}
Well, now that we covered how easy it is to install/setup, let's get over to
see how well it performs.
{p} {p}
First of all, the main window has a list of the users that is connected to
you. It shows which user it is, his IP and the last command that was sent
from him. What I really miss here is a logwindow, so you can sit and see
exactly what the user does, because it can be really hard to be fast enough
and see what happens in the Last Command field.
Well, there is a log list below the user list, but that doesn't cover very
much, only when a user connects/disconnects... Atleast there are no security
breaches as far as I can tell.
{p} {p}
One thing that I miss in AmiFTPd is that you can't find out your own IP, so
if you have a dynamic IP you must use a tool to find out what your IP is.
That's where a nice tool named AmiIPWatcher comes in. This nice little tool
shows your IP and HostName, so I recommend this to all of you who uses
AmiFTPd. (It has nothing to do with the fact that it's me that coded
AmiIPWatcher! :) ) You can get AmiIPWatcher from {link http://snorslex.amiga.tm}http://snorslex.amiga.tm{end}
{p} {p}
If you don't want a particular user to be connected, you can kick him out
from your computer, you can also kick everyone out by clicking one button,
good if you are going to go offline, or need to maintain AmiFTPd... If you
do this, it can be nice to tell the users that are logged in by sending
them a message... You can send to one or all of the users, but there is a
length limit of 255 characters.
{p} {p}
AmiFTPd handles Uploads/Downloads very well, apart from the resuming, which
doesn't work. This can however be a bug in my friends FTP program (AmFTP).
{p} {p}
Well, I guess I will have to come to a conclusion after all this nag :)
So, there isn't really any downsides of this program. It does what it is
supposed to do, and it does it really well. The only thing I have to complain
about is that it doesn't use MUI, but that's my taste... So, if you have ever
wanted to have an FTP daemon on your Amiga, then this is the program for the
job.
