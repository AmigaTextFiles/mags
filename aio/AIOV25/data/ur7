PNG-Box is a tool to convert nearly any image format into PNG! For those who
have been asleep since Commodore went broke, PNG is a successor to the GIF
format. The reason for this is that GIF uses some algorithms that are
patented, so it's illegal to use.
{p} {p}
So please, all of you who are doing WWW pages, use PNG instead of GIF.
{p} {p}
Well, over to the program :)
{p} {p}
First, the installation couldn't be simpler, just click the install icon,
and you will have it installed in a brief moment!
{p} {p}
It can convert {bold}ALOT{nobold} of different picture formats into PNG, namely 38
different, and then all that you have datatypes for!
{p} {p}
It has a nice GUI (GadTools) so it's easy to use and when you are converting
pictures, you can set a few options for the picture, which colour number that
should be transparance (if any) and the compression rate.
{p} {p}
A test:{p}
Original picture: GIF image that is 11811 bytes.{p}
Converted to PNG with full compression (no qualityloss): 10282 bytes
{p} {p}
You can also check some info on the picture, namely:
Copyright, Author, Annotation, GfxWidth, GfxHeight, Colour depth and
number of colours.
{p} {p}
So, for all of you that are making webpages, do yourself and others a favour
and use PNG pictures! And if your favourite GFX program doesn't support PNG,
then this is the tool for you. It's very fast and very reliable! It even has
PPC support (if you register it!).
{p} {p}
The documentation to PNG-Box is VERY good, it takes up all you want to know
about PNG-Box, why you should use it instead of GIF, some commercial of his
other programs and so on...
{p} {p}
There is however some things I miss. It would be nice if you could set the
colourdepth, so the pictures get even smaller. It would also be nice if
you could scale the pictures. Well, you can't have it all.
