SView ][ is a program that can display, convert and process any kind of
image format. It knows 38 different formats, and then it can use any
datatype you have installed on your system.
{p} {p}
It comes in 13 archives, the reason for this is so you can choose which parts
to install, 6 of the archives are a must, then the rest is optional.
{p} {p}
When the desired archives are unpacked, the installation can start. The
installation is quite easy. The only thing that you have to choose is where
to install, which GFX card/AGA/ECS you have and which language to install.
It comes with alot of different languages, 17 to be exact! But for some
reason, the installer installs all the catalogs, it doesn't care what you
choose! :(
{p} {p}
One good thing is that SView][ has special version for every 68k CPU and it
also has PPC versions. So it will suit every Amiga.
{p} {p}
Ah well... Let's move over to the actual program. When starting SView][ you
will see a GUI, it uses GadTools so it will be as fast as possible. You can
now perform whatever you want from here. First you must load a picture.
After that you can do whatever you want to do with that picture (that SView][
supports ofcourse). You can perform different Operators on the picture. But
many of them require a GFX card, so AGA owners can't use them all. I won't
go into deep details, but a few of the Operators are: Blur, Crop, Diffuse,
Emboss, ExtracBlue, ExtractGreen, ExtractRed, ExtractGrayScales, Rotate,
Sharpen, etc...  As you can see, you can do quite alot of things to your
pictures.
{p} {p}
After you are finished with the Operators you can save the picture to alot
of different image formats (38+datatypes). You can of course just use this to
convert pictures, or just to view them. You can also use SView][ to take
screengrabs of open screens, quite nice so you don't have to use another
program for that!
{p} {p}
SView][ can also be used to make icons, it has some save modules that let's
you save an image as Normal Icon, MagicWB or NewIcon.
{p} {p}
What if there is something you don't understand then, well just press the
HELP key and the Guide will pop up. The AmigaGuide documentation has a very
good layout, which makes it very easy for you to find exactly what you want
to find out. It takes up what every button does.
{p} {p}
SView][ has an ARexx port, and it comes with a couple of examples. If you
want to write some ARexx scripts by yourself, just go to the ARexx part and
you will find all the commands there. The ARexx part is {bold}very{nobold} brief, but you
understand what each command does anyway.
{p} {p}
If you just want to use SView][ as an picture viewer, then you have four
different executables to choose from, they are:{p}
CyberSlide, ScrollSlide, SuperSlide and WinSlide{p}
There are some differences between these programs. For example, SuperSlide
and Cyberslide just shows the picture on a new screen. SuperSlide is for
non GFX card users, and Cyberslide is for GFX card users.{p}
Then we also have ScrollSlide, which opens a new screen and shows the picture
in a resizeable WB window.{p}
And last, but not least, we have WinSlide, WinSlide shows the pictures in a
resizeable window on the WB screen.{p}
The last two works with both AGA and GFX card. So, with SView][, you will
have a great pictureviewer, perfect for DOpus/CLI.{p}
If you use DOpus 5.x, then why not setup in the filetypes to use one of the
above programs, I guarantee that you won't go back to Visage or (instert your
favourite picture viewer here)!
{p} {p}
SView][ also comes with alot of default icons for 20 different imageformats,
they look really nice. 
{p} {p}
If you are one of those people who enjoy to look at yourself, then you can
get a photo of yourself, scale it down to 50x50 (ofcourse with SView ][ :)
and put the picture in SView][:user.image. Now, whenever you bring up the
About window, that little picture of you will be there!
{p} {p}
You might now wonder why you should spend 30DEM on this program, if the main
program isn't enough (converting and process images), then think about the
great picture viewer that comes with it, it's faster than everything else that
you can find. So if this isn't enough for you to get this great software,
then you must ask to much for this cheap price!
