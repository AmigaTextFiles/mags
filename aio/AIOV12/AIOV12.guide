  Welcome, we're in p-a-r-t-y atmosfere here, as we have now been officially
running for 1 whole year, its been hard to get through and it's been alot
of hard work and effort but I think it's been worth it. We've got a jam
packed issue this time, with thousands or reviews, articles and everything.

  Still no news on anything really Amiga related, no hints at when we can
expect the new workbench or the new amiga, so we'll all sit back and take
it easy until they reviel the monster amiga that's to come!

  Wooow, one whole year in production, seems like a long time but it has
actually flown by and doesn't even seem that long ago since i first started
up AIO. The issues now are much better than the first issue and it looks
alot better to, with music and a picture at the start of the issue it is
more friendly looking. The actual guide is also more pleasent to read and
the layout it easier to use compared to the first couple of issues.

 I suppose your wondering why this issue is around 3 weeks late eh? Well
the main reason is because it is the biggest issue ever and it took ages
to put together. Another reasons was that this month must have been the
dryest month for utils/games and any news or articles to do so I had to
search far and hard to bring you the features and reviews in the issue.
Oh well never mind maybe there'll be more exciting news next month!

 A bit of of a sad state of affairs is Psygnosis, I was in contact with
them just before Christmas '97 asking them if it was possible to interview
them for AIO regarding the Amiga and would they consider comming back
to it now the PPC and various well known games have been released for it
etc. The person I was in contact with agreed to the interview but now
after 4 months of continues emails to him he fails to reply, if you would
like to pester him about an interview for AIO then email him at :
@{b}Paul.Hanley@psygnosis.co.uk@{ub}  -  and ask why he will not give an interview
for AIO, please pester him about this if you can as I would really like
to know and alot of readers would probably like to know the answers to
some of those questions, mention how he can get in contact with me via
email.

 A good article to check out this month is the work-in-progress about
the game Domination by the Amiga1 team, it gives you in full details the
problems they have had to overcome and where they are upto with the
game, i'll look forwards to receiving the next parts.

 Well thats all I have to say for this month, next issue will be released
a bit later than the usual 'saturday nearest to the 20th' date because this
issue was released so late but it will get back on track very soon. Hope
you liked this issue and I will look fowards to you reading next issue!
 
 If @{B}Pom Lekey@{ub} sysop of Jipebo BBS in Sweden is reading please get in touch

NEW SIGNING
-----------

Vulcan Software Limited is proud to announce the signing of the
development team Black Flag from Portugal along with their 30 million
year old master piece CAVEMAN SPECIES for the Amiga CDRom & PC CDRom
platforms. 

All at Vulcan are honoured to have them aboard!


CAVEMAN SPECIES
---------------
A small planet in our universe bares witness to the emergence of
intelligent life! In this evolutionary rage of power, the weaker will
not stand against the breed who shall inherit the land of the caveman
species...

Caveman Species is a real-time strategy war game set in a world
comprising of 3 continents that enclose over 90 playable locations.

Each location features it's own unique storyline that creates an ever
evolving and intriuging plot.

The players goals will be different for each location and can include,
wiping out the enemy tribes, reaching a certain level of tribe progress
or perhaps discovering ancient cities or finding lost tribes.

Special features allow tribes to interact with elements like, witches
with magical powers `who can weaken the enemy in battle or turn them
into frogs` or visit Stonehenge to invoke the gods `who can fill your
enemy with the plague` or kidnap dinossaur eggs for breeding or
ultimately hunt the infamouse T-Rex, train it, then ride on it`s back
into battle to tear your enemy apart with one single bite!

@node "gr1" "Croins Vs WBsteriods"

@{fg shine} Croins Vs WBsteriods@{fg text}

 Croins and WBsteriods are two totally different games, although they are
based around the classic Asteriods, each of them has there own little extra
features.

 WBsteriods is the classic graphics in a Workbench window version, the 
graphics are very basic, and the colour are limited according to your 
Workbench set up (or by default, 4 colours!) As I said in issue 10 it slows
down on the later levels because there are loads of asteriods on the screen
at once, this really makes the gameplay a load of rubbish, but if you have 
an expanded computer, Fast RAM extra (unlike me) it should be fine, (Is 
this try Ed?). The best part in WBsteriods is when you fire, instead of a 
naff ball firing (Like in Croins) you get a line comming out, and as it 
moves you get a kind of shadow effect with the white line changing colour 
to red and gradually getting fainter.

 Croins, in my opinion is the better version, it is an adapted version of 
the classic asteriods and with the authors own graphics, music and several 
options, it is the choise for the average games player, unless you are a 
mega classics fan (like the Ed?!!?!)[-ed I hate clasics, stop saying this!]. 
The really nice thing about Croins is that you can disable the annoying 
Hyper-Space option, this is really handy as when I move I think pressing 
DOWN will slow me down but I end up in hyper-space and somewhere else on 
the screen! The graphics are great, there nothing like those seen in 
WBsteriods!

 Unless you are looking for the classic Asteriods, in which case you 
should buy a Commodore 64, get Croins, the graphics are better, the 
gameplay fernominable, and great lastability!

@node "gr2" "Air Fight"

@{fg shine} Air Fight@{fg text}

 This is a simple shoot-the-plane game for one or two players. The author 
recommends 2-players because algorithm for computer plane is very simple, 
so is relative easy to shoot him down. (Well, thats what the author said)

 The game is based on `Super Dogfight' which first appeared on the C64. It 
has a host load of options, including collision detection and amount 
of hit points each plane has.

 Another option is what background and screen res you want, the standard 
background is easiest to play on, the other two, cheese, and clouds are 
really difficult as there are only a few places that you can actually see 
your plane, because either the cheese of cloud are blocking your view. The 
screen res is an intresting option, when you press FIRE to play you have to
wait for a while, you are not told why, there is no disk activity so I 
don`t know whats going on, anyway, the more pixels you have on your screen 
the longer you have to wait, and the planes are smaller, giving you more 
space to fly, but i`d stick with the low res if I was you.

 The game itself is rather playable, the idea is to shoot down the other 
plane, you do this by pressing fire and hope it hits. The computer player 
is not that good, it just spins around and fires every now and again. The 
authors right to recommend 2 players! The only trouble I had, is when a 
plane gets hit, the game pauses for a bit, and if the other plane keeps 
firing there is no where to go and you`ll die really quickly!

 Overall this is a simple game, the sounds are simple, the gameplay easy, 
but, to be honest it won`t last you that long.

@node "gr3" "CANE Demo"

@{fg shine} CANE Demo@{fg text}

 C.A.N.E stands for Cargo And Nothing Else, the idea is to collect the 
various cargo littered around each level. There are also some little 
`Dudes' which you MUST collect to complete the level.

 This is a two level demo, the full version is not available, due to lack 
of interest, but these levels will take you ages to complete (Well, I 
haven`t completed the first level yet!).

 The levels are two screens big, and when your triangular ship gets near 
the top they scroll which gives the game that really cool look, and lets 
you know this is not your average P.D game.

 To pick up a `dude' or some cargo you mist land on top of it and have your
nose pointing up, this is really difficult especially in water as the 
gravity pulls you up, its easier in the sky as gravity pulls you down. When
you have collected your cargo you must deposit it in your teleporter (where
you start)

 The game is really difficult, if you drop the dude in the water he dies 
and you can`t complete the level! You also have to use bomb and collect 
diving gear to be able to collect some of the cargo!

 This is a brilliant game, if you download this, and like it, perhaps you 
could E-Mail the author and make him continue developing this brilliant 
game. If not, it is a shame this is going to be discontinued.

@node "gr4" "ProGammon"

@{fg shine} ProGammon@{fg text}

 ProGammon is a Back Gammon game for 1 player, who plays against the 
intellegent computer, the author claims that his ProGammon has the most 
intellegent computer player, and he has thought of everything, he has even 
tested the random dice rolls just to check the computer can`t cheat, and 
hes but the C source in the Amiga Guide documentation!

 The game opens its own screen, and personally I think the palette colours 
are horrible (Look at the screenshot), but thank the heavens, you can 
change the colours by clicking on Palette in the pull-down menus!

 The instructions in the Amiga Guide, and not that clear for the beginner, 
like me, i`ve never played Back Gammon and I didn`t have a clue how to 
play it, so when I atempted to have a game, I did not get anywhere!

 A nice feature in this game is that it keeps a log of all your scores, so 
you can see how many times you beat or lose against the computer, the 
author claims there is a 50/50 possibility of winning, even Stevens' then.

 I can`t really say that much about this game, it is surposed to play a 
good game of Back Gammon with you, but as I can`t play it, I can`t tell 
you if this is true, because I can`t play it!

 This game is not for the beginner, if you are an expert Back Gammon 
player get this and see if you can beat the computer!

@node "gr5" "Shootist"

@{fg shine} Shootist@{fg text}

 In Shootist you must shoot at these people wo are in different buildings, 
the characters are nothing special, but the gameplay is very good.

 Each level is split into two stages, in the first stages you have to shoot
the men in the buildings, the first level, for example, is set in the Wild 
West, and you have to shoot the bad guys while avoiding the sherifs who 
wear badges. The second stage on the first level involves you shooting 
butterflies of different colours, if your pointer goes on top of a 
butterfly which isn`t the right colour you loose strength.

 This all sounds simple, but you get 30 ammo units, and the ammo re-filles 
don`t fall down that often. You also get so much strength, and if the men 
shoot at you so many times your dead!

 You also get to decide your skill level, SLOW, is easy, and the shareware 
demo is completed in no time, NORMAL is fairly challenging, but again is 
easy, the hardest is the HARD level, the men move very fast, and you can 
rarly hit them!

 The only thing I don`t particually like about this one is the dark colours
in the palette, they look horrible, but give the game more of an eary look.

 This is a shareware demo, the author would like US$5.00 for the full 
version, I think that is too much, you only get the first level in the 
demo, and in the docs it says there are only four levels anyway! The full 
game should be FREEWARE!

@node "gr6" "Lazer"

@{fg shine} Lazer@{fg text}

 The idea behind Lazer is to bounce a laser around the screen and to hit a 
target. To aid you in doing this you are provided some mirrors. There are 
11 mirrors available for all the levels. Obviously you can`t use more than 
11 mirrors but you can use less. The mirrors alos, only reflect on one 
side.

 You are timed and author tells us the levels can be completed! (Yea, 
right!). The first few levels are easy, then you get onto a level where the
lazer will only travel in one direction!

 Lazer is really hard, when you think you`ve done it the computer moves or 
rotates a mirror and you time runs out. Time is tight and the computer is 
really frustrating!

 The sounds in this game are the best i`ve heard in a long time, they 
really make you want to laugh sometimes!

 The game plays well, the lastability end-less, this is all most as good as
Final Odyssey!! I definatly what to see more of effots from this author!

@{fg shine} Boum@{fg text}

 Boum is your standard MineSweeper clone. The object is to find out the 
locations of all the mines in the mine field, when you click somewhere you 
are either killed by a mine, you uncover some uneffected ground, or you get
a number telling you how many mines are around that spot, its all chance 
from here!

 There is not special about this game, you can select between three skill 
levels, and 3 grid sizes (The one in the screenshot is `Big').

 What I really like about this game is the sounds, the explosion is cool, 
the others are rather simple, but it really inhanses the gameplay.

 Overall, this is a fairly average effot, I have seen better, but this is 
worth the time downloading just to mess about on every now and again when 
you are bored!

@node "gr8" "Football Simulation"

@{fg shine} The Footy Game@{fg text}

 The Footy Game is a football simulator, it loads on your Workbench screen 
and you select the names of two teams, and then you select three strickers.
You can also click on the TEAM A or TEAM B buttons and scroll through the 
database of Premier League teams!

 When you click on play to get the main screen. Now, in a Footy Game you 
would expect a few players, a goal, and a ball, you get none of this in 
this game, it is texted based!

 Each game lasts 90 seconds and time is held at half time which occurs 
after 45 seconds. Every now and again some writing will appear informing 
you what is going on, you either get shots at goal, or you get players 
injured! Not much help.

 Something nice about the game is the front-end. The windows look nice, and
are well presented. Its just a shame the game isn`t the same.

 In the end this game is not that good, there are no graphics, and the best
bit in the game is the clock hand which rotates! There is no point to this 
game, the only use I can think of, is to amuse you while you are waiting 
for a disk to copy of something!

[-ed... Maybe the author of this game should also do some research as i
don't remember Dennis Berkham playing for Arsenal :)]

@{fg shine} NeverMind@{fg text}

 I was going to review this in the last issue, but due to disk problems I 
wasn`t able to, so I downloaded this off the Aminet, and it is still in the
Recent uploads!

 The idea is to reach the exit by avoiding all the mines in the mine field,
which is the screen around you. When you move you are told how many mines 
are around you. If you uncover a ? square, which could have bomb underneith
them you gain points, but when you move back over a square you have 
already uncovered you lose some points!

 The game is quite hard, even in beginner mode! I have only actually 
completed it once in about 30 odd games!

 There are several options, first off is your skill level, from beginner to
expert, then theres your screenmode, theres not really much point to this, 
a low res screen is the best as it actually fills up the screen, the others
leave half the screen (or more) black! The next option is music, it 
defaults to on, ut if you don`t have medplayer.library in your LIBS: 
partion clicking on this will causes the program to crash! Thelast option 
is the graphics you want, you can have space, sea, or even MagicWB tiles, 
it doesn`t matter which you choose, but when I used some of the the game 
didn`t work properly, you removed a tile and a mine would appear but 
wouldn`t set off!

 The game is very playable and will last you for quite a long time, 
providing it does not fµ@& up.

@node "gr10" "Bloog"

@{fg shine} Bloog@{fg text}

 Bloog was out doing his morning walk, when he all of a sudden 
caught sight of a tower, almost touching the clouds with its peek. He 
walked towards the building and noticed a sign, saying: "This is a deserted
Maze.  Do  NOT  enter!" Bloog, whose brain wasn't more evolved than a PC,
wrecked the sign and opened the tower's door. He stepped in, and the door
slammed behind him. He was locked inside.

 You monitor Bloog and has got to help him through a load of maze-floors  
to  get  to  the top - from where Bloog can easily jump down to the ground 
outside. That Bloog is a green blob with big eyes and equaly large feet, 
a mouth and no arms.

 Bloog comes from the same group of people as C.A.N.E, the idea behind this
one is to find a set of keys. Sometimes, keys can be on the floor when  
you enter a level. Most keys though, are hidden inside colored blocks. If 
you smack two blocks together, and if they are the same colour, both 
blocks will disappear and a key will pop up. But if the blocks are  
different colours, the one being hit will be destroyed while the otherone 
remains intact. Blocks can also be painted with another colour!

 This is only a demo, but the full version is FREE! The author doesn`t 
think it is that good, but this is brilliant! The limitations are as 
follows:

 · No intro and end-of-game animations.
 · You can't save the hiscores.
 · The game doesn't accept more than 10 levels
 · Only one piece of ingame-music

 These limitations don`t really make any difference to the gameplay, it is 
simply brilliant, some of the puzzles take ages to work out, and with all 
the special objects you can collect and use to your advantage, this game 
will keep you on the edge of your seat, at least until you finish the 8th 
level, (the last one). But then, there is more, there is a Bloog level 
editor which allows you and your mates to make even more levels!!!!!

 If you haven`t guessed already, I really like this game, I think you will 
too, just download the demo, and the full version is free, what are you 
waiting for?? Well, read the rest of the mag first!

@node "Cheat" "Cheats and tips"

@{fg shine} Complete solution to Simon The Sorceror@{fg text}

  1. You begin the game in Calypso's cottage, so walk up to the drawer and
     open it. You'll find a pair of scissors. Next, walk over to the fridge
     and pick up the magnet. Leave the house and head towards the village.

  2. Pick up the rope outside the Blacksmith's shop (it's near the barrel)
     and the bell clapper (on the banch near the door).

  3. Walk behind the shop and head for 'The Drunken Druid'. Inside, you'll
     find a box of matches on top of the fruit machine, so pick them up.
     Then walk over to the dwarf and cut off his beard with the scissors.
     Engage the nubile valkyries in conversation and then walk across to
     the adjoining room.

  4. Talk to the wizard's about becoming one yourself. If you're persistent
     they'll send you off on a quest to find a crystall staff. Leave the
     pub, and head off to the left.

  5. Continue walking left past 'The Shoppe'.

  6. Outside the village gates follow the path to the right.

  7. Keep going right.

  8. Offer to help the whingeing Barbarian by pulling the thorn out of his
     foot, and in exchange he'll give you a blocked whistle. Take the road
     going up.

  9. At the juction turn right.

 10. Walk past the owl. It will wake up and call you over for a chat, but
     don't get too involved in a conversation because it talks rubbish!
     The only useful purpose that the owl serves is dropping one of it's
     feathers, so don't forget to pick it up before heading off to the
     right.

 11. Continue walking to the right.

 12. At the five-pointed crossroads, take the first exit to the right
     (going down).

 13. Head on left past the spot where the Barbarian had been crying.

 14. Turn off at the junction, heading down.

 15. Continue walking right, past the fallen white tree.

 16. At the junction turn right and head down.

 17. Continue walking left.

 18. Outside the witch's cottage turn the well handle to raise a bucket
     of water, and pick it up. Back track up the path the way you came
     from. At the junction turn right.

 19. As you walk past the tree stump, the woodworms will start talking to
     you. They will send you on a sub-quest to find some wood. This is one
     of the funniest scenes in the game. Head off to the right.

 20. Continue walking right until you find a path cross a bridge blocked
     by a Troll taking industrial action.

 21. Keep him talking until he notices the whistle round your neck. Offer
     it to him for him to blow it, and watch the look of horror on his
     face as the Barbarian jumps out of nowhere to kick the ungrateful Troll
     into the river. You can now safely cross over the bridge.

 22. At the Y-junction take the upper road and continue right, crossing
     another stone bridge.

 23. Talk to the idiot sitting by the tree. Use the bucket of water from
     the well to soak his beans. Simon will then exit right. Make him go
     back to pick up the beans from the puddle.

 24. Use the map facility to return to where you met the owl. From there
     head right. You'll come to the star-shaped crossroads again. Take the
     path heading towards the top right.

 25. You'll come across an excavation site. Have a word with the
     ostentatious paleontologist digging in the hole. Continue heading up
     the road.

 26. You are now in the centre of the forest. Pick up the stone next to
     the dwarf mine and examine it, as it contains a password. Take the
     first set of steps leading above the mine.

 27. Pick up the piece of paper near the big doors and examine it (it's a
     shopping list). Go back to the entrance of the mine and follow the
     road to the right.

 28. Converse with the miserable wood-cutter until he shows you his metal
     detector. Ask to borrow it.

 29. Use the map to get you over to the crossroads. Once there, take the
     path leading down the right-hand corner.

 30. Join the clapper you took from the Blacksmith's bench with the bell,
     and ring it. The maiden will cast her pony-tail out, Rapunzel-style,
     so use her hair as a rope to climb up the tower.

 31. After the maiden has transformed, pick up the piglet and return to
     the village. Head up the little alleyway next to 'The Shoppe'.

 32. Don't get to involved with the dodgy geezer, as at this stage he's
     of little use to you. Walk past him to the other side.

 33. Pick up the ladder which is leaning against the wall. Walk inside the
     Druid's cottage.

 34. Inside you'll find some cold remedy and a specimen jar. Pick them up.
     Cross over to the left once you leave the cottage.

 35. Use the little piglet to eat its way through the chocolate truffle
     door, and enter.

 36. Pick up the smoke box and hat and go back out.

 37. Walk round to the beehive and use the matches to light the smoke box.
     When activity within the apiary has ceased you can swipe some nice
     wax. Now go back to Calypso's cottage and walk round to the back yard.

 38. Plant the beans taken from the idle idiot who you encountered earlier
     in the magic compost, and pick up the water melon that grows there.
     Go to the pub.

 39. Ask the barman for a drink, and while he stoops down to look for it,
     use the wax to block the tap of the barrel behind the bar. The barman
     will give you a beer voucher as compensation for not having your drink
     in stock. Leave the pub.

 40. Pick up the defective beer barrel left outside by the publican.

 41. Go to the dwarf mine. Put on the beard and go in, giving the password
     you found on the stone outside the mine.

 42. Make as if to walk past the sleeping guard. The accountant sitting at
     the table will wake him. You'll be challenged by the guard, so bribe
     him with the one thing that dwarves have effection for (other than
     snow white!) - beer. He'll take you and the beer barrel down with him
     into the cellar.

 43. Once there, use the owl feather to tickle the snoring dwarf's smelly
     feet. He'll keel over, revealing a key. Pick it up and go back
     upstairs.

 44. Go down the stairs where the guard stopped you. The accountant will
     scream blue murder, but there's nothing he can do to stop you, so you
     can afford a self-righteous smile as you walk past his bemused face.

 45. Unlock the safe door with the key.

 46. Offer the beer voucher to the dwarf inside. He'll reward you with a
     gem before unceremoniously turning you out. Don't forget to pick up
     the hook under the safe door.

 47. Use the map to get to the owl tree. Follow the path going right to the
     five-pointed crossroads, and head straight on, going the way that
     Simon is facing.

 48. You'll come across a noisy busker playing his musical instrument
     rather badly. Launch the water melon at his organ, which will soon
     come into your possession.

 49. Journey to the centre of the forest using your map, and go up the
     stairs on the right.

 50. Go into the cave and follow the stone path. Cross the swamp and walk
     past the statues. When you reach the sleeping giant, use the
     sousaphone to stir him from his deep sleep. He'll unwillingly knock
     down a tree, providing you with an improvised bridge. Get across and
     enter the dragon's cave for an amusing encounter. Return to the
     village.

 51. Walk up the little alley next to 'The Shoppe' and sell your gem to the
     dodgy geezer for twenty gold pieces. Backtrack to the shop when the
     transaction has been completed.

 52. Hand over the shopping list to the shop keeper. Whilst there, you may
     as well buy some white spirit and a hammer, with which you will
     recieve a complimentary free nail (no expense spared, eh?). Venture
     back to the swamp. Walk up to the house and knock on the door.

 53. Unfortunately, you now have to consume the stew - indeed, you'll have
     to eat a second bowl of the vile stuff. When the demented swampling
     serves you with a third bowl, however, empty its maggot-infested
     contents into the specimen jar. The swampling will obsessively try to
     serve you more of its evil concoction, but will mercifully find an
     empty cauldron. It will then head off out of the house with its little
     net to fish some gunge out of the local sewer, no doubt. Take this
     opportunity to reward the swampling's hospitality by snooping around
     its home. Move the wooden chest. Open the trapdoor beneath and climb
     down the ladder.

 54. Hammer the nail on the loose plank, and walk across to Skull Island.
     Pick up the frogsbane and use the map to get to the dragon's cave.

 55. Use the cold remedy on the dragon to help him rest. Cast the hook at
     the boulder on top of the cave's entrance and climb up. Tie the
     magnet to the rope, and lower it down the hole to gain some gold
     coins. Climb down.

 56. Walk to the right behind the cave, and continue until you come across
     some climbing pins with a gap. Forget about them - just jump across
     the icy ledge beneath. You'll eventually come across an old tree.
     Talk to it, then use the white spirit to get rid of the pink splodge
     on its bark. If you speak with the tree again you'll get some nagic
     words from it. Backtrack through the snow to the gargantuan face
     etched into the rock. Pick up the smaller rock scattered nearby. Go
     back inside the dragon's cave and pick up the fire extinguisher. Goto
     the place where the giant is sleeping, and head to the left.

 57. When you reach the statue of the wizard, get out the metal detector
     and find the milrith.

 58. Goto the Blacksmith and place a rock upon his anvil. He'll break it
     up, revealing a fossil within.

 59. Use the map to get to the centre of the forest, and take the left
     footpath to the excavations. Throw the fossil down to the digger.
     When he asks you where you found it, tell him 'Craggy Peaks', and
     he'll accommodate you by providing cheap labour.

 60. Get yourself to Craggy Peaks, where you left the metal detector. Dr.
     Jones has wasted no time on his new excavations. If you examine the
     dirt you'll find the milrith ore. Next, it's time to visit the wood-
     cutter again.

 61. Tell him the good news. He, in turn, will send you to the Blacksmith.

 62. As you did with the rock earlier on, place the milrith on the anvil
     and the Balcksmith will shape it into an axe-head. Take the finished
     product to the wood-cutter.

 63. The wood-cutter will take the axe and leave without shutting the door
     to his house, so why not reward his faith in humanity by breaking in?

 64. Inside his cottage you'll find a climbing pin on the table. Feel free
     to take it. Next, put out the fire with the fire extinguisher. Move
     the hook in the fireplace to go down into the basement.

 65. Help yourself to some mahogany and take it to the starving woodworms.
     They'll jump into your hat. Use your map to get to the crossroads.
     Take the path at the bottom right corner.

 66. Climb up the tower where you rescued the maiden and the pig ealier on.
     Unleash the woodworms onto the floorboards to get you onto ground
     level.

 67. Pick up the wedge securing the entrance door and then use the ladder
     to climb down into the basement.

 68. Open up the sarcophagus. You have to be quick with the next operation
     other wise Simon will get cold feet and run off, leaving you to try
     again. Search out the loose bandage with the mouse pointer, and use
     the 'pick-up' command with it in order to take care of the mummy.
     Pick up the crystal staff and take it to the four wizards with whom
     you spoke in the pub.

 69. The wizards will greedily ask you also to pay a registration fee of
     thirty gold pieces. If you haven't got enough money, then venture
     back to the top of the dragon's cave to fish out some more using the
     magnet. You should end up with forty-one gold pieces altogether.
     Give the wizards their money, and they'll give you a wizard's starter
     pack. Take special note of the allegory with modern-day banking
     institutions.

 70. Use the map to get to the crossroads, and take the little alley
     heading up to the right. When you reach the waterfall, search around
     the bottom left-hand corner where you'll find a vine. Use it to climb
     down.

 71. At the bottom you'll find a Gollum impersonator angling. Swap the
     swamp stew for the fishing rod to find the ring. Goto the village.

 72. The shop-keeper has finished the order, so climb into the cardboard
     box outside the shop.

 73. When you arrive at your destination, open up the box and climb out.
     If you search around the empty boxes you'll find your spell book.
     Inside the book you'll discover a loose piece of paper. Search with
     the mouse pointer between the boxes and the door to find a rat bone.
     Slide the piece of paper underneath the door, then use the rat bone
     to push the key off the lock on the other side so that it will fall
     on the paper. Pull back the piece of paper with the key on it to
     unlock the door. Open it and get out of the stockroom.

 74. Pick up the metal bucket with the hole in it outside the cells, and
     descend down the stairs.

 75. Pick up the mints near the dungeon window. Chat with the Druid who's
     tied up on the rack. After a while he will ignore you and refuse to
     talk any further. Take off the ring of invisibility and resume the
     conversation. He will put you through a test to make sure that you're
     not evil. Pick up the flaming brand next to the sharp objects. Place
     the metal bucket on the Druid's head. Use the flaming brand on the
     bucket to turn the Druid into a frog. Open up the Iron maiden, and
     hide in there for a few days until the frog returns with a hacksaw.
     Use it to cut through the bars so you can escape. Goto the Druid's
     cottage (where you picked up the cold remedy).

 76. The Druid will give you a magic potion in exchange for the frogsbane
     found on Skull Island. Goto the witch's cottage.

 77. Pick up the broom to conjure up the witch. Take up the hag's challenge
     to a duel. Use the words given to you by the talking tree. If you lose
     (the battle is a form of scissors, paper, stone, using spells and
     counter-spells) just keep going back until you win. Take the broom-
     stick as your reward. The witch will metamorphose into a slovenly
     dragon. All you have to do is say 'Abracadabra' to turn yourself into
     a tiny mouse. Make your escape through the mouse-hole along the edge
     of the top wall.

 78. Climb up the snowy mountains until you reach the ferocious snowman.
     Use the extra-strong mints to melt him to oblivion. Continue your
     upward climb.

 79. When you reach the castle, use the broomstick to get to the door.
     Drink up the Druid's potion and you'll shrink small enough to creep
     in through the bottom.

 80. Pick up the leafin the garden. Walk inside the rusty old bucket. If
     you look around you'll find a match, and outside, near the bucket,
     you'll also find a stone. Carry on walking left.

 81. Use the dog hair to lasso onto the tap, then pick up the leaf floating
     on the pond and bring it ashore. Use the matchstick as a mast and the
     other leaf as a sail to make an improvised boat. Pick up some seeds
     from the red pots next to the tap and bring them back. Use the stone
     to pulp the seeds into an oil which you can use to lubricate the
     jammed tap. Pull the hair to open the pub, and get on the boat to
     cross the nowirrigated puddle.

 82. You'll be confronted by a large frog on your arrival. Look in the
     water, however, and you'll find a little tadpole. Pick it up and use
     it as a hostage to negotiate peace terms with the amphibian menace.
     When the frog flees you'll find some yellow mushrooms. Eat one to
     return to your normal size.

 83. Pick a branch off the tree and open the door. The wooden chest inside
     will spring to life and chase you out. Go back and use the branch to
     jam its lethal jaws. Pick up the spear from the rack and the shield
     from by the stairs. Go on up.

 84. Pick up the magic wand on the dresser, the green sack next to the bed,
     the blue money-pouch on the bed and the book on the pink pillow at the
     right. Read the book. Speak to the mirror, then go upstairs to the
     second floor.

 85. Pick up the chemicals on the bench in the middle of the lab, then walk
     round to the bookcase and pick up Sordid's spell book. Use the
     chemicals to renew the shine on the shield, and hang the shield on the
     hook protruding from the front of the bench. See what bits of inform-
     -ation you can extract from the lower-class demons, and go down the
     stairs.

 86. Talk the mirror into spying on the demons upstairs for you so that you
     can find out their real names. Go downstairs all the way to the
     dungeon in the basement.

 87. Using the spear, knock off the skull hanging ceiling and pick it up
     from the floor. Walk over to the other side of the dungeon and pick up
     the chest. Return and pull the lever on the crushing machine next to
     the footbridge. Place the chest on the block and push the lever. Pull
     the lever to raise the block up again. You'll find the candles you
     need for your demonic incantation amongst the ruins. Go upstairs to
     the bedroom with the mirror.

 88. Look down at the side of the staircase to find a small mouse-hole.
     Put the cheesy green sock inside the blue pouch, and use it to coax
     the mouse out of its dwelling, and consequently entrapping it. Go
     upstairs for a chat with the demons.

 89. If you help the demons return to their dimension, they will assist
     you with the teleporter. They will give you the chalk with which to
     draw the square on the floor. When you've exorcised them, walk over
     to the teleporter and use it to get to the 'Fiery Pits of Rondor'.

 90. When you materialize, search around with the mouse pointer until you
     find a pebble nearby. Pick it up. To your left is a small sapling.
     Pick it up. Talk to the attendant and he'll give you some brochures.
     Look at the brochures to find an elastic band. Use the band together
     with the sapling to create a catapult. Fire the pebble at the red bell
     to get rid of the pesky attendant. Pick up the souvenir matches at the
     corner of the stall and head for the pits.

 91. Cross the bridge, picking up the bucket of floor wax, and head for the
     fiery pits.

 92. Use the magic wand on Sordid to let him taste some of his own
     medicine. Light up the fiery pits with the matches. Cast the wand
     into the flames to return the statues to life. Sordid will attack you,
     but you'll survive, so go back and use the floor wax on him. If you
     don't succeed, try again until he falls over, then kick him into the
     pit.

There are 16 tiles here, dont pay any attention to any markings
or anything, Just hit the first tile and then the second (see what
i mean by the diagram)

O= TILES                             OOOO
*= THE FIRST TILE TO MOVE            OOOO     <- Thats the Diagram :)
@= THE SECOND TILE TO MOVE           OO@O
                                     O*OO

Just move the  * tile first, Then move the @ Tile
I Hope you can figure that out, I Dont know how to explain
it any easier than that

Once done the puzzle
Enter the next room
The temple guardian pops up again
She wants proof that your king (even know your not)
Give the guardian the crown you found in the sarcophagus
A Door will open
Pick up the crystal skull
Go back to the altar room
Go to the altar
There are two panels there
Move the right panel first
Then move the left panel
A chair will come down from the ceiling
Use the chair

FLODA PRISON CELL
-----------------
Once done talking with frank
Pick up the mug on the bench
Use the mug on the cell door
Anderson and Faye will come and get you out
Exit the building

TRADER BOB'S
------------
Buy the alcohol using the dead guards id
Read the torn up paper (jetpack plans)
Read the comic book, pages will fall out
Use the comic pages with the wet comic coupon
Read the blueprints
Use the alcohol in the jetpack
Go to the pinnicle
Use the jet pack

MIST ISLAND
-----------
When your finished talking with faye exit to the path
To get the dino to move go to the Distant clearing
Go past the dino's head and up into the next screen
Use the knife on the branches
Give the branches to the dino
The dino moved
Now go back down and now you can cross where the dino was
Exit to the next screen
To get passed the large dino eating the dead dino
Use the Tyranno Horn
Go to the next screen
Now, after all those events happen
Pick up the Dino ray gun
Shoot monster Frank with the ray gun
Talk to Faye, Ask her to turn her mirror around
Use the ray gun on monster Frank again
Give the death mask to Sparky
Use the ray gun on monster frank one last time..

@{fg shine} Uropa2 Solution to Blackout and Nomad@{fg text}

                             @{b}Blackout@{ub}

 Enter Base of CASTALIA (q.u.i.e.t.l.y.) and travel to the Research room. 
Download information which tells of the research about metamorphing the 
Tekite shape to the Commander shape through the programming of the Transport 
Computer. Go to the storage room next door and search room and locate the 
program instruction chip. This room has a Kapone at a cabinet. If there 
is not too much delay the Kapone will not turn and notice you. If observed 
you must destroy that Kapone before leaving that section of the base.

 Continue to search Section one of the base and you will locate a Credit 
Card on a dead colonist, an amunition clip and an autofire weapon 
enchancment. Another room will contain some colonists. Lead the colonists 
back to the Main transporter room and transport them to the Elderado Station. 

 There is a TED in the Workers Qrts which is needed to gain access through 
the security door. Both security rooms are level 0 which means once you 
gain access to the first by using the TED you will be able to get the access 
code to use on the 2nd security room. However, in case you stuff it up, 
there is a base card in the 2nd section of the base which will give you 
access to all security rooms in the base.

 Return to the Transporter room and insert the instruction chip into the 
Transport Computer. Transport to Translink Rm 1 and you will change to a 
Kapone Commander. You will have approx. 12 minutes to destroy the Comms 
room before the Morph FX will terminate and you change back to a Tekite.

 Locate the Supply room and purchase a detonator, search the Armory room 
and locate a High Explosive hidden behind some blocks in the room. Join 
the detonator to the high explosive to form Primed High Explosives. This 
will need power applied to the detonator to explode.

 Take these to the Comms room on the way you should locate a corridor with 
a switch. This needs to be turned off as it powers the communication 
device in the Comms room. Go to the Comms room and insert the Primed 
Explosive into the communications device.

 Return to Corridor and throw the switch and the Comms room should be 
destroyed. Now locate Commander and kill him. There is a Lockup key being 
carried by a Kapone in this section which is required to free the locked 
Colonists. Rescue the Colonsist, kill a few Kapones and Bobs your Uncle.

                               @{b}Nomad@{ub}

 Before embarking on this operation, you should purchase as many LS1200 
or HG0500 missiles as possible from the hovar supply computer in the 
Elderado Foyer. The foyer is located in the Elderado Station and accessed 
by either F3 or using the mouse to select.

 From here, transport to the surface and locate sector 60:07, killing enemy 
ships along the way. Once you have reached this sector, slow down! There 
are four enemy missile turrets on the far outskirts, surrounding the base. 
There are five communication towers that need to be destroyed, and the 
only weapon is missiles. 

 You need to select missiles and target each towers one at a time. Quite a
few missiles are needed to penetrate a towers shields. One "trick" is to 
travel into the centre of the base near the middle building stop. You will 
be just out of range from the missile turrets, and you can target the 
outer four towers. You will need to move out to target the central tower,
avoiding any incoming missle fire.

 Once this is done, the operation will be a success.

 Join us next month for the continuation to this solution!!!

 Games are reviewed mostly on playability and how long they will last
you, although some big games with fancy graphics might be expected to
get good reviews it is not always the case. A small 10k game might
get a better overall score than a 1Mb game. It is not that the 1Mb
game isn't any good it's just that the playablility might be non

will last a couple of minutes and you will only run it to show off

 Asciimilator is a new program to do and old idea. You have probably
seen many programs that do this kind of thing many times, it is a program
to convert IFF pictures to ansii text. It's a good simple idea that
works well and this program does the job it is supposed to do and it
also does the job quite well.

 You have to mess about with your iff picture a bit and widen it outwards
a bit so that it comes out how it should on your text file. Overall 
a good small program with a nice interface that gets the job you want
doing done.

@{fg shine} FiDED V39.547@{fg text}

 Alot of files today come with File_ID.DIZs when they are packed so it is
easier for you to find out what the program is without having to actually
read the docs or run the program. They are also used on nearly every
bullitain board going. It allows you to pack a short description of the
file into the archive so once you've uploaded it the BBS automatically
can read this file and saves you having to type in what the file is and
what it does.

 It can be a pain when you download files and the archive, text or whatever
name gives you no indication to what the file actually is so you have to 
spend time dearchiving your files to see exactly what they are. This is
where FiDED comes in handy, you select your directory, with the files in
and it will grab all the descriptions of the files that enclude File_ID.Dizs
and place them in an easy to read text file. The text file gives you the
name of the archive, the size of it and what the file_id.diz says. The 
archives or texts that don't have a file_id.diz it will skip and tell
you in the text file that there is no description for that file.

 Overall File-Id Extractor Deluxe is a must for anyone who wants to
easily find out what the files are. Make sure you get hold of this, it'll
save you plenty of time in the future.

 This little program is not really a util but it is not a game either,
it is sort of a WB hack. It was in the utils draw so thats why i'm
reviewing it in the utils section. You may remember wb eyes or similar
programs which sit on your workbench screen and the eye pupils follow
the mouse pointer. Well this is the same idea but with a 3D face. The
face is made up of a dot frame which can be sized up and down using the
+ and - keys. 

 It is very clever the way it works and is impressive how the author has
created the effect. It works well and is a nice little workbench toy
which can sit at the side of your WB and entertain you while you copy
disks or do more boring tasks.

 Overall a nice piece of programming, it may not appeal to all but well
worth taking a look.

 Screen grab is a program to capture iff screen shots of things like your
workbench screen etc. It is similar to the program i use to capture the
utils for review in AIO. Although I am un happy with the way this SGrab
works, firstly you click on its icon then nothing happends, wait a bit,
still nothing, so thats that, well not exactly. After a while a selector
will pop up on the main workbench screen. Then what do you do? no help
or anything, so of course you will type in the name of the file you want
to save, right done, it's saved. Load up the picture and you found its
captured your WB, how do you capture other screens? well don't ask me
because it does tell you. 

 Right onto the documents me thinks, ahh thats it! it tells you to run the
program and quickly select your screen then wait until the requestor pops
up and that screen will be locked and you can select what file name to
call it... hmm thats made it much clearer. So i tried that but how was i
supposed to know when the requestor poped up if i couldn't actually see
the WB screen? oh well i waited a few minutes then went to the WB screen,
entered my file name and saved the pic. When i loaded the picture up
I found it was a screengrab of my Workbench screen and not my Dopus
screen as i had wanted. Never mind, you could always use it to snapshot
wb screenshots and upload them to the aminet like many people have done,
well actually... no. The screenshot is all crashed no matter how many
times i try. So over all this software could be alot better.. sorry author!

 Utils are not marked on how good they are compared to other utils,
they are marked by usefulness and what purpose they serve. As there
are so many different utils that do so many different things it is
hard to review something like MUI and then when reviewing a program
like a WB clock say it wasn't up to the standard of MUI. This is why
it is not possible to have a Top Ten list for utils.

@node "fe1" "The way for Amiga to survive"

@{fg shine} The way for Amiga to survive@{fg text}

 I have been thinking over this for sometime now and it is important that 
the Amiga is handled properly if it will succeed, it is not always down to 
the actual computer to whether it will be popular, there are a number of 
factors that will make a computer successful. Firstly Amiga Int/Inc are 
going to have to cut there losses and charge a low price for the computer, 
they will have to lose profit at first to gain profit in the long run. This 
happend with the Sony Playstation where they charged a lower price than was 
really exceptable for them to charge but there marketing plans worked and 
they ended up being in profit. The less you charge for a computer the more 
the public are likely to want to buy it. Lets be honest who in the right mind 
is going to dump there £1000 Pc when a new Amiga comes out if it is also 
going to be £1000? The new Amigas really need to be aimed at the £500-£700 
price range for the 'normal' every day buyers, with higher spec systems for
graphic designers and more professional uses. 
 The second factor is before the computer is actually lunched Amiga Inc/Int
will have to contact existing big software houses, shops and other 
bussinesses to let the know about the benifits of using the new Amigas.
Software houses will have to be supplied with free top of the range Amigas so 
that they can start work on new projects or convert there existing products 
to the Amiga platform. This will allow the Amiga to be lunched with an 
already existing product range, no one will buy the Amiga if there is no 
software for it, even if there is promissed software in the future people 
will see a computer and no software, then look at the PC and see a huge range 
of software and of course choose the PC.
 The next factor is advertising, back when the Amiga was lunched there was 
absolutly no advertising but the Amiga still sold well, times have changed 
and for customers to buy things they want to see what it can do and they want 
to know about it. TV advertisments will be needed to show off what the Amiga 
is capable of otherwise everyone will be thinking 'I remember Amiga 500s, 
they where rubbish' so they won't buy an Amiga.
 And lastly it will need to be to some point a plug in and play type
of computer for new computer users that no nothing about them. It needs to 
come with built in internet software and other neccesary things to make it 
easier for the begginer to use.

                          By Jamie Solomons of Amiga1

                                  @{b}Part  One@{ub}


 @{b}@{u}Introduction@{ub}@{uu}

 Welcome to the first part of the diary. I am Jamie, the major programmer of
 Domination. This diary follows the progress of the game from the very
 beginning to where it is now and gives some handy hints about making your
 own game.

 The diary details the revamp of the game. A lot of the game has already
 been coded but it was not looking as good as we had hoped so we dumped the
 code, redrew the graphics and started from stratch. Our first design had 96
 ships, this was very nice and all it took ages to design each one and we
 had to take RAM into consideration. The new design has only 16 ships but
 that's all you need. You have a nice selection of items to equip each ship
 with, such as transporters and cloaking devices which were not present in
 the original game design. You couldn't choose the weapons to put on your
 ship because they were set but and they are interchangable via a beautiful
 drag and drop system that I have just finished. In the revamp we hope to
 allow control of ships within a star system as well as between systems.
 This is only an idea and we still need to sit down and discuss whether or
 not it is actually practical (programming-wise).

 Throughout this diary I will show you the changes we made and for what
 reasons. Once I have reached the stage that we got to in the development of
 the original game I'll keep you up to date with the developments as and
 when they happen. I keep a weekly diary for the game so I don't forget
 anything. (I might even reveal some secrets of the game such as cheat
 modes, hidden races, secret weapons, ect. :)

 N.B. AMOS commands will be shown in @{i}italics@{ui}.


 @{b}@{u}How it all Began@{ub}@{uu}

 Mark suggested the idea of making a space command game a bit like the PD
 game Conquest. I didn't really like the idea because I don't like Conquest
 but, unknown to Mark his suggestion had lit the flame to a big project -
 Domination. I began thinking about what I wanted in the game.
 
 I wanted to give the game a two-player option for null-modem link-up.
 I also wanted to give the game depth by having no single set objective.
 Players have a communications window in which they can type transmissions
 freely. You could wage war, set peace treaties or whatever you could think
 up. You could gang up against an enemy race or attack a space station.
 There are no limits!

 I wanted there to be other races as well as the ability to expand your
 civilisation by terraforming and colonising other planets in other systems.
 You could even terraform Pluto and setup a base there! I hoped to have a
 lot of secrets in the game as these are fun to discover. Ultimately I
 wanted a game with less "hack and slay" and more fun.

 To tackle the game I went along with Mark's idea to get the initial
 structure of the game off the ground and then, bit-by-bit add in the
 colour.


 @{b}@{u}The Programming Language@{ub}@{uu}

 The first thing that we did was figure out which programming langage to
 use. The only two that we had a hope of using were AMOS Pro and Blitz
 Basic 2. We weren't really experienced enough with the internal workings
 of the Amiga to use Blitz (I did try, but I found it difficult to display
 the screens I wanted; or slices, as they're called in Blitz). But there was
 a problem with AMOS Pro. Being an interpreted language we needed a
 compiler. I have the AMOS 1.3 compiler but that meant avoiding AMOS Pro
 commands and not having more than 16 banks. We decided to still use AMOS
 Pro commands and find someone to compile the game for us (Mr Seward has
 offered so you'll probably be hearing a lot more from the Domination team
 from now on!)

 AMOS Pro is not the best language for serious development but it suits our
 needs. It's a very flexable language and easy to use. Considering the
 amount of coding involved in Domination, we thought it was the best choice.
 I have always wanted to make a game but never took it seriously (probably
 because of the amount of work involved).


 @{b}@{u}Week One@{ub}@{uu}

 The first thing that we did for the game was redesign the main screen and
 its interface. This originally consisted of three screens (screens in AMOS
 do not have to fill the entire display, so you can have more than one
 visible at a time). Here's the first design of the main screen...

                    +--------------------------------+
                    |        Map control bar         |
                    +--------------------------------+
                    |                                |
                    |                                |
                    |                                |
                    |           Map Screen           |
                    |                                |
                    |                                |
                    |                                |
                    +--------------------------------+
                    |  The base bar (as we call it), |
                    |  it controls the game.         |
                    +--------------------------------+

 This was a good design but we found that the map control bar reduced the
 map screen by too much and so it had to go. We are now using a tab system
 for the game, allowing us to get a lot of information onto the base bar.
 This system shows a lot of information and doesn't look too cluttered.

 During the construction of the original game we had a good idea of what we
 wanted but I have to admit that we didn't plan it very well. To begin with
 we just let the game develop on its own and hoped that everything fell into
 place. This is bad programming tecnique and we shouldn't have done it. We
 have changed this by the careful planning of this revamp.

 The base bar had space for a message bar, a graphical display of the
 selected system, brief information on the system, buttons to access menus,
 a panel for communications and space for a few other buttons. The first
 design for this bar didn't look too good (improvments have been made).

 @{"   Basebar   " system "Screenshots/showiff Screenshots/dom1.iff"} - Click here to see the design for the original base bar.
 @{" New Basebar " system "Screenshots/showiff Screenshots/dom2.iff"} - Click here to see the new design for the base bar.

 We dropped the idea of a permanent graphical display of the current system
 and put it on a tab because it's not actually used that much in the game.
 The gadget with the word lock next to it is actually a tick box (more about
 this another time). We also went for a more graphical approach as our first
 design looked a bit boring.
 
 Once we had designed the foundations for the game we started designing the
 menus that could be opened from the base bar. We had buttons for a data
 menu, a colonise/military menu, a trades menu, a government menu, a
 research menu, a mining menu, a help menu and a fleet menu.

 We took the time to discuss the graphics that were to be used on the main
 map screen. As we are not very good at designing graphics, we went for a
 more tactical approach. We decided that the player would be looking down
 upon the galaxy (or part of it) and make military decisions. This might
 sound a bit boring but if you like K-240, Sim City, Dune or any game along
 the same lines then you will love the ideas that we have for Domination.

 We worked out how we were going to display the map. We originally decided
 on a large screen that scrolled around when you moved the pointer to the
 edge of the display. The area that you could see was just a small area of
 the overall map.

                    +----------------------------------+
                    |                                  |

                    |         |                 |      |

                    |                                  |
                    +----------------------------------+

 This is fine and can allow smooth scrolling (@{i}screen offset@{ui}). The
 problems with it are that you only have a limited screen size (about 1024
 by 1024) and this limits the size of the map. A large 32 colour screen also
 takes up quite a lot of RAM. A solution would be to update the display in
 the region of the screen that is just about to scroll into view. We could
 then make the screen "wrap" and therefore have a huge map. This is a rather
 complicated solution and we prefer the simplicity of a single screen and
 the idea is still open to debate. An idea that I had was to introduce
 wormholes that link to other galaxies (or a different part of the galaxy
 you are in). You could then change the map completely when you click on the
 wormhole, for example.

 We booted up Frontier (Elite 2) to get ideas for some system names. There's
 nothing wrong with taking the names of the systems that are a long distance
 away from from Sol because there are so many of them (I think they are
 generated).

 We considered the kind of symbols that the map was going to display and
 decided that a way was needed of controlling what the map showed. Mark
 at first came up with the idea of a map bar that sits at the top of the
 display with buttons that control what is being shown by the map. We have
 kept the same idea but placed it onto one of the tabs to save space and
 increase the map area that you could see.

 I considered the problem of storing all the information that we needed for
 the game and worried about RAM limitations. These worries were not for my
 Amiga but for those people that @{i}still@{ui} havn't upgraded.

 This is the the Amiga that Domination is being created on:

 Amiga 1200 - 400MB internal IDE Hard Drive, 260MB external IDE Hard Drive,
              170MB external IDE Hard Drive, Mini Tower for HD's, Blizzard
              68030-50MHz accelerator with 16MB SIMM, a 4-Way buffered
              interface, an external floppy drive, Philips monitor, stereo
              output, a mouse, and an 8-bit sound sampler.

 but it's better than Mark's...

 Amiga 500+ - 130MB external Hard Drive, mouse!

 and Chris'...

 PC.. (NOOOOOOOO!)     He sold his Amiga and regrets it ("space" - he says).

 It's not a bad system and it does the job quite nicely.

 This is as far as we have got so look out for part two next month -
 weeks 3 to 5. If you want to contact us about anything, email as at:

@{fg shine} User Rep Election 98@{fg text}

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

User Rep Election 98
The Election Procedures

In cooperation with the JMS, Team AMIGA Worldwide, and the ICOA

The role of the JMS, Team AMIGA, and the ICOA

The bylaws of the Industry Council of Open Amiga require that the
Steering Committee have 1 full voting seat to be occupied by a user
representative selected in the manner deemed by the ICOA to be the
most productive way in which to provide a user representative.
                                                                          
Therefore, the Transitional Steering Committee (TSC) of the ICOA
invited proposals from the Amiga community at large on selection
procedures for the selection of a User Representative. The JMS
answered this invitation with a set of proposals and procedures
that were hampered by time restrictions not of its making.

When voting was verified, there were several votes disqualified due to
being of a fraudulent nature, leaving three of the candidates all but
tied. Consultations between the nominees, the JMS, and Team
AMIGA made it clear that corrective action needed to be taken.

Because of the time constraints, lack of proper publicity, and
fraudulent votes, The JMS in conjunction with Team AMIGA asked for
and obtained permission to hold a new vote with ample time for
publicity, nominations, and voting from a much wider audience
than previously attained.

-----

Following are the new procedures outlined to gain a wider voting
audience. We urge each of you to take advantage of this opportunity to                                                                            
nominate and elect a User Representative of your choice.

The person elected will serve as your spokesperson in the building of
a new Amiga future. Choose wisely, but choose ...

-----

EMAIL NOMINATIONS

All nominations must be sent to JMS member Andrew Bienhaus
<accolon@ionline.net> by midnight before (GMT) 30th May, 1998.

* An election statement of no more than 500 words of plain text
or HTML for the JMS election web site to publish on the nominee's

and prospective members may not be nominated and no more than two
supporters of any nominee may be ICOA members or prospective members.

The list of valid nominees for the election, along with pointers to
their election statements, will be made available by the JMS as soon
as possible after 2 June, 1998.

VOTING PROCEDURE

Votes may be cast by regular mail, Fido Netmail, email, or via a web
form and must be received between midnight before (GMT) 2 June, 1998
and midnight before (GMT) 20 June 1998. All voters must give their
name and a valid email address and may not cast more than one vote in
the election process. If more than one vote comes from the same voter,
all votes from that voter, email address and any subsequent addresses
will be disqualified. Vote takers, arbiters, and the collector of
nominations are not allowed to cast votes.

VOTING BY REGULAR MAIL

Ballots may be obtained through several Amiga magazines for voting                                                                            
by normal postal mail. Postal ballots should be mailed to Andrew
Bienhaus at the address listed above.

VOTING BY FIDONET

Persons wishing to vote from Fidonet Amiga will forward a Netmail to
Asha Develder, moderator at 1:202/720.5 and request a prenumbered
ballot. Asha will return by regular Fido netmail, a prenumbered ballot
to the requester. Once the ballot has been completed, this ballot will
be returned to Asha Develder for verification. Voted Netmail Addresses
will be posted to a listing on Fidonet Amiga on a weekly basis by the
moderator. Ballots will be forwarded to Andrew Bienhaus no later than
20 June 1998

VOTING BY INTERNET EMAIL

An official ballot form will be made available once the list of
candidates has been finalized. All votes by Internet Email must be
made using this form with only one candidate selected. They must be
forwarded to the official vote takers email address which will be
announced at the time the ballot is made available. Once the ballot is                                                                            
received by the vote taker, the vote taker will write back to the
return address to confirm the vote. If the confirmation message is
rejected due to an invalid email address, the vote will not be
counted.

VOTING BY WEB FORM

Two voting forms will be made available on this web site during the
voting period. Voters must submit their email address on the first
form in order to get a unique key sent to them by email. The key will
then be used to cast a vote from the second form.

ANNOUNCEMENT OF RESULTS

The JMS, Team AMIGA, and the ICOA together will arrange to announce
the results of the election as soon as possible after the close of
voting. This is expected to be on 22 June or shortly thereafter.

COMPLAINTS PROCEDURE

Anyone who feels that this election is not being conducted fairly may                                                                            
make an official complaint by writing to either Andrew Elia
<andrew@amigasoc.org> of the Amiga Society in London or Gary
Peake <gpeake@wans.net> of Team AMIGA. They will decide if the
complaint is justified and, if so, what must be done to make
things right. The JMS, Team AMIGA, and the ICOA disclaim all
responsibility for disruption in the election procedures due to
failures in the network or in the equipment used by their service
providers.
