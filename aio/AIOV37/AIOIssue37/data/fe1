Just a letter that's been making the newsgroups rounds that I thought
rather informative. Read on and judge for yourselves. -Mark

{bold}Valid Arguments:{nobold}
{p} {p}
There are some valid arguments that have been posted to this list IF you
use the assumption that Amiga Inc. is "holding out" information on you guys.
{p} {p}
In truth, we have set some very tough delivery schedules for ourselves and
we are determined to adhere as closely as we can to these schedules. Dates
may change, surprises like early deliveries or added value products may
well happen. We rule nothing out.
{p} {p}
From this list, suggestions are taken as they arrive and are talked about
internally. We added a manual from suggestions here early on. Everything
was going to be .pdf's or readme's only.
{p} {p}
Our "last minute surprise" at the Nuess show seems to have backfired and
rather than people saying "Wow, 5 months to an SDK", some of you have
gotten upset over the surprise. Keep in mind that our ACTUAL delivery date
is posted as the 19th through the 21st. There are some people here who are
German dealers who might tell you that at the last minute they were still
sending inquiries as to whether or not we would make the surprise happen as
we did. I am not sure if Bill even got the SDK's at the very start of the
show as we were doing tracing on the shipment at the time he was supposed
to already have them in hand.

{bold}Information Delivery{nobold}:
{p} {p}
Our "mode of general delivery of information" to developers will be from
our mailing lists and from the amigadev.net site. Users will have info
posted to amigadev.com. User groups will see their info posted to
amigadev.org. We may also post some of the same info to amiga.com That will
be done on a case by case basis as the com site is the corporate site and
some information will be designed to be more support specific.
{p} {p}
Links are being set now to the sites I just mentioned from the amiga.com
site.
{p} {p}
Because of legalities, some information will not go on the support sites
until we have the proper statements from attorneys and since we have been
making changes to how we intend to aggregate information for you and us,
these statements have just recently changed. I met with attorneys just
yesterday to go over the changes. I should have statements in hand as soon
as they can get them to me next week.
{p} {p}
We also have promised openly and more than once, that no general
announcements would be made by us until and unless set in concrete. On this
list, we have violated that promise a few times (the change from NVidia to
Matrox was one such pre-announcement). The Amiga community especially and
other communities represented here have been lied to and led along for too
many years already. So, yes, we are hesitant to release info until we know
we will deliver. Had we been positive of the surprise at Nuess a few weeks
ago, we would have announced a few weeks ago.
{p} {p}
I hope this clears the air a little better. I will be happy to pre-release
information, but we do not intend to release things we are not sure we can
make happen. If you see pre-release info, understand that it may well
change. We are a development company 5 months into concept, design, and
delivery.

{bold}License Fees and Support Fees:{nobold}
{p} {p}
We intend to open source a lot of things for open source programmers who
wish to participate in our Dream. There is a tremendous amount of talent in
the open source community who wants to work with us. We want their help as
well. We intend to let them shine and show what they can do with as few
restraints as possible, where we can. Open Source developers will pay no
license fees, no certification fees, and will be treated with all the
support we can give them for free. Any open source software, drivers, tools
will be so designated when certified by us.
{p} {p}
Commercial developers (and our users) must be protected from errant
software and poor coding. Licensing helps do that as does certification.
Remember that IF the license fee is 10% and you make nothing, you pay
nothing but your software is still licensed and certified. We do not think
a commercial developer will be hurt by any normal industry licensing or
support fees they elect to opt into. If the system is good and the software
is good, people will buy it from you. We think it is important for users to
know what software has been designed and certified to run on their systems
and believe that this will enhance rather than hurt sales.
