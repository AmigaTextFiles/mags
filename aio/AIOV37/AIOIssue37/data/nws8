{p} {p}
July 22, 2000 - Apex Designs today announced a distribution agreement with
Blittersoft. This agreement will allow Blittersoft to sell Payback, Apex
Designs' GTA-style game for the Amiga, through both their website and over the
telephone. The game will also be directly available through Apex Designs'
website, which will accept credit and debit cards.
{p} {p}
Payback is a game that allows the player to find out what it would be like to be
a master criminal. It's entirely non-linear - to complete a level the player
simply has to obtain a certain number of points - how they get those points is
entirely up to them; they can do what the local kingpin tells them, uncover
secret missions or just go on a mad killing spree. There are lots of hidden
surprises to discover, so it will be necessary to play the game through several
times to find all the extras.
{p} {p}
The game engine supports perspective correct texture mapping, environment
mapping (reflections), realistic shadows, alpha-channelling (lens flares,
explosions and shockwaves), 12 channel 3D sound and realistic physics. The game
will also be translated into several languages and is due for release in
November 2000.
