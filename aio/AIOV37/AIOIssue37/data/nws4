{subhead}The Siege, for Heretic II{def}
{left}
{p} {p}
The Siege is - like The Heretic Fortress - a pure Multiplayer add-on for Heretic
II. This game is about a "Siege", where one party plays the attackers and one
party plays the defenders. There are catapults and ballistas, the king's castle
and the crown and other nice things. There are also character classes like
wizards, fighters and clerics.
{p} {p}
When you start the game, a server has already been entered into your Heretic II
addressbook, so you can immediately play over the Internet. Of course you can
also play over a local server with friends. Amiga players can play on PC servers
and vice versa.

Besides this archive, you need the data files of "The Siege" to play this game,
which are available on www.raven-games.com/siege. Sadly they need to be
converted to a special format with a program which only runs on PCs. So people
with PC's can download these files (11 MB) and convert them themselves. However,
from 24 July 2000 on, you can find the converted files (30 MB) on Aminet.

"The Siege" is quite memory-hungry and "without tricks" it needs around 96 MB
RAM. There are some hints in the readme on how to get the RAM-needs down.
{p} {p}
"The Siege" requires the full version of Heretic II installed. It also includes
a binary update of The Heretic Fortress which results into a noticable speedup
of THF.

Please note that "The Siege" is a freeware add-on and is not officially
supported by Hyperion Entertainment. More information on "The Siege" is
available at www.raven-games.com/siege. Soon you'll probably find extra maps for
"The Siege" on the Hyperion homepage.

An installer script is included in the download.
