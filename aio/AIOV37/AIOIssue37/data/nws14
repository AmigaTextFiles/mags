The following news is ssourced from Bill McEwen, courtesy of UGN's live audio feed from the
Amiwest show:
{p} {p}
The AmigaOne is currently targeted at a December (this year, I
should add) release. It's based on Amiga's own customized
motherboard design, using off-the-shelf parts. Amiga are putting up
a hardware division, lead by Dean Brown, to create custom hardware
designs for various devices that will be then offered to 3rd parties
to manufacture.
{p} {p}
The SDK is selling better than forecasted.
Amiga have been in contact with numerous major consumer electronics
and software companies, including (straight quote) <cite>"every
major gaming company out there"</cite>. Many of these already
possess the SDK. Interest from major companies particularly picked
up after Bill's two recent TV appearances.
{p} {p}
A version of the SDK for Windows will be made available next month.
{p} {p}
Red Hat will start selling the SDK next week. Also Sun have started
using Amiga software to demo Java stuff.
{p} {p}
There are going to be public beta releases of the OE prior to release.
{p} {p}
There is going to be an Amiga IPO.
{p} {p}
Paul Nolan is now doing contract work for Amiga.

More on the license issues:{p}
No software developers will be forced to pay royalties. Voluntarily,
they can sign up for a certification program, which will give their
products an official Amiga "badge" and the chance to have their
product marketed by Amiga themselves. This will cost them $1.50 per
sold item.
{p} {p}
Amiga will start offering low-cost promotional merchandise to user groups.
{p} {p}
At the show, Amiga were showing off an ARM-based touchscreen unit, running the new OE. The
design is by none other than Mick Tinker, and it's not being sold
commercially yet.
{p} {p}
Backwards compatibility to the Classic Amiga from the new OE will be dealt with by something that "is not an emulator"
