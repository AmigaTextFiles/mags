Hi,{p}
I was wondering if you could help me. I used to use this old chem.
program on a real old amiga (sorry I don't know the type, im not
really amiga literate). I just loved the prog and it really helped,
well now im taking a chem. class at Ohio State and wishing I had that
old amiga. Osu has a version of the prog I used, but its for "Osu
only" the damn head of chem. is being a ass and wont let me have a
copy. Do you have any idea what I talking about? Sorry for the
vagueness, its just that I really don't know specifics. If I could
get at least a image for a emulator then that would be great, thank
for your time.
