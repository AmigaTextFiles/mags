DOpus and FTP:{p}
Magellian handles FTP quite well but one little thing they left out that
would make it perfect for Aminet: ADT. Well, until they decide to add
that here's something you can try.  Use HTTPLister; the latest version
will get the RECENT file and then list it in order of date.  You just
click each you want and then press the buttonto get it.  It even handles
Readmes. This little gem can be found on Aminet under biz/dopus.

MUI Crashes:{p}
I use a lot of MUI apps when I'm on Internet, several on their own MUI
screen, and a night doesn't go by when I don't crash at least once-
usually screen lock-up. Well, just an obervation from all those crashes
I've been through; the lock ups seem to not onlky occur only on MUI
custom screens but {italics}because{noitalics} of them.  Solution:
either run graphics intensive apps like browsers on the WB screen, or
find one of those make-your-own-public-screen utilities and see which
one works well with your MUI apps.

Birdie and Graphics:{p}
Birdie's great or  ice looking windows borders but before you go listing
those jpegs in the prefs, remember that only a narrow strip of it will
ever be shown along the borders and titel bar.  This being true, you
might as well as save a little memory and crop down your selected
patterns (use any good image processing program) to just what you'll
need for your window borders then save them out to a separate (now much
smaller) picture file for ue with Birdie.

Zorro and the A4000:{p}
In answer to some recent mailing list posts, SCSI will work on the A4000
but only if the Buster Chip version is of revision 11. Earlier versions
(revision 9) had a bug that didn't make them work properly.  Of course.,
this only applies to controllers hooked up via the Zorro-III interface;
SCSI controllers that don't use the Zorro bus are no problem.
