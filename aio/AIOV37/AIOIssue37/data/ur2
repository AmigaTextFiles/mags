Telnetting is one of the oldest functions of the internet, as we know
it today. Many people will not have even heard of it as the world
jumps onto the hype of the Internet, to most people meaning the World
Wide Web and Email. A number of people know about the likes of IRC,
ICQ, FTP, etc. but most consider the internet to only be the web and
email.
{p} {p}
Telnet is a way of communicating with another computer or system which
is not your terminal. For example a student could connect to a university
computer and run or edit programs on that computer without actually
needing to be there. You could telnet to that computer if they are
running a Unix, Linux, SunOS or many of the others which allow people
to telnet into that operating system. Other uses of telnet are to
telnet into Bulletin Board Systems which many of you may remember
from the "good old days", but these are connected to while you are
using the internet and are no different to normal BBSes.
{p} {p}
Most people will probably have no reason to use telnet but for the
ones of us who do you will need a telnet client to connect to the
host you require. On the PC it is as simple as typing "Telnet://"
+ the name of the host you want to connect to in your web browser
and an in-built telnet client will pop open. On the Amiga things are
never as simple and so we have telnet clients writen by the very
helpful community..
{p} {p}
There are quite a few clients out there but I am concentrating on
three of my favourites, all of which have differing levels of options
and in my opinion are from the most basic to the full blown package,
these are:
{p} {p}
 · Telnet v0.8{p}
 · DCTelnet v1.5{p}
 · VirTerm v1.1a
{p} {p}
(Newer versions of these maybe available)
{p} {p}
{p} {p}
{bold}Telnet v0.8:{nobold}
{p} {p}
Telnet is the only name I found for this program but as the name
may suggest this is the most basic of the three programs. It is
controlled through either a CLI session or an "Output Window"
will open to display all the information and data from the telnet
session.
{p} {p}
To start the program it is as simple as copying one file, "Telnet"
to your C: and then executing the command "Telnet <Host/IP> <Port>"
Once done it will open the output window and display as any other
telnet program, asking you for your login/password or other details
depending on what computer/system you are logging into.
{p} {p}
There are no frills and nothing to set up on this very basic program
from 1994 but I found it a great little program as there is no need
to load up any bulky GUI and can be a quick way of making a telnet
session while on your main WB screen. A great little program.

Known Requirements : Socket.library, AmiTCP/Miami/AS225R2 or other
TCP package.{p}
Main Program Size : 7.7k
{p} {p}
{p} {p}
{bold}DCTelnet v1.5a:{nobold}
{p} {p}
DCTelnet has been for a long time one of my favourite telnet clients,
it is the most bulky of the three but offers the most features, it
opens on its own screen but can be changed to open on a more simple
screen on the workbench. I did find using this on its own screen alot
more helpful as it can have full colours without the need for me to
put my workbench into 256 colours.
{p} {p}
The program has many features, far too many to go into into a small
review like this, but if you require lots of options and want to cover
most systems then you are likely to find that DCTelnet will do that
due the amount of options and features.
{p} {p}
One thing that may put you off using DCTelnet is the fact that it is
made by Digital Corruption. As i'm sure i've said in the past, I have
used this program for many years and not had one bit of trouble with
it, so if you are prepared to trust this then this is definitely one of
the best telnet clients on the market to date.
{p} {p}
A good function of DCTelnet is it has an automatic transfer function
which I don't think either of the other two have. This is useful for
BBS type telnet sessions when you receive the "receive data" command
or want to send some, ie transferring of files.
{p} {p}
Overall one of the best, most in-depth telnet clients available.
{p} {p}
Known Requirements : Kickstart/Workbench V2.0 (V36) or higher,
AmiTCP/Miami/AS225R2 or other TCP package, XPR library for transfers
(ex. xprzmodem.library), ibmcon.device (for ANSI colour) &
reqtools.library.{p}
Main Program Size : 34.7k
{p} {p}
{p} {p}
{bold}Virterm v1.1a:{nobold}
{p} {p}
Virterm is a mix between the last two programs in it having a basic GUI
but also being more basic in its functions like in Telnet v0.8's case.
A small GUI opens on your workbench screen where you have to specify
the host you want to connect to by editing the "new" host and then
saving it which I found a pain as you can't just open a window and
connect straight to your host.
{p} {p}
When you goto connect to the host you require an output window pops
up like in Telnet's case.
{p} {p}
This program is an in-between of the last two and has some features
but isn't as in-depth as DCTelnet with the only features on this
being, Backspace<->Delete, Use Shell and a saving of your hosts
listed.
{p} {p}
Overall a capable telnet client but I would really choose one of the
others.

Telnet 90%{p}
 {image gfx/AioGold.iff}
{p} {p}
Virterm 88%
{p} {p}
DCTelnet and Telnet are given close scores because the both serve
different kinds of people but both do a good job. If you need lots
of features and like to customise then DCTelnet is your best bet
but if you need a simple, small and quick client then Telnet is
a great option.
