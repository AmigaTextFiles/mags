AmTalk 2.2 (http://www.vapor.com/amtalk/) has been released by Vaporware. From
their website:
{p} {p}
"AmTalk is a combined server/client for the Internet ntalk protocol for
point-to-point online chatting.
{p} {p}
The ntalk protocol establishes a direct connection between two clients using a
server running on both machines, allowing realtime chat where you can see the
other person's keystrokes as they type.
{p} {p}
The ntalk protocol is still widely used on a variety of platforms; for example,
most Linux installations come with a preset talk package.
{p} {p}
AmTalk functions as both the client and the server. It sits quietly and
unobtrusively in the background, waiting for incoming talk requests and giving
you the option to accept or ignore the request, and even send it to an
'Answering machine' which records whatever the user types for you to read later.
{p} {p}
Please remember, AmTalk is shareware. If you use it, please register the
software and help support Amiga software development."
