"Rogue3D, the latest 3D support site finally goes public! With 4 months of
development, the rogue3D team finally feel that the site is worthy of release!
We will strive to bring you the best artwork, tutorials, textures and features
from around the world. However, all our hard work has only just begun, and there
is already a major revamp of the code due for the next couple of months. we are
also hoping to bring you some good competitions, and remember, if you want to
chat to people who have the same 3D interest as you, pop along to #Ami3D, our
IRC channel, and get aquainted!

 Yours, the Rogue3d team"
