{bold}Privacy Information:{nobold}
{p} {p}
We are having, as I stated earlier, new privacy, copy right, trade mark,
and license statements made for the web site. I just obtained a ruling that
allows us to accept faxed NDA's as legal documents so this has been taken
care of. Amiga Inc. paid millions of dollars for the trade marks, copy
rights, licenses, etc. We do intend to protect them to the fullest extent
possible. This does NOT however mean that we intend to force normal support
sites or users who have Amiga news sites to pay money. But they will have
to follow standard, legal, trade mark and copyright provisions, licensing
included. Our protectionist stance also allows us greater leverage in
closing down sites which might pirate commercial developer applications and
allows us to protect what we have paid millions of dollars for. I think
Bill and I have made our intentions clear on this matter in several forums.
{p} {p}
The MAC (NIC) address is being used by us as a means of getting developers
registered to our dev site so that we can have databases of information
that will help YOU find developmental help, beta testers, programming
partners, and maybe other areas of assistance for developers. We will also
ask user groups to log into a database so users anywhere can locate the
nearest user groups. Users buying registered developer software will have a
place to log their purchases if they so choose so that registered
developers can readily check for comments and suggestions much easier than
they can now. We do NOT intend to sell or distribute this information. Our
sole purpose is to assist you do a better job at merchandising and finding
the help and assistance you need to become profitable regardless of the
size of your company.

{bold}Amiga Inc. Surprises:{nobold}
{p} {p}
While we have schedules we will be announcing and adhering to as closely as
humanly possible, look for some surprises from us from time to time. These
surprises are not designed to disenfranchise anyone. They are designed to
create excitement and energy and to show all of you that we are not
standing still. We reserve the right to make these surprises happen when we
can without pre-notice to anyone.
{p} {p}
We will also be posting calls from our internal development group to this
and other lists as well as to the support site. These calls (like the audio
call a day ago or so) will be to allow any of you with talents in a
particular area to participate by contract (in most cases) with building
the Dream we all have. Some of these calls will be covered under NDA and
others will be totally open source calls. We will make sure you know which
it is when we make them. We want participation, not lock-outs of as many of
you as possible.

{bold}General Information/Sales Information:{nobold}
{p} {p}
All sales related information should be sent directly to randy@amiga.com
{p} {p}
All general information requests should be sent to friend@amiga.com,
developer@amiga.com, or direct to me or my support staff.
{p} {p}
We are seeking a Marcom/PR type person who will begin handling some of the
requests once on board. If you know of anyone with experience in this area,
send them to us please.
{p} {p}
{bold}Support Sites:{nobold}
{p} {p}
The basic design of the support sites is what you see there now. Amazing as
it seems, we received one complaint and the balance of respondents liked
the new style. I will be lightening the header color and darkening the text
but these are the only changes we have been asked to make.
{p} {p}
You will begin seeing more structure and information happening with the
support sites late this weekend and next week. There is a lot of work to do
there. So, please, bear with us as we try to make them as easy to navigate
for you as possible with as much text content as possible.
