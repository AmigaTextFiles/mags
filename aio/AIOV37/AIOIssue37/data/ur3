AmFTP feeling dated? DOpusFTP not support RECENT list parsing? Well,
look no more, because there's a little ARexx program that shows just
what can be done with the help of the AWNP pipe program. It's FTP
designed specifically for Aminet use.

Extremely simple to set up and use, it'll get the RECENT list and
parse it by day (not just one entire week lumped at you). After that,
just double-click to get your choise of "View Readme", "Get", or
"Abort, or shift click all the files you want and then hit "Get". A
checkbox gives the option of automatically downloading the Readme
along with the main files.  The list gives the usual Name, Type,
Size, Age, and Description. That's all there is to it.
{p} {p}
Hit View to see just the readme, or use the Search field to find the
file you're looking for. A cycle gadget let's you select which Aminet
server to get both the RECENT file and the archives from.
{p} {p}
Setup is just a matter of adding the different Aminet servers in the
Settings.  Not hard really, but here we see the one bug in this
otherwise fine program.  After entering in a server, then back at the
main window the cycle gadget now has {bold}all{nobold} the servers
listed in a {bold}single line{nobold} entry, the servers separated by
a bar. Rather annoiying but easy to get around when you realize that
the "Aminet.awnp.cfg" file is straight text and easy to edit.  Just
make sure it's in terms of at http link.

Nothing more need be said here. Aminet.awnp if written by Bruce
Steers and requires Class Act or OS3.5 and performs well as an
Aminet-specific FTP program and it iss in that niche that my rating
is given.  Only that one bug prevents it from going over the top.
