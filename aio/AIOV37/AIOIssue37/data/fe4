Hmm, we seem to have missed a month.  Guess I'll have to make up for it
then.  With that in mind, here are {bold}FIVE{nobold} bonus sites for
your enjoyment. Nothing too serious, just some easy sites to occupy
your mental downtime. So sit back, relax, and start browsing.
{p} {p}
{p} {p}
TechTales{p}
http://www.techtales.com{p}
Another site where you can read true tales of tech support nightmares as 
told from the tech support people themselves. Nevertheless, these 
stories never fail to be entertaining and are definitely worth a look.
{p} {p}
Amiga Support Network{p}
http://www.amigadev.net{p}
A suppport site for Developers, Betatesters, and User Groups. The
Developer site contains code snippets, Faq-O-Matic, UBB Message
Boards, mailing lists and more. Or you can register as a Beta-Tester,
provided you've already purchased the Amiga SDK, and enter into the beta
tesinbg pools. Finally, the User Group support section contains a user
group registration database and info on various Amiga User Group support
activities. It appears to be a site still in development but one worth
keeping an eye on.

Wacky Uses{p}
http://wackyuses.com{p}
A collection of things you'd never think to do with normal products,
it's a truly interesting list. From Alka-Seltzer being used to clean
toilets and unclog drains to using toothpaste to polish jewelry, it's
surprising what you can do with some of these things. Top it off with
wierd facts of our favorite products and this site's a keeper.
{p} {p}
Puzzles{p}
http://www.primroselodge.com/Playtime/playtime.htm{p}
Logical puzzles, lateral thinking, brain teasers, they're all here. A
categorized collection of puzzles that use no mathematical formulae and
require only a good mind and a bit of time. So strap on your thinking
caps and get started.
{p} {p}
The Museum of Questionable Nostalgia{p}
http://www.dreamsandbones.com/museum/museum.htm{p}
A site with audio and video clip dedicated to classic and forgotten
television shows and commercials of days gone past.  The nostalgia in
this case is limited to those rare varieties that the site's webmaster
deems almost unworthy or remembrance but that proove fun to look back on
nonetheless. So, if you remember "Skippy, The Bush Kangaroo", "Courageous Cat & Minute
Mouse", and the "Mystery Date" comercial, then this is the place.  One
note though, the audio clips are in a form of Real Auio whose encryption
seems a mystery to the one Amiga Real Audio port I know of (but playable
on PC players).
{p} {p}
Movie Boss{p}
http://movieboss.com{p}
Site of another on-line game, this one letting you be the  movie boss
that gets to decide what movies to carry and see how well your bank roll
does against the others. Just sign up and start loggin in; it's free.
{p} {p}
Trailervision{p}
http://www.trailervision.com{p}
Ever see a film where the trailer is far more entertaining then the
movie ever could be?  Ever want to see {bold}just{nobold} the trailers?
if the answer to both of these is yes, then hook into this site and
start cruising through it's QuickTime archive of old and new movie trailers
with far more entertainment value then the full flick.
{p} {p}

else you ever wanted to know.  All can be found here including such
color fsctoids as can mice be green and can rainbows br black.  Just

{p} {p}
The Sev Files: Resurrection{p}
http://www.sev.com.au/toonzone/sevfiles/res.asp{p}
Put the X-Files back in Roman Times investigating such mysteries as
Jesus' body disappearance ,from his tomb and you got the Sev Files. An
on-going cartoon strip with agents Scurvy and Mouldy that's worthy
keeping track of for a good chuckle or two.

The Motion Picture Industry: Behind The scenes{p}
http://library.thinkquest.org/10015{p}
Ever want to look behind the scenes of the motion picture industry? See
how things work? Well, here's your chance. A site devoted to behind the
scenes looks at the film industry.
{p} {p}
First we start with a Glossary of film terms, from A & B Cutting to Zoom
Lenses. Then read the history of film, from the earliest cinemascope to
modern uber-effects films. The basics of film making are also
referenced, as are the various stages of production and effects,
stunts, and make-up. Cell animation, stop-motion, matte paintings, and other techniques are
also explained. An endless fountain of information.
{p} {p}
Want to know about test screenings? Film festivals and ratings also
figure in big before a film is done.  And lest we forget advertising?
Once you're finished with all this, if you have real Video or Quicktime
then maybe you'll want to test screen the current video clip. You can
even go behind the scenes of a current studen film production.
{p} {p}
When you're all finished with this, you can finally put your new found
skills to the test with an on-line simulation of making an actual film.
You get the script, choose the shots, sound, and advertising campaign,
then see how well your production comes out.
{p} {p}
You may never get into the film industry, but maybe this will feed your
need for filmed fame.
