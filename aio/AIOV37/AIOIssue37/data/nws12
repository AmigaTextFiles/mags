Again from Vaporware a new release: their MUI based telnet client:
{p} {p}
"Telnet is the underlying TCP/IP protocol used whenever you are computers across
the Internet. Browsing the web or using an FTP client (such as mFTP) allows you
to request specific files from remote computers, but not to actually be logged
on as a user of that computer. With AmTelnet II, you can log on as a regular
user with whatever privileges granted you to use the specific applications and
data on that computer. This is usually the case with Unix shell servers.
{p} {p}
As system security becomes more of a concern worldwide, the newer standard of
SSH (Secure SHell) emerged. SSH encrypts the data which usually is transmitted
from server to client as cleartext. Until now, the only way to use SSH to
securely access remote computers on the Amiga was to use a port of the Unix
client. Now, however, AmTelnet II provides this functionality.

Please remember, AmTelnet II is shareware. If you use it, please register the
software and help support Amiga software development.
