Hello there my name is Joe and IM going to be doing a new monthly
article for this glorious Amiga driven webzine. I'm calling it "The
view from the outside" and this is why; I use to be a HUGE Amiga nut
but as the years went on and the Amiga lost its edge I lost my
interest and moved on to wintel and winamd machines. My love for my
Little Amiga 1000 never left me but I just couldn't handle the lack
of speed, support or (the biggee) SOFTWARE!  I sold my little Amgia
and moved onto greener pastures, but as of late I've been getting
that funny little feeling in me that maybe theirs an Amiga in my
future.  From out here on the outside of the Amiga world it has been
a very bad last 10 years or so. Promises not kept and total melt down
of the U.S. Amiga scene have jaded even the hardest core Amigoids so
a guy like me had no chance to hang in there.

Lately (as in the last few weeks) I was dabbling with the idea of
getting a Macintosh to supplement my Pentium and Athlon fleet. Oh god
they're expensive (note to Amiga: keep them affordable please) and in
my opinion (that and a quarter might get ya a cup of coffee) Macs are
to slow for the cost.  I know I know; G4 this and G4 that, but gimmee
a break; the Athlon 1ghz tbird would destroy the thing at a much
cheaper price. Then after hearing that the new AMIGA is due out my
interest peaked, could it be true? Are they really finally going to
make a new Amiga?

So I asked around and to my surprise it looked like they were and
even better the new Amiga seemed farther along than vaporware that it
seemed to have been years before. The outside world has barely even
paid notice to this and most computer fiends write it off as more
unkeepable promises.

Where do I stand? ..hmmmm, well I'm very hopeful. I think this new
Amiga could really be something special something I just have to
have, but I'm going to be very cautious about getting my hopes up too
soon.

Note to Amiga BUILD IT AND THEY WILL COME.
