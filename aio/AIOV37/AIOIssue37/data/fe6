We at AIO are always looking to improve things, so in that effort I have an
announcement/request. For a few months I've been trying to find someone
willing/able to do a good programming column without success. So, I'm
sending out this cattle-call to anyone that would like to do a monthly
column on programming tips, basics, advanced tips, etc, for either C/C++ or
ARexx. If you think you have the knowledge and are willing to commit to a
monthly column, then please email me at-

columns@aio.co.uk

You'll be paid nothing more then the gratitude of the Amiga Community and
readers of AIO.

Also, if you have another idea for a column that you feel you can handle, such as a DIY series,
then by all means email me with your idea.
