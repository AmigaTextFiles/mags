{subhead}Classic Games- Fortress{def}{p}
Review by Chris Seward

Nearly all Amiga users these days have been around on the Amiga for
a very long time and those of you who are quite new to the platform
should still remember classics like Meglo Mania and Populus as well
as the many other clones of these types of games.
{p} {p}
In 1994 one of the very best Amos programmers at the time and probably
in the history of Amos made a game called Fortress, this Amos wizard
who should take a bow for his creations is called, Lee Bamber. I'm
sure many of todays Amos users are at this very moment slightly nodding
their heads and thinking, "ahh, I remember him". Along with the Amos
users alot of people who dabbled in the purchasing of licenceware
will also remember this name as i'm sure him with a select few others
made quite a profit for the owners of F1 Licenceware (Steve Bye
and wife). In the end, a great Amos programmer.

The game Fortress is like a watered down version of Populus but still
very professional for the £2.99 (?) price tag. The idea of the game
is to build up your army and take over the pre-set settlements on the
game.
{p} {p}
When starting you are given a base with the two other enemies also
given bases at other locations on the world map. You can tell the
difference from yourself and your enemies by the different coloured
flags you sport. The world map stays static with some pre-set locations
that you can travel to. At first all locations not occupied have a
green flag and as you move into them the flag changes to your colour.
{p} {p}
Sounding simple? Well, not so. Once you and the other two players have
taken over the untaken locations you then have to take over each
opponents places. These are taken in a medieval war style battle in which
in most cases the one with the most Troops, Horses, Carriers, Mincers
and Catapults wins. You do not get to control the battles but instead
a small window opens where you can see the flags of you and your
opponent move back and forth as you each gain or loose in the battle.
Your army sections are also displayed in the style of bars which go
down as you each loose Troops, Horses etc. The one who defeats all
the opponents Troops, Horses and Mincers goes on to either keep the
location or to take over it.
{p} {p}
As time passes more battles are waged as you try to take over the
other opponents and they try to take over you. After set periods of
time a gong is sounded and your plots get better castles or forts
on them which helps produce more troops, horses, carriers, mincers
and catapults in a faster time. The bigger the castle the quicker
they are produced. You get bigger castles by owning that location
longer as the game progresses.
{p} {p}
There seems to be an unlimited amount of levels to the game all of
which are the same but occasionally the opponents flags change
colour. Each level takes quite a long time to play, it took me about
40 minutes to an hour to complete each level, this is done by killing
off all the opponents and owning all the locations on the world map.
{p} {p}
The game is very entertaining and can waste quite a bit of your time,
I did feel a bit drained after completing each one level and seeing
the same map the next level with practically the same game ahead was
a bit boring and meant I only really played one level per day to
avoid getting too bored of the game.
{p} {p}
The graphics of the game, the title music and ingame sound effects
are brilliant, the only let down of the game is the fact it could
become boring as the playing area is always the same. I suppose the
opponents get more clever or harder as the levels progress but this
is something I have not began to note yet.
{p} {p}
A good feature of the game is the fact you can save it after each
level so you don't have to start from the first level each time you
play the game.
{p} {p}
Overall a very professional game which keeps up the tradition of the
man who made it. The graphics, music and sound are all very well
done. The only let down is the world map and locations are always the
same on each level which could cause boredom.
