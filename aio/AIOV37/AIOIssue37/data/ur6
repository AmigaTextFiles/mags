TView is a program that checks what's on TV... I reviewed an earlier version in
an Issue not to far back, namely in Issue 29.
{p} {p}
The installation is straight forward, just copy it somewhere...
{p} {p}
After you have installed it, you must go into the prefs, and choose what server
to use, and which channels that you want info on.
{p} {p}
TView has now a built-in function to watch for new updates, which works
alot better then the ARexx script it used to have! (Shame on the author, ehrm,
me that is... :) )
{p} {p}
It is also localized, it comes with the following catalogs, dansk, deutsch,
francais, norsk, suomi and svenska...
{p} {p}
When you then choose "Get data", TView will connect to a server, for instance,
www.dagenstv.com and get the information on the channels that you have
decided to check... It will then show them in a list listed there...
{p} {p}
You can sort the list by Hour, by Channel, or even show all channels and all
times at once... Whatever you like the most...
It will write the additional information of the TV show in the lower part
of the window when you mark one... It also have some nice features, you
can search for a given string and it will then show all matches in the
list, or you can set a alarm on one or more programs, it will then open
a window 5 minutes before it starts so you have time to make coffee or
something!
{p} {p}
If, but I doubt, there is anything you don't understand, just read the
Guide. It's very well written. And it will make you master TView in notime.
