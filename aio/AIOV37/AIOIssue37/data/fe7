Well, we've all seen the Neus show reports and read what the men on top
have to say, but what does it mean? Follow along young Jedi as we try to
analyze what they've really said.
{p} {p}
First there's the Java bit. Apparently the new Ami will run Java Virtual
22 times faster then on any other platform. A definite plus if Java
really is the wave of the future.
{p} {p}
Platform independent OS?  Well, on the one hand it does ,mean we won't
be limited by what hardware we can buy, but on the other we Amigans are
used to a synthesis of hardware and software unseen anywhere else. It's
like having a soul without the body (sounds like an undead computer
system, but I guess that's sort of what we've had for a while anyway).
This begs the question what will constitute an Amiga; is it just a
multi-platform Windows?
{p} {p}
But wait; now they're saying something about an Amiga One. A new desktop
computer to be put out by amiga; complete hardware and software
integrated into thew first new official Ami to come along in a long
time.
{p} {p}
Okay, so now I feel better. We have our flagship machine, the rest of
the fleet can now feel free to follow.
{p} {p}
And what a fleet it seems to be. The range of chip platforms and host
systems seems rather broad. Windows is even mentioned as on the list
of host systems supported (Windows hosting Amiga? Well, I guess every
story needs it's running gag). The way people are getting tired of
Wintel dominance this could be a very good thing, but onlky if the OS
still maintains the spirit of the Amiga. Porting it to everything from
palmtops to camcorders would also mean a LOT more hardware compatibility
for the new Amiga One (and you {bold}know{nobold} that's what we're all going to be
interested in buying). So, as long as there {italics}is{noitalics} a flagship computer to
build our altar around then I'm okay with the whole multi-platform
thing.
{p} {p}
Other little but necessary details. Our favorite multiple dragging
screens is going to be kept (enter sigh of relief); just one of those
little things that we have that no one else does which makes our
computing lives so much easier (I couldn't live without them). BOOPSI
is also being ported and the new successor to AREXX is also being
finished, called SHEEP; apparently the AREXX rights belong to a third
party, but this gives them a chance to make a new optimized bug-free (or
at least, free of the {italics}old{noitalics} bugs) inter-program language. According to
show reports Multitasking is also still there in the new system (and
sounding evcen better then ever), as well as a few goodies like
transparent windows.
{p} {p}
Okay, so in the end the system looks great, complete with promises of
Classic Amiga emulation being optimized even as we speak.  But what
about software support?  We all know how important that is.
Multi-platform or not, if there's not gong to be a wide set of
applications for the base system ported over, then we might as well as
pack it all in right now.
{p} {p}
The number 170 was mentioned in reference to the number of apps that are
being ported over... also the phrase "mostly games" was heard. I'm
hoping that some serious apps are being brought over asa well, because
let's face it Wordworth running on the classic emulation on the new
hosted OS ain't going to do it.  With partners like Corel promising to
port their stuff over chances are good for some serious business
applications, but we still need to make sure that a wide enough suite of
programs is to be had (just give me {bold}one{nobold} decent WYSIWYG web editor for
the Amiga like I've seen on Macs... just {bold}ONE!{nobold}) or no one's going to be
taking it seriously. We could end up as just an over-hyped games
console if someone isn't careful.
{p} {p}
So I guess in the end it's not the hardware nor OS I'm worried about
but the software support. Make my old programs run as before, port my
files over cleanly, and open up a whole new world of software that my PC
friends keep reminding me they have available, and I'll bve a happy
camper. Make it connect up with every palmtop, scanner, and microwave
out there and I'll be estatic. Give it a REAL marketing plan that will
dominate the world and I'll...

Excuse me, I need a cold shower.
