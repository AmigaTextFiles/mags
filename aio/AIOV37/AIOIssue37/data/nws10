"It gives us great pleasure to have released the Software Development Kit (SDK)
on schedule and to follow up with such excellent value to the community with the
d'Amiga Developer Workstation. It gives us equal pleasure to have the support of
Software Hut and Wonder Computers behind this release. Through this developer
machine, we achieve our goal of providing excellent value in superior hardware
to realize our cross platform binary compatibility promise for developers. This
will no doubt come as great news to those in the community seeking value of
their dollar as they develop for the great number of target platforms that Amiga
supports," said Randall Hughes, Vice President, Sales and Strategic Alliances at
Amiga Inc.

"We at Software Hut are extremely excited to have been selected as the official
US Distributor for the authorized d'Amiga Developer Workstation. Many of our
customers and dealer partners have been looking for a machine with all the
specifications to run the Amiga SDK in one bundled package. Our combined
efforts, along with Amiga Inc.'s and Wonder Computers', will ensure that all
developers will have easy and affordable access to the tools needed to develop
software that will revolutionize computing as we now know it," said Joseph
Muoio, President of Software Hut, Inc.

"We are proud to be a part of this quantum leap forward in computing technology,
and look forward to working closely with Amiga and Software Hut on this project
in the weeks and months to come. The developer machine is more than just a tool.
It represents the first significant opportunity for Amigans and former Amigans
everywhere, to join forces and help bring about a real change in the way
computers work. The developers machine can also be configured to run Amiga
Classic software through emulation, adding further to its potential value for
anyone considering a purchase," extolled Mark Habinski, President of Wonder
Computers International Inc.
{p} {p}
The developer machine represents unparalleled value, uses brand name parts of
the highest quality, and is bundled with a comprehensive warranty on hardware
and an enhanced level of support from Amiga Inc. The workstation also includes
the Amiga SDK. "We at Amiga are proud to have our name on the d'Amiga Authorized
Developer Workstation," said Mr. Hughes, in reference to its significant value
and competitive price. Such a price/performance achievement is not possible
using clone hardware. If it does not have the official Amiga Boing insignia, it
is not an authorized Amiga Developer Workstation. Please see www.amiga.com for
