Well, looks like we're a bit late this time.  Sorry about that but there
were forces conspiring against us (like the 'Net eating one editor's
set of articles that i was suppossed to get, unexplained computer
problems...) and rather then put out an incomplete poor issue I decided to
hold it off for a month until some things could be straightened out.
But we're back.

New column this month. View From The Outside is going to be a monthly
perspective from one former Amiga fanatic as he looks with hopeful
interest on what may at last be the return everyone has hoped for.
{p} {p}
Also coming up next month (fingers crosed) will be a Tech Questions column;
our monthly contributer will explain some technical details of Amigas
and computer related topics, and will as well answer anyt technical
questions you people wish to mail in.  So, start those qquestions
coming!

A quick comment about our Amiga's future... I finally think we
{italics}have{noitalics} one.  With Matrox coming in to supply our
graphics cards, if ever anyone needed anymore evidence that there
{bold}will{nobold} be a new Amiga computer then this is it. I don't know
about you, but I'm going to start saving my pennies.

Well, that's all until next month.  Enjoy the issue.
