*Innovative brings Digita(TM)-power to your AMIGA!* Innovative has
developed a driver for DigiCams running the Digita(TM) Operating
Environment. Digita(TM)-enabled DigiCams offer much more flexibility
and abilities than everything else currently on the market.
Digita(TM) is used in high-end-cameras of different companies, runs
on PowerPC- and Coldfire-CPUs and allows you to run scripts,
applications and games (incl. MAME!!) on your camera. The developers
of Digita(TM), Flashpoint(TM) (http://www.flashpoint.com/) wants to
make Digita(TM) the standard for DigiCams and specified a
standardized communication-protocol between computer and camera. With
the now available VHI-driver, AMIGA-users finally get access to these
amazing cameras and can download and rework pictures from these
cameras. Currently available Digita(TM)-enabled DigiCams are:{p}
          Kodak DC 220, DC 260, DC 265, DC 290{p}
          Minolta Dimage 1500 EX, Dimage 1500 3D{p}
          HP PhotoSmart C500, C619, C912,{p}
          Pentax EI-200, EI-2000{p}
P.S.: In this case, Digita(TM) has nothing to do with the developers
of Wordworth but is the name of a product by Flashpoint(TM).

 *New marketplace (buy & sell) for VHI-boards and -DigiCams* Due to
popular demand, we have decided to create a forum for selling and
buying VHI-boards and -DigiCams. This forum can be reached via
"Support" from the VHI Studio-Homepage. The popular VHI-forum can now
also be found there again after a short absence.

*New fxPAINT-workshop online* Yet another workshop for fxPAINT is
online. This time it covers the composition of images and the usage
of the magic stick. A must for every fxPAINT-owner! The workshop can
be found under "support" from the fxPAINT-

*VHI-Exampledriver-sourcecode online* The VHI-Standard has been
extended to support DigiCams recently. Three DigiCam- drivers are
already available. The new extensions are not yet documented and so
we decided to release the sourcecode for the CamEx-driver for
download to support the development of new drivers. The sourcecode
can also be used as a basis for the development of drivers for
videoboards.

*VHI Studio 5.2 available* As there was no time before the World of
Alternatives, the archive is released now, after the fair. The new
version offers faster MPEG-Encoding and support for MPEG 2.

*French translation of fxPAINT* Relec Hard- & Software have done a
complete translation of the fxPAINT catalog- file and a part of our
homepage-pages. If you prefer a French GUI or if you want to read our
product-information in French, have a look at their homepage.
