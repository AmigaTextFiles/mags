Just a response by Bill McEwan concerning certain voiced concerns about 
the SDK; I thought it worth passing around- Editor.

We are very excited at the response that we have received in the
first few weeks of the Amiga SDK version 1 going out into the world.
We have received lots of feedback, mostly good, some not so good, and
three particular points have come up that we would like to address
before they become common untruths.
{p} {p}
Firstly, it is true that the Amiga Foundation Layer which ships on
the SDK does not have memory protection. However, this does not mean
that Ami®, the next generation Amiga Digital Environment will not
have memory protection. A comment made in an article in the last
AmigaWorld seems to have been interpreted in such a way as to suggest
that this is the case when in fact the point being made was that
Amiga is looking at many solutions for providing robustness and
security. Ami® will provide a robust, secure environment and we will
use the most elegant and effective means to achieve this.
{p} {p}
Secondly, the End User Licence Agreement that made it into the SDK is
in error as a result of a legal misinterpretation. There is NO
ROYALTY to be paid for any application either created with the SDK or
which will run on Ami®. Amiga will be creating a scheme in which
third parties can pay a royalty to Amiga in exchange for official
Amiga certification, branding and promotion. This provides a revenue
stream to Amiga and a value add for the third party. This scheme is
entirely voluntary.
{p} {p}
The third point has been drawn as a conclusion from the first two,
namely that Amiga is abandoning the desktop market. Nothing could be
further from the truth. The announced AmigaOne will feature processor
options ranging from 600 Mhz to 1 Ghz, with other, even more powerful
devices already on the drawing board. The conclusion to be drawn from
this is either that Amiga is very committed to the desktop market or
that we are going to build one mother of a cellphone.
{p} {p}
We are committed to making the Amiga THE best computer system in the
world. Yes we are also going to go into other markets, but that does
not mean we are abandoning the desktop, the Amiga philosophy or the
loyal Amigans who have stood by the platform through the good and the
bad.
