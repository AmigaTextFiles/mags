@{fg shine} Alive Mediasoft Update@{fg text}

 We have had a very busy couple of months recently and thought you may be
interested in hearing what we have been doing and what our plans for the
next few months are...

Our main objective at the moment is releasing more good quality games.
We are happy to say that the release of the Quake add-ons for the Amiga
have been received very well. Xmen and Aftershock which we have made
readily available to the Amiga market are currently amongst out top
sellers as is the immensly popular Descent. We are continuing to source
more quality add-ons and conversions.

The re-release of Blade in the new improved CD version is making very
satisfactory progress. Since the announcements of Samba World Cup and
Putty Squad we have struggled to keep up with the demand. Although
hard-work, we find this very encouraging. We also have a nice little
over-head shoot'em up in the makings which will probably see release
this side of xmas.

As well as publishing brand new games, there are so many games that were
made for the Amiga but never saw the light of day. We aim to pick out
the best of these and release them through Alive mediasoft. We are in
talks about several titles as we speak. 2 of these we can confirm as
Cedric and Whales Voyage 2.

CEDRIC.
This is a wonderfully addictive platform game with a little dash of
something more. As well as the favourite "run about and jump on their
heads" style of play there is an underlying, larger plot involving
problem solving and clues which all add up to make up a truly playable
game.

WHALES VOYAGE 2
The sequal to the immensly popular Whales Voyage. This time you are a
space explorer travelling across the galaxies, trading with other life
forms as well as fighting to defend yourself when the need arrises. As
well as an intriguing plot and a stategic method of play, Whales Voyage
2 turns into a Doom type game when you reach the surface of a planet.
You can walk around the planet in full motion and use of your limbs, so
if you experience a bad trade for example you can pulverise your enemy!

Neither Cedric or Whales Voyage 2 have ever been released in the UK. A
full news bulletin will be sent out shortly for each game. In the
mean-time we have attatched some screen shots to wet your appetite!

Below you will find a list of our games that we either publish or
distribute.

Blade CD edition
Xmen for Quake
Aftershock for Quake
Mission Pack 1 & 2 for Quake
Quake Resurrection Pack
Malice for Quake
Kang-Fu
The Clue
Samba World Cup
Descent 68k & PPC
Doom Series 68k & PPC
Labyrinth of Time
Putty Squad (coming soon)
Whales Voyage 2 (coming soon)
Cedric (coming soon)
Abuse (coming soon)
Fightin Spirits
Black Viper
Burn Time
Whales Voyage
Spherical Worlds
UVW (Ultra Violent Worlds)

Some of these titles are our own. Some we are the distributer for the
UK. The Quake products are PC versions that we have made readily
available to the Amiga world by selling them with the required Quake
installers. Some are re-releases of popular games that have become
difficult to obtain.

@{fg shine} VaporWare Announces AmIRC 2.1@{fg text}

The eight public release of AmIRC, version 2.1, is now available!

 AmIRC is a client for the IRC Internet Relay Chat protocol written by
Oliver Wagner, also the author of VoyagerNG and Microdot II. It is
*SHAREWARE*. You can register it easily with the included VaporWare
registration utility at any of our registration sites around the world.

Although AmIRC 2.1 contains numerous more hours of work and thus is
slightly more expensive than AmIRC 1.x, there is *NO UPGRADE FEE* --
your legal AmIRC 1.x and AmIRC 2.0 keyfile will continue to work. The
free upgrade is our "Thank you!" to all the people who already
registered AmIRC 1.x, instead of using cracked versions, pirated key
files or "evaluation periods" of several months or even years.
Registrations at the AmIRC 1.x price are *no longer accepted* as of the
2.0 release.

Where to download it:
FTP:
 ftp.vapor.com,    pub/amirc/
 ftp.us.vapor.com, pub/amirc/
 ftp.de.vapor.com, pub/amirc/
 ftp.au.vapor.com, pub/amirc/
 ftp.pl.vapor.com, pub/vapor/amirc/

 AmiNet, comm/irc (soon)

 amirc_21.lzx, 852086 Bytes
 amirc_21.lha, 969738 Bytes


(Note that ftp.us.vapor.com has generally the best connectivity of the
listed mirror sites)

WWW:
http://www.vapor.com/
http://vapor.ukonline.co.uk/ (File mirror only)
http://www.meanmachine.ch/vapor/ (File mirror only)

EMail-Fileserver:
Mail to <fileserv@vapor.com>, put "SEND AMIRC" in the body.
The file will be returned uuencoded.

New features since AmIRC's last public release (2.0) include:

   o Single window mode. You can join several channels with opening just
     a single window.
   o Total queueing. Now everything which isn't urgent (like KICKS or
     MODE changes) is sent through the output queue. to reduce risk of
     being kicked by a server due to flooding.
   o Settable scrollback buffer size. The amount of text stored in a
     window's scrollback buffer is now limited; the number of lines to
     keep can be configured.
   o Vapor Update Library. Will now automagically check for available
     updates during startup, and inform you if there is one -
   o which you can automatically download, too.
   o New plugin API calls. On request by plugin authors, several new
     callbacks and functions have been implemented in the AmIRC plugin
     API.
   o Multiselect ban list window
   o openurl.library support
   o new translations done by ATO (http://ato.vapor.com/ato)
   o several bug fixes and minor improvements (for a complete list,
     refer to the history attached below)

New features since the 1.69 release include:

   o Query and channel windows can now be iconified individually to a
     "tray" window. Tray window button labels turn bold when new
     messages are received, white when a highlight occurs, and carry
     information about the number of messages in each window.
   o New low-level Plugin API. Documentation of the API is available
     from www.vapor.com or Aminet, in a separate archive. An example
     plugin, WallChop.AmiPlug, is included.
   o Server list is now a ListTree object with subgroups for different
     networks.
   o Can now use MIMEPrefs to automatically view & save files received
     via DCC. Activate the "Use MIMEPrefs to view?" or "Use MIMEPrefs to
     save?" menu options.
   o "Lag-O-Meter" (tm ;)) probes the IRC server every 30 seconds and
     shows the current lag from 0-10+ in a gauge below the userlist. The
     Info window also contains the three most recent measurements and
     the average.
   o Heavily improved logging. All channel and query windows now have an
     "L" button to the right of the input gadget, which is a toggle
     button to activate the logging to a user-specified directory.
   o "Favorites" window added to store the names of channels you use
     regularly. Click on the channel name in a window to open.
   o AmIRC now uses NList.mcc (if available) for its listviews. NList is
     written by Gilles Masson (masson@iut-soph.unice.fr).
   o Stronger CTCP flood protection.
   o DCC connections now work with Miami's SOCKS support.
   o Files received via DCC are opened in shared mode during transfer,
     so you can play or view them partially while the transfer is still
     in progress (esspecially for all you mp3 freaks out there :-)
   o DCC receives now have the options to Replace a file. Both the send
     and receive windows have Cleanup buttons, to remove old closed and
     failed connections.
   o DCCs now show the estimated remaining time of a transfer based on
     current throughput.
   o Query windows now have an N button to change the nickname the
     window is currently bound to.
   o Background color of AmIRC's main listviews can now be configured.
   o /AWAY messages are now filtered, and only shown once to avoid
     screen cluttering when talking to someone who is set /AWAY.
   o special "Invite" and "Oper" requesters
   o Can now automatically accept DCC Send requests.
   o Now sends pertinent information to query windows, such as /nick and
     /QUIT messages from that user, as well as CTCP and DCC messages.

be brought up about that person as well as a photo of themselves.

So, we need some photo's of you!!! You can send the pictures of yourself by
e-mail to:stuart@digital-images.demon.co.uk

I would appreciate it if all pictures were compressed using Lha or Lzx. Any
major picture format at any resoloution will be fine. (We will scale them
ourselves.) 

If you don't have a scanner or a Digital camera, then you can send your
photo's by post to:

Talks are still going with Psygnosis with regards to Wipeout 2097. We are
confident that we will get the necessary licencing to port Wipeout 2097 to
the Amiga. Watch this space for the latest info...

We are about to start writing a Syndicate style game. However, we still need
a few coders and graphics artists to achieve this. The coders should be able
to write an isometric graphics engine similar to that on Syndicate using a
language such as C or C++. The graphics artists should be able to draw and
model high quality objects to be included in this game. All examples of work
should be sent to:Stuart@digital-images.demon.co.uk

We would like an example of an isometric graphics engine from the coders,
and some examples of the required graphics from the graphic artists.

@{fg shine} Amiga Survivor gets newlook@{fg text}

Hello Amiga fanatics!

Well, Amiga Survivor is proving more of a success than any of us could
imagine. Our print-run increases every month and new subscribers are added to
our database daily. Even after a mere three issues!
And now everyone around the world can have a taste of it.
Amiga Survivor has recently had a complete overhaul, both the magazine, and
it's official homepage
(http://www.crystal-software.com/AmigaSurvivor/survindex.html). Go see for
yourself the new-look covers, new logos, and get information about
distributors and contents of the magazine.
Since the new look and new promotions, many stores around the planet are now
stocking issues, in the US, Canada, The UK and the rest of Europe. Have a look
at the website to see if there's a store near you! Or you can order online and
have each issue delivered to your door!

At one point in it's life, Amiga Survivor was just a games magazine, but due
to it's popularity, it has grown to covering more 'serious' items, with the
help of some ex-CU Amiga staff members. And in the coming months, AS is set to
gain more pages, and the possibility of swelling to an A4 format!

Amiga Survivor has also recently gained the rights to distribute the
incredibly popular U.S publicaton, Amiga Informer in the UK! Be one of the
first European residents to own this fine magazine by ordering it from the
Amiga Survivor website.
(http://www.crystal-software.com/AmigaSurvivor/survindex.html)

Of course, Amiga Survivor could always benefit from being even more popular,
so if you're an Amiga stockist anywhere in the world, then you could be one of
the many distributors to stock this new, popular publication.
Please note that Amiga Survivor is available via mail-order only, and not on
news-stands!

Amiga Survivor is the ONLY place to read the Work-In-Progress of Gilbert
Goodmate and the Mushroom of Phungoria (the excellent Monkey Island 3 / Disney
inspired adventure game) courtesy of Prelusion and Crystal Software.
Read the latest games reviews, previews, special features, regular articles,
and the latest Amiga news, all sandwiched between a glorious full colour
cover!

If you require any further information, then visit the website, or e-mail the
editor, Robert Iveson at: robert@survivor.enterprise-plc.com

You can subscribe online for a bulk amount of issues, or merely just the one
to give it a try. You never know, it might be just what you're looking for in
a magazine.....

Hello from clickBOOM

We have good news and bad news for you this time.


1)  Bad news first

Napalm will be slightly late.  
We had hoped to have it ready for Nov. 1, but that won't be possible.
We will inform you of the exact release date, but expect it not to be 
later than Nov. 15.
Will it be on sale at Computer '98?  We'll try our best.



2) Good news

You wanna be the coolest dude?
Going to Computer '98 and want to have the newest 
Amiga-related apparel?

Look no further -- BOOM CAP has it all.

Made out of soft flexible brushed cotton, 
this high quality embroidered cap is rounder 
and lower in style than the traditional 
cotton baseball caps.  So, not is it only ultra-comfy, 
but it's also the first item with new clickBOOM logo.

@{fg shine} Max Rally released@{fg text}

Introduction

MAX RALLY is a multi-player overhead racing game for all Amigas with at
least 2 Meg of memory. Up to four players can participate in various
types of race, against each other, against the clock or against
intelligent computer controlled cars. The following is a brief run-down
of the various areas of the game.


Championship

This is the single-player mode, where the player races against three
computer controlled cars on 20 different tracks across four terrains
(Woodland, Cosmic, Alpine and Dunes). The idea is to finish in first
position on all twenty tracks, and to also complete the Max Rally
Challenge (see below), using just five continues. If you fail to finish
first on a track, a continue is lost and the race has to be replayed.
The tracks can be raced on in any order, and offer various levels of
difficulty. It is possible to gain extra continues, either by lapping
all computer cars in a race, or completing a Max Challenge track in three
laps.


Max Challenge

In Championship, as well as completing the twenty tracks, five Max Rally
Challenge tracks must be completed. These are totally original and
unique styles of race, set on the Cosmic terrain. On these tracks, there
are no computer cars, and the screen scrolls independantly of the main
car. The aim is to complete all laps, without going off the edge of the
screen, and without falling off the side of the track. There are various
pads, placed around the tracks, moving pads, which transport your car
between different areas of the track, lap pads, and switch pads. At the
start of each lap, all switch pads are switched on, that is, lit up. In
order to complete a lap, they must all be switched off, by driving over
them. When this is done, a lap pad will be lit up, and this must then be
switched off to complete the lap. When the lap pad is swithced off, all
switch pads are turned back on for another lap. If a pad is missed, the
lap has to be done again. There are three laps in total, and extra
continues are awarded for completing the entire track without missing a
pad.


Multi-Player

Two, three, or four players can race against each other in Multi-Player
mode, across the same twenty tracks as in Championship. The normaL
multi-player races allow two-player split-screen, two-player link-up, or
four-player split-screen link-up. The link-up races allow two Amigas,
each running a seperate copy of Max Rally, to be connected via a
null-modem cable (not supplied with Max Rally).
The battle mode multi-player races allow between two and four players to
race against each other on a single screen on a single computer. The
idea of this race is to get your car to the front of the screen, while
the screen is scrolling round following all the cars. Falling off the
back of the screen results in your car being taken off the track until
someone else has won a point. Points are gained by staying on the screen
until all other cars have been eliminated. The winner of the race is the
first player to gain five points.


Time Trials

The Time Trials mode allows either one player to race against the clock,
attempting to beat previously set record laps, or for between two and
four players to compete against each other. In multi-player time-trials
mode, all players race seperately, trying to beat not only previously
set lap records, but also the other players fastest laps. The winner of
this race is the player who gets the fastest lap time.


Other Features

Max Rally allows the players to choose their own driving character, from
a selection of six. Each driver has it's own unique driving attributes,
and it is up to each player to find which one suits their style of play
most.

Also in Max Rally are two superb soundtracks, one for the title screens,
and another for when racing on the Max Rally Challenge tracks.

Max Rally requires you to use your cars braking and reversing abilities
more than most other racers, and requires constant concentration. Each
race also allows one turbo for each player, which can be used at any
time to gain on their oppenent.


Features not mentioned above


   o AGA Enhancements (eg. 256-colour title screens, smoke from cars)
   o 360° Jumps
   o Minimum amount of disk swapping (one disk swap in whole game)
   o Hard-Drive Installable
   o Large and Small jumps
   o Various surfaces (slow, skiddy, rough)
   o Areas that car can fall off track on Cosmic terrain
   o Great gameplay with an arcade feel
   o Pre-recorded demos to watch and learn from


Max Rally comes on two floppy disks and is available directly from 
Fortress for the price of £19.99.

@{fg shine} Gunbee F99 demo@{fg text}

 For many years, Valstyx was a peaceful planet in the Universe. Five
Magic Crystals owned by Lady Akiko, the princess of Valstyx, guaranteed
the power and stability of the whole planet.

 But one day things changed. Strange beasts and bizarre machines suddenly
invaded the planet. It was being taken over by Lord Khenmir's evil forces.

 In a surprisedly attack, the Soldiers were unable to defend the Royal
Palace. And while the chaos involved the kingdom, Lord Khenmir took
possession of the Five Magic Crystals... and kidnapped princess Akiko.

 Designed with the very best of Valstyx technology, you, as Kiara McGuire,
pilot the GUNBEE F-99, a mobile suit developed by the Royal Engineers
with the hope to defeat Lord Khenmir big guardians, to recover the Five
Magic Crystals and succeed in the save of the beautiful Lady Akiko.

 Gunbee is a shoot `em up, I received the demo, and, although it only
comes with level 2 you get a good idea of the feel of the game.

 Loading from disk takes ages, firstly you load the intro sequence, the
title screen, and then the game. A really annoying part is when you play
the game a second time, you see the very fancy, well drawn game over
screen (which also has to load), you get back to the title screen click
on PLAY and the whole level has to load again. It can't fill up my
massive 2mb RAM?? Maybe the game needs some RAM detection, which keeps
the necessary files in RAM, if there is enough available?

 From the screenshots on the intro you can see the commercial quality
graphics. Strong colours, neatly drawn, true professional art work! When
you get into the game the still screenshot transforms, the enemies,
naturally move, various parts of the background move; Everything Moves!!
Well, almost.

 Level 2 seems a bit light on enemies, the level isn't easy, I don't
know how far I've progressed, but I have only seen 3 different types of
enemy, these blue fish things, which are a regular occurance, light
blub type things, and green curvey things. Although I can not reconise
any of these properly, they are neatly drawn, and have a 3D feel.

 Whilst playing the game you also get music, this is good as well, a
great musician must have spent ages working on these little tunes!

 When you shoot at Smiling Clouds a bell pops out, these start off gold,
but if you shoot them they change colour;

         Gold Bell  - Points
         Blue Bell  - Speed Up
         Green Bell - Power Up
         White Bell - Shield
         Red Bell   - Firebeam
         Black Bell - Damage

 You should avoid Black Bells, but blue and green bells are particularly
useful at the start of a level as they give you more chance to actually
complete the level.

 The game is split into two parts, Honey and Story, in story mode you
have to successfully rescue lovely princess Akiko by recovering all the
Five Magic Crystals. However, in Honey mode, you can just mess around,
as it acts as a practise mode.

 I was very disapointed to see the game slow down, even on my unexpanded
A1200! God knows what it will be like on a A500. [-ed maybe you should
upgrade like the rest of us ;) ]

@{fg shine} Wasted Dreams Preview@{fg text}

 Wasted Dreams is the latest game to be born by Vulcan Software. It
is a futuristic alien adventure in the sytle of Chaos Engine with the
same view and control system. Your character is a military soldier 
qualified in defence and has been sent on a mission into space to find 
a new planet to live on, as the Earth has become corrupt with mass 
violence. After 9 long months of searching, you and the rest of the 
500 crew find a planet that can sustain life and is just the type of 
place you have been looking for. After setting up a hugh base it is time 
for some of the crew to return and tell Earth about this new planet. On 
the journey home your ship crashes and you are stranded on this new 
planet but on the opposite side from the original base.

 You are now stuck and have to find a way out, as you wonder around
you will notice items to pick up by the ship encluding a gun, medikit
plus other items of need. All around there are aliens that shoot at
you for no reason and you are in a situation of kill them before they
kill you. 

 The graphics to the game are just outstanding, I can't wait to
receive the full game for review as they are so much of a treat to
look at. The game is fast aswell on my 030 and it only needs a pretty
basic amiga to run being 68000 CPU, 3Mb of Memory (of which 2Mb must be
Chip Memory) and a 2x CD-rom. The music is also very atmosferic and will
keep you playing for a very long time.

 As usual Vulcan come up tops with another great game and be sure we'll
be bringing you the review as soon as its available to us.

@{fg shine} Light Speed@{fg text}

 Its been on T.V often enough, and I'm sure a fair few of you went to
see it at the cinema! You know what I'm taking about, the film Tron, if
you don't know already, the most famous part in Tron is where these
things race each other, but while they are racing they have these lines
which show where they have just been, if one of these things hits a line
its game over! I can't remember the plot exactly, but I'm sure Chris
(Editor) will remind me, as Tron is one of his favourite films!

 There is not a lot I can say about this game, its just plain and simple
Tron, you move about the screen, avoiding the objects, and other players
(which can either be human or computer).

 The main menu is in its own window, on its own LOW-RES screen, it looks
horrible!!!! At least use a HI-RES screen it looks soooo much better.

 You have a variety of options, from changing the palette, to player
names, controllers, and features. You actually have four players to make
use of, so in 1 player mode, you have to have three computer players.

 Its nice to see some interesting options, like Swooshes, anongst others!
Swooshes, by the way, is the Light Speed way of asking you if you want
sound FX!

 Overall, nice, simple, variety of options, horrible main menu, simply
1980's Tron...

@{fg shine} Two of a Kind@{fg text}

 When you were younger did you play a game with cards in which you had
to discover as many pairs as you could. Two of a Kind is a remake of
that game (and the PD varients that are available).

 The idea is simple, and easy, find two matching pairs and then find
some more until you have found all the matching pairs! Boring? Well, not
really, its great for a quick burn every now and again, you can even
have a two player option where you are fighting head-2-head!

 You get a variety of different options, you can choose how big your
mouse pointer is, LARGE or normal, and you can specify if you want the
pairs you have discovered to darken or go black, Woooo!

 You have 3 difficultly modes, EASY, NORMAL and HARD, none of which are
challenging, but great fun for kids!

 The author has really tried to make this good, and it is good, although
it was made in 1994! Whats nice to see on the bigger grids (not EASY
difficulty) is animated squares! Kool eh?

 The game has a really happy atmosphere, its great for kids, and partly
provides the Amigian with his educational demands!

@{fg shine} Minnesota Smith's Aztec Adventure@{fg text}

 This is one of those interative fiction games, know to us commeners as
a text-based adventure. That author claims that you don't actually play
Minnesota, you take the very important part of Anna. The game is
surposed to be played as if you are back at base-camp talking to
Minnesota over the radio. Well, thats an interesting way to describe
what first appears to be a dull text-based adventure.

 Umm, the first problem I noticed was the game doesn't adjust itself to
your overscan, and because i'm still using my Amiga on a 14" T.V set I
couldn't see what I was typing because it was cut off at the bottom. Does
anyone want to buy me a monitor?

 If you read the instructions which are conveniently in AmigaGuide and
ASCII text, you notice a rather long introduction, that was a waste of
time, does anyone read the intro anyway?

 The adventure was made for a bit of fun, and the author has spent time
putting descriptions on everything you come across. But this still
doesn't help you when you are trying to follow the complete solution,
which I think is wrong.

 The usual commands are all there, take, drop, examine, dig, push, pull,
eat, drink, in and out. If your new to text based adventures you may get
lost, so its best to write these down because they come in handy when
you don't know what to do!

 This was written using CAG adventure creation system, i've never heard
off it, but it lets you load and save games, so thats a great feature.

 There is no sound, or graphics, but if you what to lose some sleep on a
puzzle which has sixty rooms and a maze, go ahead and download!

@node "gr6" "Kang Fu"

@{fg shine} Kang Fu@{fg text}

 Kang Fu comes free with PFS 2 which will be in for a full review next
month, to wet your whistle I've reviewed it for you, check out my
comments on this game.

 Kang Fu is a platform game with a Kangaroo as the main character. The
idea is to save the baby kangaroos known as Joey's. As in all games it
is not so simple, there are a bunch of evil guys after you and to ruin
your plan to save all the Joey's. Obviously it would be wrong to pit
one Kangaroo against all these nastys so the games developers have 
be generous and thrown in some weapons for you to use, bombs, guns
and boomerangs are just some of the extra weapons you can collect to
fight off the baddies in your quest for glory. 

 The way the game has been made is actually quite good, AGA pictures,
smooth scrolling, hires with a screenmode of 640 * 280. The loading
pictures and before game pictures are excellent scans of cute kangaroos 
with some other hand art pictures thrown in.

 We come to the graphics ingame and the whole story changes, the
graphics in places are not so hot, some are ok-ish but mostly they
have a rushed feel to them, pity as the rest of the game seems to have
had time taken over it. The collision detection isn't all to good either,
you can jump on top of something and still find your feet halfway
in to what is supposed to be a solid object.

 The game isn't really that exciting and you will notice some flaws
that could have been ironed out before publishing the game, if you
have small children and you want a non-violent game then this game
is recommended for them, on the other hand if your over 11 then i'd
say give this one a miss.

 From the title it is clear to see that this is another P.D quiz
program, it took the author 3 hours to make, on a rainy day. It has 116
questions all about our favourite computer; The AMiGA!

 The intro is a bit dodgy, a quick hand drawn picture and a flashing
copyright notice! Cool? The game is a little bit better, but there's
nothing special, you get questions, and you try your best to answer
them, answer so many questions, get a rating, and the program
automatically quits.

 Whats great about this, is the ability to add your own questions by
following the instructions in the docs and saving the result as a text
file, now all you have to do is load the program with a CLI argument as
name-of-file.txt. Simple!!

 Theres not much I can say, its a quiz, the main program is on a low-res

116 question database!

@{fg shine} FULL solution Relics of Deldroneye II@{fg text}

The Island of Debreen 
=====================
 
 Relics of Deldroneye II - 'Island of Debreen' is an adventure filled
with a sense of mystery.  And such an aura can be shattered forever
by reading the entire solution to a game before even playing it.  It is
advised the following solution should be used to help you when your
final effort is a futile one.  Anything less than that and you are
denying yourself the rewards that come with completing a game such as
this on your own.  However, if you want to see it all, and see it now
then please read on...

 You take control of Falcon on the bridge of his new spaceship, and have
narrowly escaped collision with an unknown vessel at the expense of all
your fuel and reserve power.  You decide to steal the nessesary power
from the unknown vessel by manouvering your ship to its side and cutting
your way in.

1. Moving the Ship
------------------

 Use the laserpen on the Power In socket on the console to active the
view screen.  Look at the view screen to read the situation.  Now use
the laserpen on the Power Out socket to retrieve your valuable power.
Move right to the engine room and open the engine panel.  Feed power
from your laserpen into the engine to activate it.  Make your way to
the navigation room and open the PIV Door.  Feed your last unit of
power from the laserpen into the computer via the Power Input Valve.
Talk to the computer and it will eventually feed some vectors into the
main computer back on the bridge.  Before leaving the room, open the
power output valve door and restore the power to your laserpen by taking
it back.  Go to the bridge and new vectors will be available, so hit
the button on the console and the ship should move to the calculated
vector, next to the Debreen vessel.

2. Forced Entry
---------------

 From here on in, you'll need a spacesuit to survive your exploration of
the Debreen craft.  Go down the corridor from the junction between the
navigation room and the bridge, and enter the suit-o-matic.  You should
now be adorned with metal clothing.  Enter the docking bay, press the
Borble and make your way to the docks bay exit.  The huge Debreen outer
wall looms to cover the whole entrance to the docking bay.  Use the last
unit of power from your laserpen to cut a hole in the weak part of the
wall.  Enter the newly created hole and find yourself in a small alcove.
Move to the automatic doors and enter.  In this long corridor, and at
the foot of the door you have just emerged is a small green device.  Kick
this device to brake it.  A small magnet will come loose, which you must
collect.  Now continue down the corridor and have a chat with the robot
sitting in the tubing.

3. The Electric Ladder
----------------------

 If you continue to the far left of this corridor and enter the door, you
will find a room with a very tasty ladder.  Unfortunately, when you climb
it you will get stunned.  Kick the panel below the slot and look inside.
The lever is too far so we need to reach it somehow.  Go to the next
room at the end of the next corridor along, and find the corpse of a
dead alien explorer.  On its remains are some gloves and a belt.  Take
both, and then use the magnet on the belt to form a magnet on a string
style tool.  Return to the cracked panel and fish out the lever.  Use
this lever on the slot to deactivate the defences of the zone.  This
includes the power supply to the ladder!

4. The Turret
-------------

 Ascending the ladder to the top will reveal that the Debreen craft has
been welded to the hull of an altogether different ship.  This new area
is guarded with a trained laser turret, the walls are clearly made of
heat resisting material, where the floor is not and is falling apart.
Try and get to the door, and you'll get zapped and fall to the bottom of
the ladders.  Don't worry, the spacesuit is designed for such impacts.
You will find it very difficult to come to harm.  Half way up the ladder
you will find an alcove with an empty energy cell.  Take this from the
wall and climb the ladder.  Show this energy cell to the turret and it
will rather casually fire at it, er, and you.  When you regain your
bearings, at the bottom of the ladder, the energy cell will be on the
floor next to you, FULL!  Return the energy cell to its socket, and you
should have stabilized the laser turret, and its mode will change to
'peace' green.  Open the newly available door, and enter.

5. Metal Hell
-------------

 Again, a third ship has been welded to this Debreen junk-heap, but due
to a misscalculation, the floor was placed thirty-feet lower than would
have been ideal.  Falcon falls and destroys the only mobile robot in the
complex when he lands IN IT!  When the dust settles, rip the pipe off
the wall and enter the open door to the right.  In this dark room, take
the Optiwire and container hidden in the junk, use the pipe to crowbar
open the dome to steal the brain of the robot.  Have a pleasant chat with
the active immobile robot, then nick his arm.  Exit this spooky place
and return to the first metal room.  Use the pipe to crowbar open the
door and enter.  Have a chat with the guard robot, and when he starts to
bore you enter the adjoining open door.  take the tape from the dispenser
and have a look at the dome.  It needs repairing.  Use the tape on the
optiwire to make a strong sticky wire.  You can use this strong sticky
wire to reconnect the leads leading to the dome.  Return to the guard
room and inform the robot he can have a break, but alas he has not moved
for so long he has rusted.  Come to the rescue and return to the first
metal room.  use the container to collect the oil from the right wall,
and give this to the guard robot.  He will squeek his way to the rest
room for a very long vacation.  Use the robot arm you stole from the
secuirty robot to activate the palm scanner near the gold door.  The
doors will open and you can enter.  Inside, a brainy blob on a pillar
greets you with kind words.  Give him the brain you took from the other
robot and accept his advice, and return to the first metal room.  Try
using the laserpen on the metal door on the north wall.  The effort was
hopeful, but you will see your efforts fail.  Return to the blob with
this news and he will replicate a device which will enable you to
charge your laserpen to full power.  By returning to the metal door,
and firing the laser, you realise doing so would be dangerous.  The
shiny surface would reflect the laser.  Return to the guard room and
laser open a panel hidden in a slight indent on the north wall.  Take
the sandpaper like substance and use it on the door to make it rough.
Now fire the laserpen to gain access to the next segment of the Debreen
vessel.

6. The Huamin Conflict
----------------------

 An opportunity to relax and enjoy the comic lunacy of two crazy alien
ghostlings.  Simply take the spangley object from the wall in the left
room from where you entered the maze, and continually talk from one
alien to the other, twisting the facts and conveying mis-information
to your new alien friends.  Eventually they will destroy each other in
an invisible fight to the death.  As the ghostlings disappear, so will
the obstruction and you can use the spangley key object on the floor
of the room with the eye.  The eye will scan you and the door will
open, awaiting your eager entry.

7. Destination Debreen
----------------------

 Cross the spacewalk to the large doors and talk to the small sphere set
into the door.  The centurion will not open the doors.  Go to the right
and take the pole from the twisted piping.  Go to the far left and have
a look at the junction box.  Try using the pipe you collected from the
metal room to pull it off the wall and it will break under the pressure.
Now try the much stronger space metal of the Debreen, and watch the
junction box fall off the wall with ease.  When you return to the gate,
a maintenance robot is busy finding the error, whicn you recently
created.  He has had to open a small door to get partly outside, and you
get leap into the gap without the centurion looking.  Once inside, make
your way through the sandy corridors until you reach a room with a
crater, and a metalic object imbedded in the ground.  Look for a button
different from the rest and press it.  The Debreen will be brought from
stasis, and revived.  Unfortunately, you have left the space-port open
and have let out all the special air the Debreen need to breath.  He
is slowly pleading for his life, so you must quiz him on how exactly to
close the door and return to the port you entered.  Find the hidden
button by walking around the port-entrance and then press it.  Return
to the crater room and follow the Debreen into the newly revealed
secret door to the his control center.

 When you enter the room, a large wall mounted display shows in vivid
detail the evil sight a Medivian Nose.  The nose, horrifically, being
firmly attatched to a battleship and in the mood for destruction.  It
fires three plasma bolts simultaniously and rocks the entire Debreen
vessel.  Talk to the Debreen and assess your situation, and reassess it!
Exit his patient abode, and continue right until you cannot progress
any further.  Find the hidden door, and open it.  Inside, you will
find a garbage bat, which opens in the barren void of space.  You can
also see the real, unmagnified Medivian ship floating about.  Take the
green orb from the garbage bay power system and place it in the small
Deldroneye Weapon on the floor.  Using the small pressure socket, the
green orb will slot into place, and then run back to the Debreen
Control Center.  Ask the Debreen to activate the Garbage system and it
will activate, instead, the powerful Deldroneye laser.

 And as the passive Debreen seemed about to refuse the request, and in
a language Falcon understood well, the strange creature said, "OK...
Let's Fry'em!".  No sooner had Falcons amusement formed a grin wider
than his own face, the Deldroneye laser was ripping across the small
distance to the Medivian ship...

...the rest of the story opened Falcons eyes to further truths about
the Relics Of Deldroneye, but you'll just have to complete the game and
read THAT for yourself.

@{fg shine} Games reviews and what there score means@{fg text}

 Games are reviewed mostly on playability and how long they will last
you, although some big games with fancy graphics might be expected to
get good reviews it is not always the case. A small 10k game might
get a better overall score than a 1Mb game. It is not that the 1Mb
game isn't any good it's just that the playablility might be non
exsistant and there is no point in downloading a huge file if it
will last a couple of minutes and you will only run it to show off
to friends.

 90%+    -  AIO GOLD (amazing)

 70-89%  -  Nice but some let downs

 50-69%  -  Not to good but it'll do

@node "ur1" "Murderer"

@{fg shine} Murderer@{fg text}

  This task killer utility sets a high goal for itself: remove a running task
AND close all the windows and screens opened by it, and give back the prompt
if it was run from shell.

  The AmigaOS lacks resource tracking that is essential if you want to kill a
task and properly clean up everything it has done. Therefore no program can
safely kill tasks in the current form of the operating system.

  If some locked up or crashed program is consuming too much memory, task
killers won't do any good. But if some buggy program locks up consuming all
the CPU power it can get, you'll have to try something to make it stop unless
you want to reset. This is where the task killers step in.

  Murderer is a very simple program; only one file and the readme. When you
run Murderer you get a window with a list of all the running tasks and
processes. All you have to (or CAN) do is select a task and click "End Task".
If all goes well, the task will be removed. After a few test kills it had
successfully removed the tasks themselves, but it didn't close any windows or
even give the shell prompt back. Once it even locked itself up after I had
killed a task that patched one library function, but other running programs
continued to work fine!

  So, unfortunately Murderer fails in what would have made it different
from all the other task killers. For those who don't have a task killer
program yet this can be a nice little program sitting in C:, but there are
task killers that have more features, such as Commander in the Executive
software package.

@node "ur2" "Swipe"

@{fg shine} Swipe@{fg text}

  Remember File ID Extractor Deluxe? It was reviewed in AIO issue 16 with a
score of 80%, and the author has made another excellent utility. Swipe is an
enhanced version of the standard AmigaDOS command "delete", and it's probably
the best program I've downloaded the whole month!

  Like so many others, I extract all the downloaded archives that I have, to
Ram Disk (when I get around to it ;). After testing them for a while I decide
to install them or throw them away, but nevertheless I end up deleting them
from Ram: to save memory. But what more annoying is there than to see the
deletion stop with a beep & flash because the program locked some directory in
some way making it non-deletable! Often they add assigns for libs: or fonts:
to the directories in Ram:. This is probably what annoyed the author, Kai
Haseloh in the first place, because Swipe will detect and remove any assigns
pointing to the directories to be deleted.

  But Swipe is a lot more than that! Of course you can either make it stick to
the given directory, or affect its subdirectories also. You can also preserve
a file or a directory and its contents, or just a directory and delete its
contents. You can make it preserve all directories and delete only the files,
or select a pattern for the files to be deleted (no matter what dir they are
in). There is also an interactive mode for using with directory tools and a
setting for the verbosity of the program's output, and of course you can make
it beep when done deleting.

  But the best feature of all I saved to the last: the SwipeRAM switch. All
you need to do is type "Swipe swiperam" and it will delete everything from
Ram:, removing the assigns etc, but it will preserve the system directories
ENV, T and Clipboards plus the disk.info. Previously I had to select the files
and directories to be deleted manually in Workbench in order to preserve the
system directories, but now it's only one command! :) And maybe I'll also make
an alias so I'll only have to type "wr"... :)

  Something that would be nice is the ability to delete all directories
matching a pattern (currently the pattern is only for files) or deleting empty
directories too if they match the filepattern. The only thing I think is
really missing, is preserving multiple files or directories (perhaps a
preservepattern... :). But still, Swipe is an excellent utility and I will be
using it a lot :)

@{fg shine} Abbreviation and Country Code assistants for AmIRC@{fg text}

  As an enthusiastic IRCer, I am always looking for ways to make my IRC
sessions smoother and easier. Sometimes people use abbreviations that I don't
remember ever seeing (like "GMTA"), or people are from countries whose country
codes seem totally unfamiliar to me (such as .gh).

  Of course every self-respecting IRC channel has a bot, and if the bot has
any self-respect it knows all the country codes :). But if it isn't responding
or you are visiting some channel that doesn't have such a bot, the Country
Code Assistant script becomes very useful (assuming you want to know where
people are from ;). All you have to do is type "/cc gh" in the case of this
example, and the script will instantly tell you that the country is Ghana. I
guess the script knows every country code there is, but I can't be 100% sure
because new countries are born every now and then.

  The second script, Abbreviation Assistant, is more useful to me because I
haven't seen a bot that knows as many abbreviations as this. The script
contains 139 abbreviations, including everyday-abbreviations as well as very
rare ones. Of course the list isn't complete since there must be several
hundred "real" abbreviations and people think of more all the time, but to
me there were well over 50 abbreviations that I still don't remember :).
Using the Abbreviation Assistant is as simple as with the previous script; if
I wanted to know what that "GMTA" means, I'd just type "/ab gmta" and it
would tell me that "GMTA = Great minds think alike".

  Installing the assistants is quite simple: just copy two files to AmIRC's
Rexx directory and run two commands in AmIRC. After that you'll just have
to remember what the command was to see that particular country code... ;)

  But, nothing is perfect, including these scripts. I don't have an official
list of country codes where I could check but the Country Code Assistant seems
to have no errors, whereas the Abbreviation Assistant has a couple typos that
cause at least three abbreviations to "disappear" from the list. The ARexx
code isn't very efficient either, but fortunately it doesn't matter a lot
since they are quite simple and short. Despite the little deficiencies, they
are both very useful scripts and are now installed to my AmIRC (even if I
removed all the obvious abbreviations just to boost my ego ;).

@{fg shine} Mouse pointer presets@{fg text}

  I'm not ever quite sure if this is an utility, but since it was in the dir
util/mouse in Aminet I thought what the heck and reviewed it :) It's something
very simple: a collection of mouse pointers :) After looking at them, I found
some of them quite amusing and I now have a Superman-pointer in use until I
get bored of it; it's a funny-looking little man flying up & left and the
busy-pointer is the "S" logo :)

  Among a few others there were a couple Batman-pointers, a PacMan, the flag
of the USA, two versions of Galaga and one Star Trek (as the busy pointers;
most of the normal states look more or less like arrows :). And as I said, the
Superman is my absolute favourite ;)

  The pointers have a small problem too. Most of them have the hot spot a few
lines below the top line, which means that (at least on my OS3.0 machine) if
you move the pointer all the way to the top of the screen, it stays still for
the last few lines while the actual pointer position moves (so you have to aim
"blind" the few topmost lines :). There is just blank space above the hot
spot, so it would be easy to fix it if the pointer prefs program was a bit
cleverer, but now I had to copy the image to clipboard, paste it in a paint
program and cut it out without any empty space around it and then paste that
back to the prefs program. And the same procedure for the busy pointer! :I
But the pointer is so funny that it doesn't matter much ;)

 Utils are not marked on how good they are compared to other utils,
they are marked by usefulness and what purpose they serve. As there
are so many different utils that do so many different things it is
hard to review something like MUI and then when reviewing a program
like a WB clock say it wasn't up to the standard of MUI. This is why
it is not possible to have a Top Ten list for utils.

@{fg shine} Interview with Peter McGavin@{fg text}

 This month we spoke to Peter McGavin of ADoom fame, basically the
man who brought Doom to the Amiga! If you would like to see a certain
person interviewed just let us know.

CS = Chris Seward 
PMG = Peter McGavin 

CS : Would you tell the AIO readers a little about yourself firstly,
who you are,

PMG : I'm in my 40s, I'm a New Zealander and I have both maths and
computer science degrees.  I spend most of my time looking after a
small LAN of Unix workstations and PCs at a scientific research
institute, as well as carrying out some numerical modelling work.

> how you came to use the Amiga etc.

Back in 1986 or 1987, a workmate brought his new Amiga 1000 to work.
I was very impressed with its multitasking, networking and graphics
capabilities.  The operating system supported message passing and
semaphores just like I studied in computer science.  The CPU could do
other tasks while waiting for the disk drive, keyboard and similar
I/O, unlike PCs of the day.  Multitasking allowed network software to
run in the background without any nasty hacks.  Indeed, our Sun
workstation disks were accessible as icons on the Workbench using
Commodore's NFS software and ethernet.  I was also impressed by the
autoconfiguration mechanism for hardware expansion.  Later my brother
bought an Amiga 500 which I programmed when he wasn't using it.  Then
I bought my own Amiga 3000 in 1991, which I have now expanded to PPC.

CS : What gave you the idea to convert the doom source code to 
work on the amiga?

PMG : In 1993/1994 I fought a losing battle in Usenet news over
whether DOOM is "possible" on the Amiga.  I convinced myself that
chunky to planar conversion is not a significant problem with a fast
CPU, and I couldn't see why the main rendering process would be any
slower to fastmem than equivalent speed PCs.  When the DOOM source
code was finally released, I jumped at the chance to prove it.

CS : Did you have any previous programming knowledge or just think 
i'll try compile that and iron out the bugs?

PMG : I have previous programming knowledge.  However, DOOM is a well
written piece of work and there weren't many bugs to iron out, apart
from those I introduced myself.

CS : It was roughly around Christmas time when you released the first
version of ADoom, was this a christmas present come true :)?

PMG : Well it was just lucky for everyone else it corresponded to my
Christmas break and I didn't have much else to do.  Normally I
wouldn't have time for a project like this.

CS : There have been around 6 other ports of the doom source code to
the Amiga after yours, what do you think about these 'copying' your
idea?

PMG : I don't mind at all.  Some of them came out before mine, by the
way.  I just wish they would release their source code like I did.

CS : All of the doom ports have their own advantages and disadvantages,
some suit some computers and others are tailored to different spec
machines.  Wouldn't it be better to get in touch with the other authors
and make a monster doom port with all the features in one program?

PMG : Currently network games across platforms can fail because
different versions of DOOM support different features.  Ideally there
would be just one master source covering all platforms and all
features --- something like the Richard Stallman's GNU project
perhaps.  Versions compiled from the same source would be compatible
across platforms.  ADoom, with its various new features, is supposed
to compile for Unix/X-Windows as well as for the Amiga, but I haven't
tried it, so it probably doesn't...  Many of the PC DOOM enhancements
seem to be moving away from this ideal, i.e, far too much 80x86 asm
code with no corresponding C source.  Sorry I don't have time to
coordinate a really large project.

CS : Have you written any programs of your own or done any other
conversions?

PMG : I've written lots of programs.  On Aminet there are Spectrum
Emulator v1.7, CyberAnim, Flick and a crude Amiga port of PCEmu, for
examples.

CS : Will we be seeing any ports of other games from various platforms
to the Amiga by yourself?

PMG : It depends on whether I can legally get the source code, how
much spare time I get and how motivated I am.  We'll see.

CS : There was a sudden craze of game ports from other computers
like Doom, Quake and Myst etc. We are also going to see Z from bitmap
brothers aswell as other PC/Mac games, do you think on a whole 
porting games is a good idea or can it ruin actual original amiga idea
games?

PMG : I like to see good PC games ported to the Amiga, but it's even
better the other way around :)

CS : What do you think of the next generation Amigas? and the annoucement
Amiga Inc made about the developers platform being based on PC hardware?

PMG : I wish they'd release new hardware/software instead of just
talk.

CS : What would you personally like to see in the new Amigas?

PMG : I want to see other platforms blown away by speed, capability,
ease of use, OS, software and price.  I suggest a low-end Amiga with
approximately the following specs:

    Same physical size/price as an A500 --- maybe separate keyboard;
    PowerPC or another high volume RISC CPU, must be a chip with a
        future;
    Sockets for at least a couple of SIMMs up to 32 Mb each, say,
        64-bit data bus if possible;
    CDROM (bootable);
    Moderate size HD (also bootable);
    Sound/clock on motherboard;
    PCI expansion slot (or 2);
    PCMCIA expansion slot (or 2);
    Use any PCI gfx card that supports video frequencies as well as
        higher frequencies;
    Parallel/serial/floppy/mouse/joystick external expansion ports,
        or maybe USB;
    AmigaOS/Workbench ported to RISC CPU --- not emulated, not Unix;
        (Who's sitting on the AmigaOS/Workbench source code?  Look
         what happened when the DOOM source code was released!)
    Boot ROM is just a low-level booter; kickstart libraries on disk;
    680x0 Amiga emulation software, including the ability to call
        680x0 libraries from PPC code.

Higher-end Amigas would support multiple/faster CPUs, more PCI/PCMCIA
slots, CPU caches, maybe Zorro slots, more space inside for drives,
etc.

A major problem is building an initial software base, so there must be
development tools making it straightforward to port from any other
platform.  On the other hand, a handful of mind-blowing games could be
enough to get the new system off its feet.

A machine like this could also run Linux, maybe MacOS, BeOS, WinNT,...

It should have all been done in 1994.

CS : How do you feel about the Amiga situation in general is like in New
Zealand?

PMG : Unfortunately there seems to be very little Amiga support left
in New Zealand.  It's still there if you look hard enough.

CS : Any comments for other people thinking of converting software?

PMG : Go for it!

Regards, Peter.

run out of ideas its just that as it was the last issue of CuAmiga I
thought i'd review it as a tribute to the hard work and effort put in
by the CuAmiga team.

 The first thing that strikes you is the cover, as a joke it is upside 
down and a big foot is crushing the title CuAmiga. Big letters on the
front page say 'LAST ISSUE EVER' 'get it while you can' and that is the
truth! it is the last issue of a great magazine.

 The content is of its usual size and I was slightly disappointed to see
to normal page limit to 107, they could have thrown in a couple of
extra pages for the last issue. Saying that, the content is of high
standard and they certainly didn't slack for the last issue, if anything
they put in more effort to make it truely one of the best issues of
CuAmiga for a long time.

@{b}The magazine:@{ub}

 From front to back...
 
 We start at the contents presented by Tony Horgan giving his last
editorial and all the usual content type of things. The editorial
names have encluded their nicknames adding to the humour in most
cases. Then we pass onto the News section, the top news story is
of course that CuAmiga is to close giving the FAQ of why it will
close etc. There are a whole host of other new storys encluding
Schindler talks, H&P in software explosion and Amiga gets educational.

 Next we find whats on the CD or coverdisk and also how to use the
free Cinema 4d on the cover cd/disk. We then have the 'Bye, Bye,
baby...' feature which gives reasons why its closing, things they
always wanted to say, thanks and letters from various well respected
Amiga companys giving their feelings on the Cu closure. Then a section
dedicated to everyone why has worked on CuAmiga in a main place, with
pictures and what they are doing now.

 One of the best things about this issue is they have got an interview
with Fleecy Moss spilling the most information he could. Now that
CuAmiga has gone they give you a little bit of info about alternitive
printed magazine which are worth a read, I'd choose AIO myself ;)
The a bill gates halloween mask (where they pushed for articles!?)
Part 2 of the networking feature is to be read and then onto a
special feature about the demo Scene world on the Amiga, how it
started, words from people on the Scene and other interesting things.

 At page 44 we reach the games section giving the last ever Screenscene
showing the latest games like PuttySquad, Wasted Dreams and Lambda. A
review of the Sixth Sense CD and two new quake packs raps up the games
reviews. Tips central and then the Explorer 2260 diary part 4 (if the
Founding Worlds people are reading you can happily continue the diary
in AIO if you want.) 

 We hit TechScene at page 52. First off is a review of the Netconnect
2 package from Active Technologies, Newsrog, Rexecute and the new
Power CD-R Writer are reviewed. Onto the Ateo A1200 Tower and also
the AteoBus and Pixel64 are put through there paces, we then finish
off with a review of the Kodak DC210 Zoom digital camera.

 PD.net comes next with reviews of Myzar, ExView 1.3, VWM 1.5 and
Top Tunes. PD.post gives us reviews of Complete C, Twiddlers Disk 7,
Mini Tiles, Revenge AGA, Music Bugs and lastly AmigaDOS Guide V2.5.
Art Gallery with 4 pictures comes next and then the regular article
of User Groups.

 After that we come to AmigaWorkshop with tutorials on C Programming,
Soundlab, Emulation. Also in the AmigaWorkshop section is the Surf's
up news pages, Surf of the Month, Reviews Index, Q&A, guide to all
amiga things A to N and lastly Techno Tragedies which funnily is on
CuAmiga itself. In between that they have crammed Wired World, Letters
and the last ever points of view. The magazine is then at its end.

@{b}The CD:@{ub}

 As usual the CD is excellent, it is crammed full of exciting things
that everyone can get hold of free. The main program on the CD is
Cinema 4D, full and free to Cu readers. There is a huge section
devoted to every goodbye letter the received and some other goodbye
things. All the regular directorys can be found on the CD. Some things
to look out for are a Wasted Dreams demo, Napalm demo, Putty Squad
demo, Evils Doom SE demo, Loads of PPC software, Online and everything
else that is on the CD!

@{b}Overall@{ub}

 The October 1998 issue of the CuAmiga with CD number 27 is something
noone should miss out on. There are some great articles to be read
and some excellent game demos on the CD. Make sure you don't miss it!

@{fg shine} Digital Images Information@{fg text}

 Digital Images is a new company dedicated to software development for 
the Amiga. Our aim is to bring the Amiga back onto everybody's desktop's 
and to bring it back into common use in both the home and the office. We 
are also considering developing business software such as spreadsheets 
etc. The first of our original titles is called Space Station 3000. Space 
Station 3000 is a business/strategy sim which also contains action and 
space combat. This title is near completion and should be released very 
soon. We are going to port some of the PC's most popular titles to the 
Amiga such as Wipeout 2097. We are currently talking to Psygnosis regarding 
the release of this game on the Amiga. We are very positive that we will 
get the licencing for this excellent 3D racing game. After we have ported 
Wipeout 2097 to the Amiga, we intend to port other titles such as the 
brilliant Tomb Raider series and other popular titles. We are hoping to 
have Wipeout 2097 released by the end of January '99 at the latest. 

For more information regarding Digital Images, you can see the Digital
Images Website on:

@{fg shine} The Strange Case of the Folded Floppy@{fg text}

Please note that this story is true and is not made up for a cheap 
laugh, although that's all it will get - probably.

Right, here we go...

        I once had a mate, and still do, who worked in my local 
computer shop.  It was first thing on monday morning and he'd just 
opened up, when a big bloke stormed in, slamming the door, waving a 
computer game box about, going slightly red in the face and was 
slightly out of breath.

        "I bought this game, from this very shop on Saturday," he 
   protested, throwing the box on the counter, "And I'm very upset to 
   say that the disks don't work" He said slapping his hand on hips.

        "Oh dear," my friend replied. "Oh dear, indeed." the man 
continued, going slightly redder.  "In fact, not only don't the 
disks work, but they've broken my disk drive too." He proclaimed.  
"The drive was fine until I started to install the bleeding 
game and now it just refuses to work an makes a sort of grinding 
noise."

        My mate tried to calm the clearly upset man saying that the 
chances of a floppy disk physically breaking a disk drive are 
seriously remote, but this bloke was having not of it.

        It was only when he removed the lid of the game box, that the 
awful truth began to dawn.

        "Er.." my mate said, interrupted the ranting man.  "How big 
would you say your disk drive is - roughly?"  "Im not sure, this PC 
lark in all new to me" The man said, "I'd say it was about 3 
inches, or there about - at a guess, why?"

        "But these disks are five-and-a-quarter inch floppies" said 
my friend.

        "I know," said the man. "I had to fold them several times 
to make them fit and even then it was a bit of a squeeze..."

        Well, that's a typical PC owner for you - isn't it?

@{fg shine} Web of the month@{fg text}

Dr Strange, Web Wanderer

 Well, here it is, my first comlumn for AIO. So, what is this thing?  
Well, I go around that rather large collection of virtual real estate we 
call the Internet and pick out five choice sites that you might be 
interested in, one of which will be my Pick Of The Month (TM). They might 
be Amiga related, computer, or just general interest; you just never know 
with the good Doc. Enough talk, here we go.

@{B}No Amiga To Waste@{UB} - http://thunderstorms.org/NATW

This first one is, naturally enough, Amiga related. A meeting place for 
Amiga users and potential developers, if you have an idea for a piece of 
software or other new product, then just post it here and some alert and 
ambitious programer just might see it and do something about it. A great 
place for the two to meet.

@{B}Lurker's Guide TO Babylon 5@{UB} - http://www.ntua.gr/Lurk

If you're a Babylon 5 fan (and if you aren't, then you've been living 
under a prayer mat in east India), what between the characters, Toaster 
effects, and plot, then this is THE place to go. Episode Scheduals, info 
on characters, races, and the Babylon 5 universe, episode descriptions 
(including remarks by Mr S. himself), and too much more to list here. Try 
it out.

@{B}Bill Gates Hate Gallery@{UB} - http://www.enemy.org/gallery

The title here says it all. Pics, animations, cartoons, and what not all 
geared to poking fun at our favorite power-mad psycho-nerd. Good for a 
laugh, but be prepared to wait for all those images to load unless you 
have a fast modem.

@{B}Harmony Central@{UB} - http://www.HarmonyCentral.com

If you're into music, be it computer, musical instruments, Midi, or 
anything else, then there is no better place to look. From industry 
news, , new products, keyboards, software, effects, articles, components, 
books,...  Well, you get the idea. And if this isn't enough, they have 
links to even more music oriented sites.


@{b}Pick Of The Month:@{ub}

@{b}Computer Stupidities@{ub} - http://www.rinkworks.com/stupid

This one is my Pick Of The Month for the simple reason that I've spent a 
solid week going back there and I STILL haven't finished.

We've all heard them, those unbelieveable stories of what some elements 
of the brain-dead general public do to their computers, the Cd-Rom drink 
holder that sort of thing. Well, within this site are stories that makes 
the CD-Rom cup-holder look intelligent. They're all here, from the guy 
who cleaned out the dust in his CD-ROm by washing it with soap and water, 
to tech support nightmares that will you pulling out your hair in fits 
of indignant frustration.

Everything in this site is categorized by the type of computer stupidity, 
be it hardware, software, tech support, modems, hard drives, and about 
20 other categories. All are true stories (you just can NOT make this 
stuff up) handed in by other people who frequent the site, with more than 
a few that make you wonder if there shouldn't be a bottom limit on IQ 
to still be called Human.

So, if you're feeling low and want to feel like you're a super-genius, or 
if you have horror stories of your own you want to submit, then try this 
place out. From the person who thought that formatting a 3.5" sloppy meant 
ripping that hard outer sheel off before sticking the flimsey round thing 
in the drive, to those that seem to think that every software application 
out there is called Windows (as opposed to Excell, Word, etc.), there's 
no end of fun here.

Well, that's all for now; I'm going back to Computer Stupidities to have 
some more fun!
