Hello Paul,
{p} {p}
A little problem I hope maybe you can steer me out of.
{p} {p}
System:{p}
Pioneer 24xscsi Cdrom connected via Surf Squirrel+Internet Access{p}
A1200T 060/233ppc+Blizzardvision 82mb Ram(16/64){p}
Seagate 1gig hd.{p}
Usual Fan&heatsink on Permedia Chip
{p} {p}
Games all work fine e.g. HereticII/Quake-Malice.
When installing off the cdrom as it gets going quite fast it freezes up and
crashes the system,but if I press to abort every now &again but say no to
carry on it gets me through,which is how I managed to get HereticII on.
{p} {p}
Perhaps it might just be the Drivers for the Surfsquirrel, I have tried
changing the cache /buffers etc but it seems to make no difference
I think I have the latest Drivers.Saying that I have tried other Drivers
Cachecdfs&Amicdfs which give the same results.

I did not have the Problem when using a Classic SQuirrel but a relation has
the same problem on their system (A1200+8mb ramboard+12xscsi Toshiba)
The 12xcdrom was mine and it had the same problem.

Hello Mark,
{p} {p}
I thought of some things you should try.
{p} {p}
SCSI can be a pain, in that when it screws
up, it only (usually) acts erratically (doesn't fail totally), and you
can end up going in circles wondering what's going on.
{p} {p}
Firstly, termination MUST be on both
ends of the cable, meaning usually the host adapter (this is
built in to the adapter, and you usually can't change it) and either
the device on the end (you set a jumper/install some resistors) or a
terminator on the end. There are two types of terminators you can get;
active and passive. Active is better, but I've never had any trouble
with passive terminators. In practice, it's best to use a device as a
terminator, if possible, because it will act as an active terminator.
{p} {p}
You can think of termination as 'stopping the data flying out the
ends..." in that termination must be on the ENDS and nowhere else.
Also, the SCSI standards say that there should be no stubs or branches
in the cable, it must be one long piece. Is your surf squirrel 25 pin
or 50 pin? The SCSI2 standards are made around a 50 pin cable; there
is a grounding wire going back for each signal line. You can get away
with just having a few common grounding wires, but it really only
works for short distances. The grounding wires stop refelction of
the data signals by using a corresponding ground wire.
{p} {p}
So check the length of your cable, and termination. If there is
anything else on the SCSI bus, then remove it, with just the CD-ROM,
and see if it works. A bit hard to do of course, if your HD is on the
SCSI bus.
{p} {p}
You must understand 32x is pretty fast (but 32x only occurs on the outside
tracks) on average your cdrom is probably trying to pump
around 3MB/sec (4.8MB/sec max) through that PCMCIA port and your 25
pin SCSI adapter. However, once a 32x gets revving, if you can send
short bursts of info, you should be able to send continuous info...
perhaps it's just a drive problem/driver problem.
{p} {p}
I have no experience with PPC, perhaps that has something to do with
it. ONE thing you should try first is changing the MaxTransfer size to a
SMALLER value (in hex) on both your cdrom AND your hard drive. I have a
feeling that this should cure it. This will have a similar effect to
stopping/starting your installations off CD. But, I could be totally wrong 8^)
{p} {p}
ALSO try changing the buffers of the CDROM and your hard drive. If you
have ram to spare, ie. 32MB or more, you could try 300 buffers instead
of the default 30. What file system are you using? Are there any
freaky hacks/patches you have running? Have you tried disabling them
in your startup-sequence? (just use a ; at the start of a line)
Remeber to try the buffers and maxtransfer on BOTH HD and CDROM, and to
check termination.
{p} {p}
Other than that, I don't know what I can suggest. Perhaps you have a
dodgy squirrel adapter? This one is also open to our readers... I've
never seen this problem before, not even on Wintel PCs (and I thought I'd
seen 'em all! ;^).
