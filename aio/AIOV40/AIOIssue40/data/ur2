You've probably seen it before, in different forms and variations, on
all platforms imaginable, and the Amiga is certainly no exception.
This program is, as the name hints at, a converter for centimeters to
inches, feet to meters, and so on. Onwards to the manual, which is
just about enough in length, covers all possible areas of usage, and
has an easy layout. The program itself is based on the Gadtools GUI,
fontsensitive and quite comfortable to use. You first make sure you
have selected what type of mass, distance, etc., you want
converted,then you enter the numbers in the string, then press the OK
button.

Now, I personally would like to have seen that the program
started the conversion when return is pressed, but that's the only
thing I can find to nag about, really. I don't really know what else
to say about this one - it does the job all right.
