I have a tech question for you.
{p} {p}
I have several amigas, one of which is an A2K full Tower with 030/25
Vector Accellorator (IVS). 8MB on the accellerator, and a 2081 Ram
board with 4MB.  CV64/3D gfx card 4MB with cybergfx, 1GB SCSI hard
drive, SCSI Zip drive, and SCSI CDRom drive.
{p} {p}
Problems is this:  Accellerator boots fine in 030 mode, and is
supposed to be able to boot into 68000 mode, but won't.  68000 chip is
a known good one.

Thanks,

Hello Michael,
{p} {p}
I am relatively new to Amigas
(had a few for about a year and a half), and all my experience is with
A1200 and A4000 systems. I also have the CV64/3D, not a bad card, Just
a pain to set your monitors up with to get a decent refresh rate,
anyway, that's another story..
{p} {p}
Now, the only thing I can suggest without more information and
research is taking out the ram, the scsi card, the gfx card, and
anything else in your system so you just have the turbo board/floppy
connected, and your monitor hooked up via ECS. I know the CV64 is an
absolute pain in the neck to install/remove, but you only need to do this
once. If you have never got this thing to work, then perhaps it is
because the 68000 isn't 32 bit on the outside, like the 030, and
doesn't like the Cybervision64. That's my guess anyway, but what would
I know, I'm not an old timer :D

I would still try seeing if it works with just the turbo board as the only
card. Perhaps it is an autoconfig problem? Maybe our readers can help me out
here. Anyone?
