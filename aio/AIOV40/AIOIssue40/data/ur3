This is a neat little program, similar to P96Speed (which might be
more familiar). The most noticable difference between them is that
AmiGOD opens on the Workbench screen, and all speed tasks are being
carried out in a little window on the WB. The program itself is a
little window that displays your computer specifications. Nothing
fancy, really, but still enough to be worthy of looking at now and
then, and to use to brag for all your friends with how fast your
Amiga is... that is, until you see the database of people that has
carried out the tests on their PPC Amigas and sent them to the
program's author. Seriously though, I like this program, it's small,
nice and neat. However, it would have been nice with some more
features to play around with, and some more colours on the screen
itself would have been nice, too. If you get bored, though, you can
always look at the screenshots that came along the program of other
users AmiGODs.
