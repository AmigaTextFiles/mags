Does anyone remember Shufflepuck Café? Great game wasn't it. Only let
down by the fact it was one-player only. Well SpaceBall 2000 is a
Shufflepuck type of game but it has a two-player option. Can it fill
the gaps?

I downloaded this game because I thought it would be a speedball
clone. Wrong! Turned out to be a good choice of game anyway.

As mentioned on the intro screen there are no options just the bare
game and one or two-player or practice modes. Once you've chosen the
one-player mode you're greeted with a fairly basic "Press Fire To
Start" screen but the tune is pretty cool. Press fire and the game
begins. The first noticeable thing about this game is the fact that
Speedball has inspired the graphics. They are as good as Speedball
was but the game is a cross between breakout and tennis. Your first
opponent is Billy Bob. He's meant to be easy! Took me three goes to
beat the bugger! The ball appears from the central dome and all you
have to do is deflect it past your opponent, using your shield,
without it rebounding off the blocker walls in the centre of the
court. First to five wins. The only other thing is that after a while
the central dome becomes charged and if the ball passes over it while
it's charged it then flies off in a different direction. That is a
real pain!

In two-player mode this game really kicks in. There's nothing better
than taking on a mate with the sole purpose of thrashing them. It can
be made even better with the addition of a few cans of beer!!

The game, as a whole, plays really well and the sound is very good.
It would be nice to have stuff like power ups and I think the shields
are a bit small but power ups would solve that. A great game that it
would be nice to see a version 2 of.
