A Victim Of Its Own Success{p}
24th October, 2000 Amiga.org
{p} {p}
Search.amiga.org, also known as Mitchy is dead. Over the last week
messages have been coming into the Amiga.org office reporting server
errors, and after checking them out today (our Admin has been moving)
we discovered our server is now unable to handle the daily hits. So
from today we will be shutting down mitchy, a victim of its own
popularity. However, do not fear. We are working on bringing Mitchy
back, and better than ever. And for those who are wondering if their
links will survive, the answer is yes, we have backed up the system
and all your information will be saved for use in the new mitchy. As
of when mitchy will be back, we honestly don't know but we are
working on it as fast as we can.
