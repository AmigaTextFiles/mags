"Once upon a time... The magical world of Radya is in serious danger.
The peacefullness and the joy of this realm is threatened by a dark,
evil knight named Gonzul and his bunglers, arrived on floating
islands from unknown parts of the universe. Gonzul's aim is to
conquer and enslave the world: to gain this objective he abducted the
four Nimphs, sources of power and pillars of peace and richness,
bleeding their energy and life. The Queen of these Nimphs, Adora,
during her kidnapping, had spread by her mental powers a message to
all the heroes of Radya: to rescue the Nimphs. Only three heroes have
heard the message:
{p} {p}
 Nekochan : a young mercenary cat-girl, cute and agile.
{p} {p}
 Gupochi  : a valiant prince trasformed in an apparently unarmed amphibian creature by a mysterious witch.
{p} {p}
Yorumaru : a brave and bold knight, in search of glory.
{p} {p}
All together, the four Nimphs can unite their forces in order to
activate a magical weapon, which is the only hope to destroy Gonzul
and his floating realm saving the entire world from his evil shadow.
Will you be able to follow the heroes in this desperate mission?

This (and a lot more) is Bubble Heroes!"
