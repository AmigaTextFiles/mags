This program is very good to have in case you are writing Amiga
guides, it's sort of a code-checker which makes it easy in case you
are either a little lazy, or have a huge guide and checking it for
errors is your worst nightmare. It's a CLI only program (would be
nice to be able to run it from a GUI, too). The program supports
locale, and the program guide comes in many different languages as
well, so most people should really be able to get this up and
running. Should there be any strange things going on in the guide
you're checking the program notifies you of the nature of the error
and where it occured so you can go there and fix it. It does what
it's supposed to do. The program is written by a fellow named Guido
Mersmann, you should really know who that is by now, he has made a
vast array of good  programs/games to the Amiga (such as
BoulderDäsh), and this is certainly no exception!
