First a little piece of erratta. The credit given for last month's
cover was wrong. It was put together by yours truly and not Michael
Evervall this time; just a little cut and past of some lettering onto
an old pic I had lying around so I can't even claim that much credit
for it.  That said...

Well, October and we've got news aplenty, the first new hardware
produced by a company bearing a certain checkered ball logo, and
another new editor.  All this and Halloween too!  Boy, ain't
{italic}this{noitalic} a busy month.

With the recent slew of announcements by Amiga, even such hard-nosed
PC types as Maximum PC are starting to take serious notice.  Actual
upgrade hardware is now confirmed for the A1200 and A4000, and the
AmigaOne has been set for next year and promises to be the first in a
new line of multimedia monsters.  Throw the OS 3.9 upgrade on the
fire, with actual {bold}chips{nobold} no less not to mention a
reasonable $40 price-tag, and this barbecue is starting to look pretty
fierce.

Hope for the future?  I know a revolution when I smell one.

This month also brings yet another new editor. Barry Riddiford will
be our new Games Editor starting with this very issue, so if you got
any games you'd like to see reviewed then he's the man to write to. 
Also, our first Tech Guy Q and A, and next month Paul will even bring
you a DIY project he's been working on.  Amiga's not standing still
and neither is AIO.

Have a Happy Halloween.
