I never owned a Commodore 64 and I'd never played Bruce Lee before
but one of my mates raves about it so much so that he's got it
running on an emulator. So when a new version of Bruce Lee was
announced on Czech Amiga News website I thought I'd download it and
see what all the fuss is about.

As soon as you've loaded this game you get your options screen with
some fairly dodgy bagpipe music. This changes into a pretty groovy
tune so that's no problem!
{p} {p}
You only have 3 options to choose from:{p}
1) Number of players. 1 - 4{p}
2) Game mode. Normal and Crazy{p}
3) Starting level.{p}
Once that's done you start the game.

When the game's running you easily remember the good old days of
Spectrum, BBC and C64. It's a replica and as easy to play as all the
old games. All you have to do is complete the level by collecting the
boing balls and entering the portal at the end. Easy or what? Not so.
You have to climb up and down ladders, jump from platform to platform
and use the teleport doors. Avoid the bouncing balls, electric
charges, man-eating plants and all the ninja, sumo warrior baddies
that come after you!!! There's more happening in Bruce Lee than in
the centre of London at rush hour! Fortunately you are equipped with
two (WOW) killer karate moves. A deadly punch and a lethal flying
kick. Both of which are useful when you need to destroy a baddie that
won't stop chasing you. Unfortunately any destroyed baddie reappears
on the level after a few seconds.  Obviously as you progress through
the levels you'll encounter more and more baddies that are after your
blood. Sounds grim but they can't stand each other and there is a
regular free for all on most occasions where they forget all about
chasing you.

I love this game. It looked grim when I first loaded it but after a
few minutes play I found myself laughing out loud and playing level
after level. It's like the Keystone Cops! In 2, 3, 4 player mode
you've got your mates to help complete the level and dispose of the
bad guys but as soon as we found out we could hit each other it
turned into a manic beatem up. The graphics are true to the Commodore
style and the sounds, if taken literally, are a bit poor but they are
perfect for the style of game play.
