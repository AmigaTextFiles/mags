Hasty moves are often bad ones. We wanted to do a pre-release on the
TORRO website for now so that the Amiga community could get a grip on what
is currently in the works. For those that think it is BS, I invite you
to set up a private conference with us at COMDEX, or after COMDEX in phoenix.
We will have a working prototype of the Hurricane at COMDEX. These systems
have been in design for eight months now. The release dates on the Hurricane
and the eClipS look like the 2nd Q of 2001 to 3rd Q 2001. The release date
of the system also depends on the release of the AmigaDE (Digital Environment)
which will be the OS of the TORRO series.
{p} {p}
To answer a few questions:{p}
1>TORRO is spelled with two "R"s with intention.{p}
2>The original idea for the Tsunami ad the ApocolipS series was to use
the BoXeR logic board. After July, this seemed more hopeless than ever.
We have therefore decided to design and produce custom boards based on
Motorola/IBM technology. For the Tsunami, we are planning the following
features:{p}
    Motorola PowerPC 7400 (G4) at 500MHz or faster (fastest available at production time).{p}
    Dual processor slots if possible.{p}
    Up to 1.5GB+ RAM.{p}
    PS/2, USB 2.0, IEEE 1394 (Firewire, internal and external).{p}
    SCSI-3 and IDE/ATA{p}
    Other features will have to be determined.{p}
3> We know that the design of the MISEL site is sub-standard. please
be aware that it is in "beta" form as of now. We have hired a new web specialist
to take care of the MISEL site. The future MISEL site will feature a Flash
intro, improved navigation, and a very much needed interface improvement.{p}
4> The logos for the systems are still undergoing small revisions. Much
better logos will be online in a week or so.{p}
5> Conceptual sketches and composite drawings will be online shortly
as well. We know you are all waiting for this...{p}
6> Please stop the "this is a hoax" threads. Such threads could be considered
slanderous and are not true. What do we have to gain by hoaxing the Amiga
community? Merlancia Industries has spent enough time dealing with vapour
companies. We are not planning on joining them. The only think hoaxing
would do is create tension between Merlancia Industries and the Amiga community,
thus creating loss of sales and business. We are not planning to do that,
by any means.{p}
7> You may e-mail with questions concerning the systems, and suggestions
are always appreciated. All we ask, however, is that you do not send an
e-mail saying: "When will the TORRO xxx system be available and how much
will it cost?".{p}
We will be posting costs when we know the "exact" production cost of
the unit. We have no intention of having to change our list price because
of an error.{p}
Release dates will be posted in due time, and some have *already* been
posted.{p}
8> Merlancia Industries is not a "one man company". Quite the contrary.
We have three engineers working on the TORRO series altogether right now,
two web designers (merlancia.com and MISEL sites), a new PR handler, and
two sales reps. We also have two more in shipping/receiving, thought that
is really not anyone's immediate concern or care, if I guess right.
Actually, we are currently looking for Amigans with hardware/software
development skills, as we are planning a port of FinalSuite over to AmigaDE
as well as an update of FinalSuite for OS3.5/3.9 (No, I have no idea what
3.9 is going to have...sorry...wish I did...).{p}
9> Finally, these systems are not "AmigaOne" systems. They are Merlancia
MMC TORRO systems, running the AmigaDE. If Amiga, inc. decides to license
us to brand them "Amiga-Anything", then that would be great. We are producing
other Amiga merchandising items currently, however.
{p} {p}
In closing, we would like to take one more moment of your time to assure
you that this is for real. Tens of thousands of dollars have already been
spent in the past month on this product series. (We have bank records to
prove this...) We are not pumping all this money into a dead end product.
At least, i hope we aren't.
{p} {p}
Again, thank you for your support to the Amiga platform and community.
I am an Amiga user too. I felt the pain and sorrow when CBM died, and Escom
Died, and Gateway gave up with all the rest of you. Finally, after all
these long six years, it seems that we have a new Amiga system on the horizon.
I would like to welcome those that are interested to join the band wagon
for the AmigaDE, and those that will stop at 3.3/3.5/3.9, i would like
to say that I hope you will change your minds when you actually see what
the AmigaDE is all about with your own eyes. We have other products on
the drawing board currently that we are not going to announce anytime soon,
for fear of another over-reaction like this. Just rest assured, they will
rock your world.
