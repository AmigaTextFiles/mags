{subhead}Classic Games: Technoccop{def}{p}

Games today usually have rich plots, brimming with unanswered
questions, suspenseful climaxes and three-dimensional characters. Yet
not long ago, the need for vivid narratives was not as essential.
There was a time when games simply went for the pure adrenaline rush,
achieved with excessive violence, big guns and fast cars. An example
of this era was US Gold's Technocop.
{p} {p}
In Technocop, you assume the role of a law enforcement agent who has
a licence to kill and robotic implants that make him more efficient
when killing. The game is broken up into a series of levels, each
where you must drive to a crime scene in your sports car, called the
VMAX, then hunt down a 'boss' enemy in a building there. Hence, the
game takes two flavours. When driving, the game plays much like a
racer, and you must avoid enemy cars. This can be done by destroying
them with the VMAX's cannon, ramming, or overtaking them. Upon
arriving at the crime scene, Technocop leaves the car and the game
becomes a platformer. Here you must navigate the building to find the
boss, whom you either must capture or eliminate. You are armed with a
pistol that can fire two projectiles; bullets and nets. These come in
handy when you encounter the many punks who guard the building.
Completion of missions is not compulsory, but rewards are given when
accomplished.

The graphics look good in the main. When driving, both the VMAX and
the other cars are highly detailed, and the blur of roadside objects
produces a realistic illusion of speed. When in platform mode, the
buildings you search are also well presented, looking very rundown
with the use of graffiti and ripped wallpaper. The animation is also
fluid throughout, and there is a good use of bright colours. What
could have been improved were the sprites- although they are not ugly,
they look mushy, as if they were designed with water paints. When
driving, the size of the playing screen is tiny, but it gets larger in
platform mode. And so, while the graphics are above average, they
could have been slightly better.
{p} {p}
Technocop sounds great! The VMAX's engine is music to any car
enthusiast's ears, as is its squealing brakes, high-powered cannon and
the metallic crunch audible when you ram enemy cars. The awesome
effects continue when you are in platform mode, in particular when a
punk closes in with a melee attack, the sound of your pistol firing
and the consequent sound of your target's innards splashing onto the
floor. The sounds are limited in number, however, and no music is
present. Perhaps some ominous tunes in the platform levels would have
heightened the investigative feel of the game. Yet the sounds that are
present are of high quality.
{p} {p}
Another excellent aspect of Technocop is its appealing gameplay. The
controls are simple to master in both areas of the game. If you do
complete missions, you will be rewarded with extra lives and vehicle
powerups, which include a turbocharger for increased acceleration,
pneumatic pumps which help knock enemies off the road and rapid fire
for the VMAX's cannon. Perhaps the greatest feature is the
over-the-top action. Netting a thug is great fun, as when captured,
your foe will drop to the ground and struggle to break free of the
net. Shooting with bullets will result in your target exploding in a
burst of crimson, followed by assorted anatomical remains falling to
the ground, with the corpse even twitching! Technocop is gory even by
today's standards, and this may turn some off. But most should find
that the abundant violence never looses its appeal, making the game
that more fun to play.
{p} {p}
In terms of lastability, you will either love or hate Technocop. This
is because that, on both the driving and platform stages, a time limit
has been implemented. Although the timers in the driving levels should
not pose much of a problem, the timers in the platform stages will, as
they are very strict. Hence, Technocop becomes a game of repetition,
as the buildings are designed to confuse a player who has not explored
them before. If you do get lost, or are unable to find the boss, there
is not much hope in back tracking and finding another route, as time
will run out. The only way to successfully navigate the buildings is
to know your path before hand, which means the game must be played
over and over if you wish to complete every mission. Many players will
find this frustrating, but it is an aspect that, although irritating,
makes the game also highly addictive.
{p} {p}
Although the graphics could have been more crisp, and the fact that
some players may be turned off at the gore, or racing against time,
Technocop is still immensely entertaining. It is virtually two games
in one, and blasting baddies will always be fun. It is just one of
those games that promises nothing more than adrenaline, excitement and
buckets of blood. And this it certainly delivers.
