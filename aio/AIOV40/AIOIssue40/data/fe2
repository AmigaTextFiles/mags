Greetings to one and all.
{p} {p}
I know it has been a long time since I last had the chance to write
to all to all of you. It has been very, very busy, and we have seen
some great successes, and some disappointments. I have not been
asleep, and to the contrary I have not been getting much sleep of
late.  There is so much activity, and so little time that I have been
spending a great deal of time in other areas and not keeping everyone
up to date. To my Friends in Italy, I apologize that I was not able
to attend the show.  It was a real disappointment for me personally,
as I wanted to greet each and every one of you.  The reason was not
because we are broke, or out of money as the rumors would state.
{p} {p}
Simply, there were two companies in California that I have been
working with, and they requested a meeting that occurred over the
same period of time.  With working with these OEM's we will be able
to add several million more Amigans, and the discussions went well
and are progressing quickly, these meetings were in addition to what
is mentioned in point 3 below.
{p} {p}
Now with all the above fun stuff..
{p} {p}
Here we go:
{p} {p}
1.  The SDK for Amiga DE.{p}
This has been very exciting, and we are really pleased with the
number of applications and the number developers using the product to
create some great products. The next version of the Software
Development Kit will be out in the next couple of weeks.  In addition
to the Linux version there is now a version available for Windows.
That's correct you are now able to develop for the new Amiga on
either Linux, or Windows. It will feature a new raft of multimedia
(Mesa, the SSEYO Koan Audio Engine, streaming) as well better
development tools, a richer AVE  and enhanced performance.
{p} {p}
2.  Amiga OS 3.5 and beyond{p}
We are continuing taking a very hard look at the current Amiga and
how we can best move the platform forward.  There are discussions on
going for some new opportunities and we will be able to share some
announcements in the very near future.
{p} {p}
3.  Amiga DE business opportunities.{p}
Wow, this is an area that is absolutely exploding.  For developers
this is going to be great news.  Not only will the applications you
are working on be used by your Amiga family members, but with the
deals that are either executed or in motion there will be millions
more consumers joining the Amiga family.
{p} {p}.
Now many of you began to speculate on the Meternet announcement.
Meternet is offering a great product, and they are going to be making
it available to the Amiga community, but it is not the AmigaOne
{p} {p}
4.  The AmigaOne.{p}
We have listened to a great many of you with comments, suggestions,
business ideas and technical ideas.  Dean Brown has been a huge help,
especially that he is now here in Snoqualmie with the other members
of the team. Because of this input we have begun negotiations for a
brand new design.  Most of the details have been worked out, and I
hope to have the finished announcement ready by the middle of
October.  It is my firm belief that you will all be very pleased and
excited.
{p} {p}
5.  Dealers/Distributors, and our friends in the Press:{p}
The well of information for all of you has been too dry, and
inconsistent.  To better provide information to each and every one of
you. Amiga has created two new mailing lists.  Please go to:
http://www.amigadev.net/index.php?sid=&subpage=home&function=showmaill
ists or to www.amigadev.com and select mailing lists on the right
hand side of the screen.  Select either press or dealer, and fill out
your information.  We will begin weekly feeds to these lists to
better support our press and dealers.
{p} {p}
I know that many of you will read that this letter says nothing, and
that there is nothing happening, other than a new motorcycle for me.
Well you are very wrong.  We are meeting directly with the heads of
some of the largest computer and consumer electronics companies in
the world, and not only do they see the value in what we are offering
but they see where the Amiga community, you, is the real value. Now
we still have a ways to go, but we are moving very fast, and I know
that you will all be very proud of Amiga as we continue to make
things happen.
{p} {p}
The biggest challenge for Amiga right now is to stay focused on our
core strengths, and not make the mistakes of those who have walked
before us. The Amiga opportunity is huge, and sometimes overwhelming.
There are so many conflicting reports, and I have not done a very
good job of being able to communicate to all of you as well as I
would like to.   We are getting much closer every day, and everyone
of you are a major part of the Amiga Family's success.
