Dear Amiga Family:
{p} {p}
I am writing this to you as I am flying back from a wonderful two
days in Melbourne Australia.   It was indeed a great delight and
pleasure to meet with all of the wonderful members of the Amiga
Family downunder, and I look forward to the next opportunity of
coming down to visit. I especially want to thank all of the dealers,
developers and end users who attended the seminars and the hundreds
of you who joined at the dinner.
{p} {p}
Amiga truly is a global family, and to many an unknown phenomena.  It
is the Amiga Family who has kept this amazing system alive and
growing. I would like to take a moment and recognize the efforts of
two people especially who made my stay in Australia a delight, and
educational as well.  Jeff Rose, of Unitech the d'Amiga Distributor
for Australia and Basil Flinter the Secretary of the Amiga Down Under
Group or A.D.U.G.  I want to thank them both for taking the extra
time to help me truly understand what Australia and New Zealand mean
to Amiga, and what Amiga can do to help our Family downunder.  I can
say that on the next trip, I will take the time to visit New Zealand,
and say hello. There are many exciting things happening with Amiga,
and I wanted to tell everyone, what the attendees of ACE 2000
learned.
{p} {p}
Alrighty then, here we go:
{p} {p}
{bold}AmigaOS 3.9{nobold}
{p} {p}

{p} {p}
Shipping this Christmas 2000 an upgrade for the AmigaOS!  Version 3.9
of the AmigaOS will be shipping, and ready for your holiday season.
AmigaOS 3.9 is being developed in concert with Haage and Partner
GmbH, and a new web site that will include a feature list, and other
bits of information will be available shortly.  OS 3.9 will be
available for under $40.00.  Watch the site for more details. In the
meantime, here's a screen shot.  While Amiga is still a Benevolent
Dictatorship, and not a democracy or even a republic, we do listen to
you, the community, and strive to create products that you would
enjoy using, and even (dare I say) purchasing. It is because of the
community that we are pleased to announce the first in a series of
new hardware that has been designed by Amiga, and soon to be
manufactured by Amiga OEM partners.
{p} {p}
The first in the AmigaONE series of products are the AmigaONE PPC
1200, and AmigaONE PPC 4000 cards from Eyetech.  Available to
developers in December this year, these new products are designed
specifically for the Amiga Community.
{p} {p}
We also are announcing another partner bPlan GmbH who is also
creating a new AmigaONE PPC based desktop computer.   More details
will emerge shortly about bPlan and the products that they will be
offering. Please visit the AmigaONE web site to learn more. I would
also like to announce new versions of the Amiga SDK. AmigaSDK version
1.1 will begin shipping on October 24, 2000.  In addition to an
upgrade for the Linux version, we are please to announce the Windows
version of the Amiga SDK.
{p} {p}
Now I made a mistake in the September 28 Executive Update.  Amiga SDK
1.1 does not include the sound, UI, or 3D pieces.  These will be
found in version 1.2, will be out shortly.  I am sorry for the error,
but know that any purchaser of an Amiga SDK will receive free
updates, and upgrades for 12 months from the date of purchase.
{p} {p}
{bold}Possible Amiga Community Investment Opportunity:{nobold}
{p} {p}
Another announcement made in Melbourne was the possibility of a
Registration A filing for Amiga.  Since the announcements of the
Amiga, Incorporated plan and strategy we have continually received
questions, and offers of investing in Amiga.
{p} {p}
We at Amiga have been trying to find ways to give something back for
all of your efforts, and continued faith in what we are doing.  We
are investigating a method where we can offer 10% of Amiga to the
community in a Registration A filing.
{p} {p}
Now as with any investment there is risk associated, and before
anyone should invest we will of course encourage people to read the
plan, prospectus, and risks.
{p} {p}
We are investigating this in earnest, but before we continue down
this path much further, we wanted to see what the community thought.
We have established an e-mail address of investor@amiga.com where
members of the Amiga community can send us a message with their
interest.  We are looking for no less than $250.00 per investment.
If you are interested please send an e-mail message along with the
dollar amount that you would be interested in investing.
{p} {p}
We have not decided on whether or not we are going to do this, but to
date we have investigated many opportunities and this looks to be a
great option.
{p} {p}
Now each country has its own rules about Registration A filings, so
you would want to check with local authorities to learn what rules
may apply to each of you.
{p} {p}
{bold}Closing:{nobold}
{p} {p}
It has been an amazing 10 months since we started Amiga Incorporated.
The community has seen the delivery of the Amiga SDK, an upgrade, and
an upgrade to the AmigaOS, and now the announcement of three PPC
based AmigaONE products.
{p} {p}
Well, we have a long ways to go, and many more battles to fight, but
I am confident that with the community with us, and the continuing
enhancements to the product line that there is a long and exciting
future for Amiga. Again thanks to Greg, and Michael, and the
thousands of other Amigans downunder who made ACE 2000 such a great
event.
{p} {p}
To the user group members around the world, it is time to start
calling the others who have drifted away, and let them know what is
happening, and that they can be part of continuing the legacy that is
Amiga. Get Boinged!
