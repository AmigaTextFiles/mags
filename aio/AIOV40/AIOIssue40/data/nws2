DCE gets exclusive rights to publish Voodoo CGX drivers

Today, Vision Factory Development (VFD) and DCE Computer Service
signed an exclusive contract about the use of current "CGX
Voodoo"-Drivers. In contrast to earlier announcements , this driver
will be exclusively available for the G-REX PCI expansion only. This
contract guarantees the immediate availability and the best support a
user can get for the current range of powerful voodoo graphics boards
in conjunction with all currently available ppc accelerators of the
Blizzard- and CyberStorm series. With the expected problems of PPC 3D
drivers in conjunction with Mediator PCI and the currently available
PPC accelerators in Dual-CPU mode (68K 2D driver) in mind, VFD
decided to drop the further development of the actual Alpha Voodoo
drivers for Mediator and concentrates on development for the G-REX
PCI board because drivers were succesfully tested already. Voodoo3
cards should give you a significant performance boost for the current
range of PPC accelerated games, flawless working of the CyberGraphX
driver can't be guaranteed due to technical hardware limitations of
Mediator PCI though, so VFD decided to go that way.

As a final note,
CGX Voodoo driver alpha versions that are probably develivered with
the Mediator hardware are in no way authorized or licensed by VFD.
Current S3 ViRGE drivers are not affected by this agreement. DCE and
VFD also decided to work together on additional drivers regarding
both networking and sound in conjunction with G-REX PCI.
