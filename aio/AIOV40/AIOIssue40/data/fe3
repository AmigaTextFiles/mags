This month it's just a little collection of DOpus nuggets, little things
that you may have forgotten.  So, without further adeu, and in no 
particular order...

Ever find that PAd Lock on the listers useless?  Just set the 
Envitronment variable (in ENV:DOpus/)  HidePadlock to 1.

In the Settings-->Environment-->Directories you can set the default max 
filename length in terms of number of chatracters.  Default is 30, but 
I've found 40 to be a good default for most anything I'll run into.

You can set the screen titel for the DOpus screen, that you no doubt 
know.  But take a more careful look at the command arguments.  %pm is 
for the Phase of the Moon, and actually includes a little moon icon (of 
the appropriate phase) to be displayed.

Click on the Left sidebar of any Lister and that lister's contents will
back up one directory along it's path.

And finally, the keypad works with the active lister.  Pg Dn scrolls the
display down one page, Pg Up up, End to the last lines displayed, Home
at the top of the directory list.  Of course, the normal cursor arrows
do what you'd think as well.
