{p} {p}
October 21, 2000, Melbourne,{p}
Australia -{p}
It is with great pleasure that we are able to
announce the first new Amiga hardware in over 6
years. The AmigaOne, our first consumer product, will be
targeted at the desktop and workstation market. Further 
products to follow will cover the markets from Personal
Digital Assistants and upwards. All these products will
run a single piece of software, the revolutionary
Amiga Digital Environment (DE).
{p} {p}
We completed the AmigaOne specification three months 
ago, and dubbed it the "zico". It is a specification and not
a product because Amiga is a software company, not a hardware
manufacturer. The ability of the Amiga DE to host itself on
multiple hardware and operating system platforms frees us
from hardware dependency and gives our partners and our customers 
the freedom to chose the hardware that best suits their needs
and tastes.
{p} {p}
The zico specification is as follows:{p}
  - One AmigaDE friendly host processor (PPC, x86, Arm, SH4, MIPS){p}
  - 64MB+ memory{p}
  - Next Generation Matrox graphics card{p}
  - Creative EMU10K1 based audio card{p}
  - 10 GB+ HD{p}
  - CD/DVD{p}
  - USB 1.0{p}
  - Firewire{p}
  - 10/100 Mbps Ethernet{p}
  - 56k modem{p}
  - Spare PCI slots for expandibility{p}

With the completion of the specification stage of the Amiga One,
we contacted several respected hardware companies with a view to
selecting partners who would be interested in creating AmigaOne
products.
{p} {p}
The AmigaOne process involves close co-operation between Amiga
and our partners' hardware groups, the running of the AmigaDE on
the hardware, and a thorough quality certification of the final
product. Only then can the product be called an AmigaOne.
Whilst still in detailed negotiation with several companies,
we are delighted to announce the first partner company and
its initial set of AmigaOne products.
{p} {p}
The Eyetech Group Ltd, of Stokesley, U.K. already has an excellent
reputation in the Amiga community. They have done much to keep the
classic Amiga alive during the last five years, and we feel that in
the creation of the first new Amiga machines and the transitioning
from the classic to the next wave, that experience will prove invaluable.
{p} {p}
Bill McEwen President of Amiga Inc commented: "This arrangement builds on and
extends our existing partnership agreement with Eyetech, first announced in
April of this year. Our experience during this period has shown Eyetech to be
a no-nonsense company capable of delivering what they promise on time and this
consideration also weighed heavily in our choice of a hardware partner for the
PPC based AmigaOne."
{p} {p}
Alan Redhouse, Managing Director of UK-based Eyetech, said; "I am delighted
that we have been able to build on our existing partnership with Amiga and continue
our close working relationship with them on both a technical and manufacturing
level. Our decade of Amiga experience, plus our hardware and software efforts
to push the Amiga forwards means that we are able to work with Amiga to deliver a
proven upgrade solution to Amiga users which gives their existing 'Classic'
applications an immediate and substantial performance boost whilst
providing full forward compatibility with the new Amiga DE. Our work on the
Predator line of boards means that we can help Amiga to fulfill its requirement
of maximising the investment of the current community as it moves
forwards."
{p} {p}
Fleecy Moss, Chief Technology Officer, Amiga Inc added: "After
talks with the hardware development staff of several companies I am
convinced that working with Eyetech will allow us to offer an elegant
solution that gives both an excellent level of backward compatibility
and a powerful basis for the new Amiga Digital Environment. Top of
our requirements list was to ensure that those Amigans who have spent
considerable money in staying with the Amiga would not be left out in
the cold. Whilst you can't please all of the people all of the time, we
think we have come up with a set of products and solutions that will
put a smile on as many faces as possible."
{p} {p}
Eyetech is focusing on an immediate need in the existing Amiga market. Many have
already invested considerable resources in their classic Amigas, both in
terms of hardware and in terms of software. Whilst keen to move forwards with
the AmigaOne, they also want to maximise their investment in the classic platform.
{p} {p}
The Eyetech AmigaOne PPC 1200 is a custom board which uses Eyetech
Predator technology with the "zico" specification to provide
a perfect synergy of classic and next generation. It provides
all the functionality of the standalone AmigaOne PPC, but has 
been extended to mate with a classic Amiga A1200. This allows
customers who have a serious investment in the classic Amiga 
to continue to use their machines whilst also having a brand
new Amiga at their disposal. The 68k processor in the A1200 
will be emulated at a substantially increased level via the
PPC processor on the AmigaOne, whilst the classic operating 
system can take advantage of the AmigaOne's next generation
hardware resources.
{p} {p}
The AmigaOne PPC 4000 machine is similarly designed to allow
customers who have a significant investment in their classic Amiga
A4000 to be able to move that investment forwards whilst also
benefiting from the next generation capabilities of the AmigaOne.
The Eyetech AmigaOne PPC 1200 will be available as an upgrade for
owners of towered A1200 computers, the Eyetech AmigaOne PPC 4000
as an upgrade for Amiga 4000 desktop computers in tower conversion cases.
Options for producing AmigaOne PPC upgrade designs for other
Classic Amiga designs (such as the A3000 and Amiga International A4000T)
will be looked at (subject to demand) once the A1200 and A4000 products are
released.
{p} {p}
In order to implement all the features of the AmigaOne specification the,
A1200 and A4000 upgrade versions will feature one AGP and six PCI slots, a
user-upgradable G3/G4 (Macintosh-type) cpu slot, up to 512MB SDRAM and a
high speed IDE/ATAPI interface. The system will be dual-bootable both into
the Amiga DE and into Classic Amiga Workbench. This latter feature will
allow purchasers to have the performance benefits of full G3/G4 cpu speeds
and 512MB of SDRAM memory whilst running Classic Amiga software. Both these
boards are scheduled to ship in 1Q01, with developer versions being
available in December 2000.
{p} {p}
Design of both the Eyetech AmigaOne PPC A1200 and A4000 products
has been done with great sensitivity to the existing user and
developer community.
{p} {p}
"By releasing the classic compatible AmigaOne PPC products first,"
said Alan Redhouse. "We are providing a transitional path forwards
for the existing community, enabling them to maximise their current
investment whilst also leaping ahead with the new Amiga DE."
In order to facilitate this transition, the classic Amiga operating
system will see its lifeline extended. OS3.9, to be launched before
Christmas will add a raft of new features and functionality, and will be
able to run on the Eyetech AmigaOne PPC classic products.
{p} {p}
Eyetech are also keen to talk to existing hardware manufacturers
about possibilities for licencing, manufacturer and other co-operation
in order to ensure a smooth transition of the existing Amiga community
from the present to the future.
{p} {p}
Amiga is also very close to signing up partners for a standalone AmigaOne
machine. The ATX form factor AmigaOne has been designed to run the full
consumer version of the Amiga Digital Environment (DE) allowing the best of
the Classic Amiga  software which has been ported to run directly under the
Amiga DE, and the use of a wide range of Amiga DE-based digital content -
such as productivity software, content creation suites, development
environments and 3-D games - to be used 'out of the box'.
{p} {p}
All this work - including extensive testing of hardware and software
components - is scheduled to be complete in time for end user deliveries
3Q01. Amiga Inc is currently in negotiation with several potential partner
companies for the development and manufacture of the stand-alone AmigaOne
and its related digital content/software. Companies interested in producing
this version, utilising the PPC processor family include Eyetech, and bplan GmbH of
Germany. We hope to have
{p} {p}
announcements to make on this within the next few weeks. Other companies and
other processors are also under negotiation.
{p} {p}
A new website is being set up, specifically to provide a focal
point for news, questions, comment and discussion on the AmigaOne,
and we encourage people to visit it and participate.
