Remember the good old days when you could use CopyNewIcon utility?
And then Amiga OS 3.5 came along, with (almost) new icons and
libraries, and all the sudden those programs didn't work any longer.
I remember myself being quite annoyed with that as well. Then some
time passed, and I at first thought that it wouldn't take very long
until a similar application showed up. In the meantime I almost
stopped using icons all together, displaying the windows with names
only in DOpus, and I still do that. But once and a while I like to
show the icons the way they were supposed to be, dreaming back to the
"golden age" Amiga, and when you do that it's pretty handy to have an
utility that makes it easy, just like in the good old days, to copy
icons of your preference here and there where they are needed. The
manual is very brief, but that doesn't really matter much, as it
deals with what you have to know to use the program.

The program itself works as most of us are used to, you first click on the
CopyIcon icon, shift-click on the icon or icons to be duplicated,
then doubleclick on the last icon you want. Works like a charm.
However, if you find yourself unsure about this thing, you can also
just start the program itself with a simple doubleclick and use it
the drag & drop way, which works like this, when running the program
a small window appears, where you drop the source-icon to the
leftmost area of the window, and icon to be replaced in the right.
You can also use it from the CLI, if you like that better, that is
also very easy. There are also a few other options you can use, such
as the Optimize feature, this removes all unused colours from the
bitmap of the icon, thus reducing it in size.

In conclusion this program is very small, easy to use and useful with
some nice features.
