Hmm, October again; MY favorite holiday month.  :)
So, as Fall reaches half the world, and those costumed munchkins come
wrapping at your door blackmailing you for candy with their innocent
looks and shoplifting bags, here's a few sites to amuse you between
doorbells.

The Commoodore Billboard{p}
http://www.commodorebillboard.com/{p}
A nice little nostalgiaa site, it's archives contain all manner of
Commodor promotional material.  Yes, that's right; there
{bold}were{nobold} some times when Commodore actually did some
advertising beyond the "if we make it, they woill come" variety.
Brochures, television commercials (AVI format), and adverts for all things Amiga,
from the A1000 to the A4000T, CD32, and more. Great nostalgia thing but
the commercial files might take a bit of bandwidth.

Zeeks.com{p}
http://www.zeeks.com{p}
Another site to keep the little ghouls busy while you sew up their
costumes, you'll find games, music, hobbies, sports stuff, and all the
usual stuff to keep the kiddies occupied.  You can never bookmark too
many of these sites, given the average attention span of the under-ten
crowd.
{p} {p}
Cyrebels.org{p}
http://www.cyrebels.org/{p}
A site for coders, supported languages thus far are C/C++, Pearl,
Python, and tol/tk. You'll find code snippets, helpful programming
articles, recommended books, and places to chat with other coders.  Nice
little piece of programming help.

Obsessive Fan Sites{p}
http://www.ggower.com/fans/{p}
Basically a specialized bookmark list, this one of assorted fan sites.
Ah, but not just {italic}any{noitalic} fan sites. This place is dedicated to those sites
that are perhaps just a bit too obssessive of those they worship.  Still
though, kind of fun... and just a bit scary from the point of view of the
stars.

Pick Of The Month

{p} {p}
Werewolf.com{p}
http://www.werewolf.com{p}
Feeling a bit wolfish this Holloween? Got ssome fur under your skin.  
Well then, this is the place to go.  A site devoted entirely to 
werewolves and lycanthropes.  Just the thing you need for a change from
vampires and ghosts.
{p} {p}
The site seems to revolve around Discussion Boards, each board ndevoted
to a different subject.  But it's the subjects that get the interest.  
EWant to meet another werewolf?  Then try werewolf personals.  Want to 
know more about werewolf lore, then there's a section on that. If you're
into the game Werewolf Apocalypse there's a discussion board for that. Even
one for hating vampires (the two have never gotten along, don't you
know).  If all else fails, just try the werewolf humor.
{p} {p}
To make it easier to get around, there's the usual site-search engine,
categorized for ease of use, werewolf research and history,
entertainment, the works.  The front page also has occassional 
wolf-related news, and a link to a page where you can get a werewolf
email account.
{p} {p}
Finally, there's a wolf-related Elian Flash put up for amusement's sake, 
though it seems to take forever to load.  Should be funny, once it 
loads.
{p} {p}
Well, I'm off now; time to see if that Flash finished loading yet; then 
maybe I can see if it's as funny as the link suggests.
