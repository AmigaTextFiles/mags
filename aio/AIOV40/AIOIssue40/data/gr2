Card games come in two forms: Can't be bothered and totally
addictive. This depends on how easy it is to get to grips with the
game. Crazy 8's is totally addictive! The author, Curt Esser, has
managed to create a card game that is enjoyable to play. You know
you're onto a winner as soon as you load the game and get a scream of
manic laughter after which you're into the options.

Here you can change anything, screen colours, background music,
player names, style of game, card set and screen mode. The only thing
that really needs changing is the card set you want to use. There are
eight choices but the best are the Simpsons and Cartoon decks.

Having chosen your cards it's time to play. The cards are shuffled
and dealt by the computer and you're off. All you have to do is get
rid of your cards before your opponent by either following suit or
the picture. Any cards left in your hand are added to your score.
Each card has its own point value. The person who goes above the
default 200 points is the loser. Easy or what? Well, no, not really.
There's a bit of strategy needed because if you can't go you have to
pick up from the pile. There's also a wild card....The 8. Hence the
name of the game. You can play the 8 any time you want and it's used
to change suits, hearts, spades, diamonds and clubs. This can help
you to win or stop the computer from winning.

Any way enough of the rules, onto the game. The default tune,
Moonshine, is great. The graphics in the game are more than adequate
and the sound samples help to keep the game fresh and playable. I've
played this for some time and haven't got bored. This is one game
that's staying on my hard drive.
