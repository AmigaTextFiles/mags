Hi Paul
{p} {p}
Nice to have a tech-head to consult at last ;-)
{p} {p}
I had an A1200 with Apollo 1266 accelerator + 16mb Fatsram & 2.1gb WD hd.
A1200 m/board(Rev.1.d.4) burnt out & my other m.board is not '060 compliant!
My biggest problem, however, is(almost) unrelated. My A1200 once crashed while
writing to a 700mb partition(PowerComputing 4way IDE splitter & IDEFix) & ever
since, crashes while revalidating. I've tried just about everything but all's
failed :-( I now have a 700mb partition disabled with a LOT of sofware on it &
nothing big enough to salvage to(unemployed - can't buy another hd.)!
{p} {p}
Any ideas on how to get that partition back????? I can't afford another
m/board due to exchange rates :-(
{p} {p}
Thanx in advance,
{p} {p}
Jimmy
{p} {p}
P.S. KS3.0/WB3.0 with 3.1 bits.......'030/50. Not sure if '060 survived A1200
     explosion until I try another m.board(sob!).

Hi Jimmy,
{p} {p}
Regarding your HD, I had the exact same problem (twice). In one case,
I could boot without startup-sequence, and I had about 60 seconds to
copy stuff from the broken partition (while it was re-validating) to
another partition before the FFS revalidate routines decided to bring
me to the guru. It took ages, but I was able to copy most of my
stuff...
{p} {p}
There is no hope (practically) of restoring your partition if
DiskSalv etc. can't fix it. All you can do is disable the sick
partition in the ECS menu, boot without startup, then delete it and
recreate it again with HDToolbox. You should then be able to install
your software off the original CDs/Floppies.
{p} {p}
Salvaging some stuff off your HD may be possible, if you desperately
needed a text file, and it wasn't too fragmented, you could use a HDD
sector editor/viewer util to view byte for byte your partition. I have
done this on the PC with Norton utils, to retrieve a small keyfile for
a friend. I'm not sure if such a util exists for Amiga, but I don't
see why not. Retrieving 700MB worth of binary though is going to be
insane - perhaps if you knew FFS inside out, there could be a way to
see what is crashing the FFS handler. To do this, you would have to
know m68k assembler and be Dave Haynie ;)  I can't help you there!
{p} {p}
My only other suggestion is to perhaps try the OS 3.1 roms - 3.0 roms
are a bit bug ridden, perhaps the 3.1 roms can cope with whatever ugly
screwup your FS structure has gotten itself into. Short of buying 3.1,
do you have access to a miggy with 3.1 roms?
{p} {p}
Sorry I can't help you out. Next time, try SFS ;) (See AIO issue 39 or
members.fortunecity.com/glortzp/aio_sfs.html)

There is no mention your motherboard rev. as a problem board. Do you
mean rev 2B? Strangley, it is 1D.4, the old board you mentioned that
should have troubles. Technically, these are very simple
modifications, but unless you have worked with SMD soldering before,
(If you have installed  a playstation mod chip before, you will know
what I mean... the difference beteween clean and messy work is the
difference between a dead and an alive PSX... I also do some
robotics myself, and I can almost guarantee that if you have never
soldered like this before, you will have problems... ;) Personally, I
wouldn't pay 30 pounds for a simple mod like that, so if you have
experience with stuff like this, it would be fairly simple (as you
should see below). As always, even 'professionals' screw up sometimes,
so keep in mind the possibility of disaster.
{p} {p}
If you don't have the skills/confidence, I certainly recommend you use
a service like Eyetech to do it for you - it could mean the difference
between having one fried amiga or two + a useless 1266.  My searches
seem to indicate that there are no troubles with any specific
mainboard revisions with the A1266 in particular, just general
mainboard problems with fast accelerators with some revisions. If you
do have rev 2B, then that could be why your 1266 is not working. Most
pages just said that the Apollo 1266 was a troublesome card, but it
beats what i've got ;)

See http://amiga.emugaming.com/1200mod.html. Below is also what is in
the A1200Hardware_v2.guide file off aminet. That same archive also has
some specific info on the Apollo 1260, but only jumper settings and
board layout and general problems, and specs.

I have heard that some A1200's have problems with PowerPC cards.

How do I know if my Amiga will have problems and how can it be fixed?
The problems occur on A1200's that use the 1.D.4 and 2B motherboards.
You can  find the board revision by looking inside your A1200 on the
board. These include some of the later Commodore and all Escom systems. If you have one of
these boards you will encounter problems when adding faster
processors, serial, Zorro devices, etc. These can be fixed by taking
the motherboard to Eyetech ( http://www.eyetech.co.uk), who charge
 30, or Power Computing (http://www.powerc.com) who can perform the
"downgrade" for  20. If you fancy trying to fix it yourself
information on the upgrade can be found in the A1200 Hardware Guide,
available on Aminet at hard/misc/A1200Hardware.lha. The relevant
section is shown below:  Motherboard Modifications  As with most
machines, the A1200 left the factory with a few design flaws.  Most of
these won't affect anybody, but they can stop some accelerators  from
working. Here are the modifications that should be made for a
"perfect" A1200;
{p} {p}
REV 1D.4  Budgie REV -01
{p} {p}
 Remove E123C and E125C from the A1200 motherboard
{p} {p}
Budgie REV -02
{p} {p}
 Remove E123C and E125C from the A1200 motherboard{p}
 Remove XR358 470 ohm pull-up resistor{p}
 Add 470 ohm pull up resistor at pin 43 of U, ie the Alice chip
{p} {p}
REV 2B  Budgie REV -01 and -02
{p} {p}
 Remove E123C and E125C from the A1200 motherboard{p}
 Add 470 ohm pull-up at pin 43 of U2, ie the Alice chip{p}
 Change R118 from 470 ohm to 220 ohm
