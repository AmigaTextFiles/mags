18-October-2000: Freespace I Amiga progress report by Steffen Haeuser and
Mathias Roslund (with some editing at AIO..)
{p} {p}
Software & hardware renderer
{p} {p}
As you are able to optionally see from the screenshots on
http://www.hyperion-software.com/freespace_progress_01.html, Freespace runs
already on both Fullscreen and Workbench window. Support for graphics boards,
AGA, Picasso 96 PIP and optional double/triplebuffering is included. As
Freespace uses a minimal resolution of 640x480 a graphics card is strongly
recommended as AGA is quite slow in this resolution.
{p} {p}
Currently only the software renderer is implemented, but work will
start on the 3D hardware accelerated version once the software
version is further along. The 3D hardware version will be based on
MiniGL and we have even some hope for owners of the old Virge-based
graphics boards.
{p} {p}
Work in the field of the 3D engine of Freespace which had to be done
was adapting the model code of Freespace to big-endian style CPUs
(like the 68k and the PowerPC) which was quite some work. Also the
texturemappers were - and partially still are - done in x86
assembler, and there are a lot of them. Rewriting all those different
texturemappers is probably the most time-consuming aspect of the
whole Freespace port.
{p} {p}
There is however light at the end of the tunnel, and most of the
texturemappers are in the meanwhile converted to C. There is still
room for optimization though, which will be especially important for
a possible 68k version.
{p} {p}
It is currently impossible to say how satisfactory Freespace will run
on a 68k processor but hope is permitted for version a 68060 and
possibly even a 68040 with 3D accelerator. Even with the still
unoptimized texturemappers, Freespace runs at an optimal framerate on
a 150 Mhz 604e Cyberstorm PPC.

Input Devices
{p} {p}
Freespace supports PSX Port, CD 32 pads/joysticks, mouse and keyboard. This is
already fully implemented. Owners of PSX joypads can also use the analogue
sticks of their pads. The final version of the game will also support
Flightstick CH compatible analogue joysticks.
{p} {p}
Animations
{p} {p}
Freespace features impressive intro-animations as well as in-game cut-scenes.
The cut-scenes use a proprietary format from Interplay (MVE) which we have
recently licensed and ANIM for small in-game animations like ships, moving
objects in the menus and such.
{p} {p}
Sound: Remains to be implemented.
{p} {p}
Networking Support: Not implemented yet but no problems are expected.
