I can already hear the groans but bear with me on this one.

I know chess is not to everyone's liking but I like a good game now
and then and, as a computer game, chess has always been around. I had
one on my ZX81!!! The Amiga has not had a decent chess release for
years (I think The Complete Chess System was the last one that was
any good) unlike the PC. With this in mind I thought I'd have a root
round the Aminet and I've come across a pearl from Stefan Salewski.

Once the game has loaded you are confronted by five windows and only
one has the chessboard. The graphics for which are nothing to write
home about. The first thing you must do is set the game to your
personal strength. Unfortunately there's no "You're Pants" level so I
had to make do with a ten second think time for the Amiga (there is a
custom setting where you can give the Amiga a think time of less than
10 seconds if you want). Then choose "New Game" and you're away.

As the game progresses the 5 boxes become apparent. I'd only use
these if I were playing a serious game with a much longer computer
think time. In ten seconds you really don't need to know what the
computer is thinking or how it is planning its moves. It's also
cheating isn't it? You can either input your moves via the keyboard
or use the mouse (the better option). And after a couple of moves you
turn the annoying beep off that signals the computer has moved.

VChess plays a very good game of chess and the menu has so many
options I'd not fit them into this review. There's the usual solve
for mate, save, print, display options and set up which belong in any
chess game and I have no problems with the graphics. You don't need
great graphics to get hammered. I would recommend anyone who needs a
chess game to check this out.
