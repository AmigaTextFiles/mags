{subhead}MorphOS, beta 2{def}
{left}
{p} {p}
The second beta of the PowerPC native AmigaOS, MorphOS, is available from
http://www.morphos.de/
{p} {p}
Bug fixes, more PPC native code and better BlizzardPPC support is included.
{p} {p}
MorphOS is an operating system dedicated to bringing the AmigaOS to
PowerPC, by actually taking the AmigaOS and running it under a 68k
emulation, while the components of the OS are replaced by new PPC
native components. Exec, some SCSI drivers and some more bits are
already PPC native.
