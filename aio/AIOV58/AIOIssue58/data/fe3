Well, getting closr to Summer here where I am and I'm not sure which
I'm waiting for the most; the new Amiga or the new Star Wars movie. 
Well, in an effort to cleanse my mental pallet and try not to think of
such things (must...have new... Star Wars playing... on new... Amiga...
AAAAaaa!), I bring you these disparate sites...

{bold}Speed Racer Fan Site{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.speedracer.com/{noitalic}{p}
Hey, I grew up on this stuff so I can review it if I want, so there
:P.{p}
Be that as it may, click on the central picture and you'll find
yourself in a fan site to this classic Anime that includes an
overview of the Mach 5's control panel, episode guides, character
outlines, theme song, and even rumors of a live-action movie in the
works.  That last would be worth it just to see them do up the car.

{bold}Tarantulas.com{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.tarantulas.com/{noitalic}{p}
Spiders, big and hairy, a gallery of pictures, articles on such things
s how to sex a tarantula, what more could you ask for?  Everything
except for the real thing pipped through your moedem... which is
probably a {italic}good{noitalic} thing.

{bold}The Official Odd Rods Web Site{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.oddrods.com/{noitalic}{p}
What?!  You don't know what an Odd Rod is?!?  Well, having collected
these things myself back in third grade, and still owning about every
single one of them, let me tell you that they were the wierdest color
pics to ever come out on bubblegum cards.  Just look over the scanned
shots they include to see what I mean.  If you've seen Odd Rods then
here's a piece of nostaligia, if not then you're in for a treat. 
These things are just plain {italic}wierd{noitalic} (but in a good
way).

{bold}>Today's Cartoon by Randy Glasbergen{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.glasbergen.com/{noitalic}{p}
Just another daily cartoon site... with about a thousand or so other
cartoons categorized by type for easier browsing.  Some funny stuff
worth checking out.

{bold}Space.com{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.space.com/{noitalic}{p}
Okay, so I {italic}was{noitalic} going to put an Episode II web site
up here after all, but it wouldn't load (probably everyone else on
the planet trying to get in) so here we are.{p}
If it's about space, it seems to be on this site.  News, articles,
space on TV, space oriented games and science fiction stories, the
whole bit.  Just like a couple of paper mags I used to get.  I could
spend a few paragraphs just on the range of topics I've found here.{p}
News on the Hubble telescope, reports on Mars missions, space news,
technology, a theory that uses gravstars to replace blackholes, the
five great cosmic mysteries, SETI,... you get the idea.  There's also
space images, space quizes, design your own alien, and a whole lot
more.{p}
I can think of worse ways of taking up space, and when it comes to the
kind hanging up above us this site's top knotch.
