Word Processors.  I don't think anyone's making any commercial
wordprocessors for the Amiga anymore (Pagestream's not really a
wordprocessor), so for those that can get a hold of a copy of
something a bit old, here's a capsule summary.  Final Writer creates
files that are 2 or 3 times larger then they should be.  Worworth is
very good, but stick to version 6; version 7 is a bit buggy and when
it's autospell check is turned on it will go through the ENTIRE
document flagging misspelled words with little popup lists, instead of
just starting from where you are in that document. kind of annoying
and a BIG slow down for large documents.

Want a good file converter for really old word processor files?  Find
an old copy of Proper Grammer.  It may have been an okay grammer
checker but it was a fantastic file converter.

Databases.  If you're still using the old commercial ones then here's
another summary for you.  Final Data works only in list mode and is
great for inline editing with a list of records you need to see all at
once. Twist has a  great record mode with good design features, but
you can't edit at all in list mode, only in record mode.   Datastore
dosn't have as good a record mode as Twist, and it's only list mode is
to view a report, which makes it overall a bit mediocre.
