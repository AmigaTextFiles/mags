DVD, ZIPs, CDs, there's a lot of removeable media out there but how
many of them can be used on the Amiga and how?  Well, there are some
options and best of all they're all available on Aminet.{pp}
For those that still have Sysjets, there's an old archive
"Sysjet-Driver.lha" on Aminet.  It has driver files for Amige, Mac,
and PC-DOS.  LS_Mount.lha can handle the LS-120 for both Amiga and
PC-DOS.  IoJaz2Gb.lha will handle 2GB Jaz for Amiga nd 1 and 2 GB for
PCs.  CD-ROM drivers come aplenty both on Aminet and in the latest OS
updates, not to mention drivers for ZIP.{pp}
MakeDrivers_DVD-RAM.lha is a big winner here, able to make mount files
for DVD UDF Bridge, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM and DVD-Video, and DVD-RAM Versions 1 & 2
(2.6 GB, 4.7 GB).  In genral though, if you can hook it up to a SCSI
cable then the Amiga can use it, it's just a matter of making the
correct mount files with your text editor.  Sometimes you can get a
few hits by examining an existing PC mountfile that someone else did
up, or just download some basic specs about the media's geometry and
start experimenting.
