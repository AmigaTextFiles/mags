Okay, so the first thing you're asking is what happened to issue 57? 
Well it went to CD as promised, but unfortunately that CD has been
delayed (the usual technical reasons beyond our control), but it WILL
come out... just perhaps a bit late.  In fact, issue 57 could very well
come out the week after issue 58.  But don't worry, the CD also
contains issues 1 {bold}through{nobold} 57 so there'll be plenty for
everyone.  When it's available, purchase information for "AIO The
Survivor Years" will be posted on both the AIO site and all the usual
news sites.  So have faith.
{pp}Hey, we Amiga people are {italic}used{noitalic} to waiting for
things, right?
