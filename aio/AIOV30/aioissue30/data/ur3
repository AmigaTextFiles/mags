Frogger is a MPEG Video player for 68k and PPC.
{p} {p}
It doesn't need any installation, just copy the preferred exe (depending on your CPU)
and copy the Guide if you want...
{p} {p}
Frogger doesn't work good at all on my 060 (I guess it's meant for PPC users so),
it's crashing and giving CyberGuard hits and so on... So I can't write any more
about it really...
{p} {p}
It has a very nice Guide describing the features and such...
