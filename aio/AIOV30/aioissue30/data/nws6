The Amiga Volunteer Project ( {link http://welcome.to/tavp}http://welcome.to/tavp{end} ) is a non-profit
organisation created with the intention of assisting Amiga software
developers with free assistance.
{p} {p}
They are attempting to form a group of programs, musicians, artists and
other skilled people to not only help existing developers, but also
possibly port games from the PC.
{p} {p}
Although porting games from other platforms is a huge job for people
working free to do, it looks like an interesting attempt to boost the Amiga
software market.  More information on joining them is available on their
website.
