Open Letter to Amiga, Inc. President Thomas Schmidt{p}
October 18, 1999
{p} {p}
Dear Mr. Schmidt:
{p} {p}
First of all, we want to congratulate you on your new position as
president of Amiga. We are sure that you have many exciting plans
for the future  of Amiga, Inc. and that we can expect many new
innovations from your  company in the months and years ahead. This
is indeed an exciting time for the computer industry, a time of
great upheaval and change, and holds much promise for the success and
growth of ambitious upstart companies like Amiga, Inc.
{p} {p}
We have been following the recent events at Amiga, Inc. with great
interest, beginning with the resignation of former Amiga president
Jim Collas.
{p} {p}
We were, of course, upset to see Jim Collas leave the company. He was
a man many in the community trusted to successfully lead  the company
into the future. Wherever he is now, and whatever he is doing, we in
the community wish him well.
{p} {p}
But this is not a time to be looking back on events of the past.  It
is a time to be focusing on what lies directly ahead in the future of
the computing industry.
{p} {p}
Our organisation is unique in the Amiga community. We understand
both the needs of the Amiga community, balanced with the needs of a
business like Amiga, Inc.
{p} {p}
We do not believe, like some in the community, that the wishes of the
Amiga community and the needs of Amiga, Inc. are mutually exclusive.
Likewise, we do not believe that success of Amiga, Inc. as a company
is mutually exclusive with satisfying the needs and expectations of
the Amiga community.
{p} {p}
Our group was formed with a simple goal: to find a
mutually-satisfactory solution to current tensions that exist between
many in the community and Amiga, Inc. - a solution that would be
satisfactory, indeed beneficial, to both groups. We believe, after
several weeks of discussion and exchanging of ideas, that we have
found such a solution. We believe that this solution is to
open-source the Amiga operating system. We present our reasons for
believing this in our report, "AmigaOS: The Case for Open Source," a
copy of which should have been sent to you already on our behalf, by
Amiga Vice President Mr. Petro Tyschtschenko.
{p} {p}
Our report is the result of several weeks of work and consultation
with many individuals in the Amiga, Open Source and Linux
communities, including famous open-source advocate Eric Raymond, who
acted as a consultant for Netscape on their open-source strategy. We
believe our report presents a powerful case that open-sourcing the
Amiga operating system would bring many advantages, and future 
business opportunities, to Amiga, Inc. and would at the same time
satisfy the needs of the Amiga community for continuity and
continuous improvement of the Amiga operating system.
{p} {p}
We therefore respectfully submit our report, "AmigaOS: The Case for
Open Source," for your review and consideration.
{p} {p}
We, of course, do not expect the report to fully and complete answer
each and every question you may have on the subject of open-source,
or why we believe it is the ideal solution to the current volatile
Amiga situation - but we do, however, believe it is a good start, and
we hope that you will be made curious enough by the contents of  the
report, to establish a dialogue with us on the matter, and to
consider working with us in an attempt to find a mutually
satisfactory solution to the current Amiga situation.
{p} {p}
Your nomination to president of a young, ambitious, innovative
upstart company like Amiga, Inc. could not have come at a better
time. The next several months and years will be an exciting time to
be a player in the ever-changing fast-paced computing industry.
{p} {p}
Whatever direction Amiga takes, we wish you and Amiga, Inc. every
success in the future.
{p} {p}
We look forward to your response.{p}
Respectfully,{p}
Steve Crietzman ({bold}president@savetheamiga.org.uk{nobold}){p}
