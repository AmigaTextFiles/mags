ClockedX is a program that performs different actions at specified times...
{p} {p}
The installation is easy, just copy the exe that matches your CPU and then run it,
preferably from WBstartup drawer.
{p} {p}
Then you can set so it checks for viruses at 12:00:00 every day or anything else.
And while it's being run in the background it doesn't steal any CPU time at all...
{p} {p}
I don't find this program any good, since it's quite hard to setup, because it has
a strange way of letting you run stuff...
{p} {p}
You can't either specify that it should run this and that at a specified day (like
one time a week), it must be run every single day... There is alot better programs
that can do this, can't remember their names right now..
{p} {p}
It's written in AmigaE (compiled with CreativeE, which is a new version of AmigaE
since AmigaE compiler sources was freely made... The first program I see that
uses CreativeE ;) (Just a sidenote))
{p} {p}
The documentation is quite long, it's only a text file, but it will make you
understand how to use the program so I guess it's enough.
