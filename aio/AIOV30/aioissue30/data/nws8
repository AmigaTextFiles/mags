{subhead} DOpus 5.82 update{def}
{left}
{p} {p}

AmigaOS 3.5 has introduced a new, superior icon system and not to be left
out, GPSoft have added support for it to DOpus Magellan II as well.
{p} {p}
As mentioned on their website, the AmigaOS 3.5 installation also causes
problems for DOpus users, as it will replace the LoadWB command with the
real thing, rather than the DOpus replacement.
{p} {p}
To fix this, open a Shell,{p}
CD to the C: directory ("C:"),
{p} {p}
Check the version of LoadWB. For OS 3.5 it will be version 44.xx something.
For Opus it will be LoadDB 62.0 or similar ("Version LoadWB").
{p} {p}
If it is OS 3.5, "copy LoadWB to LoadWB_old"{p}
then copy "DOpus5:C/LoadDB to C:LoadWB"{p}
then reboot to boot Opus as Workbench replacement.
