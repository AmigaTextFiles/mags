Just a few ecclectic tips this month. No particular order or theme, so
hgere we go.

Gif vs Jpeg{p}
In designing a web page, when is it best to use Gif versus
Jpeg? Well, here's a tip. No matter how you strike it, fr pictures under
8 bit, Gifs will always be smaller in file size then Jpegs, because a
jpeg will convert even just an 8 bit picture into a full 24-bit
pallette,which takes up more room. So for simple pics, jpegs don't
always give the best file size versus lossless formats.

Also, another Gif tip; sometimes a picture that looks good on one
non-Amiga browser doesn't on another. I've traced this down to the
packing of colors. Use something like ArtPro to pack away all unused
colors in your Gif image and then resave it; the resultant image will
look good on any browser.

OS3.5 DOpus compatibility.{p}
If you have OS3.5 and use DOpus Magellan,
then get the new 5.82 Sopus patch. It will fix the icon rendering
problems introduced with 3.5.

Hard Drive Optimizing.{p}
It's a good idea to optimize your hard drive
every so often, expecially if you been doing a lot of writing and
deleting of small files on a given partition. ReOrg or QuarterBack Tools
are both good disk optimizers.

DiskSpare vs OS3.5 compatibility.{p}
Just one more last-minute hint that was discovered too late to make it 
into the main OS review, there IS a way to make High Density Diskspare 
disks readable under 3.5, and the solution lies in the mountlist. The 
original DiskSpare distribution gives the value for BlocksPerTrack at
"12" for both it's Double Density and High Density mountfiles. Merely 
change the BlocksPerTrack to "24" for High Density disks and all your old
DiskSpare disks will now read perfectly under 3.5 AND 3.1.  Double 
Density disks will read without change. Just make sure that you have the 
latest version 3.3 of DiskSpare.
