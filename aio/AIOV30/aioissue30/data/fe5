 Well folks, I just recieved a letter directed to the members of ADA
outlining the plans to bury the Amiga as originally obtained from an
insider at Amiga.  According to said insider: "AI was formed by a
bunch of guys... we will NOT be building any computers, as we see
that to be a dead end in five years or so up the road."
{p} {p}
Further details of the plan- and I'm quoting from the actual letter
here- are as follows:
{p} {p}
"...Act Dumb and Claim need time to organize using an excessive
amount of time. (fortify these procedures with constant public miss
information and confusing statements)
{p} {p}
Make Claims of several solid business plans , But reveal nothing at
any time unless it is to effect a lower dwindling Amiga base.
{p} {p}
Alienation, speak to no one at any time officially to gather a
consensus or to address developers concerns. Sign NO developers
contracts or make no specifics to address ANYTHING IN ANY IMMEDIATE
NEEDS OF ANYONE AT ANY TIME..."
{p} {p}
Then as proof that not one Amiga Developer of a major system was
offered a contract, ADA sights:
{p} {p}
"... 1) NEWTEK  ( Toaster/flyer bundled project, New Flyer Millennium
Upgrade delayed due to Petro refusing to talk since 1993)
{p} {p}
2) PHASE5 (PPC- G3 - G4)
{p} {p}
3) QNX a publicly announced Partner (no contract was signed, but was
presented at the table)
{p} {p}
4) fleecy MOSS hired then only as contract labor (never commit to any
one for anything)
{p} {p}
5) Mick Tinker Boxer 5 years in the making, and Petro personally
dismantled it time and time again.
{p} {p}
6) The formation of the ADA group  only under legal duress was a
meeting agreed to after 2 years 6 months of trying to address
everyone needs from dealers, developers and licensee.
{p} {p}
7) Amiga CONSISTENTLY FORCES THEIR VIEW OF WHAT AMIGA IS supposed to
be to the AMIGA community. Sole intent is to SEE the Community
disbanded due to a direct conflict of Gateway's NEED to be the sole
maker and distributor of any AMIGA products."
{p} {p}
At this point, ADA goes on to claim that the stated process has been
accelerated due to the unexpected actions of ADA and others.  Is any
of this true?  So much has been hapening, good and bad, of late that
it's hard to tell who the good guys are.  So, in that regard, I will
leave you to judge.
{p} {p}
I do offer this one piece of advice.  We cannot afford to be a lax
community; we must not take anymore excuses or delays.  It didn't
take this long to originally design and build the first Amiga, how
can it take this long to bring it back?
{p} {p}
Be alert, accept no compromise, and lend what help and talent you
might have to the Community at large.  Let the powers that be know
that it is to their financial benefit to bring the Amiga back and
that the Amiga Community is a more powerful tool to be tapped than
any tax break, the potential financial gain from our legendary
machine far more than any payoff they might gain from the
Gates-Wintel empire.
