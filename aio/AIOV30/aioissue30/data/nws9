RTG software has been released.

The software, which has had about 60 improvements since the last release,
is used to operate graphics cards such as the PicassoIV and CyberVisions
with AmigaOS in as friendly and compatible a fashion as possible.

It's available from both the website {link http://picasso96.home.pages.de/}http://picasso96.home.pages.de/{end} and
The Killing Ground BBS.
