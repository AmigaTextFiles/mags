<hell_123> heheheh :){p}
<PTYSCH> Thaank you for the compliments.ga{p}
<JPJ> Some time ago I read that Amiga was to sell a1200's with G3
card in an Elbox tower as a total package. Is this still planned?
Would you consider selling systems based on IBM's PPC CHRP design,
say with PowerOS onboard, as substitute Amiga's? GA{p}
<Pseudo> queue: JPJ Kraftwerk _bladez_ liluh Lizard{p}
<PTYSCH> You should know that I am always listten to the Community. I
get daily around 100 emails and you can proof it I am always
answering those by my self...ga{p}
<Kraftwerk> Are more efforts being put into making the PPC.library
emulation under WArpOS more complete? When can we expect the first
OS3.5 service pack? GA{p}
<Pseudo> queue: _bladez_ liluh Lizard JPJ cYB0rG{p}
<PTYSCH> I have planned a project to port AMIGA OS, my old dream to
ppc.....If we have an existing hardway like standard IBM board...we
have a chance to continue .ga{p}
<_bladez_> Greetings from some of the Amiga Downunder 99 organisers
... blaz, krash & doug :).  Has Jurgen taken his Akubra hat off yet?
... and did you enjoy the vegemite and your Akubra? =)  What is Amiga
doing to support all of the efforts going on atm and what sort of
support are we expect to see downunder?{p}
<Pseudo> queue: liluh Lizard JPJ cYB0rG{p}
<PTYSCH> Hi. AMIGA Downunder...I am missing you here in Cologne..ga{p}
<liluh> I know that Amiga is facing some problems now, im not sure{p}
<liluh> what is happening there. Is Amiga USA still prospering?{p}
<liluh> What are Amiga future plans? What will Gateway do with our{p}
<liluh> company?GA{p}
<PTYSCH> I can not answer you this question, because I am not
involved in the USA Organisation...ga{p}
<Lizard> If 3.6 (or 4.0) is released, will there be a new kickstart
too? And there was supposed to be a booklet with the history of Amiga
to be included with 3.5? It suddenly disappeared from the
announcements{p}
<Pseudo> queue: JPJ cYB0rG petro Senex{p}
<Pseudo> queue: JPJ cYB0rG petro Senex Ando{p}
<PTYSCH> I think the new OS should be PPC.....It was not planned from
myside the AMIGA story in the OS 3.5....I am planning ti issue a
book, called "AMIGA - my live" ga{p}
<JPJ> What are your feelings on Sun joining forces with Sony to
co-develope information appliances communicating through Java/Jini?
This is what Amiga Inc. should have been doing already, now, they
seem to have lost the edge. Also, could you say more about this
project to port AmigaOS to PPC? GA{p}
<PTYSCH> Cannot comment this now...have to see what happens in the
next couple of months.ga{p}
<Pseudo> go ahead cYB0rG{p}
<cYB0rG> hIYA petro, when a new hardware will be out ? old A4k or
A1200 is really old ... Amigans need a new platform (and new OS too).
Do u have planified something about that ?. GA{p}
<Pseudo> queue: petro Senex Ando JPJ Dirk-B Syke{p}
<siren> Petro, what can Amiga users look forward to from you after
the Cologne show? Any plans for Christmas or early next year?{p}
<Pseudo> queue: petro Senex Ando JPJ Dirk-B Syke drHirudo Kraftwerk{p}
<PTYSCH> I can not argue..A 1200 is old...in some conztries still
very popular. But in Europe it is unsellable as a computer. I have
customers build up and new markets for our beloved AMIGA technology
as imbedded systems like slot machines, entertainment machines
etc..ga{p}
<Petro> What is your opinion of Gateway "selling out" on the Amiga
hardware? (ie just producing the os, probably for lame peecees){p}
<Pseudo> queue: Senex Ando JPJ Dirk-B Syke drHirudo Kraftwerk ^asp^
Fanger{p}
<PTYSCH> iren, I have to keep my sales on going....thats
important..and that is my plan before christmas..I have organised in
Delhi a fair with an AMIGA BOOTH...together with my Indian
Distributor....ga{p}
<Senex> Are you authorized by AI-USA/GW to decide by yourself if to
let someone like H&P do a PPC-port of AmigaOS if they'd want?{p}
<PTYSCH> Senex: As long it does not cost any money I see no
problems...I have also driven the OS 3.5 project...ga{p}
<JPJ> According to the latest statements from Tom Scmidt, the Amiga
OE will be ported to/available for a number of platforms, not merely
Linux/Windoze. Have you heard any plans about making the Operating
Environment available for OS 3.5 and higher? Thanks for all your good
work! GA{p}
<Pseudo> queue: Dirk-B Syke drHirudo Kraftwerk ^asp^ Fanger{p}
<PTYSCH> No, as I told you before I have heard not very much from my
US collegues....I will of course support their efforts which will
help AMIGA.ga{p}
<Dirk-B> Hi Petro. Is it possible to port Amiga OS, or parts of it,
to the PPC? ga{p}
<PTYSCH> Yes I think there is already done some work..and I am
confinced that H&P can be doing this in a relative shor time..ga{p}
<Syke> 'lo Petro, Do you have any contact with the people in the US?
Whats up with that "alll the phone numbers have been disconnected"?
Also, I'm planning a terrorist attack at a local Gateway store, could
you sponsor me with some fundings? (Napalm ain't cheap these days) 
;) GA{p}
<Pseudo> queue: drHirudo Kraftwerk ^asp^ Fanger JPJ
<Pseudo> for beeing added to queuelist /msg Pseudo ?
<PTYSCH> Do not be emotional...please....Do not forget that Gateway
have sved AMIGA out of the bankruptcy in 1997....{p}
<drHirudo> Petro:I haven't seen any commersials for Amiga from Years.
How the young people without Amiga friends will know for existing of
this Great Computer? GA{p}
<Pseudo> queue: Kraftwerk ^asp^ Fanger JPJ BobF cYB0rG{p}
<PTYSCH> I think that we have to wait with commercials, just in this
difficult situation...ga{p}
<Kraftwerk> The MCC may have been scrapped by Gateway, but has any
third party expressed interest in the MCC designs?  What about a
joint venture with Amiga developers to produce the MCC hardware?{p}
<Kraftwerk> GA{p}
<PTYSCH> I have no information about MCC projects sofar..ga{p}
<^asp^> Hi Petro, long time no chat, it would be great if the Boxer
had official Amiga Support. Could it be the next official Amiga. This
may make a good interim solution ?  GA{p}
<Pseudo> queue: Fanger JPJ BobF cYB0rG petrol{p}
<Pseudo> queue: Fanger JPJ BobF cYB0rG petrol Syke{p}
<PTYSCH> I think that the boxer is a good alternative...but for me it
is a never ending story..because it takes alread three years and a
lot of promises this machine is announced so many times and always
vapoware..unfortuneately...I can believ  any stories anymore...ge{p}
<Fanger> Hello from USA Ca. Petro, can i git some AmiCola ;-) or
win we can git that here in the states, sorry nothing else to
ask...keep up the good work{p}
<PTYSCH> I have no problem to supply you AMICOLA...The problem is
that I can not import any food to the USA..There are law
restrictions.ga{p}
<Pseudo> queue: JPJ BobF cYB0rG petrol Syke DarkHawke dcoldwell{p}
<JPJ> Petro, since there is a potential for AmigaOS on PPC, wouldn't
it make sense to work with Phase5? If they can realise their
'AmirageK2' machine, it would also help them to sell more machines if
they can offer a choice between AmigaOs or QNX (or both). Currently
they plan to emulate AmigaOS, but purists will always choose AmigaOs
first. Lets all buy AmigaOs 3.5 to help Petro and allow for a port to
PPC!! Thanks.{p}
<PTYSCH> So Amigians I think I have to rush to my booth..Thanks for
keeping our beloved AMIGA alive and again many greeting from the
Cologne Fair...Petro ga{p}
<Pseudo> queue: BobF cYB0rG petrol Syke DarkHawke dcoldwell OddBod{p}
<siren> Thank you, Petro.{p}
<BobF> So the MCC then, was it ever going to be a proper computer,
e.g were the designs for it, and if so what is happening to them now.
If not, why have we been dragged along into thinking there would be a
new miggy when there wasn't going to be 1 at all? GA{p}
<Pseudo> sorry, guys, Petro has to go.{p}
<BobF> bite l8 now you've gone though :({p}
<PTYSCH> Sorry I realy do not know the answer...Petro  ga{p}
<Pseudo> last answer{p}
<Pseudo> thx a lot Petro{p}
<siren> Thank you Petro.
