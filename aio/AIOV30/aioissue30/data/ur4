Miggy V1.0 is yet another attempt at artificial intelligence, 100% written in
assembler.

One really fun thing is that the first version was written in *Late '89*, yes, that's
right! ;) So it has been developed for 10 years (minus alot of them ;) )...

Miggy isn't that smart from the beginning.. But when you ask it a question, then
it will say what's the best match was (ie 80%), so if it's not 100% then you can
go into learn mode and then Miggy will learn that too, so after a while you will
have a real clever artificial "person"...

This is very fun to play with from time to time, and why not give a well learned
Miggy to a friend at his birthday? ;)
