Arkanos may for some of you sound familiar and the very reason for that
is the first version was reviewed way back in issue 24 with a quote
something along the lines of, "The game is satifactory". The game back
the was reviewed by our past games editor, Lee Hesselden finding in the
depths of his knowledge to bless this game with a low score of just
51%.

Lee has since left and now I find myself in the position to review this
latest version. As I did not try the first version I can't say what
has improved or been changed but one major difference is the game now
has no register locks or messages because the game has become freeware.
As in the first version though if you want the level editor you have
to pay for it which may only be worth it if your totally addicted to
this game, the cost you will be charged for this service is 100 ATS,
15 DM, 10 US-dollar or 10 EUROS.

If you haven't already figured out by the title of the game, this game
is an arkanoid style game. In this it means you have a paddle at the
bottom of the screen and a ball that bounces around removing blocks
as you hit them. Your aim is to make sure the ball doesn't go out of
the bottom of the screen and to be there when the ball returns to
bang it right back up again to remove more blocks.

Of late the Aminet has not been blessed with many games and the quality
of most has been average to poor. I have been waiting for a game to
satisfy my needs even for only a little while and this is the game that
has done that for me. I know there have been plenty of Arkanoid games
before and its not the most original concept these days but I've wasted
quite a bit of time playing this little offering.

I'm sure you all know what an Arkanoid style game is so I won't bother
going over what you should already know by now. One thing that sets this
game apart from other Arkanoid clones is the fact that you have plenty
of different bonuses and plenty of various blocks. The bonuses come
regularly which can sometimes be a blessing but other times be a nightmere
where you see that 'loose a life' block for the 823rd time. As I say you
do get alot of chances at bonuses ranging from shooting paddle to extra
lives, there are a few you should try and avoid like the loose a life
and the restart the level 'bonus'.

Overall if you've been looking for a game which will keep you entertained
in these long winter (summer for australians) months then take a look
at Arkanos V1.01. It may not be the most original game and the graphics
aren't outstanding but its a nice attempt and something i'd like to see
more of on the Aminet these days.
