MrE's Compendium is a collection of 5 games written by Steve Eaborn from
various periods of time. By this I mean some games are newer and some are
older as far back as 1993 and maybe before. As far as I can tell all the
games are made in Amos. For all those Amos buffs out there, these games
come with source code for you to see how they where done.

Each game has own genre and there are not two or more of the same type.
They all have PD quality graphics but are to quite a high standard and all
follow the similar standards. On with the indivdual games..

{bold}Connect 4:{nobold}
{p} {p}
Connect 4 is the old childs game. The idea is to drop your 'counters'
into some kind of board and get four in a row. This may sound easy but
two players take it in turn. One drops in a red counter then the next
drops in a yellow counter and so on. You can block the other player or
you can yourself make it a situation where you are going to win no
matter where they block. Its a game of skill. As with all the games in
the collection the graphics are quite good for a game of this type,
especially one in a compilation of games. You can play Human Vs. Amiga,
Amiga Vs. Human (I think these are the same), Amiga Vs. Amiga or lastely
Human Vs. Human so you do have quite a bit of choice.

{bold}Mazeman:{nobold}

Mazeman is a pacman game and although looked good when the demo was running
I couldn't figure out exactly how to start the game. Moving the joystick,
clicking the mouse and pressing every key there is produced no effect, if
you can get the game running them i'm sure it is quite good from the demo
I saw running but other than that I couldn't really say. Oh dear.

{bold}Missile:{nobold}
{p} {p}
Missile is a version of the classic game Missile Command. Every type of
these games has a different story line but the idea is you have bases
on the ground and missiles come flying towards them. You have to shoot
up a missle to destroy the incoming ones. This may sound easy to start
with but you have the place it just under the enemy missiles otherwise
byt the time your missile is up their the incoming missile will have passed.

{bold}Patience:{nobold}
{p} {p}
Patience is as the title suggest a version of Patience the card game for
one player. I have never fully understoof how to play this game and I could
not find any playing instructions built in or external documents. The graphics
are as with the other games quite acceptable and if you like Patience then
i'm sure you'll love this. I do have a rough idea how to play but I think
for the full experience you will need a previous knowledge of the game. Now
where did I leave the "how to play patience" book...?

{bold}ReelSkill:{nobold}
{p} {p}
This is possibily the only game in the collection that doesn't have a name
that gives away the game genre so easily. If you haven't already worked it
out then it is a Fruit Machine simulator. It is your basic simulator of
a fruit machine, nothing new, flashing lights, cheesy sounds and all the
nudge and hold to keep you going for the next year. If you like these sims
you'll love this.
{p} {p}
Overall the compilation has some classic game styles. None of the game ideas
are new and no new features as far as I could tell have been added in. The
graphics and sounds are more than acceptable and if your a classics fan then
i'm sure you'll appreciate the downloading of this gem.
