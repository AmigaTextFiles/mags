It's too soon to say if this is the end of Microsoft: we must remember that
MS is rich enough to survive for decades without making any money (in
fact, one key element of the court decision was based on Microsoft
spending $100,000,000 a year on Internet Explorer, then giving it away
free to kill Netscape).

There's too much to go into detail with here, as the judge who made the
announcement made it with a near 300 page document, but it's a nice thing
to know that not every government loves Bill Gates...
