This little program can give you all the codes of the Amiga character set, in
decimal and hexadecimal forms.

AsciiTable comes with an installation script, but it's not of much use, since it's
easier to just copy the dir to wherever you wanna have it! It also comes with a
french catalog tho', so that might be easier with the install script if you wanna
install the french catalog too.

This is a very good program to find out for example what this characters '¶'
hexadecimal or decimal value is (b6 / 182), so I guess AsciiTable is aimed towards
the people who is programming... You can also easily copy the character to
clipboard 0 for easy insertion in an editor or such!

It comes with a small readme but it's not much to read.
