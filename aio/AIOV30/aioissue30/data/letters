As always thankyou all for your letters but still i'm looking for more
and more so if you have an idea to save the Amiga, want to comment on
the magazine or maybe just shout at the top of your voice then write
in and we'll publish every letter we receive.

Hi
{p} {p}
I have read many other online magazines and realized that AIO is best.

Being a new reader to AIO I have been going through all the old issues.
I can definitely say the mag has improved with age. Anyway I was reading
AIO 29 & I came across the article "The Amiga Conspiacy"! What's going
on? Can this really have happened? To say I'm gobsmacked is a huge
understatement. If all that was printed in the article (and recent events
seem to support this) is true then this is all the Amiga comunity needs
to push it over the edge. I've seen it happen around me: people turning
to the Playstation & PC & ditching their Amigas. Fortunately I bought
them & have sold them to people new to the computing market as a full
"Home Computer Package". I've also bought a PC but still use the miggy
more than ever. It's not good news at all & I all but gave up on the
Amiga & might have done so but for positive magazines like yourselves &
AmigActive.
{p} {p}
I have to say that AmigActive is one of the best things to have happened
to the Amiga in some time. It's like a breath of positive, fresh air &
when you read it, it makes you realise how stagnent Amiga Format has
become. It can only do good stuff for the Amiga situation.
{p} {p}
Anyway I've said my bit & I'm now pinning my hopes on Phoenix. £900 for
the BoXer....It will have to be storming for me to even consider parting
with that much cash for a souped up 1200.

See ya.{p}
Bazza.

{italic}I'd like to thankyou for your comments and i'm glad you think that
our production has improved with age.
{p} {p}
The article "The Amiga Conspiacy" by our Articles Editor, Mark Tierno was
not truth but is something that could and might happen. I also agree that
AA is a very good magazine and although has less pages than AF seems to
cut out all the rubbish that AF includes.
{p} {p}
On a last note, although the BoXeR can only be good for the Amiga community
I will not just be buying one because the pressure of other people and
I can honestly not see me buying one at all. All too often people feel the
need they should buy something because it supports the Amiga and if you
don't make the purchase you are glared upon as someone who is not saving
the Amiga. £900+ on a 'jazzed' up Amiga is not something i'm willing to
spend money on and is not an idea I totally support. We need a new computer
and not just a built upon one. The PC is often refered to as a monster
computer because bits are just added on top and this is how the Amiga will
go.
{p} {p}
People might not agree with me but its everyones personal decision and
this is MY choice.
