This isn't fair, really. Voyager 3 (known as V³) is still in beta, although the
latest ones are publically available. Vaporwave didn't lie about V³ preview 1.
It was very buggy, and they said it was. Vaporware lied about V³pre5. They
claimed it was buggy and will crash at will - it has not crashed yet for me, so
far covering a month.

Voyager is an Internet web browser. It works on any reasonably powerful Amiga
(2MB is not really enough to view websites, even if you opt to not show
graphics) and is one of the 'top three' Amiga browsers - those three which are
the best known and most powerful: Voyager, IBrowse and AWeb.
{p} {p}
Voyager includes many of the new Internet technologies, including SSL - the
encryption system which the Internet depends upon for transactions. With this,
you can go buying anything over the Internet using your credit card. Something
else V³ supports is Shockwave Flash, a 'plug in' which is used by some website
for basic multimedia presentations. SSL in V³ is a little broken I find - using
the same plugin (V³ has a plug in system, which not only can be used by 3rd
parties but is also used extensively by V³ itself) with V2.95 lets me access the
Insight online store, but trying the same in V³ produces an SSL error. Since
Voyager can also use the Miami SSL libraries, I tried that with the same
results. Everywhere else I tried SSL worked perfectly. The Flash plugin isn't
perfect either, giving some inaccurate results sometimes but it does work well
in general and before now we haven't had any integrated Flash viewer!

The HTML display in Voyager is good, displaying most sites perfectly, but there
are problems which hopefully will be fixed for final release. For example, on
some sites columns which on other browsers are displayed side-by-side are
displayed vertically in Voyager. Elsewhere, such as on EBay UK, some text is
displayed partially off the left of the screen, with no way to scroll that text
back on.

I won't give Voyager a score, since this is a beta and does have some problems
left, but it's certainly fairing well for the finished product.
