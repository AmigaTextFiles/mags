WormWars is not what the name suggests. At first I thought it may be
similar to Worms by Team17 but it goes to show that you can not always
trust a game by its name. In the Aminet readme file it is described
as "WormWars 4.4: Advanced snake game". Meaning that it really is just
a snake game.

I don't know if the word 'Advanced' is called for because I really would
have chosen the word 'Weird'. You know your basic worms/snake game where
you go around eatting dots and collecting power-ups, well WormWars is
based around that idea but very 'Weird'.

The game has an option of 3D Isometric which means that it has a similar
view to games like Syndicate and maybe ThemePark could be classed Isometric
but it doesn't seem to come accross too well and in fact looks like a
fake isometric, oh well.

I couldn't really understand what was going on in the game. The documents
are long and do explain but by the time I'd finished them i'd forgotten
what to do and just pulled my joystick in any direction wondering if I
was doing the right thing. Through the game you get funny sounds and then
you end up dieing, I guess that answers my question to if I was doing it
right.

Overall i'm not impressed. You may wish to take a look but I like non
thinking games and this one requires you to read a bible sized document
before playing. "NEXT!"
