Gee, November and the Millenium's about to come crashing down on us.
Well, I'm not worried; I'll just hide behind my Ami and watch all the
PCs self-destruct. In the meantime, why don't you all take a look at
these stites I found...

In the year 2010 Disney Corp bought the entire state of Florida and
formed a new nation; an entire state devoted to entertainment the Disney
way. The ultimate paradise.
{p} {p}
Well, not everyone thinks so. Special interest groups have hired you to
go through all the Michael Eisner clones, tourists, and rug rats to find
and destroy the cryogenically frozen torso of Walt Disney and end his
reign of terror.

Sound like a game?  well, it is, for the MAC (break out your emulators
folks) and available freely for download. A MAC game, but the site is
still worth the pics and background story from the game.

Trying to remember all those obscure cartoon shows you really loved as a
kid? Or just a general Anime freak? Well, of all the Aniume sites I've
been searching through this one has the most complete list of Anime
from the 60s that I've seen, including several obscure ones I used to
enjoy that I'd been wracking my brain for ages trying to remember the
names of.
{p} {p}
You'll find synopsis, pics, and theme songs (though the WAV format used
is in Microsoft ADPCM format, but Play16 can handle it). The only
problem will be not burning half an evening reminicing like I did.

In celebration of the decision against our favorite Evil Empire, I bring
you this site. Keep up to date on all the news, dirty tricks, and plots
by and against Microsoft. Read readers outrages against Gates and his
Henchmen or check out the long list of Microsoft holdings and their
complete lack of true innovation. Whatever your taste, if it's
anti-Microsoft you'll find it here.

With 3.5 out I'm sure there's a bunch of things that all you people out
there think might have been done slightly better. Well, this site is the
place to log in your suggestions; post whatever little problems or
improvements you might think of and we'll see if it makes it to the
first service pack.

Urban Legends Reference Pages{p}

We've all heard them, those urban legends that no one can quite remember
who said first or where it originally came from, or even if it's true.
Well, here you'll find a categorized listing of all the urban legends
you could ask for.  From Halloween and Xmas to Music, Movies, and
Disney.
{p} {p}
Beside each legend is a colored dot to indicate if it's true, false,
undetermined origin, or unverifiable. So at a glance you can tell
what's real and what's bogus. The only problem here is that the red and
green dots are dithered so they look kind of similar unless you see
them side by side. As well, each legend has a link to a more
thorough discussion on the legend in question.
{p} {p}
A basic search engine is here, just enter a few key words and it'll
cough up any urban legends that involve them. Nothing fancy here, and
not case sensitive, but it'll do the job.
{p} {p}
Care to discuss some legends with other people? Then make a post on
their message board. Finally, there is a trvia Quiz on the material,
though the quiz uses Java applets.
{p} {p}
All in all a rather interesting site that should keep you entertained
for a while. Now, about this link to Sex Legends...
