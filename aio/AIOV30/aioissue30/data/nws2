Hello,
{p} {p}
This is nothing official, it's just a text file I've been meaning to write
about something called AMIGANET and how YOU can access it via the internet
without too much trouble.
{p} {p}
What is AMIGANET?  Well, AMIGANET at it's most simplist is a collection of
messages open to all who want to read them, writing them is no problem
either and the whole transport side of AMIGANET is taken care of by Bulletin
Board Systems (BBS) who give thier time and money to the cuase of making
AMIGANET work. It is similar to the internets mailing lists but thats where
the similarity ends.
{p} {p}
If you run a BBS system and don't take AMIGANET, why not? It's much
friendlier than Usenet newsgroups and contains as much information as those
too.
{p} {p}
If your a casual BBS USER then perhaps a point could be had from your
favourite BBS. This of course isn't always cost effective as long distance
calls are usually the order of the day, but now there is a way to get
AMIGANET, either as a NODE or a POINT without too much messing about and
cheaply too.
{p} {p}
I, personally, can offer AMIGANET feeds to NODES and POINTS via your email
account.
{p} {p}
My thinking here is all those systems that do not carry AMIGANET at all, we
all would welcome you into AMIGANET. Also, maybe you already have a node but
your access has been cut due to some unfortunate circumstances or your BBS
is out of the mainstream AMIGANET transport mechanism, whatever the reason I
offer you AMIGANET via email.
{p} {p}
I am not offering a telnet connection, I am not asking you to ring half way
around the world, what i am offer is this...
{p} {p}
Collecting AMIGANET via your Email account.
{p} {p}
All you need to be able to achieve this is an Email client (YAMv2p6
recommended) and a way to export your AMIGANET packets into your AMIGANET
reader/writer (Foxgate recommended), obviously the same works in reverse.
{p} {p}
Programs you'll need.
{p} {p}
YAMv2P6 ({link http://www.yam.ch}http://www.yam.ch{end})  The Email Client.{p}
Foxgate (aminet:comm/misc)   The importer/exporter{p}
Spot    (aminet:comm/fido)   The AMIGANET tosser/reader/writer.

Thank you for reading this, I hope you take this open invitation to join the
50,000+ nodes and approxiamately 100,000+ points worldwide already enjoying
AMIGANET.
