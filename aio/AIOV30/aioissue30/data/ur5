NewFraktal is as it sounds, a program that draws fractals... The thing that differs
this from the rest is that you can choose what part of the fractal you want drawn.
{p} {p}
There is no installation needed, just copy the directory to wherever you like it!
{p} {p}
After you have started it you will see a small window where you will be able to
select some stuff of the fractal, like, the window size and depth, what x/y coords
from the fractal it should take etc... Then just press plot and you will see that
perticular fractal, it can draw both Mandelbrots and Juliabrots (never heard of the
later but..)
{p} {p}
After the fractal is drawn, you can cycle the colours in two "directions" so it
can look kinda cool! You can also save them as ILMB pictures and as *.frk (they
will then be saved as text and you can then load them into NewFraktal later on!)

There is no documentation at all with NewFraktal, but that doesn't do so much,
would be nice to have a doc that told the user a little about what a fractal is,
but...

One nice thing is that it is localized and it comes with a german catalog.
