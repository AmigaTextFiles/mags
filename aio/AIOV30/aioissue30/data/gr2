Yes. You read correct, the title of this little game is Turtleminator,
I guess the reason for this is your main player is a turtle and you
kill alot of things, as in Terminator style. That is how I think the
author came up with the cheesy title.
{p} {p}
Enough of that, i'm sure you want to know about the game and not the
title. Well the game is described as a "Cannon Fodder style game" and
this is 100% true. Think of Cannon Fodder with turtles and different
enemies, you imagine that and you have Turtleminator.

The game is viewed from the same angle, has very similar mouse driven
controls and the plot is different in every level. You can shoot with
your right mouse button, release bombs with both and move around by
clicking the left mouse button, al la Cannon Fodder.

The game for a PD game is really good. You can obviously tell the
difference from this and the commercial game of Cannon Fodder but even
the graphics on this our brilliant and as you will see they must have
taken along time with alot of care.
{p} {p}
There isn't alot to say about the game because if you know what Cannon
Fodder is then you'll know this game. The graphics and music are
excellent and its one of the best PD games in a long time. I see all too
often poor or rushed software which could be improved with that little
extra piece of time and the author of Turtleminator has obviously put in
the effort to bring you this masterpiece.

Overall if you liked Cannon Fodder you'll love this. It is not of
commercial quality but comes very close to some commercial products.
