VisualGuide is a program that makes filelists in AmigaGuide format.
{p} {p}
The installation is as simple as it should be in every app, just copy it somewhere!

VisualGuide is very easy to use, start it, and you'll see a MUI interface... There
you must choose the Source directory and the output guide file... You can also
specify a few different options... Then press 'Make Guide' and it will make the
Guide... It's very fast!
{p} {p}
So, why would you need this little program then? Well, it's very good if you
wanna make a list of your MP3's for example, to give to a friend... (And yes,
you can give the Guide to a Windows user also, just use the program WinGuide.lha
from Aminet!)

It has a small documentation (text file) that *very* briefly describes the
different options, not so nice, but it does it's job. (It's written in both
english and russian)
