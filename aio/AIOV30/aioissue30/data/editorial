Welcome, welcome to the last issue before our Christmas issue. I'm sure
people are already getting into the Christmas mood but we are not doing
a thing until the release of the next issue. The release date for the
Christmas Issue will be 25th December 1999. Yes, you read correct, for
all your merry-ment and cheer we will release issue 31 on Christmas
Day.

Enough about next issue as i'm sure you'll be more interested in this
issue. As always we've packed some excellent things into this issue and
you can read them just as soon as you've finished here, don't worry
I am not keeping you long this issue just a few points to make...
{p} {p}
One of the first new things you will notice is... listen... are you
listening? what can you hear.... nothing thats what! From this issue
onwards there will be no music. If there is a big demand to bring
back the music then it will be reconsidered but please take into
account these reasons for removing the music. Firstly it will bring
down the overall size of the AIO archive. Each tune normally takes
around 250k and these do not compress very well so around 200k adds
straight to the archive size meaning that it takes YOU longer to
download. The other small reason is that we all have very different
tastes in music and if you really want music then turn up your stereo
and choose a song that you prefer.

As the music button has been removed you will see another new button
sitting in its place. On it it should read 'Save Text'. This means that
if you like an article or a piece of text you see and you want to keep
it in a plain text for printing or later use without the AIO Gui tags
then click on that button and the text currently displayed will be saved
with a name and location of your choice. Simple!

I'd quickly like the thank everyone who returned the recent AIO Survey
and we should beable to bring you the results for next issue. I would
also like to say that we should have two exciting interviews next issue
aswell as a BUMPER christmas prize that is NOT to be missed.
{p} {p}
Lastly i'd like to say that the OS 3.5 review is worth a read as Mark
Tierno has done possibily one of the biggest reviews of OS 3.5 around
with the most detail. If your looking for an honest opinion with lots
of detail then you'll find the review in our articles section.
