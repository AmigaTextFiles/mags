Ever notice in the movies (well, American movies at least), anytime
they need the charsacters to use a phone number it always begins with
"555"?  well, that's because that's the only prefix that the phone
companies don't have any real phone numbers for, so it's safe to put
those oin the movies.  Well, here's a site that lists all those "555"
numbers EVER given on television and film.  So, if you have a little
extra time...

Just to prove there's a fan club for anything, here's a sight devoted
to the history of the lowly stapler, complete with pictures (some sent
in by FANS, no less) of all manner of strange, old, and new staplers.

{italic}http://www.georgehart.com{noitalic}{p}
Here's a man that takes geometry to fun new heights. Hit his
Gallery link and see all the polyhedrons he's carved, fashioned, and
made with his hands, from the simple twenty sides multicolored forms,
to something with 72 pencils, and another spikey copper thing, or
perhaps the geometric sphere made with floppy disks.  Anyway you look
ayt it, there's some fun things to look at here.

{bold}Anime Online{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.anime-online.com/{noitalic}{p}
Another something for the died in the wooll anime fan, this is really a 
family of sites devoted to all those japanese animated features that 
people who know better love to a fault.  Dragonball Z, Mermaid Saga, 
Please Save My Earth, Sailor V, Shitajiki, and more are to be found 
here.

What's in here?  The expected; galleries, animation cells, story 
summaries, everything but sound clips it eseems.  There's also a 
FanFiction section, where you can read (and possibly submit) anime-style 
fiction from other fans just like yourself.  Toss in a stray mailing 
list, some relatd links, and of course the expcted buy/sell/trade, and 
you've pretty much got it.  Not bad for this sort of thing.

This site will have variety enough for som fans, not enough for others.
It could use some audio clips, but that aside it's not too bad.  Enough
there to keep one busy for a while.
