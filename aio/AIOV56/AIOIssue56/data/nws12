{left}
{pp}
Finally the Amiga version of the new PageStream 4.1 is available. The
highlights of this version are: tables, built in mail merge, PDF
export control over compression and encoding, custom column widths
and gutters inside text frames, move pages between chapters,
duplicate/transform objects across pages, speed improvements and of
course much more.
{pp}
Price for the update from 4.0 to 4.1 is 65 Euro. For an additional 75
Euro you can purchase a sidegrade to another OS (Mac or Windows). You
can also sidegrade directly from the Amiga version to a Mac or
Windows version for just 65 Euro (from PageStream 4.x) or 145 Euro
(from PageStream 3.x). All prices incl. TAX.
