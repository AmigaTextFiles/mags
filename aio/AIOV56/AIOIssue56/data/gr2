{bold}ANOTHER CARD GAME?!{nobold}

One of the things I like to do when my computer is busy printing documents or downloading large files is to play a good solitaire.
On the computer of course!
Window users are very familiar with a card game (a klondike clone) which comes as  part of their operative system.
Fortunately, there are many variants available for our beloved Workbench. You just need to browse the game directory in Aminet to find what you think it is suitable to your taste.

Usually, I like games that do not take over the operative system; puzzles and solitaire that can be run on the workbench screen leaving me with the freedom of moving between screens and tasks
Unfortunately Patience is not one of those but there was one feature that stimulated my curiosity: there were no less than 19 different types of solitaire in the archive, and some of those were variants invented by the author and therefore completely new to the public.
Armed with my copy of IBrowse I downloaded the game to see what was on offer.
So, is patience another card game?
No really. It is a compilation of solitaire, mostly variants of the common ones, with the added bonus of three new games developed by David Smith (the developer).

Installing the game is just a matter of dragging the drawer to any partition or directory on your hard drive.
The game works happily with a 68020 or a dual processor card.
That does not mean it benefits from the power of a PPC card, but that it merely runs fine with the combination of 040/060/PPC processors.
Unfortunately the game does not support graphics card and necessitate of monitors that can display the 15khz frequency (i.e. 1084).
So, if you stored one of those monitors in the loft it is time to dust it out and connect it to your computer.

The game si pretty small. Just double click on its icon and you will be taken  straight into the splendor of... 16 colours on the screen.
Indeed, do not expect to see spectacular effects or 3D Graphics, this is simply a card game with very basic graphics which can just about do the job it is supposed to do.
{pp}
There are 19 games to choose from, and some are just a variant of the old (and much loved) Klondike.
Once selected the game of your choice you will have five different options available at the bottom of the game screen.
Select any of them to view the rules of each game or to see a computerised demonstration on how to play.
During the gameplay, if you find yourself stuck you can ask the computer for a move suggestion.
Great idea, but do not expect miracles. In fact the A.I. is pretty basic and not able to remember the cards that were previously used to come out with a winning move (that would be cheating anyway).

One of the most annoying thing about Patience is the automatic card move.
For instance, in one game there was a main card deck and my job was to just click on it to reveal the cards, The computer would then pile them up following the game rules, and making the gameplay very boring.
Also, the complete lack of sound effects make the experience even worse.
While I praise the idea of not having one of those boring protracker music playing in background , I would have liked the presence of some basic sound effects to accompany the game.
Also, the fact that the game takes over the operative system is something I do not like, especially taking in consideration the fact that the majority of computer users, usually, play solitaire games when the computer is busy doing other tasks.
Yes, there are 19 different types of solitaire here, but that does not convince me in giving up my old WB Klondike clone. Indeed once you have played all the games available you will look some where else for something more rewarding.
