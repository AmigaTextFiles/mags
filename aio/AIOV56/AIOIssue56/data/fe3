There are several online games around, web sites with all sorts of
java script based games, most of which won't work properly on the
Amiga browsers.  Planetarion is workabale on AWeb but they now charge a
fee..

But there comes a time when you may want to get back into some old
glassics.  My favorite is Tradewars but the jaza version on Goosemoose
satill won't work on Voyager or AWeb.  Well, fear not for there's
always telnet.  The days of the BBS are dead and gone but at least one
telnet-aware person appears to have forgotten that.  With both Lord
and Tradewars available, there's a BBS you can get to via telnet to
relive those old (and still good) BBS games. 
{bold}bbs.askee.net{nobold} is just the one I know of for these two
games, but I'm sure a web-search will turn up others.

Just call it a reason to use that rusty old telnet program.
