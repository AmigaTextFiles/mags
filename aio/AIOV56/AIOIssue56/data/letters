Hi. If i think amiga is draggin a bit to slow ?
{pp}
Both yes and no but i can wait. I believe more in amiga now even if i don't see anything
but when Hyperion decided to continue on OS4 i'm really happy. They do great stuff
on amiga. And better having a system that is more complete and tested then just an quick
made version with bugs etc.

As i have waited for my 2 ppc cards from DCE in 7 months now and i don't think i will get it
att all before a G4 card comes out i can wait for OS4 and SharkPPC. I have Mediator 4000 pci
and will get a voodoo 5 card today. No i just need OS4 and a PPC card. Really big disregards
to DCE and with their way to not reply to letters.
