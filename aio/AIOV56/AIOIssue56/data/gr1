{bold}UNBELIEVABLE, QUAKE 2 IS COMING TO THE AMIGA NEAR YOU!{nobold}
{pp}
It was long time ago when Clickboom announced that they were working on a port of the acclaimed Quake for Amiga.
Since then Quake has been considered one of the best game ever ported for Amiga and our readers will be very happy to know that Quake 2 should also be available by the time you read this article.
It is only a couple of months since ID (the developers of Quake 2) has freely released the source code of the game and without wasting any precious time, Hyperion has got hold of it to release another of their fantastic conversions.
In spite of Hyperion working on this port during their spare time it looks like Amiga gamers will get a chance to play this game very soon.
In the previous issue, in my exclusive interview, Steffen Haueser has given away some of the features of Quake 2.
This time, I have managed to prepare a preview which will definitely stimulate your gamer glances and get you ready for another great adventure in the ID world.

For the people that are not familiar with Quake 2 it is important to clarify that this game delivers not just graphically but on all the levels that make a game an outstanding game.
Indeed, with Quake 2 ID has managed to create an actual storyline for a 3D shooter and integrate it fully in the game.
The game should include richly detailed and explicit full motion video sequence that will help to create the plot and make the experience even more real.

As you know the level design is a critical part of any 3D game and it looks like Quake 2 has improved to the point that every level looks absolutely perfect.
The colour are much brighter and the texture seems more real.
While Quake 3 lost its appeal as single player game Quake 2 can still deliver a fantastic one player game.
If you are into multiplayer game don`t lose your hope though. Quake 2 will have a multiplayer option with the choice to play online with other players.
How well will the Amiga version work is something I will see once I get hold of the final code.

The Amiga version makes use of a GUI interface to launch the game (similar to other Hyperion ports) which will also allow the gamer to modify all the game settings.
Quake 2 for Amiga supports the MiniGL/Warp3D Renderer in 16 Bit in fullscreen mode and the possibility to play in a Workbench window.
There is an option to make use of the Software Renderer engine which will also work on a full screen mode and Workbench window.
The game supports a full range of controllers from the combination of keyboard and mouse (including Mousewheel) to the  CD 32 Pad, PSX joypad and PC Analog Joystick
Like in Freespace the game makes use of AHI (for possessors of sound  card and Paula-Native chipset.

In terms of speed the game looks much faster than Heretic 2 but slower than the warpos version of Quake 1 (reviewed in a previous issue of AIO).
The software renderer - due to the fact that it is 8 Bit only - looks faster than the Software Renderer of Heretic II. Good news for non possessor of GFX cards.
The game requires either a PowerPC (no matter what is the clock frequency) or
a PC with at least 1 GHz and AmigaXL
Unfortunately due to a bug in the emulation the add on Mods will not not run on AmigaXL.
Also, for the same reason Quake 2 will not work on Amithlon.
I believe Hyperion has informed the author and surely a new version of the Amiga emulator should be available soon.
Although the game works with Amiga emulators Hyperion will ONLY supports  the PowerPC version.

Quake 1 made use of QuakeC, a programming language which helped developers to create add ons for the original game.
Unfortunately Quake 2 works in a different way and extra modules have to be ported to Amiga one by one.
Hyperion has already converted over 50 Mods including The Weapons Factory, Battle of the Sexes, ActionQuake, Devastation Quake, etc.
Expect more to come.
{pp}
There is no doubt in my mind that Hyperion will deliver another great products for the Amiga community.
Hyperion is planning a bundle which will include the Amiga port of Quake 2, the window version and over 50 modules.
I just can`t wait to get hold of the final version of what was once considered a fantastic game for PC owners.

Rather then scale down the screen shots we've obtained to something to
fit our GUI, you can view all of them in their original jpeg form in this
issue's directory  "AIOIssue56:Quake_Pics/"
