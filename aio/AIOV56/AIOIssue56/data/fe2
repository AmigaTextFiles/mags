Keyboard skins are always a good idea as they protct your keyboard's
inner workings from that Jolt Cola your presently dripping over it. 
But these things get old, the gum peeling it up from it's mourings as
well as looking increasingly discolored and thus making it harder to
see the keys properly, not to mention making it harder to actually
TYPE the kys when it gets REALLY bad.  Solution?  Relace that old skin
when it starts to get a bit too worn.

When getting the latest OS upgrade, make sure to disable ALL of your
comodities and hacks.  When the upgrade is fully installed, then look through
it's new fatures and improvements to make sure which commodities you
won't be needing naymore.  Especially check those multi-commodities
like MCP that hav about 50 fatures hiddn away in that 75K program. 
When you're sure what you won't be neding anymore then activate the
remain ing ones one at a time to check for conflicts-  this
{bold}especially{nobold} goes for hacks, libraries, and devices.

Of increasing popularity are those hacks or commodities that allow you
to have the icon not shown for any device that comes up invalid.  I
suggest turning OFF that option for any of your harddrive partitions
bcause if you have a bad partition you'll certainly want to know and
be needing that icon to work with to fix things.  For floppies and zip
disks, start tracking down MultiFileSystem and you'll have a lot fewer
icons if you use two or more filesystems.
