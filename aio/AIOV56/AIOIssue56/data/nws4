{subhead}Amiga OS 4.0 development update{def}
{left}
{pp}
Leuven, Belgium, January 21, 2002.
{pp}
Let me start off by wishing everybody in the Amiga community all the
best in  2002! 
{pp}
As you know, on November 1, 2001 Hyperion Entertainment entered into
a license  agreement with Amiga Inc. to produce Amiga OS 4.0 for PPC
based systems.  Since my presentation in Cologne at the Amiga 2001
show on November 17-18, very  substantial progress was made which I
am now ready to share with you.  Some of you have expressed some
misgivings about the lack of progress reports on  OS 4.0 development
but I hope I can count on your understanding as all of us  have been
extremely busy, even through the holiday season, to bring you what is
 unquestionably the most ambitious OS upgrade since Amiga OS 3.0.
{pp}
Now I know that many of you are sceptical because of the scope of the
project  and because similar promises were made in the past.  To
those people I would like to point out that Hyperion Entertainment
does not  enter into contracts lightly and that we have a
track-record carrying out  commercial development and contract-work
for Windows, Mac, Linux, Amiga and  Amiga DE/Elate.
{pp}
We have brought together a truly impressive development team of some
25 people  building on the OS 3.5 and 3.9 development team whilst
adding several well-known  and respected Amiga developers to the mix.
{pp}
Im very pleased to say that Dave Haynie has agreed to serve as a
technical  consultant.
{pp}
You'll be hard-pressed to find a more experienced team for the job!
The feature-set of OS 4.0 has now been finalised to a large extent.
We can't guarantee that every single feature listed here will make it
in the  initial release of OS 4.0 but this the feature-set that we
have contractually  committed to delivering.
{pp}
You will also note that for the first time in many, many years very
substantial  work is being done on Intuition, one of the core
elements of the Amiga OS.  Having a PPC native version of Intuition
available will make a very noticeable  difference speed-wise.
{pp}
We intend for OS 4.0 to be disk-based or at least partly disk-based
and partly  flashrom based even for current Amigas. More about that
in a later update.  We also intend for OS 4.0 to be installed
effortlessly from CD and from scratch  without the need for an
existing OS install.
{pp}
As we have taken on more work (Intuition etc.) and folded some of the
 functionality originally planned for OS 4.2 into OS 4.0, this
inevitably means  the original February release-date might slip
somewhat but all in all we believe  that the end-result will be
technologically more satisfying.
{pp}
Come end of January, I hope to have the biggest chunk of the legal
work for OS  4.0 behind me which will allow me to provide you with
more regular updates.  I know full well that your patience has been
sorely tested over the last years  so I understand your impatience
and even your scepticism but I can assure you  that the Amiga OS is
in good hands and that we will deliver. 
{pp}
In closing, I would like to invite everybody out there who (out of an
 understandable frustration with the neglect of the Amiga OS by its
respective  past owners) decided to take matters in his own hands, to
work with us, rather  than against us.

{pp}
Exec Second Generation (Exec SG)
{pp}
Exec is the kernel of the AmigaOS and is currently written in 68K assembly.
Exec is being re-written in C and new functionality will be introduced to allow
the deployment of OS 4.x on any suitable PPC hardware.{p}
The following features are planned:
{pp}
  Hardware abstraction layer{p}
  Virtual memory{p}
  New library interface{p}
  Resource tracking and management{p}
  Optional memory protection{p}
  WarpOS backwards compatibility{p}
  68K Just in Time emulation{p}
  PPC native TCP/IP stack
{pp}
  - implemented as a single shared library{p}
  - compatible with the Amiga standard "bsdsocket" API, as defined by the AmiTCP
  product{p}
  - enhanced API for more control over the inner workings and configuration{p}
  - built-in DHCP client (e.g. for cable modems){p}
  - Internet Superserver (inetd){p}
  - IP filtering and networking address translation{p}
  - drivers for asynchronous PPP (dial-up networking) and PPP over Ethernet (for
  ADSL and cable modems){p}
  - AmiSSL V2.0
{pp}
{pp}
PPC native filesystem (FFS2)
{pp}
FFS2 is a fully backwards compatible re-implementation in C of the
Fast File System. It supports media > 4 GByte, and a new variant of
the file/directory name storage format which allows for long file
names (up to 108 characters).  Recovery and Salvage tools
Comprehensive suite of salvage and recovery tools including Salvage,
Undelete,  Unformat, Repair, RDBSalv, ReOrg/Defrag, Check Integrity
etc.
{pp}
{pp}
PPC native RTG system
{pp}
The PPC native RTG system (based on Picasso 96 V3) allows for the use of modern
graphics cards on the Amiga.
{pp}
Drivers for all current Zorro II/III cards as well as drivers for the Permedia
2/3, Voodoo 3, Matrox G450/G550 and ATI Radeon are planned.
An arithmetically optimised PPC native version of layers.library is also
planned.
{pp}
{pp}
Warp3D
{pp}
New version of Warp3D, the powerful yet low-level 3D API which is both available
on the classic Amiga and intent/Amiga DE and which allows developers to rapidly
migrate 3D content between both platforms.
Drivers for Permedia 2/3, Voodoo 3, Matrox G450/G550 and ATI Radeon are planned.
{pp}
{pp}
OpenGL 1.3 support (Mesa 4.0)
{pp}
OpenGL is a cross-platform (Mac, Linux, Windows, AmigaDE etc.) high-level 3D API
originally developed by Silicon Graphics.{p}
Support for OpenGL 1.3 will be provided by porting the open source project Mesa
(which now passes all SGI compliance tests) which will sit on top of Warp3D so
that graphics-card functionality not currently offered by the OpenGL API may be
supported nonetheless.
{pp}
{pp}
PPC native RTA system (AHI)
{pp}
A Retargetable Audio System allows the use of plug-in soundcards (PCI or Zorro
II).{p}
AHI by Martin Blom is currently the de facto standard on the Amiga and a PPC
native version will be offered with support for a wide variety of soundcards
including but not limited to all current Amiga soundcards and the Soundblaster
128 and Live (EMU10K1) cards.
{pp}
{pp}
PPC native Intuition and Reaction
{pp}
Reaction is the BOOPSI based GUI system for the Amiga, introduced in OS 3.5 and
