Greetings to the Global Amiga family,
{pp}
Yes, I know that it has been more than a week, and yes the deal is still on, and
yes we are moving very quickly as I will outline to you all below
I want to personally thank our friends and families for sticking with us and
with our dreams as they are coming to reality.
{pp}
As Amiga has matured over the last two years, and our plans only slightly
changed I would like to say thank you to each and every one of you for your
patience and excitement as we move forward.
{pp}
In 1999 Amiga, Inc. decided to take a very different road than the ones
previously charted for the community. It was met, by some, with disbelief, most
with excitement as a path was being laid towards a future where digital content
would be accessed by any digital device. Amiga selected an unknown partner in
the Tao-Group of Reading England, and I can assure you that this was the best
decision we have made.
{pp}
Tao and Amiga have never been closer as a true partnership is in place. I want
to thank Francis Charig my dear friend, and the rest of the Tao team as they
been instrumental to the successes that will become public knowledge soon.
However with all of the great plans that were in place and the product
development that had started there was still the issue of having funds necessary
to make it all happen, and the addition of Frank Wilde as our Chairman has been
amazing help, and I can say we are moving forward in ways that are going to
bring Amiga to new levels, and I could not be more happy with the results that
we are seeing.
{pp}
Thank you to everyone of you who are keeping the faith and spreading the truth
about Amiga.
{pp}
I have several announcements that are happening here, and you need to know that
we are definitely going to have more Amiga enabled products ship in 2002 than in
any year previous.
{pp}
Our STB partner - Nokia, and their new Media Terminal. Yes, the same Nokia
that you all know and love. Amiga will be pre-loaded on these products and
we will begin shipping on them before summer this year. Now the Nokia
announcement will be coming on their site in the coming weeks, but we are
going ahead and putting our release up, and then we will follow on with
another joint announcement.
{pp}
I often get messages asking when we are going to let the rest of the world
know what is happening. Well for all of you who have asked - Amiga will be
at the Embedded Systems Show in San Francisco, CA, March 12 through the
15th. We will be in booth #1602, located in the South Hall of Moscone
Center. We will be showing the new Amiga technology, and some exciting new
features never before seen in any other product. We will also be making at
least one announcement there at the show.
{pp}
We have two more new members added to the team and there are many more
that will be announced soon. The first two are part of our sales team.
Both are dynamic and excited to be part of the Amiga family. Liz Barnick
and David Brott joined us in January, and are establishing themselves
quickly with regards to new business, and great ideas. I have included
information about them both in a separate document that is attached to
this update.
{pp}
AmigaOS 4.0 is moving ahead very nicely and I could not be more pleased
with Hyperion and their ability to get things done. We will all be very
proud of their efforts, and I know that many of you will be rewarded with
what they have already accomplished, and with the product that they are
building.
{pp}
I can assure you that your patience will be met with great rewards, and there
are many others who are now learning what you have known. That Amiga has the
most robust, talented, dedicated community of any computing platform today or in
the future.
{pp}
Thank you again for your continued prayers and support. You are about to be
rewarded.
{pp}
With my best to everyone,{p}
Bill McEwen and the rest of the Amiga Team
