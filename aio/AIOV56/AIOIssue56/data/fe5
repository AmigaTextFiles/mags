{subhead}Web Style Guide{def}{p}

Too many times I find a web page that varies from bad looking to just
plain unreadable.  At first I think it's one of my quasi-functioning
Ami browsers, but then a friend views it on a PC or I switch browsers
and what do you inow, it's STILL bad.  Some people just sem to have no
sense of style or functionality.
{pp}
With that in mind, in the spirit of the old Amiga Style Guide, I have
my own style guide for web pages.  Basic common sense guidelines for
better looking and better performning web pages no matter which
platform you're viwing from.  Read it, use it, pass it around, and
just maybe the web will be a better looking place.

·{bold}Javascript vs HTML{nobold}{p}
Java script (Java for short) can be a useful thing but also the bane of the web.  Many
a page I've seen relies far too much on Java; using a Jva command to
open up a new browser window where the sam could be done with HTML, or
using Java to create a link to a new page where again HTML does it
too.  The problem here is that Javascript is unstable on
{italic}any{noitalic} platform, takes additional time to get those
little applets, and additional time to run.  Why use a Java command to
make a link when it's built into HTML?  HTML is stable and truly
universal, yet I'v seen entire pages that are nothing but Javascript;
these pages ar buggy and use more CPU time.  So to sum it up, where
you have a chois between Javca script and HTML doing the
{bold}same{nobold} thing, then use HTML.  Stop abusing Java Script.

·{bold}Too Much Flash{nobold}
Flash is also another thing that I've seen far too over-usd. I've
aited several minutes for a Flash anim to download only to see it
something no better then a three-cycle Gif Anim.  If you can do the
same thing with a Gif Anim or some other simpler (and hence less
straining on the moden speed) form, then by all means use it.  Save the
Flash for those things that REALLY need it.  Not everybody can afford
a cable modem.

·{bold}Readability{nobold}
ever seen a page that specifies some neat looking background color but
neglects to specifcyt the text color?  I have.  The background was
black and the text was left to myt own brpowser settings, which
naturally is black for text; I couldn't read it without either
highlighting with the cursor or changing my default text color to some
dark shade oif grey.  If you want to have a spefic background color or
pattern then you MUST also specify a text color as well.  And don't
always leave it to style tags that some browsers may have trouble
supporting; at the top of each page put in a default background and
text color, as well as any others you may need such as link color
etc..{p}
In this same vein, if you must have some fancy looking background
picture then by allmeans make sure the color chosen for many text over
it is readablre and has good contrast.  Yellow on White? 
{italic}bad{noitalic} idea.  Yellow on black?  A lot btter.  Too
confusing a pattern underneath long blocks of text can mak the text
unredable.  I get the feeling that some people don't view their own
web pages before uploading them so by all means preview your pages,
hgve your friends preview it on {italic}their{noitalic} own computers,
and remmber that not all browsers or monitors are built the same.

·{bold}Organized Layout{nobold}
If someone has to go hunting too long throughout your whiz bang front
page with a dozen animating figures and moire pattern backgrounds just
to find the link they're looking for then they're just going to move
on to somewhere else.  You can still have your links wrapped in in
good graphical design or picture maps, just make sure that all the
links- especially those of main interest- are easy to see.  Unless you
{italic}like{noitalic} having a puzzlebox for a web site.
{pp}
·{bold}Pictures{nobold}
For GIFs, compress those pallets or your GIFs might look a bit messed
up on some browsers.  JPEGs ar great, but for cases in which you have
256 colors or less then GIF format actually makes for smallr file
size, and small file sizes equals quicker downloads and hence more
hits.
{pp}
· {bold}Simpler Defaults{nobold}
For any case in which you have something like Frames or Flash, in
cases where it's possible on a practical enough basis, it is nice to
have an alternate to the page for people that want to bypass all the
fancy and/or slow download versions.  For Frames have a non-Frame
page; for Flash, have a page that skips the Flash or uses normal
menus.
{pp}
{pp}
These are all general points that amount to a versions of Axom's
Razor: where possible keep it simnple.  No need to use something that
takes up thre times the file size, twice the download time, and ore
CPU time then a simpler more stable option.  Unreadable pages are
unvisited pages.  And finally, don't assume that everyone has the same
collection of plugins and fonts as you do on your system.  Always have
good defaults for all aspects of your web page.
{pp}
If I've missed anything then please feel free to write in.  Just keep
some common sense in mind, preview your pages with a neutral eye, and
people will come to your site a bit more often...{p}
Then maybe even the good Doctor might review it some day.
