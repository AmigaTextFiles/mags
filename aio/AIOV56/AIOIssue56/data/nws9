You are Feeble or rather you´re a down trodden Grenelon who just
happens to be called Feeble... Rendered animation, stereo sound and a
plot of epic proportions take this adventure into a different galaxy.
Witty and humerous but with dark undertones. THE FEEBLE FILES
contains acts of betrayal, intrigue, revolution and even a bit of
cross dressing. Add to that around 80 locations to visit, six
thousand voice lines to interact with, there should be plenty to keep
everyone happy without the aid of chemical supplements.

THE FEEBLE FILES for the Amiga comes on 2 CDs and contains both full
english and german speech versions. The Amiga version requires either
an Amiga with 68060, 4 MByte Gfxboard and 32 MByte RAM or an Amiga
with PPC, 4 MByte Gfxboard and 32 MByte RAM.
