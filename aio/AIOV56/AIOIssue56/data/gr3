{bold}A BOND GAME ON AMIGA? YOU MUST BE JOKING!{nobold}
{pp}
Raise your hand any of you who does not enjoy a good movie with James Bond.
Great, you can put your hands down now!
I personally am a great fan of agent 007and I have recently enjoyed playing Agent Under Fire, the new Bond game on Playstation 2.
So, if you, like me love the adventures of the British MI5 agent then you might want to have a look at this game developed by Andrew Crowe.
Do not expect a 3D adventure though. This is a game that was developed some time ago and reviewed by Amiga Format for the Reader Games section.
Unfortunately, it was never put on the magazine CD due to copyright reasons.
Recently I found a copy in my archive and decided to have a go at it.

{bold}THE PLOT{nobold}
{pp}
An American space ship has been capured by an unknown craft and Russia was blamed for that. The risk is a world war but the British intelligence service (what a surprise?!) managed to track down the space ship in the Japanise land and sent the
best MI5 agent there to investigate.
His name?
Bond, James Bond.
Suddenly, gunmen burst in his life and shoot him.
He seems dead.
The body is put to rest at sea, but a group of men in scuba gear take his body on a sub where he is revived.
James indeed was not dead. He faked his death, by using a powerful drug, to get rid of his enemies.

Now, before you raise your hopes you must know that the story is just a lame excuse to justify the existance of this game. Indeed, the game has nothing to do with the movie and, apart some digitized pictures and samples what you will get is a basic muliplayer shoot'em up with a top down view (Alien Breed style).

{bold}THE GAME{nobold}
{pp}
If you have seen the movie You Only Live Twice (YOLT) you will be familiar with the game characters.
As soon as you load the game you will be welcomed, by the notes of the movie score, into the Bond world.
The quality of the music and speech is not great, but surely is enjoyable and makes the experience more pleasant.
On the main screen you can adapt the settings to your gamer needs.
The screen is split into four parts and therefore up to four players can join in and play together.
As a matter of fact YOLT is not a single player game. It is a multiplayer experience where a minimum of two players are needed if you want to play.
A keyboard can be used to control the game characters. If not, you can still share a CD32 joypad where the left side can be used by one player and the right side by the other one.
If you are a lucky possesor of a Four Player Serial Adaptor (they were very common some time ago) you can connect up to four joysticks to your Amiga.
{pp}
There are six characters available plus a secret one to choose from and your name name can be assigned to any of them.
The choice includes James Bond, Mr. osato, Number 11, and many more.
Every time you choose one a digitised speech sample will be played with the voice of the chosen character, just to put you in the right mood.
If you think you are too good to compete with your friends you can modify the handicap level for your character by reducing the energy bar to a quarter or half.
There is also a switch to set up the violence level (meaty/messy) for the delicate of stomach.
Finally, choose your prefered game mode between Standard Detmatch, Team Deathmath and You Only Live Twice Detmatch and get ready to begin this new adventure.
The idea is to replicate the deatmatch style found in Quake or Unreal Tournament without the 3D graphics.
In the YOLT detmatch you will play the game with only two lifes. Once you lose them you are out.
The Standard and Team Deatchmatch will give you infinite lifes. You can play untill you get tired, then it is a matter of pressing the ESC key to let the computer calculate the final score.
The screen is split into four parts (no matter how many players are playing) and the purpose of the game is to find a kill the other players while remaining alive.
On the top corners (or bottom corners) of the screen sits the player statistics (AMMO left and HEALTH level).
Weapons and power ups are also available for you to collect.
You can have lot of fun once you find the bazooka. It will let you kill other players with just one single shot.
The winner is the player who has been accredited the highest number of deaths.
There are seven levels available which include enviroments like the Tokyo streets, temples and buildings, just to mention a few. They are very small and it will not take very long for you to become familiar with their layout.
{pp}
The game requires a minimum of an Amiga with 1.5 MB of chip ram and 4 to 8 MB of fast ram.
There is no support for GFX cards and a monitor which supports a 15Khz frequency is needed for the job.
The game works perfectly fine with the basic A1200 processor but a 68030 is preferred if you do not want to experience slowdowns.
No problems for the lucky possessors of dual processor accelerator cards.

{bold}IS IT GOOD?{nobold}
{pp}
The game was developed using AMOS PRO and  painting packages like DPAINTV and IMAGEFX.
Although the game can be fun, I cannot fully credit the author for it.
The digitised graphics, music and speech, which can surely add a pinch of realism to the experience, were taken (I believe without permission) from the original movie while the sound effects were ripped from the game DOOM 2.
The in game graphics are nothing spectacular and there seem to be not enough colours on the screen.
It is fun to see that on the highest violence level people killed leave a trace of blood on the background, 
but unfortunately on some levels the colour combination seems inappropriate making the gameplay tiring and unconfortable for our poor eyes, especially after long sessions.
A four player split screen also seem inappropriate on a low resolution screen making things very difficult to see.
{pp}
The characters move very slowly but thank God there is a cheat available to speed up the movements.
Actually there are over 20 cheats available which you can collect by playing the game over a lenght of time.
Every now and then the computer will give a password away which can be used in the cheat option screen to activate new features. Surely, a strategy that the author has implemented to increase the lastability of the game.
In fact, the game can become quite repetitive and the fun will, eventually, fade away once you get tired of kicking you mates around.
{pp}
There is an update available for this game which will allow you to load different character sets (i.e. Austin Power set) or to design your own graphics using the famous  Deluxe Paint.
The sounds effects (borrowed by Doom 2) are pretty good and can contribute to the enjoymebnt of the game.
The lack of single player mode is a downpoint and it would have been nice to have a basic A.I. controlling the computer characters.
Also, why split the screen into four parts even if there are only two players playing?
And how about an internet option to play online with other people?
Maybe a future version could include all of those but I am not sure the developer is still involved with Amiga.

{bold}COPYRIGHT{nobold}
{pp}
The main problem of this game is that it makes use of graphics and sounds which are protected by the copyright law and, as far as I know, the author has never obtained permission to use them.
If that is something that bother you than maybe you should avoid playing this game.
If not, then check it out at the author home page.
It is not the greatest game in the world, but can be rewarding if played with a couple of mates after a few pints.
