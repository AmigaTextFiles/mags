I'm gettimg impatient.

Yes, I know Amiga is running behind due to a number of very good
reasons, but more and more I have friends asking me when the new
Amigas are going to be out so they can go and get one- and these are
PC and MAC users!  There's a market out there wanting to see
{italic}something,{noitalic} but they won't wait forever.  Now's the
time, so would Amiga {italic}please{noitalic} give us something with
some hardware attached to it (on bended knee).

On another subject, next month's issue will be on (cue the echo
chamber)... CD!  Yes you heard me right.  Details can be found in the
Articles section, but basically next issue will only be available on
CD along with everything AIO's ever done and hopefully a few extras.

One last thing, in Letters is our first Hot Topics response as well as
the next Hot Topics topic.

Enjoy the issue.
