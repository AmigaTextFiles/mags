A program to keep track where all your money goes. Simple, Fast and
it does the job well. Heck, it even covers the Euro, so there is no
excuse for {bold}NOT{nobold} downloading it, well except maybe the
fact that it is quite troublesome. I mean what is the point, banks do
give accountforms with your balance, don't they. And (at least) here
in the Netherlands you just go to an ATM and you will know your
balance. But with this program you can finally see where your money
got spend and how much you spend at a paticular place. I'll advice to
download it and to register it, the download from Aminet doesn't
allow to save your account, so you better register it. It's very
simple to install and very easy to use. You can see in an instance
where your money has gone. Prefably in the direction of the AmigaOne.
Hopefully we'll see an OS4.x or a DE version of this usefull program.
