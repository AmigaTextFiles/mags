{subhead} FreeCell 1.2{def}{p}

 This is easily this month's most played game. It is sooooooo adictive.
Who'd have thought a card game could be so playable?
{p} {p}
 FreeCell is based on the PeeCee equivalent. It is like the solitaire
card game.  It is unlike most solitaire games, however, in that there
is no luck involved after the initial shuffle. There are no hidden
cards; they are all dealt face up at the start of the game.
{p} {p}
 FreeCell is surpost to have an extremely high rate of 'solvability', but
it is obvious that some games are harder than others. The game keeps
tabs on the games you have won and lost. So far I have won 8 games, and
lost 62. However, I think the lost sum includes games I couldn't be
bothered to do because they looked hard (i.e No ACE as one of the first
cards!)
{p} {p}
 The FreeCell game area consists of the home cells, free cells, and the
deck of cards, which is dealt face-up at the beginning of the game. The
object of the game is to move all the cards to the home cells, using the
free cells as placeholders. To win, you must make four stacks of cards
on the home cells: one for each suit, with the ace on the bottom and each
card stacked in order of rank. Like solitaire you play red cards on black
cards and black cards on red cards.
{p} {p}
 There are four legal moves in FreeCell:
{p} {p}
 1.	You can move any card from the bottom of a column to an empty free
cell.
{p} {p}
 2.	You can move any card from a free cell or from the bottom of a column
to a home cell if that card is one greater in rank than the card
in the home cell, and of the same suit.  For example, you can move a
four of clubs on to a three of clubs in a home cell. Aces can always
be moved to an empty home cell.
{p} {p}
      NOTE: At the end of each move, FreeCell will transfer unneeded cards
to the home cells. A card is unneeded if there are no lower-rank cards
of the opposite colour left in the playing area.
{p} {p}
 3.   You can move a card from a free cell or from the bottom of another
column as long as the rank of the card is one less than the rank of
the card you will place it on, and the colours of the cards are
different. For example, you can move a black three onto a red four.
Any card can be moved to an empty column.
{p} {p}
 4. 	You can move an ordered stack of cards from one column to another
column if the rank of the top card in that stack obeys rule three,
and there are enough free cells to accomplish it.
{p} {p}
If you move the stack to an empty column, a requester will appear
asking whether you want to move a single card, column of cards, or
neither. Click on the appropriate button.
{p} {p}
 You lose if there are no more legal moves. When you lose a game, you can
try the same Game Number again without affecting the statistics. Good to
know isn't it?
{p} {p}
 FreeCell has the ability to save solutions, and games, but whenever I
try to load on it doesn't work! Although many bugs have been fixed for
v1.2 I still think there are a few faults, but this does not limit the
gameplay. You can also change the screen mode, if you want to, if you
want to.
{p} {p}
 The game is very clever. There are regular moments when you get a burst
of inspiration, but shortly after you are stuck of things to do, and in
extreme thrustaration you click on the QUIT button, and do something
else on your perfectly multi-tasking Amiga!
{p} {p}
 My tactics are to get as many aces out as I can, and then see what else
I can do, although this leaves me with no free cells, its a ruddy good
start!
{p} {p}
 So I conclude this is a ruddy good game, and I urge you to download it
immediatly, and enjoy the magic that your Amiga, and Christmas can
bring!
