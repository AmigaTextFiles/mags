First configure your TCP software to dialup the number:
{p} {p}
08450796699   (this is the normal dialin number you'll use to go online)
{p} {p}
then use the settings:
{p} {p}
Login ID: freeservesignup{p}
Password: signup
{p} {p}
{p} {p}
If your TCP stack searches out for DNS servers then disable the stack from
looking for or using and DNS servers.

Dial in then use a browser that can do secure http connections and go to:{p}
https://signup.freeserve.net{p}
and follow all the onscreen prompts to create your account.

Note: when you get your hostname blahblahblah.freeserve.co.uk, you use that
as your username when logging in to the ISP not just the blahblahblah bit.

The DNS servers you'll need if your stack doesn't automatically detect them
are:{p}
195.188.107.40{p}
195.188.107.42{p}
{p} {p}

The pop3 and smtp mailserver is:  mail.freeserve.net

And there you go.
