 As of late due to the fall of Commodore and much undue hype this rather
feeble computer format's sales have taken a sharp increase.  I have
unfortunately had the misfortune to use one of these "revolutionary computers"
and hated every moment of it.  Here are my own personal pet hates of this
satanic machine which was obviously created by somebody very annoyed with
life, considering suicide and wanting to leave the rest of the world in
eternal anguish:
{p} {p}
   1. It isn't an Amiga.{p}
   2. Even with 32Meg and a Pentuim chip it can barely multitask.{p}
   3. It can only have 8 letters in a filename.{p}
   4. You can only store 1.44Meg on a high density disk.{p}
   5. You have to buy a soundcard to have sound better than that of a{p}
       speccy.{p}
   6. Windows is utter cack.{p}
   7. DOS is worse.{p}
   8. Try getting something as good as Dopus on it.{p}
   9. There is no such thing as "free" PD.{p}
   10. Can't handle anywhere near as many colours as HAM8 without a{p}
       graphics card.{p}
   11. Don't get "Gravity Force 2" for it.{p}
   12. No accessory is ever compatible with another one.{p}
   13. I've never used it for more than 2 hours without it{p}
            crashing.  (normally less).{p}
   14. All "serious" programs usually need over 50Meg of hard disk{p}
       space.{p}
   15. Every time you turn it on more hard disk space "evaporates".{p}
   16. Try making an animation then saving it to a domestic video{p}
       player.{p}
   17. Compare "Paintbrush" to "Dpaint".{p}
   18. It's vastly overpriced for what you can do with it. (£900 for a{p}
       great plant pot holder).{p}
   19. It doesn't have a command line history.(In an Amiga shell enter{p}
       something that is obviously wrong e.g. "Format pants" and press{p}
       return.  Press Up and it will reappear, now do the same on a PC).{p}
   20. Try doing anything half usefull on a 2Meg PC, then try the same{p}
       on an stock A1200.{p}
   21. You don't get "OctaMed" for it.{p}
   22. You have to BUY screensavers. (No GBlanker, Oo No No.){p}
   23. You don't get "Fat Ally II - SE".{p}
   24. In one evening I convinced Mike Hogg to buy an Amiga, after he{p}
       spent over a year working with PCs.{p}
   25. There's no easy way to get into programming with it.(No AMOS or{p}
       BB2 or similar.){p}
   26. It even needs drivers just to run a mouse.{p}
   27. You can emulate a PC on an Amiga but can you emulate an Amiga on{p}
       a PC?{p}
   28. You can't "Drag" screens down and up.{p}
   29. Even with 8Meg it always seems to run out of memory amazingly{p}
       quickly.{p}
   30. I could never think of 30 things wrong with the Amiga.{p}
