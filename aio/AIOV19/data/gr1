Tales of the Heaven is a new Mario 3D style game to hit the Amiga,
it is not yet finished and only a small preview is available at
the moment. All I can really say is you must check this out, if
you've been a fan of 2d platform games then you will love this, finally
the Amiga gets platform games in 3D. The game is a cross between
Mario 3D on the Nintendo64 and Pandemonium on the Sony Playstation.

The graphics so far are superb and the gameplay is great. As this
is an early preview there isn't alot to do, you collect a gem,
jump around some moving platforms and then grab a key and get to
the exit. The preview is then complete, although it is 1.7mb for
this I suggest you download it and see for yourselfs to witness
a reveloution of Amiga gaming.

Overall a great little preview game that I recommend everyone gets,
you'll need an 68030 to play it but if you've got that then get
this. I can't wait for the full game!!!
