'Twas the night before Xmas and all through the house,{p}
  Not a computer was uploading, not even a mouse.{p}
The users were nesteled all snug in their belief,{p}
  That wintel was God, there was no relief.{p}
With the missus uploading, and I in on the 'net,{p}
  I soon settled down, for a long Winter's set.{p}
When all of a sudden, the Faxx rang with a clatter,{p}
  I switched to the Program Manager to see what was the matter.{p}
Out through the phone lines and racing across the walls,{p}
  A jolly fat man and eight bouncing Boing balls.{p}
He leapt to the floor as my PC gave off with the blue screen of doom,{p}
  Then did he haul out a pack, that nearly filled up my room.{p}
As he hauled out computers, whose designs just seemed way too hip,{p}
  I knew in a moment, it must be Saint Chip.{p}
My computer, it will but smoke and but blow,{p}
  I ask, have you anything in that sack to really make it go?{p}
Your problem it lies, in your following of Gates,{p}
  Come let me show you, truly of what he hates.{p}
So, with a twinkle in his eyes and a nod to the table,{p}
  He whipped off my computer and replaced it with something stable.{p}
Behold, the future of tomorrow,{p}
  A system that will fill, Gates with much sorrow.{p}
So I looked and what to my wondering eyes do I see?{p}
  A computer so nice and so fast, and all just for me.{p}
An hour went by as I played with this wonder,{p}
  When suddenly from above there came quite a thunder.{p}
The jpolly fat man oin his checked sled was riding away,{p}
  Wait, to get this new computer, won't you tell me where I may?{p}
As the sleigh rose up to the moon, and away out of sight,{p}
  He shouted down, Merry Christmass to all and to all an...{p}
Amiga!
