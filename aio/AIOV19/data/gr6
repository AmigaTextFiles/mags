 When I got this through my EMail, I looked at the archives name -
wizards.lha. I immediatly thought of an RPG. When I finally got the LhA
to unpack I played it and I was addicted almost immediatly.

 Wizards is based on an old A500 game 'The Teller'. I've never heard of
it, but what your meant to do, is run around collect pieces for a kind
of puzzle. When you get your pieces which fall from the sky you run over
to your home, push UP and place you piece where it should go. In easy
mode the grid flashes the patern, so that you know where to put your
piece, in normal and hard you have to remember where each piece goes.
Also in hard, the piece flashes for a while, and you can't move it. So,
in turn it slows you down.

 There are many special pieces which fall from the heavens, some rub out
your mistakes, others complete rows. There is no docs so I can't tell
you what the others do, but there are all very helpfull.

 Like most games on the Aminet, this is a pre-release, it is V0.8, and
you can only play multiplayer, with up to 3 human players, of course,
you can turn players off, or have the computer playing, but be warned,
the computer is quite good, and he'll put up some fair cometition.

 The graphics are very neatly drawn, you can choose from three
background images, and a few more piece types. You can even make your
own patterns!

 Wizards is really fun to play, and lastable too. As long as there is at
lest 2 of you playing it will be a good game!
