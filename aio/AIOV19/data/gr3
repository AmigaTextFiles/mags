 The author of this loved "ESnake" by Erik Johannessen so much, that he
made his own in Blitz Basic, and added some sound!

 This is a simple snake/worm game which will either run on an interlaced
workbench screen (only) or its own interlaced screen. Although some
flixer-fixing might be needed by some users, the font end is quiet nice.
It uses peignot.font thoughout the main interface. I think this font is
so good that I've installed it as my default font!!

 There are 4 types of skilled level available, named after cars:
{p} {p}
   · Trabant (stands for a tiny German car) - slowest,{p}
   · Käfer   (=Beetle)                      - a bit faster,{p}
   · Audi    (luxury car)                   - even faster,{p}
   · Porsche (no comment)                   - fastest.
{p} {p}
Every level has got it's own hiscore table, with pants scores on it,
which are easy to beat first time (with a bit of effort).
{p} {p}
 I think the Audi actually goes faster than the Porsche, even though the
Porsche is meant to be faster, I don't know, there the only two playable
difficulty levels.

 The title music is a bit dodgy, it isn't even a MOD, its a looped sound
sample! It's nice when you finish though, becuase nice skulls pop up all
over the window - cool?

 This one is very simple, and has been done 1000's of times before. At
least this one has music and SFX, and you can use the joystick, but it
would have been great to see a 2 button 'rotate' movement option,
because I keep backing in on myself!
