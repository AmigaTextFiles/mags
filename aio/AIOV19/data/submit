 As AIO goes on I would like it to get bigger and better and because it
is a freely run magazine we depend alot on you. If you have written an
article or review we would like to include it in our magazine, just
send it along with any relivent details and we'll do the rest, if it's
a games or utilities review remember to use our scoring system and give
it the correct information like where it is obtainable and what is its
final score. We are also interested in any programs you have written your
self and want us to review, if your file is over 500k please email us
in advance to let us know it is comming. Any of your work is welcome or
if you would like to see a certain file reviewed or any information 
displayed please get in touch. If you are a good musician or can make 3D 
or 2D title screens please send us your work!
