Hi, it's me; your happy little web wanderer. But this time it looks like I have
a new hat to wear. Our elustrious head guy, Chris, has decided to offer to bump
me up to Articles Editor (what's the matter Chris, running out of time to do
Everything? <grin>). After much thought I've decided to accept the position.

So, give me your poor, your tired, your articles dying to be heard and I'll put
it all together each month for AIO. I'll also still be doing the WOTM, so feel
free to cue me in on your favorite web sites as well.
{p} {p}
Bye until next month.
