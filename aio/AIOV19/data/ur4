  HtmlColors is an ARexx script to Cloanto's Personal Paint v7+. It is quite
simple to use; you just run it from PPaint and it displays all colors in hex
numbers, ready to be used in HTML documents. It also marks the current
foreground and background pens with "F" and "B" in the list. Installation is
just a matter of copying the script file to PPaint's Rexx directory, and
the only thing it lacks is the ability to change the colors by typing a new
hex value for them... :) But still, it's a very useful tool for all you
html-scribblers out there.
