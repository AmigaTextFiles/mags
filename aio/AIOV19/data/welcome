Hello and welcome to the first issue of AIO using the excellent new

just 6 days and we have pulled all the stops to try and bring you
some of the things that you should get for this christmas season.

I must firstly apologise for any errors in the magazine this month
as it became a bit hectic towards the closing date and I am here
writing this at 13:05 on the 19th December. It should all go smoothly
but please do excuse any hic-ups you may notice through the magazine.
Please do report any serious bugs you find.

Some great things to read this month are an interview with Staurt
Walker of Digital Images, many interesting news stories from our new
news editor, Neil Williams. Full review of TechnoDataBase 98 plus
much much more.

Our final piece of news is that Mark Tierno has moved up in the world
and is now our Articles Editor, please send any articles you have
done to him.

I would like to wish you all a Merry Christmas and please send us
your letters/emails on this new GUI and we'll include them next
issue.
