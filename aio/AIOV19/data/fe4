The Astounding B-Monster No.24{p}
{bold}http://www.bmonster.com{nobold}{p}
Okay all you B monster movie fan, and I know you're out there, even if you 
won't admit it to yourselves. This is the site for you, devoted to all of 
your favorite cheap B-movies, those films that are so cheesey they're 
downright fun. From movie poster blurbs from their original runs, to the 
top 10 cult-movie females and the films they're most notorious for, your 
favorite SF sirens, and bios of your favorite film stars from horror and SF 
B-movies. Also found are interviews with former stars, reviews of all 
those old B-movies with grades on how fun they are, how bad the acting, 
how cheesey the atmosphere, for films all the way back to the '30s. Top
it off with current news of B-movie stars, events, fandom, 'zines, and 
other paraphernalia, and each issue is a real winner.

Bourbon Street, Stories & Jazz{p}
{bold}http://www.geocities.com/BourbonStreet/2767{nobold}{p}
This site is an odd mix of southern jazz and ghost stories. It starts off 
with a background of jazz and midi pages for jazz tunes, and then gets 
down into the meat of ghost stories. True stories of ghosts and hauntings, 
some pictures of actual ghosts, even submit your own. If the stories 
aren't enough, you can peruse a list of selected books on ghosts and 
hauntings available at Amazon Books. If you still want more, opening soon 
will be a section on ghost stories fiction.

Pick Of The Month
{p} {p}
Christmas.com{p}
{bold}http://www.christmas.com{nobold}{p}
It figures that my Pick Of The Month for December would be a Christmas
site, I'm just sadistic that way. Of course, I wouldn't give just any old 
Christmas theme site; no, this one has a twist or two going for it.
{p} {p}
Of course you have the standard shop till you drop on-line, that's almost a 
requirement. And naturally they have a countdown clock to Christmas, 
giving you the remaining time until the fateful hour based on the area you 
live in. And links to all manner of on-line shopping and give aways is 
assumed.
{p} {p}
Then there's the Xmas music, midi, and lyrics. Not to mention the Xmas 
charities, complete with the phone numbers and addresses of these 
organizations.
{p} {p}
Then thrown in the fun things for the kids, frpom Xmas coloring books 
on-line, to games, and even email your Christmas list to old Santa, tell 
him just what you want. Top it off with on-line search of the entire site 
for whatever you need, and it's all  pretty well-rounded.
{p} {p}
But wait, didn't I say spomething about a twist? Okay, you got me; there 
is just one more little thing, but make sure you haven't nipped into the 
egg nog when you hear this  one...
{p} {p}
The Elves In Black! Yes, those mysterious pointy-eared figures in black, 
working to preserve the spirit of Christmas; they're the little guys 
running this whole show.  It starts out with a training manual, giving 
what they wear (the black shades, elven beret, black  jumpsuit and hose, 
etc.), their mission and history, and the most-wanted by the EIB (Sants 
impersonators, usually). There are case files by Agents J and K about 
rogue elves, sightings, and other such.
{p} {p}
So, if you want something different for Christmas, then just stop by 
this site. Until next year...
