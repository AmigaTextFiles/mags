The Industry Council Open Amiga (ICOA) is please to announce that their web
site is finally online at {bold}http://www.amiga.net{nobold}. This site will serve as a
focal point for developers both large and small to communicate with each
other and to bring together information of use to all.
{p} {p}
Some sections of the site are not yet complete, but it has been decided that
things can move forward more quickly given the input of the entire ICOA
membership. If you would like to volunteer to assist in any part of the
site, please contact Ted Wallingford at ted@server.pantheonsys.com and let
him know.
{p} {p}
The new site features special sections for documentation, workgroups,
discussion lists, news areas and more. Many areas, such as Your News, allow
items to be immediately contributed by ICOA members to go online.
{p} {p}
The ICOA is a professional society of Amiga developers and serves to help
developers and advance the Amiga platform.
