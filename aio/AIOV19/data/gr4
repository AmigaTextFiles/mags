 "Fat Ally is the dream child of Mike Hogg and was created during an
imaginative argument on the downfalls of the modern music often referred
to as "Rave". Mike suggested the constant blips and bleeps shoved out
by all manner of drooling DJ's could be connected up to a C64 to produce
an all new game. This game would be called "Fat Ally Cleans the Streets"
and would involve a rather plump person going by the name of Ally chasing an
epileptic Coke can around an abandoned park. A few days later I had
an hour or so to spare so I went to work on an Amiga version of the latter
game. Half an hour later it was complete, and as I like to put it was utter
cack. Still despite these humble beginnings, Fat Ally has gone on to be a
household name (well at least in my household) and international superstar. 
Ally's second game cunningly entitled "Fat Ally 2" was met with somewhat
scepticism (3 refusals from PD companies to date), so it was decided
that the ultimate Fat Ally game had to made to put the allegations of Fat
Ally being crap to rest.  A new Fat Ally game was born, which although
similar sounding is nothing like "Fat Ally 2" (it has "II" instead of "2"
for a start)."

 ...and if you believed that, you will believe anything!

 The above extract was snipped from the Amiga Guide for this game, it is
the authors first Amiga Guide, written three years ago. Fat Ally is
getting on a bit, but it has only just been uploaded to the Aminet.
Perhaps the author was practising FTP?

 When you load the game you are presented with a very dodgy introduction
slideshow. Briefly; you have been commesioned to kill the cast of the
Beano.

 An Imagine 2 render is your title screen, and then you go on to level
1, your time is at the top, and it counts down from 20. All you have to
do is shoot...kill...shoot...shoot...kill...shoot... until so many Beano
characters are dead. Exciting? No.

 The graphics are poor, the game play is unexistant, and you won't be
playing it for long, becuase it is rubbish. No wonder 3 P.D libraries
turned this game down!
