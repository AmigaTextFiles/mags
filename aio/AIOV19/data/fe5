TechnoDatabase98 or TD98 as I will refer to it through-out this review
is as you may guess a techno related CD. If you don't like techno
music, hardcore or anything like that then this CD is a complete waste
of time and there isn't any point you reading on. On the other hand if
you just love techno and music relating to that then read on...

TD98 is a multi-format CD meaning that you can access it on Amiga,
Mac and (spit) PC. Saying this you get the most benifit and can use
more of the bits on the CD if you use an Amiga as it is mostly made for
the Amiga. As the title suggests it is a complete database to techno,
this is somewhat true but it also contains other styles of music like
hardcore, goa, house, triphop and jungle plus loads more. At first I
thought it would be a CD full of 'kickin far-out toons' or however
these people speak but when I used it I was quite supprised to find
that it is not all music and it goes into the history of the techno
style music and how it came about, some of this is very interesting
and even if your totally not into this style of music in parts it is
interesting music. I say in parts as alot of the CD is in French, as
you may guess I can not speak french at all and for you that can't
you will slightly miss out on some parts. If you can't speak french
I still suggest getting this CD if you like techno music.

The music on the CD is alot of music on the 'scene' probably mostly
taken from the Amiga scene but it could also be taken from other computer
platforms which i'm unsure about. Apart from the music there are alot
of other interesting things to see and do. On the Amiga side there is
an interactive book where you can select various things to see visual
effects or play certain styles of music. All over the CD you will find
pictures of clubs and techno groups (mainly french) with scans of techno
magazines and club leaflets.

Overall if you like techno then this is worth getting. It maybe of
more interest to the french crowd or people who can speak french but
if you want to know more about the french techno scene or just listen
to some great tunes then I would recommend this to anyone.
