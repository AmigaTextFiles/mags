  InfoDelve is a tiny utility that opens a file requester where you can select
an icon file, and it then displays the Information window for it (the same as
in Workbench). What's the use? Well, one thing I can think of is that you
might want to change the ToolTypes of a program that's buried deep in your
hard drive. If you normally launch that program with ToolManager or something
similar, there's no hassle but if you want to change its settings (in case it
keeps the settings in the tooltypes :) you would have to open a lot of
Workbench windows, but with InfoDelve you won't. It can also be useful for
programmers if they keep their projects behind numerous subdirectories (like
I do :) since testing different tooltypes will be easy. Well, I guess you can
think of a couple more uses for this program ;)

  InfoDelve is programmed in Blitz Basic 2 and it's PD (source included). I
found only one bug, and I think it might actually be in SwazInfo rather than
InfoDelve... (the comment of the file gets lost).
