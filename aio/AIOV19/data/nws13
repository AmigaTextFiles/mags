NAPALM AMIGA RELEASE DATE{p}
=========================
{p} {p}
We apologize about the Napalm delay, but we hope that as always you will
prefer to see a quality product over a rushed-out version. We know X-mas is
upon us, and like you, we would love to see Napalm come out as soon as
possible. But, we can't jeopardize the quality of the game for the sake of
having the game on sale for X-mas.
{p} {p}
Basically, the game is finished, and is currently going through the final
testing stage. Provided there are no bugs or problems with it, you should
be able to see it very soon. We will let you know the exact date as soon as
it is known. For more information please visit Napalm site{p}

will be closing on December 14th. The lucky winner will be announced on
X-mas day.
{p} {p}
Therefore, if you still haven't preordered Napalm, you only have one more
week to do so.
