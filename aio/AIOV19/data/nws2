Amiga Announces Alliance with QNX for Next Generation Amiga Architecture
{p} {p}
Amiga Inc. has announced an alliance with QNX Software Systems Ltd. to
utilize the QNX realtime operating system (RTOS) as the foundation for the
Next Generation Amiga architecture.
{p} {p}
"The Amiga shook the industry in the 80's with world leading multimedia
architecture." said Jeff Schindler General Manager of Amiga Inc. "QNX's RTOS
resembles many of Amiga's unique qualities. It provides the foundation in
reaching our vision for the rebirth of Amiga in the new millenium."
{p} {p}
"We see this alliance as a powerful combination of superior OS technologies,
common corporate cultures and shared business vision." said Dan Dodge, Chief
Technology Officer and Co-Founder of QNX Software Systems Ltd.
{p} {p}
Building upon the QNX OS foundation, Amiga, Inc. will work with QNX to add
features and functions needed to create the Next Generation in Computing, as
Amiga did in 1985.

Frequently Asked Questions
{p} {p}
Q: Should Amiga developers start programming for QNX now?{p}
A: No. While QNX is the foundation OS, Amiga in partnership with QNX will
add user interface enhancements, more multimedia support and a host of other
convergence features. This will be released through Amiga Inc's developers
program.
{p} {p}
Q: Will I have to re-write my application to run on Next Generation Amiga's?{p}
A: Yes. The new OS has a programming model that is similar to the Classic
Amiga's, but also sufficiently different. In particular, the new OS features
processes and threads (a "thread" is like an Amiga Process/Task), virtual
memory and a very clean microkernel architecture. All access to hardware is
through drivers, so if your application "hits the hardware" it will not
work. Most well written applications should be able to be ported, but to
take full advantage of the new architecture you will want to take advantage
of the new APIs. We also intend to offer significantly better development
tools than are currently available for the classic, which should ease the
transition.
{p} {p}
Q: How about my Classic applications? Will they run?{p}
A: For the Development System, we are investigating either an "Amiga Classic
PCI card" or an "Amiga Classic Emulator". Therefore well behaved 3.1/3.5
Amiga Classic applications should work.
