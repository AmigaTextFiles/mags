  CDID2Track takes CDID files (e.g. "ID120090F10368B4") created by most audio
CD player programs and lists the contents of the above-mentioned CD, so that
if you directly print that text it'll fit the cover of a CD box. But it'll be
quite ugly with nothing more than some text using the Courier font... So,
personally I don't really have much use for this program, especially because
the CDID files are plain text inside, but maybe someone without a decent
"document publisher" or something similar will find it useful... :) Well, at
least it doesn't seem to have bugs :)
