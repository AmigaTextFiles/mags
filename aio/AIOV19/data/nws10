There has been on the Amiga newsgroups a lot of discussion about a website
at www.amigaos.com which appeared a short time ago. The website shows images
and ideas for the user interface of AmigaOS 5, which, thanks to the new FAQ
at the site, we know isn't an official Amiga Inc. company but is an effort
to influence the end OS5 product. While some ideas presented are clearly
pulled directly from Microsoft programs (most of the, in my opinion, bad
ideas shown seem to be directly from MS Office 97) it'd certainly be nice
if Amiga Inc. did listen - something they haven't done recently.

To quote from their FAQ:
{p} {p}
"Why are you doing this?
{p} {p}
   We want to share our knowledge and we want to show the community our designs of OS environments.{p}
   We want to present our ideas to Amiga Inc. this way.{p}
   We want this project to be INTERACTIVE (interaction between USERS and AmigaOS.com).{p}
   We want users of the Amiga community to help on designing an NG AmigaOS and we made the first step.{p}
   Our faith in Amiga Inc. is very small, that's why we made our designs public."
