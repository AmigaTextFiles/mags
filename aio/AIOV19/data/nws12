A shocking title, but not as shocking as the truth. Siamese Systems
({bold}http://www.siamese.co.uk/{nobold}) have added a video slot to their up coming PCI
Amiga, which they claim will allow you to add a fully functional
VideoToaster. Using the Siamese software you can then use the complete
Toaster system, just like any other Amiga software, on the Windows desktop.
