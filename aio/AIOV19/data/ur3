  Captain's log, stardate 36141.3: I have downloaded a little program that
displays the current stardate in the shell window. Testing procedures have
proved that aside from its ability to display the stardate with selected
precision (1 to 7 decimal digits) and print it to a file, it does absolutely
nothing more. We are puzzled about its purpose of existance, and we have
reason to believe that yesterday's breach in the main plasma conduit has
somehow affected the ship's computer systems, rendering the program unable
to perform its usual tasks. We will commence further testing soon...

  Well maybe we won't. It's a silly little program that displays the current
stardate :) It takes about one microsecond to run, yet there are eight
versions of the executable: 68000, 68010, 68020 + 68881, 68030 + 68882,
68040, 68060, PPC (PowerUp) ELF format and PPC (WarpUp) EHF format. So I
guess it won't consume any more of your precious CPU power than what's
absolutely necessary! ;)

  You can set the time zone you're in, but there's a little bug (or a badly
documented feature?); if you're 2 hours ahead of GMT you have to set the time
zone to -2.. And I would've liked stardate to normal date conversion too... :)
Ok that's all folks.
