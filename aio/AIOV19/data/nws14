{subhead} Security Advisory for Amiga Internet users{def}
{left}
{p} {p}

by Nordic Global Inc., 12/05/98,  for immediate release
{p} {p}
During the first week of December a list of over 700 stolen user
names, passwords and host names of Internet service providers was
circulated in the "scene" and posted in several places, including
Usenet. Most public postings did not include the passwords, but
they ARE present in the original list, i.e. the list DOES exist,
and presents a real threat to users on the list.
{p} {p}
Anyone in possession of the list can use entries on the list to
break into Internet accounts of corresponding users, unless those
users changed their passwords in the meantime. In other words: if
YOU appear on the list then anyone who has that list can break
into YOUR Internet account, until/unless you change your
password.
{p} {p}
Some of the entries on the list were obtained using "normal"
means, i.e. by breaking into ISP routers or exploiting known Unix
or NT system vulnerabilities. Things like that happen all the
time, and are difficult to prevent.
{p} {p}
However many entries on the list were obtained using a different
mechanism: a "Trojan" distributed to Amiga users, that secretely
spied username/password information out, and sent them to an
Internet account, where that information was gathered by pirates.
{p} {p}
After a lot of false and sometimes slanderous rumors how that
secret mechanism works and which program is to blame, a joint
effort by Nordic Global Inc. and several helpful users, who
wish to stay anonymous, finally determined the precise way the
passwords were gathered:
{p} {p}
A pirate group spread a fake version of "datatypes.library"
via Aminet. That version has a version number of either 45.4
or 45.5 (depending on when and how you check the version), and
a file size of 32748 bytes. The library contains a concealed
Trojan that reads usernames and passwords from the Internet
settings files on your harddisk, and sends them by email to a
pirate group, who then collects that information and enters it
into a database.
{p} {p}
If you have that version of "datatypes.library" installed, then
you are strongly advised to delete it, and to replace it with
one of the legitimite, safe versions of datatypes.library, e.g.
one of
{p} {p}
- 39.11 (from Workbench disks)
- 40.6 (from Workbench disks)
- 45.3 (from Aminet)
- 45.4 (from Aminet)
{p} {p}
If you install 45.4 then make sure the file size is 27780 bytes.
If it is 32748 bytes then it is actually the dangerous, fake
version 45.5, reporting a wrong version number, not the "real"
version 45.4.
{p} {p}
After that you should physically switch off your computer, wait
for 30 seconds, and switch it on again, just in case.
{p} {p}
Once you have done that, log into your Internet provider and
change your password. If you have previously already changed your
password, but did not replace the fake library, then you should
change your password again now, because your account information
may have been compromised again in the meantime.
{p} {p}
It is not known for sure yet who the author of that fake library
and "collector" of the generated stolen accounts is, but an
investigation is underway. Also, there are very strong, yet so
far unconfirmed, indications (including witness statements by
informants) that the infamous pirate group "Digital Corruption"
is to blame for this.
{p} {p}
If that turned out to be true then it would only prove once again
that software written or distributed by or in cooperation with
pirate organizations cannot be trusted, and may have harmful
secret side effects.
{p} {p}
If you are wondering why it is Nordic Global Inc. who are making
this announcement: the original password list that was
distributed contains a comment in obscene language that those
passwords were obtained through an alleged "backdoor in Miami".
{p} {p}
Do not be fooled by that. That claim is an obvious lie, a
slanderous accusation attempting to tarnish the reputation of
Miami and Nordic Global Inc., without any factual basis. Amiga
pirate groups, in particular Digital Corruption, have been
targetting Nordic Global Inc. with accusations like that for
quite some time because of our strong public stand against
piracy.
{p} {p}
Miami does not have any "backdoors", and could not be used, and
was not used to compile the list, or to provide any information
that appeared on the list. Nevertheless many users and
unfortunately even some developers and dealers spread the false
rumor that Miami is "dangerous" in any way. This is obviously not
the case.
{p} {p}
We felt it necessary to try and find out the truth about how the
list was compiled, not only to document the safety of Miami, but
also to be able to give Amiga users the information they need to
react to this threat and to prevent further damage.
