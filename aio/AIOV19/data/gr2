Legend of the Exploding Fist (LotEF) is an Amiga conversion of the old
classic C64 game, Way of the Exploding Fist. This game first graced
us way back in the glory days of the Spectrum and C64, you where either
a Speccy or C64 man, you couldn't be both as I seem to re-call it. My
personal choice was the C64 as it was alot more advanced and of course..
it was a Commodore computer. No doubt many angry Spectrum owners will
be banging at my door complaining how good it was, oh well you can't
like everything can you? on with the review....

When downloading LotEF I had forgotten what it was by the time I had
come to review it and loaded it up unaware of what it was going to be,
you don't get alot of clues with a name like LotEF do you now? Once the
game had loaded it instantly reminded me of an old C64 game, the 
graphics where blocky so it was obviously a conversion, when I checked
the documents I realised that this was one of the great games I had
spent countless hours playing on in my early days.

LotEF is one of those games that you will either love or hate, there
are two main things that will make you want this game or make you
totally avoid it, the first is that the game is a conversion and so
it has gone for original graphics, sound and music. I personally
think this is great and LotEF reminds me of Way of the Exploding Fist
on the C64, the graphics are exact copies to what I remember and the
samples are similar - although some are taken from IK plus. If you
are someone that only goes for new-style graphics then I suggest you
don't try this. The second thing about LotEF is that it is a fighting
game which I know not everyone likes, it is set in a Kunf Fu style
of game, you are fighting in oriental surroundings in Kunf Fu suits
with the 'wise man' who sits at the back to let you know who has won
the fight.

Overall this is a great conversion and I suggest you take a look at
it to relive some of those old days. Please excuse me, i'm going to
dust the C64 off and have a good old joystick bashing session.
