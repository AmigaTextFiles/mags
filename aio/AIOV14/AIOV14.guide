 Hello once again, yes we are back! no doubt about that, we battle on and
bring you another exciting issue of AIO. This issue is slightly smaller
than regular issues have been recently but there is no quality loss what
so ever. Lee Hesselden has been working fingers to the bone this month
to bring you another great selection of the latest games reviews... well
actually I tell a lie, he has had a bit of a break this month after doing
alot of the reviews for last issue which just missed the deadline. Two
major disappointments this month is that we could not bring you the reviews
of Quake or Genetic Species. We could have brought you the review of Quake 
but we are going to save it til next month so we can review both games
in the same issue and then put them head2head. The problem has been with
Genetic Species and that we could not get any sound from the game but i'm
having words with Paul Carrington at Vulcan and it'll be sorted in time
for next issue.

 Another exciting article this month is about the very nearly here BSE98
party in belgium, its a party for any scener to go along and make demos,
music, do graphics and other sceney things. Check out the news section
for the full invitation. We see a new web browser comming to the Amiga,
PCx and Fusion drop in price and many other great news storys.

 One big @{b}PLEA@{ub} this month is for more contributors and suggestions,
so if you can help with AIO in two major positions being Co-Editor and
Utils Editor then we want to hear from you ASAP. If you want to see a
review of your game/util or an article or help section started then get
in touch with us and let us know about it.

 The last bit of news I have to tell you is AIO now has its own UK helpline
the number is a mobile phone number and can be called at any time. If you 
need help with anything or would like to give your ideas or comments then 
please do phone us. It is also possible to register as an official AIO 
reader via phone by giving the details of what the printed form states. 
If the phone is unavailble please leave contact details or just read out 
the registration details and we'll get back to you. So if you need to get 
in touch just phone : @{b}0831 37 09 22@{ub} - 24 hours a day every day of the year.

 Well for the 14th issue I say goodbye and would like to thankyou for
supporting AIO. See you the same place next month?

 The Belgian Scene event party will be held from the 7th of August up
until the 9th of August, there will be various competitions for demos,
40k demos, music, pictures and many other competitions. It will be
held in Diepenbeek in Belgium. If you want to see a nice intro giving
you all the details while playing some excellent music and showing some
well done hand art download BSEInv.lha from aminet docs/anno. Check below 
for the official BSE invitation.

                         Belgian Scene Event 1998

          - Recognised by Amiga Inc. as an official Amiga party -
  - Recognises by the local Cultural Board as an official Cultural event -

===============================================================================

* NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE *

       This is the final invitation text. This text completely replaces
             the pre-invitation text (released as bse98pre.txt).

* NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE *

===============================================================================

1) Introduction
----------------

You might have already heard about the Belgian Scene Event last year.
If you did, you might also recall that the BSE 1997 was the first
Amiga-only party in Belgium since 1992! And guess what folks, this year
we're back with the BSE 1998 - Amiga only ofcourse!

After the successful experiment last year (to see whether it is possible
to organize an Amiga-event in god-forgotten Belgium) we have decided that
Amiga IS capable of attracting enough people and giving them a good time!
(For more information on BSE 1997, see the BSE 1997 chapter).

Furthermore, Mr. Darreck Lisle of Amiga Inc. will probably also be present
at the BSE party to answer any questions you might have. Ofcourse you can 
also have a nice chat with him ;).

So that's why we are inviting all Amiga-lovers out there to come and join
us at the BSE 1998 party, the cooooooooowlest Amiga-party in Belgium!

===============================================================================

2) Where
---------

This year we have decided to organize the party in a very easy to reach
location! (We admit that it was a bit difficult to find it last year ;).
The BSE 1998 will be held in Diepenbeek, near Hasselt. It is a small town
very close to all the surrounding countries of Belgium. Diepenbeek is
situated at about 40 kilometers of the Netherlands, 60km of Germany and
about 80 kilometers of France.

The partyplace will be the 'Ontmoetingscentrum Lutselus', which is directly
next to the two major highways from Belgium. Maybe an idiot like Bill Gates
would have some troubles finding it, so we are confident that you Amiga people
will find it very easily!

This is the adress:
        Ontmoetingscentrum Lutselus
        Pastorijstraat 7
        3590 Diepenbeek
        Belgium

Read the 'How To Get There' part for more info on... how to get there! :)

===============================================================================

3) When
--------

The BSE 1998 party will be held the 7th, 8th and 9th of August 1998. We
already know this clashes with the Assembly 1998 event, but are you going
to drive all the way up to Finland ? Not us :)

Partydoors will open Friday 12:00 noon and will close Sunday at noon too. This
means 48 hours of non-stop Amiga action, competitions, and entertainment!

===============================================================================

4) How to get there
--------------------

By car :
- - - - -

This is a real easy one. All you have to do is make sure that you get on either
the E313 or E314 (two major roads in Belgium). Depending on what country you're
from (or pass), you will either get on the E313 (France) or E314 (Netherlands,
Germany).

If you are coming from the E313 get off at exit 30 (Diepenbeek), take direction
Genk (LEFT when you are coming from Antwerp, RIGHT if you're coming from
Luik/Liege/Luttich) when you exit the highway, at the 2nd trafic lights there
should be a (modern architecture) church on your right and a big open place on
your left. Turn right there and the partyplace is right in front of you.
(There's a huge plaque saying "Ontmoetingscentrum Lutselus" in front of it, so
you really can't miss it).

From the E314 get off at exit 31 and drive to Genk, go straight ahead all the
time until you drive over the "Albertkanaal" (big pile of water you can't miss).
Then at the second traffic lights take left. The church mentioned above should be
on your left when arriving at the lights, the open place to your right.

Ofcourse we will put up huge, visible everywhere. We made a deal with the local
Police station so that they won't remove the signs.

By Train :
- - - - - -

There are 2 stations where you can get off, both are on the same line
(Knokke-Blankenberge / Luik-Maastricht), namely Hasselt and Genk. In Hasselt
you can take a bus (see below). If you decide to go to Genk, you can use our
Train-Shuttle (read below). If you are coming from Antwerpen or Luik/Liege
there is a train riding between the 2 cities which also stops in Hasselt.
Do NOT get off in Diepenbeek (the train stops there too), it will have you
end up at the complete wrong side of Diepenbeek and you will have to walk
A LOT to get to the party-place (if your sadistic enough to carry around 20kgs
of computer equipment for 10km, then this might be the stop for you ;).

By Bus :
- - - - -

From Hasselt trainstation, you can take the bus in the direction of the
party-place. There is bus nr 36, direction Genk. It departs right in front
of the Railway station's main building (there's a bus every hour). 
Get off at "Lutselus Kerk". Just before the stop you will pass a big 
open space and quite a big road and the party-place on your right, but you 
will have to ring VERY URGENTLY when you pass the party-place since the 
stop is right in front of it :).

However : it is unlikely that this bus will ride on sunday, so try to
use our Train-shuttle between Genk station and the party place as much as
possible. If you want more bus information, you can check the regional office
of De Lijn.

Here are the time tables for the bus from Hasselt to the partyplace:
These shedules are ONLY valid on FRIDAYS. If you plan to come over on
Saturday, then you're strongly advised to use our Train Shuttle service.

All bustickets cost about 80 BFR towards the Partyplace.

If you are coming by train and have some stuff with you that you dont like to
take on a (bumpy) bus-ride, we offer a train-shuttle between the trainstation
of Genk and the partyplace. If you want to use this shuttle-service we DO ask
you to inform us in advance when you will we ariving at the trainstation!!
When you inform us in advance, we will give you a cellular (GSM) phonenumber
to call when you arrived at the trainstation or have missed your train so
that we don't end up waiting for nothing in Genk. A small (symbolic) fee
will be asked for the trip (the gas in fact). If you plan on using this
service, please let us know. Thanks.

By Plane :
- - - - - -

Fly into Zaventem /Brussels (code BRU) and there take a train (omnibus towards
Brussels rides about every 15-20 minutes, the trainstation in the airport is
not hard to find btw.). Look above for the train stuff or if you should continue
by car get on the E40 in direction Luik-Liege and in Leuven get on the A2
(E313/E314) direction Aachen and then look on the maps you can find above.

===============================================================================

5) Facilities
--------------

* The partyplace can accommodate over 300 people, has powerful PA equipment. We
  will also have a high-quality videobeamer (and it won't blow up ;) that will
  provide the online party-news, competitions, and entertainment for 48 hours.

* 200 Amps (in total about 80000 Watt) of high-quality, clean and secure power.

* Loads of people seemed to enjoy last year's bar, so we are going to have a
  fully equiped bar again this year where you will be able to buy Real Belgian
  Beers and real Belgian food! This all will be at very cheap prices, you will
  get 1 consumption for 40 BEF (= about 2 DM / 2 HFL / 1 USD / 6,5 FFR).
  Ofcourse we will also sell a wide variety of sandwiches, snacks. We know the
  food and drinks are a bit more expensive than first announced (well, 7 BEF)
  but this is because the drinks are more expensive in this partyplace then we
  first expected. It is still cheap though :)

  This proves once more that we are not interested in the money! Everything that
  rests after the expenses are paid of will go directly to the competitions!

* There are dozens of places you can eat nearby, there are sandwichbars (a la
  MacDonalds), backeries, grocery stores so you won't have any problems
  getting those hot meals!

* There is a quiet sleeping area reserved where you can do those bits of
  sleeping everyone needs now and then ;).

Things we won't have:

* A party-network: Who needs a network anyhow ? PC-gamers playing
  Quake II ultra-mmx-accelerated versions ? Young kids trading pornography ?
  We Amigians don't need any of that. If we want to trade we do it the real
  way: swapping disks, harddisks and parnet! Ofcourse you are free to setup
  a local parnet/sernet/... network of your own!

* Nasty PC users consuming all the bloody power!

===============================================================================

6) Reservations
----------------

You can make your reservations by either sending an email to:

                             bse98@gmx.net

Just include your NAME/HANDLE/EMAIL and the number of seats you want
to reserve.

Ofcourse you can also reserve your seats online at the BSE 1998 homepage:

    http://uc2.unicall.be/crisp    or    http://bse.base.org

Or if you don't have the internet, try:

PO Box 25
3000 Leuven 3

We will not accept payments in advance. If you reserve your seats you
will get them. The best seats will go first ofcourse.

We strongly ask you to reserve your seats in advance so we have a good
estimate of the people that will attend the BSE 1998. That way we can
make sure there are enough seats for everyone and that everyone has a
decent view!

===============================================================================

===============================================================================

8) Party Rules
----------------

* You are on Belgian soil, so the Belgian laws apply inside & outside the
  party-hall. Some fragments of the Belgian Law:
  - Thou shall not copy illegal software.
  - Thou shall not smoke weed.
  - Thou shall not fraud with the public telephone system.

* The party-organizers have the right to refuse anybody at anytime for any
  reason to connect their whole, or a piece of their equipment.

* Intoxicated (read: drunk, stoned) people and troublemakers will be thrown out.

* If you damage something, you will pay for it yourself. No money ? No problem,
  we'll call your parents.

===============================================================================

9) Useful informations
-----------------------

* Entrance fee is will be 500 BEF (25 DM/ 25 HFL / 16 USD / 85 FFR).

* The party organisers will be at the partyplace starting from Thursday (6th)
  evening. Please note that we can only guarantee that everything will be up
  and working Friday 7th at noon! So if you arrive too early, you might not
  immediatelly have power.

* Mr. Darreck Lisle of Amiga Inc. (Events Co-ordinator) will probably also be 
  present to answer any questions you have concerning the future of the Amiga.

===============================================================================

10) The BSE 1997
----------------

As we already mentioned, last year's BSE was some sort of an experiment, to
verify if enough people were interested in visiting Belgium. We were pleasantly
suprised by the number of visitors: 32 visitors in total! Considering that it
was the first edition, that was not that bad at all! (The average start of a
party is 20 visitors, so we had about 60% more :).

As for the organising last year: we actually organised the whole thing with
a telephonebook & some friends in 3 hours and it turned out rather good :).
This year we are spending 8 months to organize, so it can only get way better!

Ofcourse some mistakes were made last year, and we also learned from them!
Therefor the BSE 1998 will be completely different with:
 - more staff ('coz we really lacked that last year)
 - better equiped bar with more drinks/snacks
 - more entertainment (how about a 4hour videocassette of all those classic
   demos ?)
 - more fun competitions
 - and especially ... more Amiga people to talk to!

 The Amiga market is about to see the forth web browser currently widely
available in the next few months. This new web browser is called Opera and
will be ported from the PC to the Amiga aswell as UNIX and BeOS. A 
tremendous response from the Amiga users is the cause of this new browser
being ported to the Amiga. Does this show that companys will listen if
enough users speak out? I think so, maybe Amiga users should speak out
a little more often. Opera is scheduled for a December 1998 release and
will require WB3.1 and a minimum of 4Mbs of RAM. For more information

@{fg shine} Knight Moves@{fg text}

 Knight moves is loosely based on Chess, following the really amazing title
screen you are presented with a Chess type board. The idea now, is to move
a Knight piece around the board, without going over the same square twice,
the object of the game is to move your Knight over every square on the 8×8
board.

 Although well presented, with nice music, which after a while gets on your
nerves a bit (Thankfully you can turn it off, the only option available),
the game lacks Lastability, you are not puzzling over it for weeks on end,
unlike Lemmings or Monkey Island, although, I haven`t completed it as yet,
i`m not loosing any sleep over it!

 One thing I was very annoyed about is, although there are QUIT buttons
everywhere (Why?) why can`t you flip from Workbench to the game, this is an
AMOS game and for some reason the LEFT AMIGA + A keys do not flick between
screens! Why has it been disabled??

 I thought this was going to be another boring worm game, but when I played
it I was wrong! You control the worm using the mouse, which puts an
interesting twist on the game, at first it is very hard to control, but
once you get used to it, its fine.

 The graphics aren`t the best i`ve seen, but are simple enough to do their
job. You have to remove all the yellow coloured blocks from the playing
area, this is done by moving the worm over the large block. However, on the
playing area their are other blocks, if you hit them, in most cases you
die!!

 This is a very challenging game, bring it out for a quick play every now
and again, and you`ll enjoy it for a long time...

@{fg shine} T.V Chubbies in Armchair Assassin@{fg text}

 This game is based on the very loveable T.V Chubbies (Known to us in the
U.K as the BBC`s newest stars in the British Children`s lives, these
characters will, however, remain nameless!)

 You play on an arena approxamtely 4 screens big, there are various options
available at the start of each game you play. You can choose how many
Chubbies come out of their little box, their speed, your weapon, and you
can even change the look of the screen, to make it a kind of white snowy
look!

 The idea is to blow the living daylights out of the Chubbies, in the
quickest possible time, the time is actually a bit of a con because, as the
number of Chubbies you start with is reduced, the rate at which the counter
ticks over is increased to compensate.

 The game itself isn`t brilliant in the lastablity section, amusingly
titled "Revenge-Ware", the whole point of the game is to get rid of some of
your anger, and blast the little bliters to the death!

 Now for the technical bit... You may need some fast RAM to play T.V
Chubbies properly, when you have the maxium number of Chubbies running
round the screen, on a standard A1200 the game slows down! I have also
noticed, that the high score table only saves the last 3 digits from the
clock, this means if the clock stops on 1001 you come first with 1 on the
clock!!!

@{fg shine} Task Force@{fg text}

 TaskForce is a strategy game in the tradition of Laser Squad, Act of War,
or Jagged Alliance. If you aren't familiar with any of these, just imagine
a bunch of mercenaries packed with some mean equipment and operating in
enemy territory.

 In TaskForce you take control of such a group of soldiers and try to 
accomplish certain objectives by wise employment of your powers. Your
opponent will be either the computer, another human player, or time itself.

A special feature of TaskForce is the mission editor included in the
archive. This way you can easily design your own maps and define individual 
mission objectives.

 Well, thats what the author says, and my opinion, yes, thats right. The
archive contains 3 missions, 2 of them are for 1 player, and the other for
2 players. There are various mission objectives, and to really get started,
the documentation is a must. Read it, remember it, and then play the game.

 If you can remember Hilt II from 5D-Licenceware, you`ll now the story,
Hilt II was licenseware, and I bought it. Although, Task Force, is not as
good as Hilt II, it is in close competition. The best part of Task Force is
the editor!!

 I look forward to seeing future realeases of these game on the Aminet
soon, its a great game, simple, but good!

@{fg shine} Petris@{fg text}

 A brief description: Tetris.

 A long desciption: Like Tetris.

 Well, hopefully you get the idea? This game is another Tetris clone. There
have been zillions of these on the Amiga, and no doubt the P.C, and any
other computer with a bustling P.D scene.

 Each Tetris clone you see has its own special features, new bits, add ons,
what ever you want to call them. Petris' feature is Multi-Tasking. Take a
look at the screen shot... Although it only shows the first 16 odd colours
(Use DPaint or something similar to get around this) you can see that the
game actually multi-tasks very well, which makes this ideal to play while
you disk is copying, or waiting for DiskSalv to fix your disk.

 Although, the multi-tasking feature is great, the bottom line is, it`s
just another Tetris clone, there isn`t much new stuff, a highscore table, a
few fancy scrolling text messages every now and again, and thats it!

 Great game, but no frills. I`ll stick with my much loved favourite Tetris
clone, Tetris Pro, much better, but without the multi-tasking.

                                 RETRIEVE

   The Tekite is held in a room and is brain dead, there is a popup gun
  directly underneath the Tekite ready to destroy it as soon as its moved
                                   off.

Interrogation room is partially sealed with the computer containing the the
  broken Tekite CPU in the sealed section of the room. Can see the sealed
                    section but cant seem to get to it.

 Entry to sealed section via a switch in the sealed section that raises a
wall in a nearby corridor. This allows access to a foyer with a hidden door
 through to the commanders quarters. The Commanders quarters has a hidden
 door that allows access to the interrogation room into the sealed section
               thus gaining access to the broken Tekite CPU.

  Go to the supply room and purchase a blank Tekite CPU then through the
 inventory join the broken CPU and Blank CPU thus gaining a whole CPU with
                        the Tekites memory intact.

 Take the complete CPU back to the Restrained Tekite, insert the CPU, the
  Tekite will now be able to follow you back to the Main Transporter room
  where it can be transported back to the Star Shifter. Must first place
      something on the popup gun as soon as the Tekite Moves off it.

                     This will complete the operation.

                                  CAPTIVE

       You are in the base of Lares. First you will need to find the
  neuroscrambler which is hidden in a cabinet within the store room. Then
transport to the translink room. Enter the commanders quarters and stun the
  commander. Search the room and locate the lockup key. Go to the lockup
 carefully travelling through the power pyramid corridors to avoid as much
                            damage as possible.

Once in the lockup room DO NOT activate the wall switch directly as this is
 booby trapped. Rather, shoot the switch with the laser gun to switch off
  the power pyramids. Unlock the hacker using the lockup key (right hand
  colonist). Lead the colonist to the Central Computer room where he will
 access a terminal to activate the central computer. Once it is activated,
         go to it and insert the neuro-scrambler for programming.

 Wait until the broadcast message is received from the colonist indicating
 that re-programming has finished. Search the central computer to retrive
   the neuro-scrambler and then go back to the commander and insert the
neuro-scrambler. The commander will now be friendly and follow you back to
 the main transport room. However, a trap room will have been released at
this time and you will be swamped by revenging Lieutenants, so be careful.

 After sending back the commander rescue the remaining colonists from the
lockup (and the hacker). If you dont have lockup keys to free them then use
a TED to destroy them rather then shooting as the TED doesn't count against
    you (rogue/criminal). After transporting back the last colonist the
                          operation is complete.

 Only 2 new entries this month, and we see Vulcan`s Genetic Species Demo 
fall off the bottom, along with Never Mind, Myst is still at the top, and 
the only game to survive 13 issues in the top 20 is now at number 13, but 
the question is how long will it last?

@{fg shine} Games reviews and what there score means@{fg text}

 Games are reviewed mostly on playability and how long they will last
you, although some big games with fancy graphics might be expected to
get good reviews it is not always the case. A small 10k game might
get a better overall score than a 1Mb game. It is not that the 1Mb
game isn't any good it's just that the playablility might be non
exsistant and there is no point in downloading a huge file if it
will last a couple of minutes and you will only run it to show off
to friends.

 90%+    -  AIO GOLD (amazing)

 70-89%  -  Nice but some let downs

 50-69%  -  Not to good but it'll do

 30-49%  -  Hasn't really been thought out to well

 0-29%   -  POOR! AVOID!

@node "ur1" "WBJoyTest V1.11"

@{fg shine} WBJoyTest V1.11@{fg text}

 WBJoyTest V1.11 is a simple program to test to see if your joysticks
are working correctly. If you are playing a game and find that movement
is stiff on one direction or there is no movement at all load up
WBjtv1.11 and you can test it out to see if it is the games fault or if
your joystick is really knackered.

 Its small, its simple and its fast, it gets the job it is supposed to
do done quickly and easily. Although the main file is a bit big at 48k
it is still a very useful program. The best feature about WBjtv1.11 is
that depending on what direction you move the joystick the button telling
you which way you moved is pressed in and a different sample is played
for each direction. You can change the samples a customise it to your
own samples. The program comes with drum, symbol and snare samples but
you could change them to your favourite samples say like the simpsons
with homers 'doh!' and other noises.

 Overall a great little program that can be customised galore, maybe
the main program is a bit on the big size for what the program does but
a very useful program and one that everyone needs to get hold of,
especially after a couple of hours joystick bashing on SWOS!

@{fg shine} GuideML - Convert Amigaguide to HTML@{fg text}

 GuideML is an program to convert Amigaguide texts to HTML files for
use on the www. You double click on the main icon, type in what guide you
want to convert to HTML and very quickly it will convert it. Once it
has converted you will have one main.html file and all other files that
are other nodes from the original guide file.

 This is such a great program and should be got by anyone who spends
hours converting guides to html by hand. There isn't alot to say about it
but it gets the job done and its excellent. Thanks to this great program
you will now be able to read AIO online every month in exactly the same 
way you would see the guide file, no need for downloading the whole
archive just read AIO while you are online, look out for details of this
next month.

 Overall this program is well worthy of an AIO gold award. It is the 
simplest and best program of its kind, something not to be missed out
on.

@node "ur3" "SSClock"

@{fg shine} SSClock (Sampled Speaking Clock)@{fg text}

 SSClock, which stands for Sampled Speaking Clock (original name, huh?)
is a speaking clock if you hadn't already realised by the title of it.
You click on the blitz basic icon and it speaks you the time. It is
actually very good compared to other programs of this nature. Most other
speaking clocks on the amiga are jerky and the samples are not flowing
so you can tell that the times and hours have been stuck together but with
SSClock it seems as if everything has been said in one go for each
individual time.

 Its a good program and the most interesting feature is you can use your
own voice or anyones voice if you have access to a sampler. The program
comes with three pre-recored voices. One is by Gareth Murfin himself in
the geordy accent (newcastle area for people who don't live in the UK)
the second is Steve Clack and some woman speaking the time together
and the last is in a Canadian accent by some canadian bloke.

 Overall its a nice simple program with much customisation to be made to
it. You don't have big gaps in-between the different numbers so it sounds
good and with your own voice you can impress you friends.

@{fg shine} Mdoodle - WB doodler@{fg text}

 MDoodle is a small workbench program to let you draw in a wb window,
you can have the window any size you want and the drawing area as big
as you want. There are various options and different shapes and colours
you can use. You can change the draw colour, the background colour and
the different drawing tools from simple line draw to circles, triangles,
thick lines and sprays. 

 This small program reminds me of the old childrens game Magnadoodle
where you had two knobs that you could twist to draw different things
and then shake it to erase the picture, just think of Mdoodle as a
90's version of the old childrens game. I don't actually know what
the 'm' in MDoodle stands for, i'd guess it is Magna but the authors
name is Mark so it could also maybe stand for MarkDoodle. Well its not
the name that counts but the program.

 Overall a nice wb game but the lifespan will leave something to be
desired. Maybe in the far distant future this could turn into something
more complicated and be a WB paint package, who knows?

@{fg shine} Utils reviews and what there score means@{fg text}

 Utils are not marked on how good they are compared to other utils,
they are marked by usefulness and what purpose they serve. As there
are so many different utils that do so many different things it is
hard to review something like MUI and then when reviewing a program
like a WB clock say it wasn't up to the standard of MUI. This is why
it is not possible to have a Top Ten list for utils.

@{fg shine} AIO needs your help@{fg text}

 AIO has now been running for 1 year and 2 months, it has been hard work
to get to how it is now and a small group of people have put alot of
effort into keeping this magazine running. The reason I am writing this
article is to hopefully get you readers to chip in a bit and help out.
AIO is not like main stream magazines like Amiga Format or CUAmiga, running
AIO is not my job, i do not get paid and there is no sponsership to
fund the running of it. So all in all I make AIO off my own back and
out of my own pocket. I give great thanks to the people who have helped
over this time like Daniel Kittingan and Adrian Hendy who sadly are
not editors any more but contributed regularly in past issues. Now the
job is down to me as main editor and the games editor, Lee Hesselden. As
you can probably see the newest issues are much better than issues 1,2 and
any of the other earlier issues and that is because I have more staff
helping out, but now there is only the two of us working on the magazine
and the less people helping out the more the standard of the magazine
will drop.

 So what I am asking is a bit of support or help. I am currently looking
for a Deputy Editor and a Games Editor, if you think you can regularly
help out in one of those spaces please get in touch. If not you can
still contribute a small review or article now and again. It isn't that
much bother to write one article or a help guide.

 I am not about to stop AIO any time soon but in future it may come to
the crunch that it will have to stop. No support unfortunally equals
no magazine. So contribute now and stop AIO comming to an end.
