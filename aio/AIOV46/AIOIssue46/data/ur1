Greetings dear readers! This month's utilities reviews will begin
with the most excellent AudioEvolution (abbreviated "AE" henceforth).
For those unfamiliar with these types of programs I'll gladly give a
brief statement of the general functions; AE's primary goal in life
is to allow you to edit your soundsamples, which you may or may not
have stored on your harddisk. But, it doesn't stop there! If you own
a soundcard/sampler you can toy around with making your own samples
through AE (using AHI- harddisc recording directly through the Paula
chip is however not possible). If you have some vinyl records lying
around, and don't like the idea of ruining them by listening to them
everyday, it's a pretty easy thing to hook up your amplifier into
your Amiga, and sample the whole record, later edit it and why not
burn it off on CD as well while you're at it? Saves you some dough
hunting down the CD version, or if you're like me, actually prefer
listening to vinyl instead of CD, this is a good substitute for
actually playing the record itself, as that full and rich sound of
the LP gets preserved extremely accurate, only digitally instead of
analogically. Later on in this review I will be so kind as to provide
a complete tutorial exactly how you manage to revive your little
jewels (the same principle for "ripping" cassettes applies as well).
But for now, let's take a look at the manual and the nearly essential
information it holds to get you up and running. It begins by
explaining what AE actually does- and a little on what it does not
do. It then goes on describing the effects and how to apply them,
using AE with MIDI, etc. It's also quite short, which suits me
perfectly. After starting the program we see all the different
windows, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with these, and
should you have any questions or wonder something, it's a pretty big
chance you can get an answer by using the online-manual function,
this is in the menu. Configuring AE is quite easy, and you really
should be able to do it without any serious problems (heck, if even I
could get it to work, then so should you!).

Allright, now that you've marveled at AE for a while, here's the
promised tutorial on how to put AE into some really practical use.
Now, before I start I better mention that I can only vouch for the
exact way of doing this on my own system and soundcard, should you
own any other card than one of the Melody (1200 Pro) series, you
might still be able to figure out how to do it, but don't hold me
responsible if all your equipment explode and your LP's and cassettes
melt ;).
