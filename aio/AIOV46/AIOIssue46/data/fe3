The AmigaDE® and the AmigaOS® are the two products offered by Amiga
to allow for the realisation of the dream of Digital Living. Both can
happily exist independently of each other, but together they provide
an unbeatable combination of power, performance and elegance.
{pp}
{bold}AmigaDE & AmigaOS{nobold}
{pp}
The AmigaDE is a universal content environment that can sit native on
low-to-medium resource devices or sit hosted, in software, on medium
to high end devices. Its purpose is to provide a consistent,
interactive environment for users across many different devices and
to provide a consistent development model for developers across those
same devices.
{pp}
The AmigaDE uses the Tao-Group's intent® product set to provide a
clean service abstraction that allows it to sit on both hardware and
software hosts. In this context, one should consider the full device
itself as a set of layers with hardware at one end and, a user
experience at the other. Separating them is a set of layers which
take the capabilities of the hardware, abstracts and packages them
and then makes them available to system and third party applications,
which in turn are experienced and manipulated by the user via a
content environment.
{pp}
From the user's point of view, such static terms as 'desktop' and
'workstation' no longer need to define the digital experience. The
AmigaDE is a digital environment in which any content can be executed
subject to both its requirements and the capabilities of the host on
which it is sitting. If the AmigaDE is hosted on a physical device
which has a Geforce 2 graphics card, a 1 gigahertz Athlon and 256
megabytes of SDRAM, then it will be able to offer those services to
any content that runs on it. If it is running on a PDA with a 100
megahertz processor, 8 megabytes of SDRAM and no hardware accelerated
features, then it will only run content that is able to execute
within those resource constraints.
{pp}
From the developer's point of view, such dynamic brokerage requires
that they either create content for a specific level, in the
knowledge that it will run on anything above that level, or they can
take special advantage of the tailoring system, allowing the AmigaDE
to dynamically modify the performance and presentation of content to
the device profile. They can thus choose to target smaller markets as
a subset or go for the broader market for increased sales.
{pp}
If one considers the device as a whole, then the AmigaDE starts at
the user end and grows down towards the hardware end.  Since every
device has its own particular physical nuances, the AmigaDE uses its
clean service abstraction wherever possible to take advantage of
other operating systems that have already done all the hard work of
abstracting the hardware. This allows the AmigaDE to spread rapidly
to the maximum number of devices with the minimum amount of effort
whilst offering the device builder (and through them the user) the
choice of how they want to present and experience the AmigaDE.
{pp}
Some users can chose to run it co-operatively on top of an existing
and well understood Operating System, such as Windows or Linux,
whilst others can use it on its own, chosing a software host that
best suits their needs to sit underneath it, perhaps a small realtime
operating system. In this master mode, the software host remains
hidden beneath it, and the user chooses only to interact with and
work within the AmigaDE environment. The emphasis in this approach is
on the word 'choice', something that no other operating system
provides in such a complete way as the AmigaDE.
{pp}
Amiga is hard at work on the next version of the Software Development
Kit (SDK) which allows developers a glimpse of more capabilities of
the AmigaDE and introduces the multimedia services for the first
time. This will ensure a glut of content when the AmigaDE makes its
first appearances in the consumer market.
{pp}
The AmigaOS, Amiga's other new product is intended to become the
server core for Digital Living. This will be built up from the
existing base provided by AmigaOS 3.9, the latest version of the
venerable but neglected AmigaOS that started its life in 1984.
{pp}
The current AmigaOS, version 3.9 runs on the old AA hardware which,
while advanced for its time, is now showing its age. After much
discussion with the  existing Amiga community, Amiga released the
zico specification. Zico is an open description of hardware that
Amiga encourages IHVs to use, and which provides a requirement for
the first version of AmigaOS4, OS4.0 to run on. This provides such
features as a PPC processor, PCI, AGP, USB, Firewire and other
features standard in other computers but are new to the AmigaOS.
{pp}
PPC was chosen both because it continues the relationship of Amiga
with the Motorola processor family, and because with the Book E
specifications, the PPC family now offers a very easy migration path
from 32 bit to 64 bit processors.
{pp}
All of these hardware facilities are required to provide a first step
towards the physical requirements that the new AmigaOS will have in
its role of a next generation digital server. A clean implementation,
with no performance losses due to being tied to the older AA systems,
means full access to what the user pays for and a far better
performance all around.
{pp}
Amiga is also aware that during the past five years, third party
companies contributed to the extension of the Amiga AA platform by
providing PPC accelerator cards in ingenious implementations to
increase processor power past the discontinued 68k series. In
considering the design of OS4, much thought was given as to whether
it should also run on those cards. While Amiga had a great
willingness to reward the owners of those cards for the loyalty they
have shown to the Amiga, it was also painfully aware that many of the
implementations were done in such a way that, while adding
performance to the AA Amigas, the details of the implementations
would be antagonistic to the performance of a new version of the OS,
slowing it down and, in some cases, crippling it.
{pp}
Given that AmigaOS4 is the first step on the road to a product in
which performance will be of paramount importance, it was decided
that there would have to be a clean break.  This was done with the
zico specification and, because of the clean nature of that
specification, the first zico compliant device, the Eyetech AmigaOne
- the first, new Amiga certified hardware in over five years - has
been designed in record time and will soon be available for shipping.
{pp}
However, Amiga is still mindful of the thousands of loyal users and
developers who have invested significantly in the PPC accelerators.
Amiga is looking to offer an opportunity for third parties to create
a software compatability layer that can map the clean OS4 to these
PPC accelerators.
{pp}
AmigaOS4 itself will move the existing 68K-based OS3.9 to a PPC
implementation. By order of impact upon user experience, each library
and module is being examined and re-implemented in such a way as to
take maximum advantage of the new zico standard motherboards and
their sub system cards. This is a gradual process and will be spread
out over a few releases of the operating system. Consequently, the
first release (OS4.0) will contain a mixture of native PPC and 68K
code which will run through a high speed PPC 68K emulator. As further
releases come out, the proportion of PPC code to 68K code will
increase until the OS no longer needs to run any emulated code within
itself.
{pp}
In addition AmigaOS4 will also open up the capabilities of the zico
standard, providing USB, Firewire and full access to the PCI and AGP
world of plug in system cards. Amiga users will be able to take full
advantage of the very latest in graphics,audio and networking
technologies
{pp}
Most importantly, AmigaOS4 will see the first introduction of the
AmigaDE for existing Amigans, with it running co-operatively on top
of the Operating System, and then slowly being integrated until, with
the release of AmigaOS5, both will effectively merge to become one.
{pp}
AmigaOS4 will not only be able to run existing AmigaOS applications
(this requires an Eyetech AmigaOne with a AA system attached to it to
provide the AA chipset), but also new AmigaOS4 applications. In
addition, the presence of the AmigaDE means that AmigaOS users will
also have access to the growing volume of AmigaDE applications, able
to take full advantage of its host (one of the advantages of Amiga
owning its own host) and as a side benefit, they also have access to
the large volume of Java applications, since the AmigaDE also
provides a  high efficiency Java solution.
{pp}
In one go, Amigans, both users and developers will go from a small,
isolated platform to one that reaches across the AmigaOS, AmigaDE and
Java worlds, providing a glut of content and a huge increase in
market potential for developers. They can either develop for the
AmigaDE, in which case they have a large market opportunity that
spreads far beyond the number of AmigaOS users or they can
concentrate on the AmigaOS and take maximum advantage of the advanced
features of both the new hardware and the new OS.
{pp}
Again, the emphasis is on choice.
{pp}
The ultimate purpose of the AmigaOS product is to reach AmigaOS5,
where all the services required by the digital core product set will
be finally implemented. This includes brand new and, in some cases,
revolutionary new services that will put the AmigaOS firmly out in
front once again. These are being developed internally by Amiga in
parallel with the AmigaOS4 product set and will be available later in
2002. More details will be released as the work progresses.
{pp}
For those requiring a small taster, there follows a preliminary
feature list and version schedule. All things are subject to change.
The first release of AmigaOS4 is targeted for Summer (in the Northern
Hemisphere), with further releases every six months.
{pp}
{pp}
{bold}AmigaOS 4{nobold}
{pp}
AmigaOS4 represents Amiga taking control of the AmigaOS and
reinvigorating it as it drives it forwards as an integral part of the
Amiga Digital Environment.
{pp}
The purpose of  the AmigaOS4 family of releases is to move the 68K
OS3.9 to a native PPC OS, enhancing and where necessary
reimplementing the OS to take advantage of the PPC CPU add new
functionality to improve the functionality and performance of AmigaOS
allow for full backwards compatability via the Eyetech AmigaOne (with
a classic Amiga attached) or retargetable application compatability
via any AmigaOne move the community to new, state of the art hardware
provide an attractive computing environment to non Amigans so as to
encourage growth of the Amiga community integrate the AmigaDE into
the AmigaOS provide a foundation for the development of AmigaOS5
{pp}
This project will be accomplished via a staged set of releases which
allow Amiga Inc to build from the bottom up. This gives developers
the maximum increase in performance across the releases and ensures
that the users can look forwards to regular and better products
rather than having to wait over a long and frustrating period of time
until something is in their hands.
{pp}
{pp}
{bold}AmigaOS 4.0{nobold}
{pp}
AmigaOS4.0 is the first release of AmigaOS4. It provides the first
stage on the road to a PPC AmigaOS designed to take full advantage of
the potential of the zico based computers being developed.
{pp}
It is designed to take the key elements of the current AmigaOS and
reimplement them as PPC native systems, providing for the biggest
increase in performance. The remaining elements will be left as 68k
code for this release and be executed via a PPC 68k emulator, which
will also be used for the execution of 68k based application code.
In addition, it will add new features that have never before been
available in the AmigaOS.
{pp}
The feature set for OS4.0 will include:{p}
    -ExecPPC allowing for the following execution of PPC, 68k and mixed (PPC+68k) exectuables. This will be PPC native.{p}
    -A PPC 68k emulator - ExecPPC will be capable of executing 68k code, but it will be done via the native PPC 68K emulator. At no time will a real 68k processor be used{p}
    -Virtual Memory System - OS4.0 will for the first time allow developers to create new applications that can take properl advantage of the MMU capabilities of the PPC and make use of Virtual Memory, particularly important with the new games and applications being created.
