ST. LOUIS, MO, March 30, 2001 - Amiga Incorporated, a pioneer in the
development of multi-media and content, today announced a long-term
partnership with Sharp Corporation, a worldwide developer of
innovative products and core technologies in electronics, in which
Amiga will develop content for next-generation Sharp handheld
computing devices.

In March, Sharp announced its plans to market the Zaurus PDA in the
United States and Europe as one of the world's first Linux-base
handheld device.  The Linux operating system is gaining wider
acceptance in the computer server market because its underlying code
is freely distributed on the Internet. Easily adaptable for different
hardware devices, the Sharp handheld will be able to run software
written in Sun Microsystems' versatile Java software language that
supports different operating systems.

In this partnership, Amiga announced that its developer community
would either develop new content or adapt existing content for PD
applications, using their reputation for innovation and leadership in
gaming, 2D, 3D, animation, video, and music applications
Amiga-developed content can be downloaded directly through wireless
networks, using desktop computers, or ported directly into the new
device.
