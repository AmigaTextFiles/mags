WBPattern Prfs:  The Scale options work great but if the aspect ratio of
the picture you have in mind is too far off the 1:1 mark (ie: long) then
you might get anything from just the upper half to a really intense
close up.  Use Center option for these pictures.

Assigns can be useful for more thn just theprograms that need them.  If
you have a well used root path replace it from an assign for reference;
also useful if you ever need to swict harddrives or directoris around.
xample: DH1:Programs/Internet/ could be replaced by Internet:,
especially useful with a lot of subdirectories coming off that.

Always keep a basic startup-sequence in your S:, along with a
corresponding basic user-startup; something like startup-sequence.BASIC
and user-startup.BASIC.  Nothing more then the bare minimum you need
to run things.  That way if something goes really wrong after some new
software install you can start from something you KNOW works and go from
there.
