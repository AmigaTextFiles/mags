{subhead}Paws 'N' Claws{def}{p}

One of my all time favourite games is Chuckie Egg. So I obviously
have a version of it on my hard drive but I stumbled across a copy of
it on Aminet that adds a little more to the original version.
{pp}
Like I've mentioned Paws 'n' Claws is virtually the same game as
Chuckie Egg but for those of you who may not have played it (shame on
you) here's a brief outline of the game.
{pp}
Guide your character around the platforms, up and down the ladders,
avoiding the bad guys and collect all your items to complete the
level. You might have noticed by now that I'm well into uncomplicated
games!
{pp}
When you load the game you're greeted with the title screen and
you're then into the game. The only option you have is whether to
play 1-Player or 2-Player. This is a great advantage over the
original. The only problem is player 2 has to use the keyboard. You
can then choose to play as Paws the dog, who collects bones, or Claws
the cat, who collects fish All the time you have to avoid the Animal
Wardens that are out to catch you.
{pp}
Each level has a time limit in which to collect all the items. Once
collected you move onto the next level and your remaining time is
added to your score. The only problem with this is that you find
yourself waiting for the wardens and losing a life because you can't
go and your time runs out.
{pp}
Graphics and sound are both very serviceable and are faithful to
Chuckie Egg from where Eric Park received his inspiration. A great
game with little to let it down.
