So what can't AROS do at the moment? It seems there isn't far to go.
For developing for AROS you will need linux. You can also run AROS in
an X window. But that's no fun. That doesn't sound like an AmigaOS
replacement, right? Two boot disk images, rawrite, and a couple of
blank disks are all you need to do just that. You can boot your
Pentium/Athlon/AROS supported x86 CPU powered computer, with AGP
graphics card, and run what is virtually AmigaOS natively!

Here's a grab of AROS booting using VMWare (Virtual Machine - An x86
PC emulator for x86 PCs - I guess it saves rebooting if you crash!)

One thing that is missing in AROS is a workbench replacement. The
contributions archive does contain Scalos, but I was unable to test
it on my setup. There is a lot of source in the contributions archive
- Quake, Doom, old workbench favorites, utilities, network/internet
tools, too many examples to name. For more information, check out the
AROS site, http://www.aros.org. There you can find subscription
details for two mailing lists, one for users and one for developers.
So, if you have a linux installation or an IBM PC, check this one
out. A real eye opener!

Now that AmigaOS 3.x has been removed from the hardware, Amigans face
a bit of a moral dilemma. There are many issues. On the one hand,
what makes an Amiga? The hardware, the OS, the software, the
combination of them? And what about practicality? Commercial
developers wouldn't develop for AROS, but AROS isn't meant (AFAIK) as
a final operating system. It is a test bed. A tool. Something that
the Amiga community can forge into something advanced.
{pp}
There is legality issues also. Now we have AmigaOS 3.9. Is Amiga
bothered by Morphos and AROS? It looks as if efforts by the Campaign
to Open Source AmigaOS was a waste of time. On one hand, Amiga
themselves are working on OS 4 and 5. On the other hand, we have
AROS, which is open source, and finally, working. Perhaps COSA wasn't
entirely fruitless. Perhaps it's this kind of attention that now have
now made Amiga take our 'classic' OS seriously. Users and developers
alike are split. We also have AmigaDE and MorphOS. And the non-Amiga
third party extensions as well, such as MUI, Reaction, ClassAct &
Co., Cybergraphics and P96, to AHI or not to AHI, PowerUP or WarpUP,
Warp3D etc.

Let's hope Amiga Inc. and their buddies Haage & Partner know what
they are doing. It seems a shame to see AROS (and MorphOS too) left
out in the cold, after seeing what it has to offer.
