From VGR website : " Mr. Randy West posted some information on
VillageTronic GmbH and the Voodoo add on module for the Picasso IV on
comp.sys.amiga.hardware:

"Talk to a friend that lives by Villagetronic. It's offical
Villagetronic Amiga is more more 80% of the Amiga workers have been
laided off. There won't be a Paraglider unless they sell the
prototype board which is the only one that was made."

That was a follow up to this post "The last announcement I got from
Blittersoft was last summer (or last fall?) when they confirmed that
the project was still going on. I got an email from them a month or
so ago where saying that they removed the advertisement from their
site. Since 3dfx is kind of dead, are there any chance of seeing this
product come to life?"
