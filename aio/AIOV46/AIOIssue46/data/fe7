Well, seems our Games Guy Barry is selling his AGA machine and getting a
Voodoo box.  This means, that while he'll continue to guest review
games that run well on that graphics board, we'll still be needing
someone with a regular Amiga (at least until we all have Amiga Ones and
it doesn't matter) to be our regular Games reviewer.

So, once again we need to send out the call.  If you play a lot of games
and think you can be responsible for 3-5 game reviews a month (and as an
option, think you can stay atop coming gaming news or shoot for the
occasional games-oriented interview), then just email one to
{bold}general@aioworld.com{nobold}, Subject = {bold}Games Editor Position{nobold}.
