One of the more recent game releases for the Amiga is Bubble Heroes.
A Bust a Move clone that has improved nicely against the Playstation
original. Although I already have Bubble Heroes it is a pain to get
working on an AGA machine so with this in mind I went in search of a
game of the same values and have found a truly brilliant version.

Guy Maysonnave has used Blitz Basic to create a Freeware version that
is so good you might think twice about buying any commercial version.

Once the game is on your hard drive you can open the drawer and
you're greeted with several choices. If you know how to play Bubble
Heroes or Bust a Move then launch the game. If not then I'd advise
you to read the readme. That said, it is a simple game. All you have
to do is clear the screen of bubbles before they touch the bottom of
the screen. You do this by connecting three bubbles of the same
colour. Easy enough but there is some strategy involved.

When you load the game you're into the intro screen where you can
input your name and chose the type of game.

Normal: Erm...Nuff said.{p}
Crazy: Each level will descend at a different, random speed.{p}
Hot: Same level each time but no bonuses.

Playing Bubblestones is very addictive. Especially when you realise
that how you clear the screen has a direct effect on your score.
Basically there is a timer that counts down from 1999 and when the
screen has cleared the remaining time is added or subtracted (if the
timer shows a minus number) from your score. How you drop the bubbles
will add time and certain bonuses do the same.

Another fine touch is the fact that, if you've got the know how, then
you can alter the look of the game to suit your personal choice. Very
handy if you're colour blind and can't tell light green from yellow
like me. Bummer!

The graphics used might look familiar and the sound is OK but overall
this is a very polished result.
