Let me take you back in time to the heady days of home electronic
games of the 80s. I'm sure there are some people out there who
remember a clever yet simple game that came as a round, black plastic
bit of kit with four coloured buttons. Its name was Simon.
{pp}
The object of the game is to follow the sequence of buttons
accompanied by sounds for as many levels as you are able. Hence
"Simon Says".
{pp}
All you need to use are the cursor keys. That's it.
{pp}
As soon as you load the game one of the buttons lights up accompanied
by that button's sound. You just copy it and the computer will then
light two buttons, then three and so on until you make a mistake.
Easy!
{pp}
The further in levels you go the faster the computer plays the
sequence so you really have be concentrating if you want to get to a
decent level. When you make a mistake there is a death yell and the
high score screen comes on with your rating and a comment on your
ability.
{pp}
The graphics and sound are about as good as this game is ever going
to need. Richard Fhager has copied the original game perfectly and
you won't need to get a different version of this game in our
lifetime.
