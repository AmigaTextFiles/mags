Greetings to one and all:
{pp}
What a wonderful time it was for us in St. Louis.  I must thank our
hosts Bob and Diana Scharp and all of the members of the Gateway
Amiga Club.  They once again outperformed and kept things rolling.
{pp}
I want to make very clear what the announcements were and what it
means for Amiga and the rest of the Amiga Family.
{pp}
	Amiga has made NO change in strategy with AmigaDE.  Things are going
great, as expected, and we have some impressive new customers; Sharp
being the first.
{pp}
	Amiga OS 4.0 and beyond was announced.  This is a staged series of
releases that will bring a native port of the AmigaOS to the PPC.
This is NOT about WarpOS, vs. anybody.  It is an Amiga Inc. port of
the OS.  You may infer nothing else from this.
{pp}
	AmigaOne A1200 is the first new hardware, for the Amiga, and we are
still planning a standalone ATX board and other new pieces of
hardware.  AmigaOne for the A1200 will be out this summer. We are
then looking at releases later in the year, for the new standalone
designs.
{pp}
Summary:{p}
	AmigaDE doing great and on target with the goals that we set forth and we will continue development efforts.{p}
	AmigaOS 4.0 out this summer with the first of the AmigaOne Zico specification machines.{p}
	Sharp is a new partner of Amiga Incorporated. More will soon be released about our relationship.{p}
