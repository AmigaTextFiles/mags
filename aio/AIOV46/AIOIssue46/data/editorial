Well, big news from Amiga.  Our favorite old OS gets a major re-work
to bring it up to date and ready for interface to the Amiga DE.  No
shareware updates this, we're talkjing an actual real commercial
development here.  Yes the De will satill run on anyone's else's
platform, but pon the AmigaONE it will {italic}SMOKE{noitalic} with
the better then ever AmigaOS, just as it would have been had
development continue on from the old Commodore days.  All this, and a
release schedule as well.  Could anyone ask for more?  (Well, a girl
and money in the bank, but that's quite a different story.)

Of course, all you registered AIO subscribers knew this already from
our earlier Special Report <grin>.

For the rest of it, we've a great issue here, and for the editorially
inclined please read our plea for a new Games Editor.  So, until next
month, enjoy the issue.
