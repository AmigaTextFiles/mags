From the fusion mailing list: " Paul Lesurf, Blittersoft:
Blittersoft will be sending an update to all registered users of
iFusion in the next day or two. "We inadvertantly placed a version of
iFusion on the release CD that was not the latest one supplied by
Microcode Solutions. Since discovering this, we have received an even
newer version, which is the one that will be sent. This also includes
an updater program. Please ensure you register your purchase as
detailed on the release CD, or visit Blittersoft website {link http://www.blittersoft.com}www.blittersoft.com{end}.
