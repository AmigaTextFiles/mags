{bold}Goofiness Dot Com{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.goofiness.com/{noitalic}{p}
Basic general goofiness made for those that just want to waste time for
a few laughs.  A few minor diversions liven up this site, just the
thiung to waste that time you could have been doing something useful
during.{p}
Personality tests.  Take one of several tests to see if you have a
personality. Twenty five tests currently, none of which give any
meaningful information but have rather fun questions.{p}
Got a questiuon?  Want to know to whipe standing up or sitting down? 
Then ask Mister Thunderpants.  Tired o that then start downloading 
jokes, parodies, and satire in MP3 format.  There's also a Flash based 
search engine though one would wonder at the need or Flash just for a
site search.  Oh well; I guess that {bold}is{nobold} goofy.{p}
The mood of the site is best exampled by quotes from the site itself.
For instance, the site is "Optimized for a monitor", and there are such 
occasional quotes as "If a man is in a forest without his wife and says
something, is he still wrong?"  Like it says..., just the last bit goofy.
