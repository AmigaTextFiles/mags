AmberRam is a "replacement RAM disk", we've all had our little
struggles with the RAM disk- being annoyed at the low character
lengths allowed, always showing as 100% full, to name but a few.
Sure, there's been a few patches, just taking care of one piece of
the problem here and there. AmberRam on the other hands has a whole
bunch of features designed to take care of most things there are
already patches for the original RAM disk, and some things I had no
idea was a problem to begin with (better be on the safe side,
though). However. there's not all advantages, there are some
disadvantages, for example you can't make directories from the WB,
and certain programs may not work at all with AmberRam.

The installation is pretty easy, there are only some stuff that has
to be copied into your L directory (on your boot partition) and in
the Devs:Dosdrivers drawer. There are two ways of running AmberRam,
one being as a full replacement, and the other as only a temporary
replacement, which you can mount and dismount whenever you want to.

The program is released under the GNU license thingy, so if you're
cunning enough you can take a look at the included sources - we
others simply have to be content with... not, doing that...

And does it work? Yes, it certainly seems so at least. But the full
replacement and the temporary replacement didn't give me any troubles
at all while testing it. Not that it bothers me too much, but I
suppose it would be nice to see a 100% accurate RAM replacement in
the future, and the way things are now it looks like we might see
that now sometime soon.
