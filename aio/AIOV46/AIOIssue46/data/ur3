Most people should know about this program, it's been around for
quite some time. Which of course is a good thing, especially since
the original version-command isn't much to cheer for. It can be used
in a much better and easier way than the original version, for
example shift-clicking on the VersionWB icon and then on the file you
want to check for version strings, select file to check by
double-clicking on the icon, or use it through the CLI or DOpus
(there's a script provided for this, both 4.x and 5.x versions of
DOpus) or similar. You can also check the version of other files than
libraries, such as devices, guides, etc.

Speaking of guides, the manual is immense, especially if you consider
that this program is really quite small (the guide is bigger than the
program itself ;), and it covers all things you can possibly want to
know about things concerning versions and how to use VersionWB to get
the best out of it.

If you're still using the version command supplied with the
Workbench, you really should take a look at this as it has tons of
more- and better features. It's also giftware, so people with
registration-phobia can use this safely without feeling too bad about
themselves.
