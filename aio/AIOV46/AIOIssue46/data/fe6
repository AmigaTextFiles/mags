{subhead}AROS - The truth is stranger than fiction{def}{p}

No doubt most people would have heard of AROS, but what does it do?
How does it do it, and how well? And what for? And why does it seem
it has existed forever, but I've only just discovered it actually
works?
{pp}
AROS, short for Amiga Research Operating System, is as close to being
AmigaOS 3.x (TM) compatible as possible, whilst possessing some
amazing qualities. It's open source. It has resource tracking which
can be compiled in. It is capable of running on many hardware
platforms, provided someone is willing to do the ground work.
Currently the focus is on x86 linux installations. There is talk of
an (Amiga) PPC native version, but it seems none of the main
developers own a PPC board. Other platforms such as Sun and Mac are
possible.

So what does AROS hope to achieve? According to the website
(www.aros.org), the first lines of code for the project initially
started being written in 1997, after much discussion about the state
of AmigaOS since Commodore went down and takeovers took their course.
AmigaOS was standing still. The project's aim was then simple: to
create an OS3.x compatible OS, that could be used as a test bed for
new technologies that the current AmigaOS (at the time) simply didn't
have. AROS is open source, so it enjoys the benefits that result.
These people are working for free, so the programmers care about
their code and the project in general. And everyone can contribute.
It really couldn't be done any other way.

See for yourself how AROS itself has progressed in recent months{p}
