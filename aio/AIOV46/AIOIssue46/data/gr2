If I mention Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Lure of the Temptress
and Hook I think I'll have grabbed the attention of all the gamers
who really enjoy this type of game. Apart from Simon the Sorcerer 2
there has been precious little to shout about if you want anything
new in this genre.
{pp}
So, I bring you many wondrous gifts from the East. Well from Germany
actually. That's the home base of Frank Otto the creator of Lost on
Parrot Island.
{pp}
Open the drawer and you've got the usual choice, readme or game. No
choice there then.
{pp}
When you load the game you immediately have the choice of languages,
German or English. Choose and the title screen pops up with four
choices and a happy little tune.
{pp}
I ran the Intro. Fairly basic with an obvious storyline (you're on a
ship, it sinks and you have to swim to a desert island and find a way
to get home) but let's face it, it's better than I can do!
{pp}
Let's start the game then. The first screen shows your man walking
onto the beach and the adventure begins. If you have played any other
games like this then you'll be able to get stuck in straight away. If
not then have a look at the instructions but it really is very
obvious how to use the format.
{pp}
You have to visit as many locations as you can and move the mouse
around each location to see if there is something you can interact
with. Pick it up, use it, open or close it, talk to it etc, etc. Each
location you visit might help you solve the puzzles given you and
once a puzzle is solved it will open up new locations to visit. All
with the aim of getting off Parrot Island.
{pp}
I'll tell you what though. I'm well stuck! I've got a club, branch,
firestone and a thorax and I can't get past the Islander??? I really
would appreciate some help here.
{pp}
All in all Lost on Parrot Island is a very good game (even though I
can't get anywhere). The graphics, although not Simon the Sorcerer
standards, are fine. The tune is OK but does become repetitive. My
only gripe is the fact that there are no sound effects, which seems a
shame.
