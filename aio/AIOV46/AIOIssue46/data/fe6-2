This is all very interesting, but how useful is it? And do we need to
rewrite our old OS3.x programs? The short answer is, not necessarily.
Obviously there is no talking to the chipset, so it looks like our
AGA classics will need some work. And chances are if a program breaks
easily, such as when it's run under OS3.9 rather than 3.1 or just
plain bangs on the hardware, then it will need some work to get it
running in AROS. Also, if AROS is to be a step forwards, then
hopefully the old quirks and shortfalls in the old OS are gone, (or
going) and if a program doesn't like that then perhaps it should move
forwards too.

Basically, it's possible a simple CLI or Reqtools based program will
just compile under AROS with barely any changes to the source at all.
The obvious limitation here is only the C language is used, unless
someone compiles an AmigaE or AMOS compiler. In practice, you have to
change a few things that are done differently in AROS. New AROS
functions have been introduced, which might mean less of a mess in
your source code (or AROS's source). Some things have changed course,
like the naming of some header files, and some functions may require
a different implementation. For example, you are required to call
allocmem() rather than malloc() for allocating memory on the heap,
[[and wb.h is now workbench.h]].

All in all, superficially, you can see things look the same they've
always been. Here is a screenshot of Dopus 4.12 (from
{link http://www.aros.org/screenshots/}http://www.aros.org/screenshots/{end}), which went GPL last year.
