Is the search for the ultimate WB 3.x icon copier neverending? Yes,
unfortunately it is, therefore I will pester as many people as
possible, until the end of time if I have to, the world needs more
icon copiers. It is my destiny to dive as deep as I can into this
matter. My latest aminet probing resulted in this program. The
program is described as "yet another" icon copier, but I dare to
stand up against that statement, yes, it's true, because even if the
humble appearance of Iconmaster leaves no surprises, I went as trying
it non stop for a staggering 10 minutes before I drew the conclusion,
that this comes pretty near of being the ultimate icon copier, it
does however not reach entirely all the way, but gets credits for the
MUI interface and the, somewhat unique features for an icon copier,
such as a good drag & drop interface, possibility to create default
icons to use for all drawers, saving some time when creating a lot of
icons, and not to forget, a brief manual. The fall of this program is
the lack of copying icons by "shift-clicking", without actually
starting the program and use the GUI.
