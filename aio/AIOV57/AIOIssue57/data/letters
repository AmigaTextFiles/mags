I have a Amigo P.C. 2000HD. Up to now I thought the Amigo was Dead.
I would like to know if there is anybody that knows how to repair them.
Any help with information to get me back on the right track again would
be greatly appreciate . I have the first Toaster by NewTech installed
on the Amiga. If their is no help for me on the P.C. , Is there any way
that I can reinstall the Toaster on a new P.C.   Thank you very much for your time..

The first thing is to make such feature like MagicMenu, Birdie and Visualprefs.
That are the things that makes everything looks so great and every user have their
own look :) Just change prefs/picture etc.

Hey, i forgot that Reaction should take a look on MUI. It should have these and more features.
All these patches makes our amiga worth using :) And many pc users say: What... this is really
great looking.

So this is not single but multi important cosmetic feature for OS4. I think in further way.
There is always BoingBag's and everything could be done with all releases.

Next month's Hot Topic:  "Do we really need to support the x86
platform?  Or if given a better choise will people abandon that aged
architecture and beat a path to the PPC and other alternatives?"

Send in those replies and we'll print them up next month.
