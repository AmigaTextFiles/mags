How many of you remember an old adventure game called Maniac Mansion?
It was published on the old Commodore 64 and signaled the beginning of the graphics adventure games on the home computers.
Before then, adventure games were made with the use of static pictures and plenty of text and even if they were not attractive as the modern ones they  certainly guaranteed plenty of fun to the gamers of the eighties.
Day of the tentacle (DOTT) is the follow up of Maniac Mansion and was released on the PC back in the 1992.
Ten years later Amiga gamers have finally the chance to play this game thanks to a wonderful piece of software called SCUMM VM (see review in Utility section of this issue).

The game utilize the SCUMM interpreter and therefore its interface is quite similar to the Monkey Island one.
The top three quarter of the screen is were all action takes place.
The bottom part of the screen is used to display your inventory and the set of commands (take, look, open, etc.) needed to interact with the game.

DOTT begins with the famous tentacles (which were part of the Maniac Mansion plot) set free and ready to rule the world.
It all began in the original Maniac Mansion, were a mad doctor was possessed by a meteor that came from outer space.
At that time our heroes managed to solve the problem and save the world but unfortunately after Purple Tentacle and Green Tentacle got set free, while they were taking a stroll around the maniac mansion, Purple Tentacle decides to take a sip of water from a nearby toxic waste pipe. Unexpectedly, it grows smarter and becomes more aggressive and decides to take over the world!
Fortunately, Green Tentacle (the good boy) manages to slip a message to the courier hamster and ask for help from our three heroes in the future.
Hence they are back one more time to save the world.
So, the good Doctor manages to send our heroes back in time (unfortunately each one into different time eras) to stop the tentacle from drinking the toxic water.
Bernard the computer geek(the only one to make a return from the original Maniac Mansion), Laverne the medical student, and Hoagie the rock roadie who is a bit tick are all controlled by you using the mouse, and it is only by combining their skills that the game can be solved.
Each one of them is trapped within its own time era, but can easily swap objects by using a time machine that operates like a toilet to flush objects through time.

The beauty of DOTT is that it is one of the first games to feature cartoon like characters with animated facial expressions and exaggerated physical body parts.
The game features a lovely talking intro and plenty of the typical Lucasart humour.
There are numerous sound effects that make the experience worthwhile and similar to cartoons on TV.
Unfortunately the version I tested had the speech available only in the intro and not throughout the game.
Lucasart later published a full talkie version on CD ROM which I am not sure whether it will work with the SCUMM VM.
The music of the original game made use of the famous IMUSE system which changes the music according to the events on the screen.
The puzzles are pretty simple and talking to other characters is essential to get the clues necessary to solve the game.
At times, you might get stuck due to the illogical way puzzles are presented. This is a common way game developer prolong the life of adventure games. It can be annoying but it won`t take the fun away from the experience.
Like in all the Lucasart adventure games you are not allowed to die and can therefore play the game and explore scenes without the fear of death.
Although DOTT is an old game it can still bring a tear of joy to Amiga gamers who have wished to play this game for many years.
Maybe many of you have already had a chance to play it on a PC or MAC (Fusion anyone?, but if you fall in the category of the ones who have never played it I suggest you to connect to the Lucasart website and purchase DOTT because it can surely bring you many hours of fun.
