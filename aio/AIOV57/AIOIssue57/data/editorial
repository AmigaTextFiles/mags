Welcome, to Fantasy Isl- er the CD issue of Amiga Information Online! 
Just this once we thought we'd bring you a whole CD full of AIO stuff
and this is the issue that you will only get if you have this CD.  So
feel priviledged, feel special, feel like using this for something
besides a drink coaster.

Okay, now for the editorial stuff.  We have seen hardware!  Yes,
apparently the Amiga One board is finished and but waiting for the
software which is still currently progressing.  This would seem the
light at the end of the tunnel that we have been looking for; maybe by
May or June we'll finally have a new machine.

Many people have been complaining about Amiga and Microsoft cozying up
together with this new AmigaAnywhere and think it's the end of the
world, but they're all forgetting one thing.  Notice the word
"anywhere"; the new software will be able to run on {bold}any{nobold}
platform, be it Wintel, armstrong, Mac, or anything else.  Microsoft
just happens to be one of those many platforms, albeit the one with
the 90% market share.  Now, I figure this way; if Microsoft needs
Amiga to write some programs that {bold}work{nobold} then more power
to us.  We'll infiltrate like a virus, and of course they'll need the
new AmigaDE setup on top of their Windows to run any of it, which in
turn will get people hooked and perhaps abandon the old Windows thing
altogether.  People will either keep using Windows because now some
other company is making programs that work (Amiga) or they'll be so
entranced by this new way of making software that they'll go
completely Amiga in the end.  Either way they'll be using Amiga stuff,
as distributed by a company that owns 90% of the home computer market,
even if Microsoft {italic}doesn't{noitalic} realize they'll be slitting their own
throats in the process.

Does anyone see a problem with this?
