Turtle Lightning Amiga Software has been in business since 1992
supplying Amiga users all over the world with quality affordable
software and hardware.

Owned and operated by Terry Fike out of Midland, Texas, USA, Turtle
Lightning Amiga Software has finally decided to go out of the Amiga
business.

Accordingly, all of our prices are rock-bottom, and when a title
sells out it will be removed from the catalog. Prices are just
pennies on the dollar of the original retail, so get 'em while they
last!
