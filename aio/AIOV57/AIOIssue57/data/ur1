{bold}LUCASART RETURNS TO THE AMIGA!!{nobold}

As the titles says Monkey Island has returned to the Amiga, but not in the recent 3D form PC and PS2 owners have enjoyed it.
Let me explain.
Players who have been with Amiga for a longtime will surely remember adventure games such as Monkey Island 1 (or 2) and Indiana Jones.
Those games were mainly developed to take advantage of 256 colour screens and later converted to 32 colours to be run on Amiga resolutions (at that time AGA was just a thought in Commodore`s mind).
Although the Amiga conversions did not lose out in terms of playability we always felt left out with the low quality graphics we had to live we with.
Thank God that was the past.
The future looks very bright now with the advent of a recent piece of software called SCUMM VM.
Indeed, it is now possible to play the majority of the old adventure games, published by Lucasart, in the splendour of 256 colours on our Amiga screens.

If you are wondering how that is possible just read on.
What we have here is a SCUMM virtual machine which is an implementation of the famous S.C.U.M.M. (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion) interpreter used in games such as Monkey Island and Day Of The Tentacle.
That script was created at that time to make development of Lucasart adventure games an easy and quick job.
The interpreter I have tested is the WARP OS version (which takes advantage of PowerPC cards) version 0.1.0 - release 2.
Now, although it is an early version I can assure you that the interpreter is very stable and can quite happily run some of those old SCUMM games.
For user without PPC card there is a version that makes use of 68K processors with AGA or RTG screens.

The latest version of the emulator can interpret SCUMM games that make use of the    .001 type resources.
Therefore games such as  Monkey Island 1 (CD version), Monkey Island 2, Indiana Jones And The Fate Of Atlantis and Day Of The Tentacle (DOTT) have been reported to work properly.
I have only tested DOTT and it all worked smoothly.
Sam & Max has been reported to work partially and the authors of the emulator are working very hard to improve the compatibility with all the games that make use of the SCUMM interpreter.
Unfortunately some things are still missing in a few games, and there are still a few bugs that need to be ironed out but, overall, it is possible to play some of the games all the way through to the end.
Also, there is limited  support for ZakMcCracken in 256 colour, Indiana Jones 3 VGA version and LoomCD.
In truth, I can`t wait to see this script running the old but hilarious Maniac Mansion.
Plans are on the way to sort out this problem and to get games such as Full Throttle and The Curse Of Monkey Island to finally run on our Amiga.

As far as I know the Lucasart games have not been freely released on the internet and therefore it is illegal to download them from some of the abandonware web sites available on the internet.
There are some web sites that still sell those games, and if you want to get hold of them just check the Lucasart web site.
One of the thing I love about this emulator is the possibility to run the games in window mode on the WB screen.
The graphics look really nice and neat (and the jag or the low resolution are hardly visible) and the games run smoothly.
Unfortunately on a my 1024x768 WB it all looks way too small.
My advise is to change the wb resolution to 640x512 and run the game in window mode to enjoy it to the full.
More information on SCUMM VM ports is available at

were all them are available free of charge.
Don`t worry if you have already played those Lucasart adventure games before. Playing them in the splendour of 256 colour is a completely different experience.
Also, taking in consideration that many of the latest Lucasart games (that made use of the SCUMM interpreter) were never available for our Amiga you can easily understand why this piece of software is one of the best gift to Amiga gamers.
Well done guys.
