Until OS4 comes out to update all that we've fallen behind, here is a
list of the fine pieces of shareware out there that will help out.
Many of you may already know of several of these titles, but they are
still the easiest ones I know to work with for what they do.  All are
available on aminet.

t1manager and ttfmanager will give you access to Postscript Type 1 and True Type
fonts respectively; they just plug them right into the existing
Intellifont system for no real overhead at all.{p}
For the most
efficient requester improvement MRQ is small, allows animations,
doesn't require quite as many things to configure to make look nice,
and works in more cases.{p}
If you want to get that PrtSc button on your
keypad working, there's a nice old util named PrtSc.{p}
Then finally, two utils PowerWB and PowrWindows are great for filling in all sorts
of window and screen related functions.{p}
I don't need to mention the plethora of datatypes out there that seem
able to fill in many a gap.  It's one of the better relics we have for
our use.

Just a few to keep you going until that release we're all waiting for.
