Wow.  A day before dealine and the new BoingBag comes out.  Will I get
it installed and tested in time for the new CD issue?  Well, if you're
reading this obviously so.  Installation was done on my A4000,
Cyberstorm 060 MkII, Cybervision64, 4X CDROM, and a boat-load of
memory.  As far as the Boingbag, just a small update of goodies, so in that
vein this review will be just a thumbnail of the highlights.  So...

The cachefont actually {italic}works{noitalic} this time; remembering
to include {italic}complete{noitalic} docs on it helps.  I was finally
able to turn off the fontcache option in MCP.

For the XAD library; there's a newer version out on Aminet then in
this archive.  There's a few other updates to some files, a few
datatypes, and the like, all just single files taken from the full
distribution (DefIcons, PlayCD, the IOTools guide but not the program,
etc.).
{pp}
The big change is in the AmigaOSRomUpdate.  The old version was about
128k in size, the new one is 325K in size.  This increase is due to
many changes in the exec library including such things as a bootscreen
useable without 15KHz monitors.  The drawback would be how buggy it
is.  After several softboots and a couple of cold boots, it still
reacted the same way: very beginning of startup (about at thge
setpatch po9int) it gets a recovrable guru (red on black screen, click
to continue), then another of the same, then continues on with the
boot.  Then after booting is finished it kept hitting VirusCheckerII
as a Cool Capture vector virus.  I went back to the old ROM patch and
all's fine.  Seeing as how this is the main focus of the distribution
having it not work is a major disappointment.

The Contributions file can almost be completely ignored.  It contains
Class Action which is very flawed (blank buttons, bad menu handling),
CDDB-lib (the demo crashes with a Deadend guru), and OpenURL (newer
version available on Aminet).
{pp}
Some nice things (the fontcache), but the bugs in the main portions of
it really bring it down.  I know it's free but basic testing should
have brought this out.
