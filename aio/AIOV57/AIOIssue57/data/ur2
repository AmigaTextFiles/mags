AmCEx which stands for Amiga Currency Exchange is as you may now
of guessed for the quick ones amongst a Currency Exchange program.
{pp}
It takes one currency and using the latest rates converts it into
whatever currency you choose. This is quite a useful program for
those who are sending money off to another country or who regularly
change money for travelling abroad etc.
{pp}
The simple and basic idea of this program is to enter a base
currency, pick what you wish it converted into, enter the amount,
hit a button and away you go.
{pp}
There is one slight flaw to this program, the fact that to keep it
updated you need to visit a website and download a html file which
if you ask me is a bit of messing if you want to keep this program
updated. A much better idea would be if the program could incorporate
some kind of auto-download feature.
{pp}
It is simple enough though, download the HTML file and put it in RAM,
the program will do the rest.
{pp}
If you have the time to download a HTML file then this program will be
fine for you.
{pp}
Its nice to have something like this on the workbench but it all depends
if you have the time and energy to download the "data" html file everytime
so that you can keep up to date. Unfortunately for me I would be more
likely to forget and be getting out of date conversions.
{pp}
If you need a simple currency application then this could well be what you
are after. For me I think I will stick to the very nice website,

Overall its a nice simple program. With a few updates like including
auto-downloading of the data file then this could infact be a very useful
program.
