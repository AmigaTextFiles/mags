very valuable members of the OS 4 development team, in fact so
valuable that Hyperion already entered into an 8 page OEM license
agreement with them on October 10, 2001.

- Permedia 2, Voodoo 3/4/5 and Matrox G450/G550 drivers;{p}
- cooperation in good faith with other OS 4 developers to produce a PPC native version of P96;{p}
- development of the OS 4 version to be kept in line with other versions for other licensees.
