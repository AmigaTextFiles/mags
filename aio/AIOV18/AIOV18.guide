 Welcome back to Amiga Information Online, the source of great Amiga
things to come. This month has been some what hectic with alot of things
going on. Firstly this issue was supposed to come out with the new super
GUI, specially programmed for AIO with WB friendly window and also
AHI support etc. Unfortunally there where some minor hitchs near the
deadline and it wasn't possible to bring you the GUI. It will be out
for next issue no doubt about that.

 This issue we have a host of great things in store. A full review of
Fortresses new racer game, MAX Rally is reviewed aswell as some
interesting articles and other bits and bobs. Recently AIO got some
good press in Amiga Format which was a nice supprise, you can read the
full review of it this issue in the articles section or in AF Dec 1998
pd.select section.

 One of the best things about issue 18 is we have 5... yes 5 competitions
for Christmas. Some great things are to be won and its all the latest
and newest goodies. Check out the competition section from the main
menu.

 Well thats all I have to say in this cold month of November, don't
forget to check out issue 19 which comes out 6 days before Christmas
on the 19th December. Will we see any great releases around Christmas
like we did with Doom last year? who knows.

@{fg shine} US-based PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX Registration Site@{fg text}

 As with 27 Oct 1998 PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX now is able to offer
registration for US and canadian citizens directly at an
US-based registration site, thanks to Jon Peterson.

 Registrations now can be directed as follows:


      (Rest of the World)       (USA, Canada)

 To:  Andreas R. Kleinert       Jon Peterson
      Sandstrasse 1             Attn: PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX
      D-57072 Siegen            PO Box 62472
      Germany                   San Angelo, TX 76906-2472


 Additionally, there's still our introductory offer for JPEG-Box
running:

 Starting with 5 October 1998, PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX offers a special
introductory freebie offer for their new tool "JPEG-Box" - limited
until 31 December 1998.

 JPEG-Box completes the current set of "WWW datatypes" (akJFIF and akPNG)
and WWW image creation programs (PNG-Box) by adding the missing
complementary tool for akJFIF datatype.

 With JPEG-Box you can easily convert any source graphics as supported
by datatypes or SuperView-Library into progressive or non-progressive
JPEG (JFIF) graphic files for use on the WWW or otherwise. Of course
with PPC support for faster image saving (in the registered version).

 Anyone who registers

    - anything from us via RegNet (see "RegNet-Offers" listing)
    - any of the available "discount" Shareware bundles from us
      (see "Discount" offers listing) for more than 25 DM

 until 31 December 1998, additionally will receive a free keyfile
 for JPEG-Box as well.

 Of course JPEG-Box can be registered solely as well, using the
included registration form.

@{fg shine} Vulcan Software - GOODBYE AMIGA CLASSIC!@{fg text}

Vulcan is finally closing the lid on Amiga (classic) software
development after half a decade of support! 

The decision to leave comes close to Vulcans 5th anniversary.

Paul Carrington states '..after much deliberation we switched off our
Amiga development systems at the mains, quickly wrapped them in brown
paper and hid them in the Vulcan vault! It's quite sad to see these
babies being turned off but it is something we all knew was inevitable
(and perhaps long overdue).'

Since 1994 Vulcan has Developed and Published 10 Amiga floppy titles and
5 Amiga CDRom titles and currently has 2 more Amiga CDRom titles still
in production and nearing release.

I hope that our departure from Amiga (classic) software development does
not receive the same insulting and slanderous response as previous
departing companies had experienced, but our decision is based purely on
a commercial and financial level due to the current state of the
existing Amiga market. 

To show our loyalty to the platform (which was responsible for 
our companies success) we will remain as an active Amiga Publisher as
long as there are external developers out there creating exciting
products and require our services and as long as our Amiga distributor
still has an outlet to sell limited quantities of Amiga titles.

Vulcan has just released a limited edition Amiga compilation CDRom of
it's MiniSeries titles as a tribute to it's golden days and we can still
expect the Alien adventure 'Wasted Dreams' Amiga CDRom to be released
before Xmas 98 with Explorer2260 Amiga PPC CDRom scheduled for early 99.

Live Long & Prosper!

@{fg shine} Village Tronic Survey at Computer '98@{fg text}

 After the development of the AriadneII ethernet card VillageTronic (one 
of the few remaining hardware companies for the zorro based AmigaClassic 
computersystems) is considering about the ongoing support and development
of new addon products for the graphics board PicassoIV.

 As far as there are no clear statements about the current amiga market we 
need to know how many people would show us support for the development of 
such a new product.  So we came to the conclusion to make a survey.

 Our aim is to develop an 8MB 3d-addon board with Voodoo chipset (3dfx).  
This card would need a ZorroIII based amiga system like A4K, A3K or A1200
with special ZorroIII extensions.  For us the point is that we need about 
500 preorders that show us that the product will be viable and we can pay 
our development costs.  Now the point is on you to fill out our survey 
that we can see if there will be enough pieces sold.

 You can join the survey by visiting VillageTronic at the computer`98
fair in cologne hall 11.2 , E32/F33.
You can also find a votesheet on our homepage

@{b}http://www.villagetronic.com/amiga/survey.html@{ub} or you just email us with
the title "SURVEY" at amigasupport@village.de

 Help the amiga market and you could see a modern and progressive product

@{fg shine} Gateway2000 takes pirates down@{fg text}

A popular web site famous for its distribution of Amiga ROMS, cracked
games and utilities has been forced to close its doors, according to a
message posted on the main page of the site. The following message now
adorns the site where lists of pirate downloads once occupied:

     "Gateway 2000, Inc. acting for Amiga Development LLC. demanded that
     this site be taken down immediately for posting and distributing
     illegally copyrighted software"

     "The site will remain suspended for the remaining of the
     investigation."

The site, known as "Lazarus", appears to no longer offer offending,
pirated software. According to some users who claim to have visited the
site in the past, the operators had once actually sold a collection of
select, Amiga-oriented, illegal software on CD.

The Lazarus site has never been listed in the Amiga Web Directory as it
is against the policy of CUCUG to list such links.

@{fg shine} explosiveCHAOS@{fg text}

 We all know what Bomerman is, well at least we should, you may
also know it as Dynablaster if you've played the Amiga version, but
on any other console/computer you'll know it as bomberman. The plot
is to blow things up trying to kill each other in the end but
explosiveCHAOS is slightly different to bomberman. The idea is to
blow up the enemys by helping each other, you can kill each other
but it isn't the plot of the game.

 You run along, drop a bomb, move out the way and it explodes leaving
something in pieces like a wall, bush or enemy if your doing it
correctly. Thats about it. The whole plot is to drop bombs by the
enemys and kill them. The graphics are simple but nice and are quite
well drawn for a PD game. 

 Unfortunally it isn't the full game but all the author asks is you
swap him something you made or send him a very small donation,
just over 5 AUS$ will get you the full version, thats about 2-3+
in pounds.

 Overall its a nice game to get, it won't last you to long as it
isn't that exciting, it'll be fun for a while with a mate but on your
own it'll be boring. Worth a look if you like this type of game and
it doesn't exactly break the bank to get the orginal so i'd say
go for it!

@{fg shine} Bang'Em@{fg text}

 Bang'Em is yet another workbench game, yes we've reviewed tons of
them and you've probably played millions before. The ideas of WB games
seem to be running out fast as there isn't alot you can do in a WB
screen. Anyway onto Bang'Em...

 Bang'Em is made by the author of TVAP (The Very Annoying Program)
which i'm sure I reviewed a few issues back. The main plot around
Bang'Em is to hit the little faces or circles that appear, you all
should know the games you get at fairs or in arcades where you have
a hammer and have to hit the little monsters that pop up before they
go down. Bang'Em is exactly the same but with-out the hammer of course,
otherwise you'd damage your amiga no doubt. 

 It is played on a 10*8 board split into squares, you have a set time
limit and the faces/circles pop up and down and you have to click on
them. As soon as you have clicked on them they jump to another
position and you gain some points, if you don't hit a face before it
jumps them you'll loose points, you will also loose points if you
miss the face and hit an empty square.

 The graphics aren't anything pretty but what really can you expect
from a WB game? there isn't any sound apart from the clicking of your
mouse button. The playability is ok and the lastability is good if
you do boring tasks on your computer all day.

 The game is novel and will probably be good if your constantly sitting
at your computer doing work or downloading, it is a good stress toy
although you may get angry when you start loosing points for missing
faces and that'll lead to launching your computer across the room but
if you need a workbench game this is worth a look.

@{fg shine} Race - Preview@{fg text}

 I received this game a few weeks ago, its a new racing game that is
being developed and is in its very early stages. From the demo I have
seen it's shaping up quite nicely. It doesn't as yet have a name so
the current name is just 'Race' the graphics are really nice and the
game is fast. The one major problem is the screen size is so small,
i've been told that this will stay the same in the full game which is
a shame because it is really to small.

 The game is sort of like Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo but with
sports cars. The view is out of window view and I don't currently
know if any other angle will be available to the full game.

 I can't actually say alot about it because the demo doesn't really
give to much away. All I do know is it plays well, it looks nice and
its fast enough to enjoy. Check the screenshot out for yourself and
you decide.

 MAX Rally comes on two disks with shiny labels, in its own C.D style
case. When you first open the case disk 1 will most proberly fall out,
because the case seems to be made for one disk, and not two!

 MAX Rally is a multi-player overhead racing game for all Amigas with at
least 2 Meg of memory. Up to four players can participate in various
types of race, against each other, against the clock or against
intelligent computer controlled cars?

 MAX Rally will install on your Hard Drive, but if you only have 2mb of
memory (Guess who?) you will have to load the game, by going through the
early startup controls and loading the program though DOS.

 After loading you are presented with a little introduction and you get
to see the 3D MAX Rally logo. It looks great, but its the game I'm
revewing here!

 There are various games you can play; a one-player (only) challenge,
where you have to win all of the 21 tracks, in 5 continues, but you can
get more continues by atempting the MAX Challenges; next is multi-player,
which lets you play 2 or 4 player battle mode, or a 2-player race (4
player with two Amiga's and a null-modem cable). Last up is Time Trials,
where you must race on your own, trying to beat previous records, or in
multi-player against the other players.

 There are 4 different terrains; Woodland Rally, Cosmic, Alpine, and the
Fortress Dunes. These can be played in any order on the challenge, and
you can race on any track in the multi-player and time-trials. It would
be good if you had some 'locked' tracks, which you can only get to after
winning so many other tracks. In my opinion this would make the game a
bit more exciting.

 The cosmic terrain is the most leaful, the other three terrains are
fairly bog-standard, nice graphics, but you have no freedom of movement,
you are boxed inside the track, you can not venture out to explore the
scenary. And what chance have you got in hitting the bounderies? Hardly
anything, because at either side of the track there is grass, or snow,
which slows you down, but on a track in the woodland rally you have to
go off the track, but you are still locked in! With Cosmic, for most of
the track you are locked in, but at some points, you can fall off!!
Arrgg! This is quite annoying, when you are participating in a MAX Rally
challenge you could fall off and you lose a continue, particually
annoying when you do a really bad jump, but never fear, becuase you can
cut jumps short by holding DOWN (in fearie).

 On the originally titled Track 2, of Cosmic, you may find computer cars
get stuck, well, they keep running into the track bounderies. Its lucky
its not real life, because their cars wouldn't be much good after such a
battering. However, if you do find a computer car hitting the walls
leave it alone, and it will stay there, and you have no fear of coming
last.

 The cosmic levels seem to dominate the game, there are 5 tracks, of
woodland, alpine, and dunes, but the desciption on the case says there
are 26 tracks. That means there are 11 cosmic tracks!!! The cars look
much better with cosmic, I can't describe why, they just are. I think
MAX Rally was only going to have cosmic tracks in its eary stage of
development, and the other terrains were added later?

 Back to the menu, there are some more options, you can customise the
drivers names, be cafeful though, because each driver is serpost to
have varying abilities, which are hard to spot, to say the least! You
can also view pre-recorded demos, which are impossible to copy. You can
change the difficultly level, it defaults to EASY, but put it on hard
and the cars will go super fast, but they will be harder to control.
Another problem with EASY, is the simple fact, it is easy, most of
the tracks can be completed first time, you need no skill what so
ever.

 Well, whats the game like? Its really good, the lap times and postition
text is sometimes distorted, but that doesn't interfere with the
gameplay. The screen scrolls very smoothly, and in HARD mode you can
really get some speed up, and thats what you really want from a top-down
racer. The different terrains have there own features, but they all have
big and small jumps, off which you can do a 360° spin in the air and
skid around corners with real speed, this is all fine, but in reality,
it is impossible to get right. Another amazing feature of the smaller
jumps, is that when you look at them the seem to point into the air
( / ), but in pratice, they are not, you can jump off them in any
direction!

 The only exciting 1 player mode is the challenge, you get 5 continues
and you must finish first on all of the tracks. The tracks are rated
using stars, 1 star is easy, and 5 stars is very difficult. If you want
more continues you can either lap everyone (quite simple on EASY mode) or
atempt a MAX Challenge, here you must complete three laps, without going
off the edge of the screen, and without falling off the side of the
track. There are various pads, placed around the tracks; moving pads,
which transport your car between different areas of the track; lap
pads; and switch pads. At the start of each lap, all switch pads are
switched on, that is, lit up. In order to complete a lap, they must all
be switched off, by driving over them. When this is done, a lap pad will
be lit up, and this must then be switched off to complete the lap. When
the lap pad is switched off, all switch pads are turned back on for
another lap. If a pad is missed, the lap has to be done again. Extra
continues are awarded for completing the entire track without missing a
pad. Set in the cosmic terrain (again) the screen scrolls independantly
of the main car, making the challenges impossible, even the 1 star
challenge is hard!

 What ever game mode you are doing, you always get one turbo per race,
it is pointless having one, it makes you go a little bit faster for a
few seconds! You can turn turbos off in the options. If you want?

 MAX Rally will let you save and load your record times, this would be a
good idea if to select the file you didn't have to use the Blitz Basic
requester (Yuk!) Another point, you can merge two sets of records
together, so you could battle it out with you friends for the world
record!

 The challenge is cool, the only annoying parts are when you have to
repeat all the tracks again, because you failed a MAX Challenge! And the
unchangable 12 laps are a pain in the back side! It would be better with
music, but the brilliant quality music won't load on my 2 meg A1200, but
it sounds good in OctaMED SoundStudio.

 And now some anoying things, you can only do each track once, in 2
player race, you get an anoying beat all the way through the race, but
despite these little things, the challenge is wonderful!?

 Another mode is multi-player, you can have up to 4 players racing at a
time, either with a two player joystick adaptor, where you are limited
to battle mode (in 4 player), or by using a null-modem cable and two
Amiga's running MAX Rally at the same time.

 Two player race is great, but it doesn't compare to the battle mode,
where you have to race against each other on a single screen. The
idea of this race is to get your car to the front of the screen, while
the screen is scrolling round following all the cars. Falling off the
back of the screen results in your car being taken off the track until
someone else has won a point. Points are gained by staying on the screen
until all other cars have been eliminated. The winner of the race is the
first player to gain five points. This is really fun, you are competing
with your friends, and not your computer. Its really competitive, but
its really boring if your the first person to be taken off the track.
Doesn't this remind you of Micro Machines?

 Battle mode is much better than the multi-player time-trials, for a start
you have your own controller (in time-trials you have to share). Its fun
racing against each other, atempting to get the best time is boring!

 Throughout my intence testing I did discover some vital bugs, if you
fall off on a cosmic time-trial, you start again from where you left
off. Fine, but the clock stops, you don't complete laps as far as the
computer is concenered, and you'll most proberly get a new lap record!

 Overall MAX Rally is really fun to play, its quite addictive at first,
but its lastability lets it down in the long run. A good effot, I want
to see more of this around.

@{fg shine} NIM, Simple sticks game@{fg text}

 Nim is serposidly a old game invented by the Japanese, basically there
is a pile of matchsticks, and 2 players. Each player takes turns in taking
an amount of matchsticks, and the player who removes the last matchstick
is the loser. In this game one player is human, the other is the computer.

 The game runs in the shell, which may seem a little disapointing at
first, but the game would run to better in it's own window. Anyway, the
game is one of the authors early C++ assignments!

 The game is the simplest thing ever, if the Japanese version wasn't
based on matchsticks kids would be playing this the world over! Maybe
not?

 First of all you enter how many matchsticks you want to start with,
then you enter the maxium number to be taken per go, for example,
entering 100 and 50 would give a reasonable game. Now decide who is to go
first, the computer, or the human, and then you take it in turns to take
as many matchsticks as you want (not acceeding the limit of course).

 It seems to me that the computer has the ability to take 0 matchsticks,
but you have to take at least 1. Ummmm!? I also think the limit on the
amount of matchsticks you can have is 2147483646, it is anoying when you
put in more than that, because the computer excepts the higher number,
and when you set the limit to anything greater than 2147483646 the
computer leaves you with one matchstick. Gutted!

 If you get bored with the game, you can't just close the shell, you
have to finish the game, this is very anoying, especially when you have
230717627 matchsticks left.

 In the end, this is simple, and great to amuse the kids (or big kids)
for a short time (before it's time for tea, or sommit). It would be nice
if there was a two player game as well, it could even be in its own
window or screen?

@{fg shine} WiZiO@{fg text}

 This is what the author discribes as a platform romp where you collect
coins, stars and special spells in a full screen scrolling world. Rather
like the Nintendo Classic Mario! But Mario is getting on now, he's even
in  3D, but what about his clones? 2D I'm afraid.

 Apon loading, you get a horribly pixelized screen, it looks like a part
of the in-game graphics has been enlarged, with a horrible output.

 Press FIRE, and after a while the ugly title screen fades to black, and
the scrolling world appears. The graphics are simple, but effective,
they serve their perpose well, they are not too fancy, and not too
dull.

 The gameplay is superb, this simple platformer is quality P.D, it's no
wonder it won the AF Reader Games a while back! One key to the brilliant
gameplay could be the dungeons, just look for a door and use any keys
you have picked up to open the door to be able to collect loads of
bonus', and when the door is open you can go in as many times as you
want, but you don't get any extra bonus'.

 Its hard to explain the quality of gameplay here, its too simple, but
its good. I surpose its one of those addictive games which have a real
simple idea behind them. Although, this is not an original game, its one
of the best P.D versions I've seen, of this type for a while.

 The trouble is, when you die, the enemies in the screen around you
disappear, but if you go away and come back, they come back as well!
Little bug there?

 I think what makes the game so addicive and playable, is the fact that
it is hard, after a few atempts it may be easy to get to level 2, but
after that it gets difficult, and you keep falling off the screen and
having to do level 1 again, which, after a while gets a bit tedious!

 I really like this one, call me sad, but I think its simplistic game
play makes it really good, but with 4 levels, and the authors lack of
support it may not become VERY good.

@{fg shine} Revenge AGA@{fg text}

 I while ago now I reviewed T.V Chubbies in Armchair Assassin. It got
71%, it was a great game, and the author of that has come back with
another blast to bits games: Revenge AGA (Armchair Assassin 2).

 There are loads of new features, these were just ripped from the docs:

   * 50% more victims on screen (up to 60 at once)
   * Victim Generator included (design your own victims!)
   * 8 victim slots (was 4)
   * 10 vicious weapons available (was 3)
   * All weapons can be selected at will during play
   * Victims can now be injured as well as killed
   * Victims interact with each other
   * 8 backgrounds (was 1)
   * 5 speeds (was 3)
   * Loads of blood (and mud and bones)
   * 2 game modes (Maximum Mayhem and Sequential Slaughter)
   * All game options can be edited and saved
   * New fun time mode after all the victims are dead
   * Your own music mods can be used in the game
   * Games in progress can be ended with the "Q" key
   * Heads that "watch the action"

 You can have loads of 'victims' running around the senery, which is
made up of 4 screens. You can choose between 8 backgrounds, to suit your
needs, and there is loads of blood!

 In T.V Chubbies there was only 3 weapons, and you had to select one of
them, and play the whole level with that single weapon, now you have 10
weapons at your disposal. Here follows a list of what they all are:

F1  - SHOTGUN
  > Front firing
  > Instant hit
  > Good blast area

F2  - ARNIE-GUN
  > Front firing
  > Instant hit
  > Rapid fire rate

F3  - PHOTON TORPEDO
  > Top firing
  > Smart weapon
  > Boldly kills where no weapon has killed before

F4  - PULSE LASER
  > Front firing
  > Smart weapon
  > Good fire rate

F5  - NIGHT SCOPE
  > Front firing
  > Instant hit
  > Hunt victims at night

F6  - BFB 9000
  > Top firing
  > Smart weapon
  > Large blast area

F7  - ELECTRIC SHOCK TREATMENT
  > Top firing
  > Smart weapon
  > Frying tonight

F8  - ALIEN DNA EXPERIMENT
  > Top firing
  > Smart weapon
  > Special weapon

F9  - FIREBALL
  > Top firing
  > Smart weapon
  > Special weapon

F10 - AIR STRIKE
  > Top firing
  > Smart weapon
  > Special weapon

 Each weapon is either top firing or front firing. Front firing weapons
should be aimed anywhere on (or near) the selected victim. Top firing
weapons should be aimed at (or near to) the feet of the selected victim.

 There is so much to the game, it is hard to discribe it all here, its
so cool. You can even make your own 'victims', and the Aminet seems to
be getting a huge collect at the moment.

 I like this one, there are loads of options, the graphics depend on the
artist, and the sounds are simple brilliant, especially the South Park
ones I donwloaded off the Aminet!

@{fg shine} Games reviews and what there score means@{fg text}

 Games are reviewed mostly on playability and how long they will last
you, although some big games with fancy graphics might be expected to
get good reviews it is not always the case. A small 10k game might
get a better overall score than a 1Mb game. It is not that the 1Mb
game isn't any good it's just that the playablility might be non
exsistant and there is no point in downloading a huge file if it
will last a couple of minutes and you will only run it to show off
to friends.

 90%+    -  AIO GOLD (amazing)

 70-89%  -  Nice but some let downs

 50-69%  -  Not to good but it'll do

 30-49%  -  Hasn't really been thought out to well

DEMO VERSION

 There is a demo version of version 6 available from Consultron's web
 page. It is a read-only demo.

COPY PROTECTION

 None

SOFTWARE INSTALLATION  
 
 The software comes on one floppy disk.
   
 An 'Install' program is provided to install the software onto your Hard 
 disk (300K) or onto floppy disk (50k). It is possible to run the software
 from a working copy of the CrossDos disk by double-clicking the PC0 icon.

REVIEW

 Crossdos has been provided in a limited form since Workbench 2.1, that
 version allowed Amiga users to read/write MS-DOS disks via the PC0, PC1
 etc. DosDrivers. It also provided the CrossDos commodity program which
 allows you to filter out extra characters from text files copied from
 MS-DOS disks and some Text Translation.
 
   Since then Microsoft has released Windows 95 which extended the MS-DOS
 filenames from the 8.3 (11 character) format to 256 character filenames.
 The Amiga can read upto 30 character filenames. CrossDos 7 now allows you
 to read/write 30 character filenames onto MS-DOS disks (longer filenames
 are not recommended as some programs may not work correctly). Volume 
 names are still limited to 11 characters long.

   I had the Workbench version of CrossDos since I bought my Amiga 1200 and
 used it often when copying files to/from work especially from Aminet or
 converting Word files into RTF or Wordperfect format for use on WordWorth
 at home. The short fileformat wasn't much of a problem but now that long
 filenames are pretty common, it was getting to be a pain having to use
 them.

   Consultron had only recently updated their web page and CrossDos 7 was
 advertised with Windows 95 filename support and at only $40 was a bargain!
 I immediately, posted a letter with my Mastercard details for it.

 A coupe of weeks later it arrived in the post. Crossdos was supplied on a
 floppy disk with a nice blue/gold manual (46 pages). I made a copy of the
 disk for backup purposes and installed the software via the Install program
 onto the Workbench partition of my hard disk.

 The software includes four DosDrivers (PC0-PC4), a CrossDos commodity 
 program a QuickPrep program, a DiskChg program and new versions of Format, 
 Diskcopy and Mount programs (v40) and the CrossDosFileSystem.
   
   The new drivers have been working faultlessly since day one although
 MCP caused read errors with the Trackdisk option enabled (it is now 
 disabled). I saved some files with Windows 95 onto a floppy disk and took
 it home and lo and behold the disk displayed the filenames at full length.
 It also works with the normal 8.3 files as well.

   According to the manual, you should keep Windows 95 filenames under 30
 characters long as that is the limit for Amiga OS. I have never used 
 really long filenames so that really isn't an issue but will be if saving
 from a Win 95 machine.

   I am now using it as normal and I don't have to remember to reduce it
 down to the awful 8.3 format anymore. Windows 3.x machines will probably
 just see the truncated file format. Well worth the money.

DOCUMENTATION

 The manual comes with CrossDos is 46 pages long and comes in a nice blue
 /gold cover. There are still references to long gone products such as
 Wordperfect, Final Copy, ADPro etc but includes new products such
 as Syjet, Zip, Jaz etc.
There is an example mountlist on p26 but didn't come out quite right
 with some characters overlapping others. I hope Consultron can fix this.
There is a useful 8 page trouble shooting guide for problems with
 CrossDos.

SUPPORT/WARRANTY

 Consultron has a Technical Support line during the day (US time) and
 registration is possible via Email or Snailmail. They used to have a
 BBS but this is replaced by their updated web page at:

 http://www.cucug.org/consultron/

BUGS

 No bugs have been found as yet. The latest update is available to
 upgrade to 7.02 on their web page.

GOOD POINTS

 Easy to install and completely transparent to the user. Plenty of
 useful utilities to go with it. The ConfigDisk will be useful for
 other removable drives as Mountlists can be automatically created.
 QuickPrep is useful to format MS-DOS partitions.

DISLIKES

 I would have like to seen a DiskSalv type utility to fix Read/Write
 errors. MS DOS 6 has Scandisk, although Norton Utilities on the PC
 is excellent on finding a fixing common disk problems and mapping out
 bad blocks.
   The disk uses horrible standard four colour icons which are awful.
 A combination of MWB or NewIcons would have been nice for a 90s
 product.

CONCLUSIONS

 Worthwhile having if you use PCs and Amigas to transfer files on a 
 regular basis esp. if you have access to Win 5 machines otherwise
 the normal CrossDos on WB would suffice for the rest of us.

@{fg shine} AsciiCodes 1.1@{fg text}

  This tiny program is very simple; it will show you the ASCII code for a
character you enter, or vice versa. So it's quite big (almost 40kB) but that's
because of the background picture that the window has :)

  The good sides: it does the job, and it looks nice. The bad sides: you can't
browse the list of codes/characters, and it acts on keypresses even if its
own window is not active (well, what can you expect from a 99% Blitz Basic
program :).

@node "ur3" "Clipboard History"

@{fg shine} ClipHistory v2.4@{fg text}

  Do you have one of these? I didn't. I had realised that I needed a clipboard
history utility about a month before actually getting around to downloading
one :) But now I regret that I waited so long, because this is such a great
program that I couldn't live without it any more :) For example when I read an
URL somewhere and I want to visit it but can't just yet, I don't have to
scribble it on some piece of paper; I'll just copy it to the clipboard and
when the time comes I'll select it from the history window and paste it to my
browser.

  I can't recall if I picked this one at random or if it was the newest clip
history program in Aminet, but since it has all the functionality that I can
ever need, I haven't bothered to test other programs :) Examples of the
useful features: it has an ARexx port with about 40 commands, you can freely
define the hotkeys for the "blind" selection of the next/previous clip
(without the window popping up), it can open even on non-public screens, it
can close the window after selecting a clip entry, you can choose the clip
with one or two clicks, you can set the maximum number of clips held in
memory, it can reject too big or small clips (especially useful for PowerSnap
users), it can check if the new clip is a copy of the latest (or any) entry in
memory and not store it twice, you can filter out (or in) any IFF types and of
course save any clip to a file.

  ClipHistory has an installer script, so the most tedious part of installing
is that you have to configure all the options :) But when you're done you'll
see that it was worth the time and effort, because it will behave exactly as
you wanted it to and using it will be swift and easy.

  ClipHistory requires only AmigaOS 2.04, but it will utilise OS 3.0 features
and ReqTools. It is also completely system friendly and won't patch any
library functions (unless you want it to open on non-public screens). What can
I say, it's just amazing! :)

@node "ur4" "Day Utils"

@{fg shine} DayCopy, DayDelete, DayList, DayMove@{fg text}

  These utilities are for copying, deleting, listing and moving files that are
older or younger than the given number of days. At least for me they are quite
useful, since I always have loads of files in my downloads drawer (currently
almost 450 :). Especially DayList will come in handy, since I often need to
see the files downloaded today or 3 days ago or something like that. The
standard "list" command has the "since" parameter but it only accepts "today",
"yesterday" and dd-mmm-yy, and I don't have time to think what day it was 3
days ago ;)

  All the 4 commands have a similar command template: number of days, source
dir, destination dir (for copy and move), "older" switch (affect files older
than the given number of days), "quiet" switch and "all" switch (recurse into
subdirectories).

  So, for example when I want to see the files downloaded in the past 4 days,
I'll write: "daylist 4 work:downloads", or to delete files older than 30 days:
"daydelete 30 work:downloads older".

  Unfortunately the author hasn't thought about the template too carefully;
the number of days isn't required but the source dir is. So if I want to list
some files in the current directory, I'll have to write:  daylist 3 ""
That's one big con, and another is that it outputs only one filename per line,
so if it finds 50 files for example, it will output 50 (plus a few) lines
instead of them all fitting very nicely in even a small Shell window as the
"ls" command would list them...

@node "ur5" "Image Engineer"

@{fg shine} Image Engineer v3.41@{fg text}

  This image processing utility was a positive surprise to me. After
downloading both the LHA archives (just a bit over 1 MB total) I realised that
it needs the SuperView package. And I had deleted it just a few weeks ago
(there's a quick review for you ;), so back to downloading again. Then I
installed them both and launched Image Engineer with no clear idea of what to
expect...

  After about 15 seconds of loading I had a pretty clear image in my mind.
Another 15 and it finally did something visible and let me choose the screen
mode (yes, this *is* a slow machine but I would've expected no more than 15
seconds.. :). IE uses BGUI so the GUI isn't too beautiful, but it works and
all the windows are resizable so it'll do. IE requires at least a 640*400
screenmode and you can choose any number of colours for it. After selecting,
it opened the screen and displayed the shareware requester (unregistered will
only handle images up to 400*400 pixels in size, 35 USD to register). Then I
only had to adjust a few settings and I was ready to start using it.

  I noticed quickly that all the image processing in IE is *very* fast, and
that's because 98% of it is coded in 68020 optimized assembler. Too bad that
this means that 040, 060 and PPC support would be really difficult to add
(at least I think so :). All the image processing modules have stamp-size
preview boxes (either a selectable part of the image or the whole image
scaled down) and they update very fast too when you're adjusting the various
sliders and gadgets. IE is also quite memory efficient, which is hard not to
notice on this low-mem machine of mine :)

  IE has CyberGraphX support as well as native Amiga modes (including the
HAM6 and HAM8 modes, but not for the preview ("edit") screen). It can process
images in 24 bit color or 8 bit grayscale, and it supports all the image
formats that SuperView supports for loading and saving (yes, including JPEG,
PNG and GIF :). You can have multiple images open at the same time and also
re-calculate the best palette for the preview screen to show the opened images
in more "useful" colors. It's just too bad you can't get the default palette
back; if you have a mostly blue image and the palette optimized for it, and
you change its hue to green it won't appear to change much in the thumbnail
preview because all the colors will be shades of blue... You can also zoom
in/out on the preview windows.

  IE has around 40 image processing modules and more to be released in the
future. Here are some of the palette balancing modules: brightness, gamma,
hue, threshold, contrast, negative and saturation, and some filters: median,
highboost, highpass, lowpass, sharpen and convolve (with loads of matrixes,
that can also be transferred to/from PPaint for example). And then there are
the modules that "really" change the image (all of them have "color average"
options): bulge, twirl, ripple, remove feature (collapse), scale and rotate.
And the motion/rotate/zoom blurs make nice effects too...

  Of course, IE has an ARexx interface with many effects scripts supplied.
It has fully configurable menus, with definable keyboard shortcuts too. You
can render images using your own palette, or have it generate the best
possible palette for you (you can also set the number of colors to be used,
and it has several error diffusion algorithms, e.g. Floyd-Steinberg.

  I can't find many bad things to say about IE; the startup-time is long but
it's just because it's loading all the SuperView files (if you quit it and
restart without a memory flush in between, it'll be a lot faster). Then
there's one bug that can sometimes be very bothering; you can't abort loading
an image, even when there's an abort gadget... but at least I didn't encounter
any other bugs! Let's give the author Simon Edwards applause for that :)

@node "ur6" "YAM Pre 6"

@{fg shine} YAM v2.0 preview 6@{fg text}

  Version 2.0 of the freeware email program YAM is at beta stage currently,
but anyone can download the preview version from the YAM web site. It is a
huge step forward from the latest non-beta version v1.3.5, especially the
user interface. And although it is a preview, it still has more working and
useful features than v1.3.x (and most features do work :)

  Installation is really easy with the installer script and configuration is
very straightforward too. The GUI is very practical; in the main window you
have a list of folders and a list of messages, and a toolbar that lets you
handle your mail (read, write, delete etc.), send and receive mail and do
searches. When writing a message, it's really easy to add/remove file
attachments and to adjust various options for that particular mail, including
the From: field that used to be so difficult to change. The GUI can be
modified flexibly, and the most important part: it's multithreaded, so while
you are writing a message you can also read messages and adjust the settings,
for example (don't you just hate the "wait" mouse pointer ;)

  At start YAM has 4 folders; incoming, outgoing, sent and deleted. It's very
easy to add folders, and adding filters for automatic actions towards the
downloaded messages (e.g. move to a folder) shouldn't be too hard after
reading that section of the guide. The 'deleted' folder is very handy since
messages aren't really deleted instantly after clicking delete (which might
have been an accident) but moved into this folder.

  YAM has various other little features that make it very nice to use. The
address book has a birthday field; YAM can check on every startup if it's
somebody's birthday and remind you about it :) Almost every window has a
toolbar. You can drag & drop messages between folders, and add attachments to
messages by dragging files from Workbench. You can configure it to download
messages automatically at set intervals, and it can automatically strip the
signature when replying to a message. It supports multi-line taglines and
address aliases too (send to 'jack' for example -> turns into Jack's email
address automagically), just to scratch the surface :)

  So what's bad about it? Well, at least it seems to hog a big part of my
measily 8 MB fastmem, and I honestly can't see what it needs it for :) Then
there are a couple of minor bugs; you can't close any windows while
downloading messages, and there's something wrong with aborting the message
download... if you click Abort, it thinks that you don't want that particular
mail and deletes it from the server; with luck you might get a "message stub"
in your incoming folder but it might be a lot smaller than what you had
downloaded so far...

  YAM's bugs are few and insignificant, while it has a lot of features and is
very nice in use... and it's FREE! :) To me this preview was a bit of a let-
down as an upgrade from the previous preview, but at least it's still
evolving! :) I'll remain eagerly awaiting the next preview.. :)

 Utils are not marked on how good they are compared to other utils,
they are marked by usefulness and what purpose they serve. As there
are so many different utils that do so many different things it is
hard to review something like MUI and then when reviewing a program
like a WB clock say it wasn't up to the standard of MUI. This is why
it is not possible to have a Top Ten list for utils.

@node "fe1" "Interview"

@{fg shine} Interview with Oliver Kastl@{fg text}

 This month we had a chat with Oliver Kastl, the man behind IDEFix,
he also runs his own company called Elaborate Bytes. Anyone else
you'd like to see interviewed? email us at @{b}amiga@thefree.net@{ub} and let
us know.

CS : As with all AIO interviews can you firstly tell us who you are and
a little bit about yourself?

OK : Sure. My full name is Oliver Kastl, I was born in Essen (Ruhr-Area), 
Germany. I am pretty old (34, to be precise) and I am in the Amiga 
business since 1986 - phew, this is 12 years! I currently live in a small 
village near Munich together with my wife Frauke and my daughter Lara. 
Beside of my activities as an active Amiga Developer and running Elaborate 
Bytes, I am a father (a very demanding job and my favourite hobby!) and 
work part time as a senior design engineer for a company called Optimay 
GmbH, a subsidiary of Lucent technologies. This is necessary, as Amiga 
development no longer earns enough to pay the bills :-)

CS : How does it feel when you know you have brought CD-rom joy to
many Amiga users around the world?

OK : Great! It is nice to do something useful and make people happy - and earn 
money with it, too. And I didn't only brought CD-Rom joy to a lot of 
people, but Harddisk joy, too. Probably some of you remember the A.L.F. 
hand Oktagon series of Harddisk controllers?

CS : What is it like being instantly recognised when you go places?
for instance on the AIO JUST-AMiGA mailing list someone noticed you
and titled you 'Mr. IDEfix himself'.

OK : Unless the person immediately asks "why does CD-Rom XYZ not work with 
IDE-fix" it makes me feel proud :-) Some years ago when I went to an Amiga 
fair, someone approached me, gave me his hand and said: "I just want to 
hold your hand". Weird, but fun :-)

CS : How did you come up with the idea for IDEfix? and was there anyone
in particular that without, IDEfix could not of happend?

OK : The idea for IDE-fix was the same idea I had with the original ALF ST-506 
controllers: With little hardware and a lot of clever software connecting 
cheap mass storage devices from the PC world to the Amiga. Back in 1986 
there already were SCSI Harddisks for the Amiga, but A.L.F. was the major 
breakthrough, because it allowed to use cheap ST-506 harddisks. The same 
idea was used on the TandemCD and CD1200 controllers, which could use 
cheap Mitsumi CD-Roms. Later, when ATAPI CD-Roms replaced the Mitsumi 
drives, the CD1200+, AlfaPower+, IDE-fix and the Buddha controllers were 
the logical next step.
Andreas Selle (who has written the drivers for the MFC multi I/O cards, 
btw) and Volker Klein (who developed the Oktagon 2008 and Memory Master 
hardware) helped me in the very beginning writing C and efficient 68k 
assembler code. Well, actually they teached me good programming :-)
The CacheCDFS FileSystem which was developed for all my CD-Rom products 
wouldn't be possible without Ralph Babel's Amiga Guru book. Well done, 
Ralph!

CS : What is your happiest Amiga memory so far of 1998?

OK : There were quite some nice memories, but these are rather personal and not 
of public interest, like the contact to other developers. I am pretty 
excited about the announcements Amiga, Inc. has made, like the Amiga 
NextGen or the OS3.5. I don't know if they will succeed, let's wait and 
see.

CS : What do you think was the best year for you on the Amiga and why?

OK : The best years were way back in 1986 - 1990. The Amiga was "the" magic 
machine, with capabilities other computers didn't have. The games were 
outstanding! There were Developer conferences, the machine and technology 
was new, all this was very exciting! I founded Elaborate Bytes as a 
start-up company, which was the basis for all I've done yet.
The greatest moment was when I met Jay G. "Father of the Amiga - Padre" 
Miner who I had the luck to talk to on a Developer's conference in Paris. 
I can't remember what year it was. I had an ALF-II SCSI controller with me 
and a copy of my program "The Jay Miner Connection", which was never 
released to the public, so it could be around 1989. "The Jay Miner 
Connection" was a program and a little cable to connect an 8-Bit ATARI 
(400/800/...) to the Amiga - connecting two of Jay's great machines. I 
asked him for permission to use his name and he agreed. And he told me 
some really funny stories...
He invited me to his home whenever I pass by, but I didn't made it. Sigh.


CS : Why did you choose the Amiga as your computer of choice?

OK : Before I bought an Amiga long, long time ago, I had a Sinclair Spectrum, 
a Sinclair QL and an Atari 800. Then there was the Amiga, and it simply blew 
away the competition. A must have! A computer fun to use and fun to 
develop for, and the Amiga just came like a present from heaven. It only 
lacked a harddisk, so I started developing A.L.F. The rest is history....


CS : What would you like to see happen to the Amiga in the future?

OK : I want to see the plans of Amiga, Inc. become reality. And I wish they 
are  successful. This is tough, so good luck. The Amiga has a difficult 
position nowadays, as it no longer "blows away the competition". There are 
PCs with great games, consoles like N64, Playstation, Saturn, Dreamcast, 
etc., Macs, Linux, BeOS. The current "classic" Amiga can't compete with 
those systems, and the PowerPC Amiga still lacks software and the PPC 
integration into the OS is miles away from Apple's Mac. And Apple isn't 
sleeping, the new MacOS 10 and even the BeOS look very promising. Even 
Microsoft has learned, and Win98 and WinNT aren't as bad as most people 
say. WinCE tries to conquer the embedded market, a market Amiga, Inc. is 
aiming at, too.
So, Amiga, Inc. has a lot of homework to do. They need to integrate all 
those gimmicks the others have into the new OS. All those 3rd party 
enhancements (like IDE-fix) shouldn't be no longer necessary. This might 
hurt me as a developer, but as a user, I would be happy!
I really hope Amiga, Inc. manage to make it in time, as the development of 
a new OS from scratch is a VERY demanding task. I don't know if they will, 
as even companies with high budgets for software development like Apple, 
Be or Microsoft need several years for development a brand new OS.

CS : What specs would you like to see the new Amigas have?

OK : I can't tell you, but it must be as outstanding as the A1000 was 12 years 
ago. Otherwise it wouldn't be the "magic" machine I would call an Amiga, 
but just another PC/Mac/BeBox. It should be something "completely 
different" and "outstanding" again. Probably with a new concept of User 
Interface? Something radically new and different, so people will jump on 
the new Amiga. If I only knew, what this could be, I would be a rich man! 
:-)
I personally would like to see an OS which is fun to program for, but this 
doesn't make sense, if the machine doesn't attract a wide user base. I 
want a machine with graphic and 3D capabilities that "blow your mind away" 
and with a DSP for real-time Audio processing. I would expect that the raw 
CPU and FPU horsepower is satisfying anyway :-)

CS : What do you think is a good point about the Amiga community and
the people in it on a whole and a bad point about us?

OK : The good point: They are fanatics.
The bad point: They are fanatics.
Sometime I have the feeling Amiga is no longer a computer but a religion 
:-)
On the other hand, it is amazing how the Amiga people unite and defend 
their platform and the people developing for it. I have never seen a "anti 
piracy - help the developers" campaign coming from the user base on any 
other platform. This could be worth a sociological study - who are these 
people? why are they doing this? - but this is another story.

CS : Do you think you have received the feedback and payment you
expected for making such a big project as IDEfix?

OK : Yes, I think so. IDE-fix was designed modular, so the code basis could 
be  put in several products like the Individual Computer's Buddha and 
Catweasel, Eyetech's EZ-IDE, Vesalia's WinnerCD or the Telmex EasyCD. What 
nobody knows - a cut down version of CacheCDFS was shipped with Amiga 
Technologies' Q-Drive before Escom went bankrupt...
But remember - parts of IDE-fix are very old! E.g., CacheCDFS was 
developed back in 1993 for the TandemCD and was constantly improved. The 
latest addition was Win95/98 long filename support (Joliet).
Developing a product like IDE-fix now from scratch would not be possible 
(if you expect to get your investment back).
The shareware sales of IDE-fix '97 could definitely be much higher, even 
with this nasty "nag" requester.
BTW, the nag requester was unfortunately unavoidable. Probably you know my 
program BootControl? It allowed the use of VGA-only monitors with Amigas, 
even the BootMenu, an interrupted startup-sequence or Guru Meditations 
were visible. It offered some other features, too and a well documented 
API for programmers. It was an experiment - "real" shareware - uncrippled, 
no nag requesters, fully functional. I received ZERO registrations. Not 
even a single one. Only some enhancement requests :-) The experiment 
failed, I would say.
To summarise, yes, IDE-fix was a successful product, but now - after 
Amiga, Inc. announced their plans on the WOA - sales dropped nearly to 
zero, what I can fully understand. I don't know how long I can justify 
further improvement of the IDE-fix product line, as this takes time which 
can be invested in more commercially interesting projects.
The feedback I get back from the users is usually very positive. This 
makes me happy and is a great motivation to continue to support IDE-fix as 
long as possible and as long as required.

CS : Is there anything you would like to say to the Amiga community?

OK : Yes! I want to say "thank you" for supporting the Amiga over all these 
years. You have given me a lot of support and it was and still is a 
pleasure developing products for you! And I hope we will see us again on 
the "Amiga - the next Generation" which will hopefully bring back the 
"Magic" to the Miggy.

CS : Thankyou for your time!

OK : You're welcome!

@{fg shine} The joys of memory@{fg text}

 This is a short article to explain the joys of purchasing more memory 
for your Amiga. The benefits and troubles that you may encounter on 
your travels into the unknown, ahem.. on with the article.

 Up until about 2 months ago I had 8mb of memory which I purchased with 
my Blizzard 030 board in about January 1998. That was a step up as until 
then I only had 4mb, what a saviour having 8mb was... well at least 
until I did web browsing seriously. 8mb was enough but when you want to 
use a web browser the cache can build up quite quickly leaving you one 
of two options, you could either keep emptying it wasting time or buy 
more memory. Emptying the cache is a rather sneaky way of saving 
yourself some cash but it not always the best solution. There is the 
benefit of saving money but are you really saving money when you have 
to stop to delete all the pictures and html code that has built up, 
this takes time and phone bills are still running while you do this. 
Ok, its not so much time but just clearing your cache doesn't solve all 
the problems and you don't get all your memory back so after a while you 
find your computer will be run down and out of memory, windows will 
open slowly and the drawing will seem stupid, you carry on scraping for 
some more memory until your computer fails and gurus out, click, your 
modem goes offline and you have to login again.

 Maybe for alot of you that isn't so much trouble but just think if you 
had that little extra memory you could do many more things. I was in 
this situation and it was time to upgrade, out came the slightly empty 
wallet and then came the credit card ;) ah the wonders of today, eh?

 Looking through the main print magazines like Amiga Format and the late 
CU Amiga I decided that 32mb was the size that I required. I looked around
for the cheapest company and found that Blittersoft was going to inherit
my memory upgrade money, I hadn't had any experience with Blittersoft 
before so it was a wait and see affair. Eyetech would have been my choice 
for there excellent service but they where quite a bit more expensive and 
cash is not always rolling around the AIO nerve centre. I phoned up  
Blittersoft to place my order and got that 'happy' feeling you get when 
you spend some of that money you work so hard for, or in this case the 
money you pay off your credit card with ;)

 1 week went by and no simm which was to be expected.... then 2 weeks. By 
then I decided to give Blittersoft a ring to see where the simm had got 
to and got the usual reply that it was all ready to go and would be with 
me tomorow, well I waited and waited, another call to Blittersoft got me 
the same response so I waited some more, 3 weeks after I had placed the 
order it appeared. A little unhappy with Blittersoft I was glad to finally 
get my simm, making a mental note to pay the extra and use Eyetech who do 
get you things on time I rushed up stairs to get the memory in, it was a 
simple job of just clipping the simm into the correct place and that was 
it, I now had the power at my fingertips.

 On went the computer displaying lots of lovely memory. Great! web browsing 
that didn't crash, can keep the cache without deleting all the files so I 
can browse my favorite pages while offline and overall the computer is 
slightly faster, not much but there is some small speed increase and now 
I can have AmIRC, AWeb, AmiFTP, Yam plus a host of other programs including 
Dopus, A few IRC bots running for certain people on a host of IRC channels 
and I can now host at least 60+ people when I run my experimental irc 
server, considering it'd be a push to run AmIRC, Yam and a web browser 
with 8mb I am totally happy with my purchase.

 Overall I recommend that everyone gets extra memory and slaps it into their 
amigas, it opens a whole new world, ok my computer system isn't a real
power beast but add 32mb and you can do many things you never dreamed of 
doing before. I say make the upgrade, 16mb you may get by with but 32mb 
is really what I would say go for, you could have 32mb for around £40 and 
that includes p&p.

 Note : If you haven't upgraded your computer processor and still have the
standard that came with it you have to buy a ram board aswell as the simm
so that can boost the price by a big margin, If this is your situation
I suggest buying an 030 with 32mb on it, it will cost you pretty much the
same price and your computer will be super fast compared to your old
processor.

@{fg shine} Dr. Strange, Web Wanderer@{fg text}

 Well, here we are another month later, and here I am with another five 
sites. An ecclectic assortment this time, from the useful to the just
plain strange. There should be something for everyone here so let's get
started.

Uncommonly Difficult I.Q. tests
@{b}http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch@{ub}

So, you think you're hot stuff mentally, eh?  Well, here's the place to
proove it. Information on all the world's hardest I.Q. tests are given
here, from the Mega Test that appeared in Omni Magazine over a decade ago,
to the Ultra Test. And if you really are smart, then you might make use of
the rather estensive list of high I.Q. societies, from the well-known Mensa
(98th percentile or better), to the Giga Society (for the 99.9999999th
percentile!). Now that's smart!

Python On Line
@{b}http://www.pythonline.com@{ub}

The official site put out by that bizzarely funny Monty Python troop. Is
it just a fan site? Well, er, it's definitely Python-ess, I'll say that
much. From general strangeness at the front page to live chat, games, the
Spam Club (don't ask, just sign up), to a cartoon stripper tour guide of
the site. It's a site as strange as the infamous troop themselves and is
updated very regularily. Definitely worth a check.
NOTE: Site support will be changing from 7th Level to private support by
the Pythoners themselves. It's unknown if this will change the site's
services, though it shouldn't.

All-In-One Search
@{b}http://www.geocities.com/tokyo/5103/search.htm@{ub}

The perfect place for you power-searchers out there, enter in your search
string and it's automatically run through up to 20 major internet search
engines simultaneously. You can search the web, ftp sites, ftp, news, or
Usenet.  There's even a Chinese search. And if that isn't enough, there's
an International Directory for phone numbers for Faz, yellow pages, white
pages, addresses, from allover the world.  Throw in an internet address
finder, and this is a must-have in your bookmarks.

Info Beat
@{b}http://www.infobeat.com@{ub}

Your basic internet newspaper, this site has general, entertainment,
sports, and finance news, as well as weather, classifieds, and a
marketplace. Fill out the free sign up and you'll have a custom tailored
(by yourself) e-newspaper delivered straight to your email account each and
every day. Perfect thing to replace all those bulky newspapers with. I even 
use their services myself.


@{b}Pick Of The Month@{ub}

Fandom Directory
@{b}http://members.aol.com/fandata/index.htm@{ub}

Well, if you're an active Sci Fi fan, there's no better place to go than
here.  The Fandom Directory has been around in book form since 1979, and
has always been a good source of Fandom for people the world over.  Well,
now it's online and better than ever.

Basically, Fandom Directory is a directory of anything from the world of
science fiction, fantasy, and horror fandom.  In this directory you will
find individuals, clubs, companies, conventions, and publications, all
oriented towards the world of the non-mundane. Being on-line, you can also
do something here that you can't do with the paperback- you can search for
whatever or whomever you want in any of the mentioned categories.

Have something to offer yourself?  Then you can register yourself in the
Directory; then others can look you up. The Fandom Directory is the premier
networking tools for fans, collectors, dealers, stories, magazines,
publishers, club members, and convention organizers and attendees.

The site has scanned cover art from past issues of the Fandom Directory,
on-line classifieds, and allows you to join their mailing list. There's
even an annual art contest for computer art.

Of course, it's also possible to order the paperback version, giving you
access to full addresses and phone numbers for 70,000+ listings, and dates 
and locations of all conventions, as compared to the sites on-line 4000 
entries thus far.

You want to know who's who and what's going on in the world of fandom, then
you needn't go any farther than this site.

@node "fe5" "AF review AIO"

@{fg shine} Amiga Format review AIO@{fg text}

 In the December 1998 issue of Amiga Format on page 46-47 there is
a review of the AIO compilation #1 disks. This is a two disk package
for people without a modem to read issues 9-15. Here is the gleaming
review below :-

"This is a collection of seven back issues of AIO (Amiga Information
Online), a monthly AmigaGuide-format magazine which is distributed
via bulletin boards, aminet and the AIO web page, (http://www.amiga1.
demon.co.uk/aio/)
 For users without access to a modem, this two disk package offers
a chance to take a look at what is an interesting magazine.
 Since its inception in early 1997, AIO has been steadily growing
in size, scope and quality. Beginning with issue 9, this compilation
illustrates how AIO has evolved and improved as each month has gone by, 
right up to the latest issue, number 15.
 Including news and views on the closure of Cu Amiga magazine, an article 
on the sorry state of the Amiga games market, a transcript of an IRC 
conference with Miami creator Holger Kruse and much more besides, issue 
15 is throughly absorbing reading. There are also plenty of reviews of 
games and utilities, and the results of a couple of recent coding parties.
 AIO appears much more frequently (and reliably) than many diskmags, and 
on the whole it is well written and produced, even if a few spelling 
mistakes can slip in from time to time.
 Those of you who haven't had a chance to read it before will find this 
compilation of recent issues makes facinating reading"
