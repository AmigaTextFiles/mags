The new AMIRAGE™ K2 computer system phase 5 digital products announces
the AMIRAGE ™ K2, the first model in a series of powerful
next-generation computer systems  
{p} {p}
Oberursel, July 22, 1999: phase 5 digital products today proudly
announces a first product of a new series of multimedia computers, the
new AMIRAGE ™ K2 multimedia computer which will provide breathtaking
features and functionality. This new system will finally realize a
vision of computing for the next millenium, which phase 5 digital
products has shared with many Amiga users and supporters of innovative
concepts.
{p} {p}
"Based on our license agreement with QNX Software Systems Ltd., we are
now able to provide our customers with a powerful realtime OS with all
the necessary functionality - and much more - that can make a
next-generation multimedia computer fly" says Wolf Dietrich, General
Manager of phase 5 digital products. "The lack of a decent OS, which
can support our hardware vision, has been the major reason that
earlier projects for stand-alone systems at phase 5 had been put on
hold. That problem is solved by integrating the QNX Neutrino OS, so we
now can push forward our demanding vision of a new powerful computer
generation."
{p} {p}
The new AMIRAGE ™ K2 computer system supports full multi-processing
and is already in it's base configuration expandable with additional
CPUs. More than that, distributed processing through different
networks is fully supported, allowing the realization of a new vision
of computing, including distributed, internet-aware applications and
services. The AMIRAGE ™ K2 computer will be an expandable power-horse
for all kind of creative computing and multimedia, with many upgrading
options and interfaces for third-party add-ons, and offer full
compliance with the major industry and digital multimedia standards.
{p} {p}
As the new QNX Neutrino OS will also become available for all PowerUP™
upgrades for Amiga computers developed by phase 5 digital products
(please read the respective announcement here), a smooth upgrade path
and full Amiga 3.x legacy support is provided both for end users and
developers of the existing PowerUP product line from phase 5 digital
products. With this stunning feature set, it is expected to see a
large number of next-generation applications, running natively under
the QNX Neutrino OS on the AMIRAGE ™ K2 computer to be available with
the release of the new system, which is scheduled for the beginning of
the year 2000.
{p} {p}
"We are excited that we finally can create a product technology which
we could not realize in the past, due to the lack of OS support and a
competition with non-existing but announced projects, which we were
faced with" outlines Wolf Dietrich. "The new AMIRAGE ™ K2 design
extends the proposed features of our older pre\box project, and
contains many elements of the earlier A\BOX concept, but without the
neccessity to design customized hardware right now. As the QNX
Neutrino OS concept is also in full accordance with our vision of a
new OS - in the past and today - we feel that we finally can make the
dream of many Amiga users as well as other computer users come true."

The AMIRAGE ™ K2 computer system will be built around the latest
available technologies, and support the major standards in digital
multimedia. Although it will not be designed as a low-cost system, it
will be very reasonably priced, and will be surprisingly attractive in

With it's extensive features and impressive multimedia
functionalities, the AMIRAGE ™ K2 is a powerful personal workstation
for all purposes. But beyond that, it will also be the first
fully-featured Personal Network&Media Server that will function as a
heart of a new generation of computing. "AMIRAGE ™ K2 is not designed
to only impress with a potential hardware overkill. We do hear a lot
about new applications and even revolutions in the computer industry
these days. We at phase 5 digital products also believe that computing
will differ in the future, and new services will be expected by the
users" comments Wolf Dietrich. "But still the necessary hardware
functionality counts, to make such new services available. If you e.g.
want your multimedia and 3D data streams to appear somewhere else than
on your local monitor, than a typical 3D display card that outputs a
single high-frequency analog signal, which allows a maximum of 1.5
meters shielded cable, is not very helpful. For such applications,
fully digital processing units - as provided with the AMIRAGE ™ K2's
processor and coprocessor units - and networking capabilities are
needed to process the data and distribute it to any device or
appliance that can communicate with the user. The hardware of the
AMIRAGE ™ K2, as well as the superior functionality of the QNX
Neutrino OS, perfectly meet the requirements of such demanding
next-generation applications."

Consequently, in the 2nd quarter of 2000, phase 5 digital products
will release a first external extension, the AMIRAGE ™ LCU, which is a
Local Communication Unit. This small and very inexpensive device will
be used to provide local video and audio output on separate monitors,
TV sets, or other video/audio devices. The audio and video streams are
provided as digital data streams (in different digital formats,
depending on the actual content, e.g. as MPEG Audio/Video or lossless
compressed for the display of digital screens) by the AMIRAGE ™ K2.
The AMIRAGE ™ LCU also accepts inputs via an IrDa interface, e.g. from
remote controls or keyboards, to allow full interaction. It is
currently planned to connect the LCU via the IEEE-1394 port. As
multiple LCUs can be connected to the AMIRAGE ™ K2, it is possible to
display video and output audio on various devices, including the
simultaneous output of different audio/video streams; thus, it is e.g.
possible that different persons in a house watch a video, browse the
internet, hold a videoconference, and play a 3D game independently and
simultaneously (or play an interactive game together, for example).
This is just a first example of what will be possible from the synergy
of the superior QNX Neutrino OS and the powerful AMIRAGE ™ K2 hardware
platform from phase 5 digital products. Also under consideration are
inexpensive and wireless webpads and hand-held communication devices
for videoconfering/videophoning, with lowest power consumption, which
use the AMIRAGE ™ K2's communication functionalities and data
processing and distribution capabilities.
{p} {p}
The new AMIRAGE ™ K2 computer system is scheduled for shipment with
the beginning of the year 2000. The pricing of the base system is TBD
and will be determined later this year. More information will be
published regularly; please come back often and check for updates,
mailings lists, and other news.
