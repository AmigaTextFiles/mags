Between Amigas with and without QNX, Linux raising it's head, Phase 5
and HP going independent, with their own versions of our beloved Ami,
and every other attempt at stretching the definition of an Amiga, I
thought it long overdue for a definition of just what IS an Amiga. What
hardware and software components are required to make a computer an
Amiga.
{p} {p}
That's what this article is all about.
{p} {p}
First, the Hardware. Two basic types of things leap immediately to
mind.  Autoconfig and Custom Chips. Long before Plug And Pray tried a
mistaken leap at the idea, Autoconfig was making life easy; just pop in
the board and that's it. So, our first requirement is our machine MUST
have Autoconfig.
{p} {p}
As for Custom chips, in an age where the benefits of entire daughter
boards devoted to just such things as 3D rendering, the concept of a
custom chip remains the same. Design a series of chips and/or daughter
boards, whose function is to unload some of the drugery from the CPU. Be
they co-processors, custom chips, or entire boards, it's the same basic
thing.  In the Amiga this amounts to parrallel processing (since what
are the custom chips but additional processors linked up in parallel)-
long before desktop PC ever even thought of the idea. So here, Custom
Chips and Parallel Processing are pretty much the same sort of thing,
and our second requirement.

Our last Hardware requirement is, of course, Multimedia compatible. As
in built in television signal, compatible hookups to whichever happens
to be the media players of the day, including the latest Audio, video or
CD players, holographic projectors (thinking just abit farther ahead),
and whatever.

Software. This can be summmed up as Multitasking, lean memory use, a
flexible interface, and complete adaptability.  Multitasking everyone
knows; just make it true pre-emptive and we're happy.
{p} {p}
Memory use, well no OS should keep bloating up to 50% of your system
resources just to boot up; if you get a more powerful machine you
deserve a similiar increase in performance and productivity, NOT just
more power for an OS to eat up just for doing what it did before. More
available power is no excuse for sloppy programming. In this regard,
Amiga programmers have more personal pride in what they do than other
platforms seem to do. Similarily, the OS should be just as stingy with
CPU cycles.
{p} {p}
Then there's the interface. Be it a standard GUI, a basic shell
interface, or the gee-wiz-bang interface of the future, it should be as
simple and flexible to use as possible. Customizing your interface to
suite your needs shouldn't involve any complex maze of settings, files
to edit, and clumsy GUIs. It should be intuitive and as easy to use as
any other appliance.
{p} {p}
Finally, we have adaptability. The Amiga OS is THE most hackable OS on
the planet, as evidenced by the vast array of emulators for other
platforms, file compatability, system hacks, and the variety of uses
to which Amigas have been put to that the original designers had no
idea would even be around. Put as many hacks in a Windoze or Mac
system as your average Ami Power-User has and they'd come crashing
down (Windoze can't even handle it's OWN hacks). Keep this adaptibility
and you proof your system against any and all future developments
(who ever foresaw Mpeg a decade ago? And yet an A4000 can get away
with playing mpeg video without specialized hardware).
{p} {p}
That, in general terms, is what I believe constitutes an Amiga. Change
the CPU, change the software around, but keep the above ideals and
you've still got an Amiga. Be it the Amiga company or Phase 5, it can
still be an Ami if your just but keep to these.
{p} {p}
Listen well Amiga, we're keeping a careful eye on you.
