Boat is an Amiga version of an old LCD game made way back in 1983. Well
at least that is what the author says. I've never seen the game myself
but this version looks like a classic LCD game so it must be true.
{p} {p}
I have reviewed another LCD game a few issues back and even if you didn't
see that review you really should know what one is. A quick guide to
an LCD game is basically it is a hand-held game which I title and most
people call an LCD Game, standing for Liquid Crystal Display game. This
is because these little games have an LCD screen.
{p} {p}
They are not very powerful so the graphics are nearly always in black
and white with a static colour background sometimes. I'm sure many of
you have played them in your youth because I remember wasting many
hours playing these things and they where very cheaply priced way back
then. Simply, they are an early day, one game gameboy affair.
{p} {p}
The idea of this game is a boat is burning and the passengers are
jumping from this boat into shark infested waters. You luckily are the
person to control the little boats below to catch these unlucky jumping
people and if you miss the shark will eat them. Controlled by using the
keys, Left Amiga, L-Shift and L-Alt goes Left and Right Amiga, R-Shift and
R-Alt goes right. Simple! You just choose the key on either side that
suits you and away you go.
{p} {p}
However there is a small problem. You can only hold 3 people in your
boat at one time. Earlier I said that these only have one game but in
most cases they have Mode A and Mode B. Basically the same game but
with some simple differences. The screen of the game is split into
four. The top two are your playing areas and the bottom two are mock
up buttons and game selectors from the 'real' LCD game. If you choose
Mode A then you have two ships one in each of the top two screens.
Each boat can hold three people and once one boat is full you will have
to move it right to the edge of that screen and empty the people onto
the dry land.
{p} {p}
If you choose Mode B it is much harder as you only have one boat but
people jumping in both screens meaning you have to move into both
screens and save people with just one boat and not two like in the
earlier mode. This makes the game a hell of a lot harder and much
more challenging.
{p} {p}
Overall its a fun game. I'm not sure about the graphics, the men are
done to original style but the backgrounds look a bit poor. I haven't
actually seen the original so I don't think i'm the best to comment
on the graphics but i'm sure they wouldn't have been exactly like
the ones in the game. I would really only recommend you get this if
you've had the original LCD game in the past or you want to see what
you missed out on years ago.
