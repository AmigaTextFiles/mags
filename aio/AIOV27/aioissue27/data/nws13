Product specification
{p} {p}
Note: Cleveland specifications may vary a little bit from Ockna.
{p} {p}
For the Iwin Cleveland M:
{p} {p}
* M: CPU: Motorola M68060 / 50 MHz (M+ version with M68060/66)
{p} {p}
* Motherboard form: ATX - standard PC
{p} {p}
* Memory: 4 memory slots for standard SDRAM/DIMM memory modules. (max.
   amount of RAM 128MB in sum)
{p} {p}
* Memory management: Done by MCU (memory control unit) and DDK-I
   (DDK-internal) to separate memory into chip and fast ram. User can
   select the desired amount of usable and available memory with the
   DDK-I user interface before the boot process during startup
{p} {p}
* Memory expansion: User can expand the memory using standard SDRAM
   modules. Computer has to be restarted and DDK-I has to "count" the
   memory once more after installation.
{p} {p}
* i3D graphic subsystem: NOT as in REVA stated integrated on the
   motherboard! The i3D card will be connected to the motherboard
   through a special connector on the very right side of the board
   (see new suggestions for the board layout). Graphic chipset with
   the i3D chip on top of it. Switcher2 included on the board for
   correct calls from the AmigaOS and correct display of the Amiga
   graphic modes as well as the different chipsets of the original
   Amiga.
{p} {p}
* i3D specifications (see below)
{p} {p}
* Iwin DDK software included on a single chip on the motherboard to
   provide maximum compatibility with new hardware (supported by the
   DDK-I software)
{p} {p}
* NCU Chip on board (Network controlling unit) which acts as an
   Ethernet NIC together with the 10/100 interface
{p} {p}
* PAT Chip on board (Interface controlling unit) which handles the
   connections between the various interfaces (USB, etc.) with the
   motherboard and then the DDK-I chip
{p} {p}
* IDE Controller on board (Cleveland) and standard SCSI2 / UW
   controller card in Ockna (acquires one PCI slot!)
{p} {p}
* Cleveland IDE controller can support up to four EIDE drives
{p} {p}
* BOOT ROM chip on board which handles the boot procedure, checks for
   the AmigaOS, invokes the DDK-I setup if needed.
{p} {p}
* Switcher1 chip on board which handles most of the compatibility
   issues between the Iwin motherboard and custom chips and the
   original Amiga custom chips, extensions, etc. Switcher is (c) by
   Iwin.
{p} {p}
* SHU (Slot handling unit) chips (2 x) on board. They handle the
   different slot architectures on the motherboard to provide
   compatibility with PCI and AGP with the AmigaOS and the Zorro slots
   with the Iwin custom chips
{p} {p}
* BON Chip on board which handles the connection(s) between the
   Switcher and the expansion slots as well as the video slot for
   providing high compatibility with existing Amiga hardware
{p} {p}
* 3 x PCI slots on the motherboard
{p} {p}
* 1 x AGP slot on the motherboard
{p} {p}
* 3 x Zorro III slots on the motherboard (subject to change!)
{p} {p}
* Video Slot on board for use with existing Amiga video / multimedia
   hardware
{p} {p}
* 1 x Floppy HD 3.5"
{p} {p}
* Harddisk included (4, 8, 10 or 13 Gigabyte)
{p} {p}
* Keyboard and Mouse interfaces included on the board for connecting
   original Amiga keyboards and mices (mouse connector on external
   cable).
{p} {p}
* 2 x USB interfaces
{p} {p}
* 1 x parallel interface
{p} {p}
* 2 x serial interface
{p} {p}
* 2 x digital joystick interface (on external cable)
{p} {p}
* 1 x analog joystick interface (on external cable)
{p} {p}
* TV in/out interface
{p} {p}
* Analog and digital stereo input/output interface
{p} {p}
