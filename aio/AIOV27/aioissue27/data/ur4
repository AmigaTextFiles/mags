VisualGuide is a program that makes filelist of selected directories in a
AmigaGuide file. This is useful if you want to catalogize your MP3s, or
any other files.

There is no installation, just copy it somewhere and run it.

How do you use it then? You can either run it from CLI with the desired options,
or you can start it from WB and get a nifty little MUI GUI. I will only talk about
the GUI, since I guess that's what interests most of you!
You will get something like this when you start it:
{p} {p}
{image 27_VisualGuide.IFF}
{p} {p}
The GUI is very self-explainatory, and you can use it within 5 seconds of looking!

It makes a great Guide, it's layed out as this. The first page you come to when
looking at the Guide is the drawer you selected, you can then click your way through
the "drawers" and check what files/drawers that lies inside them, and see the size,
date etc..

Nothing more to say really, just a great util for those who want to
catalogize their stuff..

Oh, one thing, if you want to send these Guide's to a PC friend, to let him look
through your MP3s or such, then I would recommend you to search for a great but
old util to show AmigaGuide's on PC's, just search for WinGuide on any Aminetsite
and you will find it!
