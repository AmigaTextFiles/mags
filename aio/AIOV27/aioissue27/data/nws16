Bertie's Animal Kingdom is an Animal recognition game designed for
nursery, and pre-school children. The only requirement is that the
child must have a basic knowledge of how to use a mouse. Keyboary
controls are not required, except to enter the childs name for the
his score table. All actions which the child does highlight different
areas of the screen in a bright colour so that they know what they are
doing if they click the mouse button on that spot.

For some younger children it may be advisable for a parent to stay with
them and monitor their progress or to help them with reading etc...
All main text in the game is displayed in a large vivid white font.

In the game the child is helped along by a cartoon character called
"Bertie" He gives them a task to perform, tells them what to do, and
when the task is complete he tells them how well they did. Each
question answered correctly will award them 1-3 gold stars which are
shown at all times in the top left of the screen. This is to encourage
them to beat this score with each new attempt.

CD version has extra speech and 7 bonus games.
