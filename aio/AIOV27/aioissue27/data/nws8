NewsRog 1.8 Library Patch A: 22-Aug-99
{p} {p}
This patch fixes a memory corruption problem that can cause random
crashes in NewsRog 1.8.  All users are urged to install this patch.
{p} {p}
To install this patch, copy the file
{p} {p}

{p} {p}
to the MUI subdirectory of your NewsRog install directory, and reboot
your Amiga.  (You may also simply quit NewsRog and insure that all of
the NewsRog libraries are flushed from memory; a reboot simply insures
that this happens).
