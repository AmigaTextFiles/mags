Hello and welcome!
{p} {p}
Its been a strange kind of a month on the Amiga front, the tables and
stands are cleared away at both WoA99 and the AmiWest show. As far
as I have read both went well and at least most people where pleased
with what they have seen. Although not attending this years WoA I
think it is important for these types of shows to continue so we have
a reason if not just to buy some new items but to meet up with all
the people we have communicated with over every media other than
basic one to one communication.
{p} {p}
It shows us that the people who run these companies, user groups and
whatever else who are doing things for the Amiga are just normal
people like the rest of us. These companies are run by Amiga users
themselves and the only difference from us to them is that they are
trying to make a living out of what they sell. It shows in the days
of the Amiga now we are all alike, noone is any different, this is
ofcourse in a good way I mean. I don't think I know of one person
who is not doing something or has done something for the Amiga in
one way or another. We are the ones building the dream and have kept
this old rollercoster going for as long as it has. Yes sometimes we
have gone off the rails but have got straight back on and it is this
commitment that is saving {bold}OUR{nobold} computer. Without you,
me and everyone else the Amiga would not be here for a fact.
{p} {p}
So with this I would like to thank everybody and congratulate you all
on this fine achievement. Although, at the moment I have just been
sitting back and watching was has been going by me. Listening to all
the gossip, reading all peoples rants and generally just taking in
the atmosphere that has surrounded the Amiga globe recently.
{p} {p}
What I hear and read does anger me sometimes because I think some,
not all people have lost the plot as I see people plunge into PC
users mode more and more. Isn't it the fact that we have PC users
talking about the specs of this and the speed of that that annoys
us sometimes? In the end who really cares how many light-sourced-lazer-bitmapped-polygons
or whatever the latest 'buzz' word is. Does it really matter if you
can have a billion colours on screen at once or shift things at 1000
frames per second.
{p} {p}
In the end it is the computers community, the way they act, the
way they do things and joy you get out of using your computer. It
is nice to see that these days most people know what they are
talking about in the Amiga market but constantly I see people sounding
more like PC users caring what the specs of this are or what the
speed of such and such can go at. The friendlyness of the Amiga
community is in danger of becoming the 'mine can go faster than yours'
PC world. When talking to PC users all they seem to be bothered
about is that they can get Quake going 1fps faster than the other
guy. I personally think talking of such things are a waste of time.
You could spend more time analising the hardware of a machine and
just completely forget what it is there for. A tool to use, a machine
to relax on, whatever you use your computer for is the purpose that
makes you like that certain computer. Of course you can get a PC
more powerful than an Amiga but just because it has more power and
better specs doesn't mean I like it. Why recently has there been
so much emphasis around what power the new Amiga is going to be and
not how it is going to handle.
{p} {p}
From my point of view i'd rather have an Amiga that has a community
like we have now, with great support and something I enjoy using
rather than a powerful beast of a machine. I am not so small minded
to think that power is nothing, yes, of course it is, but in the
end it is what you do with it that counts.
{p} {p}
I bet most PCs are going to waste, the average PC user probably doesn't
use more than 10% of the power that they have at their finger-tips but
keeps upgrading whether they need to or not.
{p} {p}
Do people in the Amiga community want to end up like that? Maybe I
am different from everyone but to me the computer is there to be
explored, sit down and find out what you can do, take it to its
limits and then come back and tell me you are an expert. I really hate
all this talk about speed and power. If that is all you care about
then you are not a computer user, not even an Amiga computer user.
{p} {p}
You should go off and play with your microwave to see which has more
power or have a look at who has the better motored lawn-mower. If
you want to be a real computer user then get to know its workings,
become THE computer user. Use it for what you want to use it for and
not for how much power it has, don't get into the game of mines more
powerful than yours.
{p} {p}
I agree, seeing nice chips used and powerful hardware in a computer
is great and to see it finally bring us up to date and even past
up to date, but don't forget that the heart of a computer is for
your use.
{p} {p}
And another thing....
{p} {p}
Recently I have seen many people talking about the fact that Amiga
does not listen to our wishes. Reading through another magazine who
will remain nameless I noticed a clip taken from an Amiga newsgroup
that said 'when will Amiga ask us what we want' or something similar
along those lines.
{p} {p}
This type of talk is an awful state of affairs. Where do some people
dream up such ideas? Do you think Bill Gates and his band of merry
men ask the PC world what they want? Do you see Intel asking the
billions of PC buyers what they should do next. I'm sure the answer
is simple and that is... no.
{p} {p}
Personally I think Jim Collas and the rest of the Amiga team are
doing a blinding job giving the feedback they are giving, taking into
consideration what task they have been handed. Jim will personally
reply to alot of the emails he receives and he quotes he receives
100+ emails a day. How many of these disbelievers including maybe
you reading this if you are a disbeliever would expect a reply from
Bill Gates personally or have tried to email him and got a reply?
{p} {p}
I do know that the PC world is a much bigger scale but would you
seriously consider replying to 100+ emails a day aswell as trying to
run a computer company which is trying to get a foot back in an
already huge market. I don't think any of us would and I give Jim
and the rest of the workers alot of credit. I have heard many people
say that they received 1000 emails every day, but mostly these are
mailing lists and not personal mail. I doubt very many people even
get 10 personal emails per day. So please whoever thinks that Amiga
aren't giving us enough feedback then take into account the points
i've raised and see the bigger picture before opening your mouths.
{p} {p}
Lastly....
{p} {p}
I'd like to thank a few people who have helped or just generally need
thanking for something they did towards this issue. Firstly thanks
to {bold}Ray Elf{nobold} for his nice title screen. Next I would like to thank
{bold}Michael Evervall{nobold} for his music. I would also like to thank {bold}Srdan Kvrgic{nobold}
for doing some new menu screens for us and lastly like to say thankyou
to {bold}Bjorn Lynne{nobold} who very kindly sent us his latest music CD from his
own record lable LynneMusic Productions which can be found at,
{link http://www.lynnemusic.com}http://www.lynnemusic.com{end}. You can
read the {link fe9}review{end} of this CD in the Articles Section.
