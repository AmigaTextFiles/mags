Lately it seems that the solution the computer industry has put to
problems with both hardware and software problems is get faster hardware,
buy more hardware or memory, or claim the problem does not exist. I,
for one, am relieved that Amiga has not taken that route with upgrading
the Amiga or with the AmigaNG system. Instead, Jim C and company have
opted for a combination of new technology and an existing operating
system.

Sadly, many people in the Amiga community have made their decisions
about what Amiga should do. Most of the time, those decisions are short
sighted or maintenance of status-quo. But that type of decision is not
a type that will bring Amiga to the forefront of the computer industry.
{p} {p}
When the Amiga first came out, there were very few people who had any
use for it. Even Bill Gates claimed no one would want to work with a
system using a GUI. Ironic as it is, even Bill Gates came to understand
that the real advantage of a GUI was not evident at that time. I believe
we are in the same type of situation with AmigaNG and Linux.

True, Linux is an existing system that has been unable to take over
Windows userbase. Linux has, on the other hand, made many inroads
without falling on its face. It is in operation, though, in very
significant numbers with many recommendations. Major software creators
are looking at Linux with increasing approval. Numbers of users are
growing steadily.

It is unfortunate that in the past Amiga did not make very clear that
QNX was only one of many OSs under consideration. But, many of us
interpreted the information that QNX was selected to be THE system. From
the sounds of things, the QNX people must have felt that they had the
inside track, also. I think it was a little short-sighted of them to
feel that they were in the driver's seat, so to speak.
{p} {p}
I can understand that the QNX people are upset about the appearant change
of direction. Anyone in their shoes would be. And I am sorry for that.
{p} {p}
Amiga has one problem that QNX cannot solve. Lack of time. Amiga needs
to get going. Not with just a new operating system, but also with
viable software. After all, very few people will buy a computer system
nowadays without software to run on it. The software has to be something
they can use. At this point in time Linux is one of a few choices that
have at least a minimum of software. Linux also has companies willing to
invest in development for it.
{p} {p}
This brings up an interesting situation. If Amiga is willing to spend
a great deal of money on developing a GUI-operated Linux and include
in the development the new generation of main processors, are the
companies looking at Linux ready to join forces with Amiga and really
create the NEXT generation of computer systems. It appears Jim Collas
is attempting to find those developers who are ready to invest and to
persuade othere who are `on the fence.'
{p} {p}
There is also nothing to stop QNX from going on a developing their
operating system. They will certainly find users if they create a really
great system.

Only time will tell us if Amiga has made the right decision. The way
things progress in the computer world I do not believe we will have to
wait very long to find out if the decision will truly bring the Amiga,
as a system, to the lips of people in the computer world. It will take
longer to find out if Amiga will find inroads into the world of business
computing. At the rate new announcements and interviews are flying in
the news media, I believe that it will become quite evident that Amiga
is on a solid course with solid management.
