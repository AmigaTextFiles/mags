The objective of the AAC is to help us better plan the future of Amiga
through close communications with people who are viewed as leaders in
the Amiga community. The members of the AAC have all executed
non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), with Amiga and will have access to
confidential information regarding future products and plans. This
allows Amiga to share sensitive information with respected members of
the Amiga community without having to disclose our plans publicly.
{p} {p}
The members of the AAC were selected to represent their different areas of
affiliation within the Amiga community - the Press, Developers,
Dealers/Distributors, and the User Group organizations.   The AAC is designed
to provide a flow of information from the Community to the Amiga management
team and from Amiga back to the community.  Each of the members of the AAC will
act as a conduit to the community and the areas that they represent.
{p} {p}
We held our first official meetings with the AAC in London and in Sacramento
with over 20 AAC members participate in these first official meetings. The AAC
was able to share with Amiga many of the desires, and needs of the community.
As we work towards the launch of the Next Generation Amiga the input received
by the AAC will help guide those decisions.
{p} {p}
"We are excited to welcome the members of the AAC as active representatives of
the Amiga community and look forward to implementing many of the programs
suggested in the near future,  stated Jim Collas, "together we will make a
difference in computing forever."
