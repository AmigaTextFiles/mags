The news that Amiga have decided to choose Linux for the NG Amiga instead
of QNX came as a great shock to everyone. For this issue people where
asked for their comments on the change.

It was a BIG shock to me. I think from reasonable side switching to Linux is
bad. Linux is server type OS. No mater how you call it, it's UN*X and it's
clumsy, NOT user friendly and so on ... First they announced that they'll
use KERNEL only and later in the same document they say it's for
compatibility with drivers. How the heck KERNEL ONLY will be compatible
with drivers. Later they say that Linux OS will be used and X WILL BE on
top of it, and JAVA, and some mysterious AmigaObjects. This sound to me
that OS will be very BIG.
{p} {p}
Of-course I would like to have Neutrino because it's kernel is SMALL and
what's better modular. Some of you might say that Linux KERNEL can be
modular, I won't argue about this but kernel size plus other LinuxOS layers
makes me wonder:  isn't this thing turning into windoze by the size (and
maybe speed).
{p} {p}
From the commercial side switching to LinuxOS is good decision (drivers and
etc.). Many software houses support it and Linux get's more popular
everyday.
{p} {p}
I'm gonna wait and see (AmigaNG's review, full hardware specs, price and
etc.)

Dear aio,
{p} {p}
When I signed on I mentioned I was rather short on the technicalities
with the Amiga and I have a problem.
{p} {p}
I am unable to read the issues aio 25 or 26. I have attempted to open the
files using Wordworth 6 and Multiview.
{p} {p}
The former freezes when attempting to format the document and the latter
simple returns to the Multiview window.
{p} {p}
Your advice would be much appreciated.
{p} {p}
Yours faithfully,
{p} {p}
Ken Deeprose.

{bold}Re{nobold} : AIO Issue 26 Piracy article
{p} {p}
Hello AIO,
{p} {p}
I do have something to say about this article.
{p} {p}
Anyone who looked at the CU website could have downloaded a working install
script and how to obtain the serial numbers for Cinema4D and Mainactor from
HiSoft.
{p} {p}
I simply mailed the HiSoft guys to provide me the missing numbers, and they
did. That's how I got my Cinema working, no AF exertion needed.

Hi folks, I thought I'd write in to air my views on what the Free PCs that
are now on offer could mean to Amiga's prospective market range.
{p} {p}
Since FreePC.com started giving PCs away and with FreeMAC.com about to
start doing the same with Macs I have started to wonder about Amiga's
prospects when it comes to getting a foot in the door of the computer
industry.  Strictly speaking these PCs and Macs arn't completly 'free'
(what is these days?) as certain advertising banners have to pop up on
screen from time to time so the user has to take time to close these
windows each time they appear but even so, with people who couldn't
usually afford to buy computers getting them free, this will surely reduce
the amount of people wanting to change to the new MCC Amigas. 
{p} {p}
By the time the Amiga appears on the market more people than ever will
have PCs or MACs, will already have bought hundreds of pounds of software
and hardware each and will be unwilling to spend even more to by a new
computer, no matter how good they are.
{p} {p}
I dont mean to be negative about Amiga's chance with the MCCs.  I, for
one, am already saving up to buy one (however much they cost) but other
than existing Amiga owners who is actually going to buy them?  For the
first year or so I dont think there will be that many sales so I hope
Amiga have enough money to stay afloat with low sales for at least a year.
{p} {p}
Please realise this is just my point of view, don't flame me for it.  I'd
also like to add that I have been advertising the new Amigas wherever
possible (I've already told two managers of Electronic Boutique of the
soon-to-appear Amiga and they both seemed VERY supprised but also very
interested.  With any luck this info will filter back up the chain of
command and they will restock Amiga games.  Well, we can but hope.
{p} {p}
Good luck to Amiga and I look forward to their Chip revelation (whenever
it is released).

Just emailing to say that I think that having AIO on a new screen is a
superb idea.

Thanks for all the hard work,{p}
