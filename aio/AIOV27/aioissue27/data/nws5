After some speculation that Amiga Survivor - the popular Amiga
magazine -had ceased to be, the editors surprise everyone by releasing
their latest issue. Another bumper packed issue this time 'round,
containing a definitive five page review of Napalm, plus further
reviews of Max Rally, Vulcanology, Marblelous 2, Games Attack and
Quake Total Conversions. We have a bunch of previews along the lines
of Joyride, Rage of Mages & Seaside amongst others, plus there's also
our cover game; Shogo featured. We've got our usual lines of regulars;
Web Watch, Aminet Ramblings (including a look at the latest
emulators), Joe & Ami, Gilbert Goodmate Work in Progress (including
the latest full colour screens!), Retro, and Keith Elcombe waves us
goodbye in his final Fifth Column. Further information can be found on
the official AS website located at:
