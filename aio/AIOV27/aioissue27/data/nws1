Jogeir Liljedahl, perhaps the most famous Amiga MOD musician ever, has
published his first music CD.
{p} {p}
Jogeir Liljedahl was the composer behind such massive Amiga MOD hits as
"Guitar Slinger", "Mystified", "Face Another Day", "Out of Silence",
"G-Comp", "Physical Presence" and too many others to mention. He has won
several awards and prizes at Amiga demo- and music-conventions and for years
been one of the driving forces behind the entire free MOD music movement
that started around 1987 on the Amiga computer.
{p} {p}
He started the music-production group "Noiseless" in the early 90's and they
produced such music-disks as "Ambrozia", "Dizzy Tunes", "Dizzy Tunes 2",
"Full Moon" and others.

For years, Jogeir wanted to publish a CD with his music, but he lacked the
money to get the project off the ground.  But in early 1999, Bjorn Lynne, an
old friend and also an Amiga musician, stepped in and offered to release
Jogeir's CD on his "LynneMusic Productions" label.
{p} {p}
Bjorn Lynne was known as "Dr.Awesome" and part of the demo-group "Crusaders"
in the Amiga scene back in the late 80's and early 90's. Bjorn "Dr.Awesome"
Lynne has since then set up a small record label and mailorder business
specialising on music CDs by musicians from the Amiga demo scene. Bjorn also
writes music for computer games and has released several CD albums, too. He
decided to help Jogeir get his CD released, and in August 1999 the CD was
published on Bjorn's label LynneMusic productions. Other artists CDs
available through LynneMusic are Chris Hülsbeck, Allister Brimble, Adam
"Scorpik" Skorupa, Gustaf "Lizardking" Grevberg and others.
