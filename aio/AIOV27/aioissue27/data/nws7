FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
{p} {p}
ShadowWorks Software announces the Version 1.8 update to NewsRog, the most
advanced newsreader available for the Amiga platform.  NewsRog has a wealth of
features for the power user, many of them unavailable in any other newsreader
on any platform.
{p} {p}
Version 1.8 includes 30 new features and improvements.  The list of newsreader
features pioneered by NewsRog now includes automatic detection of tabular data
in plain text postings, such as Aminet file listings or perhaps tables of race
results.  Although there is no explicit marking of tables in usenet posts,
NewsRog can now detect tabular data and display it without line rewrapping in a
fixed width font.  Now you can see tables aligned properly even when using an
easy-to-read proportional font for reading article text.
{p} {p}
Another NewsRog-pioneered feature is the ability to seamlessly integrate
usenet with web search engines or directory services such as Yahoo or
Altavista.  For example, perhaps you are reading an article that mentions
NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft.  You can multiselect several words or
phrases in the article text (perhaps "NASA" and "Mars Climate Orbiter"), and
access a popup menu which will automatically formulate and submit a search
about those phrases to any one of your favorite web search engines.  You don't
have to type anything - merely view the results!  See a movie mentioned in an
article and want to look up the IMDB entry?  You can do so with a single menu
selection.
{p} {p}
Also new in version 1.8 is a graphical crosspost editor, advanced heuristics
for telling email addresses from message-IDs in an article body even when both
have the same <idstring@host.addr> format, and much more.
