Alien Escape is a game from 1996 which has just recently been uploaded
to the Aminet archives. It is a German game and the documents only came
in German. I only have a very limited amount of knowledge of the German
language but could make out that this game was not originally uploaded
to the Aminet but now is.... ermm.. useful I know!
{p} {p}
The idea of Alien Escape is to shoot the Aliens that come from left to
right before they reach the other side (right side). As far as I could
tell there where two types of Alien and one human i'm sure.

The graphics are terrible and the sounds are just the basic Amos boom,
ping and shoot noise so nothing especially outstanding there. You can
collect some bonus items which randomly appear on screen although some
appear outside your mouse limits so you can't actually get to them. As
an Amos coder from many years ago myself I know this problem could have
been fixed in little or no time at all considering the author managed
to make this 'game' in the first place. The bonuses rarely seemed to
do anything except the one Commodore (R.I.P.) logo which freezes the
aliens currently on screen at that time.

Its not like you'll need to pick up that bonus any time because the
game is so damn easy. Picking up what I could from the German text
once completing a level you go onto a harder one which incidently has
exactly the same background and aliens. I didn't notice any increase
in hardness, maybe they forgot to put it in.

Saying all this the game does have some good qualities... well... one.
The title music is a nice little tune which probably accounts for
60% of the total archive size. The actual game executable is 162k where
the music is another 200k, go figure! The music contains a sample
of 'something, something, out of space, to find another race'.
Unfortunately I don't know the full words. Although this song is nice
i'm sure i've heard it somewhere else.. but I could be mistaken.

Overall a terrible game that I wouldn't even consider downloading. Save
yourself some time and effort and just avoid it on your travels.
