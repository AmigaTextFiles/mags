As you know we have now been running for a long time. This issue
brings us to 27 months in production, thats well over 2 years
in the making. In this time we have brought you a certain amount
of reviews of commercial games and a few commercial utilities.
{p} {p}
As you should know we do not review everything released that is
commecial due to the fact that we are not making any money to
buy this software and this is where we need review copies of
anything that is released.
{p} {p}
Review copies allow us to tell you about the latest software
giving you in-depth reviews and an fair review of the product
telling you its good and bad points. If possible we would like
to bring you reviews of everything new that is released but for
this we would need your help.
{p} {p}
I am not asking for money or sponsorship but if you'd like to see
a certain product reviewed or products from a certain company
then you must tell them that you think it would be a good idea
to supply us with review copies.
{p} {p}
The main reason companies supply magazines with review copies
is to advertise their product and hopefully get a good review
which will ofcourse boost their sales. Some companies have already
realised our success and already sent us review copies like
clickBOOM, Digital Dreams Entertainment, Vulcan when they did
Amiga software, Ologram (Producers of Olofight), Fortress
producers of Max Rally, GPSoft plus many other companies who we
are grateful to for suppying us with review material.
{p} {p}
However, some companies have either not heard of us or do not
know that people will see their products in our magazine so we
need YOU, everyone one of you to email these companies to tell
them that you think we should receive review copies. I mean
everyone of you... in the end it benifits you so please take
just a few moments to email some of the companies listed below
and suggest they provide us with review materials.
