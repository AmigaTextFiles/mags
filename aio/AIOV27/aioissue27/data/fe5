Another news group post, this one from the Amiga R & D Team. I just
thought it fair to pass on what they have to say about recent decisions
and the future of the Amiga...

Very interesting and active debate over the past two weeks. We
*love* the passion of (most of ;-)) the on-line community. Linux?
X- Windows?  PCI? USB?  MIDI?  Floppy Drive? ATI graphics, etc.,
 etc. While an overwhelming percentage of our email is quite positive
about Amiga's directions, there are those who have raised quite
legitimate technical concerns, and a small percentage who are just
bashing everything we do (more on them later).
{p} {p}
One positive aspect of the Linux announcement is the huge influx of
technical talent into the Amiga camp from the Linux community. There
are legitimate issues with Linux, as anyone with a technical
background will acknowledge. One positive aspect of the Linux
phenomenon is that there are hundreds of thousands of programmers out
there working to fix those problems. There are also hundreds of
companies working on applications and drivers (and hardware) for
Linux, that we can immediately tap into. Yes, there are integration
and testing issues to work on, but there are many, many more
positives than negatives. Please understand that the Linux decision
was not purely (actually not mostly) a technical decision.  It was a
decision driven by a reasoned analysis of what underlying OS would
give Amiga the greatest chance to succeed in the marketplace, and as
a company.
{p} {p}
Also understand that we have not yet seen a single technical issue
raised in the news groups that we are not already aware of, and
working on either inside of Amiga or through partners. Will the
Amiga MCC under development be perfect?  Of course not -- product
development is all about tradeoffs. When it is shipping, will it be
at the heart of the best distributed multimedia computing environment
in the marketplace in terms of price/performance/usability? Yes!
Even more important, the MCC is only one piece of a much broader
strategy that we have chosen to not really discuss yet. When Jim
Collas talks about revolutions, it's not a revolution in terms of
what happens to be inside the MCC box (although some of the
unannounced components are, indeed, revolutionary); it's the entire
distributed home computing/Internet environment and experience that
will be revolutionary as it rolls out over the coming year. DON'T
JUST FOCUS ON BOXES AND OPERATING SYSTEMS! (sorry for shouting.)
{p} {p}
So, to those of you raising legitimate technical concerns, we will do
our best to communicate solutions as they are worked out. Better
yet, help us track down those solutions.  Linux is getting better
every week, with issues getting resolved at an amazing pace. ATI may
not be able to ship their new graphics/video accelerator (which looks
great) on time, and rest assured that we're also looking at 3dfx and
NVidea. Yes, there will be a floppy drive (probably a 1.44MB / 120MB
combo). We're working on the sound/MIDI requirements.  We're
listening to proactive suggestions, and will do our best to manage
the inevitable tradeoffs to create the best next-generation system we
can.
{p} {p}
To the small number of individuals who have been sending vulgar,
threatening hatemail because you don't like what we're doing, and
have announced that you're fed up and are leaving the Amiga
community, goodbye. Millions and millions of people will purchase
Amiga-branded and Amiga-compliant products over the coming years,
and we're sorry you won't be among them.
