Gather round conspiracy-seekers, because this month's theme is for you.
From UFOs to the Haarp project, there's enough X-Files type stuff flying
around here to keep you busy until the mother-ship lands. All sites
take themselves very seriously as regards their seeking after of the
truth, and should be viewed with an open enquiring mind.
{p} {p}
But, IS it real? I leave that for YOU to decide...

A new Uk site, parts of it still under construction, they are devoted in
the disimination of information on UFOs, aliens, and the like, in a
non-bias manner. With reports from eye-witnesses (sign up as one),
sightings, reports, Armageddon theories (or scams, as the case may be),
and research into borderline scientific fields, it's a sight with some
potential as it grows.

it? We don't really know, but check out this site and you can look over

Up in Alaska is a very real military project consisting of a field of
large antennae. Based on the research of a doctor, the US government
says it's purpose is innocent enough, yet the actual possibilities of
what it can do range from death rays flashing across the world to
weather manipulation (remember the recent El Nino?). To learn the full
story just follow the link.

This site is the motherload of all things UFO. The master of this site
has used the Freedom of Information Act to unheardof extremes in mailing
out requests to all agencies of the US government in his efforts to pry
out their secrets. His continually updating efforts are what spawned
this site.
{p} {p}
Aside from online access to all the docs he has so far obtained via the
Freedom of Information Act, he has several other categories for your
conspiracy viewing. First, we start with Space Images & Phenomena.ck
holes and galaxies, to images from the Hubble telescope and what some
DSP satellites may have picked up in the way of UFO activity, these
photos are about the most tame things you'll find in this site.
{p} {p}
An entire section is devoted just to military craft, including a photo
or two probably not seen on any other site. ever hear of the Snowbird?
well, you can see it right here.
{p} {p}
Care to get into UFO tracking yourself? Well, tips are given here to
produce the best pictures you can should one happen by, as well as
suggestions for making you a passable UFo photo-op hunter. Some
galleries of reader photos are here to wet your appetite.
{p} {p}
Then we have the Other category, wherein you can find extensive archives
of some strange delvings into the UFO mysteries. Add to this a section
on how to help search for ETs in your own home, and this site merits
serious consideration for any UFO enthusiast.
{p} {p}
Not a bad site for a guy that just graduated High School.
