RubiCube is a computer version of the world famous puzzle toy a Rubiks
Cube also known as a "Magic Cube" accourding to the documents. If it is
not called either of those in your country then it is the little square
with coloured sections which you have to rotate and twist to get each
side the same colour.

This is a brilliant conversion. It has a 3D cube which you can rotate
to see each angle and you can also see it turning if you move a section.
{p} {p}
The idea as explained earlier is the get all the matching colours on
the one side. I've never actually completed one of these in real life
and I didn't manage to complete this computer one. I have come to the
conclusion that they are impossible but I do know they are not, just
my bad luck.

The only major problem is that the game is all in German which doesn't
effect the playing but you won't beable to understand any of the
menu titles if you do not speak German.

I suggest everyone who liked the original puzzle and is into puzzle
games should take a look at this great game if you can speak German
or not. Excellent!
