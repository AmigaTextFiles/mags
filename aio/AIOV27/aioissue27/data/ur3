Voimariini is yet another HTML editor, but this is quite nice, although in very
early state. But this one can be a very nice competitor and it's NOT a WYSIWYG
editor!

The installation is very simple, just start the installerscript, and it's installed
within a minute! No hassle at all.

When you start it, you will see a little MUI window, with a toolbar, and a
HTML view/HTML editor. You can then edit any html file and just press on a button
to change so you can see how it looks like, all in one program...
{p} {p}
There isn't really so much to say about the usage, if you have seen a HTML editor
before, then this is quite like it... It handles quite alot of HTML codes in the
builtin "browser"...
{p} {p}
It's also catalogized, and it comes with catalogs in German and French!
{p} {p}
Oh, one nice thing, it's 100% written in assembler!! That's not bad at all!
{p} {p}
If you are waiting to hear something bad about this, then you will, the docs
aren't so nice at all...
