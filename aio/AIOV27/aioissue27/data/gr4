Time Bombs is the second game this month to be featured in this issue of
AIO from Engine Nine Design. The other game featured is {bold}HangMister{nobold} and
also last issue we reviewed {bold}WBPerplexity{nobold} so E9 are not a
company unknown to us. All their previous games I have seen have been to
a top quality with only maybe one or two being less than average but overall
so far they have a good record, lets see how Time Bombs is shaping up...
{p} {p}
The idea behind Time Bombs is that "a virus as infectious as a cold but as
deadly as the plague" has swept through the land killing nearly everyone in
sight, and you guessed it, you survived (lucky you, huh?!) - As in most
governments they are into cover ups and saving their own backs so the
nasty bunch of government officials have decided to airstrike over the
diseased areas wiping out everyone including healthy people like yourself.
{p} {p}
The plot is to escape from each region before the government wipe you
off the face of the planet indefinitely. The idea to escaping is to
collect the set number of keys for that level and then find the magic
teleporter which will take you to another level meaning you have to
do the same over again or learn your future the hard way. As you progress
through the levels there are either more keys to discover or they are
in harder places and you have to be more cunning to find them.
{p} {p}
The music in the game is great. It keeps you entertained while you play
but in the end you'll possibly not notice the music down to being sucked
into the addictive gameplay. The game is viewed from a type of isometric
view which adds to the feel of the game. This means the controls will take
a bit of getting used to because of the way you view your player.
{p} {p}
The graphics of the game are a unique style. I'm sure most of them fit
into the view but some just look out of place for the isometric view of
the game. Another bad point I noticed is that an isometric view of a
building will go upwards covering squares you can walk on behind the
building but in theory you {italic}should{noitalic} beable to walk on these
sqaures even though you can't see them. This is because the view of the building
blocks them out if you understand what I mean. This is just a little
niggle but one that would need to be sorted out for maximum isometric
style gameplay.
{p} {p}
The actual graphics are done quite nicely except the main character who
you control needs a bit of work because he looks like he is desperate
to go and find a toilet and not to save his own life.
{p} {p}
Overall from what I have seen of the game it looks quite nice. I'm sure
if you want to see a review of the full registered version then pester
the author on the below email address to supply us with a copy.

Lastly after speaking to the author he said he would be glad of any offers to
do some improved graphics for the game so if anyone is interested then
I suggest you contact him.
