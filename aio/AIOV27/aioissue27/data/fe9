Review by Chris Seward

{p} {p}

The Wanderer is a CD by the famous Amiga musician, {bold}Jogeir Liljedahl{nobold}
It is a compilation of 14 songs which enlighten some of his older songs
mixed with some of his newer ones. The first thing that strikes you is how
professional the CD looks on the outsides. The packaging is just like any
other professionally made CD that you would find in your local record shop.
The cover has a full colour abstract type design which is enlarged and printed
through the CD back and cover.
{p} {p}
Although this may not seem important it makes the CD very professional and
you can see the work that has gone into this CD even before we have talked
about any of the musical content.
{p} {p}
The 14 songs on the CD are all of a similar style, most are easy listening
but have alot of variety to make each song unique. The first few seconds
of the CD I played I could tell that this was going to be something
special and it truely is. Gone are the days of thumping techno or hardcore
songs but a pleasant CD full of relaxing and meaningful tunes.
{p} {p}
My overall view of this CD is disbelief in the quality of the work and
what the songs do to your emotions and feelings. The work on the CD
brings you to life and tells a story which you can feel and interpret
in your own way. I don't know if the title of the CD has any meaning to
the songs contained but to me it felt like these songs where actually
following a Wanderer. You get a mixed selection of joyful tunes and also
enlightening tunes which to me was fantastic and is something to be heard.
{p} {p}
The total CD time is 57:09 so you are getting a similar amount of songs
that you would on any CD you have bought from a record shop. The songs
contained are all musical with no lyrics and this makes for a peaceful
listening CD so it is surely not for any of you banging, thumping sound
freaks. It will however for the rest of us be a truely magnificent
experience and one you should make sure you share by purchasing this.
{p} {p}
Alot of CDs that have been produced on computers, especially the Amiga
suffer from that computer sound and normally have bad recordings or have
had little time spent on them including design and the actual tunes on
the CD but this one is a spectacle to been seen. It is one of the best
computer generated CDs that i've listened to in my time and the music
sounds like any professional artists would.
{p} {p}
As I stated earlier the whole CD consists of easy listening songs which
you can lie back to, close your eyes and picture what the song means
to you in your head. I think this CD sums up life and this is what I
felt when listening to the music, it really plays on your emotions going
from sad songs to happy songs which you can actually relate to situations
that have happened in your own life.
{p} {p}
I really don't think I can do justice with this review, there are no
words beautiful enough that can describe this CD and I feel I cannot
express enough how brilliant this CD is. No song is bad, I really
enjoyed listening to them all and have been listening to it everywhere.
{p} {p}
The way I have described this CD can not sum up the quality of the work
that has gone into all the tunes on this CD. I don't think there are
words that can describe it. It may be hard to take my word for it but
I honestly suggest with all my heart that you consider buying this CD
as you will not regret it.
{p} {p}
Jogeir Liljedahl deserves to be recognised for his work because it is
out of this world.
{p} {p}
Lets take a look at a few of the songs...
{p} {p}
04 : {bold}Guitar Slinger{nobold}
{p} {p}
This song is one of the more joyful songs which has a constant guitar
presence through the song. As with all these songs they bring out a
certain feeling that is close to your heart and I think that this will
make you picture whatever you are feeling. The best way I can describe
it is a happy family sitting down for an afternoon meal when everyone
is laughing and the children are playing. The summer has arrived and
this has brought joy to the world. All wars have stopped and peace
is on the top agenda for everyone through the world. It makes you get
away from the reality of real life.
{p} {p}
The first few minutes of the song are quick paced and rush through and
then it slows down as if a sunset on a lazy day. The guitar has less
of a presence at this point and then the pace picks up again slightly
as the day draws to an ending.
{p} {p}
06 : {bold}Too Far Away{nobold}
{p} {p}
Too Far Away for me is a setting of a sad situation with an unknown
reason that might play close to your own reason. The way I think of
this song is a man who is "Too Far Away" from someone he once loved
but this is the reason to be sad because the person he once loved is
as the title suggests "Too Far Away". The struggle to reach this
person has a great effect on the man but he is happy because he knows
she is in happiness herself which is when the song changes into a
more joyful pace.
{p} {p}
10 : {bold}Imaginative{nobold}
{p} {p}
Imaginative is as the song title suggests to me a place to image. Imagine
your favourite place where you are secure, nothing can hurt you or
the people you love. A big green field where nothing is bad and evil
does not exist. It really takes you away from the stresses of life
and for the time of listening can make you feeling better and come
away with a smile on your face.
{p} {p}
14 : {bold}Bonus Track: The Squirrel{nobold}
{p} {p}
This last track is a bonus track of just 1m39sec in length. If you've
ever heard Flight of the bumblebee then you'll know the type of tune
this is. In Flight of the bumblebee it follows the path of a Bumble
bee buzzing around but in this track it follows the path of a Squirrel
jumping and leaping around from tree to tree, hoping over the ground
and represents the squirrel.
{p} {p}
It is very hard to describe any of the tracks which are on this CD
because they mean something different to everyone. They all take on
a situation that i'm sure will apply to a situation you have been in
once in your life.
