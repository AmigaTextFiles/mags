Zeus 1.2 has been released!
{p} {p}
This landmark release in the Zeus Bulletin Board System series is the
first release from the new development team.  Featuring over one
hundred fixes and improvements, this is a required upgrade for any
dedicated Zeus SysOp!
{p} {p}
For new users, Zeus costs £60 (UK Pounds) and can be obtained as
described by the information at the end of this press release.
{p} {p}
Existing users can upgrade from Zeus version 1.1 to 1.2 for free!
Updates from 1.1 to 1.2 will be emailed to you, or are available for
FidoNet File Request from NBS-Amiga (2:256/607.0) or TKG (2:442/107.0)
or can be downloaded from our web site - further details are, again,
at the end of this press release.

What's been done?
{p} {p}
Please read the history file in the archive for a full list of changes
(although in perhaps too much detail!) but here's a run down on the best
stuff:
{p} {p}
o Bug fixes.  That's what this update was about - and most
subsystems in Zeus have had some removed.
{p} {p}
o ZMailer.  More stable, workarounds for bad OwnDevUnit
implementations, line status support and a smart new icon
system that'll probably annoy most people..  Plus session
security file notes on inbound files!
{p} {p}
o Lines.  The access restrictions now work with both ZMailer
and Connector - so No Answer, Zone Mail Hour, etc., all
work!
{p} {p}
o FileControl.  No CC ("%nn|") worked while there was no user
online, fixed.  And full security checks when doing a file
scan...
{p} {p}
o Messages.  ZMP is far better, from AreaFix fixes to
(hopefully) faster operation.  New configuration keywords
like MaxBundleSize provide even better handling of the
Outbound directory.
{p} {p}
o Utilities.  Logger works, and Control is more stable
and system friendly..
{p} {p}
o Rexx Utilities.  New and improved ARexx utilities, like
FileLister.rexx.
{p} {p}
o Documentation.  ALL of the several hundred ARexx commands
have been documented!  Better structure too, and you
receive OS3 and OS2-suitable AmigaGuide manuals as well
as in HTML.
{p} {p}
o ZAPP.  It now works!  Featuring faster operation, no jumpy
ANSI, and new servers like PlayIFF.
{p} {p}
o Y2K.  Zeus 1.2 *should* suffer no major problems after
1/1/2000.
{p} {p}
o FileEditor.  Use a separate font for the description view.
{p} {p}
o ANSI.  Change screen mode and palette while online!
{p} {p}
o GUI.  Windows now remember their size and position.
{p} {p}
o DataManager.  This has returned!  For mbzeus message
bases, it will handle the renaming and updating of the
message base data files.
