FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE{p}
July 21st 1999
{p} {p}
The Amiga RC5 Team effort moves up to fifth overall ranking in
statistics
{p} {p}
The Amiga RC5 Team effort has overtaken the Japanese Linux team in the
Distributed.Net/RC5-64 challenge and is now ranked fifth
overall out of over 7000 teams (consisting of an estimated 180,000
participants). The race for the fourth position is now underway, and
we are gaining as fast on the Japanese FreeBSD team as we did on the
Linux team.
{p} {p}
The Amiga RC5 Team effort focuses on bringing exposure to the Amiga and
the community spirit and strives to achieve this by ranking
high in distributed computing projects such as the RC5 and DES
challenges, using otherwise idle computing power only.
{p} {p}
Almost 2000 individuals with about 3500 machines (over half of which are
Amigas) are participating in the Amiga team now, and our
growth continues, the number of PowerPC equipped Amigas for example now
stands at 580 (or about 30% of all Amigas). There is still
plenty of time to participate, as the current search for the RC5-64 key
stands at 10.5% of the keyspace.
{p} {p}
Together with the unfolding plans of Amiga and of course your help, we
hope to increase our momentum and support the rebirth of
Amiga by showing that the community has not deserted the platform in
spite of years of stagnation and setbacks.
{p} {p}
Everyone is cordially invited to join, with any kind of machine, though
one Amiga at least is appreciated. For a full explanation of what
the effort is about, where we are heading, how to participate and
everything from statistics to member listings, please visit the Amiga
RC5 Team effort homepage at {link http://distributed.amiga.org}http://distributed.amiga.org{end}.

The Amiga RC5 Team effort is also providing a mailinglist as a forum for
the discussion on above topics and the effort in general.
