An MP3 Encoder is a program that takes audio files from regular CDs and
makes them into MP3s.
{p} {p}
I will write about Lame and NcodeR, compare them a little, and such...
{p} {p}
Lame can only be used by 040/060/PPC equipped Amigas, while NcodeR can
be used by 030/040/060/PPC
{p} {p}
One note from AmigaAMP M/L, from the author of AmigaAMP... He claims
that Lame produces better quality MP3s, I have tested both extensively,
but I haven't found any differences, it can be though that my speakers
that acts as mids/discants sucks! :)
{p} {p}
Oh well, how long does it take then, well, on my 060 it takes about 55
minutes for both encoders to encode a 3min 30secs MP3 in 128kbits,
44.1KHz and Joint-Stereo. So the speeds for them are about the same.
{p} {p}
NcodeR comes with a real Guide, while Lame doesn't, the reason is
probably that Lame is a port from another system, while NcodeR isn't!
{p} {p}
But one thing that all GUI freaks will like, is that NcodeR supports
GUIs, you can even have skins for them if you want... Lame doesn't have
any kind of GUI, it's 100% CLI based, this will probably be a big
advantage to many people (including me)...
{p} {p}
So, it's very hard to recommend a special Encoder, you have to try them
and see what you like the most... One big advantage Lame has is it's
price, it's free! So Lame will be the best choice according to me...
