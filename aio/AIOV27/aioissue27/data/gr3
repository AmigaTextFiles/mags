HangMister is a version of the age old favourite, HangMan. I'm sure many
will have played hangman on lots of various journeys and also through
out your childhood or are still playing it, thats if your still in your
childhood, see?

The idea of HangMister is exactly the same as hangman. In this case the
computer puts down a certain amount of '_' to coincide with the number
of letters in that certain word or group of words and you have to guess
each letter. If you guess the letter correctly then the letter is placed
over the '_' where that letter exists in the word. If you are wrong
and the letter does not exist then a piece is added to the picture which
will in the end make up a hanging man, meaning gameover.
{p} {p}
You get 10 chances if you got all the letters wrong but you could have
many more each time you guess a correct letter. If you guess correctly
then no piece is added to the hanging man. If on the other hand you
guess wrong then as said above the picture will be built up for each
wrong guess until finally there is a whole picture and its gameover for
you.
{p} {p}
If you guess the whole word correctly then you will be given a different
word. HangMister has the novel feature of grouping the different words
to give you more of a chance. These so far are Bands, Cartoons and
Films but can be added to with your own text file.

Basically this game is hangman, i'm sure you've played it and i'm sure
you've seen many computer versions. The feature I liked most about
HangMister is that as you guess the wrong letters a little animation
shows the actual drawing of the lines and they don't just appear like
in other games which gives the feeling of someone drawing. This game
unfortunately is only for lonely people as there is no two player option.

I guess this game will save many trees by the paper you aren't wasting
but the big question is do we need another hangman game?
