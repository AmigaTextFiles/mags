Back in issue 25 I tested a version of AmiFTPd... But since then there
have been a few new versions, the latest I have tested is 2.0, but I saw
that the updates for 2.1 are published on the website, but the latest
version to download was 2.0! Hmm, weird!
{p} {p}
Ok, I will very briefly explain what AmiFTPd is, and then I will tell
you what's changed since the last review. So, if you want to know more
about AmiFTPd and what I thought/said about the earlier version, please
download {link ftp://de.aminet.net/ftp/aminet/pub/docs/mags/AIOV25.lha}AIO Issue 25{end} and read it there.

AmiFTPd is a FTP Daemon, which lets you run an FTP site on your Amiga,
where you can let people log in and Upload/Download files to/from you...
{p} {p}
Ok, the biggest change in AmiFTPd is that it is split up in several
files, one file is the actual Daemon, and then you have GUI files... As
of now only MUI exists, but there will come a BGUI version too... So,
what's the big advantage with this you say, well, you can ofcourse start
the GUI without the Daemon being loaded if you only want to set some
configs or so, and ofcourse, you can also only run the daemon if you
don't care what the users do, thus saving some memory!
{p} {p}
Another great improvement is that you can Monitor what the user does,
see what dir he is in, what the latest command he sent was, which file he
downloads, how much he have downloaded and so on... Very nice!
{p} {p}
There is also a new setting, where you can choose how many simultaneus
sessions every user can have, and how many simultaneus sessions every
IP can have!
{p} {p}
And ofcourse, there is also some bugs fixed!
{p} {p}
That is what's new from 1.8 to 2.0... I haven't been able to test 2.1,
but here's what it should contain whenever it arrives:
{p} {p}
· Passive transfer support implemented.{p}
· Fixed AmiFTPdMUI GUI VFS configuration oddity where default permissions
flag (*) was not displayed/represented properly.{p}
· Fixed bug in resolver code which caused a failed open error when
transfers attempted with Amiga Voyager.{p}
· Added default port setting to general config.
{p} {p}
So, a great program gets even greater!
