We've managed to dig up some info on something that may be of interest
to all Amigan's, being as it deals with Petunia, a module to be
included with the OS4 that deals with emulation of the old CPUs.
You'll find it under "AIOIssue68/Project_Petunia_pages.htm".  Any
copyrights belong to the good people over at the usual Amiga pages.

Happy reading.
