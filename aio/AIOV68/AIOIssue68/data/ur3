Another program to compare two dirs for search differences.I have used this
several times and found it very handy.The author fails to mention you have
to put the save path in when you run it from the icon. I use >ram:"name of file".
{pp}
This program is very usefull for people with several versions of a web page/use
AmigaForever-Amithlon-AmigaXL/to compare version file size and date.
