What's Internet without a browser, but what browser is available for
the maiga that does a complete job?  The answer is none of them, which
is why you have to have a couple lying around.

Voyager is the most all around complete one but it's java script is
minimal at best, and while it supports Flash those Flash pages it
doesn't like it WILL crash on.  Also, when Voyager crashes it goes
straight to reset, bypassing all those nice hacks we all have for
catching such things.  AWeb is missing several features that
Vouyager has but it's java-script support is better that Voyager's,
though not yet optimal.

Of course, AWeb is open-sourced now and Voyager has been under a
constant state of alpha and beta for about the last 3 years or so with
no actual finished update in sight.  IBrowse is finally making
progress and has it's update coming along with OS4, though this update
is still missing Flash and java-script which are promised in the
update after next.  IBrowse at least is under realistic updating but
until it comes out with OS4 you'll have to shuffle back and forth
between Voyager and AWeb.
