Pure Basic is more advanced and flexible then any of the other Basic
programming languages currently on the market and it comes at a
fraction of the price. The beauty of this product is the versatility
though as you can develop your own games and applications on PC
Windows, Linux or even AmigaOS! Speed is another unique selling
point. Where other Basic programming languages crawl at a slow pace
due to complex instruction translations Pure Basic shines by even
outperforming C++ written code. If you ever wanted to program your
own commercial quality games or applications in an easy to learn and
even more easy to use language then this is your chance!
