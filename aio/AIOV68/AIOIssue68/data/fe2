Everyone needs a distraction from life's assorted problems...  Like
for instance the problem with a certain revolutionary OS not coming
out in anything remotely resembling a timely matter.  So, for the
required distraction of such matters, herewith are some distracting
sites...

{bold}Demon's Lair{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.demons-lair.20m.com{noitalic}{p}
A site devoted to, well, demons.  No Satan worshiping here, just a few
images, a dictionary for the occult-curious, and links to other scary
places on the web.  Good look, though could use a tad more content.

In short, everything you wanted to know or see about the Hubble Space

{bold}The Adventures Of The Boy With Immovable Hair{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://members.aol.com/tbwih{noitalic}{p}
Do you want wacky and off the wall?  What about old-fashioned ASCII
art? Okay, now how about ASCII-art cartoon strips?  Well, you'll get
all that and less with the Adventures of the boy with immovable hair
(the central ASCII figure).  Just a nice little bundle of ascii fun
with plenty of downloadables.

{bold}Dr. Daniel's Movie Emergency{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.stairwell.com/doc/{noitalic}{p}
A good place to go to get a movie diagnosed by thegood Dr. Daniel. 
It's not been updated in quite a while but is still good for the tons
of films in it's archives.{pp}
A humorously themed style to movie reviews, with archived reviews for
movies that go back a couple of decades, the site's partitioned off
into suchthings as the Operation Room, the Morgue, Examination Room,
and so on.  Next toss in a few diversions such as a movie trivia quiz.
movie clips, notable quotables, and a movie matching game.  Overall,
not bad though I'd wish he'd get back to updating the site again.
