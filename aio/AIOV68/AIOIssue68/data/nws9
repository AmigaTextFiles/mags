 and I decided to quit any support concering my Amiga software products. This starts
somewhere at DiskSafe and ends in the MuLib package. Hence, if someone's interested in
continuing the development of all or some of my Amiga software packages, there need to
be a new maintainer for them. Conditions are that the software remains maintained and
freely available under licence conditions similar to the one I had. I would *not* agree
to make all this GPL or LGPL."

"Thor" will continue with excellent freeware programs, but on a
different platform. See www.math.tu-berlin.de/~thor/atari++ for
a starter, and more to come in future.
