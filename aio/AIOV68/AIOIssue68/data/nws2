"As of January 2003, the full source code for EdWord is available for
free download (released under the GNU Public License). This release
is thanks in a large part to Magnus Johnson, who helped me copy files
off of my old AmigaDOS disks now that I no longer own an Amiga.
Thanks Magnus! Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to locate the
disk with the latest source code on it, so in the meantime I have
provided the sources for the latest version that I have managed to
recover.

EdWord was written using GFA Basic, so the source code is provided as
a .GFA file. This is a binary file that only GFA Basic can read (it
contains various inlined binary code for things like bitmaps and
machine code implementations of certain critical functions). I will
also provide ASCII versions where possible, though these will not
include the binary sections."
