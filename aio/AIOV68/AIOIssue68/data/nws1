The Butterfly Vale has opened its gates for visitors. The Vale is
your future source for MorphOS ports and high-quality own MorphOS
developments.
{pp}
As for your journey to us, please recall that the Vale is located in
a remote place where the air is still fresh and clean. We would like
to keep it that way and ask you to if possible leave your
power-consuming Pentium switched off and use alternate means of
transportation.
