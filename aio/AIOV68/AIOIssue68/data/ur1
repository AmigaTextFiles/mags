Review
{pp}
  IBrowse has now reached version 2.3 after a long spell
since 2.2 was released by Omnipresence/Hisoft. IBrowse
is a Web Browser and will be released as part of AmigaOS 4.
Its still a 68K program, version 3.0 will be a PPC native
version for AmigaOS 4 but that is a long way off.
{pp}
  IBrowse has been updated with particular attention to
Javascript and other HTML standard, the team have fixed a
lot of bugs and made it more 'complient' with the vast
number of web sites out there.
{pp}
  IBrowse uses the MUI (Magic User Interface) in AmigaOS
to display its windows and buttons and its preferences.
When you launch IBrowse you get a large window with the
standard browser buttons (Back, Forward, Home, Reload,
Load Images, Search) and the Fastlink buttons to quickly
browse to your favourite websites and an Location input
bar to display URL of your current page or allow you to
type in your URL.
{pp}
  IBrowse has several features in the menus such as Bookmarks
to record url of your favourite websites, these are stored in
a HTML file in the progdir: of IBrowse. There are a number
of managers available to manage Cookies, Passwords, Downloads,
URL Clipboard and so on so you can view, delete or modify what
you recieve or use whilst on the web.
{pp}
  Also, you can set up Preferences in IBrowse for all aspects
of web browsing including the ability to individualise specific
web sites such as Banking and Javascript sites, so you can spoof
as another web browser such as Mozilla so the web site thinks
you are using a 'standard' recognised browser used on other
platforms.
{pp}
  Browsing on the web is much better with a lot of sites now
working correctly with IBrowse which may have failed under version
2.2. But not everything is covered, there is still no support
for Flash animations, CSS (Cascade Style Sheets), DOM or Java
(not to be confused with Javascript). Some of these features
will appear in IBrowse 3.
{pp}
  Java on the Amiga has still not appeared after a number of
abortive attempts by Haage-Partner's Merapi and Daytona (author
of Miami TCP/IP dial up software). AmigaOS 4 does not include it
either so we may never see Java unless AmigaDE appears on the
Amiga.
{pp}
  For site security, IBrowse 2.3 now supports the old MiamiSSL
and the new AmiSSL v2 for on line banking and shopping  with
support for a wide number of security protocols. AmiSSL is
available seperately from IOSpirit as a free download.
{pp}
Overall an excellent browser but still has a long way to go
before it reaches the same support on other popular Platforms.
