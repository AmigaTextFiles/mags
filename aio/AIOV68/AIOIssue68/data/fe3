A closeup on the amiga serial and its relevance to the internet....

A lot of amigans use the internet, and its great - sort of like
one big multinational usergroup.  The AmigaOS has no trouble
supporting internet technologies/protocols and so along with
the quality programming of several TCP/IP stacks and html browsers
we have come to take for granted access to the mass of information
(and porn....).  Even now with PCI buses available to the amiga user,
the dial-up or ISDN interface of choice is still the humble serial
port.  Using the standard amiga serial port is rather restricting
at best because of the way in which the custom chipset is tied
together along with the lack of what is called FIFO buffering
(First In First Out).  When internet data streams into your amiga,
the cpu is forced to devote considerable clock time to remaining
in synchronisation with the serial chip in order to fetch the
data.  Because there is a long list of other tasks demanding
time the data is often stalled as the CPU tends to other
tasks.  This causes additional issues a s servers timeout your
connection.  To put it bluntly, your internet experience is
hammered by a total inefficiency when it comes to fetching the
files off an internet server.

A time long before amiga developers cottoned on (a story which
sadly holds true for virtually the entire amiga hardware market,
which isnt really our fault) there has existed a solution to the
above problem.  Smart peeps have added FIFO buffering to the Serial
controller, which, in case you havent guessed it already, buffers
incoming data - typically to 16 bytes for each direction of data
(16 for send and 16 for receive).  What this means, is that instead
of having to having to sit at the door of the controller for every
byte, it only says hi every 16 bytes - allowing the cpu to devote
clock cycles whilst 16 bytes of data is collected, then it is burst
transferred by the cpu into a system memory block where it can be
then processed by the internet application that requested it.  16 bytes
doest seem like much when you are downloading 5 kilobytes a second
(5x 1024 bytes a second), but when you consider that before it was
having to fetch every byte individually you can appreciate the dra
matic increase in efficiency and therefore the reduction in effective
CPU load that the task of fetching the data gives.

Before my amiga system had a FIFO serial port (which was a clockport Serial from
Individual computers) my homepage took several minutes to load, and
often images would fail to load because the connection timed out.  With
the newer port in use, the page took under 30 seconds to load with all
images successful every time.  Those without RTG cards notice it even
more because the custom chipset lags heavily when using the internal
serial port and as a result the OCS/EcS/AGA gfx crawls slower than it
normally does.

When I am asked to install an internet setup onto an
amiga system I always recommend both the newer serial port and an RTG
card, when the client takes me advice their jaw literally drops when
they see the improvement.  "My amiga surfs faster than the PCs" is
common because the amiga now has equivalent data fetching technology
it comes down to a battle of the software and we all know which
Operating System is the greatest :-)
