Today e.p.i.c. interactive started shipping the Empire Builder Knights & Merchants, 
which is now the first commercially available game for MorphOS. Knights & Merchants
retails at EUR49,95 and requires a Pegasos with 600 Mhz, 64 MByte RAM and MorphOS 1.0
or better. More information on this Real Time Strategy game can be found in the projects
section of our homepage at http://www.epic-interactive.com.

Knights & Merchants can be described as a strategic economy simulation. In the main,
the economics play a major role in this real-time action game. The player can
manufacture different products, making use of numerous buildings and producer goods
of the Middle Ages period. He can use his serfs to construct and maintain buildings
and roads. The economical structuring is very specific. You manufacture finished
products using various raw materials which go through your production processes.
All these manufacturing systems are highly detailed and visually understandable,
enabling fast and dependable control of your economy. One result of all your productive
labors is the manufacture of weapons and armor. But the logistics, too, are really worth
a mention. You decide where and how merchandise will be transported on the network of
streets which you yourself have planned and constructed. Your serfs transport all wares
between buildings, so your town planning plays a major role in production time per
building, and, resulting from that, just how efficient your economy as a whole is going to be.

Transported goods are displayed graphically. Each figure in the game has his/her own mission
area and carries out individual tasks independently. They don´t depend on your commands or
actions. You, the player, only give indirect commands for the construction of buildings,
streets, corn fields, etc. However, you do have complete control of the military units.
Dealers please contact GTI/Schatztruhe.
