Warrior, Wizard or Survivor? Which fate is yours? It's your decision, one that
will influence the gameplay of Divine Divinity playable as an action based RPG
or a classical RPG! According to prophecy, you are the chosen one. Only you have
the strength, the courage and the magic to save the legendary lands of Rivellon
from submission under the Lord of Chaos. Before you can take on the fight against
Evil, you must journey far through a fantastic world torn apart by corruption,
sinister plots and dark magic. Caution is vital! Whatever happens, the evil magicians
of the black ring must not get hold of you!

With an involving storyline and plenty of sub quests for maximum replayability, Divine
Divinity is role-playing gaming at its best! As a warrior, wizard or survivor, you will
create your own destiny!
