{subhead}The Chaos serial (Chaos I-IV){def}{p}
Review by John Smith

{pp}
  The reason why I describe the previous versions of Chaos game is because
there is a mode of playing in the Chaos IV called 'classic Chaos', featuring
the rules that were introduced in the Chaos I (with a few exceptions), and
there are also numerous similarities with other versions.So, pay attention.
{pp}
{bold}Chaos (Chaos I, the original Chaos, board strategy by Games Workshop){nobold}
{pp}
  Original Chaos game has been published by Games Workshop in 1985.It is
a very simple game:2..8 wizards, some of them led by a computer (possibly
even all of them) are battling against each other.At the beginning, they
all possess some 14..20 randomly selected spells.By casting them, they
create creatures that fight for them, or objects that might protect them
or help them in their task of defeating their enemies.
{pp}
  Every creature possess some personal attributes that make them usefull
in a wide variety of ways.There are standard attributes that all creatures
have, like combat, defence, movement allowance, magic resistance, manoeuvre
rating, ranged combat strength and range for ranged combat.Only elfs, centaurs,
manticores and dragons have the ability to shoot from the distance. There are
also some nonstandard specialties: some creatures are undead (vampires, wrights,
ghosts, zombies, skeletons) and therefore unattackable by living creatures, some
can fly (eagles, dragons, harpies, bats, pegasi, gryphons), some are transparent
(wrights, ghosts) and can be shot through, some are mountable by a wizard,
therefore offering him protection from all sorts of attack and faster mean of
transportation (horses, centaurs, manticores, unicorns, pegasi, gryphons).
{pp}
  A creature standing nearby an enemy creature is engaged in a combat with
it, and may not move further, unless it has high manoeuvre rating (and some
luck) that would help him to get away (pegasi, gryphons and unicorns are
especially good in this task, since their purpose is mainly to offer protection
and mobility for the wizard, as well as some formidable attacking power).
{pp}
  There is also one attribute that every creature in Chaos I possessed, and
which doesn't exist anymore in the Chaos IV in the same way as it is in Chaos I
(why not?): it is the 'casting chance'.
{pp}
  For the dragons (grenn, red and golden), that value is only 10%, meaning that
a wizard, who tries to create a dragon has only 10% chance of succeding in it's
endeavour.Generally, the stronger creatures have lower casting chance and
are harder to summon.  A wizard may possess some skills and those may highten
the casting chance of all his spells for 10 or 20%.More to that, a spell
may be chaotic, lawfull or neutral.Successfull casting of a chaotic spell
increases the level of chaos in the world by 10 or 20%, which means that
all chaotic spells will be 10 or 20% easier to cast in the next turn by
all wizards.Successfull casting of lawfull spells reverses the effect.As
a summary, either chaotic or lawfull spells may have more chance in
succeding in the next turn, and should be taken into account during the
spell selection phase.During this phase, a wizard may also choose to
cast the spells as an *illusion*, in which case the casting chance is
100% (good for dragons), but the creature may be destroyed by a 'disbelieve'
spell, which is the only spell that may be cast unlimited number of times.
{pp}
  If a living creature get killed, it's corpse remains on board and may
be resurrected as an undead with the 'raise dead' spell.After an undead,
or an illusion dies, nothing remains.There is one important trick with
the corpses that a skillfull wizard may use to his advantage: a creature
which is destroyed with some magical attacking spell (dark power, justice,
decree) while it stands above the corpse, turns into the creature whose
corpse it stands upon.For example, by magically destroying your own orc
(weak creature) who is standing above a golden dragon's corpse you'll get
yourself a golden dragon! There are also 'chaos' and 'law' spells which
do nothing except influencing the overall state of the world.
{pp}
  A wizard may cast a wood (magic or shadow), consisting of 8 trees.Shadow
wood's trees may attack the enemy creature that stands nearby them, but
may not engage him in combat.Magic wood serves as a shelter for wizard.
{pp}
  There are also sheltering spells (magic castle, dark citadel, magic wood)
that offer a complete protection for wizard that hides in them, but only for
a few turns (they spontaneuosly desintegrate after several turns).In Chaos IV,
a wizard gets new spells due to his time spent in meditation while inside
the protective walls, but that isn't the case in Chaos I, except for the
magic wood's trees.
{pp}
   Some spells tend to spread themself (fire, blob).Fire might be extinguished
if a rain falls, but creatures have no defence against it.Blob swallows enemy
creatures if it spreads over it.Spreading is done automatically by a computer
at the beginning of each turn.Blob, however,might be attacked and destroyed,
and a captured creature may be rescued.Again, here is a hint that experienced
player may use to their advantage: if an illusion is rescued from blob, it
becomes alive! You may get real dragons this way with some luck.However, blobs
and fires don't spread over creatures of your own wizard, so you'll have to use
an enemy wizard's blob for this purpose.
{pp}
  Finally, there are spells that influence the attributes of a casting
wizard to his advantage (magic armour, magic shield, magic sword, magic
knife, magic wings, shadow form and magic bow).Magic weapons also allow
the wizard to attack the undeads.
{pp}
  I must add that Chaos I is one of the very few games that has survived on
my desktop for more than 15 years, and I still regularly play it (the game
lasts only about 5..10 minutes and is very relaxing).As for the Chaos IV, it
has been the most downloaded and the most highly marked file on the Aminet
for quite some time.The magic theme has always been interesting.
{pp}
  ZX Spectrum version of the game can be found at:  {link ftp://ftp.nvg.unit.no/pub/spectrum/snaps/games/}ftp://ftp.nvg.unit.no/pub/spectrum/snaps/games/{end}
{pp}
or on some other ftp site devoted to ZX Spectrum games.  You will also need
an emulator to play the game.Some of them can be found there as well.
