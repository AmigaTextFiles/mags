{subhead}Beneath a Steel Sky* (adventure by Revolution Software), adf & CD32 versions{def}{p}
Review by John Smith

{pp}
  Beneath a Steel Sky is a 'point & click' adventure, featuring the 'virtual
theatre' concept of play, also implemented in a 'Lure of the Temptress' game
(another Revolution Software game, also available on the Arena CD).In this
concept characters appearing in the game 'have their own life'.They move
around independently, doing their regular jobs and assignments and even talk
to each other (in a 'Lure of Temptress' you can sit and listen for hours stupid
dialogs between a merchant and his customers, while in the 'Beneath of Steel
Sky' dialogs between independent characters tend to contain important hints
for the game (but more about it later).This concept first appeared in the
ancient game Hobbits on the ZX Spectrum when it was quite a revolution.
Today it is a standard for a good game, but since 'Beneath a Steel Sky' is
almost a decade old game, I thought that I had to mention that it was among the
few adventure games implementing this standard at the time it was released.

  There are 2 flavours of the game available on the CD: adf & CD32 one.The
difference is that CD32 version has speech, while the adf version only has
a classic bubbles for conversations between characters (as in the comic books).
{pp}
  adf version (15 disks) has inside itself a rather cumbersome HD installer:
to install the game you actually MUST have 15 floppy disks available.It assumes
that you have bought a game on 15 floppy disks (and not on a CD or something else)
and it requires to see them all in the df0: unit, before even attempting an
installation! It also blocks the workbench completely, preventing you from using
RAD: masked as a df0: or some similar technique.Anyway, as at the end it turns
out that it simply copies all of the files from the floppies into a single
directory on the HD, you can avoid the harrasment, by doing that by yourself
manually, and not attempting the 'automatic' installation.

  During the intro scene you observe a helicopter crash, and a person escaping
from it.That person is you, Robert Foster.You find yourself in a highly
mechanized world, full of robots (actually helicopter has crashed on some
factory located in a tall building, and you are inside it).Your first aim
is to avoid security officers that are trying to catch you, and then to
find out who you are, why are you there, and what is going on in general.
To do that a lot of conversation is needed, and a nice thing about game is
that all important words in a someones sentence are written in BIG letters,
indicating improtant stuff quite efficiently ("I'm a robot WELDER.").The
game actaully bear a great resemblance to a modern Japan, and a main character
(you, Robert Foster) looks remarkably as a Samurai, both by the cloths that
he wears and by his strong masculine shape.Well, at least it does to me.
(I have seen a few other Japanese games, and I'm pretty sure that the coding
style, the overall impression of the game, and the required style for playing
are pretty much matching that pattern).
{pp}
  Graphics are rich and well done.There are many SMALL important details,
and you should search every screen picture thoroughly to avoid skipping
something important that may lie hidden around.Your area for movement is
usually restricted to only few screens, so it may not be too difficult as
it may sound.As for the sound, since you are in the factory, there are all
sorts of techno sounds around (i.e. clanging and humming of various machinery
around).And, as mentioned before, CD32 version has speech as well.
{pp}
  Being in a building, your first aim is to get out of it, but it isn't
easy, since there are many security officers around that are trying to
capture you, and, knowing that you are there somewhere, are actively
searching for you.Moreover, the crashed  helicopter has blocked the exit
from the building, and the elevator is not only broken and out of order,
but you also don't have the permission to use it, and it doesn't go all
the way down anyway.Whenever you manage to solve another in the serie of
puzzling tasks presented to you, you will be one step closer to your freedom.
