finishing up OS4is only the start.  New programs need to be written
and ported to have a complete platform, but since our market is rather
small, those programs will only be written if enough people request
them and start requesting {italic}now.{noitalic}  I'm not talking
flaming the nice people at Amiga for why don't they have this or that
program on the horizon, but merely informaing them of the interest. 
Me, i think there's a certain minimum portfolio that's required.

First, definitely DTP stuff. A good word processor that we can all
port our old Wordworth and FinalCopy files into.  The best option
would be an Office suite, including a good WYSIWYG, database, and
spreadsheet.  More advanced DTP software would be optional, but the
above is the minimum.

Next is programming.  Two minimum requirements here.  A good C++
compiler for the upper end programmers, then for the holiday
programmers some form of BASIC.  In both cases the acceptable syntax
should have a high degree of compatibility with the equivalent in use
on other platforms (Visual basic compatibility comes to mind). We'll
leave out Java programming until the OS itself is ready to handle it.

A full suite of internet software is a given, but as that's already
been mentioned as being worked on then let's move on (but let's not
forget to include the whole FTP, Telnet, and IRC).

I lot of people input pictures and even sound into their machines, so
a good GUI for using all those great flatbed scanners ou7t there is
required, and maybe even a good audio digitizer interface (for that
audio hardware we'll be getting off the PC shelves for the nice
industry-standard slots our new machines will then have). Something to
thumbnail and cataloge the images would be a nice and easy to make
addition.
{pp}
Games?  Well, let's face it; {bold}someone's{nobold} going to be
bringing over a few games so no worry there at all.
{pp}
These would be absolute minimums for a good program suite. If you have
your own personal favorites then email Amiga and see if they can find
someone to do the job, but remember that there's only so many
programmers available and just so much time.  Make sure what you want
would be considered a good basic and not a "well, it would be
{italic}nice{noitalic} if...".  We'll save those other niceties for
when OS5 approaches.
