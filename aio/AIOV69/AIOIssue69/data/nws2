"Late last year, Amiga announced its intention to launch AmigaOS4.0 at the CeBIT show
in Germany. Since then, the project has advanced into its final stages but unfortunately
not to the point where we are ready to ship. We have thus decided not to attend the 
Cebit Germany show. Instead we are looking at other shows and opportunities in the near 
future to provide a suitable platform for the launch of the new Amiga.
We apologize to the commmunity for waiting until the last possible moment to make this 
announcement but despite heroic efforts by all concerned, even up to the last minute, 
circumstances have conspired to push completion beyond the deadline. We have regretfully 
decided that making CeBIT Germany the AmigaOS 4 launch platform is not a realistic 
option at present.

AmigaOS4.0 is coming. Beta-testing has been going on since last September, the Club 
Amiga Magazine is previewing many of the new features and AmigaOne integration is 
proceeding well. Amiga, Hyperion and Eyetech are 100% committed to getting the new 
platform out into the world and reintroducing the world to the pleasures of home 
computing.
