The Huddersfield Amiga User Group has postponed the Alt-WoA 2003. The Amiga show had
originally been scheduled for 26th April 2003 in Huddersfield, Great Britain, and
will now take place on an as yet undisclosed weekend on the occasion of the release
of AmigaOS 4.0. Further information about this has not yet been announced.
