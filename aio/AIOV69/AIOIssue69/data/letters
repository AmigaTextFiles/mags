Hi Mark,{p}
       I've been pronouncing it -- Ahhhhmigahhhh -- in a desperate tone! ;-)
Will that AmigaOne 'ever' showup?
{pp}
       Since the January set back, I started looking into other areas
for diversion. The biggest endeavor for me was WinUAE. Since OS4
was to be dalayed and not neccessarily ready when the A1 was, the
possibility of an AmigaOne and LinusUAE was the alternative system.
I have an email from the Yahoo A1users group and someone who
bootsup in OS3.9. OK, that sounds good to me, too!

   Most of February was getting a WinUAE system going. Somehow,
I came across: {link http://aiab.emuunlim.com/}Jaybee's AmigaInABox! (http://aiab.emuunlim.com){end}
Wow, did that change everything! All I had to do was make two .adf
files of Kickstart3.1 and a OS3.1 bootable Workbench to get going.
James Battle's "Amiga In A Box" lives up to it's name. An amazing OS
for PC with loads of Amiga programs: Scalos workbench, DirectoryOpus,
WizArc, GoldEd, jsut to name a few. In his Internet package, there is
Voyager, AmIRC, mFTP, and StrICQ. Voyager worked the first time on
line!

   So for March, I looked at AIO's Issue# 68 for the first time -- not in my
Amiga! It looked good. Everything was just as I'm used to seeing on the
old A2000. The big difference is speed -- woosh! I think '040 at 200mHz
as a rough 'guesstimate.' I was quite pleased with this project. For the
added surprise, I tryed the Aminet download link in the Utilitities section.
The program "DirSScompare" sounded good so I downloaded that.
Woosh, it worked! AIO Issue #68 was quite an intersting reading. I think
Neil Williams and Linus Atkesson did a nice job on IO interface of this
issue of AIO -- as well as you and the staff for putting it together.
AIO is fabulous!
