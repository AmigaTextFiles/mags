Review by John Smith

{pp}
  TotalChaosAGA is actually a v4 version of the Chaos IV.Previous versions
were ChaosLite (5.7 Mb, less music), and HeavyChaos (16.1 Mb, more music),
both available on the Aminet.The differences between them and the TotalChaos
can be found inside their coresponding .readme files on the Aminet.Mostly,
those are bugfixes, spell number enlargement, changes in graphics and
system requirements, and adding of more and more and even more music.

  Hint:If you wan't to speed up the game on the account of disabling
sounds, do the following: start your favourite .mod in a loop play
before starting the Chaoss game (you can do that, for example, by
using the play button in DOpus).The game will start without a problem,
but, since the audio chanells are already blocked, it won't be able
to play any of it's tunes and sounds, thus resulting in a much faster
execution.You don't have to wait the sounds to finish, therefore the game
plays much faster.However, you have music since your favourite .mod is
being played over and over again by DOpus or some similar software.Nice!

  Since I have already described a lot about this game, I'm only going
to tell you about the specialties of Chaos IV.It has vast number of spells
available for wizards to use and music, sound and spell usage are very
configurable.However, it has very poor graphics (as the authors say, "the
third dimension has been destroyed in previous battles, and now only two
remain").It also introduces the possibility for playing wizards to (officially)
ally with each other and fight as a team, meaning that their creatures won't
engage each other if they approach each other.Allying with the computer led
wizards is also possible.

  The game contains numerous hidden 'features' (or quirks, or bugs), that
only very experienced player may successfully utilize to his advantage,
while the novices would be taken by surprise.I have encountered at least
30 of those hidden discrepancies from the rules while playing the game,
but I won't tell you any of them.Explore by yourself!

  The only thing that really bothers me with this game is that when you
lose you get yourself a full 'Game Over' screen which stands there until
you decide if you want to play again, but when you win, the program prints
at the bottom left corner 'Team ? wins.' (using the topaz 8 font), the message
stays there for less than 3 seconds, then you are presented with some overall
statistics of who survived and who got himself killed, and thats it! No
congratulations, no high score tables, no hall of fames, not even a
descent acknoweldgment of your victory! It is like the software authors
take as a personal insult, if someone has menage to accomplish a victory
when playing with their software.Such attitude is the reason for the
lower overall rating, as you can see below.Everyone plays to win, and
those who aren't rewarded for their victory with a few nice words at
least are simply being harrased as I think.Especially if they were
playing against their computer only.
