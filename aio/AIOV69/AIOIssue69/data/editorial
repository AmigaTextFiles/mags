Well, we have another new editor.  John Smith is our brand new Games
Editor and boy does he have a lot of experience with games.  One
wonders where he found the time for the {italic}rest{noitalic} of his
life.  welcome aboard John!

In other news, still no OS4.  We realize that some revolutions take
time, but this is starting to get annoying.  Just one little
Winblowing OS is all we ask for, and sometime before Spring is up
would be nice.  Then it's time to shop for a whole bunch of new toys.

Of course the OS wars don't help much.  All that talent split up
amongst the two or three other claims to the Amiga successor is a
definite slow-down to the process.  Wouldn't it be nice if the MorphOS
and PegOs crowds just teamed up with Amiga?  We'll worry about healthy
competition when our little prize toy CAN compete with the big nasty real
world outside.
