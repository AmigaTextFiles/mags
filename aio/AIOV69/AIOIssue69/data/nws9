It is already known that Hyperion Entertainment plan to re-master a number of their
games following the official launch of the AmigaOne. However, there is a strong desire
for other games to be re-mastered with Amiga Games Hit Parade running a poll to determine
which games people would like to see re-mastered for the AmigaOne.
{pp}
The results so far seem to encompass a diverse range of genres including hit games such
as Turrican 2 at number 1, followed by Alien Breed 3D 2, Frontier Elite 2, Speedball 2
and Hunter. Classic games have also climbed high in the chart like Defender Of The Crown,
Gods, Shadow Of The Beast, and Stunt Car Racer.
