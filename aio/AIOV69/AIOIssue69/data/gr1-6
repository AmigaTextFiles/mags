  Another adventure from the Revolution Software, older than Beneath a Steel Sky,
but also having the 'virtual theatre' game scheme implemented.It is also well
designed game, with smooth graphics, humorous conversations (in a Secret of the
Monkey Island style) and an interesting plot.It isn't to easy too be solved
immediately, and not too hard to be abandoned at the start.Quite recommendable.
I have included a small thumbnail picture for you to see, and I think this will
be enough for you to try the game.

for you to solve, a complete solution is available at
