On march 29th, the Amiga-show AmiGBG will take place. The event takes place for the
third time this year, and we'll attend for the first time as an exhibitor. We will
present new and known products from our palette together with our long-term partner
 GGS-Data. The scandinavian Amiga-community is very active and most notably creative,
therefore we're especially looking forward to this event!
With a little luck, we'll have our latest product in our luggage: After an extremely
long wait, the soundcard Delfina went into production. Nearly one year ago, we announced
the last technical changes, that are already outdated today. The most important change
is probably the split of the product into two boards. The updated product description
confirms what many people already assumed since the Catweasel MK3 PCI/Flipper is out:
The new Delfina is a combined Zorro/PCI card. The first stage of this high-end
soundcard will be available in Germany starting April 7th, 2003. Pre-orders are
taken by our retail partners.
