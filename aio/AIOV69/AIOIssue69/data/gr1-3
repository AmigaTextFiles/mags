{subhead}Space Chaos (Chaos II, board strategy by Games Workshop){def}{p}
Review by John Smith

  To continue with the serial, next game in a row was Chaos II (also known
as 'Space Chaos', the game was basically completely the same setup as in
Chaos I, but with completely different set of spells.The idea was that it
was a battle of wizards in a space, and they wore scafanders and cast robotic
spells.Robots usually had more shooting power, and the game was therefore
deadlier and not so much fun to play.In fact, it was quite poor, and with
uglier graphics.Interesting characteristic of this game is that, among other
creatures, there was also a 'Sir Clive' (strong as a dragon).For those
who aren't informed, Sir Clive Sinclair is a creator of ZX Spectrum,
and at the time of a game (the golden age of ZX Spectrum), he was as
famous in computer industry, as Bill Gates is today.There were also C3PO,
R2D2 (robots from 'Star Wars'), and other robots from different movies.
Vampires were only creature that remained from Chaos I (as far as I recall),
but were graphically redesigned into a quite ugly form.

  As remnants from this missventure there are so called 'artifacts' in
Chaos IV.These are two kinds of robots (one with strong shooting capabilities,
and one without them but with formidable strength).They lie around at the
begining of game, broken (i.e. no movement points), but the shooting one
can still be very dangerous in its range of 3 squares around.They belong
to noone, and control to each of them is assigned at the beginning of each
turn to the player that has the largest number of creatures on the adjacent
squares.If there are no creatures around some of them, or there exist an equal
number of creatures with different owners (even if they are in the same team),
robot to whom this has happened would remain uncontrolled, and would do nothing
at all during that turn.Number of the artifacts that appear in game is defined
before the game starts.

  Unlike the Chaos I, and Chaos III, Space Chaos is a game that isn't freely
available on the Internet, perhaps because it was really ugly, but most probably
due to a copyright reasons with all those copy protected movie robots (not to
forget the existance of the 'Sir Clive' spell as well).
{pp}
  Whatever the reason, I have played that game for less than a week (3 or 4
days perhaps), and then reverted back to Chaos I, which I still play.Others
have similar opinion, and now we have a 'Classic Chaos' mode in Chaos IV,
but only a few 'artefacts' from Space Chaos.
