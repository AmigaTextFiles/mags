  As a highlight, the CD contains v15.1 of WHDLoad, an installer tool that helps
you to install on a HD many of the (older) games that were designed to be played
from floppies only.If bought separately, the price of the WHDLoad is 20 EUR, but
you can get it for free with this CD (*which only costs 10 EUR*).
{pp}
  The tools section contains AWeb v3.4 web browser, it's last version since it's
status has changed to freeware.There are compiled executables for various 020,
030, 040 and 060 processors.Documentation for it, however, is *not* included
here and you have to download it from the web (http://www.amitrix.com is the
home page of the AWeb browser).The documentation is needed if you wish to use
the software properly, especially it's ARexx port.It also contains a very easy
to read and learn manual of html (v4.0 supported) structured as a table.
{pp}
  Version v3.4 is more of a cosmetic update of previous version (v3.3).It brings
you the 'FONT' tag (finally operational if anyone cares for it), support for
AmiSSL package, some GUI cosmetic enhancements (like optionally displaying a
different pointer when mouse is located over a link) and a few minor bugfixes.
{pp}
  As an user of the AWeb myself, I must recommend that you do *not* use the
included awebgif and awebjfif plugins.Standard datatypes, available on the
Aminet, offer a better choice (both in terms of speed and quality of display
and memory usage (only AWeb uses its plugins, while standard datatypes are used
by everything, since they are a part of the AmigaOS)).
{pp}
  For the gif.datatype I think that v39.18 (shipped with older versions of
AWeb) is the best one available, while for the jpg pics I use akjfif, also
available as freeware in Aminet:util/dtype/ directory.
{pp}
  As for the png pictures, I have done a thorough performance test of all
datatypes that were available on the Aminet about a year ago, and the best one
turned out to be v44.3 png.datatype by Gunther Nikl (congratulations Gunther!).
It managed to handle 24-bit pngs on AWeb's window without a crash and was also
the fastest one on my Amiga (without a graphic card), as reported by a picbench
utility.If it is an issue, it is also small in size (if compared to some others).
{pp}
  The main theme of the CD, however, are games, both newer and older ones.There
are some 50+ different games for the classic Amigas (ECS, AGA), and from the
wide variety of genres, insuring that there is something for everyone.Many games
are playable both on english and german languages, and some of them (like Chaos
for example) have even more translations available (french, italian, hungarian
and polish in a case of the Chaos game).

Rating:
  - Playability : 40%  (indicating the percentage of games that might be
    interesting for average user (lower values are typical for general
    purpose CDs since people usually prefer to play only games of a certain
    genre, and aren't interested for just everything that is available)){p}
  - Lastability : 8 months...3 years (14 months being an estimated average){pp}

  - Overall     : Good value for the price of only 10 EUR. Recommended.
