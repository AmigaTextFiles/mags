{subhead}Lords of Chaos (Chaos III, RPG strategy by Blade){def}{p}
Review by John Smith

{pp}
  For those who don't know, 'RPG' stands for 'Role Playing Game' and is
defined as any game in which you can design your character before the game
starts, and shouldn't be confused with 'FRP', ('Fantasy Role Play'), which
is a game where you control a set of characters (that may be regruited during
the game) who have to work together as a team to accomplish their mission.
Note that the game may be both FRP and RPG simultaneously.
{pp}
  The third part in a series, called 'Lords of Chaos' was the first one that
also appeared as an Amiga game.It introduced independant creatures to the
game, and was quite different from its predecessors.Graphically, it was an
astonishing game, and (surprisingly), there isn't much difference between
the ZX Spectrum and Amiga version, both in playability and appearance.
However, the Amiga port also had the sound in it (quite spooky and well
selected), but no music of any kind.Music,by the way, comes with Chaos IV.
Maximum number of human players is reduced to 4, and there may be only 1
computer player (out of 4 possible places for wizards, 1 may be occupied
by a computer).
{pp}
  Unlike before, screen covers only part of the overall map, and therefore
the exploration concept became part of the game.'Exploration' is also an
entire mode of play in the Chaos IV.
{pp}
  Number of turns is limited, and before the time expires a wizard must
leave the battlefield through the portal, which appears several turns
before the end. Otherwise, he will loose the game.
{pp}
  Concepts of 'mana' and experience points have been introduced into game.
Experience points are used for buying spells and enhancings of your wizard's
personal attributes (mana, attack, defence, stamina, endurance, speed) at the
beginning of game (before the start).Experience points are given at the end of
each battle as a reward for enemies killed (more points for stronger enemies,
double if they are killed by a wizard), and for treasures gather during the game
and carried out through the portal.It is possible to find more treasures than
you can carry with you, and in that case you should know that emeralds are
the cheapest (except for the runestones and a wand, but those items are rare).
Treasures can be found in locked chests (for which you need to find keys) and
are usually guarded by independent creatures and/or locked doors (for which,
again, the keys need to be found).The only weapon that would bring you
experience points if carried through the portal is a magic scimitar
(found inside the dragon's cave), but it is so heavy that it should be
better left behind.
{pp}
  Note that killing of an enemy wizard early in the game would mean that
he will cast less spells, therefore creating less opportunities for you
to kill his creations and gather experience points that way.
{pp}
  Upon the death of an wizard, his creations will contionue to wonder around.
This is unlike the Chaos IV, because there they will fall into a sleep, and
may be killed without any resistance.Killing of such creatures *will*
however, bring you more exeprience points! This is also possible in the
Chaos IV, in which case you are (through the meditation) rewarded with a
new spell.
{pp}
  'Mana', as mentioned earlier is another word for psychic strength.Casting
of every spell will deplete that value, more for stronger spells.It is also
possible to cast several creatures during a single turn.This, as well as
'mana' and experience points features do not exist in the Chaos IV.To increase
your mana quickly, you should find and eat magic mushrooms or magic apples.Both
regular and magic apples can be used for healing in case that you are
wounded (just eat them if you need healing).This brings us to one more new
concept introducedd here (which also exists in the Chaos IV): bleeding.
{pp}
  Creatures can be wounded during the battle, and then they will start
to bleed.Bleeding will slowly decrease their strength, and they might
even die.However, if they die from bleeding and not during the battle,
no experience points will be rewarded to anyone.Be aware of that if
you are playing Lords of Chaos.In Chaos IV this is unimportant.
{pp}
  Some creatures have hands and might use them for gathering things or
(at least) for opening the doors.There are various ingredients lying
around, and also cauldrons.A wizard can use those to create potions to
help him in his task.Potions can be stored in vials and carried around.
Creatures that have hands may also carry those vials arounds and drink
from them to enhance some of their attributes if that is needed.Creatures
that don't have hands may only drink directly from cauldrons.An empty
cauldron may be carried around (although it is quite heavy), but not the
filled one.Interesting thing here to mention is that dragons can only be
successfully cast with the help of the cauldron and a dragon herb.To cast
a dragon spell, a wizard must drop a cauldron and a dragon herb (very rare
thing, hard to find) to the ground, stand upon the pile, and *then* cast a
spell.Though!
{pp}
  The effects of any potion will fade away eventually (faster for stronger
creatures like demons).
{pp}
  Among other creatures, there is an invisible one: pixie.Quite feeble
by the constitution, pixies are very usefull for gathering things from heavily
guarded places.Because of their invisibility, enemies won't know that they are
there, and won't attack them, unless they accidentaly stumble upon them while
moving around.Invisibility concept hasn't survived into Chaos IV.
{pp}
  Bipedal creatures with lighter constitutions may also ride mountable
creatures (centaurs, unicorns, gryphons, elephants) to increase their
movement abilities.This hasn't been the case before, and it hasn't the
case in Chaos IV also.
{pp}
  There were 3 dungeons, each more difficult than previous, that should be
completed in a given order.A wizard may not enter any of the dungeons twice,
and may not enter the second one, until he has done with the first one.
{pp}
  First dungeon is actually a beautifull garden, the computer wizard is
named Torquemada, and upto 4 wizards may participate in the battle.It is
the shortest scenario, and relatively easy.
{pp}
  Second dungeon is a cave divided by a river of molten lava.You can cross
the lava by walking over it, but it will hurt, and may even kill some weaker
creatures (like pixies).Flying is not possible here, except over the central
chasm, where it should be utilised to bypass a very strong defence (2 red
dragons and a Guardian (a monster frog) are guarding a locked room with
three locked chests full of treasures).By flying around you can go around
and enter the  guarded room through the back door (also locked).Guardian,
who is located on the bridge over the chasm, won't follow you, because it
can't fly.You may cast a subversion spell upon him as well, but killing
him (and the dragons) will bring you a lot of experience points (if you
manage to do that).Drinking of various potions here is a quite usefull
thing to do here (especially the invisibility one).
{pp}
  Computer wizard inside the second dungeon is named Elbo Smogg, and the
dungeon may also hold upto 4 wizards in itself.This battle lasts longer
than the previous one, and is more difficult.
{pp}
  Third dungeon is a special one: one human player must confront the last
computer wizard, whose name is Ragaril in a 1 on 1 battle.The battle is
led inside Ragaril's home, which is full of traps.It is quite difficult
and, although this is the longest scenario, the speed is of the essence
here.You must hurry all the time if you wish to reach and kill Ragaril
before the time expires.All the hints that you need to know are written
on the scroll that can be found lying around, but I'll tell you 1 thing:
you'll be needing flood, fire and a speed potion spells, so make sure that
you have them before you enter the dungeon.
{pp}
  ZX Spectrum version of the game can be found at:  {link ftp://ftp.nvg.unit.no/pub/spectrum/snaps/games/}ftp://ftp.nvg.unit.no/pub/spectrum/snaps/games/{end}
{pp}
or at some other ftp site devoted to ZX Spectrum games. You will also need
an emulator to play the game.Some of them can be found there as well.
{pp}
  As for the Amiga version of the game, I have no idea if, or where it
can be found on the internet.It is a single floppy however, and a HD
loader for it can be found on the Aminet.
