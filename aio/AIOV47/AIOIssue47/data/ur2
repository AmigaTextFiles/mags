The purpose of this program is to provide a little easier way to keep track of how and where different files
were placed on your harddisk, for example after an installation. I have often myself been boggled to the point
where I just stop caring to actually clean up, say, in the LIBS: drawer; which is most of the time in utter chaos.

Findchanges works so that each time you scan a partition for files, it gathers information for altered/added files, after
a certain date for instance, which you can later save in a plain textfile anywhere on your disk for safekeeping
or any other means. You can also print the information if you want to play it extra safe.
Then, after you have gathered enough information about your system you compare the most recent with an older saved
list and then the changes will be revealed to you. Simple, smart and useful. There's really not much more to ask for,
Findchanges does what it's supposed to do- and it does it excellent.
