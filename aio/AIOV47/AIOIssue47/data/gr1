If you want to create a successful beatem up then you need, in my
opinion, the speed and playability of IK+ mixed with the graphics of
Capital Punishment. With this in mind I set off on the trail of an
Aminet scrap!
{pp}
I came across Rattlesnake created by Eric Park. "This is going to be
good." I thought. He did create Paws 'n' Claws which I thought was
brilliant.
{pp}
When you open the drawer you can either load the game or read the
instructions...... never mind!
{pp}
Rattlesnake loads with a nice little intro & then you're onto the
title screen where you can start the game, learn the moves or quit.
There is a cheat option but it's not available. Bummer. Lets check
out the moves. OK that's easy enough. Punch, kick, jump kick, floor
kick, back kick and knee. Lets rumble! By the way it is on this
screen where you choose the game speed. F1 normal or F2 fast.
{pp}
You then get to choose your character from either Snake or Cobra
after which you choose the game mode. Arcade; complete all the
levels. Practice; beat up enemies that don't hit you. Time trial;
kill as many as you can in a set time limit.
{pp}
I went straight into the Arcade mode and found myself in a subway
with five blokes who were not there to catch a train. Two of them are
even carrying sticks! I got soundly trounced!
{pp}
Let's have a practice and get the moves sorted. Back into the Arcade
mode and I got battered again. And again. And again. Hold on, there's
a bar on the ground. As soon as I picked up the metal bar the bad
guys got a real slapping, unfortunately if you get hit you drop the
bar.
{pp}
I find the game speed to be slow even on an 060 Miggy and in Arcade
mode I find it very hard to complete the first level. There just
doesn't seem to be enough time. One mistake and you've had it. It
would help if, when you lose a life and the level restarts, your
opponents don't get back all their hit points. As it is it's solid.
{pp}
The graphics, however, are top notch. They put me in mind of that
classic beatem up Double Dragon. The sound is also very good and fits
in well with the game. All in all Rattlesnake is a good game but a
bit difficult.
