I have an A4000 that recently developed an odd problem. There is no video
signal from the built-in port or the Cybervision64 board. I put the CV64
in another computer and it still functions. I switched power supplies with
another computer, but that didn't work. The computer boots, but no video
signal is present. Any thoughts?

Mark,

As the CV64 works in another computer like you mentioned, then it is unlikely
to be gfx card related. Now, a blank screen could be caused by the CV64 scan
doubler module, if you have one. If this malfunctioned or was set incorrectly,
it could be blocking video signals from both the AGA chipset and the video
card. Another possibility is that you've gotten so used to using a VGA monitor
you've forgotten that you need a PAL/NTSC/15khz capable video monitor to work
with AGA, or perhaps your D-sub 23 pin -> high density 25 pin adapter died
somehow.

Either way, here is a few points to consider:
{pp}
1. If your CV64 isn't in the right slot, it may not work correctly. Especially
if the ZIII bus has other cards in it. Make sure it's in the video slot - it
should work in other slots, but conflicts could occur (and anyway, it'll
probably go to ZII mode giving you a slower graphics card).
{pp}
2. Unplug all your ZII/III cards & GFX card. Then plug in a TV or video monitor
straight into the RGB port on the motherboard. Power up the computer holding
down both mouse buttons and see if it gets to the ECS menu. If it does, replace
the cards you had one by one until the system stops working. If it doesn't,
then try something else I'll mention.
{pp}
3. i) Unplug all your ZII/III cards & GFX card. Then, unplug everything else -
RAM, CPU, M/B Power, Floppy etc. Your ROM and socketed buster chips can be a
bit fiddley, so if your not confident, leave them. At least give them a
wriggle. Do this to reseat all the contacts to all the components in the
computer. Perhaps something came loose or dirt has upset something. Also
optional is lifting the M/B completely out of the case and inspecting the
underside/topside closely to see if any screws etc. are shorting anything. When
replacing it, DON'T FORGET THE PIECE OF PLASTIC BEHIND THE ZIII TREE CARD.
Otherwise you'll create nasty shorts all over the place when you go to put the
HDD bracket back in. Chances are this won't fry anything (I've done it
accidently myself) but it can't be good and doesn't get you very far.
{pp}
3. ii) With everything unplugged from the motherboard, restore only the minimum
components that will allow the machine to boot off a floppy. If you have 5 SIMM
sockets, you will need to install the 2MB chip memory SIMM. If you have only 4
sockets, leave them empty. Other things you will need include the CPU,
ROM/buster chips, motherboard power, monitor, mouse, keyboard etc. If the first
test still failes, then wherever possible, use known working parts, for example
from a working A4000. The worst case scenario is that the motherboard is dead.
{pp}
3.iii) Power up the computer with both mouse buttons down. If the ECS menu
appears, then turn off the machine and replace all the parts until it stops
working. Along the way, inspect the card diagnostics section of the ECS menu on
each test to see if the cards are working properly. When your machine stops
working, the last component you installed is causing the problem (or
conflicting with something else).
{pp}
4. Jumper settings on your A4000 mainboard and/or CV64/other ZIII/CPU card.
Seeing as this machine just stopped working without physical intervention, this
is probably unlikely, but worth a check.
{pp}
5. Working CV64 but no AGA - a flakey 2MB Chip mem SIMM could do this, but
perhaps the problem lies on the motherboard itself. Try a known working chip
mem SIMM.
{pp}
6. Working AGA output but no CV64 - As you have verified the CV64 works, then
it could be you have a flakey Buster chip, ZIII riser card, broken tracks on
the M/B, or something else to do with the Zorro bus. The latest Buster revision
is 11 (AFAIK). If the card is listed as working correctly in the ECS menu and
has memory assigned to it (Mine appears to have 256MB of address space assigned
to it!), then you've stumped me. Try a known working Rev 11 buster chip/Riser
card.
{pp}
In conclusion, if your computer sounds like it is booting off the HDD, then
chances are it should be possible to get it working. To have the graphics card
fail to initialise and function properly, AND have the AGA graphics fail at the
same time seems unlikely, unless they both depend on some other subsystem that
could possibly fail but still let the computer boot...

Hope that helps with your problem Mark. Keep us posted! On a side note, if you
have any suggestions for Mark, let us know. If you have ever sent me an email
and I DIDN'T reply (shame on me!), please send it again with your clock set to
the CORRECT time (well, correct day/month/year  would be good enough) to
paul@aioworld.com, as I've had some trouble with a Windows email program and
it's eaten some of my mail which didn't get sorted.
