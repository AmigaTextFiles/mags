Just a few scattered tips this month.  If anyone has any tips they
would like yto submit, or has a specific piece of software or
application thgat they desperately need one on, then by all means
email general@aioworld.com.

Still looking for where you can set the icon and workbench stuff to be
taken out of Chip and put into Fast RAM?  WBC by Deryk B. Robosson,
included on the OS3.9 CD (and possibly on Aminet).

The Serial Prefs included with the OS only allows you to set the baud
rate at up to 31,250 baud, even though the serial port can go faster. 
Use a third-party program to set any higher (or to make use of an I/O
board).  SerPrefs (v42.2) by MSI Software (http://home.sol.nd/~msi)
does the job and supports drivers other then the standard
serial.device as well.

To get MUI applications to load faster, go into the general MUI prefs
and make sure that {bold}all{nobold} o the fields asking for a font
are filled in with some sort of default.  If you rely on MUI to find
one for you when the application loads up then it will take an
unreasonablly long time to load up (or open up each window, for the
case of programs like YAM which have MUI windows).
