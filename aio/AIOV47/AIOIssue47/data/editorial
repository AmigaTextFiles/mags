Well, for us anyway.  In May of 1997 AIO rolled out it's first issue,
making us now 4 years old; an eternity in online-years, yet here we are
still kicking around.  Chris Seward started it and we maintain it.  So
here's three cheers to Chris and all editors past and present.

In other news, Amiga seems to have a realistic timeline in mind and we
should be seeing our first AmigaONE before this summer is out.  It's
been a long wait and we've reason to be impatient, but when the real
savior finally {bold}does{nobold} come along is it not worth the
additional short wait to behold the miracle of a ressurection?  Have
patience for this is either our salvation or our last hurrah.  either
way, tyis is the final turning point.

I do have one request for any programers out there.  If anyone out there
could program a screen blanker module which features an animated
dartboard with Medhi's and Gould's faces at the bull's eye, then that's
a module ever to be in frequent rotation.
