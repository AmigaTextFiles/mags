TS is looking for new Amiga members. A potential member could be a programmer,
graphic artist,  project manager, or web site administrator interested in
helping create free software for the Amiga platform and maintaining the TS web
site. If you think you can help, email {bold}recruit@trogsoft.freeserve.co.uk.{nobold}

Trogladite software has restructured in recent months and our Amiga members are
looking for a project that would be a group effort - if you have a nifty idea
for a useful util/app/port/other coding effort that would benefit the Amiga
community, let us know!
