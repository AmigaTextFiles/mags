As announced last month, our Games Guy Barry is selling his AGA machine and getting a
Voodoo box.  This means, that while he'll continue to guest review
games that run well on that graphics board, we'll still be needing
someone with a regular Amiga (at least until we all have Amiga Ones and
it doesn't matter) to be our regular Games reviewer.

Also, our News Editor seems to have disappeared, so if anyone out
there can handle the collection of news then by all means send in an
email and apply.

The Games Editor is responsible for 3 to 5 games reviews a month and
should be able to stay atop the coming games news.  The News Editor
is responsible for collecting the major aAmiga oriented news items of
that past month.
{pp}
To apply for either position just send an email to:{p}
{bold}general@aioworld.com{nobold} or {bold}mark@aioworld.com{nobold},
with the Subject of "Editor Position", stating of course which one you
want.
