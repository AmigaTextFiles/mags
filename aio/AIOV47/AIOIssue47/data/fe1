Want to see people who {bold}really{nobold} don't have a life? 
Nitpickers Site is where you'll find archives of all manner of
sniggling details of errors found in movies by people who apparently
are very desperate for anything relse to do.  Top of the list?

of it is kinda fun.

the lifestyle of those who watch them.  Essays on the history of the
B-Movie, folklorish characters that appear in them, and even
fraternities and B horror films, you can explore the B-Movie lifestyle
as you browse through wonderfully awful films you never knew excited.

{bold}Ars Technica: The Ars Technopaedia{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://arstechnica.com/paedia/index.html{noitalic}{p}
A site for the techno enthusiast who wants to really poke and prode
into the guts of the latest technology to see what reall goes on
inside.  Between PC, MAC, BEOS, and more, this is pretty much a
platform-independant site; all they care about is the raw technology
itself.
{pp}
The technopaedia is divided into several specific categories to make
it easier on searching for your answers.  CPU and Motherboard
Technology, Mass Storage And Memory technology, Operating System And
Software, Gaming And 3-D Technology, Overclocking And Cooling, and
Sci-tech.  That last takes you beyond the desktop to where computing
is at the absolutely cutting edge.
{pp}
There's also guides to How-To's and tweeks, buyer's guides, product
reviews, and more.  Regular articles finally round things out, from
nanotech and quantum mechanics to BeOS vs QNX.  For good all-around
computing technology info, this is the place to bookmark.
