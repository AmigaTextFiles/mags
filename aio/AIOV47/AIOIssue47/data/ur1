The first impression I got after reading the rather small manual was one
of those "oh no, more lemmings...." errr, I mean "...no MUI-GUI!", however,
that feeling was soon replaced by "hmm, maybe this isn't so bad after all".
With this one you can use all (up to date) existing ID3-tags available,
which is indeed a pretty good thing. Speaking more of the interface, it
has the basic fields of functions which most people should be able to
understand without further explanation, plus there are also a little help
field at the bottom of the window which takes care of most questionmarks.

Installing the program isn't really anything more than just copying the
supplied id3taglibgui.library into LIBS: and then run the program, if you
feel you need to alter anything you can easilly run the preferences program,
or use tooltypes to set the proper values for how you want to alter your
MP3's, how you want the program to run at startup (although the default
settings just great for me, altering the tooltypes is by the way an essential
thing for using this program more "flexibly"). Oh, and also, if you speak
German, Italian, or Magyar, you can also localize the program.
{pp}
Moreover on actually using the program. The main function of the program
seems to be an easy and smart way of keeping track of all your MP3 files,
and it does that well, recursive mass-tagging, nearly endless way of altering
the tags themselves, i.e not being restrained by the often ludicrous number
of genres available on "some" (read: Amplifier) Amiga sound players (the "new"
taggings does of course not actually show up on these, of course; but they
are still there! So now you can finally get a good night's rest instead of
wandering about aimlessly in the woods, tearing off your hair in despair,
tormented by this now dealt-with problem).
{pp}
This program is not bad at all, but however good a program may be, there
are always flaws, and this is no exception, even if these flaws aren't really
the program's/author's fault. The problem lies within all existing MPEG-players
that I know of, which doesn't support the id3taglibgui library. This would
definately be a program always associated with Amiga MPEG software if all- or
at least some would support this 100%.

Maybe in the future... this is a great effort at least.
