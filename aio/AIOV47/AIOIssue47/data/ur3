Viruses can be a pretty nasty thing, if you are unprepared for them. VirusExecutor is a step in the right direction
in trying to get rid of them, both when you have got them- or are afraid of getting them. It's always an issue, not
long ago there were some dubious users spreading a new virus (not really dangerous to the user, but very annoying
for the people at Haage & Partner ;)
Most people should be familiar with the usage of a virus program, and "VE" is really no different from any other,
it's very easy to use and configure, and has a few other pleasant things, such as automatic filechecking on new
downloads, from for example the Aminet. The features are many and usable.
The manual describes these in a very detailed and straightforward matter, so noone should really have any problems
using "VE".

After some thorough testing I reached the conclusion that "VE" (hopefully) works, as I had no viruses, and that is
the way I intend to keep my system.

Updates are frequent and easy to get from both the Aminet and the Virus Help Team, where the most common way of
update is to download a new patch (or "brain") as they become available.
