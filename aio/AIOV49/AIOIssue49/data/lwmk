Hello,
{pp}
I need to repair our gvp-tekmagic accelerator 2060 060 a.s.a.p. I can't 
find anybody that does this type of repair in my area (Cleveland, Ohio).  I
thought it might be the accelerators cpu (xc68060rc50) since it booted
without the board from a floppy-disk, but according to the color 
diagnostics dark gray screen indicates that the cpu is ok. I'm not sure what is the
exact problem, if you can help

The a2000 will boot off a floppy, but not off the060 accelerator!
I suspect the the 68060 cpu on the accelerator since the computer does boot
from it's own 68000. But that's just a guess @ best.

Well, this is a tough one for me. As you can see from the emugaming
page about the Amiga Self Test, it looks as if your Amiga is working
fine. But this doesn't tell us much about the state of the
accelerator. All I can suggest is, if this thing used to work fine,
try removing as much out of your A2000 as possible. This includes
unnecessary ram, HD, stuff plugged into the ports on the back, cards
etc. Also check the jumper settings are similar to the defaults that
I found at the amiga-society website about this CPU card.
{pp}
If you have nothing to lose, write down your current jumper settings
and try the default ones listed (if they are different).
{pp}
Apart from that, there is an unofficial support site for this card,
{link http://www.gregdonner.org/gvp4060/gvp4060.html}http://www.gregdonner.org/gvp4060/gvp4060.html{end}.
It has a manual for the A2060, at {link http://www.gregdonner.org/gvp4060/TekMagic040-060.pdf}http://www.gregdonner.org/gvp4060/TekMagic040-060.pd{end}.
The manual says you could have trouble "if it is not the latest
revision. This could be in effect if your Amiga motherboard revision
is below 4.0, or 6.0 to 6.1".
{pp}
Also, you may have trouble with the 060 libraries. From
gregdonner.org, :
{pp}
{fixed}
"Finally, there are only three 68060.libraries that will allow my system to boot up:

v40.14 of Carsten Schlote's 68060.library (04/28/97), and 68040.library v40.2 (04/14/97)
v2.2 of GVP's 68060.library (07/26/96)
v40.17 of Thomas Richter's 68060.library from his MMULib.lha archive.
...all other libraries leave my system sitting there with a black screen, half-way through the boot process."

There are lots of downloads from {link http://www.gregdonner.org/gvp4060/downloads.html}http://www.gregdonner.org/gvp4060/downloads.html{end} that are GVP A2060/4060 related.
{pp}
I'm sorry I can't recommend an Amiga hardware repair person in your
area. Perhaps one of our readers can help - if so, just drop us an
email!

{center}What your Amiga is telling you{p}
{left}
Ever wondered what your Amiga is doing when all those lights flicker
on and off in a scary fashion. Well they are actually doing an error
check for YOUR benefit. Its just that you don't understand them 'cuz
they're just lights and things. (Sorry it's about 100000000000
degrees here and I can't be bothered to do some kind of proper
introduction, or even be funny).
{pp}
The Amiga may look like its doing nothing when you switch on your
machine then you will probably be right. No, damn. I mean that it's
doing loads of selftest things to see if the system is well. Check
that it isn't running up a temperature IN THIS HEAT. Here is a list
of the checks that a 68000 A500 makes.
{pp}
{fixed}
1) Clears all memory of old data.

2) Disables DMA and interrupts during the selftest.

3) Clears the screen.

4) Checks the processor is working.

5) Changes the screen colour.

6) Do a checksum test in the ROM.

7) Changes the screen colour, again.

8) Begins the system startup.

9) Checks RAM at address $C0000 and moves SYSBASE there.

10) Test all Chip ram.

11) Changes the screen colour, AGAIN.

12) Checks that the software is being executed.

13) Changes the screen colour, for a laugh.

14) Sets the Chip ram to be accessed.

15) Links the libraries.

16) Checks for fast ram.

17) Turns the DMA and interrupts on.

18) Starts a default task.

19) Checks for an accelerator or a maths coprocessor.

20) Checks the processor again to see if there is an error.

21) If an error is found the system is reset.

{bold}SelfTest Output{nobold}{pp}
Whilst the selftest is being carried out information is being
displayed. This is shown through the screen changes that are
mentioned in points 3, 7, 11, and 13. If all of the tests have been
passed, you will see the following colour sequence.
{pp}
Dark Grey: The hardware test has been completed OK, and the registers are readable.{p}
Light Grey: The software side has passed.{p}
White: The initialisation is correct and the system is ready to boot.
{pp}
If there is something wrong with your system you may see the following colours
{pp}
Red: An error was found in the ROM.{p}
Green: An error was found in Chip ram.{p}
Blue: An error was found in the custom chips.{p}
Yellow: The CPU has found an error before the error trapping software (Guru) has been
activated.
{pp}
These problems could be caused by a number of things such as a loose
chip or board. The red screen may be caused by a loose Kickstart chip
that can be fixed by pressing down on the ROM to check it is fitted
correctly. Another cause could be a connection problems between the
chip and socket that can be solved by straightening an bent pins.
Alternatively, the green screen could be caused by a loose memory
board, SIMM, or a loose RAM chip on the memory board. If reattaching
these chips do not solve the problem, try them on another Amiga.
