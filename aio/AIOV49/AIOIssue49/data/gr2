I could review this game in one word.
{pp}
Dynablaster.
{pp}
For those of you who remember that game you will instantly know what
this game is. This type of game has been made on many platforms and
given many different names, from the Amiga to the Gameboy there is
a version of it and now on the Amiga comes a new version. LegoBlast.
{pp}
Now for those of you who know what type of game this is, think the
quality of Dynablaster, the great graphics and great playability and
then remove the little spaceman type players and replace them with
legomen. You now have a full understanding of LegoBlast. You can now
all read another review.

So, if your still here you dont know what the game is about. Let me
explain.
{pp}
You and your friends are put into a little maze type place with walls
which you can blow up with bombs. Inbetween these walls are bricks
that cannot be blown up. As you go around blowing up the walls with
your bombs bonuses appear like greater fire power which means when
your bomb explodes the explosion goes further and is more than likely
to destroy more walls. Other bonuses include more bombs which mean you
can drop more than one bomb at a time. These bonuses are all well and
good but there are also skull and crossbones which will kill you so you
also have to blow these up once they are revealed.
{pp}
The idea of the game is to kill your oponents. Now although it doesnt
sound too exciting, when you have a few friends round this and this
genre of games are one of the most exciting games you will find.
{pp}
There are quite alot of DynaBlaster clones out there but none are as
good as LegoBlast.
{pp}
Overall this is one brilliant game. The game might not be an original
idea but its free, the gameplay is excellent, the graphics are perfect
and it even has a version of the original DynaBlaster music. A great
game to play if you have a few friends. Get It!
