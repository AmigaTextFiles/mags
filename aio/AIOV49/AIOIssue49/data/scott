Hello,
{pp}
    Can you help me ?{p}
    I would like to put ADOS 3.9 on my amiga 1200, but I do not have a cdrom
on my 1200. What is the bast way to put a cdrom on a 1200.{p}
    I have a amiga 2000 and can put a cdrom in it. Can I copy the file over
to my 1200? Also what wood be the best way to move the big files from the
a2000 to my a1200?
{pp}
Kind regards

Hello Scott,
{pp}
I haven't tried to install OS3.9 before, or even OS3.5 without a
CD-ROM! I can suggest you try PARNET off aminet; you have to build a
parallel cable first, but it is the fastest way to transfer large
files instead of flopyy disk between two amigas. You can try copying
the whole CD to your A1200's HDD, then assigning CD0: to that
directory, and hope for the best!
{pp}
Another way is to use a standard serial program that can use an
ordinary PC laplink serial cable that you can buy, if you don't want
to make a special cable. Use a program like TWIN or SERNET (also off
aminet), but it is a lot slower.. you might have to leave it over
night.
{pp}
There is a good FAQ at
{link http://www.faqs.org/faqs/amiga/networking-faq/part1/}http://www.faqs.org/faqs/amiga/networking-faq/part1{end}, which covers
many other ways of networking with Amigas, so I won't go into network
cards at all.
{pp}
For the CD ROM issue. This isn't simple, unless you are going to
tower your A1200. You could buy a 44 pin 2.5" -> 40 pin 3.5" IDE
cable converter. Some A1200 owners do this - they hang this cable out
the side, and have the CD-ROM external. The only other thing I can
suggest is get a scsi module for your accelerator, or a squirrel scsi
card cheap - SCSI cdroms on the A1200 are the best way to go,
otherwise you need to buy sharware ATAPI drivers for IDE CD ROMs.
{pp}
If I was in your situation, I'd investigate whether your accelerator
card supports a SCSI add-on/has SCSI already. It will probably be
hard to find a scsi add-on, and pricey, but it's worth a try.
{pp}
Look out for a cheap squirrel SCSI PCMCIA controller. Apparently
these work great with SCSI CD ROMs.
{pp}
Either of these options will require you to power your CD ROM
externally, you can do this easily with old AT power supplies, or ATX
PSUs which are easy to modify to run without a ATX mainboard present.
{pp}
Personally, when I had a A1200, I used a mini tower case (dirt cheap
- $30 AUD/~$15 USD) and put the CDROM in that, with the SCSI cable
running down to my A1200. I also had the PSU in the tower running my
A1200 - so that wimpy little brick isn't needed any more, and the
on/off switch is easy to find!
{pp}
For IDE, you can't run the cable very long (probably 1 meter at the
most). IDE is a little more involved, because:
{pp}
(1) You need to run a 40 pin IDE cable out the side of your miggy
(not attractive, but not really a problem. You should be able to just
not screw your case up so tight on the left hand side, but your
mileage may vary){p}.
{p}
(2) If you have a 2.5" drive as your main HD
and want to continue using it... you will need some pricey cables
that will probably be worth more than the CD ROM! You need a 44 -> 40
pin IDE converter. This converter has to have:
{p}
a. Ideally it should have two 2.5" plugs, one for your A1200's m/b and one for your HD{p}
b. Ideally again, it should have as long a 3.5" cable as possible{p}
c. Otherwise you will need an extension{p}
d. Failing that, you need some sort of double adapter (do they exist at a reasonable price?) as well as one 44 -> 40 pin adapter{p}
e. Failing that, a 4 way buffered IDE device or similar, that could act as a double adapter AND protect your A1200's unbuffered IDE channel.{p}
{p}
(3) The IDE cable will be short{p}
(4) You need shareware software with nag requesters or you buy it (OR use OS3.9?)
{pp}
If you are convinced SCSI will be more expensive, then I'd recommend
trying to get hold of a IDE buffer (are they only in 4-way versions?)
and a 2.5" -> 3.5" cable adapter. This is because if you fry your IDE
channel, that wouldn't be nice, and the buffer will protect your
A1200 (which wasn't designed for rough abuse, the design presuming a
factory installed HDD and all) from any excess noise or voltage
spikes or whatever, which are risks you take when running IDE cables
out in the open.

The A1200 Hardware Info file on aminet, /hard/misc/A1200Hardware.lha,
has a section about this dillema.

The first thing you need for a CD-Rom drive is some sort of controller. You
should have already decided which type is for you (see "Options", "drive_cd_options"),
so you know exactly what you're letting yourself into.
{pp}
{bold}IDE Drives{nobold}
{pp}
The IDE port on the A1200 is perfectly capable of driving a CD-Rom drive with
the right software. However, Commodore did connect this port directly to the
CPU and a few retailers will have you believe that the world will end if you
don't use a buffer in there somewhere. Well, specifically if you don't use
{italic}their{noitalic} buffer :). Anyway, there is a extremely small risk that
connecting two devices to the IDE port can fry your CPU - I know of a single
case of this happening, in all the time I've been researching this document.
So, a buffer will prevent this from happening, and usually let you control
four devices off one port (2 channels of 2 devices).
{pp}
So you need to add an extra 40-pin port to your existing cable somehow.
Exactly how depends on what HD you have already, if you've got a buffered
interface or not etc, but it's just connected on the same cable as your HD.
Simple. Then use the software described below.
{pp}
{bold}SCSI Drives{nobold}
{pp}
Unless you already have a SCSI controller, you'll need one now. I'm not going
into which one is best, but there are many kinds - PCMCIA, IDE port
translators, accelerator mounted ones...
{pp}
Once you have this, it's a case of getting the cable, setting up the
controller and drive and using the software supplied with the controller to
mount it.
{pp}
{bold}ATAPI Software{nobold}
{pp}
To use an IDE drive you'll need some appropriate software, since support for
them isn't built into OS3.0*. There are some demos of drivers on Aminet - do a
search for "atapi" in disk/cdrom, but the best ones are probably IDEFix97
(disk/misc) which is a kind of patch for the IDE controller, or AtapiPNP which
is purely for CD-Rom drives. Both are demos which will timeout with varying
degrees of nag requestors.
{pp}
* I know Amiga International have been working on ATAPI drivers and have been
released in a beta, and I know OS3.1 has better CD support, but I don't know
whether OS3.1 actually has ATAPI support. Get the software just in case :)
{pp}
{bold}CD-ROM Drive Options Available{nobold}
{pp}
Up until quite recently the only feasible way to add a CD-Rom drive to an
Amiga A1200 was to buy a custom unit, which usually plugged into the PCMCIA port.
These were made by Archos (Zappo in the UK) and consisted of an IDE drive, most
commonly a Mitsumi and an interface. The same principle is applied to the brand
new Amiga Technologies Q-Drive.
{pp}
The times, they are-a-changing however. With the prices of bare SCSI units
dropping weekly, many 1200 owners are turning to them. A SCSI interface is
required, the most popular being the Squirrel which slots into the PCMCIA slot.
Any SCSI adaptor will work however, including the Dataflyer which sits on the IDE
port, and the range available to fit on Expansion boards.
{pp}
They haven't stopped changing yet. Suddenly IDE drives are as cheap as muck -
a double speed drive can now be picked up for the same price as a cable used to
connect it. PC owners are to "thank", since that's where IDE CD-Rom drives are
most commonly found. After getting hold of a special cable, it's s simple job of
plugging the drive in and running a custom driver, a demo of which is available
on Aminet. Cheap and easy, but they can never hope to match the speed of SCSI
devices. As a rule single speed drives reach 150kb/s maximum, double speed drives
300kb/s, quad speeds 600kb/s and so on. However, as with all rules it can be
broken, usually by very early drives which can fail to get anywhere near the
speed and take these figures with the pinch of salt you normally reserve for
transfer rates. Other factors affecting the transfer rates are the size of file
transferred, and the seek speed between parts of the file.

{bold}CD-ROM Drive Information{nobold}
{pp}
CD-Drives are now beginning to take off in a big way. In fact, they are like
Hard Drives were a few years back - viewed as fast, huge amounts of storage
and very useful. But now they are as cheap as old muck, can you afford not to
be without one?
{pp}
Most Amiga mags now have a cover-mount CD of some kind. Couple these monthly
gems with the whole of Aminet, then add the huge collections of software,
pictures, music, samples etc from the likes of Epic, Weird Science et al. Oh,
and there's the CD-only software now, such as PPaint7, Wordworth Office, Big
Red Adventure.... get the piccie?
{pp}
So, how much will it cost? The answer to that is "How much can you afford?"
The options are explained in @{"another secion" link "drive_cd_options"}, but the cheapest option is
probably an IDE drive, a bit of shareware software and a cable. Typically the
drive will be minimum of £30 for a double speed, the cable perhaps £15 - quite
a cheap option! If you're a flash git, how about a fast SCSI drive, maybe a
24x one, slapped onto a accelerator SCSI port - this may set you back around
£300 or more - there's really something for everyone.
{pp}
The drive needs a driver to be readable. For an IDE drive this is probably one
of the shareware atapi devices, from Aminet - there are a few different
versions including the complicated-but-comprehensive IDEFix97. For a SCSI
drive it's usually down to the actual SCSI controller driver, such as
"apolloscsi.device", which can cope with all kinds of drives.
{pp}
If you're getting a IDE drive, it's imperative that it's an ATAPI compliant
drive. A lot are, some don't quite make the grade and some just totally
aren't. It will usually state whether it is - on the manual, the model label
(the bit with all the warnings on) or on the driver disks. A good rule of
thumb is to ask people what they have - typically if one model is, others from
the same manufacturer will be. Good drives to go for are Mitsumi's (4x or
higher), any Sony, Wearnes or Aztech. Another popular drives is the Hitatchi
CDR7730, I had one and a lot of Amiga dealers sell it.

{bold}Frequently Asked Questions - CD-Rom Drives{nobold}
{pp}
Can I use PC IDE CD-Rom drives on my A1200?
{pp}
{fixed}
  Possibly. There are drivers available (such as AtapiPNP and IDEFix97) which
  allow use of a true IDE-ATAPI drive, however you have to make a careful choice
  of drive, it has to be fully ATAPI compliant. Most will say somewhere, a lot
  are (such as Mitsumi, Sony and Wearnes drives), some are nearly (Vertos drives
  - steer clear!) and some are nowhere near.
  You just need the drivers (Aminet disk/cdrom or disk/misc) and a cable - all
  drives will need a 40-pin connection, and you can just get a longer cable from
  your hard drive. This brings in it's own problems such as data transfer
  problems on long cables and buffering worries, but it works.

{pp}
What alternatives are there?
{pp}
{fixed}
  Good old SCSI! Using a Squirrel (Surfing or otherwise), a DataFlyer+ or other
  SCSI controller, any SCSI drive can be connected and will work. For this you
  need a driver such as AmiCDFS (Aminet) and the appropriate cabling/SCSI
  Software/jumper settings/termination.

  Also, there are plenty of ready made drives from retailers, which underneath
  are actually IDE or SCSI, but are just plug-and-play and you don't need to get
  your screwdriver out :)
