Still the middle of Summer here so light browsing only.  For you
people stuck in winter then maybe we've got something here to lighten
the weather.  Either way, have some fun with the ecclectic variety
herein.

{bold}The John Williams Web Pages{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.johnwilliams.org/{noitalic}{p}
Everyone knows who Johm Williams is, but now you can see the complete
list of everything he composed, listings of the tracks, and where to
get it from.  Did you know he wrote some stuff for TV's Wagon Train?

{bold}Danny Elfman's Music For A Darkened People{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://elfman.filmmusic.com/{noitalic}{p}
Another composer site, this one devoted to Danny Elfman, with both
filmography, listings of his works, commentary by the man himself, and
some of his tracks available for downloading, though these last are in
Real Audio format. Worth a check.

{bold}SoundTrackNet: The Art Of Film And Television Music{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.soundtrack.net/{noitalic}{p}
Okay, so we almost have a sort of theme going here, this site is
devoted to the music of television and film.  You'll find track listings and
reviews of the soundtracks for current releases, as well as the
occasional interview with one of the composers. The only downside is
that the site insists on using an excessively small font; so either go
to a higher res screen and larger fonts for this site or break out the
magnifying glass.

{bold}Drive-Ins.com{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.drive-ins.com/{noitalic}{p}
Drive-in theaters are a piece of americana long tossed by the roadside
in this age of indoor stadium seating.  But there are still a few left
and here you will not only find a listing of the ones left, stories
and photos of them, and general opinion and surveys, but also you can
search to see which ones are playing your favorite current films. Hey,
there's a drive-in in South Africa!

{bold}Doctor Who- The Official Site{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/doctorwho/{noitalic}{p}
Nothoing like a good case of time travel to enrich your day.  Doctor
Who's been off the air waves for a wile not but the good doctor is
well know for getting out of any situation and television-oblivion is
no exception. The revival?  On-line of course.
{pp}
First, there's the usual stuff you'd expect from a fan site of this 
sort.  The pictures, the audio clips, the photo-novels of old episodes, 
information and stats on each of the monsters and denizens of the 
Who-universe, episode guides, and pretty much anything a good fan could
ask for.  There's even a virtual Tardis.
{pp}
But more intriging is the {italic}new{noitalic} Who stuff.  Rejected by 
radio stations, an audio drama is down available for streaming off the 
Net.  Death Comnes To Time is a brand-new Who drama, written just for 
this site.  Six streaming five-minute episodes introduce a new plot and
a new bad guy.  If you're lucky enough to have a fast connection then
here at last is some new Who-stuff to satisfy your tastes; if you've got 
something slower, well then you {bold}do{nobold} have the entire
summer.

So, got some extra {italic}time{noitalic} on your hands?
