Most people usually install heap after heap with programs which not uncommonly uses programs/documentations already
supplied with other programs, thus you'll eventually sit there with tons of docs, wasting nothing but space. GHelp
was made to keep a closer look at these sometimes annoying things and to get a better overview of the guides you
have.

This is a really useful little program, it searches through your partitions for guides, docs, readme's, etc.
It also allows you to read and delete the guides, which is usable in case you have several of the same docs, or
newer versions of them. The documentation is small and easy-read, it contains all you need to know to get up and
running with the program.

You configure the program using tooltypes, nothing difficult, just the default path to be searched, and you can
specify the path of "Searchguide", which (I guess, I haven't tried it yet) searches through guides for keywords.

One backdraw of GHelp is the absence of font sensitivity (this will however soon change, according to the
author's statement). Other than that there are only very tiny things that's bad, they're not even worth mentioning,
really.
