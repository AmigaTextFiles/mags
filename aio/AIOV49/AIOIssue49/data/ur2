{subhead}Anno 1.21{def}{p}

Anno is another calendar program, and can be quite usable for us with borderlining alzheimers in terms of memory.
However, as Anno isn't a commodity waiting in the background to actually remind you of when things are to be done,
I found it quite difficult to get some real use of this program, simply because I can never remember to launch
the program.

You install Anno by copying it to whatever place you want to and then create a file called anno.prefs in the Env:/Envarc:
drawer and make a prefs file, the prefsfile will contain all dates that are to be remembered. You can alter the prefsfile
from the program itself and with an ordinary text editor if you would like that better.
For us abnormally lazy people this whole procedure may serve as a deterrent, but if I overcame my fear of actually
doing anything, then most other people should be able to do the same. You can change the dates to be shown in different
combinations, depending on the date they should appear. Additionally you can change the colour to be displayed for
different weeks or days, etc..

I can't really find anything remarkably bad about Anno, other than the lack of font sensitiveness. It simply does what
it's supposed to do.
