USB has been promised on the Amiga with some sort of expansion port and
some software this has been a long time coming but there is some hope
from the Amiga USB Central group with a few samples of some prototype
boards and some early software.
{pp}
So far, a clock port version for the A1200 which connects via the Clock
Port has been completed and working. A Zorro 2 version has been prototyped
and provides one USB port so far.

As far as software is concerned, there are two versions. One by Thomas
Graff Thoger, the status of this unknown and also by vmc Harald Frank
which has some basic functions working so far.
