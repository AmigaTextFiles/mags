News: 25-June-2001: DCE licenses Voodoo 3 Warp 3D drivers for its G-REX
line of PCI products.
{pp}
Hyperion Entertainment is pleased to announce that it has entered into a
license agreement with DCE, producers of the G-REX line of PCI hardware
for the Amiga.
{pp}
Under the agreement Hyperion will support DCE's G-REX 1200 and G-REX 4000
products with fully featured Warp 3D Voodoo 3 drivers for both 68K and
PPC.

"We're very pleased that DCE has decided to respond to demand by its
customers for Warp3D drivers for Voodoo 3 ", says Ben Hermans, managing
partner of Hyperion Entertainment . " Amiga users currently have quite a
number of PCI solutions to chose from and the manufacturers offering the
widest range of drivers for their PCI solutions will clearly have a
competitive advantage. From the large number of e-mails we have received,
we can only conclude that the availability of 3D drivers is a key
consideration for users when they make their decision to purchase a
specific PCI solution. To avoid disappointment, we once again urge users
interested in 3D graphics to investigate the availability of Warp3D
drivers before purchasing a specific PCI solution. "
