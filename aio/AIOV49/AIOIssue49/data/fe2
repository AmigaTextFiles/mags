Hi,{p}
Just to let you guys know that I have started a mailing list that I hope will
bring the community closer together. It is called Amiga-Newsfeed. The idea
behind Amiga-Newsfeed is to enable people who don't have that much time
online in the evenings, to have the latest news from the Amiga community.
I came up with the idea that if all usergroup mailing lists were a member of
a larger one, then people like Amiga could reach everyone to pass on
executive updates and the like. This is an idea that Fleecy and a few others
toyed with during the Gateway era, so when I approached them with the idea,
they were happy to assist. At the moment, I am looking for representatives
of Amiga usergroups around the country to join the list, so that they can
then bounce the messages on to their mailing list. I am also looking for
Amiga-based companies to approach me to advertise on the list, I know that
some people on the list do not read AmigActive regularly, and therefore do
not see the adverts. It is also an ideal place to advertise group meetings
and shows that a usergroup is holding, to help increase turnout.
