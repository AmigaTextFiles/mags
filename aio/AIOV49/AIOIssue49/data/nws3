---------------
{pp}
Storm C 4 has been chosen over other Development systems such as SAS C and
VBCC for its excellent C++ support which is incomplete or incompatible in
other development packages.
{pp}
Storm C 4 has a source level debugger, fastg PPC compilation, efficient I/O
linker library, 68K/PPC profiler, graphical IDE (not avail. on SAS C), compile
over a network, object file compatibility, mixed binaries, shared PPC libraries
and support from Haage & Partner.

SAS C is no longer been in development for a number of years and difficult to
get hold of, VBCC is good but has no C++, source level debugger or commercial
support.
