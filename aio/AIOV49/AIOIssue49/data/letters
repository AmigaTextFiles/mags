Hello,
{pp}
I read with interest Rick Deckard last issue and agree with
a few points made. I ask myself, are we living in the clouds
about a new Amiga taking off and being the number 1 computer.
{pp}
Im sure we are infact, but its always good to dream. The computer
market has changed completely since the Amiga was the computer
of choice. Seriously think about the Amiga days, the computer,
its hardware and OS came all bundled by Commodore. When you take
a glance at the PC market, the OS is by Microsoft, the processors
are by numerous companies and there is no one company which you
buy a packaged PC from, there are many different companies who
put together these computers.
{pp}
This is a complete change from the Amiga day.
{pp}
Although this is true and some of the comments made by Mr. Deckard
are true this current Amiga following is all about the dream, all
about keeping the Amiga and its community alive. If you use your
Amiga for one task and dont take an interest in the cause then this
is ofcourse fine but if you read an amiga magazine like AIO and get
involved in the Amiga world then please do not make comments such
as the ones you made Mr. Deckard.
{pp}
It leaves the question if these kinds of people really have any
reason for using an Amiga. I for the future cannot see myself
using many other computers as my main computer but the Amiga. In
10 or 20 years if a new Amiga did not take off then i am more than
likely to not be using my current Amiga. For now it does the job
I want and so I support the cause and am involved in the Amiga
world.
{pp}
If you are basically going to slag off the work of people involved
in this cause then please do not be part of the community we hold
very dearly to our hearts.
{pp}
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion I grant that but if you
are part of this user base and dont even have any hope or want
to air views which cause positive action then please keep them
to yourselfs, switch off your Amiga and place it in the bin.
{pp}
Those of us left will be quite happy to talk about the computer
we enjoy to use, enjoy being the survivors and having a unique
computer, a talking point and something we have in common with
lots of us users around the world. Enjoy telling people that
our Amigas are on the internet, have harddrives, are not full
with bloatware type products.
{pp}
For alot of people the Amiga is not just a computer to use to
carry out our daily tasks. Many of the users have an Amiga and
a PC, the PC obviously to do the tasks the Amiga sadly cannot
do. This is fact, no one is trying to hide from the situation
or say that the Amiga is faster or more powerful, but the
fact that so many people use the Amiga as a tool to relax, to
research, to further and to be involved with a personal community
and not one of the faceless masses of the PC world is the key
to our user base and one which I and many other users are proud
to be a part of.
