Hey, we have a new News Editor at last.  Peter Hutchison has joined our team
and looks to have some god stuff before him.  So welcome him aboard by
sending him in your Amiga-related news items.

On our other front, Barry puts in a game review whenever he can, but he 
agrees that we really need a new Games Editor.  So, if you play computer
games on your Ami why not review them?  Come join our team and support
your Community.

Well, the countdown is continuing.  Amiga Ones are do out and the
tension is building.  I for one can hardly wait to get the first new
Amiga product in years and show those PCers what a
{italic}real{noitalic} OS can do with modern hardware.  Winbloat?  Don't
make me laugh. MacOS the most advanced OS in the world?  Move over.

The King is returning and he's taking no prisoners.
