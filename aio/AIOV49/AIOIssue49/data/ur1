Amiga mouses can sometime be quite hard to obtain these days, and not only that, they are usually a little more
expensive to buy. That's basically why Mroocheck exists; it allows a standard PC mouse to connected (via a hardware
interface) to the Amiga mouseport. Mroocheck is very simple to install, and I at least had no problems at all to
get the whole thing rolling after installing the software and the mouse and configuring.
Mouses with wheels are also supported (through a program called FreeWheel), however I have never found that thing
to be very useful, but I'm sure alot of other people would like to have it. The configuration is done by launching
two additional programs, called MroocheckCal and MroocheckTest, the first is for calibrating the mouse to suit your
needs, and the other is to actually test the mouse after calibrating.

There are a few bad things worth mentioning, but it's however not really Mroocheck's fault. Standard PC mouses are
getting harder and harder to come by as well, because of the increasing number of USB, etc., mouses that are getting
more and more popular.

But on the other hand, it's far from impossible to get a standard PC mouse, and most importantly, most major mouse brands
works with Mroocheck, and it works good. There's a complete list of working mice at the Mroocheck webpage
