{subhead}The Deathbird{def}{p}
Review by Chris Seward

The Deathbird is a platform game based around a short story by the
same name (accourding to the author of the game). There is quite
a bit of storyline in the guide to the game which sets the scene
but it isnt really all that interesting and who reads the documents
before playing the actual game?
{pp}
The game has an intro which you can choose to show although it
basically tells the same story and if you arent interested in the
first place you are unlikely to be hooked by the end of the intro
either.
{pp}
The game looks quite good from the start because there are some
digitised pictures but the game does not really live up to the
title screens once you play it.
{pp}
The game is created with BackBone which is some kind of games creator
made in Amos if I remember correctly. This has allowed the author to
create a platform game and although I quite like platform games as I
havent played one for quite a while there doesnt seem to be much you
can actually do in this one.

I got quite bored after only a few levels, the backdrop was the same
through them all, the main guy you control ran like he was desperate
to goto the toilet and the objects you have to jump are pretty easy
and when you do goto jump over the balls of fire the whole game gets
slightly slower even on an 030/a1200.
{pp}
Overall its a pretty simple platform game and given its due its only
a demo which Im sure can be improved upon. Little things like animating
the main graphic to make him run smootly would no doubt improve the
game no end. If you havent played a platform for a while then give this
one a bash but in the end it is more likely to appeal to people who
have read the book and enjoyed it.
