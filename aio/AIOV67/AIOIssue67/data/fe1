Hyperion has finally published the feature list for the nearly-there
OS4, and a rather extensive list it is.  Rather then put into this
article (it being rather long), there is an HTML version of it attached in
"AIOIssue67/FeatureList/features.html".  Jusst fire up your browser or
HTML reader and do what I did- spend the next 20 minutes reading,
salivating, and cheering.
