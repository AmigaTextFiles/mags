The Management of Crossbee S.A. of Paris, France has joined Genesi to
assist in the organization of the Company. "Integrating
Thendic-France, bplan GmbH, and all of our sales efforts and
strategic initiatives required us to find and recruit a proven and
talent international management team. Stéphane Donders and the
Crossbee team are the right people to bring Genesi to the next
level." The Crossbee team began working with Genesi 7 January.
