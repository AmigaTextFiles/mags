I've been doing a fair amoutn of scanning lately, so gues what this 
month's columnis about :)

Now, the program I use is canTek butthe following may very well apply
to other scanner programs.  When an image is scanned it's saved out as
an IFF file, ut one that appears to have a mall crock in it (in that
pain and image processing programs cough a lot trying to load it).
imple solution, jut feed it to Multiview then save it out; you now
have a proper IFF file that you can then proces into a jpeg or whatever
you need.

Another scanner tip, if scanning from a newspaper or magazine a lot of
them have their print at 75 dots per inch, so scanning at double that
should be sufficient, though you may want to play around with the
exact setting as you're bound to get some interence patterns.  
Pictures from, for example, a baseball card, collector card,
or calendar, mighthave higher densities so you might want to go 300
dpi for those.  When to use 600 or more?  Considering the increase of
file size, save higher reolutions for smaller areas of detail and not
full page scans... unless you (and your image procesing tools) aren't
afraid of 100MB files.
