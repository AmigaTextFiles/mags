Well, it's time to send out the call again.  Our game Editor Vincenzo,
has been with us for 15 issues (has it really been THAT long?!), but
now the demands of a job and what-not (in short, one of us has a real
life, can you guess who?) pull upon him too much so once again it is
time to ask who out there can be an editor? Can you review games on a
monthly basis? If so, then just email us.

In the meantime, read Vincenzo's very last review as our games
Editor.
