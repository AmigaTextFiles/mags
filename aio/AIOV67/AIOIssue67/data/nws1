Because most of the users have a direct access to the Internet an
AminetCD which is published each second month makes no sense. The
users can get the software in a much faster way from the Aminet.
{pp}
Because of that the team of the Aminet has decided to stop making the
CDs. This has not an influence on the Aminet itself which will be
kept leading in the same way.
{pp}
The newest and last Aminet-CD number 52 (December 2002) offers
Superview Productivity Suite II written by Andreas Kleinert as the
highlight. The CD is already provided. SuperView IV (SViewIV) reads,
writes and/or converts more than 50 graphic formats and also
integrates external programs like Xpk, Ghostscipt or MetaView.
Additional to the display of graphics on over 20 supported graphic
cards (via CyberGraphX, Picasso96 or special driver systems) the
program can also edit the different graphic formats.
