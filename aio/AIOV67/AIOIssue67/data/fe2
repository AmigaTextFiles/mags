Seems as my last month's Web Wanderer article had the wrong thing
clipped out to the write-up of one of the sites and I didn't noticed
until long after the issue was out.{p}
The Movie Pit gave as the URL some mysterious line that I do not know
from whence it came.  The correct URL for The Movie Pit is:{p}
{Italic}http://www.geocities.com/Athens/9200/index.htm{noitalic}{pp}
Sorry for the error.
