Welcome to the letters page. This is the section where you can
air your views to the Amiga public. No matter what you want to say,
write in and we'll most likely publish it.

I have been looking for the game T F X flight simulator and have come up
totally empty.Finally I came across aioworld and i'm hoping you may know
something about the game's developer (ocean) or their e-mail address.The game
happens to be the best by far flight sim game ever developed and mine
broke.If you can help me it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you

However, they will not support Amiga software and they never actually
published TFX - its only release was on the cover CD of CU Amiga (which hasn't
been around for some time now).
{pp}
They only real way to get a replacement is to find it available for download
somewhere or ask in somewhere like comp.sys.amiga.marketplace (or AIO :) if
someone will sell/copy their CU cover CD.
