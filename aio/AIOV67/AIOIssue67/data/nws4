For the first time Creative Development shows a few simple snapshots
of the first prototype of its USB-card which many people have already
seen at ARC 2002.

You can have a look at the card here. At the second pictures you can
have a more detailed look at the card - you can also recognize the
FlashROM as well as both extension ports.

The final layout will be clearer and possibly more compact but
already right now the card makes a good impression. Creative
Development is very buzy while finishing the development of the card
and hopes to report further news soon.
