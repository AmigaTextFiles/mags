Back?  Hey, doesn't that just catch you someplace between "It's about
time" and "this thing's gonna rock"?   When this stuff finally comes

Looking over the feature set it looks like they've been listening to
us, now if they'll just listen about keeping to some deadlines.  They
mised sSummer and Christmas, let's not push this off any farther if we
can help it.  It's already made it to a top 10 vapor products of 2002,
let's not be the wrong end of any more jokes.
