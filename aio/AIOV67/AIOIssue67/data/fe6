OS4 is coming and with it the A1, delayed though it has been.  Still
perhap another month but there are some thing that you can start doing
now to be ready for when the time comes

backup.  Everyone that's downloaded a file has a backup copy somewhere
on an old floppy. Well with the ability to ue a CD like a floppy
there' no telling how much longer floppies will be around, not to
mention support for old double-density diks. Solution is to get a Zip
drive and start copying everything over to a zip-disk.  For Zip100s
there are pretty standard mountfiles available but none that I've seen
for 250 other then one I had to hack together myself- and there's no
guarranteeing that that will be the standard mountfile used.  So to
make sure, just format your Zip like it's a hard drive partition
(using fastfile, naturally) and you are sure to have something that
the new OS will read.

While you're at it, keep your Hard Drive backed upon Zips as well
unless you plan on ripping out the old hard drive to installit as a
second one in the new A1.  When yoiur new ystem comes in, you'll be
ready to shove everything from the old computer in.

When you copy allthe stuff from your old hard drive over to the new
ystem, keep the copt of your old boot partition in some harmless
parition by itself.  As you start to use the new OS you'll begin to
have an idea which old rpgrams and files you'll still need to copy
over to the new boot partition and which get relegated to the rashcan
and old backup disks.  After seeing the feature set I know that I for
one will be eliminating most of my usual standard utilities.  Even for
fonts you'll want to see what the new system is and what fonts come in
the distribution and how you'll have to install them.  The settling
in period could be a week or two after you've got things running.

After having a look at the offerings for the hardware, you're going to
want to start thinking about just what you want.  With just the
motherboard as the only cutom part, the rest will be pretty much up to
what you want... just like the way everyone else in the real world
gets their systems.  Maybe an old floppy, a Mount Rainier compatible
CD/RW and probably DVD...  Ethernet is really only required if you
have a home network or something like cable modem or DSL.  Basically
just think through what you need now and will probably need over the
next few years.
