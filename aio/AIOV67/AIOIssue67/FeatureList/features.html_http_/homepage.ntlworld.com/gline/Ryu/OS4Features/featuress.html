<a name=2></a><a name=3></a><i><b>Introduction</b></i><br>
The following pages provide a more detailed description of the "new" functionality introduced by<br>
Amiga OS 4.0.<br>Functionality is considered "new" when it was not present in Amiga OS 3.9 (Boing Bag 2).<br>OS modules which are simply recompiled for PPC (such as Workbench for instance) are not<br>
mentioned here.<br>
<b>Note that this document should be considered preliminary and the information it contains is</b><br>
<b>still subject to change and refinement.<br>Nothing in this document shall be construed as limiting Hyperion's right to modify the</b><br>
<b>functionality of AmigaOS 4.0 without prior notice.<br>Further revisions of this document will be made available.<br>This document is © (2003) Hyperion Entertainment.<br>Permission is hereby granted to reproduce the content of this document in whole or in part</b><br>
<b>solely in unmodified form.</b><br>

<a name=4></a><i><b>Exec SG (second generation)</b></i><br>
Exec SG is the OS 4.x kernel and as such the heart of the system.<br>
<i><b>Inherited functionality from older Exec versions:<br></b></i>ExecSG is fully backward compatible to older Exec versions and preserves all of its features<br>
including, but not limited to:<br>
·<br>
Fully pre-emptive multitasking (round-robin)<br>
·<br>
Support for shared libraries<br>
·<br>
Very fast inter-process communication (IPC - message passing by reference)<br>
·<br>
Fast interrupt handling (low latency)<br>
·<br>
Low-overhead task switching<br>
<i><b>New functionality introduced by ExecSG: </b></i><br>
·<br>
Fully PPC native: not a single 68k instruction left in ExecSG. <br>
·<br>
68k emulation: both interpreting and JIT emulation available (see below), JIT for speed,<br>
interpreting for compatibility.<br>
·<br>
Extremely fast context switching times: 1 microsecond on a 600 MHz G3.<br>
·<br>
Extremely low latency for IPC: Signal &quot;roundtrip&quot; times below 4 microseconds.<br>
<i><b>Clarification: Roundtrip time means the time required for task A to send a signal to</b></i><br>
<i><b>task B and task B to send a signal back to task A. Roundtrip time is the time needed for</b></i><br>
<i><b>task A to send the signal and receive the answering signal.</b></i><br>
·<br>
Interrupt handler can be in PPC code but can also be emulated, which is useful for old hardware<br>
drivers.<br>
·<br>
New API for DMA drivers: DMA capable drivers can now query the &quot;scattering&quot; of memory<br>
with just one call instead of repeated CachePreDMA/CachePostDMA calls. This makes DMA<br>
transfers much more efficient for controllers that support &quot;scatter/gather&quot; interfaces like most<br>
busmastering IDE controllers. The new API is also much easier to use.<br>
·<br>
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL): ExecSG itself is machine independent, it sits on an abstract<br>
&quot;hardware&quot;. Only the abstraction layer itself has to be ported to a new platform thus making the<br>
transition to other hardware relatively easy. The abstraction layer itself is also divided up into<br>
different parts: CPU, machine and common. For a transition to another machine with an already<br>
supported CPU, only the &quot;machine&quot; part has to be ported.<br>
·<br>
Resource tracking: Applications can create &quot;trackable&quot; resources, for example memory, message<br>
ports, messages, semaphores, and have them tracked by ExecSG. When the program exits (either<br>
normally or abnormally due to a crash) the resources are freed automatically.<br>
·<br>
Improved trap handling: Previous incarnations of Exec only allowed one trap handler per task.<br>
ExecSG allows trap handlers to be installed for different &quot;events&quot;, like illegal instructions,<br>
address errors, privilege violations, etc.. <br>
4<br>
<a name=5></a>·<br>
Unified MMU interface: ExecSG now offers a special API to access the Memory management<br>
unit. No custom solutions needed anymore.<br>
·<br>
Integration of utility.library: ExecSG integrates the functionality of utility.library to present the<br>
application programmer with a unified interface throughout the system. This allows Exec<br>
functions to use hooks and tag lists instead of simple callbacks or variable argument lists. This<br>
functionality is included in its own interface (see below, &quot;new library model&quot;, for a discussion<br>
about interfaces). All of these functions can of course still be accessed through utility.library.<br>
·<br>
Integration of amiga.lib: ExecSG integrates the &quot;Exec support functions&quot; of amiga.lib. This also<br>
includes CreateTask, which now has an additional parameter that can take up a taglist, which in<br>
turn can be used to pass parameters to a task (these parameters are passed like function<br>
parameters).<br>
·<br>
Limited memory protection: Critical memory areas can be protected: Kernel memory areas, all<br>
code areas, unused memory (also unused free memory). Applications can use the MMU interface<br>
to protect their memory from others.<br>
·<br>
AltiVec.resource: Used to arbitrate access to AltiVec streams.<br>
·<br>
WarpUp emulation.<br>
<b>Planned and already partially implemented functionality:</b><br>
·<br>
Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP): support for multiple CPU's.<br>
·<br>
Multithreading: Tasks can consist of multiple threads of execution which are scheduled<br>
individually on a higher frequency.<br>
·<br>
Isolated address spaces: This feature will give each task its own address space so that it appears<br>
to be the only running task. Communication will still work without copy through shared memory<br>
areas. This feature is already available in the current ExecSG but not enabled yet due to<br>
incompatibilities with OS3.x.  It is also only really useful with multithreading.<br>
·<br>
Pluggable schedulers<br>
<b>An in-depth look at some of the more advanced ExecSG features:</b><br>
<b>New library model<br></b>ExecSG sports a new model for shared libraries. The old model will remain to support 68k libraries.<br>PPC native libraries will be organized slightly different: The library base is still there (and looking<br>
the same as before) but the jump table only contains 68k functionality (for compatibility). <br>
PPC native functionality is provided by <br>
<b>Interfaces</b>:<br>
·<br>
An Interface can be thought of as a separate jumptable, containing pointers to the actual library<br>
functions.<br>
·<br>
An Interface can have its own data area in addition to that of the library base.<br>
·<br>
An Interface can be shared among tasks (like a library) but may also be created as a private<br>
instance, allowing instance data to be stored in it (similar to the old SAS/C method of duplicating<br>
5<br>
<a name=6></a>the library base). A task can also create multiple instances of the same interface with each<br>
interface having its own data (essentially like real objects).<br>
·<br>
Reference counting is used to work around stale pointer problems.<br>
·<br>
A library can export any number of interfaces. For example, ExecSG exports the interfaces<br>
&quot;main&quot;, &quot;utility&quot; and &quot;mmu&quot;, which represent the main API, the integrated utility.library and the<br>
special MMU interface.<br>
·<br>
A library can export the same interface in multiple versions thus allowing for full backward<br>
compatibility.<br>
·<br>
Interfaces can be modified with SetMethod (like SetFunction), allowing &quot;morphing&quot; interfaces<br>
that can efficiently adapt to internal state changes. For example, expansion.library uses this in its<br>
PCI interface to adapt a PCI interface to the actual hardware.<br>
·<br>
Interfaces can also be created in such a way that they are protected against patching. This is<br>
essential for services like SSL (or any security-sensitive service).<br>
·<br>
Interfaces can be used to write Object-oriented libraries.<br>
·<br>
Interfaces are conceptually similar to component programming models.<br>
<i><b>New memory system:</b></i><br>
·<br>
ExecSG uses a fully virtualised address space. As a result addressable memory can be larger than<br>
the available physical memory.<br>
·<br>
Memory allocation can specifically request physically mapped memory or virtualised memory.<br>
<i><b>Clarification: virtualised memory is NOT virtual memory in the sense of disk-based</b></i><br>
<i><b>memory.</b></i><br>
·<br>
Memory allocation can be deferred, i.e. virtual addresses are allocated but no physical memory is<br>
assigned until it is needed (which is then handled automatically and fully transparently to the<br>
application). If an address range is not referenced, it will never be backed up with physical<br>
memory so no memory is wasted.<br>
·<br>
Memory can be paged-out to disk (virtual memory). This feature can be disabled if required<br>
(under certain circumstances, this can be switched on or off on-the-fly, no reboot required).<br>
·<br>
Memory can be reallocated: This essentially resizes a block of memory without moving it.<br>
·<br>
Memory reallocation in conjunction with deferred mapping can be used to load disk-based data<br>
structures in an extremely memory-efficient manner: Allocate a large block of memory deferred,<br>
fill it up with data, and reallocate it to the appropriate size. This method will never use more than<br>
the memory that is actually being accessed and can be used to load e.g. compressed data when<br>
the uncompressed size is not  known but a rough estimate is nonetheless possible.<br>
·<br>
The memory system is now &quot;object-oriented&quot;: The virtual address space is divided into areas<br>
(similar to the old MemHeader system) but each memory area can be attached to an allocator and<br>
a fault handler.<br>
·<br>
An <br>
<b>allocator</b> organizes the address space it has been assigned to; <br>
·<br>
it handles allocation/deallocation, DMA preparation etc.<br>
6<br>
<a name=7></a>·<br>
it handles allocation of physical memory and binding physical memory<br>
to virtual addresses<br>
·<br>
<b>A fault handler</b> is responsible for handling memory faults in its assigned area:<br>
·<br>
it handles deferred memory requests by providing physical memory as<br>
soon as virtual areas are accessed.<br>
·<br>
it handles interaction with the pager to swap memory out to/in from<br>
disk.<br>
·<br>
it handles illegal access (privilege violation, illegal addresses etc).<br>
·<br>
Possibilities for allocator/fault handlers:<br>
·<br>
&quot;Normal&quot; virtual addressed memory: The default case.<br>
·<br>
Stack areas: A stack might underflow (out of stack space), in which case the fault<br>
handler can use the allocator to provide a new chunk of physical memory, thus<br>
automatically enlarging the stack. Stack underflows are one of the major problems<br>
on the Amiga today and account for a significant percentage of crashes.<br>
·<br>
Memory mapped files: The fault handler swaps in portions of a file when they are<br>
accessed in virtual address space. This works exactly like virtual memory but allows<br>
for normal disk-based files to be accessed as if they were in memory.<br>
·<br>
Address space emulation: The system can emulate alien address spaces, for example<br>
emulate an AGA chipset on a machine that doesn`t have AGA.<br>
<i><b>Just in Time (JIT) 68K emulation<br></b></i>Dynamic recompilation or JIT compilation is a technique whereby (in this case) 68K machine code<br>
is translated on the fly to PPC machine code which is stored in a temporary buffer to avoid<br>
recompilation each time the recompiled code is executed.<br>All 68040 instructions including FPU instructions are fully emulated.<br>Even on a lowly 603e@160 Mhz the recompiled code reaches and in some cases surpasses the<br>
speed of a 68060@50 Mhz.<br>
·<br>
Directly integrated with ExecSG. No "boxed" emulation approach.<br>
·<br>
JIT can be switched on/off on a per-task basis<br>
·<br>
Different JIT and/or interpreter can be used on a per-task basis ("pluggable" emulation).<br>
AmigaOS 4 uses a task-based emulation which is directly integrated into ExecSG to emulate legacy<br>
68k code. Each emulated task is scheduled independently and has its own emulation process and<br>
interpretation/translation stage independently from other emulated tasks. Hence there is no need for<br>
virtualization of resources, no delay to build a sandbox mechanism.<br>While this is in theory less compatible than a sandbox or "virtual machine" type approach, it offers<br>
a few key advantages:<br>
·<br>
More responsive; such an approach does not break time-critical/real-time behavior.<br>
<i><b>Clarification: With a sandbox approach, a separate scheduler runs inside the sandbox</b></i><br>
<i><b>to schedule 68k tasks, which increases delay times substantially. A task-based scheme</b></i><br>
<i><b>does not separate 68k and PPC tasks. They are treated equally.</b></i><br>
7<br>
<a name=8></a>·<br>
External interrupts (generated by the hardware or the kernel) as well as some exceptions do not<br>
have to be emulated, which improves emulation speed.<br>
·<br>
Legacy applications may benefit (to some extent) from additional functionality introduced by<br>
ExecSG (resource tracking and memory protection, for instance), albeit in a limited way.<br>
<i><b>Generic PCI support available through expansion.library</b></i><br>
Currently supports Prometheus and Mediator PCI busboards as well as the Articia S on the<br>
AmigaOne hardware. <br>
<i><b>Completely re-implemented DOS</b></i><br>
·<br>
There are no longer any limits to DOS path length strings for the following functions: Open(),<br>
Lock(), SetProtection(), SetOwner(), SetFileDate(), DeleteFile(), CreateDir(), SetComment().<br>
·<br>
Completely new implementation of all the pattern matching functions, providing far better<br>
pattern support than the old routines.  <br>
·<br>
Includes a suite of Address Tracking Functions to complement DOS to provide a consistent<br>
interface for various development tools.<br>
·<br>
All of active (TripOS) BCPL DOS components from V40, are now defunct resulting in a more<br>
stable and consistent C-based DOS library.<br>
·<br>
Many bugs fixed including memory leaks and &quot;NIL:&quot; filehandle issues as well as a more robust<br>
RunCommand() function.<br>
<i><b>New Shell and C: commands</b></i><br>
·<br>
Improved shell with pipes, history, output recording, command line editing, file name completion<br>
and new built-in commands. Detects software implementation problems such as unreleased<br>
signal bits to help developers to clean up their code.<br>
·<br>
New Queue-Handler, implementing the PIPE: device; faster, more memory efficient. No longer<br>
suffers from the implementation problems of the original Queue-Handler.<br>
·<br>
New and improved Aux-Handler, allowing you to run a command line shell on the serial terminal<br>
instead of a console window.<br>
·<br>
New MD5Sum command for calculating and verifying checksums of files; compatible with the<br>
Unix command of the same name.<br>
·<br>
All shell commands now transparently support soft links.<br>
<i><b>OS 4.x native SCSI drivers for the Symbios SCRIPTS family of SCSI</b></i><br>
<i><b>controllers</b></i><br>
Support for the onboard SCSI controllers of the Cyberstorm PPC and BlizzardPPC.<br>
<i><b>Highly optimised layers.library</b></i><br>
·<br>
Many source code improvements and bugfixes leading to a cleaner implementation.<br>
·<br>
Improved memory management (less fragmentation and better low-memory handling).<br>
·<br>
Ability to hide layers (ie. make them invisible).<br>
8<br>
<a name=9></a>·<br>
Introduction of several speed-ups when moving and resizing of layers.<br>
·<br>
Offscreen-layers, allows Intuition windows to be dragged off screen.<br>
<i><b>Picasso 96 V3 RTG system</b></i><br>
P96 is a Retargetable Graphics system which redirects graphic output to the monitor and bypasses<br>
the Amiga`s built in graphics modes (OCS/ECS/AGA).<br>More details (especially on the supported graphics cards) to follow soon.<br>
<i><b>New Intuition and Reaction</b></i><br>
·<br>
The Intuition API has been noticeably extended with 50+ new functions, several new properties<br>
for screens, windows, gadgets and images and the integration of features previously only<br>
available through third-party extensions or patches.<br>
·<br>
Possibility to drag windows outside of their screen`s boundaries. This feature is optional and can<br>
also be disabled on-the-fly by way of a qualifier key.<br>
·<br>
Intuition offers functions to hide/show windows, useful for instance to easily implement<br>
iconification in any program.<br>
·<br>
Some amiga.lib BOOPSI support functions have been integrated into intuition.library for greater<br>
efficiency.<br>
·<br>
Intuition offers a screen notification system, allowing client applications to be informed in real<br>
time whenever a specific public screen is opened, closed, depth-arranged, locked or unlocked. It<br>
is also possible to receive a notification for any window that is opened or closed on that screen.<br>
·<br>
Screens can be locked in an Intuition-friendly way, whenever it is needed to directly access their<br>
bitmap, without having to go through the locking functions of layers.library. This can be done<br>
both by applications and by  BOOPSI classes.<br>
·<br>
The updated API offers functions to set and get attributes of already open screens and windows,<br>
where applicable.<br>
·<br>
A new type of window is available, &quot;toolbox window&quot;, which cannot be activated and is<br>
therefore very useful to implement floating toolboxes (as commonly used in e.g. drawing<br>
programs) which don`t take away the focus from the project window when the user clicks on<br>
their buttons.<br>
·<br>
Intuition can optionally remember the last active window and gadget on every screen and<br>
reactivate them as soon as that screen is brought to front again.<br>
·<br>
All memory allocations within Intuition make use of memory pools, which significantly reduces<br>
system memory fragmentation.<br>
·<br>
Intuition windows can be dragged and resized in real time (opaquely) without blocking any<br>
output occurring within other windows.<br>
·<br>
The DrawInfo structure does contain a dri_Screen back-pointer which makes it much easier for<br>
BOOPSI image classes to obtain information on the layout of the screen they will use for display.<br>
·<br>
Some API functions are available which allow to share pictures between different screens and/or<br>
applications, minimizing the need for reloading and remapping. Usage of these functions greatly<br>
reduces memory consumption and increases performance.<br>
·<br>
An official method has been introduced to add custom gadgets to a window`s titlebar in a legal<br>
and effortless way. This increases visual consistency and ensures future compatibility.<br>
9<br>
<a name=10></a>·<br>
A new ReAction class has been added which implements pop-up menus.<br>
·<br>
A number of long-standing bugs and quirks of Intuition have been finally fixed and code<br>
optimizations have been applied where possible.<br>
·<br>
The look and feel of every element of the Intuition GUI can be configured by way of a<br>
preferences editor, and all of the user interface settings can at any time be programmatically<br>
queried with appropriate API functions.<br>
·<br>
Greatly increased the number of DrawInfo pens, for a much more refined control over the colors<br>
of all GUI elements.<br>
·<br>
Full-intensity and half-intensity bright/dark pens (used in pseudo-3D effects) can be defined in<br>
terms of contrast relative to a particular base pen and therefore automatically computed by<br>
Intuition.<br>
·<br>
The style of almost any frame used in the GUI can be set as 3D, XEN-like or flat (thick or thin).<br>
Each of these styles, in turn, can be fine-tuned by configuring the appropriate DrawInfo pens.<br>
·<br>
Virtually every element of the GUI can be textured with a bitmap. The user can select different<br>
bitmaps for buttons, scrollers, menus, window backgrounds, requester backgrounds, screen<br>
titlebars, window titlebars and window borders. For most of these elements, a separate texture<br>
can also be associated to each visual state (selected, inactive, disabled...).<br>
·<br>
On hi/truecolor screens, most of the 3D elements having a texture as background can have their<br>
bright and dark edges drawn as brighter/darker shades of the texture. This spares the user from<br>
the hassle of finding suitable edges colors every time a different texture is chosen and also<br>
conveys a more realistic 3D effect.<br>
·<br>
The look of scrollers can be configured in every detail, such as the type of background (solid,<br>
textured or furrow-like), the thickness of the container`sborder, the knob color, the style of the<br>
arrows and much more. Separate configurations are possible for scrollers in window borders and<br>
scrollers inside windows.<br>
·<br>
Intuition menus can optionally be brought up under the mouse pointer (pop-up) rather than on<br>
top of the screen (pull-down).<br>
·<br>
Intuition menu panels can have an arbitrary shape, be drawn with partial transparency and cast a<br>
drop shadow. It is also possible to choose the style of their frame, which can be fully 3D, XEN-<br>
like or simply flat.<br>
·<br>
Intuition menus use different symbols for items that can be toggled (checkmark) and mutually<br>
exclusive items (radio button). They also display a real arrow symbol to mark sub-menus, rather<br>
than using the &quot;»&quot; character (ASCII 187) for this purpose as done previously.<br>
·<br>
Disabled gadget labels and menu items are drawn with a pseudo-3D embossed look on any<br>
screens with 16 or more colors, rather than being covered with an old-style ghosting pattern.<br>
·<br>
GadTools and ReAction interfaces share the exact same look (as configured by the user) in<br>
almost every detail, for a consistent GUI appearance.<br>
·<br>
Window titles can be placed at the left side, centered in the dragbar or centered in the whole<br>
titlebar.<br>
·<br>
The height of screen and window titlebars can be increased without changing the screen font.<br>
·<br>
The user can set the exact width of screen and window titlebar gadgets or just make them always<br>
square, wide (3:2) or narrow (2:3).<br>
10<br>
<a name=11></a>·<br>
The user can freely choose the width and height of window sizing gadgets and border arrow<br>
gadgets, as well as the thickness of all four window borders.<br>
·<br>
For ReAction windows, it is possible to choose the preferred window border (right, bottom or<br>
both) where the sizing gadget is to be placed.<br>
·<br>
The style and geometry of system gadgets in window borders and screen titlebars can be selected<br>
among a number of pre-defined choices, which can be extended by way of external style plugins.<br>
·<br>
It is possible to have individual GUI configurations for specific screens or to allow all screens to<br>
use common GUI settings.<br>
·<br>
External pictures can be used, in the form of &quot;bitmap sets&quot;, to customize the look of<br>
screen/window system gadgets, menu glyphs, and most symbols used in GadTools and ReAction<br>
gadgets (arrows, checkmarks, etc.); a small logo can also be displayed at the left side of a<br>
screen`s titlebar.<br>
·<br>
Intuition`ssysiclass (system image class) supports alpha channeling on hi/truecolor screens, thus<br>
enabling its glyphs to perform effects like anti-aliasing or realistic drop shadows on any<br>
background. This is possible for both vector glyphs and external bitmaps.<br>
·<br>
Intuition`ssysiclass offers an enhanced public API which developers can use to easily implement<br>
custom vector images taking advantage of all the special rendering features of the class.<br>
·<br>
Intuition`ssysiclass features several new image types including those commonly used for titlebar<br>
gadgets, such as iconify, pop-up, padlock... It also offers a generic frame suitable to implement<br>
titlebar gadgets with a custom graphic or textual content.<br>
·<br>
Introduces Meta-Dragging and Meta-Sizing for windows: Appropriate qualifier keys allow the<br>
user to drag windows by clicking inside their area and resize them by any border or corner.<br>

through built-in DHCP client; activate a networking interface and your Amiga automatically<br>
becomes part of your local network. This enables you to use cable and DSL modems with your<br>
Amiga.<br>
·<br>
Uses a small, but comprehensive set of Amiga specific administration tools and configuration<br>
files; easier to learn and use than plain Unix style commands and files.<br>
·<br>
Just one command required to start up and make your Amiga part of your network; no need to<br>
configure routes, IP addresses and domain name system servers separately.<br>
·<br>
Supports Ethernet (broadcast) and PPP, SLIP, CSLIP (point-to-point) networking.<br>
·<br>
Completely localized, with error messages and reports printed in your native language.<br>
·<br>
Built-in Internet Superserver (&quot;inetd&quot;) to start server application software in response to client<br>
requests (e.g. Apache web server, Samba file server, etc.).<br>
·<br>
Built-in &quot;TCP:&quot; device handler which makes it possible to use the TCP/IP stack functionality<br>
from within shell scripts or Arexx programs.<br>
·<br>
Integrated IP packet filter (IPF) and network address translation (NAT); build your own firewall<br>
or use your Amiga as a network gateway.<br>
·<br>
Uses the SANA-II standard for networking drivers; supports the release 2, 3 and 4 extensions<br>
such as for direct memory access and dial-up networking.<br>
·<br>
Multicasting supported.<br>
·<br>
Built-in support for the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF); monitor the local networking using your<br>
Amiga.<br>
·<br>
Greatly enhanced application programming interface which gives developers control over the<br>
networking interfaces, routing and kernel behaviour, allows for data to be filtered, monitored and<br>
reshaped; create your own firewall, check which requests your Amiga receives from the network,<br>
deny incoming or outgoing connections. The enhanced application programming interface is still<br>
backwards compatible with AmiTCP V4.<br>
·<br>
Comes with special networking drivers for dial-up networking (asynchronous PPP; for modems<br>
and ISDN adaptors which behave like modems) and DSL access (PPP over Ethernet).<br>
·<br>
Driver for PPP over Ethernet supports the SANA-II standard for networking drivers including the<br>
release 2, 3 and 4 extensions such for as direct memory access. A special &quot;low overhead&quot; mode<br>
increases networking performance by cutting the path short which lies between the Ethernet<br>
driver and the TCP/IP stack.<br>
·<br>
Both PPP drivers (asynchronous PPP and PPP over Ethernet) support automatic configuration of<br>
local and network addresses, routes and domain name system server addresses. Link quality<br>
monitoring and testing, authentication with plain text and encrypted passwords (CHAP and MS-<br>
CHAP) are supported.<br>
·<br>
Driver for PPP over Ethernet includes security features to discourage password sniffing on the<br>
network.<br>

encoding which supports encryption with a private key.<br>
·<br>
Important design optimization which makes it faster than AmiSSL v1.<br>
·<br>
Used as main SSL library in IBrowse. Programs that use AmiSSL v1 (YAM, AWeb, SimpleMail<br>
etc) will need only minimal modifications to work with AmiSSL v2.<br>

)<br>
·<br>
Packet writing support for those CD-RW`s that don`t support Mount Rainier.<br>
<i><b>USB stack</b></i><br>
OS4 will include a USB stack to support peripherals using the USB standard for connectivity.<br>As the stack is part of the OS it can be available during boot, allowing the use of USB mice and<br>
keyboards in the early startup menu.<br>The USB stack has multilanguage support allowing the user to use other languages with USB<br>
devices which supports this feature for device name, descriptions etc.<br>Some features of the USB stack can be controlled by the user - e.g. whether an attachment<br>
notification window should be opened when a new USB device is attached, and how long the<br>
window should stay open. Also the amount of logging the USB stack should perform can be<br>
controlled by the user.<br>Appropriate drivers exist for hubs, mice and keyboards. Drivers for scanning and printing are also<br>
available with the stack.<br>Drivers for USB Mass Storage devices (harddisk etc.) and Human Interface Devices (multimedia<br>
keyboards, scroll-mice etc.) are in the works along with a GUI for viewing attached USB devices<br>
and their status.<br>Currently supported hardware includes the Highway USB cards as well as the Thylacine Zorro 2<br>

<i><b>"Media Toolbox": HDToolbox replacement</b></i><br>
Media Toolbox is an advanced and feature-rich partitioning and preparation tool for a wide variety<br>
of media, with a comprehensive SCSI toolkit thrown in for good measure. <br>Partitioning is made easy by the use of a simple and user-friendly GUI. <br>
15<br>
<a name=16></a>Complex operations like setting up partitions for OS installations (OS4, Linux, mixed OS4-Linux)<br>
are made easy by the use of &quot;layout templates&quot;. Salvage and recovery of disk layouts are handled in<br>
the same way. <br>One can choose between two modes of operations, "Normal" and "Expert" (power users). In<br>
"Expert" mode the user can edit almost any value of the RDB.<br>The inbuilt SCSI toolkit sports features such as a rich lowlevel-format (including progress<br>indication and Iomega support), fast disk/partition erase, CD-R brand identification and SCSI mode<br>
pages visual editing.<br>
<i><b>InstallerNG (replacement of the Commodore Installer)</b></i><br>

·<br>
Nice GUI: The built-in GUI is based on a BOOPSI class-collection; these classes allow easy<br>
font-adaption and resizing. Additionally, you may &quot;plug-in&quot; other GUI-systems (like MUI,<br>
BGUI, ...) via a shared library called &quot;installergui.library&quot;.<br>
·<br>
"Help" window can stay open, while you install your packages; this is a built-in feature and<br>
should be provided by every GUI.<br>
·<br>
Comfortable Workbench Start: if you start InstallerNG from Workbench and provide it with no<br>
script via tooltypes a requester pops up asking you whether you want to load a script by a file-<br>
requester or if you want to app-iconify the installer. If you drop a script-file on the application<br>
icon the InstallerNG is started.<br>
·<br>
Flexible interpretation: if an error raises while the interpretation process, InstallerNG allows you<br>
to continue at the very next function.<br>
·<br>
New<br>

·<br>
Full installation control: If you want to, the InstallerNG asks for confirmation of every action, no<br>
matter what the script-programmer specified in his installer script.<br>
<i><b>AmiDock</b></i><br>
The OS4.0 version of AmiDock is a "from the ground up redesigned" version of OS3.9<br>
tm<br>
`s<br>
AmiDock.<br>The new AmiDock features a much improved icon layout engine together with text- and button<br>
mode docks.<br>AmiDock is now far more interactive than the old version. A lot of things like the arrangement,<br>
addition or removal of icons, categories and docks can now be achieved without opening the<br>
preferences dialog.<br>The visual appearance of AmiDock now supports borderless, dragbar-less and even transparent<br>
docks to integrate easily into every Workbench setup. <br>
16<br>
<a name=17></a>The font- and color-setup is now also fully customizable and each dock can be minimized to a tiny<br>
bar to save space on the Workbench screen. Every icon or dock can now have its own hotkey for<br>
easy and quick access of often used items.<br>The most impressive new feature is the possibility to have active content within a dock in the form<br>
of "plug-ins". An AmiDock plug-in is called a &quot;docky&quot;. Each docky has full access to all of<br>
AmiDock's internal functions and can cater for a virtually endless number of features. <br>The usage of dockies is very simple - adding a docky (for example by using drag&amp;drop) will add<br>
and activate the docky and removing it will disable it. A virtually unlimited number of dockies can<br>
run simultaneously in every dock you want.<br>A number of dockies are included with OS4.0; the most-requested feature - subdocks - was made<br>
possible using a docky. There is also a docky which minimizes a dock automatically if the mouse<br>
pointer is not any longer over the dock. Other included dockies allow you to have a clock, a lens,<br>
animations and other active content within a dock.<br>The most thrilling applications will surely come from third party programmers in the form of third-<br>
party dockies (the API will be released with OS4.0) - just imagine having the current network<br>
traffic, the printer status, volume settings, the current rendering process of your raytracer and other<br>
such things in the form of a small and responsive picture within your dock.<br>
<i><b>application.library</b></i><br>
This new library handles a lot of things which were up to now sorely lacking in AmigaOS.<br>Third-party applications can now "introduce themselves" to the system as &quot;application&quot; and can<br>
benefit by doing so in several ways. <br>By way of example: AmiDock will add the applications to the main dock to provide a taskbar-like<br>
access to the application. Each application can of course specify if it wants to run invisible in the<br>
background, with a static icon or even by displaying a docky to provide some advanced control<br>
features.<br>Applications which make use of this new library provide standard interfaces for opening and<br>
printing documents, can be quit, iconified, called to front, put to back etc. using a standard interface<br>
(i.e. AmiDock shows some popup-menus for applications and calls the application to front when it<br>
was clicked in the dock).<br>There is now also a standard way to access a list of last-used documents and applications to get a<br>
faster access to your most recently used items.<br>Whats more, application.library finally adds much requested possibility for applications to prevent<br>
screensavers from starting (for example this is very annoying when watching a movie or working<br>
with a video application).<br>Even OS4-games can take advantage of this new library as they can tell other applications to "shut<br>
up" as they need a non-disturbed game-mode where no requester should pop-up, no background<br>
sounds should be played etc.<br>The application.library finally also makes accessing program preferences as easy as pie by providing<br>
an advanced XML-based preferences object system which allows storing whatever information is<br>
required in a very versatile and flexible way. This puts an end to the different proprietary<br>
preferences-system used by most applications which are unreadable for users and require a lot of<br>
work on the part of developers.<br>

AmigaInput unifies the game programmer`sneed to support various input devices like joysticks,<br>
pads, steering wheels, keyboards and mice using one common API. <br>AmigaInput is primarily aimed at multimedia and game programmers who want to support a wide<br>
range of input devices, making the various API`s like lowlevel.library, gameport.device and<br>
PSXport.device a thing of the past. Programmers will not need to care about how a device is<br>
connected to the system.<br>Supported interfaces include:<br>
·<br>
USB ports<br>
·<br>
Classic joystick ports<br>
·<br>
