@{fg shine} Welcome@{fg text}

 Well as always were back again to not disapoint you this time, with
some exclusives and reviews of things that have not even yet been
reviewed in the mainstream mags. First off is our EXCLUSIVE interview
with Vulcan Software which is something not to be missed. We also
have a review of the latest game from Vulcan Software called Uropa 2,
please note we reviewed this before any of the mainstream mags did :)

 There are all the reviews of utils and games that you have come to
expect, the news is here as always and the articles section is packed
with useful information and stuff to read like the Amiga games for
'97/'98 and the 'How to use a BBS' article which should come in handy!

 Well for another month I say goodbye, but I hope you enjoy this
issue and will join us next month for the BUMPER christmas issue!!!

@{fg shine} Latest from Vulcan@{fg text}

 Vulcan Software Ltd is proud to announce the signing of The World
Foundry.

Vulcan has signed The World Foundry in it`s entirety and will be
publishing all World Foundry titles under the Vulcan Software banner,
beginning with Explorer2260 and Maim & Mangle.

The World Foundry was formed in September of this year from Digital
Anarchy Software, Deimos Design and Intuition Software with the
intention of pooling knowledge and resources to develop high
specification Amiga titles. Vulcan has been in talks with all the
members of The World Foundry for some time and are very excited about
the prospect of adding their talents and commitment to our organisation.
The World Foundry is a welcome addition to `The Vulcan Army' which
already consists of some 14 development teams and over 100 skilled
individuals.

The primary aim of The World Foundry is to develop high quality, high
specification games for the Amiga market which will take full advantage
of expanded Amigas and PPC equipped machines. This concentration on
higher spec Amigas falls in perfectly with Vulcan`s current drive to
push the Amiga forward. Vulcan and all it`s developers have made a
commitment to the Amiga and the Amiga Community, through our combined
efforts and enthusiasm we can help shape the future, a future which is
starting to look very bright indeed.

@{fg shine} SV discount offers@{fg text}

25.10.1997   PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX offers limited shareware discount

PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX, namely Andreas R. Kleinert, may be known as
the procucers of some well known Amiga programs, such as SuperView,
the "ak Datatypes" and various other commercial and non-commercial
software products and add-on software.

Since we think, that Amiga - and some upcoming Amiga events in special -
should gain some more audience and attention, we have decided to offer
a shareware discount on our products limited until the end of the
"Computer 97" show, taking place in Cologne from 14th-16th November.

If your order is sent to us until 16th November (postal stamp's date)
we will grant you the following discounts on our products:


Discount range #1
-----------------
If you already are a registered user of one of our products (*)
OR select more than one product from the list below, you get these for
he discount price instead of the regular one (in brackets).

     Product                                   regular     discount

  O  SuperView/SViewNG, personalized keyfile   (30 DM)     20 DM
     * Aminet:gfx/show/SViewNG.lha
       - http://www.amigaworld.com/support/sview/

  O  PNG-Box,           personalized keyfile   (20 DM)     15 DM
     * Aminet:gfx/conv/PNG-Box.lha
       - http://www.amigaworld.com/support/png-box/

  O  DRAFU,             personalized keyfile   (30 DM)     20 DM
     * Aminet:misc/math/DRAFU.lha
       - http://www.amigaworld.com/support/drafu/

  O  PPC-Modules for SuperView-Library 19.x    (30 DM)     25 DM
     * not freely distributable
       - http://www.amigaworld.com/support/sview/

You will receive your keyfile (respectively the PPC modules) via eMail
(mention your email address), unless you add 5 DM postage/disk fee for
european and 10 DM for overseas "snail mailing".


Discount range #2
-----------------
As you know, you won't receive anything for registering akJFIF-Datatype
and/or akPNG-Datatype except fame and (usually) some honorable mention
in the documentation. Nevertheless, these fees have been decreased, too
- since you may wish to add that value to your "Discount range #1" order:

     Product                                   regular     discount

  O  akPNG-Datatype,                           (15 DM)     10 DM
     * Aminet:util/dtype/akPNG43x.lha
       - http://www.amigaworld.com/support/akpng/

  O  akJFIF-Datatype,                          (15 DM)     10 DM
     * Aminet:util/dtype/akJFIF43x.lha
       - http://www.amigaworld.com/support/akjfif/

==========================================================================
Please note (again), that all these offers are limited until 16th November
1997, the last day of the "Computer 97" in Cologne (for detailed
information, see http://www.computer97.de)
==========================================================================

And now to something completely different:


SuperView-Library related products
----------------------------------

Picture Manager:

You may have noticed, that Picture Manager professional 4.1 (PMPro) in
the english version now is being distributed by BlitterSoft in England.
Since PMPro is making use of SuperView-Library, it may be interesting to
note, that the price has been lowered, too. It's now 39.95 UKP for
end-users (see http://blittersoft.wildnet.co.uk/pmpro.htm or download
the demo version from Aminet:biz/demo/pmpdemo.lha)

Orders have to be addressed to BlitterSoft or your local dealer, please
don't place any orders to PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX !


Image Engineer:  (*)

As the author, Simon Edwards, already stated on his homepage under
http://yallara.cs.rmit.edu.au/~sbe/ , he has moved to the Netherlands,
and the australian registration site can't accept any registrations
any longer. Thus, any registration forms should be addressed to the
european registration site, which in fact is PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX.

Image Engineer BTW is an image processing program, that makes use
of SuperView-Library (see AmiNet:gfx/edit/ImEngV3.41p1.lha and
/ImEngV3.41p2.lha) for loading and saving graphic files, which is
the reason, why any registered Image Engineer users are allowed to make
use of the "Discount range #1" and "Discount range #2" offers, too.
There's no discount on Image Engineer registrations, though
(the european fee is 55 DM or equivalent in other currencies).

Please address all orders to:

  PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX
  Andreas R. Kleinert
  Sandstrasse 1         Fax:   +49-271-22869
  D-57072 Siegen        eMail: Andreas_Kleinert@t-online.de
  Germany               WWW:   http://home.t-online.de/Andreas_Kleinert/

@{fg shine} AmigaSOC annouce UK web page@{fg text}

September 1st sees the launch of AmigaSoc UK's web site
(http://uk.amigasoc.org). Apart from in-depth reviews and features, we
will also be offering the opportunity to help people out with any
Amiga-related problems they may have, as well as other services which
are due to be implemented within the next few weeks. We are also
looking to provide a comprehensive listing of all UK Amiga groups, so
if you represent one of them, please get in contact with us at
webmaster@uk.amigasoc.org.

AmigaSoc was founded from the Queen Mary and Westfield College,
University of London Amiga Society (http://www.qmw.ac.uk), with which
we still maintain strong links, to create a UK-wide centre for users
and developers alike to join together. The aim of this union is to
provide a starting point for developers to work together in order to
avoid replication of effort, to provide the products that users really
want, and most importantly to re-establish the Amiga's foothold in the
computer industry. We are pleased to be affiliated to The Jay Miner
Society for the advancement of Personal Computing in our efforts to
achieve these goals.

AmigaSoc is a non profit making organisation.

AmigaSoc UK was founded in June 1997 by Glenn Clarke
(g.a.clarke@qmw.ac.uk), Andrew Elia (odin@dcs.qmw.ac.uk), Chris
Livermore (chrisl@cursci.co.uk), Julian Sadotti, and Dan Winfield
(dan@immstudios.com).

Our CV
------
* AmigaSoc organised the Developers Conference which was
held at the World of Amiga show in May 1997 with assistance from Ben
Vost of Amiga Format magazine (ben@subway.demon.co.uk), Kermit Woodall
of Nova Design Inc. (kermit@novadesign.com), and the Jay Miner Society
for the Advancement of Personal Computing (http://www.jms.org).

* AmigaSoc was approached by the producer of "Chips with Everything"
as shown on The Computer Channel (http://www.computerchannel.co.uk) in
order to assist with production of an Amiga feature. AmigaSoc member
Dan Winfield has since appeared on this show several times.

* AmigaSoc founders Chris Livermore and Dan Winfield have written
articles for Amiga Format
(http://www.futurenet.com/mags/amigaformat/amigaformat.html) and Amiga
Computing, respectively.

Our site has been kindly donated by IMM Studios
(http://www.immstudios.com), an Internet consultancy specialising in
unparalleled CGI technologies (such as EZCGI ("http://www.ezcgi.com").
Not only is it run and owned by Amiga people, but they have an
impressive list of clients including The Times Newspapers
(http://www.the-times.co.uk), FHM magazine (http://www.fhm.co.uk/fhm),
Arsenal FC (http://www.arsenal.co.uk), and Volkswagen UK
(http://www.volkswagen.co.uk).

@{fg shine} The Final Odyssey OUT SOON...@{fg text}

THE FINAL ODYSSEY - This masterpiece of a game will be released at the
end of November  best described as an Action/Adventure/Puzzler, the
Final  Odyssey combines detailed and entertaining graphics and gameplay
to  perfection. You play the part of Theseus on his quest to free six
rather  lovely maidens from the evil clutches of the Minotaur. The Final
Odyssey is so vast that we have been unable to reach the end (somewhat
disturbing as we're supposed to be testing it) but then rather
unsurprising as some of the levels reconstruct themselves everytime you

Peter Spinaze is Vulcan's multi talented developer of this fine game.
The beautifully crafted graphics in The Final Odyssey have won Peter a
scholarship at Silicon Studio which is a state of the art international
facility dedicated to training digital artists.

Silicon Studio is one of only 3 flagship training centres world-wide and
is the most advanced digital media training centre in the industry in
the Asia Pacific region to date.

Peter's particular scholarship is a 3D Animation scholarship. He is
using Alias/Wavefront PowerAnimator as his 3D Rendering software and
using the latest Silicon Graphics hardware.  The same gear they used to
make Jurassic Park etc. The hardware consists of O2's, Octane's, and an
Onyx2 Infinite Reality supercomputer.

We are all very proud of him here at Vulcan but not at all surprised.

@{fg shine} Australian latest news@{fg text}

 You may have heard mention in AIO before about a second Australian Amiga
Show.  Truth be told, it was supposed to have occurred in October but
never did.  Instead it has been delayed until early next year.  This has
apparently been to ensure that the Australian Amiga audience gets the best
Amiga show possible, and since it will be after the Computer 97 show in
Cologne where Gateway/Amiga Inc. are supposedly set to make some notable
announcements, this could well prove to be a good move.

 Not so good news is the report of the closure of Amadeus computers in
Sydney, Australia.  They served many years supporting the Amiga but due to
financial difficulties have gone into liquidation.  Amadeus held many
distribution rights in Australia, among these being the official
distributer for Digita products such as Wordworth.  It is now a waiting
game to see which Amiga dealers pick up those rights.

@{fg shine} Escape from Hammy town@{fg text}

 Escape from hammy town or also known as EFHT is a graphics
adventure in the style of the Monkey Island and many
Lucas Arts style games.

 The main difference is the graphics are no where near the same
standard. The gameplay is quite good and the main charactor
moves smoothly and interacts with the other charactors and
backgrounds nicely. The graphics are terible but the author
does note that he is not a graphics artist so you can't expect
them to be of any quality. 

 EFHT runs good and the music is to an exceptable standard,
the game was created with the GRAAL adventure language which
is a new graphics adventure game creator, this may not be
the game to show it off with down to the graphics.

 The game boasts 24 locations with other charactor interaction.
Overall if your looking for an adventure game this will do as
a good time filler, although the graphics are awful to look
at the gameplay and puzzles do the job for a while.

@{fg shine} ToadsDEMO@{fg text}

 Toads is a game where you control the car and have to ride around and
run over the oncomming toads. This game suggests to be violent in the
Short of the Aminet readme, but apart from a little blood I can't
really see anything that would offend anyone or stop you playing it.

 This is only a demo version of the full game, and I couldn't really
tell you whether the full game is going to cost or if it will be PD
and this is juts a test version as it doesn't state in the documents.

 This demo comes with around 5 levels and 2 cars which you can choose
from, each car has different abilitys, for instants some are faster than
others but some can sustain more damage. Once the game has loaded you'll
notice toads either zooming or going slowly from one side to the other,
your aim is to kill a certain amount (shown at the start of the level)
of toads to progress to the next level.

 The game is alright for a while and will entertain you when you have
a few drunk mates over, after a while though the games gets a little
boring and will probably end up being one of those games that sit on
your HD and you never play again.

@{fg shine} Amipet V1.10b Vs. Amitamagotchi V0.53@{fg text}

@{b} Amipet@{ub}

 Amipet is one of my long running favourites of thes types of programs,
although the window is much smaller, it is easy to control and can
sit in the side of your screen without much hassle. Most of the options
have been added into this version just the Punish (disipline) and
Vet options that don't work but will obviously come in later version.

 Although there is not much change to Amipet there are one or two
differences that are a must and improve the program over the last
version which was reviewed last issue. A nice features of Amipet
that was there last version but is worth mensioning again is the
feature of if you have a battery backed up clock it will calculate
how many hours it has been since you have last run it, so if you
go on holiday and forget about it next time you run it, it will die.

 This version it doesn't seem to go the toilet so often so you
are not constantly pressing the Clean button.

 Although Amipet doesn't look like the Tamagotchi® it is very small
and will fit away with no hassle, just don't remeber to leave it
to long or it'll die.

@{b} Amitamagotchi@{ub}

 Amitamagotchi has improved alot since the last version, at last it
does not eat CPU time like it had never eaten before. Last version
you wouldn't be able to run anything else while it is running, but
now you can get things like Dopus up with no hassle at all. Although
the computer will slow down a bit it is hardly noticable.

 My main concern about Amitamgotchi is the size of it, if your
running in Hi-Res like me it takes a big section of your WB screen
up, so things can be come hidden behind it. This is one of the
most authentic Tamagotchis on the Amiga, with it's original Tamagotchi
graphics and sounds it comes close to the real thing.

 Most of the buttons work now encluding the Vet option. There are
also now prefs so you can speed up the tamagotchi and how fast it
eats and that type of thing.

 Overall this is better for new improvements, you can also register
Amitamagotchi free of charge which of course is another nice bonus.
The main problem with Amitama is the size of the thing.

@{b}Overall Comments:@{ub}

 Amipet was the best contender but it was let down by having no
sound and the GFX weren't hot to say the least. Amitamagotchi
put up a very good fight, but if Amipet gets some sound in and
spices the GFX up a bit I can see this battle becoming ugly!

@{b}Note to the Authors:@{ub}

 If the authors of either of these programs are reading try to
make a version that can go onto any screen and not just stick
to the WB screen, that'd be a GREAT feature.

@{fg shine} Blade preview@{fg text}

 Blade is a rollplay type of game, you have a certain amount of
moves to move your four charactors with and once your moves
which is 30 for each charactor has run out you have to end
your turn and let the monsters who are computer controlled take
there turn. This version is only a demo and compressed take
about 1.8meg up, it's a new game from Alive Media software so
the full game will be comercial.

 You start off in a forest with shops lined along the side
of you, you have four charactors, all with there own pesonality
and strenths. As usual it's the normal fantasy type of charactors
with the Barberian type of person being the strongest then
you get your Elf/ogre the woman person who as usual has no
name or charactor type and the Wizard with all the special
powers who can zapp the bad guys ;)

 The games graphics are very impressive and there are versions
for AGA owners and a cut GFX version for ECS owners. Although
didn't have chance to look at the ECS version the game makes
it clear that they have had to cut not much, so it will all look
very nice. The title screens and pictures are good with some
3d rendered ones thrown in, like when you quit you see a rendered
picture of a man lieing stabbed on the floor. The music is
atmosferic and all in all it makes it a great game.

 My main worry is that this game is only for the type of people
who like this type of 'thinking mans game' I myself do not have
the time to play these types of games as they require clicking
about alot ending moves and selecting charators, bur even after
the first 5 minutes of playing this I was hooked.

 Overall the graphics and music are very impressive, the game
runs smoothly and overall this game is a gem. I can't wait
for the full game to come out.

 @{b}NOTE:@{ub} I had to go through alot of trouble to get this demo
installed to my HD otherwise it doesn't run on it's own, follow

@node "gr5" "Uropa 2"

@{fg shine} Uropa 2 - Vulcan Software@{fg text}

 Uropa 2 is the latest installment from Vulcan Software, as Vulcan
stated some time ago, this is a CD release as all their games are
going to be now.

 Uropa 2 can either be booted via the intro or go straight into the game,
if you choose to load via the intro the game is automatically launched
after the intro had finished. The intro to the game is fully rendered
and lasts around 7 minutes. The graphics to the intro are absolutely
amazing, this coupled with the digital speech makes the intro totally
outstanding, it's one of the best intros i've seen for a long time
and already before playing the game it shows the time and effort that
Austex Software and Vulcan have put in.
 The intro takes you around the various planets that are involved and
shows you the different spaceships blowing each other out of the sky,
while watching you get a running commentary from Lisa of Vulcan software
which has been changed slightly to give it a more of an android sound.

 After the intro has finished the game will be booted. Once the game
has loaded you have plenty of options to play around, with various
options to change and edit. After you have played around with the
prefs it's time to start the game.

 The game itself has "10 Gigantic" missions to complete, each one of
these have to be completed before proceeding to the next mission. Every
mission has different tasks you have to complete, all are explained
before the game and are also read to you in the digital speech. There
is another 'type' of game to Uropa 2 which will require a serial
link up like the Null Modem cable for Two Amigas to battle it out, the
idea of these games is to fly around and battle it out with the other
player. This is a separate part to the game but you will encounter
various missions through-out the game that will require playing these
types of 3D vector levels.

 The main game is from an 3D isometric view, the controls are easy
enough to get the hang of, you may be confused with the angle at
first but it's only a matter of seconds before you get used to the
idea of the movement. You control a hovering robot which bobs up
and down while in movement, you can go to different locations
were you will encounter things like humans which at the very start
of mission 1 have to be guided to safety. There are other people
and robots that you will encounter that do different things like
either help you or have to be destroyed. Once in a room you have
to search objects to find guns, ammo, cards, upgrades. etc...
you can also search dead humans, beds, tables, plants and chests as
well as other things. The search will take a few seconds to
take place, this is added as effect. You can access computers and
terminals which control other parts of the level like accessing
transporters.

 The game requires any Amiga, Hard Drive, 68000 CPU, 2mb Memory (1mb
Chip & 1mb Any), 4 x Speed CD-Rom. I found that the 4 x Speed
CD-Rom is not totally necessary for the in-game and intro but it
is recommended as minimum, when I tested it with a 2 x Speed CD-Rom
it seemed to work fine. I wouldn't recommend a 2 x Speed CD-Rom but
if your desperate you could get away with it. The game will work
fine with all the above but the better spec machine you have, the better
& faster the game is with enhanced sound and graphics. If you
only have a 68000 CPU you will be stuck on the 3D vector flying bit
as it ran so slow when I tested it on a A600.

 Overall this is a brilliant game with a great intro & sound, the
ingame graphics both for normal play and vector play are very well
rendered and carefully drawn for normal play. The game is easy to
get into and will last you ages with all the levels it has, you can
save and load games so you don't have to restart. Make sure this
game is on your Christmas list as its totally BRILLIANT!!!

@{fg shine} Cheats & Tips for TFX & Wendetta@{fg text}

@{b}Written by Woober/Data Division^Prospect@{ub}

                                 1. Cheats
                                 2. Hacks

1. Cheats:
=========
Type your first and last names and call sign. Push [Ctrl]+[Enter]
and you'll be warped past the training missions.
While flying hold down [Right Shift] and type: plop - this will render
your fighter invunerable to missiles. When you crash you'll skip to the
next mission!

2. Hack:
=======
Hack your way through TFX saving you time and putting an end to the
frustration of having to replay through missions every time it's your
misfortune to die. Read on for how to do this and how to achieve some
other handy cheats ...

1. Backing up your pilot:
------------------------
There are 10 pilot spaces on the roster board in TFX. If you save a
pilot on the first space the file is saved under TFXSAV.0. If you
save your pilot under the second space it's saved under TFXSAV.1 and
so on. Let's assume that your pilot is saved under TFXSAV.0. Copy the
TFXSAV.0 file to TFXBAK.0 by typing:

copy tfxsav.0 tfxbak.0

2. Cheating to increase your points:
-----------------------------------
Go into your C:\TFX directory and type the following:
copy tfxsav.0 tfxsav.ba1

then type: debug tfxsav.0 or any other TFXSAV file. Finally type
in the following to give yourself a massive 16777215 points:

E 0140 00 00 FF FF FF
W
Q

3. Increasing your pilot rank:
-----------------------------
Debug any TFXSAV file and then enter the following codes to become
a 1st Lieutenant:

E 013F 01
W
Q

Change the 01 on the first line to a higher number for higher rank:

02 Captain
03 Major
04 Lt Colonel
05 Colonel
06 General

4. Resurrect yourself if you happen to crash or be captured:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Debug any of the TFXSAV files and enter these simple but highly
effective codes:

E 01F4 00
E 01AB 00
W
Q

5. How to bypass the training missions and get on to the Tours of Duty:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Do the debug routine - as mentioned countless times before - and enter:

E 01AB 00
E 01AD 01
E 01AF 3E
W
Q

6. Skipping through the Tour of Duty and Flaspoint missions:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Debug TFXSAV.2 (ooh! A different one) then to put yourself in one of
the Tour of Duty or Flashpoint missions type in one of the following:

E 01AD 10       The F117-A
E 01AD 0F       The YF 22
E 01AD 0E       The EFA
E 01AD 0A       The Drug War
E 01AD 0B       Defiance in The Desert
E 01AD 0C       Operation Restore Hope Two
E 01AD 0D       Bosnia: The Never Ending War
E 01AD 0C       The Doomsday Ship

Having done this you must now put in one of the following codes:

E 01AF 05       Mission 1
E 01AF 0A       Mission 2
E 01AF 10       Mission 3
E 01AF 15       Mission 4
E 01AF 1A       Mission 5
E 01AF 20       Mission 6
E 01AF 25       Mission 7
E 01AF 2A       Mission 8
E 01AF 30       Mission 9
E 01AF 3A       Mission 10

@{fg shine} Games reviews and what there score means@{fg text}

 Games are reviewed mostly on playability and how long they will last
you, although some big games with fancy graphics might be expected to
get good reviews it is not always the case. A small 10k game might
get a better overall score than a 1Mb game. It is not that the 1Mb
game isn't any good it's just that the playablility might be non
exsistant and there is no point in downloading a huge file if it
will last a couple of minutes and you will only run it to show off
to friends.

 90%+    -  AIO GOLD (amazing)

 70-89%  -  Nice but some let downs

@{fg shine} Fast Virus Killer V1.11@{fg text}

 As people left the Amiga so did viruses but funnly enough
there are still people who call themselves programmers or
coders who want to make these stupid things to wreck the
lives of others. Luckly though we have dedicated people
who spend their time making programs to rid the Amiga world
from viri.

 This is a fairly new virus killer and has all the basic
options you have come to expect from a virus killer. The
programs checks files in a nice simple way similar to VirusZ,
although does not tell you what the file type it, but I
suspect this will come later. 

 This is really only a small review to let you know of the
existance of Fastviruskiller but it is very good if you
just want to have a small killer that doesn't take up
much of your HD space, useful to people with smaller HD's.
Fastviruskiller is only 20k in size so it can fit away
neatly in any corner of your HD and not waste valuable
space like some of the more complicated virus killers.

 At the moment FVK does not check archives but this is
planned for a later release. Overall this is a great
fast virus killer and very small, if you don't have much
space left i'd recommend this!

@{fg shine} Magnum Page & Chat@{fg text}

 If you saw last months issue you'll know we reviewed some MAX bbs
doors, so this month we've decided to review some more. Magnum
Chat and Magnum Page come together in a set, as you might expect
as they both have the word Magnum in them.

 They can be run together or you can just use one or the other, I
choose to have them both running so once i've answered the pager
it runs the chatter stright after. Magnum page is your usual pager
with all the features and options you have come to expect from
a pager. While the pager is paging it brings up a window on the
Maxs BBS screen, so to save flicking from the WB to MAX like
with Kewlpage. The options are either, cancel the page, tell
the user your busy or answer the page. 

 Once you've answered the page you can have any chat program you
like running, but it is probably best to have Magnum chat as they
then look like there in a set, and makes the cosmetic side of things
alot better. Magnum chat is pretty pleasing to the eye and doesn't
have any faults or bugs as far as i can see. Its your usual chatter
with options like Raw up & download, clear screens and all the
other options you can't do without for a chat program. Although
magnum chat doesn't have a button bank like with Yaanchat you
can get by easily with the Ctrl & (KEY) commands. I have been told
by the author that the Automatic word type of options is to be
added into the next version which is comming soon. This idea is
if you type something like "Chris" and press space then Magnum Chat
will automaticly print "Chris, the editor of AIO" or something
similar along those lines.

@{fg shine} BlitzView V0.9b@{fg text}

 If you've ever needed to show an IFF picture and can never find
a small enough, quick enough and compact enough one well, get this
and your problems will be solved.

 BlitzView is small Med-Res picture viewer made in Blitz Basic,
it shows the pictures quickly and even showed a Hi-Res picture
I had with a little bit cut off, so it is even more useful than
it actually says. The only problem with BlitzView is that it can
only show Med-Res pictures in IFF format, although this is a
great small and quick IFF viewer it would be nice to see other
picture formats supported in a later version so to have just one
program to show all your pictures and not have different programs
for each format.

 Overall Blitzview is nice and small, it is also very quick at
showing the picture, maybe in future versions we could see a
version with more picture formats supported like Jpeg, Gif,
Iff (Low-Res & Hi-Res) it would also be nice if a file selector
came up instead of the CLI command style.

@{fg shine} Hippoplayer Update to V2.41@{fg text}

 The latest version of Hippoplayer has just been released. Not really
a major update, just a few fixes and enhancements, but still worth
getting hold of. No Impulse Tracker ( .IT ) mods are supported yet,
but I suppose that could be included soon!

 On the whole then, not a great deal of new features, but still manages
to be the best all round mod player!

@{fg shine} AmiCDFS V2.39@{fg text}

 Well a very long time after the previous version, comes the latest
version of this great CD Filesystem. Now up to V2.39, AmiCDFS is the
best CD filesystem on the Amiga, and I've tried quite a few! Whilst
there are many other filesystems about, I've found AmiCDFS to be the
fastest and most compatible one around, and although installation is a
manual process, it's easy and quick! The supplied mountfiles are easy
to edit to suit your own requirements, and there are plenty of options
to ensure that even non-standard CD roms function at their best.Also
included is a version of the excellent MCDPlayer, which can be used to
play audio cd's, and is also my favourite audio cd player software!
AmiCDFS also has the ability to play audio cd's using your own
favourite player software just by double-clicking on the icon, which is
supplied! This ease of use helps bring AmiCDFS above the other options,
and best of all, it's shareware! Anyone who also needs to read "Hybrid"
disks will appreciate that AmiCDFS handles multi-session, mixed-session
and even Mac CD's easily. Using this filesystem, you can even back up
files onto CD and then recover the different sessions at a later date.

 All in all I can't recommend this product enough. Quite simply it is
the best CD filesystem available for the Amiga at the moment!. Enough
said!

@node "ur6" "Scribbler V1.0"

@{fg shine} Scribbler V1.0@{fg text}

 Scribbler is another door for Maxs BBS either V1.54 or Maxs Pro,
the idea behind Scribbler is to liven up a message to next caller
door. Most message to next callers are boring and are just plain
lines of message... this one is different.

 Scribbler was written by the author as a first atempt to write
a maxs door, so he thought he'd make a simple message to next
caller door. In the end it ended up quite fancy. As i've been
rambling on for a bit your probably all dieing to know what
the difference is. The difference is it records everything you
do and plays it back to the next caller, so every mistake
you make and correct it shows the user that mistake, it is sort
of like a recording.

 This is a very good door but my only worry would be if you got
some idiot user who decided to take ages aranging letters and
deleting letters just so it takes ages, so once the user logs
on he has to sit there throughout the whole thing. If the author
is reading a useful opiton would be a quick show option so if you
got bored you could hit a key and the final message would just
come up.

 Overall it's a nice way of smartening up an old idea, you can't
go wrong just make sure your users don't abuse it.

@node "us" "Utils Scores"

@{fg shine} Utils reviews and what there score means@{fg text}

 Utils are not marked on how good they are compared to other utils,
they are marked by usefulness and what purpose they serve. As there
are so many different utils that do so many different things it is
hard to review something like MUI and then when reviewing a program
like a WB clock say it wasn't up to the standard of MUI. This is why
it is not possible to have a Top Ten list for utils.

 90%+    -  AIO GOLD (amazing)

 70-89%  -  Great but lacking some features

 50-69%  -  Not to good but it'll do

 30-49%  -  Hasn't really been thought out to well

@node "int" "Exclusive interview"

@{fg shine} Interview with Vulcan Software@{fg text}

 Again, we even astonish ourselves this time with an EXCLUSIVE
interview with Vulcan Software. Anyone you'd like to see an
interview with get in touch and we'll see what we can do!

CS : Please could you tell me how you first started Vulcan. Did you
     release any PD games or make games that never made it? Or was
     Valhalla your first game?

Valhalla was the first game we produced, we never released any games
before it, PD or otherwise. In fact Vulcan Software was formed in order
to launch Valhalla and The Lord Of Infinity as a commercial release.

CS : Did you think that Valhalla would be as big a success as it
     was and what do you think made it a success?

We believed Valhalla would be a success although we didn't envisage it
would attract the cult following it has. We were aware that it was the
first ever speech adventure for the Amiga and that, among other things,
attracted a great deal of attention. People seem to respond to the
characters and the humourous nature of the adventures, they are designed
to be completely user friendly and more cerebral thsn physical. All
these things have contributed to their popularity which is why we plan
on making seven more.

CS : Please can you tell me what games you have signed so far and
     when they are due for release

The Final Odyssey - Release date 1st November 1997 (-ED Very Soon now)
Uropa2            - Release date 1st November 1997 (-ED OUT NOW!!!)
Genetic Species   - As soon as humanly possible :)
Hellpigs          - ? 1998
Wasted Dreams     - ? 1998
Hard Target       - ? 1998
Almagica          - ? 1998
Valhalla 4        - ? 1998
Desolate          - ? 1998
3d Games Creator  - ? 1998
Breed 2000        - ? 1998

Sorry this is somewhat vague, we'll be setting more definite dates for
the 1998 releases nearer the end of the year.

CS : I have heard rumours about a 3D dungeon game creator you are
     planning, is this true and do you have any idea when it will
     be released?

Yes, we are working on The 3D Games Creator, I'm sorry, I don't have a
date for this one as yet.

CS : Has changing to CD only format affected sales at all?

Vulcan's change to Amiga CD Rom wasn't completely influenced by our
desire to sell more units. Rather it was a reflection of the excellent
quality of the games we currently have in production and also the start
of our drive to cater for higher spec machines in order to bring Amiga
gaming in line with other platforms. Also, it's much more fun than
trying to fit somthing on a floppy disk:)

As far as hard sales are concerned, quite honestly it is much too early
to tell but we are very optimistic about the future.


CS : You stated that you would be returning to selling games via
     computer stores did this ever happen?

This is still happening, and now Vulcan has exclusive distribution of
all it's titles through Weird Science and GTI, we are even more
optimitistic that scarcity of Amiga software in retail outlets becomes a
thing of the past.

CS : The football game you were planning never made it can you tell
     us why that was?

This was a joint and amicable decision between Vulcan and our
developers, after changes in both sets of circumstances:)

CS : Currently how many members do you have registered as Vulcan
     customers?

We have in the region of 10,000, although our members details have now
been transferred into the capable hands of our exclusive disributor
Weird Science who will be handling all mail order services for Vulcan
Software from now on.

CS : What do you think about the current Amiga situation with Gateway
     2000 buying the Amiga, also are you turning out enough profit
     to stay with the Amiga?

We were very pleased to hear that Gateway had come along and bought the
Amiga lock stock and barrel, this renewed our hope that the Amiga would
be revived and launched once again as a home computer in order prsesnt a
justified challenge to the PC Market. Vulcan will be supporting Gateway
and Amiga Inc. in their drive to make this a reality.

As long as there is Amiga there will be Vulcan:)

CS : Would you ever think of going into the PC market or converting
     your games to PC format?

We currently have 4 PC games in production but our main concentration of
effort will be in supporting the Amiga for the benefit of ourselves and
the Amiga community as a whole.

Vulcan is synonymous with Stubborn :)

CS : You record has shown that you produce and sign good quality games
     at low affordable prices are you planning to continue this
     pattern?

We will never release anything that we perceive as being anything less
than excellent quality. The subject of price gets quite complicated as
it is always an important consideration that prices should be as low as
possible, but when you get into the realms of games that take several
years to produce and involve 20-30 people you have to try and achieve a
fair balance. Whatever happens anyone buying a Vulcan game is assured
quality, longevity and value.

CS : Thank you for your time.

My Pleasure

@node "fe1" "PPC Wildfire"

@{fg shine} Official Wildfire announcement@{fg text}

On the 10th of October 1997 Wildfire starts the PPC competition!

After over 2 years of development for the Amiga Version and after
some really hard weeks where almost all time was spent for
converting some routines to use the PPC Boards from Phase 5
we are more then proud to present the first Alpha Version of
THE special effect animation processor for the PPC-Amiga.

We will upload a demoversion to the Aminet on Friday, 10-Oct-97:

                    biz/demo/WildfirePPC.lha

If there is NO PPC in your system then Wildfire will use the
normal routines, otherwise the PPC routines for selected
operators will be loaded. You have the possibility to turn
on/off the PPC routines of Wildfire allowing you to compare
the speed very easy.

At the Computer`97 in Cologne (14. - 16. November) the full Version
of Wildfire Amiga and Wildfire PPC will be available at
Oberland Computer.

There you have the possibitly to talk directly to Andreas Maschke,
the program author and to Andreas Kuessner, the Wildfire Project
Manager. The Amiga Version and the PPC version will be shown
live at the fair, of course.

@{fg shine} How to install Blade demo@{fg text}

 Ok if you read the review of Blade in the Games section you will
know about my troubles with installing Blade. Below is and easy
way to get the game running from HD.

 Unarchive the Blade.lha to Ram:

 Load the install script into a text editor like CED or ED
and find the lines -

(set #insert2 "\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease Insert Disk 2")
(set #insert3 "\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease Insert Disk 3")

 Delete those lines, then find the lines (just after the complete
40 words ) -

(askdisk
 (prompt #insert2) 
 (dest "Blade2")
 (help @askdisk-help)
)

 Now delete those lines, then find the lines (just after the 
complete 80 words ) -

(askdisk
 (prompt #insert3) 
 (dest "Blade3")
 (help @askdisk-help)
)

 Delete them and then save the file.

 Go to Execute command on your WB in the first menu part and
type -

Assign Blade1: Ram:

 Go to Exectue command again and type -

Assign Blade2: Ram:

 Go back to Execute command again and type -

Assign Blade3: Ram:

 Now go to the installer in Ram: and run it, follow the instructions
and it should work fine, if not please get in touch and i'll sort
it out for you.

@{fg shine} How to use a BBS Part 2@{fg text}

Welcome to part 2 of the BBS Tutorial :)

This month, as mentioned before, I am going to cover "using BBs's"

When I wrote that, I thought "ah no probs :)", however writing it turned
out to be a bit more difficult, so I decided to show you how to get logged
into a new bbs etc, using my own as an example.

There are two types of BBS System, a menu based system, and a conference
based one..  My BBS is menu based, and that is what I'm gonna be talking
about here..

If you want to find out more, the contact details are at the bottom..


Ok, so you've dial up a bbs, and you should see something like below..
[-Ed Depending on what speed modem you have if you have a 14400 it'll
say CONNECT 14400/V42BIS or something similar]

CONNECT 33600/V42BIS

You will probably now get a screen asking you to press ESC twice, so do that..

--

1.  Enter your Handle: @{b}Luigi@{ub}

2.  Did you enter your name correctly? @{b}Y@{ub}

3.  Do you want ANSI Colour? @{b}Y@{ub}

4.  Do you want to use the full screen editor? @{b}Y@{ub}

5.  Do you want to receive junk mail (Msgs to "All")? @{b}N@{ub}

6.  Would you like to pause after each screen full? @{b}Y@{ub}

7.  How many lines per screen (28): @{b}28@{ub}

8.  Where are you calling from ? @{b}Muir-Of-Ord@{ub}

9.  Please type in your REAL phone number: @{b}01463 870022@{ub}

10. What kind of computer are you using: @{b}Amiga 12oo o3o@{ub}

11. Current protocol: ?!?!?!

    0 - No default
    1 - XModem
    2 - XModem CRC
    3 - XModem 1K
    4 - YModem (batch)
    5 - YModem-g
    6 - ZModem

    Enter the default protocol: @{b}6@{ub}

12. Enter your new password: @{b}Password@{ub}

13. Please enter again for verification: @{b}Password@{ub}

14. Did you enter all of the above correctly? @{b}Y@{ub}

--

PLEASE NOTE: This is just an example login, not all bbs's are going to be
             identical to this, however they may be quite similar.

Here is a full description of what each line is asking for:

1 =  The name/alias you wish to use on the BBS system, if it asks for a
     "Full Name", you should enter one.

2 =  This is here just in case you aren't a new user and you hve simply
     entered your name incorrectly, if you @{u}are@{uu} a new user however,
     you should say @{b}yes@{ub}.

3 =  ANSI colour should be set to @{b}Yes@{ub}, it means that you will be
     able to get coloured text, as explained last month.

4 =  The answer to this is @{b}yes@{ub}, it means that when you are writing
     a message on the bbs, you will have the whole screen to write it, and
     you won't have to enter one line at a time, you will be able to use
     the cursor keys to move back up and make alterations.

5 =  If you say @{b}No@{ub} to this, you will only recieve messages addressed
     to you, otherwise you may end up getting hundreds of messages from
     mail nets.

6 =  The answer to this should be @{b}Yes@{ub}, it means that if there is
     more than one screen full of text, it will pause and wait for you to
     press a key, giving you the chance to read it all.

7 =  The amount of lines available on your screen, you should really
     select 28, because this is the length that most sysops will have drawn
     the screens (unless of course you have a small monitor).  Some bbs's
     may even put numbers up the side of the screen and you are asked
     to select the topmost one.

8 =  Where you are from, you're village/town.

9 =  This is your phone number, you @{b}should@{ub} enter the proper one/

10 = This is the kind of computer you are using, it dosen't affect the
     operation of the bbs, except if you typed "A crap one" the sysop
     might think you're a bit wierd ;)

11 = The transfer protocol you wish to use (which we covered in the last
     tutorial), this is recommended as Zmodem.

12 = The password which you wish to use, you can then save this in your
     phone book.

13 = Type the same password again just to make sure that you typed it
     correctly.

14 = Verification that you entered all your details correctly, if not,
     you will have to answer all the questions again, or select a question to
     answer again.

After this you will probably be presented with a welcome screen, and then
probably things like a wall (which allows users to make comments, which
will then be seen by the next user, who can add another line if he wishes).

Eventually, you will arive at the main menu, from which you will probably
have options like:

 (F)ile Base      (P)age menu
 (M)essage menu   (L)ogoff
 (O)nline Ganes

This is a hotkey type system, you just press the key and it will go to the
appropriate menu.

Or perhaps

 FILE - Files menu     PAGE - Page menu
 MESS - Messages menu  BYE - Logoff
 GAME - Online Games

With this system, you type the string e.g "FILE", and then press enter,
it will @{u}then@{uu} go to the appropriate menu

--

Now that you are logged into the bbs, and know how to use the menus etc..
Why not give the sysop a page, or go and have a look at the files or
messages ?

You should have the hang of it now :)

Again, if you have any questions etc,

E-mail me at @{b}luigi@backwoods.prestel.co.uk@{ub}, or call the Backwoods BBS

@{fg shine} HOT TOPIC for next month@{fg text}

 We've decided to do the idea of HOT TOPIC like how a certain other
TV/Teletext computer mag does, but will remane nameless due to them
being Amiga unfriendly.

 We want you to get you comments in about 'WHAT YOU THINK GATEWAY
2000 NEED TO DO TO GET THE AMIGA BACK ON TOP' Send all your letters
with ideas and comments to :-

@{fg shine} Sponser AIO@{fg text}

 As you know AIO is free of charge and as you may expect it takes alot
of our own time to prepare AIO each month and the time and money we
use is not regained. We will continue to offer AIO free of charge but
we are looking for a company or person to sponser us to give us some
regain of what we lose while making AIO.

 We don't want to ask much but if you would like your companys address
put in EVERY issue of AIO and a special section for your companys
adverts, latest product releases and anything else you want you can't
go wrong but to sponser us.

 For more details get in touch with Chris Seward via the email address
below :-

@node "Web" "AIO gets online"

@{fg shine} Web page for AIO@{fg text}

 If you've all been waiting for it it's finnally here, AIO goes online,
we have had a Web Page setup, so go and browse it, ATM it's just
temporary with a text file and every issue of AIO to download, in the
next couple of weeks or the next month it'll be the best Web site
you've ever seen!

 I would like to thank Lewis Mackenzie for the 'donation' of the
Web space.

 Soon we'll be having another web site for AIO thanks to Digital
Candy BBS so look out for that.

 The address for the AIO web page is :-

            @{b}Http://www.prestel.homeusers.co.uk/backwoods/aio.html@{ub}

 If you have any ideas for the AIO web page get in contact with us
and i'll see what i can sort out.
