Recently one individual has hacked the Amiga.com site, one who has
boasted quite proudly about hisa abilities, possible future attempts, 
and his dissenting opinion or prefernce on certain things Amiga.

Folks, opinions are like bodyhair; everyone has it but that doesn't mean 
you have to show some of it off.  If there is one product you like over 
another then show your opinion by eithere buybg that product or posting 
an opinion on one of the many available news channels.  Something 
destructive such as hacking a popular site will only infuriate everyone 
against you which in turn will no doubt make the hacker even angrier.
It's a cycle that never works.  What's more, it segments a commujnity
already far too small with the possible threat that maybe
{bold}nobody{nobold} will get what they want.

So you can crack into a site.  Big deal.  Now try something
{italic}productive{noitalic}.  You think you can hack and crack, then 
put your programming skills to use by developing software for the Amiga 
that will help protect people against such infiltrations.  People will 
like you better and maybe you might get a little money off of it.  In 
this same vein I put virus makers as well; you guys are just wasting
everyone's time as well as your own effort.

I guess what I'm trying to say to all this miscreants is... Get a life.
