Okay, so we're all impatient for the new Amiga productsa, but September
11 set {italic}everyone{noitalic} back.  So if you want to blame
anybody, you can always try everyone's favorite mideastern punching bag.

The fact of tErrorism never being an answer perhaps needs to be stated
here as well, because site-hacking is a form of terrorism.  Hate begets
hate, so if you're displeased about the way the Amiga powers that be are
doing something then tell them; if you have a prefErence of one product
over another then say it with your spewnt money.  But never resort to
web-hate.

We still need a new Utils editor, so if you think you can pen at least
three reviws a month, then send us a call...  Please?
{pp}
Also, we actually have stuff in the Letters section this month (and a
LOT of it), so go check it out.

And finally, here's my comment about the holiday season (for whichever
version you celebrate).  I haven't been a real holiday fan for a while,
and here's one reason why.  Is the world so bad off that we need one
particular day just to be nice to one another and who cares what happens
the rest of the year?  You don't need Xmas, Kwanza, or whatever as an
official excuse, just act like kind civilized people every day of your
lives.  If you need that one day a year just to be nice then you're
missing the whole point.  Don't take one day off from your day to day
drudgery to treat people like people, live it all the time.

With that in mind, Merry Halloween and a Happy Potato Day.
