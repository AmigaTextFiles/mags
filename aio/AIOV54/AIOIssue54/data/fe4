Hi all,
{pp}
As one of the people having a stand at the WOAse show I
thought it would be nice if I posted a personal report for
everyone who couldn't attend the show to read (and for
those that could!! :)
{pp}
I was part of the Mediator Support Group along with my good
friends Sam Thomas (Stom) and Nick Darley-Jones (GAG).  Stom
is the main player and runs the Mediator Support Website at
{italic}http://www.amiga-mediator.co.uk/{noitalic} while GAG has a nicely
impressive set-up and runs the Glochester Amiga Group whos
site is at {italic}http://www.glosamigagroup.co.uk/{noitalic}.  Myself, I
was {italic}hoping{noitalic}  to have the 4000 Mediator Logic to go into my
4k bigbox but alas that was not to be.  Elbox had promised
me it would be in my machine by the end of
September/beginning of October but at mid-November there's
still no sign of it.  I was still pleasantly surprised at
how much attention my machine got though.  Lots of people
were interested in my (Rather big!) Zorro cards and the
Mediator 4k Daughterboard that was all ready to hold all
those lovely PCI cards (Voodoo was already in it)
{pp}
Elbox was also supposed to attend WoaSE themselves but for
reasons of their own they decided not to show up, more fool
them!  Everyone who came over to talk to us said that if
they had been there with Mediators to sell they would have
made a killing as I have had at least a dozen people say
they would have bought mediators/MMcds etc.  Ah well, their
loss!
{pp}
But enough about our stand! :)  You want to hear about the
rest of the show!
{pp}
Once again Eyetech still did not have a working A1 board,
but in all fairness they did say that things were running
being schedule.  They had the board, looking fairly
complete, on their stand along with the version that was
displayed at alt-woa in February.  The Feb board had only
two pci slots, no ram slots and several other chips missing
whereas this new version had all of its pci and ram slots
and (to my untrained eyes) looked pretty much complete so
its a real shame that they didn't have a working version to
show.  They did, however, have their usual big range of
stock to sell and afaik a hell of a lot of it went before
the end of the show!!
{pp}
Most of the other stands also did a rip-roaring trade but
the one that caught my eye was a chappie (source unknown!)
showing some VCDs of the first four episodes of the new
Star Trek series:   Enterprise.   He certainly had a flock
of people around that monitor all day!!!
{pp}
Several laptops were in attendance showing various Amiga DE
stuff and Fleecy showed me a few of the GUI's of Elate and
explained about how the little tiny icons could be
configured to do pretty much whatever you want - from
launching a program to being pure eye-candy by being
"pseudo-intelligent" and walking across the screen doing a
jig or somesuch!!! ;}
{pp}
This is pretty much the same sort of
thing that Windows XP is currently offering (sorry to
mention those words but I have to say this as I went to PC
World and saw XP running) - though XP is certainly stabler
and faster than previous incarnations its a nasty GUI - massive
icons and lots of moving GUI parts that REALLY needs a lot
of horse-power thrown at it!! - Basically a Child's Toy!!!).
{pp}
If Amiga can make this GUI totally configurable so that
it does the same sort of thing XP does, but so we can scale
the GUI, change it, and run it on something 1/50th the
power XP needs then I'll be somewhat happy and what Fleecy
showed me certainly looked as though it may do all this and
more.
{pp}
Mark Smith (of Kickstart) had leant his Amiga to Pagan Games
for the night and it was running Earth2140 at an
impressively fast speed!  They also had a handheld PDA
along running one of the (impossible to do) games for the
DE.  The game consists of loads of coloured balls that u
have to bounce around in a space-type gravity field and get
the correspondingly coloured balls into the corners.
Blooming impossible!!!! :-)
{pp}
Kicksoft, run by the infamous Ray Mccarthy pretty much
sold-out of stock the same as always and he almost sold me
Pagestream but atm I don't really need it (ok, ok, Ray - I
admit {bold}I{nobold} came to you asking about it!!!).
{pp}
SEAL had plenty of people very impressed with their
computers running a networked Heretic II - one fella
couldn't believe it was running as he "has a similar setup
and doesn't get anywhere Near that speed".  Go guys! :)
{pp}
The games area had a great time too, running Sensi Soccer
(which, naturally enough, I lost 8-0 in ;-) and taking up a
lot of peoples time watching various people thrash each
other!
{pp}
The fella from Amiga Forever put on a demo via his lap-top
and projection screen which had a group of Miggy users
practically drawling at the improvements in the latest
version.
{pp}
And the SEAL publication Clubbed had an official name change
to "Total Amiga" which has been officially endorsed by
Amiga and will soon be going bi-monthly!
{pp}
There were of course plenty of other groups/stands around
the show and most of the time you couldn't move very fast
because of the crowds but I just don't have the space to
write about them all (and I'm sure you've read my ranting
for long enough as it is!! :)
{pp}
To sum up then - and in my own personal opinion - this was a
fairly poor show Hard/software wise but for the atmosphere
and for meeting people this was a stonker of a show -
better in that respect than previous shows I have been to.
Going back to my thinking it was a bad turnout
hard/software wise - this is purely My opinion.  I took
neigh on £200 to spend and the most expensive thing I
bought was Payback at £30.  Plenty of people I know didn't
take Enough money so I know that most people were more than
satisfied on this front.
{pp}
It was lovely meeting everyone I speak to over the internet
and I hope to see you all at Son of Alt-Woa in February
(when I'll hopefully have a 4k Mediator Logic in the
machine to show everyone!!! :-)
