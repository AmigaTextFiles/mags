"We are thrilled to be able to open up ever more possibilities to users of Amiga
PCI busboards", says Ben Hermans, managing partner of Hyperion Entertainment.
"The Permedia 3 is around 6 times faster than the Permedia 2 and offers a lot
more functionality including full OpenGL compliance. The chipset is still
frequently used in high-end 3D workstations. The ATI Radeon family is undeniably
state of the art with well-rounded 2D performance and top-notch 3D performance
that is on par with anything out there in the Wintel world. Support for the Radeon
family will allow Amiga users to enjoy unrivalled performance and functionality."
More details will be disclosed in the upcoming weeks.
