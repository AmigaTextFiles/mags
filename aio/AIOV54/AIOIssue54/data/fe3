Its been quite a while since i've really had anything to say but the
recent situation with the AmigActive magazine has quite annoyed me.
{pp}
When CUAmiga closed, AmigActive was seen as something to save the Amiga
name on the shelves of the shops in the UK and Worldwide. It gave us
all something physical to buy and read. Even though the magazine was
thin and the price of it was ridiculous alot of us bought it to support
it and because everyone likes to read a paper based magazine.
{pp}
The part in which the actual "con" comes into play is the fact that they
have "re-named" the magazine and have a new direction. The basic fact of
the matter is that they have not re-named the magazine. The truth is,
{pp}
AmigActive has CLOSED.
{pp}
A new magazine called Digital has OPENED.
{pp}
I think the company who made AmigActive are playing on our goodwill
expecting us to go out and buy Digital magazine just because it used to
bring us AmigActive. This just wont wash and I for one wont be purchasing
it.
{pp}
The way it was put to the readers was that the name was changing and
that the content was, well in my eyes this means the magazine has closed
and now I want nothing to do with their new magazine because infact
that is what it is, a new magazine.
{pp}
I, like most, have every interest in the latest technology and developments
but will not be duped into buying a magazine just because I used to read
their previous publication (AmigActive). The same situation would be if
AIO changed to a PC magazine but tried to take all our readers with us
to read the new magazine.
{pp}
I think PinPoint Publishing have a cheek personally.
{pp}
I read with amusement that Amiga.org had a news story about the Digital
magazine website being launched. Why is this news on an amiga related
news site. I know that Amiga.org carries wider news but this is what the
publishers of AmigActive obviously wanted. Although our market is small
it still has enough people to give the sales of the first copy of Digital
a boost.
{pp}
If all the people who bought AmigActive bought the first copy of Digital
then they would be laughing all the way to the bank adding all the new
readers. The slight chance that the new magazine may carry some Amiga
news does not really tempt me to go out and buy it.
{pp}
The moral of this article is not that you should avoid reading Digital
but don't be conned into buying it just because they used to make AmigActive.
I think it is very sly of the publishers to word the closure of AmigActive
in such a way that it looks like it has never closed but just reborn with a
new name and new content.
