Tired of Christmas stuff?  Well good, 'cause there's nary a fat drunk
with reindeer hypd up on drugs in the bunch.  Just some random
craziness to entertain you.  So, without further ado...

{italic}http://www.skyscraper.org/{noitalic}{p}
Pop quiz hre.  What's the fifth tallest building in th world?  Don't
know?  Well, here's the place to go and look it up.  And did you know
that there were categories of skyscrapers?  Well, check out this site
to find what the heck a Jumbo or Super-Jumbo is.

Apparently there'sa a museum for {italic}anything{noitalic} nowadays. 
Aside from the pics of pics, there's enough information on their make
and colors to have you wondering what this guy does for his Day Job. 
Well, his wasted time is our amusement.  Check it out.

{bold}The Ephemera Society Of America{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.ephemerasociety.org/{noitalic}{p}
Okay, to understand this site you have to understand what the heck
they mean by Ephemera.  Bypassing their own definition, I'll put it a
it more tersely and just call it Paper-Stuff.  Anything put to a paper
product that's writtenb, typed, or drawn and of no real importance. 
That said, there's everything from the origin of crossword puzzles here
to how pictures of dolls have been usd in printed advertisements over
the years. A rather ecclectic variety for such a special-interest subject.

The site of a commerical company, but one that's currently perfecting
their skills at designing and testing private and commerical-use
airplanes with {bold}rocket{nobold} engines.  Yes,  actual rocket
engines stuck onto an airplane in place of those old turbines.
Interesting info for the science and technology minded.

Okay, this should keep you occult fans busy for a while.  It proclaims 
itself to be the most popular divination site on the Net, and with 
tarot, I-Choing, Runes, Biorythms, anbd som other stuff I'll have to 
look up in a dictionary, it looks like they just might be right.{p}
Eight diferent tarrot decks to consult with, readings available online. 
And while the viability of programming such an intuitive art into a web page
script is another matter, it still is sorta fun and the pictures look 
good.  Alternately you can check out the Runes page, and pick which of the
several dierent styles of runes to use for your query, or if like me and 
it's news that there ARE different types of runes, you can see what the 
differnce is.  The I-Ching then is trhe oriental version o divination 
involving throwing sticks and looking things up in a book; a bit more un 
when done oin person, but you can still timnker around with this on-line 
version.{p}
Biorhythms are common enough, but ever heard of Bibliomancy or 
Stichomancy?  Unusual and more rare then the others perhaps, but not as 
strange as their Yes Or No section, in which a divinatory oil-filled pen 
is tilted for your answer.  Naturally to round things out and earn a
buck, there's the expected online store in case you want to try the
cards and runes out in person.{p}
Now if I can just get this Tarot page to tell me something besides
misery and saddness for the rest of my days.
