Happy Holidays!
{pp}
I know that it has been months since you have read something official from 
the Amiga team. This is not because of lack of activity; in fact, far from it.
Whether it is raising money in the US, joint development with partners in the
Far East, or developing Ami2D in Sweden and New Zealand, Amiga is truly a global,
24 hours a day company.
{pp}
First, we would like tno say thanks to every one of you for your continued
support. It has been a challenging year and Amiga continues to fight battles
in this depressed technology market. However, even in these tough times, the
true spirit of Amiga and the community has come shining through. We are very
happy with our partners and are looking forward to a great future together in
the year ahead.
{pp}
There has been confusion regarding the future of Amiga with some members of 
the community spreading rumors and even going to the extent of hacking web sites
to post false information. Remember, if you do not read it on the official Amiga website
or on the developer website,
consider it rumor, and regard it with appropriate suspicion. If you have any
concerns, contact the team or me directly and let us address any issues that
you might have. We will answer. It might not be what you want to hear, but we
will address your concerns.
{pp}
Amiga is here to win! We will win big by attacking segments of the
market where there is a clear opportunity for us to have a significant impact
and achieve defendable business. The opportunity for Amiga is stronger than
ever. With our two-pronged strategy of AmigaDE as the universal content system
and the AmigaOS as our desktop, workstation and server, we can offer a complete
solution for the home, the office, the school or wherever digital computing
needs exist.
{pp}
The Amiga team and I are in this for the long haul because we know that Amiga 
can succeed. All of our marketing contacts, our business contacts and, our developer
contacts, are telling us that this is the time for Amiga. We have seen potential
partners, content producers, and even companies in our own business park disappear,
but Amiga is still in business. As the US economy begins to recover, we are
leaner and stronger than we have ever been.
{pp}
One of the strengths of Amiga is that the Amiga team really extends far out 
into the world through the users, developers, and dealers. Success for Amiga
is success for all of you as well. For too long, the Amiga community has not
had anything to be proud of. However, with the launch of our first AmigaDE based
products, it is time for the whole Amiga team to work together again. At the
end of this update, I am going to ask for some help from everyone because only
by working together can Amiga move forwards.
{pp}
For those of you hungry for specific news, here are some updates:
{pp}
{pp}
{bold}Amiga Digital Environment{nobold}
{pp}
{pp}
The Amiga DE™ Player1.0 for both Windows and Linux is now ready and shipping! 
We have a new website for AmigaDE,
which will in the not-so-far future become a user focal point for everything
AmigaDE and we encourage you to visit, participate, and spread the word.
{pp}
The AmigaDE™ Player is the first step towards our vision of the Digital Habitat™, 
being the launch product for the AmigaDE (Digital Environment), a set of technologies
that brings users and their content together regardless of the digital device
they choose to use. The AmigaDE™ has been targeted directly at the user who
wants to be able to experience content on any of their digital devices without
having to worry about which of those devices work with that content. Whether
the content is an application, a game, music, video, email, or whatever, with
the AmigaDE ™ Player the answer is that they all do.
{pp}
In the coming weeks, many more applications will be released. Third party developers 
are currently working on products that will scale up to and expect desktop capabilities.
Bittersweet, Edivision, e.p.i.c. interactive entertainment,
Kaliko, Matay, Pagan Games, Ruksun Software, Technomages,
Titan Computer, VecTrace, Zeoneo, plus some companies yet
to be announced, as well as many individuals, are all working hard to take advantage
of the DE opportunity.
{pp}
We are looking forward to seeing more people join the ranks of the more than 
3000 developers already developing for Amiga. Amiga and our partners will be
issuing press releases over the next few weeks as the momentum builds, introducing
these new and existing companies. For more information, see the developer website.
{pp}
What does this really mean? Many of you ask the really important question "When 
can I buy one of these new AmigaDE enabled devices?" I can tell you that Sharp
will soon be shipping their device. Tao Group and Sharp have selected Amiga
to provide all developer support for intent on the Sharp SL5000D. For more
information on how Sharp, Tao and Amiga are working together see the intent-sharp website.
{pp}
I have also just signed a contract with one of the largest Set Top Box companies
in the world. Unfortunately, I will not be able to give out the name until the
second week of January, but you will be pleased.
{pp}
AmigaDE is now running on numerous other devices, and many of these vendors 
are working with us on making these products a reality in the first quarter
of 2002. Here are some sample MPEG videos of just a few of the products with AmigaDE
running on them. Click on a screenshot to download/view the MPEG video.
{pp}
{pp}
{bold}AmigaDE SDK 1.1{nobold}
{pp}
{pp}
With the AmigaDE moving forward and the AmigaDE Players released, we can now 
concentrate on moving all of the developed technology into the new SDK. Many
of these technologies are already in beta and being tested by members of the
Amiga Developer Network.
{pp}
For instance, our new Ami2D services have been available to a select few for 
two months now. In fact, Pulsar Interactive's new AmigaDE game, Gobbler, was
written using this technology. Ami2D is a very exciting development, and I believe
that it will give DE developers a definite advantage over what other products
can offer.
{pp}
Even more exciting, working closely in conjunction with our partners at Hyperion, 
Ami3D is advancing towards the release stage. I have seen screen shots of the
new Ami3D in action, and have stared at screens throwing solids around and bouncing
off walls. This is great news because with the portability of DE application
and the new 2D and 3D services, AmigaDE developers will be able to demonstrate
their creativity.
{pp}
There is great excitement here concerning some of our new scaling technologies 
that are going to provide Amiga applications with even more flexibility and
more capabilities than ever before.
{pp}
I know many of you have read about the progress of SHEEP, our next generation 
programming language. Yes, it is a scripting language but it is also far more
than that, and can be used to do anything, from writing small scripts and macros
all the way up to creating full fledged applications. It will be a great addition
not just to the DE, but also to application development in general and we are
very proud of it.
{pp}
Add to this a new look interface, intelligent icons, new development environments, 
an amazing descriptive interface service called Prism™ and a boatload of other
stuff, and the new SDK will provide developers with a real taste of the future.
{pp}
While contract negotiations are always under Non Disclosure Agreements, I can 
say that with the OEM's that we are working with, and the soon to be released
devices that will utilize DE technology and content, then it could well be a
merry AmigaDE Christmas.
{pp}
{pp}
{bold}Amiga Desktop Progress and a new Surprise{nobold}
{pp}
{pp}
{bold}AmigaOS{nobold}
{pp}
The AmigaOS is a crucial part of our future. I have emphasized
this sentence because I want the Amiga community to repeatedly read it and burn
it into their hearts and minds. We will passionately and vigorously develop
AmigaOS into a world-beating product. Moreover, we passionately and vigorously
will defend it against anyone who would try to damage, demean, or seek to take
illegal advantage of AmigaOS for their own ends.
{pp}
I want to apologize for announcing in St Louis that new AmigaOS products would 
be available on November 1. I did this with the best intentions but many factors
have contributed to this slipping, some bad, such as the financial squeeze,
compounded by the September 11 atrocity, some unexpected, such as the announcement
of the G5, and some good, such as the advances in the next generation development
that have made us rethink our transition.
{pp}
The transition between the AmigaOne and the succeeding generation of the platform 
requires careful management. We have studied transitions on other platforms
to ensure that we try to do what others did right and not do what others did
wrong. The transition requires in depth knowledge of AmigaOS3.x software and
the classic Amiga hardware and we are relying heavily on our partners, as you
will see below.
{pp}
Another team is developing the next generation Amiga entirely and its design 
and information is being kept a secret. This is to keep down the rumors and
keep the teams focused on getting AmigaOS 4.0, AmigaOne, and AmigaDE to either
their first ship or next release.
{pp}
Hyperion, Eyetech and the other teams in this partnership are very busy and 
there is a great deal for all of us to do. Believe me there is no better-dedicated
team in the world on getting it all done. With this said and in order to alleviate
the long periods of silence that may result because of this, the executive updates
will start to appear once a month, so that we can share what we can with you.
{pp}
However, in order to let you know that this is not just noise, Amiga has engaged 
a partner company from the outside that brings us incredible depth, and has
a long history of creating the best of the best in designs. The company is Design
Genetix, and the team has already proved to us to be a great fit for our next
generation designs in hardware, and will assist us with third party manufacturing.
{pp}
Design Genetix has garnered over 400 product awards, while launching hundreds 
of portable, desktop and server products. They have experience in growing product
lines from $2.4 billion to over $17 billion over five years.
{pp}
{bold}AmigaOne{nobold}
{pp}
Eyetech and their team are making excellent progress with the AmigaOne board. 
We have seen the work that is being accomplished on the case design for an AmigaOne
and an A1200. This project is entering its final stages, and we are delighted
to be a participant. Yes it has been a long wait for the next generation of
Amiga capable hardware but be in no doubt that the AmigaOne is very real, will
be a product that you can buy, and on which Amiga will grow into something of
which we can all be proud. For AmigaOne information, see Eyetech's website.
{pp}
{bold}AmigaOS 4.0{nobold}
{pp}
AmigaOS4.0 will see the software environment moved onto the AmigaOne where 
it will be enhanced to take full advantage of the new hardware capabilities.
AmigaOS4.0 will offer exceptional performance increases, due to removing a large
number of the physical dependencies on the A1200/A4000, increased stability,
due to a 'from scratch' hardware design and great new features that will allow
developers to leap forwards in terms of offered applications.
{pp}
To allow Amiga Inc to concentrate on the next generation AmigaDE, and because 
of the tight integration of AmigaOS 4.0 with the Eyetech AmigaOne product, we
have outsourced the project management of AmigaOS4.0 to Hyperion Entertainment,
one of the most respected software development companies in the Amiga community.
For OS 4.0 information, see Hyperion's website.
{pp}
They will work closely with Eyetech, Haage and Partner and all our AmigaOS 
partners in the project, ensuring that the AmigaOne and AmigaOS4.0 combination
reaches the market in a timely manner and as a quality product. For Haage-Partner
information, see the Haage & Partner website.
{pp}
{pp}
{bold}Conclusion{nobold}
{pp}
{pp}
Newcomers to the software industry are often unaware of the impact that Amiga 
had on the computing industry. But with the launch of the DE Player, and seeing
all the new content, as well as the AmigaOne and OS4.0, this is starting to
change. We are working hard to accelerate this process and each of you can play
your part in ensuring that your computer and your community are successful.
{pp}
I say this to you because I need your help. I need all of you to remember those 
who used to come to the meetings. I need you to remember those in your office,
or neighborhood who run Windows or Linux. I need you to look in your local papers
and see who writes the business sections, and who writes the technology sections,
and I need you to tell them about AmigaDE.
{pp}
I need you to tell them about a technology that allows the same content to 
run without change on various devices. I need you to tell them about how they
can use Linux or Windows, and run Amiga content on either machine. I need you
to remind them that most of the current content is for PDA's and to ask them
to compare what they have seen on PDA's and other handheld gaming systems to
what the Amiga community has been building. In addition, I need you to support
the developers who are creating content for Amiga in every way possible.
{pp}
I know there are thousands in the Amiga community who want to help. I get email 
messages daily asking how you all can help. Well the AmigaDE Player is a big
step for us, and for the many developers who have created content for it. Thousands
more are working on new content! For those who have the DE Player buy a game,
and then give us feedback. This is the first step in our journey forward, and
our first step together towards that future.
{pp}
There are many amazing things happening at Amiga, and over the next six months, 
all our hard work will slowly start to emerge into the world. I want you to
know so much, but for many reasons, I simply cannot tell you the bulk of what
is going on. Just be assured that my team and I are putting our lives and our
souls into Amiga and that your patience and loyalty will be rewarded.
{pp}
For now, I need your help in spreading the good news about the AmigaDE Player. 
Its simplicity makes it ideal for senior citizens, parents, and children, people
who have a computer, enjoy games but who are terrified of the technology. Its
portability makes it perfect for developers who want to reach as many markets
or as wide an audience as possible.
{pp}
Go to Amiga's website, purchase some 
of the games, and then tell everyone you know how Amiga is binary portable;
scalable, and able to provide the same content on numerous different devices
and products, there is no one else that can show a product like this anywhere.
Be Proud and show it off.
{pp}
I promise you that it will not be another 6 months before you hear from me 
again, but it was only because there are only 24 hours in a day and we have
been putting in 36 hours a day making it all happen.
{pp}
Merry Christmas, God Bless, and bring on 2002!
