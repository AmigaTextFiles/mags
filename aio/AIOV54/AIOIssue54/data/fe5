Peter:  1. Can you tell me about Zeoneo and what they do?{p}
Zeneo:  Zeoneo is a new lightweight company, founded in January 2001. The company
was formed to develop software exclusively for AmigaOS and AmigaDE.
Initially this means just games, particularly PDA games, though we also
have serious apps in mind.

Peter:  2. What has attracted Zeoneo to Amiga and the AmigaDE OS?{p}
Zeneo:  Personally, I've always been a huge fan of the Amiga OS and I have owned
numerous machines in the past. Today, I still have several Amigas, one of
which is used daily. Other members of the team are also past owners of
Amigas. However, starting a Amiga related company simply because you're
fond of the platform doesn't really make good business sense. Fortunetly,
the growing AmigaDE system has massive market potential.

Peter:  3. Is there any particular market you are aiming for? PDA, Desktop?{p}
Zeneo:  We are aiming for the PDA markets at the moment, simply because it allows
the most progress. AmigaDE desktop games will become more viable once
hardware accelerated graphics solutions become available. Beyond that, we
aim to develop for all platforms and devices, as they become supported by
AmigaDE.

Peter:   4. Can you tell us about Planet Zed? The idea for the game, what
 development tools you used and so on?{p}
Zeneo:  Planet Zed is a vertical scroll shoot 'em up game that borrows many of its
features from the classic Bitmap Brothers Xenon-II Megablast. You fly a
spacecraft through a range of different types of scenery. Most of the
levels require you to navigate your ship carefully around the rocks and
other structures, while avoiding the aliens and their shots. Sometimes the
room for manoeuvre is quite tight. There is a whole range of weapons to
use, which can collected within the game, or bought in the between levels
shop.{p}
The game was originally started as an exercise in producing as smooth a
scroll as possible, on as wide a range of platforms as possible. (Different
CPU speeds, etc.) The game was developed using the standard AmigaDE SDK.

Peter:   5. What are you currently working on now?{p}
Zeneo:  Our policy is to not describe future projects until they are released. This
avoids disappointments, since production delays are inevitable, and allows
us to concentrate on our work. Suffice to say, we are currently working on
future Zeoneo titles. :)

Peter:  6. What other software are you planning to develop in the future?{p}
Zeneo:  The great thing about the PDA market at the moment is that there is still
much that hasn't been done before. Translating desktop ideas to the smaller
screen will keep us occupied for quite some time. But significantly, as
more of Amiga's plans for DE become implemented, there opens up a whole new
way of working with computers. We've seen some of what Amiga are working
on, and it's very exciting indeed. The Amiga future looks very bright! :)

Peter: Thanks

Zeneo:  No problem. :)
