i wanna wish long live to the Amiga and to her :) fathers :)
i hope, that in new 2002 year new Amiga was born not as a project
board - as a new, powerful machine, which surpass stupid pc in all!!!!
now Ammy havent enough processor power, and i hope, that Pegasos (or
any other clone) will have enough power, than handful of sand, named
Pentium.
{p}
i wish to all software/hardware developers didnt drop Amiga projects in
trash and support Ammy so long, as they can!!!!!!!
{p}
i never throw away my Ammy - i love her :)

May all your binary bits fall into place during the coming Festive
Season(s) and may the World finally get a taste of Peace and Harmony
in the coming year. And may all the "nasties" find open Windows and
leave our Amigas alone! :)
