Blitz Basic 2 has been updated and is now released under GPL. It's now called AmiBlitz2
and includes new features such as optimisations, faster compiler, PPC and FPU
assembly and many bugfixes.

A full distribution will be worked out soon, but for now you will need to get AmiBlitz2
and use some files from a previous Blitz installation.
