{subhead}Retro Review: Popeye{def}{p}
Review by Vincenzo Morra

The old good times!{p}
I am old enough to remember playing Pong and Space Invaders at my
local arcade. At that time graphics and sound were not a priority for
game developers due to the limited technology and resources
available. Game creators focused all their attention on playability
and the main purpose of games was not to finish them, but to
accumulate as many points as possible. Even today, in the world of
Playstation2 and X-Box we have developers that still believe in the
old concept of playing games to accumulate points and improve on the
previous score. REZ, on the PS2, is just one of those games.

Then the second generation of games came along and things improved.
Graphics and sound got better, home computer systems were born to
replace the old 'pong' console system and people began to enjoy games
at home. I remember at that time there was a particular game I use to
enjoy playing every time  I skipped school. It was a game that made
use of a famous cartoon character called Popeye. When the game came
out my friends and I were all pleased by the quality of the graphics
and sound. It really made us feel in control of the real cartoon
character. Later on a conversion of the game was available for the
old Commodore 64. It was a joy for the eyes, and although the
graphics were not as good as the one in the arcades, the playability
was all there.

A few years ago a group of Dutch developers, under the name of
Bignonia (also responsible for Amiga ports of Donkey Kong and
Zaxxon), decided to convert the C64 version of Popeye for the Amiga.
It was a good idea considering that there are (and always will be)
people who enjoy playing retro games on their powerful
console/computers. I have once again got hold of that version while
browsing the Back To Roots website, and I decided to have a look at
it.
{pp}
Unfortunately the game is only compatible with the old ecs system. I
had to disable my PPC card and load an old 1.3 kickstart to get the
game working on my system. Bignonia claimed to have two different
versions of the game: a C64 and a supposedly improved Amiga version.
After a quick loading I was greeted by a lovely intro which was the
equivalent of the cartoon intro you see on TV accompanied by the
famous and cheerful tune. On the next screen you will be given the
opportunity to choose between the Amiga and the C64 version by
pressing one of the function key. Having tried both versions I can
easily say there was no difference whatsoever between the two. They
are similar in terms of graphics and sound.
{pp}
In the game you control Popeye whose job is to conquer the beautiful
heart of Posh Spice, ahem... Olive.  The way you do that is by
collecting items that she throws at you from the top of the screen.
Obviously life is not easy, and the life time enemy (Brutus) is also
after the little lady making your task slightly difficult. While you
travel up and down the screen collecting hearts or notes Brutus and
his mama will chase you throwing bottles on your face (how rude!).
But never mind, you still have your old and trustworthy weapon at
your disposal: a can of spinach. This magic iron supplements is
available for you in every level. Grab it, eat it, punch him, and you
will see Brutus flying all over the screen .
{pp}
The game contains the three original levels plus an extra one created
by Bignonia. Unfortunately, the graphics are not identical to the
Arcade version and it is rather awful. Considering that this is a
port of the Commodore 64 version it is understandable. Nevertheless,
the Amiga version could have been easily improved considering the
graphic potential of our computer. The sound effects are very good
reproducing some of the original effects present in the cartoon.
{pp}
In terms of playability this game can be fun if you are a fan of the
old arcade version. Each level has a set amount of items to be
collected (hearts, notes or help words) and therefore the only way to
improve your score is to stay alive for as long as possible
completing as many levels as you can. The extra level is nothing
special and it is evident it was not developed by the original team.
Indeed, four level don't seem enough compared to today standards, yet
this is  a conversion of an old game developed for an old computer
system and as such it has its own fashion. Let's be honest, this is
not the kind of game that you will play every day. It is one of those
that you will keep in your collection and play whenever you feel in
need to go back to the good, old times.
