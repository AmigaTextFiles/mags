Every one by now will have had a chance to play Quake on Amiga. There
was a time when people believed that the game was too demanding to be
converted on to our system. Clickboom then took the challenge after
seeing an illegal demo running on Amiga. What came out was a
beautiful but very demanding game that demonstrated that there was
still life in the old miggy.

Not long time ago ID decided to release the source code of Quake to
give a chance to newbies to learn how to code games. Since then
several people have developed legal ppc versions for our Amiga.
Indeed, it is just a matter of browsing Aminet to see them available
for download.
{pp}
Back when Quake came out I played the whole game on my 68060. It
wasn't fast, but it was a great game and playability compensated for
the lack of speed. This time I have decided to give Quake another go
using one of those ppc engine available on internet. I have chosen
the version coded by Frank Wille, Steffen Haeuser and Massimiliano
Tretene because it is available in warpos, powerup and 68K version
and it includes the normal and gl engine. Warp 3D is needed in order
to use the gl version of the game running on Amiga. As a bonus there
is also Quakeworld (server and client) if you fancy to have a go at
the multiplayer version. Quake was too slow to be used online and
therefore ID developed a much faster version which was called indeed,
Quakeworld.
{pp}
The engine I have chosen for the purpose of this review is the warpos
(Quakewos.lha version 1.0) and I have run it in normal and gl mode.
As soon as the game is launched a useful GUI will allow you to modify
the major settings of the game (graphics, sound, ect.).
{pp}
The engine is pretty stable. I have run the game in a workbench
window (using the chunkyppc option and triple buffering), on a high
and low resolution screen of my BVision (using the cybergfx option)
without experiencing any trouble. If you are a punchinello user it is
advisable to remove it or disable the mouse in the settings to avoid
incompatibilities. Also, some wb emulations do not support triple
buffering, If you have any problem just remember to set this option
to single or double buffering. In the GUI it is possible to disable
the cd sound (if you don't want to have Quake cd in your cd rom
drive), choose the controller type (CD32, mouse or Playstation
joypad) or modify the network settings to play online. Some of the
internet option are not active and, at the moment, Quake will only
support TCP/IP networking.
{pp}
It is important to install the engines in the same directory where
you keep your original 'packs'. In my case it was my original
Clickboom installation and now I have different icons to run Quake on
different processor and screens.
{pp}
If you are one of those people that has lived in exile for the past
few years and don't have a clue on what Quake is then pay attention.
The first thing to take in consideration is that Quake is a 3D game.
Now, if you thought that Doom was in pure 3D think again. Quake uses
a real 3D environment with real 3D locations. Indeed you can move in
different directions, climb wall or jump off balconies and buildings.
The head of the character can be moved in any possible direction
(using the mouse), like you would do in real life. It is a bit like a
Virtual Reality experience without the helmet.  At the beginning of
the game you will find yourself in a room facing your first dilemma.
Will you choose the easy of hard level of difficulty? Choose the
former  and you will be wondering around admiring locations while you
kill a monster or two. Go for the latter and you will hardly have
time to breath. The purpose of the games is to go from one level to
another until you reach the boss of the bosses, a terrible monster
with huge tentacles and big scary teeth waiting for you in a little
island surrounded by lava.  During your quest you will meet horrible,
scary looking monsters who can't wait to break you into pieces. The
Grunt, the Knights, the Zombies are only some of the horrible
creatures you have to face in your quest. Most of the monsters hide
themselves until you become visible and then will surprisingly attack
you. So you have been warned, be careful before you turn a corner or
enter a new room. In each level there are few secret locations and if
you find them you will be compensated with a new weapon, health packs
or extra ammunition. At times you need to activate switches, or find
keys to open doors to new levels.

One of the good things about using a new engine for Quake is the
improvement in playability. The original 68K version was not very
fast but still managed to satisfy many gamers. The warpos version I
have tried is pretty fast if played at low resolution (I managed to
get around 28 fps at 320x256 on a PPC 603e @ 200mhz) or if played in
a workbench window. Things change though if you try to run it at
higher resolutions. Unfortunately the game slows down quite a lot
becoming unplayable for today standards. Things can improve if you
reduce the screen size or if you are the lucky owner of a PowerPC 604
processor. The game is quite old but the graphics are still very
attractive, expecially if you use  add ons like Malice or X-Men which
have much colorful and bright locations. The structures are well
designed and they will give you a sense of claustrophobia which is
just the onset of your deepest fears. The music and the sound effects
are a great contribution and make the game even more real.
{pp}
The question I am asking myself is "Is there still life left in
Quake?". Well, the answer has to be yes. Quake is one of those game
that you will always play. I played the original version when it came
out but I would not mind playing  it again using the power of a ppc
processor and a graphic card, as long as it is possible to play it at
high resolutions. Indeed, I still have not managed to play X-men
because it was way to slow on the 68K. My only hope is that Frank,
Steffen and Massimiliano will find some time to improve the engine
and make it even faster at higher resolutions. Also, I would not mind
to have more networking options available.

If you have a powerpc and a graphic card give it a go. You might be
pleasantly surprised, especially seeing what was considered a very
demanding game playing in a window on your workbench while you surf
the internet.
