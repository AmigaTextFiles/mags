From Urban D. Mueller <mueller@relog.ch>, AmiNet's operator.

"Because of continued file system troubles on the current main site,
wuarchive.wustl.edu, we're moving the main site to Germany. wuarchive
will be back as a mirror when the file system trouble is resolved.
The main site will very probably remain in Germany and we're trying
to set up a computer of our own as main site so we're no longer at
the mercy of system operators. The most reliable site during this
transition should be de.aminet.net with most other mirrors being
fully operational immediately or within days. I cannot predict for
how long wuarchive will be down. Sorry about the inconvenience,
really not under my control."
