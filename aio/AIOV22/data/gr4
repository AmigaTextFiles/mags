Super Bubble Remix or SBR as I will refer to it through-out the review
is a cutesy platform style puzzle game. The idea is to blow your bubble
out of the screen to complete the level. Ok, sounds easy? well its not
that simple. You control a goast with the mouse and pressing the left
and right buttons spins the goast a certain amount to a different angle,
then by pressing space he will blow the bubble along, the idea is to
turn the goast into the position you want and then hit space to blow the
bubble. If you come to an obsticle you have to quickly click the mouse
to turn your goast to the right angle and start blowing again. Once you
have passed the objects blocking your way you complete the level.

On each new level you encounter various new baddies and other objects to
stand in your way and hinder the playing of the game to stop you reaching
the edge of the screen, from spikes to blobs that bounce up and down trying
to hit the bubble thus poping it. The further you progress through the
game the harder the levels become and you find you have to stear the bubble
through a set maze of walls because one tiny scrape and the bubble is a
gonna.

The graphics and music in the game are excellent! The graphics remind me
alot of Super Frog which was released a while ago by Team 17. Bubbley
graphics on a bubble related game. The music is also brilliant and keeps
you entertained while you dodge your way to the screen edge. Considering
this is the teams first attempt at a game they ought to be congratulated
and this is such a super game, along side the graphics and music is they
great playablility and lastability. You are bound to be playing this game
for years to come and having hours of fun getting further and further
into levels. Overall a top game that everyone should take a look at.
