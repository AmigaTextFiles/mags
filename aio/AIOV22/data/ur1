Amiga Club International March/April 1999 disk magazine is not technically
a utility but what the heck, i'm reviewing it here as it didn't seem
to fit anywhere else and this is probably the best place.
{p} {p}
The ACI March/April 99 disk mag is a magazine run by Roberta Smith
and Roy Byrne from the long running PD/Shareware library Roberta
Smith DTP (now I wonder how they got the name for that?! heh).
The mag is presented with the Disk Mag Creator program so it has that
feel to it that all other magazines have that have been created with
DMC.
{p} {p}
The magazine is packed with articles ranging from a 91 page cooking
guide and how to bake the various types of cookies from Aniseed Chrabeli
cookies to Black forest cheese cupcakes... yum! with articles about
GOD being a woman, Roberta Smiths own comments, a competition to
win X-Out, the results to intel outside 1998 (?!) and how to be a
t*sser on mailing lists. You can not really group what type of magazine
it is because it has something for everyone and is not just Amiga
related, some articles will be of use to you and others won't interest
you one bit... why would single men living on ready cooked meals
want to know how to bake cookies... well actually it maybe good for
some single men to learn how to cook those yummie treats.

The articles all differ in quality and are all written by a big mixed
bag of people. My main problem with the magazine is that on the main
menu where you select an article it only gives a one word title giving
very little indication to what the article is about. You will also find
the odd picture in the listing which would be nice if you where told
the type of data it is before loading it, ie. picture, text, etc.

Overall its a nice magazine. A few improvements wouldn't go a miss
but if your after a light read about a range of topics then it would
be worth taking a look at this. The pack comes with two disks, the
first being the ACI magazine and the second being the Disk of the
Month, which nicely enough is AIO issue 21&20 archived.
