Drawersize is a small utility to display the number of bytes a directory
takes. It adds an item to the Workbench "Tools" menu, and when you select it
the program will calculate the size of the drawer you have selected (and its
subdirectories, of course) and show it in the Workbench screen titlebar.

But that's just the problem. Workbench updates the screen title itself every
now and then, so the time you get to look at the drawer size is usually less
than three seconds. Luckily, if you haven't selected a drawer icon and you
pick the Drawer Size menu item, you'll see the previously displayed size
again, so you can keep selecting it until you remember the number :-)

It's peculiar that there aren't many tools out there for calculating directory
sizes, at least not many that I've stumbled upon... (okay, I haven't actually
been looking, either :-) So this program can be very handy, despite the fact
that it's written in Blitz Basic ;-) (full source included, by the way). The
only thing needed to install is to copy the program to the WBStartup drawer.
