Just a little something I found on BetterWeb.com. Another case of the
Amiga getting back into the consciousness of the mainstream public.
So hold on, there may yet be hope.

Amiga Comeback Led by Internet Intrinsics
{p} {p}
As the needs of an every more diversified technology consumer mount
in a connected marketplace, the underdog technologies are seeing
victory within their reach--at last.
{p} {p}
Long swept under the rug by Microsoft, these underdogs have remained
persistent, if not visible, supported by small, emphatic groups of
enthusiasts. One of the best examples is the Amiga OS, a commercial
operating system made popular in the late eighties by Commodore.
But when Commodore went out of business, the Amiga OS's troubles, and
those of its host system the Amiga Computer, began to mount.
{p} {p}
Five painful years after the Commodore liquidation, the Amiga OS
somehow emerged as the property of Gateway, the large PC OEM.
Strangely enough, however, Gateway hasn't made a big stew about this
technology. Though Amiga enthusiasts believe their system to be
superior to the best efforts from Redmond, Gatewayh as sat quietly on
the Amiga patents for a few years now while steeps of Amigans converge
on the Internet to support their habit.
{p} {p}
What is essentially an unsupported computer technology has been able
to survive, and some might say flourish, under conditions of nurturing
by its users--and the catalyst of the Amiga's survival has been the
Internet.
{p} {p}
If the Internet is good at doing one thing, that's allowing people to
communicate. The Amiga's eccentric operating characteristics and
elegant design would have been tossed into the bit-bucket years ago if
it weren't for the Internet. In fact, the Web is about the only place
Amiga users can find any kind of support for their beloved pet.
{p} {p}
While a dozen legitimate Amiga dealer storefronts and a single
(48-page) Amiga-only magazine may yet exist in North America, only the
Internet connects Amiga users with the urgency and blatancy that
they've come to require through a life of supportlessness. Try asking
CompUSA if their video capture parallel adapter will work on an Amiga.
CompUSA can't tell you, but the Web can.
{p} {p}
So, while Gateway and the farm gang in South Dakota may elude to their
keeping the Amiga platform alive, any seasoned Amiga user will be
quick to point out that the Amiga's presence, however miniscule, in
the marketplace, is exclusively because of the Internet.
{p} {p}
The popularity of any idea or practice can be prolonged using the
Internet. Take Linux, a young operating system whose blazing
popularity is mostly due to Web intrinsics. The Amiga is no different.
It serves as a shining example of the power of communications: a
doomed platform, preserved by a perfectly-suited communication tool.
{p} {p}
Now, imagine being able to harness that power. Interesting thought,
isn't it?
