Well, here's part 2 of what I think should be in the AmigaNG. This time
it's about daughter boards. Before I start, just remember though; if any
of you have some ideas of what the powers that be should put into the
next Ami, then just email them in and I'll put them in this column.  Who
knows, perhaps we'll give AI a few ideas.

Okay, so what should be spawned off into daughter boards?  I say just
about everything, graphics and sound.  Have the new Amigas come equiped
with their own default graphics and sound chips, each installed on their
respective small daughter boards.  Advantages?  Well, a few.
{p} {p}
First off, technology is moving so rapidly that the time between
installing the card at the factory and selling it at the stores could be
a whole generation of graphics technology. This is kind of hard to
update when your graphics are hardwired to your main board, but have it
on a daughter board?  Problem solved.  Just swap out the old card for
the new replacement sent out from AI.
{p} {p}
The other advantage is that if some third party Amiga developer came out
with their own graphics accelerator they could design it to just replace
the old Ami card, assuming of course it's designed with full backwards
compatibility. Seemless replacement.

Notice, though, that I said Daughter board and not expansion card.
These things should be made as their own daughter slots directly
attached to the motherboard and completely leave the expansion slots
alone.  This not only frees up the slots, but assuming a decently modern
motherboard, should be a bit faster than pumping through a Zorro slot.
Maybe even spawn it off the CPU card.
{p} {p}
These daughter boards should also have pass-throughs for further
daughter add-ons.  Not only for things like 3-D graphics or Mpeg off the
graphics, but for any future inovation that comes up unexpectedly (as
they usually tend to do), say some new innovation in sound for the audio
daughter board.
{p} {p}
Just in case, maybe have an empty daughter board expansion connector on
the motherboard- just to cover any future development that might do good
as a daughter board.  We may not know what exactly might come up in the
future in the way of technological innovations, but we can anticipate
the fact that there WILL be some future piece of new technology and
prepare accordingly.

Let's learn from the PC world and make our Amiga as future-shock proof
as possible.
