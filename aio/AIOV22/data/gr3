This one has been reviewed before. It`s an Amiga BlackGammon port with an
intellegent computer opponent.

In fact, the computer is too intellegent. I haven`t beaten it yet, but
because of it`s difficult, it makes me play more and more. The last game I
only had to more counters to get rid of, and the computer got double 5, and
beat me!!!!! Errgghh!

There isn`t much I can say. It`s Black Gammon. Nothing exciting, just
playable!
