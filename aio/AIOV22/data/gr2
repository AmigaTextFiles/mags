This is an interesting twist on Breakout. The idea is the same, but there
is gravity, which pulls the ball down, making it harder to hit the blocks.

I like the title screen music. I like it so much, that I think it would be
great as in-game music instead of the dodgey sound effects.

When you load you get a window on Workbench, stating that it is loading.
This used to take ages, before I downloaded the patch (aniodfix.lha) which
contains the missing file to make it speed up.

The graphics are simple, and contain some nice gradients. The bat could be
nicer, but now I`m being fussy.

The idea is great. Don`t get me wrong, this is a good adaption of the
original Breakout, but it would be nice to see a few more bonus' and less
bad bonus' which lose you a life. The only 2 bonus' I`ve seen are glue, and
enlarge bat. A skip to next level would be real handy!
