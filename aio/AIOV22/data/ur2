This is the last year of the millenium!! Year 2000 will come and crash all
the Windows machines every 20 minutes (which is 15% more often than now ;-)
and the aliens will come to evacuate us from a great disaster! And all that.

Oh well, maybe not but you can always hope or fear or whatever. Anyway, it's
going to be a big event (or so it seems now.. :-) so it's worth some waiting.
And to tell you the amount of days, hours, minutes and seconds until the
year 2000, here is Countdown 2000 in case you didn't guess already.

There are loads of millenium-counters around, but they're usually just small
windows or titlebars or something, well this one is a nice, animated
full-screen picture, especially suitable for a boot picture. It shows a view
of the millenium dome, and currently it's night and there are lots of twinkly
stars and some more activity (e.g. airplanes), and of course a big digital
counter showing the time left (and an even bigger "Counter2000" logo, which
isn't so nice :-). When we get closer to the year 2000, it'll turn into a
sunrise; first there are less stars, then the lights will go out on the
buildings and finally the sun will rise and you'll see a silly fireworks
behind a greeting to the 21st century :-) And of course the sky will become
brighter and brighter all the time.
{p} {p}
Despite all that, Countdown 2000 isn't so good-looking; it's a 320*256 PAL
picture (won't work on GFX cards) with a not-so-nice OCS-style copper slide
representing the sky. And there are only 32 (or so) colours, which is horrible
especially on that resolution :-) But, if you don't have a nice boot pic yet
and you want to see the amount of time until the next century on every boot,
then you should try this one out.
{p} {p}
The only downside is that you won't be there to see Countdown 2000's meagre
fireworks when the year changes (if you are, *shame* on you! ;-) and after
seeing the real fireworks you'll laugh at this one =) So check it out before
it's too late =)
