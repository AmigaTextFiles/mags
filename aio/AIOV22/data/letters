and asked you the readers what you thought, below are your letters.

Right now I'm not a CB lover. I've spoken to the "so called programmer"
quite alot, and his story is extremely convincing, and now that the rest of
the team has come out of the wood work it's become an even more solid
story. This did happen in the past though, people can change. That's what I
thought until I asked CB if they could give me another registration number
(yes I lost the one I won from AIO's competition...) so that I could use
their Portal web service which looks pretty nifty. After several mails they
still haven't replied.

Maybe people don't change...

Right,lets get started.
I haven't seen any confirmation that the "programmer cheated" is actually
real. We have seen the file hidden in the game CD but no "interviews" or
anything else by this unknown person.
{p} {p}
As has been stated on the newsgroups I have seen, ClickBoom probably went to
a foreign lower cost country because of the very tight margins on anything
Amiga. They _may_ not have acted ethically but probably acted as any other
Company would have.
{p} {p}
As far as future sales of their products go, I would have said that people will
buy from a company that provides for their particular needs regardless of the
Company's morals. MicroSoft is a case in point! However, this is the Amiga
Community we are talking about and I would find it strange if ClickBoom hasn't
already been deluged by mails asking about this story. Whether it will make a
difference to sales will be seen in the long term. ClickBoom, by porting, large
P.C. games to Amiga made quite an impact on the community and helped the
Amiga's image no end.
{p} {p}
I would imagine if I was a Games programmer and was going to sign for
ClickBoom, I would have an extremely good look at the contract and make sure
that every eventuality was covered.
{p} {p}
As it is, ClickBoom are one of the few Companies still developing for the
Amiga and with their new "Portal" show every sign of continuing. Of course, they
would like to make lots of dosh for their efforts but these days, with the
user base dwindling, stand less chance all the time until the eventual
reserrection of the M/C with the NG.
{p} {p}
In conclusion ,I would say that without any real proof, I will continue to
support ClickBoom until more evidence becomes available.
