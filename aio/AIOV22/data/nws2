SAN DIEGO, Calif. - February 26, 1999 - In a series of meetings in San
Diego, representatives of Amiga Inc. and Amiga International met to hammer
out the details of technical, strategic and marketing plans which will see
the launch of a range of new Amiga-based computers for the next millennium.
The company has relocated its headquarters to San Diego and Jim Collas will
be serving as the new president of Amiga.

"Amiga is an amazing opportunity that we must act on now or it will be lost
forever," said Collas. "The Amiga platform is ideal for Internet-ready,
consumer-oriented digital appliances of the future. The Amiga name is
associated the world over with user-friendly, low cost, powerful computing.
We will take this philosophy into the next generation, enabling products
from hand held Internet appliances to high-end graphics computers that help
the user rather than frustrate them."

Collas, formerly a senior vice president for Amiga's parent company,
Gateway, will be running Amiga as a wholly independent subsidiary operation
and will integrate Amiga Inc. and Amiga International under the new Amiga
corporate structure. His leadership will allow the company to step up a fast
- track development program that is currently underway.

Amiga is planning to launch next generation products worldwide before the
New Year. They will be announcing detailed product plans and introducing
several of their strategic partners over the summer. Products currently
targeted for the initial launch are a development system, an Internet
appliance, and a low cost home computer in the tradition of the Amiga A500
that dominated home computing in the late eighties and early nineties. The
developers system will be available with a software development suite for
low cost development on the new platform.

Jeff Schindler, in charge of product strategy for Amiga, is planning the new
Amiga product line. "The Amiga community has been doing incredible things on
a platform which hasn't had an official update in eight years," said
Schindler. "They deserve a system which lets them show off their talents."
{p} {p}
Amiga's administrative center in San Diego will shortly be complemented by a
software development center under the leadership of Dr. Allan Havemose, vice
president of Engineering for Amiga, in San Jose, California. The Silicon
Valley team will be rapidly expanded over the coming months to develop
revolutionary Amiga multimedia layers over the real-time Neutrino OS core
from QNX Software Systems Ltd.

Petro Tyschtschenko will continue on as managing director of Amiga
International and will also play a critical role in guiding the current
Amiga community through the transition to the new Amiga architecture. "The
new Amiga plans are a rebirth for Amiga and an exciting journey into the
future," said Tyschtschenko.
