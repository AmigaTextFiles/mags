SnipSubject is a small ARexx script for YAM 2.x, that removes text in square
brackets from the subjects of all mails in a folder. It's very useful for
silly mailing lists that add the name of the mailing list at the start of
the subject, e.g. "[amiprog] The actual subject".

Installation is easy, you just copy the script to YAM:ARexx and add the script
name to the settings. Then you select a folder and run the script, and it'll
ask you for the string to remove and then starts cleaning the subjects. It's
quite slow, though; about 1 second per message - that's easily a minute or two.
And it wouldn't be too difficult to make it notice the unwanted text by itself...
It would also be a lot more useful if it could automatically remove the
unwanted strings from new messages only and no matter what folder they're in..
But for now, you'll just have to settle for launching it manually :)
