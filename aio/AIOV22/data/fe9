February 8, 1999 - a historical day. This day reminded me of the
spirit of 1985, when Amiga was presented to the world public in
New York.
{p} {p}
This time a vision is born: Making computers a natural part of
everyday life.
{p} {p}
It is almost 2 years ago, since the take over by Gateway. Many people
know me as an impatient man and you may anticipate how difficult the
period from March 97 to February 8, 1999 was. A time of low
communication with the Amiga community, low public relations and low
information about visions, missions and goals.
{p} {p}
But my dear Amigans, I can reassure you the ray of hope will become a
bright sun within the next 6 month. The Amiga will be lead to the
future under the technical experienced management of an absolute
professional. Jim Collas, Senior Vice President Product Development &
Management of Gateway, Inc. has decided to modify his position and to
work for Amiga only. To reach all our goals, I will work on his side
and support him with all my energy.
{p} {p}
Our mission is:{p}
To create a revolutionary and compelling systems architecture and
operating environment for multimedia computers and digital information
appliances which can easily be imbedded into consumer computing
devices and enables innovative Internet services.
{p} {p}
Without talk big, I can tell you that in the middle of November 99 we
will launch the new Amiga systems architecture and operation
environment.
{p} {p}
For this purpose we will organize press conferences to inform the
public about our goals and directions. Besides the new and
revolutionary Amiga Operating System we are working on our existing
platform to present the upgrade 3.5 as soon as possible
First detailed information will be presented in St. Louis, USA (March
12. - 14.). We hope to be in the position to sell the first Operating
System upgrades 3.5 in summer 99. The German company Haage & Partner
and myself will take care about this project.
{p} {p}
AMIGA International, Inc. and Amiga, Inc. will conquer as one team the
computer world; under the management of Jim Collas - and you my dear
Amigans, will be a part of it.
{p} {p}
Help us performing our goals.
{p} {p}
Jim Collas will inform you within the next days about the
organization, plans and goals of our company.
{p} {p}
A very exciting time is coming and it is for me and my staff a honor
to be a part of a new computer generation as pioneer and to pave the
way for the future just like it was at Commodore.
{p} {p}
Long live our beloved Amiga and our community.
{p} {p}
Yours{p}
