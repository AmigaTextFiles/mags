Changes from 2.5a to 2.6:
{p} {p}
THOR:{p}
- New Save window added.{p}
- The main listview has complete support for proportional fonts now. There's
  a slight speed penalty involved with using proportional fonts due to some
  extra calculations required for the wrap code, but it shouldn't be too bad.{p}
- Fixed so that GETCURRENTSYSTEM from an ARexx enter/leave script will report
  the correct conference at all times.{p}
- SAVEMESSAGE from ARexx has several new arguments.{p}
- The conferences window now has a tree-view layout, with configurable folder
  setup etc.{p}
- Trippled the minimum stack size due to reports of a possible problem with
  the stack on advanced multipart messages.{p}
- You will now be allowed to Edit Data on a Forward Msg event and add a text
  comment, or remove the previous text comment.{p}
- Previous search results will now be cleared in all conferences and not just
  those that matches the current result.{p}
- The TAB key or the small gadget marked 'S' can now be used to  toggle
  selection of all enties in all requesters where multiple entries can be
  selected from a list (eg. To Name/Address when sending mail, joining groups,
  etc).{p}
- Added FilterThor to the external menu. FilterThor is a new MUI based tool
  to configure sortmail triggers.{p}
- Added conferences field in the attachment listview in the pack/purge
  window.{p}

+ many bug fixes and improvements
