To the moon is an old game brought back to life in this classic remake,
well not exactly a remake because it is basically the same as the original.
The idea of the game is to land your spaceship on a certain pad on the
moon with out bashing into it and having a soft landing. If you go to hard
then your spaceship will blow up and if you go to soft then you will never
land on the pad.

The first time I played this game was on the C64 in about 1988 and had
hours of fun with it. I remember my brother typing it in basic from a
programming book and being made up with the results. Unfortunally those
days are gone and this game just doesn't really cut it now. Ok the
graphics are ok but not out standing but honestly the game play isn't
worth wasting space over. The ship moves to slow and you get angry because
you can't get the god damn thing to land quick enough. Even when you go
full belt down to the pad and then jerk the joystick right up you still
manage to land safely.

Not a very good game and one that I wouldn't bother even downloading,
get it if your interested in this type of game only.
