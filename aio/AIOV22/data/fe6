Just a little interview I grabbed off of CUCUG; hear what the new guy in
charge of the Ami has to say...
{p} {p}
The following edited IRC transcript is from a session held at the
Henry VIII Hotel, in St. Louis Mo., site of the Amiga99 show. In it,
Jim Collas and Jeff Schindler of Amiga Inc. answer questions from
Amiga users gathered on the channel. The channel was sponsored by the
User Group Network.
{p} {p}
(HammerD) 1) what will the first product be?
{p} {p}

multimedia computer

(HammerD) 2) What will be the price point of the multimedia computer?

(besides QNX) ? Any details?

expertise.  At this point no company has said no

(HammerD) 4) Can you reveal any details about the processors supported
in Amiga NG ? MMC chip?

{p} {p}
(Timmer) jim: what compilers will be supplied with the dev system and
5.0? eg. GCC, Metroworks, WatCom?
{p} {p}

{p} {p}
(Blitter) What types of applications do we need to creat as a
community... any ideas from the developement that has happenend so
far.... Jeff stated you need our help with apps. for the next gen
amiga. GA
{p} {p}
(Jim) Games, multimedia, internet based S/W, things that will be
innovative and exciting. We will be looking for developers to help us
once we get a solid foundation in Q3. We will be posting information
on our Web site.
{p} {p}
(amidude) What marketing/advertising will be used to reach 20-30
million units sold? GA
{p} {p}
(Jim) There will be significant marketing funds starting later this
year but we will also depend on large volume OEMs to use Amiga as a
standard.
{p} {p}
(cade) Jim, Thanks and we are SOOOo happy to have you with us, Thank
you so much! question. What about other countries? Will you be
targeting mainly the US in the beginning?what about small countries
like South Africa? Can we expect some form of Hype and marketing?  GA
{p} {p}
(Jim) We intend to drive Amiga as a global company but will start our
focus in countries with a significant Amiga presence i.e. Germany,
U.K., and the U.S.
{p} {p}
(Ng) How do you see the new Amigas coping with the growing popularity of
the "free" OS, Linux and it's suitablitiy to all of the Amiga's
target markets?
{p} {p}
(Jim) We are evaluating the Linux O/S to understand how we may be able
to support Linux environments. No plans yet.
{p} {p}
(CyberWolf) Q: Is Metabox (formerly PIOS) involved in the development
of the new AMIGAs? GA
{p} {p}
(Jim) They are not directly invloved but we are in touch with them to
understand what they are doing.
{p} {p}
(Tiggster) We have heard that Amiga, Inc. is primarily a software
company. Will AI be releasing an AmigaNG computer or will that be the
responsibility of your partners? GA
{p} {p}
(Jim) We will be introducing exciting new hardware also but we want an
open H/W architecture so that the AMiga environment will be used in
multiple products.
{p} {p}
(OSS542) We am interested in porting our current software to the new
Amiga.What sort of development support can we expect for this ? BTW:
Just bought a new GPS-450 the other day....:-) Doa though...:-(
{p} {p}
(Jim) We will be publishing all required information for developers
when available. We will also have engineering people dedicated to
supporting developers.We are currently hiring engineering people in
our new engineering facility in San JOse under Dr. Allan Havemose.
{p} {p}
(Dracvl) Firstly: Welcome aboard, Mr. Collas. Questions: 1. Will the
dev.system require anything but a normal x86-based-PC? 2. How about
pricing - will the development package be free?
{p} {p}
(Jim) We are thinking about offering a multimedia card as part of the
O/S bundle to allow for advanced multimedia features and performance
that may not be available in all PCs.We have not determined any
pricing for development environment. We may have 3rd party costs
associated.
{p} {p}
(NorthWay) when will we get some _solid_ info to judge what the new
Amiga will be? I don't think you expect anyone to show up on a DevCon
without prior knowledge. and I'd like a porting layer too :). GA
{p} {p}
(Jim) We should be releasing detailed information in July/AUgust. It
may be earlier if we feel that it will help people start development.
{p} {p}
(Mawrick) will there be developement tools that will be as good as
Borland builder, VC (or similar products)? ,and are you going to have
some sort of fees on sw-development licenses like ms-wind*** :) ? GA
{p} {p}
(Jim) We are still working on development environment plans. Don't
expect to be like MS.
{p} {p}
(Zap) Are the slides that where shown going to be made public so we
can view them via www? GA
{p} {p}
(Jim) We are releasing to the press tomorrow and will post on the site
next week.
{p} {p}
(cwallace) one more question!
{p} {p}
(HammerD) 1) Can you release more specific information on OS 3.5
features? 2) Will Amiga International sell the planned multimedia
computer under the Amiga name? (as C= sold the A1200) or will you
depend soley on 3rd parties? GA.
{p} {p}
(mrpop2) by `we need many of you` you (jeff) mean the classic
developers? so purly treated so far, if that is the case (please be
explicit with your words so as to make it clear) where doest Mick
tinkers projects stand now that it appears Gateway/Ainc are not
interested in his classic PCI card now, will you make an official
statement (HERE&NOW) dropping him or perhaps the classic community
that gateway say they admire and NEED, were miss informed and your ac
{p} {p}
(TB) Sorry bout that, slight mistake on the que :)
{p} {p}
(Jim) OS 3.5 features were disclosed today. They will be on the Web
site early next week.I understand that we have fallen short in certain
areas. I am working on plan for better developers support. I will be
reviewing the classic PCI situation next week. I can't give you a final
statement until I meet with them.
{p} {p}
(cwallace) thank you everyone
{p} {p}
(TB) Thanks Jim for speaking here today
