As this is my first entry into this diary, I'll first tell a bit about
Random Intellect and our first game, Faction Wars.
{p} {p}
Random Intellect is a new freeware games design group. Our goal is to
create high quality, multi-platform games-software.
{p} {p}
We currently are designing an epic space based game, based on Master of
Orion and Civilization. This game is Faction Wars.
{p} {p}
In Faction Wars, the player is the leader of one of five different factions,
each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Apart from surviving the
overall hostilities of space and the other factions, there also is the
imminent threat of an alien invasion. Though often hostile towards each
other, both the factions and the earth state share one common goal: To
destroy the alien fleets, before they destroy humanity.
{p} {p}
In this diary, several members of the Random Intellect team will describe
how we go about making this game, from a personal point of view. If
you're just interested in the facts, you should check our status report,
which is ( or will be ) available on our web-site:

Oh, before I begin.. You can find a list of project members on the
web-site as well...

December - February:
{p} {p}
As much as I'd like to believe otherwise, the sad truth is that Random
Intellect is fast turning into another 'JIT' ( Just In Time ) group...
This diary was supposed to be written during the period it describes...
However, it is now one day before my deadline and I've only just begun..
( There's a lesson in here somewhere... )
{p} {p}
Since the founding of our 'group' in august 1998, we have mostly been
deciding what type of game to make, how our logo should look and whether
or not we should have a web-site... In December, however, we had enough
of an idea to start designing. Since designing is all we've done, this
diary will focus mostly on design..
{p} {p}
The first month ( December ) was used mostly to build our web-pages, which
are finally beginning to look like a professional design. ( The logo is,
by the way, an Imagine 4.0 trace, made on my Amiga 1200 ( It took four
hours to render.... ) )
{p} {p}
During January, we started making real progress when Gideon and me got
together and started working on a 'global game model'
( which is now finished ).. This global model contains the inner workings
of the game, on an abstract level. It will ( hopefully ) be deepend over
time, right down to the programmer's application level.
{p} {p}
On the fourth of February, we had our last monthly meeting so far
( The next one is, surprisingly, held at the 4th of March ). During that
meeting ( Which, incidently, is one of the most productive ones so far ),
we discussed our model and decided on a name for the new homeworld of
the earth government. The earth goverment is called Starcom in our game.
It's home world lies in the remote Tau Alpha system ( As seen on our
web-site ). However, no-one could come up with a suitable name for it..
So we decided to write our suggestions down and vote. We had a list of five
names, all remarkably similar, and started arguing about which name to
vote for.. We where in a bit of a fix, since only two people ( myself
and Ricardo ) where left to vote.. The problem was that two of the names
had an identical amount of votes.. Basically, if I voted the one, Ricardo
would the other... In the end, we just decided on Isharo, later changed
into Ishara.. Hope you like it, cause humanity is stuck with it...
{p} {p}
Well, that's it for the february edition of the Faction Wars diary.. If
you have any questions, don't hesitate to e-mail us..

Till next month, Jeroen Knoester.

Hmm, a diary... Ok, what shall I begin with?
I am one of the two guys responsible for a good story during the game
(the other one is Alex). To reach this, we have decided to write a
novella. That novella should be the base for the game. Sounds good? Well,
we thought so too. But a novella isn't written in a day. The different
elements of the game (earth, Starcom, aliens, factions) should all have
their proper place.
{p} {p}
To get some good ideas for the story, Alex and I have been playing chess
and drinking whiskey for several weeks now. And yet, we haven't got the
faintest idea how to end the story. Where the game starts, the story
should end. But who would like to read an unfinished novella? For as
long as this problem isn't solved we'll be drinking whiskey and playing
chess...
