Gee, March already? This year just seems to be accelerating as the next
millenium approaches. Well, here's a few spots that just might help you
enjoy the ride as the End Of Time(TM) approaches (just joking). Happy
browsing.
{p} {p}
Amiga Central{p}

{p} {p}
A good source for anything you'll need for support of Mac emulation
the Amiga, there's System 7.5 hardfiles, Mac drivers and utilities,
emulator news, Mac tech info and even a little bookstore. Coming soon
(May) is a similar section for support of PC emulators. A nice little
browser watch rounds this site out.

Bomb Simpsons Pictures{p}

{p} {p}
Yes, there's a Simpson's web site; not an official one mind you, but a
site with over a hundred pictures of the most disfunctional cartoon
family around. Be it Homer, Bart, Krusty the Clown, any of themany
guests that have appeared in animated proxy, or even the occasional
alien, there are pix of them there for you to download.  Worth a check.

Puzzles, Riddles, And Brain Teasers{p}
{link http://www.folkart.com/~latitude/puzzle/puzzle.htm}http://www.folkart.com/~latitude/puzzle/puzzle.htm{end}
{p} {p}
A simple little puzzle page, just chock full of brain teasers. A new
brain teaser is posted every month, with the answer given the month
after. There are links on this page to other years' puzzles, for a full
range of puzzles from 1996-1998. Send in your own answers or read
others' answers. Brain teasers enough here to keep you busy for a while.

National UFO Reporting Center{p}
{link http://www.ufocenter.com}http://www.ufocenter.com{end}
{p} {p}
If you've seen unusual lights in the sky or been talking to
extraterrestrials, then this is the place to report it. Call or email
in your report, or browse a database of reports, case briefs, and
retrospectives that goes back decades. Perfect UFO clearinghouse.

DF Duck's Home Page{p}

{p} {p}
Hmmm, someone's hompage as a Pick Of The Month? Yessiree, if it's the
right one. DFDuck, a resident of the Arcnet gang, has a web site that
has nearly too much going on inside it for me to review even as my
monthly Pick, but I'll give it a try. Over 20 megs of stuff and he says
he's STILL adding to it. I'll do my best to give a little summary of it
all here, but you're gonna just have to go and spend a couple of days
there for yourself.
{p} {p}
First a few minor things.  Current Time shows where on the arth you'll
daylight at the moment, what phase of the moon is out, and the time over
where DF happens to live. Color Codes is a large chart with the html
color codes, their names, and a color sample shown.
{p} {p}
Idiots Hook is a mess of buttons, menus, and links that serve no purpose
other than to waste your time with some pointless time. Pearl Maze is a
nice little maze to click your way through (hey, I gave him the brick
wall pattern he's using!).
{p} {p}
Want to see what the ARcnet people look like?  Read there bios? Then
you should check out the (is it official?) Arcnet IRC users section he
has. Submit your own application if you're on Arcnet a lot.
You'll even find my own entry and Pic here.
{p} {p}
Duck James- The Arthritic Blues. A few mpegs of df's own playing on his
electric guitar.
{p} {p}
DFDuck's Amiga software: Not only is he a good with making web sites
that fill up more space than the poor generous provider had anticipated,
but he's written several pieces of Amiga software, all of which you can
download from here, most of it in Arexx, including a nice little bot
called Golden Emerod.  Yes, he's a master Arexx coder, just give him a
good idea and he'll probably coe it up for you.
{p} {p}
DFDuck's Free Greeting Cards: yet another online greeting card, but this 
one is easier, has more options (accompanying music anyone), and seems 
to work.
{p} {p}
In his This Sucks page you can read all his entries on things he doesn't 
like. Rather amuzing.
{p} {p}
Have a question about any of the AmigaDos commands, error codes, and Guru
codes? Well, he has them all online here; just click on what you have a
question about and the explanation pops up.
{p} {p}
Need more?  How's about a page full of search engines, lots of links,
including one to our own AIO home page, and DF's own Woohoo search
engine. Wooho is not only a complete categorized search engine for all
thoe little things that catch people's (mainly DF's) interest, but
there's a new feature there: A page dedicated to the Web Wanderer
himself. Every site that I've reviewed is here, grouped by the AIO
issue it was given in, with direct links to those sites.
{p} {p}
I could also mention the Red Eye cam (see him online through his wweb 
camera), the new message forums (5 categories), DFDuck's Quacked News, 
the nice little animated Boing gif to download, the Art Gallery, Photo 
Album (see what it looks like where he lives), and- well, I think you
more than get the idea by now. I won't even get into his stock car
racing section as that qualifies as a web site (and entirely separate
review) all by itself.
{p} {p}
All in all the site is well laid out, complete with a no frames option
for the frame-impaired. he's always adding things, so there should be 
more than enough things here to keep you busy until the Next issue of
AIO. Visit it and you'll see what happens when someone's brain just
does a core-dump onto his web server.
