 Hello all AIO readers! - I can gladly tell you that we have quite a
few readers aswell from well over 21 countries around the world. This
is the best ever time in the history of AIO and I would like to thankyou
all for your kind comments and support over the 22 months that we have
been running.

 Let me first appologise for the week lateness of this issue which was
down to me being ill for the week and am still not 100% ok but have
done my best to get AIO out as soon as possible. I hope this has not
caused any problems for anyone but it was unavoidable and I hope you will
bare with me.

 Some great news this issue is we have an interview with the main man,
{bold}Petro Tyschtschenko{nobold}, we have asked him some of the questions
that the members of the JUST-AMiGA mailing list wanted to know and I
hope it makes good reading and was worth the wait.{p}
 We also have some other great things to read this issue with a full
review of the Dopus Plus CD from Greg Perry, the Faction Wars diary
part one direct from Jeroen Knoester at Random Intellect and some other
excellent reviews, articles and news stories.

 This month I don't have alot to say on the state of the Amiga as only
a few things have made any real impact. Instead of talking about various
little topics I have decided to highlight the decreasing readership of
Amiga Format, the last main-stream print magazine in the UK. AF now up
to issue 122, April 1999 has seen the release of the latest ABC figures
for registered circulation. These figures are alarmingly low and normally
we see AF talking about them somewhere in the magazine but I think they
may not have said anything about them since they are so low. The figure
for sales from July - December 1998 are just 14,644. This may seem like
a high figure but out of a country thats population is 54-56 million it
is not a good state for a magazine to be in. Consider Mac Format and
Official Playstation UK, MF receives 35,000 with Official Playstation
UK taking well over 300,000 ABC circulation recordings.{p}
 Of course we hear that Future Publishing work different to EMAP,
publishers of now closed CU Amiga but when you consider that CU Amiga
was receiving 21,599 ABC circulation figures on the last issue and
AF is now only receiving 14,644 things do not look at all good. AF
has gone from figures of 22,175 for July - December 1997 in the May 1998
issue to 19,220 for January - June 1998 in the February 1999 issue to
just 14,644 a dip of 4576 and overall from the May 1998 issue a dip of
7531. These numbers are very worrying indeed and I will not be surprised
if Amiga Format announces that it will be closing shortly.{p}
 I defiantly do not want Amiga Format to close but publishing companies
do have a limit and when it comes to a point where a magazine is making
very little income or just braking even then it seems time to close.
{p} {p}
 I do not want to worry anyone and I am not saying that it is closing,
it may not but just don't think it isn't a possibility. A good note is
AIO is not funded at all and will go on for as long as is required
by you the readers, hooray!!
