You may think this game is about snakes, but really it has nothing to do
with them. This is one of the (crap) games from Samuel Brookes. which you
may remember from Amiga Format`s reader games section a while back now.

The idea is to get your ambulance to the hostipal, which is futher away
every level. For some reason the ambulance doesn`t go on a road, but on
some green stuff. While the ambulance is astationary at the bottom of the screen
some circlular things come down from the middle of the screen. If you hit
one you lose a life. You start with about 10!

Simple games can be really good, but Sam`s effort is crap. It is based on
Egyption Run, which I think was in the Games Section before? That is okay,
but Sam has made it too easy by giving you a rediculasory large amount of
lives and his dodge snake graphics. And to add insalt to injury you
sometimes get bits of circular things get attached to the ambulance. This
is a bug which Sam can`t be bothered to remove.

Sorry Sam. I hate this! It`s 150k, and the download time isn`t worth it.
Make something good, with sound, and no bugs!
