Yes we have it, an interview with Petro Tyschtschenko himself. AIO has
scooped the others and brought you some answers to the questions
you've all been asking. Please understand that Petro is not able to
talk about all situations. Now, on with the interview.
{p} {p}
{bold}AIO{nobold}: What products will you have to sell at Amiga99?{p}
{bold}PETRO{nobold}: You mean the St. Louis show in March?  Our existing Product
range. We will show the new icons of the OS 3.5 as demonstration.
{p} {p}
{bold}AIO{nobold}: What will the emulation possibilities of the new machine be like?
Full emulation of Classic Amiga, PC, Mac? if the chip is supposed to
be better than that of the best PC will we see PC emulators at good
speed?{p}
{bold}PETRO{nobold}: I think this question is too early in this stage. I recommand
that you should contact our VP Development Dr. Allan Havemose in San
Jose, and I am sure that he can answering a little bit more.
{p} {p}
{bold}AIO{nobold}: Will software/hardware producers be getting the pre-amiga machine?
Top companies like Capcom, Rare, Team 17, etc, all big games companies
need to be able to produce things for the new machine and not just
current Amiga companies?{p}
{bold}PETRO{nobold}: Yes, that is the plan.
{p} {p}
{bold}AIO{nobold}: Will any old hardware plug into the NG: Amiga? Many users have
spent hundreds upgrading the classic Amigas, will any current hardware
be able to be used?{p}
{bold}PETRO{nobold}: You also should contact for this answer our Development
department in USA.
{p} {p}
{bold}AIO{nobold}: What data storage medias will be available? DVD, CD, Disk?{p}
{bold}PETRO{nobold}: My understanding is all three mediums.
{p} {p}
{bold}AIO{nobold}: Will the CPU be faster than the current G3`s Ie the 700Mhz one.{p}
{bold}PETRO{nobold}: No comment so far at this moment. Please understand.
{p} {p}
{bold}AIO{nobold}: Do you have a rough price range for the NG: Amiga?{p}
{bold}PETRO{nobold}: It is also a little to early for an answer.
{p} {p}
{bold}AIO{nobold}: As far as you can tell will there be any chance of a new machine
before Christmas this year?{p}
{bold}PETRO{nobold}: The new SW will be available before Christmas, that is the plan
for sure.
{p} {p}
{bold}AIO{nobold}: Will the CPU chip be easily updatable IE lift out and slot in.
This may be very important if all of us buy the first machine - say
400mhz  version only to find a 700mhz version a month later?{p}
{bold}PETRO{nobold}: Please, contact our developing department.
{p} {p}
{bold}AIO{nobold}: Could you please clarify the role of Amiga, Int. and Amiga, Inc.?
Is it a subsidiary of Amiga, Inc, or one of Gateway? What sense does it
make to have marketing company in Germany and Development in the States?
(With Bill McEwen as "head of marketing" in the US, btw)?{p}
{bold}PETRO{nobold}: Please see our last Press release. We will smelt together as
one company, with one website and one President. Which makes the
things much more easier and transparent. In the future our company
structure will change complete to perform our future plans.
{p} {p}
{bold}AIO{nobold}: The other big country on the Amiga front is the UK, will we
see any  Amiga office open here any time soon?{p}
{bold}PETRO{nobold}: At the moment we have no plans to open a subsidiary in the UK.
But of course when our business is growing with the NG we will start
to think about this seriously.
{p} {p}
{bold}AIO{nobold}: What is the current release date for O.S3.5, how far til it is
complete?{p}
{bold}PETRO{nobold}: We will show some demos already in St.Louis USA on 12 - 14
March 99. The OS 3.5 will be available for sales in June 1999
{p} {p}
{bold}AIO{nobold}: Have Amiga on a whole started talking to printer etc companies
to produce drivers for various hardware add-ons for the new machine?{p}
{bold}PETRO{nobold}: As soon as we have established our new organisation in San Diego
and San Jose, we will start activities....
{p} {p}
{bold}AIO{nobold}: Will we actually see TV/Magazine advertisements when the new Amiga
is released?{p}
{bold}PETRO{nobold}: Of course, because we have to do a lot of PR work and advertisement
to establish the NG in the market.
{p} {p}
{bold}AIO{nobold}: What is being done to support current Amiga companies to stay
afloat?{p}
{bold}PETRO{nobold}: We will improve the communication line and support developers.
{p} {p}
{bold}AIO{nobold}: If the Amiga is released and takes over the current PC market will
Gateway turn completely Amiga related or are their plans just to run
the Amiga as a small side computer for minimal financial gains{p}
{bold}PETRO{nobold}: If we have a change to play a big role, and I am quite
optimistic, than of course I am sure that Gateway is interested to
participate.
{p} {p}
Thank-you Petro for your time. We all look forward to the brightening
future of the Amiga.
{p} {p}
In the next few issues we will try to secure an interview with Dr. Allan
Havemose, hoping that he will beable to shed some more light on the
questions that Petro could not help with.
