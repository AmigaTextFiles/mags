Yes, now courtesy ARCnet regular DFDuck, you can link to any of the
sites reviewed in this column directly from his site (DDFDuck's
homepage is reviewed in this issue's Web Wanderer).

Just go to his Woohoo Search Engine (you'll find the link on his main
page), and you'll find a section devoted just to Web Wanderer sites.
Grouped by the issue in which they were reviewed, there's short 2-line
overview for each and then a link directly  to the site.  All the sites
I've reviewed since I started this thing are here.

DF says he will keep the links updated regularily (and if he doesn't,
I'll beat him over the head with a wet noodle), so break out those
browsers and connect up to {link http://146.189.18.29/~dfd/links/Web_Wanderer}http://146.189.18.29/~dfd/links/Web_Wanderer{end}
for all the latest sites.
