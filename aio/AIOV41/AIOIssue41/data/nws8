Long standing Amiga advocate and Amiga Germany boss Petro Tyschtschenko is to
retire.  Petro's efforts kept the Amiga company afloat during the years of
bouncing from one owner to the next, and his contributions will be missed. 
Amiga Germany is also to close when the last stocks of real Amiga hardware are
finally sold out.
