Can anyone remember the heady days of home gaming with Binatone or
Grandstand consoles? Playing games of squash, tennis and football
with graphics of lines and a big square for the ball. Well I can and
that's why I downloaded this game.
{p} {p}
Gareth Griffiths obviously remembers those days and has decided to
bring the game into the modern era for people too young to have been
exposed and corrupted.
{p} {p}
Upon loading the game you are greeted with an intro screen that tells
you what game you're going to be playing and a tune that, I think, is
really good. You've got four choices here. 1 player, 2 players,
training mode and the options. All fairly obvious I think you'll
agree.
{p} {p}
I checked out the options menu and found quite a lot you can change.
The Game Options allows you to change virtually everything in the
game. Once that's done you can start playing.
{p} {p}
Playing the 1-player game all you have to do is keep the ball in the
playing arena. You get points each time your bat hits the ball. You
have a bat on each side of the arena so, as you'd expect, it's quite
easy and a bit dull. If the ball leaves the arena then you lose a
life and your score is added. This continues until all five lives
have gone. To make the game a bit more exciting you can have walls in
the middle of the arena. The ball bounces off these at any angle it
wants. It even gets stuck and flings off in a random direction.
Annoying? Not half!
{p} {p}
The 2-player game is much the same but you're against a mate. The
first to ten wins. You gain a point each time your opponent misses
the ball.
{p} {p}
In both the games there are power-ups that either double or halve
your current score and in 2-player mode there is a freeze that stops
your opponent from moving.
{p} {p}
The graphics in Alien Pong are serviceable. The game was a bit jerky
and it had a very rubbery feel when playing. For me the best thing
about Alien Pong is the music. Good choice of tunes.
{p} {p}
On the plus side you can create your own background for use in the
game but would you bother if you're not going to play it?
{p} {p}
I'm sorry but I think there are better Pong games out there and you
can get an exact emulation of the real thing from CU Amiga cover disk
51. Hunt that one out.
{p} {p}
Oh, and another thing. Where are the aliens? I didn't see any. Not
one.
