If you like addictive puzzle games then look no further than Pictris.
{p} {p}
You can choose to play from CD or install it onto your hard drive. It
doesn't matter which you choose, I found both to be fine.
{p} {p}
Once you have gone through the language and screen mode selections
you're into the game.
{p} {p}
The first major plus for this game is it has a tutorial. This is, in
my opinion, an absolute must for all games. Who can be bothered to
read the manual/docs?
{p} {p}
The tutorial explains the basic concepts of playing Pictris. The game
is very easy to play and the tutorial is not too long winded in its
explanation.
{p} {p}
Basically all you have to do is find the hidden picture in the grid
by clearing the used blocks within a set time. The game is set out in
a grid and the number of used blocks is marked along the top and left
hand side. You just clear the blocks using the left mouse button and
mark blank squares with the right button.
{p} {p}
If you clear a block that is unused then you lose time. The more
mistakes you make the more time is lost until you either find the
hidden picture or run out of time. Trust me it's easier to play than
explain.
{p} {p}
There are three difficulty levels, easy, medium and hard. There are
80 levels in each difficulty and you must complete the medium level
before you can play the hard level.
{p} {p}
So, you choose the easy difficulty!
{p} {p}
Pictris then asks you to create a game save file and with that done
you can begin. Just click the level that is shown by the pencil
cursor.
{p} {p}
At the beginning of each level you are asked if you would like a
hint. If you do then some of the grid is cleared for you. At the end
of the level you can check your best times and improve on a level in
which you might have done poorly by replaying it.
{p} {p}
The game is automatically saved as you progress so there is no
forgetting and having to replay any previous levels.
{p} {p}
Within the game you get to change the background if you find it
contrasts with the picture you are trying to find. There are also
five music modules to choose from or you can even load your own.
{p} {p}
Pictris is one of those games where you find yourself trying to
complete just one more level and when that's done you'll have just
one more go etc etc. I got completely engrossed in the game and
completed the easy level without too many problems. I did have to
replay some levels but it was no bother. The medium level I've found
to be very challenging and I have yet to try the hard level.
{p} {p}
The graphics and sound are both very good throughout and I like this
game a lot. My only gripe, and a very small one it is to, is when the
game asks you for a hint. It doesn't look as good as it could but
that is all I could find and I wouldn't even bother to listen to me
about that.
{p} {p}
Buy this game, it will keep you hooked. I wonder if there are extra
levels going to be produced?
