For those of you too young to remember, the Sinclair C5 was Sir Clive
Sinclair's (yes the same geezer who brought us the Spectrum) answer
to pollution free driving. It fell short by miles nay light years!!!
It was like sitting in a battery-powered bathtub and I jest you not.
{p} {p}
With all this going for it you might wonder what would possess any
programmer to create a game on such an obvious loser? Well Chris
Young obviously thought he'd backed a winner and went ahead to create
a top down racing sim.

When you've opened the first window you have several options, the
game, track editor, guide & anim. Looking good. I ran the anim first
as you would expect. Gods, from that moment I knew this was going to
be hard work. I next ran the game because nobody reads guides unless
they can't figure how to play a game.
{p} {p}
The intro screen is nothing at all to write home about. You
understand the quotes only when you've played this game and, trust
me, they are funny. This is also the options screen. You can change
your name and choose the mode of play: on your own, against the
computer or head to head with a mate. If you're in 2 player mode you
get to choose if the battery is on or not but I'll get to that later.
Whatever you do don't choose to play without at least a computer
opponent it's very, very dull.

Well, into the game we go. Hit the PLAY button and track 1 is loaded.
You've got to be quick on your joystick because the race starts as
soon as the screen loads.

The first thing you notice is that the graphics are truly awful and,
for the life of me, I couldn't make out the Sinclair C5 in the white
and black contraption in which you trundle around the track.
{p} {p}
The controls are easy - left, right and fire to move. Speed wise
you've got stop and go so no problems here. Sound is non-existent. A
ping for crossing the start line and a very annoying collision sound.
If you stray off the track you slow down. If you cut too much off the
corners your lap doesn't count which you find out when you don't get
a ping as you cross the start line. If you get stuck you can press
the HELP key and the circuit is mapped out for you. A very nice
touch.
{p} {p}
2-player mode is no better. This is where the battery comes into its
own. If you have the battery mode on then it can run out mid race.
This leaves you with peddling. Just press the fire button continually
and you move round the track so slowly you find yourself shouting
naughty words. If both players' batteries run out then the game
becomes really bad. Neither of you can be bothered finishing the
race. Trust me you'd have to be really pig headed to continue.
{p} {p}
In my opinion Sinclair C5 Simulation is even worse than the
contraption upon which the game is based. It's bad. Dire. It's so bad
I considered pretending I didn't download it from the Aminet!

Chris has obviously got talent so if anyone is a graphic artist or a
sound specialist then join up and make a playable game.
