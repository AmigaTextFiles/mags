Dear Amiga Family:
{p} {p}
I am writing this as I fly back from a wonderful two days at the ACE 2000
Amiga show in Melbourne, Australia. It was indeed a great delight and
pleasure to meet with all the wonderful members of the Amiga Family Down
Under, and I already look forward to my next opportunity to visit
Australia.
{p} {p}
I especially want to thank all the dealers, developers and end users who
attended the seminars and the hundreds of you who joined for the banquet
dinner. Amiga truly is a global family, and too much of an unknown
phenomena. It is the Amiga Family who has kept this amazing system alive
and growing.
{p} {p}
I would like to take a moment to recognize the efforts of two people who
especially made my stay in Australia an enjoyable and educational
experience. Jeff Rose, of Unitech, the d'Amiga distributor for Australia,
and Basil Flinter the Secretary of the Amiga Down Under Group or ADUG. I
want to thank them both for taking the extra time to help me truly
understand what Australia and New Zealand mean to Amiga, and what Amiga
can do to help our its Family Down Under. I can certainly say that on my
next trip I will take the time to also visit New Zealand and say hello in
person.

{p} {p}
There are many exciting things happening with Amiga and I wanted to tell
the entire Amiga community what the attendees of ACE 2000 learned at the
show.
{p} {p}
Amiga will release an upgrade for the Classic AmigaOS! Version 3.9 of the
AmigaOS will be shipped and ready for the 2000 holiday
season. AmigaOS 3.9 is being developed in concert with Haage and Partner
GmbH. A new website devoted specifically to OS3.9 will be online shortly
and it will include an OS feature list and other bits of useful
information. OS 3.9 will be made available to classic Amiga users for the
affordable price of under $40.00 US. Watch our main website,
www.amiga.com, for more details of OS 3.9 and its new
website.

Because Amiga is still a Benevolent Dictatorship-and not a democracy or
even a republic-we listen closely to the feedback and input from the
community. Based on this feedback we strive to create products that you
want, need and enjoy.
{p} {p}
We are pleased to announce to the community the first in a series of new
hardware that has been designed by Amiga and soon manufactured by Amiga
OEM partners. The first in our AmigaONE series of products are the
AmigaONE PPC 1200, and the AmigaONE PPC 4000 cards from Eyetech. These
products will become available to developers in December this year and are
designed to meet the specific needs of the Amiga Community. We have also
announced another partner, bPlan GmbH, who are creating a new AmigaONE PPC
based desktop computer.
{p} {p}
More details will emerge shortly about bPlan, Eyetech and the new AmigaONE
products, so visit the AmigaONE web site at
{link www.amiga.com/products/one/pr.shtml}www.amiga.com/products/one/pr.shtml{end}
to stay informed.
{p} {p}
I would also like to announce new versions of the Amiga SDK. AmigaSDK
version 1.1 will begin shipping on October 24, 2000. In addition to an
upgrade for the Linux version, we are please to release the Windows
version of the Amiga SDK as well.
{p} {p}
There was a mistake in the September 28 Executive Update. As erroneously
printed in the update, the Amiga SDK 1.1 does not include the sound, UI,
or 3D pieces. These will be found in version 1.2, which itself will be
released shortly. I am sorry for the error, but take comfort in the fact
that purchasers of an Amiga SDK receive free updates and upgrades for 12
months from the date of purchase.
{p} {p}
{bold}Closing{nobold}
{p} {p}
It has been an amazing 10 months since we started Amiga Incorporated. The
community has seen the delivery of the Amiga SDK, an upgrade to the SDK,
an upgrade to the Classic AmigaOS, and now the announcement of three PPC
based AmigaONE products. We still have a long way to go and many more
battles to fight, but I am confident that with the community behind us,
and the enhancements to the product line continuing, there is a long and
exciting future for Amiga.
{p} {p}
To the user group members around the world, it is time to start calling
the members who have drifted away and let them know what is happening with
the new Amiga. We want them to know they can again be part of continuing
the legacy that is Amiga.
{p} {p}
Again thanks to Greg, and Michael, and the thousands of other Amigans Down
Under  who made ACE 2000 such a great event.
{p} {p}
Get Boinged!
