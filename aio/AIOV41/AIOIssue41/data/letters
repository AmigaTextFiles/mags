Hi. Right now i'm sitting here if front of my amiga and reading AIO.
{p} {p}
I come up to the games area and saw a review by muzkat about the game
called TechnoCop.
{p} {p}
He has really fresheaned up my memories as i have in all these years wondered what
the game was called and that i loved it. This game i played in months trying to get
to the end. I really don't know if i did but i know i enjoyed this piece of a great game.

It would be great seeing this game in a new version with more colors better gfx and more
speed. (that's my dream come true, heh).

Thanks for a great mag (AIO ofcourse)

Please can you tell me where I can find a copy of Pile o Tiles for my PC. I
used to love playing it on my ex's Amiga but unfortunately he got custody
of it in the divorce!!{p}
Many thanks
