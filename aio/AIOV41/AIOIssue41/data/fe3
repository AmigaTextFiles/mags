Dopus and Keyfinder:{p}
Ever loose track of what Dopus hotkey does what?  Or just want a quick 
way to see if a ot-key combination is free weithout going to look them 
all up?  Under the menu item "Opus" is the entry "Ket Finder...".  This 
brings up a window in which aall you have to do is type in the desired 
hot-key, hit Return, and up comes the name of the Hot-Key and it's 
corresponding commands.  Usefull

MultiFileSystem and DOpus:{p}
These two work well together, just remember to have MFS properly 
installed.  T>hen when using Format through DOpus, just call up MFS
through exchange, set your file system {italic}first{noitalic} for the 
desired DFx:, then the DOpus Format window will automatically update
the format paremeters (memory size of disk when formatted, etc.).
But don't forget to set MFS back to "Automatic" when you're through.

ToolsDaemon:{p}
If you use ToolsDaemon then a good companion program for it is 
"TDPrefs"; it makes for a better interface, but after saving prefs you
still have to call up ToolsDaemon and save the prefs
{italic}there{noitalic}.
