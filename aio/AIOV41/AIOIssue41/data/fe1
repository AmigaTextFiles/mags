November and it's getting cold up in this hemisphere. Perfect weather
for intense web browsing. So, in an effort to keep you all indoors and
warm, here's this month's selection of web sites.  So, keep warm by
keep browsing...

Amiga One Homepage{p}
http://www.amiga.com/products/one/{p}
Just something everyone should bookmark, the homepage for the new
upcoming Amiga One. If you want to keep informed on all things
related to this new machine, from specs to news and discussion, then
just keep an eye on this site.

The Burger King Therapy Center{p}
http://www.beadworld.com/amber/bktherapy/{p}
A perfect place for anyone out there that's ever worked in a burger
joint, or even if you haven't.  Horror stories and pet peeves of what
goes on inside a burger place (neever go to near the deep fryer),
recipees using those things the customers don't {bold}want{nobold} to,
and in general a good place for burger-flippers to get some much
needed therapy.  There's even one of those "you know you've been working
hetre when-" lists.  Pretty good fun.

Post-It Theater{p}
http://www.bigempire.com/postittheater/{p}
Thpose Ubiquitous pieces of yellow paper atre here to stay so why not
make the most of it?  Take the guy who'se drawn cartoons on actual
post-it notes, scanned them in, and then put them up on this web site
for everyone's amusement. Worth a quick go around.

Useles Movie Quotes{p}
http://members.tripod.com/umq/umqm.htm{p}
Your basic online database of assorted movie quotes, sortable by either
movie name or the actor that said them. Great tag-line source material.
Be warned though, this site is Cookie-happy.

Pick Of The Month

BBSpot{p}
http://www.bbspot.com/{p}
Another tongue-in-cheek on-line news-zine, there's no mistaking  the
intent of parody and humor here.  Updated daily, you'll always find
topical humor here done in the form of would-be news articles.
{p} {p}
Broken down into a few categories- News, Sports/Entertainment,
Technology/Busines, and Features- you can thus select what type of
subject you want to laugh about.  And there's plenty of news snippets
for ewach, not to mention the Archive.  My personal fav was the one
about the next 25 years of Microsoft (President gates abolishing the
Supreme Court in 2004 so they don't rule against him, Windows 2010
coming out in 2012, a year or two after it's service, pack, and a few
other bits).

Wrap this up with a regular on-line poll (complete with an archive of past
polls), Message Board, and the usual line of T-Shirts, and this site's good for
a laugh or three.  I think I'll go back to their article on a Head
Hunter agency run by {italic}real{noitalic} head hunters.
