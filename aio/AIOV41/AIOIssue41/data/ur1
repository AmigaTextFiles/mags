This program is an utility to launch your favourite programs, games
and so on. First off it reminds me of the Octopus program that comes
with NetConnect, but in a waterdowned version perhaps. About the
configuration there isn't much say, it's easy to configure, and there
are a few applications pre-set to give you an idea of how to pull it
off. The preferences aren't very nice, as it doesn't seem to be font
sensitive! And the design doesn't feel right to me; however, it does
the job, and there's not much quirkyness involved.

The program is shareware, so if you actually think that this program
fills an important place on your WB, then by all means, register it,
me on the other hand, I think there are alot of better programs
around that does the job much better. Also, it crashed a few times
during testing, which doesn't really raise my impression of it.
