WBBump is a funny little thing, indeed. It makes your WB (or the
public screen of your choice) look a little nicer by allowing you to
choose a little picture to emerge in the center of your screen while
moving the mouse over it. Very pleasant. You can alter the images by
using tooltypes, the program supports datatypes, so you can use any
image you have a datatype for. There are also a bunch of plugins to
give different effects. The program itself is of commodity type, so
it's easy to control it. It is designed to take up as little
CPU-usage as possible, and its priority is held at a low place not to
interfere with other programs, and it seems it does these things very
well as I couldn't detect any slowdowns worth mentioning. The
sourcecode is also available, and there are compiling notes in the
manual to get you on the right track in case you feel like improving
something in this program yourself.

This program is perhaps not so very useful, other than for the eye,
but I guess there's no such thing as making your WB look too nice,
right?
