November and it's getting cold up here.  I suppose this is where all
you Aussies get to gloat.  Well anyway, Amiga seems to be moving
forward as promised.  OS3.9 is coming out (and at a reasonable price,
for once), an upgrade for A1200s and
A4000s to the new Amiga One is on it's way as well, and the first new
official Amiga has been stated up and due out next year.  Looks good
so far.

Still though, I wouldn't relax any vigilance yet.  Now is a crucial
time for Amiga and the Community, a precipise from which we could go
either way.  Give Amiga your support, but also keep your eyes open for
any stumbling along yhe way.  If you see or suspect a problem, then
politely pass it on to the proper Amigan authorities.  be helpful, be
vigilant, voice your suggestions or complaints.

Because folks, this is our last chance.  We achieve greatness or ashes
here, there is no middle ground.  Help Amiga to help themselves... and
the future of us all.

Happy Holidays!
