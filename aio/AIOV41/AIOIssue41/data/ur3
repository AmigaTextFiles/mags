Another start button thingie, but this time not so good as you might
wish. It has all the standard features you'd expect; browsing
directories, viewing images, starting programs and so on from the
program. Installation comes as handy as you'd expect, no cumbersome
installation scripts or anything. The manual is quite extensive and
covers all areas you can wish for, it's well structured and short
enough so you don't fall asleep while reading it.

Fiddling about with the prefs is a quite easy task, so not much to
mention about that. What differs this program from other programs of
this sort is that it creates thumbnails of pictures in the startbar.
Otherwise than that there isn't really much about it that appeals to
me; the thumbnail creating part is by the way quite slow on 68K, so
maybe you'd get more use from this program by having a PPC board than
I had. You can however turn off the thumbnailing feature, but then it
seems like it's just another Windoze start button program, and that
makes it quite uninteresting to use.
