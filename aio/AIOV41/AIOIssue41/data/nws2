Vision Factory Development ({link http://www.vgr.com/}http://www.vgr.com{end}) have posted some new
information on the planned PCI expansion for the PowerPC accelerators from DCE
({link http://www.dcecom.de/}http://www.dcecom.de{end}).  The board, designed to compete with ElBox's
Mediator, is said to feature 5 PCI slots and will come with drivers for
graphics cards based on ViRGE, Permedia2, Voodoo3 2000 and 3000.  Also
included will be generic Ethernet card drivers.  Planned additions to this
include drivers for SCSI cards, TV tuners and SoundBlaster compatible sound
cards.  Reportedly the G-Rex will cost around 400DM.
