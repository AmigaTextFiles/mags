Kill The Little Dudes. The title was a bit tempting. Even though the
game is in the platform section of the Aminet the title conjures up
images of cute, furry, fluffy bunny type creatures getting blasted by
some crazed bloke with a big gun. Nice. I downloaded it sharpish.

Programmed in Amos Professional Kill The Little Dudes (KTLD for
short) is quite a polished game. The programmer, Craig Burlock, has
combined the classic platform shooter with an addictive collect all
the gems and created a fairly playable game.

When the game is loaded you're faced with a screen with the usual
platforms and ladders you'd expect, but roaming these platforms are
some of the ugliest monsters I've seen. This game should be called
Kill The Ugly Dudes! Where are the fluffy bunnies and cute little
creatures I was looking forward to?

The basic object of this game is to collect all the gems whilst
killing or avoiding the monsters and move on to the next level.
Unfortunately the monsters reappear just a couple of seconds after
they've been killed. There are several monsters in the game and they
each vary in their actions. It takes a bit of thought before you set
off on the level just to check it out and plan your route. Just check
out the docs to see what the game is about and what each monster
does.

There are also bonus levels that are very useful for the extra life
and healing you can get.

Sound wise this game has little to offer, shooting, explosions and
gem collecting noises but, as is mentioned in the docs, you can play
your own CDs. The graphics are very good and put me in mind of a game
I can't remember at the moment (e-mail your answers to
barry@aio.co.uk). All in all I liked this game and found myself
completing just one more level all the time.
