Hi,
{p} {p}
Here's a real brain teaser for you.
{p} {p}
I've had an Commodore Amiga A1200 now for about 6 years and every time I have switched the
display to NTSC, either by the early boot menu or by the screenmode prefs via workbench, the 
mouse pointer is not visible although I can still use it (with great difficulty).
{p} {p}
I have always thought that this was the norm with NTSC screens as I've always had this problem 
but the other week I was around a mates place using his A1200 and I switched to an NTSC mode 
and to my surprise the mouse pointer remained visible, what's going on with my system.
{p} {p}
Cheers.

This one sounds a bit too low-level for me to think of anything very specific. I assume the pointer
disappears at the ECS menu as well. If so, you have a dodgy A1200 (obviously). If the pointer 
*does* work, then it's a nasty patch you've got running, or some crazy pointer prefs setup. If you
use NTSC mode a lot for some reason, you could try changing it to NTSC mode permanently via
some solder pads on the motherboard (The position of these solder pads vary between different 
revisions), so that if you need to use PAL, you would have to select it in the ECS menu like you
do for NTSC now. I've got a feeling that this may not help, however... something horrible and 
nasty has gone wrong with your computer!

Perhaps, as a workaround, you could try different pointer sprites in workbench. Try making a big
blob using all the possible colours, and see if you can see anything move around the screen. Does
this problem persist in multiscan/DblNTSC modes? If it really is a hardware problem, then I would
have thought that most NTSC games that use sprites would have troubles as well. Usually, one 
can avoid NTSC screens though.. perhaps you will have to live with it!

Sorry, I can't think of anything else. Perhaps there is a A1200 guru out there that knows what's
going on.
