Well, it's survey time.  I thought with the holidays approaching and all 
the new things coming out, it was about time to see what the Amiga 
Community thought of the recent efforts of the mothetr company.  With 
that in mind, you will find an ascii file in the root direction of this 
issue (AIOIssue41/survey).  Just put your answers into an email (Give
the question numbers next your each of your answers), and send it off 
to:{p}
survey@aio.co.uk

We'll publish the results in a future issue.
