Continuing in the Application Launcher sphere of the Amiga universe,
I find this little program floating about in the ever expanding realm
of the Aminet. Workbench 2000. If you are familiar with the Windows
system this should get the hang of it.
{p} {p}
It is very much like the start bar on Windows, this is also noticable
in it's slowness, (strangely enough the extreme similarity to Windows
task bar is described as a feature! Hmm, I remain sceptic whether
that is a feature or a flaw ;). Seriously speaking, though, I
actually like this program most of the clones available for these
sort of programs. I am however not so impressed with it so I would
stop using the start button that's inbuilt in DOpus, there simply is
no comparison to it (even if WB2000 is close)! It has quite a few
features I miss in other similar programs, such as a place on the bar
where you can place other apps for direct launching. You can also
access the entire HD with this program.
{p} {p}
However, I do miss a few features, such as a manual (!), there's only
a little read me that consists mostly of history notes; ability to
close windows and programs that shows up on the bar from within the
program, dragging the bar down so it doesn't show up on screen until
you put the mouse over it (like you can do on the Windoze version),
otherwise there's nothing I can complain about with this program,
it's pretty neat if you like these types of applications. There are
also some basic file managment features, such as copying and moving,
etc.
{p} {p}
The prefs are extremely easy and comfortable to use. There is even a
preview window available for when choosing the images you want for
drawers or programs, the pictures WB2000 use ordinary icons, so if
you simply can't stand the supplied ones of Windoze folders,
programs, etc., you can exchange them for any else you want.
{p} {p}
The installation is painless as you only have to unpack the archive
and copy the drawer where-ever you want to on the hard disk (as it
always should be).
