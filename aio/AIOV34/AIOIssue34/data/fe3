Well, Spring is here, or thereabouts, and with it an ecclectic
assortment of web sites, including one theme site.  So, without further
ado, let's get into it...
{p} {p}
Farscape.com{p}

{p} {p}
If you're a fan of the cinematic treat that is the television series
Farscape, then this is the fan site to go to. Images from the seires
good enough for backdrops, an episode list (though as yet incomplete),
bios of the cast of characters, and news and links related to the
series, it is quite a visual appeal. The only flaw is the cCast pages
use Javascript just for the soul purpose of going to the link and
opening up a new window (I don't think they know this can be done
WITHOUT javascript), but that can be easily overcome by an inventive
net-browser.

The Darkside Of The Scooby Gang{p}

Sick and tired of Scooby Do? Want something different? Well, here it
is. Have a look at the EVIL Scooby Gang, complete with drawings,
profiles for each, their goals, even mode of transport. The only member
of the Nega Scooby Gang exactly like for the original is Scrappy Do,
because he's actually a double agent (you just KNEW a pup that annoying
would HAVE to be evil).

Everything the modern day Wiccan needs to log into the local community,
join a circle or 12-step pagan program, a pagan song or two, psychic
job opportunities, or just general Wiccan news stuff.

Looking for a place to spend your Spring break/vacation? Well, how's
about a tropical island? From Jamaica to Cancun, there's student
packages ready to leave the first week or two of spring. Or, you could
just browse the site for the bikini-clad beach pictures.

SETI Institute Online{p}

{p} {p}
Life, it's out there but we just don't know where. That's where SETI
comnes in. The world famous institute has a web site to keep everyone
updated on their activities and the search for life out there.
{p} {p}
First, there's their various projects, and they have more then just the
standard radio telescope stuff. Project Phoenix, the proposed 1 Hectare
telescope, and something on Exobiology are just a few of the things they
have going. You also get updates on other related science projects
happening in the world such as investigations into meteor storms and
proposed mars rovers. You can even learn how to help out with the search
for alien life on your own home computer with Seti@home.
{p} {p}
Educators will find curriculum materials they can use for their
students, complete with educational materials available in the gift
shop. There's also a calendar listing available workships, magazine
articles, books, and special events.
{p} {p}
Wrap this up with the SETIcam view of their offices, newsletter and
membership donations, and a tax deductible gift shop, and you'll have
everything you need to keep up to date on the search for
extraterrestrial life.
{p} {p}
Except, of course, the live alien- but that sounds more like a
conspiracy theory and an entirely different web site.
