Well, I was digging around in my older files and found something that I
still see people asking about in mailing lists. What do those
boot-screen colors mean when you see them flashing across your monitor
instead of your workbench screen. So, for the benefit of those that have
lost track of these things and wouldn'tmind having a copy floating around,
I present the Amiga's initialization codes.

Light gray    Ok Software{p}
White         All tests passed{p}
Red           Bad ROM Checksum{p}
Green         Bad RAM{p}
Blue          Bad Custom Chips{p}
Yellow        Exception (software error that the Guru error trapping
software missed){p}

The Keyboard also has an initialization procedure to test it's own
processor, RAM, and ROM. If everything is okay then it'll handshake
wirth the computer and continue on with bootup. If not, it flashes the
capslock light a number of times depending on the error encountered:{p}
