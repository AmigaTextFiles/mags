Amiga Inc is going to be having a Developer's Conference, in the first
positive move since before the Gateway Days. If you're a developer and
would like to attend, then there is a form at
{link http://www.amiga-stl.com/DevForm.htm}http://www.amiga-stl.com/DevForm.html{end}
for you to fill out. If approved then you are a bonified developer and can attend.
It will be at Amiga 2K on Friday March 31 and run through Sunday. More
information at the link.
