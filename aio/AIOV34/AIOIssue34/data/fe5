Just a quick announcement. To quote: " The Comprehensive Amiga Healthcare
provider has finished most of its remodeling and is ready for business.
If you have issues with your amiga, take a look and see if they have
the solution to your problem."

I've taken a look at the site and it appears to be quite a comprehensive
site for any Amiga problem, hardware or software. I'll probably look it
over in a future Web article but for now it looks like a pretty good
site to use. So try it out at http://www.amiga-clinic.com.
