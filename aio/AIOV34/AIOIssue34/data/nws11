AROS, the Amiga Research Operating System, is always looking for more
programmers to join the team. The goal of AROS is build a portable Amiga
OS to ensure the platform's life no matter what Amiga Inc decide to do.

AROS is being completed quickly - many Amiga programs are already
compilable on it. Already running are Quake, Doom, MAME and many sources
from AmiNet.
