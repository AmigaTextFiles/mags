Well gee, here I am. I woke up one morning, volunteered to become
Articles Editor, then noon rolled around and here I am. Bit of a fast
ride, I just hope I can fill Chris' shoes (you {bold}do{nobold} wear
size 10, right?).
{p} {p}
Chris has decided to leave his position in favor of a prolonged
sabatical and a much-needed break. He created an online magazine of
superior quality that has circulated the Amiga Comunity the world over
and has now put it into my sweating hands. I only hope that I can live
up to his expectations and the Community's needs.
{p} {p}
Chris, you were the best editor I ever worked under (okay, so the only
one, but that's beside the point), and we will all miss you. So, from
the entire staff at AIO here's a wish for good luck in your future
endeavors and success in whatever comes next.  Good luck Chris and don't
be aa stranger.
{p} {p}
Now to answer the question on everyone's lips; what does the future of
AIO bring?  That, as they say, is up to you, the Reader, where the power
has always belonged. Want to see any changes in the GUI? Then just tell
us; maybe a colored backdrop instead of plain white beneath the text, or
some whiz-bang button thingy. Want to see some new columns then tell us
your idea, or better yet if you think you can write a regular column
that might interest some people out there then feel free to email us and
perhaps you'll end up with your name in the next issue.
{p} {p}
Like all things Amiga, the future is in your hands. We'll try our best
here at AIO to fill your needs and maintian the legacy left us by Chris
Seward.
{p} {p}
Until next month.
