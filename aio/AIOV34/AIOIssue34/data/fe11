Last issue I asked if anyone had any messages that they wanted
to post about me leaving then they should send them in. Below
you can read what some readers had to say.

Don't worry, I'll still be around helping on AIO and in other
Amiga causes, just now all the hard work is done by the saint
Mark Tierno! Thank-you!

Bye Chris, and thanks for all GREAT issues over the year!! Don't
understand why you have to leave and how things in the issues are
going to change if you leave.

I wish to welcome the new editor Mark as well. Good luck with further
issues of AIO.
