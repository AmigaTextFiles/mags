AmiTradeCenter (ATC) is a FTP client for the Amiga, some says it's the best, some
says it just crashes, but I say, it's just a BETA! :) (ATC 1.1 pre 2 just came out
yesterday!)
{p} {p}
The installation is done with a standard installerscript, although this one isn't
so good from perspective, after you have choosed the dir, it will copy all the files,
it won't ask you anything (and yes, I use expert mode)... Before it finishes it asks
about a MUI mcc, but that's all... Noot good!
{p} {p}
When started, it will present you with a MUI interface. The top of it consists of
four different tabs, Server (where you enter the selected servers details),
advanced (with some advanced settings), transfer (where you set transfer related
settings) and Stats (some very nice statistics :) )...
{p} {p}
Beneath those, you will see the list of all servers, in a tree type.
{p} {p}
And at the very bottom, you will see some buttons (Connect, Add/Copy/Remove Server,
Add group, etc...
{p} {p}
It doesn't seem to be perfect yet, ie, sometimes it fails to work under certain
circumstances (very rare), and that is being fixed as we speak.
{p} {p}
Well, it can otherwise do all the things a FTP client normally can, and more...
One nice thing, is that it has ADT support, ie, support for checking Aminet updates.
{p} {p}
And if you ever get tired of those long downloads of 25MB on a modem, well, just
start the built-in Tetris game... (This has NOTHING to do in a FTP client if you
ask me, there are numerous of dedicated Tetris games, so why??)
{p} {p}
ATC is localized (as most other programs on the Amiga nowadays, nice), but it only
comes with a german catalog (english built-in)...
{p} {p}
The documentation has a very nice layout, but that's pretty much all I can say about
it, because it's in german language only :(
It also comes in text form, good for printing that foreign language I guess :)

ATC is: FreeWare
