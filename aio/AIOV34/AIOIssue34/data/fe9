One of the first problems was in the area of Real Estate, we
currently are in 600 feet with us bulging out the walls, and being
located outside of a car wash has its benefits, but it is still
rather annoying with all of the car stereos going at the same time
outside your front door. We are in the process of moving to our new
world headquarters in Snoqualmie, Washington.  The new address will
be:
{p} {p}
Amiga Incorporated{p}
34935 SE Douglas Street{p}
Suite 210{p}
Snoqualmie, WA  98065{p}
USA{p}
Telephone number  +001 425.396.5660{p}
Facsimile number +001 425.396.6551
{p} {p}
We officially open the doors and are up and running on March 15th,
2000. However we will begin moving equipment, phones, servers, etc
on Monday March 13th, 2000.  This means that it may be more difficult
to get in touch with over the next few days.  We apologize in advance
for any hardship this may cause.

{p} {p}
This is one of the number one items on the list, and the largest
number of comments that we receive from the community. 
{p} {p}
We have been in process building a new web site for some weeks.  The
difficulty has been server location and time.  We have now addressed
both of these issues and we plan to have a new site up in the next
couple of weeks.
{p} {p}
A web site is a constant work in progress, so we look forward to your
comments, and will continue to try and enhance the experience.

This letter does not cover all of the activities that are and
continue to take place.  There is so much more happening that I could
spend days writing and still not keep up with it all.
{p} {p}
We are extremely busy here, and could not be having more fun.  The
company and the people who have contacted us to support what we are
doing have been in many cases overwhelming.  We have several more
partnerships that we are going to be announcing in St. Louis, and we
hope to see as many of you there as possible.

I recently asked a long time Amigan, and a member of the select team
that worked with Jay directly the reason that Jay started this
venture.  I have heard many ideas as to what Jay {bold}really{nobold} wanted to
do, and many e-mails inform me that they know what Jay had planned
all along.  While I never had the chance of either meeting, or
speaking with Jay I thought I would ask.
{p} {p}
Simply stated Jay wanted to build the greatest home computing
experience ever, for under 500.00. I can tell you that his dream
still lives with every member of this company, and we will deliver on
his dream.
{p} {p}
I thank each and every one of you for your continued support, and
look forward to the future.
{p} {p}
Keeping the faith,
{p} {p}
Bill McEwen, and the rest of the Amiga team{p}
