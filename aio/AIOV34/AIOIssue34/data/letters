i beg you please help me !!{p}
i need to find out either the name of this game or find the game itself,
the only problem is that i cant remember what it is called, personally
I've never played it before but my brother has and he wont stop hassling
me to find it, so im passing the buck onto you guys!!, ha ha ha im free
I'm free  !!!!!.....get a grip,{p}
Any way the game is a fully renderd version of 3d tank that shot bouncing
fire balls at little spaceships that poped out of the ground wich also fired
fire balls at you, and there was a radar in the middle of the playing field in
which you had to fight for your life, the object of the game was to shoot
as many of the little silver ships as possable and then at the end there was
a double ended cone that had a doughnut in the middle of it wich shot the
hell out of you with fire balls.{p}
The game (He thinks) was released just after the Amiga 500 was
released.{p}
My brother remembers that a mate of his at the time had just bought an
Amiga 500, after a few months one of his mates had broght round a pile
of games from a games shop that he worked in at the time and gave him
the game that i am trying to find out about now.{p}
We think that the game might of been deleted about 4 maybe 5 years ago,
I'm not 100% about that though?, anyway i would be most greatfull if you
could shed any light on this as it is driving me nutts (Very Very Very
BIG understatement).{p}

Well this is a sad day for all of us! Anyone who keeps an eye out on
the usual Amiga sites won't fail to notice the letter to the Amiga
community from Ben Vost. Amiga Format is closing. For me, I've been
with the mag since at least 1992, it's come as a terrific blow. I
can't help but think the worst. I will be subscribing to AmigActive
but it's possibly too little too late. I urge all of you to do the
same cos this is the last magazine we have. I'm not including Clubbed
(by SEAL) or Amiga Survivor, both of which are brilliant magazines
but they don't have the financial clout. Anyway I'll sign off now cos
I'm going to dig out all my old mags and reminisce.

Greetings all,
{p} {p}
I have aquired an Amiga 2000 with the Video Toaster to manipulate the
cameras and lyrics display in our church.{p}
For ease of use, I want to replace the mouse with a trackball. I have tried
a PC serial trackball, but it does not work.{p}
Someone told me that it needs to be rewired to work on the Amiga, but nobody
seems to know which pins need to go where.{p}
I have searched the internet; but am unable to find a schematic for the
Amiga mouse, or which pins to swap on a standard PC serial mouse to make it
work.
{p} {p}
I hope someone here has this information and can fill me in.
{p} {p}
May God bless the one that helps his servant.

Thank you,{p}

{italic}Editor's reply:  Software Hut carries the Topolino which I know
to work quite well with my own Logitek trackball.  There is also a new
product called MROOCHECK which supports wheel mice.{noitalic}
