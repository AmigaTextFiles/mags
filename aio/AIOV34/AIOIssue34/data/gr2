{subhead} Ali Baba{def}{p}
Review by Hugo Wilkinson

{p} {p}
The story so far; Ali Baba has took it upon himself to find the caves
of the nutorious Forty Thieves. He has awaited a time whereby the
thieves are out on their next launder, and that time has come...
{p} {p}
This is where you step into Ali's shoes and help him through the many
terrains, with only your trusty sword for guidance and defense!
{p} {p}
You control Ali Baba primarily with the joystick, with the usual
directions obtaining the usual results for a platform game. You ponder
through the 2D worlds slashing at enemy's and collecting the 10 latterns
from each world to enter the Forty Thieves caves. Once you enter one
cave, you have to battle through another world to enter the next depest
cave and so on.
{p} {p}
During your travels, you can pick up 'tokens' which allow you to buy
from the choice of three things; Extra Lives, Shield strength and a
lantern.
{p} {p}
Obviously the extra life gives you just that. The shield strength
however is merely an indicator of how torn your groovy waistcoat is (as
there are no 'futuristic' shields to talk of. Buying a lantern saves you
the harassment of having to find that last one, and (on some occasions),
beating off a nasty 'big boss' type character to get it.
{p} {p}
And that is bassically the game until you reach the inner most cave and
presumably find the treasures. Sadly I didn't get that far, even though
I had the help of a 'reviewers' cheat to skip to the next level even if
you didn't have all the lanterns. Sadly, I got to the third level and
was unable to find the cave - which, by the way, indicates the sheer
depth of each level. Even on my last go, I found new parts to the first
world I had neve been to before..
{p} {p}
The graphics to the game are well drawn. They are clear, well coloured
considering the palette, and you have many types of beasties to
confront. The different levels have varied terrains which is a pleasant
surprise and the animation of all characters is also very good. The only
part of the graphics I would have to complain about is the LOADING/TITLE
screen. It would appear that only half the effort has been put into it
in respect with the rest of the game.
{p} {p}
If you've been waiting for a flaw, then lo-and-behold, its the sound!
Or, the lack of it really. The LOADING screen is accompanied by a nifty
sound track, which has the relevant theme to it for the game. However,
upon starting the game, your main sound is the footsteps of your
character as you run around - which is later accompanied by the swish of
your sword and the groaning noise some of the nastier beasties make when
you hit them for everthing you've got. I really feel that if there had
been some music to accompany each of the levels then the whole game
would be ALOT more enjoyable to play. Whether or not this lack of music
destroys the theme of the game is up to you, but I personally felt it
was not as mind consuming with only the graphical sensory input.
{p} {p}
The last little complain is the apparently randomizes occurances of
graphics corruption. Sometimes a lantern is placed in an un-reachable
place, sometimes barrels full of tokens follow you around for a while
after you break them with your sword and a few other similar problems.
This may be a problem suffered only by me with an A1200T/PPC/040. But I
would be surprised if it was.
{p} {p}
On a last note the game is enjoyable and is one I am sure a few would
been more than keen to complete. Sure, there's not much sound, and the
collision detection is a little annoying sometimes, but the depth of the
game coupled with the more than adequate graphics make for some fun
times on those lonely sunday afternoons.
