New Hard Drives and Directory Cache:
Most of you may already know that double-cachine is a bad thing. Run one
directory cache program like the old Dynamicache and watch it pump heads
violently with any hard drive formatted with Directory Cache on.  But,
there's something else to watch out for as well.

Most new hard drives now come with built-in cache, and from personal
experience I can now tell you that this hardware derrived cache operates
the same way as any software one. Try and format a hard drive that has
built-in cache with the Directory Cache option on and you're into a world
of trouble trying to kep both partitions and formatting to stick.

Of course, modern hard drives are fast enough that Directory Cache is no
longer needed. Directory Cache is out-dated and should be avoided.

The other thing I found out regards emulators. It seems that PC-Task is
rather unsteady at large partions, giving values on the PC side from
fdisk that shows the hard drive partition being used is about one-fifth
the size it actually is. Also, it refuses to format any hard-file
larger then 262K bytes. Rather severe limitations given today's large
amounts of hard drivce space.

I've also noticed Shapeshifter sometimes breaks partition boundaries
when formating larger partitions (1GB or so), at least when Directory
Cache is involved. The one recommendation I can make is if you have
access to a Jazz drive or similar then use that as your hard disk for
this and any major emulator. It's safer.
