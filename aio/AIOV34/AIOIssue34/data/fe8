{p} {p}
There are many new people at Amiga, and we are excited about the team
that we are continuing to build.  Below you will find some specific
detail on certain team members, here you will find the names and
descriptions of the folks that I get to work the most closely with.
{p} {p}
{center}{bold}Randall P. Hughes,  VP Sales and Strategic Business Development{nobold}
{left}
{p} {p}
Randy comes to us after being the VP of Sales at a very exciting Java
technologies company ThinWeb.  Randy and I worked together when he
was my primary contact at QNX. He is a very skilled person with
backgrounds in Banking, and technology.  Randy understands the Amiga,
and what the future brings. He has had business dealings with some
of the strongest technology companies in the world.  He was the
person that QNX selected to open their first office in California. I
know that you will enjoy meeting him in St. Louis. Now the official
comments that will be going up on the web site later;
{p} {p}
Mr Hughes comes to Amiga directly from a Java based start up where he
headed the sales and alliances function from inception to its filing
for IPO on the NASDAQ exchange.
{p} {p}
Randy was initiated to the Amiga community as the lead manager
responsible for the relationship with Amiga during his tenure at QNX
where he headed the expansion to Silicon Valley and into Southern
California. Randy was first and foremost a financier from his days at
notable Canadian financial institutions, namely the Bank of Montreal
and Royal Bank.
{p} {p}
Randy was educated at the University of Ottawa, Canada and at
Marlborough College in England.

{center}{bold}Vincent P. Pfeifer, VP of Operations{nobold}
{left}
{p} {p}
Vince and I worked together for several years at ConnectSoft. Vince
has an incredible ability to deliver products. I have seen him time
and again walk into extremely difficult situations with very hard
headed engineers and stupid marketing people, and deliver amazing
products. I am very pleased that he has agreed to join us. Here is
his official web site description;
{p} {p}
Vince Pfeifer has 14 years experience in the computer industry with
the last 12 spent in the software area.  Vince joins us from GraphOn
Corporation where, as Vice President of Product Development and
General Manager of GraphOn's Seattle based operations, he oversaw all
Engineering resources for GraphOn's multiple development sites. 
During his tenure at GraphOn, sales tripled while product offerings
doubled.  Additionally, Vince helped oversee the merger that made
GraphOn a publicly traded company whose Market Capitalization
quadrupled in under a year.
{p} {p}
Vince has hands-on experience building and managing software
development operations as well as product management organizations. 
Vince has experience with both startup organizations (ConnectSoft,
Exodus Technologies, GraphOn) as well as more established companies
(Symantec).

{bold}Why I joined Amiga, by Vincent P. Pfeifer{nobold}{p}
Other than the belief that Bill McEwen could sell ice cubes to
Eskimos, I joined Amiga to take on the challenge of turning a
company's name and image that has become somewhat dated here in the
United States into a top level, respected company in the computer
industry. As I am coming off a successful venture in helping turn
GraphOn into a publicly traded company with record revenues from the
position of Vice President of Product Development, I was ready for a
new set of responsibilities in more areas than Product Management and
Engineering.
{p} {p}
Amiga offers a challenge that I look forward to: build a company from
the bottom up with the benefit of having name recognition and some
technology already in place.
{p} {p}
It is an opportunity to do something that I have wanted to do since
my early days at 5th Generation when I sat on the Tech Support phones
and listened to average users try to use relatively complicated
software. I know that it sounds like a religious crusade, but I want
to make computers easier for the masses, and with my position at
Amiga, I have an opportunity to help influence that vision
significantly.
{p} {p}
{center}{bold}Gary Peake, Director of Developer Relations and Support{nobold}
{left}
{p} {p}
My favorite man from Texas.  Gary has already put thousands of hours
of his life to support the Amiga, and the community worldwide.   Now
he has joined our team in delivering his years of experience and
affection for the Amiga in supporting the efforts of the Amiga
community.
{p} {p}
{center}{bold}Tarah Mallo, Reception and Office{nobold}
{left}
{p} {p}
Tarah is our first line of communication to the outside world.  She
has been working with the development team gathering information and
support.  As well as helping me to get organized. I will state for
the record that the pictures of the original office were taken
{bold}before{nobold} she joined. Say hello to Tarah the next time you call
{p} {p}
{center}{bold}Kari Erickson, Executive Administration{nobold}
{left}
{p} {p}
Kari is the person who will keep my life and travel plans in order. 
She is who you will get to speak to first before getting me, or any
other member of the executive team.  Kari joins us after leaving one
of the very prestigious law firms here in the Seattle area, and I am
sure that you can already feel her pain in having to deal with me on
a day to day basis.
{p} {p}
{center}{bold}Susan Sutton, Director of Finance and Human Resources{nobold}
{left}
{p} {p}
Susan is going to take over the collection of funds, and the paying
of bills. She is also the person who gets to deal with all of the
employee complaints about Fleecy. Just kidding there are more
complaints about me, than there are Fleecy.
{p} {p}
{center}{bold}Gordon Stone, Director of Information Services and Information Technologies{nobold}
{left}
{p} {p}
We refer to Gordon as the network man. Gordon got his start in
computing by upgrading Amiga memory for recording studios in Oregon. 
He has since moved onto operating numerous systems, and is versed in
all that is connectivity. Gordon actually will start in two weeks,
but we wanted to introduce him now.

and then spent the next 15 years designing and producing all manner
of add ons, expansion cards and accelerators for the whole range of
Amiga computers. He brings a deep understanding of the spirit and
reality of the Amiga hardware, along with an almost encyclopedic
knowledge of current and future projects. He will use this to help
Amiga and its partners create multiple hardware platforms for the
future.

Dave Taylor - Dave is another scouser, from Liverpool, UK, although
he supports the wrong football team. He has spent the last ten years
designing and implementing distributed manufacturing, control, and
eCommerce systems for small, medium, and large companies across the
globe, on Mainframe, Unix and Windows architectures. The last 3 years
have seen him concentrating on distributed systems, databases, and n
tier commercial systems. He brings commercial world experience,
eCommerce expertise and formal methods with a refreshing new look on
architecture to the company, and was also brave enough to try
snowboarding with Wouter and myself.
{p} {p}
Wouter van Oortmerssen - Wouter is a tall, dutch, quake master
currently completing his doctorate at Southampton University. He has
been an Amigan since the early 1990's and is most well known for the
excellent Amiga E language and compiler that grew from a research
project into a professional system. He is bringing a fresh look at
language, conversation and interaction in the new Amiverse.
{p} {p}
Andreas Kleinert - Andreas has worked for the last few years
producing public domain, shareware, and commercial applications for
the Amiga, PC and UNIX markets. For the Amiga market, Andreas
concentrated on various graphics and datatype systems before taking
up the challenge of lead developer for the SuperBase database product
line. His deep knowledge of data storage, retrieval and indexing is
core to creating a self describing and multi dimensional amiverse.
{p} {p}
Trond Werner Hansen - Some people are leg men, others are face men.
Trond is most definitely a face man - INTERFACE man 8-) Over the last
seven years he has moved from small programs to enhance workbench,
through completely reimplementing layers.library as SuperLayers, to
developing a NG Amiga workbench system. With configurability and
simplicity being central features for the Amiverse, Trond will be
helping to redefine presentation and participation in digital worlds.
