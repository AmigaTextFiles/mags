A new version of the Toolbar class for MUI was announced recently on the
TUMULT service. TUMULT, http://www.amiga.dk/tumult/, is a service for Amiga
programmers interested in getting the most out of MUI by using third party

This release is mainly interesting for programmers, because of some new
useful attributes. Normal users do not need to download this release now.
They can wait until a programmer actually uses the new features.
