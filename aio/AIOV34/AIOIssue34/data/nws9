While this may have been inevitable from the ever decreasing circulation,
it still shocks to think that after so many years Amiga Format has finally
set a date for the last issue.
{p} {p}
As Ben Vost, editor, explains:
{p} {p}
"It's been a very sad month for me. Since I found out that AF was to close,
I've had nothing but sleepless nights and now you've all found out in the
worst way possible, when I thought I should be the one breaking the
terrible news. Future's policy was to keep silent until the issue had
finally gone to press, but now there seems little point, and in a way, I'm
glad - there was nothing worse than me having to prevaricate about
subscriptions or future plans for Amiga Format.
{p} {p}
The closure of Amiga Format means the end of an era for me. For thirteen
years (pretty much my whole working life) I've been involved with the
Amiga market in some capacity, whether that be in sales, distribution,
freelance consultant and writer, or journalist and editor on Amiga
Computing or Amiga Format. All this time I've been at the heart of the
Amiga market and I've met and got to know some fantastic people, not least
of whom are my readers. I've used some fantastic software and seen
hardware dreams come and go. I've probably spent in excess of ten grand
feeding my obsession and will carry on using the equipment I have at home
for a long time to come. As for what I will be doing, you have no cause to
fear on my or Richard's behalf: Rich has a job on Linux Format as a staff
writer, working with erstwhile Amiga Format editor Nick Veitch. As for me,
I hope you'll look favourably on Future's new launch - 3D World - where
I'll be deputy editor and the editor of its website. 3D World will be
aimed at professional 3D artists and those looking to get into that
market, whatever the platform. I will be honest and say that although the
only important criterion for inclusion in 3D World is image quality, the
speed at which those images need to be rendered, and the quality of the
support software, means that I don't think there'll be much, if any, Amiga
coverage and that saddens me too.

For those of you who are subscribers, there's no cause for alarm. We
aren't a fly-by-night company that will let you down when it comes to
dealing with your subscription. All subscribers will get a letter shortly
- included with your final subscription issue, that will explain all the
options.
{p} {p}
As far as any future reincarnation of Amiga Format goes, I am not yet
personally convinced that Bill and Fleecy will be able to achieve all they
want to, but if they do succeed I'm sure that Future Publishing will be
one of the first publishers back into a new thriving Amiga market, and you
can bet I'd want to be back. As such, although my new job will probably
take me into the world of PCs and workstations, you can be sure I'll keep
an eye on what's going on here and I've promised Bill McEwen I would
remain part of the AAC in order to be better able to tell him where I
think he's going wrong. :)
{p} {p}
In the meantime, I don't think that the Amiga market has died, I just know
it's got to the stage where Future Publishing can't sustain Amiga Format.
At the end of the day, the only reasons for this are an increasing
unprofessionalism in the marketplace and a lack of people willing to part
with their money. There are plenty of good dealers out there that have
their customers interests at heart and it's up to you to make sure that
their level of service and support don't go the way of Amiga Format.
{p} {p}
Just remember, there's still an issue on the shelves right now that
contains all sorts of fantastic info (and Personal Paint 7.1b on the CD)
and our next issue on sale, our last, will be well worth buying since it
will contain a dissection of the Amiga market as the freelancers and staff
on AF see it and a history of AF.
{p} {p}
On a personal note, it's not so easy to convey emotion while writing an
email. Suffice to say that this page would be wet if it were a letter I
was sending to you all."
