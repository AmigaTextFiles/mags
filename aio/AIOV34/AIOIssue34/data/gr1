Waverun is a game loosely based around the style of WipEout on
the Playstation and well, now on the Amiga.
{p} {p}
If you've never seen WipEout before then it is a type of
futuristic racing game with flying ships instead of cars which
hover and fly around a circuit very similar to any racing
game you will have ever played. Basically think of it as a racing
game with spaceships and you should have a better idea of what
I'm talking about.
{p} {p}
As you may know or if you don't know then WipEout was quite
a heavy graphical game and of course like WipEout on the Amiga
you would need a pretty built up system to be able to play the
game. Waverun is like a cut down version with basic 2d style
graphics and.. well... like a cheap alternitave.
{p} {p}
The idea is exactly the same as WipEout or any racing game. You
control your ship and have to fly faster and harder than the other
two ships which start either side of you. As there are no laws
in the future you can bash or shoot at the other players,
although I didn't notice much happening after shooting at the
computer controlled players for a while.
{p} {p}
The game in its current form is very PD or shareware in style
but the gameplay is actually pretty decent and the graphics
aren't too bad for free.
{p} {p}
As far as I can tell there are two different circuits in the game
which take place on different made-up planets which are different
in colour. The game title is in English but while playing the game
you get text from the other ships when you are near them but like
the author these are in spanish so I couldn't understand what they
where meant to be saying, although this doesn't effect the game
or stop you playing it in anyway.
{p} {p}
The floor of the racing tracks are littered with speed up patches
that when flown over make your ship go faster for a limited period
of time.
{p} {p}
Overall Waverun is a nice game with some good effects, it could do
with improving slightly as sometimes the updating of the track
is jerky and you can get a bit confused, other than that a pretty
good game that you should check out if you like this genre.
