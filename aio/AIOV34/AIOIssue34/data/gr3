This game is an example of the kind of people who kept the Amiga
alive during the 'dark years' - of which I hope we all agree we are just
recovering from.

You are Charly. A handsome little chappy with an unhealthy habit for
shooting people between the eyes. You have recently joined a group of
Mercs called Kalus. You now have to prove that your a 'big cheese' and
are assigned a mission to destroy Elbo-Ludo and his city Balm-azo because
he plans to take over the world and kill everything in it (which the
head of Kalus isn't in favour of).
{p} {p}
You fight your way through 4 worlds with numerous sub-levels in each on
a side view platform envoronment.
{p} {p}
You have a varied number of weapons you can collect on the way and some
are mission particular with one 'secret' weapon which is no doubt very
powerful.
{p} {p}
If you remember and enjoyed the Ruff'N'Tumble game back in 1995/96, then
you will no doubt thoroughly enjoy this too! The game has been 2 years
in the making (albeit breaks were taken) and the graphic capabilities of
the programmer improve throughout the game. The sound effects are
pleasing enough and the character controls are responsive and quick.
{p} {p}
The game engine can be a bit sluggish when there is alot going on, but I
don't know whether that is down to the programmer or the 'backbone'
software he has used to create the game. One shame about the game is
that the music for each level is the same (although catchy).
{p} {p}
While playing the game, you become very satisfied at several things. The
two that really hit me were the excellent collision detection, and the
fact that no matter where you hit a bloke, it always hits him between
the eyes and they collapse in a pool of blood. Its just great fun even
though it isn't very realistic. The other thing that you find
refreshing (but sadly all to un-common in todays games) is the feel of
'I want to try that again', even when you've just died for the 20th time
on the 3rd sub level of world 1!...
{p} {p}
I can only suggest that you download this game and send the author a
little note of thanks.. its not the GREATEST game of all time (i.e.
Ruff'N'Tumble was superior in all fields), but for a FREE piece of
software of this class - it cannot be missed.
