You are likely to have heard of the Amiga company who sell and
supply games to the Amiga community, the company is called Alive
Mediasoft Ltd.
{p} {p}
The company came into the Amiga community mainly through Amiga
Format or CU Amiga after they advertised the fact that it
was a shop that actually sold Amiga games on the shelves here
in Britain which in case you didn't know was rare back then and
now is even more rare.
{p} {p}
Some time passed and this is now one of the more recognised
companies in the Amiga world. After buying a few items from them
you receive a little publication called The Pulse which is now
up to the latest issue, number 11.
{p} {p}
As I have bought a few games I receive this every month, i'm
sure sending it out to every customer is costing them quite
a bit of money but this is not the point.
{p} {p}
Last issue I noticed quite a lot of swearing used in uncalled
for places through-out the magazine, none more than the Final
Word writen by Steven Flowers. Now I'm not one who is really
bothered about swearing but some people are and also the fact
that young children could see the magazine I think it is not the
time or place for swearing.
{p} {p}
I did write a letter to them telling them that I thought if the
magazine was trying to be professional then it should remove the
swearing or at least tone it down. Afterall, the places in which
the language was being used was totally uncalled for and
rediculas.
{p} {p}
In the latest issue I notice Mr. Steven Flowers has mentioned
that a few people have wrote in about the swearing and he goes
on to say;
{p} {p}
"We aim for The Pulse to have an edge about it"
{p} {p}
followed later by...
{p} {p}
"we are by no means attempting to be 'professional' and we will
not pull any punches with our attitude."
{p} {p}
I agree that a magazine or publication should be a freedom of
speech affair which is always something I tried my best to
achieve with AIO but there is a time and place.
{p} {p}
When first running AIO I decided to be a bit more risque than
other magazine but realised if this is fake risk then what is the
point to it? I could have writen things that would get others
backs up or made comments about certain things to seem like we
are out spoken but there is no real point and in the end it
basically comes down to a publicity stunt.
{p} {p}
Overall if swearing is needed then by all means use it but don't
over use it or just add it in for the sake of it. We all have
different writing styles and different ways of making our point
known but when writing please don't use excessive swearing for no
real reason when it makes no improvement to the article and in
fact just acts as a let down and ruins what could be a good
magazine.
{p} {p}
Now I am not claiming to be any kind of expert in the matter but
have had some experience and I have learnt that people don't really
wish to be reading an article riddled with swear words that serve
no purpose and end up being just an article that its main point is
to show that they can swear.
