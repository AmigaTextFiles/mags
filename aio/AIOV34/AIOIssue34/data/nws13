{bold}14.3.2000 BlackIRC 1.1 Freeware Edition released{nobold}
Our company's activities move more and more into the
graphics-area and in development of online-applications
for servers and enterprises. As a result our capacities
for the further development of BlackIRC don't last and we
now release it as Freeware. The integrated BlackNEWS
will be continued by amiga-news.de. At the same time, we
are not able to give you any more support for BlackIRC
as it is now Freeware and support costs money. If a private
person or company is interested in the further development
of BlackIRC, we hand out sourcecode-licences starting at
5000 DEM.

BlackIRC is an IRC-Client for the AMIGA, whose abilities
are unique worlwide. E.g., extras like XDCC, Bots, CTCP-
Flood-Protection, etc. are included by standard in the
client. Even more, BlackIRC is the only IRC-Client on the
AMIGA, that allows you to do videoconferences.
