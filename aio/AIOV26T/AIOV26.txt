                          - ISSUE 26, JULY 1999 -

EDITORIAL BY CHRIS SEWARD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Howdy everyone! A warm welcome to issue 26. Alot has happend this month
at AIO Towers and i'll give you a brief rundown of all the new features
and happenings around the place.

As you will see from the start we have a new icon which has been
designed by Andrew Crowe. Thanks to him and also to Leto Kauler who
also submitted some nice icons but in the end we can only pick one
and I just loved the icon Andrew has done.

The second thing you will have noticed that some of you may be using
right now is that you now have the option to open AIO on its own
public screen with 256 colours. You can of course still open it on your
WB screen for speed but if you want the full effect of AIO showing in
all its 256 colour glory then you can open it on its own screen without
the trouble of changing your WB screen colours.

One of the other new features which I think is very exciting and useful
which I talked briefly about last issue is the new option to click on
the highlighted download button which you will find at the bottom of most
reviewed files. Then you will be asked where you want to download the
file to and the program which is included with the AIO archive called
GetClient by Ray Akey will start to download that file
to the place you selected. This is a great feature so if you are online
you only need to click on the file you want with no need to load up
any FTP program because it will download it all for you.

The last new change you will have seen is that AIO in its archive is
now in its own directory which will make it easy for people who store
each issue on their HD. It should also stop any problems like which
occured on one of the recent AF cover CDs where all one issues contents
where over-written.

This month Amiga announced that it was dropping QNX and replacing it
by Linux for its main kernal. I have heard many remarks about this
being a bad decision but I feel most people have jumped up without
knowing the facts. The idea is you can use Linux as a base but have
the actual graphical OS interface completely programmed anyway you
wish. On the PC you can get WindowsX which is a version of Windows but
to run on Linux. I think alot of people should calm down and wait to
see what is going to happen.

In the end it is Amiga who make the final decision on what direction
the next Amiga takes and they need our support and backing with no stupid
or childish hate or against Amiga campaigns which is really what is
happening. The people who are working at Amiga are professionals and
know what they are doing. In the end they call the final shot so instead
of being against Amiga lets back them 100% and then if they fail you
can always say that you told them so. Please, please, please don't
write them off before they've even had a chance. I know its been a long
time but we need to support them in everyway because it is the only
way the Amiga will be a success.

I have two more pieces of information I want to give you about AIO.
Firstly a few weeks ago the AIO Phone competition line opened and for
you that havn't already heard about it then a prize will be offered
after each issue and the way you enter is by phoning the competition
line and answering the question. The winners will be picked at random
a few days before each new issue is released.

This month we have a 56k modem bundle with headset, speakers and a
whole host of other stuff that comes with it. You will also get STFax
for the Amiga or a PC Fax program depending on what computer you
want to use it with.

The Question is 'Amiga was a codename by the original inventors but
what does it mean?' Once you phone the competition line you will be
given three choices and have to answer the correct one. If you think
you know the answer and live in the UK then phone now,

0906 613 57 50
(Calls cost 60p per min at all times)

The last piece of information is that now you will beable to receive
AIO in a very basic text (.txt) version for those who do not have WB
3.0 or higher. If you want to receive just a text version via email
then contact us at the usual address found in the contact section
each issue.

Don't forget to mail us your letters for next months hot topic debate
which you can see by going to the letters section of the magazine. If
you havn't already voted then also remember to send off your
applications into the PD Toplist section where we will be showing
what your favourite utilites of all time are.

I hope you enjoy this issue as much as we have enjoyed making it. Don't
forget to look out for the new design AIO website which will be online
when http://www.aio.co.uk is back online in the next 2 weeks.

WBPerplexity - Reviewed by Chris Seward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WBPerplexity is a simple WB puzzle game in which you have to rearrange
a picture which has been split into a certain amount of sections. In
the case of this game that amount of sections is 8 with one left
over square in which you can move your 8 pieces in and out of.

I'm sure most of you will know what I'm on about because its a very
simple idea but has been made into an addictive WB game. Those of you
who have been reading AIO for a while will probably know I am a fan of
most WB games that are half good and this one is great!

The idea is you have a picture split into 8 pieces and by moving or
sliding the pieces into and out of the empty spot you can recreate the
whole picture. Very simple idea but it makes for a challenging game and
a very addictive one at that.

This is one of the better WB games I have seen and will take into account
256 colour WB etc. Although I like this game there are some features
missing but some extra features added in. I really like the way you can
just drag and drop any picture as long as it is of required size and
you are then allowed to play with that picture.

[IMAGE ONLY AVAILABLE IN GUI VERSION]

See above I scaled the AIO issue 26 title screen down to 153x153 and
dropped it in the WBPerplexity window where in a few seconds it loads it
in and splits it into 8 sections. Excellent!

Although this is a great feature there are some features lacking that
I would like to see in future versions. Firstly you do get a time and
'how many moves you have taken so far' counter but for these you have
to goto the Puzzle Info screen in the menu. I would have liked to see
an updating timer and moves counter on screen at the same time to keep
tabs without the need to check by going to a menu option. The next small
feature that is missing is that when you load the picture in it doesn't
show you a quick version of what the completed picture should look like.
In 8 sections you can normally tell what is what but on some of the more
harder pictures it could be a problem.

The actual archive you download includes 10 pre-made puzzles for you to
play around with. All can be loaded in easily through a menu option. The
screens that come with it are, Default (E9 Logo), Climber, Gromit,
Jennifer, Prodigy, Snorkeling, Snowman, Sumo, Visions and Wallace. I
did enjoy putting together Jennifer Aniston <Wink>, <Wink>!

Overall this is a really enjoyable game. It has some great features and
gives endless possibility with the option to beable to make your own
puzzles. It does however lack a few options which denies it from receiving
an AIO Gold award. If the author adds a few ideas suggested earlier I'll
be more than happy to review the new version and most likely award it
AIO Gold. Brilliant work!

Look out for some puzzles by me on the aminet in game/data in the next
few weeks.

SameGame - Reviewed by Chris Seward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SameGame was a small file which I noticed on the Aminet and was the
reason why I downloaded it. In an archive of only 7k lays an lovely
game that will entertain most people

At first I thought the game would be terrible because of the size. The
game features many options which you can alter in the tooltypes. Most
of which include where you want the game to open, on the WB, on its
own private screen or on any named public screen. For best viewing I
opened it on the original set in its own private screen as it will
give full colours as shown in the picture at the bottom of the review.

The idea is simple. You have a board full of coloured balls.... waits
as the reader laughs childisly ;) - which you have to match and click
to make them be removed. The game really tells you which balls can
be removed because it will group them with ticks and all you have to
do is click. I played it for quite a long time and none of the time
I couldn't not win.

It seems really easy to me because the computer shows you what you can
and cannot do and by the time you are at the last balls they all seem
to match up anyway so you complete it. The game is really a thinking
mans game because the more balls you remove together the more points
you get and this is how the game works. It is a who can get the higest
score type of game.

Overall its a nice puzzle game for those who like puzzle games. If you
want something small but interesting then download this. The graphics
look great even though basic and the actual downloading time will be
a few seconds due to its size. On the other hand if you don't have the
time to think or won't be bothered then this isn't the game for you.

Wasted Dreams - Reviewed by Neil Williams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This game has been on and off for months now, and at one point looked
like not being published at all, but finally, it's here.  Wasted
Dreams is a sort of strategy, puzzle and action game rolled into one.
Using a method of control similar to that of, say, The Chaos Engine,
you (or you and a friend) control your character on screen, moving from
one area to the next, interacting with characters and items on screen
in a way similar to an adventure game, like Monkey Island 2.  You view
the world of your character from an angle of 45 degrees above, which
is a well used system these days.  Napalm is the most recent game to
use this sort of view point.

There is no getting away from the fact that the game is huge.  In the
course of researching this review ( :-) ) I must have only scratched
the surface of the game.  In that respect, it puts Monkey Island 2,
a mere 12 floppy disks, to shame.  This game fills a CD-ROM!
Everything about the game is done on a big scale, even the
'environment' sounds playing in the background are all fairly big
samples - The only problem I can see people having with this is that
it pushes the game into the 2MB chip RAM area.  While it needs just
3MB in total to run, 2MB of it must be chip RAM.

To control the game, you need to use keyboard or joystick.  I was
originally expecting it to be a mouse driven game, as the control
panel at the bottom of the screen looked fairly typical of an
adventure game.  But I'm glad to say I was wrong, this game includes
far more action than any other adventure game I've played which I'm
sure would be hell with a mouse.  The controls are, overall, quite
good.  The on-screen character responds to movements well, there is
some vagueness about it.  I can't quite pin down what doesn't feel
right, so there can't be anything big wrong with it.

So, to the game's story.  In a plot vaguely like Flashback, you find
yourself on an alien world.  You are part of a survey team, and
having found a new planet, void of higher life, you take off back for
earth.  Then your ship is shot down and you are the only survivor,
apart from a small group still on the planet.  Well, if you're playing
a two player game, there are two survivors, of course.  This is where
you run into the aliens..

The story is fairly short for such a big game, but there is plenty in
the game itself which explains things further as you progress.  Most
characters you meet in the game will just take an instant dislike to
you and try to kill you, but some are a bit more friendly and will
help you along, sometimes if you help them first.  You're armed
initially with a single gun and a body shield, both of which need
recharging regularly as you shoot or are shot..  A downed alien will
often drop these for you, which you can pick up.  This is 60% an
adventure game though, so you can also pick up other items which you
can carry around until they're needed.  For example, (and this isn't
giving the game away, it's the very first thing you do) there is a
medi-kit in the wreckage of your ship.  If you take this to an injured
alien close the crash site, you'll get some advice in return for the
help.

There is plenty to keep you hooked to this game for a very long time,
not just because it's a huge thing to play through, but also because
it actually keeps you interested in what happens next.  The story line
slowly creeps out of the game as you play, presenting you with
mysteries to solve as you go and little bits of information to help
you progress.  Unlike the background story, this is a big, well
thought out story line.  Or so it appears, I haven't completed the
game yet!

Now down to the presentation: the graphics do look okay, and move well,
but the game suffers a bit from being in 32 colours.  While it claims
to take advantage of AGA features (but doesn't take advantage of a
graphics card sadly) it still looks a little 'washed out' - I can't
see it making much difference to the game, but it could have been
nicer to look at I feel.  The variety of graphics in the game is
impressive - but with each area of play having a specific look which
helps stop you getting lost in the vastness of it all..

Sound is fairly good as I've said above -but I didn't mention the
speech. Vulcan have supplied full English speech for every bit of
written text on the screen, which can get annoying but helps you pick
out important stuff you might miss otherwise.. The speech is only in
English though. The actual text, from the manual right through the
game is available in 16 languages! The Amiga Translators Organisation
strikes again, and they should be commended for their work. I should
mention the introduction movie of several hundred megabytes, which
just gives in sound and video the background story of the game. It's
in the same style as the Genetic Species intro, and looks good.

I'm genuinely excited about this game.  Which it's biggest flaw being
low-colour graphics, more than made up for by the shear amount of it,
I am hopeful this game will do well.  It's something everyone can
play through at their own pace without compromising their enjoyment
of the game.

Sharks - Reviewed by Chris Seward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two issues ago in issue 24 I reviewed a game called Sharks by
Christian Steiner. The game on the whole was nice because it offered
a different type of game that I have never seen before. At the
time I said the game was a bit easy because you rarely get killed.

Then a few days ago I received an email from the author with the
keyfile to make the game registered. This has improved the game alot,
you get 3 lives instead of one and on the unregistered version you
can only play two levels.

The registered version can claim alot more action and fun and now
makes the game worth while. So download the game from the Aminet and
register because its a nice game and only costs 10DM or 5$ which is
hardly alot for registering a game. The game can now be made harder
and as your progress through the levels as more and more sharks appear.

You can contact the author of Sharks with questions or if you want
details on how to register by emailing, C-Steiner@t-online.de or
visit his webpage at, http:www.t-online.de/home/C-Steiner

The game has jumped from 63% to 81% so now read the original review

MUIMine - Reviewed by Chris Seward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MUIMine is a WB mine game. We've all played them. The idea is very simple
indeed and has been around for a long time. You have a board with a certain
amount of mines in but every square is covered up. You can either remove
a square which will remove the surrounding sqaures that do no contain a
mine or you can place a flag with the right mouse button if you suspect
a mine is under that square.

When removing the squares that don't contain mines you will get numbers
on some squres to alert you that that amount of mines is near that square.
ie. if the number is 2 then 2 mines are close to that square.

If you manage to put flags on all squares that contain mines you win if
not you will blow up and die.

MUIMine is exactly the same layout and design as the PC mine game that
comes with basically all PCs. The graphics are the same and the game is
mostly the same apart from the fact it is done in MUI and the PC doesn't
have MUI!

Overall its nice and simple, you'll love it or hate it, why not download
it for yourself and make up your own mine (bad joke :)!)

There where some people that voted, but I hoped that it would be more
than 13! So, please just take a minute or two to vote for your three
favourite utilities! Who knows, it might be that YOU find a util that
you never thought could be that handy, and someone else might also find
some new utils! Now please show Your support!

To send Your votes, send a mail to lorens@aio.co.uk with the subject: AIO Toplist

Not many followed this, but I don't mind, it's just that my little
script that proccessed the votes didn't find the votes by itself! :-(

If you vote, you must choose three utilities, you will give 3 points to
the one you like the most, 2 points to the second, and 1 point to the third!

Hope you will enjoy this list, and the next one in the magazine will
probably not show the utilities that only got one vote, the list is
beginning to be too long! But check it out on http://www.aio.co.uk, it will be there soon!

AmTagEd - Reviewed by Lorens Johansson
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AmTagEd is a ID3 TAG editor for MP3 files. But, it doesn't just edit the
tags, it can also perform some other things on the MP3 file.

But first, the installation procedure couldn't be easier, it comes with a
standard installerscript. You can choose from many different icons, and it
comes in five different languages.

After you have started it, you will see a toolbar in the top, the tag edit
fields to the left and the MP3 list to the right.
It's from the toolbar that you performs everything (besides the editing).
You can add MP3s in five different ways, load an old list, insert an old
list, add files, add a directory or add recursive.

When you want to edit an MP3 all you have to do is to click on the MP3 file
in the list, and start edit it. Very simple. You can set in the prefs if you
want to save the TAG info on the press of RETURN or when you press the Save
TAG button!
Also, if the MP3 has a lousy name, you can just press the Make filename from
TAG to make a nice filename or as a filecomment, the format of the
name/filecomment is ofcourse also settable in the prefs.

The toolbar is using TearOff.mcc, this might not mean anything to you, but
TearOff.mcc is a class that lets the toolbars be torn off the main window
and you can place them anywhere you want on the screen.

The documentation is an AmigaGuide which is very well layed out, but it doesn't
go so deep into details, it just mentions everything very briefly... But it
doesn't do anything, since AmTagEd is very self explainable, and it has a little
textfield that explains what everything is for (the thing you hold the mouse over).

This is THE tool for all of you that has alot of MP3s, much better than the editors
that usually comes in the players!

GHN (GetHTTPNews) - Reviewed by Lorens Johansson
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GHN is a little tool to retrieve HTML files from servers and convert them to
a text file. It's very useful if you want to read different News Sites offline,
like Yahoo Lycosm InfoSeek etc.

It's very easy to use, just setup one or more config files and start it. It will
then either perform on just one config file, or all of them, your choice. After
that it will start download and convert.
But there is a bad thing to, it's quite slow for modem users, and it doesn't say
when it's finished the download so you can't disconnect until it's finnished with
the convertion.

The configuration is simple, just enter the URL, where in the file to start/stop and
some other stuff...

One great thing is that this tool is CLI based, no GUI. And for a tool that's this
small, it's just plain stupid to have a GUI.

Img2HTML - Reviewed by Lorens Johansson
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Img2HTML is a program to get the Width and Height from pictures, perfect if you
are doing webpages...

There isn't any need for an installation of Img2HTML, just copy it somewhere.

The usage is very simple, just run it from CLI with the picture name and path as
an argument (you can add as many images as you want to)... After that it will write
the HTML image tag to a window, or to a file. It's perfect to add in a button or menu
in DOpus!

It supports JPEG, GIF and PNG imageformats, and that's really all you need since it's
main purpose is to make it faster to make HTML files.

I can't really say that it comes with a documentation, it has five lines in the readme
that shows how to use it. But since it's so simple to use, you won't need any more!

Img2HTML has the source in C included, so you can use/abuse it as you like!

Prayer is a MPEG Audio Layer 3 (MP3) player for those who want looks before speed.
It isn't the fastest MP3 player around (it's not slow either but not just as fast
as some others), but for those who have the power and want to have the BEST looking
MP3 player for Amiga.

But it isn't just an MP3 player, it can also play CDDA (direct from CDs) WAVE and
everything else that the AmigaOS datatypes supports!

The installation is very simple, just run the script, and wait some secs.

To improve the look of Prayer, there are some Robes (like skins) and they look COMPLETELY
different from each other, the size, position of everything, font, everything can be
positioned where ever you want, but to be able to create your own Robes, you have to have
the registered version!

It also has a Playlist, but you can't save the list in the unregistered version (these
are the only two limitations in the unregistered version).

According to the doc, this is what quality it can play on different CPUs:

030/50 MP3 in 22khz, mono, medium quality.
040/40 MP3 in 22khz, stereo, full quality.
060/50 MP3 in 44khz, stereo, full quality.

But when I try to play a MP3 on my 060, I can't have that, I must either loose some
quality or run it in lower khz.

It comes with a html documentation, it's VERY brief, but such a tool like Prayer
doesn't need so much; If you can run a Stereo, then you can run Prayer!

WBBump - Reviewed by Lorens Johansson
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WBBump is a tool, NOT A HACK, that puts a bumpmapped logo on your WB screen.
The lightsource is the mouse. If you don't understand what it is, then think
of some eyes that follows the mousepointer, this is a picture, and it lights
up towards the mouse.

It's very easy to install this tool, just put your favourite in
WBStartup, or run it whenever you want! But you need to Assign WBBump: first!
You can draw your own pictures too, if you want. WBBump even has two clocks,
one that shows the normal time, and one that shows the Internet Time (Swatch
Beats).

If you have a CPU meter then you will see that it uses all your CPU power, but
WBBump has a priority so other programs comes in first hand, which means, this
will not slow down your system. It also supports Cybergraphics and Picasso96!

There are many ways of configure it, and the Guide describes all of them very
deep, it's not at all hard to understand!

CyberQT 1.4 Vs. QT 1.4 - Reviewed by Leto Kauler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's high noon on the Amiga corale. The two competitors saunter into
the deserted street, their arms tense by their sides, fingers
twitching. It's the showdown of the decade.... to prove who's the
fastest Quicktime in the West....

CyberQT 1.4

Vs.

QT 1.4
------
(c)1996-1997
Marcus Comstedt

Heard of Quicktime? It's a special video and audio format, created
by Apple. Quicktime movie clips are pretty good for the Internet
because they are well compressed and therefore can be sent about
fairly quickly. There are HEAPS of quicktime files available on the
Internet, and I'll give you the low-down on the best programs to
play them.

You might have noticed that both CyberQT and QT are getting a bit
old now (1997), and I think, unfortunately, they aren't supported
by their authors anymore either.

Both programs have very similar options to alter the playback of
your quicktimes, but they essentially work quite differently.
The main difference is that QT will load the whole file (both
audio and video) into RAM. While this supposedly speeds up
playback, it means you need a LOT of RAM. If you've got a
quicktime movie larger than available memory, then you can forget
about being able to play it. CyberQT on the other hand can play
a movie in very little memory. In fact, on my A1200 I was still
able to watch clips with only 250K Chip and 200K Fast.

One problem with Quicktimes I've encountered is that there is
actually many different video and audio formats under the title
"quicktime".  The player requires a decoder for each format, and
if a decoder for a certain format is not available you may not
be able to play the video or audio or both.  CyberQT has numerous
more decoders than QT, but still doesn't cover them all. Therefore
you will come across quicktime files which you simply won't be
able to play. This is more common for newer quicktimes.  As far
as I know, neither program can run Quicktime 3 or higher encoded
movies.

Now for the important information: the frame rates! Please note
that I've only got a standard 68020... so the FPS (frames per
second) really is quite low. My CPU does pretty well, but any
processor higher than this I imagine would cook quicktimes to a crisp.
Also note that the variety of video and audio formats make a
difference to speed.

As you can see, CyberQT really does a good job for Quicktime playback,
especially for dithering.  QT is faster for HAM8 though (which
actually looks horrible in both programs). But as I said before, this
is on a 68020 processor, so if you've got anything higher then you're
laughing.

I have no idea how CyberGFX playback works, but both programs support
it and apparently play the movies in windows on Workbench. With AGA
you have to watch them on a custom screen.

As far as playing Quicktime files, CyberQT is my favourite program,
mainly for the direct-from-disk playback feature.  QT is still a
good program, but just doesn't reach a high enough frame rate.

My suggestion is to try both on your system and decide for yourself.

You can find the Quicktime movies above at the following links, along
with plenty more to keep you busy for ages.

YAM 2.0 (Yet Another Mailer) - Reviewed by Lorens Johansson
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

YAM is, as the name may reveal to the smart ones, a mailer for the Amiga!
YAM Let's you send and receive E-Mails over the internet, and it has alot of other
great features.

First of all, to be able to use YAM, you will need a POP3 mailprovider, this is the
server which you connect to and send/recieve your mails. Usually you will get a
POP3 account along with your Internet connection.

The installation:
After you have downloaded the desired archives (Only the main archive is required!)
the installation procedure can start. And it will go very smoothly, only asking you
about the stuff that you have downloaded. There shouldn't be any problems at all.
As of now, YAM doesn't come in very many languages, but I can bet that there will
come a few on Aminet within a short period of time.

First look:
When you start YAM, you will see a window that looks like this, ofcourse with the
Toolbar that you choosen, and it's bigger too:

It's from this window that you will perform every action. And there is alot to
choose from!
As you see YAM is very easy to understand, it has a very nice layed out interface,
with easy to understand buttons (There is text under the toolbarbuttons if that is
configured in the MUI prefs!).

Configuration:
You must configure some important stuff in YAM before you can use it, it's very easy,
just follow the steps in the Guide and you will have YAM ready for usage in less than
5 minutes.
Since YAM allows several people to use the same program, you must also configure
User! This is very simple, it's done in less than 1 minute. No trouble at all.
The different users can be configured to share the same Folders, but the folders can
also be configured so only one person will have access to it, it can even be password
protected and/or encrypted.
There is ofcourse alot of other options, but you don't have to touch them in order to
use YAM, but when you have gotten to know YAM, then please read through the chapter
in the Guide that covers the configuration and configure it to your personal taste to
make the most of YAM!

Write a message:
So, how good is YAM when it comes to Writing an E-Mail?

At the first look at the Write window, it doesn't seem very complex, and it doesn't
look like it has very many options, but the look can deceive, and it does it this
case!
Let's look at the Toolbar first, from left: Open in external Editor, Insert a text,
Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, and then there is four textstyles. The textstyles is the
standard *bold* _underline_ /italics/ and #coloured#.
YAM has a very nice feature in the To: field, when you write the beginning of an
E-MailAddress or Alias from your AddressBook it will complete them just like
modern browser does with the URL!
If you download a SpellChecker like ISpell or AlphaSpell you can also set so the stuff
you write will be spellchecked as you type, or afterwards!
When you have written a mail (or before for that matter) you can set alot of flags
etc in YAM. Like the importance of the mail, Encrypt/Sign it with PGP, CC and BCC to
other people (Carbon Copy and Blind Carbon Copy) and more...
When you are finished with the mail, you can either choose Send Now, which ofcourse
sends the mail right away, Send Later, will send the mail when you press the Send
button and Hold to Hold it so you can edit it later!

Read a message:
When you read a mail in YAM, you will get a window similar to this:

It's from here all the reading takes place. And as you see the read window is split
in three parts (as default), you have the toolbar, the Header field and the message
field. If you want you can remove the Header field, and show any other headers too,
and you can also show a picture of the person who sent the mail.
There isn't so much to say about the Read window.

Other functions:
YAM has alot of other neat functions, I will mention some of them (the more commonly
used ones) briefly!

- AddressBook: This is ofcourse where you keep the information about all your friends,
you can also setup lists here, like if you have a list of persons that you send a
mail too each week, then all you have to do is set the listalias in the To: field and
it will be mailed to everyone in the list.

- Search function: The search function in YAM is very good, you can set which folders to
search in, in which field(s) in the mail it should search, and what it should search for!

- Filters: YAM has a very good filter, here you can setup so mails that is from a specified
person, uses a special mailer, contains this and that, you name it... The comparison part
is really complex, it's virtually nothing that it can't do! You can set different
actions on the mails that matches a special criteria, like: Bounce, Forward, Reply,
Execute, Play Sound, Move, Delete and Don't Download.

There is more functions in YAM, but these where the most important/used!

Conclusion:
As you see, YAM is a mailer with alot of functions, but it amazes me that it's so
easy to use, that you can have it up and running in less than five minutes. And ofcourse
for this price (free), you can't find a better mailer for Amiga, I'm not even sure that you
can get another mailer this good on any platform.
There is only one thing to say about YAM: "Use it!"

Month in View - By Neil Williams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gordonblimey! I don't think you could find another month with so much
good stuff going on. There's a truck load of new software; the release
of Wasted Dreams, some fantastic image software: ImageFX 4,
Photogenics 4.1, and a whole new package! Not to mention new hardware
in the shape of the more powerful BoXeR, with phase 5 making rumblings
in the background about their PowerPC G3 boards being ready for
September. Amiga themselves are showing some action - whether or not
they're doing the right thing is irrelevant at the moment, they are
actually doing something!

For those unhappy with AmigaNG, AmigaOS itself is coming back with
Haage&Parter - OS3.5 will be here before you can blink.

All in all, not a boring month to be an Amigan. Now you lot out there
have to do your part - if you have an interest in playing a fantastic
game, go and buy Wasted Dreams.  Interested in art?  Got a scanner or
printer?  Go out and get ImageFX, Photogenics and FXPaint.  We are
getting some fantastic support from developers, let's show some
thanks! :-)

[-ed FXPaint will be reviewed within the next 2 issues]

DDE inquiry form results

We have finally found time to count the answers from our
inquiry form and to prepare web page with the results.
Results are presented in two forms. One for all Amiga
models together and other for each model separately.
Visit our web site to see the results.

TITLE: Diablo's Land

01.07.1999.
Diablo's Land in HI-Res.

Based on the results of the inquiry form we have decided
to make Diablo's Land Gfx Card version in High-resolution
(640x480) instead of low (320x256) that we have planed
before. However AGA version will still remain in 320x256
with 256 colors. We have start re-rendering the graphics
for High resolution and pictures will soon be posted to our
web site.

New BoXeR Specs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New BoXeR Design Specs

Access Innovation haven't yet delivered the Boxer motherboards, but
now we see why . . .

The new BoXeR does not have the real, and presumably now rare, Amiga
custom chip set. Instead those clever people at Access have designed
their own... We can hope that the Amiga clone revolution will
happen now!

. 100% Amiga compatible.
. NO CHIP RAM LIMITS!
. 4 ACTIVE, working, PCI slots.
. Motorola 68040 or 68060 at 25-75MHz.
. Single custom chip, AGA compatible, but faster!
. Dual E-IDE controllers.
. 2 DIMM slots for memory.
. Better DMA.
. 2MB flash ROM for quick OS upgrades!
. Hi-Density floppy disk interface.
. CD-ROM audio mixing connections.
. Keyboard port supports PS/2 keyboards.
. Supports PS/2 mice.
. Amiga Video slot.
. ATX sized motherboard for typical clone cases.
. Expansion connector to support 5xZorro 3 slots.
. Designed to easily support additional 64bit PowerPC CPUs

Woohoo! Now, if these can be pushed into high street stores... And
yes, I think it is perfectly possible - a low cost, high feature
machine sitting in a window playing some specifically coded demos will
sell, I think.

Photogenics 4.1 Released & bug fixed!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Photogenics 4

Finally, after four years of hard work the new version of the well-known
graphic manipulation software Photogenics is available.

Photogenics is a graphics/art package. It allows you to create stunning
images, either from scratch or by modifying existing images. It can be used
for a multitude of purposes, from simple file conversion, to advanced photo
manipulation and re-touching. It also offers extremely realistic and easy to
use media such as pencils, chalk and watercolours to create stunning
masterpieces in minutes.

Photogenics is based on innovation. At its core, it works on images unlike any
other product. Nothing you draw is permanent, it can be rubbed out as easily
as it was drawn, and tweaked to perfection. This freedom allows you to
experiment to a level never before seen.

Photogenics Feature List:

Unparalleled levels of creativity from being able to modify (in real time!)
the colour, transparency, image processing mode, and even the position of
what you have drawn.

Realistic Media tools such as Airbrush, Chalk, Pencil, Sponge, Watercolour,
Smudge and Smear.

Designed to look and feel good using just a standard mouse.

Paint-on Image Processing allows the user to apply effects simply by drawing
with any of the media tools. Being able to just airbrush everything on (and
off!) allows instant touch ups without the need for tedious masking. Paint
modes available include AddColour, Adjust
(Brightness/Contrast/Red/Green/Blue), Bas Relief, BiColour, Blur, Burn,
BurnThru, Clone, ColourToGrey, Convolve, Darken, DifferenceRGB, DisplaceMap,
Dodge, EdgeDetect, Emboss, FlipX, FlipY, Hardlight, Lighten, Min, Max,
MotionBlur, Multiply, Negative, Overlay, Paint, PanBlur, Pixelize, Posterize,
RadialBlur, Roll, RubPaint, RubThru, Screen, Fire, Solarize, Softlight,
SubtractColour, and Tint.

Exclusive Paint Layer technology allows mistakes to be rubbed out without
having to redo the good parts, simply by fading out with the right mouse
button.  Unlimited number of easy to use layers allow fast image composition.

Stunning Paint-On Pyrotechnics such as lensflares, fire, and explosions.
Combine with the smear tool to produce supernovas, waves of fire, and even
sunsets and waterfalls.

Innovative clutter free user interface (font sensitive and user scaleable).
GUI components can be docked/undocked, and positioned whereever you please.

Fully Multi-threaded - youll never be kept waiting as Photogenics 4 responds
instantly to your requests even while operations are in progress.

Advanced yet still easy to use Alpha channel support. Use any open image as a
mask, or simply paint one straight on to the image. Updates to the Alpha
channel such as brush strokes are reflected on the main image in real time.

24bit Alpha channels. Only Photogenics lets you use colour Alpha channels,
which enable you to independently mask each of the red green and blue
channels. Paint on the Alpha with red, and this lets the red component show
through, paint on with yellow, and both the red and green channels are
updated. Painting with shades of grey produce masking as normal. Create
awesome effects by loading in a 24bit Alpha channel and using it to mask
image-processing effects.

Symmetry Tool - combine with any of the Media tools to create amazing images
in seconds.

Text Tool - finally you can just click where you want the text, and type it
straight onto any paint layer. Text remains fully editable until image is
Fixed into the underlying image.

Multiple Views  allows you to have as many views of an image as you like, each
with its own magnification.

Impressive colour selection facilities, with five colour choosers, RGB and HSV
sliders, and support for 256 colour swatches. You can also pick colours from
Images, with changes updating in real time.

Extensive file format support. Current list includes loading and saving
IFF-ILBM, IFF-DEEP, JPEG, Targa, BMP, PNG, with more to follow. Photogenics
also supports loading with 24bit DataTypes.

24bit Printing support via StudioPrint. 

Open Architecture - Photogenics is effectively just one big collection of
plug-ins that blends seamlessly to form one program. Third party developers
can have access to the same API as Photogenics does, allowing developers to
extend the core software to an amazing degree.

Minimum Requirements: 

68020, 8Mb RAM, Amiga OS 3.0,CD ROM drive. 

Recommended Requirements: 

68060, 16 or 24bit display, 16Mb RAM, Amiga OS 3.0, CD ROM drive.

ImageFX 4
~~~~~~~~~

ImageFX 4 Announced - Now with Animation!

Nova Design, Inc., creators of the award winning ImageFX package and the
highly received Aladdin 4D v5 package, are excited to announce a brand new
upgrade - ImageFX 4! ImageFX has been the required graphics application for
all Amiga owners and has been a part of Video Toaster/Flyer owner's toolkits
for years. Combining painting, image file format conversion, image
processing, and special effects, ImageFX remains the undisputed leader in
graphics manipulation on the Amiga.

Now in it's fourth major upgrade, ImageFX goes animated! If you work on video
using your Amiga or want to work on animations for the Internet, the new
animation controls in ImageFX are exactly what you've been wishing for on
your Amiga. The animation system is as easy to use as the animation controls
in Amiga paint packages but far more powerful and support full color
animation, palette mapped animation and greyscale animations as well.

ImageFX 4 - the Animated Details

Nova Design, Inc. has built on the new windowed interface introduced in
ImageFX 3.x and has added controls to directly manipulate animations within
ImageFX. Onscreen VCR-style controls have been added to the layering system
to allow you to move within the frames of an animation or even playback the
animation in your preview window. Brushes can be animated across a series of
frames and effects can be automatically processed across frames as well!

These controls make it easy to edit animations for use on the Internet on your
own web pages. You can create hand drawn animations, brush animations and you
can easily rotoscope video sequences, add effects, and batch process. If you
want to modify web animations, it's as easy as loading now that you can load
animations. Full support for loading and saving entire or partial FlyerClips
is included for Amiga Toaster/Flyer owners.

Many image processing functions and effects have been updated to work directly
on frames and layers now. And what would a new upgrade of ImageFX be without
new special effects? We don't know, since we've never released without
including new effects before and we're not going to do so now. We've got some
cool new effects in this release, so read on!

The new Fireworks effect can create amazing digital fireworks displays on your
images. The parameters for the effect are easily animated. Fireworks uses a
special-purpose particle system and can even use custom brushes for the
firework 'particles' so you can create everything from a realistic firework
burst to a shower of coins!

Distorter is the answer to a designer's dream. Similar to the 3D Perspective
Rotate function, Distorter can seemingly rotate your image in three
dimensions but with no constraints on how you move and adjust the image. You
can make it stretch out at any corner or even twist it around itself.
Amazing!

Blob is a fun, if digitally slimy, effect. With Blob you can set your
parameters to make a translucent colored ooze slide down your image. Looking
to simulate the effect of slime? No problem with Blob!

The Text Generator has had so many improvements that it is like a whole new
module. You can now use Postscript(tm) fonts with it in addition to Amiga
bitmap, color, and outline fonts. You have more control over the fonts. The
fonts now can anti-alias for the best possible display. Best of all you now
see your fonts and text, exactly as they'll appear, on the display of the
image in it's own window!

CD the Light!

ImageFX now comes on CDROM for it's standard distribution. If you don't have a
CDROM drive (and you should, they're pretty inexpensive now) ImageFX will
ship with a coupon to order a copy on floppies. As a bonus the CDROM has
sequences of images, animations, and nearly the entire contents of our
Internet site as well!

Ordering the Upgrade

As of this release a new price structure is being implemented for upgrades. If
you own a version of ImageFX prior to version 2.0 your upgrade price is now
$149.95. ImageFX 2.x owners can upgrade for only $99.95. ImageFX 3.x owners
can upgrade to ImageFX 4 for only $79.95. All upgrades include the
necessary hardcopy documentation or upgrade documentation and CDROM.

You can order via 1-800-IMAGE-69 in the US and Canada or call (804) 282-1157
elsewhere. Orders can also be faxed to (804) 282-3768 or mailed to our
address. Anyone purchasing ImageFX 3.x new after May 20th, 1999 can upgrade
for free when you mail us your dated proof of purchase with your upgrade
request.

You'll be shipped ImageFX and receive it in approximately four weeks depending
on the volume of preorders. Previous order volumes have been high causing
delays, so order early!

ImageFX is also available, new, through your favorite Amiga dealer at a
suggested retail price of $349.95.

FXPaint
~~~~~~~

PRESSRELEASE, 7.7.1999
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

WHAT IS FXPAINT ?

fxPAINT is a new, revolutional image processiong software for the
AMIGA, that will make use of the latest hard- and software existing
for the AMIGA. It`s planned to release a first, full release on CD
within this year (1999).

MAIN FEATURES

fxPAINT is a strongly extended image processing software for the
AMIGA. It contains the usual painting tools, but also offers a lot
more. E.g. it`s possible to mark whole areas by a simple mouseclick.
Gradients can be added by a simple dragging, too. fxPAINT allows you
the usage of several, natural pens like chalk, pencil, the so called
"Artist Pen" or simply with pens, that were cut from another picture
before. As you might already have thought, when reading fxPAINT`s
name, fxPAINT is not limit to painting with colors or cutted pens, but
offers you a great palette of high-quality effects. This includes, but
isn`t limited to: Standards-effects like changing of brightness,
contrast or gamma. Special-effects like light-sources or bumpmapped
surfaces, glow- and shadow-effects, waves, explosive supernovas,
distortions, etc. You`ll also find professional tools like
Gradtion-curves or matrix operations. This opens up a great number of
posibilities to create and design pictures. Another special feature is
fxPAINT`s realtime-mode, that shows changes to the effect-settings
immediately after they were made. E.g. Light-sources can be dragged
over the pictures - in realtime and full quality!! fxPAINT basically
is similiar to a layer-based image processing package, but it isn`t
directly equal to it. You can paint with effects while the
Alpha-Channel (that can have full 24bitdepth) is fully used, if
active. Painting-mistakes can be fixed easily by the undo and
redo-function. Of course fxPAINT is not only very usable for changing
and manipulating images but also for creating them. E.g. fire,
fractals, screenshots, videodigitizes, etc. can be made directly from
within fxPAINT by some simple clicks.

EXTERNAL DEVICES AND MODULES

The support of scanners and videodigitizers and an open, documented
Plugin-API will make you feel, that other programs aren`t needed any
more. To guarantee brilliant printings, optimized routines for the
printer.device and TurboPrint are available within fxPAINT. fxPAINT
keeps the internal multitasking. You can work even while scanning!

INTERNAL MODULES

Maybe you are one of those (like me, too), that don`t make great
efforts to sort the graphics on HD in order to keep an overview over
them. That`s why you might like the inbuilt picture database called
fxALBUM. Editing a picture is very easy then, as you only have to
click on the image and on another button in order to have the picture
loaded in fxPAINT. If you want to, you can print overviews over your
pictures as well. For fast conversions between the file formats, the
module fxCONV is available. It allows you automated conversion of
several directories and/or files full of pictures into another format
easily. If you want to create graphics for the WWW and want to make
use of so called HTML-Imagemaps, fxIMAGEMAP might be your tool,
allowing you easy creation of ImageMaps within minutes!

THE GUI-SYTEM

fxPAINT has internal BOOPSI-classes of its own, that ideally adapt to
the used hardware. No matter what hardware is used, the fxPAINT-GUI is
full of images, what makes fxPAINT more usable and effective. Of
course, a bubble-help-system is available describing the most
important buttons, so you needn`t guess, what this or that button
might be for. On truecolor-screens, fxPAINT`s GUI is most impressing,
because it then uses 24bit-gradients, that give it an even more modern
and unique look. fxPAINT offers you the ability to adapt to your
already existing knowledge by offering three modes for novices,
average users and experts.

Heretic II
~~~~~~~~~~

The Next Generation of Amiga Games

Activision licenses Hyperion to port Heretic II

Hyperion is very pleased to announce that it has (in collaboration
with Stuart Walker from [http://www.digital-images.demon.co.uk]
Digital Images) acquired a license from Activision to port
[http://www.ravensoft.com] Raven Software's highly acclaimed Heretic
II to the Amiga.

Heretic II is the stunning conceptual sequel to Heretic and Hexen and
is based on Id Software's advanced Quake IITM engine. The Amiga
version will require a PPC processor (WarpOS) and a graphicscard and
will take full advantage of 3D accelerators through Warp3D. The
possibility of a 68060 version is under investigation but would in any
case require 3D acceleration. Other features include virtual 3D sound
(supported through AHI) and network-play (internet, modem, LAN).

The Amiga port will be carried out by Peter Annuss (ADescent PPC, EGCS
WarpUp), Joe Sera (AQCVid, Skyline II, ObjectWorkshop), Hans-Joerg
Frieden (Warp3D, ADescent W3D, Shogo) and others. Release is expected
to be early to mid Q4 1999.

"Hyperion's goal is to provide Amiga users with some of the best games
to date and this is just the beginning", says Hyperion's managing
partner Ben Hermans. "High-end games require high-end machines. There
is some really exciting Amiga technology out there today with more on
the horizon and we intend to push it to the limit. If users support us
by getting us the sales we need, they will have a lot to look forward
to".

Amiga Changes Kernel Decision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

July 9, 1999

Amiga selects Linux as their Next Generation OS Kernel

 July 9, 1999 - San Diego, California. Amiga has selected Linux as the OS kernel
for the new Amiga Operating Environment that is scheduled for release later this
year.   Amiga is selecting Linux after several months of evaluating the
technical progress of the OS and the tremendous industry support that Linux has
gained.

The development community has given Linux a major endorsement and the momentum
that Linux now enjoys is having a significant impact on the computer industry.
There are a large number of hardware device drivers and software applications
written for Linux already and this number is growing daily.

"Our strategy for implementing the new Amiga is to integrate the best technology
in the industry into a new, efficient, exciting and revolutionary computer
platform focused on the future' said Jim Collas, President and CEO of Amiga.
"Using Linux as our OS kernel is only one component of the overall Amiga
Operating Environment.'

Look for more information on the choice of Linux as part of the overall Amiga
Operating Environment in the Executive Update section of our web site.

Piracy - By Roger Buckley
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just recently I have been involved with accusations of Pirate being yelled very
loudly and all over a free giveaway programme on the now defunct CU Amiga
CD27. This CD was the last one issued before CUAmiga passed on to the great
newstand in the sky and part of it's legacy to the Amiga world was a complete
fiasco over the Cd's main feature, Cinema4D. The CD contained the full version
but unfortunately the installer with it didn't work and after you'd struggled to
get it onto your hard drive it asked for a  registartion number. This was also
missing from the magazine at which point many people consigned the CD to the
bottom of the drawer.

Anyone who bought Amiga Format 117 could turn to page 98 where details of the
correct installer and a phone number to ring Hisoft and obtain the correct
registration number. The piracy accusations came about because a man who had
bought both the relevant magazines but had not rung Hisoft at the time decided
to help his son with a school graphics course by using Cinema4D. He rung Hisoft
who told him they were no longer issuing the code number so he appealed to the
Amiga Format Bulletin for the relevant number, where-upon he was jumped on
by Ben Vost and dire consequences were threatened for anyone who gave him the
number. He wanted to see if Cinema4D was suitable for his needs in order to
purchase the latest edition and not buy software blind.

Last year I bought a complete Amiga 1200 system as a back up for mine and
amongst all the goodies were magazine CD's which I already had. I have been
selling these, via an advert in AF to people who wish to complete their sets of
CDs. Does this make me a pirate ? I realise that the CD is not supposed to be
sold without the magazine but many people, me included bought the magazine
floppy versions before upgrading to a CD-Rom drive and wish to buy the
back-issue CDs not now available from AF or CUAmiga.  All the people who have
contacted me have asked for a specific CD number and not the TFX issue or
Opus 5 issue which leads me to believe they just want to fill the gaps in their
collections. For me piracy is making illegal copies of commercial products for
pecumiary gain, not suppling a code number for a free-issue game that the
person has bought.

Also on many CDs are hard-drive installers, many of which remove the copy
protection or have trainers. The jst and Keith Krellwitz ones all state that their
fixes will only work with the original disks. Is this piracy? In effect you are
making an unauthorised copy of the software which was probably never intended
for hard drive installation. The reallity for me is that games such as Settlers and
Breathless would not get played if I had to load up floppies and search through
manuals for the appropriate codes whereas when one click of the menu loads the
game all ready to play.

Well, June/July and with it summer for us in the northern hemisphere (sorry
Australia). Since Summer is a light-heart time, included you'll find a
few light-hearted sites. Some humor, music, and art to lighten your
Summer nights. Enjoy!

The Main Event

To quote the web site, imagine if you could pick any two people to get
in a fight- fictional or real- who would it be? Ever want to see if
Popeye could beat up Mike Tyson? Or Calista Flockhart vs food? Well,
each month two contestants are chosen, each side argued for and
against in a heated debate (read as: mud-slinging name calling), and
then the final decision left up to a vote of the web site viewers (that's
you). Now if only they had this on Cable...

A+ Art
http://www.aplusart.com

Another good web-art source, categorized into icons, bullets (a
Smile-face bullet anyone), animations (600+), clipart, backgrounds, and
bars, with further sub-categorizations making browsing easy. If you're
into these then you can't have too many web art sources, and this one's
pretty darn good.

Want to get some of those old mods made in some bizzare format? Want to
Play said format? Then here is where to find them; thousands of tunes
that date back to the C64 days! Add in a growing section featuring some
classic utils, games, and art (a kickstart pic from WB 1.1 days anyone?)
and it's definitely worth a check.

Humor Archives

Dumb Laws
http://www.dumblaws.com

Ever wonder about the supposed basic intelligence of our elected
officials? Ever figure the hamster's dead in that little squirrel-cage
they call a brain? Want proof?

Well, here it is. A web site devoted to actual laws still on the books.
Laws that go past the rare occurance of amusement to wondering if all
the world's a sitcom. Categorized by country and State (for here in the
USA), there must be thousands of of laws out there that have been made
dumb by the passage of time (some are a century old), or the passage of
a brain cell or two in the guy that wrote it.

To site just a few...

Baldwin Park California: Nobody is allowed to ride a bicycle in a
swimming pool.

Arkansas: Arkansas must be pronounced "Arkansaw"
The Arkansas River can rise no higher than to the Main Street bridge
in Little Rock.

England (This one's really outdated): All English Men over 14 are meant
to carry out 2 hours (or so) of longbow practice a week supervised by
the local clergy. [-ed Ahhh, so thats what i've been doing in my
spare time!]

Chelsea Pensioner may not be impersonated (one of you people over in
England want to explain this one to me?)

China: Drivers of power-driven vehicles who stop at pedestrian crossings
are liable to a fine of up to five yuan, or a warning. -Article 40 of
the Beijing Traffic Laws (Crosswalks must be used as target zones then).

You get the idea; I could go on like this for pages. Check this site
out, it should be good for laughs for most of the summer.

Dr. Strange, Web Wanderer - By Mark A. Tierno
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Okay, so I goofed and you didn't get to see last months article until
this month. Well, that doesn't mean that I'm slacking off. I'm Still
doing this month's web article, so consider yourself blessed with twice
the web sites!  The other article covers last month's sites, and this
one this month's. That's ten sites in all, with TWO monthly picks!

That should keep you people too busy to drown me in complaints.

Ben And Jerry's Flavor Graveyard
http://www.benjerry.com/graveyard/index.html

Just when you thought it was enough entertainment to see what strange
flavor names Ben & Jerry's ice cream would come up with next, they think
up this idea for a flavor graveyard. Browse through all the retired
flavors and amuse yourself with the vast numbers of strange flavor names
that have toured on through the frozen section. Sambucca Chocolate Chunk
anyone?

Sporks
http://www.spork.org

Yes, someone actually put up a web site on that bizarre little eating
utensil (and even bought the domain name apparently!). Aside from the
various uses for a spork (the least of which is eating with one),
there's sporks from around the world, spork links, and an AVI of
someone trying to eat ramen with a spork.  Oh, and don't forget how to
turn one into a Foon, or getting a spork tee-shirt!

IRIS
http://www.irishq.dk

Have a yen for more demos?  What with Amiga CD mags vanishing like
American wildlife finding those great looking demos is getting harder.
Well, here's something to get you going.  The demo group IRIS not only
has a web site, but they have a whole bunch of their demos, intros, and
slideshows available for download there.  Check it out and start filling
up your hard drive.

Museum Of Dirt
http://www.planet.com/dirtweb/dirt.html

Nowadays they'll have a web site for anything, and here's proof. With
carefully cataloges of dirt from all around the world, celebrity dirt,
and more, you can view just what dirt from places you'll never go to
look like; each type of cataloged dirt is accompanied by a picture of a
glass jar filled with the stuff.  Of course to my untrained eyes it all
looks just like dirt, but I guess it'll do until someone comes out with
the paint-peeling site.

Pick Of The Month

Shaolin Gung Fu Institute
http://www.webcom.com/~shaolin/home.html

First off, I did Not spell it wrong. Gung Fu is the correct spelling,
Kung Fu is the incorrect English translation (I point this out because
my old Gung Fu instructor would have my hide otherwise).  That said, if
you have ever been curious about the lgeendary mystery that is Gung Fu,
and want a bit more exposure than just the latest Jackie Chan movie,
then this is the place to go. Brought over from China in the early 1920s
by 8 Shaolin priests that fled to America, the information here is as
accurate as it gets.

Start off with the history. Going back to 540 AD when an Indian
Buddhist priest came up to China to spread his religion and had to
develop certain exercises to keep his priests awake during meditation,
to the burning of the temples after World War I, it's an interesting
dive into a history most consider all but lost.

From Taoism, to Budhism, to Chan, you can see how the philosophy varies
among the Shaolin and how it affects their training and styles.  You can
also see how the temple structure was laid out, with the titles,
rankings, and general life in the temple.

Finally, the part that is the most interesting, the different styles of
Gung Fu. Hard versus Soft, External versus Internal, this sites gives
all the general animal forms available as well as several family styles.
With praying Mantis, Crane, Tiger, Dragon, Leopard, and Snake, and the
classic division of Northern versus Southern styles, you can discover
the techniques and history of each style and gain a better understanding
of what was until now just but a name.

Then maybe the next time you see a Jackie Chan movie you can point out to
the friend sitting next to you "Hey, that's tiger style he's using
there."

Guide on how to make good Shareware - By Chris Seward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Over the years I have registered many programs by various authors
and have also made some shareware software back between about
1991-1993 which I wouldn't want to show about these days and actually
probably couldn't find, luckily.

 The main thing I have noticed is that the level of support you
get and the quality of the program design and presentation is alot
different in every case. I am not talking about the likes of Miami
and AmIRC type shareware/commercial software but the likes that
you will find on the Aminet and in various PD Libraries. This software
is the original shareware software that has been around since I
was a wee nipper and hasn't changed all to much over the years.
The major difference is that you now get alot more registrations
that will give an option to send via email which just didn't exist
back in the early days of PD houses and shareware authors.

 As I have had many years experience with lots of different shareware
authors I have come to get used to what to expect and as I have
also produced some shareware myself I know what the market is like
from both sides of the fence. The different degrees of support,
presentation and the actual software you get can vary alot depending
on who you deal with. I have decided to give you a few tips and
tricks of the trade which will seriously enhance your reputation
and maybe even sales.

 The first thing that people look at is the presentation of a product
no matter if it is game or utility. The presentation is one of the
most important factors for eye-candy and should also be pointed
out that the way you present your software is the first impression
about the software the user who has bought your product will see.

 I have had many different experiences with lots of authors and one
of my worst presentation problems was in around 1994 when I registered
a game from one Assisins collection disks. The game I thought I was
getting was brilliant and obviously the point which made me buy the
full game.... well at least thats what I thought I was doing. I
packaged up my £5 registration fee and sent it off eager to receive
my software...

 A few weeks later I receive a re-used jiffy bag in my little collection
of post/mail at the door. Opening the jiffy bag I find an old disk
with a cut up long style label to fit into the disk label groove along
with a tatty letter telling me that he never finished the game and
decided to keep my £5 and send me another game with 20 levels. The
game I received was quite nice with good graphics but I didn't actually
want it and if I did then I would have registered that instead!

 I know these days £5 isn't all to much but you are paying people for
something they have done and if they come through on messy disks with
horrible hand written labels then people get a bad impression before
they have even used your software. Then when they come to use the
software they are going to mark it down rather than up because the
person who has bought it is annoyed by its bad presentation. The
presentation does not have to cost the world and obviously it is the
thing on the disk that counts but people do like to see something
nice and a bit like professional layout. The best presentation I
have had the pleasure of receiving was when buying a game called
Moose Drive which was made by Graeme Dean along time before he went
on to produce DrawStudio and many other loved Amiga graphics packages.

 The disks had nice printed labels on and a great letter telling you
various bits of information and also thanking you for buying their
software which is always a good start. When you write or print your
letter then you should always start off thanking the person buying
your software because then they will feel you are grateful, after all
they are paying you... maybe it isn't a massive amount but if your
in it just for money then this isn't the game.

 When deciding on what you are going to send the buyers of your
product you should always take into account what it is going to cost
you. If a registration fee is just £5 then people aren't going to
expect any sort of box or glossy guide that tells you how to work
various options so you shouldn't go wasting money on what isn't needed.
While talking into account the price each person will pay you should keep
in mind the cost of disks, jiffy bag, paper and postage. These should
all be new to make a good impression. The jiffy bag is probably the
least to worry about but if possible always try to buy a new one as
a tatty bag or envolope through the post does not give a good
impression. Using a normal envelope unless padded is not a good idea,
disks can be damaged which means you will only have to pay more
once they get returned, don't think cutting corners will save you
money because in the end it is likely to cause you more trouble than
its worth. When using disks always make sure they are new, it is
no good trying to peel off a bit of a label and then just hoping that
the bumps from the old label won't show up to much. Don't cut corners
here either, shop around for the cheapest disks but make sure they
are of good quality and always find out if labels are already stuck
onto disks before purchasing them. At best always try to print a label,
it doesn't matter if you don't have a good printer, the effort will
always look better. If no printer is to hand then get someone with
nice neat writing before attempting to scribble some scruffy writing
onto a label.

 Remember that when sending disks to countries outside your own or
heavy items inside your country there could be extra charge than
just a normal postage stamp that you have been sticking on everything.
If you don't pay the correct postage then your package is either
unlikely to get to its destination or on the other hand the person
at the other end will have to pay the difference. If you registered
a product would you be very happy if you find your paying the postage
to receive it. If on the other hand is gets lost in the great world
postage service then you will expect to receive a nice angry letter
from whoever registered.

 The trick is not to cut any corners because they will only fall
back on you with faulty or damaged disks, none arriving software and
a whole host of other problems, sort everything out before hand and
you will run smoothly.

 When receiving orders make sure you deal with them as soon as
possible and if you know it will be hard for you to deal with them
in a reasonable amount of days say two weeks then make sure you
have put a notice in the documents before a person has registered.
If you have the time then deal with orders the same day or a few
days after because the person registering will be impressed by the
fast turn around speed which can only help to aid you in future.
If you can't be bothered to deal with orders then you shouldn't
really be trying to sell shareware software. If you show you are
as professional as possible then you can easily go far.

 The different types of software all need different types of support.
Noone is asking that you have a 24 hour hotline open to take problems
but some sort of after sale service always go down well and its
doesn't have to cost the world. If you don't mind telling them your
phone number then do so because they can call you costing you nothing
but time and they have a quick solution to their problem. It is a
real pain when you receive something and either it doesn't work or
you can't work an option and there is no documentation about it. You
find there is no help available and if the author (you) doesn't bother
to reply then they will most likely never buy from you again no
matter how good your product is.

 If your product is updated on a regular basis then you should
decide if the registered user is going to get updates for free or
at a reduced price. If your software is updated very regularly then
you don't want to be giving it out free all the time because soon
the original registration fee they paid you will be past with no
profit and you will be eating into your own money something which
you should not do and nor are required to do. A good tip is not to
update products too often and keep building on them until you have
a product that is improved enough to warrant a new fee or keep you
well in budget by only sending out free update copies now or then.

 When you decide on your fee you should take into account that next
time the person decides to upgrade they are not always willing to
keep paying the same fee. This can become annoying because you are
an already registered customer and getting no reduction or no
free updates. You are not required to give out free updates but
if you decide to charge for them then it is best to give a good
reduction to already registered customers. Once a major update has
been completed that warrants more money then your already registered
customers can occasionally for major updates be required to pay
the full price but this is up to you depending on what you want
to charge.

 When working out what money is coming in then you should set yourself
a budget of how much each person is getting spent on disks and
equipment etc. Write down the cost of each item from disks to
postage and stick to what you have agreed with yourself. If your
registration fee is only high enough to cover the basics then
stick to that but make sure you aren't charging a high price just
to pay for the expensive boxes you've had made and the flashy
cover pictures. It is the product inside or on the disk that people
have registered for and not the frills that come with it. You should
make sure you do at least the basics with new disks and if possible
printed label and a good quality letter with details on updates
or how to use certain functions. You want to make a good cosmetic
impression but not go overboard making people pay for these add-ons
that don't make the product any better but just the first glance
cosmetic appearance.

 A simple letter will do. You should give details on any hard to
use functions or if you want tell people about the secret bonuses
hidden inside if a game. Do not talk in length about how good you
think the product is because chances are if they have decided to
register the product then they already like what they have seen
at an earlier date. As I said earlier in the guide you should start
by thanking the person for registering and then ending with a
friendly comment saying that they can feel free to contact you
about the product any time.

 A small detail that alot of people either forget to do or just
miss and hope it will be fine is virus checking of a disk.
It is very rare these days to find a virus but the time you don't
check a disk you are sending to a customer who has registered will
be the once in a million time that the disk receives a virus.
Always check lastly the disk you are sending out for viruses
because you will find yourself in alot of trouble if you corrupt
someones HD.

 Another really annoying fact is that people test the disk on
their computer only or the systems they actually own. Check to see
if the software boots and works correctly on friends systems
or give it to some beta testers to check it works on a range
of systems and the more you try the better. You may think trying
it on your two or three personal systems will do the trick and
that will cover the wide range of different systems out there.
Wrong. The chances are that you will have the same or very similar
programs in each computers C: Devs: Libs: etc etc. When you boot
it on your computer it may take a library from your Libs: or need
to run a certain file from your C: which isn't on your disk and
then when the user comes to run it they find that it won't work.
Along with this subject if you are going to make a bootable disk
which is always better as people with no HD don't want to mess
around with booting WB disks etc. Make sure that the boot system
is fast and mainly effective. The more fancy things you build into
the bootup system like scroll-in ascii picture and special music
playing options the more programs and libraries you will need to
put onto the disk taking up much more room just wasting space.

 The last annoying fact about registering software that springs
to mind is that when you get people asking for the registration
fee and then say include a disk and enough return postage. I think
this is terrible when people do this. If you don't want to loose
out money then increase the price just to include the disk and
postage, please do not make the user go through all this just to
register it will more than likely put them off.

 My last piece of advice is about beta-testers. I suggest that
you get people you know well and I mean ones who will honestly
give you a run down of your software and not just say they like
it because they are your friend and don't want to hurt your
feelings. If you advertise that you want beta-testers you will get
people just asking to test your software so they get some free
shareware software and don't have to pay for it. The other thing
to watch out for is if you do or have advertised freely which is
a bad move in itself then always keep an eye out because it has
happened many times in the past that a piece of software has been
found pirated before the author has even released it. This is
obviously the work of someone you have given a copy to which is
likely to be a beta-testers. I am not saying don't trust anyone
and that everyone is going to run off and copy it all around the
world but don't just fall into the trap of handing out copies
here and there.

 I hope this is or has been a little help to you and I hope if you
are planning to release some shareware software then you take into
account some of the points I have made because I have had experience
with both sides of selling and buying. My last words are have
fun making your software!

Vodoo, Development of a new game - By VODOO Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"VODOO" is the code name for a brand new game project. This new game
will be a wargame - but not an ordinary one. It will be a synthesis of
several great games such as Warcraft, StarCraft, Age Of Empires, Settlers...
and it will have original features as well.

The action will unfold in real time, on an isometric 3D display, and
network options will be available.

As for the story, there will be four different races who will confront
one another, but the goal will not necessarily be to destroy the other
races. The players will decide for themselves what goal they want to
pursue. They may want to act aggressively and exterminate everything
around them, like in a Seek'n'Destroy game, but they may find more
convenient, at times, to make alliances, and in that case their main
goal will be to sign a pact. Of course, the players' policy may change
course during the game, leading to plenty of sudden developments...
and possibly endless gameplay :-)

The 4 races on the spot will be:

* The Humans
* The Chibas
* The Orcs
* The Krakhen

Each of the above has its own set of characteristics, which may evolve
during the game, according mainly to the player's choices as leader of
the race. However, since the action starts about 1500 and may continue
well into the third millenium, the technologies, the objectives and
behaviours will change according to the period as well.

Here's a short description of each race:

1) The Humans :

This race is probably familiar to you. These people are average in
every respect, with no special advantages or shortcomings - but that
doesn't mean they're a boring kind :-) Although they are basically
peaceful, they may  get rebellious if their leadership is unwise. Their
scientists can do a fine job, especially if they are well-paid. They
are able to develop every kind of technology.

2) The Chibas :

They are an extra-terrestrial race, who arrived on the planet millions
of years ago, before all other races. They once mastered a high level of
knowledge... but unfortunately, in spite of that knowledge (or perhaps
because of it), their society has become decadent over time, and much
of their elders' technology was lost, as they reversed to an agrarian
way of life. However, they will still possess some high-end technology
at the beginning of the game. But they're not going to be very inventive,
since for them inventing means mostly reinventing, and that tends to be
boring. Among them, leadership is assumed by a clan chieftain. They
tend to follow his orders in a disciplined way, and are not prone to
revolt. But everything has limits...

3) The Orcs :

At the beginning of time, they were the enemies of the Humans. Their
evolution was a difficult and painful process, due to the awesome natural
conditions they dwelled in. As they have been living in volcanic mountains
for a long, long time, they have grown extremely aggressive and physically
strong, and they are now a rough and wreckless kind. They developed the
technology - and the magic powers - which they needed for survival. But
knowledge is not their passion, and they prefer to steal technology
from other races rather than develop it on their own.

4) The Krakhen :

The Krakhen... what can we say... They are a special race, they are,
indeed, dragons. They live on high forested plateaus and have attained a
high degree of civilization. Since they can fly, they are naturally
advantaged in fights, but only as long as they are in the air - they
are rather clumsy and vulnerable on the ground. They have great magic
powers, really impressive powers, and they take orders from their
Great Wizard.

That was a quick overview of the races, let's now say a word about the
action. There will be 4 different ways of playing:

- Campaign
- Scenario
- Competition      
- Team (Like the 3 above, but as teams)

1) Campaign :
   
You will have to make your race evolve, in whatever direction you choose,
and by whatever means you find relevant: you may have to conquer lands,
discover new technologies, defend yourself against the others, etc...

The main goal is NOT to kill everyone/thing nor to own all the lands;
you want your race to evolve in a certain direction (more knowledge, more
happiness, more order...), so you're going to take the steps necessary
to support that evolution. Your evolution choices will determine how
the game unfolds. At the beginning of this mode, no actual objective is
handed to you, you just have to devise your own goals.

2) Scenario :

In this mode, you will have to complete a given mission. All the missions
refer to great episodes of the world's history. The game's world, that
is :-)

3) Competition :

Several players, one Graal. All the players have the same particular goal,
and they try to attain it first. The objective can be finding a treasure,
kidnapping a certain character, destroying something, etc...

4) Team :

Same as the first mode, but you can play with your friends, up to 8
players at the same time.

Ok, if some of yours readers want to send comments, ideas, others, then

UK unmetered calls looming? - By Chris Seward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The UK for a long long time has argued that other countries have either
freecalls or unmetered calls. The arguments that you get nothing for
free are ridicules and are easily solved by having unmetered calls and
not freecalls. Freecalls imply that the call is totally free meaning you
pay nothing not even a one off charge. Unmetered is completely different
where you pay a small fee each time you call someone or dialup the
internet but can stay online for as long as you want without more than
the first one off charge. This basically means the phone companies are
still making money and the customers are happy.

I have heard lots and lots of for and against arguments all which can
be cleared up and it seems unmetered calls is the way the country will
be going very shortly. As far as I have been able to tell and what I
have been told by a person who delt with my inquiry at the government
organisation OFTEL which regulates telecommunications in the UK is that
only BT is restricted from giving free calls for which they have wanted
to do for a long time but no other company has this restriction so the
hundreds of new cable phone companies can freely offer unmetered calls or
free calls when ever they feel like but they are not willing to at the
moment.

At the moment in the UK there is huge tension about and personally I
can see unmetered calls coming into effect within the next 6 months
or year at the latest. I do not know this for a fact but the way things
are going at the moment it is very likely something major is about
to happen.

There are many points that make me think this because alot of new
services have appeared that offer freecalls or other incentives. The
first move was the free ISPs and now most of the ISPs in this country
don't charge any connection charge where most used to charge £10 UKP
which is about $15.20 US$ or 32.20 Dutch Guilders. As I said these
are mostly free with many old companies converting to offer free
service and many new 'free from the start' companies. The next step
is recently alot of ISPs have been experimenting with 0800 number
dialups which are the equivalent of US 1 800 numbers and this means
for those of you outside the UK or US that the call is totally free
and whatever company is running the 0800 number pays for the calls
people make. These types of companies have all started recently and
all around the same time.

One of the free ISPs called X-Stream offered 0800 dialups every
Saturday for a month. This may be only 4 days out of their history
but it is a start and makes a path for things to come. Another
newer idea is by the UK main phone company which until a few years
ago had about 80% of the people with phones using their company,
since the inception of cable companies they now only hold 60% of
the country connected to a phone line with the many many cable
companies each hold a few percent each. The new idea by BT (British
Telecom) is for those who pay a higher subscription rate to their
company and use their internet company BTinternet can use 0800
numbers every Saturday and Sunday. If your connection is inactive
for 15 minutes then the carrier will be dropped but if it is in
use you get 2 hours before you have to reconnect. This is obviously
to put people off staying on for 48 hour periods with no log off as
BT would have to foot the bill. If this actually gives any benefit
to the customer is left to be seen as you pay a higher rate standing
charge which could pay for your calls anyway. You may appear to
be getting something free but actually be paying for it in other
ways. Who Knows?!

AOL (America Online in the UK) has recently to my knowledge started
to offer on a trial basis 0800 number dialups 24/7. I'm not sure
how true this is or if they have a disconnect limit after a certain
time or not but as you need to have a PC to use them I wouldn't
know. A new ISP which has caused quite a stir in the UK is called
FreeCall UK which was announced a while ago but has now publicly
opened. The catch is the more time you use on their 0845 number
which for people outside the UK these numbers are charged at local
rate and the company who uses them gets some of the money you pay
your phone company you get more time on their 0800 numbers. If you
used 1 hour on peek time you get 30 minutes on their 0800 numbers
to use at anytime. If you use 1 hour on the weekends then you get
10 minutes on the 0800 number which you can use at anytime. If
you get someone else to sign up using your ID number then you get
100 minutes free time on their 0800 number. To open your account
you have to pay £6 UKP, about $9.12 US$.

Overall this is a good idea but alot of effort is needed to make
use of this but if you can stand this then you get some free calls
which are not limited to any certain times.

Another new ISP has just opened that gives local call access with
no charges but the earlier you sign up you will get more shares
in the company when they float the company in the future. The first
certain amount of people get the most shares and as more people
sign up they get less and less shares. By now the big amounts of
shares have already gone and the appeal to join up to get a few
shares is less than pleasing.

One of the very latest ISPs which has just recently opened can be
found at, http://www.4thenet.co.uk and the idea is they pay you for the
time you spend online. You of course do not get all the money back
you paid the phone company but you will get a cheque for a certain
amount every 3 months and the amount on the cheque depends on how
much time you have spent online over those three months. This idea
is taken from the US which already exists but was not available to
customers in the UK until now with a dedicated company for the UK.

I don't know how much money you get exactly and some people may
say that for the amount you get it may not be worth it. I wouldn't
expect you to get much but surely getting paid for something you
would do anyway is a bonus? Why not get paid for doing it no matter
how small the amount is.

As you can see over the last 6 months and more so the last 3 months
alot of ideas have cropped up that give you free calls, free things
and also pay you to spend time online. These are just a few of the
many new schemes that have opened recently in the UK and the more we
get and support ideas like this then I can honestly see unmetered
calls in the UK in the next 6 months to a year. Obviously I can not
say this WILL happen but the many schemes that have opened suggest
we are on the way to unmetered calls.

For now though if you live in the UK and want to support the campaign
to give UK customers unmetered calls then visit,

The vision and mission of Amiga is to make computers and the Internet
a natural part of everyday life, by creating an industry-standard
operating environment for current and future consumer computing
devices that enables a wide range of innovative Internet services.
We use the term "operating environment" purposely, as this software
infrastructure extends the traditional operating system to provide a
host environment for a new class of portable applications
applications that exist in a pervasive networked computing
environment, and provide transparent access to Internet content and
services. In essence, we are defining a new distributed home
computing environment that enables a user experience that is much
more accessible than today's personal computer experience. This
environment will tie together personal computers, information
appliances, set-top boxes, next-generation multimedia convergence
computers and game machines, and a host of other computing devices to
define the next phase in the evolution (revolution!) of computing.

The products under development at Amiga include:

 Amiga Operating Environment (Amiga OE) - a distributed software
 architecture that extends traditional operating systems to provide
 a rich user experience, support for pervasive networking, and a
 framework for portable applications that transparently access
 Internet content and services.  A subset of the Amiga OE,  the
 Amiga Information Appliance Environment,  is portable to a wide
 range of computing devices and information appliances.

Amiga Multimedia Convergence Computer (Amiga MCC) - a
hardware/software platform specifically designed to meld outstanding
multimedia performance, a new level of ease of use, transparent
access to the Internet and, through home networking, access to a
growing family of Amiga-compatible devices around the home.  The
Amiga MCC will be distributed in two formats:  an integrated
multimedia convergence computer, and a standard ATX motherboard.
Both include the Amiga OE, an underlying OS, and support for digital
video/DVD, 3D graphics, surround sound, and emerging broadband and
home networking standards.  The Amiga MCC is intended to serve as
both a great platform for multimedia applications such as 3D gaming
and digital video integration, and as the hub for a next-generation
distributed home computing environment.

Technology Philosophy and Overview

Amiga's long-term business success calls for a combination of
technology innovation, and technology integration. We are
integrating underlying technology components such as next-generation
CPU's, micro-kernel operating systems, graphics and GUI libraries and
frameworks, graphics/video/communications chipsets, wired and
wireless home networking subsystems, and object-based development
environments, in order to focus our resources on technologies that
add unique value to the Amiga Operating Environment. These
value-added technologies include:  user interaction paradigms that
are far simpler, and much more intelligent, than today's personal
computer paradigms; a "virtual appliance" model that allows software
applications to easily migrate to multiple hardware configurations;
support for pervasive and transparent networking and Internet
connectivity; and the underlying AmigaObject architecture that
implements and exposes all of the above.

This short technology brief is intended to provide a very high-level
overview of the development direction and technology choices being
made by Amiga, and will be supported by more in-depth whitepapers and
product documentation as the new Amiga products are introduced in the
marketplace. In this document, we overview:

 Graphics, Multimedia and GUI Frameworks
 Pervasive Networking
 Software Block Diagram
 Amiga MCC Hardware Architecture
 Development Tools and Applications
 AmigaObjects,
 and the Amiga Operating Environment

AmigaObjects are the foundation on which all Amiga Operating
Environment services are built. AmigaObjects provide powerful
component building blocks that allow developers to rapidly create
impressive and powerful Amiga applications. AmigaObjects furthermore
enable integration of a wide variety of different technologies under
one umbrella. Networking is intrinsic to AmigaObjects, which means
that AmigaObjects are free to move around on the network or use
network resources. The AmigaObject architecture by virtue of this
flexibility enables a new class of "net-aware" applications where
there is no clear boundary between a device and the network.

We have chosen Java (Sun Microsystems) as our primary programming
language for portable applications based on AmigaObjects (of course,
C and C++ will also be supported for native MCC applications).  With
Java technologies such as kJava, pJava, Java2 and Java Enterprise
Edition, AmigaObject technology can be embedded in devices as small
as hand-held computers and scale all the way to large servers. This
is a truly revolutionary approach to computing; an approach we
believe will change the face of computing.

The AmigaObject technology serves as the foundation for all objects
in the Amiga Operating Environment. The power and flexibility of the
AmigaObject naturally extends to all other objects in the
environment, thereby giving all objects in the system network
transparency and the ability to proliferate across the network.

As mentioned above, AmigaObjects also integrate other technologies
into our framework. In particular, we make extensive use of as 3rd
party technologies where appropriate. Examples include Java, Jini,
OpenGL and several audio and video codec's. This enables Amiga to
focus its engineering efforts on the AmigaObjects and the Operating
Environment and less on creating technologies that already exist.

Amiga MCC Operating System

One of our convictions is that modern operating systems are just one
component of the new age in computing.  The value proposition is no
longer just the traditional OS, but an overall environment providing
intelligent power and transparent services for the end user. While
the information appliance portion of the Amiga Operating Environment
is portable, and will be ported to a number of operating systems by
Amiga and Amiga's OEM partners over time, we needed to make an OS
foundation decision for the Amiga MCC.

There are a number of very interesting OS choices in the marketplace,
and it is fair to say that we have evaluated them all over the past
year.  From traditional RTOS vendors such as Wind River and QNX, to
BeOS from Be Systems, to Sun's JavaOS built on Chorus, to Linux.  As
has been previously announced, we had been working for some months
with QNX Software Systems to try to adapt the QNX RTOS to the needs
of a next-generation multimedia convergence computer.  At the same
time, we had also been working with key members of the Linux
community to evaluate the pros and cons of Linux. As we focused on
building a successful business proposition, it became apparent to us
that more and more of our technology partners and software vendors
were encouraging us to focus on Linux as our underlying OS kernel.
While we were impressed with some of the technology elements in QNX
(and BeOS and Chorus, for that matter), we felt that it will be
difficult for a proprietary operating system to attract the broad
industry support required to be successful over the coming years.

Linux has been picking up substantial momentum over the past year as
a viable, open alternative to Windows in the marketplace. Over the
past year, Linux usage has more than tripled, with both large vendors
and start-ups adopting Linux as their OS foundation. The growing
commitment to Linux applications from a wide variety of software
vendors, and the growing development and availability of Linux device
drivers from hardware and peripheral suppliers, make it a compelling
choice. Also, as we ported our higher level operating environment
and AmigaObject architecture to Linux, we discovered significant
performance advantages in the Linux kernel in areas such as
distributed object invocation. And, no small advantage, Linux is
probably the most stable operating system available in the market.

For all of these reasons, we have decided to build the
next-generation Amiga MCC platform on top of a Linux OS foundation.
We would be remiss in not acknowledging that there are issues to
overcome with Linux, as there were with all of the other OS choices
we evaluated. For example, there were concerns with TCP/IP
performance, which are being resolved, and concerns about the
required disk and memory footprint. As anyone knows who has looked
at Linux, the overall system is quite large. However, as we build
our OS foundation, we are subsetting Linux to meet our needs, and are
now confident that disk and memory requirements are quite reasonable
(Linux is starting to appear in a wide variety of information
appliance devices, and there is even a version of Linux that runs on
the Palm Pilot!). There are also various other performance issues
with Linux that we are attacking,  as with the original Amiga, we are
tightly binding the OS kernel to a specialized, high-performance
hardware architecture that resolves ma ny of the concerns that we,
and the Amiga community, have had with existing Linux
implementations.  The momentum building behind Linux, and the
resources around the world being applied towards fixing various
issues, gives us confidence that this will turn out in the end to be
the right choice.

Graphics, Multimedia and GUI Frameworks

The technology strategy for graphics involves developing key
partnerships with companies currently producing state-of-the-art
component products. Amiga leverages the development efforts of these
organizations to deliver the product capabilities to Amiga customers.
For example Amiga is working with ATI to incorporate next-generation
3D rendering technology into the MCC (see the Hardware Architecture
section).

The widespread acceptance and momentum of OpenGL makes it the solid
choice as a 3D API to exploit hardware rendering capability. In
addition, the latest Java 2 releases have extended capabilities for
3D scene manipulation, advanced imaging, and overall media
coordination. AmigaObjects are being developed to give users
device-independent control of these various media through Java
objects which in turn access graphics hardware acceleration through
OpenGL whenever possible or appropriate. It is important to
understand that, when discussing AmigaObject or Java access to
hardware-accelerated API's such as OpenGL, care is being taken to
ensure that the higher level software does not "get in the way" when
accessing the underlying hardware.  As with the original Amiga, it is
the tight integration of software and hardware that provides overall
system performance.

The technology strategy for multimedia is essentially analogous to
that for graphics. The hardware delivery system for digital
multimedia may be a 3D graphics engine, a DVD decoder including MPEG
2 and AC-3 digital surround sound, or broadband Internet. For a
complete solution, the underlying hardware must be powerful enough to
both capture and play back audio/video streams. To accomplish this,
Amiga is developing partnerships with the leading hardware
manufacturers of these technologies. AmigaObjects are being developed
to give developers device-independent control through Java. The
Java-based AmigaObjects invoke methods to access appropriate levels
of special hardware assistance and acceleration. In cases where there
is not a widely accepted API such as OpenGL, Amiga and partners are
writing a number of these methods in native code as necessary. As
with 3D, a tight integration of software and hardware will provide
outstanding support for streaming media.

The Information Appliance portion of the Amiga Operating Environment
will be hosted on a wide range of devices, and the interactional
natures of these devices can be expected to differ widely. It would
be foolish to try to design a single interface for a palm-sized
device with a small, touch-sensitive, grayscale display and a
relatively slow wireless network connection; a set-top box with
remote control and TV display; and a traditional, multimedia desktop
computer with full keyboard, mouse, high-resolution monitor, and
broadband networking; it is doubtful that any single design could
meet the needs of the users of all these devices. Instead, we are
implementing a design environment that will insure a clear sense of
consistency of interaction across devices, while respecting the
physical constraints of the device on which a particular interface
appears. We will also minimize the effort to which developers must
go to create virtual appliances able to run on a wide range of
products.

With regard to windowing environments on the Amiga MCC, we are
leveraging a combination of technologies from Linux and Java. At the
lowest level (managing the bits on the screen), we are using the
latest Linux X Windows window system. Most users and developers will
never see X Windows directly (unlike older UNIX systems, when X
Windows was somewhat cumbersome). However, the use of X Windows will
allow both new applications and standard Linux applications to run
seamlessly on the MCC. Sitting above X Windows are a growing number
of window managers that will be available on the MCC, and Java
developers will have access to the portable Java Swing GUI classes
that hide the underlying windowing complexity under a modern
programming model. Finally, there will be a suite of end-user
workspaces, including a new Amiga Workbench being designed at Amiga.
There are already a number of interesting desktop environments
available for Linux, and it is our intent to contribute the Amiga
workbench to the open source move ment, and encourage the creative
Amiga and Linux communities to modify, enhance, replace, and
generally get creative when it comes to next-generation desktop
environments (we believe that one of the disadvantages of today's
Windows and Macintosh personal computers is the "closed" nature of
their desktop environments).

Pervasive Networking

The near future will bring more high-speed broadband Internet service
to homes via cable modems, xDLS and other new technologies. The
industry is standardizing on technologies for home networking, giving
consumers the ability to connect products throughout the home using
standard home wiring and wireless digital high-speed options.

Amiga-enabled products will support these standards and seamlessly
connect to each other while leveraging the entire home through our
distributed object technology. We are integrating emerging standards
such as HomePNA by Broadcom/Epigram into the Amiga Operating
Environment, using standard phone lines in North America homes.
Several initiatives are also being pursued in Europe and Asia, which
we continue to monitor. We are also investigating the front-running
technologies for digital wireless networks for the home environment.
Most regions of the world will standardize on a form of 2.4Ghz
digital wireless networking like that of Proxim's which we will
support as they become adopted by the industry.  With the new Amiga
object technology and integration of these standards, the home will
become "the computer", including seamless high-speed connection to
the Internet.

With AmigaObjects being the foundation for all object services and
supporting distributive processing in the Amiga Operating
Environment, networking naturally becomes pervasive. There is no
distinction between devices (e.g. hard disks) found local to a
computing element or an equivalent device found somewhere on the
network. The Jini technology from Sun Microsystems addresses many of
these problems with an architecture that enables instant connectivity
of devices to the network such as disk drives, printers, scanners,
cameras, etc. We are encapsulating Jini technology for the types of
devices where it works well, and are providing complete AmigaObject
solutions for services not supported effectively by Jini. We'll
provide more details on the pervasiveness of network services at a
later time.

The actual choice of transport is unimportant to the software and
application architecture. We expect to support most of the popular
networking standards, such as Ethernet, modem, HomePNA, HomeRF, IEEE
1394 and other digital high speed networking over time. The only real
issue is one of bandwidth: lower bandwidth connectivity tends to
limit the quality of services that can be offered. As you can see
from the hardware section, we're actively working on providing
high-bandwidth networking in our base system, thereby enabling a new
generation of net-aware applications and products.

Amiga MCC Hardware Architecture

The Amiga MCC is being designed to support state-of-the-art
multimedia while leaving the PC legacy baggage behind. The MCC will
have DVD, high-performance 3D, Ethernet-based home networking,
digital and traditional analog video and audio, and USB ports for
digital peripherals. It will have room for at least 2 hard drives, 2
PCI slots, 7 USB ports and an open drive bay for enthusiast options
such as Zip and Jazz drives.

There is significant momentum for USB (Universal Serial Bus) in the
industry. USB is a digital 2-way interface that supports up to
10Mb/s. This allows game controllers to support high-speed
interactivity, including features such as force feedback so when you
are driving the car the wheel will push back on you.  It allows hot
detection of devices such as keyboards, printers, scanners, cameras,
game controllers, storage devices, etc. In fact, the USB standard
supports up to 127 peripherals on a single port. For this reason we
do not intend to support the legacy serial, parallel, PS/2 or analog
game ports. You can always add USB hubs for more devices, and there
are converters to the old buses (e.g. USB to parallel) for your
legacy peripherals that you might not want to get rid of for a while.
There are even efforts under way to make the next version of USB work
up to 100Mb/s.

The industrial design for the MCC has been done by Pentagram, a
leading worldwide industrial design firm. Several concept sketches
(out of approximately 12 that were considered) have been previously
released, and the final industrial design will be shown at the
upcoming World of Amiga and AmiWest shows.

As the foundation and hub for the Amiga computing revolution, the
Amiga MCC will be delivered in two formats: an integrated computing
system with an attractive industrial design and separate monitor
option; and a standard size ATX format motherboard for systems
vendors, software developers and enthusiasts who want access to MCC
functionality in other configurations with greater expandability.

We have selected a very exciting CPU for the MCC, which is at the
heart of a next-generation processing subsystem. The CPU subsystem
will provide more than just traditional central processing services 
having chosen Linux and Java as two of our fundamental software
building blocks, we wanted a CPU subsystem that could be highly tuned
for a Linux/Java software base, while also running classic Amiga
applications. We are still under strict confidentiality constraints,
and cannot disclose information about the CPU at this time. However,
we believe the selection of this technology will give us a unique
advantage for the Amiga.

As mentioned earlier, the MCC will include a very high-performance 3D
graphics subsystem, support for streaming media integration, and
support for the emerging home networking standards that will become
pervasive over the next two years. Following is a partial list of
features under development in the MCC hardware architecture:

Development Tools and Applications

We are working with several leading development tool and applications
software suppliers to ensure that there are great tools and
applications for the Amiga OE and the Amiga MCC.  One of the key
reasons that we chose Linux for the underlying operating system of
the MCC is the tremendous growth in Linux-based tools and
applications, many of which will be available for the Amiga MCC.
Similarly, our choice of Java for the Amiga OE was partly driven by
the fact that there are some very powerful Linux-based Java
development environments that are either already shipping, or will be
shipping over the coming months. The Amiga MCC will instantly be one
of the best-selling Linux-based systems in the marketplace, and it is
the intent of Amiga and its partners to ensure that these tools are
available on the MCC.

Obviously, we are not at liberty to disclose the release plans of
other companies. As we move closer to the Amiga OE and Amiga MCC
ship dates, companies developing applications and tools for the new
Amigas will announce their own plans to release software for the
Amiga.

Summary

We believe that the Amiga Operating Environment will power a wide
range of next-generation computing devices. The Amiga MCC as the
foundation, will set the standard for multimedia convergence
computers in the emerging home computing environment.

This brief in no way documents all that is happening at Amiga. We
have several exciting things in development that we would like to
disclose to the community and will as our partners will allow. The
decisions that are being made are focused on the future while keeping
our eyes on today and yesterday. Hopefully this brief has given you
an insight to our direction.

The Eagle (or Amiga) Has Landed, At Last! - By Mark A. Tierno
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well folks, history is going to repeat itself- this time in a Good way.
What happened in 1985 is going to happen again- this time in a lot more
noticeable way.

First let me say, that reading the tech brief- even though it does not
yet merntion what the CPU will be- is like reliving an old episode of
the Jetsons, except this time it's real-life. The big furour over Linux
vs QNX is completely unnecessary as it's such a small component of the
whole thing. That said, let's move on.

Amiga's aim is to make a virtual computer with an Operating Environment,
wherein the "computer" will be everything with an electric current in
your house... and car, and cell phone, and Internet. The Amiga Object
is a software structure that will make not only programming easier but
will act as cross-platform building blocks out of which you can build
you drivers, interfaces, and what-not for any new hardware (including
stuff that may come out not even yet envisioned) you may want to
integrate into your system without a rewrite of the OS. It uses Java and
Jini, with C and C++ for native apps, but fully Amiga optimized for the
MCc versions (yes, it looks like they've improved Java).  With Amiga
Objects, the system is ready to create virtual devices and new
interfaces, and support all manner of networking and wireless
technologies.

Yes, you heard me right. Wireless. Your cellphone could be integrated in
as part of your home system.  Furthermore, the difference between say a
local hard drive and your networked home security system is NILL; both
will be as easy to access. The home computer will be the hub of a
distributed home computing network- and not even MicroSloth has anything
in the works that can come close to this!

The hardware will be available as both an ATX motherboard and the
Multimedia Convergence Computer, with ports for just about everything.
E-IDE, 2 PCI slots, an open bay for ZIP or whatever, a place for your
choise of floppy replacement, DVD, Ethernet, and Firewire. There's 7 USB
ports to replace serial, parallel, mouse and game ports, but fear not
for adapters will be available for USB to old style stuff (like
parallel).  In fact, the only hookup NOT mentioned was SCSI (my personal
preference).  Throw in a minimum of 2 hard drives and it's looking pretty
good.

Graphics? Try ATI doing 3D with a list of stuff that would give PC Power
Gamers wet-dreams, including 32MB of SDRAM for just the graphics; system
RAM will be another 32MB expandable possibly up to a Gigabyte.

As far as Linux, they are using it for the kernel- a very small part of
the OS.  But not just off the shelf linux, they plan on optimizing it
for our favorite Ami. They're going to Amiga-fy Linux, sortof reinvent
it for our own needs (we just aren't happy unless we optimize
everything we lay our hands on, aren't we?). Linux was chosen because,
among the technical reasons, it just semes that everyone's writing
drivers and stuff for it, a distinct advantage for our return. There are
plenty of tools available for Linux already, even some linux-based Java
stuff. If we want to fight vertain big powers at their own game, linux
does seem the best way to go.

Now we come to my favorite part. It seems that they were actually
listening to our dream-machine wishes. The original multimedia computer
with the native analogue signal is finally going to get some analogue
outputs as standard! Well,... that, and (author takes deep inhale of
breath)... analogue video and audio, TV outputs and digitization,
S-Video, FULL channel TV-tuner, 44KHz 16-bit CD stereo input and output,
Dolby output, and possibly even a FM radio tuner.

All this, as STANDARD.

(waits while the reader gets over his shock enough to read on).

Now, me, I don't care What the other guys have brewing, this will beat
the pants off it. It goes so far beyoind just another speed increase or
new CPU that it kind of makes everything else look like pocket
calculators; and that's without even yet knowing what the CPU of choise
will be.

So, for my money, I think the Amiga's finally come back and is ready to
charge straight into the market like a bull in heat over a baby lamb. I
think it's time that Eric Schwartz broke out his pen and ink for a new
picture again, because we're going past "We're Back" and well into
"and we're taking over!"

this new AmigaSoftTM OE to the O/S 3.5 recommended hardware
configurations. If we can accomplish this it will allow people to run
the new OE on specific Amiga configurations with PowerPC boards.

3) AmigaSoftTM development system. This is planned in late 3Q99
along with the beta release of the new AmigaSoftTM Operating
Environment.

4) Amiga Multimedia Convergence Computer (MCC): -  We have finalized
our industrial design and created foam models. -  The next mechanical
design step is hard models. These will be available for WoA and
AmiWest. -  We have initiated final schematics of the system board
design.

Shows and Community Activities:

1) We held a telephone conference with the Amiga press to bring them
up to speed on our plans.

2) We received all of the nominations for Amiga Advisory Council
(AAC) members. We will be notifying the top nominated members for
approval in the next week. First AAC conference call should occur
within two weeks.

3) We initiated multiple Amiga hosted forums accessible though our
Amiga website.

4) We will sponsor and participate in the 1999 London World of Amiga
show in late July.

5) We are also planning to support the AmiWest show in late July.

6) We are planning for the Cologne and Las Vegas shows in November.

Dear Amigans,

The next computer revolution is on the horizon. It is a revolution
that will unleash the full power of computers to the masses and
finally fulfill the promises of the information age. It will create a
new class of computing devices that combine power and simplicity to
make computers and the Internet a natural part of everyday life. They
will be exciting enough for the enthusiast and yet simple enough for
the common person. They will work seamlessly together in a highly
integrated operating environment encompassing the home, business, and
the world through the Internet. This is the future of computing and
the reason why we can't only develop an alternative computer
platform. Faster CPUs and faster graphics alone will not drive a
revolutionary new computer platform.  They are important but not
revolutionary. Revolutionary thinking requires us to let go of past
preferences and envision a future that doesn't currently exist. It
requires us to develop technology and functions that enable this
future vision. This i s the spirit of revolutionary innovation. The
same spirit that drove the original Amiga development team.

We need the support of the Amiga community to drive this revolution.
The Amiga community is one of the most heroic, passionate, and
innovative communities left in the computer industry. We need these
attributes to succeed because we have charted a bold course. Like
heroic explorers in the past, we can't discover a new continent
without losing sight of the old one for a long period of time. This
makes some people very uncomfortable and anxious but it is a
prerequisite of discovery and innovation. Some of you will feel
compelled to jump ship and swim for familiar shores before we sail
out of site. Most of you will stay for the excitement of the journey
and the reward of discovery. For those of you who are staying with
the ship, tie down the hatches and get ready for the future.

Before you read the technology brief there are a few concepts that
will help you put it in perspective. One is a high-level view of the
Amiga Operating Environment (OE). Instead of thinking of a single
computer with hardware and an operating system, I would like you to
start thinking about multiple computing devices integrated together
into a single large "virtual" computer and an "operating environment"
or OE to run this "virtual" computer. The OE seamlessly integrates
multiple computing devices into a single, integrated, and seamless
operating environment. Like the OS for a large "virtual" computer.
The OE includes the OS for single computing devices but it also runs
the overall "virtual" computer consisting of multiple computing
devices networked together.  Every connected computing device is both
a building block and a window into this computing environment.

The other concept to understand is AmigaObject. The AmigaObject is a
powerful software structure used to access computing functions and
capabilities. AmigaObjects are the main structures used to implement
the Amiga OE. They enable easy integration of technology, distributed
computing, high-speed network transactions, and communication between
applications in the OE. They are powerful software building blocks
that will allow people to build impressive applications quickly.
AmigaObjects are portable and transferable across platforms allowing
AmigaObjects to proliferate throughout the network and the Internet.
Since AmigaObjects are transferable and accessible over the Internet,
you can easily extend the Amiga OE through the Internet. This will
become critical as broadband Internet access becomes more and more
prevalent in the future. AmigaObjects are implemented using Java and
Jini technology but are specifically optimized to implement the Amiga
OE. AmigaObjects will allow us to build our revolutionary computer
platform.

The attached technology brief gives you some more detail on the next
generation Amiga. Before you read it, I have to strongly emphasize
that we have not released some of the most strategic parts of our
vision and technology. The vision of how our technology unleashes the
power of computing in the future is compelling. Unfortunately,
communicating the complete vision at this time would jeopardize our
competitive advantage and business success, especially if we released
this information on our web site. I hope you can understand how
important it is for us to keep certain strategic information from our
competitors. I can only say that all of the few people who have seen
our full vision have been extremely impressed. It is compelling and
will drive the future of computing. I look forward to sharing more
strategic details on the vision in the months to come starting at WoA
and AmiWest.

Sincerely,
Jim Collas
President, Amiga

DOpus Tutorial, Part 3 - By Mark A. Tierno
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well it's Part 3 and this month we're going over a few of the more
useful addons available for DOpus. Not just things that will interface
with your favorite program or CD Player, but the types that become a
nearly integral part of your DOpus workday. These are little scripts
and modules that you will find nearly impossible to get along without.

The first one is ArcDir.Dopus5, available on Aminet by Edmund Vermeulen
(edmundv@xs4all.nl). I'll leave the installation for the docs (nothing
too brain bending) but once set up, when you double click on an LHA or
LZX archive it brings up the archive's contents in a standard DOpus
lister. This allows you to do the full copy/move/view/read/whatever to
any files in the archive through the same methods as other normal
listers. Definitely more convenient, especialluy if you're like me and
download stuff from Aminet nearly every day. There is an updated
version of the program by  Frédéric Falempin (spectref@minitel.net)
that adds in suppport for ZIP and TGZ archives as well, but I'm not sure
if that's been uploaded to Aminet yet; you may have to email someone
about it.

Opus CutnPaste is another handy one for day to day use, available on
Aminet or at http://www.halsteadk.freeserve.co.uk/cutnpaste. This one adds in
an additional menu item when you click on the edge of your lister for
the pop-up menu. Starting with Copy and Cut, it will act on the file
highlighted, cutting or copying it to Clipboard. After that, you go to
whichever other lister you want, make it Source, and his the lister
pop-up menu again. Now you'll see a few added things like Paste, Paste
As, View Clipboard, and Clear Clipboard. All self explanatory and rather
good for adding yet another way of moving your files around.

Finally, everyone's RAM: tends to get cluttered from time to time,
usually from unarchiving files. While it's possible to go to RAM: with a
lister and then manually highlight every files that isn't T:, ENV:, or
Clipboards:, a script can make things easier.  There are two scripts
out there for this. CleanRam'dopus, by Mark Dyer
(mark@permaban.demon.co.uk), will take the current Source lister, switch
it to RAM:, highlight everything that isn't the above three directories
or their icon files, and offer you the chance to have it delete them or
not, giving you the chance to un-select any files you don't want to
keep. After it deletes the files, it returns your Source lister to the
original directory that it was viewing.

The other Ram-clearing script is ClearRAM v1.1 by Steve "Lightning" Masterson. Same
sort of function but without all the bells and whistles; it just simply
deletes everything in RAM: not connected with T:, ENV:, or Clipboards:.
In fact, it's just a one-line script you could probably figure out
yourself.

These are some basic essentials you should look into, all of which are
available on Aminet, and all with complete docs and easy enough to
install.

One little add-on written in about by reader Colin Clark is CycleMode by D.Clarke
({link http://home.connexus.net.au/~4wd/). Basically it allows you a hot-key
that will cycle from List Mode to Icon Mode to Icon Action Mode for a
given lister everytime the hot-key is pressed. A nice little convenience
if you don't want to right mouse button it all the time, though there
is a slight delay as it calls up and runs the script everytime you
press the hot-key.

If you have any favorite DOpus add-ons yourself, or any other useful
DOpus tricks and tips our readers might be insterested in, then just
email me, your friendly neighborhood Articles Editor.

Jim Collas Executive Update - By Jim Collas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It looks like Jim Collas is staying true to his word, because here's
another open letter from the man himself...

Executive Update
· ·  OPEN LETTER TO THE COMMUNITY
June/July 1999
 Copyright by AMIGA
Dear Amigans,

I apologize for posting my June (now June/July) letter so late. I was
ready to post it last week, but decided to scrap it and re-write it
this past weekend for several reasons. One reason is feedback I
received from the Amiga community. To better understand the desires
of the Amiga community, I have been following many of the Amiga
public forums (in addition to reading the thousands of emails sent to
me). I have posted in a few of the forums when I felt it was
important to clarify information relative to Amiga's plans.  In the
"comp.sys.amiga.misc" forum I posted a message requesting feedback on
our strategy and plans.  The post is in the thread titled "Collas and
LeFaivre thanks for talking".  I received many good insights and
suggestions in response to my post, but while reading these responses
one thing was clear: I haven't given the Amiga community enough
information to clearly understand our plans. The community still
doesn't have a clear understanding of our product plans, and what we
mean by the term "operating environment."  This is obviously not the
fault of the community but mine in not communicating enough
information. This is why I decided to scrap my original letter and
address this issue.

In the past several months, I have attempted to disclose as much as
possible to the Amiga community without disclosing too much to our
competition or violating confidentiality agreements with our
technology partners. I don't think I have been effective at striking
the right balance in this regard, so I just initiated an activity to
disclose more of our plans. We are putting together a five to seven
page product strategy and technology brief that will be released to
the Amiga community within the next week. This brief will help you
better understand our overall plans by giving you more details on our
new Amiga Operating Environment (OE) and Multimedia Convergence
Computer (MCC). The technology brief will also talk about new and
exciting Amiga technology. I will talk a bit more about some of this
technology later in this letter.

This brief will also disclose some of our 3rd party technology
choices. We have spent the last four months evaluating technology and
defining the next generation hardware architecture and software
structure. We have now finalized the architecture and structure. We
have also finalized all of our major technology and partner choices.
A significant amount of effort and resources went into the evaluation
of 3rd party technology you may be surprised at a few of the
decisions but I am confident you will agree that they are the correct
choices.

Before you read the brief you should understand that we are still not
at liberty to disclose all of the details of our plans. I don't want
to disclose too much to potential competitors and we are under
confidentiality agreements with our key technology partners. Within
those boundaries we will disclose as much as we can. The difficult
part about not being able to disclose everything is that some
decisions don't seem to make sense unless you have all of the
information. We have no choice but to work around this for now.

As background information for the technology brief I would also like
to discuss the concept of revolutionary products and our strategy for
implementing the next generation Amiga.

REVOLUTIONARY PRODUCTS:

rev·o·lu·tion·ary ("re-v&-'lü-sh&-"ner-E): adjective; 1 c:
constituting or bringing about a major or fundamental change in the
way of thinking about or visualizing something: a change of paradigm
<a revolutionary new product>

The original Amiga was revolutionary because it drove a fundamental
change in computer graphics performance, capabilities, and overall
value. It allowed people to do things that couldn't be done with
other systems at the time. It moved computers a big step into the
future by fundamentally changing the way people viewed and used
computers. The next generation Amiga must do the same but in the
context of the present computer industry. Faster CPUs and faster
graphics alone will not drive a revolutionary new computer platform.
They are important but not revolutionary. Revolutionary thinking
requires us to let go of past preferences and envision a future that
doesn't currently exist. It requires us to develop technology and
functions that enable this future vision. This is the spirit of
revolutionary innovation. The same spirit that drove the original
Amiga development team.

The problem is that revolutionary paradigm shifts are difficult to
envision before they occur. Let me give you an example. When I was in
college, I had a job as a software developer programming video games
for the Atari  2600, Commodore64, and Apple II (This was before the
first Amiga came out). At the current time, all video games were
programmed in assembly language. This was great at the time because
it gave you complete control of the hardware. I couldn't imagine
programming a game in a high-level language such as C++ because it
would be so incredible inefficient. It just seemed like an
unrealistic proposition. Well, the world changed. You can't manage
the complexity or extravagance of today's games in assembly. You need
sophisticated tools and a high-level language like C++. This was a
revolutionary paradigm shift that was hard to envision years before
it happened.

Keep this section in mind as you read the technology brief that will
be released. It is not enough to bring out an incremental product. It
must be revolutionary in order for all of us to succeed. You must
think in a different dimension to understand the revolutionary nature
of the next generation Amiga environment. The technology brief will
help you understand this future vision.  I look forward to getting
your continuing feedback on our directions.

PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:

Our strategy for implementing the new Amiga is to integrate the best
technology in the industry into a new, efficient, exciting, and
revolutionary computer platform focused on the future. It is
important to understand this strategy so that you can better
understand some of our decisions. The computer industry today is much
different than it was when the first Amiga was designed. The initial
Amiga was designed when the computer industry was at its infancy. The
computer industry has now matured and the dynamics have changed
significantly. The industry is replete with companies developing and
supplying great technology and components. As an example, there are
many excellent companies offering sophisticated high-performance 3D
graphics chips. All of these companies have one goal in mind: to
develop and ship the best 3D graphics solution. These graphics
companies have many world-class engineers. Trust me, I know these
companies well. To think that we could design our own 3D graphics
chip that was better is not re asonable. This is why all leading
computer companies (IBM, Compaq, Gateway, Apple, et al.) now depend
on 3rd party graphics companies. It was clear to them that internal
resources couldn't compete with companies specialized in this area.
This is the normal cycle of a maturing industry and is the reason why
we can't think in the past when creating a revolutionary product for
the future.

Does this mean that the Amiga won't be unique or lead in performance?
Absolutely not! Firstly, you shouldn't define performance by
exclusively using narrow benchmarks of today's industry. We need to
focus on addressing the next computer revolution rather than
competing with the last one. Secondly, an extremely efficient
architecture will make the most out of commonly used components like
3D graphics chips. We can get remarkably impressive performance by
coupling an industry leading PCI/AGP graphics chip to the extremely
efficient architecture of the new Amiga. On the CPU side we have
selected a CPU that will bring exciting new capabilities to the
Amiga. I can't disclose what instruction set it uses at this time
because of confidentiality agreements. I can tell you that it's very
exciting and NOT an x86 architecture processor. Our plan is to
disclose the CPU in several weeks at the World of Amiga and AmiWest
shows. At this time I hope to disclose all of our technology choices
and partners.

In order to pull this great technology together and develop our
next-generation platform, we are also developing our own technology
in key strategic areas. This technology will allow us to make the
product unique, integrate 3rd party technology and create the final
revolutionary product. For example,

A TEASER:

The technology brief will also include the description of new Amiga
technology that I think is particularly exciting. It is an
object-oriented technology developed by Amiga called the
AmigaObjectTM. The AmigaObjectTM is a powerful software structure
that enables easy integration of technology, distributed computing,
high-speed network transactions, and communication between
applications. They are also powerful software building blocks that
will allow people to build impressive applications quickly.
AmigaObjectsTM are portable and transferable across platforms
allowing AmigaObjectsTM to proliferate throughout the network, the
Internet and the world. Do I have your attention yet? This is just
one piece of the new Amiga operating environment. It is this type of
technology that will allow us to build a revolutionary computer
platform. We can discuss this technology because we have now filed
patent disclosures giving us some protection against competitors.
More on this in the technology brief.

IN SUMMARY:

The upcoming technology brief will be released early next week. While
it will of necessity be at a fairly high level, it will still be the
most comprehensive description to date of the new Amiga product and
operating environment. I think it will go a long way in helping you
understand Amiga's future and the new products. I am very excited
about releasing this information and getting your response. After you
read it, I think you will agree that Amiga and the Amiga community
has a chance of driving the next computer revolution.

Sincerely,

Jim Collas
President, Amiga

Amiga FAQ - By Shawn McOwen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Q: One of the questions people ask is, what is AMIGA ?

A: Unfortunately due to no marketing since 1990 people of the younger
generation never heard of AMIGA . It will soon be 10 that's one whole
generation plus countless other half, third ,etc... generations never
hearing of AMIGA . I'm here to change that and so are countless other
people including Gateway. If you did hear of AMIGA we never refer to
AMIGA as "it" , <Blasphemy>. AMIGA is referred to as a human being
because first and foremost AMIGA acts like a human being hence never
"it". We call her AMIGA - GIRLFRIEND in SPANISH -rather nice and unique
. AMIGA is userable friendly. Plus you may have caught me saying "we"
that's because when you get an AMIGA you are part of a NUCLEAR FAMILY
that is creative as well as smart, yeah true one in the same. You can't
ever find this loyalty except in family -hence we are part of ONE BIG
FAMILY. We even have our own Logo and a band plus a CD a national
ANTHEM if you will.

Back to the question at hand. The AMIGA is a REAL-TIME MULTITASKING
system with REAL MULTIMEDIA. AMIGA uses advanced arch. Called Direct
Access Arch.(DAA). Simply put Motorola uses it and Intel , SGI ,Mac and
the rest including gamestations use bus arch. This same bus arch. That
Motorola used in the 50's. Intel and the rest are copying Motorola's
old arch basically verbatim. This makes them old and obsolete from the
get go. At least 40 year old technology. With the newer technology and
having DAA as the motherboard the AMIGA is faster and also having True
32bit, 64bit, 128bit. This allows for true RISC accessing Where as the bus
arch. Side is limited to 4bit-sound(92voices), 8bit-video(256colors at
one time),16bit bus arch. True the SGI uses 16bit video but why pay that
much more- $15,000. When at that price I can have a Video Toaster
FLYER( The AMIGA that makes all sfx and movies) plus several PowerPc
chips going at 750mhz real-time 2gigs of ram plus other needed stuff.
This brings us to the Price. The avg. price is $1500 or $450( this one
is basically a games machine that can control the security of your house
and get on the Internet!). The A1200 the cheap but expandable AMIGA .

Q: What is Real-time Multitasking?

A: It is when an Item has more then one processing unit or brain in this
case specialized to do each there own thing . The human brain has that ,
but the main difference is that all are built into one. The AMIGA has
several "brains" each programed to do there own thing plus ease the
"stress" load on the main brain or "CPU". Pcs, Macs, SGIs, gamestations, 
palmtop computers have one CPU. Therefore AMIGA is the only one that can
multitask. Why do we need it hum.. you always ask that question before
but yet answered by saying I want my computer to do this without waiting
for this program or run this and download several files at once. That
is something only the AMIGA can do. That is called Multitasking.

Q: What is Multimedia?

A: It is when Video, voice over ,sfx are combined into one without
adding any hardware or software. But I have a cdrom player so I have
multimedia. My dear friend so does a stereo and its not considered
multimedia. - Combining all forms of MEDIA into one package.

Q: Since the AMIGA is the lacreme of the lacreme why doesn't the AMIGA
cost more?

A: Henry Ford - ring a bell, several people making the same computer
-plus its made the same "way" a PC is made only better technology. The
parts are cheap to because they have been around since the AMIGA was
made in 1984.

Some finer more points of the AMIGA computer

1. When adding older CISC chips we can "patch " them together or Risc
several CISC chips together for a faster betterAMIGA.

2. When we add a more powerful CPU i.e. 32bit to 64bit the AMIGA becomes
faster in all areas and the AMIGA is automatically a 64bit system
likewise for anything else as well as software.

3. The OS (operating System ) can multitask in only 256k and the OS only
takes up 6megs of hardrive space.

4. Real-time Multitasking is when you are able to do 2 or more things
with as little as ram possible but yet operate fast and efficently as
possible. I.E... format the floppy, get on the internet and download
several files at once, and also upload several files at once, and then
go on and do your wordprocessing while making an image in the
background(rendering).
                  
How did I help?

Way back in 1995 when Gateway was advertising the Destination computer
and touting its capabilities. I called Gateway and got ahold of Jim
Collas (now President of AMIGA then Vice President of Gateway) and
TedWaite , President of Gateway. I told them that I represented AMIGA
yeah but so does anybody that owns one. The point is that I said that
you could be sued and to say that you were the first When the AMIGA is
the first Destination style computer. It has now become liable and for
you to claim as such so you need to buy out AMIGA , and I said that with
a major emphasis on buyout. No sooner had I said that then the
destination commercial that was on was cut off and a stupid old
commercial was put on. Since that time there has been no real
Destination commercials and AMIGA was bought out from GATEWAY with the
express purpose of updating to the AMIGA platform. Hence the two year
upgrade policy they now advertise. Soon the Look and feel will be
different.That will be because there is an AMIGA inside no Intel nor any
other PC piece of crap.

From : Jose Manuel Azevedo <treme@esoterica.pt>

    Hi...My name it's jose azevedo and i am writing cause I LOVE always and
forever Amiga, but unfortunally here in Portugal almost nobody uses an
Amiga.
    Firstival I like to thanks to all of you and beg for apologise cause i
not have a good english and for this long letter....i think you are (like
Amiga's) simply the best...
    I am using a Pc, through the Net, but in my Room i have 2 Amiga's - 1200
and an Amiga Cd 32...
    I am so unhappy cause i loved my first Amiga 500, but i sold it to buy
A1200, but my confusion started in there...First i ask for my friends who
know's better Amigas than me, if is possible to mount an HD in 1200...they
say me yes, and the next question was if it's possible to mount a Cd in it
too... the same question yes...
    More and more and i finish to mount an HD 120 Mg and Cd 4 speed, more
memory ( i think 32 mg) and for finish a coprocess 68030 for Blizzard...
    Now i rarely use this computer cause I do not know how to use the
software in there...and i think it's Workbench 3.1.
    My 2nd A1200 it's stoped and it's in a box...no extra ram, no extra Hd
...no nothing..
    My ACD32...it's no nothing too... :-(
    But know...i remember to search through the Net and I find you !!! For
God Sake !!
In the last year i was in London, but unfortunally i didn't found nothing
about Amigas !! it is possible ??? Now i think, I am seeing a little light
at the end of the tunnel, and I am totally surprised to found you...
    My friends told me that with the A1200 I can't play games that I love so
much, like shadow of the beast 1,2,3...Hybris...and so many others that i
never forget...because A1200 it's 100 % compatible with A500...there is
anyway to make it 100 % compatible ?? there is anyway to i learn how to
Install a great operating system in the Amiga 1200 with the HD ??
    How operating System you invite me to buy ?? And A500 converter ?? It is
possible to me for have great pleasure like in the golden days ?? Could you
give to me some adresses to buy Games, demos, cd's for Amiga ??
    I was buying Amiga Format, CU Amiga, but unfortunally the sales man told
me that magazines have finished....is it true ?? I only have lot's of Cd's
for those mags, but unfortunally i can't explore them 100 %, why....probs
with my Workbench ??
    I saw in those Cd's things like Mui, MagicWB, and more lots of  things
but i do not know how to operate them...could you tell me why ??
    I also saw Directory opus...it was a friend of mine that install those
thing in there, but unfortunally it missed in the pallette (i think it is in
the Hd), but i think if you could help me maybe i can format the Hd and
start for myself since the beggining, cause when i buy all the extra things
for my A1200, i gave it to my best friend to him install me Workbench,
Directory Opus...and more things for Cd's mags, cause my lack of time. But
for me, Amiga it's like a drug and i cannot forget never it, but please,
please, please.... HELP ME !!!!!!!

Sorry for this long and terrible letter, but i miss Amiga so much.... I am
like a Desesperated person....sorry....

A big Hug...very very Big... !!!

See ya !!!
:-) - Happy face

I have replied to this letter personally letting him know all the details
he requires but if anyone in Portugal is reading them maybe you can
contact him to help him with matters regarding the Amiga in Portugal.
