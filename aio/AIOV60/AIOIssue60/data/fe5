Hot off the presses from Amiga is the official list thus far of Amiga
dealers, or more specifically, those dealers who have  ordered
AmigaOne boards for demonstartion and familiarization.  Any other
dealers who wish to distribute the Eyetech AmigaOne boards can join
their dealer mailing list at "a1dealerapp@eyetech.co.uk". Other dealers
can apply to join the program subject to minimum techincal
and commerical requirements as the end user boards are released.

Amiga's distribution policy for all AmgaOne dealers is as follows
(quoting from Amiga):{p}
"The AmigaOne board is to be 'open availability' - that is available at
the same price and under the same conditions to any bona fide Amiga 
dealer worldwide. There will be no territorial 'exclusives' either in 
the UK or elsewhere."{p}
...{p}
"All dealers, whether existing competitors, partners or otherwise, of 
any of the manufacturing consortium, will be able to buy the AmigaOne 
at exactly the same price as Eyetech's retail division does. This will 
ensure wide availability and price competition amongst the dealers and 
the best deal for end users. The only constraint on dealers is that 
each dealer will need to buy boards in minimum quantities of units, 
cash with order, and have at least one physical, named person able to 
support end users who buy the product. Dealer margins at recommended 
end user prices are sufficient for the dealers to be able to provide 
this level of support."[p}
"The manufacturing consortium will sell bare boards to dealers, for 
them to add their own SDRAM, I/O & graphics cards, cases, storage
etc."{p}
{p}"Individual dealers will have the option of what specification to buy
from us. We expect that most dealers will sell both the AmigaOne 
boards and fully towered, ready to roll systems. They will be able to 
buy an ATX tower of their choice, or one from the special range we 
have commissioned from Naya Design. If they wish to sell a system with 
an AmigaOne and A1200 integrated in the same case (necessary to run 
non-retargetable applications under OS4) our EZTower Mk5 (which is 
available at trade oprices to dealers) is probably the most suitable, 
ready made solution. As far as Eyetech's retail operations are 
concerned we will certainly offering both 'board-only' upgrades and 
custom built ready-to-run systems."
