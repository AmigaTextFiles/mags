Message on the AWeb mailing list from the Author below....

I regret that I haven't got the time to continue development of
the AWeb browser. Bringing the browser up to date to today's
standards (like support for CSS) would take more time than
can be justified by the remaining Amiga market.
{pp}
I like to express my thanks to the Amiga community for using
my browser. In return I will release the source code of AWeb,
so others in the Amiga community have a chance to continue
development.
