Hi,
{pp}
starting with V45.1 (29.6.02), the datatypes akJFIF/PNG/TIFF are
Freeware. The keyfile code and some other legacy stuff
has been removed. This also may speed things up, since there
are less special cases to be covered.
{pp}
Furthermore, a couple of different optimizations in the 68k code
have been made, some bugs were fixed and some amithlon/uae-
specific optimizations have been made.

    akJFIF-dt.LHA{p}
    akPNG-dt.LHA{p}
    akTIFF-dt.LHA
{pp}
These datatypes now are specifically targeted to high-end
68k machines and their emulated counterparts.
