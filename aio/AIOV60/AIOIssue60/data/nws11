The USB card HIGHWAY is available now. KDH Datentechnik has delivered
the HIGHWAY board to customers and Amiga dealers who did pre-order
the HIGHWAY card. The scope of delivery includes the USB Stack
Poseidon. The currently supported USB devices are listed here.
KDH offers you at a special bundle price the Memorycard-writer/reader
