The AmigaOneG3-SE
{pp}
The first model in our AmigaOne range is the AmigaOneG3-SE. This is in
effect a 600Mhz G3 Amiga accelerator with built in 10/100 ethernet, USB,
PCI/AGP interface and memory slots for up to 2GB of SDRAM. As well as
being many times more powerful and at (UKP350/USD500/Euro600*) around half
the price of the previously most powerful Amiga PPC accelerator (the phase
5 Cyberstorm PPC 604 240MHz).
{pp}
In fact you can regard the AmigaOneG3-SE as a high performance accelerator
that comes with a free, built in computer! This means that you no longer
need an attached A1200 or special tower case if you only intend to run
retargetable Amiga applications. (For hardware-hitting applications an
interface card to connect an Amiga 1200 motherboard to the A1G3-SE a PCI
card interface will be available from Escena). The A1G3-SE also comes with
a full range of legacy peripherals, and will run PPC Linux (and PPC UAE)
in addition to running the new PPC-only OS4 natively.
{pp}
The AmigaOneG3-SE will not be shipped to end users until OS4 is ready, but
boards for OS4 developers and beta testers are already out in the field.
Amiga Inc, Hyperion and ourselves have also decided to bundle OS4 directly
with the boards which we ship to dealers, mainly to reduce shipping and
handling costs - and that has resulted in a small overall price reduction
to end users of the A1G3-SE + OS4 bundle to ukp 382.94*. There will be
equivalent reductions on the dollar and euro prices of the bundle to
usd550* and euro652.50*.
{pp}
Finally it is important to note that the AmigaOneG3-SE is fully
quality-validated and licensed by Amiga Inc to run OS4, with all licence
fees/royalties paid. AI's licence terms also stipulate that all boards
capable of running OS4 must ship with an OEM version of OS4 and must have
built-in hardware protection to keep OS4 piracy to a minimum, and this has
been built into the AmigaOneG3-SE from the outset.
{pp}
A list of dealers who have already ordered demonstration / familiarisation
boards is posted on our web site (www.eyetech.co.uk/amigaone/dealers.php).
Don't worry if your favourite dealer is not listed - several have either
missed the ordering window or decided to wait until the end user boards
and OS4 is shipping. These dealers will be added to the list on our
website at the time they order end user boards from us.
{pp}
Although we are advertising the A1G3-SE as an entry-level machine, have no
doubt with OS4 installed it will really fly. The 600Mhz 750CXe cpu that is
shipped with it is effectively that fastest G3 cpu generally available and
some PPC experts reckon it is likely to deliver several hundred times the
performance of an '030/50 with many applications.

Planning for the next AmigaOne - the AmigaOne-XE
{pp}
We have always said that the AmigaOneG3-SE was to be the first, entry
level, board in a range of AmigaOne boards which we have planned to
produce. Many people have asked us to give some outline details of what we
have planned for later boards in the series. So here is a taster.
The next AmigaOne board we have planned is for an up-market (read more
flexible but more expensive) addition to the range. Further details will
be published here and on the AmigaOne mailing list at Yahoogroups at the
appropriate time (but not before!).
{pp}
One of the prime requirements is to provide a socketed cpu module so that
user-upgradable performance enhancements can be made as and when faster
and more complex chips - and operating system enhancements that use them -
become available. Our engineers do not believe that the Intel Slot-1
socket (as planned for the original AmigaOne-1200) is really suitable
because of the need to minimise trace lengths between cpu and SDRAM memory
at higher clock speeds. In addition both the Intel Slot-1 socket and the
Apple ZIF cpu socket are now obsolete and therefore not a sensible choice
for a new product not yet launched.
{pp}
So for the next version of the AmigaOne, the AmigaOne-XE, we have borrowed
the latest cpu socket technology from Apple in the form of the
purpose-designed ‘Megarray’ socket. This means that we can make low cost,
tightly coupled cpu modules using either G3, G4, dual G4, (and possibly G5
- but information on the G5 is still very sparce) technology - for use on
the same AmigaOne-XE motherboard. Upgrading cpu power therefore only needs
a simple module exchange. The prototype socketed AmigaOne-XE board and the
associated plug-in G3 and G4 modules have already been built and tested.
But before you rush off and cancel your pending AmigaOneG3-SE orders to
buy the AmigaOne-XE instead, bear in mind that this extra flexibility will
come at a price, and until OS4 supports the G4’s Altivec coprocessor,
without much performance benefit either. And at the moment, unless you are
Apple, G4 cpu’s are on very tight allocation, which means that it will be
several months before they are available to anyone other than Apple at a
reasonable price. At the moment the target price for the AmigaOne-XE board
with the single G4 700MHz cpu module is around UKP200/USD300/Euro350* more
than the AmigaOneG3-SE - and possibly less if Apple's demand for these
cpu's drops significantly when the G5 starts shipping.
{pp}
So does this mean you should cancel your existing AmigaOne-G3 order and
wait a few more months? Not at all. We anticipate a high private resale
value of used AmigaOneG3-SE boards, but to take the uncertainty out of the
process, we, and the majority of other AmigaOne dealers, will underwrite a
trade-in value of your AmigaOneG3-SE during a period of 6 and 12 months
after its purchase against the purchase of a new AmigaOne-XE with single
G4 cpu module. (You are of course still at liberty to sell the board
privately for a higher price!).
{pp}
This trade-in will be at 75% of the current retail price of an A1G3-SE 6
months after its purchase falling by 1% per month (to 69%) at 12 months
after its purchase. The board must be traded in to the original dealer
where it was purchased, by the original purchaser, be in full working
condition and be used as part payment against an AmigaOne-XE with a single
G4 cpu module. Individual dealers may also opt to have their own trade-up
scheme instead, so please check with them when making your original
purchase. Finally this offer does not apply in conjunction with any other
discount offer, such as that applied to the A1G3-SE developer boards.
If you’ve been sitting on the fence wondering whether to buy an A1G3-SE or
to wait until an upgradable G4 AmigaOne is available, you can now have the
best of both worlds. Order a new, low cost AmigaOneG3-SE now and upgrade
within 12 months. What are you waiting for?
