{subhead}Paint Programs: A Brief Comparison{def}{p}

In doing up a "quick" cover for this month's issue I played with a few
paint programs and ran into a few problems.  Always scrounging for an
article, I thought my experiences might be useful to others, so here's
a capsule summary of the problems I've had.

PerfectPaint seems to work okay until you save the file then open it
up in a doifferent program.  Seems that it messes up the image's
pallette something bad unless you use "Save Rendered" iunstead of just
"Save".  BAd to the point that when I opened up the image in BME and
played around a bit with trying to insert another one into it that BME
crashed on saving.  PerfectPaint is also too icon-driven and not
enough use of menu access for those just starting out and trying to
hunt down the right image processing tool.

PPaint seems to suffer from a lack of ability to control the screen
resolution the program uses, or at least anything in the menus that I
can find.  It also gives me an error requester on startup about being
unable to open the correct screen then defaulting to a reasonable one
anyway, but since I can't find a way to change it then it makes it
rather hard to correct.

ImageFX has everything but the mans to control how you save an IFF
image.  IFFs will always be saved in 24-bit format, so you'll have to
use something else to scale it down; no 8-bit or black and white just
Full Color.  For this scaling-down job, though, either GfxCon or
ArtPRo will do the job.

Bit Map Editor (BME) comes with PageStream and is good for several
basic image manipulations.  The only flaw I found was in the
afore-mentioned use of an image from PerfectPaint when it tried
working with the confused color pallette then saving.  It ended up
saving part of the image then the rest of what happened wasn't pretty
(reset).

TVPaint looks okay but I really haven't worked with it to know it
well.  However, it's one of those that uses the whole screen for the
picture instead of a window approach.  This means, of course, that
there's only a single image at a time to work with.

Well, that's the highlights.  Nothing useful for the pros out there
but perhaps enough for those amateurs like myself.  At any rate, I
hope it helps.
