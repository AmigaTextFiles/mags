Finally its going to become a reality! Thanks to the continuous development
of fxSCAN 4.0 you will be able to use current USB scanners, interesting
both in price and technology, with the release of the latest version!
{pp}
The required drivers will be made available seperatly in the "IOUSB
Scanner Package" (IOUSB SP) with the appearance of fxSCAN 4.0. By
building upon the IOUSB technology, it will be possible to use the
drivers with both the Poseidon stack (Highway®, Subway®, MorphOS)
and the stack contained in AmigaOS® 4.0.
