We are so close to a new life for the Amiga that I cringe every time i
see another dealer or support group drop off the scene.  The latest
was Moo Bunny, but the way they worded their announcemnt sounded like
more then financial reasons were behind it, that they were more like
kids in school ragging on the one lonely strange kid.  Or did anyone
notice the way they put the word "community" in quotes?  I could hear
the sneer in that announcement then topping it off with a reference to
the Amiga as a nice retro-platform- ignoring the fact of so many
people working hard on the coming rebirth.{pp}
Moving on due to outstanding financial reasons is fine; patience is
often determined by the size of one's pocketbook.  But for such a
former supporter of the Community to leave with a snide grin at what
they think are obviously such a bunch of loosers when that same
Community is about to partake in the latest revolution in computer use
is just beyond expectations of polite conduct.  We receive enough
flack from those outside to stomach anymore attacks from within.

On a brighter note, if you've got that $50 US to spare then by all
means send in that reservation ofr your new Ami.  Show them a full
head-count of what's out there then maybe we can show the Wintel World
a real alternative.
