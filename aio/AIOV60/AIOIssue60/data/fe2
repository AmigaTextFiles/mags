Sort of a light-hearted theme here this month (though, when have I
ever had a heavy-hearted theme?) between comedy and film stuff, but
that's only appropriate with Summer here at last (Sorry Australia, but
it IS Summer where I am).  So, let's start having som fun...

{bold}Animated Movies{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://animated-movies.squareworld.com/News.html{noitalic}{p}
A site devoted to animated films, here you can get up to date news on
up-coming animated flicks.  There's also a list of links to sites with
information on quite a variety of other animated films but
unfortunately the pop-up list is java script driven wherein you select
from the pop-up and hope something happens because there's no "Submit"
button; I tried it on both Voyager and AWeb and still it did nothing-
the scripts just too buggy.  Viewing the source for the links though
works, but you'll end up with re-directs to other sites.{p}
Still, it's good for that recent news.

{bold}The Brunching Shuttlecocks{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://brunching.com/{noitalic}{p}
A general online comedy site with subjects ranging from humerous movie
reviews and how you could be more pathetic to a Star Wars title
generatorn, a guide to choosing a password, or an alcoholics anonymous
style form where you fill in the type of obsession (I tried filling it
in with "breathing" and discovered <gasp> that the entire plant is
addicted to breathing).  The links are on the main page in nice simple
links with pictures- no frames, no broken java.  Just straight comedy without an agenda.

{bold}Turoc's Cabana{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.turoks.net/Cabana/{noitalic}{p}
The header for this site states "If you want 'politically correct' or
'clean' humor, leave now."  A Pagan Humor site that includes things
related directly to all things pPagan as well as a wealth of other
humourous topics.{pp}
A partial list should explain things well enough: 20 Ways To Confuse
Trick-or-Treaters (After you give them candy, hand the
trick-or-treaters a bill...), You Might Be Giving Pagans A Bad Name If
..., a Pagan take on why the chicken crossed the road, Mail-Order
Witchcraft, and about a hundred others, nnot counting the other-site
links.{pp}
It'll take me quite a while to get through this entire site, so why
don't you all just go on ahead.
