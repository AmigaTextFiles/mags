Here's an answer to last month's Hot Topic "When the Amiga One comes out, do
appearances matter?  Are you hoping someone takes a creative/futuristic design approach
the way Apple has done with their recent cases or will grey boxes
suffice?"  Here's the reply...

It would be nice if there were some special made amiga towers but then they must look
very good. But that isnt important as there are maaaaanyyyy good looking pc towers today.
The important thing is to have A1 motherbord. The rest is just matter of choosing already
pc towers and extra HW.

And buy OS4 :)

The Hot Topic for next month: "When the new Amiga ONE is released,
other then the OS itself, what sort of software packages should be
bundled with it (games, DTP, Office software, etc.)?"

Let us know what you think and we'll definitely publish them.
