Amiga, Inc. and Bernd Meyer announce licensing of Amithlon 2.0
June 23, 2002 - Snoqualmie, WA and Melbourne, Australia -
{pp}
Amiga, Inc. today announced the cross licensing of Amithlon 2.0. The
agreement was made with the author and the inspiration behind
Amithlon, Bernd “Bernie” Meyer. As part of the
agreement, Amiga will license Kickstart 3.1 and portions of Amiga OS
3.9 to be distributed as part of Amithlon 2.0. In turn, Amiga will
actively promote and license Amithlon 2.0 to OEM customers looking
for an Amiga emulator on x86 platforms.

Bill McEwen, Amiga President and CEO, said, "Bernie has been a good
friend and partner to Amiga. I first demonstrated a beta version of
Amithlon almost a year ago at the Sacramento show. Even then the
quality of the product and its potential were obvious to me. Since
then it has become a more polished, a clear reflection of the
passion and skills that Bernie brings to the table."

"I have also been impressed by the moral and ethical integrity that
Bernie has displayed as he has partnered with Amiga. Too often in
the past we have had to deal with companies who would like nothing
better than to split the Amiga community. Bernie  has always had the
best interests of the community at heart and has created a product
that we can all be truly proud of."

"It is with great pleasure that I finally enter into a deal directly
with Amiga", said Bernie Meyer. "This new version, to be distributed
with Amiga's seal of approval, provides customers with a clear
indication that Amithlon is an actively developed product
with great prospects. This partnership will allow users of Classic
AmigaOS to use their applications on modern, affordable hardware."

A demo version of Amithlon 2.0 will be available shortly which can
be downloaded free of charge from the distribution site here. The
demo version may be upgraded to a fully functional version with a
simple keyfile, which can be purchased online.

{bold}About Amithlon 2.0:{nobold}
{pp}
The goal of the Amithlon project was to make AmigaOS 3.9 run on commodity
PC hardware. Unlike other approaches to this problem
(UAE, Fellow), Amithlon provides AmigaOS with complete control over the
hardware. Hosted on a specially modified linux kernel, Amithlon's CPU
emulation runs AmigaOS; All access to graphics, sound, networking and
interface hardware is provided through standard AmigaOS drivers. Amithlon 2.0 is
distributed as a self-booting CD-ROM image.
