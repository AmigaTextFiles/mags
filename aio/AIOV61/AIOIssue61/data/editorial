Well, I sent in my 50 USD for the coming Amiga, what about everyone
else?  There's a lot of us out there, so come on and be heard.  Let
the world know we're tired of the "standards" out there and want a real
alternative.  Tell your friends (I have been), then see if they want
in on the Amiga Club; spread if around the net.  People are tired of
Wintel, and the MAC OS is still less than perfect, so there's still a
call for the next revolution, and that by jinkies is gonna be

Why do I shout so loud for the Amiga?  Well, someone has to.  In a
perfect world we'd have several platforms, each of equal worth and
recognition, each with it's own useful nitch.  But the world's not
perfect so we few have to cry out the louder.  There's still a place
for the Amiga and it's finally going to happen and soon.

So start shouting, people!
