If you ever wondered why your system reset and you got a guru number after
the reset,this will help you.The program is set up as a html files and you open
the main index and find the guru number.It then tells you what caused it-a
possible fix and other misc info.While there are hundreds of guru numbers,this
seeems to cover most of them.The interface is not as fast to load as my all time
favorite guru info programs-The Guru 3.02-but it does the trick.If you need
more info that The Guru 3.02 gives you,try this program to cure your guru
