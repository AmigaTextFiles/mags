This is another of those Windows/Mac text file readers.It also will open
regular html/guide/txt docs as well.Images and sound files can also be
opened as long as you have the right datatypes.For its size it does a
lot and is low on memory use.Multiview can do a fair amount of the same
stuff but Next takes it to a new level.
