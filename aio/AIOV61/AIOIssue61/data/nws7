No OS4 on Elbox SharkPPC(+|Pro), specifications & prototype needed  (19/7/2002)
{pp}
Ben Hermans, Hyperion Entertainment posted a message in responce to
the Elbox post on the subject of OS4 on the Elbox SharkPPC(+|Pro):
"I'm sorry but this is not how it works. Even if the Bios initialises
the hardware, things like device drivers and adaptation of the
HAL(timerchip, IRQ mappings etc.) need to be carried out. Especially
if one considers that the SharkPPC will be located on a PCI bus.
Without detailed specifications of the hardware and a prototype we
won't be seeing OS 4 on the Shark PPC."
