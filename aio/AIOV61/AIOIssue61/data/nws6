distribute the Teron CX and PX development systems in
Europe, and to distribute production systems based on

{bold}Eyetech in the Amiga Market{nobold}
{pp}
Since it was first conceived in 1985, the same vision
that made the Amiga famous for multimedia development
and delivery in studios, cable stations and with system
developers and users, still gives the Amiga brand a high
profile amongst multimedia developers and carries with
it a highly skilled, vociferous and loyal user base.
Thanks to a vast community of developers dedicated to
using and updating Amiga's small footprint, high
performance operating system, coupled with the advanced
PPC technology enabled by MAI's Articia chipset series,
the Amiga is once more perfectly positioned to become
the most cost-effective delivery platform for 3D and
graphic applications for the current decade and beyond.
"Eyetech has established itself as one of the leading
providers of Amiga hardware and software Worldwide,"
said Alan M. Redhouse, Managing Director of Eyetech
Group. "The high efficiency and mature, designed-in,
multitasking capabilities of the Amiga OS means the new
AmigaOne based on the Teron CX/PX's hardware
architecture will deliver new levels of user
responsiveness far greater than that of equivalently
priced Wintel or Macintosh computers."{p}
"We view the partnership with Mai Logic as an excellent
example of a win-win relationship whereby both parties
can combine their individual areas of expertise and
collectively create a better product with optimal
performance," added Alan.

{pp}
Teron is the first and the only system that offers AGP
support to Power PC processors. Its outstanding
multimedia features make it a complete, turnkey package
for gaming, presentation, and the entertainment industry
as a whole.
{pp}
The advanced Teron PX comes with a 300-pin MegArray
connector, which provides extremely easy configuration
to a range of development platforms driven by single- or
dual- PowerPC microprocessor cards. Jason Hou, CEO of
Mai Logic stated, "We are pulling together our high
performance Teron PX with Eyetech Group's renowned
technology in hardware and software solutions focused on
the Amiga."
{pp}
Mai Logic strengthens the ideal environment provided by
Teron for system development by working with its
software partners such as GDA Technologies, Inc. on Boot
code development, ITC Infotech (USA), Inc. on Windows
drivers design, and DATEC Software Solutions on multiple
OS. This combination of technologies will allow
developers to push the envelop in adding to Amiga's
repertoire and advancing an operating system that once
was years ahead of its competition. "With the vertical
total system technologies in place, Mai Logic is in a
position to undertake and execute complex turnkey
development in the areas of ASIC, Board, Firmware,
Real-Time Embedded systems and Systems applications,"
said Jason.
