Well, still summer here but kinda cool; barely getting above 95
Fahrenheit which for around here in July is really kinda cool (despite
what the weather people on television would otherwise believe). 
Anyway, usual random sites, no particular theme except for some fun
bit of browsing, so starting clicking that mouse...

{bold}The Unofficial Addams Family Site{nobold}{p}
{italic}{noitalic}{p}
It started with a comic strip then to a near-legendary TV series then
cartoons and much later a couple of movies.  At this site you can keep
track of all things Addams Family, including pictures, sounds,
biographies, surviving cast members of the original series, trivia,
the whole bit.  And for the record, I always loved The Addams Family
over The Munsters any day of the week.

{bold}Argonaut-Greywolf - Ghost Investigations & Photos{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.alienufoart.com/GhostInvestigationsPhotos.htm{noitalic}{p}
Plenty of photos of what might or might not be ghosts, spirits, or
other creepy things.  Some of them are a bit more then just vague
blurry photos abut are they the real thing?  You judge.

{bold}All Of The Dead{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.spiteyourface.com/dead/{noitalic}{p}
It's a web-movie about zombies, Egyptian mummies, brain-eating,
horror, and undead... Legos?  Yes, the entire cast and props involve
Lego constructs and animations.  Download it and give it a watch.

Need a random number?  Or a few?  Well, this site supplies thm in
quantity, either from a server, web interface, or just download a
whole page of them for whatever purpose you need them for.  They even
have some tests of their sequences to show how random they are.

{bold}Exotica from Iris{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://exotica.fix.no/{noitalic}{p}
A rather large Amiga site devoted to classic Amiga Music, Software, Artwork,
Nostalgia and a lot ore.  Prettymuch a site to keep the old spirit
alive and a pretty good job they're doing at that.
{pp}
There's tunes, of course, including music, game tunes, over 16,500 C64
tunes alone, and a whole lot more.  Players of course are on the site
to play all this stuff with, as well as what they claim to be the
biggest archive of Amiga Music Editor Software on the net, including
many hard to find ones.
{pp}
There's a Demo section but currently with just he one demo but more on
the way.  The Nostalgia sectipon is apparently devoted to, well Amiga
ostalgia, currently with all AM/FM diskmags and catalogues, most
Newsflash diskmags, and more.  Hey, I wonder if they got the old
diskmag that reviewed mny old game?
{pp}
The Utils section currently only has some file crunchers but promises
of more to follow, then the Source section contains source codes for
several music replays, demos, editors, and some utils.  Then finally
the Gallery has scans by the hundreds of amiga game boxes, logos, and
more.  Under Misc you'll find a collection of Amiga game newicons as
well an MPEG conversion of the intro for the CD32 Alien Breed Tower
Assault.
{pp}
Whew!  Anything where just the listing takes up this much space is
guarrenteed to keep you busy for a while, so start looking through it
now so you'll be finished by next month.
