Let's talk old CD drives.  In my case, I have an old 4X SCSI drive
still hooked up into my 4000.  On occassion it will decide to just not
work properly; oh sure, the power will be on but on boot up I get that
dreaded reqiuester saying it's not mounted and no amount of reboots
will bring it back.

Sound like a problem {italic}you{noitalic} have?  Well then, this
month's column is for you.  Now, while slapping it might someimes
brinbg it back, that's not always advisable.  It's getting power but
not registering even though the little access light says it's fine, so
what you do is this.  When the machine is off, open up your machine,
pull the SCSI cable out from the back of the CD, then put it back in
again., making sure contact is firm.  This will often bring it back.
Apparently the fault lies mnot in your cable but in the drive, so
this bit of re-seating seems to work well.  Alternatively, if your cable has an extra
connector on it then switch to that one for a while.

Another thing to try is the power cable, especially when it seems the
drive is just not turning on at all.  It's not that the power cable is
bad, but again for an old drive it might be the connectors, so a bit of
switching around to see which one works might be in order.

Above all, remember to be patient and take it slow and careful.  Your
hands are moving around in your Amiga's guts so now is not the time to
do anything to damage that precious motherboard, especially over a
lousey CD drive.

I hope this helps someone.
