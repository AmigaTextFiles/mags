This program was kindly sent in by the author, Stephen Fellner.

It's stated in the manual that this is the fastest MPEG player for
the 68k Amiga, and after giving it a few go's I think I must agree. I
experience RiVA as much more smooth than other MPEG viewers for the
68k Amiga.

For testing purposes I ran a video clip that should be available to
most people. It's available on Aminet (CD 43) and is called
"vd-hew99s.mpg". I chose it mainly because it's kind of small- RiVA
is good, but it's not doing miracles with huge clips. I tried running
that movie clip with a variety of options available, the one proving
to be the best was however the standard configuration, but with the
CYBERGFX switch on. And some switches I could not use at all, the
Picture In Picture (PIP) switch for instance being one. I had wanted
to compare different programs speedwise , but RiVA does not have a
FPS counter. It does however have an option for setting the FPS that
the clip should be played with (50 FPS is rather amuzing on the above
mentioned video by the way), which is usable since some videos are
encoded with the wrong FPS. More proper speed comparisons is however
found in the manual of RiVA, and judging by what the eyes see, they
are probably very accurate.

I also tried running RiVA under AGA, and I have to say that that was
the thing that impressed me the most, it's literary squeezing out
every drop out of the poor old AGA circuits, and with good results.
The sound is done via mpega.library, which means that people with
soundcards get no sound, using the standard audio system however
produces sound, how fancy it gets depends on your computer specs.

I would like to consider RiVA as one of the definitive choices you
should seriously consider when you're out to get a mpeg video player
that gives you value for the money. The results are as good as they
get.
