This is a type of program we've seen many times. Some do it good,
others... not so good. This program falls in the middle category,
it's described as being simple- and I couldn't have put it better
myself. Stripped of all excess functions and features it doesn't
really leave much else than "Simple no-nonsense sticky notes!". It's
soft/hardware demands aren't at all big (although there are
executables optimised for 020-060 supplied in the archive). It uses
MUI for the display, a plus as you then have a good way of making it
look pretty much the way you want it to in detail. The program is
configured via tooltypes or the CLI, and there's really nothing to
it, as there are only a few options used and needed to get going;
specification of a hot-key and a directory to store the notes you
scribble down are all you need. The procedure itself of actually
making a note is as simple as starting the program and hitting your
keys. There are a few good things worth mentioning, the basic
bold/underline/italic manipulation of the letters.

This type of program is indeed a good supplement to your software
collection, and depending on what you need, flashy and complicated
things, or just something plain and simple, then you have it right
here. It does what it's supposed to do, and little more... but
seriously, what more could you ask of a program designed to take down
quick notes?
