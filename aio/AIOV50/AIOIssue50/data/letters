Welcome to the letters page. This is the section where you can
air your views to the Amiga public. No matter what you want to say,
write in and we'll most likely publish it.

Hiya,{p}
Have to say I thought the letters section in ish49 was a blast!
I'm going to respond with two letters and leave it up to the reader which
one to agree with.
{pp}
ONE:{p}
I wrote the letter in ish 48 to see if I could get some sort of response
from the largely silent AIO readership out there.  I'd noticed the letters
section was more often empty and saw it as my duty to get the ball rolling.
Unfortunately, my suspicions were largely confirmed as the only response was
from a staff member at AIO.  I don't think anyone else cares, Chris.
I did not intend to destroy anyones dreams, but if they can't stand a little
negative energy then thats all they are, dreams.{p}
I think some perspective is needed.  It is a reality that some of us have
been -forced- to use PC's (industry standard).  While the average PC has
none of the mystique the Amiga has had for me, I have to admit having used,
repaired and hacked both platforms, the modern PC can do some neat stuff.
It's not friendy, just quick.{p}
I think the real trick for any next generation Amiga will be for it to
continue to maintain that "something" that PC's dont.

TWO:{p}
I wrote in ish 48 some pretty irrational stuff, in the time since then I
have reconsidered my opinion.  With the help of a very balanced arguement
from Chris Seward I now see the light.{p}
You're right we need to keep the Amiga dream alive (whilst maintaining a
healty disdain for any other platform), we need to harness the positive
feelings among the Amiga community and get the "sheep" informed so one day
just maybe the machine we all know as "Girlfriend" can assume her rightful
place as Queen of tha.... urg... ffflltt....{p}

seem to have had some form of cerebral haematoma.....
