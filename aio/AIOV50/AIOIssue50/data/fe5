What?  You don't have the latest 120MB Super-DSL hook-up, or that 30
Giga-pixel triangular 4D graphics board, or the latest WinSlop 24
zillion color 50Gig NwWave OS, or anything with a higher version number
then the last?  Man, are {italic}you{noitalic} ever archaic.  I got this
program that looks just like a wordprocessor I used to use on my 486 but
it {italic}must{noitalic} be tons better because it takes up 10GB! Oh
yeah?  Well mine takes up 15GB!  That's nothing, I got this 1000-bit
digital audio file and all you got is that old analogue copy so mine
{italic}must{noitalic} sound better...
{pp}
Sound sorta familiar?  They look at your old machine and think there's
must be better then are amazed that it can do {bold}anything{nobold},
and they'll by any of the latest technology or wizbang software with
with next year's date attached to it.  These are the same people that
are actually surprised that humans built the pyramids (my answer: they
used cement blocks poured into place, next ancient mystery).  If a
technology just came out it {bold}must{nobold} be better and so one
{bold}must{nobold} have it or be hopelessly outdated.  Right?
{pp}
Not so, as anyone with an Amiga may well know.  Take digital for
instance.  {bold}Any{nobold} digital signal is only an approximation of
the original analogue; digital signals are comprised of increasingly
finer slices of the collection of sine waves comprising the analogue, so 
no digital signal no matter how high a bit-rate can ever truly be as 
accutrate as the original analogue.  The trick is to approximate it
beyond the ability of the HUman ear to tell the difference but even that 
comes at the price of increasing file size.

Then there's everone's favorite OS punching bag Windows.  Windows2000 is
a higher year number then Windows95 so it MUST be better, but no.  More
unnecessarily bloated and slower were it not for increasingly powerful
CPUs (whose increased [power is wasted on the OS), crashes more often,
but the icons and backdrops are more colorful.  They stick in a browser 
instead of a good directory utility and call it the latest inovation but
have you ever {italic}tried{noitalic} to use a web browser to go through 
your hard drive?  It's two steps backwards but because you have your
shoes on backwards you think your moving forward.
{pp}
The point is, {bold}NEW{nobold} technology doesn't mean
{bold}HIGHER{nobold} technology, a fact which consistently escapes
Wintel users and business men everywhere and one which developers for
the upcoming AmigaDE should keep in mind in their designs.  I've seen
people try to port everything over to the Amiga just because if it's on
Wintel then it must need to be ported to make the Amiga seem up to date.  
But these ports have included a mouse driver program (for just NORMAL 
mice, not trackball or three-button) which while needed on Wintels is a
completely useless anacranism on our Ami.  And need I mention that a 
vastly bigger OS may very well only a more inefficient OS?
{pp}
So the nect time someone goes on about how they have the newest, ask them
if it really is {bold}better{nobold} or meets their needs.  If they brag
about their high Internet connection speeds just convert their baud rate 
to bytes per second and see if it's any faster then their
{italic}floppy{noitalic} drive then tell them you'll wait until some 
{bold}real{nobold} technology comes around.
{pp}
And Amiga?  Adopt a program or hardware configuration because it's good,
not just because it's there.
