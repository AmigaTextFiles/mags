As an addition to Paul's Scope project of recent issues, the author of
the test gear projects on Aminet has submitted the following articles
on this project.  with but a few editorial adjustments to fit our format
these words are his so it is to him that credit for this article is
given. -Editor.

                       Welcome to the TestGear projects.{p}

If you are an amateur electronics enthusiast you will find that you
require test equipment to set up and calibrate your construction projects.
This equipment can be expensive and may even be difficult to operate.
{pp}
What I have done is to set out a series of construction projects where a
previous project may be used to calibrate the next project, each project
getting progressively more difficult. All the projects will be some form
of test equipment used in the electronics industry.
{pp}
Every project will be designed, built, tested and used by myself to prove
that it works and cells or batteries will be used for calibration, so make
sure that you have at least a 1.5 Volt cell available for test purposes.
I used ~EVEREADY~ ULTRA PLUS RED Body types for the calibration. Type ~R6~
for the 1.5 Volts nominal and type ~6F22~ for the 9 Volts nominal,
although any ZINC/CHLORIDE cells or batteries should be alright. They were
all NEW as this gives a definitive starting point to work from.
{pp}
The only assumptions (one must NEVER make assumptions) that I am going to
make are that YOU have a MultiMeter (MultiTester) and a little knowledge of
electronics, the ability to solder, and the ability to build projects.
Age is unimportant so long as you are competent. I may design a MultiMeter
but as these are extremely cheap it would be better to purchase one.
If you have limited knowledge on project construction, soldering, testing
etc.. then go to your local library for books on the subjects.
{pp}
These projects will be based around a Standard AMIGA A500 (unless stated
otherwise) or better, using WorkBench 1.3x or better. Some projects may
require WorkBench 2.0x or better.
{pp}
The projects are all in numbered directories. The only one that you can
ignore if you require is ~Project1~ but ONLY if you have already downloded
it as TestCard.lha and TestCard.readme from Aminet. If you have not got
this project then start your building from here. The hardware for the
first few projects is very simple indeed.
{pp}
The way to gain experience is to build your own equipment. This gives you
a firm basis to start a career on, if electronics is what you want to do.
{pp}
Have some enjoyment and start building....

Because of the way the AMIGA is made you MUST fit a blank RCA/PHONO plug
into any UNUSED Audio Ouput Socket to obtain the calibrated results
of the software in use.

WARNING

{nobold}
{fixed}
  1) DISCONNECT any faulty equipment under test from the MAINS supply.
  2) If a DC supply is used do NOT reverse polarity the connections.
  3) Do NOT power up any electronic item until it is safe to do so.
  4) CHECK and RECHECK all of your construction and repair work thoroughly.
  5) Handle ALL tools used with care.
  6) Beware of ALL types of solvents, glues and etching fluids.
  7) NEVER leave a soldering iron switched on unattended.
  8) KEEP everything OUT of the reach of small children.
  9) Switch OFF the AMIGA before connecting any hardware.
 10) And finally read 1) to 9) again.

Note:
{pp}
If you are using a standard AMIGA A500 with 512KB of memory only then the
programs may run slowly. This is the trade off for making these programs
work with most of the WorkBench versions available.
{pp}
Also each SET of projects should fit onto a standard size AMIGA floppy
disk, so you should be able to download from AMINET and unarchive to
~DF0:~ without placing them onto your hard disk drive. Lastly the projects
do NOT require any special ASSIGNMENTS and will run straight from their
own directories.
{pp}
You will notice that the projects are not pretty to look at but they are
highly functional. That is, they do what they are supposed to do without
any unwanted whistles and bells.
{pp}
All of the ~TestGear?~ projects can be found in the ~hard/hack~ drawer
of AMINET. These are ~TestCard.lha~, ~TestGear1.lha~, ~TestGear2.lha~,
~TestGear3.lha~ and ~TestGear4A.lha~.
{pp}
The latest project, ~Project12~ the DC-100KHz Digital Storage Oscilloscope
IS finished and has been uploaded to AMINET. The PCB-Layouts drawer is
empty at the moment and I have NOT worked out a simple Calibration
proceedure for the Low Battery Detect Circuits as yet.
{pp}
Paul Harvey of ~AIOWorld.com~ is doing the PCB designs in due course
and I have left this drawer empty for him to use.

First of all many thanks to my wife Tricia who allows me to spend many hours
on my computers.
{pp}
Also to David Benn and Herbert Breuer for the ACE/AIDE combination supplied
on an AMIGA FORMAT floppy disk which made it easy to compile this program.
{pp}
And finally to anyone else who I may have neglected or forgotten.

Testing evaluation:
{pp}
All projects were intended for use with both NTSC and PAL in mind.
All projects were tested on an A500 with various memory configurations,
the same A500 switched to 1MB Chip Ram and emulating WB2 using
the A500+ emulator, an A600 with various memory configurations,
the same A600 emulating WB3 with various memory configurations,
an A1200 with various memory configurations and a similar A1200 with
a Turbo LC accelerator board with an '030 and 10MB of total memory.
