Can you feel the tension?  I want my AmigaDE!
{pp}
Seriously, I know they're doing what they can in building a new
marketable system from nearly the ground up but I'm still impatient. 
I want to see product, I want to see a new system, I want to see Amiga
products on shelves next to other computer products.  In the end,
that's the only way to show the world what a good OS can be.  I look
forward to the day when I can walk down the aisle, stride past the
Windows boxes, past the Apple stuff, and up to the AmigaOS boxes and
actually smile back at my friends.
{pp}
I want to see an end to marketing campaigns deciding what is the best
technology and the beginning of an age of real choises and products
that are considered good because they {bold}work{nobold} not because
some advertisement brainwashed people into saying something's good.
{pp}
Am I old fashioned in wanting GOOD technology to win out over substanceless
flash?
