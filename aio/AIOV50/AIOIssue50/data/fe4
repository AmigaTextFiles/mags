Well, to finish up the Summer we have the basic theme of mindless fun
and games here this month.  Nothing overly intellectually demanding
here, so get online and start relaxing.

{bold}Crime Scene Evidence File{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.crimescene.com/{noitalic}{p}
A crime's been committed.  You have the photos, you hav the evidence,
you can question the witnesses.  The evidence is all yours for you are
the detective.  Now solve the crime before the othr detectives do so.
At least that's the premise for this on-line web game. Play it for free
or register for extra advantage over the other detectives.

{bold}Am I Annoying Or Not{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://amiannoying.com/{noitalic}{p}
The name pretty much says it all.  Every day a diffetrent famoous
person's picture is presented along with his resume and you get to vote
that person as an annoying person.  Or consult the archives and vote for
anyone else there.  Additionally there's also a quiz you can take to
see if {bold}you're{nobold} an annoying person.

{bold}Geocachcing- The Official Global GPS Cache Hunt Site{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.geocaching.com/{noitalic}{p}
Got a GPS and want to play around with it?  Here is the site for all the
clues for hidden caches of treasure people have put out there for those
of you with GPS devices to hunt down and find.  Rules are on the site,
then get your GPS, read the clues, and start hunting.  Over 5000 caches
in 62 counties, so start hunting or just have some fun reading about the
whole thing.

{bold}Asinine Storylines{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.asininestorylines.com/{noitalic}{p}
They supply the story title and first line, then you- the entire online
commnity- supply each succissive line of story in turn.  See what wierd
and strange twists the story takes as others add onto it or read the
past archives.  Could be fun.

{bold}The Stupid Page{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.sebourn.com/stupid.html{noitalic}{p}
Everything stupid, from humor to life's little observations.  All here
to make you laugh or cry at a stupid world.{p}
Stupid stories.  Actual signs, stories about people, product warnings 
(like you really need to be warned not to spray paint in your face),
bureaucratic stupidity, really bizzare things people have found at the
backs or their fridge (dead animal parts anyone?), and more.{p}
There's also humor.  Stupid jokes, interesting ways to describe stupid
people (a rather long list- No grain in the silo,Slinky's kinked, A few fries short of a happy 
meal,...), how to tell it you're stupid (like when you can't remember how to spell
"IQ."), and even some of the funny emails the webmaster's always
getting.{p}
Round this all up with the expected on-line stupid store, feedback, and
forum, and this is really a stupid place to hang out...  Stupid in a
good funy way, that is.
