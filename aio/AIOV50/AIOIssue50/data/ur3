Review by Robert Karlsson

A few days ago a new beta version of this program was released, and since
I have been having alot of trouble with STRICQ lately I thought that maybe
it was time to try something new in the real-time chatting world, thus
AmigaAIM was chosen, more out of a coincidence than anything else.
AIM is the name of the protocol of the (evil) media giant America Online,
and it works basically the same way as ICQ does. Only real difference is
that AIM does not allow AIM users to interact with ICQ users, and vice
versa. Installing the software itself is as easy as snapping your fingers (or
copying a drawer ;). There's no install script, but the author states
he's willing to create one in the future.

The easiest way to get an AIM account is to visit http://www.aol.com
(http://www.aol.com/aim/aimexpress.html is the easiest way to create an
account, but keep in mind that webpages often change, and this link might
not be available if you read this sometime in the future), also remember
that the AOL website isn't exactly Amiga-friendly, so be prepared to fiddle
around a little in order to get your login and password. With your new
login and password in mind it's an easy thing to get going with AmigAIM,
after filling in your user name and password once, AmigaAIM saves the
information (provided you want it to) and the next time you launch the
program it's just a matter of clicking the "online" button and you're off.
AmigAIM can also be configured to automatically log in, if you would prefer
that instead. Configurating the program is pretty easy if you're familiar
with STRICQ, and the manual describes it in detail and what all the gadgets
you need to press does, so I hardly think anyone will experience any problems
doing it.

Now, this review isn't really fair, as I haven't been using AmigAIM long
enough to actually test the chat-functions properly, but I do know that
the file-transfer feature is something that's being worked on, and since
AmigAIM seems to be in constant progress I, along with alot of other Amiga
users, will await the version when that's possible.

For a newbie user, however, it's not particularly hard to get in touch
with people, by using the "Find a buddy" option in the menu, from which
you find people based on common interests. With this option you can also
pin-point people you know, all that's required is their e-mail address
or the handles they use.

Based on what I know now about this program I rate it as follows.
