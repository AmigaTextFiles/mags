The new soundcard Delfina by Individual Computers was introduced successfully last 
weekend at the AmiGBG show in Gothenburg, Sweden. Meanwhile, all important European 
dealers have been supplied, so the anticipated delivery date of April 7th can be 
kept without problems.

The module that is available now is ready to be used on nearly any Amiga. The 
included 22-pin cable for the A1200 clockport can also be used to connect to an
X-Surf Ethernet card in a "bigbox" Amiga.

Probably the most important reason to buy this card is the DSP, the digital
signal processor. For example it allows playing back MP3 nearly without CPU
load. MP3 is a popular audio format that is also used by artists to put demos
on the internet. Free music samples and full titles are available on sites 
like Entertainment-Mafia. With the Delfina, an Amiga can playback MP3 even without
an accelerator in the best possible quality.
