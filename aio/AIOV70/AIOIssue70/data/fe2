Well, it's Spring Break here where I am in the world, but there's also
an unseasonal cold weather blast preventing all the party-goers from
having their fun.  I don't know if you have a similar problem where you
are but have no fear. For either a late-Winter storm keeping you in or
just wanting to hide from all those scantily-clad sun-bathers, here
are a few sites to keep you occupied.

{bold}Cheese Racing{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.cheeseracing.org/{noitalic}{p}
Not only is there a site serious on the subject of Cheese Racing but there
is an official Cheese Racing Association (CRASS).  Just take a slice
of cheese still wrapped in it's pastic wrap, slap it on the grill with
your frienda each doing the same, and first slice of cheese to be fully
inflated is the winner.  Doubt me?  There's even photos.

{bold}VMyths{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.vmyths.com/{noitalic}{p}
Not every hysteria-inducing rumor of computer insecurity needs to
result inpanic nor are manyof them true.  To find the difference
between which are real and which a hoax, this site will detail
computer virus myths, hoaxes, urban legends,
hysteria, and what might happen you believe in them. You'll even find
them listed alphabetically.  A good resource to bookmark.

{bold}DHTML And JavaScript Code Library{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.dynamicdrive.com/{noitalic}{p}
Another good reference site, this one for dynamic Drive HTML (DHTML)
and JavaScript, it's a library of scripts for such types that you can
use to enhance your own web page, with categories for types of scripts
(Scrollers, mouse trail effects, DHTML Games, etc.).

{bold}World Wide Words{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.worldwidewords.org/{noitalic}{p}
Ever wonder about the origin of certain words and phrases?  Well then
this site will have you word smiths busy for hours going through all
the articles on the origins of all manner of common and wierd phrases
and individual words (the origin of willy-nilly, or perhaps the origin
of the phrase "dog in the manger").

{bold}Internet Public Library{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.ipl.org/{noitalic}{p}
The ultimate online library for the Net age, the only difference
between this and a normal library is that instead of finding the right
reference book you're looking for the right site to anser your
questions.  Browse the subject by category until you come to the right
subheading that then lists the corresponding web sites for that
subject.
{pp}
Still not good enough?  There's a whole bunch of searchcing tools, from
the usual keyword search to guides telling you how best to research a
topic in the IPL.  If you still need more there's pages full of
pointers to online books, magazines, and newspapers from all over the
world that you can click your way over to.  Also almanacs,
dictionaries, encyclopedias, calendars, geography, census data...
well, pretty much anything you'd expect a good library to have.
