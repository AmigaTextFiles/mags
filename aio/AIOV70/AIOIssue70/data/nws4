The new multidisk.device for Amiga OS (version 2.0 and up) and MorphOS now recognizes
the Catweasel MK3 PCI/Flipper in a PCI-slot of an Amiga, Amithlon or Pegasos. With this,
 individual computers is the first to deliver a working floppy-driver for the Pegasos, 
which brings the aspiring system one step closer to the big role model "Amiga". Burning 
CDs to transfer small amounts of data is no longer necessary, now you can use floppy 
disks of all common disk formats like Amiga 880K, Amiga 1760K, PC720K, PC1440K and many 
more.

The device is a public beta version, and it uses OpenPCI to recognize and activate the
board. Unfortunately, neither the authors of OpenPCI, nor we could get hold of
developer information about the Mediator PCI board, so this will not be supported
until further notice.
