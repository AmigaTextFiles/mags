Wordworth is showing it's age in many ways but of interest here is in
it's printer drivers.  When I'd upgraded my printer from my old HP550C
to my new HP932C I was concerned if the old Wordworth drivers would
work, more so since the newer drivers with the last OS upgrade are a
bit buggy when it comes to interfacing with Wordworth.  Well,
apparently HP printers have a certain amount of backwards
compatibility, no doubt from the common language they all speak,
because the old Wordworth drivers work with my 932C but only allow
printing at the older lower resolutions.  Not a problem for just text
printing.

For higher resolution picture printing you'll have to use the newer OS
drivers but that's not much of a problem since the bugs seem to be
related to the use of the printer's built-in fonts. I suspect the bugs
are more the fault of Wordworth as that program has been displaying
several eccentricities since the installation of OS 3.9.

Here's hoping that OS 4.0 also heralds the appearance of a new
wordprocessor package.
