Article by AUTHOR NAME

{pp}
Last month we had a submitted article about a new amiga channel on
GalaxyNet, but it seems as there was an error in that article.
{pp}
The channel in question was listed as being "#Amiga-Channel"  but that
is {bold}wrong{nobold}.  The channel's correct name is
{bold}"#Amiga-Mania"{nobold}.  The rest of the article is correct as
written, with the main server being online.be.galaxynet.org.
{pp}
Sorry  for the mistake.
