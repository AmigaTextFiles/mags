Amiga is in a period of transition.  As we await the coming of OS 4.0
and with it the first new Amiga system in ages, we leave behind the
first generation and enter into Generation 2.  More and more
programers are aiming their talents towards this new generation,
either in porting old programs or in writing new apps, and ever fewer
to the old first Gen.  And this is at it should be, as OS4 and amiga
One are the way of our future, the phoenix that willrise from the
flames and spread it's wings across the world of computers and beyond.

But while the next Generation looks to be a wonderful dream-like
manifestation, this transition period is painful.  Fewer uploads to
Aminet, companies dropping support, and all because they all await
what is to come.  A bit of suffering for us all until the brighter
time ahead.  All of us are eager for this magnificient future, but for
now new utilities to review are harder to come by and new games next to
impossible.

By now you might see where this is going.

The end of May will see our sixth anniversary, but as well it will see
the last issue of Amiga Information Online.  Any last words, articles,
or good-byes should be sent in and will be published in that issue (no
matter {bold}how{nobold} long we have to make it). Chris and I have
been discussing this for a while now and agree that with the decline of
games and utilities, and with it having been getting harder for me to fill out
the Articles section (remember when there used to be seven articles an
issue?), that rather than languish down into a pit of ephemeral
decline, we will go out in what passes for the top of our game.

The first Generation of Amiga is coming to an end and so it is only
fitting that AIo do likewise.  But will we be forever gone?  Will we
arrise with the next Generation of Amiga?  I'll save that for next
month's last-ever editorial  ;-).

In the meantime, if you have any letters, articles, or anything you
want said before we take our last bow, then by all means email us
