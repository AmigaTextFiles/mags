  The Amiga has a number of C compilers available including GCC,
Hisoft C, Maxxon C, SAS C, GCC and a number of free ones. Storm C
is the latest C compiler from Haage and Partner as is supported
as the official Developer suite by Amiga Inc.

{bold}Installation{nobold}
{pp}
StormC 4 installs with the usual Amiga Installer program
by selecting 'Install StormC' from the CD.
{pp}
You have the option of installing 'StormC', 'StormServer' or the 'Storm
Wizard' programs. The StormC is the full install, StormServer a smaller
distributed development system or the StormWizard program for GUI
development.
{pp}
Another icon called 'Install PPC680x0' will install the PPC<>68K cross
compiler program.
{pp}
Full install of StormC will take up approximately 58.4Mb and StormWizard
will take up another 509Kb.

{bold}Usage{nobold}
{pp}
I have been a SAS C developer for years and tended to use the Shell and
use SE for editing and SC for compiling. SAS C didn't really have a good
IDE interface unless you liked using the Edit, Build icons for each new
project.
{pp}
Storm C improves that with a decent IDE with built in project management
window, Editor, access to compiler and assembler, debugger, online help
and other features. This is a god send for busy developers who need quick
access to developer features without the usual Edit, Save, Compile, Run
type of development as before.
{pp}
If you already have a library of programs from a previous compiler, like me
then you want to compile them with Storm C. As the compiler is newer and
interpretation of C is slightly different, then expect to get a few
warnings and errors when you compile them. Laziness will not be tolerated.
If your projects compiled with no warnings or errors in your old compiler
then only a few changes are needed to get it to compile on StormC.
{pp}
I find it best if you create a new project copy the source files across,
create a new project and add your source files to the new project and
then compile and change your project to work in StormC.
{pp}
{bold}Documentation{nobold}
{pp}
Storm C 4 does not come with any printed manuals but consist mainly of
AmigaGuide files. Some are in German and some in English. The German manuals
cover the Storm C stuff while the English manuals cover GCC and other
utilities that come with Storm C.
{pp} For an 'official' development system, this is not really an exceptable
solution. If a new user and not good at german like me, then if you need
help using Storm C, it can be a frustrating experience. These days, multi-language
support is essential and I hope Haage and Partner can get some translators and
translate documentation in to other languages if it is to have more wide
spread support. SAS C these days is still wide spread and popular, even though
it has stopped being produced years ago.

{bold}Conclusion{nobold}
{pp}
Storm C 4 is a good alround development system, that still needs more work
to be done on it if it is to take over other systems such as SAS/C, Hisoft C,
GCC etc. The Integrated Development Environment is very easy to use and
much easier to work with than SAS/C last effort.
