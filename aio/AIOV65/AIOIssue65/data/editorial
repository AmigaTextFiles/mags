So, rumor has it that the beta-testing for OS4 is due to be finished
in abaout 3 weeks.  Sounds find, but what makes this so different from
any other rumor?  Easy, Bill McEwan said it.
{pp}
Now, I've no idea how much time needs to pass between finished testing
and seeing it on the shelf, but I'm willing to bet it's not nearly as
long as anything else we've waited for. Sounds like it'll be a near
miss at a Christmas release but a release is still a release.  I'll
take it at Christmas, I'll take it in January, I'll take it from a guy
on the street whose office is a phone booth, I just want to
{bold}get{nobold} it.  Just the chance to see my fav OS running on a
G4 based system- now {bold}THAT's{nobold} computing to show the
doubting friends and neighbors.

After all we of the Amiga Community have been through, it's hard to
get enthusiastic about anything but maybe it's about time we finally
did.  I'm not talking mere hope, I'm talking physical product,
hardware and soft.  I'm also eager to see just what developers and big
names Bill McEwan has lined up that he's had to keep mum about.

But you can do your part now also.  You got friends that have long
been dispossessed from the Amiga?  Tell them what's coming.  You got
WIntel friends looking for a better way?  Tell them what's better.
Friends developing for Linyx?  Show them a better environment to
develop for.  Whoever you know and for whichever reason, but just
{italic}tell{noitalic} them.
{pp}
As the saying goes, so the world may know...
