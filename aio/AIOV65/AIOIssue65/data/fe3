Well, year's almost up and here in the states they're already pushing
the holiday season.  Not one for joining in with such an overly
commercialized crowd, you'll find this month's selections marvelously
devoid of early Holiday commerical joy.  Happy browsing.

Back in the days of classic pulp comics there were all sorts of comic
heros few now have ever heard of before, only a scant few of which
have survived into current conscioiusness.  You may have heard of The
Shadow or Doc Savage, but what about The Spider, Master of Men?  Begun
in the years just prior to World War II and throurghout said war, pukp
was the fantasy relief of the day with heros significantly less
super-powered than the like of Superman but no less the heros.  This
site is devoted to those comics.
{pp}
Some pages specific to the highlights of The Shadow, Doc Savage, and
The Spider, complete with history, pictures, and the usual.  Other
links give information on other classic pulps and pulp in general. 
The history of pulp fiction, and assorted pulp memories.  Need more
info on Pulp?  Well they site several sources on the webe, in books,
in forums, even where fans gather.  It's a pulp Grand Central Station.
{pp}
So, if you've ever been fascinated by classic old pulp, then this site
is a very good place to start.  And remember, Pulp is where modern
comics got their start.
