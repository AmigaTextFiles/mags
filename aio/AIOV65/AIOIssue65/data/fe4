Let's do a little DOpus cut and paste, shall we?

The universal Right-Amiga-C can work on a few other things as well. 
Take a lister with whatever directory contents and highlight the
files/dorectories you want to.  Then do the Left-Amiga-C and go over
to a text editor.  Do a paste and you'll discover that the selected
entries have had their full paths copied over to the Clipboard and
will now paste out as text.  A selected directory will have it's full
path printed out but not it's further contents and files of course
will have their paths.

But wait, there's more.  THis trick works for listers in either Icon
Mode or Icon Action Mode as well.  Neat, huh?

And as long as we're on the subject, double-click a file to have it
read out in a text window then highlight some text by dragging the
cursor across.  Hit Left-Amiga-C and the text has been copied to the
clipboard for later pasting.

Aren't universal key-combinations nice?
