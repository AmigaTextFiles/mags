This is the AWeb provided with the Workbench 3.9 CD upgraded with the AWeb-IISE retail patch. Installing can be done
either by using the two provided disks or from the Workbench CD, there are however a few questionmarks here. Normally
I would consider an update to be something you place over an already existing installation of the program, but here
you are supposed to install the purchased update-version separately and later add the things missing from, say a demo
archive. I suppose it's a rather odd way of updating something, but it works.

After installing the program you're ready to go, and starting AWeb is really fast, much of that speed is from the
non-MUI interface, I suppose. But whether loading really is faster than other browsers are not so certain, there's
no remarkable speedups at least, the quality of the imagedecoding for instance is not really relevant when you run
with graphics board. (On AGA the image decoders in AWeb are horrible. ;) the image decoding can be handled by datatypes,
which is a good and "economic" feature, there are also internal image decoders, but the external datatypes are faster.
There's also an array of plugins to be obtained for AWeb, and if you are a developer you can also make your own thanks
to the public API. There's also an ARexx port which you can fiddle around with if you happen to be good at that.
It's also easy to configure AWeb to suit your needs.
There's also SSL (Secure Socket Layer) support using Miami, which should suit the ones that want to do transactions
over the internet, a word of caution though, there are unfortunately no guarantees they'll work since the web isn't
exactly adapted to the Amiga.

With the purchase came a small printed manual which covers the most urgent topics concerning AWeb. The manual is
pretty good printed with colour, but the online manual is the one you should look into if you want to know more
indepth how the functions of AWeb work.

One of the most crucial features of AWeb is the javascript support, and really, there is no other choice if you want
to be able to use a somewhat decent browser that supports javascripts, even if the support is by far from perfect, you'll
get the farthest with AWeb's.

There aren't really many Amiga browsers to choose from these days, but I am certain that different people have
different preferences concerning the ones that do exist. Perhaps some people figure the way I do- some browsers
are good for some purposes while others are better for other things. AWeb is pretty general though and seems to
work good (most times the best, actually) with all types of webpages. There are however some things I don't like
very much with it. Up to this day there's still no URL-completer feature, which I find extremely annoying, and
the way the abortion of transfers are alittle strangely handled, it seems like the Stop button only aborts the first
transfer in the que, not everything immediately- which I think the Stop button should do. You can however open the
network-status window and choose a full stop, but to me it seems like a big detour. I can't really figure out why it
is like that, after so many updates over the years. However, AWeb along with Voyager seems to be the only two browsers
left to the Amiga that still gets updated at all. IBrowse, my personal choice in browsing, seems to be more or less
dead. Pity, but it leaves nothing else than hope that AWeb (and Voyager) reach the same standard I consider myself used
to and most comfortable with.

The conclusion is that AWeb is indeed "the Premier choice for Amiga web access", with some minor flaws.
