SFS, the free replacement file system for the Amiga by John Hendrikx is now up to release 1.187
beta. According to http://www.amiga-stuff.com/fs-download.html, Jorg Strohmayer has also 
worked on this version. SFS's home page, http://www.xs4all.nl/~hjohn/SFS/, doesn't mention any 
updates since 1.84. SFS_BETA.lha can be found on aminet in disk/misc.

(Editor's Note: This release seems to work fine with 1.84 partitions - but be sure to back up regularly! - Paul)

1.187
- AmigaOS: SCSI_DIRECT support removed.
- Disabled some unused code (deviceio/asynctransfer).
- AmigaOS: removed check for devices with broken TD_GETGEOMETRY (use
  NSDPatch.cfg instead if required).
- Mounting from RDB was broken in 1.186, fixed.


1.186
- Compiled from the original/MorphOS sources, has NOTHING to do with my
  rewritten 0.x versions, no bugfixes nor changes by me (execptions:
  - Max. name length changed to 107
  - OS 2.x support removed.)
- Should be compatible with 1.84.
- I don't know why it has SUCH a high version number, there are nearly
  no changes to 1.84 (only 2 bugs were fixed: a wrong Type argument in
  the MatchFuncHook and the wrong result for SoftLinks in ExAll).

fix some bugs and add new features to the next version(s).
