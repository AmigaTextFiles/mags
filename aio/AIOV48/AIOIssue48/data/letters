In issue 47, Joe Deats had a brief rant about the choice of CPU in
AmigaOne...  I could'nt agree more!  The pricepoint and commonly perceived
performance/speed of the PPC CPU is a weak point.  I think though, the
problem is a much deeper one.  Mr/Mrs Average's impression of AmigaOne will
be; "...it's slower than the standard PC..." they'll ask, "What's an Amiga?"
and, "Can it play -insert latest hyped game here- ?".  I also think there
are a lot of retailers out there with long memories, (Commodore and its
Amiga 1200, sitting unbought in the shop display).

The only string Amiga manufacturers could have to their rather shabby, home
made bow is pricepoint, I mean it better be veerry cheap, very cheap!  And
it wouldn't hurt to spend a few bucks on marketing too.  (Can't shake the
memory of Commodore and the A1200 for some reason...)

Look at the closest, and far stronger comparisons, Apple and Sega, both
have had excellent products, heaps of presence and a name and still they've
struggled to get a reasonable market share.

I know this sounds a bit anti-Amiga, I have owned four Amigas, 3 A500's and
an A1200/030/40Mhz blah blah.  Ive always loved the machine, but recently
faced the fact that the machine is pretty much dead.  You now need more
technical prowess to get and old A500 game working on an A1200 than you do
to get a Wintel machine to do the same.  Don't get me wrong, I'd probably
buy an AmigaOne if I thought it stood half a chance, its just not a viable
platform and I can't be bothered with more crappy software support.
Seriously though, look at the competition, they are A grade companies not
lightweights, they're serious.

It's like seeing some fuzzy little creature in the headlights of an
oncoming bus.

AmigaOne = AmigaWho....  fade out.
