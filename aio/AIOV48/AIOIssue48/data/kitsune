Paul,

You mention that I could get my question, about getting ISA access on A1200 with a ZIV and
A2386 on one of the forums on amiga.org, published in the next issue of AIO. That sounds like it
could be helpful.

For the benefit of the readers, 'kitsune' posted on amiga.org a request for suggestions on how
to get ISA cards to work with a 286 PC bridge board in his A1200/ZIV tower system. This isn't as
straight forward as it seems, because the ZIV kit has no ISA slots. And unfortunately I've lost the
original post and it seems so has amiga.org.. but here's what I have to say.

A: The ISA slots in a big box Amiga are nothing special. Without a bridge board, they are just for
show. The only pins on each of those slots that are even remotely connected to the rest of the
Amiga system, is the power supply pins. So plugging in an ISA card, without a bridge board, is
fruitless.

Basically, to the best of my knowledge, each of the ISA slots are connected in parallel. So it
doesn't matter which slot you put an ISA card or your bridge board - because electrically each
slot is identical. So it's just a matter of getting an electrical connection, pin for pin, to the bridge
board from the ISA card. Unfortunately we can't ignore the fact the bridge has to also sit in a
Zorro slot at the same time. I've never seen any pictures of a ZIV, but if there is PCB where the
ISA slots should be, you may just have to give up, because you need room to mount new ISA
slots.  If on the other hand there is room to mount another PCB where the ISA slots should be,
there may be a chance. But it's a long shot - not for the light hearted!

Relying on the assumption that the ISA bus system is ancient, insufficient, slow, but very durable
and robust to improper terminations, I guess you could hack up an old 286/386 mainboard -
leaving the ISA slots and the PCB they sit on - intact. That's a cheap and nasty (and probably
doomed) way of doing things.. in cutting a multilayered PCB, you may have shorts along the
edge of the cut, crack something, slice an important track, etc. Also you may have to leave a few
capacitors intact, that are supposed to dampen noise here and there. You would have to go along
with a multimeter and check each pin, one by one, to verify they are working, for however many
ISA slots you intend to use. Also, if there are any other components you didn't chop off that are
involved with the ISA bus, you'll have to remove those too. It sounds pretty messy!
{pp}
A far better, but more intensive/expensive way would be to just get hold of a few ISA slots and
fabricate a PCB for them. If I was serious about doing this, that is what I'd do. Another option, if
you only want to connect one ISA card, would be to get a couple of ISA slots and use lots of IDC
ribbon cable to join them together. It would be an interesting soldering job, but would save
making a double sided circuit board. Don't forget you'll have to get a pinout of the ISA bus and
substitute power to the pins that need it. Whatever you choose to not/do, I'm sure the
motherboard trick would end in disaster!

Perhaps there are readers out there that have a slightly more elegant way of solving this problem.
If you do, don't hesitate to email me or kitsune.
