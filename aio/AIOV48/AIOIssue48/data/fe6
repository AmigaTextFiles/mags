Just a couple of AmigaOne related nuggets here for that extra time that crops
up, both related to the AmigaDE or AmigaONE.
{pp}
First.  At {link http://elwoodb.free.fr/files/}http://elwoodb.free.fr/files/{end}
you'll find some prototype DE pics.

And second {link http://www.eyetech.co.uk/amigaone/faq.php}http://www.eyetech.co.uk/amigaone/faq.ph{end}
contains rather extensive and updated Q and A stuff about the AmigaONE.
Also contains articles from Amiga themselves about SCSI issues and the seemingly powerfull sound
chip they will be using.  The same SCSI article can also be found at
