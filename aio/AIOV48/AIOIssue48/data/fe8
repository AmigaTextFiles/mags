"Prometheus" is the most advanced
PCI bridge solution for Zorro III equipped Amiga computers. Designed
and produced with the highest quality technology, it gives your
Amiga fascinating expansion perspectives. With "Prometheus"
and the updated drivers available at our website, you can connect
to your Amiga an high performance graphics card, a good quality
sound card and a fast network card (or modem). Even then, you will
still have one free PCI slot for our planned G3 processor card,
which will be designed to take over the control of your system.
With this feature and the 68k emulator, you will no longer need
an expensive 68k processor card (more info soon). What options and
expansion cards you choose, depends only on your financial resources
and... the space available in your tower case. Drives and their
updates will always be ready to download from our website, we will
also publish them on popular Amiga press coverdisks. With extensive
help of - also independent - software developers the number of available
drivers and graphics, sound, network TV-capture, etc. cards working
with "Prometheus" will be constantly expanding.
We are open to your suggestions and inquiries what cards you would
like to use with "Prometheus" and your Amiga.

Due to the multiple tower solutions available for Amiga computers, there
was no way to adapt our "Prometheus" to fit all of them.
Therefore, we decided to design the smallest possible card to fit
any tower case. It also fits desktop Zorro III equipped Amigas, however
with PCI cards installed, you cannot close the case lid. Obviously,
the PCI cards do not fit into the holder peg slots of the tower cases.
That is why we provide you with extension cords for them. Simply,
connect the extension cord to the PCI card socket and screw the connector's
holder peg on to an available free slot in your tower case. Our solution
gives you both the comfort of easy cord connection and the assurance
that your PCI cards will not disconnect from the slot while you move
the cords. "Matay" has the official support from the developers
of Picasso96 graphics system, which guarantees the highest quality
of the graphics drivers and its immediate updates if a bug is reported.
P96 is compatible with CyberGraphX, so we expect no problems even
with CGX dependent software.
