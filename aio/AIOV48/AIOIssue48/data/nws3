At the St Louis show in April, Amiga announced the continued development of 
AmigaOS, with AmigaOS4 moving AmigaOS3 to modern hardware and preparing the way 
for AmigaOS5. AmigaOS5 will be targeted at both the home server and the 
desktop/workstation markets.

"In developing AmigaOS4.0, we have been making extensive use of the Prometheus 
PCI bridge board, to get a head start on developing drivers for the various sub 
systems whilst we wait for the Eyetech AmigaOne to be completed," said Fleecy 
Moss, CTO of Amiga Inc. "The quality of both their product and support, and 
their commitment to the future of the Amiga has made working with them a 
pleasure, and we look forward to this co-operation intensifying over the next 
few years."

"We are very excited to work with Amiga Inc., the company that leads our
community into the new technological revolution. In the incoming years, we will
witness a breakthrough in digital home appliances, a trend to abandon a single
computer workstation in favour of several smaller, yet more user-friendly
devices. The revolution is coming, though we need to prepare for it, like the
Amiga market needs transition from our classic computers to new technologies and
standards. Amiga Inc. is the company that foresees these trends and enters the
digital future today. We are proud that our Prometheus board, the first Zorro III PCI
bridge for Amiga, helps them in making these plans come true," said Filip Dab-
Mirowski, CEO of Matay company. "We will continue co-operation with Amiga Inc.,
not only providing them with hardware solutions for today Amiga market but also
working together on products for the future digital market."
