For immediate release

We need to make more space in our warehouse for the AmigaOne boards and
prebuilt systems - so some things have just got to go. Although (speaking
as an honorary Yorkshireman)  it goes against the grain to give 'owt fer
nowt' it has to be done! We are therefore giving the following items away
free of charge (and obviously without warranty or support) on a
first-come-first-served basis. All we ask is that you pay a contribution
of £1 per item (in stamps or coins only) towards administration, and our
regular carriage charge if you are not collecting the items in person.
We have the following items available:
{pp}
    Brand new MiniTower cases with 7 card-slot positions without PSU or power switch.
{pp}
    2 x 5.25" and 2 x 3.5" drive bays. Ideal for mounting a stand alone AmigaOne
1200 in, as a hard drive/CDROM storage expansion - or for home conversion to
a high-tech pedal bin.
{pp}
    Please note these towers are NOT suitable for housing an A1200.
{pp}
    Brand new and extremely stylish low profile 'netstation' cases (no PSU) with
3 x 3.5" drive bays.
{p}
Ideal for drive bay expansion sitting under a desktop case - eg an A4000D or
for housing a (Linux-based) home server using an all-in-one PC motherboard.
{p}
With some metalwork the case could also be used to house an A600/CD32. If you
need a 5.25" bay (for CDROM etc) we can supply a matching  external case for just £10.
{pp}
    Brand new Amiga international A1200 cases.
{p}
Perfect for updating your A1200 from its grubby Commodore case, or for
rehabilitating your towered A1200 motherboard when you buy a new AmigaOne for
use in standalone mode.
{pp}
    Magic Pack Amiga manuals - essential for occasional reference - or to replace
dog-eared orginals if you ever sell your Amiga. English and German language
manuals are available.
{pp}
    Magic pack application software/games (2 manuals = 1 item) covering
Wordworth, Datastore, Turbocalc, Photogenics, Personal Paint, Whizz
and Pinball Mania.
{pp}
    A1200 manual set (A1200, hard drive, Workbench 3.1). 3 manuals = 1 item.
Technical reference set (DOS3.1, Arexx). 2 manuals = 1 item.
{pp}
    Magic Pack software. 16 diskettes covering Wordworth, Datastore, Turbocalc,
Photogenics & Personal Paint productivity software (11 disks) and Whizz &
Pinball games (5 disks). The software is free - you just pay for the diskettes
at 25p each (=£4.00).
{pp}
    Other 1-off ex Eyetech internal usage products including dot matrix & laser
printers. Believed working when last used but not tested and no warranty of any sort.
