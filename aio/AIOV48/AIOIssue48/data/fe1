Recently a disturbing piece of information has been brought to my
attention in an IRC conversation, significant enough that though it
mainly concerns the PC world it is well worth mentioning here to all
curious Amigans.
{pp}
The conversation was with one Michael J. Brenegan, USArmy, Retired
a Clinical Engineer with a strong networking background who is also
an IRCop for ARCNet (Cap).  He has been around computers of numerous
kinds for a good number of years and has never steered me or anyone
else wrong. He uses Amiga, Linux (including servers), and most flavors
of Win.  With that in mind, here is what I have learned.

The ability to spoof outgoing packets is an integral part of a Denial of
Service (DoS) attack, those dreaded horrors of the Internet usually
engineered by disastisfied net-squatters.  Unix and linux can do this
but neither are mainstream and both require some computer savvy and
intelligence to use.  Win2K can do it but NOT easily.
{pp}
Enter WinXP, a new Win OS for the masses.  It CAN spoof outgoing packets
and quite easily.  Thus, any half-intelligent script-kiddy can launch a
DoS attack on anyone they choose.  Hacker spoofing for the masses.
We're talking kids, businessmen, everybody.

Some 9-year-old gets mad at his teacher and the next day the school's
computer goes down.  Internet chaos, armageddon, the whole bit (thank
mister Gates, class).
{pp}
But wait, it gets worse.  Enter Gibson of Gibson Research.  One day a
13-year old took down his site with a DoS attack, so Gibson develops a
spoofer tool to test if people's ISPs allow outgoing spoofed packets.  An
ISP that allows that will allow a WinXP client to spoof outgoing packets
to mount a DoS attack.  However, if WinXp hits the streets, this tool
can be used to create even worse conditions, by clueing people into
which sites they can launch their DoS attacks through.  Gibson created this tool
to make Microsoft listen, but we all know they won't.  The result is an
unprecedented level of Internet chaos that will have even the career
hackers ducking for cover.  Check out {link http://www.grc.com}www.grc.com{end}
for his complete story.

Yes folks, it looks like Microsoft is about to do to the computer
world what hookers do to their Johns.  Apparently no one's told them
that just because something IS possible is no reason why you SHOULD do
it.  If this hits the streets there may be very few people safe; unless,
of course, someone decides that NO ISP should allow outgoing spoofed
packets.  Maybe someone in the Amiga Community can come up with something to at
least protect ourselves, I don't know.  I just know this is worth
reporting in an attempt to keep Amigans aware and informed.

It also illustrates another difference between operating systems...
Ours has a heart.
