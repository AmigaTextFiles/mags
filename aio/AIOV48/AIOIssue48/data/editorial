Consider it a countdown: timelines published, rumors confirmed of new
releases, photos of {italic}actual{noitalic} boards, all building up
to a final release.  It's like wondering if the Deathstar's going to
blow up before it nails the rebel base or not.  We're all in that
stage of waiting now to see if our hero makes it past the bad guy. 
The stage is set, the plot in motion, and now...

We'll soon see.

No games this month but we will have a review or two next time.  We
still need that new Games Editor not to mention one for News.  Paul
helped out on the news this month, but it's not a permanent
replacement by far.  So, if you're looking for a way to help out your
Amiga community, this might be one way.  Write in to
general@aioworld.com if you want to give it a try.

Until next time then, enjoy the issue and keep watching the skies...
you just may see a new star rising soon.
