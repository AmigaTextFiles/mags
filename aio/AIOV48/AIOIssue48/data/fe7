The AmigaOne 1200 & 4000, the Predator, GRex and Mediator boards - A factual clarification of
similarities and differences
{pp}
{bold}For immediate release{nobold}
{pp}
We believe that all of the above products - including the Mediator 
- represent very worthwhile expansion options for Classic Amiga 
users. However each of the above products has been designed to
give the Classic Amiga user specific and quite different expansion
and forward progression capabilities, and it is therefore
important to note that these different product lines are not
functionally interchangeable and the type selected should be
carefully chosen with regard to the Amiga's current and intended
future use.
{pp}
This brief note is to highlight the differences in these product
lines by outlining the basic specifications of the Predator, G-Rex
and AmigaOne 1200/4000 products and how their design philosophy
differs both from each other and from the Mediator board from Elbox.
For the sake of clarification the summary information on the 
Mediator board given here has been taken from public press 
releases and advertisements published by Elbox over the past few months.
Finally please note that we continue to refuse to get drawn into any
unprofessional and public arguments with Elbox over their reaction
to any products which are even vaguely competitive to their Mediator
design. There are however some misleading inaccuracies in their
press release of 30 October 2000 which this note will also help
clear up.
{pp}
The AmigaOne 1200 & 4000 are 6xPCI + 1xAGP stand-alone G3/G4
boards capable of running the Amiga DE directly (which is being
ported to the design by Amiga Inc). These boards are designed to fit
in the most popular A1200/A4000 tower systems, and optionally connect
to the A1200/A4000 motherboard for access to Classic Amiga chipset
hardware. In this mode the AmigaOne 1200/4000 can also be used to
run the Classic Amiga OS & software with a very high degree of
compatibility - because it has access to all the Classic Amiga
custom chips.
{pp}
It is however of fundamental importance to note that the A1200/A4000
'computer' now resides on the AmigaOne board - having direct
high-speed access to all the AmigaOne's PCI/AGP peripherals, and
only accessing the existing A1200/A4000 chipset (via the A1200 
edge connector or the A4000 cpu connector) as and when required.
Any existing 680x0 or PPC accelerator is entirely redundant, its
function being carried out by the AmigaOne's G3/G4 cpu & memory.
For this reason the provision of a pass-through accelerator slot
on either the A1200 or A4000 version of the AmigaOne is completely
pointless. In our view a small cardboard box provides much more
cost-effective storage for an unused accelerator card than an
expensive edge connector.
{pp}
For entirely hardware independent (retargetable) applications the
AmigaOne 1200/4000 hardware is capable of running them without an
A1200 or A4000 motherboard being attached at all.
The Predator and GRex boards (which are of similar - but
not identical - design) add PCI (& AGP in the case of the
Predator-Plus) facilities to an Amiga 1200 or 4000 with a
phase5/DCE design of PPC (or Cyberstorm Mk3) accelerator. These
boards use the phase5 accelerator's local bus (which is not
itself a PCI bus) graphics card connector to give a high speed interface between
cpu and PCI/AGP slots. This has been implemented by using a
custom-designed 'northbridge' chip on the Predator itself. The Predator
also makes use of other logic on the accelerator 
to interface to the Amiga motherboard's onboard chipset & 
peripherals.
{pp}
Using this local bus allows full linear addressing of the
PCI/AGP cards within the cpu's address space, and allows
busmastering and DMA to be implemented not just between
PCI/AGP cards but between the cards and the accelerator card's
onboard memory. This design does not require the use of any
paging registers for data transfer between cpu and PCI board, 
and removes any contention between the lower speed A1200 edge
connector bus (which is used exclusively for accessing the 
Amiga's onboard peripherals and chipset resources) and the high 
speed local bus (which is used exclusively for PCI/AGP access).
In addition the Predator-Plus also has provision for an on-board
G3/G4 cpu and SDRAM memory to provide a user-installable PPC 
accelerator uprade. 
{pp}
Unlike the AmigaOne 1200/4000 the Predator and GRex boards need
an A1200/A4000 motherboard and appropriate
BizzardPPC / CyberstormPPC / Cyberstorm Mk3 accelerator installed 
to function.
{pp}
The Mediator board from Elbox, was, in our understanding,
originally designed to be a PCI-only replacement for the Zorro
II-based Z4 busboard from Apollo, primarily to allow the use of 
low cost PCI graphics cards in an A1200. As with the Predator & GRex
boards above, the Mediator was not designed to run the native Amiga DE. 
The Elbox design uses a bespoke paged memory mapper to allow compatibility with all
A1200 accelerators (providing they are fast enough to drive 
the graphics card) and transfers all data - both to the PCI
and Amiga's on board peripherals/chipset resources - over the 
A1200 edge connector bus. For its originally intended market
(ie to provide a towered A1200 with PCI sots) this 
is certainly a workable option.
{pp}
Since the Eyetech's original Predator announcement in September
2000 Elbox have announced a variety of add-on/upgrade cards
for the Mediator, to - we understand - provide it with superficially
similar facilities to those embodied in the design of the
Predator. However - as we understand it - these upgrades will
still rely on (paged) cpu and memory access from the existing
Amiga accelerator over the A1200 edge connector.
Elbox have also recently announced an A4000 version of the
Mediator which, we understand, basically uses the same
technology as the A1200 version but physically connects via
the Zorro bus using the 8MB Zorro II address space for a
paged PCI memory interface.
{pp}
We hope this helps clear up the differences between these
three significant upgrade products for Classic Amiga
computers.
