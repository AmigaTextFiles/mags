PocketPC/Windows/Linux/Amiga
{pp}
Photogenics is an advanced new paint and photo editing package for the Microsoft Pocket PC 
platform. It is based directly on the high end Windows and Linux versions of the software, 
but packaged with a friendly user interface specifically designed for the smaller screen size. 
As a result, Photogenics has an incredible amount of breadth and sophistication for a PDA 
application.

{bold}Features{nobold}
{pp}
Photogenics allows the manipulation, retouching, and enhancement of digital photographs
without the need for a PC. Offers the ability to draw and paint with realistic media, such as
Airbrush, Chalk, Pencil, Sponge, Watercolour, and Smudge.
{pp}
Paint-on Image Processing: You can apply over 60 filters not just to the entire image, but to
precisely the area you want, simply by drawing with any of the media tools. Airbrush everything
on and off for instant touch-ups without the need for tedious masking.
{pp}
Dedicated filters for enhancing photos, including Auto Contrast, Auto Enhance, Remove Colour
Cast, Remove Noise, and Remove Red Eye, as well as full manual control over the
Hue/Saturation/Brightness/Red/Green/Blue/Gamma levels.
{pp}
Standard image processing filters such as Blur, Gaussian Blur, Motion Blur, Pan Blur, Radial Blur,
Roll Blur, Sharpen, and Unsharp Mask.
{pp}
Creative filters such as Fire Blur, Bump Map, Contour Map, Emboss, Bas Relief, Honeycomb,
Pixelize, Randomize, Channel Flip, Tile, Colourise, Sepia, Colour To Grey, plus many more.
{pp}
Exclusive Paint Layer Technology: Mistakes can be rubbed out without having to redo the parts
you like, using a "fade out" technique.
{pp}
Unparalleled Creativity Levels: Real-time modification of colour, transparency, image processing
mode, and artwork positioning.
Stunning Paint-On Pyrotechnics: Lens-flares, fire, and explosion effects can be combined with
smear to produce supernovas, waves of fire, and even sunsets and waterfalls.
{pp}
Transparency: Photogenics allows you to modify not only the standard transparency of what you 
have already drawn, but offers fine grained control over the transparency of  the individual Red,
Green, and Blue channels, and also allows you to specify how much of the effect shows through 
to the Shadows, Midtones, and Highlights. 
{pp}
Supports having multiple images open at once, multiple layers per image, plus alpha channels
and secondary images for  both simple and sophisticated image compositing.
{pp}
Standard image editing functions such as scale, rotate, flip, crop, add space, and clone.
{pp}
Thumbnail image browser for quickly finding the images you want to open.
{pp}
Supports loading and saving in several different file formats, including JPEG, GIF, BMP, and
TARGA.
{pp}
Built-in time delay screen-capture ability.
{pp}
Sophisticated dithering routines to reduce colour banding and enhance display quality for Pocket
PC's that only support 12 bit colour.

{bold}System Requirements{nobold}
{pp}
Photogenics works well on almost all Pocket PC devices, including the Compaq iPAQ, Casio
Cassiopeia, HP Jornada, and Palmax Amigo. The HP Jornada 525 is not recommended due to it
only displaying 256 colours. 1.5MB of storage space is required for installation, and 2MB of
program memory is required to run. Editing large images will require additional amounts of
memory, from 0.5MB for 240x320 images, 2.1MB for 640x480, 6MB for 1024x768, 13MB for
1600x1200, up to 21.5MB for 2048x1536. In digital camera terms, you will need roughly 7MB
per mega-pixel.
