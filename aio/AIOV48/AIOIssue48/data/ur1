Most people should know what this program is for, as it has, along with JST, grown very popular in the Amiga community,
it does what many  people considered virtually impossible just a few years ago. It enables you to play perhaps not all,
but many of your favourite games (provided you bought the games while they were available). Now, I am not a man of many
games. I own perhaps 20-30 games, and if  the truth shall be known, I actually bought this thing to be able to play
Elite and Fears ;)... well, not quite, I'm sure I'll find lots of other use for WHDload too.

What does WHDload do then? Well, all the technical stuff is something I don't dare getting myself into too much, but
it degrades your Amiga, allowing "slaves" to be created that control the read/writing to and from places to your
harddisk and the access to the disk images created from the disks of the game you want to play/install.
This thing is something that by far beats sitting and listening to the chucking of disk access all day long.
More detailed instructions about how WHDload really works can be found in the (developer) archive's docs. There
are two different versions of WHDload, one for plain users and one with the earlier mentioned developer information,
if you are a plain user it doesn't really matter which archive you choose, as the WHDload executable provided is the
same. The docs in the "user" archive that I have tested (really, I have no use for the developer archive!) aren't at
all difficult to get through, mainly because I think mr "Wepl" has really made an effort not to scare away all of us
lamers ;). The technical explanations that are present are short and concise, and they can always be skipped if you
find it uninteresting.

When you install (which is really fast by the way) WHDload it doesn't really do much more than copy the required files
to Sys:C/ and the docs to your prefered choice. This is also done very easilly manually. After this is done, all you
do is install a game (or demo- there are quite a lot installs for those too!) and run the Slave and hopefully you
should be off killing those mean aliens, or whatever. Should the game fail to load the game, WHDload has extensive
debugging features which can easilly be copied and sent to the installer-writer.
{pp}
WHDload functions unregistered too, of course, but somewhat limited, and more and more slave-writers choose to make
games playable, or saves enabled only if you register the program itself, if that's fair or not is something I leave for
you to decide. The fact remains that WHDload rocks, and if you like playing all those cool old games from the golden
days of the Amiga, it'd be worth something like 20 DEM, wouldn't it?
