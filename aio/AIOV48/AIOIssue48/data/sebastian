Hello!
{pp}
My name is Sebastian. Maybe this is not a tech problem, but I need an advice of someone who
knows a little bit about Amiga hardware. I am thinking about buying some PCI Slots but it is
really hard to decide on something. My actual config is 030/50 with 32MB Ram. It is slow, very
slow in comparison with the trends on the market, but that is why I would like to speed it up. I
am planning for sure to buy GFX card. My guess is that BVision seems to be the best solution.
But for that I need BPPC. Here are my questions:
{pp}
1. Is it possible to buy Mediator and install on it BVision (without BPPC)?
If yes then is it possible to install there my old 030/50 too? Money does not come from sky, you
know.
{pp}
2. The next thing: When I decide to buy Mediator and Voodoo3 I presume that my turboboard
still will be 030/50 plugged into the Mediator? Is it then possible to speed up my config by
buying some PPC in future?
{pp}
3. Does Mediator "co-operate" with some PPC boards at all?
{pp}
4. Is it possible to install Mediator when I already have BPPC+BVision? Or maybe it is better to
buy G-Rexx or Predator?
{pp}
5. And I think the most important question: How does look the case of Ami software when a
Voodoo3 is plugged in? Does it "co-operate" with the system properly? Are there any cons?
Everybody says that Heretic II runs well, but what about utilities not games?
{pp}
I am looking forward to hearing from you

Greets and regards,

Hello Sebastian,
{pp}
Firstly I'll just mention that response here is based on internet research - unless otherwise stated,
I've never touched any of the hardware I'm talking about.
{pp}
1. Short answer: No. As far as I know, even though the BVision is essentially the ordinary
Permedia 2 chipset etc. with (I think) a mostly normal PCI interface, it uses P5's propriety form 
factor in mounting the cards... the only other accelerator that can take a BVision is the later 
Blizzard 060 boards (MK6?).
{pp}
If you have a PCI bridge like mediator, you don't need the BVision. Voodoo 3 cards are newer,
dirt cheap in comparison, and should be a lot easier and quicker to get a hold of. Money doesn't
come from the sky, but if you have a PCI bus board in your Amiga, you can use cheap &
plentiful wintel hardware.
{pp}
2. Yes. The mediator PCI bus-board is designed to act as a bridge to PCI cards installed in it,
whilst at the same time acting as a pass-through connector to your existing A1200 accelerator.
Therefore, providing you can mount all the hardware in a suitable case (it's my understanding
that the mediator has an ATX power socket to provide power to your A1200 via an ATX PSU),
your system should operate is it did without the mediator, except now you have access to PCI
peripherals. So the Mediator board becomes a graphics solution in itself, if you fit a video card in
it.
{pp}
3. See my answer to question 2. To the best of my knowledge, many Mediator users are often
also PPC users - I haven't heard of any problems using PPC with mediator.
{pp}
4. AFAIK, you can still use all your existing Amiga hardware. If you left the BVision in your
accelerator, any extra video cards on the PCI board could be hooked up to a monitor
switcher/second monitor... or you could make the PCI video card the primary display, depending
on how you set it up.
{pp}
For a good overview of the differences between the different PCI bridge boards available, see the
article in this issue 'The AmigaOne 1200 & 4000, the Predator, GRex and Mediator boards', by
Eyetech. Or you can try an independant report at http://www.mediaspace.net/amigaaktuell/international/edition0101/workshop1.html, which is
slightly dated. For more about the Predator, see the articles 'Technical overview of the Predator
PCI board from Eyetech' and 'Info & Specs. of Predator PCI board from Eyetech'
{pp}
5. As far as I know, the Voodoo3 operates fine with Cybergraphics. Cybergraphics is the standard
3rd party RTG system (apart from Picasso 96) and I'm using an old version (v3) with my
Cybervision64 3D on my A4000, and it works perfectly. The only trouble is old games that force
AGA/ECS screens that can't be promoted to Cybergraphics: Even ImageFX v1 works fine. Basically,
if you can make an app run on the WB screen, or on it's own screen via MUI etc., it will work
fine. I don't have any utils that doesn't work with it except Scala MM300. Any serious software in
the last four/five years is generally quite happy to run on a non-AGA screen.
{pp}
One problem you will have, with your 030 CPU, is still a slightly sluggish system in some
situations. For surfing the net, working with workbench etc. a graphics card really speeds things
up a lot - but remember you will be running in higher resolutions with greater colour depth; this
causes a lot more overhead for the CPU, and it shows when you try to do CPU intensive tasks (for
my 25Mhz 030 anyway), like moving lots of text/graphics around in wordworth, or using a vector
based drawing package like DrawStudio. Scrolling simple text also seems to be slower, but
scrolling graphics is a lot faster.
{pp}
In the end, you really need a graphics card to do serious work, and to do it comfortably you
need a CPU heaps faster than an 030. Personally I couldn't stand using AGA all the time, but you
may have different requirements.
{pp}
Perhaps you could consider the new AmigaONE which is coming out very soon. It will have
G3/G4 PPC CPU, PCI slots, AGP slot, on board IDE & USB, OS4.0, and you will still be able to
plug in your A1200 into it to run all your old programs. If your A1200 is already in a tower,
then perhaps you could get a Mediator + Voodoo 3. It isn't that cheap, but unfortunately AGA
was out of date when it was released. If your A1200 isn't already in a tower, and I was you, then
I'd wait for the AmigaONE. In fact, Amiga Inc. have a special offer - If you buy the party pack,
you can get $100 USD off an AmigaONE or get AmigaOS4.0 & 4.2 for free. The A1 is only a few
weeks/month away.. a phrase Amiga users seem to hear a lot. I'm confident Amiga will deliver on
this one, however.
