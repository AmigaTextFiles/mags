Well, it's the middle of Summer over here where I am, which means
nothing ever too serious for the next month or two ("serious" is one of
those words we don't use during the Summer).  So, with that in mind,
here's a few fun sites (I'll try to keep things as uninformative as I
can  :)  ).

{bold}Worst Of The Web{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.worstoftheweb.com/{noitalic}{p}
Let Buzz, Melvin, and Chip take you on a tour of the worst sites on the
wreb; those places that make you think "what were these guys THINKING
of".  Updated every weekday, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss three
hours goodbye as you start on your journey through their archives of
sites with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever.

{bold}NASA Photo Gallery{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.nasa.gov/gallery/photo/index.html{noitalic}{p}
Straight and simple.  This is where to get all those pictures NASA gets
of other planets, stars, nebula, space shuttle, mission patches, and other space
stuff.  Great backdrop potentials here.

{bold}Definitions Of Science Fiction{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.panix.com/~gokce/sf_defn.html{noitalic}{p}
Ever want a really GOOD definition of just what Science Fiction is?  Now
did you want about 30 of them? How's about if they're quoted from a
variety of science fiction authors and personalities?  Then just browse
over to this site and start reading.

{bold}The Big Book Of Amiga Hardware{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.amiga-hardware.com/{noitalic}{p}
If there's a piee of Amiga hardware, from full desktop to chip or
accelerator, chances are you'll find it here complete with the
manufacturer and complete info.  There's even a mystery corner with
pictures of some as-yet unidentified pieces of hardware.

{bold}The Fishman Affidavit{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/fishman/home.html{noitalic}{p}
If you're not a Scientology fan then you'll really enjoy this site; if
you are a fan then prepare to be educated.  Fishman was once heavily
into Scientology but when he finally found  out their top secrets he'd
decided it wasn't worth his money and started publishing all those
top-secret OT levels on the web.  What it contains reads like one of
Hubbard's science fiction stories (for those who DIDN'T know, L. Ron
Hubbard started out life as a Science Fiction author long before
Dianetics or Scientology).

Want to know why the name Xenu scares the upper-scientologists silly?  
Or pehraps you didn't know that Earth was once part of some galactic
federation started some 95 million years ago containing 75 planets
(you'd think that over that length of time it'ds get just a BIT bigger),
and that their cruel leader Xenu killed a whole bunch of his own
citizens in a mad population control plan and that their spirits
inhabiting us is what causes the wyhole of Human sins.

No, this isn't one of his stories- at least not that he ever admitted.
This is what Scientology is getting all those people paying the big
money to be taught.  Good material for the next Spielberg movie or brain
washing at it's best, you'll be both amuzed and shocked at the drek that
some people are being fed.  Definitely good for some laughs.
