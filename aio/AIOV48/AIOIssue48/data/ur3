This is a program designed to make viewing images on your Amiga a little easier, with it you set up something similar
to a database, where small thumbnails of your pictures can be saved and displayed whenever you want to. Pretty good
to have if you have a lot of images floating about on your harddrive and you want to have some control over them.
It has full support for datatypes which make it possible for you to view any type of image you have the datatype for,
using CyberShow. You can also do some basic image alterations, such as scaling the image, convert it into other
formats, etc.

The manual is sort of hazy written, could be divided a little more, but it's comprehensive, and there really isn't
much to argue about it. It holds what you need to know.
The configuration can either be handled by tooltypes, shell arguments or within the program, and there are thorough
explanations for each thing you can possibly think of, so there shouldn't be any trouble getting those fixed properly.

Using the program itself isn't very difficult, all you do is choose what directories you want to scan for images,
and wait for the thumbnails to be loaded and then you just doubleclick on them to see the whole image, you can then
play around a little with the image. There's also support for loading the pictures into different graphics processing
software, this is indeed a very handy feature and makes my life at least a little easier. If you have a bad memory
you can edit comments for each thumbnail if you want to.

This is a fast (depending on your computer specification) way of handling your images, there are really no things
that I can find that are negative with this program, so there's a relatively high score on this one.
