Realsoft and Hyperion Entertainment team up to bring Realsoft 3D to the Amiga.
Cologne, December 9, 2000.
{p} {p}
Realsoft and Hyperion Entertainment have entered into an agreement to bring
Realsoft's critically acclaimed and highly advanced 3D modelling and rendering
package to the Amiga. 'Realsoft 3D' is a full featured modelling, rendering,
animation and simulation software tool. Its predecessor, Real 3D, originated on
the Amiga all these years ago and was renowned for its powerful and innovative
tools. Now the new, rewritten 'Realsoft 3D' provides even more power and
introduces dozens of exciting innovations, all accessible through a very
carefully designed, intelligent, and user-friendly interface. This new interface
adapts to the skills of the user and helps him/her to master advanced 3D
techniques with surprising ease. Realsoft 3D is designed to meet the
requirements of today's 3D artist who requires extreme performance through an
easy to use, productive user interface.

Commenting on the agreement, Realsoft's managing director Vesa Meskanen
remarked: "The success of our 3D product line started on the Amiga platform.
This opportunity to port our latest product generation back to Amiga is
therefore very welcome. The platform independent design of Realsoft 3D together
with Hyperion Entertainment's knowledge about the latest developments of Amiga
OS entails that after the initial porting work is done, all our new software
releases will include the Amiga platform without further porting delays."

"We were extremely impressed by the feature-set of Realsoft 3D. This package
truly represents unbelievable value for money", said Ben Hermans, managing
partner of Hyperion Entertainment. "Through our activities in the field of
entertainment software, we have acquired enormous expertise in the field of 3D
graphics. We were looking for a way to leverage this expertise and apply it to
other areas. Given Realsoft's Amiga background, it seemed natural to approach
them. We are very excited that we can play a role in bringing back Real 3D's
successor to the Amiga."

Realsoft 3D will be available for Amiga OS 3.x and Amiga DE in the course of
2001. Requirements and further details to be announced.
