DVC, or Direct Version Checking, as it's really called, is an all new
sort of program for the Amiga, and one that I have always thought the
Amiga would benefit alot from having - namely, an easy and
comfortable-to-use way of reducing the time you spend on hunting new
versions of libraries, mcc's and other similar things. With DVC you
quite easilly set up a list of libraries, etc., to check for, then at
the click of a button DVC downloads the new versions to the
directories they are supposed to reside in as they become available
using your favourite browser.
{p} {p}
The program comes with a handy and easy install script which makes
the installation painless. The install program also takes care of the
first most vital configuration, such as the setup for the browser. If
you for some (strange) reason would like to unistall DVC there is an
additional script for that as well. After the main installation it is
time to configure the list of files you want checked.
{p} {p}
When you come across a website that uses the features of DVC, click
on the required link and the browser will start DVC, which checks the
configured lists, compares the versions of the files and if they
don't match you are given the option to download them and DVC
automatically puts it where it's supposed to be (at the moment only
AWeb 3.x supports this).
{p} {p}
At the moment I at least, haven't found anything else than being able
to download things using DVC from the official DVC homepage, but as
this is a beta release I think more and more people will ecentually
start using it, and when that happens I think this will become a
program you simply can't live without!
