Centipede is one of those games that will always be remembered in the
same breath as Pac Man. If you are an old games addict then you could
do a lot worse than adding Creepy Crawlies to your collection.
{p} {p}
When you load Creepy Crawlies you're greeted with the basic intro
screen with the options of one or two player action and viewing or
saving the hi scores. The 2-player game is a take turns scenario.
{p} {p}
Well into the game then.

The object is to shoot everything whether it moves or not. Your ship
can go in any direction to enable you to clear unwanted fruits and
fungi. All you have to do is read the prompt at the beginning of each
level and keep your finger on the fire button (or switch to auto
fire!).
{p} {p}
After the easy first few levels you have the chance to pick up
bonuses in shields, speed or firepower. Your firepower does become
very important as you progress.

There is so much in this game it would take too long to type it all
here. I found the spiders eggs level a bit tough!
{p} {p}
The graphics are excellent. The sound is very good and the
playability is among the best I've yet seen. Frank Schoxlau has
created a very worthy game. I wish I could think of some way to flesh
out this review.

Just download the game you won't regret it. Full marks.
