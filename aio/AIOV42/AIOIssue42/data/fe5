{bold}Solid Windows and click to front:{nobold}  When using solid winwods on your WB
(either from MCP or PowerWindows), and a click to front utility (aka:
pressing both mouse buttons down over a window to bring it to the
front), if the window you're clicking to front happens to a WB window
small enough to come under the maximum solid-dragging size limit you set,
then the pointer and screen will lock up.

{bold}Tools Daemon Extras:{nobold} A good companion program to ToolsDaemon is TDPrefs2.
This gives a better GUI for coniguring your menus, though after
saving it you still have to bring up the original ToolsDaemon GUI and
save it again there.  Still though, it's a better organized
presentation.

{bold}Avail Flush:{nobold}  Avail Flush >NIL: is a good line to stick into a WB menu or
slave to a hotkey.  Just run it after some big application (word
processor comes to mind) has just quit to clear up the loose ends.
