Dear Amiga Family:
{p} {p}
It is now November 2000, eleven months after we took over the helm of
Amiga. We have made some changes to the original plan, and continue
to do our best in carrying the vision forward.
{p} {p}
In the next two weeks, the next new product from Amiga will begin
shipping - Amiga OS 3.9!  This build has been designed specifically
for one group - You, the Amiga family.  We have been working very
closely with Haage and Partner in creating a great new product
offering for Amiga that you will all be very proud of.
{p} {p}
Will there be a 4.0?  This really depends on the sales of OS 3.9. 
You see, we did not have any plans for another version of the Classic
OS. But we continued to receive requests, and because we listen to
community, we decided to move ahead with Haage and Partner on this
project.  If OS 3.9 sells well, and we see a continuing need to
produce for the existing Classic Amiga platform, then there is a
strong possibility of a 4.0.
{p} {p}
It is in your hands.
{p} {p}
No matter what happens, AmigaDE is still moving ahead quickly and we
look forward to delivering another version of the Amiga Software
Development Kit (SDK) with new features and enhancements. In the
coming weeks, we will be adding 3D and sound to AmigaDE.
{p} {p}
There are many more exciting things happening at Amiga and I look
forward to sharing with you all of the great details, and
announcements in Koln, Germany in December.  I look forward to
meeting all of you there, at the Amiga World tradeshow. Bring a
friend!
{p} {p}
Looking forward to a great visit in Koln, and a wonderful holiday
season,
{p} {p}
Bill McEwen and the rest of the Amiga team.
