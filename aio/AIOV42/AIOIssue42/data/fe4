In recent months there have finally been accumulating a growing number
of plug-ins for browsers, but not everyone out there may know some of
them exist.  So, as a service I've compiled a list of the names of
some of these plug-ins and which PC-world versions they simulate.  If
you know of any other plug-ins available then please email me and I'll
add them to the list.
