This game has been around in much the same format since 1991 or 1992.
It goes to show that people like nothing better than competing
against a mate and doing everything it takes to win.
{p} {p}
When you open the drawer you are presented with three choices: The
game, practice mode and the docs (this is on the 7.2 version.).
{p} {p}
The docs are brief and tell you all you need to know about the game
but you don't have to read them to be able to play Extreme Violence.
{p} {p}
The practice mode is great because you can play against a computer
opponent and strengthen your play for when your mates turn up. The
computer is a bit predictable but you get to learn tactics and what
each item does.
{p} {p}
The 2-player mode is the strength of Extreme Violence. You load the
game and are faced with the options screen after one press of the
fire button. This screen tells you all about the items you can pick
up in the game. You can chose between keyboard or joystick (the
better option) and several other tasty options if you read the docs
(I have to!). When you press to start the game you get an overview of
the arena and where the items are located.
{p} {p}
The object of the game is to kill your opponent ten times to be the
winner. That's it. Not hard to grasp even by my standards.
{p} {p}
You enter an arena that is littered with walls to block your bullets
and make the game a little harder. The first level has ten walls. The
second has twelve. The third has fourteen and so on until one person
scores ten kills and the game ends.
{p} {p}
The controls are very simple. Move the joystick in the direction you
want your man to go and press the fire button to shoot. A word of
caution here: One press of the fire button and your bullet will go
the length of the arena. Keep your finger on the fire button and your
bullets only travel the distance you can see in your screen.
{p} {p}
The final thing of note is the little radar image at the bottom of
the screen. This shows where you are in relation to your opponent. It
can be very handy.
{p} {p}
There are several quirks to the game, which I won't tell you about
because it's more fun to find out yourself but they all add to the
playability of Extreme Violence.
{p} {p}
As far as the game goes the graphics and sound are serviceable. The
strength is in the playability in 2-player mode. It's truly
excellent. Simon Green has made this Amos game one of the most
enjoyable around.
