December and the end of the first year of the new millenium already!
Okay, setting aside you guys that insist the millenium doesn't start
until 2001, I hereby respond with the known fact that the calendar is 5
years off anyway and the millenium started in 1996, so there!
{p} {p}
That aside, here' some sites to keep you busy during all this depressing
holiday cheer.
{p} {p}

The Public 8 Ball{p}
http://8ball.federated.com/{p}
Have some mystery you'd like solved?  Perhaps a question that's been
nagging you.  well, here's your solution. Take a turn on the old
faithful Magic 8 Ball.  NOT a computer simulation mind you, but an
actual Magic 8 Ball hooked up to a mechanism that will turn it.  Just
enter in your question, the guy's computer gives the ball a shake, and
then you view your answer through a webcam aimed right at it.
Technology at it's finest?

The Duct Tape Guys{p}
http://www.octanecreative.com/ducttape/{p}
If you still aren't convinced that Duct Tape has more uses then paper,
then just check this site out.  Wacky uses for Duct Tape, Duct Tape
fashion, pictures of people and ducks hanging from walls by duct tape
alone, duct tape mini-movies, and a whole lot more.  Enough to make you
quack.{p}
And here I thought it was just good for my Halloween projects.

SecurityGeeks{p}
http://securitygeeks.shmoo.com/{p}
What with internet security being as chancy as it's been of late, here's
a site to keep track of developments in computer security, cryptology, and all
matters of compu-privacy.  Read or contribute your own.

Joe's Amiga Central{p}
http://www.joesamigacentral.com{p}
Another amiga homepage, this one in a continual state of development so
updates are fairly regular.  Links to all things Amiga, broken down into
hardware and software categories, the Amiga history and past models our
beloved machine posted, and a regular update of all the major Amiga news
items.  Throw in some download space (he takes suggestions on what to
offer), and a yet-to-be-used mesage board, and the place is shaping up
pretty good.

Pick Of The Month

Planetarion{p}
http://www.planetarion.com{p}
Remember TradeWars from the old BBS days?  Well, online gaming has
advanced much since then and now Tradewars at last has a proper sucessor
and it's name is Planetarion.
{p} {p}
Registratioon is free, entering under your chosen name, player name, and
planet name.  You get 1 planet and 1 asteroid, and from there the object
is the standard: beat up a bunch of other players.  Space here is
divided up into sectors, galaxies, and the like, with all 20 people in a
given galaxy allying up before the rest of the universe finds them.  
Build up your production by searching for more asteroids, ,research like crazy,
and try to get a good defense going before you become a target.  Iyt's a
big universe out there and so little time to conquer it all.
{p} {p}
The site uses java script, of which Voyager sometimes chokes but AWeb
seems to perform on okay.  Layout is nice and docs are online.
Everything is pretty clearly presented and the learning curve is pretty
intuitive.  There's even bulletin boards accesssed only by others of
your same galaxy so you can exchange tactics, as advise of more 
experienced players, and send up a flare for some needed help.
{p} {p}
In general this thing is addictive, if you can survive past potential
enemies finding you too soon.  So, just log on and leave me alone... I'm 
busy fending off two attackers already.
