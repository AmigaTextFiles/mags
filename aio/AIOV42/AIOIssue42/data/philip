Dear Sir's,
{p} {p}
I wish to resurrect my standard A1200, could u point me into the right
direction for, ie hard drive, I'm led to believe a laptop HD 2.5" will fit
into a A1200 with no modification, also required would be a CD-ROM drive,
memory and accelerator.
{p} {p}
Could you please help as it seems such a waste it being stored in my loft.
{p} {p}
Regards
{p} {p}

Phillip,
Resurrecting your basic A1200 system from scratch is obviously going
to involve purchasing a  CPU expansion board, a HDD, and some RAM.
{p} {p}
To decide what you really need, you have to know what you want to do
with your A1200. For surfing the net, playing MP3s, and playing newer
games, you really need an 040 processor. If you are considering using
the 1200 seriously, then an 040 is really a minimum requirement. You
can still surf the net and play a lot of games with an 030, but keep
in mind a similarly clocked 040 is more than 4 times faster, and the
030 will be a bit sluggish playing games like Doom or decoding jpeg
pictures on a web site.

Some popular CPU boards include:
{p} {p}
Blizzard{p}
Apollo{p}
Viper
{p} {p}
You can buy these new, but sometimes you can pick up a bargain in
your local Trading post/classifieds, or auctioning sites such as ebay
or sold.com.au.
{p} {p}
You should be able to pick these up second hand for a few hundred
dollars AUD. Now, if you don't feel like putting your A1200 into a PC
tower, and you want a CDROM, then the cheapest option is buy a CPU
board with a SCSI2 interface on it, or purchase a Squirrel SCSI unit.
The Squirrel plugs into the PCMCIA port, and is apparently very easy
to use, but does not autoboot SCSI HDs, so you will still need a 2.5"
boot drive. SCSI will simplify things *greatly*. SCSI HDDs are
cheaper ($60 AUD / ~$35 USD for 1GB), and CDROMs are around $20 AUD /
$12 USD for a quad speed. Your only other option is to use a 2.5" HD,
which are quite a lot more expensive ($100 AUD / ~$60 USD for 200MB),
and for the CDROM, you will need a custom PCMCIA interface. As far as
I know, these are expensive, hard to get hold of, and problematic. A
bonus feature of SCSI CD ROMs is that from AmigaOS 3.1, scsi CD ROM
support is built in, whereas an IDE ATAPI drive will require
commercial software (unless you want to put up with shareware  demos
on aminet).
{p} {p}
As far as memory is concerned, you need at least 8MB, but seeing FP
memory is relatively cheap these days, there is no excuse to have any
less than 16MB. 16MB will allow you to surf the net,  IRC, and ICQ
all at the same time. When you do buy simms, make sure you get FP
memory, if possible, because EDO can cause troubles (apparently, but
not in my experience) and is no faster  in Amiga machines than FP.
{p} {p}
If you just want to get your Amiga up and running with internet, a
few games and a word processor, then a 200MB HDD should be fine. 1GB
or more would be ideal.
{p} {p}
For new hardware/software, look in the dealers list on www.amiga.com
for a local dealer, or try an online shop such as www.vesalia.de.
{p} {p}
Having external SCSI devices is still going to require a mini tower
case, to power your HDD and CD ROM, as well as house them. Make sure
you get an AT case, because ATX supplies require modifications to
work without a motherboard present. Another bonus with an AT case is
that you can tap your A1200's power from the AT supply, so you don't
need that wimpy little brick you are probably using at the moment.
{p} {p}
The next thing you need to worry about is the operating system. The
latest OS is AmigaOS 3.9, released only a few days ago. This release
requires v40.68 ROMs (3.1), so if you have only OS 3.0 installed, you
will have to upgrade the ROMs. OS 3.9 costs around $80 AUD (~$45
USD), and 40.68 ROMs are about $80 AUD also.
{p} {p}
For really showing off an Amiga, you need a graphics card. Sadly, the
cheapest options for a A1200 start at $500 AUD, with a Zorro IV kit
and a Zorro 3 graphics card, or the Pixel64 board. This involves
putting the whole thing into a PC tower, and at this stage you might
be considering either a PPC CPU board with a Blizzard Vision PPC
video card, or a big box A3000/A4000.
{p} {p}
Most software you will need is available as shareware on aminet
(de.aminet.net, us.aminet.net, uk.aminet.net). There is a lot of
documentation out there to get you started - aminet is a goldmine,
but there is also the Amiga Link Directory (you can find a link to it
on www.amiga- news.de/indexe.shtml), and search.amiga.org.

Well, hopefully that will point you in the right direction. As there
isn't a lot of detail here, you will have to do a lot of research
yourself. Perhaps a 'getting started with Amigas guide' is needed in
a future issue of AIO?
