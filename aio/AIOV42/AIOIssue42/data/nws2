As if the Amiga market wouldn't be small enough... Not only Amiga-users are
copying Amiga-software, but also even well-known Amiga-companies don't seem to
shrink back from distributing and selling illegal copies.
{p} {p}
Which steps can the user take against this?
{p} {p}
If you have bought a pirate copy of our software from a company, send or give it
back to them immediately, insist on an exchange into another original-software
or back into money and please inform us about this incident. You are in the
right to do this! If the distributer doesn't play too, please contact us to make
sure if the software you bought really is a pirate copy. If yes, please bring a
charge against the distributor or user! This report to the police does not
depend on the home country of the distributor (home or abroad), and it does not
cost you any money!

How do I recognize a pirate copy of APC&TCP-Software?
{p} {p}
Recognising pirates copies of APC&TCP-software is quite easy:
{p} {p}
· APC&TCP does not use any selfprinted Covercards or booklets which are, for
example, designed and printed by a inkjet-printer. The only exception is Scene
Archives #9!!!
{p} {p}
· APC&TCP does not use any paper labels on the CDs. If we are releasing a
production on CDR, we use silver CDRs without any inscription nor any paper
label!
{p} {p}
· The products Flyin High, Pinball Brain Damage, Kargon, Jaktar, Marblelous 1,2,
Databench, 1990 are delivered in cardboard boxes only
{p} {p}
· The products Flyin High, Pinball Brain Damage, Best of Scee Archives, DEKUBI,
Games Attack, Amiga Times, APC&TCP-CD-Volume 1,2,4,5,6 have been CD-pressed and
have a professional inscription (Siebdruckverfahren). We did not use any CDRs in
these cases!
{p} {p}
If you are in doubt wether you own a pirate or an original copy please ask us!
{p} {p}
It seems to be that all these incidents and bad news from the last weeks didn't
stop the company Alive MEDIASOFT from sell pirate copies of our software. :(
{p} {p}
Even a few German and English Amiga-distributors who bought software from Alive
haven't been disturbed by this also. Otherwise I can't find any reason for a
German dealer to buy software from an ordinary dealer in the UK instead of
buying it from a legitimated, German wholesaler or directly from the developer.
:(
{p} {p}
Due to this I beg to inform you about the following:
{p} {p}
· APC&TCP has just one single distributor: GTI
{p} {p}
· Epic Marketing UK (not Epic Germany!!) hasn't been our English distributor for
a long time and hasn't been supplied by us with anything. Epic UK does also not
receive any legal software from our company by other middlemen. Epic UK should
not have one single product of APC&TCP in their stock after a whole year
(products which haven't been payed for anyway), so they can't offer nor sale any
of our products. If this should be the case anyway - well, it should be clear
enough what exactly is sold there :(
