This game is utter pap. Wow, what a way to start a review, I hear
you say. Of course that I am not going to make such a statement
gratuitously, I will explain clearly why this game is in for a bit of
bashing.
{p} {p}
The first thing we must bear in mind is that the Amiga has already
got a big number of racing games to choose from. Whether you are
looking for a serious simulation (F1 GP) or simple fun (the Lotus
trilogy, Jaguar, Skidmarks, Wheelspin, etc) you are more than likely
to find something that would suit yourself. There is no point in
making a racing game that offers nothing new.
{p} {p}
This is the first major problem you encounter with Joyride: the
programmers haven't spaded anything new; we have seen it all before.
{p} {p}
Upon loading Joyride you are greeted with the main menu. You can
choose to start a new game, go to the options screen or quit the
game. Niggle number 2: the game seems to be big and there is no
password system or load and save feature.
{p} {p}
In the options menu you can fiddle with various aspects of the game,
such as the control system (only keys or joystick-mouse is not
supported), the acceleration system, the number of players (1 or 2.
Unfortunately, 2 player games are of the take turns variety, which is
a real pity-the game would have been much better could you play it
with a mate at the same time. So you can't beat your friend-unless
you punch him, that's it), whether to have automatic or manual gears,
the screen size (only 2 screens sizes provided:030 and 040), and the
difficulty level.
{p} {p}
Before each race, you get to select your car from the 3 available:
there is the general good-all-round car, the fast car with crappy
tires and the slow car with good gripping.
{p} {p}
After picking your car, you are presented with a map for the next
track. It would have been a better idea to have the map displayed
during the actual race. Anyway, it's time to burn some rubber! If you
chose "030" screen size you will gaze in disbelief at the lousy
screen you are presented with."040" is a tad better.
{p} {p}
The first thing you notice is how well the steering wheel looks.
Sadly, when you begin to play the damn thing you realize that behind
some decent graphics there lies an extremely average game. Something
as pivotal as overtaking is incredibly frustrating. No matter how
good you are, you will always crash your contraption against the
opponent's.
{p} {p}
The game is littered with sampled speech, which is good the first
time around but soon gets in your nerves.
{p} {p}
The in game graphics are good, particularly the opponent's cars. The
effect when your windscreen breaks is very realistic. The biggest
drag is that the circuits are flat. There is no undulating terrain of
any kind; not a hill, nothing! Early 3D racers like Xtreme racing and
Virtual Karting could get away with it, but in the year 2000 this can
not be forgiven. The standard Amiga nowadays could easily handle a
game with undulating terrain. The flat terrain is insulting and
completely preposterous, and only serves to patronize a computer that
should have been credited with the ability to employ true 3D GFX.
{p} {p}
This should not have broken Joyride's back. What really kills the
game is that it is not very playable. As a matter of fact, it's very
boring-not to mention difficult. Perhaps if the programmers had spent
more time in how the game plays instead of how realistic the steering
wheel turns, they could have come up with a much better game.
{p} {p}
The Amiga is still lacking a true 3D "casual" racing game-we have
both Alien F1 and Wipeout for the serious fan and the futuristic
arcade fan. We could have had a classic game here. It was marred by
the programmer's lack of risk-taking.
{p} {p}
On the plus side, it must be said that Joyride boast some very
attractive graphics, particularly in the options and game over
screens, and that the music is moody enough.
{p} {p}
Unfortunately, the game is not really enjoyable, and I sincerely
don't believe that anybody would give up his copy of (insert your
favourite racer here) to play this.
