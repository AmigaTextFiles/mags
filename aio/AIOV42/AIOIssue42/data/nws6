Here's something very interesting, which appears to be from some of the old
phase 5 team.. read their press release below, which includes spelling mistakes
so you can tell this really is a phase 5 style document :-)

Dual G3/G4 microATX Mainboard - Codename PEGASOS
{p} {p}
With it's PEGASOS development bplan GmbH of germany brings PowerPC performance
to the Power Users!
{p} {p}
By using a modular system design, the mainboard can be easily upgraded to fit
the needs and demands of the users. With todays standard interfaces already
integrated into the PEGASOS mainboard, users will be able to easily connect
standard components (such as hard drives or CD-Rom drives ) and a wide range of
high-end devices such as digital video cameras to the system.
{p} {p}
While PEGASOS itself is widely scaleable to the users needs, it is an easy task
for retailers or OEMs to configure the system for their demands. By hitting the
best price/performance point for the selected configuration, systems starting
with one CPU (at entry level) to multiple PPC G4 based cluster computers can be
build useing the same hardware.
