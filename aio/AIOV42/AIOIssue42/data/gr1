Now then boys and girls I'm going to tell you a little story about
two blokes from Finland called Mika and Henrik. Are you sitting
comfortably? Then I'll begin.
{p} {p}
It all starts in the hazy days of 1982 and the VIC 20. A year where
the only thing happening, if you were in the right place, was a game
called Omega Race. According to Henrik the greatest game on the VIC
20 and the most disappointing game conversion when he bought his
Commodore 64. With this in mind he and his friend Mika decided to
create the game they loved on the Amigas they now owned. Amega Race
was thus born and they both lived happily ever after but can we???
Personally I've never heard of Omega Race but I downloaded Amega Race
and thought I'd give it a go.

I jammed it onto my hard drive, opened up the AR drawer....instructions or game....GAME!

The intro is a short story about why you are playing Amega Race and
if left alone you get the instructions. Handy since I didn't read the
readme file.

Pressing the fire button kicks you straight into the game. The screen
mode is very crisp to look at even though it is in Hires interlaced.
There is virtually no flicker.  You'll notice right away that the
game is an asteroids clone and that the score, level and remaining
lives information are in a box in the middle of the screen, which is
a permanent feature of the game. There in no colour and hardly any
sound so all that's left is playability, which this game has. The
playability factor is exactly the same as any asteroids game. It has
the same control method and you find yourself playing over and over
until you beat your last score and then playing some more.

Amega Race has only three enemies: Crawlers (not my description. They
look more like cogs) which can change into viruses if left alone and
mines which are deposited by the viruses. All you have to do is shoot
everything on the screen that moves to complete the level.

It's so simple and quite addictive. I like it a lot.
