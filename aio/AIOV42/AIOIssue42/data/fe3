Just a reminder that the survey is still going on.  we've had some
responses but I know there's a lot more out there that have always
wanted to speak your mind to Amiga, so now's the time.

For those that missed last issue, let me recap.  I thought it was
about time to see what the Amiga Community thought of the recent
efforts of the mother company.  So, with that in mind, you will find
an ascii file in the root direction of this issue (AIOIssue42/survey).
Just put your answers into an email (Give the question numbers next
your each of your answers), and send it off to:{p}
survey@aio.co.uk

We'll publish the results in a future issue.
