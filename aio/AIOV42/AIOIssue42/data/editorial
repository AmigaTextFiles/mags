Well, the first year oif the new millenium is almost gone but with it
comes a new start on life for our favorite machine.  Amiga gets a new
OS upgrade (and the first reasonablly priced one in ages) for the
Holidays, an AmigaOne upgrade board is coming out for A4000s and
A1200s, and the Os of the future is well on track.  Things are
definitely looking up.

It's been a long and bumpy road, with more then the occasional bridge
out and sometimes without even any road!  But, it looks like there's
finally a light at the end of the tunnel, and perhaps before too long
all us patient people can at last say to the world "See?  Told you
so!".  There's still a ways to go, but at least now we can see both
goal and results.

It is thus on this note that I would like to end the year.  A note of
hope, and what a determined Community can do when it sets it's sights.
 Perhaps Jay Miner can rest more peacefully now knowing that his
creation yet has new life, that the spirit of the Amiga is renewed and
lives on in the coming generation of computing.

May the coming year see all your dreams come true; seeing the new
Amiga in the wings, I know mine already have.

Happy Holidays..
