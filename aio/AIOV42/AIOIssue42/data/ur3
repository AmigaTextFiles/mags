This program is a small and extremely usable program, especially if
you find yourself using the Shell alot, an alias file is a little
(only 2200 bytes!) file that points to where an executable to a
program lies. The alias files reside best in the C:, where you then
just easilly type the name of the alias file and the program will be
launched. Now, some of you might ask why this all the sudden is so
good? Since it's not exactly hard making scripts yourself that does
almost the precise same thing, well, maybe I'm just lazy then,
because this certainly falls in the category of programs I use. The
only thing I feel missing in this program is the ability to create
several aliases at the same time, this would indeed save a lot of
time. When you have created the alias it copies the real executable's
icon, you might wonder why this is necessary, and.. uh, well, I
wonder that too, as a matter of fact. Well, it might be usable if you
have a directory filled with different aliases and want it to look a
little nicer, I suppose.

MakeAlias was created using CanDo, thus it requires you to have
cando.library, plus a few more like wbrun.library, but most people
should have these already. That's really all there is to the
installation part for this program, other than making sure having the
libraries necessary, just stuff the drawer whereever you like and
start creating those aliases!

"Retraceicon" is the name of another program coming in the MakeAlias
archive. This program is used to, as the name suggests, goes to the
directory where the alias file points to the executable and opens it.
This too can prove to be pretty useful.
