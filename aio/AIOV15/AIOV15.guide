  Ok... we are back. Yes another month has past, it seems like I have just
finished the last issue and now am releasing the new issue, where does the
time go? you are probably bored of me saying that because each month seems
to fly by and we are now up to our 15th issue, thats 15 months of making
AIO which is an awful long time when you consider many other magazines
don't make it past issue 10.

 A very very sad moment for the Amiga community is the closure of CuAmiga
magazine, one of the only two major Amiga printed magazines has finally
closed. There is alot of speculation of why it has closed but the official
text from the CuAmiga web site explains that Emap where unhappy with the
amount of sales and they where producing CuAmiga at a loss. This is 
very bad news leaving just one printed magazine widely available for the
Amiga. Good news for Amiga Format and maybe the death of CuAmiga can bring
new life to AF giving it more adverts and making the magazine bigger with
more articles.

 The death of CuAmiga has spured me to plan a big advertising blitz for AIO
over the next few months which will hopefully give the Amiga community
something extra to read. Expect to see more details of this over the
comming months.

 This months issue bring a new section being the 'Sceners Section' at
this time we do not have an editor for this section and it will only
be a regular section in AIO if an editor can be found. As the closure
of CuAmiga is quite a big issue at the moment we are running a hot
topic letters page for next month on your idea about the closure of
CuAmiga, check out the @{"HOT TOPIC" link "ht" } page.

 After all the bad news we are pleased to bring you this issue of AIO
and hope you can enjoy reading it this month, we expect to see you back
next month and thankyou for your readership and the few who have 
contributed.

@{fg shine} Digital Candy BBS to close@{fg text}

     ===================================================

     *    V E R Y   I M P O R T A N T   N O T I C E    *

                  Digital Candy BBS to CLOSE.

     ===================================================

Is there any point in running Digital Candy now?

Few calls, not many new files, I think not.

Thanx must go out to Majic Mushroom, Darkus, Devistator, Cool96, dEF
bASE!, Sn0zZ, eXON and all the Co Sys Ops who have been very supportive
when times were bad and quiet BUT there comes a time when what little you
have is not enuff to satify the Many, its a shame that the Internet has
become so popular and that for the price of a local phone call you get
most files found on Digital candy BBS, Even the parties have there own web
sites with all the releases on nowadays, so why pay a long distance or
national price call when you can get the same for a local call, i
appreciate that NOT all people have access to the net but most of the user 
on here do.

So it has been decided that Digital Candy ( BBS ) will close, not straight
away but shortly, I have a few ideas where to go from now, as a few of you
already know that i have spoken to, for those who i have not spoken to
MAIL me ( SIMBA ) and i'll fill you in to whats gonna happen now.

Our web site will still remain the most active part of Digital Candy and
all news about releases and what we are doing will be posted there.

@{fg shine} Putty Squad for the Amiga@{fg text}

Alive Mediasoft Announces Putty Squad

Putty Squad is coming to the Amiga!

Yes that's right - Putty Squad is finally going to be released courtesy
of Alive Mediasoft.

This little platform game caused quite a stir in the Amiga community
when it was dropped by its creators upon completion of the game.

Ever since then, Amiga owners have been crying out for someone to take
it on and get it released....well, their waiting is over!

Putty Squad is 100% complete. It will be released on disk for the A1200
with a possibility of a CD-ROM version.

Putty Squad is hard-drive installable and is compatible with 060 and 030
Amigas. Testing is currently underway on 040 and PPC.

AmigaSoc UK User Group Plans Trip To Cologne Show

AmigaSoc does Cologne II: This time it's personal

AmigaSoc is organising a trip to Cologne for Computer 98. We'd therefore
like to extend an invitation to all Amigans in the UK to come along.
We're aiming to try and offer a cut-price trip (including accomodation,
where possible, but on a first come, first served basis). Presently
we're only able to deal with user groups (and also developers/retailers)
primarily for convenience... but also to encourage people to join their
local user group.

Our choice for accomodation is the Hotel Berg
(http://www.hotel-berg.com/), who are offering quite an aggressive
discount for groups. If you wish to stay somewhere else, you'll have to
organise that yourself (but by all means, we're happy to include you in
the flights). For other hotels in Cologne, have a look at
www.cologne-hotels.com. Our chosen airline is British Midland who are
also offering some good deals for groups, although Eurostar is also a
possibility.
In total, people can expect to pay less than 200 pounds for the flight
and the accomodation. The accomodation only includes bed and (a fairly
minimal) breakfast.

We will require people to pay up front in order to book the flight and
the accomodation. Naturally, AmigaSoc will not make any money from this.
We are purely interested in encouraging as many people from the UK to
come to Cologne this year as possible.

AmigaSoc visited Cologne for the first time last year, and we firmly
believe that if this show is anything like that, you'll be kicking
yourself if you miss it. Imagine a show like the generic computer shows
that used to be held in Earl's Court in the 80s. Imagine a show where
70% of those stands have Amiga stuff in there. Plus, we at AmigaSoc
certainly don't want to miss any big announcements.

We require all payments and bookings to reach us no later than the 20th
September 1998.

For further details contact andrew@uk.amigasoc.org.

Eyelight Announces Tornado 3D V2.0 Upgrade and It's Free For 1.X Owners

ROME, ITALY (August 5, 1998) Eyelight is pleased to announce that the
long awaited 2.0 "Professional" update to Tornado3D is ready. Tornado3D
is a state-of-the-art 3D graphics package for the Amiga, geared towards
the professional market. Tornado3D 2.0 adds new hi-end features, many of
them never before available on the Amiga, to the already powerful
arsenal of Tornado3D 1.5 and is a free upgrade for customers of V1.x.

Registered users can request V2.0 for free from Tornado3D's web site at
http://www.tornado3d.com

"There are still many professionals in the Amiga market, but in 3D
graphics up-to-date software and speed are not an option and they find
increasingly difficult to stay competitive with existing tools," said
Massimiliano Marras, Eyelight's CEO. "That's why we focused on
supporting modern hardware such as the PowerPC processors and 3D
accelerated graphics cards. Those Amigas, coupled with AmigaOS's
realtime heart and the many unique features of Tornado3D, are the best
replica of a graphics workstation we can think of -and we have used many
of them."

Tornado3D 2.0 builds on the firm ground of V1.5 and adds features like
Meshpainting, Dynamic Fractal Triangles, Bones and Muscles, Meta Organic
Modeling, Hairs and Fur and an internal programming language. And while
price for V2.0 went up to $520.00 both competitive upgrade and
educational discounts were introduced to allow everybody to become part
of the ever growing family of Tornado3D users.

Tornado3D is the pionieer product of Eyelight, a 3D Graphics and
animation firm located in Rome, Italy. Please contact Mrs. Paola Barbon
at +39-06-51965487 or send email to info@tornado3d.com for more
information.

@node "gr1" "501 Darts"

@{fg shine} 501 Darts@{fg text}

 Starting with a score of 501 or 301, each player takes turns to throw 3
darts in an attempt to get their score to 0 first. Hitting a score of 0
must be done exactly by use of a Double number or a Bullseye.

              eg. If you have a score of 40, a Double 20 is needed.
                  If you have a score of 50, a Bullseye may be used.

 When a player finishes with a Double/Bullseye they win a LEG. When the
player then reaches a pre-defined number (1-10) of LEGS, a SET is then
awarded. The match winner is the player with the most SETS won within the
Best Of a pre-defined number of SETS. Single matches between Human players
and/or CPU players, or a 1 Player SEASON MODE can be played.

 Oh yes, this is a darts game, and as well as the standard 501 and 301
detailed above you can also play Around the Clock, where you have to hit
the numbers 1 to 20 in the quickest possible time.

 To throw the darts you are presented with a cross hair which wiggles
about making it harder for you to hit the number you want. Of cource you
can turn this off by going into the test menu (Press `T' on the Main
Menu screen), but that is surposed to be a cheat!

 The game is great fun, but more so in two player mode, as you can fight
a full blown competition, without jabbing darts into the kitchen door, or
your wall (Yes, I`m crap at real darts).

 The graphics are nicely done, on 1 player mode, you can see the bloke
throwing the dart at the board, although, I think the graphics on this
screen aren`t as good as the dart board, it makes the game a bit more
fun to play!

 Another good idea is the bloke talking, when you get 60, 100, or 180 he
calls out the number, the voice sounds a bit fed up, but its much better
than the narrator.device!

 Overall, this is a great game to bring out when your friends are over,
and you can`t find any really good 2 player games. Also good when you
want a game of darts!

@{fg shine} Moped - Plubz 2@{fg text}

 This is the story taken from the AmigaGuide...

It all started a long long, really long time ago. A rich man, also a
professor,  bought  a new pair of socks. He actually enjoyed his old
pair,  but  said: "What the heck!" Anyway, this man obviously... Bla
bla  bla  bla...  with  flashing lights... Bla bla bla... a horrible
hedache  because  of  those blue, circular things... Bla bla bla bla
bla  bla  bla...  Then  he said to the much taller man: "And that my
friend, is how we know that a rabbit can't wear glasses!"

... It's a Tetris-style game. 

 Well, not much help there!

 This is a puzzle games from N.C Gamez, you can move around in a little
4×4 grid and you have to sort out the coloured objects in rows or
colums, you can suck an object up by pressing SPACE and move it around
using the arrow keys, to drop it press SPACE again. This all sounds
simple, but if two different pieces hit each other they both explode!!

 The game is highly playable, and if there is enough responce the author
might make a 2 player version!!

 There are 5 difficulty levels, 5 being the hardest where there is
hardly any room to move!

 The graphics and sound are cool, all the elements make this one of the
best games I have played in ages!

@node "gr3" "WB Mini Arcanoid"

@{fg shine} Mini Arcanoid@{fg text}

 Its been a while since i've written a games review as that job is normally
left upto Lee Hesselden who does a great job but this month he has been
away from the aminet and has only had a chance to do two reviews so here
I am making more work for myself and doing the rest!

 Mini Arcanoid is... as you probably guessed a small arcanoid game, with
the small being workbench, so to cut a long story short its arcanoid in
a workbench window. You know the type of game, something you play while
waiting for a disk to copy or a file to download or anything else that
takes plenty of time and leaves you bored. Well now boredom has been
killed and its fun all the way with this game.

 The idea of the game is to destroy all the blocks by bouncing the little
ball off your bat at the bottom of the screen and *trying* to control it
so it hits the blocks you want it to destroy, once all the blocks have
gone you can proceed to the next level and so on. Although this is a WB
game and only small it is great, it has many features that even some
proper arcanoid games don't have. The best overall feature is the game
can be moved to any WB compatible window like dopus or cygnused and be
played on that window if you are doing something on another window. At
any time in the game you can just pause it and finish what you are doing
or start to copy another disk then carry on playing.

 Overall a great little game that shouldn't be missed by anyone who is
always doing time consuming things. GREAT!

@{fg shine} Damage "The Sadistic Butchering of Humanity"@{fg text}

 Damage is a game with not much object, you have one objective and that 
is to kill anyone and everyone. The game is viewed front on showing a 
little man which is you. The story is that you have gone mad, your name 
used to be Michael Modelcitizen but now you are Mike Massacre and your 
mission is to kill everyone. You are armed with various weapons from the 
basic baseball bat to mini guns and rocket launchers which can all be 
selected using the 'F' keys.

 The idea is kill them before they kill you, the whole world is after you
encluding the home guard, fbi, police, army and many other government
organisations. You start off having to kill an old granny with a walking
stick and then shooting armed police and even down to school children
and dogs.

 This game you will either love or hate, I definatly wouldn't recommend
it to anyone under the age of 15 and to anyone who is easily disturbed.
The graphics maybe small but they show blood and gore galore. This is
just a preview and the full game can be bought for 15 USD, 20 DM, 10 GBP,
90 SEK, 50 FIM

 Overall a fun game for some but others maybe offended, you'll either
love it or hate it. Worth checking out.... maybe this will be banned?!!?

@{fg shine} Workbench Pet 2@{fg text}

 Yes, before I even started the review I could hear you all screaming
and shouting, 'oh no not another wb pet' well yes... and.... no. This
one is different, it is actually funny for a change and has some 
interesting features that are very amusing.

 The best bit about this WbPet is the stress relief corner where you can
do most of the funny bits. There is a chance to make your pet the 
firestarts, a person out of the Full Monty, get crapped on by a bird,
burp, be a DJ and a few other less funny things.

 As with all pets you have to feed it and play with it. There are three
different games, dodge the asteroids, stone scissors and paper and a
small maze game where you have to collect 5 cherries (yes cherries, don't
ask me why!)

 Overall its worth downloading for a laugh but the lifespan as usual with
these pet things is short, you'll use it once, laugh, then delete it.
Well worth checking out for a first time but don't expect it to last
you more than 10 minutes (if that!)

@node "Cheat" "Cheats and tips"

@{fg shine} Cheats for some older games@{fg text}

@{B}Cannon Fodder@{ub}

Click on the LOAD icon and press and hold both Mouse Buttons for 5 seconds
(and then release), a screen will appear offering you a HARDMAN option and
Level Section.

Go to the save game option, then the game requests a name type "JOOLS".
Cheat mode active will flash at the bottom of the screen and the ranks
and abilities of your men will have increased. It may be "JOOLSA".

Hints:
1)In Choppas, land on the enemy to kill them, safer than landing and
getting out.

2)In missions, where you have control of a lot of troopers seperate the
lowest ranking trooper from the rest and give him all the weapons, make
sure the rest are safe, then attempt the mission with one trooper. If the
trooper dies just press <ESC>. This saves a lot of troopers later, such as
in mission 18 phase 5 of 5 - The Door.

3)Troopers are able to throw grenades quite along way and over walls,
trees, and buildings. Use this to your advantage to protect against
Biggunz and Jeeps. To throw a grenade a long way, simply position the
pointer further than needed.

4)Buildings can be destroyed even if you can't see them. For instance, if
a trooper is in Biggun and there is a building slightly off the edge of
the screen, roughly aim at the building making sure the pointer is at the
very edge of the screen and fire.

5)Learn to control Jeeps and Skidooz early on (how to skid them). In later
levels you may need good control to hit ramps at correct angles otherwise
you can blow up if you hit walls. This is also useful to get away from
shells, rockets, and grenades.

6)An effective way of destroying snipers is to just run straight towards
them and shoot you guns. Don't waste grenades on them unless it is
necessary.

Here is some information on where the Supa Dupa range of weapons can be
found. There is only one of each Supa Dupa product, so they're spread out
across the game from mission eight onwards:

Missile - Mission 8, Phase 3:
Go to the bottom right corner of the screen and it's hidden behind a big
bush.

Bullet-Proofa Vest - Mission 12, Phase 4:
After yov've blown up the turrets and boarded the helicopter fly, to the
top right corner of the screen. The vest is hidden in the fat snowman.

Rank - Mission 16, Phase 2:
Top left corner of the screen. It isn't hidden and it looks like a sign
for a general (four stars).

Troopa - Mission 20, Phase 1:
This is a big yellow S in the middle of the screen on quite an easy
level. It's still worth getting since it improves your rank until you die
and it gives you a Bullet-Proofa Vest, Missile and Rank Boostas for the
phase. Watch out when you pick it up though, because there is a spike
nearby.

Troopa - Mission 22, Phase 2:
It's in the bottom right corner of the screen and is guarded by a turret.
It's best to blow up the helicopter with grenades to start with, then
rocket the turret before getting the Troopa Boosta.

@{B}Cannon Fodder 2@{ub}

Go to the save game option, then the game requests a name type "JOOLS".
Cheat mode active will flash at the bottom of the screen and the ranks

@{b}Capital Punishment@{ub}

To access your character's special move press <FIRE> 3 times followed by a
direction. The moves vary for each character of course though so you'll
have to experiment with it. Try <FIRE>, <FIRE>, <FIRE> and down for Corben
Wedge's crushing body roll move for example.

@{b}Fears@{ub}

Level Code description:
The levelcode contains info about number of left lives, weapontype,
ammunition number.

The 8 digit sequence is a union of two 4 digit numbers:
The first one codes the level, the number of lives and the type of weapons
available, and the second one the number of the two ammo types.

Example:
 LevelCode F8F856A5
	   \__/\__/
	     \	 \__ means 99 weapon of type 1 and 28 of type 2
	      \_____ means access to level 2 with gun and 0 lives left

Part two of the code means:
get weapon type 1 (gun and machinegun) in binary mode (99) : 1100011
get weapon type 2 (Rockets)	       in binary mode (28) : 0011100
Put them together : first comes 01, then first number of type 2, then first
number of type 1, then second number of type 2 ... (always take 7 bit
numbers) and you will get 01 -- 01 01 10 10 10 01 01 - This in hexadecimal
56A5 (see above).

Thats why the most useful code (99 and 99) is BC0F (here is the first 10
instead of only 01!!!)

Part one of the code means:
Here are coded the level number, the type of weapons and the number of
lives.
 F8F8 into binary: 1111 1000 1111 1000 with the meaning

 xxxx 100x x11x xxxx
 \__/ \____/  \__/|\_  if 1 you have the machinegun (0 else)
   \	\	\  \__ if 1 you have the rocket launcher (0 else)
    \	 \	 \____ in this triplet is coded the level :
     \	  \		     111 = level 1   110 = level 2   101 = level 3
      \    \		     100 = level 4   011 = level 5
       \    \_________ this is a sort of checksum if the code is valid
	\_____________ in these bits is coded the number of lives you have:
		       1111 = 0 lives, 1110 = 1 life, ..., 0110 = 9 lives

Checksum: Set the two x so, that the first 8 numbers added are even and
the second 8 also, or the first 8 are odd and the second 8 also.
I hope this is right!

In level and live coding you must switch 1 and 0 to get the real number:
1111 are 0 lives : 0 binary is 0000 | 111 is level 1 : 1(-1) is 000
1101 are 2 lives : 2 binary is 0010 | 100 is level 4 : 4(-1) is 011

The complete codes to start a level with all ammo, all weapons, 9 lives are:

Level	1 6D7FBC0F
	2 6DFBBC0F
	3 6C77BC0F
	4 6CF3BC0F
	5 6F6FBC0F

@{B}Kick Off@{ub}

As the computer or a friend is getting ready to take a shot, just hold down
<FIRE> and the result will either be your keeper saving the ball or
knocking it over the net.

When the oppostion take a penalty against you, press <P> to pause
immediately after the ball is kicked. Now hold the joystick in the
direction the ball is travelling. Unpause, and your keeper should be a
hero.

@{b}Kick Off 2@{ub}

If your opponents goalie is too good for you, run your finger along the
function keys (from <F1> to <F10>), and "S12" or "S14" should appear in
the top right hand corner of the screen. You should now be able to
substitute one of your players for your opponents goalie. This sub. goalie
is usually pretty useless.
Substitute the opposing goalkeeper twice and he will not save your shots.

Keep pressing <R> when you take a penalty. This will show you where the
player's going to kick the ball.

Switch on autofire, or repeatedly press <FIRE> and the result will be that
your keeper will save the ball every time.

@{fg shine} Games reviews and what there score means@{fg text}

 Games are reviewed mostly on playability and how long they will last
you, although some big games with fancy graphics might be expected to
get good reviews it is not always the case. A small 10k game might
get a better overall score than a 1Mb game. It is not that the 1Mb
game isn't any good it's just that the playablility might be non
exsistant and there is no point in downloading a huge file if it
will last a couple of minutes and you will only run it to show off

    be a good idea to look this up beforehand.

REVIEW

    BACKGROUND

    Ever since switching from my 200Mhz Pentium powered Windoze NT PC
    to my Amiga for internet usage, I've been searching for a good
    newsreader to keep me from regretting the switch.

    I had been using Outlook Express on the PC, and was looking for
    something that could at least equal it on the Amiga.  I was in for a
    big disappointment.  I searched the internet and downloaded all of
    Amiga newsreaders I could find that had available demos, but I
    couldn't find one that was stable, easy to use, and able to
    compete with Outlook Express in terms of features.

    When I first heard about NewsRog and checked out the available
    web page with screenshots and a features list, I decided to put
    my last bit of Amiga newsreader faith into it, and eagerly
    awaited its arrival.  When it came, I ordered it online
    immediately, before the demo was even available.

    I was not disappointed.  And now, my first Amiga product review:

    CONFIGURATION

    Configuration can be a bit complicated because there are so many
    features and options.  It doesn't take long to get a minimal working
    setup, however.  Just enter in your news server name type in the
    name or names of some groups you want to read into the "News Groups"
    window.

    The initial configuration is aided by a tutorial in the HTML
    documentation called, aptly enough, "Initial Configuration."

    Beyond the simple minimum configuration, the configuration options
    for the advanced user are numerous.  Just about everything can
    be configured.

    A big part of this configurability comes from the modular design of
    NewsRog.  Can you say plugins?

    27 plugins come with NewsRog and can be turned on or off and
    configured while running, individually for each newsgroup!
    They are responsible for everything from UUDecoding and un-MIME-ing
    binaries to hiding headers and signatures to changing the
    way the text is displayed.  This makes all of these features
    upgradeable and replaceable.  I can't wait for more plugins to arrive,
    and more should follow from users once the developer's toolkit is
    finished.

    These plugins, as well as filters, can be turned on or off and
    configured individually for each newgroup, or can be set globally.

    LAYOUT:

    NewsRog's layout is based on several separate windows to control the
    program, and separate windows for each open newsgroup.

    The main window, the "Launcher" features some nicely done pictures
    for buttons to open the other windows - "Groups," "Servers,"
    "Network," "Posts," "Multimedia," and "Config," described below.

    Each window can be opened independently from the Launcher buttons
    or by menu.

    Groups: this window is the main controller for subscribing to and
    maintaining newsgroups.  Each newsgroup can be attached to
    separate severs.  This and other options are controlled from this
    starting point.  A simple display tells you if NewsRog is in online
    or offline mode, but a toggle button to change this would be nice.

    Servers: this window is where you enter and maintain the NNTP servers
    you use.  It displays a lot of interesting information, including
    the name, # of successful connects, # of failed connects, connect
    success percentage, and whether posting is allowed.

    Network: from here you can control and get information on NewsRog's
    open network connections.  It even displays the speed of the
    connection, and you can disconnect from any of them at any time.

    Posts: this is the posting queue, from where you write and edit your
    posts.  Writing posts requires an external editor, which you
    specify.  Saving the text in the editor brings the text into the
    displayed post in the posting queue.  You can open a file requester
    to attach a signature file, but no fancy signature options are
    currently supported.

    Multimedia: this window controls the handling of different file types
    and their associated actions.  Files can be recognized by a bunch
    of different methods, but this section is probably the most
    confusing for the beginning user.  A large selection of types
    built in would be a plus.

    Config: this is the main base of control for many major configuration
    options, including such essentials as the user's name and email
    address for posting.  This is also where global filters and plugins
    are controlled.  I won't go into all of the options in this review.

    SO, HOW DOES IT WORK?

    The answer: it works great!

    I haven't had the time nor the need to try out a lot of the 
    features, but I'm already very happy with what I do need and use.

    It reads both on and offline, allowing the caching of articles, so
    I can download my favorite groups at night and read them later.

    One of my first stops in Usenet land was
    alt.binaries.pictures.fractals, where I could test how NewsRog handled
    binaries.  In order to see the downloaded pictures (in-line!!!) I first
    had to turn on the UUDecode plugin for the group, then I started
    downloading pictures.  They displayed beautifully (in-line!!!), and
    above every picture appears a control box displaying some information
    and providing buttons to save the file to RAM: or save to another
    directory.

    Non-binary groups are great with NewsRog as well, especially the
    filtering and kill options which are much more powerful than
    Outlook Express.

    It's a lot faster to read and follow Usenet conversations with
    article prefetching.  You can set the number of articles to prefetch
    for each group you subscribe to.

    Multithreading!  This is what really kills Outlook Express.  I can
    read multiple groups at the same time.  I can read articles while
    other articles are downloading, or even while the headers are still
    downloading.  I can begin to subscribe to groups while they are 
    still downloading from the server.  No waiting, ever!

    At any time, I can abort any specific downloads.  No more sitting there
    waiting if I accidentally start loading headers from a group or
    start reading a huge binary post.

    With multithreading and easy aborting, I'm in control.  This is what
    it should feel like to use an Amiga, something that several other
    Amiga newsreaders could learn from.

    Full AREXX support is coming soon, the documentation says, and a
    developers toolkit.  These things will make it the ultimate
    newsreader for Amiga power users.  Catalogues in many languages
    and integrated email support are also promised.

    NewsRog does want a better than average system to be put to best 
    use, which is no problem with me.

    So, download the demo and give it a try.  If you're looking for a
    good newsreader for your Amiga, NewsRog could be just right for
    you as well.

DOCUMENTATION

    NewsRog shipped with only a simple features list and instructions to
    start the installation as printed documentation.  The rest of the
    documentation is in HTML format and is installed during the
    installation process.

    The HTML documentation is very extensive, while at the same time
    being easy to use for beginners.  It even covers what Usenet is,
    giving a brief history and a brief lecture on posting etiquette.
    A web link is provided to a Usenet FAQ.

    Interspersed within the documentation are screenshots detailing
    the topics discussed.

    A series of 14 tutorials is provided to walk the user through the
    program.  A reference section provides details on all of the
    program's features.

    Just about every button, gadget, etc. is enhanced by MUI online help
    bubbles, giving brief descriptions of what everything does.  I've
    found this very useful when trying to figure out what all of the
    various buttons are for.

    The demo of NewsRog comes with the full HTML documentation, so
    download it and check it out yourself.

LIKES

    Multithreaded!  Multithreaded!  Multithreaded!

    Abortable networking, plugins, article prefetch, great documentation,
    ease of use, configurability, etc.  I could go on, but it's easier
    to just have you download the demo and try it yourself.  I won't
    quote the feature list for you, but it is impressive.

DISLIKES AND SUGGESTIONS

    I'd like to see a button on the "Groups" window to switch
    NewsRog back and forth between online and offline modes instead
    of having to use the menu.

    The functions available through the toolbar buttons in the various
    windows should also be available from the menus, at least the major
    ones.  It's a lot easier to scan through a list of text menu options
    than slowly moving the mouse pointer over the buttons, waiting for
    the MUI help bubbles to pop up.

    Optional NewIcons icons would be nice, as the provided MagicWB icons
    show up completely scrambled on my display.

    It would be nice to be able to change the options for a subscribed
    group without having to open up the group, causing the loading of
    cached headers.

    I would like the "Save As" for UUDecoded and un-MIME-d binaries to
    remember the directory you're using rather than defaulting to RAM:
    every time.

    The signature support could be expanded.  It would be nice to be
    able to specify separate signatures for posting to different groups
    or hierarchies of groups.  Built-in random signature support could
    be added as well.

COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

    I've tried just about every Amiga newsreader I could find 
    (admittedly betas and demos for some), and NewsRog tops them all.

    Thor would seem to be the only one that could possibly compete on
    features, but Thor was so complicated I never did get it fully
    working.  NewsRog is easy to set up and use.

    So far, NewsRog has never crashed like many other Amiga newsreaders
    I've tried.  It is very stable and professionally done.

    I've never had to wait long periods or disconnect from the internet
    in order to stop NewsRog from downloading something, like I have 
    with some other newsreaders.  Every download in NewsRog is abortable.

    NewsRog just seems the most professional overall, from the layout to
    the features to the documentation.

    On other platforms, I've found NewsRog more useable and powerful than
    both Netscape's newsreader and Microsoft's Outlook Express.  It's
    also a lot more stable.

BUGS

    The major bug I encountered arose from special circumstances.  The
    first 12 copies of NewsRog shipped apparently had duplication
    errors on the first disk.  My serial number indicates that I got
    copy number 2!

    Before I even received NewsRog in the mail, an email from Questar
    Productions told me I was sent one of the first 12 copies,
    informed me of the problem, and provided a fix to the disk.

    There's a "Known Bugs" section in the HTML documentation, with a
    pledge that these bugs are being worked on.

VENDOR SUPPORT

    My only contact with the vender so far has been emails providing
    bug fixes.  The first such email I received detailed the problem
    with the first 12 copies of NewsRog.  Questar, the distributor,
    had contacted me and provided a solution to the problem, and
    this was before I had even received NewsRog in the mail and could
    send in my registration card.

    I received another email from Questar this morning, providing
    a replacement file for another fixed bug.  

    This is a lot better support than I'm used to from dealing with
    some Amiga companies.  There are great ones and very bad ones.
    From my experience so far, ShadowWorks Software and Questar
    Productions appear to be on the great side.  I expect nothing
    but rapid responses to any technical support I need as well as
    continued updates and bug fixes.

WARRANTY

    NewsRog does not come with any kind of warranty.

CONCLUSIONS

    NewsRog is the best newsreader I've ever used, on any platform.  It
    still needs some work, as evidenced by the "Future Plans" section of
    the HTML documentation - things like full AREXX support, integrated
    email support, and a PowerPC native version if the demand exists.

    Because it's still a work in progress, although great already, I'll
    give it 8 points out of 10.

    My final impression is that I'm glad I spent the money for
    NewsRog, and will continue to pay for upgrades and newer versions
    in the future.

@{fg shine} MUI interface archiver@{fg text}

 File compression is something almost all modern computers have to deal 
with. All a file compressor does is take a file, or a number of files - 
and compact it down into one, archived, file. Which is great. If you have 
all the right software to decompress them again.  If you have the right 
files sitting in your C directory, then you know it can be a  bind typing
into shell all the parameters and device information to get it to work. 

 So, Archiver, enter stage left. Archiver is an imaginatively named 
program which sits in front of all those little archiving programs on 
your Miggy. It uses MUI to build its interface, which at least means it 
looks nice. It comes pre-configured for most archivers, LHA, LZX, Zip, 
Tar and Arj. If the settings are incorrect it is a quick job of nipping 
into the configuration menu and selecting the correct file to use.

 To actually squash or un-squash something, you need to select the file 
name, and the output directory (which usefully has a little button next 
to it to automatically select the RAM disk). Then there are a few tick 
boxes to select, depending on the archiver type you are using, to choose 
for example whether you are going to archive or un-archive something. 
Then, click on a pleasantly big button called "Execute" and wait for your 
file to be unarchived. 

 The program has a few other useful options, for example, you can mount 
the RAD disk by a pull down menu, which is very useful for dealing with 
DMS files.

 This is a very polished program. The Amigaguide file is in German, but 
really, the program is so simple and intuitive to use it is not really a 
problem. The program has been released as shareware, with a registration 
fee of 10 DM, which is a fair price to ask (to remove those nag-requesters) 
but perhaps not worth the hassle of sorting out the currency problem.

 If you are still messing around with the CLI or can't work out how to 
configure DOpus to do it all for you, then I recommend you get hold of 
this great program now.

@node "ur3" "Choice Bar"

@{fg shine} Choice Bar@{fg text}

 Choice Bar is a program launcher. It launches programs. There are 
literally hundreds of these about on the Amiga, and their task is to sit 
on the Workbench, with a pre-defined list of buttons - which launch your 
favourite programs. 

 To install Choice Bar, the executable either needs to be run from your 
user-startup or from the WBStartup drawer. Then when you start your Amiga 
the program will place a little window on your desktop. That is, providing 
you have the configuration file in your "S" drawer. Before Choice Bar will 
run, it requires the user to create a little text file for the program to 
use. This is simply a list of the programs you want displayed in the 
Choice Bar menu, and the file paths so the program can find them. Another
feature of Choice Bar is its ability to have multiple button banks, which 
are called in the configuration file. For example, you could have a button 
bank called "Prefs" - where you could keep buttons for your most used 
Prefs progams, and another bank called "Internet" where you have set up 
buttons to launch Miami and IBrowse. You then scroll through each button 
bank by pressing the "Next Bank" button at the bottom of the window.

 Choice Bar works well enough. It does what it is designed for and does 
it well. However, it does not offer enough to set it apart from an already 
crowded crowd. There are certainly better program launches around if you
are prepared to experiment and hunt. The configuration file, although 
simple and elegant enough to use, could be simplified by a built in 
configuration program, and a drag and drop interface would be a major 
improvement. I do like this program, however. It all worked first time 
and the docs were well written but a program like this is designed to 
be left out on your workbench and it could do with a bit of "prettying up" 
if you want it to fit in with your nice NewIcons and 256 colour backdrop.
Then again, if you are pressed for memory, this could be just what you 
are looking for.

 Would-be Blitz programmers may be interested to know that full source 
code is supplied in the archive, so you mess around with it and maybe 
learn something too!

@{fg shine} mpeGUI - MPega GUI@{fg text}

 By now many of you should know what mpeg is and the benifits it gives
to the Amiga and other less well known computers like the PC and maybe
even the Mac but i'm not to sure about that. Anyway mpeGUI is a small
gui for the great amiga mpeg player, mpega, written by Ridwan Hughes
in arexx it takes all the options of mpega but puts them into a button
formation.

 The main problem with mpega is that it comes with no built in gui, thats
what mpeGUI aims to fix. It does the job quite well but as it is made in
arexx the look of it is not to hot and the way the buttons update are
not the best looking thing in the world. Apart from the look of the
program it gets the job done and it does it well, it gives you all the
options of what song you want, 22mhz or 44mhz and all the other options
of mpega.

 Although mpeGUI doesn't look all that good if your not bothered about
the way things look then this program is definatly worth checking out
and saving on some time insted of having to type command lines into
mpega all the time.

@{fg shine} Utils reviews and what there score means@{fg text}

 Utils are not marked on how good they are compared to other utils,
they are marked by usefulness and what purpose they serve. As there
are so many different utils that do so many different things it is
hard to review something like MUI and then when reviewing a program
like a WB clock say it wasn't up to the standard of MUI. This is why
it is not possible to have a Top Ten list for utils.

@{fg shine} What happend to the Amiga games market?@{fg text}

 Many, many years ago the Amiga games market was the biggest around,
thriving with many games to suit anyones needs and pleasures. Platform
games, adventures, racing, whatever genre of game you liked you'd be
sure to find it somewhere and if not it wouldn't be two long until a
game of that type was released. 

 Then 1994 happend and the fall of Commodore brought games releases
slowing down, less games being released and more being cancelled. Many
big companys left the Amiga and moved onto the PC and the new generation
of consoles. Consoles had always been around at the time of the Amiga
but there are different markets, one for console gamers and one for
people who own computers but play games and you'd be sure anything that
was released on the Amiga would come out on the consoles of that day
or visa versa. Commodore in the end gave way and then all the major games
companys made one last game for the Amiga with poor standard and then
left. Games went, we where left with no games except one, Valhalla. One
game that had a big impression on the dieing Amiga games market in the
failing year of 1994. 1994-95 could be possibly some of the worst Amiga
games years ever on record with probably only one games company in
existence, that being the newly formed Vulcan. As the months went on 
smaller games companys started to appear giving us a small but steady 
games trickle to play with, say one game a month. Games only magazines 
just collapsed and became 15 page efforts for £5 which noone was prepared
to pay.

 Now we come to today, nearing the end of summer 1998, or in the case
of England we never got summer with the awful weather we've been having!
The games market is steady and has been looking more cheerful than over
the past few years with games like Quake, Myst, Genetic Species and
other games from Vulcan and clickBOOM. Aswell as these games we have been
seeing many other games from unknown games companys which just shout
out one man job done in a bedroom. The point I am trying to make is
the quality of games today is just getting worse with only a few major
releases bringing us any quality. Myst, Quake, Genetic Species, Foundation
and some other games have brought joy to the Amiga gamer but there is
a serious problem with smaller games. Today games that wouldn't have even
been consider of pd or shareware quality in the boom year of 1992 are
being released as commercial releases. Ok, many of these companys will
complain that if there where no releases what would we do and there would
be no market at all if it wasn't for them but the fact is users don't
want to be buying rubbish just because it is the only thing available.
If you picked up one of the two leading printed Amiga magazines and found
there wasn't anything in it that interested you then you wouldn't
just buy it because there was no other magazine available so why should
we put up with it in the gaming world?

@{fg shine} CU Amiga closure comments@{fg text}

 If you don't already know the CU Amiga will stop after the October
issue is released. For more information on the closure read the news
section or visit the Cu Amiga web page at www.cu-amiga.co.uk

 In this short article I would just like to give my views and comment
on the closure of the Cu Amiga. The Cu Amiga has been around for many
years doing head to head battle with the Amiga Format for top position
in the Amiga world, then most magazines went bust or closed down and
it was left for the two major Amiga printed magazines to battle it out
and now it seems Amiga Format won, it is a sad loss to the Amiga 
community on a whole leaving only one printed magazine being widely
available. The closure of Cu Amiga could maybe be a good thing leaving
one magazine to cash in on nearly every amiga user making Amiga Formats
sales rise and more chance of it surviving longer but now we have no
choice as to what magazine to buy, it is Amiga Format or nothing. Both
magazines have there strong points but to get an overall view and the
best magazine the thing to do was buy both each month, maybe it is
just me dreaming but a good idea would be for Future Publishing (Owners
of Amiga Format) to employ some of the main Cu Amiga staff and have the
worlds best Amiga magazine with views of all the experts... or maybe
not.

 Cu Amiga has been a great magazine over the 10+ years it has been running
and it will be grately missed by everyone, lets hope the Amiga Format
can stick it out and we wish all the Cu Amiga staff good luck in whatever
direction there jobs take them.

 For next months issue send in your comments about the closure of the
Cu Amiga for the letters hot topic!

@{fg shine} Irc Conference with Holger Kruse@{fg text}

 Here is a log of the IRC conference held with Holger Kruse on the
30th May 1998 about the new Miami Deluxe.

      «Log» | Log started on Saturday 30-May-98 at 15:09:32.
        hkr | com: this summer probably. cost: I don't know yet, sorry. 
              GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to Cacique.
    Cacique | Has AInc hired you to do their TCP/IP work? And any other 
              stuff... GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from Cacique.
       Jkay | the queue is RMerlin, TA, Darklite, Lorus, dave
        hkr | cac: no. AFAIK TCP/IP details for OS 4/5 are not yet 
              decided. GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to RMerlin.
    RMerlin | There's been mentions of a ClassAct GUI for Miami 3.0...  
              Anything happening there? GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from RMerlin.
        hkr | rmerlin: Planned after the next major release (new Miami 
              and Miami Deluxe). Not a big priority though.
       Jkay | Holger: Caldi is right behind you ;)
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to TA.
         TA | Holger:Lots of people are worried about others getting 
              into their computers on the net. Will you put in the Miami 
              docs a good filtering example to prevent that (and update 
              as you see fit)? GA
        hkr | The main reason for the multi-GUI-stuff were "MUI haters", 
              and those users are usually quite happy with GTLayout :)
       Jkay | the queue is Darklite, Lorus, dave
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from TA.
        hkr | TA: The current example filter is quite sufficient. Problems 
              only occur if people install servers incorrectly or get 
              programs with backdoors. GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to Darklite.
   Darklite | hkr: will future versions of Miami support cable internet-
              connections ? (I don't know much about this... so this may 
              be a dumb question :) GA
       Jkay | TA: *   $    *.*.*.*  N Y :)
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from Darklite.
       Jkay | Darklite: I HAVE Miami on my cable as you see me now
        hkr | dark: Is already supported by Miami 3.0. Miami Deluxe will 
              also support cable modems with separate analog-modem 
              uplink. GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to Lorus.
      Lorus | When an internet application crashes (suspended), Miami 
              won't quit. Any ways around that so I don't have to reboot? 
              (sorry, other question got answered heh) GA
       Jkay | the queue is Lorus, dave, harv
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from Lorus.
        hkr | lorus: sorry, not safely possible. AmigaOS does not have 
              resource tracking. GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to Dave.
       Dave | are you working on any other 'big' (or even small :) programs?
 «Nickname» | caldi is now known as IA98.
       Dave | over
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from Dave.
        hkr | dave: sort-of... I cannot tell more :) GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to Harv.
       Jkay | the queue is harv, mrpop
 «Nickname» | anc is now known as petro.
       Harv | Please name any programs which you absolutey positively 
              know for a fact have back doors. GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from Harv.
   Mitchman | Miami :-)
   «Action» | Mitchman runs and hides
        hkr | harv: The DC AmIRC keyfile maker. And one ARexx example 
              IRC script. GA
       Jkay | please /msg me with a question mark if you would like to
              ask Holger Kruse, Author of ReOrg, ppp.device, AmiXwin, and 
              Miami a question!
 «Nickname» | petro is now known as Bill.
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to MrPOP.
        hkr | Mitch: Miami does not have, never has had, and never will 
              have backdoors. GA
   Mitchman | MrPOP?
   Mitchman | (That was a joke, Kruse)
       Jkay | the queue is mrpop, Comunion
      MrPOP | when the new machine comes out will you write a pc miami 
              so as to make the old and new work together without messing 
              with win95 stuff ?
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from MrPOP.
        hkr | mrpop: I don't know yet. Those OS 4.x specs are still too 
              fuzzy to make detailed plans. GA
       Jkay | the queue is Comunion, Arvid
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to Comunion.
   Comunion | oops 
   Comunion | Take me off
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from Comunion.
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to Arvid.
       Jkay | the queue is Arvid, frotz
      Arvid | Holger: I understand you have a GoldenGate II bridgecard.  
              What are you woriing on for that ?
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from Arvid.
        hkr | arvid: a Miami MNI driver for NE2000 ISA boards. Sort-of 
              like gg_ne2000.device, but faster (about 780 kB/s) and 
              supports Plug'n'Play. (Already working).GA

      frotz | When will a Classact interface for Miami be available, and 
              what progress is there on having ethernet and dialup 
              simultaneously available in miami?
       Jkay | the queue is frotz, Harv, Comunion
      frotz | GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from frotz.
        hkr | frotz: CA: probably after the next Miami release. Not a 
              high priority for me. either/dialup: Will be in Miami Deluxe, 
              this summer.
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to Harv.
       Harv | Since Oregon Research (and thus TTCP) are now kaput, will 
              you offer any discount incentive for TTCP owners to switch 
              and register Miami? GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from Harv.
   Mitchman | please do, TTCP is a support nightmare
   Mitchman | buggy
       Jkay | the queue is Comunion, Lorus, Frotz
        hkr | Harv: possibly for a limited time. I have thought about 
              this... No promises yet though.GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to Comunion.
   Comunion | hk, what New TCP/IP  Internet  Protocols do you plan to 
              Implemt into Miami Deluxe ? GA 
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from Comunion.
       Jkay | please /msg me with a question mark if you would like to 
              ask Holger Kruse, Author of ReOrg, ppp.device, AmiXwin, and 
              Miami a question!
        hkr | com: at some time: IP masquerading, extensions to PPP, 
              IPv6, some other things. I don't have time frames on most 
              of this yet though. GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to Lorus.
      Lorus | Oh, you wrote Rerog? where have I been. any new 
              developments? GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from Lorus.
       Jkay | the queue is  Frotz, AIOed
        hkr | lorus: No. Any new ReOrg version would require a *very* 
              major rewrite. I don't have time for that at the moment. GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to frotz.
      frotz | What will Miami Deluxe offer, and why is it so far behind 
              schedule? BTW, the GTLayout gui you offer is hideous, 
              can't you do better? GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from frotz.
       Jkay | the queue is  AIOed ... no one else has a specific question 
              for Holger?
        hkr | frotz: MD: the PPC release and some private issues delayed 
              MD for a while... GTL: The library just does not offer all 
              that meany formatting options, and h/vboxes are somewhat 
              buggy. GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to AIOed.
     AIOed | Do you have some news or release text you can dcc me for 
              AIO diskmag? GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from AIOed.
       Jkay | the queue is  AIOed, Mitchman, Comunion
        hkr | frotz: MD features: primarily multi-interface. Possibly IP 
              masquerading. Probably dial-on-demand.
       Jkay | please /msg me with a question mark if you would like to 
              ask Holger Kruse, Author of ReOrg, ppp.device, AmiXwin, 
              and Miami a question!
        hkr | AIOed: not yet. I'll make an announcement when I have 
              something. GA
   Mitchman | Have you checked out the new SmartFileSystem with journaling 
              and other neat features?
       Jkay | the queue is   Comunion, Lorus
        hkr | mitch: Yes, I have been in contact with the author for a 
              while. Concepts look good IMHO. GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to Comunion.
   Comunion | hk, what is IPv6 ? can you Explain  or is it   too dificult
              in this Channell . GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from Comunion.
       Jkay | the queue is   Lorus
        hkr | com: The Next Generation Internet protocol. 128-bit IP 
              addresses, faster to route, several other changes. Will 
              be deployed on the Internet in a few years. Most new 
              routers support it. GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to Lorus.
      Lorus | ASDL. Does/will Miami support that? Or is that just a new 
              hardware spec? GA
       Jkay | the queue is   Lorus, Illuvatar, AIOed
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from Lorus.
        hkr | lorus: already does. The key protocol for ADSL is DHCP (in 
              Miami 3.0). You also need Ethernet, of course. GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to Illuvatar.
  Illuvatar | Hi there, are you going to update ReOrg at any point to 
              make it more, how shall I put it? - "compatible" ;) GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from Illuvatar.
        hkr | ill: you mean, to make it work with broken drivers/
              patches/... ? :). Probably no updates any time soon. Would 
              be too much work. GA
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman gives voice to AIOed.
     AIOed | Will you be taking questions from DC members :) ? Will 
              there be some release of this irc conference? How much will 
              the new Miami be priced at in UK pounds and is there any 
              release date set?
       Jkay | please /msg me with a question mark if you would like to 
              ask Holger Kruse, Author of ReOrg, ppp.device, AmiXwin, and
              Miami a question!
«Chan Mode» | Mitchman removes voice from AIOed.
       Jkay | AIOed: I have a log.
        hkr | AIOed: a): I guess b): I don't know. c) Miami itself does 
              not change in price. Miami Deluxe: release and price unknown 
              yet. GA
       Jkay | ok! the question queue is empty, Id like to thank the 
              illustrious Holger Kruse for speaking with us!
