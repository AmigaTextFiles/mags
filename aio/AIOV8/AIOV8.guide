@{fg shine} Welcome@{fg text}

 Welcome to the Christmas edition of Amiga Information Online,
firstly I would like to wish you all a Merry Christmas and
hope you have a great time. Secondly I hope you've wrote
your list ;) hehe as there are a few gems floating around
for the Amiga at them moment and no doubt you'll find a few
or probably many Christmas reductions on various bits and
pieces.

 A new year is just round the corner so lets hope '98 can bring
more cheer to the Amiga scene with the release of a new Workbench
and even hopefully a new Amiga by the end of the year.

 Well as always we've got the latest reviews of everything you've
ever wanted and you MUST get hold of but we've also got reviews
of some of the things that aren't that good so you might want to
avoid downloading them!
 
 This issue is the biggest issue yet and thats to celebrate
Christmas, the next big issue of AIO will be in May '98 when AIO
becomes 1 year old :) The articles section is bursting with thousands
of usful articles for you to read including alot of the Vulcan
web site for you without web (WWW) access and some other interesting
articles like the history and the future of the Amiga and the latest
list of new games planned for these last few days of '97 and the
rest of '98, lets hope all of them get published.

 Well once again I say goodbye and I hope you will join us in January
in the new year. Keep all those letters and christmas messages
comming in and i'll enclude them in the next issue.

@{fg shine} Sadeness Software signs new games@{fg text}

Sadeness Software signs Forgotten Forever and Dafel:Bloodline!

Sadeness Software have signed 2 more games to their publishing label, the
first, for those of you who haven't seen it is Forgotten Forever, is a
realtime strategy war game like Dune II or Command & Conquer. Dune II was
released on Amiga and was the best realtime strategy war game ever. Some time
later Command & Conquer was born, but unfortunately it was PC only. At last
we have the answer for Amiga owners.

The Second of their new signings is a superb RPG called Dafel:Bloodline,
Dafel:Blodline (originally known as Child of Darkness), mixes the old Zelda
type game to modern Beat-em-ups with good old RPG characters, speech puzzles
thrown in for good measure. The game runs on any AMIGA with AGA chipset
displaying the graphics in glorious 128 colours. All the characters in the
game are controlled by sophisticated AI routines, so the game will always
play differently, even if you completed it once before.

Not forgetting, Sadeness Software have already signed the fantastic
Foundation and onEscapee, they are certainly going strong in the publishing
industry. onEscapee will be released just in time for Christmas, although
Foundation will not be ready until Jan/Feb 98.

They have said to be 95% of completing the signing of what they said is one
of the most advanced Amiga games they have seen, but will not as yet release
anymore information until things have been finalised.

For anymore information Contact Sadeness at rich@sadeness.demon.co.uk or
check out their website "http://www.sadeness.demon.co.uk" for more info about
their product range.

@node "gr1" "Superballz"

@{fg shine} Superballz@{fg text}

 Superballz is a 'Marble Maddness' sytle game. The idea is to roll
you marble around the screen completing various task like flicking
switch pads and collecting certain objects.

 The game is pretty easy to get the hang of and once you've started
playing you won't want to stop until you have completed that certain
level that you've been trying to complete for ages. There are only
10 levels but it does come with its own level designer so you can
make more challengers for yourself and friends. Although I couldn't
manage to get the editor to work because it just crashed out everytime
I won't comment to much on that but maybe it's because I recived a
faultly version.

 The first level is quite easy, it just envolves flicking a couple of
switches and then rolling up the side of the board to come down round
past the hole and then get to the exit. As you progress though you
find yourself retrying the levels over and over again until you can
complete it. Some of the levels are very crafterly designed and
require some skill to figure out. You can either take the dangerous
choice and just hope you end up at the exit or you can plan out
your route carefully before. The best way is to go slowly otherwise
you find yourself running into spikes or flying off the side of
the board which results in death. There are extra lifes to pick up,
but you have to risk a life to gain another one because they are
placed in places that are hard to get to.

 Overall this game is one of the best P.D. games i've seen in a long
time. Make sure you get it because it will last you for ages without
getting bored, and then theres the insentive to create your own levels
and show the rest of the world your talent by uploading them to something
like the Aminet.

@{fg shine} SWOS '97/'98 Update@{fg text}

 As a long time player of Sensible Soccer I jump at the chance
to buy every latest updated of the game, when buying SWOS '96/'97
I found out that SWOS was no longer accourding to the box but
in actual fact I found out that there bringing out a game on the
PC and Playstation called SWOS2000 with 3D graphics and commentry.
I was really anoyed about this as it was just a way to make
us Amiga users think that they couldn't do any more to the game
but really they just dumped the Amiga, took our money and run!

 Anyway on with the review. SWOS '96/'97 is as you may know looking
a bit dated with all the transfers that have gone on over the period
from Christmas '96 to nearly Christmas '97 so the nice chaps who
made this have updated all the teams they know of and updated the
screens and pitches to say Sensible World Of Soccer '97/'98.

 All the latest signings are done like Ronaldo at Inter, Petit,
Grimandi and all the other thousands of French signings at Arsenal,
Ince, Owen & Riedle at Liverpool and many more people at all
the different clubs.

 This update does not updated every team but the work, effort and
time that has gone into this deservers to be comended.

 Overall this is a great package, one it is free so you don't have
to fork out £9.99 to Sensible software and two Sensible Software
aren't making any more updates. This is easy to install and makes
the game much better!

@node "gr3" "6thSense"

@{fg shine} 6th Sense Investigations Preview@{fg text}

 Back in the days when Amiga topped the charts as the best selling
computer and 10 games where comming out practically everyday there
used to be a few Adventure games like the classics Monkey Island
1&2 and the Indiana Jones series of games by Lucas Arts a division
of the Lucas films company owned by George Lucas.

 I have wanted an adventure game for ages now and there has been
a shortage of them as most companys on the Amiga are producing
high spec games to show off the great capabilitys of the amiga,
and thats the way it should be, but there is still the fact that
most of us would still like to play some adventure games.

 Then 6th Sense came along to save my day :) I have only had a
chance to look at the demo version and it seems to be shaping
up quite well, the graphics are not excellently drawn but they
are cartoony and have a funny atmosfere about them which
should keep you entertained through-out the game. In the demo
you can go around various locations doing different things to
get an idea of what the full game will be like. One of the best
things about 6th Sense is that the music is just sooo good and
on the full CD version they have promissed full speech for each
charictor so I can't wait to see that.

 Although 6th Sense isn't as good as some of the older gems of
adventure era it is a different twist and will keep you happiliy
amused for quite a while.

@{fg shine} Games reviews and what there score means@{fg text}

 Games are reviewed mostly on playability and how long they will last
you, although some big games with fancy graphics might be expected to
get good reviews it is not always the case. A small 10k game might
get a better overall score than a 1Mb game. It is not that the 1Mb
game isn't any good it's just that the playablility might be non
exsistant and there is no point in downloading a huge file if it
will last a couple of minutes and you will only run it to show off
to friends.

 90%+    -  AIO GOLD (amazing)

 70-89%  -  Nice but some let downs

 50-69%  -  Not to good but it'll do

 30-49%  -  Hasn't really been thought out to well

@{fg shine} Fast Virus Killer V1.12@{fg text}

 Last month we reviewed Fast Virus Killer V1.11 and already this
month the author is already back with another version to kill
and rid your HD and disks of those anoying things called viruses.

 Not many updates as this is only a small update but it was worth
a mention to let you know the new version has been released. It
kills all the new viruses like the Happy New Year '97 and '96
and probably there will be a Happy New year '98 so lets hope
the author makes a new version at the beggining of '98 :)

 Overall this is a nice small virus killer and as I said last
month if your pushed for space and need a fast and effective
virus killer it wouldn't harm to get this.

@{fg shine} Advent V1.0@{fg text}

 Well it's that time again and this program is nearly out of use
for another year but its still a pretty nice idea. Of course,
it's an Advent Calender for the Amiga so it saves you having to
buy one.

 Each day when you boot up your computer you will be presented with
the advent calender and that days door will open to reveal the picture.
In the background there is a huge picture of a snowman to make
the whole program nicer. You will need to have a battery backed up
clock in your Amiga otherwise the program will tell you that it
is not December yet.

 A nice little program to get into the spirit of things, although
only useful once a year, but it's still a nice idea. The only problem
is you don't get any chocolates :( hehe!

@{fg shine} Ascii Brick Simulator Pro Turbo Edition V.13@{fg text}

 This is a wierd kind of program, all it does is trys to simulate
a drawing of a brick in what people know as ascii. Ascii is the
drawing of things using charactors from the keyboard, see below
for and example :-

 _______ ____ ____ ______ ______ _______
|   _   |    |    (______)   ___|   _   |
|       |         |      |   \\  |       |
|___|___|__|___|__|______|______|___|___|

 Above that says 'Amiga' although it might not come out very well
in Amigaguide, try looking at it through ppmore or something similar.
Anyway ABS V.13 draws bricks in ascii. It can do all kinds of sizes
of bricks which is nice.

 Although ABS doesn't have any options yet I suppose these are
to come. I'm not going to give this a mark as it doesn't seem to
serve much purpose although it is a good little program.

 If the author is reading it'd be nice to see a clear options,
some way to save your ascii bricks, various colours so you can
have different colour bricks and a clear one brick option. This
would make the program much better and make it of some use.

@{fg shine} SwosTED 3.0@{fg text}

 If you've read the review of the Swos '97/'98 updater in the
games section you'll know that SWOS is one of my favourite
games on any platform. This is a util to help make SWOS just
that little bit better and something that Sensible Software
should have built in themselves but, oh well, they didn't. Luckily
though we have other SWOS enthusiasts that are dedicated to
making your life easier and thats were SwosTED 3.0 steps in.

 SwosTED as you may have guessed by the name is a team editor
for Sensible World Of Soccer, it has been programmed in Amos
Pro 2.0 and seems to work nicely and without any problems at
all. The data is loaded quickly and the teams can be edited
easyly with a few clicks of a button you can make Man Utd
have the worst team like they should have ;) (Ed- Lets see
how many angry Man U supporters that sparks off :) hehe)
and Arsenal with the best speed, finishing and anything. If
you think that a player should be a certain nationality then
just pick the nationality you want and it'll be changed.
Click a few more buttons and you can make Dennis Bergkamp
have brown hair and be a goalkeeper.

 Once you have made all your alterations click on Accept then
pack it into SWOS data format which is built in and save. Now
you can load up Sensi and find yourself as a £15m star striker
for Barcelona. Good eh? Well not only that.... all you have to
do is send the author an email with a few comments and you
get a registration key.

 Overall this is a great little package, although let down by
the fact that there is no WB interface and you have to put
up with the Amos style of interface, it's still great anyhow!

@{fg shine} Yaanchat V1.3b@{fg text}

 Yaanchat is back again with another update in the series of this
great chatting program. This version has all the options it used
to have as well as some new ones and the old ones have been updated
to make them better.

 Yaanchat is a chatter for Maxs 1.54 or Maxs Pro, the author is
the person who programmed maxs pro and NSA-Patch, the util to
speed programs up which I recieved many emails asking about it.

 Yaanchat is now even more configurable that ever before as it
lets you now edit the whole chatting screen to your own BBS style,
where as most chatters you have to stick with the authors style
which also normally includes thousands of adverts for their own
BBS.

 This program IS the best chatter for Maxs BBS software and if
your not using this you don't know what your missing out on,
read the review of the last version of Yaanchat in issue 6 for
all the options and details that were in it.

 Check below for just some of the many options :-

	ø GUI controlled

	ø Configurable true auto-inserts

	ø Internal raw u/l & d/l using Zmodem, Hydra & S-modem!

	ø 4 differant writing modes supported

	ø Trippy cursor(TM)

	ø User time freezing

	ø Coded by the bloke who wrote MAX's BBS Pro & Kewl-Doors

@{fg shine} Magnum Chat V1.1@{fg text}

 You may have seen the review of Magnum Chat v1.0 last month. Well
already back this month is a new version of it. There have been
alot of improvements which is always a nice thing! A quick rundown
of it first though. MCV1.1 is a Maxs BBS door, it's a replacement
for Max chat. It is a spilt screen chatter like most these days.

 This version there is the option to flick around different styles
of chatter, there have also been some more styles added in like
a Gremlins chat style and a Yaan chat style chatter. The ctrl&l
bug has gone if you pressed that in the last version the whole
screen would clear black. Now when you press ctrl and l the bottom
most part of the screen clears right the way up to the top making
I look pretty fancy. I havn't noticed any other bugs either so
all in all it's still one of the best chatters around.

 The speed of Magnum chat has been improved on massivly since
the last version so you don't have to wait for your text to come
up. The only real problem is that sometimes some of your letters
get cut out when both of you are typing, this may be my fault
but if your low on memory and if you only have a slower processor
then excpect that to happen.

 Overall this version of Magnum Chat is well worth the download,
it isn't better than Yaanchat but it isn't worse either. They both
have there own qualitys. My favourite out of the both is probably
Magnum chat because it is alot less buggy than Yaanchat is this
time around. A nice piece of kit that will cheer your christmas
up no doubt!!!

@node "ur7" "Envelope"

@{fg shine} Envelope V1.07@{fg text}

 Envelope is a program dedicated to printing addresses on envelopes,
it has been a pain for me in the past when trying to print directly
onto envelopes using programs such as CED and other various text
editors as everytime I used it I would have to test on a piece
of paper where the address would print out each time. So when I
finnally got it right, I found out that the writting would smudge
on the envelope making it unreadable.

 Envelope came to the rescue, one set up and it can be saved forever
so you don't have to set it up each time, it comes with a nice
interface and loads of options to play around with. It is very
easy to set up and you can be printing on envelopes within 1min
of loading it up.

 There are different styles of fonts and things like italic and
bold that you can use which you change at your own leisure.  Once
you have set up the amount the feed down at how far across you
want the address to be you never have to touch it again and then
you can just print atomatically.

 A top notch program and one well worth downloading!!!

 Utils are not marked on how good they are compared to other utils,
they are marked by usefulness and what purpose they serve. As there
are so many different utils that do so many different things it is
hard to review something like MUI and then when reviewing a program
like a WB clock say it wasn't up to the standard of MUI. This is why
it is not possible to have a Top Ten list for utils.

responsible for taking the poor girls to their death, however you have
another plan in mind.

victims need to face this destiny it is up to you to solve the complex 
puzzles and mysteries of the Labyrinth and eventually destroy the Minotaur 
aswell as locating all the girls that have been imprisoned and getting 
them out safely.

The Final Odyssey combines logic puzzle solving with plenty of action and
strategy, you will be armed with the most sophisticated weaponry and be
thrown into a mind melting logical world of traps, enemies, puzzles and 
mini quests.

The unique dungeon designs create constantly changing levels in gloriously
animated splendour coupled with true 3d sound effects which all help to

The Game:

Since the beginning of the 21st century, Multi and Trans-National
corporations had been gaining power. By the end of the century, global
security, commerce and science were in the hands of a few hundred people.
Industrial complexes and research stations had been established in space
and on the moon, where research would never be impeded by environmental 
or ethical concerns. Due to rife competition and security of research,
all employees of the corporations were implanted with artificial control
mechanisms to ensure complete loyalty. Competing freely, conflicts among 
the corporations frequently sparked local wars, fought anywhere in the 
Solar system, including Earth. As a result the rest of the human race was
held hostage. As the 22nd century began, an underground alliance had been
established among countries which were secretly seeking to undermine
corporate power. This alliance was known as the Counter Force Alliance
(C.F.A.) yet their strength was inadequate in the face of corporate power,
and nothing could be accomplished until something tipped the balance of
power. This happened in 2208.

PRESENT DAY

(C.F.A. Internal Memo)
Apparently the Nepentian Research Labs on the farside of the Magnus Crater
was seized by an unknown force. Observations suggested intense ground
battles within the vicinity of the base, involving at least three
corporations. Two days ago the battles seemed to diminish, yet we have
been unable to identify which corporation came out victorious, if any.
Throughout the day we have tracked military shuttles shipping troops and
cargo from the remaining lunar facility, the Cantex Supply Station. Sources
have informed us that the destination was the Atlas Mining Asteroid
orbiting the moon.

Atlas Mining Asteroid

The Atlas Mining Asteroid is currently being converted into a regular
space fortress armed with high energy space weapons. Whatever purpose this
conversion serves is unknown but we suspect it might become a threat to
Earth. The recent alliance between the remaining military corporations, the
Nepentian Defence Triad and Lantaz Milsec, (to whom the destroyed lunar
bases belonged) suggests knowledge of an impending disaster. Yesterday, 2
out of 3 lunar military bases were vaporised in what looked like accidents 
involving stockpiled nuclear weapons but we suspect they were self-destruct
actions aimed at an unknown enemy aggressor. We desperately need information 
on the current situation!

Begin C.F.A. Transmission

For some years, within the many corporation complexes, we have been planting
prototypes of the 'BioShifter'. This mobile device is capable of taking
control of Humans, Cyborgs and Droids through their electronic implants. We
have just activated of one of the BioShifters within the Cantex Supply
Station, where the bulk of the troops and supplies are being launched into
space.
Lets hope we get the information we need.

Background:

Since the beginning of the 21st century, multi- and transnational
corporations had been gaining power. By the end of the century, global
security, commerce and science were in the hands of a few hundred people.
Industrial complexes and research stations had been established in space
and on the moon, where research would never be impeded by environmental
or ethical concerncs. All employees of the corporations were implanted
with artificial control mechanisms to ensure complete loyalty.

Competing freely, conflicts among the corporations frequently sparked 
local wars, fought anywhere in the solar system, including on Earth.
The rest of the human race was held hostage.

As the 22nd century began, an underground alliance had been established
among countries which secretly were seeking to undermine corporate power.
This alliance was known by the member as the Counter Force Alliance, or
CFA. Yet their strength was inadequate in the face of corporate power,
and nothing could be accomplished until something tipped the balances of
power.

This happened in 2208.
Apparently the Nepentian Research Labs in farside Magnus Crater was seized
by an unknown force. Observations suggested intense ground battles within
the vicinity of the base, involving at least three corporations. Two days 
ago the battles seemed to diminish, yet we have been unable to identify
which corporation came out victorious, if any.

Throughout the day we have tracked military shuttles shipping troops and
cargo from the remaining lunar facility, the Cantex Supply Station. Our
sources have informed us that the destination was the Atlas mining asteroid
orbiting the moon, which is being converted into a regular space fortress
armed with high energy space weapons. Whatever purpose this conversion
serves is unknown but we suspect it might become a threat to Earth. The
recent alliance between the remaining military corporations, the Nepentian 
Defense Triad and Lantaz/MilSec, to whom the destroyed lunar bases belonged,
suggests knowledge of an impending disaster.

Yesterday, two out of three lunar military bases were vaporized in what
looked like accidents involving stockpiled nuclear weapons - we suspect 
they were self-destruct actions aimed at an unknown enemy agressor. The 
electromagnetic pulses disabled all lunar communication satellites and
must have caused havoc in the lunar settlements.

The balances of power are changing rapidly, and we desperately need
information on the current situation. If corporations are going to fight a
low Earth orbit nuclear war the result will be devastating to the Earth
population. In the face of global holocaust we have initiated our
infiltration program.

Begin transmission.

For some years, within corporation complexes, Alliance spies have been
planting prototypes of the BioShifter: A mobile device capable of taking
over control of the controlling implants of humans, cyborgs and droids.

Our first step is the activation of one of the BioShifters within the
Cantex Supply Station, where the bulk of the troops and supplies are being
launched into space. We need information, now.

@{fg shine} THE AMIGA's History and Future@{fg text}

   The Amiga has come a long way since the beginning and has changed
owners several times. Fortunately the Amiga survived and will hopefully
rise to Top position again.

   This document contains the history of the Amiga compiled from what I
have read the last couple of years since I bought my A1200. And remember
this is essential information for any Amiga user.

   As we all surely know the Amiga's life began in 1985. Amiga ( the
company ) developed a groundbreaking machine codenamed, Lorraine. But they
ran into financial trouble and Commodore Business Machines bought their
shares. Lorraine then got more memory and was released as the Commodore
Amiga A1000.
  It was the most amazing machine : 4096 colour, genlockable graphics,
digital sound ( at a time when PCs were mono beepers ) ,a powerful CPU
and a graphics orientated efficient multitasking OS. It sold for $1000+ 
and was selling well because of its wonderful capabilities.

   In 1987-89 the A500 and the A2000 were launched. The A2000 a PC
competitor (lots of slots) and the A500 an Atari competitor.
   The A500 succeeded to beat the Atari and the A2000 were mainly bought
by Graphics artists - it failed to make an impact in the hallowed business
market.

   1990-91 saw the launch of the overdue A3000. Workbench 2, 32-bit,
68030, SCSI, ECS and the ability to use standard SVGA monitors were some
of the exciting new feutures. It was sleek and fast and many Amiga users
rate it as the best Amiga ever made.
   The Video Toaster & Lightwave 3D were also released during this time
and the Amiga would never be the same again. Almost all NTSC TV producers 
adopted the Amiga and the result was professional 3D graphics in TV
productions for 10 times less money and effort than Workstations. ( Just 
check Seaquest DSV, Babylon 5 and Robocop the series ).
   The doomed CDTV ( an A500 in a Hi-Fi box with a CD-ROM ) was also   
launched. Commodore knew CD-ROM was the way forward but couldn't implement
it correctly. The CDTV also did more harm to the Amiga name than good.

  1992... This is were everything really started to go wrong. New management 
proved fatal to the Amiga.  The Original Management pushed 2 systems:

-The A3000+ was basically an AGA A3000 with the inclusion of the AT&T
DSP32. The DSP was very powerful and could emulate a V.42 bis FAX/Data 
Modem through SOFTWARE! It was of such that it would've cost the same as
the original A3000 - even with the AGA and DSP!

-The A1000+ was a super-low-cost 2slot AGA Amiga. The case was like the   
A1000 but without the keyboard space. CPU was going to be either a 28mhz
68020 or a 68EC030. It was going to cost $999 with 2mb or 4mb.

  What happened was that the projects were scrapped by the new management
and the A600 was built - it cost more than the A500 and did less! Then they
tried an ECS A1000+ design but it cost much more than the original AGA 
A1000+ design and was also binned.

Then they took the ECS A1000+ design ( an hacked up A3000 design in a bad
case ) and made the A3200. The A3200 was a very hacked AGA-based A3000 in 
a very bad case. The case was so bad they had to put the CPU on a seperate
card to make it fit. This CPU card wasn't even really reworked for this
design and only worked properly with an 68030. The cost was so high
Commodore plugged in a 68040 which didn't really work properly and
called the machine the A4000. ( Now you know why the A4000 has got slow
memory access ) Even the SCSI-interface was removed and they replaced it
with slow IDE. The engineering team was very frustrated but they tried to
make the best out of it by using 72pin SIMMs and including a better Buster 
for Zorro-III.
  
  1993: The A4000 was released in it's very hacked up form. Many cried
over the missing SCSI-interface and Flicker Fixer.
                                                                              
  The Flicker Fixer was an excellent idea and the exclusion of this also
harmed the Amiga name as most Amigas were now used with low-resolution
flickering 15khz TV Monitors - not even PCs used such a monitor.
  Okay, you could buy a MultiScan but they were ( and still are ) very
scarce and expensive.
  All was not bad though. AGA was better than PC VGA and Workbench 3 was
released. There was also support for VGAs with the DoublePAL mode but 
this only worked in OS-friendly programs and halved the AGA bandwidth.
  The A1200 appeared later. This machine took the A500 idea of cramming
in as much as possible. 68020, AGA, Workbench 3, even the IDE looked like
a good idea! Although the PCMCIA interface didn't prove that useful as it 
was supposed to be. Many Amiga Users see this as the Ultimate Amiga and 
not the A4000.
  Development started on the AAA chipset which promised better graphics
as well as an overdue sound upgrade.
  
  1994: The CD32 was released. Basically it was an CDTV Mark II but
based on the A1200 with the inclusion of the slow Akiko Chunky to Planar
converter. This was supposed to be a console to compete against Sega and 
the likes. Once again it did a lot of harm to the Amiga image. Why did 
Commodore bother? They could've added an CD-ROM to the A1200 or A4000 as 
standard which would've been a much bigger success. They knew they
should've concentrated on the PC and Macintosh market but no, they wanted
to create a useless games machine instead of tackling the serious computer 
market with much bigger benefits.
  Workbench 3.1 was also released with CD-ROM support and as an upgrade
to all Amigas.
  The A4000T got released just before the Commodore liquidation.   
Basically it was the high-end machine the A4000 never was. SCSI, more 
expansion slots, tower case, some DMA problems solved, unfortunately still
no Flicker Fixer.
  Behind the scenes Commodore planned a RISC Amiga. The Hewlett Packard   
PA RISC was their CPU choice as it had good 68000 compatibility. They also
planned a 3D RISC custom chip for the new Amiga, unfortunately the
inevitable happened.
  Commodore US filed for liquidation on 29 April 1994. The rest of the   
Amiga world seemed unaffected and 3rd-party development for the Amiga 
continued although some of the bigger companies pulled out.
  Two months later JAY MINER, one of the designers of the Amiga regardes
as the "Father of the Amiga" passed away on June 20, 1994. A huge loss to 
the Amiga Community.
  
  1995: Escom bought Commodore after a year and relaunched the Amiga on   
30 May 1995.

But beforehand they bought most of the bankrupt High Street stores in   
England - a huge capital investment - that later proved to much for them.
  They re-released the A1200 and A4000T as well as Multiscan monitors
for Amigas. But the Amiga had not been developed for over a year then and 
wasn't that competitive anymore. Although it was still superior to the 
PC ( which haven't even got a decent OS or architecture ( or users ;D ) 
in many ways.
  Apple Macintosh started using the PowerPC RISC processor putting it
way in front of the Amiga in terms of power.

   1996: The first new Amiga prototype got reveiled at CeBIT show.   
  Project Walker looked radically different and got billed the "vacuum   
cleaner". It had a 68EC030 CPU, Standard HDD and 4x CD, 2MB Chip & 4MB FAST
Memory, Better I/O Controller, Workbench 3.2 and a new expansion slot. 
Amiga Tecnologies claimed it will be available by Spring but eventually 
the project got scrapped.
  In July Escom filed for liquidation. The future definately didn't look
too bright. More Amiga developers lost their hope and Newtek ( who 
originally made the Video Toaster ) stopped developing Lightwave 3D for 
the Amiga as it made more profit in the PC market.
  To make matters even worse the PC got a hacked attempt at Multitasking   
in the form of Windows 95 - the competition for the new Amigas was going 
to be fierce.

   1997...(NOW) The future started looking bright again early in the   
year.

Two Amiga compatible PowerPC machines were announced.

-PIOS ONE ,the less compatible of the two, was already in prototype
stages as it was based around standard components. It ran BeOS, a new
multitasking alternative OS from Be Inc.and pOS, an OS from ProDAD.

-The A\Box from Phase 5 was and is still in the development stages but   
it promises a lot. The base of the system is the unique 128bit 
CAIPIRINHA chip.The system has Monitor output as well as Video & Audio 
Inputs and Outputs. The OS is an AmigaOS 3.1 Exec mixed with UNIX for
Multiprocessor, MultiUser etc. support as well as an "Amiga Virtual
Machine" which promises to run original 680x0 Amiga binaries. A truly
amazing machine (just like the original A1000 was ) and they expect it 
to sell for Pentium prices ( with the Video & Audio Inputs included! ).
   The BIG NEWS of 1997 was the acquisition of Amiga Technologies by
GATEWAY 2000, a company with revenue earnings for 1996 exceeding $5 
billion. At last the Amiga has money and power behind it.
   Until now they haven't revealed their plan yet but they are selling
Amiga licenses.
   Licensees so far include:  

- Micronik who released A1200-based systems in a tower with Zorro
slots.  
- Index who designed new AGA-based systems with 30% faster Chip RAM and
in a standard form factor. They will be mainly used in Point-Of-Sale
Systems & Multimedia kiosks.
- DCE who designed two new motherboards: 030,AGA  ( A5000 )
					 060,AGA  ( A6000 )
  Both these has an integrated scan doubler and outputs to standard VGA
monitors!!!
  They also have a video slot and optional MPEG decoder.
- Cloanto who will develop an PC Amiga Emulator - "Amiga Forever".
  Rest assured though - these emulators barely touches A500 speed on an
P200 MMX ( which has 5 times the CPU power of an 060! ).
- As well as numerous other less important licensees.

   What has the FUTURE got in store for us ?
Although the Amiga has survived its ordeal, it had not been developed
for the past couple of years because of the financial diffuculties its
parent companies had suffered. It is not that far behind though. The 
Amiga still has an superior OS and every now and then its custom chips 
delivers a surprise. But we do need a new processor and a more modern
custom chipset to regain market share. That won't be too hard as the PC 
hasn't even got a decent architecture or OS ( or users ;-) ) and the 
Macintosh is heading the same way with their CHRP systems. ( Apparently 
the first revisions can't use IDE devices )
   Therefore the FUTURE of the Amiga is bright. GATEWAY 2000 will 
successfully re-introduce the Amiga as they know a lot about marketing 
( the one thing Commodore lacked ).
   The Amiga will also definately upgrade to the PowerPC RISC as future   
CPU.   
   And we probably wouldn't have to wait that long for new Amigas as the
A\Box might as well become the next Amiga with licensing from GATEWAY 2000.
   I think Amiga International will be looking more into developing the
AmigaOS. Some features the next AmigaOS might include will JAVA, a TCP/IP 
stack and much better devices support as well as advanced RTG Graphics 
and Audio.
   Meanwhile Petro Tyschtschenko announced a Computer - Console - TV -   
Setup Box - Internet acesss - System for Xmas '98 at the Computer '97 
show ( Rumour has it that it will use the ill-fated Walker's case and
will also include a Vacuum cleaner ;-) ) and that AmigaOS 3.5 will 
*hopefully* be released in Spring 1998.
   But the question remains - shouldn't a PowerPC based Amiga be
released then ?  
   This is the only option to remain competive.  
   Are they heading the wrong way again ?  
   Are they over-estimating the Amiga - user's patience ?

   Only time will tell. Remember though that we already survived two 
bankruptcies - so things can only get better. And the Amiga OS is still 
the most powerful, efficient Operating System on any platform.

@{fg shine} SCSI Solution for CyberStorm PPC or MK III@{fg text}

Title: Glacis Computers Offer SCSI Solution for CyberStorm PPC or MK III

Glacis Computers Offer SCSI Solution for CyberStorm PPC or MK III

Hello once again,

I'm sure by now, you have all had a chance to witness the awesome power of
the CyberStorm PPC or MK III.

It came as some surprise to me that there was no active termination of the
wide SCSI Controller on the board. It does make sense if you plan on using
external devices with this controller.

Anybody who has worked extensively with or on SCSI controllers knows that
proper termination is absolutely essential to proper data transfer. This
holds even more so for Ultra-Wide SCSI. Because of the lack of termination on
the SCSI Controller, you now require a SCSI cable with a minimum of 3
connectors, one for the controller, one for the ACTIVE termination and one
for the wide SCSI device.

Due to the lack of availability of terminated wide-narrow adaptors, we
suggest that the following configuration of cables and terminators be used to
reduce the chance of data transfer-loss.

No external devices
 1 --------- 2 -------- 3 ------- 1

Legend:

1= 68 pin SCSI terminator (SCSI68ti) or wide SCSI device with termination set
on.
2= Cyberstorm SCSI controller
3= SCSI devices ( 1 or more ) - not terminated. If device is a narrow (
50-pin ) SCSI device, use the SCSI5068 adaptor offered by Glacis Components.

If the last device is a 50-pin narrow SCSI device, do not set termination on
the device. You must use a 68-pin active terminator.

Use standard 68-pin SCSI cables such as the SCSI68-x

External Devices on chain
   4 -------- 2 ------- 3 -------- 1

Legend:

1= 68 pin SCSI terminator ( SCSI68ti ) or wide SCSI device with termination
set on.
2= Cyberstorm SCSI Controller
3= Internal SCSI devices ( 1 or more ) - not terminated. If device is a
narrow ( 50-pin ) SCSI device, use the SCSI 5068 adaptor.
4= External WIDE SCSI cable to external devices or external wide SCSI
terminator( SCSI68te ). Note: external cable can be going to an external case
housing internal drives. Last device on the chain must be terminated as per
the rules above.

Use the SCSI68e-x cables as listed below.

Confusing? Welcome to the wonderful world of SCSI. Feel free to ask about
your specific SCSI needs.

To help ensure reliable performance from the Cyberstorm SCSI controller, we
are now offering the following products:

Terminators

SCSI68ti - Internal 68 pin active terminator as specified by Phase 5 in their
Cyberstorm MK III and PPC manuals.

This terminator fits onto the 68 pin SCSI cable used by the on-board
ULTRA-WIDE controller and is required if only one wide SCSI device is present
on the chain. Two are required if no WIDE SCSI devices are present.

SCSI68te - External 68 pin active terminator. This terminator is required if
using the SCSI68e-x cables, as described below, and no external devices are
present on the chain.

Cables

All the SCSI68e-x series of cable are 68-pin with a minimum of two
connectors, one being a 68 pin external connector with a slot plate. This
allows you to secure the external connector in any free slot you would
normally secure your Zorro cards.

The slot plate may be removed if you wish to run the cable outside of the
Amiga through an expansion slot or other area where the slot plate is not
required. The other connectors are standard internal 68-pin connectors as
found on the SCSI68-x cables.

The Cyberstorm connects into one of the internal connectors (not an end one.)

The -x refers to the number of devices that can be connected internally.

We currently offer the following configurations;

SCSI68e-1 (76 cm/30")
SCSI68e-2 (107cm/42")
SCSI68e-3 (137cm/54")
SCSI68e-4 (168cm/66")

Others are available upon request.

As well, we are offering an addition to the POWER series of cables;

POWER5plus - Allows you to power an A500 with an A590 from the same PC PSU.

Pricing
PRODUCT          SRP
---------       ----
POWER5plus       30

SCSI68ti         40
SCSI68te         45

@{fg shine} The future of the Amiga@{fg text}

Where ever one looks, it`s in our faces...

"Amiga is alive",
"Amiga is coming back",
"Escom will save us",
"Amiga international will save us",
"Gateway 2000 will save us",
"The Abox will rule!".

The truth is NO commercial company will save the Amiga! I cannot believe
some people`s optimism, the Amiga is dead as a commecial platform. What we
have left is no more than dedicated hobbyists and even they cannot revive
the old Amiga spirit. Everything is just a farce, lazyness took us all.
Instead of using the Amiga`s greatest assets, coders resort to PC style
coding which on an 020, 030, 040 or even an 060 processor leaves the Amiga
lightyears behind. 

But what about the Power PC chip? That`s all very well, but who`s going to
develop for it? Can you really expect billionaire companies who are selling
close on a million copies of their software on the PC to give a new machine
a second thought? The world is run by fat cats who care only about money so
a bit of dedication is just a joke. It all comes down to unrealistic
idealism, striving to make the most powerful machine without consideration
of sales. The idea is staring these developers in the face, instead of
making a Power PC chip for the Amiga it would be so obvious to make an Intel
chip addon. The prices of Intel chips are much better value and besides that
it would give Amiga owners the best of the PC world too, with full PC
compatability. The ideal way to go is not the processor; its the custom
hardware. Look how fast a processor the PC needs to scroll at 25fps, look
at their lousy sprite handling, yet the amiga was developed to do these
tasks. Nowdays the PC and the Playstation have adopted the same theory,
instead of relying on their processors they have specifically created 3d fx
chips in order to increase performance of 3d routines. This is the
direction the Amiga needs to take.

What is the fuss about system friendly software these days? The Amiga is a
far more capable machine than even the original creators suspected, but by
limiting coding to system friendly tasks they are limiting themselves to
the original standards set for them. System software looks ugly, unoriginal
and in most cases is so damn buggy. The PC is becoming a far greater
inspiration than we need. If it wasn`t for the Amiga logo and the amiga 
keys I would think I was using a low spec PC.

So what does the Amiga have in its favour? Well to be accutely to the
point; absoloutely nothing! Everything seen on the Amiga these days is
either low spec PC style s**t or ammateur PD quality stuff. It`s impossible
to log onto a BBS these days and not find stupid little programs like
a workbench tamigotchi or pre releases of workbench replacements.. in most
cases affecting the compatability of software anyway. MUI for example, the
buggy Workbench degrader takes up loads of Hard drive space, eats memory
and does f**k all?! Then, dumbass developers decide that their programs
will only run under MUI.

As for software publishers, well there`s Vulcan.. a team made famous for
their audacity to release a commercial Amos game and then there`s some
shareware publishers. Who really wants to release years of hard work into 
the hands of these people?

The Amiga has no future the way things are going, users are too interested
in trying to keep the pace of the PC and high spec consoles that we have
lost our heritage. Dammit, if we wanted to see this kinda s**t we wouldn`t
have an Amiga surely? Don`t get me wrong I love the Amiga, but only for
its past releases,  I find far more enjoyment watching old demos and playing
old games than I could find in whatever Gateway 2000 or whoever comes next
could possibly offer. Accept the truth, the AMIGA has no future!

@{fg shine} UAE@{fg text}

 I am in an awkward position. I have used an Amiga over the last 7 years
or so for most of my things. Well in the last year or so my Amiga (a
1200) has started to cough and splutter until a few weeks ago it went
positively pear shaped. I'll switch it on, the hard drive makes a rather
feeble sound that I would guess is it trying to spin upto speed, the
little yellow light goes on and off many times, lots of peculiar noises
are emitted and then, after ten minutes of so the grinding noises start.
Soon after that I get a nice screen that says error of block "big
number" so I click cancel. But as soon as I've clicked on the thing
another one comes up and so on. I found myself yearning for the
simplicity of the PC, where in the past I have marveled at its ability  
to lose 17 megs of data and give me the option to recover it in 16k  
chunks which have interesting names like file0128.chk, most of which are  
just garbage anyway.

 Well I'm afraid I can no longer justify any further repair or expansion
to my Amiga. There is simply not enough good software to justify it. My
486 runs Windows 95, Word 7, Excel and Encarta and that is all I really
need. Wordworth is too clunky and unreliable for me at least and the
encyclopedia software I have seen simply did not compare will Encarta
and Comptons for the PC. 20

 Now I think it's a shame that I am having to give up the Amiga because
I learnt computers from it. I know the platform inside and out, (before
this year anyway) and I have lots of little bits of software that
occasionally I would like to use that I just can't get on the PC. For  
instance, Dpaint IV. I have used that for all my limited art needs since
I had the machine, it is very handy and flexible. I have found nothing  
on my PC that matches it for ease of use and the amount of control you
can actually exercise over the pointer. The PC port is not very good,
it's old and clunky. I would like to use Dpaint for graphics on my
web-site when it's finally up and running. But my Amiga has gone senile,
so what can I do?

 The question plagued me for minutes until when I stumbled across the
site for Uae. This is a Amiga emulation based on a core of C code, which
gives a great amount of portability with a trade-off for speed. There
are versions for linux, Mac, Acorn, X-Windows and PC in DOS and Windows  
95/Direct-X flavours. I shall concentrate on the Windows 95/DirectX
version. It provides a almost complete emulation of an 020 based ECS
Amiga complete with FPU. Not only that it emulates a Picasso96
compatible graphics card  to give an overall speed increase in graphics
and processor emulation, cutting out custom chip emulation. AHI is
emulated so you can have direct access to your 16 bit sound-card. You
need about 16 megs of free memory to run it well.

 Installing and configuring is fairly simple although you do need a
fairly good knowledge of the working of the Amiga Workbench so you can
set up the hard disk. I set up version 0.6.9 release 13 although by the
time you read this version 0.7 should have been released. You get to
select your configuration at startup. You can define how much memory
goes to the Amiga (24 megs is the maximum, I think), how you emulate the
sound, graphics, the joystick and serial etc.. There is one key problem
with emulating an Amiga on a PC. That is that PC drives cannot read and
write Amiga Format disks, whether or not they are high density or double
density.  Floppies have to been converted to an ADF file via a real
Amiga using Transdisk a widely available utility that appears in some
releases of the WinUAE archive. There is a hardware solution that can be
found on the internet but this only allows you to read a whole floppy in
one go, creating an ADF file. You can select the floppies images you
want to boot up from, "inserting" them into the virtual drive. WinUAE  
appears to read the floppies straight off the hard disk rather than  
copying them into memory. On Rob Stewart's Packard Bell 233mhz MMX  
Pentium a floppy image works about the same speed as a floppy. 20

To get going you need an image of the Kickstart ROM. These can be  
obtained with ease from the internet or straight from your real Amiga  
using a tool such as Transrom. The ability to choose your ROM version
allows for a great range of compatibility. Games that I have not played  
for ages because they never ran on my A1200 such as North and South and
Pacmania suddenly become playable again.

 But the thing that knocks the spots of it for me is the hard disk
emulation. You have two options, use a hard file, slow clunky and
limited to the size you specify for it, or make the disk a standard
directory on the PC. This stunning feature makes disk access lightning
fast, as fast as your setup allows. Your only space constraints are
those of the PC drive, you can access all the Amiga files from the PC.
You can even use tools such as drivespace to compress your Amiga drive,
completely transparently to the Amiga. I've heard that there are one or
two problems with foreign characters in filenames not supported by the  
VFAT 32 file system, but I've never come across them. Or at least I
think I haven't. I have a strange problem that whenever I try to install
MUI 3.8, Win 95 gets called up and then everything locks up. So maybe it
is a problem.  20

 O.k. all this is fine, but how does the emulation run? Well I haven't
tested it extensively but I have not come across any huge problems in
the emulation. On my Intel 486 50mhz it runs at about 1/4 the speed of
an Amiga 500. On Rob Stewart's machine it runs (according to Aibb 6.5)
at about 2.33 mips which is faster than an out of the box A1200,
although I would have said it's a bit faster than that. This does not
however mean that you get a perfect nippy A500. Sound emulation can get
very choppy on Rob Stewart's machine when set to 44khz stereo, but works
fine when set to 22khz mono, which should be fine for most games anyway.
All Terrain Racing ran very well and that's got all sorts going on in
it. I've been told on the internet that it runs like a A500 on a P100  
and I had it running fast on a P90. 20

The Picasso96 emulation means you can have screens limited only by your
available memory and your graphics card. You can access any PC device by
setting up a hard disk, though as yet I have found no way of setting up
the CD-ROM as a CD-ROM drive so you get the right labels etc.

 One of the big things this opens up is the world of notebooks. You can
get notebooks with practically every Pentium processor available at the
moment. It is a much more attractive option than that hideous A600
notebook kit. You can have loads of memory, a nippy A600 equivalent (on
a fast Pentium) a 24bit display, 16 bit sound and CD-ROM etc. only
dependent on the hardware limitations of the machine you are using.

 Anyway, if you have a fairly nippy PC, UAE offers you a very usable
Amiga that can take advantage of memory, graphics cards, sound cards,

CD-ROM drives and a range of other hardware that would otherwise be very
expensive to fit. I would like to see it be able to take advantage of a
midi interface on the sound card or any bit in synth capabilities such
as the OPL3 chipset which is on most PC sound cards, aswell as wavetable
sounds. Also it would be nice if it could read Amiga disks straight off
the PC drive. I know there are bits of software that can get some types
of floppy drive to read and write a special PC 1.72 meg format as
opposed to the standard 1.44 high density limit. As 1.72 megs can be
stored on an Amiga disk I would guess that it means that the formats  
must use a similar type of encoding. Some top quality Ex-Amiga, now PC,
hacker needs to have a real go at it. However, such an emulation really
is a feat which I would have thought nearly impossible, especially in C.  
The code is very quick, despite what anyone says, although Fellow, it's
only opposition, which I have had limited experience of, is supposed to  
run like the clappers because it is pure assembly code. But it only runs
from on a PC in DOS, lacks the range of good compatibility and Picasso96
emulation and the interface isn't very pretty. 20

So maybe it isn't time to bin your A1200 yet but I think WinUAE is
great. O.k. so you can't play the AGA games on it but it's supposed to
run Gloom in Picasso96 mode and it's free so get it and get all your PC
owning friends to try it now!

I am the process of setting up a site that has all you need to get UAE
going. However in the meantime there is a great site that is definitely
worth visiting whether you are interested in emulating an Amiga or not.  
It is called Lazarus and it is at :-

http://www.erols.com/ccsystems/lazarus/ (I think).

If you have problems with that try www.uae.de for the official UAE
homepage where you can get versions of the software for many platforms.

 Hi all at AIO team!
        I think that Gateway 2000 shoud market the Amiga more and
i would very much like to see advert on televisions to make people
more aware of the Amiga presence. Apart from that I think that
the amiga has a winning formula. how about making some more games.
Thanks for the mag and I really like the interviews, especially
with vulcan software. By the way i will not have internet any more
soon so do you have AIO distributers in Canada?

@{b}Ed-@{ub}Thanks for the letter Heinrik, at the moment we don't have
any distributers for canada but i'll see what I can sort out for you.

@{b}From@{ub} : Galahad of Fairlight

  For what its worth, here is my opinion on Gateway 2000 and Amiga
International.

  Gateway 2000 are a big company, certainly big enough to re-launch the
Amiga in whatever guise.  That is the problem.  No-one really knows what
guise the Amiga is going to take.  Just about every week, another
annoucement goes by telling the world that another licensee of the Amiga
has been signed, and whilst this is good for the OCS/ECS/AGA market of
having more clone manufacturers, the news about the future direction of the
Amiga is somewhat shrouded with mystery and secrecy.  Why both Amiga
International and Gateway 2000 feel the need for 'cloak and dagger' tactics
is beyond me!

  The Amiga has always thrived from the 'bedroom' coder.  Just about anyone
could afford an Amiga, and with a little perseverance, anyone could get the
Amiga to do something.  As the old slogan from Commodore said, 'the only
limit is your imagination.'  Well I think that have gotten out of the 680x0
series of Amiga's as much as they can.  They've driven back the boundaries
by producing games that were supposed to have been impossible on the Amiga
(Doom clones).  I used to be constantly surprised by the abilities of
coders on the Amiga, but that hasn't happened for a long while.

  Many Amiga coders have the ideas and the drive to make things bigger and
more spectacular than that of their PC coding cousins, but can't realise
their full potential because of the lack of an upgrade path with the 680x0
series.  The 68060 is the highest we can get, and that is way short of the
processing power of a modern PC, a PowerPC equipped Macintosh, Playstation
and the SH2 equipped Saturn.

  I don't think many people care anymore WHAT processor the new generation
of Amiga will have, but they might like to know in advance so that they can
get to grips with the processor now.  Quality software drives a Quality
computer, if and when the new Amiga gets released, I think it might be in
better shape with plenty of software available on its release.  Or are the
major software companies going to get the first start on these machines,
and the rest of us that supported the Amiga through thick and thin will be
subjected as 'those that can wait'?

  I think the Amiga is good machine, Gateway 2000, Amiga International and
those that support the Amiga, can make it a GREAT machine again.  We all
want to help make the Amiga #1 again, how about a little help from Gateway
2000 and Amiga International to make that possible?

@{b}From@{ub} : Robert Wheeler

 I think that is now time to face facts. The only way that the Amiga
will have any chance of surviving as a platform depend on people being
ready to buy software for it. No one wants to buy the machine at the  
moment, lets face it, all you get for  A3700 is an Amiga with a 030 that
may be able to run an O.k. but rather clunky WordWorth. You can get a  
166mhz Pentium complete with Windows 95 and Office 97 for around that
price if you look in the right places. The only way the Amiga can
progress is if Gateway 2000 sit down and serious rework the custom
chips. At the moment all I have seen of "new Amigas" is processor and  
graphics upgrades that move away from the custom chips, the very things
that make an Amiga an Amiga. The core of the Amiga operating system is
still better than any other, if a little buggy. It still has the
potential to wipe out the PC. The ever decreasing readership of Amiga  
Format and CU Amiga seems to indicate that less and less people are  
using Amigas and supposedly they are moving to PC. We need to form a
familiarity with the Amiga system with the users of other systems, which
will inevitably create a demand for software to run on it and perhaps a
demand for new machines. Meanwhile the boffins at Gateway 2000 should be
able to come up with something worthwhile. But we need improvements on
existing software and a real killer application such as a word
processor. It wouldn't be hard to make a few improvements to Wordsworth.  
If we show people what could be done on an Amiga, and make it clear that
the emulation is only a emulation is only the equivalent of a budget  
Amiga then maybe we could lure some of the more dumb people who would
usually buy a PC into going for a cheaper Amiga setup. This would create
a demand for software and then some good stuff would start being  
produced, attracting the less dumb people. In the end Amigas could
emerge with a worthy reputation. Possibly............

@{fg shine} We want you!@{fg text}

 Although we think that the staff at AIO are great :) We still
need more people to help out with productions to get more
people envolved and make AIO much better each issue.

 If you think you've got what it takes to stick to deadlines
and meet all the requirements that we need then check out
below on how you could become an Editor at AIO.

 Who we need :

  @{b}Deputy Editor@{ub} - We need a deputy editor to take control of
alot of the Editorial work and write a few articles and other
bits each month, you will not do as much as the editor but this
would require quite a bit of work. Think your up to the job of
being the second most important person at the BEST Amiga diskmag, then
get in touch with an example review.

  @{b}Games Editor@{ub} - Each month we would require 4 or 5 games
reviewed that have either been bought, downloaded from Amiga
sources or obtained in any other legal way. AIO will supply
you with the neccessary games to review if this is required
but your own choice is also excepted. You will need to stick
to deadlines and make sure that you have ALL reviews are ready
by the time the deadline has come.

 @{b}Advert Production Manager@{ub} - Each month AIO needs as much
publicity as possible to insure that as many people as possible
will find out about AIO and what it has to offer. This will
require emailing ALL the AIO registered readers and making
AIO known of in other ways.

 @{b}Public Relations Manager@{ub} - The public relations manager would
be asked to contact any companys and people that would be of interest
to our readers, this would also require doing interviews either via
email or conventional letters. PRManager would also be in charge
of answering any querys readers may have.

 @{b}Researchers@{ub} - AIO needs as many researchers as possible to
find out about latest news, latest products and any other latest
happenings on the Amiga front.

 So if you think you've got the right skill to help AIO out in one
of those positions or in any other way then contact Chris Seward
