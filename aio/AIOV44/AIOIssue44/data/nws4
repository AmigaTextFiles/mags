 Mariusz Wloczysiak, ELBOX COMPUTER posted on  the  Amiga-Mediator  ML:
 "The  recent  information  in  the PowerComputing Website on "delayed"
 production of SharkPPC cards seems to have been an unfortunate mistake
 made  by  the site's Webmaster. We feel obliged to Amiga users to give
 our position in this issue and to clarify the whole situation. Work on
 SharkPPC cards is in the final stage now. We expect the production-run
 cards to be ready for sale in the second half of March 2001."

 We have just learned that the contents of the Power Computing site was
 changed to reflect the actual state of the things. "The first SharkPPC
 G3/G4 cards will be available by the end of March 2001."
