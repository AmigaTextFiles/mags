Many have the times been when someone has tried to once and for all
replace the (in)famous More text viewer. This is in fact an old
attempt to do just that, I remember a long time ago looking at one of
the predecessors to this version, back then I wasn't really impressed
with what I saw. Not too much have changed since those days I'm
afraid, although this is indeed a worthy More replacement and is
pretty usable in plain text files. It has "text" support for
AmigaGuide files, I think that a complete support for this could have
been in order. A rather good idea, which I haven't been able to test,
though, is support for mice with wheels, I'll just assume that this
works. Tons of texts can be opened simultaneously and changed between
using the menu. It has nice drag & drop features as well.

There's quite alot to fiddle around with on the configuration part,
you can change the fonts, icon sets for the toolbar (the toolbar
itself is a plus on the score), change pubscreens, to name but a few
things.

Quite frankly this is an ok text viewer, but it feels like it misses
something. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think text viewers should
be "bloated" (it's not at all slow though! In fact, it's very fast)
with all kinds of more or less unecessary features. However, if you
don't agree with me I suggest you check it out. It has many many more
nice features than I scribbled down above. So if you want to do
something more than just read your textfiles, try it out.
