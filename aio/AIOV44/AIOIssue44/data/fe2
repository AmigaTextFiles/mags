Amiga - So the World May Know

Executive Update - St. Louis and Beyond
{pp}
Greetings to the Amiga Family:
{pp}
In Melbourne this last year, I was able to surprise many of you with
several announcements that were unexpected, and we delivered on each
of those.
{pp}
Now we have a new show coming up in St. Louis.  In a few weeks we
will all learn...
{pp}
Where is the AmigaOne?  Will Cringley finally eat his words about a
new Amiga? What about AmigaDE on PDA's, Set Top Boxes, Internet
Appliances, or even desktops?  Will Tom and Nicole stay together or
is it over? Is there life for the AmigaOS after 3.9?
{pp}
Contrary to the rumors and what many people are saying about our
demise, or that we are going to have the same fate of the others
before us, we have a big surprise for all of them.
{pp}
I look forward to visiting with all of you in St. Louis, and I look
forward to taking over the Hotel, and the surrounding area with the
Amiga Spirit, and Community.
{pp}
I hope to see many of you there.
{pp}
There is still time, and in 6 weeks, it will all be known.
{pp}
Bill McEwen, and the rest of the Amiga Team
