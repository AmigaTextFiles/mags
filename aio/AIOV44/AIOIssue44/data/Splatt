Hello,
{pp}
I was wondering if AIO or readers know much about the different models of
A1200s.  As I have 2 and they both seem to have different downfalls.
One has a wierd AGA chipset, which won't allow me to view dblPAL or modes
like that, that are used for SVGA monitors etc..  And the other has a
serial port that cannot connect above 56Kbps or it will just get constant
errors.  I haven't got the first one with me at the moment, but the other
model is 1.4.D.
{pp}
Just wondering if there was actually a model of the A1200 made, that works
100% :)
{pp}
Also, clock ports seem to differ from model to model.
{pp}
Cyas later, thanks in advance for any help.

Hello Splatt,
{pp}
The A1200 Hardware guide by Chris Appleton says this about A1200 mainboard revisions:
"Two main revisions of the A1200 motherboard were produced, Rev 1D and Rev 2B. They only 
differed in the type of RAM chips used for the Chip RAM. There was quite a shortage of RAM 
chips, and so measures were taken to ensure that production could keep going whatever chips 
were available. One took 8 bit RAM, while the other took 16 bit and production was switched 
depending on what was available."
{pp}
Both boards, with Budgie Rev 01 or 02, can be modified to be "perfect". Strangely, it's the Rev 
1D.4 board that needs the least dramatic modifications, with just a few parts requiring removal, 
while the others need extra pull up resistors and a resisitor change.

As for the DblPal problems, remember you must have a 31khz VGA capable display in order to 
use it. Actually, I've read somewhere that DblPal doesn't actually produce 31khz exactly, but most 
SVGA monitors should be tolerent. Your already aware of this though, so all I can say is I have a 
1D.1 A1200 myself, and it *used* to run DblPal (everything, in fact) fine. But one day it all went 
up in smoke.. an hour of soldering hook up wire in place of vaporised PCB tracks later, I was able 
to get the thing to boot, with crippled Paula, no IDE, and that unnerving smell of burnt 
components.
{pp}
It simply refuses to display DblPal or DblNTSC correctly, even though all my other screen modes 
work fine... perhaps we share a faulty part of the AGA chipset? I'd say there is some discrete 
component somewhere (ie. a line driver, multiplexer, etc. and not one of the AGA chips) that is 
causing the trouble.

The serial port problems are common to anyone that is using the chipset serial port. If the 
problem is limmited to only one of your Amigas, I think you will find it will be the slower of the 
two. The problem is that, when the first Amiga guys were supposed to be designing the ultimate 
games machine in the early 80s, not much thought went into a decent serial port. As a result, it 
has just a single byte buffer between the Amiga and the outside world. This wouldn't matter, if 
you were talking about the baud rates of 9600 and 14400 for which it was designed for, but 
typical 56kbps and most 33.6kbps modems have a maximum DTE (modem-computer) speed of 
115200bps. Note that this is different to your "connection" speed, ie. modem <-> ISP.
{pp}
With just one byte for the buffer on the serial port, the computer must read, store, and clear the 
buffer before any new data comes in. The computer is doing this for every single byte... that 
means, at 115200 bits per second, the buffer must be cleared 14400 (115200/8) times every 
second. That's a lot of work, and it eats a lot of your CPU time, compared to a clone PC's serial 
port. Worse still, if your computer can't keep up with it, or your doing too much with your 
computer (Miami recommends you don't use 256 AGA cols. on a 030 system at high baud rates), 
you will lose data. If this data loss occurs during internet TCP/IP packet transceiving, then the 
packet can be sent again and again until it gets through. If it happens during negotiation with 
your modem however, then the modem will refuse to even dial your ISP.
{pp}
The solution? Clock it back to 57600 or 38400! The amount of CPU time wasted on that serial 
port will be dropped significantly, and you won't lose a lot of internet speed, if you take into 
account the fact your ISP never runs at 100% bandwidth, and phone lines usually restrict your 
connection speed to something less than 56kbps anyway. Or, you could buy a serial port add-on, 
such as an IOBlix, surf squirrel etc. for A1200, or for the big boxes, Zorro 2 boards such as the 
Multiface III or GVP I/O cards. These have much more intelligent UARTs, with bigger buffers, and 
will reduce the load off your CPU so it can do something worthwhile.

As for the clock port headers, it seems that early boards had all the pins for P9B(1-40) whilst the 
majority just have pins 19-40. The reason, according to the A1200 Hardware Guide, is due to 
Commdore's initial indecision as to whether the A1200 should have 2MB chip memory, as it does 
now, or just release it with 1MB, and produce a 1MB piggyback expansion later. Pins 1-40 of 
P9A, near the top of the board, and the first 18 pins of P9B are associated with this purpose, and 
aren't needed for a battery backed real time clock after all. Luckily, we all know it as a clock 
header, not memory expansion. The A1200 Hardware guide also has this to say about the clock 
header:
{pp}
"This header demonstrates Commodore's finest quality control - motherboards were shipped with 
the header on the wrong side of the port, the header twice the size, or no header at all."
