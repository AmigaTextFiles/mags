On the PC there are several types of applications that que files you want to download on HTTP/FTP, as this is a
pretty useful type of applications, naturally it had to come to the Amiga sooner or later. GoFetch! is one of the
recent Amiga "clones" created for this purpose. At first glance it looks very nice and tidy and the installation
is as easy as the clicking of an icon (it even reboots for you when it's done, if you want to, that is).
After spending a few minutes reading the manual I decide to try it out to see if it does what it's supposed to.
Queing files is an easy and quick task, so no problem there. It also have a "profile history" window which is
good to keep track of the download session.

Everything seemed to work pretty well, in fact there's only one annoying thing I found about it, and that's
when you download from FTP servers with a limited number of connections available - the program froze for me
everytime I tried to download from a FTP that had that. Other than that it's hard to try and find faults in
this program. One nice thing I would have like to see though would be some sort of separated download status
bar/screen or something similar... hmm, this is however just something that would have made this great program
even better, so I won't ruin yet another review by being too picky (just this once, hehe).

Despite the minor flaws this is definately a jewel I'll be keeping close at hand.

(note: there's also a public keyfile available on Aminet for GoFetch! Sadly enough this also means that it's no
longer being developed, however, the full sources are also available, so there's still hope for new versions.)
