 The AmigaOne 1200 & 4000 are 6xPCI + 1xAGP  stand-alone  G3/G4  boards
 capable of running the Amiga DE directly. These boards are designed to
 fit in Z4-busboard-compatible  A1200  towers  and  Eyetech/Elbox/Power
 A4000  towers.  However both AmigaOne boards can optionally connect to
 the appropriate Amiga motherboard for access to Classic Amiga  chipset
 hardware.  In  this  mode  -  because it has access to all the Classic
 Amiga custom chips - the AmigaOne 1200/4000 can also be  used  to  run
 the   Classic  Amiga  OS  &  software  with  a  very  high  degree  of
 compatibility.

 It is important to note that the A1200/A4000 'computer' now resides on
 the  AmigaOne  board  -  having  direct  high-speed  access to all the
 AmigaOne's  PCI/AGP  peripherals,  and  only  accessing  the  existing
 A1200/A4000  chipset  (via  the  A1200 edge connector or the A4000 CPU
 connector) as and when required. Any existing 680x0 or PPC accelerator
 is   entirely  redundant,  its  function  being  carried  out  by  the
 AmigaOne's  G3/G4  CPU  &  memory.  For  this  reason  a  pass-through
 accelerator  slot on either the A1200 or A4000 version of the AmigaOne
 is completely pointless and therefore not included.

 As well as fitting into a Z4-compatible tower, the AmigaOne 1200  will
 also fit into a standard ATX tower case using an optional fitting kit.
 This makes an ideal solution for applications / operating systems that
 do not require the original AA chipset to be present.
