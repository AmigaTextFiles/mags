Just a couple of tips this month. If you have any tips you would like
to give them just send them in to general@aioworld.com

If your emailer, TCP, or other Internet App is taking too long to load
then try disabling all unnecessaary features.  Chief among them would
be logging; unless you really need it (like if you're having some
intermittent problem you've yet to identify) just turnm it off.  Also,
clean out your log files from time to time as they tend to accumulate
and take up unneccesary hard drive space.

MRQ:  A good enough replacement for ARQ but the requesters can get a
bit too big if you aren't careful.  T>his is due mainly to the default
button images they give, the checkmarks and such.  Just put these into any
good image editor and scale them down a bit and you should get saome
reasonable-sized requesters.

MultiFileSystem is a great program to have in your standard box of
goodies, but there is one bug I've found.  When you write the name of
the file system into the comment field, it seems that MFS doesn't like
comments longer than {bold}nine{nobold} characters...  I mean, it
{bold}REALLY{nobold} doesn't like it.  So, if your WB starts locking up
anytime a disk of any sort is inserted, recovering only when said disk
is removed, then check those comments.
