Well, lots of changs here at AIO, and all of them for the better.
{pp}
First off AIO has a new domain name and with it a whole set of
addresses.  www.aio.co.uk is now longer; now the place to go is
www.aioworld.com.  With this the suffixes of all our addreses have
been changed from @aio.co.uk to @aioworld.com as well.  So, update
your bookmark and address books and give us a new visit; the new site
should be up by the time you read this or within a couple of days of
that at the worst.
{pp}
Also you may have noticed a slight change of presentation. Yes, our
AIO GUI has had.a few updates.  Some of them operational ones that you
won't really see, others cosmetic that you are no doubt looking at
right now... Background images!  A nice little something, but that's
not the end of it; our GUI person Neil promises many more things to
come.  So stay tuned, AIO is getting better and better.
