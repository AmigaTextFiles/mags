Lately the Just-Amiga Mailing List has been full of posts about how to
handle PC ZIP disks on the Amiga, which mount file works and so on.  With
that for inspiration I realized that the mount files I've been using
work perfectly.  In fact, as a test I loaded up a PC-formatted ZIp disk
I'd gotten at the store and it worked fine; I was even able to read the
"readme.txt" file included on the disk as a final test.

The file I use is from the "FreDS-Zip250.lha" archive on Aminet.

For the 100 MB PC Zip, the one that comes with IOTools seems to work
fine.  You'll find it on the OS3.9 CD in the Storage/DOSDriver drawer,
though no doubt an Aminet search will turn up something as well.
