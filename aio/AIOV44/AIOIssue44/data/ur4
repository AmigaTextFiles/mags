Despite the fact that HTML in mails is totally unecessary and takes
up extra space, some people, especially PC users likes to use it,
therefore it can be good to have a good way to read them without
getting headaches from reading between the HTML code. HTMLread does
this, and it does that for you, and it's good at what it's doing too.
HTMLread is actually a bunch of Arexx scripts for use with YAM, thus
it can be a little tricky to get it installed properly if you lack
experience in doing these kinds of thing. However, the manual has
very detailed explanations and even pictures that illustrate the
exact way to get it done, so it really shouldn't be any problems even
for the inexperienced user to get this up and running. After
installing it you should be able to read HTML-mails through your
favourite browser/offline browser. HTMLread doesn't stop being great
just there, it has also a "badURL" protection, which check the mails
for nasty little things that are used to trace your actions with your
newly recieved mails. Perfect for the paranoid e-mail excentric user.

There aren't really any bad sides to these scripts. Frankly I can't
think of anything I'd want to see improved, although I'm sure there
are always other things that can be improved, so I'll just await
updates to this one and see what happens. I'm convinced it won't be
for the worst at least.
