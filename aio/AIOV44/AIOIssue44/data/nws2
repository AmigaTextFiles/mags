 The long awaited Grand Theft Auto beater Payback ("a really impressive
 piece  of  work" according to Amigactive) is now available to buy from
 the developer's secure on-line shop.  They  accept  payment  by  Visa,
 Mastercard,  EuroCard,  Visa  Delta, Switch, Solo or by cheque and can
 ship anywhere in the world.
{pp}
 The game costs 34.95 GBP (about 55 Euros or 108  DM  at  the  time  of
 writing)  plus  postage  and  packing.  PPC support is planned, but it
 obviously depends on the sales of the game, so  please  support  Amiga
 developers! (Plus, buying the game now means you get to enjoy the game
 while you wait for the PPC upgrade.) James Daniels, Apex designs
