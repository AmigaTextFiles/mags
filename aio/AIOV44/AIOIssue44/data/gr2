{subhead}PAYBACK - Commercial game (demo version reviewed){def}{p}
Review by Barry Riddiford

{pp}
I guess everyone gets a bit fed up now and again with PC owners
talking about how great the games are on their mega fast Pentiums. We
all sit there thinking, "I wish there were games like that for my
Amiga". Well, instead of wishing, James Daniels did something about
it. He created Payback.
{pp}
You've probably read his story in AmigActive issues 10 and 11 but for
those who haven't Payback is inspired by Grand Theft Auto on the PC
and is very impressive.
{pp}
Once you've got the game on your hard drive you can read the
instructions on how to control the game. These are very short which
is nice. You'll then have to select the preferences for the screen
mode and then you can hit the game icon.
{pp}
The demo then loads into a good-looking screen that lets you know it
is a three-minute demo and you can press fire to continue.
{pp}
The options menu is next but the only option that's of any importance
is "Start game".
{pp}
After the game has loaded you find yourself on foot in a snowy, city
environment with some chattery noise symbolising a person on the
phone. The bottom of the screen is where any dialogue is shown. The
person is telling you to answer the phone. You'll notice a map in the
top left. This shows your position and the location of your next
mission. Your character also has an arrow showing the general
direction he should take to reach the mission location.
{pp}
Also on screen are your health points and your wanted status that is
represented by stars. The more stars there are the more the cops want
to take you down.
{pp}
Well off I ran to the phone taking forever because I didn't realise
how easy it was to rob someone's car and drive there. Once I'd sussed
that there was no stopping me. Apart from the Time Out that cropped
up after 3 minutes. Bugger!!
{pp}
Oohhh, a nice scroller telling me the full features of the game.
Impressive. Can't escape. Damn, will have to wait!!!
{pp}
Well I ran the game again.
{pp}
Back into it you will notice that once you've got a taste for crime
you can't help but run people over, trash cars, rob cars, cause road
blocks and attack the police. The missions don't seem to matter
because you can only manage to do two of them before the demo runs
its course so why not cause mayhem instead?
{pp}
I ran the game again!
{pp}
The graphics and sound are terrific and, in the demo, set the game
off really well. The way the different cars, lorries and busses
handle is very clever, and new, to the Amiga. It is a very easy game
to get into. There's nothing better than tearing round the streets in
a police car, pulling skids into unsuspecting pedestrians! I found
myself wishing for more time and reloading the demo time and again.
{pp}
As far as I could find out, the game should run fine on an 030 with
16meg and a CD ROM but on a graphics card it should be a stunner.
It's been a long time since an Amiga game demo got me excited but
Payback certainly has. It should be out very soon and I'll be giving
Apex Designs my Visa number when it is.
