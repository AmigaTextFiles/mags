Well, as promised here are the tabulated results of the AIO Amiga
Performance Survey.  A copy is being sent to the powers at Amiga as
well as appearing in this issue.  So, for good and bad, here are both
the questions and answers, complete with a few comments.
{pp}
Twenty-six people responded to the survey, from countries scattered
all over the world.
{pp}
For the boys at Amiga read carefully; maybe something in
here may just help you avoid the past mistakes others have made.
{pp}
{pp}
 {bold}Question 1:{nobold}  Overall, how do you feel Amiga is doing in trying to bring back
 our favorite system?
{pp}
    {italic}Answers:{noitalic}{p}
     7.7%    1 = Comodore did better in it's end days{p}
     11.5%   2 = Abyssmal, but there's some hope{p}
     34.6%   3 = Fair, all things considered{p}
     42.3%   4 = Great!  Keep it up and we'll show those Wintel people{p}
     3.85%%  5 = I've died and gone to Ami-Heaven!
{pp}
     Comments:{p}
        The world is more filled
   with useless things nowadays (talking about human's incapacity to
   receive and process all the information out there) and therefore
   it's harder to make the news or catch anyone's attention, who's
   in the position to actually make a difference... If only some
   die-hard Amiga freaks pay attention and actually CARE, that's
   not going to change a god damn thing!
{pp}
{pp}
 {bold}Question 2:{nobold}  Do you agree with Amiga's Software only (or mainly) approach?
{pp}
     {italic}Answers:{noitalic}{p}
     61.5%   YES{p}
     38.5%   NO
{pp}          .
{pp}
 {bold}Question 3:{nobold}  How important is advertizing/marketing to Amiga's future?
{pp}
    {italic}Answers:{noitalic}{p}
    3.85%   1 = Who cares?{p}
    3.85%   2 = It'd be nice, but it's not really key{p}
    23%     3 = We do need some, but build a good product and they will come{p}
    50%     4 = At least as important as the chip they use{p}
    19.2%   5 = MORE important then the hardware.
{pp}
{pp}
 {bold}Question 4:{nobold}  Which chip would you most like to see a new AmigaONE system based around?
{pp}
    {italic}Answers:{noitalic}{p}
    3.85%   Alpha/ArmStrong{p}
    3.85%   68K{p}
    3.85%   any 128-bit CPU{p}
    7.7%    Intel/ Pentium III or IV{p}
    7.7%    Transmeta{p}
    23%     Any or No Comment{p}
    50%     PPC/G4
{pp}
    Comments:{p}
      -Who Cares? People get too tied up in what power a machine has
and not what the whole package has to offer. As long as its up to
date I'm happy.{p}
      -Definitely not Intel because it's always overclocked, thus requires cooling and more watts.{p}
      -The best so long as it's affordable
{pp}
{pp}
 {bold}Question 5:{nobold}  Of what you've seen/heard so far of the SDK and new Amiga  Operating Environment, how do you rate it?
{pp}
     {italic}Answers:{noitalic}{p}
     3.85%   1 = Give me Windows, PLEASE!{p}
     11.5%   2 = I think Linux still has the edge{p}
     42.3%   3 = Has problems, but still doing good.{p}
     34.6%   4 = Very good.  Better then I expected.{p}
     7.7%    5 = o/~ I found my Thrill...{p}
{pp}
     Comments:{p}
       -Main problems for now - no 3D and sound (IIRC) support...{p}
       -A comment, if I may :- Whatever Amiga do, just hope it's priced right!{p}
       - Now that basically the whole world
   is behind Windows, how could one expect anything decent to ever
   appear for such a small market? Even a "big" player like Apple
   doesn't get all the really nice things for their platform like
   Windows users... And the software forecast for the future goes:
   expect a shining absence of anything worthwhile all above Amiga-
   land, be it Classic or NG series!
