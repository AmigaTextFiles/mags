Well, February and I'm enjoying the sun here in my native California...
nothing to do with the sites this month, I just like pointing that out.
{pp}
Well, that aside, I've got the usual eclectic variety this time round,
no particular theme other then weitrd variety.  So, without further
delay I'll just present the sites (and then go out and enjoy the
sun...)

{bold}Bert Is Evil{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://fractalcow.com/bert/bert.htm{noitalic}{p}
So, you thought Bert off the classic children's television series Seasame
Street is just a good natured puppet?  wrong-o. Herein is evidence,
photographic and otherwise, that Bert is an evil maniac bent on taking
over the world!  Check out this site for more before it's too late!

{bold}Guess The Dictator and/or Television Sitcom Character{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://208.177.130.81/dictator/{noitalic}{p}
Another little online game only it's not you playing it this time but
the computer.  It gets to play twenty questions with you to try and
guess the world dictator or television sitcome character that you have
in mind.  If it doesn't guess then you get to submit a leading question
that it can use in the future should it run across that same one
again.  If it guesses, it'll tell you how many other times a player has
used that name in the game.  Interseting little diversion.{p}
First hint:  Don't use Julius Ceaser; it's been done to death.

{bold}King Features Syndicate-Comics{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.kingfeatures.com/features/comics/comics.htm{noitalic}{p}
An alphabetical listing of every comic strip King Features ever put into
a newspaper, each complete with a link to a little history on the comic.
Just the thing to go browsing through some classic old comics and find
the name of that one you'd forgotten about.

{bold}Katbot{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.katbot.com/katbot_flash.html{noitalic}{p}
Another ongoing online story ty[pe site, this one based on the alien
katbot on her mission here to Earth.  Interface is in the form of her
own log device, where you can peruse through her daily entries, read her
mission notes, look up profilres of the Earthling subjects she's
stufying, and generally keep track of her through her adventures.  Good
interface but one warning: heavy use of Flash here so have a good
connection or a lot of patience.
