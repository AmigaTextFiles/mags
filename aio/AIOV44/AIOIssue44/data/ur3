This program made me laugh a little bit, because it's almost as silly
as it is innovative and usable, especially if you're sick of the
plain old calculator, this is a fresh addition to the recent time's
skinning-frenzy in the Haage & Partner headquarters. There's really
not much to say about this. It's just a calculator with all the basic
features of one, the exception being the skins available for it.
Naturally I downloaded and tested them all, as they aren't at all big
and it's nice to change it once and a while. What I would like to see
in future versions would be a random skin every time you start up the
program. This (pretending such a thing could be possible) would
surely make math a bit more fun to do!
