{subhead}EXODUS - Commercial game (Demo version reviewed){def}{p}
Review by Barry Riddiford

I know that the way forward for the Amiga is in hardware like the
Mediator and Predator but these do cost a lot of money and not
everyone can afford these bits of kit. This is also where new games
are heading. You need PPC for this, graphics cards for that etc etc.
The classic user, I feel, is being left out of the commercial market.
It has been rare in this era of ports that a cracking game hits the
shelves and almost any Amiga owner can buy it.
{pp}
Exodus is that sort of game. You need the basic 030, AGA, 16mb ram
and a CD ROM and the game runs fine. In this demo version of the
forthcoming game there are only two levels but enough is shown here
that will have you watching the press for the release date!
{pp}
Anyway, Exodus is a real time strategy game. Your empire fights the
computer's empire. If you have played any real time strategy games
then Exodus will be very easy to get to grips with. If not, it's very
easy to get to grips with!
{pp}
When you open the Exodus drawer you have to select the prefs icon so
you can set the screen mode you want to use. That done, and saved,
you can then load the game.
{pp}
The intro screen is excellent and bodes well for the game. Into the
selection screen. Unfortunately you can only choose which race you
want to control and start the game. Both the races have their own
different scenario. Each scenario could take you about 2 hours to
complete. This gives you a very good idea of what the full game will
offer.
{pp}
Another superb loading screen and you get the mission briefing. Kill
everything. Hmmm doesn't seem too complicated. Off we go. You'll
notice, whichever screen mode you are in, that the graphics are
first-rate. They really show what the Amiga is still capable of.
{pp}
Once the game has loaded I advise you to go to the options menu. It's
here that you can speed the game up and make it that bit more
playable.
{pp}
So what do you have to do? Well, collect the natural resources,
convert that to capital and spend that on buildings and units. Didn't
we have all this in Dune 2? Yes we did but it's a tried and tested
method and if it's not broken why fix it. I did say it would be
familiar.
{pp}
First build yourself a power plant, then a mine, then a refinery,
then a radar station, then a light vehicle factory and so on. Each
building you build opens up a few more building and unit options. The
natural resource you need is a substance called Ixomit. It is
displayed as an oily puddle on the screen and your mines must be
placed on it.
{pp}
Build up your army. Defend yourself from the enemy. Attack and
destroy the enemy base. Like I said, not complicated.
{pp}
Exodus is an admirable piece of programming. Not only are the
graphics very slick and the in-game sound effects excellent but also
the artificial intelligence is really rather good. A bit too good
because the computer does not stand around to get shot, it actually
has the cheek to send its units around your defences. That's just not
cricket!! My only gripe is in the unit selection process. You can
only click on individual units or drag a square around a whole group,
which might pass as OK but the screen doesn't scroll. I hope this is
changed when the game is released. On the plus side each unit has up
to four command options easily viewable as you click on them.
{pp}
I really like Exodus. It is much like Napalm but prettier. I will be
buying it to add to my collection.
