CS: When was Apex Designs first started and how did it actually start?
{p} {p}
JD: Apex Designs was offically started in 1996 as a label to release my
public domain titles, such as Frontal Assault and 6-Tris, although I was
writing games for over ten years before that. Since then, I've moved on
to programming in C and assembler, which is essential for a project the
size and complexity of Payback.
{p} {p}
CS: Who is in the Apex Designs team and could you explain what each
person does?
{p} {p}
JD: Apex Designs is mainly just me, James Daniels. I do all the programming,
website design, sound effects and the bulk of the graphics. However, a
couple of artists are now working to improve Payback's graphics: Niko
Moreira and George Davis.
{p} {p}
Also, 10 bands are contributing to the soundtrack - a full list can be
found at {link http://www.apex-designs.net/report13.html}http://www.apex-designs.net/report13.html{end} - and the ATO will be
translating the game into several languages. Finally, there are about a
dozen betatesters to make sure the gameplay is as good as possible.
{p} {p}
CS: What projects are you currently working on and when do you expect them
to be released?
{p} {p}
JD: Payback - due for release in November.
{p} {p}
CS: This Grand Theft Auto style game, Payback sounds like an exciting project,
how is it similar to GTA and how does it differ?
{p} {p}
JD: The basic gameplay is quite similar to GTA, in that you are a criminal
doing missions for the local crimelord. However, Payback does have many
advantages over GTA. Firstly, it's in full 3D, which means that cars lean
realistically as they go around corners or up slopes. Even the trees and
pedestrians are in 3D. Secondly, Payback should be more varied that
GTA - I've attached some pictures of the snowy levels, and there are
plenty of other surprises in store.
{p} {p}
Also, Payback is very efficient and is able to match the performance of
the Playstation version of GTA even on an 040 - and it totally flies on
an 060! Even though Payback is certainly inspired by Grand Theft Auto, I
wouldn't really call it a clone - I've taken GTA's best bits and then
build on top of them to create a new game which should be a lot better
than GTA.
{p} {p}
CS: What do you expect the minimum requirements to be for Payback?
{p} {p}
JD: Requirements: 020, 16Mb RAM, CD, AGA/GFX card
{p} {p}
Recommended: 040/25 or faster, 16Mb RAM, 6x CD or faster, AGA/GFX card.
{p} {p}
CS: Do you have any future plans to make Amiga versions of popular games
from other platforms and/or do direct conversions of popular games?
{p} {p}
JD: I've got quite a few ideas for future games, but I want to get
Payback finished before discussing them.
{p} {p}
CS: How many years have you personally used the Amiga and why do you
continue to use it these days?
{p} {p}
JD: I've been using the Amiga for over 10 years. I use the Amiga because
it's a wonderful machine, with an equally wonderful community.
{p} {p}
CS: Any other comments or words you'd like to say to the Amiga users
reading?
{p} {p}
JD: A playable demo of Payback will be released in November at the same
time as the final game. Please download it and make sure you buy the full
game if you like what you see (and I'm doing my best to make sure that
you will :). The complete game will be available both from the Apex
Designs' website -
