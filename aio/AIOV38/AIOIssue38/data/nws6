From the readme:
{p} {p}
"This politely multitasking program will play all popular sound program modules
available on the amiga. Currently it supports over 150 (!) different module
formats plus one special format for modules which contain their own player.
ProTracker and PT-like players are internal; additional players are loaded from
disk. That means you can very easily add/update players by placing them into the
DeliPlayers directory."

The readme file also points out that DeliTracker is now only being developed for
Windows, under the name DeliPlayer.
