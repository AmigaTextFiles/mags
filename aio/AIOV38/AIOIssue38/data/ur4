It was with great anticipation I got the small package containing
this piece of hardware from Katodevelopment in Germany. When I opened
the brown cardboard-box I was greeted by a black and white manual,
first off in German, and then the English section. First of all, the
English would make my old English teachers get a heart attack, but I
did never have any trouble understanding the point they were trying
to make (well, except maybe for the "Only at best case it doesn't
work if this is done wrong" sentence boggled me to the point where I
just decided that it wasn't necessary to know precisely everything).
Anyway, the manual isn't the best I've seen, but the only thing that
might be a little confusing is that the manual refers to pictures in
the manual that doesn't exist, which can be a downside if you're not
too good at the Amiga's anatomy.

After tearing off the husk of my tower it didn't take me long to
locate the clockport on where the board is to be connected, plugged
it in and mount the analog part, that takes care of output and input.
{p} {p}
The card has two inputs, which surprised me a little, unfortunately I
haven't been able to test them for recording, because the microphone
from our PC wouldn't fit. And I haven't had the time yet to try and
plug in for example a cassette player and try to rip a tape. But I
trust them on this thing, it probably works, as long as you get your
hands on the right software at least. And speaking of software, you
also get a CD with a few useful programs (both freeware and demo
versions of other popular programs, such as Audio Evolution, BurnIT,
etc.), some demo songs both in MPEG and CDDA format, drivers for your
newly purchased soundcard, and perhaps the most important thing
(besides the drivers, of course) is a registered version of AMPlifier
which can use the hardware MPEG decoder on the card, as well as using
WinAMP skins, etc.

Now, it might be worth mentioning that the
installer script was behaving very weird, I had to open it in an
external text editor and look at it from there to see what it was
doing. After all installation is done, just run your favourite
soundprogram and start experiencing a whole new world of audial
opportunities - and after that you can start listening to all your
old MP3's again, and re-discover why you got them in the first place.
The sound and quality is amazing, and frankly I didn't think I'd see
the day when my Amiga would beat the PC on the audio front, too.
{p} {p}
There is only one thing that is sort of annoying with this soundcard,
and that is that you can't be connected to the internet and use the
soundcard at the same time if you use modem rates over 28.8. This is
apparently due to an interupt problem, it can however be solved by
buying Hypercom or Silversurfer - however, it's uncertain whether the
Silversurfer will work together with the Melody, since they both
connect to the clockport; even though there's "another" clockport
connector on the soundcard itself (thanks to Patrick Beerhorst for
clearing up this matter).

Final comment; this is a fine piece of German innovation, and at
least I thought the price was reasonable - after all, the MPEG
hardware decoder gives lowspec. users the opportunity to enjoy MP3's
the way they were meant to be. But there's also something you better
keep in mind when dealing with hardware that gets connected to the
clockport, or any other place where they were originally not intended
to be fiddled with: They are only hacks, and that's why it's not at
all certain that you get exactly what you bargained for. I would
probably now afterwards, if I have had the opportunity, bought the
Zorro version instead, which probably costs a little more, but
instead gives a little better results. But it still doesn't change
the fact that the Melody 1200 pro adds so much to your computer that
you'll wonder how you ever could have lived without it before,
especially if you fiddle around with music, composition and such, as
I do, you'll divorce "Paula" for good (unfortunately you'll have to
cheat with her once and a while because the sound.datatype doesn't
support soundcards/AHI, and the patch I tried for getting the
datatype to use AHI instead of audio.device didn't work). The card
and some of the software are perhaps not entirely faultless, but then
again, you shouldn't expect everything to be absolutely perfect.
