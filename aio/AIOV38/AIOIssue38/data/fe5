Well here I am writing my second article, doesn't seem like a month
but it has been. I am now looking for a 4000 to purchase (hint I'll
buy yours if your selling) and have been surfing e-bay a lot. The
used Amiga 4000's seem to be going for about 1000 bucks or so, with a
few add ons. I have been considering a 3000 and even a 2000 Ill just
wait to see what I can dig up and afford.

Well the Amiga scene is heating up, With a few interesting
announcements from the home office like a set top box in the works
and a laptop_..ooooohhh a lap top I would love one of those. I'm
actually starting to believe that the Amiga will return stronger than
ever, I'm getting excited about the prospects of what the new OS
could do for the computer world. If you are like me you look through
the Amiga news sites everyday hoping for any tid-bit of knowledge
about what is coming. I keep trying to not get to excited; I mean
what if this all falls through, but I can't help it I think I have
Amiga fever and its getting worse everyday. I hope t o god that all
this really happens for the sake of all those Amigans I've met out
there. These people really believe in the Amiga with there heart and
soul they are some of the most dedicated supporters of any product
I've ever met, and right now they are happier than they have been in
a very very long time.

Message to Amiga Inc. Please don't let us down, come through with a
great product that is stable and affordable and you will have legions
of people willing to donate any organ of your choice when needed.
Well until next month keep your eyes on the boing ball and keep
praying.
