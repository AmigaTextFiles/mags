Hmm, the seasons are changing already, Summer coming to an end for uys
here up North of the Equator. But with this change of season seems to
be coming another change. You can smell it in the air, seee it in the
growing undercurrent in the popular press, taste it as December comes
nearer. A change that might be, to quote from "2010", something
wonderous.
{p} {p}
That change is, of course, the return of the Amiga.  That unseen
presence you sense is the Amiga spirit rising up from the ashes of
defeat; beaten but unbowed, trampled upon yet still gazing up proud. A
Phoenix whose true influence can never be doubted.  Returned at last to
quell the doubts voiced by the naysayers of Fate.
{p} {p}
In other words, we're all really eager to see what new Amigas come out by
December.
{p} {p}
Be patient.  spend the time telling your PC friends of what cometh in
the night, show them the reports, news, and web sites detailing the new
Amiga OE, start the word of mouth that should preceed every such major
release.

This isn't a product release we're talking about, it's a
