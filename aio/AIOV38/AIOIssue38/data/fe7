Editor's Note: AIO recently got an email with a technical type question,
pleading for assistance. Well, after looking under every rock and tree
we finally turned up someone who could answer the proposed question. In
an effort to be at least somewhat helpful to the Amiga Community in
general, I am hereby posting the reply to said email in the hope that it
might be useful to a few other Amigans out there. The result is this
article by Shawn.

So, without further ado, I present Shawn's reply to the email question
by Schwag7.

Yes you're right . Apollo was bought out of Brian Fowler- they are now offering
the 68030 for a low US price of $100 last count.

But be ready and do the impossible because even on a PC people are weary of
overclocking . They reather spend $100 more.heck spend that extra money later
on the BOXER which I fully endorse and somebody else is going to soon.- Be
ready for the impossible . Get an Blizzaard 030/or /040 if posible for no more
then $100 for backup and make sure its not overclocked. Ebay.com is a good
place.

HOLD done both mouse buttons and you can go and step by step disable and even
call the A1200 a A500 for games like SPeedBAll which I have down before. Demos
that first came out on AMIGAformat wouldn't work on the acclarator cards
unless one you degraded by way of holding the 2 mouse butons down. or 2.
taking out the card and getting an old PMCIA 8meg card for your AMIGA which
should be given away if not at $5 US including shipping. The blizzard is a
great card and well I got the majority of games that wouldn't work on APpolLo
to work on Phase 5 Blizzard 030 040 and 060 cards.
