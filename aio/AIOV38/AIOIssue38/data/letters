Hi,
{p} {p}
I hope you can help. I furnished my father with a A1200 + hard drive a while ago.
Unfortunately he recently lost his sight, I'm after software which can take the place of
a screen. Calls out icons as the pointer passes over, reads out drop down menus and
reads files etc.

There are a couple for the PC called 'Jaws and Hal' also one for the Apple, Have you
any knowledge if there's one for the Amiga? Do you know if anybody is developing one ?
{p} {p}
I've got a copy of  'Say' which came with the A500 Workbench, I've also got a copy of
'Speechtoy', neither of which come close.
{p} {p}
Regards .......... D. G. Sturt.

Editor:  John, if your wondering why this reply wasn't directly emailed
to you, it's simple; I goofed.  After forwarding your question on to
Chris, I'd assumed your email would go along with it and deleted the
original email; I was wrong, and so here we are.  Sorry.{p}
