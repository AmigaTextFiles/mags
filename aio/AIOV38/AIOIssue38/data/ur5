IBrowse 2.2 has been available for quite some time now and as HiSoft have
briefly mentioned 2.3 being in progress, I thought it would be a good time to
look at the program and see what it currently has and what we might hope to see
in the new version. Vaporware have also demoed a new version of their web
browser, Voyager, which features a completely re-written layout engine (3.3, the
current release version is 3.2). We'll compare V3.2 and the new 3.3 demo too.

{bold}Basics{nobold}
{p} {p}
IBrowse is an Internet web browser.  It has FTP (file transfer protocol)
facilities too, but it's basically a web browser.  As long as you have a TCP/IP
stack and an internet account this program is all you need to access the world
wide web, but not email or newsgroups - this doesn't pretend to be an all-in-one
solution.
{p} {p}
{bold}Support{nobold}
{p} {p}
The Big Thing hyped for IBrowse 2 is that it supports JavaScript.  This is a
programming language used by web page authors to spice up the experience -
simple things like an image changing when you point to it.  It is not
{italic}Java{noitalic} - you can't run Java application programs with it.
{p} {p}
So, here are the major things supported:
{p} {p}
In: HTML, HTTP, FTP (these three are the basic protocols and languages for the
web), JavaScript, SSL.
{p} {p}
Out: Macromedia Shockwave and Flash, RealVideo/Audio, Java.
{p} {p}
You probably won't miss any of these.  Of them, Real would be the most
interesting, but isn't available for any OS but Windows, Linux, QNX and Mac.
Voyager3 supports Shockwave/Flash, but this (a vector animation plug in) rarely
plays a major part on a webpage.  You can nearly always use a HTML version
instead.  Java - well, we'd all like Java on the Amiga.
{p} {p}
I mention that IBrowse 2.2 supports SSL.  This isn't strictly true; it supports
MiamiSSL which provides excellent SSL compatibility, but if you don't run Miami
you don't get SSL.  IBrowse 1.2 supported SSL directly and this is something
promised again in a future version of IBrowse.
{p} {p}
{bold}Speed{nobold}
{p} {p}
Here IBrowse scores extremely well. Voyager 3.2 can spend quite some time (5-10
seconds on an 040) laying out a complex page with tables, such as those at
http://www.theregister.co.uk/ or http://www.realdreams.cz/amiga/, while IBrowse
displays them pretty much straight away. The Voyager 3.3 Alpha shows that the
new Voyager may be even faster, but that could be some time away from a usable
program.
{p} {p}
A contributor to the 'feel' of the speed of the program is a feature, unique to
IBrowse, where you can open two URLs in one window and swap between them with a
normal MUI 'tab'.  IBrowse confusingly calls these 'browsers' - you can open
many windows each with many browsers each.  This is a great feature in that you
can open a window per website: open two or three BBC news articles in one
window, two or three Amiga.org articles in another, and keep these two different
sites each locked into one window.  Very smart!
{p} {p}
{bold}Display Quality{nobold}
{p} {p}
Those with AGA, ECS or a 256 colour limited graphics board should certainly take
a look at IBrowse.  It's image rendering quality is much better than either
Voyager or AWeb thanks to its excellent colour choice and fast dithering.  AWeb
comes in close behind but Voyager has some way to go, with very slow dithering
holding it back.
{p} {p}
In high or true colour, IBrowse is as good as anything else available.  It is
fast, but not noticable faster or slower than either AWeb or V3.2.
{p} {p}
HTML is well handled: like AWeb, it correctly displays some types of columns
side-by-side, a task Voyager 3.2 can fail at. http://www.bbc.co.uk/ is an
example of this. HTML is generally well handled by IBrowse, supporting most
modern features but lacking stylesheet ("CSS," cascading style sheet) support,
like all other Amiga web browsers. Stylesheets are a special way for web authors
to specify exactly how a page should look by defining styles of text to use
thoughout the web site - these common styles include font, font size, attributes
such as colour and boldness, and alignment. Support for this is necessary for
any big website, such as the BBC's, to look correct.
{p} {p}
Voyager recently introduced support for the "FONT FACE" HTML tag. This special
tag allows a web author to define exactly the font you see on screen, not just
the usual 'fixed width,' 'normal' and heading types. While IBrowse does support
this, it is not in such an easy and automatic way as Voyager.  Firstly, each
font must be defined in the IBrowse preferences; V3.2 will use a font if it
exists on the computer.  Secondly, IBrowse appears to ignore secondary
preference fonts - if "Verdana, Arial" is specified then IBrowse seems to look
only for Verdana even if Arial is defined.  This said, IBrowse does allow you
to define the fonts used when printing (text only and postscript only
supported currently).
{p} {p}
{bold}Stability{nobold}
{p} {p}
Here is where IBrowse 2.2 starts to fail. The browser is very reliable, unless
you happen to click on a form or use an SSL (secure) link. At this point, you're
quite likely (at least, on my Amigas) to have the IBrowse Network Task fail and
so pop up a suspend/reboot requester. Thankfully, you can nearly always click
"Suspend" and IBrowse will continue working so you can load another web page
(but not the same one; that will just fail again), but this lack of forms and
SSL is very bad. IBrowse 2.3 must fix this for IBrowse to be a viable web
browser.
{p} {p}
Dispite this, IBrowse 2.2's Javascript support is very stable, on par with AWeb.
V3.2 sadly is not as reliable.
{p} {p}
{bold}Summary{nobold}
{p} {p}
I've scratched the surface of IBrowse's feature list here.  There are some quite
unique things IBrowse can do, such as specifying a different configuration for
each website, but dispite all this I'd recommend you wait for version 2.3's
release.  There are some important issues with stability which need to be
addressed by HiSoft, and once these are fixed IBrowse will be very good indeed.
