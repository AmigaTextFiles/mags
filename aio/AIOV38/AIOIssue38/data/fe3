WordWorth 7:{p}
Run something like CyberGuard before running Wordworth.Wordworth 7
has a bug which causes an enforcer hit on startup that could lead to
eventual crash when you least need it. Running CyberGard before
the program will catch this.

System Fonts:{p}
Want True TYpe and Type 1 Postscript fonts on your Amiga?  Use
ttfmanager and t1manager; they hook into the normal compugraphic
system as easy as anything, for rather small programs that need only be
run once while installing said fonts.

REXX Script Location:{p}
REXX scripts can really accumulate and most people's chosen place for
then is in S:.  Now, S: gets cluttered enough as it is, so what I do
is set up a directory in SYS: called RexxS:, assign RexxS: to it, and
add it into my path list in my startup-sequence. Makes it a lot easier
when looking through S: for non-REXX scripts and other stuff
