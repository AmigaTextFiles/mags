With summer coming to a close (or Winter ending, depending on your
current Hemisphere), I have some light fare for you this month, with
maybe only one site designed to be actually useful.  So sit back, bring
your monitor up, and start clicking your way around the Net.

Modern Humorist{p}
http://www.modernhumorist.com{p}
Another online paradoy magazinbe, this one's not to bad. With
stories parodying the Survivors show (this one in New Jersey), their
versionof the nbew US 5 dollar bill, Ask Jeez (as in Jesus, but don't
expect the answers to be revelatory), and how to stop online music
piracy (there's a great picture comparing it to Communism), it's worth
the daily chuckle.

Love tests, IQ tests, career tests, and dozens more.  If you want to
find out your true color or what breed of dog you are, then try out this
link.  BTW, my tested color is Black.

Makes your own animated banners, gif buttons, and 3-D text, then if you
still want more you can download the fonts, some of the over 20,000
images, or animated GIFs.  Use the online tools and save the results to
your harddrive for yuour own webpage.  simple and straight-forward.

Cast Our Movie{p}
http://www.castourmovie.com/{p}
Another take on the growing "become the movie producer" sites that have
bveen springing up, this one alklows you to cast the stars for the
various roles of the ovie in question.  Review head shots, resumes, and
scripts to see who might be right for the role.  So, take control of
who stars in the movie you watch.

SciFi 2000{p}
http://www.scifi2k.com{p}
Looking for a good SciFi homepaage? Well, this is a good place to start. 
From News and Movies, listings of shows, books, Quotes, and the virtual
library, it's got about all you might ask for.
{p} {p}
Movies. Rare or cult (Surf Nazi's Must Die!  anyone?), when they were made, what they're about, and
possibly how to get them.  Movies soon to come out, movies in the works,
sold scripts, and reviews of movies in theaters. If you're trying to
find that one rare film shown once in 1967, you'd do worse to start
here.
{p} {p}
The Virtual Library contains downloadable stories submitted buy buding
writers like YOU. So, download and read or upload and submit.  either
way it's a blast.
{p} {p}
There's a rather comp;lete list of SF series names, though only a few 
have links to show summaries and some basic series info. There's also 
the expected downloadable SF themes in MP3 format (along with some
sitcom themes which I don't know why they're included).  Toss in a few 
famous quotes to round things out.
{p} {p}
The News section keeps you up to date on everything happening in the
SF world, be it movies, television, or whatnot. Throw in some Fan
Opinions, book reviews, collectibles, space art, and even a few VHS
covers and you have a pretty well rounded site.  Definitely the kind of
place where a true dyed in the wool Sf fan can spend an hour or so
browsing through.

Darn!  My hour's up.
