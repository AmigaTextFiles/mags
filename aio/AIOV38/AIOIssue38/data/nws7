Those of you with PPC cards will like this: MorphOS is a PPC native AmigaOS,
which here right *now*.
{p} {p}
It works by running the AmigaOS under a 68k emulation, but allows parts of the
OS to be replaced by PPC native code under time.  The possibility for MorphOS to
be ported to other hardware platforms is there, given the availability of
them...

As Oliver Wagner writes in his .plan file, about Voyager:
{p} {p}
"Yes, there eventually will be a MorphOS native version of V. We've been
following MorphOS development closely, and both me and Zapek were MorphOS alpha
testers. No time frames for this right now, as the top priority is still to get
all browsing functionality back in the AmigaOS version with the new layout
engine. However, provisions for a MorphOS-native version are already in the new
source tree. I think it's now obvious why we always considered "OS 3.5" and
related stuff a dead end ;)"
