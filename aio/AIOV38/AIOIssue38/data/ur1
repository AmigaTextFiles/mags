Review by Johan Van Mensel

{p} {p}
A synthesizer on my Amiga ?
{p} {p}
I held that for impossible !
{p} {p}
I always  thought if  I want to create  my own  sounds I
would  have  to  buy  me  a REAL synthesizer, 'cause the
soundprograms  I  have  found up  until  now  could  not
convince me!
{p} {p}
I found the demo  of S.A.M. on Aminet, loaded a few sets
with  demo  samples and synthesized ( calculated ) them.
{p} {p}
I immediately ordered S.A.M. `cause I could  not believe
my ears! Did those sounds really came out of my Amiga?
{p} {p}
{center}{bold}How does S.A.M. work?{nobold}
{left}
{p} {p}
The screen is very conveniently arranged. Underneath the
screen you have a display  where  you can  call  in  the
sound, sample or LFO waves.
{p} {p}
First... load a sample ( later I go into details ). Then
you put the sample or samples in the WAVE-SEQUENCER, the
wave-sequencer  will be inserted in a PATCH, and finally
the sound goes thru the EFFECT-GENERATOR  where  you can
add  CHORUS/FLANGER, REVERB, ECHO, DISTORTION and BOOST.
{p} {p}
S.A.M. can load and save SETS.
A set can have maximum of:-
   128 samples  (RAW / with  max. 64 KB each)
   64 wave-sequences
   64 patches
   32 LFO's
   32 sounds  (in 1 set S.A.M. can calculate thirty two sounds -maximum length of the samples is 64 KB. )
{p} {p}
With the  program  are  500 samples and a printed manual
delivered  ( only GERMAN ),  among  which the well-known
triangle, square, and sawtooth waves, used  in the first
synthesizers are  present.
{p} {p}
The GREAT  advantage of  S.A.M. is  that  you  can  load
( RAW ) samples and  use  them as the basis for your new
sound. You can shorten the sample and set a loop.
{p} {p}
The next step is the  WAVE-SEQUENCER.
{p} {p}
In the  wave-sequencer it is possible to  load 1 or many
samples after each other. ( max. length of wave 64 KB. )
1 sample = 1 step, 1 SET can have a maximum of 800 steps
in combination  with  the LFO's!  Interesting for making
arpeggio's, drum-rhythms  or  space sounds.  When loaded
in a patch, the wave-sequencer  is treated  as a sample.
I have tried here with many little samples and I came up
with  very  surprising  and interesting results!  If you
intend  to  make  a  complex  wave-sequence  and  1 or 2
complex LFO's to add in your new  WAVE it  is  best that
you  make  a  new  SET to  have  the maximum  number  of
steps possible.
{p} {p}
You can  edit your own LFO curves ( in 1 set up to 32 ).
( the  more complex the LFO is, the more steps you need,
but for example to make a simple sawtooth or square-wave
you  only need about 10 steps, so 800 steps for 1 SET is
really  more than enough ). After  the  last  sample  is
always a GOTO-X , an automatic loop that  can  be edited
anywhere in  the  sequence. ( Also  at  the end of a LFO
curve is an automatic GOTO-X loop )
{p} {p}
The parameters from the sequencer are (for each sample):{p}
 VOLUME of the sample.{p}
 TRANSPOSE ( in halve tones ) 2 octaves low and 3 high.{p}
 LENGTH{p}
 CROSSFADE  smooth or brute ( from 0-slow to 200-quick ){p}
{p} {p}
{center} PATCH
{left}
{p} {p}
The  parameters of  a patch are  the  same as  the first
synthesizers.
{p} {p}
WAVE-SEQUENCER   here you choose the sequence ( sample ){p}
                 that you want too calculate.{p}
ATTACK-TIME{p}
DECAY-TIME{p}
SUSTAIN-TIME{p}
SUSTAIN-LEVEL{p}
RELEASE-TIME{p}
PITCH-LFO NR{p}
PITCH-LFO SPEED{p}
FILTER-TYPE{p}
RESONANCE{p}
FREQUENCE{p}
FILTER-OUTPUT{p}
FILTER-LFO NR{p}
FILTER-SPEED
{p} {p}
When calculating you can merge up too 4 patches together
and set from each patch :
{p} {p}
DELAYTIME     starting time{p}
LEVEL{p}
TRANSPOSE     1 octave  up or  down in halve notes steps
{p} {p}
Very useful for making your already complex drum-rhythms
more complex,  chords,  distorted  guitar  sounds and so
much more. ( 3 examples in the manual )
{p} {p}
After  this  the  sound  is sent through the EFFECT-LOOP
GENERATOR  where  you  can add  a maximum  of 4  effects
at  the  same  time.  And  if  that  is not  enough, all
effects can be separately  adjusted to your liking.
{p} {p}
S.A.M. converts  and  calculates in  16 bit.  After  the
effect generator S.A.M. converts  the  sample  back into
8 bit.  This  is  done  for  minimum  distortion  during
calculation.
{p} {p}
Once having produced the final product (your new sample)
it is  then  possible  to  set the length and set a loop
that  automatic  seeks  the  zero  point. ( for avoiding
those annoying clicks )
{p} {p}
The sample can only be saved  RAW, this means  you can't
save the loop.  I  personaly  don't  have a problem with
that, because  I  only edit the loops while making a new
module.

{center}{bold}CONCLUSION{nobold}
{left}
{p} {p}
PROS :  The possibilities of this Sample Synthesizer are many!{p}
        The program is friendly and easy too use!
{p} {p}
You  can  start  with  any  basic-sound  you like, and
In  the  wave-sequencer  you  can  add  more than enough
samples.
{p} {p}
You can edit your own LFO's!!
{p} {p}
At  the end you can merge up to four patches
(calculated sounds)  together.
{p} {p}
The effect generator is excellent!
{p} {p}
Much  shall  also  depend on  the  inventiveness
of the  composer!  The  more imagination, the  more  you can get
out of this  synthsizer!!!
{p} {p}
THE PRICE !!!   I have payed only £12   +  £2  P + P !!! 30 DM + 5 DM porto.
{p} {p}
   CONS :
{p} {p}
Minor  point  is  the  printed  manual.  It is VERY well
written but only in German.  The program explains itself
but for the few details you will need a good dictionary!
{p} {p}
The  length  of the samples ( max. 64 KB. ) is good, but
for new-age samples it is not enough.  I personaly would
like to see the length at least as twice as long.
But as I mentioned before... let your imagination work!
{p} {p}
You have your Octamed to do this for you!
{p} {p}
