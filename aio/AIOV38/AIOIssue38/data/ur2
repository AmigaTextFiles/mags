BladeEnc is another freeware MP3 encoder available under the Lesser
General Public License for the Amiga, if you want to know a little
more about the MP3 format (not very much more, though ;) then read my
earlier review of LAME 3.86 also in this issue. This encoder is also
based on the sourcecode from the ISO-group, but I seem to recall that
this one still has quite a bit left of the original sourcecode
whereas LAME has pretty much got rid of all of it.

BladeEnc is slower - in fact, it is terribly slow, the same sample I
used in the LAME review took more over an hour to encode. There is
however an explanation to this, according to the author Tord Jansson.
He says he has never sacrificed quality over speed, which of course
is good - but I have at least never been able to hear any remarkable
difference with BladeEnc vs. LAME, in fact I simply just don't like
the "feeling" of BladeEnc. I guess I'm just a "lame" person (hehe).

BladeEnc is supposed to be very good at higher bitrates than 160 Kbit
- and that is hopefully right, because the result when using lower
bitrates, such as 128 Kbit is right out terrible.

Anyway, there's not too much more to say about BladeEnc, I guess
it's mostly a matter of preference which encoder you prefer. The best
thing is to try out all the different ones available and go for the
one you like the best.
