@{fg shine} Welcome@{fg text}

 As another month rolls by there is no news of any developments in the
Amiga world, as we all wait in suspence until a new machine or at least
the new OS is released, but as always were back again to cheer you up
and let you in on what is good and what is not.

 This month sees more changes in the layout of AIO (again) don't worry
though there all for the better. The difference is the menus are a bit 
different to make it easier to read and navigate, thanks to Cryton for 
pointing that out!

 This month we've pulled of the stunts as usual and got and EXCLUSIVE
interview with Sadeness Software :) so check out the articles section!

 As usual remember, if you havn't filled out 'Form.txt' included with
this archive then fill it in now and get it sent off, it all goes
towards making AIO better and keeping you in touch with when new 
issues are released. Well see you same place next month, ByeeEEEeee!

 NOTE: Look out for next months issue for an exclusive interview with
Vulcan Software!

@{fg shine} ClickBOOM news 11@{fg text}

Hello from clickBOOM!

For this edition of clickBOOM news, we have something quite different.

It's called "CLICKBOOM AMIGA WEB RING"!

"What is that?!", you may be asking yourselves. 
No, it's not a new game, as a matter of fact, it has very little to do
with games.

"clickBOOM Amiga web ring" is clickBOOM's non-profit project intended
to connect all (personal and commercial) Amiga web sites on Internet!

It's a brand new plan, and for it to ultimately succeed we need all
Amiga web site owners to join this magnificent way of making the Amiga
web presence stronger and more organized. 

If you have an Amiga-related web site, this absolutely FREE way of
promoting is a must. It will improve traffic on your site, while also
contributing to linking all Amiga web sites in the most efficient way.

We will outline the basic principles and benefits of Amiga web ring
here, but for the complete information and application form, please
visit http://www.clickboom.com .


HOW DOES IT WORK?
-----------------
Imagine for a moment that every Amiga web site on its front page has a
simple control panel, similar in looks to that of a CD player.

A visitor to any site in this "Amiga ring" can simply click on the
"next" button to jump to the next site in the ring. He can then
explore this new site, and at any time use the panel from this site to
go to the next one in the ring. 

Going from one site to another would allow a user to eventually visit
all Amiga web pages and after making a "full circle" he would be back
to the site where he started from. 

In addition to this, the ring allows a user to go in both
"directions", skip, see the next/previous five sites, or jump to a
random site in the ring. 

This might seem like a complicated thing, but once you see it on the
main page of clickboom.com or pxlcomputers.com , you will realize how
simple, yet effective it can be.



BENEFITS FOR WEB SURFERS 
------------------------
clickBOOM Amiga ring is a dream come true for any surfer looking for
Amiga information on the web: 

1. You have a simple uniform control panel with which you easily
"flow" from one Amiga site to another. This will discover for you
hidden Internet Amiga gems - and that's what surfing the Net is about.


2. You will be able to visit all Amiga related sites, no matter how
small or large - from a personal web site of an Amiga user in Alaska
to a manufacturer or retailer carrying Amiga products. 

3. You will never have to use search engines to look for Amiga sites
again. 

4. There are no dead links in Amiga ring, because as soon as any site
is removed from the web, it is also removed from the ring, and panels
on all sites are instantly "informed" not to use that site anymore. 



BENEFITS FOR OWNERS OF PERSONAL HOME PAGES 
------------------------------------------
1. Add traffic to your web site. ANY VISITOR to ANY SITE in the
clickBOOM Amiga ring is a potential visitor to your site, as well! 

2. Your site could be next to a high traffic web site like clickBOOM,
and any surfer to choose "next" from such a site would visit yours, as
well! 

3. No programming, or maintenance necessary. Once you add the HTML
code to your page, it automatically handles traffic from and to your
web site. 

4. It's absolutely, positively FREE! 



BENEFITS FOR COMMERCIAL WEB SITES 
---------------------------------
No matter how popular your site is, you can never have too many users
visiting it. Amiga web ring will increase traffic on your site,
guaranteed. 

1. ANY VISITOR to ANY SITE in Amiga ring is a potential visitor to
your web site! 

2. All surfers to use the ring are Amiga users looking for more 
information on the web, and isn't that what you have your web site
for? 

3. Commercial web sites can even use an alternative panel without a
clickBOOM logo, no questions asked. (contact us first to obtain such
panel) 

4. It's FREE! 


Thanks,
clickBOOM

@{fg shine} NEWS RELEASE 30th September@{fg text}

 Vulcan Software Limited is proud to announce huge changes to it's
operations. An exciting new alliance has been formed, from October 1997
Weird Science Ltd and their international trading partners GTI GmbH will
begin exclusive distribution of all Vulcan products.

 Vulcan has been distributing it's own products for the past four years
to dealers around the world and to the public through it's international
mail order service, but all this is about to change. GTI will be taking
over Vulcan's European trade accounts whilst all Vulcan's existing
registered users will be transferred into the capable hands of Weird
Science who will provide them with regular mailings about Vulcan
releases along with excellent mail order service. 

 We would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our registered
users for their support and encouragement over the years and offer our
reassurance that they are not losing a Vulcan but gaining a Weird
Science and it's for the benefit of all concerned including the Amigas
future.

 These changes have been undertaken as a direct result of the enormous
expansion of Vulcan's development and publishing operations. Vulcan has
set it's sights on higher spec titles in it's drive to bring Amiga
gaming in line with other platforms. In June 1997 we announced that all
future titles would be Amiga CD Rom only in direct response to the
quality of software that is currently in development and began actively
supporting graphics cards and sound cards in releases such as Genetic
Species, Hard Target and Almagica. Future developments include PPC
support, details of which will be announced shortly.

 "We felt that in order to realise our current goals, we would have to
re-evaluate our existing operations." says Lisa, director of Vulcan
Software. "It is all very well producing the cream of Amiga
Entertainment software but it is equally important that the distribution
network can do justice to the efforts of our army of developers which
now includes 14 dedicated teams and over 100 graphic artists, musicians,
programmers, 3D animators and translators. With Weird Science and GTI
handling our distribution needs we can dedicate our time and resources
to our development and publishing operations."

 All these advancements can only build on the excellent record we have
achieved so far, our list of imminent releases is a testament to this
and includes the likes of Strangers, The Final Odyssey, Uropa2, Genetic
Species, Hell Pigs, Wasted Dreams, Hard Target and Almagica, Scions of a
Forgotten World.

 Weird Science and GTI are professional, imaginative companies with a
real commitment to the Amiga Market, together we can ensure that all our
releases are given the exposure they deserve and are accessible to Amiga
users everywhere.

 @{b}6k PacMan V1.1:@{ub}

 Last issue we reviewed a small but good game called, 6k Pacman, now
a new version has been released, V1.1, the new feature is that the
Pacman doesn't stop when each goast comes out of the box in the centre
of the screen. This may not seem like a major update or feature but
it makes the game a bit more playable.

 @{b}Civ CD in shops@{ub}

 Finally Civilization CD version has been released in UK shops,
mainly in Electronics Boutique, this was meant to have been
in shops last month but problems with this and that prevented
it happening. Electronics Boutique are monitoring the sales of
CivCD to see if future Amiga CD games are a viable selling
options, so if you like this game make sure you buy the CD
version.

 @{b}PageStream 3.3 annouced@{ub}
 
 Softlogik have annouced their support for the Amiga by a new release
of Pagestream, it can be bought as an upgrade for exsisting users
of past versions. It will cost $50 for owners of 3.2 and $85 for
users of 3.0 and 3.1. There is said to be many new options enclueding

@node "gr1" "Ants"

@{fg shine} Ants games compilation@{fg text}

 Ants is a games compilation from Underground P.D, it contains 3 games; 
Ants, Bang!, and Skiddy Things.

 To start with, Ants is a cross between Worms & Lemmings, you are a
little guy who has to destroy a certain amount of ants to complete the 
level and gain a level code. It is very playable, and you can either
drop a bomb or blast the ants to kill them. The backdrops look like they
were created using a Voxel engine, like Scenery Creator, this makes the
graphics look unprofessional, but what do you expect from a P.D disk?

 Next up, is Bang!, this is a simple Bat `n' Ball game, but this one is 
mega, it has loads of bonuses, special features, and if you lose the
ball on any level it bounces back to the previous level until you catch 
it or it goes past level 1. Great!

 Last, is, what you could call a racing game, called Skiddy Things, you
are a little character who races against another character on one of 
four skiddy tracks. And, as a bonus, on the title screen you can play a
game of tennis!

a big craze has swept the world and the only place you (were) safe
from them was your Amiga but that has now all changed.

 Amitamagotchi is the third one of the Amiga Tamagotchi's i've
downloaded but the other two weren't that good to be honest so
this is the one i've decided to review. As you all probably know
what Tamgotchi is and what one ruffly looks like I won't go into
to much detail over the cosmetics of it, but just to give you an
idea heres a little run down.

 Upon loading Amitamagotchi you are presented with a good looking
GUI, the options enclued Start, Load, Save, Prefs and Quit. Once
clicking on Start a window will open which is quite big and doesn't
really fit into the corner of your screen as it's a bit to big. You
will then see the egg in the middle, options around the outside of
the egg and three buttons at the bottom of the window.

 You will have to wait around 5 minutes for the egg to hatch but you
can go off and write a letter or play a WB game as it will beep as
soon as it hatches. Most of the options work but as this is only
a beta version some don't. You can feed, play, clean and discipline
at the moment with the rest of the functions implented later. The
save and load option works alright but you have to run the program
and then load otherwise the screen will mess up if you load from the
start menu, the Author doesn't recommend you use the Load and Save
option as he hasn't sorted them out totally yet, but they worked
fine for me.

 Overall this is a good Amiga Tamagotchi if you like these things,
although not as good as the real thing, as it only comes to life
when you run it. My main concern with AmiTamagotchi is that it
eats CPU like anything, I tried running dopus while the little
blighter was running and it took quite a while but overall a nice
program to keep you happy.

@{fg shine} TFX@{fg text}

 As you might know TFX was given away on the October issue
of CUAmiga so we prase them for bringing us this execllent
game. They gave it away on the cover CD but if your like
me and don't have access to a CD-Rom you can send away
for the 11 disks for a bargin price of £4.50 including
P&P. Anyway on with the game.

 As soon as you load up the game you know your in for a
real treat, the music is very atmosferic and even the
credits are presented well. You come to the main menu
which funily enough still has the compiled date and
beta version number what Ocean put on the game themselves
so something tells me this is not the FULL, FULL version
but it is 99% complete and is not just going to do nothing
once you get so far through so don't worry ;).

 You get options to either train, simulator, check stats
and things like that and start game. Training if you didn't
know is getting you used to the controls which is advisable
if you havn't played it before just to get you into the
swing of things. The simulator is another type of training
mode but your not actually flying, your in some kind of
simulator put in a position that you might be when your in
head-to-head battle with someone. There are various stats
options to check like who is top pilot but thats to boring to
go into here and is not worth mentioning.

 If your like me you'll probably want to jump in straight
away so you'll jump at the chance on starting a new game. Once
you've entered you forename, surname and nickname/handle
your thrown in at the deep end and get a lecture off some
top important bloke, oh yes! Then you proceed to the game.

 In game you don't have to take off which is good and saves
time, there are different levels of detail you can choose
from, from high detail and textures to low detail and textures
turned off. I have looked at high detail and everything that
makes the game look better and I wish I had a good enough
machine to get it running at that speed because the view is
incredible. As usual though i'm stuck with low detail and
nearly every fancy gadjet Off :( Don't worry though if your
just a basic 020 owner at least you get to play the game
at a good speed even if the view isn't so hot.

 After you've increased the speed a little and get the hang
of the controls you can probably go into timewarp which
sends the game a bit quicker, once your near enemy planes
switch off timewarp and get ready for a dogfight, the
best tactic is to lock on and fire before one of the planes
reaches you, as effect you get a litte voice saying locked on
and someone from another friendly aircraft saying "good shot"
and "looks like a lizard" just to add excitment to the game.

 There is so much in TFX that could be explained but it would
probably make AIO 1000 pages bigger and would unfortuanally
take up to much time to write. I hope that i've give you an
idea of how good it is because this game is great. Make sure
you buy the CUAmiga to take up the offer. This IS probably
the BEST flight sim on the Amiga ever!

@{fg shine} Amipet@{fg text}

 As these seem to be the 'in' thing at the moment, we've found another
one which is quite good, yes were talking about those damn tamagotchis,
again!
 
 This one is quite different to the rest of them, the best thing about
it is that it hardly takes any of your CPU up, so it is very WB friendly
and doesn't slow anything down. Once you've loaded Amipet you get a
small window with a happy bouncing ball in it. It doesn't look like a
real tamagotchi but it has all the usual features like feed, vet, play...
etc.

 You really need an battery backed up clock for this one because everytime
you load it up it calculates how longs it's been alive since you last
run it, unfortunally I didn't know that and left it without toutching
it for about a day. When I came back to it i found it was dead :(.

 This one is alright but it seems to go to the toilet to much and I
couldn't seem to get the feed option working :( Overall thought
this is great because it doesn't eat to much CPU like most of the other
ones i've tryed.

@{fg shine} Gloom 3 Preview@{fg text}

 As you all may know Gloom 1 & 2 where Doom style games so that
really lets you know what Gloom 3 is. As with the last 2 games
of Gloom the idea is to go around a 3D rendered type maze and
blast all the baddies and other nasty monster type of things.

 In this version of Gloom you have to go around and kill Zombies,
the game plays pretty much the same but the graphics are changed
a little, maybe to your liking and maybe not to your liking,
although I prefered the GFX in the last two games these will do
and are an improvement over the orginal two games.

 The demo I have tried has 5 levels and they all look pretty good,
the graphics are now maybe to scary for young children as the
start screens have images of zombies with boils and warts, but
why would young children be playing this type of game anyway!? The
usual modem connection and other setup features are still there
and nothing much in the menu has changed except the 'gore' names
have changes to 'dirty' and 'nasty'.

 Overall the game is looking pretty good and I can't wait until
it's released, which is said to be around Christmas '97 so not
to long to wait now!

 As you may have noticed the cheats and tips have not been regular
recently as I don't think it's worth putting them in, if I get
even at least one request to keep them then I will but otherwise
this will be the last Cheats & Tips.

@{b}EXCLUSIVE Sensi Soccer '96/'97 Cheats@{ub}

 You may be wondering why these cheats for Sensi Soccer are exclusive,
well they were found out by me, Chris Seward, the editor of AIO, and
to my knolage these have not appeared in any Amiga magazine before.
They are based around cheats that are around but they are better.

Getting kickoff whenever you want it:

 This one only works if you had first kickoff from that half, if
you did then when the opposite sides goalkeeper has the ball press
fire and then tap 'R' keeping hold of fire replys will finish, wait
while still holding fire and after about 20-30secs of holding fire
the screen will scroll down to the centre of the pitch, let of fire and
you will have kickoff, this also works if you had kickoff from the
start of the half and they have kickoff after you've scored against
them. This also works from freekick, maybe penaltys but i havn't
tryed them yet.

Making the time run out quicker:

 While ingame press 'r' and then quickly hold fire, replys will
finish and keep hold of fire, you will notice that no one can
do anything and the time ticks away quickly. Let go of fire to
continue the game or when the time reaches 89mins.

@{b}Theme Park@{ub}

 In the player details section enter your name as Mark Lamport and
your nickname as MarkL. When in the game press C for cash, Alt and
Z for all the rides and an Amiga key and Z for all the shops.

@{b}Sensi Soccer '96/'97@{ub}

Kickoff:

 From kickoff face the opositions goal, pull back and press fire,
keep hold of fire and just when the ball is near the goalkeeper
press 'R' for reply a couple of time, still holding fire, the
replys will finish and the goal keeper won't have enough time to
react so it'll just roll in.

Penalty:

 Press and keep hold of fire, press 'R' a couple of time keeping
hold of fire, replys will finish and the ball will go in.

In-Game:

 Face at the goal or aim at the goal, keep hold of fire and press
'R' a couple of times, after the replys have finished still
holding fire the ball will go in, as long as you were shooting
at the goal.

 You can use this cheat from almost anywhere as long as you
keep hold of fire.

 Games are reviewed mostly on playability and how long they will last
you, although some big games with fancy graphics might be expected to
get good reviews it is not always the case. A small 10k game might
get a better overall score than a 1Mb game. It is not that the 1Mb
game isn't any good it's just that the playablility might be non
exsistant and there is no point in downloading a huge file if it
will last a couple of minutes and you will only run it to show off
to friends.

 Probably the smallest program I'm ever going to review at under 2k,
HTML2TEXT is a simple program which takes a piece of HTML code, as used
in web pages, and outputs standard text files. This is useful if you
need the actual text information from a web page, and as all the web
browsers cache the pages as you browse, you can easily strip the HTML
tags using this program, and use the text as you wish. Such a small
program only requires a small review, and as HTML2TEXT is small, and it
works quickly and with no fuss, so this review will be quick, and with
no fuss. I couldn't find any bugs, so a big hand to Lithium/Gods for a
small but useful program.

 Kewlpage is as you may have guessed a pager door for Maxs. The cosmetics
of Kewlpage are fantastic, the program comes supplied with pager screen,
answer, busy. etc.. and all of them look great. The reason must be over
7 letters long otherwise the user will be returned to the start saying
that it was not a good enough reason.

 In the configuration you have about 12 different options which enclued
things like what sample or mod you want played while paging, what chat
program to run after paging, what answer options you want. etc.. You
can either choose a GUI or onscreen keys for the answer options, the
GUI is much better but it means clicking to the WB screen to choose
either (A)nswer, (B)usy or (C)ancel. If you do not want to answer the
pager you can enter a message and then let the pager run out it will
then display the message to the user.

 There is not enough room here to go into all the functions and options
but overall this pager is pretty good.

@{b} YaanChat V1.25@{ub}

 Yaanchat is a chatter program for Maxs based along the lines of Maxchat
but with alot more options.

 Firstly Yaanchat looks better than Maxchat because it is more uptodate
with a good looking screen it also has many options that sysops will
find very useful while chatting to a user. Once YaanChat is run, normally
after a pager program like Kewlpage it brings up the two-way split chat
screen much the same as the Maxchat layout it also brings up a button
bank which sits at the bottom of the screen.

 On the button bank you have Raw upload which is used for the sysop to
select a file to send to the user without having to go to the files
menu, next is Raw download this is used for a user to send a file direct
to you while in chat. There are also 4 different styles of writing,
first is normal then tagged then elite and then Jonathen Woss mode.
There are also other options encluding Freeze and Defreeze time which
can stop the users time running out while chatting to you.

 Overall this program is great for sysops as it takes the hassle out
of sending files direct. A great piece of programming!!!

@node "ur3" "OPTYCDPlayer"

@{fg shine} OPTYCDPlayer 2.0@{fg text}

 Looking around the Aminet the other day, I decided to investigate the
new batch of audio cd players available. I personally still use
MCDPlayer, which is included in the AmiCDFS archive, and find it a
small, friendly player, which fits my needs perfectly. Optycdplayer,
is an MUI application, which brings with it all the pros and cons of
this piece of software. Many Amiga applications now use MUI, and I
assume that most of you will know about these pros and cons, so I
won't go into them again! At first glance, Optycdplayer's screen seemed
very "busy", almost cluttered, and whilst moving from screen to screen
was quite fast, I felt that the GUI was still overly complicated. Maybe
this was due to the wealth of features which are available, but
sometimes small and beautiful wins! If you need to sample directly from
CD however, Optycdplayer comes into its own, able to convert samples
into many formats using AHI, and so, copyright restrictions apart, you
can then use these samples elsewhere. Programming the CD title and
track titles is also fairly swift, and these can be organised into a
database, of which 4000+ are included for you lazy people. After an
hours or so of playing, I felt more at ease with the GUI, and maybe
could get used to it, but I still felt that I would go back to my old
favourite MCDPlayer. If I was in need of ripping a sample direct from
CD however, then Optycdplayer would be my first choice, however dodgy
the legal implications are!

Overall then, a nice audio Cd player - perhaps a little overcomplicated
and a messy GUI!

@{fg shine} VirusZ V1.40@{fg text}

 It's a sad fact of life, that some people wish to ruin others hard work
by writing viruses. Thus it is essential that users upgrade and use
viruskillers! VirusZ V1.40 is the latest version of a succesful killer
that I've already been using for several months now, and it boasts an
impressive features list, and kills an equally impressive number of
nasty virii. Because I have a very large system, and due to the large
number of file virii about, one of the biggest requirements for me is
a good file virus checking capability, and VirusZ doesn't disapoint in
this important area. There are lots of options, and if you search for
a couple of additional libraries, then almost any files can be
recognised, decrunched, checked, and then recrunched again seamlessly
whilst you go and make yourself a cup of coffee (or in my case, watch
a film etc.). The GUI is small, and efficient, and really, VirusZ can
be left working away in the background, whilst you don't really know
that it's there!

 Whilst not updated quite as fast as some of the other killers about,
VirusZ seems to be the most stable, with less bugs being introduced
when it is updated. The only other problems I've experienced with this
excellent program, have been cleared up in this version, so I can now
recommend this program as an essential part of any serious Amiga users
worldwide! Although this might seem like a small review, this is only
because VirusZ really is that easy to use and understand!

 Utils are not marked on how good they are compared to other utils,

hard to review something like MUI and then when reviewing a program
like a WB clock say it wasn't up to the standard of MUI. This is why
it is not possible to have a Top Ten list for utils.

@{fg shine} Interview with Sadeness Software@{fg text}

 Yes, we've pulled it off again another Exclusive interview, this
time with exsiting publishers of onEscapee and Foundation, Sadeness
Software. Look out next month for an interview with Vulcan Software

@{b}CS:@{ub} - Chris Seward (Editor of AIO)
@{b}SS:@{ub} - Sadeness Software

CS : Please can you tell me a little about SAdENESS software and how it
     was started and set-up?

SS : We started about 4/5 years ago by starting an AGA user group,
     swapping and selling Public Domain software.  From there, we went
     on to specify in selling general public domain software.
     We worked on the AGA Experience Vol 1 CDROM for over 1 year.  Things
     went on from there.  We had a lot of help from PD Soft and Active
     Software.

CS : You have signed Foundation and OnEscapee, are you planning to stop
     there or will you be signing more games/utils?

SS : Yes, we will be trying to sign more games in the future, but at the
     moment we are happy with the 2 games which we have signed and have
     very high hopes for them.

CS : Can you tell me a little about Foundation, it's features, price
     and when it is expected to be released?

SS : By looking at the screenshots, you would instantly think, Settlers,
     but you would be wrong.  It's a mixture of Settlers, C&C, Warcraft
     and Mega Lo Mania.  It has all the elements of Settlers, fighting
     elements of Warcraft, control methods of C&C, inventory elements of
     Mega lo Mania and lots of other new features such as sea trading,
     hot air balloons for arial attacks etc.
     The release date will hopefully be before christmas, it will retail
     at 29.95 gbp

CS : Can you tell me a little about OnEscapee, it's features, price
     and when it is expected to be released?

SS : onEscapee is a mixture of Another World and Flashback, bigger
     graphics, more effects, loads of action and logic puzzles.
     Again, this will be retailed at 29.95 gbp and will be released late
     November, early December.

CS : If a programmer that is reading this issue of AIO has a game they
     think you may be interested in releasing can they contact you and
     how would they go about doing so?

SS : Sure, but it would need to be good :)  We have had people send us
     PD/Shareware games, which are basically a waste of their time and
     ours.  We are after top quality products not quantity.
     What they would need to do is either send demos via email or snail
     mail. Once we have evaluated it, we will go on from there.

CS : If any, what other games have you signed?

SS : None, so far, we have been in negotiations with a couple of other
     developers, but nothing as yet has been finalised.

CS : Can we expect to see demos of OnEscapee and Foundation soon and
     how will they be released?

SS : Indeed, there is infact a demo of onEscapee available on the Aminet,
     but a 50meg demo will be released soon on all magazine CDROMs.

CS : Releasing OnEscapee and Foundation has gained you big press but
     what other products do you sell for people who don't know?

SS : We have released our own products, which include the AGA Experience
     Vol 1, 2 and 3, the Hidden Truth and Utilities Experience which have
     all received great reviews and awards.  We also distribute other
     CDROM games and Public Domain CDROMs.

CS : What do you think of the current Amiga situation and can you
     continue to be profitable on the Amiga platform?

SS : At the moment things aren't too good, the interest in our latest
     games has been good but until they are released we just have to bite
     our lip.

CS : Would you consider a conversion of Foundation or OnEscapee to the
     PC or consoles?

SS : There is a PC conversion of onEscapee in production, and there should
     be a conversion of Foundation started soon, but that has to be
     converted into C first.

CS : What specs would you like to see in a future Amiga OS and future
     Amigas?

SS : I would like an updated workbench, more like Opus.  The new Amigas,
     I hope will come with a better graphics chip than AGA, graphics cards
     would be nice as standard.  It would be nice to see PPC and 3D chip.
     Unless the the new Amigas comes with at least PPC, hard drive,
     graphics card, 10meg and CDROM Drive as standard, then there will
     not be much hope for the future of Amiga.

CS : Thanks for your time!

SS : No problem.

Title: thesite: Amiga Fans Rejoice: New Machines, OS On The Way

Amiga Fans Rejoice: New Machines, OS On The Way

Gateway 2000 bought the rights to the Amiga brand and its patents in a 
German bankruptcy court in March, leading to feverish speculation among
the groundbreaking graphics computer's small but devoted core of users.
The South Dakota PC giant operates Amiga, Inc. as a separate division,
but until now it has kept mum about its plans for Amiga.

At a users' group meeting in Omaha on Sept. 16, Amiga Inc. public 
relations and events coordinator Darreck Lisle said the new base model 
Amiga, running the Amiga0S 4.0, should be about $1,000 cheaper than
current Amiga 4000 models, and could include features like support for 
industry-standard graphics cards, universal serial bus ports and the 
built-in ability to run several operating systems.

Lisle also discussed the directions that Amiga research and development
staff is taking. He speculated that consumer electronics, which includes 
everything from palmtop PDAs to home security systems to Gateway's
existing line of Destination PC/TV combos, would be a huge market for a 
small, stable operating system like the AmigaOS. He also envisioned both
a full desktop system and a plugin card for "industry-standard" computers
running other operating systems.

Lisle said almost 400 companies asked for developers' licenses in the 
week following the users' group meeting at which he revealed his plans 
for the platform. He promised users and developers the new OS will come
out six months after he can assemble a full staff.

Lisle noted that no former Commodore Amiga employee has turned down his
offers of employment; even those not willing to leave their present jobs
agreed to do contract work. He also said that a new vice president should
be announced "soon."

The Amiga, originally developed as a possible game platform, became the
desktop leader in graphics, animation, 3D and video editing. It's still 
in commercial use as a cheap alternative to SGI rendering engines and
Avid digital video editing systems. No reliable estimate on the size of 
the Amiga community is available, but Lisle said, "I've heard everything
from 10 million to 100,000 [users]."

The Amiga survived the 1994 bankruptcy of parent company Commodore, the
1996 bankruptcy of new owner (and, like Gateway, a PC clone maker) Escom
and failed bids by VisCorp in 1996 and QuikPak in 1997.

Title: AUoH Meeting Highlights - September 16, 1997

AUoH Meeting Highlights - September 16, 1997

Special Guest!!

Darreck Lisle, Public Relations and Events Coordinator for Amiga, Inc., 
was present at the September meeting. See below for full details.

Attendance

This month, the turnout was anywhere between 20 and 30 people. An exact 
count was difficult as there was a lot of activity going on. At times 
I counted 24, 26 and 27 people present, but people were always coming in
and out.

Newsletters

Newsletters were brought for sale at the meeting. One subscription was
renewed for 12 months. Back issues were given away to reduce the amount
of stuff I need to carry in my briefcase. A donation of $10 was made to 
the club.

Topics

Normally, news is the first item of the meeting. However, this was not
a normal meeting.

The room opened up at a remarkably early 6:30. Many people started setting
up tables and chairs and started bringing in equipment for the semi-annual
swap meet at this time.

A lot of swap meet browsing was already going on by the time Mr. Lisle
arrived, approximately 7:15pm. He went around the room and chatted with 
many interested Amiga users until 7:45pm when he started his discussion.

Before the discussion started, there were four or five Amiga systems on 
the demonstration tables. Two were receiving AmigaOS 3.1 upgrades as the
club meeting is the only time some users receive support. There was 
already a lot of merchandise and money trading hands by this time.

Keynote Speech by Darreck Lisle

Mr. Lisle started off by telling the club how he got his job at Amiga,
Inc. Basically, he got the job by continually offering his services 
until Gateway 2000 finally gave in.

He stated he has an Amiga 1200 on his desk for work purposes, and an 
Amiga 4000T for home use. The A4000T at home has an 060 card, a Catweasel
controller with two HD floppies, and additional expansion equipment.

He also talked about why we haven't heard any press releases from Amiga,
Inc. License disputes and liquidator disputes need to be resolved before
a press release can be approved. The Vice President hiring process is 
nearing completion, so barring any further delays, we should be hearing 
a press release soon.

Darreck then went on to talk about Amiga, Inc.'s approach to marketing. 
Open licensing will be utilized to speed up development while Amiga, Inc.
completes its start-up cycle. One application for this open licensing 
could be in the area of Consumer Electronics where a small, highly-stable
OS is critical. Some applications he speculated on include a palmtop
Amiga, an Amiga-based security system, Amiga-based smart homes and Amiga-
based cable TV boxes. A comment was made how it would be bad for the 
system running your house to crash because you would have to reboot your
house.

Companies are coming to Amiga, Inc. with requests to receive licenses so
they may pursue development on Amiga-based consumer electronics 
applications. It is Darreck's opinion that Amiga has a bright future 
because Amiga International and Amiga, Inc. are starting a cycle of slowly
gaining momentum which will build in the upcoming months.

Another possible use of the Amiga technology may be into the existing
Gateway Destination market. This technology incorporates a TV into the 
computer so regular TV viewing is done on a 31" screen, but as a task 
on the computer. The current use of PCs for this task has led to many
families having to reboot their TV often due to crashes.

Cooperation with third-party developers is also a priority as they are
the driving force behind research and development at the present time.

Darreck also said that he thinks the time frame for the release of AmigaOS
3.5 will be sometime within the next six months. AmigaOS 4.0 should be
available before this time next year. AmigaOS 3.5 will use the existing 
3.1 ROMs.

Amiga, Inc. is currently trying to collect all pertinent Amiga archives 
and technology. They are also attempting to assemble a comprehensive Amiga
library of Amiga books, service manuals, technical manuals, and any other
writings pertinent to the Amiga's technology.

Amiga International is the marketing arm of Amiga and is based in Germany.
Amiga, Inc. is the R&D arm of Amiga and is based in North Sioux City, 
South Dakota.

Interaction with user groups is moving along. A user group network is in
the works. (Editor's note: Just today I received an email from an Amiga
user group coordination effort. They plan on compiling information on all 
Amiga user group meetings and asking Amiga resellers to include a flyer 
with each package shipped.)

The purpose of the Developer Network is to assemble and motivate 
developers. The Amiga, Inc. sponsored Developer Network should be getting
underway sometime around March or April of 1998. Backward compatibility 
to 3.0, 2.0 and 1.3 (if possible) is a priority for new software, as is 
standardization on a set of issues. Autoconfiguration and plug-and-play
software is also a priority.

Question and Answer Session

The Q's and A's are not word-for-word, but are taken from my notes.

One of the people who had just purchased AmigaOS 3.1 (it was being 
installed during the club meeting) asked the following:

Q: Should we buy AmigaOS 3.1?
A: Yes--you will need the ROMs for the updated AmigaOS anyway.

Q: Is Amiga, Inc. interested in the educational software market?
A: Yes--we feel the Amiga is ideally suited to educational uses.

Q: Is graphics card compatibility going to be built into the next OS 
   release?
A: Yes--some type of RTG standard should be included as well as an
   AHI-type of standard.

Q: How long should we expect to wait before we see new systems?
A: Probably around a year.

Q: How many old Commodore employees are working for Amiga, Inc.?
A: A rough estimate would be around 15 to 20. However, no former 
   Commodore employee has turned us down and has said they will 
   contract out to Amiga, Inc. if necessary to keep their present
   positions.

Q: Are there any other enhancements to the Amiga you foresee?
A: Possibly support for the Universal Serial Bus (USB).

Q: Do you know how much Gateway 2000 bought the Amiga for?
A: I wish I did, but I have no clue.

Q: What is Amiga, Inc.'s position on UAE, the Amiga emulator available 
   for Microsoft and UNIX?
A: The current practice of pirating Amiga ROMs will be cracked down on
   shortly.

Q: Will Amiga, Inc. use UAE to sway Microsoft and UNIX users to the 
   Amiga?
A: Probably not--the speed of the emulation on even the fastest 
   Pentiums is only roughly equivalent to an unexpanded Amiga 500.

Q: What does Amiga, Inc. think about Java?
A: We would like to see Java in the next OS, but there is still a lot to
   be done in this area.

Q: Is Amiga, Inc. considering a "Power Up" style program like they had 
   when the A3000 was released?
A: That will most likely fall into the hands of the licensed Amiga-
   compatible makers to decide, but there are many uses for older Amiga 
   systems. For instance, many technical schools modify Amiga systems for
   test equipment. Also, many cable channels use Amigas for the Prevue 
   Guide and also Public Service stations.

Q: Are we going to see any of the current operating system hacks, such as
   MUI, built into a future AmigaOS?
A: Possibly--however, MUI is too large and bulky to consider making it an
   integral part of the OS. A TCP stack is a definite possibility, 
   though. Using Shareware and Public Domain OS software which is
   currently available is probably not an option, because programmers of 
   competing software may claim Amiga, Inc. is showing favoritism by their
   choices. For instance, Amiga, Inc. currently buys most of its test 
   equipment from many different Amiga mail-order houses for this very 
   reason.

Q: Will the prices of existing systems be dropped, like say $1000 off the
   existing A4000T prices?
A: Yes--Amiga motherboards are quite simple in design so cost should 
   reduce, especially after improvements are made to the current design,
   such as optimization of the existing custom chip set. Today's 
   technology allows chip makers to reduce the size of the Amiga's custom
   chips.

Q: Is Amiga, Inc. investigating the possibility of giving the Amiga the
   ability to run software written for other OSes?
A: Yes--I believe there is some work involving making the Amiga a multi-
   platform machine. There is also the possibility of an Amiga-on-a-card
   which would effectively take over the processing of an industry-
   standard system making it essentially an Amiga.

Q: Has Amiga, Inc. discovered a lot of reverse engineering of the Amiga
   technology?
A: Yes--especially overseas.

Q: Will Amiga, Inc. be coordinating with third parties?
A: Yes--that is one of the main goals of Amiga, Inc.

Intermission

During intermission, more swapping was going on, people engaged in 
one-on-one conversations with Mr. Lisle, and the restrooms were visited
by many.

Demos

Wyatt Drew and Michael Groshart demonstrated AsimCDFS, I believe. I was
barraged by questions and people looking to buy some of the remaining 
Amicom inventory, so I was unable to observe for a full report.

Darreck said his goodbyes around 9:00 as he had to be up for a 7:00am
appointment, and he had two hours of driving ahead of him.

The meeting was still going strong when I packed up at 9:15, so I'm not
sure how late it ran.

Here is the schedule for the rest of the year.

Exec Meeting: Oct 7
Club Meeting: Oct 21

@node "fe3" "It's down to us"

@{fg shine} It's down to us to save the Amiga@{fg text}

 I've decided to put pen to paper, or words to screen in this case and
get my views across to all you thousands of AIO readers :) For you not
interested in this subject i'll let you into what it's about. This
text is about us saving the AMiGA and how it is down to us so if you
don't want to listen go somewhere else, i'm not forcing you to read
this!

 The AMiGA, the best computer to millions all over the world had survived
for over 10 years but it has not survived this long by BIG companys 
producing thing for the Amiga and supporting it, it is down to us the 
users of the AMiGA that have saved it upto now and can continue to keep 
it alive as long as we support it. For about 3 or 4 years now no big
company has _really_ owned the Amiga or done anything to keep it going,
if us the user was not so supportive of the Amiga it would have died
years ago. So for that I thank all Amiga users for staying with the
Amiga, but we need to keep this support going, we need to register
shareware programs that we use regularly, we need to boast the powers
of the Amiga to the rest of the world and most of all we need to support
Amiga, Inc and any developers in the Amiga world that have the power
to change or keep things going. 

 Programmers mostly program for the fun of it and they program something
that is of use to them, but noone likes to upload a file and freely 
distribute their hard work and get no response or funds back from it. 
People moan on about registrations being to high, but think of all the
hard work and effort that the developer has put in, think of his
electricity bill and think of all the time he has spent producing that
product so you can use, when to be honest he could of said, "i'd
rather go out with my mates down the pub" or do something more 
interesting than sit in front of his computer for hours, days, months
and even years on end. Even if you can't afford registration or even
if the author doesn't ask for any payment, an email of gratitude or
letting the author know what you liked or disliked about the program
makes his or her job so much more fun to do.

 The day users stop supporting the Amiga and think that we can leave 
it up to companys is the day that the Amiga DIES. It would be a great
shame to waste what we have just because other mindless computer
users disagree with are computer. Stick with me and make the Amiga
live on. In 1 year Gateway 2000 say that new Amigas will be out so
think that if we can just hold on that long we will have a new
machine which will be 10 times more powerful and attract all those
other computer users back to the glory days of the Amiga, the main
home and even work computer.

 All letters can be emailed to : Cool@Dcandy.demon.co.uk on this
subject.

@node "fe4" "Domination Web Page" 

@{fg shine} Domination - A Game in the Making@{fg text}

@{b}The Domination homepage@{ub}

Domination is the exciting new game currently in development by 
Rammasters. The game was first invented by Mark Thomas in Summer '96. 
The game is still being worked upon now.

@{b}Our Hopes for Domination@{ub}

Domination is a space command game set in the 23rd Century. You command
various fleets of ships with which to build up your command of the
galaxy. You will be stopped in your tracks by various life forms of such
have never been encountered before by the human race. There is no set 
mission. You have the choice of playing against another player (serial 
link) or on your own, either to build up your forces for the two player 
game or just to reach a set target (making a lot of money, wiping the
galaxy clean of alien races or just to boldy go where no-one has gone 
before! :). The two player mode is the best way to fully appreciate 
Domination. You cannot see your opponent's fleets or command ships 
unless you actually find them or s/he announces them to you (sub-space 
transmission). You can wage war, set up trade routes or even form an
alliance (possibly to explore the galaxy together).

With over 200 possible events, including the invention of new, prototype
ships and improvements in existing technology, Domination grows as you
progress. You can even control the development of these technologies as
you divert funding into different areas of research.

@{b}Gaming Features@{ub}

A Workbench-like user interface, employing draggable screens for each of
the many functions, and easy-to-use iconic displays makes Domination a 
dream to play. Up to 96 different ships in twelve different classes, as 
well as space stations and command ships allow.

@{b}System Requirements@{ub}

The completed version is aimed to work on any 2MB Amiga (there may be
complications on the original A500). A fast computer would product 
smoother movements of objects in the game but it is not compulsory. A 
Hard Disk is recommended.

@{b}Progress@{ub}

While most of the game mechanism has been completed, must of the data is
still waiting to be input, and several screens are to be completed. Many
of the events have to be coded and the whole shebang has to be tested. 
There are currently over 6,400 lines of coding, and we're less than 50% 
through!

[Progress Bar (46%)]

@{b}Created using AmosPro@{ub}

However, this means that we need the AmosPro compiler. If anyone can 
compile it for us (you'll get a free copy of the game!) then e-mail or
write to us at the address below.

@{b}Want To Lend A Hand?@{ub}

We need some help with the creation of Domination. For more details,
email us.

For more details, watch this space!

To comment, send your e-mails to: dom@amiga1.demon.co.uk

Age: 15 years 11 months 4 days (just cant wait to be 16!!)

Comments: Jamie is the main programmer. In fact, if it was not for his
motivation, Domination would have been left to die within three days of
the project commencing!! He has also designed many of the ships, his 
favourite so far being the Omega IV Transporter (which can be seen 
attacking the Vaca V Battle ship on the main page, even though it is 
heavily outweighed in both weaponry and armour. Either brave or stupid! 
:).

@node "fe5" "Upgrade Kickstart chips"

@{fg shine} Upgrade Kickstart chips from 3.0 to 3.1@{fg text}

@{b}The Product@{ub}

Kickstart 3.1 ROMs for Amiga 1200.
Price £29.95 plus £2.50 delivery charge.

@{b}NB:@{ub} There are different versions for older Amigas.

Workbench 3.1 was copied from CU Amiga CD No.15.

@{b}Supplier@{ub}

Tel 01234 851500
Fax 01234 855400

@{b}Installation
------------@{ub}

@{b}1. Installing the chips.@{ub}


  I received two ROMs provided in a small black box delivered in a
well packed box with two sheets of instructions.

  First I made a backup of my Workbench partition using Quarterback onto
a ZIP disk. I also took the opportunity to backup the ROM itself using
the GrabKick utility to a file. It may be come in handy for softkicking
for certain situations.

  After reading the instructions provided by Power Computing, I switched
off my Amiga and removed all the peripherals and cable from the back the
A1200.

  Now since most IC (or chips) can be damaged by static, I earthed myself
on the nearest radiator. I then turned the computer upside down and
removed the screws which held the top half of the computer. I turned the
computer the right way up and lifted off the cover.

  Underneath the keyboard, in the middle of the shielding are two well
exposed chips. These are the kickstart v39 ROM chips. I wrote down the
position and orientation of the chips and which chip was located in which
socket (two different numbers were on each chip. The one above was
numbered 1044 and the one below was 1043). The orientation is determined
by a little notch on the left edge of each chip. This notch was located on
the left side of the chip (NB: do not go by the writing on the chip).

  To give me more room I removed the keyboard and carefully disconnected
the keyboard ribbon near the back of the Amiga.

  I used a small flat bed screwdriver to slowly lift the old ROM chips
out. The best way to do this is to lever alternately from each side. Once
these chips were removed I placed them in a handy black IC bag for safe
keeping.

  The new ROM chips have to placed in a certain way on the motherboard.
They are labeled as U6B and U6A. The U6B goes into the top socket and the
U6A in the bottom socket. Also, there are more holes on the ROM sockets
than there are legs on the ROM chips. The ROMs must go into the right
most sockets leaving 2 holes on the left hand side. The notch must also
match the orientation of the old sockets. In my case the notches should
appear on the left side.

 I discovered that the legs of the ROM chips were too far apart for them
to fit properly in the sockets. I carefully, pressed each side of the ROM
legs on the metal shielding so eventually they are just narrowed enough
for them to fit into the sockets. I repeated this for the second ROM. I
them carefully pressed them into the sockets so that they clicked into
place. I then reconnected the keyboard and replaced the top cover but did
not screw it into place. I reconnected the mouse and monitor and the
power and switched on. It booted first time! Running the VERSION command
gave me a V40.68 kick start ROM!

  The Amiga was screwed back together and all the peripherals were
reattached for the next part of the installation - Workbench 3.1.

@{b}2. Installing the software@{ub}

  Although I opted to get the ROM chip only, some people may have got the
full Kickstart/Workbench package. This may be better for some people as
it has the full software collection.

  I had earlier made myself a Workbench 3.1 disk set using the software
available from the CUCDs. The majority of the Workbench libraries, devices
and utilities are available here (see Libs, S, L, Devs, Classes, Tools,
System and Utilities). Since WB3.1 is not much different from 3.0 I knew
what I was looking for. The most important files are the v40 libraries.
Not all the libraries are updated but the main ones to look for are:

 amigaguide, asl, commodities, datatypes, iffparse, locale, lowlevel,
 nonvolatile, realtime, version and workbench.


Most sure you backup important files such as the startup-sequence and
any DOSDrivers (esp. CD0) incase they get overwritten by WB3.1's versions.
I copied the Workbench, Extras disks only as they had the most changes,
to my system disk.

I rebooted my Amiga and discovered a couple of problems:

1. I had my startup-sequence overwritten (I was using my CD boot script
before). I recovered this from a backup copy off my Zappo disks.

2. There was a problem loading my Workbench background pattern as it
did not recognise the datatypes library. Replacing the library with a v39
temporarily solved the problem.

   I asked someone via the Pure-Amiga mailing list and discovered that my
startup-sequence requires an extra line to recognise the new v40 datatype
s:

C:ADDDATATYPES REFRESH

once this was added and the v40 datatypes library reinstalled I got it
working again. Finally, one more thing. Workbench 3.1 CLI programs do
have their pure bits set, so you should download Fix_WB1.3.lha from
Aminet to fix the missing bits for various programs.

I now have a fully functional WB 3.1 Amiga.


@{b}Conclusion@{ub}

  This is the only OS upgrade I have performed on my machine besides
adding third party software to make it more up to date. I found it very
easy to follow and as long as you double-check your work before switching
on it should be trouble free.
  I do recommend you to upgrade to WB 3.1 for several reasons. First you
will now get a more stable and faster Amiga as WB 3.1 has loads of bug
fixes and speed ups since 3.0. KS 3.1 has a feature to allow some hard
disks to spin up before booting. Also, you can now use some of the more
recent hardware drivers such as the v43/44 FFS and Picasso software
drivers.
  Upgrading to 3.1 will also prepare you for the next round of OS upgrades
which will be software onlu ie WB 3.5 which Amiga Intl will be releasing
within the next six months. Of course you could get the ROMs and software
together when it released and may save some money.

@{fg shine} Info on BBS and software@{fg text}

Bulletin Board Systems (BBS's) provide a huge amount of info
about just about everything computer related.  Okay so maybe not
as much as the world wide web, but lets face it, how many
internet providers do you know that don't charge a subscription
??
	Just about all BBS's are free of charge, apart from phone
costs of course, so if you can find a local BBS you would be
better off using it.  This month we have all the information you 
will need to set up Ncomm, a terminal emulation package to use
BBS's.
	BBS's use a system called ANSI, which are coloured IBM
characters, the style of drawing on most BBS's differ.  Most
BBS's have their own "theme", and then you get the odd few that
have the setup that comes with the bbs software.. and more often 
than not look crap :(  Most BBS's offer a variety of files
available for download (transfer to your computer), and some have 
what is called a file ratio, e.g. 5:1, which means that for every
5 files you download you have to give one.
	Some BBS's offer fidonet type mail systems on which you can
read/write messages to people all over the country, sometimes 
even to other countries depending on the size of the mail net.

	The first thing you need to obtain is a copy of a terminal 
emulation package such as Ncomm. Unfortunately it hasn't been
included with the magazine because of space limitations, your 
best bet is the aminet or a PD library.  Once you have a copy, 
and have it installed, load it up and follow the instructions
below for configuring it.

Quick Setup

Nothing under the System menu really needs to be set up, Log 
Calls logs all the calls you have made (with the telephone number
and time online).  This can be useful to keep track of your phone 
bill, a friend of mine once had to sell all his computer
equipment to pay off his phone bill, don't let this put you off
though, as long as it is kept under tabs you shouldn't end up 
with a massive phone bill.

The next two menus are the most important.

Transfer Menu:

Options - Turn on Chop files, Zmodem AutoUL, Zmodem AutoDl and 
Transfer bar.

Default directory - Select upload, then you will get a requester
in which you choose the directory you wish to send files from 
(this can however be changed at the start of the upload, it is
just the directory it will open initially).
	Then Select download and you will get another requester in 
which you should choose the directory you wish to store files you
receive in, preferably NOT a floppy disk.

Protocol - Zmodem should be selected.

Com Menu:

Baud Rate - This depends on the speed of modem you are using, 
below are what you should use for different speeds of modem:

	Modem Speed	Baud Rate

	9600	9600
	19200	19200
	14400	38400
	28800	38400
	33600	38400

Note: For the last two types of modem you may be able to use
57600, however some A1200's will not function correctly at this 
speed.

Data Length - 8 bits
Parity - None
Stop Bits - 1 bit
Duplex - Full
Handshaking - RTS/CTS (this is sometimes referred to as 7 wire 
handshaking)

Providing you are using your Amiga's built in serial port, this
is all that requires altering under this menu, however if you are
using another port, e.g. Surf Squirrel, Port Plus etc.
Select Set Device, and you will get a box to enter the device
name in (this is case sensitive).

Emulation menu:

End of line - The following should be selected
	TX EOL = CR
	RX EOL = CR

Character Set - This should be set to IBM

Screen menu:

Most of the options under this menu are purely preferential and 
will not affect the operation of Ncomm.

Phone menu:

Modem setup - To configure this you will have to refer to your
modem manual, or perhaps manufacturer.

For more in-depth information about any of these menus you should 
take a look at the instructions that come with Ncomm.

Everything should now be ready for you to use now, so save your
config (Save Config, under the System Menu), and select Phone 
book from the phone menu.  You are now in the position to add new
numbers to the phone book by pressing New.

When this is done a window containing the following text boxes 
will open:

Name	Name of the BBS System  	Backwoods BBS
Phone #	Telephone number of the system 	01463 870022
Comment	A comment (not a necessity)	Excellent


There are several others between these, but none of them should
be of any concern at the moment.

User Name	The user name you use on the system	Luigi
Password	The password you chose	AS IF :)


None of the selections below this should be altered, they are all
set from the ncomm.config.

Now select Ok, and then Save.

Now pull down the Dial menu (very end one) and select the BBS 
Name, ncomm will proceed to dial the one you choose.

Now that you have everything working and ready to call a BBS, 
here is a list of bulletin board systems you should take a look
at.


	Name	Number	Hours	Speed
	
	Backwoods BBS	01463 870022	W/E 2pm-Mid    33.6
			OTHER 9pm-Mid

	RedRum	01635 826720	24hrz   33.6
		01635 827203	24hrz   14.4

	Total Eclipse	01983 522428	24hrs  33.6

        Digital Candy BBS   01785 607207  24hrs  33.6

@{b}From@{ub} : Peter Gordon (the.moosuck@borghome.demon.co.uk)

Thanks for reviewing my 6k pacman game in issue 5, i would just like
to add a couple of points to what was said in the review. Firstly,
6k Pacman is available from the Aminet as well as from various BBS',
and it is also RTG friendly.

Keep up the good work with the magazine!

@{b}Ed@{ub} : Not a problem I was happy to review such a great game :) Thanks
for letting us know about the other features aswell.
(@{b}NOTE:@{ub} V1.1 of 6kPacman has been released since last issue)

@{b}From@{ub} : Junnu Naumanen (juneau@mail.freenet.hut.fi)

Argh! I think I've never been this furious...I am ofcourse referring to 
the Stuart Campbell's Digitizer thing. I have never read that much bs 
in one go, I just wish I had the money to fly over to UK and beat him 
senseless!
 Okay, I don't want to endorse violence but I hope Mr.Robertson-Turner's 
letter gets something done as it truly was outrageous...in Finland that 
kind of nonsense would give me the right to sue him for slander (or is it
libel?). 
 Anyway, I like your magazine a lot, as it is free, and I don't have the
money to buy even the two leading magazines, but I still like to read
about what's happening with Amiga. Keep up the good work.

@{b}Ed@{ub} : I totally agree with you and I also hope that Mr.Robertson-
Turners letter gets something done. I have read the so called computer
pages in England called Digitzer and it is full of childish remarks and
reviews look like they have been done by 5 year olds. Anyway thanks for
your letter and i'm glad you like the mag.
