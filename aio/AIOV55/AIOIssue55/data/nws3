The Windows cd32 emulator Akiko by Airsoft Softwair is now able to
emulate the mpeg module of the CD32. The speed is amazing as well as
the sound and video quality because all the cpu-intensive operations
are done by the x86 cpu. It was really hard work to implement this
feature but the result is really overwhelming. You can finally watch
the mpeg intros which were just skipped for users without an mpeg
module (e.g. Cannon Fodder). And of course the cool Commodore
commercial with the mad scientist and his assistent. I quickly made
some screenshots and uploaded them to the Akiko product page.

I hope that the mpeg module emulation will be ready for the next
version of Akiko (of course only for the full version!). Another nice
thing is that finally Microcosm works with Akiko and you haven't
livedif you did not see this game! The next version of Akiko will be
ready in near futureand it will contain NV ram emulation and real
Joypad emulation for sure. So check back this homepage from time to
time because the winter is anything else than cold....Finally I want
to say "thank you" to the many registered users out there! Your
support makes Akiko better and better all the time! (ps)
