One of the beauty of Internet is the possibility to download old
games not available anymore for our miggy at the time of a click (if
you have a broadband connection).
{pp}
I am very pleased to see that many sites are making the effort of
contacting developers to ask permission to make old games freely
available for the public, and that has certainly kept Amiga alive in
the heart of all the people who are now PC owners using  Amiga
emulators.
{pp}
I was surfing the Internet few weeks ago when I came across one of
those websites. Its name is Amiga Arena, and even if its game
catalogue is not as complete as Back2TheRoots it has some little gems
that can still guarantee an hour or two of fun.

Blockhead is one of those game and was developed back in 1996 by
Applaud Software. It was a two man job and was created with the
famous programming language called AMOS. AMOS was a pretty advanced
language (at that time), similar to BASIC and mainly focused on the
creation of games. It gave the opportunity to any one with basic
programming skills to create games without resorting to the much more
difficult C or Assembler. What was really good about AMOS was the
specific instruction set dedicated to the AGA and PAULA chipset. But
lets go back to our game.

Blockhead is a variation of a theme that has been done several time
in the past. It is a puzzle game and as such, can be very addictive.
Indeed the graphics might no be not as attractive as any modern game,
but it manages do its job.

The game is available in an compressed archive and once unpacked it
is just over the size of a double density floppy disk. Being a pretty
old game it is incompatible with any graphics card. You will need one
of those old Amiga monitor (i.e. 1084) which can display the AGA PAL
lowres resolution. Apart that I did not have any problem in running
it, as long as I disabled VirusZ.

In the menu section you can select whether you wan to start a new
game, play the tutorial or exit to the dos. The tutorial is pretty
simple and it explains just the basics of the game. Once the game is
started you will be in control of Mr. Bertie who has the ability of
moving blocks and collect objects. Each level begins with a little
briefing section which explains your main task. You have a limited
amount of time to complete the level and open the exit door. The time
is represented by a big weight slowly coming down from the top right
of your screen. At the bottom of it, sits little Pete. Your job is to
make sure you push all the blocks in the same colour holes before
Pete get crushed. While the weight falls down it changes colour going
from yellow to silver, bronze and gold. Solving the level when the
weight is on yellow colour will give you the maximum amount of point.
On the silver, bronze and gold colour you only get a percentage of
the total score you could have earned. Finding hidden items and
collecting the various object on the screen, such as fruit and gems
will increase your score. The level of difficulty increases with the
later levels where you will have to deal with many obstacles like
ice, energy draining blocks, lightning emitting squares and much
more. Luckily there are stocks of dynamite available to blow away
some of the walls which block your movements. Also, life become much
easier once you manage to get hold of some of the bonuses available,
such as energy replenishments, ice skates and timer resets.

You begin each level with three lives. More are available during the
game. At some point you will be given a password code. Note it down
and use it the next time you play the game. Indeed, there is no way
to save your effort on disk and therefore you will crave for those
password codes which come handy if you do not want  to play the game
from the start.
{pp}
The graphics of this game (top view) is very, very basic and very
similar to other games developed by Applaud (i.e. DNA). They are
clear and nice for this sort of game but nothing to be excited about.
The movements of the character are only the basic left, right, up and
down. No diagonally movements are allowed. That is not a problem,
just remember to face the blocks you want to move if you want to
finish the game in time. Indeed, I have wasted precious seconds
because I was not able to move blocks due to Mr. Bertie facing the
wrong way. Annoyingly there are no sound effects available but only a
very simple music which I had to switch off after few minutes of
playing.
{pp}
Although Blockhead concept is similar to many other puzzle games I
have to admit that  Applauds additional ideas have enhanced the
gameplay considerably. The more advanced elements are introduced into
the game the further you progress, which keeps the gameplay and the
addictive factor intact. The way you play the game is using the trial
and error system. At times you have to repeat the same level more
than once in order to get the exit door open before the time reaches
its limit, but that has never made me give up. On the contrary, it
has pushed me to do better and improve my score. One of the thing I
liked was the possibility to exit the game and go back to workbench
without resetting the system. A novelty for those old games.
{pp}
If you are a lover of puzzle game than Blockhead is certainly for
you. There are tens of levels to entertain you and more ofthem
available in Blockhead 2. More of it in the next issue.
