Well, it's the dead of Winter where I am- which for California means
sunny skies and warm days but for a certain ex-Editor no doubt rain,
cold, and lots of bad stuff.  Well, that's why I live here.

Which, of course, has nothing to do with anything Amiga but I thought
it worth mentioning.  As far as Amiga, we're still waiting as
patiently as ever.  Delays, big buildings falling doiwn, unfinished
motherboards, it all adds up.  The one diffrence between now and past
would-be saviors is that at least the current crew is
{italic}working{noitalic} at it which mea ns it's theoretically just a
matter of time... assuming we {bold}have{nobold} such time.  Destiny
will wait only so long and right now Microsoft has enough in troubles
and enemies that it's the right time for somthing like a reborn AmigaOS
to strike.

Consider this just a reminder to the Powers That Be at Amiga.  We're
pulling for you guys, but the world still needs to see product and
soon.  The world likes dramatic tension, but it likes happy endings
even better.  Care to give us one?

A last note.  Take a look at the Letters section and our new Hot
Topic.
