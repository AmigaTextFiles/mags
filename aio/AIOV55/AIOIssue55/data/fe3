Freespace is finally available from H&P (Check the review in this
very issue to find out more about it).
{pp}
After testing the demo of the game I decided to get in touch with
Steffen Haueser, main coder and project manager of Freespace, to have
a little chat with him. Find out what happened to Soldier of Fortune.
Sin and Descent 2; see what surprises lie in store for Amiga gamers,
and find out more about QUAKE II for Amiga.
{pp}
 Vincenzo Morra - Hi Steffen, thank you for finding the time to do
this interview. Can you start by telling our readers something about
yourself?
{pp}
Steffen Haueser - Well, I am 30 years old, I live in south Germany
(near Stuttgart). My full time job is game developement/porting, like
it is for most of the people at Hyperion entertainment. Right now, in
my spare time I am porting Quake 2 Addons to the Amiga. I enjoy
reading quite a lot (no technical stuff, Fantasy and Science Fiction
books usually); sometimes I play role-playing games  such us AD&D and
Midgard and of course I play computer games in my freetime. Also I
like going to Cinema to watch mainly mainstream movies mostly.
{pp}
 V.M. - What Amiga do you own at the moment? Do you own any other
system (PC/ MAC, etc.)?
{pp}
S.H. - I own an Amiga 4000 with CyberstormPPC Card. Asides from the
Amiga I  also own a Mac. I do not own a PC (asides from an old
Pentium 1 laptop).
{pp}
 V.M. - So, what was your first Amiga and what made you buy one?
{pp}
S.H. - My first Amiga was an A500 (I had planned to get an Amiga
since A1000  days, but the A1000 was too expensive). In truth, I was
looking forward to the release of the Amiga system long time before
it got released.
{pp}
 V.M. - Tell us about your work experience with Amiga. What have you
developed so far?
{pp}
S.H. - Commercial titles would be (together with other people at
Hyperion  Entertainment) Heretic II, Descent FreeSpace and
(unreleased for Amiga due to bad performance on current Hardware)
Sin. Before I joined Hyperion Entertainment I worked - while still
studying Computer Sciences - on several Public Domain projects,
including ports of Doom II, Hexen (coded together with Thomas
Frieden), Heretic I and the SNES9x Emulator WarpSNES. Recently I have
been involved in the Quake 2 Amiga conversion and have also ported
several famous Quake 2 Addons (including ActionQuake and
WeaponFactory).
{pp}
 V.M. - Do you code for other systems (i.e. PC, MAC, etc.)?
{pp}
S.H. - Yes, I am working on a game for the Apple Macintosh. Sadly no
details  can be given at this time.
{pp}
 V.M. - How did you become involved with Freespace?
{pp}
S.H. - I was working on a port of Descent 2 when FreeSpace became the
next major title for Hyperion to be ported. Therefore I was
interested at once  in taking part in the Descent FreeSpace
developement. By the way, I never managed to finish Descent 2 due to
lack of time. Any interested programmers who want to finish the port
can get the source code from me.
{pp}
 V.M. - How many people were involved in the development of the game
and what was your role?
{pp}
S.H. - Asides from myself there were Mathias "Amidog" Roslund, Jarmo
Laakkonen and Thomas Frieden. I was both Project Manager and lead
programmer for the port of the game.
{pp}
 V.M. - How difficult was the Amiga porting?
{pp}
S.H. - There was a lot of x86 ASM code which needed to be converted.
This  probably was the biggest problem with this port. Additionally,
there were lots of Endian problems (x86 and PPC/68k CPUs are using an
exactly opposite Byteorder, so all loading-code and networking-code
needs special care). This was particularly problematic for the
Networking Code which in the end took me over 4 weeks to finish.
{pp}
 V.M. - I have recently played the demo of Freespace and I think it
is great! As I previously told you I have experienced a slow down of
the GUI in the pilot name section, where I get a very slow response
from the keyboard . I had the same problem with Payback. I am aware
it does not slow down the game but could you explain us what is the
cause of it?
{pp}
S.H. - The menu-system of the game does a complete screen-refresh
each frame at  640x480. It has also to be added that the Menu-Screen
is animated, which makes things even worse. For slower CPUs this is
just "too much". Luckily this problem only appears for the
Menu-Screen. Inside the actual game, during  the flying and shooting
time, there are absolutely no speed problems, not even on a slow CPU.
{pp}
 V.M. - What sort of speed we can expect on a PPC machine and 68K
machine with a Permedia or Voodoo 3 based card?
{pp}
S.H. - I never really measured the speed in fps. Actually I think the
whole fps-values are a bit overestimated. The question is: is the
game smooth and playable?  Not how much fps it makes. What I can tell
you is that it runs smoothly on both PPC and 68k systems with
Permedia or Voodoo 3.
{pp}
 V.M. - Few developers recently complained about lack of sales in the
Amiga market. What makes you keep developing for this machine?
{pp}
S.H. - There certainly is an emotional attachment. Obviously, in the
long run  this is not goin tpo be enough. I am doing my work for
Hyperion Entertainment as a full time job, and I can only continue to
develop Amiga titles if these titles sell.
{pp}
 V.M. - Do you think there is a future for AmigaOne as a game
machine?
{pp}
S.H. - It surely won't beat Windows or gaming consoles as the "most
selling gaming platform", but yes I believe there is a future for the
AmigaOne as a game machine. And we'll still have quite some nice
surprises for Amiga users who want games.
{pp}
 V.M. - You are stimulating my curiosity now. From what I have seen I
can say that Freespace is a very addictive game. Tell our readers
why, in your opinion,  they should buy it?
{pp}
S.H. - I think, most Amiga users like the space-combat genre. In my
opinion, FreeSpace is one of the best games of this genre ever
released, and on Amiga it is the best. If you like space-action games
then FreeSpace is the game for you! It has also to be said that for
people who like space-combat games there is no alternative on Amiga.
As far as I know both Phoenix and Lambda have been cancelled.
{pp}
 V.M. - What  are Hyperion plans for the future? Will there be any
support for the Classic Amiga?
{pp}
S.H. - Sure there will be. I cannot really tell much about our future
Amiga plans right now. But I can tell you that there will be future
Amiga titles from our Company (Would we do OS 4 if we would not
believe in a future for AmigaOS?).
{pp}
 V.M. - What game ports is Hyperion planning to do for the 2002/2003
(Amiga Classic and Amiga One)? Will Hyperion ever develop an original
game?
{pp}
S.H. - Asides from Quake 2 I cannot disclose much information right
now. There will be other titles. One additional title will be
released before summer, maybe even before spring. As to original
games a big problem about them is that they take a lot of
developement time. Also, the big companies (on the PC market) can
throw a lot of "manpower"  for new projects, something that smaller
company cannot afford to do. And if we would ever manage to develop a
"must have" title they might just gather a team of 20 people who will
bring out a "clone" of our game well before the release of the
original  version. Therefore, at least for now, there are no plans
for original games. I am interested in developoing originals for the
future, though.
{pp}
 V.M. - What has happened to Soldier of Fortune and Sin for Amiga? I
am aware those games use the Quake engine. Surely if we can run Quake
and Quake II on Amiga we can also run Sin and Soldier of Fortune?
{pp}
S.H. - Those games use a modified Quake 2 Engine. Sadly the current
Amiga hardware is way too slow for both games. But we have other
stuff in store that are not too slow on current machines. Once the
AmigaOne or the SharkPPC become available we can re-evaluate the
possibilities for these two games. I am sure they would run okay.
{pp}
 V.M. - Let's talk about Quake II. What can we expect from the Amiga
version (graphics, sound, speed, extra features, etc)? What is the
minimum set up needed to run the game?
{pp}
S.H. -The current version of Quake 2 (which the Frieden brothers and
myselves  have ported in a joined effort) is around 95% done. I can
give you some details about the game running on my own 180 MHz
PowerPC Machine. Using 3D Acceleration (I am using a Permedia 2 Based
Card) I can run Quake 2 decently in a resolution of 800x600. Software
Rendering runs fine as long as I use LowRes (512x384 might also be
okay but I have never tried it myselves). The game is using a 16 Bit
Display when the 3D Hardware Rendering is selected, just as in
Heretic II. The Software Renderer is using a 8 Bit Display though,
while Heretic II used a 16 Bit even when the Software Rendering was
selected. As you can understand, the result is that the Software
Renderer for Quake 2 is noticebly much faster compared with the
Software Renderer of Heretic II. Engine aside, the game is noticebly
faster than Heretic II but slower than Quake 1. Some of our
betatesters' first impression was that it runs like Quake 1. More
careful tests have revealed that it was, in fact, slower than Quake
I. So far I am convinced Quake 2 will run decently on all PowerPC
equipped Amigas. We also did compile a 68k version but I am not yet
convinced this will run fast enough (we will do tests on a 66 MHz 060
system, though). Sound will be supported by both AHI and Paula. The
game also supports CD Audio. Regarding the extra features well we
have a wide range of input controllers supported (Mouse - including
Mousewheel support -, Keyboard, CD32 Pad, PSX Port, PC Analog
Joysticks) and we have support for Quake 2 Modifications.
{pp}
 V.M. - Any idea when people will be able to download it? Will it
require the "paks" form the original ID game?
{pp}
S.H. - We will soon be able to tell people when the game will be
available. The original game from ID is required. Actually, we are
working on something and it looks like the original game will be
available for sale for all Amiga users who need it.
{pp}
 V.M. - Great! Will Amiga gamers be able to play mission packs for
Quake II?
{pp}
S.H. - This is an interesting question. Different to Quake 1 which
used a  special system-independent language called "QuakeC", Quake 2
Modifications (and Mission Paks) are actually real game executables.
They need to be ported, like the base game itselves, and the source
code is not always available. We took the effort to port around two
dozen of the most famous Quake 2 Addons over to the Amiga which will
be released together with our Quake 2 port. Those included are Action
Quake, Matrix Quake, Weapon Factory, HolyWars, Catch the Chicken,
UrbanDM, Fireteam and many more.
{pp}
 V.M. - I have read some where that Quake II code is a joy to convert
for Amiga . Is that true?
{pp}
S.H. - It has to be said that ID are very professional about the way
they code. Their code is very "clean". That does not mean that it is
without problems, though. You always have to see it in comparison
with other source codes. Hyperion Entertainment also has a lot of
experience with Quake 2 engine based ports. This was probably the
main reason why we were able to bring this game to Amiga in time
record. Then, don't forget that we already had MiniGL and a DLL
solution from previous ports.
{pp}
 V.M. - What are the main differences between the Quake 2 and Quake 1
engine? As gamer, If you had to choose between the two of them, which
one would you play with?
{pp}
S.H. - That is a difficult question. From the Level-Design I prefer
Quake 1 although the graphics in Quake 2 are much better. There is
also the issue of the Addons. Things like ActionQuake just do not
exist on Quake 1. On the other hand there are mission packs like
FantasyQuake and Team Fortress for Quake 1 which are not available
for Quake 2. I like both Games.
{pp}
 V.M. - Have you ever played Quake 2 on PC or Playstation 1?
{pp}
S.H. - I played Quake 2 on a Mac but not on a PC or Playstation.
{pp}
 V.M. - What do you think of Amiga Inc. strategies (Amiga DE and
AmigaOne)?
{pp}
S.H. - Despite the critics of some people I think the AmigaOne is the
right way to go. I have to admit I have never been involved with PDA
before, therefore I have not "played" with the AmigaDE yet.
{pp}
 V.M. - Will you be buying an AmigaOne?
{pp}
S.H. - Yes (a developer system), as soon as it is available.
{pp}
 V.M. - As a developer, do you honestly believe that it is possible
to bring Amiga back to its throne?
{pp}
S.H. - Depends on what you mean by "Throne". It surely won't beat the
sale figures of Windows, but I believe it will again have a stable
niche market. Right now we have a niche market, but not a stable one.
A market stable enough to have again a lot of fulltime developers.
{pp}
 V.M. - So, where would you like to see Amiga in the 2003?
{pp}
S.H. - Running on a G5 using OS 4.
{pp}
 V.M. - What is the latest music cd you have bought?
{pp}
S.H. - I think that was one of the "Mystera" series.
{pp}
 V.M. - What is the latest movie you have seen?
{pp}
S.H. - Lord of the Rings, of course
{pp}
 V.M. - Of course. What is the latest piece of software you have
bought for Amiga?
{pp}
S.H. - Well, as I get a lot of Amiga Software for free, this has been
a  while... and then it even was a game of the concurrence - Earth
2140 from e.p.i.c.
{pp}
 V.M. - What games do you like to play on Amiga?
{pp}
S.H. - My favourite games on the Amiga are Heretic II, Quake 1 and
(now) Quake 2.
{pp}
 V.M. - Do you own a game console? What games do you like in general?
{pp}
S.H. - I own a Sony Playstation. On the console I like mostly Role
Playing  Games. I liked the Final Fantasy Series. Better I liked Star
Ocean: 2nd Story and Breath of Fire IV, though.
{pp}
 V.M. - If you were allowed to keep only one piece of software for
your Amiga what would that be?
{pp}
S.H. - gcc of course. I could create all sorts of software with it.
{pp}
 V.M. - Thank you very much for your time Steffen.
{pp}
