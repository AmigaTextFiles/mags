On the AmigaOne mailing list, Bill Toner, responsible for development
of 2D/3D  AmigaOS drivers for ATI Radeon graphics boards, voices upon
miscelleanous questions  regarding support for these boards. The most
important spots:
{pp}
Support for the following versions of the operating system and
computer configurations: 
{pp}
Bill Toner (and a partner not named) are responsible for driver
development; Picasso96  and Warp3D drivers. Those drivers are about
to be released for AmigaOS 3.x and AmigaOS 4.x. 
{pp}
In any case the Prometheus PCI board will be supported under OS 3.x,
since Bill owns such a  board. Mediator support is being planned,
though Mediator 1200 boards will raise additional  efforts. According
to Bill, DCE did not respond to his request regarding Radeon drivers
about  one year ago, therefore he cannot talk about GRexx solutions,
yet.

{bold}Radeon versions supported{nobold}
{pp}
First the original Radeon chipset will be supported (RV100), later on
support for the newer  chipset RV200 will be added. Whichever the
different versions (32 or 64 MB video RAM,  additional chips for
special functions like TV in/out) would differ from the developers
point  of view, it may come that not every model will be supported,
due to the developers team cannot  purchase every Radeon board. The
PCI Radeon 32MB SDR, one AGP RV100, and one of the newer boards  with
RV200 chipset are planned to be supported at all events. If the
"All-In-Wonder" (highend  version with TV tuner, etc.) will be
supported (respectively all of it's features) was not  decided yet -
even though they aim at this. There will not be more detailed
information about  board models to be supported before the developers
will have an Amiga with AGP slot.
{pp}
{bold}Distribution and prices{nobold}
{pp}
Appearently the drivers will be sold bundled with an ATI graphcis
board, only. Those are  expected to work only with that board, they
will come bundled with. Bill expressly states,  that one should not
by an ATI graphics board right now.
{pp}
This step intends to decrease the number of piracy copied driver
versions. As an example  Bill states the low number of registered P96
users among the customers of Elbox. Further  on this would help the
Amiga developers to enhance their income a bit, since they will  not
only earn by selling their software, but also can book the difference
from purchase  price to silling price of the graphics board (which
otherwise a PC vendor would get).
{pp}
According to a careful estimation by Bill the packet ATI graphics
board plus Amiga driver  would cost 50 to 70 USD more than the
respective board would cost at the PC vendor's -  he hopes that the
additional charge will be no more than 50 USD if possible,  but
cannot say anything in detail about that, yet.
{pp}
The additonal charge contains:{p}
The costs of 2D and 3D drivers.  Support, which also has to be done
by the developers.  A commercial Picasso96 license.  Probably a
commercial Warp3D license.
{pp}
{bold}Release-Date{nobold}
{pp}
A initial driver release should not be expected along with the OS4.0
launch. Bill cannot  talk about detailed dates, yet.
