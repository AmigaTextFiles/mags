Are you one of those poeople that's watched enough television to know
every sitcom since the 50s by name?  Then this is the site for you, with
everything you'll ever want to know about every TV sitcom since 1950
through today.{p}
All the programs are listed alphabetically, with each entry giving a
list of recommended sites for that show as well as message boards across
the Internet.  Most of the ones listed are American sows, but they do 
have a special page just for Britcoms; you English out there will have
to be the judge of how complete {italic}that{noitalic} is.{p}
While they do list the theme songs for these shows, it's only as seen 
from the catalog listing of the CDs on which you vcan find them and how 
to buy them.  No problem, there nbeing so many other sites with such 
sound files.  They do have their own message boards, grouped by decade 
for easier perusal.  Rounding out this site are a few other things such as Guess The Sitcom
Character or Guess The Show not to mention where to buy them on tape and
how to watch them online.{p}
An amusing diversion for the true Couch Potato, which I suppose are the
original ancestors of all us 'Net Surfers.
