Disk Salvage Stuff:  DiskSalv is okay unless you have Hard Drivs
bigger than the 4 Gig limit, though I've found it useful to have
DiskSalv v2 around as well; it's older but still has the old
Validate button there which is handy to get the system to start
revalidation when it otherwise doesn't seem to want to.  For bigger
hard drives you can try either QuarterBack Tools or DiskMonTools.

The old CD not recognizing on bootup anymore?  Take it out, give it a
thorough cleaning, then pop it back  in again and see how well it does
then.  Might want to dust out the old floppies while you're at it.

Tired of the same old WB backdtrops then use something like RndBG in
your startup-seauence AND attach it to a hotkey.  At a single
keystroke you can change your backdrop pic to anything else you got on
that hard drive.

If you decide to upgrade to OS 3.5 or 3.9 then don't forget to turn
off all your hacks and make a clean boot, especially ones that hack
into existing system libraries.  It's often the case that some new fix
in an OS upgrade will make at least one of your hacks obsolete or bunp
into something ele.  Read those docs for any changes in the OS as well
as those Warnings you'll often find in the doc files for your system
hacks; they'll tell you what you need to know.
