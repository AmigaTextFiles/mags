With as much word processing as I do, the subject has often come up of
saving my files out in a format that those not blessed with an Amiga
for use can asily read. Unfortunately since I use a lot of stuff like
Bold, Italics, and the like, ASCII is far from a first choise.{p}
But what file format to use?  Word might be the first choise,
espoecially with the likes of Wordworth supporting it, but as much as
Microsoft would like us to think otherwise, Word is not used by
everyone out there and isn't even an industry standard.  What IS an
industry standard though is Rich Text Format, or RTF.  Clones use it,
MACs use it, and even some major Amiga wordprocessors support it.{p}
RTF supports all the usual Bold, Underline, double-underline, and Italics, as well as
Tab, text alignment, and even font selection, though this last presumes, of course,
that the specified font is present on your system with that same name.
 If you have some doubt that some feature you need to be ported in a
file is supoorted in your program's RTF filter or not then the
solution is simple; just creat a dummy file with a few lines that have
a sample of the feature, save it out as RTF then import that file
again into the program and see what survives.{p}
A note on Wordworth's RTF filter.  While it DOES support the font
rtf specifications, it has a glitch such that only if the rtf file is
not the first document opened will it put in the specified fonts, and then I think
only for Wordworth v7... sometimes.  Other features seem okay though.{p}
All in all though, RTF is good at supporting many common features and
is free of any proprietary restrictions.  Just a little tip for those
that don't yet know about RTF.{p}
Oh yes, almost forgot.  If you need to email an rtf file to someone
{bold}always{nobold} archive it first.  It seems that some of the rtf
codes duplicate some of the email ones and can mess up the file when
transmitted (I learned this from personal experience).
