Freespace, a fligh simulator developed by Volition and published by
Interplay was a game well received by the PC community and managed to
get good reviews across all the major game magazines at the time it
was published.
{pp}
Hyperion Entertainment - with Steffen Haeuser as captain - has worked
very hard to port this game to the Amiga community and, after a long
and painful waiting, I have finally got hold of the full final
version (revision 1.06) and put it through an intensive test to
verify if it can stand up the test of time.
{pp}
{bold}THE STORY{nobold}
The game takes place in the 14th year of the war between
the Terrans and the Vasudans, where both races had to put aside their
differences and give space to the technologically superior Shivans.
{pp}
An opening movie (displayed in low resolution on 1/2 screen) shows a
pilot flying his severely damaged ship in the Ross 128 system. He
screams and cries for help while trying  to get in touch with the
main installation. He mention unknown attackers; he talks about
destruction and death.   Then, suddenly, the unknown attackers with a
very large ship in command jump from behind. The attack on Ross 128
is great - far greater than anything the Galactic Terran Alliance
(GTA) has ever seen, and your job is to steal the Shivans technology
and their secrets.
{pp}
{bold}INSTALLATION{nobold}
The game comes in an convenient DVD case which contains
a registration card. If you want to receive the latest patches or
upgrades make sure you send it or register online. I believe Steffen
and his team are already taking note of all the problems and
incompatibilities few people are experiencing to prepare a new
revision. Don't get me wrong the game is fully working, but a handful
of people are experiencing weird crashes which Steffen is trying to
reproduce on his system. More of this later.
{pp}
According to Hyperion the game needs a PPC or a 68060 processor to
run with a graphics card and 64 MB of ram. Usually 3D games are very
demanding in terms of cpu power and memory. Fortunately Freespace
does not heavily rely on 3D graphics and can be run smoothly on a
minimum configuration. Also, this is the first Hyperion commercial
port that supports the 68060 processor. This, indeed, is good news
for all the owners of a 68K system which have not seen a good game in
years (apart Payback of course).
{pp}
On the cd there are also the latest versions of Warp3D and WarpOS
which are necessary to run the game. Make sure you install them if
you want to avoid problems. As bonus a demo of Heretic II, for the
few Amiga users who still have not bought it (what are you waiting
for?), is also available.
{pp}
Freespace  can be fully or partially installed and a partial
installation can take up to 429 MB of space on the hard drive. In my
installation I have left the cut scenes on the cd and it did not
cause any slow down. If you are a Punchinello (pc mouse adaptor)
owner make sure you disable the wheel mouse support which,
apparently, is cause of incompatibilities on some systems. Steffen
mentioned that this is not a bug in Freespace, but a problem of the
Punchinello driver. Indeed, this was also an issue with Heretic II
and I believe Elbox has been informed of this problem. Unfortunately,
nothing has been done so far to update the driver.
{pp}
Once installed the game can be launched using the Freespace Launch
GUI. So far all Hyperion games have the facility of a launch GUI
which is becoming a useful and elegant standard de facto. Through the
GUI it is possible to modify the settings, read the docs (readme
file), connect to the Hyperion website or quit the game. In my
version the installer failed to install the "readme" file and I had
to install it manually. The setting section in the GUI is very
detailed and it is possible to modify all the factors which control
the quality and the speed of the graphics. I advise you to refer to
the readme file for a detailed description of the GUI.

{bold}THE GAME{nobold}
It is now time to get your CV ready and apply for a job that
no men want to do. A job where leadership, combat skills and team
work are the basis needed to fill the vacancy. Ready?! So launch the
game, input your name and... make yourself a cup of tea. In fact the
process of inputing my name was one of the most painful operation I
have ever experienced with a game and it took me a full five minutes
just to write it. The system takes ages to recognize (when it does)
what key I am pressing and I spent a huge ammount of time playing
with the various keys and using backspace to delete the mistakes.
Thank God that is a process that only needed to be done once (unless
you decide to change your name every time you play the game).
According to Steffen the animated menu system of the game does a
complete screen refresh each frame at a resolution of 640x480 which
can be the cause of the problem. Inside the actual game, during  the
flying and shooting time, there are absolutely no speed problems, not
even on a slow CPU.
{pp}
If you have finished your cuppa it is time to go to the Hangar and
get ready to begin. There are different areas you can access, and
each one will take you to a different section of the game. Click on
the main computer and you can modify some of the game settings; get
in the room on the first or second floor and you can view the
available campaigns, weapons or ships. The option screen is so
detailed that it is virtually possible to change anything you like.
Just have a look at the list of keys needed to control the ship.
There is no way you could run this game on a console unless you were
provided with a keyboard. Virtually every key on the keyboard has a
function needed to play the game. For instance, there are 38 keys
just used for target control and communications. The best solution is
to have a print out of them so you can refer to it any time you need.
{pp}
{bold}LETS BEGIN{nobold}
 So, time to enter the ground floor room and get ready for
the first mission. Being a cadet you will have to go through an
intense training session. The difference between this game and any
other game is that the training sessions are not only there at the
beginning of the game, to get you used to the controls, but are very
much part of the whole experience and present throughout your all
career. You start with a three part training. An instructor will
guide you through all the different phases helping you to pass them
with full marks. Complete the initial training and it is time to
embark in your first mission. Succeed, and you will be awarded wings,
medals or ensigns, new ships and more powerful weapons. You will also
receive a much more in depth training that will transform you in the
most prepared pilot of the GTA.
{pp}
Freespace is not about choosing a ship, loading the weapons and
jumping in the universe to kill a few enemy. Freespace is a pure
adventure where you are in control of a team of people who rely on
you to complete the objectives without losing their lives. In each
mission you will be assigned a team of fighters. The communication
system will allow you to give them orders such as engage in combat,
destroy your target, cover you, protect your target and much, much
more. The game is so detailed that it is possible to destroy the
weapons system or the engine of an enemy ship leaving the rest of the
target intact. You can even ask a comrade to do it for you so you can
approach the ship without danger. The voices are in "real time" where
your wingmen will compliment you if you kill an enemy, or answer to
any of your orders whith a little picture of them appearing in the
top left of the screen.  Another key allows you to target priority
enemies that are targeting you, which is important if you want to
survive. A shield management system will let you divert energy power
to certain parts of the ship (Scotty more power to the shields). This
is truly an experience which viewers of  Star Trek are familiar with.
It is great!! The missions are all very different and the story line
can be compared to those space opera available for the big (and
little) screen. At the beginning of each mission you will receive a
briefing, in full speech, from your superior. Pay attention to all
the primary and secondary objectives. All the missions can be
completed by achieving the primary objective, but full success can be
reached only by completing the secondary objectives too. At the end
of the mission you will be given some feedback and/or recommendations
on how to improve your performance. You can repeat the mission, if
you are unhappy with the results, as many times as you like; or you
can carry on with the story. Team work is necessary if you want to
survive the more advanced adventures. Communication with your wingmen
may be crucial to your or another ship's survival, which can mean
life or death, success or failure.
{pp}
{bold}CONCLUSIONS{nobold}
Freespace is not a recent game, and with its surrounding
being the open space the 3D engine is not very demanding. Therefore
the game runs fast, and I mean very fast, even on a 68060 processor.
All the graphics on the screen (ships, cranes, asteroids, etc.) make
full use of coloured lighting, shielding, lens flares with the
explosions in the game looking very realistic. Polygons and models
are satisfying to see and the ships are well designed. I am just a
bit concerned about the bitmaps, especially if you look at an object
very closely. You can change the colour of the HUD display and decide
the ammount of information you want to have available on the screen.
Indeed, to make it easy you can choose to have some of the HUD
displays pop up only when needed. I am disappointed about the opening
intro which is run at low resolution. I believe this is no fault of
Hyperion but more a limitation of the hardware we have which is way
too old compared to the modern PC and consoles.  Indeed, Hyperion is
making miracles in porting those games onto the Amiga system and
truly deserves our money. The sounds effect are pretty good (I was
disappointed about the collision one which was not very realistic),
the music is excellent and the voice acting is professionally done
although the voices of the various characters seemed a bit too
similar to each other. The control system is pretty spot on and there
are different ways to control your ship. You can use a combination of
mouse and keyboard, keyboard only, PC analogue joystick and CD32 or
PSX joypad. I found the mouse control very annoying. Rolling the
mouse will cause the ship to move while the two buttons can be used
to fire the primary and secondary weapon. As you can understand the
space on a mouse pad is very limited, so I had to keep lifting the
mouse at the edge of the mouse pad and bring it back to the original
position to move the ship resulting in a very annoying process. It is
best to use the keyboard control  for ship movement and the mouse for
fire accuracy although, the best control system is an analogue PC
with an Amiga adapter. Using the little software provided on the CD
is possible to calibrate the joystick to respond to your control
accurately.

{bold}CRASHES, CRASHES AND CRASHES{nobold}
The main concern I had with this game
were the crashes I have experienced. Since I installed Freespace I
have had at least a crash per game. That really put me off and I have
spent several days with Steffen trying to identify the problem. First
of all, if you are the owner of Miami Deluxe then switch it off
because it is a major cause of crashes/freezing on my system. Also, I
believe there is a problem with the audio streaming code. In fact, if
I disable it the crashes disappear completely. I am aware few people
have had the same problem and I have informed Steffen who is working
on it. Some people have benefited by increasing the audio and
graphics caches. I am personally providing Steffen with all the
information he needs to rectify the problem. Regarding Miami Deluxe,
Steffen mentioned that there is an incompatibility with Holger Kruse
software and he runs Freespace happily with AmiTCP. Unfortunately, I
was not able to test the online mutliplayer mode because I have only
managed to write this review two days before the AIO deadline (due to
the time I spent to get the game running on my system), hence I had
not access to a different TCP stack. But as I mentioned before it
seems only few people have experienced those crashes and the rest of
the community is pretty happy with this game.
{pp}
In conclusion, I find Freespace an amazing and rewarding experience.
I believe this is one of the best space combat simulator and a
guarantee of many hours of pure fun. It is also good value for money,
especially if you want to earn all the wings, ensigns and medals
available, which will definetely take up all your spare time for the
weeks coming. It is a cinematic experience which deserves to be
installed on any Amiga hard drive as soon as possible. My
congratulation go to the Hyperion team that, once again, has managed
to do a wonderful job in converting a great PC game. Well done guys,
more of this for the future.
