My name is Pascal Ruyter, i'm 35 years young, february 22nd i'll be a
year older and wiser and still computing without M$ Widows. I have
been involved in the "AMIGA SCENE" since 1988 when I purchased my first
miggy, an A500. Which was followed up by an A2000 and the last few
years i've been running my stuff on an A1200.

Some specs, don't hold your breath it is the current state of my miggy,
i tend to change a lot so now and then. But currently my miggy is as
follows (per januari 1st, 2002):

Amiga M1438S monitor{p}
Blizzard 1230 Mk IV turbocharger with 16 Mb of ram{p}

Like I said don't hold your breath, but every now and than bits get
bolded on and off, there for it is not a permanent configuration but rather a flexible one.

I'm married, (all girls think "Bummer" :-) ), got 2 boys, one is 3 years
young, the other is 1 year young), i got a job as a logistics operator
at a chemical plant and currently I own a Fiat Tempra but if one of the
readers and/or staff of Amiga Information Online has got a spare (make
that two spares) Humvees (m1025) for a very reasonable price then let
me know, you might get rid of them :-)

Well that's all I can think off right now, so
