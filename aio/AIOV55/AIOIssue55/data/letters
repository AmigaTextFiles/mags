To get things going we're bring back Hot Topic. That's where I state a
topic and you all send in your opinions on the matter for publication
next issue.  Usual rules apply; no over-use of foul language (or I'll start
replacing words with things like "Fudge" and "Darn"), debate is welcome
as long as it's not just a flame, and remember we'tre not Wintel
people which mans we're of a higher class of computer users.{pp}
This month's topic:  Do you think amiga is dragging it's feet a bit
too slow, and if so how might this be remedied?{pp}
Just send your opinions in to the usual Letters address given above. 
Hope to hear from you soon.
