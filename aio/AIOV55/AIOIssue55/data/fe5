Another little convenience to our readers, this in the form of an
update of the available internet software out there for use, including
the latest in betaware.{pp}
Vaporware should be able to supply most of your needs, though with a
few notes.  Voyager is currently bug-ridden though still superior in
many faturs to AWeb.  When it comes to java-script, use AWeb, else
Voyager should do.  The latest beta of Voyager fixes many problems
related to page formatting though still has a ways to go in things
like java-script support.  The way the betas are going Voyaager will
be stupendous once they finish it up... for whichever year THAT might
be.  Until then, keep a copy of AWeb handy as well.{pp}
For ftp, there ar several ways.  The old AmFTP is still useale with
one stipulation- it gets post-Y2K dates wrong.  For just Aminet use,
there's "Aminet.awnp" or the available DOpus FTP plugins such as "Http
Lister", though Aminet.awnp is my personal favorite.  For general ftp,
if you got Dopus then use it.{pp}
I don't think I need to say that AmIRC is about the Amiga standard,
and StrICQ is being developed once again with version 2.0 in the
works.  For news you got Stargate or NewsCoaster.  And while I haven't
had much need for telnet, from what little I've used AmTelnet it
appears to be quite good.{pp}
Finally, in email, YAM can't be beat but now it has some new
developers who are fast at work on v2.4.  In fact, the latest beta is
already a fine improvement over an already wonderful program.{pp}
Well, I think I've covered everything; pray for a finished Voyager
update and keep a lookout for StrICQ and YAM updates.{pp}
