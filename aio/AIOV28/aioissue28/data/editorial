Firstly I'd like to appologise to everyone who was expecting this issue
to be released 3 days ago but unfortunally I have again been hit with
a 'common cold' and again I feel awful. I must be one of the most
unlucky people to get these but luckily the issue was nearly finished
and i've only had to delay it 3 days. Obviously i'm still feeling unwell
but have managed to finish this issue. On with the editorial...

Welcome, welcome to what is a rather sad month. As you probably all
know by now there have been two departures at Amiga and a shocking
announcement by Tom Schmidt stating that the new Amiga MMC will not
be coming our way any time soon and probably not at all. Firstly
let me tell you how sad I am to see Jim Collas and Bill McEwen
gone with some strange reasons behind both. Bill has stated "I did not
leave Amiga, Gateway told me to leave". This coupled with some
exciting news from the Bill McEwen camp that can not yet be publicly
known but I will release details as soon as allowed.
{p} {p}
I first read the news about no MCC on a mainstream media in England
and then in a leading newspaper which came as a huge shock. We see
little or no news about the Amiga for well over 5 years and as soon as
it looks like the project is gone you can't find a place where the
news isn't printed or shown. This makes me wonder if the rest of
the computing world wanted something like the Amiga MCC to happen
because most people used to be Amiga users and want some choice over
just PC.
{p} {p}
As we thought we where the lost world of computers it seems from what
has been printed in non-amiga press that they actually know we exist
with words that the Amiga community has been delt another blow. We
do exist in the eyes of the computing world, we are just harder to
find.
{p} {p}
I am quite upset by the announcement but there has been hope in my body
before and its not about to fade now. We have had set back after
set back but pulled through and each time got closer and closer to
our goal. Maybe next time it will be different, maybe we will finally
reach our target so don't give in now, the fun is just about to begin!

Lastly on another sad note we see the departure of {bold}Lee Hesselden{nobold} who was
the longest running editor bar me. He first started on AIO some 17 or
18 issues ago when AIO was in its early years. I would like to thank
Lee for the great work he has done. Although he is leaving for now to
put more effort into his even increasing school work he assures me he
will be back in around a year, we look forwards to seeing you again
Lee.

If you have any personal messages for Lee then please send them to him
at, {bold}wrecker98@geocities.com{nobold} or letters that will be printed
in the magazine should be directed to, {bold}letters@aio.co.uk{nobold}
