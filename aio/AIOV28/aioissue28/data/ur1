I now have a task to try out WebVision... WebVision is a program to view the
films that different WebCams provides... A WebCam is a camera that sends what
it films to a computer, and it gets published on the Internet!
{p} {p}
First out, is the installation. It has a Standard Installer script that makes
the installation very simple, choose where to put it, and it gets installed.
One nice thing it does is to ask you if you want to accept films with adult
material, good if you don't want anyone to watch them, but ofcourse, I didn't
choose this ;) (You must think I'm a pervert now ;) ) It will also ask to
install OpenURL.library if you want (ie, if you don't have it).
After that all you need to do is to copy the key (if you have registered it)
to the directory it's installed in, and then start it.
{p} {p}
When you start WebVision, a MUI interface will appear, the main window looks like
this:

The thing you must do after you have started it is configuring it. It's a very
easy process, you will be finished within one minute. Not much to say about it
really...
{p} {p}
And now we are ready to use it. Just put your TCP/IP stack online and off you go.
{p} {p}
It comes with a quite big list of predefined webcams... And to look at a webcam all
you need to do is to doubleclick on it's name in the list. It will then open a new
window and begin to download/show the film/pictures for you... When you're finished
with a webcam, just close it's window, as easy as 1-2-3... ;)
{p} {p}
If you want to add a webcam, press the appropriate button and a new window will appear,
here you must enter the URL to the webcam, and also set if it should AutoUpdate it,
scale the pics, show on start etc..
{p} {p}
You can also get new updates of WebVision directly through the program, just go to
the VERY good looking About window (it has a very nice moving fire at the bottom ;) )
and press the Program update button..
{p} {p}
You can also get new webcams directly from a server by pressing another button, it
will also send all the public webcams you have that the server doesn't... So all
other WebVision users can share your finds ;)
{p} {p}
You are probably thinking now, what if I want to keep some webcams private then? Well,
it's easy, just move them to the Private Sites group and they will not be sent!
{p} {p}
That's about what I will say about the program, there is a few more things that you
can do with it ofcourse, but you will have to explore them for yourself!
{p} {p}
So, if there is something you don't understand in WebVision then? Well, just press
the help button while holding the mousepointer over the specific place that you want
to know more about, and it will load the guide and move you to the correct place in it!
{p} {p}
The Guide that comes with WebVision is a VERY nice one, it describes every part of the
program quite thouraghly... So no need for you to go and wonder how to use it, just
read the excellent Guide!
