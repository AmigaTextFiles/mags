Welcome readers to something of an exclusive. We have brought you many
interviews in the past and now we bring you the ideas of {bold}Bjorn Lynne{nobold},
one of the most famous musicians on the Amiga ever... on with the
interview...
{p} {p}
CS>Firstly could you tell me a little about yourself, where you where
born, age etc?
{p} {p}
I was born in Oslo, Norway - 30 years ago. I moved to England in 1995 to
persue a full-time carreer in writing and playing music. I've lived in
England since then, writing music for computer- and video-games and also
publishing my own CD albums. In addition, on my spare-time, I run a little
online CD shop and specialse in selling CDs related to the Amiga- and
demo-scenes. I sell CDs by myself, Chris Huelsbeck, Allister Brimble, Jogeir
Liljedahl, Scorpik, Lizardking, Moby, and other demo-scene related artists
and CDROM collections.
{p} {p}
CS>How did you first get involved with the Amiga?
{p} {p}
I worked part-time in a computer-store in Norway, and when the first Amiga
500's came out, I bought one on the first day that they were available.
{p} {p}
CS>What made you get into music instead of another area like graphics?
{p} {p}
I don't know, it wasn't a conscious choice - I guess I just enjoyed music so
much, and that's what I had the most fun with. Besides, I was always crap
with graphics. :-). Mind you, my interest in music didn't start with the
Amiga. I was into music even before the Amigas came out. I used to have a
Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48 k, and I had a couple of musical "add-on's" for it,
including the "Music Machine" MIDI-interface and "SpecDrum" drum-machine. So
I did in fact dabble in music even before the Amiga. But when the Amiga came
out with a whooping 4 channels of super-sounding digital audio, that's when
it really "got serious" for me.
{p} {p}
CS>How did you first get involved with the Amiga 'Scene'?
{p} {p}
I don't even remember it clearly, it was about 12 years ago. There were
about 7 or 8 friends of mine, we all got together, started to make demos
just for fun, and we decided to call ourselves by a group name
("Crusaders").
{p} {p}
CS>How long where you a part of the 'Scene'?
{p} {p}
It's been about 11-12 years now. I'm still in the scene, in as much as I
still go to the big scene-parties in Scandinavia ("The Gathering" in Norway
every year with 4500+ scene-freaks, and "Dreamhack" in Sweden every year
with 2500+ scene-freaks). I go there and meet old friends, and sell
demo-related CDs. I even went to the "Deja Vu" '99 demo-party here in the UK
this summer, and I won the music-compo. :-)
{p} {p}
CS>What do you think of the Amiga 'Scene' and the 'Scene' on other
platforms today?
{p} {p}
I don't know, I think some of the initial sense of adventure, and of
creating something new and exciting, is gone. But that doesn't mean that I
think the scene today is "sh*t". It's become a "popular opinion" of old-time
sceners to say that "the old scene was great, today it's sh*t". I disagree
with this because if the guys in the scene today are having fun, then it's a
good scene.
{p} {p}
CS>How did you come to work at Team17?
{p} {p}
I did a couple of small jobs for them back in the very early 90's, when I
still lived in Norway. I made the music for a couple of Amiga budget-games
that they did ("Qwak", "Final Over" and one song for the game "Project-X".)
So a few years later, when they expanded and needed a full-time musician,
they already knew about me and what I could do. They asked me to send a few
more examples of my work (by this time I had already published my second
non-game-oriented CD album), so I sent in my CD and told them that I really
wanted the job. And I got it.
{p} {p}
CS>Did you ever use Amigas to make your music, and do you ever use
them now?
{p} {p}
I did use Amigas to make music for the Amiga games. I used Amigas to create
the music for Qwak, Brat, Cubulus, Airline, Fantastic Voyage, Final Over and
basically all the Amiga games I did back then - including "Worms" and
"Worms - The Directors Cut". I also used an Amiga 500 and the MIDI sequencer
program "Music-X" for all the music on my first 2 CD albums (and about half
of the third).
{p} {p}
CS>How many tunes have you created yourself?
{p} {p}
As Amiga modules: Maybe 350 or so. For Amiga-, PC- and PlayStation-games, I
don't know, maybe 150 different tunes. For all my CD albums that I have
released so far: Maybe 150 tunes. As General MIDI tracks just available on
my web-site, plus some other special formats like Soundblaster AWE32 and
Soundfont format and all that... maybe 70 tunes. I guess that makes a total
of more than 700 tunes. That's the result of doing music for about 7 years
part-time, and 5 years full-time.
{p} {p}
CS>How many Amigas can be found in the offices of Team17 :)?
{p} {p}
Right now I think we have just one or two. Maybe 3-4 more that don't work
and/or aren't plugged in.
{p} {p}
CS>What type of setup do you use to create music these days and how
does it differ from years gone by setups of yours?
{p} {p}
The setup I use now is more geared towards audio-recording and less "MIDI
note programming". Whereas before, I used to put notes and commands into a
MIDI editing program that would trigger notes on my synths - today I
actually play the instruments instead, and record them as audio-tracks
directly to harddisk. I have a digital mixing desk and a Frontier Design
WaveCenter card which lets me record direct to harddisk. And I can play back
10 channels of digital audio, together with any MIDI signals and/or
clock-synchronised drum machines etc. that's running at the same time.
{p} {p}
CS>What type of music and bands do you personally like and which
computer musicians do you also like?
{p} {p}
I like all types of music, and I often get inspired by the last thing I've
heard. I can listen to the radio and hear a jazz-tune... then that really
inspires me, and I want to start up my studio and make a jazz-tune. Then I
can listen to a piece of orchestral music from a TV-series like "Babylon-5",
and then that inspires me even more, so I have to stop what I'm doing, and
so some of that orchestral stuff instead. But then maybe I can hear some
ambient or trance music, and that inspires me so much that I have to stop
everything I'm doing, and make a trance-track instead! I'm hopeless like
that. I get inspired by everything I hear, and right away I want to go and
try to do something similar myself.
{p} {p}
CS>Is there anyone who influences your music?
{p} {p}
It comes and goes in periods. Right now, I would say that a lot of my game
music is a bit inspired by the work of Mark Snow, the guy who composes for
X-Files and Millennium. Also, I just finished the music for a space-game and
in that period, I listened closely to the work of Christopher Franke. I also
get inspired by the music in other games. I thought the music in the racing
game "Hot Chix and Gear-Stix" was really cool, so I went and did thing in
the same general feeling for the stunt/racing-game that we're making, "Stunt
GP".
{p} {p}
CS>Do you have any interest in the Amiga as a platform and would you come
back if it made even a small return?
{p} {p}
I will use whatever platform gives me the best tools to write my music. If
an Amiga comes out with superb audio capabilities and great music production
software, then I will use it. If a brand new computer called, ehm...
"scwumph!" comes out - with brilliant audio capabilities and the very best
music production softare... then I will use it!
{p} {p}
CS>Please can you tell us a little about LynneMusic Productions, what it
is all about, when it was started etc?
{p} {p}
LynneMusic Productions was first just meant as the name for my little online
CD shop, for selling only my own CDs. I have relased quite a lot of CD
albums through the years. Some are "real" CD releases that are published
through a real record company. Other are more "personal" releases, where I
have just done everything myself and made the CDs available for sale only
through my web site. These "smaller", "personal" releases are sold at a
lower price, as I do it mostly for the enjoyment of a few hundred fans and
myself.
{p} {p}
After a while, I contacted Chris Huelsbeck and suggested that maybe I should
sell his CDs through my shop, too. Chris thought it was a good idea, so I
bought some CDs from him, and put them up for sale in my "shop". Then a few
months later, I also contacted Allister Brimble and Gustaf "Lizardking"
Grefberg, and suggested that maybe I should sell their CDs too. Then
followed Adam "Scorpik" Skorupa. And then I started tracking down other
special-interest CDs like the "Best of the Amiga Scene" music-CD, and the
"Back in Time" music-CD with re-made C64 music classics. And then even more
demo-scene related CDs followed. So it just started with a way to sell my
own CDs, and then it grew bit by bit, and now I have the world's best
selection of demo-scene related music-CDs and CDROM's. It has got quite
professional now - I have a guaranteed secure SSL encrypted order form and
can take all kinds of credit cards, plus cheques, postal orders and
international money orders. I have more than 1200 registered customers from
all over the world, including Japan, Brazil, Indonesia, Alaska, Iceland, and
even one regular customer in Mongolia! Although most of my customers are
from USA, UK, Germany and Scandinavia.
{p} {p}
CS>What are you doing in your life these days?
{p} {p}
I live in Wakefield, West Yorkshire with my girlfriend Hannah and our 3 cats
(yes, we are cat crazy!). I spend most weekdays writing music for computer-
and video-games, and most evenings either relaxing together with Hannah, or
maybe recording some music for my own non-game-oriented CD alhums. Running
the CD-shop takes maybe 1-2 hours per day, and Hannah also helps me with
this.
{p} {p}
CS>Do you have any special memories about your Amiga days or your music
production on a whole?
{p} {p}
Yeah, that first night when the original 8 members of Crusaders all got
together, officially started the group, made our very first demo (in 1
night), and got drunk. That was great. :-) Also all the friends I made back
in the days of sending floppy-disks in the post.
{p} {p}
CS>Thanks for your time
{p} {p}
My pleasure!
