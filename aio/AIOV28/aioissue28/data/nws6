The Villagetronic Picasso-IV's at the dealers now will be the last
you'll see produced new.  Villagetronic has decided that due to
low sales, the Picasso-IV and it's add on cards (with the exception
of the 3D module) will be made in one last batch, then discontinued.
The Picasso96 software is still in production however, as it runs
on many graphics cards and is not directly related to Villagetronic
or the Picasso-IV.
