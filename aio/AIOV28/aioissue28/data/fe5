This the second portuguese Amiga Party!!! {p}
This year we'll try to have more people attending it, more productions, in a word 
more AMIGA.{p}
In order to avoid last year's lack of interest, this time anyone wanting to be at the 
Party,{p}
will have to pay for their registrations in advance, in other words there will have
to be at least 40 pre-registrations to make this party happen.{p}
And how does it work? quite simple! Take a look at the following steps
{p} {p}
1. Send an e-mail to mig77@3wmasters.com for pre-registration{p}
2. An account number will be sent to you{p}
3. With that account number head to the nearest ATM machine{p}
   and transfer the amount of 2000 PTE (£6.6 GBPounds) to the account{p}
4. Keep the ticket! That will be your way in the party grounds{p}
5. Send an email with your name stating that you have already payed
{p} {p}
If the 40 pre-registrations that are required dont happen until 20/09,
the ones who had already paid will have their money back.
