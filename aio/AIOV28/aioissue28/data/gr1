Buzzy is your typical platformer but with one big difference. I played
quite a way into the game but could not find any 'real' badies. Okay
you have some spikes and other nasties to fend off, but there where
no real hard challenges.

The game starts with a very nice intro, the graphics are just excellent
in the intro. The game itself has some quite nice graphics but by looking
at the intro you would have thought the author/s would have spent a little
more time on the ingame graphics as they lack the quality the intro
graphics have.

As I said earlier this game is your usual platform game. The idea is to
collect all the objects which change from stage to stage, the first being
candy canes and then onto some sort of pearl. You have to collect keys
to open certain doors which contain your goal object (candy cane, pearl
etc) As I said there are no actual badies apart from some minor ones like
a few spikes here and there. This means that each level is time limited
but gets harder as you go through the game. This can be quite a challenge
as you don't even know what route to take at first or even where the
exit is.

Overall its a nice game but the lack of badies really lets the game down
making its playability loose points and also this does effect the
lastability of the game. The game as far as I could tell is only in
French but this is not such a bad problem, you can get by but some maybe
put off by its lack of English, thats if youe english speaking only..
of course!
