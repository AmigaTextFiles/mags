Review by Chris Seward

Think back two issues to issue 26 and you may remember the name
WBPerplexity. Well back then I suggested a few ideas and now just
under two months later and a few bugs solved we have risen to v1.2
which is now what I am going to review.

The idea was explained two issues ago so have a look at the description
from then...
{p} {p}
"The idea is you have a picture split into 8 pieces and by moving or
sliding the pieces into and out of the empty spot you can recreate the
whole picture. Very simple idea but it makes for a challenging game and
a very addictive one at that."

When I played the first version I thought it was a brilliant game but
lacked some features that could improve the game alot. Now these
features have been added and more!
{p} {p}
When you load up the game you will notice a timer under the picture and
also a count mover so there is no need to keep going and checking what
both of these are up to because they are now built into the main
screen. Another gripe I had was that if you have never seen the picture
before then you don't know what its supposed to look like. Now while
ingame if you press help you can see the picture, this of course costs
you one move but its alot more helpful than previous versions.

The game also has some more new options like use datatypes, sounds and
a few other minor bits and piece which make the game deserve 2 extra
points to its overall score.
