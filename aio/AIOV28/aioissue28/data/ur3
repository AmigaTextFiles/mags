JoyTest 1.04 is a programs that tests your joystick (to see if it is working)...
There is no installation needed and you don't even have to read the very short
Doc there is... Just start it, look at the nice CyberGuard hit it gives (using
memory it's not allowed to do) and then see it open a screen... Then test!! It
can't test the extra buttons on a CD³² pad so I don't like it ;)

Well, something nice, hmm, no installation needed :) Otherwise this one is kinda
crappy... There is alot better programs to do this, or why not start a game and
you will notice if it's working or not! ;)
