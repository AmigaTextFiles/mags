{subhead} Straightening Out The Mess{def}{p}
Review by Mark Tierno

Well, seems things have run fast and furious lately, and rumors even
faster. So, I guess it's about time to run up a summary of the facts-
and Just the <facts- in an effort to sift out just what has been going
on.
{p} {p}
First, Collas has resigned for reasons apparently having to do with
internal politics, with Tom Schmidt taking over. No plans for closing
Amiga, life goes on.
{p} {p}
Schmidt has announced the new goals of Amiga, goals which I seem to
remember him pushing for back when he was in charge of one half of Amiga
and Petro the other. No more hardware, no more MCC, just software. He
says he is open to lisencing out the proposed hardware specs to someone
else to make but that Amiga will not make it themselves.
{p} {p}
The OS3.5 update, and all classic developments, remain unaffected. There
is doubt as to if OS5+ will come off or if they'll just license the new
OS specs to someone else.
{p} {p}
The Mystery Chip still remains a mystery, whatever it may have been,
though Transmeta denighs it ever was them. personally I think it might
have been the new Sun multimedia chip, but we may never know.

Analysis:{p}
To make any sort of major return to the scene, the Amiga needs two
things. One, a new machine- as in Hardware- from the parent company as
the guiding force, and said parent company pushing it with advertising
and whatnot. No one's going to flock to an advertisment that amounts to
"Come see our new OS specs; not a real program or anything you can buy,
but please go get it from these other Amiga Partners...".
{p} {p}
Firm guidance is needed, with killer hardware and an updated OS and wide
software support. Third-party attempts from the likes of Phase5 may help
the Community, but will do nothing for a general public ressurrection.
{p} {p}
If Gateway and Amiga are serious about making a go of it and fulfilling
their bottom-line dreams, they should Act like they want to make money
off this thing and start being aggressive. If Gates was this timid then
Microsoft would still be working out of some hotel room in New Mexico.

For good or bad, I hope this clears things up.
