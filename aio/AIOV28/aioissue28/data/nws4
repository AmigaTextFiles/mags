Tom Schmidt, in his Executive Update, has caused some controversy with
his suggestions that the Amiga has never been about an operating
system or hardware, but rather just an idea. There are those who hold
the operating system and the unique properties of the hardware as what
make the Amiga, and see the suggestion as just a way to placate people
who do not like the idea of Amiga producing only an "operating
environment" which runs on other operating systems and hardware, like
an application program.
