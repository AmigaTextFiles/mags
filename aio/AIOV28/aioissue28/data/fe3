On sackings, disclosures, resignations and the whole damn thing ...

I once had a telephone conversation with Mehdi Ali - remember
him? Officially he was the president of Commodore Business
Machines. On the 'Deathbed Vigil' video he is referred to as
the 'little brown man'. In the Amiga community he is known
as 'the man who tried to kill the Amiga'.
{p} {p}
Actually, it wasn't really a conversation. He did most of
the talking (well, shouting really), and I was supposed to
listen.
{p} {p}
I hadn't even called him. I was actually talking to his
secretary (who appeared to be repeating my queries to someone
else and then repeating their response back to me) when he
took the phone off her and started abusing me. This was
six years or so ago - immediately following the collapse
of Commodore in Australia - so I can't say that these are
the actual words spoken, but the conversation went pretty
much along these lines ...
{p} {p}
Voice: "Who are you? What do you want?"
{p} {p}
Me: "My name is Craig Delahoy. I'm just trying to get some
information on Commodore Australia."
{p} {p}
Voice: "That's nothing to do with us. Separate company.
Go away and leave us alone."
{p} {p}
Me: "I'm sorry, who are you?"
{p} {p}
Voice: "My name is Mehdi Ali. I work here."
{p} {p}
Me: "All I'm trying to do is ask ..."
{p} {p}
Voice: "You people are always bothering us! Why do you
always bother us? We have nothing to say to you. It's
none of your f**king business! P*ss off and leave us
alone!"
{p} {p}
(The sound of a telephone being violently disconnected.)
{p} {p}
I used to paraphrase that telephone conversation to all
my Amiga friends at the time as a tidy little summary
of Commodore's attitude to Amiga users: "Go away and
leave us alone."
{p} {p}
It was very shortly after that that Commodore themselves
went belly-up - and Mehdi Ali got his wish.
{p} {p}
If there's one thing the Amiga community has learned -
apart from deep cynicism and suspicion - it's to
recognise deja'vu when you see it.
{p} {p}
It's got to be one of the odd things about Amiga people.
I'm sure Intel don't get people ringing them up all the
time or emailing them, asking them what's happening with
the latest chip design, suggesting features that just
must go into the next superchip. I'm sure
Micro$oft don't have people harassing them about Windows
3.11 (which I think was released around 1992) and insisting
that all new Micro$oft products must support it, that
any new product they produce must look and feel like it ...
{p} {p}
But we have a special relationship with our computer. It's
not just a tool we use to get a job done. Sometimes it
feels more like a friend that we just like to spend time
with, or a colleague that we prefer to work with. I've
even heard an Amiga described as a surrogate-child - "the
baby I never had".
{p} {p}
We need to know what's going on with the Amiga just
like we need to know that our friends are okay. Just
like we want to know how our children are developing,
what they're up to, how well they're feeling. This is
not a machine to us, it's a lifestyle.
{p} {p}
If we asked our child's kindergarten teacher how our
child was developing, would they tell us to p*ss off
and leave them alone?
{p} {p}
For many years we Amigaphiles felt helpless as our child
was tossed about from party to party in one custody battle
after another. We sat helplessly on the sidelines wishing
that we could do something, trying to comfort ourselves
with the certainty that it would be over quickly and
there would be little suffering. We smiled, consoled,
when we saw how tough the little guy was, taking all the
knocks on the chin, always coming through no matter
what they threw at him.
{p} {p}
Then, for a little while at least, we were able to
relax. The baby had - it seemed - found a final home.
It was warm, protected, secure. We heard nothing for
a little while, and perhaps began to get a little
concerned again. More recently the news was improving.
Things were happening, and it seemed our Amiga would
finally get back into the spotlight where it belonged.
{p} {p}
There was news aplenty - activity, movement, vision.
In the Amiga community we didn't believe that no news
was good news - we felt that no news was no Amiga.
To finally hear not only that things were progressing
but that they were steaming ahead in all sorts of
directions, was not just encouraging - it was
invigorating. There was life in the little guy yet,
and we would all be rewarded for our loyalty and
hard work.
{p} {p}
Many of us had misgivings or reservations about
some of the news we heard, but it was so much better
to be discussing (or arguing about) which direction
forward we would be taking, rather than mere
reminiscing as we had been doing for so many years.
{p} {p}
In the wake of Jim Collas' resignation from Amiga, there
has been all sorts of speculation about his reasons for
departure. The removal of the Technical Brief from Amiga's
website and the closure of many of the channels of
communication, lends much weight to the notion
that Gateway felt that too much information was being
given out - there was too much disclosure. According to
this theory, this angst clashed with Jim's management
philosophy, and in the ensuing dogfight Jim could see
that he had no way of winning - the parent company
would have it's way no matter what, with him or without
him.
{p} {p}
I read the Technical Brief, I read the Executive Updates,
I followed the Linux discussions and I savoured at the
MCC design prototypes. Together it all inspired me,
sparked me, relit the flame beneath me - a flame that I
was beginning to think had died. If you've read my
Show Report on the Amiga
Down Under 1999 show in Canberra, you may have picked
up some of the optimism and enthusiasm I was feeling.
Without that taste of what was happening with the
Amiga vision, there would not have been that enthusiasm -
in fact I probably wouldn't have even bothered to go to
the show.
{p} {p}
If the release of tidbits of information was really the
catalyst behind the departure of Jim Collas and Bill McEwan,
then here are my thoughts:
{p} {p}
There wasn't enough detail in any of those items to
allow any of the competition to get the jump on Amiga.
There wasn't really anything in the big-picture
vision stuff that hasn't already been evangelised by
others in the industry for some time.
There didn't appear to be anything in the specs or
brief that might have been breaching NDA's or other
confidentiality agreements.{p}
The Linux announcement - while it may have created
a few waves in the Amiga community - was seen by the
rest of the industry as a bit of a yawn. Interesting,
perhaps, but not entirely unexpected.
Jim Collas had very carefully examined the Amiga
community and gauged what needed to be done to retain
it's support. He's not a stupid man - he did his
research.{p}
The momentum was building just as Jim Collas had
expected/planned. It was the right amount of information
at the right time. The community was gearing up again.
Now - well, there's that deja'vu feeling again ... that
deja'vu feeling again ...
{p} {p}
Now I see that Petro has had to cancel a trip to the
Polish Amiga Show. He has been summoned to the United
States for an 'emergency meeting'. I've been critical
of Petro once or twice in the past, but - as I said
in my show report - I take my hat off to him. His
commitment, passion and loyalty cannot be faulted. I
only hope that those qualities will not cost him
his job this week ...
{p} {p}
If the theories about the degree of disclosure are
correct, then the Amiga faces yet another dangerous
time. I can understand a company's desire to retain some
commercial competitive edge over it's rivals, and that
confidentiality is often required to achieve that. But
shutting the blinds and slamming the doors and retreating
into the bunker is not the answer. There is a middle
ground to be had - one that gives little if anything
away to the competition, yet continues to inspire and
motivate the customers. Jim had found that middle ground.
{p} {p}
Mind you, the disclosure theory is not the only one
doing the rounds. There are those asking about backroom
deals, about pressure from even bigger players. There
are suggestions of imminent failure, or of the fear
of success. Even talk of that curse ...
{p} {p}
Personally, I'm hoping that this is all just a minor
personality clash. That it will all blow over without
incident and that Tom Schmidt - the former COO who is
now sitting in the big chair - will steer the ship
safely and triumphantly through the course that has been
set for it. But that's just me.
{p} {p}
The more cynical out there might simply be saying, "We've
seen this before." The more suspicious might be saying,
"What's really going on and who's really behind it?" And
then there are those saying, "Enough is enough. If we
see one more company take the Amiga behind closed doors
and yell at us - 'P*ss off and leave us alone' - then
we may just do that."
{p} {p}
Be very careful what you wish for Gateway - you just may get it.
