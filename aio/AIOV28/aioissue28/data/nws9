THE PHOENIX PLATFORM CONSORTIUM
{p} {p}
We are pleased to announce the acceptance of provisional charter for
the Phoenix Platform Consortium.
{p} {p}
Phoenix signatories believe it is time to place our destiny back in
the hands of folks who understand what the Amiga is all about. You
will notice members of the original Jay Miner team within our ranks.
{p} {p}
Unlike other new entities we will not field questions from newsgroups,
mailing lists, or in email, nor will we be erecting a marketing facade
to false hopes. Results and honest direction are our mandate.
{p} {p}
The Phoenix Platform Consortium will assume responsibility for aid and
recommendation for reference platforms for the Amiga users who wish to
upgrade their present Amigas, as we establish an open migration path
to a new platform. That platform will in spirit and in feel be a new
Amiga experience while incorporating and surpassing the features found
on the desktop elsewhere today.
{p} {p}
More information will be posted when we have facts to present. Please
do NOT email the participants in curiosity. We ask for your patience
in this matter. Please respect the wishes of the participants named
below. There is much to do and we have just begun.
{p} {p}
As information becomes available it will be posted on mailing lists,
newsgroups, and at the following website: {link http://owlnet.net/phoenix/}http://owlnet.net/phoenix/{end}
which will be up shortly. This announcement is freely repostable.
