Millenium is yet another simple tool to show how long it is until the year 2000!
But this one has a few other features.. It can do the following, Countdown in
days-hours-mins-secs, Countdown just in secs, show the time, show the date and show
the day (in 4 different languages)...

Not so much to say about it really, it's about 11kb, and it comes with a small ReadMe
file that describes the options in English and German...
{p} {p}
Usage couldn't be simpler, start from CLI with any of the options... If you don't have
any option after it, it won't show a thing... (Kinda bad, it should default to
Countdown in my opinion!)

So, nothing much really... And nothing fancy, this is it with all the options on and
the weekday in english:
