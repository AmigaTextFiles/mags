Many issues ago we previewed this game titled Damage. Back then I thought the
game was excellent with great playability but unfortunately the game was only
a demo and had to be registered somewhere in Finland. As I am the forgetful
type and any effort needed puts me off I never actually got around to sending
off my registration fee.
{p} {p}
When I saw that Damage was available through most mail order companies in the
UK I snapped up the chance to purchase it. The game itself which I bought from
Alive Mediasoft LTD took just over two weeks to arrive which isn't all that
good a response time, although I was told that they didn't have it in stock but
still...
{p} {p}
The game comes in a small cardboard box which was totally crushed in my case
with a label over stating the game name. Inside you will find a small piece
of paper detailing the game and two red disks with small labels on. This for
£10 is quite a good deal as i'm sure you wouldn't get this quality on a
shareware product for the same price.

Well onto the game...

The game itself is your average platform game but with one major difference. In
most platform games your goal is to save someone and you are normally a
cuddly ball or blob but in Damage your goal is to kill as many people as
possible and the use of drugs is permitted. Firstly let me tell you that
Alive only recommend this game to anyone 16 or over with other companies
suggesting an 18 rating. This being the Amiga market I think there is no
or little power to stop anyone under the age of 18 buying the game except
from the companies own choice. The game isn't all that violent but the
content may want to be checked before allowing small children to play
because of the many violent acts that are carried out and the use of drugs.

The graphics themselves are very small and the amount of violence out of
them is very little but the actual idea of killing an old granny with a
baseball bat may make a few heads turn. There are an array of weapons
including guns, baseball bat and the very boring chainsaw.
{p} {p}
At the start of Damage you take a baseball bat being the worst weapon in
the game, this you find has been left laying around by the careless
scientist who has made you into a mad man. There are a range of people
to kill from children, grannys, business men and the general public to
the army, workers and even the mafia and gangsters. As you progress
through the game you need to collect weapons, money and a handful of
different drugs.
{p} {p}
The graphics are very smooth and the intro pictures are very well drawn
showing the effort that has gone into this game. I think the major let
down of the game is the fact that it was not very well advertised because
a game of its quality needs to be known about. It isn't the best game
in the world and doesn't have a great plot but if you like a bit of
violence in your game then get this, if on the other hand you hate
violent games stay away from this one.
