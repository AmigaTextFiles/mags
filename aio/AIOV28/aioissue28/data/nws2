On the 1st of September, ZDNet announced that Jim Collas had resigned

on Amiga Inc's website itself, with a link to a Yahoo news article.

The former COO (head of operations) Tom Schmidt has now taken over as
president, and dispite talk from many directions of the end of the
Amiga NG, has promised that the companies goal of the Amigasoft
application has not changed.

Collas is also reported to have put up for sale his 118,000 Gateway
shares, prompting suggestions that he either wants to leave the
computing industry or has had a major disagreement with Gateway
management. The sale of 118,000 shares would make Collas
US$11,000,000 (approx. £6.6 million) richer!
