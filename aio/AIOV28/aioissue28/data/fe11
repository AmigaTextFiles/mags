I have just read the news on a mainstream computer news page on
teletext on the british channel four, 21/9/99 on page 651. I am sure
you'll all know the news now and that is that Amiga will not be making
another computer but instead focus on internet applications, again,
us the community has been screwed over when everything was
going good for the first time. Groups like Digital Corruption
complained about Amiga long ago although they went about it in the
wrong way they came up with the truth long before most people could
see it.
{p} {p}
I think we have all been wary at times but sometimes have been blind
to the facts and been living a pipe dream. Another company has
screwed us but I hope we can survive, why should now be the end?
there is nothing to pull me to the PC or Mac market so the Amiga is
still my number 1 choice and I hope you and all developers will stay
with our platform and support it, it is us who can save what we have
and no one else now. We have survived since 1993/4 until now so why
can't we carry on, I didn't see us still being here 4-5 years later
but we still are, we may have lost a few people along the way but
if in your heart of hearts you claim to be an Amiga user then stay
with us, the elite Amiga users and show the world we care about
OUR computer because now it belongs to US.
{p} {p}
I urge Gateway to sell the rights to Amiga the company to someone
who cares and see if anyone will bid for it, they owe us this at
least, if they are going to do nothing with it then give someone
else a chance, even if no big players buy our computer name then
sell it to a smaller company and give us back the name, we don't
want to see the word Amiga on an internet box, if we'd have wanted
that we would have supported Escom.
{p} {p}
Some may call this the 3rd time we've been done over or some might
say the second but the basic fact is its happend again and its
something we have come through before so I see no reason why
we can't do it again. The Amiga is our choice, if it wasn't the
choice of many then we wouldn't be here now, we would have
parted 3 or 4 years ago but we are the REAL users who know
our computer and like what it does and what it stands for, lets
show the computing world that we are not ready to die even if
for the future ahead we can yet see no new computer.
{p} {p}
My pledge is to make Gateway sell the rights to Amiga to a
company of our choice that we support and we back.
{p} {p}
I don't think we should blame Jim Collas or any Amiga worker
because I don't think this is what THEY wanted, of course not,
I blame Gateway. Tom Schmidt has been quoted as saying that
it was unrealistic, of course it isn't, the Mac is hanging around,
people are bored with the PC so it is not unrealistic at all.
{p} {p}
They have said that they might consider a licence for someone
else to work on a new computer but all this really says to me
is they believe in the back of their minds that it could take off
but they are too gutless to put a bit of effort in and give it
a go, with a licence if it doesn't take off then they are safe and
if it does they rake in the money.
{p} {p}
I think we should all email Gateway and tell them what we really
think of them and tell them to sell the rights.
{p} {p}
I would like to say however that I am willing to show my support
by making the commitment now that for as long as people want
AIO to keep running it will, as long as there is a small readership
then it will continue.
{p} {p}
I would also like to say to everyone reading that I hope you
too stick with the Amiga, if you want to buy a PC along side then
do that but stay with the Amiga, I for one am 100% an Amiga user
and for as long as I can see will always be. The Amiga has been
a part of my life for as long as I can remember and its not
about to die yet. Stay with us, don't let our computer fade away.
