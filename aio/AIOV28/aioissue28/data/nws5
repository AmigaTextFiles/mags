{p} {p}

Dear Amiga friends:
{p} {p}
Without any regrets, I have to inform the Amiga community that we have
cancelled the BLIZZARD and the CYBERSTORM G3 accelerators. I hope you
will understand our reasons for that step, which I will outline shortly:
{p} {p}
We don't see a big future for the G3 processors in the Amiga, since we
will be shipping the G4 versions of our next generation BLIZZARD and
CYBERSTORM boards, starting by October 1999. The boards come in for a
similar pricing as the originally announced G3 boards (well, sorry, you
have to pay 10$ more for the 400MHz Altivec unit...)
{p} {p}
You too can now join the gigaflop community now with these exciting new
products:
{p} {p}
- PowerPC XPC7400 with Altivec{p}
- Ready for SMP with Dual-XPC7400 configurations{p}
- QNX Neutrino OS included{p}
- Full Amiga 3.x legacy support included{p}
- Ready to run LINUX PPC as well (for those who want it){p}
- and much more, read the specs in detail at {link http://www.phase5.de}http://www.phase5.de{end}
{p} {p}
For all users who now finally decide to get one of these boards, we have
extended the preorder program one last time until September 15, 1999.
Don't miss the deadline!
{p} {p}
If you have placed a G3 order already, you'll of course get the G4
boards at no extra cost too.
