Transcript of Petro Tyschtschenko's telephone address to the
Saku99 Amiga Show.
{p} {p}
The following is a transcript of the telephone greeting Petro
made to the Saku 99 Amiga Show in Finland in September 1999. I have 
tried to make this as readable as possible, but without taking any 
liberties with the context of his speech. Keep in mind that - while 
Petro's english is good - this is an address made over a telephone 
and recorded off a speaker in a crowded room. 
{p} {p}
I have tried to lose all of the 'ums', 'ahs' and 'ands' and connect 
a few unconnected sentences. Where the quality of the recording was 
such that a word or phrase was unintelligible (including audience 
coughing, etc), I have tried to indicate this with a (?). 
{p} {p}
Otherwise this is an accurate account of what Petro said.

--------
{p} {p}
Hello?
{p} {p}
Hi everybody. How are you doing today? I'm really a little 
bit sad that I could not come to see all (?) Amiga this year. 
{p} {p}
But first, the latest news which was announced over C/Net and 
over the Gateway Internet two days ago. My boss, Jim Collas, 
left the company and I'm, of course, very sad about this. Because 
I am thinking that here was a guy that could drive our Amiga in 
the right direction for our future.
{p} {p}
But nevertheless the lines (?) are continuing as you know, and 
I'm famous for this - that I will never give up. So don't worry. 
Nobody will attack me, nobody will fire me, we should cool down. 
I will leave Germany in around two hours to go to the United 
States. I will have Sunday night already the first dinner with 
the new president, which is Tom Schmidt, and then I will know, 
of course, a lot more than today when I'm getting all the facts 
and how it will be continued.
{p} {p}
Because, dear Amigans, we will have a future. We will have a 
bright future. And some things happen. Especially the US companies 
and I remember when I worked for Commodore there was always a 
lot of going and coming. Nevertheless,  we have to keep what's 
going on.
{p} {p}
I'm really sad, not only because Jim Collas is gone, I'm also 
sad because I could not fly to Finland as last year, which was 
really great for me. I was really excited to go and see you 
and to give all these giveaways personally, from my bag to your 
hand. But I know that Janne (one of the organisers of the Saku 
show - CD), who is really an excellent organiser, will assist 
me, will give all the presents which I brought which I sent 
to him. I hope also that the demonstration of the OS3.5 will 
work proper and you will enjoy and you will see that we are 
really serious with everything.
{p} {p}
The OS3.5 will be ready for sale end of September and we are 
now in plan. As you know, we have had a little bit of delay. 
Officially we would like to announce the OS3.5 in Canberra, 
what we have done, but not with a final version but with a 
pre-release. But that's okay.
{p} {p}
Now we are in planning and sales will start end of September, 
for sure.
{p} {p}
I'm also quite sure that the new development on the MCC will 
continue. Maybe there will be a delay, I don't know. But I will 
let you know as soon as I'm back. This will be next week, on 
Thursday, and I'm quite sure that when I talk with my US 
colleagues that we can also put an announcement - an official 
announcement - on our web site, and we can start then also 
communication.
{p} {p}
So I can promise you, what I can do for Amiga I will continue 
to do. I need your support, also for the future and I hope to 
see you soon, maybe the next big convention (which) is in 
Cologne, as you may know, on the 14th and 15th of November 
and I will be glad to see some Finnish guests there.
{p} {p}
So thank you very much for your attention, thank you very much 
for your understanding, and I only can repeat myself - please, 
do not panic. We will survive. Thank you.
{p} {p}
(applause)
