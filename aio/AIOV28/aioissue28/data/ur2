HTTPResume is a program that let's you continue on interupted HTTP downloads. Quite
a lifesaver sometimes...
{p} {p}
HTTPResume is VERY easy to install, just copy it somewhere on your HD and off you go!
{p} {p}
After the very brief installtion, HTTPResume is ready to go, just start it and you
will see a GadTools interface, maybee not that good looking, but the looks ain't all!
There isn't really any configuration needed (unless your in need for a proxy)... So
everyone will be able to use it without any problems at all... There is ofcourse many
things you can configure, if you feel the need for it.. A couple of nice features is
that you can set the lowest CPS allowed, and if it goes beneath that limit, it will
stop the download, and then automatically resume again.. Thus making it download the
file alot faster...
{p} {p}
Also, there is no need for you to remember any URLs, it will take the URL out of the
filecomment for the file that you choosed... That is if the program you used to
download the file at the first time has that nice feature, and all Amiga programs
usually do.
{p} {p}
HTTPResume has 11 ARexx commands, so you can control it from within a script if you
like!
{p} {p}
It also comes with a nice layouted Guide, which will guide you through any problem
that might come up in a very nice and easy to understand way.
