Fuelling many peoples belief that the IWin Amiga compatible computers
are hoaxes, IWin has announced that they will not be communicating with
the public until the shipment of their products.  This came immediately
after Amiga Inc announced something similar, although while Amiga Inc
has had major changes since, IWin have released only some pictures of
their offices and a few short answers to questions asked in the Amiga
newsgroups.
