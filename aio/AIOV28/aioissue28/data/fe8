Well, you may have noticed that I ran out of ideas for the DOpus
Tutorial series, but that series spawned an idea, and this new column 
is the result.
{p} {p}
Hints And Tips shall be a column for the posting of any such little
nuggets of information about the use of a particular program or tips on
how to get that extra little bit of performance out of that troublesome
software.
{p} {p}
Got a hint or tip for a utility, Game, or any other software? Then just
email in and I'll see it posted here. Got one of those small niggling
problems you can't seem to solve (and think the answer might be useful
to others out there)? Then email in your problem and I'll try and get it
answered.

So, for a hint or tip, either asking or giving, then just email me at:

{bold}This month's tip:{nobold}{p}
To clear up confusion about when True Color screens will lock up when
text (like menus) is displayed on them, here's  the solution. For 
Cybergraphics at least, these lock ups only ocur on 24-bit Interlaced 
screens. (like 1024X768 on my system). Any other 24-bit screens will 
operate flawlessly, and even the 24-bit Interlaced ones will still be 
good for picture viewing and anything not involving text overlay (like 
menus, text buttons, etc). Just don't use 24-bit Interlaced screens for 
anything that will have text written over it.

Until next month...
