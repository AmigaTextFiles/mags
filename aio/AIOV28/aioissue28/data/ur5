MP3-TagEd is yet another MP3 ID3 Tag Editor tool... A MP3 ID3 Tag Editor is a program
that can edit the information that is stored in the MP3s, the name, group etc...
{p} {p}
MP3-TagEd comes with a standard AmigaDOS installer script, so it's VERY easy to
install... But it wasn't really nessecery to have the script, because the only
installation needed is to copy a lib to libs: and the program to some place, but
still, it's a nice thing which I think every program should have.

When you start MP3-TagEd, you will get a little interface (GadTools) which will
let you to easily load and edit MP3's... It looks like this:

{image gfx/AIO_MP3-TagEd.IFF}

As you see, all the options from the main window is self explanable, so I won't
take up your time by describing what it can do... But I will move over to the prefs
windows and tell you the other options it has...
{p} {p}
It can set the filecomments of all the MP3's in many different ways, it has some
things that you can choose from (namely 16 of them), like SongName, artist, Album,
Length etc... It can also convert spaces in the filename to underscores, very nice,
when taking into the account that the Amiga doesn't handle spaces in filenames very
well.. Another nice thing is that you don't have to load each MP3 by hand, you can
load a playlist, like one you created in AmigaAMP or such program... Another thing
you can do is to have a default MP3 TAG format, very nice if you have some fields
in the tags that always should be the same.
{p} {p}
There is some limitations in the unregistered version, you can't Save nor delete
the TAGs... But that shouldn't be a problem since the keyfile is FREE!!
{p} {p}
If there is something you don't understand in the program, you can always read the
Guide that it comes with, it doesn't explain everything that deeply, but enough to
make you understand how to use the different options...
