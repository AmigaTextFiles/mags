Well, I almost didn't make it this month. My computer was out for 4
and a half weeks, and only got it back up and running again just two
days before the deadline! By the time I'd gotten caught up on my 1006
email, that left just the next day to get anything out. 1 day for my
articles section- oh Horrors!
{p} {p}
But fear not, loyal reader! An impossible task you say?  Not if there's
an intact bone left in these labored over-worked typewritten hands!
{p} {p}
Well, enough of that. Now on to what little gems I've managed to
find...
{p} {p}
{bold}Driveways Of The Rich And Famous{nobold}{p}
{link http://www.driveways.com}http://www.driveways.com{end}
{p} {p}
A "why-bother" site that's turned into a major database thanks to the
obviously otherwise none-existent life of it's webmaster, here you can
view photos from a long list of driveways for the homes of movie stars,
rich people, and other notables. Enough to satisfy that nosy-snoop
urge in you. Check out Bill Gates' driveway; it looks like a security
gate to some secret government installation.

Know someone with bad breath? Or dandruff or who talks too much?  Don't
know how to handle it? Well, let someone else do it for you?  You
select the type of problem (dandruff, facial hair on women, etc.), and a
diplomatically-worded letter is sent to the person, you presence being
completely annonymous, telling the person that someone who cares for
them wants them to know something and could they please correct their
problem. Along with the letter is sent a representative item: an
egg-timer for her who talks too much, a nose hair trimmer if that's the
problem, a book on table manners for such, etc. Of course there's a fee
attached with each service (commercial service site here), but I thought
it was worth a look through anyway.

Hmm, I wonder if they have an entry for Chief Editors paying actual
money to his editors...{p}
[-ed Ahh, its lucky i'm not a Chief Editor then!]
{p} {p}
{bold}Learn2{nobold}{p}
{link http://www.learn2.com}http://www.learn2.com{end}
{p} {p}
An on-line how-to site that covers everything from automotive, to
picking catelope to how to get rid of bats. The entries are all
categorized and you can even email in your specific problem, or a
solution to someone else's problem. Useful info complete with colour
pictures and diagrams. Bookmark this one under "consult when needed".

{bold}Blindside reviews{nobold}{p}
{link http://www.blindsidereviews.com}http://www.blindsidereviews.com{end}
{p} {p}
The name says it all; movie reviews by a blind guy. Gives some
amusing perspectives on things he can only hear, though it's interesting
how he manages to pick up so many details from a medium he can only half
enjoy.

{bold}Pick Of The Month{nobold}
{p} {p}
{bold}Funone{nobold}{p}

{p} {p}
Now here's a fun site to find after all my computer miseries, and I bet
you're going to enjoy it too. This site just has so many fun things
about it that making it a Pick Of The Month was the only was to review
it properly.
{p} {p}
First we have the jokes. You can sign up to have a joke mailed to you
every Monday and/or every Friday. The perfect way to start or end the
week. The jokes are pretty funny too.
{p} {p}
Next we have the Fun Pages, one for each significant holiday of the
year. Holloween, Saint Patrick's Day, New Years, all have their own page
with some fun messages on them. If that isn't enough, there's Fun Pages
for everyday use. Net Cops, Cyber Tag,test for Y2K Compliant people,
Millenium Moon, and more.
{p} {p}
Just looking down the sidebar menu will keep you busy. Greeting Cards,
free fun stuff, Games (Java may be needed), On-Line Polls, and more.
Enough to keep you busy for quite a while.
{p} {p}
Still not enough? There's a suggestion box where you can tell him what
you want. Definitely a fun place to stop by.
{p} {p}
As for me, I think I'll  sign up for the Monday and Friday weekly jokes.
