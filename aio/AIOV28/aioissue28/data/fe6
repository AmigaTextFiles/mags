 TO:	THE AMIGA COMMUNITY
{p} {p}
Thanks for your notes and comments about our plans for Amiga.  In the
past couple weeks, we've received hundreds --  if not thousands -- of
emails and messages from loyal Amigans worldwide, many of you
expressing a concern about Amiga's future based on recent reports in
the media and in numerous chat rooms. I am so impressed with the
spirit and passion of this great community and I wanted to make sure
I told you that.
{p} {p}
The fact is... to borrow from Mark Twain... the reports of Amiga's
death have been greatly exaggerated. To that end, I wanted to provide
a little more detail about our plans for Amiga... both as a product
and as a company, and hopefully clear up any confusion that exists.
{p} {p}
First, I hope you'd agree that Amiga was never about a box. It was
never about an operating system either. Sure those things were part
of what made the original Amiga great, but at its heart, Amiga was
simply about a better way.  Amiga was ahead of its time. Amiga
promised to change the world.  It ran against conventional wisdom and
was better than anything out there at the time. In fact, we could all
argue that it's still better than anything out there.
{p} {p}
The ideals and spirit of that original Amiga are alive and well
today.  But to limit Amiga to just one box, one product, one OS, is
to keep Amiga from ever seeing its full potential. Think about it....
The original Amiga never did really reach its full potential despite
its technical advantages and its cost and ease of use advantages.
Why? Because it never became ubiquitous. The company's early vision
was probably too limited for the vast potential that Amiga offered.
{p} {p}
The original Amiga was all about multi-media, so why not have Amiga
running on every type of device imaginable, on top of every other  OS
out there? That's the beauty of Amiga and where we are as an
industry. We're in the midst of a revolution unlike anything the
world has seen, and Amiga has never been better positioned to change
that world and make a bigger impact. Limiting Amiga to just one box
and one OS at this point would be like offering the world a better
horse and carriage at the dawn of the automotive age. Amiga and its
revolutionary spirit deserve better than that. Amiga is going to
produce software technology that will enable Internet services on an
emerging category of products commonly referred to as "Information
Appliances". It is an exciting new mega trend in the industry and we
are excited about being at the forefront of this next great wave in
computing history. In addition, we have decided to work with business
partners who will deliver our software technology on their systems,
rather than enter the hardware business directly.
{p} {p}
So long live Amiga, but if you think that Amiga was just a box,
you've missed the point. Amiga is about a better way. In the coming
weeks and months, we promise to keep you posted on progress against
our plans for Amiga, and we thank you for your continued support.
Let's work together to enable Amiga to revolutionize the industry and
change the world!

Long live Amiga,
