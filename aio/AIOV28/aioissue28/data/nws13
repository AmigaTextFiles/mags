This is just a short release note about akMPEG2 V3.00,
that's now available on my homepage.
{p} {p}
It's not only extremely fast now, but also quite compact:
the 8 players (4x68k, 4xPPC) have been merged into now only
2 remaining executeables, which brings the archive size
down to only ~120 KB. Looping now is possible as well.

There also shouldn't be (m)any bugs left ;)
