You may be wondering what the heck STSCCHQ Turbo stands for, well this game
has been made by one of those author/s that think they are quite funny
with a 'wacky' game title, to me its just stupid and has been done many
times before but anyway it stands for, Super Tactical Strike Command and
Commando's Head Quarter Turbo.

A game title like that either means the game isn't serious about it
self or it is utter rubbish. This game is a mixture of both, the graphics
aren't exactly outstanding and it doesn't really have an exciting idea
or any exciting plot to it. One thing I do like about the game is it
is a bit of a challenge although this can also make it seem a bit boring
after a while.

The basic idea of the game is to dodge different items. At first you dodge
just one item that comes towards you for a certain length time and then
as the levels progress you have more and more objects to stay out the
way of.

The game on the first few levels is quite easy but I found it impossible
by the time the last level came round. The game does say that you should
stick at it to see the amusing end game but I couldn't get past the last
level so I'm unsure if the end of game is amusing or not. Maybe you can
tell me?

Overall its a pretty basic game, its not something I would recommend
but if you've got it on the AF CD then you may aswell take a look.
