 Eplayer... basicly is a mod or med player. Well that means it'll
play any mod and Protracker, Noisetracker and Soundtracker accourding
to the documents, don't shoot me if some don't work but it all
went nicely for me. The interface is very nice although an iconify
button is missing, you can hide it but it would have been nice to
see an iconify button, maybe in the next version ay lads?!

 Play, stop, pause, hide and copy, yes they are all there, but whats
this copy you are asking? it copys your mod to another destination,
don't even ask me why this is included because I can't really tell
you but it maybe helpful...to...erm....a madman!?!? Yes it does
have a timer aswell, would it be a music player without one?

 The feature i most enjoyed which is a rare feature in most music
players is if you have an lha or lzx archive and you can't be bothered
unarc'ing them the music player will do it for you and then automatically
play the music it finds inside, cool or what eh??? There is even a
little volume bar which can higher or lower the volume duh!

 At 40k this music player is a steal, it has some great little features 
especially the auto dearch feature. Maybe in future versions we could
see an iconify button, MUI support and even a couple more music filetypes
like XM etc.
