 I like mods, you like mods, LOADS of people must like mods or there 
wouldn't be so many of the little b'stard's about ( hell even i throw
the odd one out now and then ).

 Thing about music modules is that it just ain't practical to open up  
octamed to play med/tracker tunes and then digibooster to listen 
to some more of ya music colly ;( and thats where hippoplayer 
comes in.

 Now there are some other mod players about like deli-tracker which
is a VERY good mod player but  i found it to be cumbersome and 
memory intensive. 

 HiPPO player features a small but perfectly formed frontend which
i have sitting in the corner of my workbench permanently.
 One of hippo's finest features is the hipposcope, it can be changed
into all manner of weird scopes n bars, Even a four channel mini
tracker screen so you can see the mod play before your eye's.

 The buttons are of the usual kind ... play,stop,fwd,eject etc etc 
there are also a good little prefs menu letting you change all manner
of things such as random play , hippos display ,playing, and all the 
startup options. Support for PS3M and ahi is there too.

 I find the best use to be for anyone who spends more than 5 mins at a time
on there 'puter sYSOPS , nET nUTS , lAMERS and even gAMERS , just select 
all ya favorite mods using {add} and save themout to a program ( playlist
to you and me ;) using ya rMB on {prg} and let the aural feast commence!
and if ya get bored with the current mod just rmb on the play button to
randomly select a tune. And it plays med, tracker, xm, and digibooster
mods and probably a few different formats i cant lay my hands on at the mo.

final comment :- u wanna play mods on ya workbench.? gET HIPPOPLAYER.
