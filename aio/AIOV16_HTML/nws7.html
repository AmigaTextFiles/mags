<font color="#ffffff"> World Of Amiga Show 1999 Announced<font color="#000000">

 It has now been confirmed that there will be a UK World Of Amiga show in
1999! Work is well underway on the 1999 show, although the date and venue
has yet to be confirmed. There is already a great deal of excitement for
the show which will play a major part in the rejuvenation of the Amiga
during 1999. As Peter Brameld, Organiser of the World Of Amiga show
stated, &quot;We MUST take the Amiga into the Millenium&quot;.
Linking in with this, and following the untimely closure of CU Amiga, the
official web site of the World Of Amiga show has found a new home and is
fully operational NOW! The site is being operated and managed for World of
Amiga by Infinite Frontiers, publishers of the new Amiga fanzine, Amiga
Energy.

For more information on the show, contact Peter Brameld at
