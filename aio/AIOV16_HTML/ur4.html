<font color="#ffffff"> Mini CD Player V1.2<font color="#000000">

 Another music player this month following the earlier two but this one 
is for Audio CD's and not modules like the previous reviews.  Being able 
to play Audio CD's while using your Amiga is something that everyone 
should beable to do and it should be accessable to everyone, with a CD-Rom 
that is.

 There are already a few good Audio Cd players around at the moment but 
they all give fancy options, are big and clog up space on the screen 
which can become annoying and irritating. MiniCD V1.2 solves this problem 
by having the smallest CD interface todate, it sits right in your top right 
hand corner just before the multitask wb button, yes you did hear correctly, 
it sits on the very top most white bar. There is no border round it, just a 
few tiny buttons to be clicked on. Play, stop, pause, eject and a timer 
and track number gauge. When you eject a CD the buttons will disappear 
until you re-insert a new one. Considering the buttons are so tiny the 
main program is quite big for a CD player at 57k. When you think that 
PlayCD is only a mere 17k and has a great interface with the MUI CD player 
just a little bigger than MiniCD at 62k. So saying that MiniCD is small 
in screen space it is big in executable size.

 Overall if your looking for something that can tuck away under the rug/mat 
so to speak this maybe what you've been searching for, I found it a bit to 
small rather like I was going to break it if i pressed to hard!
