<font color="#ffffff"> Snake game by NC.Gamez<font color="#000000">

 The second snake game reviewed this month is SnakeFW from NC.gamez
The idea of snake is to eat the dots, in this game they are numbers
starting from 1 going up to 9 and then it's onto the next level. Eat
a number and your score jumps up but then it starts declining in 1's
until your score is empty, so the idea is eat more before your score
hits zero.

 Your points are past on to the next level but will still go down until
you have none left so it is up to you to eat the next number as quick
as you can to get the highest score. The more levels you pass the harder
they get with walls and other things placed on your way, I only managed
to get to level 3 without dieing.

 This game is quite addictive considering its only a basic snake game,
its simple but it will keep you entertained, the graphics may not be
much but they do the job and the excellent sound will keep you going for
hours.
