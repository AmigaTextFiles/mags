<font color="#ffffff"> Virus Z Pre III V1.44<font color="#000000">

 VirusZ is a long running virus checker for the Amiga and has now become
one of the best available for the Amiga today along with Virus Checker.
Although there are not as many viruses being made on the Amiga now due
to the smaller userbase its always best to be protected, you never know
when an old virus could pop up or another new one is written. 

 It is always good to see the release of a new virus killer as you know
your computer can't be harmed by any new viruses namely the new ones
being the Happy New Year viruses that spring up each year causing havok
to alot of people, luckly VirusZ has been keeping tabs on the yearly
virus and will now kill the versions from 96 to 98 and probably 99 when
the year comes.

 The new features are as follows :

Changes/Additions since 1.43:
&#009;- Added XVS version string to about request just like in VZ III.
&#009;  Debugging is easier that way, idea by Jan Andersen.
&#009;- Changed status to FREEWARE for the near future.

 A nice thing to see is the status FREEWARE on VirusZ, its good to know
that the programmers of the Amiga are offering something free and i'm
glad its a top notch virus checker like this one.

 A program no one can do without, everyone should get hold of this right
this instant, remember to download it from the official web page stated
below to be sure of real versions.
