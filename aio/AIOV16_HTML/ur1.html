 Ah what a GODSEND this thing is, I cannot imagine what life would 
be like without it.

 File id ex is basically a program that will let you create a text file
containing all the file id's from whatever dir/file you selected.

 Now if your like me you'll have a download dir as full as a very full
thing! And (like me) you NEVER clean it out..... SO what the hell do you
do when you know a file you want is in there but ya just cant find it..?

Create a nice dir list (just like u see on a bbs).

 The program itself is simple enough to use, Just scan [YOUR DIR] then
create the file list. It will then trawl thru the files for any file id's
and save em to a text file.

 Once done it will ask if you wanna clear the filelist and also tell 
you if it couldn't find any diz's. 

 You can sort the files by Name or Date and also include seperators 
to make the resulting file list's easier to read and wildcards are 
included.

 File id extractor supports lha/lzx/zip/txt files and in my 
oppinion it's a MUST have for lazy/untidy (u know who u r) people ;)
Its Nice/Useful/user friendly, What MORE d'YA want!
