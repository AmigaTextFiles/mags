`---------------------------------------------------------------------------'

After   extensive   research   and  planning,  SoloTrek  III  is  finally  in
development. The release date is tentatively scheduled for December 1998.

SoloTrek  featured an 8X8 galaxy with six levels of play.  You had no options
of alliance, you were the Federation.  The graphics were minimal,  but it was
still difficult to beat level six.

SoloTrek II  featured a 16X16 galaxy.  You could choose one of five alliances
and six difficulty levels. There were good graphics and sounds. Level six was
still almost impossible to beat, especially without a save option.

SoloTrek III features a 20X20 main galaxy, with a 10X10 secondary galaxy.  The
graphic interface has been improved and graphic display has been enhanced with
digitized pics of  everything possible.  You're back to being the  Federation,
but there's more than enough to keep you busy as it is.

The biggest addition  to the game is the module approach.  The galaxy, hailing
messages, events, planets and missions are all based on external script files.
This means that new games can be developed to run on the SoloTrek III engine.

The Galaxy
20X20 with a 10X10 linked section

The Hailing Messages
No more yes or no messages.  Each hailing message appears only  once in a game
session  and  each  message  can have up to  four  different  responses.  Each
response means different results.

Events
Events can now have much  more dire  results for  your ship.  As with  Hailing
Messages, Events only happen once per game session.

Planets
Along  with the  standard random  Class M  planets, specific  planets dot  the
galaxies. They can be  either fixed,  like Earth  at sector  001, or  randomly
placed.

Missions
No longer simple exploration and  combat for  you, Captain.  There are several
missions to be completed as well.  Some are  as simple  as finding  a Dominion
Outpost and destroying it. Some are more complex, asking you to find items and
take them to specific locations.

Starbases
Like the planets, Starbases can  be  randomly  placed,  or  fixed.  Just  like
SoloTrek II, not all Starbases will be friendly to you.

Save Game
Praise Emperor Kayless! Finally, you don't have to take on the whole galaxy in
one sitting.

Hidden Items
Q, lovable Q, still shows up to pester you.  The Borg are not going to give up
any time soon either. Three new `arcade games' have been added to show up from
time to time and annoy you.

Your Ship
You start out with a Runabout  (Level 6)  and must work your way up  to bigger
and better  ships.  Get your  `Federation Factor'  high enough  and you'll  be
promoted and given a new command. Or, you bloodthirsty types can take on enemy
ships to plunder them for latinum to buy new ships.

Timeline
Used to taking  your time?  Not  any more, Space  Jockey!  There's a  timeline
running;  if you don't get the situation under control,  it will get you under
its control.

Modules
The first module, included with SoloTrek III, will be `The Dominion War'.  The
timeline is running and  the Dominion  is playing  for keeps.  Grab your mouse
and get the galaxy back  under control.  You  can even  make it  to the  Gamma
Quadrant.
