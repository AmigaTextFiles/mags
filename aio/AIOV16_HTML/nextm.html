<font color="#ffffff"> Next Months Issue<font color="#000000">

 Next month we'll be having a special interview with Peter McGavin, the
person who brought us ADoom, the first amiga doom port, who we all should
be very grateful to! Hopefully now the JUST-AMiGA mailing list is up and
was started by AIO we'll see more readers reviews, articles and news. The
AIO web page currently has had 200+ visits in 1 weeks time so I would
like to thanks everyone who has visited. We will also be bringing you the
most up-to-date reviews and news.

Issue 17 out : October 24th 1998 (Aprx)
