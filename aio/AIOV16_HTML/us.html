<font color="#ffffff"> Utils reviews and what there score means<font color="#000000">

 Utils are not marked on how good they are compared to other utils,
they are marked by usefulness and what purpose they serve. As there
are so many different utils that do so many different things it is
hard to review something like MUI and then when reviewing a program
like a WB clock say it wasn't up to the standard of MUI. This is why
it is not possible to have a Top Ten list for utils.

 90%+    -  AIO GOLD (amazing)

 70-89%  -  Great but lacking some features

 50-69%  -  Not to good but it'll do

 30-49%  -  Hasn't really been thought out to well

 0-29%   -  POOR! AVOID!
