<font color="#ffffff"> Disadvantages and Advantages of MPeg<font color="#000000">

 MPeg has recently hit the amiga in a big way, up until a few years ago
things that where just not possible are now possible thanks to a few
dedicated programmers and Amiga believers.

 There are two different types of mpeg that you can use on the amiga,
the first is video mpeg and the second is music mpegs. Firstly we
will take a look at video mpeg. Video mpeg is many pictures compacted
together in a way so it is small enough to show short clips of film.
Although i say small a 300 picture piece lasting for about 20 seconds
can take up well over a meg of space... with todays big HD sizes you
may think that a meg isn't that much space but when you think of the
length the actual film is going to be it all adds up and would be quite
big in total. Mpeg video isn't all that good either on the fastest pc
with mmx or an Amiga, the best I have seen a PC do with a top of the
range technology is only good quality but it a tiny postage stamp window 
and if the PC with its 300mhz technology can only do that then the 
'classic' range of Amigas has no chance. The basic Amiga you will need is 
at least and A1200 030 with about 8meg, you could maybe get away with 
6meg but i'm unsure about that, anything less and it isn't even worth 
entertaining the idea. If you have an 030 Amiga watching mpeg clips can 
be fun to see with the novelty of short film on your amiga, I don't see 
any real purpose for mpeg video as the amount of film you actually get 
to see is very short and takes up masses of space. The quality on the 
Amiga is less than pleasing also, the picture update is jerky, the window 
is small and the actual picture quality is rubbish. I would recommend 
missing mpeg videos out, they can be a fun experience at first until 
the novelty wears off and you find there isn't much use.

 Next we come to mpeg music and this is a totally different ball game,
the basic set up would be about an A1200, 030, 8meg, if you have an
020 the songs won't play correctly and they will practically be useless.
If you have an 030 then your in for a real treat. Although mpeg music
files are usually around 3meg for one song the rewards they bring normally
out-weigh the size factor. For playing mpeg music you will have to download
mpega which can be found on the aminet and various other places. Mpeg
music saves you buying a song or lets you hear it before you buy it,
there is the big question to whether the piece of music is copyrighted
so always be sure you know what your letting yourself in for.

 Overall Mpeg music is really worth looking into but movie clips are
so bad quality you may as well give them a miss. If you have any comments
or further questions about mpeg music or video send your question into 
the usual addresses.
