<font color="#ffffff"> Games reviews and what there score means<font color="#000000">

 Games are reviewed mostly on playability and how long they will last
you, although some big games with fancy graphics might be expected to
get good reviews it is not always the case. A small 10k game might
get a better overall score than a 1Mb game. It is not that the 1Mb
game isn't any good it's just that the playablility might be non
exsistant and there is no point in downloading a huge file if it
will last a couple of minutes and you will only run it to show off
to friends.

 90%+    -  AIO GOLD (amazing)

 70-89%  -  Nice but some let downs

 50-69%  -  Not to good but it'll do

 30-49%  -  Hasn't really been thought out to well

 0-29%   -  POOR! AVOID!
