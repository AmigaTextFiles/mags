<font color="#ffffff"> Points about new Amigas<font color="#000000">

 Since May 1998 I have been reading many letters to the CuAmiga and
Amiga Format and heard countless amounts of people moaning that
Amiga Inc are making the new Amiga solely based upon PC hardware
even though Amiga Inc did not say this. It seems to me most people
heard that the bridge system would be based on PC hardware and then
completely ignored what was announced after that.

 Lets get it straight that it is only the bridge system that will be
using PC hardware and the main reason for this is so the new Amiga
will be released with an existing software base giving people more
incentive to buy the new Amigas. If they released a new Amiga onto
the public without and software for it it would fail instantly,
look at the way the Sega Saturn went and the way the N64 is going
with hardly any software support but the Sony Playstation with 300+
games is doing great business and sales are booming. How can software
companies produce high quality software on our existing Amigas to be
used with a high powered Amiga? that would be stupid and the quality
of the software would only beable to match that of an 060 'Classic'
Amiga as that is the highest standard they will be able to go upto.
You have to get it into your head that the PC at current has the
better hardware in the fact that it is the most powerful and can
handle things quicker. So give software houses a fast PC as a bridge
system and they can make better utilities and games up to the standard
of the best PC system so when the new Amiga comes out they can then
push up the standards again with the PC beating technology and the users
will be happy with there current software base and then again in a few
months be suprised when they see the top standard of the new Amigas.

 I hope I have made this more clear to alot of users who seemed to think
that Amiga Inc where taking a PC and slapping Amiga on the front and
then selling it. The bridge system won't be that readily available
to most of the public so it won't effect us anyway really, it will
just allow better software for the new Amigas.
