<font color="#ffffff"> Amiga gets Z<font color="#000000">

 The PC c&amp;c style game titled just 'Z' will now be coming to the Amiga
thanks to clickBOOM. It was originally started by the Bitmap Brothers
but after a while they decided they wouldn't beable to make the Amiga
version good enough for release so clickBOOM are now finishing the
project. The bitmap brothers had the success of Speedball 1 and 2,
Chaos Engine and Gods on the Amiga with Chaos Engine 2 being there
last release.
