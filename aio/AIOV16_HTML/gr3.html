<font color="#ffffff"> The Lost Island<font color="#000000">

 Boy, haven't the Engine 9 Design team been busy recently, two games
and a util all in one issue! Well enough of that and on with the
review. The idea of TLI is that you have to escape from the maze/island
to proceed to the next maze/island, as the story goes you have been
trapped on various islands by Mr Psycho who has given you a time limit
to get off them before you die. The view is sort of an isomentric
view but not exactly, you move your player about which is quite well
drawn trying to find the purple square to escape, you can only move
on the grey and brown squares with the green being grass or something
and there is also water and some red stuff.

 For each level you have a timer which goes down while you rush around
franticly trying to excape from your doom. I didn't seem to be to
successful as I couldn't even manage to get off the first level and 
became dissolutioned and disorientated after a while when every place
I went looked the same, grey blocks everywhere, was i going mad? Well
obviously not and after a while i made the man dance to the music
by moving left and right.... hmm maybe the game made me a little mad.

 Overall a great little game, if you can't find the exit you'll probably
go mad like me and become extremely annoyed but if you do you'll be
a happy chappy. Get it, its good!
