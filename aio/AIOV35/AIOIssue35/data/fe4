Well, the Amiga show has come and gone and with it many reports from in
the field.  Cutting past all the opinions and assorted points of view,
here then are the raw facts that I've gleaned from the various reports.

{bold}Developer System:{nobold}
The developer system will be based on a K6-2 500MHz, with 64MB RAM, Geforce 256 from nVidia for it's Graphics
Processor Unit in place of the original Amiga custom chips, Linux and Elate.  The Tao OS will
run on top of Red Hat Linux.  This is meant to be an inexpensive system that
will get the job done for developers, allowing them to run the various
developer tools available on the PC side.

The final consumer system will be pure Amiga and out before the end of
the year.  etails will depend on what the developers decide on. It will
provide JAVA and Linux a common interface, extensible enough to run on
anything from cell phones to servers.  The new OS will be able to run on
x86, PPC, MIPS, ARM, SH4, and some soon to be announced mnegaCHIPS. The
new GUI will be designed by Trond Werner Hansen, the maker of Birdie.
