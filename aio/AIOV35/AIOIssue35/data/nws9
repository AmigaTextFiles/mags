The Amiga compatible BoXeR motherboard has been bought out by
AntiGravity, the former US distributor. No word has been given on a
release date, but from previous information it should be any time
soon.

AntiGravity also launched an attack on the Open Amiga Foundation
and Open Source in general on their website, comparing them to
Communism in a factually bad essay. Also this isn't known for
certain, it seems AntiGravity appear not to want to support AROS,
Linux or other free software, which would limit the BoXeR's use
considerably unless they are provided seperately via reverse
engineered hardware information.
