April, Spring is in full swing (well, Fall for Australia, I guess, but
isn't that just Spring in reverse?), easter is upon us, and there's a
whole bunch of onliners looking for Easter Eggs of the more online
variety. With that in mind, try these out...
{p} {p}
{p} {p}
The Easter Egg Archive[p}
http://www.eeggs.com{p}
About the closest I'm ever going to get in the way of easter eggs for
this column, these are the types of easter eggs that occurr in movies,
TV, books, computer programs, and the like; little amusing tidbits
hidden by their creators for others to find if looked for carefully
enough.  Here the eggs are categorized by type- movies, TV, computers,
and more. Literally a few thousand eggs posted, and a place for you to
submit your own easter eggs for the collection. A lot more fun then the
colored ones you find lying along the ground.
{p} {p}
The Slip-Ups Archive{p}
http://www.slipups.com{p}
The companion site to the above, the difference being that slip-ups are
unintentional mistakes or bloopers, in movies, TV, books, or things that
famous people actually said in speeches or statements.  About a couple
thousand (most of them in movies) entries that proves that fallibility
seems more common then realiability.

Amiga CD32 Source{p}
http://website.lineone.net/~cd32{p}
A good site to bookmark for all you people still with workjing CD32s.
Lists of all the games, both released and unreleased, available
expansions, system specs, cheats, and available programs on Aminet.
There's even some stuff on the CDTV.
{p} {p}
The Amiga Clinic{p}
http://www.amiga-clinic.com{p}
A nice all around Amiga diagnosis site, presented in the form of a
clinic. The information here will help you diagnose and cure all your
software and hardware ills, or you can email the presiding doctor for
more specific help. You can download some software to help you fix some
of your problems (disk repair, anti-virus, patches, etc.), research past
Amiga problems that might be similar to your own, or read up on both
basic information or specs specific to your model of Amiga. If you have
a problem then check here first.

Pick Of The Month
{p} {p}
The Willy Wonka Candy Factory{p}
http://www.wonka.com{p}
Wondering what to keep the kids busy with on Easter?  Or just an old fan
of Willy Wonka and a kid at heart? well, here's the site for both
problems. Done up in the style of our favorite WonkMeister, it is
bright and colorfully drawn with a consistent cartoonish theme all
throughout. Plenty of stuff to keep one bussy for a while, it is geared
for kids but with the expected adds and enticements for Wonka Candy
psrinkled throughout. Fortunately, the people at Wonka are thoughtful
enough to provide an animated icon to indicate which ones are adverts.
{p} {p}
First you come to the WONKAvator, your lead-in to any place in the site.
The expected page to console parents that their kidss' souls aren't
being sold the the candy-devil, a help page to tell you what you need to
know, and then links to spring you throughout the site. They also note
in the Helpo section to look for a special icon, that if clicked on will
transport you to a random page of the site.
{p} {p}
Jokes Of The Day are submitted by the kids that see this site, complete
with credit given. Then we have Planet Vermes, the main games section.
From WONKAnoid Breakout Game to SPace rescue, the games have the one
advantage of not requiing that nasty Java stuff but {bold}do{nobold}
require a Shockwave plugin of the type for applications/x-director, a
flavor for which the new Voyager Shock plugin is not built for. So,
break out those emulators or start writing Vapor for more plugins.
{p} {p}
Wonkavision is where you can see videos of your favorite Wonka
characters, as well as two additional games; Technology Trivia, and
TechnOlympics. Again, Shock is required.
{p} {p}
In Candy Garden, you can send a Wonkagram to anyone else- read as:
on-line greetiung card. The Secret Candy link is little more then an
advert for their newest candy cloaked in a multi-page clue-fest.
{p} {p}
Wall-paper abounds at different locations- read-as backdrops of the
right size for tiling. Just download them in PC format, change the
file's extension from ".exe" to ".zip" and you're set to unarc the BMP
file. A few amusing ones, all Wonka-themed cartoons.
{p} {p}
WonkaSchool has some stufff that actually doesn't require Shockwave.
How-it-works links about varying subjects, the fact of the day, giving
information about some intersting piece of learing; in the case of when
I was there it was about Niagra Falls, but I assume it varies. The
Library gives a review of a chosen kids book, geared to getting the
youngster interested enough to go check it out at their local library.
{p} {p}
Loompaland is basically another excuse for Shockwaved games such as
Animal Mix-ups, andAnimal Trivia (a definite jungle theme, here).
{p} {p}
Finally, the obligatory WonkaStore, though they make a point of
forbiding anyone under 18 years of age from entering since they are not
allowed to sell to kids over the Net. Nice of them, but you just know
the kids will be dragging their parents straight across the room.
{p} {p}
A nice place to keep your kids, or kid at heart, busy during those off
times waiting for grandpa to arrive for Easter dinner. A definite
favoritism towards MAC and PCs until an Amiga Browser gets the right
plugin, but hey, a good site is still a good site.
