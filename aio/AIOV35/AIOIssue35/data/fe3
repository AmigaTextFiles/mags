This first tip comes from a recent solution to a longtime problem of mine
that I hadn't realised was abnormal. YAM for me hafd always been slow on
opening up most windows, grinding away with the hard drive before even
certain preferences windows came up. Recently I came to posting it to
the YAM newsgroup and the obvious soslution of SnoopDos was mentioned.
Some checking later and, while opening up a YAM window, I see SnoopDos
fill up with page after page of failed attempts at opening up a font
called just ".font" at a size of zero.

Checking into MUI preferences, I'd found a coiuple of the font fields
(most notably Betterstring) had been left blank.  Apparently MUI doesn't
take too well to internal defaults for things like font fields left
blank. So, I filled in that and every font fields with something and
restarted. Result? YAM now brings all windows up in an instant.{p}
So this tip is, when using MUI, fill in your system-wide defaults
{italics}completely{noitalics}, leave nothing blank or you'll get to
watch your MUI apps slow down rather drastically. It's surprising what a
difference it makes.

While we're on the subject of YAM, if you're finding it's taking it's
own sweet time coming up it just may be a file called ".uidl".  This is
the file that helps YAM not download repeated messages- the longer it is
the longer your program will take to start. Just thin it out every so
often, deleting all but the last couple of lines from it. Better yet,
if you have YAM set to delete mail from the server after downloading
them then you can turn off the "avoid repeats" option altogether and not 
have to worry about ".uidl".

A quick one regarding Voyager. If you group your Bookmarks in successive 
layers of groups then you may run across a little quirk that version 3.x 
has when importing Bookmark from version 2.x. If you have two sub-groups
with the same name, even if they're both under vastly different groups, 
V3 will lump the second occurance in with the first and make hash of 
everything that came after that. Solution? Just make sure that
{bold}all{nobold} of your group and subgroup names are unique. In my
case I had one group labeled "News" for news sites, and another "News" 
under internet software support sites. Took me a while to figure out
what was going on.
