If you've ever played a serious F1 simulator (such as F1GP), then
you'll know there is alot of strategy in speeding, breaking and turning
combinations to get the fastest route around the track.

Well, from a group of German programmers comes a game which allows such
skills to be honed to perfection (albeit on rather dubious tracks). The
game allows for 1 to 4 players (coupled with enough tins of larger to
make even Fleecy Moss look like a rather lame trout). Anyway, depending
on what skill level you have set, you have anything from infinity to 1
second to make up your decision about which way your going to drive and
whether to apply more gas, apply the breaks or cruise along at the same
speed. This is all quite niftily accomplished by the use of a 3x3 grid
that appears infront of your 'car' in the direction that your
travelling. This means that you cannot make 180 degree turns, nor can
you go from 120mph to 10mph in a rediculously short space of the track -
quite clever.

From what I've said, the game must sound like the nerds game of the
year. However, when we start talking about the graphics to this game (as
with far too many nowadays) - we see far to little quality. This isn't
really such a problem with this game, as the graphics serve their
purpose more than adequetly - but it would just help to keep your eyes
more glued to the screen. The music and SFX to this game are of a higher
quality and there are no complaints that I could really make because
they do the job - and do it well.

I have only had the chance to play this game with myself. But I imagine
that in a party atmosphere where you've had a few to many to even play
Lemmings - then you'd have a great time with your friends.
