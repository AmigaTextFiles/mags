{p} {p}
Amiga has announced that the developer box for the OS they are
producing will be based on an Pentium compatible chip, and will
also require Linux to be installed. The distribution they are using
is Red Hat, the CPU is the K6-2.

Amiga is keen to point out that the Pentium clone is simply to make
development easier, by providing a single platform base for
support. The Tao kernel they use will eventually run on many
different CPUs, and as noted will also run natively or under
another operating system such as Linux or Windows.

While it is reported that the new OS will run eventually on Amiga
PPC hardware also, this doesn't appear to be supported for
development.
