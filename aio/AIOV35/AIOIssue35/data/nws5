1. Introduction
{p} {p}
AmTelnet II is a client for the Internet "Telnet" and "SSH"
protocols for remotely logging into computers, playing
text-oriented multi-user games ("MUD"s or "MUSH"s) or
manually simulating internet protocols.
{p} {p}
{p} {p}
2. Note for registered AmTelnet 1.x users
{p} {p}
AmTelnet II requires new keyfiles. However, the upgrade for
registered AmTelnet 1.x users is *FREE*. New keyfiles have been
mailed out to all existing AmTelnet 1.x users to the e-mail
addresses on which they originally received their keyfiles.
{p} {p}
Should you, for some reason, not have received your AmTelnet II
keyfile yet, please mail your current AmTelnet keyfile together
with a short note on *WHERE* and *WHEN* you originally registered
to <keyfile-update@vapor.com>. Please note that those requests
have to be manually processed by a poor overworked software
developer (me), and thus they generally have awkward response
times -- sorry for that.
{p} {p}
Please note that NetConnect II users are not entitled for
an free AmTelnet II upgrade. AmTelnet II is part of the
general NetConnect III upgrade, however, please contact
Active Technologies for any relevant information on the
NetConnect package issues.

AmTelnet II will work in 15 minute demonstration mode
without a keyfile.

utility at any of the 7 registration sites worldwide, or
directly online with any major credit card at{p}

{p} {p}
As the time of writing, AmTelnet II totally lacks any documentation.
Any volunteers on that are greatly appreciated :)
