Of all the very useful features in Dopus, there are a couple that some
people might overlook or avoid out of fear.  Well, fear not because I'm 
going to give a quick explanation for the uninitiated.
{p} {p}
First there's program groups. Great little things for quick access to 
programs that follow a given theme.  To kmake one, just go to the menu 
Icons->New->Group. A requester will then pop up asking for the name of
the new group. Give it one that best desribes the types of programs you 
plan on accessing through it and that's it.  Both window and icon will 
now appear, waiting for you to drag some icons into it. Not that noo 
programs will actually be copied over, just a reference to the icon and
program; any icon later deleted from the group window will only affect
the reference.

That's it.  You can have as many program groups as you wish.

Next is Start Menus.  Another way of accessing themed collections of
programs, it';s basically a single small menu bar that pops up into
menus and submenus. Start by selecting the menu item Buttons->New->Start
menu. A menu configuration window will come up where you can give menu
and submenu names and select which programs you want in there. Just
standard stuff here, just like any normal button configuration. Config
and save. You can edit and add to it at any time by right-clicking on
the start menu's dragbar.

Again, any number of Start Menus are npossible, and the best way of
using them is to keep to a single theme for each one. Me, I have one set up
with all the FTP sites I access.

Dopus has a lot of power to be used. The two features mentioned here are
by no means all of that power but can set one well on the way to
releasing your Amiga's potential.
