If you've ever played FreeCell on MS Windows, then you will need to
read no further, just grab it and play it.
{p} {p}
For those of us who are oblivious to MS OS, FreeCell is a Solitaire type
game. In this version you have the choice of two card sets in the
archive, but you can use any of the REKO standard card sets, and the
author has included a couple of arexx scripts to turn stuff you do in
PPaint and AdPro into card sets too!
{p} {p}
For some reason the author refuses to put the rules of the game into the
documents file or the game, so I might as well tell you now so that you
too, don't suffer the severe confusion you get when the game starts with
all the cards facing UP!
{p} {p}
The point of the game is exactly the same as that with the normal MS
Solitaire game. You have to make four piles, whereby the cards are layed
in order from ACE up to KING in each suit. However, in this game you are
shown all the cards face up in eight columns. You also have a total of 5
places to 'store' cards, four of which are represented by four boxes at
the top left of the window, and the other one I guess is your hand.
{p} {p}
This means that you can only move a maximum of 5 cards at a time, and
this is reduced when you decide to store cards that are getting in the
way in one of the four available boxes. I hope you understood that 9)
{p} {p}
You basically keep playing until you have the cards sorted out into
their suits and in order. I'm not sure if you are destined to lose due
to the lay out of the cards - as in the other solitaire game - because
you have these 'storage' spaces to get rid of cards temporarily. It may
be always possible to finish, however I have failed to do so yet!
{p} {p}
The graphics are not bad, I use a No Flicker Interlaced Hi-Res
(640x512) with only 32 colours, and I got very good results. The game
has graphic card support to make the moving of cards more fluent,
however, I do not think the graphics in a game like this matters that
much. Its the frustration and addiction of the game.
{p} {p}
The only sound with this game is your default ERROR sound being played
when a requestor comes up telling you that 'You have tried to move 3
cards, yet you only have space for 2' or something similar.
{p} {p}
All in all, its programmed well, looks good and opens on WB (uses MUI!).
