Put your hand up if you owned a Commodore Plus/4? ... Good, now that I
have shown most of the world didn't, we shall talk about the rebirth of
one of its most compelling games.
{p} {p}
Kikstart - apparently originally coded by A.Morris. This game is a
supreme example of how the Commodore, Atari and Spectrum machines
managed to make up for pretty crap graphics and sound with games that
were that were actually ENJOYABLE to play!
{p} {p}
Super Kikstart takes-up from where Morris left, and added some more
graphics so that the game became more varied and interesting - and here
is the finished package.
{p} {p}
The intro sequence isnt bad but is bassically nothing more than a
average mod with a fire filled Font explaining who made it, the original
and giving some thanks out to those who helped and supported. Does the
job though!
{p} {p}
Featuring 20 levels and a titlesong "Back for the future!" the game
comes in a 632Kb lha archive. This is also another game from the author
of Area51 (reviewed in this issue too).
{p} {p}
The graphics for the game are based around the original - at least they
are fairly blocky, with nothing special going on (sounds like the old
8bit Commodore machines!).
{p} {p}
There is no ingame music, merely the SFX of your bike gaining and
loosing speed, and a 'boing' when you jump!
{p} {p}
The aim of the game is to bassically get a motorbike from one end of the
level to the other. This involves jumping over obstacles and in later
levels, collecting balloons for points. You take control of the bike
using your joystick. Fire makes you jump, left makes you slow down, and
right makes you speed up. Luckily enough, this particular motorbike
seems to be fitted with air breaks and jets, meaning, that not only can
you speed up and slow down on the ground, but the same rules of physics
appear to apply when in the air too!! - and believe me, they are needed!
{p} {p}
Despite the lack of visual stimulation, and the fact that an old granny
with or without her hearing aid wouldn't suffer any lack game play, the
actual intensity and frustration of the game make it unbelievably
addictive (unless your only idea of fun is to run around a 3D world
shooting peoples heads off - but to you, I say "Find your roots..".
{p} {p}
Rounding up, the game is simple, looks like a wet toilet roll and sounds
even worse! - But its GREAT fun to play!
