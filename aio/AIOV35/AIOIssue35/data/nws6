Contact Manager, a centralised system-wide address book
{p} {p}
The Contact Manager is a system address book which allows you to store all
your favourite user information, web sites, ftp sites and IRC
server/channels. It is designed as a replacement to the never-ending number
of bookmarks, address books and similar GUI's that are built into the many
different Amiga Internet and communication programs.
{p} {p}
It offers a number of features over a lot of the internal
bookmark/addressbooks:
{p} {p}
* You can store a range of different information for one user. In the user
section, for instance, you can include their address, email address, phone
number, fax number, web site, ftp site and so on. All these options can be
utilised by other software. Voyager can use the web information,
Microdot-II can use the email address, STFax Pro can use the fax number and
so on.
{p} {p}
* One GUI, many programs. You can store all the information you require
within one interface. No need to worry about Microdot-II's addressbook,
Voyager's bookmarks, STFax Pro's phonebook, AmFTP's server list etc.
{p} {p}
* Interacts with other software. Microdot-II, AmIRC, Voyager, AmFTP, STFax
Pro, DOpus Magellan and IBrowse (all available separately) will all add
information to the Contact Manager from within these programs. For example,
find an email address when reading a mail within Microdot-II? Just click
'add to addressbook' and the email address will be added to the Contact
Manager.
{p} {p}
Some of these programs will use the Contact Manager in additional ways. For
instance Microdot will call the Contact Manager when you press to: or cc:
when writing a new message.
{p} {p}
Textinput (the built in Vapor text editor that ships with Microdot-II,
Voyager, AmIRC, STFax Pro amongst others) now supports the ability to
insert Contact Manager information into any document. For instance, say you
were writing a message with Microdot-II, you could insert a name, email
address, phone number or any other Contact Manager field, directly into
that document. You will never have to remember a friends email address ever
again!
{p} {p}
* Groups and sub-groups. The Contact Manager allows you to create groups
for different kinds of users/addresses. AmFTP, for instance, does not allow
you to create groups or sub-groups within its server list, however this can
be achieved via the Contact Manager.
{p} {p}
* Multi-user support. If you are using Genesis as your TCP/IP stack, the
Contact Manager will support and allow multiple users within one interface.
If there are more than one user in your house (family members), each user
can have their own configurations (with password) so that their information
remains private.
{p} {p}
* Plugin links. AmIRC (from v2.1) now ships with an internal Contact
Manager plugin. This allows you to add users to the Contact Manager from
within AmIRC (based on the current userlist), add interesting channels to
your Contact Manager channel list and even search for entries within
Contact Manager from within AmIRC.
