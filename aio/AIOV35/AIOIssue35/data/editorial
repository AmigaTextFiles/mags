April is here and, for upper half of the world at least, Spring is in
full bloom. Besides flowers, our hopes may very well be blooming as
well.  The Developer System out, plans for an Amiga future that go well
beyond desktop rigs, and for once it looks like the hype is true.  for
those that {bold}still{nobold} think that things are proceeding too
slow, keep in mind that this Amiga incarnation has only been around
since {bold}January{nobold} and already they've gotten some partners
together, a developer system out, plans for not just a new computer but
a whole new system or products. Not bad for just four months.
{p} {p}
So don't give up hope yet; not after all this time.  The new concept of
products that Amiga is hyping up is a large untapped resource that is
going to leave the PC world behind with the stone knives and bear-skins.
Not mentioning any names, but {italics}some{noitalics} systems are going
to finally be revealed as thepieces of junk they really are.
{p} {p}
As for what's in this issue, there's a couple of surprises.  First, our
Games department has a couple of new features. Classic Games will be
reviews of some old favorites that have too long been relegated to dusty
draws but may still have some life left in them yet. You just need a
reminder or two.
{p} {p}
Then we bring you Games News, an attempt to keep you up to date on
current and future releases. So, keep an eye out here for all the latest
in ,platforms, shhot 'em ups, and RPGs.
{p} {p}
Finally, an unexpected surprise. Nathaniel Downes of ZenGen has been
quietly at work on a new evolution of the Amiga concepts in the form of
an entirely new architecture. So, if you want to know what "eddas" is
then read the interview in the Articles section.
{p} {p}
So, enjoy the issue and see you next month.
