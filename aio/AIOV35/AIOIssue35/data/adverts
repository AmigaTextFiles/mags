MOONSTONE Final Release wanted. Original only!
I'm also interested in other versions but I rather
want this Final Release version. I've heard that it
only was sold in the USA and had a sticker on the front
that said "Fin. Rel. v1.1".{p}
If someone knows where I can get hold of a copy of this splendid
game then don't hesitate to send me a mail!
