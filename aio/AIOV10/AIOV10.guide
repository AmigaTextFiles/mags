   Welcome, welcome, welcome, another month passes and we are back again!
This month we've got a full review of the excellent game, Myst, we've
also got a review of The Strangers from Vulcan and all the other PD and
shareware games floating around the aminet and bullitian boards. We
have now got a new Co-Editor, so expect to see alot more articles from
him in the comming months. Aswell as the new Co-Editor we have a new
Games editor so check out the bursting games section. Also check out the 
amazing review of AmIRC2.0 by Lewis Mackenzie.

 A sad loss this month is that we lose Daniel Kitingan as our Australian
reporter as he is busy studying Law, don't worry though, he assures me
he'll be writing the occational article :) and if he doesn't i'll pester
him til he does ;)

 Check out the articles section and see the statement by Vulcan Software
and what there plans are for the comming months, some are very interesting.

 Quake is comming to the Amiga and everyone is happy, Descent was uploaded
to the Aminet the other week which is some more good news, is this where
the Amiga turns?! Sales of Myst seem high because when I bought my copy
they where sold out at first!

 I see some people did not like the choosen font so AIO will now be using
whatever your default font is, if you want to read AIO in the font I
picked, loadup 'aiov10.guide' and at the top edit '@font Polarrsmall.font 7'
to say '@font Polarsmall.font 7' then it will work fine!

 Join us next month for more pearls or wisdom!

It is not the full Java but it is a step in the right direction!

  Anyone interested in getting the FULL version of OXYPatcher can

@{fg shine} Games editors welcome@{fg text}

 A big HELLO to all of you A.I.O readers out there, my name is Lee 
Hesselden and i`m the new Games Editor in A.I.O. This is my first issue as 
a member of the A.I.O team, I hope to give you the best games out there on 
the Aminet and a few commercial titles too.

 I am trying to put as many screenshots as possible in this section, the 
software I use to grab the screens only works on Intuition Screens, and 
does not work with screens which programming languages like AMOS use, if 
you are uploading a game to the Aminet it would help if you put a screen 
shot with the archive, and mention that there is one included in the 
.Readme file somewhere, this will improve your chances of getting your 
work noticed in this brilliant disk magazine!

 Lets hope in the next issue I can get even more screenshots and make A.I.O
that much better!!! (As if it isn`t all ready!)

 If you have any suggestions, comments, want me to review your software, or
have you wrote a review? Get in touch with me today:-

@node "myst" "Myst"

@{fg shine} Myst@{fg text}

 Myst, one of the biggest games of all time and the best selling game
on PC and MAC cd-rom comes to the Amiga at last! The interest all
started way back in time around 95-96 when a mock Myst was seen running
on the PAWS (Portable Amiga Work Station) at an American show! This
caused thousands of enquires into whether Myst would actually come
to the Amiga. Some time went by, various things happend and ClickBOOM
landed themselves with the rights to convert and publish Myst on the
Amiga. 

 Before being able to play the game you will have to install some of
it, the minimum is 5Mb but it is best to install as much as you can
onto HD as everything will access quicker. I choose to install 250Mbs
of it which filled up my DH1: partition!!! It doesn't matter how
much you install but you have to install some no matter what.

 Upon loading the game you are shown exactly what happended... well
actually you see a view of someone flying to an island and that is
it! Then a screen will appear and the game has started. The idea
really is to confuse you, you start off not knowing why your there,
not knowing what you are meant to do or even what the hell is going
on. The second the first screen comes up you will be outstanded by
the graphics, click around a bit more and you will see that every
screen is absolutly amazing. The game is made up of linked pictures
but the graphics are not the only reason to buy the game, apart from 
the excellent graphics the gameplay matches, as you don't know what
you are doing or anything about what is going on you have only
one choice... and that is to explore. After a whiles exploring
you will find clues and other bits that tell you important things.
You do not actually collect objects, once you have picked up an
object you use it pretty soon and don't have to carry it around
with you all the time, once it is used that part is over. Through
out the whole game you don't really know what is going on but
you will get a better idea as the game progresses. In parts you will
get video clips of someone telling you important things that
you need to remember to complete the game. The game is made up
of mostly puzzles so if you don't like puzzles don't buy this game,
alot of the puzzles are quite difficult aswell so if your only
a novice adventure player think twice before buying it.

 Myst is one of those games that you think you've been playing for
half and hour and you look at the clock and two hours has slipped
past, the music is very atmosferic and the whole game will completely
suck you into that world.

 Overall Myst is an excellent game and is one of the best games
I have ever played in my entire life. I recommend that everyone should
get this game as it is something that shouldn't be missed (no
pun intended!) Also on the CD is a 14 minute video of how the game
was made, although it is a little slow and jerky it's good to watch
for the first time. If you like a few puzzles then you'll LOVE this!

@node "gr1" "HomerGotchi"

@{fg shine} HomerGotchi@{fg text}

 Homegotchi as you may guess stright away is a Tamagotchi on the Amiga
but with Homer from the Simpsons. The only thing you can do is feed
him, thats not because this is a beta version or anything, accourding
to the author who would want to clean up after Homer and he's probably
right :)

 You leave Homergotchi running on your WB screen and open up the
Fridge directory, every now and again he'll mention a certain food
from the fridge and you have to drop the food icon on homers head
so he eats it. If you drop the wrong food or drop food when he doesn't
want it his energy will drop down 10 and he'll get angry at you
and shout.

 Homergotchi is very funny for the first couple of times and is worth
downloading just for a laugh. After running it a couple of times you'll
get bored and never run it again but it is useful for the samples which
you could use in your sound prefs or something.

 Overall download it for a laugh by all means and use the samples but
don't be expecting to keep you amused for long.

@node "gr2" "The Strangers"

@{fg shine} The Strangers@{fg text}

 The Strangers was the first in the series of Vulcans now CD only games.
It is a beat-em-up game in the style of 'Streets of Rage' and other type
games where you have an area where you can scroll back and forth having
to beat up anyone that comes in your way. It revolves around the same
style of gameplay as Renagade from the C64 and other early computers.

 The graphics are quite good but they could do with improving as they have
a shareware game look about them. The music is really thumping to get you
going and into the spirit of things. In one player mode the gameplay isn't
all that exciting and you will probably get bored after a while, give it
a two player game and you and your friend will never want to put it down.
I have spent countless number of hours playing this game with friends and
kept on going trying to beat the hiscore. The game isn't that hard really
give a level a couple of tries and you'll get past it with no trouble.
That is until you reach level 8 (the last level) This is the hardest
level in the game as you would expect, and is nearly impossible to complete
in your first 50 tries of the level, the amount of swearing and sweat
pouring from me when I played this level was outstanding :) After a
long while in two player mode you should beable to beat everyone up
and then you have to kill the boss. The boss must take around 100
hits as his face doesn't even get a scratch on it when you have been
hitting it for along time. The only way I found to kill him was one
of the players grabs him from behind while the other one keeps punching
at his face and you will have no trouble in beating him.

 The game is said to be very violent, it is more comical than violent,
if you are offended VERY easily or have very small children then I
suggest not buying this game, otherwise you'll just laugh at the chessey
comments made by the bosses before they chop you into pieces or rip
out your tounge and eat it?!? If you have more older children but you
don't want them to be seeing the fatalitys then there is a parental
lock to stop children accessing the fatality modes.

 Overall a very nice game, lacking in some parts which gives it a shareware
type of look and feel to it. If you're going to play this game one player
there isn't much fun envolved but get two - six players and you'll be
having loads of fun. Also check out the deathmatchs where you can have
six human players beating each other up in a big rumble!

@node "gr3" "Total Chaos City II"

@{fg shine} Total Chaos City II@{fg text}

 Total Chaos City II or TCCII as it is known is an overhead 2 player
shoot each other game, you know the type, not amazing graphics but
has great gameplay and will suck you in until you realise you've
been playing for hours :) It has the same feel as the legendary
Extreme Violence and if you liked that you'll love this!

 TCCII has no scrolling screen but the levels are different everytime
you play them and have various obsticles and extra weapons and powerups
to collect. If you have Extreme Violence it's worth checking this out
but you may not like the non-scroll screen limit to it as you always
know where the other player is and you can get into situations where
neither of you will go round the corner otherwise you face the risk
of being shot.

 The orginal game was coded in Amos but the author decided to re-code
it in Blitz basic to learn the language and he had lost the source
code to the Amos version!

 Overall a nice game that will give some enjoyment to you and a friend,
if you have no friends avoid. Can be two player joystick and keys,
both keys or both joystick.

@node "gr4" "Stonetowers"

@{fg shine} Stonetowers@{fg text}

 Stonetowers is based slightly around Settlers and Foundation but
more basic in a way. The idea is to pick your land to set up your
castle and the second player does the same, you then have to put
other castles around the screen and gather more land, you can
also upgrade you exisiting castle. Every move you make gains you
more points but the positioning of your castles can earn you more
land which results in more points.

 When I first loaded Stonetowers I though it was going to be rubbish
but on my first go it was excellent! The fun and excitment that you
get out of this game makes it well worth downloading, the only
draw back is it seems to be two player only.

 There are three different game versions, short, medium and long, each
have a set amount of moves you can each make before the game is
over and the winner is declared. Overall its a nice game but could
do with some more features and maybe some soothing music insted
of the occational Dong!

@node "gr5" "Battle XI"

@{fg shine} Battle XI@{fg text}

 I am very angry with this game, first off you need a screen size 800x600 
with at least 8 colours, then you have to read all of the German 
documentation and then, and only then you can load the thing, then it 
tells you you need a screen 800x600 pixels, or something like that (It`s 
in German), oh heck, go back into the ScreenMode prefs, change that again 
because you forgot to click on "Use", and now Workbench won`t close down 
because Battle XI is still loaded in the background. So reset the computer 
start again and at last it loads!!!

 Well, once you have the installation complete as detailed above you are 
presented with a message in German, don`t ask, I don`t know what the 
silly thing says! After a few seconds you get the title screen and some 
music which is quite good, now you move your mouse down to the bottom of 
the screen and heck, the auto scroll is off and that hours work getting 
the thing to load is wasted; reset the computer, change it, load the 
program up again and now you can read the instructions of what to 
do next. (At last, something that looks like English).

 Press SPACE it says to play, do that and you get the game screen, black 
with white dots all over the place. Now, how to move the silly things, 
joystick, no; mouse, no; keyboard, oh heck, quit it again! In fact I can`t 
get the dots, which I assume are your pieces, to move; back to the menu, 
ah, demo, click on it the computer plays for you, still does not tell me 
how to play it! Lightning, somethings happening, white lines all over the 
screen, interesting!

 Maybe it would be best to credit this game with some English 
documentation, although the archive is almost full with docs, there all in 
German! Send me some English docs and I might review it again, until 
then...

@node "gr6" "AmiPet V1.14"

@{fg shine} AmiPet V1.14@{fg text}

 AmiPet is another one of those Cyper Pets for your computer, we last 
reviewed this is issue 7 (V1.10b). It got a 89% rating, nice with some let 
downs, well this version is attemting to remove those let downs, and 
the author has managed it well.

 When you first use AmiPet you have to set some of the tooltypes to tell 
the program where the graphics and sound files are, this is the only let 
down in the program, it would be nice if there was a configuration program 
which saved a file on your HD or something telling the program where to 
look, as the installation may be a bit complicated for children, who I 
assum this is aimed at, or the beginner Amiga user!! You can also set the 
size of your pet, either BIG, horrible graphics, or small, as in the 
screenshot.

 In all you get 6 different graphics files, two of them are blobs, one is a
computer, another is a fish, you can even have a sheep or a spider! The 
idea behind the different graphics is a good one, and you can even make 
your own up, as the archive comes with a program to convert normal IFF 
pictures into AmiPet graphics! Amazing!!

 I have left my AmiPet in the corner of the screen, he seems very happy, he
hasn`t been to the toilet yet, and I wish he would because I wan`t to know 
if I hear one of the brilliant sounds, the best of course being the fart 
when it needs a clean, this you can test using one of the menu items 
in the GFX test menu.

 In the time it has taken me to get this far my AmiPet is dead! It lived 
for 2 minutes 48 seconds, is this a record?? Maybe not! It lasted longer 
than that when I was making the screenshot. Maybe I shouldn`t have given 
the little thing a meal to eat? I don`t know, let me create another using 
the New Pet button also accessable from the pull-down menus.

 Anyway, back to the review. All of the AmiPet`s functions, feeding, 
playing, cleaning, going to the vet and punishing are all accessed by using
the pull-down menus, this lets the window be very small so it can sit in 
the background and not get in the way of that very important A.I.O review!

 Be very carefull though, as when you quit AmiPet the time and date is 
saved, if you leave your pet unattended for too long it WILL die!!

 Maybe i`m about 7 at heart, but this is a brilliant piece of software for 
any child or indead adult, its great fun to play with and the sounds make 
it brillaint. Well done!

@node "gr7" "Forgotten Empires"

@{fg shine} Forgotten Empires@{fg text}

 When I downloaded this from the Aminet I thought it was the full game, but
it isn`t, this is V0.33 and it is a preview of whats to come. It is the 
authors first Blitz Basic Game, and by the looks of things he is a Star 
Trek fan as the races you have to choose from I seem to remember of the 
Star Trek Series on T.V.

 At the moment the game isn`t up to much, you start off and you pick your 
race, enter your name, and the computer picks out some skill points etc, 
then it askes you if you want to roll again, meaning are the scores i`ve 
given you a load of rubbish? After all that your character is created, you 
then move on into the game it self, as it is text based there are no fancy 
picture here yet, but you are presented with a map with loads of stars on 
it. You are placed upon one of the stars and all you can do at the moment 
is move to and each one. When you do move however you get a bar scroll 
along the screen to tell you how far you have travelled.

 Another feature of the game is the trader, this is where you can buy and 
sell things, every time you go into the trader the items available to buy 
are different, you can even sell some of your items too.

 The game, at its present state isn`t up to much, there is no 
documentation which is a must when making a game,  but the foundations for 
a great playable game are there, I just hope the author continues progress 
with this game, and hopefully we will see the full version on the Aminet 
in the near future.

@{fg shine} WBsteriods V1.5@{fg text}

 There have been lots of Asteriod clones doing there rounds on the Amiga, 
but WBsteriods is one of those really good ones, its loads up on the 
Workbench screen, says Asteriods in a freeky voice and lets you play as 
many times as you like!

 The game has the original graphics like the original game which makes 
the graphics not too brilliant, but the author was going for the original 
look for his game.

 The game is from the people who made Battle XI, although the documentation
is only in German, you do not need it, the game is simple enough anyway!

 A nice addition to the game is the resizeable window which lets you 
increase the size of the playing area, you don`t really need to use this 
though as the size of the playing area you start with is big enough!

 The only problem I had with this game is when I got on to the later levels
the whole game slowed down, it might be my system, 2mb Chip Rammed A1200, 
[-Ed Upgrade you computer then :)] but it is a real let-down to this 
brilliant game.

 Not gripping sound, simple graphics, but great playability, except when 
it gets sloooooooooowwweeeerrr and slower in the later levels. Great game, 
but too many let-downs for an A.I.O Gold.

@{fg shine} X-Wins@{fg text}

 You have all played Connect 4 sometime in your life, well, I bet you got 
fed up setting it all up, finding the pieces stuck under the sofa, well, 
your problems will be all solved if you buy X-Wins, this is, yes, you`ve 
guessed it, a Connect 4 game!!

 This is the third game this month which has no English documentation, its 
all in German! Is it me, or are there more programming Amiga Users in 
Germany than anywhere else in the world? Yes! Then why can`t they write in 
English, the most widly used language in the world?? Anyway, the docs are 
not needed, the archive comes with a Catalog to convert the German text 
into English in the game itself. Isn`t it amazing what all these Aminet 
Programmers can do now??

 When you start the game you select the size of the board, the row length 
and the difficulty level, the difficulty level and the size needs no 
explaining, the smaller the harder it is to get at least one person to 
win. The row length lets you select how many discs you have to get in a 
row, it defaults at four, but you could have up to six in a row and make 
it very difficult!

 I won`t mumble on telling you how to play the game, i`ll just say all you 
have to do is click on one of the letters at the top of each column, or 
press the key on the keyboard, and a little round disc falls from the top 
of that column and either sits on top of another disc or plonks itself on 
the bottom.

 There are two problems with this game, every now and again a disc will 
fall down, but there will still be a disc stuck on the top of the column, 
any other discs go through it and it dissappears, but it is very annoying. 
The other problem is when you resize the window, it makes the display much 
more clearer, but sometimes the program crashes!!

 However, this is a great game and is a must for all Connect 4 fans out 
there who have had there own games damaged by little sisters!! (No; i`m not
being sexist or ageist!)

@node "Cheat" "Cheats and tips"

@{fg shine} Cheats to Amiga Dooms@{fg text}

These codes are for the PC version but do work on the amiga version

idkfa - You get maximum ammo, maximum armour and maximum weapons. This cheat
is more effective if you've found a backpack (ammo capacity is doubled with a
backpack).

idfa  - Same as idkfa, but you don't get the colour keys. NOTE: this ONLY
works with Doom I v1.666 (or higher) or any version of Doom II.

idspispopd - Walk through walls ('zero clipping', they call it). This cheat is
toggle-type. You can't activate teleporters pick up things, etc., when this
mode is on. Plus, it can be difficult to fight
the  bad guys because their gun blasts, etc. can knock you through a wall!).
See below for equivalent Doom II code.

idbehold - (followed by pressing one of S, V, I, R, A or L) Toggles the
selected 'Power-Up'. The Power-Ups are:
Power-Up Type     Duration for which the effect lasts          
------------------------------------------------
  
S-Berserk Strength                   The rest of the current level (***)
V-Invulnerability                    30 seconds
I-Invisibility                       60 seconds
R-Radiation Suit                     60 seconds
A-Allmap (computer map)              The rest of the current level
L-Light Amplifiers                   120 seconds

idclev - followed by episode number and level number, (or map number in DOOM
II), will warp you to that episode and level (or map). Note that using this
cheat will cancel any use of        the-nomonsters' command line option. In
Doom II, the number given must always be two digits; thus,
  for levels 1 to 9, use 01, 02, 03, etc.

idmypos - displays your current co-ordinates and angle of view in hex
notation.

idchoppers - this code gives you the chainsaw. Press '1' to use it. 

Whilst in MAP mode (ie. after having pressed the TAB key):

iddt -    type once: show entire map,
          type twice: show all monsters as well,
          type a third time: back to normal.

 Games are reviewed mostly on playability and how long they will last
you, although some big games with fancy graphics might be expected to
get good reviews it is not always the case. A small 10k game might
get a better overall score than a 1Mb game. It is not that the 1Mb
game isn't any good it's just that the playablility might be non
exsistant and there is no point in downloading a huge file if it
will last a couple of minutes and you will only run it to show off
to friends.

@{fg shine} Gui4Doom V0.4@{fg text}

 By now most of you will have played one of the versions of Amiga
doom and will know that it is anoying having about 4-5 different
versions all by different authors. One Doom will offer some options but
the other may be faster with your blizzard or apollo board. It is a 
pain to have to find all your diffrent dooms and load them via your
WB, also if you have the various .Wad files it can also get anoying.

 This is where Gui4Doom steps in, it is one program that you enter
the paths of each doom and each wad file and then just load up that
everytime and pick which doom you want to play and with which wad file.
There are other options like to play from Rad:, autoforce demo, have
SFX and Music on/off, Rotate map, Use Ext .Wad and autoquit.

 Gui4Doom is a very useful tool for everyone that has many different
versions of doom and it's wad file!

@{fg shine} AmiClock V1.1@{fg text}

 Umm, AmiClock is a clock programmed in Blitz Basic 2, it reminds me of 
the Blitz-Clock programming example which comes with Blitz 2. What makes 
this one special is the intresting colours the author has chosen, and the 
wonderful messages which it says when you start it and close it, in that 
horrible American voice which the Amiga is blessed with you hear "Welcome 
to AmiClock, by...", umm, forgotten the rest, its sssoooooo dull!!

 When you quit, which you should immediatly after you see the thing load 
you hear "I hope you enjoyed using AmiClock", and the answer to that is 
NO!! The only use of AmiClock is incase there is a powercut and you need 
to know the time, leave the clock-stuff to the machines made to tell the 
time, also known as Clocks!

 Don`t rush out and download this, first it would be nice if the author 
could make it a little smaller, it really cloggs up my Workbench screen, 
also change the colours, but DON`T remove that feature where the program 
loads on the screen in front of the rest!

@{fg shine} AmIRC 2.0@{fg text}

Requirements : MUI v3.6 +
               Kickstart & Workbench 2.x +, with setpatch 40.16
               TCP/IP stack

AMIRC v2.00 was released a while ago, and this review was meant to be in
last months issue.. sorry :)

Is it any good ? Well, I think the answer to that has to be a big yes.
      
The main thing I'm going to cover is @{b}new@{ub} features, mainly because
its got so much stuff it would take ages to write a review on the existing
features..
                         
.

MIMEPrefs now comes with AmIRC, it is a prefs programme in which you can
select what you want to happen to different types of file which are
recieved by DCC.  It laid out in the same format as that in a web browser.
So you can set it up to auto play music, or view pictures automatically,
or even dearchive files into a directory.  Pretty neat :)

.

The serverlist, which is in the first window that opens, can now be devided
up into @{b}Server Groups@{ub}, which makes it much easier to organize.  You
can have all your DalNet servers in one group, and all your EfNet servers
in the one group.

.

The "@{b}Lag-O-Meter@{ub}" monitors and shows the current lag as a three-colour
bar underneath the user list.  Going from Green to Red.  When the lag is
at its worst, the bar flashes red on and off.  Another pretty neat addition
IMHO :)

.

Another addition is the favourite channels window, which contains a list
of all your favourite channels (obviously).

.

Now, when you iconify a window, only the @{b}current@{ub} channel is iconified,
not all the open channels as before.

.

The DCC Reveive window has a @{b}replace@{ub} button to overwrite existing
files, and also a @{b}MIMEPrefs@{ub} button to call up the Prefs programme.

.

There is a menu item @{b}Auto accept DCC send@{ub} which lets you automatically
start to recieve offered files.

.

The dialog and challel windows all have a button to log the contents to a
file.

.

Invites are now shown in a requster in which you can select to ignore them,
or join the relevant channel.


@{u}Bugs !@{uu}

Err.. actually, I couldn't find any :)  I also asked everyone on #am!ga if
they'd found any, but none, so thats another plus :)

@{b}Registration@{ub}

Well, if you aren't allready a registered user of AmIRC, and you use IRC
frequently, I definately recommend that you register soon.  I will be,
as soon as I can get the 20 quid together... My pocket money doesn't go
very far :(

Donations are welcome btw ;)

 Henry is an MUI channel bot, it has all the features you would expect
a bot to have like log the channel, faq, say and everything else,
as this is still in it's beta stages some of the functions don't
work or have not yet been written, the file server for example.

 There isn't alot to say about it, it connects quick and does everything
you want it to do, very useful if your looking for a channel bot, its
one of the most polished and best bot i've seen. 

 I've tried this on many channels and it is very stable, definatly
worth a download if you are looking for a channel bot!

 Utils are not marked on how good they are compared to other utils,
they are marked by usefulness and what purpose they serve. As there
are so many different utils that do so many different things it is
hard to review something like MUI and then when reviewing a program
like a WB clock say it wasn't up to the standard of MUI. This is why
it is not possible to have a Top Ten list for utils.

@{fg shine} STATEMENT TO THE AMIGA COMMUNITY From VULCAN SOFTWARE LIMITED@{fg text}

Wow! where to begin? We have been inundated with emails regarding our
future plans for 1998, some best wishes, some disgust, some confusion
and some worries.

As Vulcan is the oldest, most active, longest surviving Development and
Publishing company the Amiga has left I feel a certain responsibility
towards the Amiga community and would like to make an official statement
to endorse some facts about the Amigas commercial market and Vulcans
plans for the future.
This statement is very long indeed and comes from the heart, hopefully
it will answer all the questions `I receive daily` about the decisions                                                                       
and changing direction of Vulcan aswell as giving a true account of our
experiences over the last 4 years in the Amiga market. I dont know what
reaction this statement will receive but, as it is based on our
commitments, efforts and dreams for the Amiga platform then I am hoping
it will be understood.

TRUTH
-----
Not many companies have really spoken out about the past, current and
future Amiga market, instead wild rumours seem to circulate based on
past events and lies, I feel it is about time to lay down some facts
about the Amiga market, some are not what people want to hear, some are
already well known, some simply are so unbelievable they make you weep.
Nevertheless with our 4 years experience in this ever changing market I
feel we are in a very good position to be able to comment truthfully and
openly about the Amiga market which is based on our experience and
ventures.

Background & Overview
---------------------
Since 1994 Vulcan has been developing and Publishing Amiga games for the                                                                       
Amiga market. To date we have released 10 x floppy titles, 3 x CDRom
titles and have several Amiga CDRom titles still in production which
includes some PPC specific projects.

PAST
----
In 1994 we developed our first title, as you all know, this cult classic
(Valhalla) was either hated or loved, either way this title was
developed, manufactured and Published, but most importantly it was
distributed in retail outlets around the UK using a software
distribution company.

The point here is that this fully boxed floppy based title was available
in the shops! 

At that time in the UK there were 8 Amiga magazines, all of which
reviewed the title, carried demos of the title and advertised the title
not to mention newspaper coverage, radio coverage, television coverage
with personal appearances and interviews. 

The upshot was, that if an Amiga user heard about Valhalla and liked the                                                                            
product then the next time they went into their computer shop they could
pluck it from the shelf and buy it.


PERFECT MODEL
-------------
Sounds perfect doesnt it? And it was, as it meant a developer could
develop a product, a publisher could publish a product, a distributor
could distribute a product, a magazine could advertise and review the
product, a retailer could sell the product and a user could buy the
product. 

When the Amiga market in the UK worked like this it was fair all round,
and everybody made money from their efforts as tens of thousand of units
could be sold in the first week of launch.

WHAT DID IT RELY ON
-------------------
The above model relied completely on one thing to make it all work, and
that was, that there had to be a good healthy `available pool` of Amiga
buying users and accessibility. 
                                                                            
Sure the Model would fail if inferior products were developed but
overall the only reason a publisher published, a distributor distributed
and a retailer sold was due to the users purchase. 

Adding to this model the Amiga user could only purchase the product if
they new about it from magazines and other media and also had access to
the product via shops, so its easy to see that the whole intricate
commercial Amiga software market was finely balanced and self
perpetuating. 

Of course the Amiga users had to have an Amiga! :)
 
WHAT WENT WRONG
---------------
The 69 thousand dollar question, many things went wrong with this model,
becoming apparent in the middle of 1994. 

Dont forget, that at this time in the UK you could go into any high
street electrical store and buy an Amiga computer and many pieces of
software from publishers as it was a rife and healthy commercial market.
                                                                            
What went wrong can be blamed on many things but to start with, this was
the year that Commodore went into liquidation, reasons why have always
been given and attributed but for now I am only interested in what
happened with the Amiga commercial market. 

HARDWARE TO BLAME?
------------------
In 1994 the most popular Amiga computer in the UK was the A500, Some
lucky users had souped up A500`s in the `desktop form` of the A1500 and
there were also some A2000`s. 

Commodore tried to push the Amiga hardware forward, the market saw the
A500+ were a percentage of loyal users upgraded instantly, we saw
upgraded Operating Software, we saw the dying CDTV, we saw the A600
which sounded great with its 1Mb chip but was smaller and cheaper
looking, we saw the dying CD32 (way ahead of its time) and we eventually
saw the A1200 with 2Mb chip, AGA chipset and 68020 CPU.

Throughout this gradual advancement we saw many third party devices such
as external/internal Hard Drives, ram expansions, extra floppy drives,                                                                            
flicker fixers, monitors, accelerators, OS chip upgrades and many more
interesting devices for connection.

Sure these hardware improvements were absolutely vital to the Amiga`s
future (as if a technology stays still it dies) but with so many
failings of hardware launches the UK Amiga community was definitely
becoming split and diversity was rife. 

For example you had Amiga users screaming for AGA specific or CD32
specific or Hard Drive Installable specific aswell as floppy A500 users
still wanting 1Mb floppy based titles.

This was not too much of a big problem but developers and publishers had
to strike a balance whether to support the low spec machines for bigger
sales or higher spec machines to advance the market or in some cases
both but there was something vitally important missing and that was an
owner of the Amiga who could officially advance its technology.

OTHER COMPETITION
-----------------
Just around the corner in 1994 something was happening, it was called                                                                            
the PC,  now the PC was used all around the world but mainly in
educational and business situations. The big change was when PC hardware
prices tumbled and PC technical specifications rose, both at incredible
rates and I also believe a game `I had never heard of` called DOOM had
something to do with it!

Suddenly average home computer users could find themselves in a position
were they could afford a PC, after all thats what they used at work or
at school and its technology was being pushed and advanced at incredible
rates and DOOM offered something unique and wonderful to games
enthusiasts. 

PUBLISHERS
----------
The big publishers at this time (many who had begun on the Amiga
platform) saw an opportunity to develop for this growing market, and why
not? After all they were mainly business motivated and with the Amigas
technology in a temporary halted state it seemed a good gamble. 

I remember at that time (in June 94) when Vulcan was working on our next
Amiga title `Valhalla II` that all the companies we spoke to on a                                                                            
regular basis kept saying that they were going to PC formats. It was a
strange time as I began to notice distributors and retailers and users
alike all asking if we were developing for PC, `no` we said, `whats
wrong with the Amiga market?` we said, `its a big market and we have
only just begun`...

AS TIME WENT ON
---------------
From June 94 to June 95 it became apparent that this delicate commercial
Amiga market model had been altered, with no new Amiga hardware to
compete, with Amiga users moving to PC, magazines moving to PC,
Developers and Publishers moving to PC, distributors moving to PC and
retailers moving to PC the whole thing was hit hard.

By the time Vulcans third Amiga floppy title `TimeKeepers` was released
in June 95 there was no longer a distribution network in the UK, our
Amiga products (and others) found it harder to be available to Amiga
users via the shop shelf. 

This was mainly due to the distributors who would only distribute a
title if it was on the PC format as this was the format that the                                                                            
retailers could sell and the users were buying in vast quantities. 

Now sure there were still Amiga users around the country who wanted
Amiga titles but due to the way business decisions dictate market
changes the majority market soon became the minority market and things
got harder. 

I remember many heated conversations with distributors trying to get
them to stock our Amiga titles and often blamed them for killing the
Amiga market but at the end of the day the Amiga platform had no active
owner, no new hardware development, fewer users, fewer developers, fewer
publishers and alot of PC competition.

AND ON...
---------
Vulcan had a decision to make, we either went with the flow and switched
to PC or.....and heres the or.....adapt to the changing market and base
our companies future on a dream. We chose the latter, we believed that
it would only be a matter of time before a new owner was found for the
Amiga and when it was supported again we believed we would be right at
the top of the proverbial ladder as a mainstream development and                                                                            
publishing company on the Amiga platform.

HOW TO SURVIVE WITH NO COMMERCIAL RETAIL MARKET
-----------------------------------------------
Many people over the years have enquired as to how Vulcan managed to
survive in the Amiga market were others could not and this has been the
key to our existence. In June 95 to account for the lack of retail
support in the UK we set-up Vulcan Mail Order to provide our products
direct to the Amiga user. 

VULCAN MAIL ORDER
-----------------
This turned out to be an excellent move for Vulcan at the time as it
meant that Vulcan as a developer and Publisher could now distribute and
sell our own products direct to the user which meant allot more revenue
was generated for per title (as we cut out the middle men) and allowed
us to sell our titles cheaper (around 12.99 as opposed to 24.99) which
resulted in more Amiga users buying our software due to the price drop
and the direct personal attention they received through our company.

Because of this unique set-up (being 3 companies in 1) we were able to                                                                            
continue as normal and did not notice the pinch in the Amiga market as
other companies had, towards the end of 95 we released Hillsea Lido and
had just started signing external development teams to our label, the
year ahead 1996 was looking great!

PIONEERING
----------
In 1996 Vulcan took on a pioneering role and we dedicated alot of our
time to getting our products back in the UK shops, alas without much
success. We did however start to supply many independent retail outlets
in the UK with our software range but could not convince any UK
mainstream distributor to stock our products in favour of PC titles.

Beginning our expansion and aswell as selling our products to Mail Order
users and UK retail outlets we started to convert and develop our titles
for the German market.

Running up to the middle of 1996 we saw Valhalla III and the TimeKeepers
Expansion being released with now 6 external development teams signed to
the Vulcan label.
                                                                            
To keep pushing forward we founded Vulcans own International
Distribution Company whos main purpose was to distribute our products
by bulk retail and wholesale outlets around the world. Vulcan
Distribution supplied our products to retailers spanning 14 countries,
Vulcan Mail Order supplied our products to many thousands of registered
users, Vulcan Development signed up many teams and individuals. Briefly
(now and then) we glimpsed at the Amiga markets commercial situation,
but only briefly.

RECAP AND WARNINGS
------------------
To recap, by the middle of 96, there was still no Amiga owner (or
perhaps there was a brief handling by an Eskimo? or something), very
slowly we began to notice some new changes. Amiga magazines were
starting to close and many Vulcan registered users were asking to be
removed from the Vulcan database as they had moved to the PC platform.
Now this change should have been more noticeable to us and a bigger
warning sign but as we had now entered the world distribution market,
were now supporting other languages, were receiving allot of publicity
and talking to allot more developers, we got carried away with our own
companies expansion. 
                                                                            

The run up to the end of 96 saw us release Bograts AGA and
Jetpilot.....Happy X-mas! :)

THE SMACK IN THE MOUTH
----------------------
January 1997 was the hardest month of Vulcans entire existence, I still
joke about the fact that Santa Claus delivered a Playstation or
Multimedia PC to every household for Xmas of 96. 

Literally overnight Vulcans Amiga Mail order sales plummeted, now we are
not just talking about latest release performance, if we were then I
could understand the change but we are talking about all Vulcan titles
that sold regular and maintained a constant level for years suddenly
decreasing to an all time low. We lost over 4,000 registered Amiga users
in a 4 week period, Vulcan Distribution saw previous bulk purchasing
retailers around the world go bankrupt, we saw wholesalers ceasing to
order, we saw more Amiga magazines fold, we saw development companies go
into liquidation, we saw developers leave the Amiga platform, we saw
hell itself and all at Vulcan had to come to terms with this new
reality.
                                                                            

PLODDING ON
-----------
End of January 97 we plodded on, releasing Burnout AGA and Tiny Troops,
we feared the worst and were proven right, the sales were not there in
any quantity to justify the investment. Sure we could say its the type
of title but sales right across the spectrum of the entire range were
getting smaller and smaller, registered users, retailers and web
ordering was diminishing fast.

By March 1997 we had 2 Amiga magazines left in the UK and in vain we saw
many small Amiga companies start up and try to do something like,
Mediasoft who tried to publish a new Amiga fanzine, Direct software who
promised new hardware bundles, both of which folded, we saw long
established mail order companies like Premier Mail Order collapse along
with others. The commercial Amiga software market was at rock bottom
with only the strongest companies surviving.

COMPETITION
-----------
Thinking back to March 97 we saw PC computers in shops, not just in                                                                            
shops but in a world of their own, namely PC World were they had slowly
been selling to millions of users all around the world. Walk in and be
bombarded with hundreds of PC system choices that had plenty hardware
and software support. 

Now Im not talking an 020 CPU, 2Mb Memory, extended keyboard with a
floppy drive attached for 350.00 via mail order, No no, Im talking all
singing all dancing complete systems at 133Mhz, 16Mb memory, Graphics
Cards, Hard Drives, modems, Monitors, keyboards, floppy drives, sound
cards, software bundles and a bill gates special promotion devil hat for
500.00 in every shop in the high street that has been advertised to the
hilt in every paper, magazine, television program you can imagine.

Now anyone in the Amiga community knows that the Amiga has a far better
approach to things but lets face it if your a family purchaser who uses
a PC at work and your kids use a PC at school or your a student who uses
a PC at college or your a games freak who simply must have Doom, Quake,
Tomb Raider, Star Trek, Theme Hospital and zillions of other software
tiles and applications `right now` then it doesnt take Einstein to
figure out what the average computer purchaser will buy.
                                                                            
I mean, just look at the Investment, the hardware, the software, the
promotions and the technology that the PC has had over the previous
years compared to the orphaned Amiga with no owner.

MIRACLE
-------
Would you believe it! We couldnt! Just as everything was about to hit
the fan, in March 97 the Amiga found an owner, not just any owner but an
owner with money, namely Gateway 2000.

Immediately Vulcan planned for the future! Our dreams that held us tight
were going to happen, our hopes raised at the prospect of new Amigas
being made, perhaps a complete unit ready to buy that will be marketed,
distributed all over the world and available to users in the high street
shops at a price that would compete with current PC`s and with
technology to match. 

Vulcans plans for the rest of 1997 was to make Amiga titles for higher
specifications, we chose to go CDRom only with all future titles knowing
that we could catch up with PC competition, we started catering from
other language support to ensure world wide penetration, we invested                                                                            
heavily in our company and started to live again, we signed up more
development teams, we started on higher specification development
strategies catering for graphics cards and sound cards.

Throughout the rest of 97 we published Strangers, Uropa2 and Finally
Odyssey which were all re-vamped and turned into Multi language Amiga
CDRom titles. 

Hellpigs the Multi-CDRom adventure was going to be awesome, Wasted
Dreams was looking incredible, Hard Target the virtua cop clone is
looking fantastic, Genetic Species is absolutely outstanding, Breed2000
was being revamped, Valhalla IIII was re-written to cater for full actor
speech,  3D Games creator was re-designed to cater for Graphics cards,
JetPilot expansion was initiated, Desolate was signed,  overall 1997 was
looking great with renewed hope,  Phase 5 with PPC boards, Vulcan
signing the World Foundry with PPC projects like Explorer and Maim &
Mangle, investing in development hardware, PPC boards, Graphics Cards,
faster processors, going to Cologne and meeting the new owners of the
Amiga, new contacts, new possibilities, everyone I spoke to was excited,
magazines were happy, developers were happy, publishers were happy, I
was ecstatic at Sadeness starting in the games market, finally some good                                                                            
competition, I helped AliveMedia start up their games publishing company
and finally felt like the market was coming together, I was encouraged
by Aurora works entering the publishing market from across the water,
Amiga shows began popping up, Ohio, Italy, Germany Belgium, what a
brilliant beginning to the rest of 1997 indeed!

...but all the while....software sales were falling, companies were
closing, projects were being cancelled......

Forget it! because Amiga speeches were being made, hope was back with
vengeance, everyone I spoke to was on a high, other developers stated
CDRom only titles, more projects were being developed for graphics
cards, high CPUs and now PPC specific......we saw the potential in the
platform, we opened up Vulcan America to supply our titles to America
and Canada, our expanding development and publishing responsibilities
became more demanding so we transferred our Mail order operations to
Weird Science Limited and we transferred our Distribution company to GTI
in Germany so we could spend more energy in our development dream, we
established a development network of support and help for all our new
Amiga development teams, we concentrated on bigger and better Amiga
CDRom productions, we were on the road to glory! Nothing could alter our                                                                            
destiny, nothing can stop the Amiga being reborn!

.....this is where we were wrong.....

2 things, just 2 little things kicked us where it
hurts....................

.....one thing is something we RELIED on, and the other is something we
ASSUMED.

SOMETHING WE RELIED ON
----------------------
The Amiga has something unique, a community, many individuals and
companies who believe in the Amiga and its future with many users around
the world. All sounds great but lets analyse it in detail to get a
complete picture of what the Amiga community is made up from and what
makes it work commercially.

You've got Amiga magazines all around the world who love doing what they
do, putting so much of their lives into their jobs and all need
advertising revenue and Amiga users buying their magazines to continue.
                                                                            
You've got Amiga web promoters who, review Amiga software and hardware
and offer excellent Amiga support to users around the world with
information and news, they do this because they love doing it and many
are non-profit orientated.

You've got hardware development companies like Index and Phase5 who are
trying to push the Amigas hardware forward, realising there is a
commercial gap to be filled and doing what they do out of inspiration,
they depend totally on the Amiga users buying their hardware.

You've got shops and mail order companies around the world who sell
hardware and peripherals who advertise in magazines who all rely on
Amiga user upgrading their hardware.

You've got shops and mail order companies selling software around the
world who advertise in magazines who all rely on Publishers publishing
and Amiga users purchasing new software.

You've got dedicated Amiga distribution companies who exist in the
minority market who all rely on the Amiga retailers purchasing the
Software.

You've got thousands of talented artists, musicians, coders, developers
and teams who invest their time, money and lives to create software on
their prized platform because its in their blood who all rely on the
Amiga Publishers Publishing their creations.

You've got Amiga publishers who publish Amiga products, invest their
time, money and lives into producing and marketing Amiga titles and
making them available in the market place to retailers and distributors
who rely on the Amiga developers developing and the Amiga users
purchasing the software.

The list goes on and on but the moral of the story and the `simplistic
flow chart` dictates that every single related Amiga company and active
individual in the Amiga commercial market all rely on each other, and
all rely ultimately on one thing to make it all possible!

One thing that makes everything else work.
One thing to give it a purpose and a way of making a living.
One thing to ensure magazines keep printing new issues.
                                                                            
One thing to ensure hardware developers continue to progress.
One thing to keep all the retail outlets in business.
One thing to ensure the publishers remain.
One thing to ensure the developers remain.
One thing to keep the Amiga Alive!

And that one thing is the Amiga user Buying the merchandise, whether
its magazines, hardware or software. 

I cant speak for magazines sales but there are fewer magazines around
with extremely low ABCs compared to 94.

I cant speak for Hardware sales but I do know we get so many complaints
about supporting CDRoms, Graphic Cards, fast CPUs, Hard Drives and even
AGA...and why Genetic Species wont be on floppy for the A500 :)

However I can speak for software sales and sadly this element has
decreased ridiculously over the last 4 years from mail order, retail and
wholesale all around the world.

They say that hundreds of thousands of Amiga users still use their                                                                            
Amigas, I honestly dont know the number but I do know that Amiga
software piracy is rife and with the total Amiga buying user base at
its lowest current level, that there is simply no longer enough users
left who BUY software to justify the developers and publishers
investment.

PIRACY
------
A quick note about piracy. It does sadden me to see our latest Amiga
releases and other recent Amiga titles available on pirated CD`s. It
tears me up to think that people are making money from the illegal
duplication instead of my developers, my company, my distributors and
all the other hard working people in the Amiga industry who deserve that
revenue, however I do not blame the pirates or the piracy for the
current Amiga situation. 

Piracy is rife in any industry whether its, designer jeans, music, video
or other computer platforms but because the buying share of these
markets is large enough, it can sustain the illegality and still
continue.
                                                                            
The Amiga market however cannot sustain the piracy due to its size, an
Amiga users who uses pirated software cannot really care about the
Amigas future so do not enter into the equation but the Amiga users who
truly cares about the Amiga`s future make up the users who BUY. 

USERS WHO BUY
-------------
The Amiga user who BUYs is the thing we relied on (and many other
companies too).

Yes there are allot of you out there who have upgraded your machines,
bought your towers, bought your CD drives, bought your Memory and CPU
upgrades and bought all the latest software and my hat comes off to you,
I understand that you also share the same frustrations as we do and that
you have done everything in your power to help keep the Amiga market
alive, but unfortunately your numbers are at an all time low right
across the scale all around the world. This results in developers,
publishers, distributors, retailers and mail order companies all feeling
the squeeze and licking their wounds.

SOMETHING WE ASSUMED
--------------------
From March to December 1997 (10 months) Vulcan prepared for the Amigas
future, I know things dont happen overnight but with the Amiga market
being at its most critical and at its lowest point ever I knew that if
Vulcans dreams and hopes for the Amiga as a commercially successful
platform did not materialise in that specific period of time then the
Amiga market would never recover.

Perhaps its time to share Vulcans vision, I know from my experience and
my logic that the only way the Amiga computer can ever make a commercial
comeback (and I enforce the word commercial) and for the Amiga to once
again have stupendous and vast software development, once again have
millions of buying software users, once again have huge publicity with a
plethora of magazines, once again have hundreds of publishers, retail
outlets, distributors, once again have continued and advanced 3rd party
hardware development, once again be the leading computer in
technological advancements and as a result once again be the best home
computer used throughout the world, it all comes down to one essential
ingredient called...................Money.

Certainly by licensing the Amiga technology and allowing many companies                                                                            
to build components, motherboards, and complete systems allows the
Amigas technology to progress but we must ask ourselves a simple
question, who is going to buy this upgraded technology? 
Certainly not the new computer purchaser in the high street, as for one
they cant see it in their shops, would be hard pushed to hear about its
availability, cannot see the vast software support to the scale of other
platforms and certainly would not be turned on by the end price of the
components or systems being sold. 

So that simply leaves the existing Amiga users and loyal enthusiastic
upgraders. 

The problem is that this number alone is way too small. This means that
re-sellers of systems and components need to rely on mail order and
specialised outlets and due to small potential sales it requires higher
purchase prices which causes the vicious circle creating fewer
upgraders. Not even thinking about the small amount of developers and
publishers who would support this new technology due to the small amount
of potential software sales.

You see the idea of technological advancement with PPC, Graphics Cards,                                                                            
3D Chips, better motherboards faster CPUs, towers etc. is all very well
and all something I believe the Amiga needs but the current Amiga
community or market is already way too small to make any of this worth
while. 

To me it seems that, the companies and users who really care about the
Amigas future and have stuck it out through the worst of times and
invested a good number of years of their life into the Amiga and want to
build the Amigas future suddenly have the whole responsibility, with all
the risk, expense and investment to bring the Amiga back to glory, this
is something that will not happen at the current level, no matter how
hard Phase5, Index and other hardware companies try, no matter how hard
developers push the limits, no matter how hard Publisher promote, no
matter how hard the re-sellers sell and no matter how hard the existing
users buy, this approach is never going to work due to the size of the
existing user base and it will never encourage new users to the platform
as there is no cohesion, no distribution, no marketing, no price
benefits, no software support and no overall direction for it to become
apparent and compete in the world computer industry.

MONEY
-----
The only way the Amiga has a chance of revival in Vulcans opinion is
Money!

Money poured into the cream plastic until it spews out the sides, money
at the level of Sonys investment into its Playstation.

We are talking a complete base Tower computer system, with High
resolution Monitor,  keyboard, floppy drive, a 24xSpeed CDRom, 1Gig to
10Gig hard drive, a modem, A graphics card with 4Mb on board, 3D
Chipset, 32Mb memory, combined 060 CPU with 200Mhz PPC board, Mpeg
decoders, sound card, external speakers, (backward compatible only) AGA
chipset, new operating system, pre-installed web broswers, Email
applications, word processors, spreadsheet and accountancy software, and
bundled games software which has all been invested into and acquired for
the purpose and finally the word AMIGA on the outside.

This is not good enough on its own, no far from it, this needs to
manufactured in masses by one company or at least co-ordinated by one
company, this needs to be sold to distributors and re-sellers all around
the world, this item needs to be available to buy in every shop on the                                                                            
planet, this system need to be backed up by world-wide advertising and
marketing promotional campaigns in consumer press, magazines, radio and
television adverts, it needs to be launched as an awesome computer with
an incredible future that is an alternative the current PC platform and
finally this system has to be around the user buying price of 400 to
enable it to work.

Anything less, anything removed, anything left out and the Amiga has not
got a hope in hell of catching up in the ever moving commercial computer
market....even the above specs will only work with dedicated software,
massive marketing and extremely low price point. 

No money will be made by the company who initiates these actions, on the
contrary money will be lost as the hardware and software would cost far
more than the distribution price, but the money spent now will be
creating a future goldmine with greater potential than any one can
imagine.

If this `base level` launch was combined with investment in future
hardware advancements, investment in software support to allow
developers to excel it would give reasons for publishers, magazines and                                                                            
shops to once again think `Amiga` and this dream will become a reality.

Currently the Amiga community has all the people and companies available
to make the above system a reality...the thing lacking is the direction
and the money.

REFLECT
-------
So to reflect, Vulcans Amiga vision and Vulcans existence in the
commercial Amiga market relies on 2 things which are not making
themselves apparent. Throughout the last 10 months our Amiga development
and Publishing continues whilst the commercial Amiga market gets worse.
If Vulcan continues its recent strategy on the same level of waiting for
the Amiga market to recover whilst still investing in a decreasing and
more diversified market then it would only be a matter of time before
Vulcan Software would cease to exist and only the 2 mentioned things can
alter that fate for us and others.

As we have invested so much of our lives into the Amiga market, we do
not wish or intend to leave it, but rather see it through to its
ultimate destiny, as with any good book or film the Amiga market is the                                                                            
similar where you never know whats going to happen next.

The only way Vulcan can remain active in the Amiga market and to support
its future to the full is if we can stay financially sound, strong in
resource and talents and function as a successful business.

This is why in 1998 Vulcan plan to develop entertainment titles for the
PC and Playstation platforms where there is a combined and large active
user base. Certainly we are aware that these markets are saturated but
these market do have active distribution network with millions of
potential customers.

AMIGA TITLE CANCELLATIONS
-------------------------
To enable a smooth transition to other platforms we have invested a
great deal in our teams and development operations and as a consequence
many Amiga development projects have been cancelled namely, Breed2000
CDRom, 3D Games Creator CDRom, JetPilot expansion CDRom and Valhalla
IIII CDRom so the teams and individuals can concentrate on other formats
and other projects. This is a decision that didnt come easy for us but
one that is vital to our future plans that enable us to support the
Amiga.

AMIGA TITLE CONSEQUENTIAL EFFECTS
---------------------------------
As a consequence of the last 10 months the development team responsible
for Hellpigs the Multi-CD adventure title has halted development of that
title and also decided to move onto other business ventures. 

AMIGA TITLE PENDING
-------------------
Currently the Wasted Dreams development team is waiting another few
months to see if anything happens in the Amiga market that would
indicate a reason to continue with their development plans.

AMIGA TITLE FUTURE RELEASES
---------------------------
Genetic Species CDRom is all ready for a February 98 launch and close
behind it we will see Desolate CDRom and Hard Target CDRom closely
followed by the Genetic Species World Creator CDRom.

AMIGA DIRECTION
---------------
Our future Amiga development is based on extremely high specifications
and will take advantage of Graphics Cards, fast CPUs and 060/PPC boards.

We are actively supplying a selection of our developers with PPC boards
and along with Explorer 2260 and Maim&Mangle we will see other exciting
high specification Amiga titles being developed and published by Vulcan
through 1998.

PUBLISHING
----------
We will still operate our Amiga Publishing operations and actively sign
new Amiga development teams and individuals. As long as there are
developers developing for the Amiga we will always be available as a
mainstream commercial publisher.

OVERVIEW
--------
I hope all the above will clarify Vulcans future plans and that it shows
that our plans are not carried out in spite or malice but are simply
choices that our company is forced to make if we are to continue. Vulcan                                                                            
as with many other Amiga companies have worked extremely hard and you
will find no one more loyal to the Amigas future than we `are` and `have
been`, but we simply cannot change the Amigas future with all our
efforts alone.

2 things are needed if the Amiga is going to survive, 1 thing is in your
grasp and the other is the responsibility of the owner of the Amiga.

Live Long & Prosper!

@{fg shine} Differences between Amiga users and PC users@{fg text}

 · Amiga users can fix their computer when something goes wrong,
   PC users run off to the local repair man or call in the company
   that they bought the PC from and moan it is broke.

 · Amiga users know exactly how there computer works, PC users don't
   have a clue and think they will blow themselves up by opening up
   the PC case.

 · Amiga users have been around for alot longer.

 · We are dedicated to the best machine and don't flit from computer to
   computer.

 · We know that paying £1000 to write and odd letter and play an odd
   game is a waste of money when we can do all that and more on the Amiga.

 · Amiga users are more friendly and are willing to help.

 · Amiga users don't worship and praise B*ll G*tes

 This was just a bit of fun, don't take it seriously if you own a PC :)
