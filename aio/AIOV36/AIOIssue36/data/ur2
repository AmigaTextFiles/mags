Recently I've been searching for a decent newsreader, a job that proved
more difficult then I would have thought. FFNews crashes under OS3.5,
NewsRog stopped development, New York looks okay but is now available
only direct from the manufacturer, Microdot still has a few quirks I
don't like... And then came Stargate.
{p} {p}
At first glance a spiff looking program with a neat GUI and pretty
simple to use; time would see if there was a good engine beneath that
good-looking hood. The interface is MUI, which allows for enough
flexibility is layout, with two main pages for Email and News. The News
section is standard stuff found in nearly any emailer out there, so I
will concentrate on the News aspects.
{p} {p}
First off, there's the usual button bank; all the main options accessible
from either these buttons or the menu. The buttons are some nice-looking
pictures- of the scanned and re-sized variety, that take a little
gettubg used to as far as which does what, though there is a help bubble
for each whenever the cursor is over it. If you don't lik them then
just replace the ones found in the images directory. rest of the GUi has
the list for subscribed newsgroups, the news headers for the selected
group, and an optional preview window where your email or postings are
displayed after you've typed them in so you can see how they'll look.
Not a bad setup so far.

Docs are okay but incomplete. Several of the buttons are unexplained,
though the help bubble stuff helps.
{p} {p}
Setup is easy, and initially getting the newsgroup list is simple enough
though I'd found it to error once while getting the groups. Groups are
then broken up into alphabetically arranged listings to make bplowing
throiugh all those thousands a bit easier. Not quite as good as New
York's heirarchial listing but definitely better then the others massive
core-dump. Subscribing to a group is easy enough, just click on the
desired letter of the alphabet to view the groups beginning with that
letter and click your way through there.
{p} {p}
get the headers for a group by clicking the group name and hitting the
get-headers button. From there just double-click a header name to get
oit or you can batch download a bunch of them. One flaw here, if you
get a "No such article in group" error, and this turned out to be a
server error which is later fixed, next time you double-click the same
one you'll still get the error until the headers are cleared out and
reloaded. Also, if that error does ociurr, a message window is still
opened with a black entry; rather useless.
{p} {p}
Double-clicking on a URL will do the expected browser-launch. The full
range of buttons for replying, saving, and what not are also at the top
of each message window, and you can have multiple windows open at once.
The Nlist of headers can be sorted by clicking on the desired field,
though the Date field sort works only if it's displayed to the left of
the Subject and From fields.
{p} {p}
Picture downloading is available, as is an appointment calendar (for
whatever unfathomable reason).
{p} {p}
Now the bad stuff. It crashes when wquitting if you leave any message
windows open, there is no way of trimming the header cache (like by
date) shoirt of a complete purge by news group name, and thread support
is completely absent. It would be nice to be able to list headers by
thread instead of havcing to scroll back through the list by date,
though a quick solution would be to sort by Name (click on the field
name).
{p} {p}
All in all not a bad reader, and best of all version 2.5 is now FREEWARE.
IT fulfills my needs and just might do yours.
