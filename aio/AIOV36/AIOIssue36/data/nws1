{p} {p}
Haage&Partner's wordprocessor, AmigaWriter, is fast approaching version 2 and a
preview demo has been released on their website at http://www.haage-partner.com/
{p} {p}
This is a major advance on version 1 - but has AmigaWriter stolen the top spot
from Wordworth 7?  Some things you'll find very interesting with v2 are:
{p} {p}
 Microsoft (tm) Word (tm) 2000 Import{p}
 TrueType Support with Anti-Aliasing{p}
{p} {p}
I've personally been playing with the demo for some time and I am very
impressed! Word imports work well, although in my quick tests embedded graphics
were not imported. AmigaWriter 2 opened the documents with the correct fonts and
styles.
{p} {p}
Anti-aliasing with TrueType fonts is very good.  TrueType fonts are a standard
type of font used on many computers, and supported on the Amiga with a couple of
'plug-ins' for the Amiga font interface (did you know you do that with Amiga
fonts? You do now!).  AmigaWriter supports a feature of the TrueType standard
for anti-aliasing the text - just like in a paint program such as Deluxe Paint
or TVPaint, the program will 'smooth' the edges of text making it far easier to
read, especially with very small font sizes.

When released AmigaWriter 2 will cost 198 DM, around £60 Sterling.
