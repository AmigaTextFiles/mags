I {bold}did{nobold} say that Hugo's drive blew up, right?  Twice?  After
his motherboard took a dive? Well, he couldn't get anything done in
time, and since I never have time to play any games myself, much less
review them, I thought it best to finally get this issue out and just
double up on the games reviews next month.

So, sorry about this issue's lack of a Games section, but I'm sure next
month won't see as many simultaneous disasters as this one's had.

Please accept by deepest appologies.
