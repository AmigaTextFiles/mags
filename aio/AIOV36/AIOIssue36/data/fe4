IV24) or digital camera. Further extras like manipulation of images, animated
effects, webcam-and timelapse-creation-capabilities are available as well. With VHI
Studio it is now even possible to access all image-data as if they were saved on a
harddisk.
{p} {p}
New features compared to VLRec NG 4.0 are:{p}
  - DigiCam-support added{p}
        Support for serial-numbers and therfore the ability to create commercial VHI-drivers for DigiCams{p}
