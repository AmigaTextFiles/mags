Word Procesors:{p}
Doing a lot of word procesor I've come upon just about every way there
is for something to crash at just the wrong time.  I use Wordworth, but
this advice should apply to any other program out there.

First off, Wordworth version 7.x has an Enforcer hit on startup that
could come back to bite you with a memory leak if not plugged. Run
something like Cyberguard before running this or other WP programs.

Next you may want to disable any screen blankers. A few out there have
some modules that have this habbit of locking up when you move the
cursor to get the screen back but only when you haven't saved your file
(or so it seems).  It's also a good idea to disable the screen blanker
when running your internet programs (browsers, mainly) for pretty much
the same reason.

Lastly, there's two option you sshould always have turned on to ensure
any losses are mninimized: atuo save and backup.  Set the program to
automatically save, say, every 7 to 10 minutes.  Also, activate the
toption to save backups of the previous version as well; that way if
somethingf crashes while saving you'll at least have a clean copy of
your last-saved work on your hard drive.

In Wordworth 7.x, the auto spellcheck has become something that
highlights all misspelled words with access to a popup of suggested
alternatives.  A good idea but it insists on going through the entire
file instead of just from the point you start typing onward.  This slows
things down a LOT on my 060, especially with any file longer then a few
pages. Turn it off or go back to version 6.x.
