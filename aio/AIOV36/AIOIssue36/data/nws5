The third Kickstart Show is nearing and already we have a fantastic line-up of
activities and stands for you.
{p} {p}
In addition to the two Amiga A1200 Magic Packs from Amiga Inc (one to be given
away in a prize draw for all show goers, the other exclusively for Kickstart
members), a host of hardware from Analogic and Epic and software from Forematt
to give away, we have over 25 stands selling new and second user Amiga software
and hardware, and demonstrating Amiga applications.
{p} {p}
In our Games Arena, we have multiplayer Quake and Multiplayer Super Skidmarks
contests running (see our web site for the advance sign-up form). You can win a
host of prizes from joysticks to hard drives.
{p} {p}
You also have the chance to buy the fully registered version of the incredibly
popular and equally impressive Moovid video player software. Registering
software with overseas authors is often difficult and time-consuming - at the
Kickstart Amiga Show you can do it in £ Stirling and immediately. All this and
more is already confirmed, with more to be added in the coming weeks.
