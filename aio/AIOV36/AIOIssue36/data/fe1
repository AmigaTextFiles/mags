A lot of you may have noticed (understatement here) that Aminet has been
having some problems of late.  Wade goes down so Paderborn becomes the
main site, then Paderborn is down, up, down, another US site becomes the 
main one but then {italics}everyone's{noitalics} down...  Even when 
there's something up when was the last time you saw a RECENT file with a
{italics}recent{noitalics} date on it?

Aminet has long been the vehicle by which the Amiga Community stays
alive. Without it programs don't get updated, new ones get harder to
find, and in general things stagnate. If either the Classic or NextGen 
Amiga is to thrive, then so must Aminet.
{p} {p}
In other words, it is to Amiga's benefit that Aminet be properly
maintained and kept {bold}up{nobold}. My proposal then, to any officials
of Amiga that might be reading this, should be obvious.  The main Aminet 
site should be maintained by Amiga itself. This would provide them yet 
another way of keeping in touch with the Community, allow them to easily 
upload their own patches and updates, and even set aside directories
devoted to the NextGen Amiga.

And while we're on the subject, another suggestion for Aminet. Spawn
all those MODs off into their {bold}own{nobold} completely separate
site. An over-ridge of MODs is part of the reason why Aminet's always
having problems; make them two separate sites and end of problem (and
end of paging through all those MODs on the RECENT file to find the
actual programs).  In fact, put all the pictures (who's tired of screen 
grabs?) as well as MODs into a separate site and call it something like
Aminet-Multimedia.

So Amiga, if your're watching, take heed and take control of Aminet
before your supporters become fewer still.
