Well, summer is almost upon us (for those of us North of the Equator, at
least), so it's getting kinda hot out there.  What better solution to
the outdoor heat then some indoor web-surfing in your (hopefully) air-conditioned
room.  So to help out, here's a few sites to get you started.

Amiga People On The Net{p}
http://home.t-online.de/home/kuehn-gmund/english.html{p}
A nice world-wide list of all Amiga users who have registered through
this site, grouped by country. Register and share your presence with other Amiga people.
There's a link at the top of the front page to the German version.

Amiga University{p}
http://www.amigau.com{p}
Designed as a central location for information of all things Amiga, be
it Hardware, OS, jumper settings, etc., it still appears to be a site in
the midst of development. It does have the tech specs of the various
Amiga flavors up there, but the promised help on Internet, DTP,
programming, sound and graphics, are either empty or little more then
links pages. A good site to keep an eye on for future development.

Name That Candybar{p}
http://www.smm.org/sln/tf/c/crosssection/namethatbar.html{p}
Simple enough; presented with a series of cross-sectional candybar
pictures you are to identify which brand of candybar it is before
clicking on the picture for the answer.

University Of Life{p}
http://www.universityoflife.com{p}
Name a test and it's here. From Fun tests like typing, soup personality
test, and romance, to Serious tests for IQ, emotional, and personality.
even how to beat any real-life tests. Lots of fun.

Gynoid Gallery- Fembots On Film{p}
http://www.gynoid.com{p}
What better way to start the summer then a bit of oggling at cinema's
overlooked genre: fembots, female androids.  Nothing pornographics, just
clean fun and ignoring any sort of politically correct concerns about
the nature of such a genre.
{p} {p}
First up is the Master List; a list of fembots in everything from Anime
to Electra Woman & Dyna Girl, several with links to more information
included.  The ones with linbks each lead to a small gallery of sample
pics from the given film of the fembot in question and a few lines of
explanatory text. Then the Update Page gives a quick update of what's
been added to the gallery.
{p} {p}
Snapsshots is a gallery of headshots of assorted fembots; click on one
for en enlarged image and to see if you were right about which film or
television series it came from.  The Latest Pics links is a page of raw
pics of even more fembots, grouped by what they appeared in and a one
line synopsis; be warned though, this last takes a while to load
because of all the thumbnails.

If you're curios about where some of the more obscure movies were found,
then the SOurces pages will help you out.  Else, maybe you can go to the
Help page to see if you can help him locate some missing titles.  The
Acquiring page will also tell you how to locate titles on and off the
Web. Links will also tell you where on the Web to go for more of the
same thing.
{p} {p}
Finally there's a Trivia page in which you can try your hand at matching
actreses with the characters played and in which movie.  Good luck on this one though, there's some pretty
obscure stuff here.
{p} {p}
So, browse the pages and have some fun, but just don't think of dating
any; at least one of them's dating a toaster.
