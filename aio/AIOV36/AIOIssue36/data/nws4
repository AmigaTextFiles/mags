Ben Yoris of Hyperion has confirmed that they will be bringing Alien Nations to
the Amiga, as he writes here:
{p} {p}
"Alien Nations is a real-time strategy game in the vein of "The Settlers", which
was enthusiastically received by the German speaking public and press. The game
is set on an alien planet inhabited by three very distinct races: the Pimmons,
the Amazons and the Sajikis and features campaigns consisting of 10 single
player missions per race, set against a giant 3D back-drop. Resource-management,
diplomacy, research, commerce and battle are key to success. The Amiga version
will most likely require a graphics card and will support PPC accelerators
through WarpOS although the feasibility of a 68060 version will be examined.
Optional 3D acceleration will be supported through Warp3D. Release is expected
during Q3 of 2000."
