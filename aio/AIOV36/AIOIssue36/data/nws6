Danny Y. Wong, author, writes: "With much considerations I have decided to
release StarGate as freeware to the Amiga community. The latest version v2.5
contains bug fixes and minor features. Additional features have not yet been
implemented and may not be in the future. StarGate is premier email and news
client for the Amiga. It requires MUI v3.6 and greater. Please go to
http://www.toysoft-dev.com for the download. You will be required to download
the v2.1 archive first."
