air your views to the Amiga public. No matter what you want to say,
write in and we'll most likely publish it.

A good Amiga user, who is very helpful in Amiga
related topics aswell as life topics, Don Benson is
selling his Amiga to take care of family business,
I won't go into detail, i'm sure he doesn't want his
life story spread across the magazine.
{p} {p}
He has helped me on a number of occations aswell as
sending me some very worthwhile emails on Amiga and
other subjects.
{p} {p}
Keep up the good work Don!
{p} {p}
Although he might not ever see this I hope and give
my best wishes for the future. Nice work mate!

... Hey, idea for a new article even ;)? Amiga Heros,
I guess bugging Mark is a good idea as I don't call
the shots round here anymore. We have alot of well
known names in the Amiga market but hows about a new
area called Amiga Heros or similar for those unsung
heros, I put Don Benson up for the first award.
{p} {p}
Anyways, like the mag, keep it up!
{p} {p}
See you all soon.
