"Due to lack of time, I've decided to release webPlug, mapPlug and tablePlug as
freeware. While not giving up with the projects, I won't be able to update them
for the next months, so I've decided to upload webPlug v2beta, mapPlug v1.42 and
tablePlug v1.2 to the Aminet, and release them as freeware. Also, my website is
currently down... I hope to have it online again soon. I'd like to thank all the
people who has registered the software, for their help and support."
