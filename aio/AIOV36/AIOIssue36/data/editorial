Well, welcome to the issue that almost wasn't. Just about anything
possible to go wrong with getting an issue out did. Like what you
ask? Allow me to elucidate.
{p} {p}
Lorens, our Utilities editor, had his hand munched on by a hungry CPU
fan. Painful enough, you can only imagine what this did to his typing
abilities. Hope you're feeling better Lorens.

Hugo, our Games editor had some motherboard problems, and then a fatal
hard drive crash but mere days before the deadline, loosing all data,
including his AIO reviews. Another hard drive installed and {bold}that{nobold}
kicks the bucket. Bad controller apparently.  Couldn't be more worse timed.
{p} {p}
Then there's myself (saving the worst for last, here). On May 13th my
father passed away; you can only imagine the crimp this can put in the
whole idea of schedualing.
{p} {p}
Throw in the usual amount of people with final exams and you begin to
get the idea.
{p} {p}
Still, I'm not here seeking sympathy or to make excuses, just to let you
know why oine of your favorite online mags is running a bit late.

Okay, enough of that.

I've been hearing some rumblings from friends of mine that are former
Amiga users. Word has been slowly trickling out about the new hope for
Amiga that the new owners represent, and interest is starting to very
cautiously peak. People have been expressing their interest that if a
next generation Amiga comes out (hopefully this year) they
{italics}will{noitalics} re-enter the Amiga world with a brand new
system, especially if there is proper software support and the ability
to run PC and Mac software.
{p} {p}
The legions of old Amiga fans are waiting to return, a whole world of
Wintel users waiting with baited breath for a viable new platform to
displace an OS that not even the people who program it like.  Amiga's
actions have stirred interest, but their silence may seem too frustrating
and make the time until final nextGen release seem interminable. But
impatience is a relatve thing; the new Amiga has only been at it since
January, so the promise of a new system later this year is a near
miracle.
{p} {p}
Still, Amiga should not grow lax. Thi is the {bold}last{nobold} chance,
with with Microsoft on the legal ropes no more perfect a timing could be
asked for. Keep it coming Amiga, and make it something a bit more then
occasional news quips and tee-shirts. The world awaits, for Amiga may
very well be the salvation of the modern computer world.

The Community are not the only ones that now wait.
