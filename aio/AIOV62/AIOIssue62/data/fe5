T>his month the subject is Web Pages.  Specifically, their design as
seen from the point of view of your average 'Net browser (more
specicially, myself, of course).  Most of this one would think to be
common sense but apparently a lot of webmasters and web design
programs have a severe lack of that.
{pp}
The bulk of the problems arrise from designers getting caught up with
buzz words like "Java" and "Flash" and figure these are the do-all and
end-all for "hip" web pages.  Well, most of the time "hip" just sucks
up bandwidth and makes browers more crash-prone.  I'm not saying these
new technologies aren't good- they are, when {italic}properly{noitalic}
used- but over-use of something inappropriate just gets you blotted
pages and poor design,
{pp}
First off, before you go using Javascript, see if first the same
function can be done with standard HTML; HTML being more rock-stable,
this is the preferred method.  I've seen too many pages where they use
javascript just to open up a new browser window or go to a clicked-on
link.  These can not only be done in HTML but with far less hassel (no
script errors, no question of browser compatibility, etc.).  Use
javascript where it actually makes a {bold}difference{nobold} in how
something is done and the way it looks (those cyclcing menu buttons
are a perfect example).
{pp}
I've even seen a site wher the {bold}entire{nobold} page was in 100%
Javascript.  There is NO reason for this, use the minimum you need to
get done what you want and you will ensure lower bandwidth and better
presentation.
{pp}
Same goes for Flash.  Flash is great for complex graphics and fancy
menus, but I've seen pages where after waiting for several minutes for
the Flash to load and several more for it to decode, it turns out to
be some little animation that could have been done with a four-frame
gifanim.  If you can do it with a gif-anim and Java then do so; save
Flash for what will really benefit from it, people with slower modems
will really appreciate you for it.
{pp}
A good rule of thumb is HTML first, then Java (or gifanims) then
Flash.  HTML-->Java--->Flash.
{pp}
If you're going to have a fancy background, then never assume that
other people's default settings for font color will look good on top
of it. Set your own defaults in each page for font and background
colors then view it to make sure the text is readable.  You may think
that pink on yellow is beautiful but ever try reading it on a monitor?
(and remember, a lot of us have {italic}cheap{noitalic} monitors).
{pp}
A note on jpegs vs gifs.  If your picture is 256 colors or less, then
use Gif.  Jpeg is great for making smaller files of many-colored
pictured, but for those low color counts, Gif actually makes files that
are {italic}smaller{noitalic} then jpeg.  compare it yourself and
you'll see.
{pp}
Now let's talk Frames.  Several sites out there can benefit from the
use of Frames.  How many times have you sen a page with a menu list
to the left, you click on som,ething, then the entire page reloads
complete with a fresh copy of the same menu.  This is when you might
consider a frame for the reload stuff and the constant menu stuff on
the main page section.  Frames is one of the more advanced functions of
HTML coding that can greatly reduce loading times and this save
bandwidth.
{pp}
Remember, the keys to good web pages are small file size, stability,
and viewability.  Don't use a new wiz-bang feature unless your page
really {bold}calls{nobold} for it.  And when you're finished,
{italic}view it in your own browser{noitalic}.  An amazing number of
sites look like the designer's never seen his own page.  Then when it
looks good in your browser, ask a couple of friende to view it on their
systems with {italic}their{noitalic} own browsers (ones different from
the browser that you use).  Go through every link and feature, and
then view it not just from your hard drive but from off the Internet
where other people are going to see it.  If the loading speeds seem
too slow to you then chances are there are others out there that won't
be waiting that long to see what you have to offer.  At that point it's
time to trim (reduce some of those Flash files to a gifanim or
Javascript function, or check if the number of colors on those
pictures can be reduced).  Only after this, is your page ready to be
viewed by the public.
{pp}
These are general enough guidelines to not restrict the designer but
rather will enhance a page for anyone viewing it.  Use them and people
just might visit your site more often.
