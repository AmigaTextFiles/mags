The time has come for Thendic-France/bplan to start selling machines.
We are not going to call it the Pegasos for now. We are going to call
the pre-release version of the Pegasos with the pre-release version
of MorphOS for PPC: BETATESTER. MorphOS may not be ready for regular
computer users, but it is ready for developers. This coming weekend
we will begin to sell the machines directly from Thendic-France. We
will sell all 15 machines we take with us for the SLACH PARTY CONTEST
in Bordeaux to people that agree to join «Team Betatester». We can
take as many orders as there is interest. We have decided to do this
because in two weeks we will begin to receive delivery of the first
*1000* lot of BETATESTER mainboards. These will be completely
configured and ready to sell to developers who join Team Betatester
by Thendic-France. (Note: any mainboards not sold as BETATESTERS will
be sold with firmware only to our Linux distributors).
