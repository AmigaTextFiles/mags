Okay, so how many of you are Amiga Club Lifers like me?  Hmm, I don't
see enough hands raised up out there.  Well, no matter; more will
come.  Build it and they will ,come?  Well, some of us came and we've
not seen it built, so that should bode pretty well for when the new
Amiga makes it's appearance.

Yes, we're all impatient, but remember that this is the closest the
Amiga has ever come before to a rebirth.  Think of it; the hardware is
{bold}finished{nobold}, the OS but awaits a few more modules to be
completed, all they need is a marketing plan which I get the feeling
they have covered.  Past time to stop any last squabbling and get all
on the same side.  After all, o matter which faction there is one
thing we can all agree on.  Amiga has {bold}always{nobold} the future.
