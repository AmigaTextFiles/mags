Some of us spend so much time in front of a keyboard that we've lost
track of some aspects of the real world.  So, as a service to computer
users everywhere and Amigan's specifically (since we love our
machines so much, we tend to spend more time then usual before a
keyboard), I present this little primer.  A translation of computer
terminology into equivalent everyday human terms that will help you to
interface with the rest of the world a lot easier.{p}
(You DO understand that this is meant as humor, don't you?).{p}
So, allow me to present my "Computer Terms Applied To People"...
