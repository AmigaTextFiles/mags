Well, end of Summer over here and I still refuse to look through any
serious sites.  Summera are sacred to me and all that.  So, with that
in mind, on with the fun.

Okay, so it's not really a {italic}web{noitalic} site, but if you're
into the Demo Scene and want a good place to download demos from
parties that stretched all the way back to 1989 then this is the place
to go to.  Happy Demo-viewing.

{bold}Sidekick Magazine{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.sidekickmagazine.com/{noitalic}{p}
A monthly online mag supposednly based around those sidekick
characters and faces you know but names that you don't of films and
television, but also includes a number of other Hollywood-bound
subjects.  Movie and book reviews, opinions on such important things
as why are there so many babies in television nowadays, their annual
Kicki Awards (you'll have to delve into thir archives for the last
one, but it includes such things as Best Opening Credits, Worst
Trailer, Most Overexposed Celebrity, The I Don't Get It Award, and a
lot more funny ones), , reviews, and a bunch more.  Nice alternative
to those bigger-blown Movie Mags.

{bold}Villain Supply{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.villainsupply.com/{noitalic}{p}
With tongue firmly in cheek, here is a site to get all you evil-doers
started out right.  Would-be supervillains can buy the latest in
lairs, heavy weapons, doomsday devices, super powers, and a lot more. 
See what the other supervillains are up to (Zombie Shakespeare is
cutomer of the month right now), get some tips on world domination,
and lots more.  Why, I can hardly wait to start my own
world-domination plans!

{bold}So you've decided to be evil{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://evil-guide.tripod.com/{noitalic}{p}
A good companion site to the one above, after you do your evil
shoping there, then come over her for a step by step how-to guide to
being evil.  From your objectives and goals for why you're so evil,
how to thwart the do-gooders, good locatoions for your lair, to the
proper fashions for the evil-doer and how to make your own evil plan. 
Hey, if we're lucky maybe the real-life terrorists will take this
stuff seriously and make it easier to pick them out of a crowd.

{bold}Humor.Com{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.humor.com{noitalic}{p}
Another humor site and as such filled with all sorts of links and
features.  A lot of stuff to go through but let's give it a try.{p}
The jokes and articles section has the expected joke database as well
as such things as your weekly horoscope (say good-bye to free will),
an astrology primer written for and by jerks, all-true News of the Wierd
(designer nipples anyone?), and other fun stuff.{p}
Diversions has a fun variety of games to play, cincluding a
cartoon-caption contest, an internet-based crosswords, Wacky Faces,
the ever-classic Hangman as brought to you by the creator of the
Pepsi Girl Wheel of Death, and several others.  Under Toons and Videos
you'll find just that, with several humorous comic strips, funny
videos and other things to waste your summertime with.  The Photo
Gallery contains actual photos of funny sights, and then topping
things off is the occasional "interview" with selected commedians.{p}
All in all a good laugh and more then enough things to keep one
busy... at least until next month.
