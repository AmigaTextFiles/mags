You don`t say what version of Accelerator you have?
{pp}
You can upgrade to at least 32MB of RAM by replacing exisiting Fast RAM with
a 32MB simm.{p}
I would seriously consider getting a SVGA monitor and ScanDoubler to replace
the old 1084.{p}
Get a CDROM Drive is essential. Get an IDE interface board and then you can
fit 4 IDE drives! {p}
If you can afford it get a CDR/CDRW as well!{p}
You can use upto 4GB Hard disks with WB 3.1, 10GB or more you need Workbench
3.9 and you get Internet software included as well!
{pp}
Unfortunately, I don`t know of any new Software you can get, as its rather
poor at present.
