After more than a year of development and testing, the final version
of SoundFX 4.2 has finally been released! The program can be
downloaded from here. Make sure you get LZX archives, as the LHA
archives still contain V4.1.

WinUAE/AmigaXL/Amithlon users can try the 060 version. It should run
without any problems on their systems. The list of new features and
bugfixes is here.

SoundFX is a powerful sound-processing package for AmigaOS, developed
by Stefan Kost. For a shareware price it offers professional
features, many of which are quite unique on the Amiga. It is a real
must for every Amiga sound designer or music producer.
