19.8.2002

IOUSB, developed by IOSPIRIT, is a system for USB-device-drivers that
allows them to access USB stacks via a uniform API. Thus any driver
that builds upon it can theoretically be used with every USB-stack on
the AMIGA.
{pp}
Apart from the already existing support for Poseidon (Highway/Subway,
MorphOS), support has been added for the Sirion-stack (Thylacine,
Highway/Subway) in cooperation with the AmigaOS 4.0 development team.
Thus it is now also possible to use devices covered by IOUSB with the
Thylacine USB-board and the upcoming AmigaOS 4.0.
{pp}
The update to version 2.0 can be found on our download-page. It also
contains an update to version 1.1 of the iousbscanner.device fixing a
timing-problem with the Epson Perfection 1650.
