"[..] Nevertheless I think its time for a brief update.{p}
Many developer board purchasers were clearly motivated by the 10% discount
rather than their ability to contribute to the developer process.
The initial boards were therefore shipped to those who could make a
real contribution to developing drivers etc, and porting Linux/UAE
distributions. Their progress has been astounding in my opinion
with no less than 5 different linux distributions (SuSE, Debian,
Mandrake, Yellow Dog and TurboLinux) being ported within a couple of weeks.

However the Softex open firmware we had originally shipped with the
developer boards (incidently as seen on the Pegasos video) has several
shortcomings (although this has been used to boot the 5 linux
distributions and the OS4 kernel) and we are currently developing/extending
the alternative PPCBoot open firmware for use on the production
AmigaOne boards. This will allow us to build in Amiga- specific
boot etc options, a well as a more comprehensive multi-boot environment."
