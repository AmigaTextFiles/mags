This is a message for traditional {bold}Amiga Community{nobold}
Resellers.
{pp}
Since our involvement and the earliest threats against MorphOS, we
have had German and European experts checking the applicable law. If
fact, in spite of the latest threats, we are looking forward to the
timely release of MorphOS.
{pp}
A word about the past: the spirit of {bold}Amiga{nobold} rose from the demise of
Commodore with what was an incredibly well designed and functional
operating system. It became one of the first examples of "forward
compatibility." A word about the present: MorphOS is ready to take
the first step to co-exist with this internationally appreciated
example of software engineering that has generated a distinctive
Community of Users, Developers and Resellers.
{pp}
We would like to address our potential Resellers. What will be our
future relationship with you? Well, we tried one approach. It worked
for the Linux market, but not for your market. Nearly all of you
wanted the same thing"– a Pegasos running MorphOS to test. You will
have that now. You can buy one this week or next month, or whenever
they want. There will be many available soon. You will find MorphOS
for the PPC is something new. Before, MorphOS was a kernel, which
ran on the PPC, but required AmigaOS files to be able to run Amiga
applications. Now it is different. MorphOS is the complete core of
the Pegasos and can function as a complete operating system. No
additional files are required to achieve this. To be completely
clear, what MorphOS is today is not what {italic}MorphOS{noitalic} was before (and
what is still available today online). MorphOS today is different.
It is a great accomplishment and a credit to Ralph Schmidt and his
team to have MorphOS where it is today, but that will not stop us
from making it better. You won't be wasting your time and effort
when you begin to sell these machines.
{pp}
We have decided that while there was a Community suave enough to
handle the Pegasos and MorphOS as it was, the regular computer user
was not, and frankly initially, neither were the Resellers. Our
original concept did not work well. We had only one reseller in this
Community order ten boards until two weeks ago when we had three
more place orders (two of them for a very decent size), but this was
slow enough in coming that we understood we needed to take another
approach. We sent back their money or did not accept it. We had a
bad dream about an OS based website dedicated to The Best 100 Bug
Fixes -- have you heard of that before? We woke up.
{pp}
Ladies and Gentleman, we need to remember that the target is regular
computer users, who are {bold}new{nobold} users and who represent new markets
for this Community. A little economic success could improve plenty
of things around here " for Developers, for Resellers, and
ultimately for Users themselves " so we decided MorphOS needed to be
ready for them, and you. That is why there will be a few steps.
{pp}
Step One: The “Betatester” with MorphOSv.90{p}
Step Two: Pegasos with MorphOSv1.0{p}
Step Three: The Pegasos Handheld with MorphOSv1.0+
{pp}
But, in this post we will stick to our Resellers and our message to
them. We will come back to Developers and Team Betatester after this
weekend in Bordeaux at the SLACH PARTY. Later, we will describe in
detail our hardware plans here and all the peripherals we plan on
introducing. We have plenty of things to share and we will do it
here on www.morphos-news.de
{pp}
The cost of the Pegasos will fall in the next production runs. We
will keep optimizing and as we do there will be more profit to
carved up. Right now, we are just spending money. Releasing a
product with no strings attached that is not ready for a "regular
computer user" is commercial suicide. We cannot afford to do that,
but we need to begin to cover our investment and we need to take a
straight line to the commercial /regular consumer release point. We
need to get going!
{pp}
So, here is our promise to our Resellers: we will have a product you
can release to "regular computer users" in December. We intend to
fully support the computer show being planned in Aachen that month.
We will not only have an operating system to release, but a few
applications, including a game that will surprise even the normal
fans.
{pp}
Just to make sure that is clear:
{pp}
We will ship Pegasos boards to all Resellers by 2 December 2002, if
not before.

If you have comments or questions you can email us at
bbrv@thendic-france.com
{pp}
We will also present our Pegasos Handheld Prototype in December!
Keep your eyes on this site for the latest updates!
