Listed below are the modules that make up the core of AmigaOS
4. Most of the OS modules (including the kernel) are finished
and being tested internally by the OS 4 development team.{p}
Current work centers around Intuition and Reaction, 2D/3D
drivers, A1 Bios, additional kernel functionality (virtual
addressing and page-based memory handling) and the integration
of the 68K emulation into the system.
{pp}
Here are the modules that make up AmigaOS 4:
{pp}
{pp}
Exec Second Generation (Exec SG){p}
Exec is the AmigaOS kernel and was written in 68K assembly
for AmigaOS 3.1. It has been rewritten in C, as ExecSG, for AmigaOS 4.
{pp}
The following features are planned for ExecSG:{p}
       Hardware abstraction layer (HAL){p}
       Virtual addressing (for automatic stack enlargement etc.){p}
       Page-based memory handling (less fragmentation and more efficient){p}
       Virtual memory{p}
       New library interface{p}
       Resource tracking and management{p}
       Optional memory protection{p}
       WarpOS backwards compatibility
