Assembly '02, the largest demoscene event, is held on August 1st -
4th in Helsinki, Finland. The multiplatform invitation intro,
including Amiga and C64 versions, is now available. Amiga will be
part of the event as usual. Last year Intuition's creator, RJ Mical,
presented the prize for the Amiga demo Lapsuus that won the combined
PC/Amiga competition. For 24 hour coverage of the event, see MBnet
