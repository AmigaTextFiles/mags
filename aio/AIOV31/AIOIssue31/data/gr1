Gladiator Duel is a small game in which two rough and tough Gladiators
have to battle it out in an arena until one is dead. Both armed with
swords you click and move and click and move then click for your life,
the one who clicks the most ends up winning.

In this I mean there is only one move, press the joystick button for
player one or the right alt key for player two and the sword swings,
keep clicking until the other player is dead. Both players have an
energy bar which goes down the more a player is hit. The game comes
with swords hitting each other noise and a groan from the player when
they are hit.

I downloaded this game in joy as it sounded great but the reality was
that it is one of the poorest games I've played. The actual idea and
movement is there but the full potential of this game is no-where near
being realised. It could of been a good game but instead its not, avoid
it at all costs and it'll be of no loss to you.
