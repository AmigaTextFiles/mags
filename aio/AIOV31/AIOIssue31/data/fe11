Well, it's been a month since I installed 3.5, so now here I am with some
of those minor annoyances that you only notice in the long term. Certainly
somethings which Amiga should address, and possibly even something which
might affect one's productivity. Well, at any rate, here they are.
{p} {p}
First off the WBPattern prefs program. If you've used the FastIPrefs
version you know that it has an option to set "Tiles" versus "Center" as
the way in which a picture is displayed. Well, no such luck here; the
new Iprefs is missing such a useful feature and should be given one in
the next update.

Fortunately the old IPrefs WBPattern works just as well with the new
OS3.5 IPrefs, so you can switch to that with no problem.

Now a more serious bug. Apparently the new FastFileSystem is not quite
bug free. On my daily multi-hour bout of working with my word processor,
after my end of day habit of saving to hard drive then backing up on
floppy, I discovered that the floppy wouldn't be recognized until after
a reboot. This happened not once but every single day. The floppy was
still a good one, a fact I proved by disabling the new FileSystem by
removing the AmigaRom patch file and observing it operate as normal.
Running Diskchange will sometimes help this, but too many such disk
swaps will crash DFx:.

Two weeks on the new FFS and having it have trouble recognizing a normal
double density FFS floppy, then 2 weeks back on the old FFS and seeing
it operate like it should. Something tells me there's a bug around
here. Considering it's the File system, it's a bug that Amiga should
quickly address (Note to the folks at Amiga: don't wait for the next
official update, load her up on the main site).

If you've found any annoying new "features" in the OS update, then please
share them with everyone by emailing them to me at the standard
address.
