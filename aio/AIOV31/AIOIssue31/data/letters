As we all celebrate Christmas and the New Year, or try to avoid
Christmas if you do no celebrate it, we seem to have forgotten our
old friend AIO and the team. There where NO direct letters wishing
us a Merry Christmas, oh well. I did receive an email from {bold}Börje
Karlsson{nobold} wishing us a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, so hello
and thankyou, Börje.

Woof!  What a shock when I read the article downplaying Amiga Inc.  It
hit hard and I nearly lost all faith in my machine of so many years. 
It was only when I read the letter by Barry Riddiford did I realize
that your article was a "Think about it" kind of article and not a
realization.  Boy, was I relieved.{p}
Although your article does make you think, I shutter to think that I
would have to use any other machine than my trusty Amy.  Let's hope
that all goes well at Amiga and we see a truly amazing marvel rise up
from the smoke.
