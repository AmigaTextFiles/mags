An oldie I want to bring back to all Amigans over X-Mas! ;)

First of all, what is it, well, it's a very small program that puts a string of
lights under the titlebar on your WB (looks silly if you use a hack that removes
the tilebar...), and it will then flash them in the order/speed that you set in
the preferences.
{p} {p}
There is no installation, just make sure that the WB uses atleast 32 colours and
then start it.

The author claims he whipped it up a day before christmas, and I do really believe
it, since he didn't care so much about Enfocer/CyberGuard hits, everytime any of
the lamps flashes, it will give a hit, so the only sensible way to use this is to
disable Enforcer/CyberGuard under christmas...
{p} {p}
But I think it's worth to have a less stable computer under christmas, since I
just love the X-Mas spirit!
{p} {p}
As I said, this is a very old program (150 weeks old when writing this)... So I
guess that no fix is on the way, I just wish that someone would write a better
program that does this, maybe with transparent window around the lamps, no hits
etc...

Well, use this tool on your own risk...
