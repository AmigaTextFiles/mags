Vaporware have updated MicroDot 1 for Year 2000 compliance. This doesn't
affect MicroDot II users; this is only for the older German language
program.

Also new at Vaporware is an update of the NetInfo 2 program to version 2.5.
This program is an excellent tool for diagnosing networks, doing name
lookups of hosts, and best of all - a graphic showing the route and
bandwidth to a server through whatever countries you need to pass through.
