Bubble Heroes is a new Amiga version of an old arcade style game.
You may have already heard about this game in various news and
press releases. Well, hear no more, AmigActive are bringing you the
chance to test this game for the first time.

As the name would suggest Bubble Heroes is a puzzle game. I am not
actually sure what the first version of this game was called but
for any of you that know of the game 'Puzzle Bobble' then you should
surely know what I am talking about.

If you have no clue as to what this new game is going to be about
then let me take a few minutes of your time to explain.
{p} {p}
The general idea of this game is similar to tetris and many other
puzzle games, the view is opposite to tetris in that you shoot
upwards. Thebig difference is that you shoot coloured balls of all
the same shape and size, and of course you get to choose when you
release each ball. Your idea is to match three or more of the same
coloured balls so that they group together and fall off the screen
taking any balls below with them.
{p} {p}
If you take too long then more balls will add to the screen and
as in tetris if they get so far down they touch where the balls
are being released the game is over.

I was never really a big fan of these types of games but Bubble
Heroes has really got me going and i'm looking forwards to seeing
the full game when it is released.
{p} {p}
One of the major things that keeps you entertained is that you have
two players, so you are actually competing with another person or
the computer to see who can be the best.
{p} {p}
Overall this looks like it could be a brilliant puzzle game and something
we would be greatful to see in the dwindling Amiga market.
