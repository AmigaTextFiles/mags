As you may have heard, Holger Kruse, of Miami fame, is leaving the
majority of his Amiga development behind to take on a job for REBOL. He
seems enthusiastic about this, but it means no more Java development due
to some conflict of interest between Java and REBOL. The full letter
from his site is given below, but frankly if someone's choosing between
Java or Rebol as a big multi-platform hit then I think that Rebol will
just cost the Amiga precious development time while the rest of the
world gets thoroughly entrenched in Java.
{p} {p}
Be that as it may, here's the letter to judge for yourselves...
{p} {p}
Changes for the year 2000
{p} {p}
I am happy to announce that starting January, 2000 I will work for
REBOL Technologies in the capacity of Director of Network
Technologies.
{p} {p}
For those of you who have not heard about that company before:  REBOL
Technologies (www.rebol.com) is a privately held company that was
founded by Carl Sassenrath, one of the premier developers of AmigaOS.
REBOL Technologies develops and distributes the scripting language
REBOL, a very intuitive programming language and run-time environment
with built-in Internet support and messaging capabilities. REBOL is
available for over 50 computer platforms, AmigaOS being one of them. 
The basic version of REBOL is available for free, extensions are
available for license fees.
{p} {p}
Declining revenues from Amiga software sales and increased software
piracy in 1999 finally forced me to look for a full-time job outside
of my own company. Between several job offers I decided to accept
the offer by REBOL for several reasons. The most important one is
that in my opinion REBOL is currently one of the few truly innovative
products in the software market, and with Carl Sassenrath's history
with AmigaOS his company and its product in many ways reflect and
represent the Amiga spirit.
{p} {p}
With my background in AmigaOS and TCP/IP I am excited about the
opportunity to participate in the development of REBOL, in particular
in the improvement of its networking capabilities, the AmigaOS port
and ports for possible Amiga successors.
{p} {p}
I am afraid this new job means that I will no longer be able to work
full-time on my own Amiga software (Miami, Daytona etc.). This does
not mean that the software becomes unsupported or that I am leaving
the Amiga platform though. I intend to still provide updates and
support for existing software, as my time permits. Here are some
details about current plans for my Amiga software:
{p} {p}
- AmiWin:  still supported. An update with 24-bit support and a
newer X11R6 kernel is still planned, but unlikely to be ready soon.
{p} {p}
- Daytona and related products: I am afraid Daytona and its planned
extensions have to be cancelled. There are two reasons for this: one
is lack of time:  with my new full-time job I have to cut back
somewhere, and doing it on a project that is still in development
seems to be the most reasonable solution. The other reason is a
possible conflict of interests, because Java and REBOL are
competitors in the market of languages for distributed computing,
which may make it unethical for me to remain involved in Java-related
software. I have not yet determined what will happen to the Daytona
sources. There are several options, somewhat restricted by Sun's
licensing conditions, and I will try to find a solution that will
somehow still allow the existing Java VM of Daytona to be released to
the Amiga community, without future involvement or support from me
though.
{p} {p}
- Miami: still fully supported. Version 3.3 is planned for release
in the year 2000.
{p} {p}
- Miami Deluxe: fully supported. After several delays and many
improvements the first full release including documentation will
probably be ready before Christmas, and after that development will
continue. Subject to demand the planned improvements for future
versions may include IPv6, IPsec, named, extensions to IP-NAT and
possibly dial-in support.
{p} {p}
- MiamiSSL:  fully supported. A new version that incorporates the
latest OpenSSL changes and protocols is planned.
{p} {p}
- MiamiTelnet: fully supported, as part of the Miami Deluxe package.
Telnet encryption and support for running in a shell window are
planned for future versions.
{p} {p}
- ppp.device: still supported, but no new versions are planned.
Miami and Miami Deluxe should be considered successors of ppp.device.
{p} {p}
- ReOrg: not supported at this time. A version with support for NSD
and disks > 4 GB is something I am considering though, time
permitting.
{p} {p}
I will also have to move my residence from Winter Park, Florida to
Ukiah, California, where REBOL headquarters are located. This means
my LAN will have to move as well, including the server that handles
Miami registrations and orders. Because of that there will be some
service outages affecting my Internet presence during the months of
December '99 and possibly January 2000. Please see my separate
announcements about that.  On the up side, chances are my LAN will
get a DSL connection in Ukiah, which should provide better
reliability and much faster responses, in particular for mailing
lists, than the current 56k connection.
{p} {p}
Wishing everyone a happy holiday season and a successful year 2000.
