Well, it's turning out to be a gamer's month - Hyperion has announced that
they've aquired a license to port Decent Freespace:The Great War.  No
release date on that at present I'm afraid, but expect more information in
the coming months as it approaches being finished.  System requirements?
Well, it'll certainly need 3D hardware!
