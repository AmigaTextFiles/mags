Well, Well, it must be the month that I plug AmigActive as many
times as possibly allowed by the editor.. oh. thats me. Well anyway,
looking back to the first issue of AmigActive there is an article
regarding the various companies and interested parties that visited
their website after announcing the Linux situation and publishing
an article on their website about it.

Mark Tierno, the Articles editor for our very fine production jumped
ahead of the crowd and announced the unknown news that a group called
ADA where suing Gateway for loss of earnings etc. This caused a
massive surge in hits to our website with a log of over 3mb for the
first few hours. Considering the scale of our magazine compared to
others the size of that text only log is pretty impressive. It is
very rare for me to check the logs of who visted the site and in a
stupid error on my part I deleted this log.

When remembering about the AmigActive article on who visited their
site after an 'interesting' news item. I decided to check the log of
hits on our site. The section I took a glace at was from 12th December
to 26th December 1999.

We have not put any breaking news stories or articles on the website
and so I did not expect there to be many interesting hosts logged but
taking a look through you will be supprised to see what types of
hosts are looking and the places many of you Amiga users must work.

There where many US government organisations taking a peek at our
site, Delta Air, Philips, teleglobe.net, US Military organisations,
terracom.net, boeing.com, Hewlett Packard (US), synopsys.com,
ip3000.com, Microsoft (US), emry.net, IBM (US), schneidercheese.com,
Epson (Hong Kong), {bold}Gateway{nobold} (US), emrl.com, IBM (Japan),
Disney.
{p} {p}
There where many more companies listed, many web caches, and many
people from countries like Singapore & Japan aswell as one from
New Caledonia.
{p} {p}
It seems that although we only know we are read in 35 countries, there
are many more readers out there.

Of course, because we have visits from some well known companies, they
could really represent anything. I seriously doubt SchneiderCheese
is looking into the Amiga market and more simpily can be explained by
maybe one of their workforce are an Amiga user. Although we can not
for sure say that Microsoft or Boeing etc are looking into the Amiga
market, it would show the vast ray of jobs us Amiga users hold in some
of the leading companies.
