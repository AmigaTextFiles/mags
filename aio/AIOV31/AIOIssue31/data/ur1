{subhead} AmigaAMP vs. AMPlifier{def}{p}
Review by Lorens Johansson

{p} {p}

Okay, I did this test back in AIO Issue 25, but since then AmigaAMP and AMPlifier
have been developed and enhanced so I think it's time to redo that review now...
{p} {p}
The question still is: Which MPEG Audio Layer 3 (MP3) player is the best to choose?
(From these two!)
{p} {p}
The versions that I used in the old test was AmigaAMP 2.6 BETA 3 and AMPlifier 1.55.
But now the versions are: AmigaAMP 2.7 (FINAL) and AMPlifier 2.10!
{p} {p}
The first thing that came to mind when testing these is to see how CPU hungry they
are, I use the Top command from Executive in the tests!
{p} {p}
The test machine used:{p}
Amiga 1200, Blizzard 060@50 MHz, 16MB Ram, AGA, 7200 RPM IDE HD and DOpus 5.82.
(Using MPEGA.library 2.4 (060FPU) )
{p} {p}
The MP3 file used for testing:{p}
Artist  : DJ Jurgen features Alice Deejay{p}
Title   : Better Off Alone{p}
Album   : <none?>{p}
Size    : 4.334.456 bytes{p}
Length  : 04:30{p}
Other   : 128bps / Joint-Stereo / 44100Hz / MPEG 1.0 Layer 3
{p} {p}
Settings: AmigaAMP{p}
Quality : High{p}
FreqDiv : 1:2{p}
          Stereo{p}
LoadBuf : 64kB{p}
PlayBuf : 0.5s{p}
TaskPri : 1{p}
(AMPlifiers settings are EXACTLY the same, except that it has a 1s playbuf instead
of 0.5s as AmigaAMP does!)
{p} {p}
The AmigaAMP percentage is PlayTask + DrawTask!{p}
The AMPlifier percentage is MPEG Decoder + AMPlifier + AMPlifier Visualization!
{p} {p}
AmigaAMP:{p}
Total w/o visualization: 45.57-46.56{p}
Total w/  visualization: 55.07-55.86
{p} {p}
AMPlifier:{p}
Total w/o visualization: 48.05-48.76{p}
Total w/  visualization: 55.46-56.39
{p} {p}
When skin was used, it was the SnorsleX skin for both AmigaAMP and AMPlifier
that I used. Both AmigaAMP and AMPlifier used the Analyzermode Lines (Vertical)
with peaks. Both had the playlist window open at all time!
{p} {p}
As you can see, it differs a bit when you are not using the visualization, but
when using that, the difference is very small...
{p} {p}
Both programs have a Playlist, and they can do quite the same things. BUT, in this
area AMPlifier is ALOT faster when it comes to scrolling the playlist... I hope the
AmigaAMP author will change his methods in scrolling to reflect the speed in
AMPlifier.
{p} {p}
Both programs have an Equalizer, and quite obvious, they can do exactly the same things.
There is however one drawback for AMPlifier, when I change the volume on the
volume slider or try to use the Equalizer then AMPlifier will automatically cut
off all Hz's over about 100Hz, that means all I hear is the basstones, until I quit
and restart it :( Not nice, not nice at all!
The AmigaAMP EQ doesn't work on my machine since it requires a PPC processor!
{p} {p}
Both programs have Playlists, and the playlists can do the same stuff!
{p} {p}
Both can, as stated before, use WinAMP skins, they can both skin all the three
windows, but AmigaAMP has a nice little feature here, an animation in the lower
right corner.
{p} {p}
The documentation of AMPlifier is ALOT better than AmigaAMPs, and it also comes
in two languages (English, Deutsch).
{p} {p}
Also, AMPlifier is localized which AmigaAMP isn't...
{p} {p}
Both programs can "dock" to each others windows (if you drag them close enough
they'll attach to eachother), this feature is ALOT better implemented in AMPlifier.
{p} {p}
You can also change so AMPlifier's windows is moved in real time, and this is
amazingly fast on my computer...
{p} {p}
So, which is the best then? That's *very* hard to say, but now I would say that
AmigaAMP is better, since AMPlifier has a very bad bug (the volume/EQ bug)...
But when the AMPlifier author fixes this, then it will be very hard to say which
one is the best!
{p} {p}
The versions used in the test are AmigaAMP 2.7 (FINAL) and AMPlifier 2.10!
