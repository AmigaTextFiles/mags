Just when you thought the world was safe from cheesy names and you thought
you had seen the most cheesy name for a game of all time, a crazy German
man comes up with the title, 'Puzzo Mania'.
{p} {p}
Now, although the game title does make it sounds slightly similar to a
washing machine soap product its actually a very serious and very good
puzzle game.
{p} {p}
You may remember I reviewed a game a few issues back called WBPerplexity,
well this is a similar game in style.
{p} {p}
You are given 60 cute pictures that are jumbled up and you are given a
set amount of time and moves to try and put this picture back together.
The difference between this game is that you slide the bars of picture
section left/right and up/down and do not move single pieces on their
own.
{p} {p}
Its your basic puzzle game with a lot of work gone into it. The graphics
are lovely looking, the music is also very good, I was pleased to here
what I think was a version of "Rule Britania" playing through-out a game
but maybe thats just my British personality hoping it was playing that.
{p} {p}
The pictures that you are playing with as far as I could tell are all
real scans of various animals and are very good on the eye while playing
through the game. Other games of this type have poorly drawn pictures
but this one gives you a sence of satisfaction when you see the picture
complete and in full.

Overall if you like these types of games you will absolutly love this
one, take a look and while away those winter blues.
