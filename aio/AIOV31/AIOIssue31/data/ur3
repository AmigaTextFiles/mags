This is a tool that will make it easier for you to check if your favourite sites
have been updated since you last checked them.
{p} {p}
The installation is very simple, just click your way through the installation steps
and it's done, no other things to do! (The installation script is in two languages,
English and Italian.)
{p} {p}
When you start the program, there is no need to even set anything in the settings
to be able to get it to work (although, it can be nice to customize it a little).
{p} {p}
The usage is very simple, just click the Add button and you will be able to add a
new site to your list. It has a function to get the URL both from the browser and
clipboard, but the "Get from browser" support isn't any good... It works just fine
with AWeb, but it can't get the URL from IBrowse, and it can't get anything from
Voyager... You can also specify different actions that you want to happen when that
specific URL changes!
{p} {p}
Another very nice way of adding URLs is the Import feature, it can import both
AWeb and IBrowse hotlists, but not Voyager's (What does that man have against
Voyager? :-) ).
{p} {p}
When you have added atleast one URL, the program is ready to be used, you then
either click the "Check All" button and all the URLs will be checked, or you mark
the ones you want to be checked, and press "Check Sel"... As easy as that... Then
if a page has been updated, it will say so in the Status field, but for easy-ness,
it will also put that URL in bold style.
{p} {p}
The look of the interface (which is MUI) is very nice... It has some nice buttons
like in Voyager³ (ie, they will get a border when you hold the mouse over them etc),
this enhances the joy of using GuardAmy.
{p} {p}
BUT, GuardAmy could be alot better, because since I got it, it has managed to crash
a few times so I guess I won't use this program so extensively until a new version
comes!
{p} {p}
The documentation is quite extensive really, the author has spent some time to make
the Guide very good for those who actually reads/needs them!
{p} {p}
Also, it's localized, and it comes with a Deutsch and Italian translation.
