Every year, apparently, Wired Magazine holds it's annual Vaporware
Awards, calling upon their readers to nominate the most dissappointing
piece of vaporware or vanishing product of the past year.

Okay, so most of you may already know where this is going. Between
Iwin, AmigaNG and OS 5.0, and everything else that's been assaulted upon
our Community lately, I figure we have a lock on at least winning this
one award. It may be in the Sad But True category, but at least it's
somehting we Know we can win.

So, show your support (or displeasure) of all things Amiga (or all
disappointments Gateway) by sending your nominations to:

I just wish we didn't have such a good chance of winning this one.
