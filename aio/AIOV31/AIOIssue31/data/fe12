As my Xmas present to all of you, I have decided to overlook the OS
barriers and give some helpful tips on how you can get some better use
out of that Windows '98 CD you might have lying around. Don't have one?
Well, then by all means pass these helpful tips on to some
mentally-impoverished Wintel user as he's beating his head against his
keyboard wondering why he puts up with it all.

That said, here are my top 10 uses for a Windows '98 CD.

10)  Everyone loves a Frizbee
{p} {p}
9) One word:  coaster
{p} {p}
8)  Replacement puck for Air Hockey
{p} {p}
7)  Place it flat against your forehead and, while humming your mantra,
try to become One with the OS. It may not make Windows run any better,
but after a few days of trying to install the darn thing you'll be
ready for anything.

6)  Target practice. That hole in the middle makes for a perfect
bullseye.

5)  Christmas Ornaments.
{p} {p}
4)  Put under than one short leg of your kitchen table to level it out.
{p} {p}
3)  Tile into a cement walkway (pavement for you brits) as non-skid
stepping stones.

2)  Wind Chimes

1)  Secretly install it on the computer system of a MAC user you hate.
