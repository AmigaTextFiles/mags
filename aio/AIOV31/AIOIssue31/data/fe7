Well, it's December once again and the good Doc has made a decision... I
will not do any more Wanderer columns for the remainder of this
millenium.
{p} {p}
Okay, so that's an obvious joke; but it's one you can only pull once
every thousand years so I'm getting them in while I can. That out of the
way, this issue being out on Xmas day if you're reading it then it
probably means you've either got nothing to do or aren't too fond of
Christmas (A bit too commercial lately). Well, maybe I've got the cure
for those Holiday BLues.
{p} {p}
So, just sit back, start browsing, and see you next millenium.

{p} {p}
An easy one to start you off with. A quick little test, with answers so
obvious it's almost not worth taking. Right?
{p} {p}
Yeah, right; and my hair is blue. Go ahead and take the test, then we'll
talk what easy is.

Everyone has their favorite movie or television star, their favorite
character from some past show. But fame is fleeting, and often times
yesteryear's star is today's unknown factory worker. Curious what ever
happened to that favorite star or celeb? Then read here for complete
updates on what they're up to now.

STILL don't know what you're doing for New Years? Will maybe this will
help. First check out all the new years events from around the world and
choose one to go to. After that you can log in your New Year's
resolution (maybe it'll help you keep it). There's a section where you
can read past predictions of our future by assorted famous people, but
it appears incomplete. A countdown clock is available but seems to be
the only one of the Net requiring Javascript support. Beyond that, it's
good for a few minutes diversion.

{p} {p}
Actually a site good for nearly every holiday and special event (I
didn't know there was a National Pumpkin Pie Day), it's another one of
those send-a-greeting-card type sites, but this one has a lot of images
to choose from, each themed for the chosen holiday, or you can give a
URL to your OWN image. Many of the images are animated, of quality and
styles just like off the shelf ones.
{p} {p}
You can also choose from a vast selection of music to have played with
the card, each selection specifically chosen for the holiday in question
(different lists available for Xmas versus Birthdays, for example), or
you can once again specify the URL of your own tune.
{p} {p}
The one complaint I'll make is that the Framed section on the front page
is is rather messily laid out (overlapping text), but beyond that, as
far as web-based greeting cards, I haven't yet seen any better.

Some of you like Christmas and all the crass commercialism bombarded
upon us from September through January, and some of you don't mind the
Xmas decorations going up before Holloween is even over with. Well, this
site is for the rest of us. For these reasons and more, the author of
this site has created an alternative for those that find this time of
year just a bit too depressing. With that in mind, here are some of what
you'll find there to cheer things up.
{p} {p}
First there's different versions of Christmas songs. Hillarious
renditions that are sure to bring you a chuckle or two. Their titles
alone should tell you something; the songs up when I check them out
were:
{p} {p}
    Satan Claws Is Coming To Slay You{p}
    Frosty The Dough Man{p}
    Whitey Christmas{p}
    Holly Jolly My Ass{p}
    Rudolph Flips Out
{p} {p}
Things to do during the Holidays is a humorous list of alternate holiday
activities (and as he notes for the common sense deprived, many are
ment only as jokes). From taking a knife to a Tickle Me Elmo doll, to
putting mistletoe up on men's public bathroom doors, or just hiating,
it's quite a list. My favorite is throwing a Not-Christmas party.
{p} {p}
Need a couple new Xmas recipies? How about a fruit Cake made with Trail
Mix and Twinkies? Or a Xmas main course involving corn flakes, Tofu, and
cranberry sauce. Something for everyone I'm sure.
{p} {p}
The submit a caption for the strange Elf picture is a good idea with a
minor flaw or two. First, the picture didn't load so I couldn't tell to
what was referred, and second the captions given were printed in a text
color that is completely unreadable with the page's background. Too bad.
{p} {p}
Want to leave some feedback? Then feel free and it might make it to the
page. Funny responces like "How to make fruit cake in a year" keep the
tone of this site going. Or you can write in for advice to  the demented
elf, Elfy Demento; so far only one letter posted but write in your own
problems and see what advice you get (notice I didn't say Useful
advice). finally, a short page of humorour links wraps things up.
{p} {p}
All in all, a fine site for those of us depressed by the holidays or
just too demented to care. Run through it after you've opened up your
presents.

Yes, as a Christmas present to you I've included a bonus site this
month. If you're a fan of bad movies, or just suffer from morbid
curiosity, then you couldn't do much better then to check out this site.
reviews of bad films, their own yearly lists of the worst films of that
year, and now a pole asking for nominations for the worst movies of all
time. Check out the lists and add in your own nominations while seeing
different opinions on what stank. You may not agree with all those
selected, but it's fun to read through nonetheless.
{p} {p}
Well, that's all for this century. See you next Millenium.
