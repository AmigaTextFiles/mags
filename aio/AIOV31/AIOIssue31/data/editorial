Merry Christmas.... oh... well it appears I am a bit late in saying
this. I must firstly appologise for the week delay in releasing this
issue and I will try my very best for this not to happen again. I
do have a good excuse, one that I would rather not beable to say, but
a few days before Christmas my DH0: decided to pack in and disappear,
so instead of getting into a Christmassy type mood I was spending time
reinstalling my workbench and setting up the cosmetics of it to how I
like.
{p} {p}
Not to worry, i'm nearly 100% back and managed to get this issue out
to you only a week late. Well today being the first day of the year
2000, I guess I should be wishing you a Happy New Year. Alot of you
are probably recovering from New Year drink related problems to put
it nicely, so sit down to your flickery monitor screen and read some
of the gems we have for you this issue.
{p} {p}
This time of year has been slightly quiet for the Amiga, since the
announcement a few months ago that Amiga MCC is no more we have just
continued like we always have. I am personally trying to resist the
temptations of Christmas food, drink and everything else to make me
twice the weight of myself currently that is available.
{p} {p}
We have still seen no snow in this part of England but i'm waiting in
hope for that. Not to worry, the TV has been filled with the same old
Christmas films (movies) to entertain myself and the family and they
even managed to put out some that I hadn't seen which made a change.
{p} {p}
As we turn on the radio we hear the same old 80's Christmas tunes and
it brings me to my always wondered topic of why people do not make
Christmas songs anymore meaning we are forced to listen to the same
old songs every year over and over again.
{p} {p}
Saying all, its a time to be merry, lots have just recently made the
decision to give up smoking, give up drinking, be a better person or
the thousands of other new years reseloutions that will no doubt be
broked in a week or two.
{p} {p}
And as we pass into this new millenium nothing seems to have changed,
we are all still here waiting for the new Amiga, we look back to the
good old days when the Amiga was the top computer with a tear in our
eyes and begin to realise that those days are just slipping further
and further into the land of "once was".
{p} {p}
Maybe by the next millenium Gateway will have taken there finger out
and done something, who knows what lies ahead but personally I see
the same old straight road... not to worry, Bill Gates is still rich,
the world is full of war and poverty, put a smile on your face and
forget all, its the new year after all?
{p} {p}
Two quick things to mention. Don't forget to enter our Christmas
competition and remember to enclose your AIO registration with it
because if you don't and your not already registered then you
will not be entered.

Secondly we are testing a new font this month for people with bigger
screen modes to hopefully make it easier for them to read. If you
think this new font is an improvement or you like the old one better
or you have any other comments about the font or the magazine on
a whole then please email them to,
