Well, as the clock winds down, we realize that we are not going to meet the
deadline for the Amiga PPC release of FUSION.  There are numerous reasons,
with the most significant reason being that we have received only a small
portion of the funds from the 500 that were require to pre-order.  We were
to use this money for hiring outside sources for writing portions of the
code, which we have now been doing ourselves. This whole thing upsets us
very much, as if we had known that the pre-payments were never going to
arrive, we would have spent the time on the PC version and have it available
already (we will always re-coup expenses in the PC market).  We are
disappointed that less than 1/4 of the people who pledged to pre-pay have not.
Because of this, we have only a few choices:
{p} {p}
1. Completely abandon the project and refund the money to those individuals
who did pre-pay.{p}
2. Continue the project with our normal staff and have the emulation available
by Christmas, only to those who pre-paid (no sales to those who did not
pre-pay... and use a hardware based dongle to eliminate piracy).{p}
3. Continue the project with our normal staff, and raise the price of the
emulation now to $299.95.{p}
4. Please with the public to pay if you pledged to pre-pay and hope that the
money comes in so that we can send out some of the work to expidite the
process.
{p} {p}
We don't know what to do.  We have a ton of work done, and we don't really
want to toss it away.  Any suggestions?

I have just had a long talk with Jim Drew regarding recent posts concerning
Fusion PPC for the Amiga.
{p} {p}
The situation was discussed along with possible options and the following
information should make matters a little more clear:
{p} {p}
1. As already stated, Fusion PPC Amiga will not be released on the 20th
   November as initially planned.{p}
2. Fusion PPC Amiga development will continue as normal.{p}
3. Jim has explained that a great deal of progress has already been made,
   and that the project will be completed and every effort will be made
   to meet a pre-Christmas release.{p}
4. As was part of the pre-payment agreement, any customer that wishes to
   have a refund must make that request in writing to Microcode-Solutions
   and a refund will be made within 30 days of receipt of that request. This
   was clearly explained on the Web pages prior to accessing the online
   ordering.
{p} {p}
I would like to urge everyone to show a little more patience until Fusion
PPC Amiga is released.   Both Jim and Joe are striving to deliver what will
be an excellent package for Power-PC equipped Amiga's and the wait will be
well worth it.
