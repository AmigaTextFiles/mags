A FINE program that I really want to bring to all Amigans over X-Mas! ;)
{p} {p}
First of all, I would REALLY like to say "Thank You" to the author, why you think?
{p} {p}
I sent a E-Mail to him at Dec 5th 16:02, then at Dec 5th 22:39 I had an answer from
him... His answer (and my original mail):

OK. I've just uploaded a version to my website and Aminet. If there's any
bugs or you want something adding, email me, and I'll see what I can do.{p}

Is that nice service or what??{p}
What do you think would happen if I mailed a WinAMP plugin author and asked this? ;)
See, the Amiga community is like a huge family (though I wished it was even bigger).

Before you read any more, make sure that you have read the Review of X-MasLights
before you continue, because this program is a program to make the old and nice
program X-MasLights obsolete...
{p} {p}
So, this has exactly all the features that X-MasLights do, but it is alot better
in it's ways, it doesn't have the limitation that it needs atleast a 32 colour WB,
it doesn't give an CyberGuard hit everytime a lamp flashes and it's supposedly
working on GFX cards too...
