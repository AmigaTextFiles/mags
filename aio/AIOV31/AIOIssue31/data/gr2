Kill Em All is described in the readme file as, "A fast 1/2 player
platform shoot em up. Similar to Alien3 game".
{p} {p}
The description given by the author is spot on. You control the main
player who basically has to go around shooting aliens that look
very similar to the ones found in 2D aleins games and also the films
of the same name. The game is actually quite good and the graphics
aren't half bad either.

The description does say that it is a "fast" game which I'm not really
sure I totally agree with. The game moves at a face pace but in order
to achieve this the graphics seem to jump alot like they have very
few frames in their animation.
{p} {p}
The basic game is a platform game which many years ago we may have all
avoided due to the mass of platform games around. These days we are
getting less and less games and so a newly released platform game
was something of a treat for me.
{p} {p}
Although we do not have many platform games these days, I do not just
like this one for that fact, its actually a pretty good game when you
get to play it. Overall the if a little more time was spent on the
animation of the graphics and some loose ends tied up then this could
be a real gem of a game.
{p} {p}
If you like platform games or your just looking for a good blast then
take a look at this, it'll be well worth your while. As said earlier,
a little more work on this game could make it go a long way. I've
seen commercial games not up to this standard.
