A marvellous thing, which could save the Amiga as we know it, is PowerOS.
It's an Amiga compatible operating system written for the Power Amiga,
looks like AmigaOS, runs 68k Amiga programs, behaves like AmigaOS, but
looks to be what we all wanted AmigaOS 4 to be when Escom took over all
those years ago.  I believe this could be the next big thing, but we'll see
when it gets here.
