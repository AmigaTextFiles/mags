Have you ever watched a movie where you see a stockmarket? There you will probably
also see alot of clocks, which only one is correctly set, or? Well, the others are
for other places around the world... This is just what ClockCal is for! And some
more.

ClockCal shows four different clocks and a calender in the main window, you can
then set what timezones those clocks should represent, and also type some text
to explain it for you. Not so amazing really.. But it also has a calender, and this
is quite neat. You can add different texts to different days (like a reminder), and
make it annual if you want... So why not add all the birthdays of all the people
you know, they will be surprised that you remembered it :-)

You can also hide either the clock or the calender...

You can also set what colours everything should be, but that means that you'll have
to edit a textfile for that.. There is other settings in those files too to set...

The documentation is extrordinary, it's very well written and there won't be one
thing you don't know after reading it (okay, you won't know who killed JFK, but
that wouldn't be any fun...)
