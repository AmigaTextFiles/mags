The Day is finally nearing!{pp}
Amiga has promised big announcements the last week of this month;
unfortunately just a bit too late for this issuem but that doesn't mean
we can't still look forward to it.  What will they say?  What is it
they've been up to all this time?  What is your favorite color?
{pp}
Sorry; Python flashback.  Anyway, despite the ominous auspicious aspect
of having the announcement on April Fool's Day weekend, this looks to be
a landmark occasion.  So much so, that when the big announcement comes,
we'll pass it along to our {italic}registered{noitalic} AIO readers in a
special bulletin that very weekend.  We'll keep our ear to the ground
and you the Reader informed.
{pp}
If all goes well, our {bold}{italic}long{noitalic}{nobold} patience may
soon be rewarded.
