On making GIFs for web pages, if you want to make them viewable on all
browsers then after you're finished put it through something like
ArtPRO and perform a PackColors then save again.

When designing a web page, always specify both the background color
and the text color.  I've run into a couple of pages that had the
background specified as Black and left the text color to one's
default.  well, since most everyone in this world has their text color
set to a default of black, the page was invisible until I changed by
browser settings again.  So be careful on how your page is set up.

For all config and prefs type files, anywhere you'd have a path for a
program or something, use logical names for all devices- SystemDisk:
as opposed to DH0: for example.  This makes it easier if, for
instance, you change hard drives or do some partition shuffling later
on.
