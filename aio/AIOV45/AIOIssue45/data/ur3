{subhead}HyperCom3+ I/O Board{def}{p}
Review by Mark Tierno

Parallel port on your Amiga 4000 goes bust and what do you do?  Either
pay ythe 400 USD and wait 4-6 weeks for your repaired motherboard to
come back, or get a cheap I/O board to patch in.  The HyperCom series of
I/O boards are just one such product, as my need for them one such
example of a busted Parallel port.
{pp}
The HyperComm3+ is a cheap board... in every sense of the word.  The
Hardware installation wasn't too difficult, though as I don't rread
German a call to my local Tech SUpport was in order. The software
install was a bit less friendly; one main install script then it's up to
you to figure out which other 1 or 2 included extras you should install
as well, each with their own Install and each such a critical part of
what you need you wonder why the main Install just didn't make a call to
them.
{pp}
Okay, so it's installed and hooked up and time to test it out.  Serial
ports work fine, though I've heard a report on an earlier model HyperCom
card that kept having problems with the serial wquitting after a while.
It didn't quit on me, at least not through a couple hours on Aminet.
{pp}
Now it's tesatoing the printer on the parallel port, after all that's
what I got this card for in the first place.  Hooked up, turn on the
printer, watch it begin it's standard initialization process, and...
{pp}
Then hang there in a continual wait before it's even finished
initializing. Hmm.  Well, check all connectors, cabling, software,
and...  Still nothing.  Okay then, check printer; turn off the Ami and
disconnect the printer and the printer works fine.  Hook up printer but
leave Ami off and prinetr wasiting (as one would expect at this point.
Turn Ccomputer back on and nothing..  >Time to call Tech Support.
{pp}
Long story short here; Tech Suppoort Guy stumped, catrd goes back, new
one sent out, try everything all over again.  End result?
{pp}
Wash, rinse, repeat.  Try and hook up a {italic}different{noitalic} printer (one new and
fresh out of the store) and same result.  At this point I'm ready to
turn the card into a clay pigeon and borrow someone's shotgun.
Frustrating isn't the word.  I even tried hooking the parallel cable up
in reverse (reversing where that red wire goes to) and still nothing.
{pp}Okay, research time.  A quick and thorough search on Aminet popped
up one guy with the same problem on another HyperCom card; one email
later and it turns out he'd solved his problem by reversinbg the
parallel hookup; apparently Hypercom wired it up backwards.
{pp}
Of course, I'd already tried that. Sigh.
{pp}
Then I'm reading on the Net about another card that supports uni and bi
directional parallel port data flow.  Hold it!  Someone
{italic}uses{noitalic} uni-directional parallel?  Isn't that called
Serial?  Okay, revelation time.  Me thinks the HyperCom3+ put in a
uni-directional parallel port which makes it completely useless with
every printer ever make.  Time to trade it in for a new card from a
{bold}different{nobold} manufacturer.
{pp}
If because it has the wrong type of port, or is wired up backwards, I
would say that HyperCom has a quality control problem.  This board seems
to be marketed along the lines of "We're a great serial board..., and oh by the weay,
we just happened to throw in a parallel port just for the heck of it".
Two good serial ports and one completely useless  parallel port.  Not
what I wanted.
{pp}
But, on the brighter side, I'll let you know how my new IOBlix does.
