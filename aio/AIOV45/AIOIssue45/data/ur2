This is a reminder type of program, I've been looking around for a
good one for quite some time, well... I've actually seen earlier
versions of this one before, but never got around to actually trying
it. Installing it is easy, using the installer script- allthough,
installer-hostile people can get it installed anyway as the manual
describes this part adequately (I assume). The manual, being made in
the traditional AmigaGuide way, which most people should be familiar
with, holds no questionmarks any other weird things that could
confuse you. Some degree of humour doesn't really make it any boring
to read either (it's a good way for make people like me, who normally
look for the "quickstart" link in any guide, to keep on reading).
It's not too long either, describing both the program itself, and the
prefs program's functions. There is also an un-install option (which
only works if you use the default paths for the install, though).

Even though the guide describes how to use it good enough, it's
really simple to figure out how to do it yourself, and it works like
a charm too. There are also a nifty little thing called temporary
reminds, which you can use if you only need to get reminded of
something once or in one day, etc.

DRemind is small and very efficient, so there's no need to worry that
your WB will take several minutes more to start up, however, should
that be the case, you can always launch it manually when you want to
yourself. I decided to play it safe, though, as I don't really trust
my memory enough to remember launching it by myself.

This program is simply excellent, I have no idea how I could have
lived without it. Normally I always find something to complain about,
but I didn't manage to do that this time. There were some bugs
described, but none of those came to bother me during the time I
tested it, and I haven't seen them after I did it either.
