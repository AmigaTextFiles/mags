Things are really slow on the Aminet these days, so, I looked a
little for the older jewels located there. I didn't really find any
of interest, so, I just snagged this one and decided to take a look
at it (at this time of night even pressing the eject button on the
CD-Rom by yourself is hard ;).

It didn't work, though. But it doesn't really matter, the manual is
very funny, so it's worth downloading for that alone. And I'm sure
there are other programs out there that will do the job, it might be
a good idea to get such an application if you're an old school A1200
user with all external devices lying on top of the computer, for
instance. I'll have to look further into that thing sometime. Anyway,
the sourcecode is included in the archive, so if you're really
desperate of making it work, I suppose it's possible if you're
willing to look alittle more closely into it.
