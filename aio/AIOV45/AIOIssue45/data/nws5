{subhead} OpenDivX on Amiga{def}
{left}
{pp}
 Steffen Haeuser has been working diligently in the past several  weeks
 on  his  own  private  time and as a personal project to bring you the
 Amiga version of OpenDivX library. Laszlo Torok  also  spent  a  great
 deal  of  time  to  provide you with a special and free version of his
 MooVId player for playback of OpenDivX files.
{pp}
 This is a standard library that  can  play  and  encode  content  into
 OpenDivX  on  Amiga.  The  hope is that many programs will support it.
 Currently there is no Sound Support (will come)
