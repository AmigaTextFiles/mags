Well, the clouds are parting and Spring seems to be getting near (you
Ausies can just substitute Fall for every mention of the word Spring,
and Colder for every mention of Hotter), so with it some lighter web
sites.  No real brain-strainers here, just something to pass those
too-slowly warming nights as you wait for the rains to go away, the snow
to thaw, and your girlfriend to change outof those winter-woolies and
back into something lighter.

{bold}Vintage Computer Adds{nobold}{p}

Taken straight from the pages of old issues of Omni (apparently I'm not
the only one that has every single issue), you can see old computer adds
for everything from William Shatner pitching the Vic20, to the
classically bad TRS-80.  So, hark back to a time of tape cassette loaded
programs, five and a quarter inch disks, and four-color screens.  A
blast from the bast worth checking out.

What started out as an annual final project for some class at Cal Tech
is now a regular televised event.  This page will let you see the
robotic contenders, vheck out the rules for entering your own creations,
and even tell you when and where the next competition will be. They
aren't exactly Cylons, but the last bot standing wins.

A rather humerous "If computers/operatiung systems were..."
compilation, divided up into different list categories.  From if
computers/OSs were cars, beer, or chickens, to how one would shoot
one's self in the foot using varyious programming languages, from CPM
and Atari to Amiga's and Wintel, this site is good for a few quick
laughs even if a few of the references are na bit dated.

Those who have been keeping hteir ears to the ground know that the
movie version of the complete Lord of the Rings trilogy has been
filing for the last several months.  Well, here's the official site
where you can keep up to date on official news, get some clips, and
see a few teasers.  This URL is for the non-Flash version, which seems
a bit more navigatable then the Flash pages under Voyager's Flash
plugin and my 56K modem.  So, all you Tolkien fans keep up to date by
bookmarking this site.

{bold}The Bad Movie Review Site{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://www.badmovies.org/{noitalic}{p}
As the site itself says, "A website to the detriment of good film". 
Not just another site devoted to reviewing bad movies we all hate to
love, but one with a humorous tongue-in-cheek slant that's more fun
than the films reviewed.  Almost makes you want to see some of the
turkeys mentioned.

The alphabetized list of the reviews is large enough to prove the
complete lack of a life this guy must have, but are each humorously
presented.  Characters are listed, the basic premise, the plot, then
his pithy summary of highlights and opinion on what makes the film so
bad (or good, depending on one's outlook).  He'll even poinyt out what
you can learn from this film (like brains are spoon food). He then rates it on a scale
that goes from four drops (a good kind of bad) down to one skull (stay
away like it's a plague).
{pp}
Round it out with an occasional interview, news on when some of these
"classics" are being shown on television (cable), and a bulletin board
where you can post your own opinions or reviews, and it's a site
that'll keep you ROTFL.  Check it out; I'm going back to see if he's
added Event Horizon yet (that movie gives me a headache).
