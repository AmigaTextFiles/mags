 dynAMIte is a freeware bomberman/dynablaster-clone that can be  played
 (only)  over  internet (TCP/IP) by up to 8 players! Servers can be set
 up very easily and the game is extremely addictive. For  a  sure  fire
 way  of making time disappear and blow your mates up at the same time,
 download and enjoy!
