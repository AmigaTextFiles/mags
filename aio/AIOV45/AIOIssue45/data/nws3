 As far as Zorro compatibility is concerned the layout of the  A1  main
 board  is extremely critical because of the high speed of the bus etc.
 This causes a real problem in trying to route  the  200  signal  lines
 from  the  A4000's  CPU  slot  to  the  Westbridge interface VLGA chip
 through the A4000's  Zorro  riser  and  potential  Toaster  compatible
 Zorro3/video  slot  (which uses a through hole connector and therefore
 uses space on all pcb layers). We're still looking to see if this  can
 be  solved  reliably,  and thats one of the reasons that the (simpler)
 AmigaOne 1200 is coming out first.

 If it can be done however it will add significantly to the cost of the
 AmigaOne-4000   because  of  extra  PCB  real  estate  and  additional
 production costs."

 Eyetech has gotten over 300  applications  from  beta-tester  wannabes.
 There   are   currently  more  drivers  being  implemented  than  they
 originally  envisioned  so  they  will  not  be  emailing  beta   test
 applicants  until  these  have  been capped off, as its only then that
 they can select the best user profiles for testing.  They  also  thank
 you for your patience.

 Alan  Redhouse,  Eyetech  CEO: "Because of Amiga Inc's 'St louis' news
 embargo we cannot ship boards to beta testers until after  that  date.
 That  (obviously)  means that the board will not be on general release
 in 1Q01 (which ends at the  show).  Our  best  estimate  is  that  the
 AmigaOne1200  will be with dealers around the middle of 2Q01 - ie late
 May. That is what I said at Alt-WoA."
