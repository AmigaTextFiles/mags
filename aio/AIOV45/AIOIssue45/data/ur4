{subhead}IOBlix Multi I/O Interface Card{def}{p}
Review by Mark Tierno

Okay, you've read my opinion on the HyperCom, now for the competition.
 In comparison, the IOBlix is smooth as silk, an all-around
thoroughbread that does what you paid for it to do (Can we see which
way this review is going to go?)
{pp}
Installation is a breeze.  Just pop in the card and it's assorted
ports, then turn on the computer and run the Install software.  The
Install does everything you need, starting from sensing which card
you have so it can react accordingly, then installing the needed DOs
Drivers into Storage.  All you have to do is pull the new SER and PAR
DosDrivers out of storage and pout them into DEVS:DOSDrivers and
you're done.  It actually worked first time.
{pp}
There's even one extra little goody.  A config line to put in your
NSDpatch.cfg file so that all calls to the built-in Amiga PAR: device
get redirected to the parallel port on your IOBlix!  And it works
(don't forget to change the unit number to the one on your card you've
hooked up to), I tried it.  Now some of those older brain-dead pieces
of software that have PAR: hard-coaded into them will work on this
card (like my old 8-bit audio digitizer, for instance).
{pp}
Have a doubt if the board is at fault in some problem?  Just run the
included Test_Board program to remove all doubt.  Just another little
included goody.
{pp}
The serial ports are fast, and the parallel port supports every
parallel protocal known to Man.  There's four serials and room for two
parallels, though you'd have to send away for the second one (no
problem, I just needed it for my printer anyway).  Even setting the
serial port to the same speed as I had my Amiga one set to, the IOBlix
serial port seemed to perform better with my modem (and here I was
blaming my provider... well, okay, so they're still partially at fault).
Future expansion modules are promised to be ethernet and audio cards.
{pp}
More expensive then the HyperCom, but definitely worth it if you want
a {italic}working{noitalic} solution.  Got parallel port problems?  I
can't think of a better solution then the IOBlix.

{bold}Available from{nobold}: Check your local dealer for the IOBlix by RBM
{pp}
{bold}Overall{nobold}: 95% (would RBM mind making a scaled down version with just 1 parallel and 2 serials?){p}
