 Michal  Bergseth  (  Amigaworld  )  received  an  e-mail  reply   from
 AntiGravity explaining why they haven't been heard from for awhile.

 We  have  had  a  delay,  but  the  delay  is over as of today. We had
 expected to have this version of the prototype made the first week  of
 December.  Today  this current design has been placed in for build up.
 In 4 weeks we may have something to show. This does not mean  that  we
 are  going into production. We have only stated that we where going to
 show the BoXeR to AmigActive at the end of December. I agree that this
 is  not fun. The BoXeR has been plagued with delays. I do believe that
 we will be able to start to demonstrate in one or two months. At  that
 time  we  will  announce  our  plans  for the future. We will start to
 market, take orders, set up dealers and distributors, and then finally
 manufacture.
