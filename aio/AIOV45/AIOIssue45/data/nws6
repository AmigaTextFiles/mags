 "Amiga will  make  an  official  announcement  at  St  Louis  and  the
 arguments, incompatibilities and squabbles of the last five years will
 go way. Amiga is back in charge and there is only one way  forwards  -
 the Amiga way. I know it is frustrating but please bear with us.
{pp}
 You will all be very happy."
