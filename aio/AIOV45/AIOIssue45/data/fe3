{subhead}ATX PSU Software Powerdown - Progress report{def}{p}

Again I have failed to come up with a design that I'm completely happy with. Essentially, this
design is what I want, but it is getting more expensive and now involves a double sided circuit
board.
{pp}
Major changes since the first schematic:
{pp}
* Dip switches to change trigger code{p}
* PS_ON is handled as a normal TTL logic input. I.E. +5v turns off PSU, 0v turns it on. See
'Simple ATX' for more.{p}
* Pin header for +5v SB, 0v, PS_ON{p}
* Pin header for ON and OFF SPST buttons{p}
* pin header for 2x 26 pin IDC cables; printer port in and out{p}
* Diodes on in a few places to stop conflicting computer generated off/button power outputs.{p}
* Re-done with EAGLE PCB Autorouter/layout editor from CadSoft (http://www.cadsoft.com){p}
* Plus other stuff I can't remember.
{pp}
Next issue I should have this built (hopefully) with a complete parts list and hopefully a single
sided PCB version for you, and the C code to control it.

The Schematic is found in the root directory of this issue of AIO under
the name "ATX_schematic.128.iff" and not inlined here due to size.
Please refer to it now (I'll wait).
