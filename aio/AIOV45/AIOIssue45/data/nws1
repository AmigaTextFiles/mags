{pp}
 The first ever Amiga Show to be held in the North of England was  held
 at  the  Old  Cornmill  in Huddersfield on the 24th February 2001. The
 show was hailed as a success and attended by almost  500  Amiga  Users
 from all points of the UK and in some cases further still.

 Fleecy  Moss was in there and together with Alan Redhouse from Eyetech
 he gave a presentation on the soon to be released AmigaONE Board.

 Fleecy was kind enough to write a personal review of  the  show  which
 can  be found at the show site. There are also ten galleries of images
 taken on the day in the images section.

 There's also an online free to enter draw for a copy of Heretic II
