This is a module player, supporting the "usual" formats, MED, MOD,
DBM (Digibooster), etc. It's quite plain, nothing really fancy- but,
this is according to the programmer, the idea of the program, and it
doesn't really matter to me, so I'm ok with that. Copying a few libs
and it should work, all libraries are supplied in the archive so
there's no need to hunt any extra down. It has a little graphic
equalizer, but this didn't really work well with Protracker modules,
and it didn't work with the Digibooster modules I tried playing,
hmms... proper AHI support would have been nice for this, as well as
for the entire program. It's quite usable, still, should be fast for
those without some cream in their computers.

The future for it looks like it could be good, though, so I think
I'll stick around until later versions appear and see if it has
become any better.
