First off, this isn't a program of its own, but something more like a
front for an MPEG viewer called Amipeg, this came as a little
disappointment as I had expected it to be an entirely new viewer,
however this makes it possible to use Amipeg with sound, using MPEGA
- plus, there's supposed to be faster than the original Amipeg
because of some other external (included) program called BlazeWCP, I
could however not see any improvement of the speed... however,
keeping in mind it was quite some time ago I used Amipeg to begin
with I might be- and most likely is, wrong.

There are two different "versions" of VideoMPEGA, one for CGFX and
one for plain AGA. I first tried to use the CGFX version, and it
worked fine... until the MPEG file ended, then the computer crashed.
If this is something caused by the system, or Amipeg/VideoMPEGA
itself is something I'll leave open for discussion.

I moved on to trying the AGA version instead and found out the exact
same thing happened there, two different systems, same crashes. Hmm,
unfortunately I can't be very benign in my rating, but the idea is a
good one, and the sound does work.
