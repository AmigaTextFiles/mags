@{fg shine} Amiga int. licence motherboards@{fg text}

 Hampshire, England, July 1st, 1997- Following on from AMIGA International's
 recent announcements about an open licensing policy for the Amiga, an
 agreement has been reach which licenses Amiga developer Index Information
 Ltd to manufacture and distribute its own range of Amiga motherboards and

 and market knowledge of companies such as Index will allow the Amiga to be
 used in a wider range of applications, broadening the market for software
 developers and integrators.", said Petro Tyschyschenko, President of AMIGA

  Mick Tinker, Managing Director of Index Information Ltd; "We believe that
 the Amiga is superior to any other computer product for a range of
 applications, particularly in multimedia and applications that require

 requirements combined with high performance, enabling the computer to
 substantially undercut competitive systems on cost, performance or both.
 The technology has the potential to be substantially miniaturised and
 cost-reduced to fulfil a wide range of new current and future
 applications."

  "We aim to satisfy the growing need for economical multimedia computer
 devices targeted to fulfil diverse and unique needs, while delivering the
 ease of use, performance and cost savings that have only been promised by
 competitive platforms."

  "By focusing on the key advantages of the Amiga technology we can ensure
 that the customer receives the best solution at the best price.  Our
 products high performance at low cost gives us significant advantages over
 our competitors and we must use this to ensure that we supply the volume
 demand in current and new markets."

@{fg shine} Megalgen@{fg text}

           Workbench games are my favourite game because they allow you to multitask
 and when you quit you don't have to reset your computer. This game on the other
 hand is totally rubbish. The game is based around hangman but not as good, the
 thing that makes this game rubbish is the words are taken from a data list and not
 typed in by player two so the words are pre-set. This game is not much use either
 if you can't read german because it's all in german and the words are in german.
 Overall i'd tell you to completly give this game a miss.

@{fg shine} SpeedRacerFX@{fg text}

           SpeedRacerFX is based a bit around an old C64/Amiga game called Trailblazer,
 this involved speeding along as a ball object jumping over/avoiding blocks and
 running over the turbo squares. The difference with SpeedRacer is there is no ball
 it is just a screen that moves along at a fast pace. Although the levels are made up
 of blocks and not carefully drawn graphics you are not really bothered because the
 game moves as such a good speed your more concentrating on dodging the next block. As 
 with Trailblazer you can collect turbo squares which ofcource speed you up for a certain
 amount of time. Another added bonus is there is a level editor to play around with
 just incase you get bored with the 25 odd levels supplyed. The only one problem I
 found was that the computer was just to good, but in two player mode this game is
 excelent and well worth a download.

           Spodrace is an overhead destruction derby game. You have one car and
 you go around bashing into the other players to make there energy go down until
 they explode and bounce out the screen. This game is 1.1Mb in size but don't
 think you get your moneys worth because your not, the graphics are awful and so
 is the gameplay. The only good thing is the music, I deleted the whole game and
 just kept the music to listen to when i'm bored because the rest of the game is
 not worth keeping and definatly not at 1.1Mb. I was lucky I downloaded this when
 the long distance calls where 1pee a minute. I suggest everyone avoids this.

           High Noon is an exact copy of the C64 version, the graphics, sound
 and gameplay are, so i'm told exactly the same as the orginal. This game is 
 quite good even though it is of C64 quality, the best thing about it is it
 makes you want to keep playing, although every level is the same the further
 you progress the harder the baddies get so the more chanllenge there is. As
 I havn't seen the orginal I can't tell you how it compares but it's a good
 little game anyway.

@{fg shine} ALMAGICA - Scions of a Forgotten World@{fg text}

           This game is only in it's early stages so therefore this is not a review but
 a preview. The full game is to be released near the end of '97 and it looks to be a
 great game. The game is based around Dune & Settlers where you have a bunch of men at
 your disposal. Each person has there own job ie. farmer or fighter. The idea is to
 defeat the other enemy villages to go onto the next level. This isn't as easy as it
 seems because you have to build Blacksmiths, Wells, Inns and other various buildings
 to keep you alive and to make more soldiers and farmers. Aswell as the fighting aspect
 of the game you also have to get your farmers to harvest the gold mines and forests to
 get wood and money to build up your village. The enemys aren't exactly hard to defeat but
 you normally need two of your soldiers to defeat one of theres. As you progress you
 will find more people at your disposal with people like Archers and Scouts becoming
 avalible. This game is only in its very early stages but if the full game is like
 this I for one will be buying it.

@node "tiny" "TinyPlay"

@{fg shine} TinyPlay@{fg text}

           TinyPlay is a very small music player. There isn't much else to say
 about it except it is small so it can fit somewhere with only a few 'k' left.
 The one major problem with TinyPlay is as soon as you've started your music
 and you click on anything at all the music instanly stops and you are taken
 back to the music selction window. So you can play your music but do nothing
 else while playing it. Overall TinyPlay is alright but the problem is you can't
 do anything else while playing the music.

@{fg shine} WindowBar@{fg text}

           If you've ever seen a PC with the start menu you'll know what this
 program is like stright away. Winbar is a little program that sits at the bottom
 of your screen with all your files ready to be selected. This is a very useful
 program and is easy to set up but there are some faults in it which really let
 it down. First of all the shutdown doesn't work and just makes your computer
 lock up, so once you've run Winbar you can't quit it. The next problem is you
 can't get out of the section of the menu without clicking on the WB, this isn't
 a major problem but it does become anoying after a while. Winbar is a very nice,
 useful program but you'll have to put up with the bugs to use it.

@node "pop" "Popper"

@{fg shine} Popper@{fg text}

           Popper as you may guess is a pop up menu and at last it is one that
 works properly. The idea around popper is insted of going to the top of the 
 screen to get to the menu you just press the RMB anywhere on the screen and
 a tidy menu will appear right under the pointer. The only problem I found with
 Popper is there are no prefs so you can't change the colour of the menu and on
 my WB the background colour of the menu was a horrible brown, don't let that put
 you off though as Popper saves that little bit extra time and it's easy to use.
 Once you have run Popper every menu on every screen is changed so it is not just
 limited to the Workbench screen. This is a great little program that improves the
 Workbench that bit more.

@node "gb" "Gameboy Emu Vs GameBoy Emu"

@{fg shine} Gameboy emulators put to the test@{fg text}

           Although the Amiga is the best computer in the world sometimes we like to
 emulate other formats for whatever reason. The Gameboy is a good platform to emulate
 as most of the games on the Gameboy are not avalible for the Amiga. We have got two
 of the best known Gameboy emulators for the Amiga and 'put them to the test'.

           First off is @{b}WzonkaladV0.68@{ub}. When you load Wzonkalad up you are
 presented with a nice looking screen with separate windows with different option
 to do different things. Wzonkalad is easy enough to use and isn't to complicated, you
 load in your cartridge and press play. Although Woznkalad looks nice with the Gameboy
 game in a WB window it is very slow on an A1200, 6Mb ram. To get Wzonkalad going at
 a fast pace you would probably have to have a fast processor although I havn't tryed
 that out. Wzonkalad looks nice and has a lot of features but the speed of the games
 are unplayable on my computer.

           Next we tryed @{b}AmiGameBoyV0.85@{ub}. AmiGameBoy is alot better, the layout is
 more clearer and the options are easyly spotted. The only major problem I had with the
 AmiGameBoy is that Mario2 didn't work were as on Wzonkalad it worked fine. AmiGameBoy
 is undoubtaly the best of the two Gameboy emulators as the speed is just fantastic,
 although you lose out on the games being in a WB window you gain on the size of the
 screen and most importantly the speed. AmiGameBoy does not emulate the games as fast
 as a real Gameboy but they are fast enough to play and thats what matters.

 @{b}Wzonkalad V0.68@{ub}                               @{b}AmiGameBoy V0.85@{ub}

 Presentation : 88%                            Presentation : 86%
 Ease of use  : 87%                            Ease of use  : 89%
 Speed        : 72%                            Speed        : 91%

 Overall      : 84%                            Overall      : 89%

 The overall winner is : @{b}AmiGameBoy@{ub}

@{fg shine} Wzonkalad Tutorial@{fg text}

 Part 1 : The basics (Issue 3 - This issue)
 Part 2 : Getting the hang of things (Issue 4)

 @{b}Part 1 :@{ub}

           Upon loading WzonkaLad you will be presented with a requester to ask
 you what screenmode you want WzonkaLad in. It is best to go for High-Res or whatever
 your WB screen is in. Once you have past that quit the 'About' window that appears
 and you will find yourself at the main menu. The top window named 'Wzonka-Lad' is
 the game screen where most games will be displayed in, the middle window is the
 options and the bottom window is the cartridge information. There isn't anything
 to change on the top window except where it is placed. Next we come to the options
 window named 'Menu' you will notice 9 buttons in the window. When you load up
 Wzonkalad you will notice that only four buttons are usable and the others are
 'fuzzed' out. The other options will appear once you have choosen a cartridge, below
 is a detailed description of what each button entails.

 (from left to right)

 /\\
 --      =  Reset the emulator, and restart the loaded cartridge

 >>>     =  Load a cartridge

 >       =  Play the current loaded cartridge

 ||      =  Stop the current cartridge

  _
 | |     =  Open/Close Cartridge Information window
   .
   #
  _
 | |     =  Open/Close About window
   |
   .

  P      =  Open Preferences window


 ||
 \\/      =  Save a GBS snapshot (Save game)
 ##
 ##

 /\\
 ||      =  Load a GBS snapshot (Load game)
 ##
 ##

 And last is the 'Cartridge Information' window. The options are listed below.

 Name  :  -  Tells you the name of the cartridge

 Rom   :  -  Tells you how much rom to game uses

 Ram   :  -  Tells you how much ram to game uses

 MFRER :  -  Company who produced the cartridge name.

 @{b}NEXT MONTH@{ub} - We'll look at the preferences and all the advanced options.
