  Welcome back for another month of the latest news, reviews and articles.
It's been another on and off month for the amiga in general, but something
we've all come to expect now with release dates put back and us being
unsure about general bits. One bit of good news for most UK readers is
that the World of Amiga show is taking place again this year. Other
features are the latest games release list, a huge article from Vulcan
about Genetic Species and an interview with Austex software, makers of
Uropa 2.

  In the letters section we've had a letter from an angry Mexican reader
about the Vulcan situation. Theres also a pile more games reviews from
our new games editor and all the usual utils reviews.

  Make sure you join us next issue as it's going to be BIG, this issue
is the biggest issue we've done so far with 150k actual mag which doesn't
enclude pictures, music etc. Expect the biggest and BEST issue next month,
well until then i wish you all well!

                       What The Amiga Was Made For!


Development on Geneitic Species is in full steam and around the clock,
even though we have experienced some delays in it`s release date we are
confident that this awesome 3 year project will be ready towards the end
of April 98 with a full promotional release at the World of Amiga
(London) in May 98.

Pre-orders are recommended and further details can be found at the
Vulcan website www.vulcan.co.uk with on-line ordering facilities and our
world wide stockists list.

To fuel the excitiement and build up of this title we have released the
following extensive information pack to clarify exactly what Genetic
Species Offers. Enjoy!


FOREWORD
                                                                             
Genetic Species offers furiously invigorating and thrilling 3D action
with texture mapping speeds never before seen on any Amiga entertainment
title!

With Atmosphere, Gameplay, Addictiveness and Presentation as its highest
priorities you will experience the ultimate escapism in a violent and
puzzling 3D world coupled with the most awesome environmental effects
and imagery which are all proudly displayed in 256 colours at an
incredible (1x1) Pixel Resolution using the most sophisticated Texture
Mapping Engine to date.

In its simplest form Genetic Species requires an AGA Amiga with an 020
CPU, a minimum of 2mb Chip and 8Mb Fast Memory, a Hard Drive and a 2 x
Speed CDRom Drive. With more Fast Memory and a Faster CPU you will soon
discover that Genetic Species excels in visual presentation and by
choosing the appropriate window size, you will be spoiled by blindingly
fast action. Pushing the quality further, if you have a CyberGfx or
Picasso96 Graphics Card then you will soon realise what the Amiga was
made for! Graphics card users require only 0.5Mb of Chip Memory and a
minimum of 8mb Fast Memory.

                                                                             
The first thing you will see is an awesome 200Mb 3D rendered intro
animation that sets the scene and atmosphere for the experience that
follows, in order to get the best out of the intro animation a 4 x Speed
CDRom is recommended.

Once into the game you are bombarded with a Visual & Audio splendour
that is matched only by the speed, response time and gameplay. Genetic
Species has been written in 100% assembly and for the last 3 years has
seen many talented individuals eat, sweat and sleep nothing else to
bring you the ultimate 3D experience, so venture forth over the many
Huge Levels and frightening locations, all of which Demand a High
Element of Genetic Warfare and Logic Plot Based Puzzle Solving. 

Not only will you have a horrific weapon array (for mass murder) at your
disposal but you will also be equipped with the latest `In-Built
Portable Probe Device` were you will be able to `Psyche` Travel through
your Environment and even engage in `Body Transfers` to Assume the
Identity of other Entities. For navigation purposes your Portable On-
Screen `Alpha Map Display` with Size and Luminance Controls comes in
very handy.

                                                                             
The Many Enemies encountered are superbly rendered and all have their
own unique `high level` artificial intelligence routines, each animated
in true to life multiple positions and each as deadly as the next.

And finally, Genetic Species is brought to life with a massive selection
of High Quality Digital Sounds & Effects with Stereo Surround and an
incredible 30 Minutes of High Quality (in game) CD music.

ENEMIES & CHARACTERS

Security Soldier
An ordinary corporation security soldier wearing a light ergo suit which
is capable of resisting a few direct hits. Security soldiers prowl the
corridors of the base, gunning down intruders with their .44 pistols and
they never stop to ask questions first. Their implants are of a low
                                                                             
grade and they are vulnerable to probe attacks.

Security Officer
High rank Security Officers are tougher, quicker and meaner than
ordinary soldiers. They wear upgraded ergo suits and carry the .44
automatic gun. Their implants are simplistic to preserve human
intelligence and initiative.  Important rooms are often only accessible
to Security Officers.

Cyber Scout
The echelon of the automated defence forces. Hovering a few feet above
the ground they are a deadly foe in deserted corridors due to their
speed. The little human flesh and brain that remains is hidden within a
steel case.  Their implants are protected by extra circuitry, making it
difficult to take them over without killing them.

Face Hugger
This genetically engineered creature has no official name. We believe it
is a new prototype war-unit escaped from some laboratory, and apparently
capable of breeding without artificial support. Being the perfect base
invader it is extremely fast and its spitting of acid creates a very
                                                                             
dangerous entity. They have no implants but their genetic control
mechanisms are very vulnerable to entity take-overs.

Engineer
Otherwise know as the `Dirt Rats`, The Engineers keep the bases running,
they wear no armour and their implants are primitive, but simply
spotting an intruder is enough to bring them to a blood frenzy. If you
get too close, he will try to chop you to pieces with his fire axe, show
him mercy and kill him. Engineers are also needed to access some
systems.

Commander
The commanding officer of the base is the toughest and most dangerous
human you will come across. He throws lethal grenades at intruders. Some
restricted areas are only accessible by the commander or someone
carrying a commander access card.

Zombie
Zombies are the victims of evil Genetic experiments. Dragging their
rotting limbs along, they are slow but also hard to kill. Silenced guns
are not very powerful but zombies will happily keep shooting at you
                                                                             
forever. Their implants have difficulty controlling the damaged brains
and taking them over is often the
easiest way to give them eternal peace.

Gel Man
Little know information on this abdominal creature but the Gel Man is
another genetic creation designed for environments with extreme
pressures. 

Mantis
Little is know about these creatures. They seem to boast some kind of
Psi-weapon.

Mechanoid
Strong defensive units carrying lethal flechette guns. 90% of their
bodies have been mechanised and armoured to take a phenomenal amount of
damage. Their implants are strong, and a PPD attack without stunning
will leave them severely damaged. Notice that they are limited to
warfare and cannot handle delicate objects such as keycards or small
weapons.

                                                                             
Scientist
The science personnel of the laboratories. They wear no armour and carry
weak weapons. Their implants are not designed to repulse a probe attack
so they can easily be taken over. Some areas are only accessible to
scientists.

StormTrooper
Aggressive commando troopers, specially trained to locate and kill
intruders. The standard weapon is the laser rifle which they will
happily use to snipe on you. Their armour is light to allow maximum
mobility and their implants are medium grade.

Chameleon Soldier
The skin of the chameleon man has been altered to camouflage the body.
This works best when he is standing still, only when shooting and
getting hit will the camouflage field disrupt to show the puny human
inside. The high speed assault rifle carried by chameleon soldiers is
too dangerous to ignore, so don't. The implants will yield to persistent
attacks.

Wolfhead
                                                                             
This biped killing machine is one of the most dangerous units around.
Mounted on the left arm is a rocket launcher. You guessed it, Rocket
launchers are bad for your health. Some units come with a Vulcan minigun
instead. The controlling implants of this unit will only disable if
stunned.

Space Pilot
When not piloting space ships, the pilots are in an understandably bad
mood. The Space Pilot carries a grenade launcher which fires stun
grenades capable of putting even the biggest brute to sleep. The clumsy
space suit
puts some restraint on his mobility, but protects against vacuum and
probe attacks.

Battle Cyborg
Battle Cyborgs are enhanced, heavily armoured humans capable of high
speed. They carry flame throwers for toasting enemies. Due to the
exposed upper body, the implants are weak compared to the durability of
the body.

ODDITIES

Amiga CDRom

ENTIRE GAME FEATURES IN DETAIL
-----------------------------------------------------

INSTALLING TO HARD DRIVE
------------------------
Genetic Species runs perfectly from the CD and does not require Hard
Drive installation, but you will need to install various library files
from the 'Install' directory depending on your individual computer set-
up.


GRAPHICS CARD OWNERS
------------------------
If you have a Graphics Card you should install the RTG system. This will
                                                                             
place various files in your libs directory on your hard drive and when
initiating Genetic Species allow you to choose various screen modes from
the RTG requester.

AHI SOUND SUPPORT
------------------------
Genetic Species utilises the AHI sound system allowing multiple channel
and  stereo sound effects (even without a Sound Card) this should be
installed before starting Genetic Species.

PICASSO 96 OWNERS
------------------------
If you have a Picasso Graphics Board there is a full installation
program which will place the needed libraries onto your hard drive.
Having a Picasso board you will more than likely have the needed files
so check that 
this is not an older version than your current one.

CD MUSIC
-----------
Genetic Species contains superb CD Music which is played throughout the
                                                                             
game, to get the best out of this Audio treat make sure your CDRom line
outs are connected to a good stereo system and that the volume is high!
Genetic Species also uses the Amigas Audio outputs for all in-game sound
effects.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS
-----------------
When you have successfully installed the various library files you will
then be able to run Genetic Species by double clicking on it's icon on
the CD.

First up is the Credit sequence, this is our chance to let you know who
all  the 'hard working people' are, who spent many sleepless nights to
bring you Genetic Species. To skip the credit sequence simply press your
LMB.

Now sit back and marvel at the incredible 3D rendered intro animation,
this sets the mood for what is about to follow and gives you an insight
into the current situation in the Genetic Species world. You can
terminate the intro animation by clicking any mouse button. 
Please note that the intro Animation does not utilise Graphics Cards.
                                                                             

CONFIGURATION
---------------
After the intro sequences the first thing you will see is the options
screen. Using the arrow keys and the return key on the keyboard you can
configure Genetic Species to best suit your Amiga's set-up.

You have many options available that alter the way Genetic Species
works. 
You can alter many elements from, screen size, sound set-up, detail
level and control methods. Depending on your Amiga set-up you will soon
find the right balance to make sure Genetic Species performs at the best
possible speed and clarity for your system.

If the frame rate is an important factor when choosing your settings,
you can type `framecount` as a level code which will show the frame
counter on the screen during play.

Once happy with your preference setting you can save them to hard disk
so the next time you play Genetic Species it will already be set-up to
your desired configuration.
                                                                             

When finished in the options Screen simply choose 'Disconnect' to start
playing Genetic Species.


CONFIGURATION SETTINGS IN DETAIL
--------------------------------

Window Size
Controls the size of the visible playing area, this setting has the
greatest influence on game speed.

Floor & Ceiling Detail Mapping
The floor and ceiling detail level can be set to high, low or turned off
completely, the low detail setting produces a 10-20% increase in speed
over the high setting.

Luminance Factor
Is everything too bright in the darkness of your tomb or are those sun
reflexes blotting out everything on the monitor? Boost or reduce
brightness here.
                                                                             

Audio On/Off
If you wish to change AHI mode, you must turn off Audio, exit the menu,
enter the Audio menu again, and turn on Audio. An AHI requester will pop
up, allowing you to choose a new mode or different mixing frequencies.
Note: Turning off Audio can also speed up the game by 8-20%.

Channels
Depending on the AHI mode used, up to 16 channels of sound effects are
allowed.  We recommend using the AHI mode "Paula: DMA 8 bit stereo" for
best performance on Amigas lacking sound card, however you will be
limited to 4 channels.

Volume
Boost the volume to balance Amiga Audio and CD music. Please note that
extreme boosting may cause sound distortion.

Player Control
Here you may select your favourite key settings for controlling the
BioShifter.

                                                                             
Mouse Control
Enable/Disable Mouse - Doesn't need explanation, does it?

Sensitivity Factor
Some mice are more sensitive than others, use this setting to control
how fast the BioShifter turns when moving your mouse.

Control Method
Moving the mouse to the left will turn the BioShifter clockwise. If this
doesn't seem logical to you, change this setting to invert the
direction.

Multitasking On/Off
If you need to keep you operating system and programs running keep the
switch on. Turning off multitasking will freeze all programs increasing
the game speed by 3-4%. Turning it on will restore your system.

Buffering
Really mega-advanced setting for those GFX card users whose GFX card
works best with single buffering. 
On AGA systems you should always use double buffering!
                                                                             

GfxMode
A feature for GFX card owners; with this switch you may force Genetic
Species to bypass RTG, utilising AGA.
It has no effect on AGA only systems.

Language Options
Choose your favourite language here, thanks to the A.T.O.

CD Music On/Off
If your CD-ROM drive misbehaves, try turning off the CD music.

Ammo Display On/Off
Are those awesome transparent ammo counters and health bars annoying
you? Turn them off here.

Difficulty Normal/Easy
This setting controls the damage factor of the game. Chicken players
will choose the easy setting and real hard nut people should choose
Normal.

                                                                             

BACKGROUND HISTORY
------------------
Since the beginning of the 21st century, Multi and Trans-National
corporations had been gaining power.

By the end of the century, global security, commerce and science were in
the hands of a few hundred people. Industrial complexes and research
stations had been established in space and on the moon, where research
would never be impeded by environmental or ethical concerns.

Due to rife competition and security of research, all employees of the
corporations were implanted with artificial control mechanisms to ensure
complete loyalty. Competing freely, conflicts among the corporations
frequently sparked local wars, fought anywhere in the Solar system,
including Earth. As a result the rest of the human race was held
hostage. 

As the 22nd century began, an underground alliance had been established
among countries which were secretly seeking to undermine corporate
power. This alliance was known as the Counter Force Alliance (C.F.A.)
                                                                             
yet their strength was inadequate in the face of corporate power, and
nothing could be accomplished until something tipped the balance of
power. This happened in 2208.

PRESENT DAY
(C.F.A. Internal Memo)
----------------------
Apparently the Nepentian Research Labs on the far side of the Magnus
Crater was seized by an unknown force. Observations suggested intense
ground battles within the vicinity of the base, involving at least three
corporations. Two days ago the battles seemed to diminish, yet we have
been unable to identify which corporation came out victorious, if any.
Throughout the day we have tracked military shuttles shipping troops and
cargo from the remaining lunar facility, the Cantex Supply Station.
Sources have informed us that the destination was the Atlas Mining
Asteroid orbiting the moon.

Atlas Mining Asteroid
---------------------
The Atlas Mining Asteroid is currently being converted into a regular
space fortress armed with high energy space weapons. Whatever purpose
                                                                             
this conversion serves is unknown but we suspect it might become a
threat to Earth. The recent alliance between the remaining military
corporations, the Nepentian Defence Triad and Lantaz Milsec, (to whom
the destroyed lunar bases belonged) suggests knowledge of an impending
disaster. 

Yesterday, 2 out of 3 lunar military bases were vaporised in what looked
like accidents involving stockpiled nuclear weapons but we suspect they
were self-destruct actions aimed at an unknown enemy aggressor. 

We desperately need information on the current situation!

Begin C.F.A. Transmission
-------------------------
For some years, within the many corporation complexes, we have been
planting prototypes of the 'BioShifter'. This mobile device is capable
of taking control of Humans, Cyborgs and Droids through their electronic
implants. 

We have just activated of one of the BioShifters within the Cantex
Supply Station, where the bulk of the troops and supplies are being
                                                                             
launched into space.

Lets hope we get the information we need.

End Transmission
       

BIOSHIFTER INITIALISATION
--------------------------
You are the first BioShifter to be activated in the Cantex Supply
Station.

Once your mounted cameras are activated the distorted image clarifies to
present your environment as a 3D 'first person' perspective view.


MISSION OBJECTIVES
------------------
The plot progression of Genetic Species is Bilinear, this means that you
will have to accomplish various missions before you can progress to
later levels, the way you go about accomplishing your missions is
                                                                             
entirely up to you. Pay close attention to your mission briefings and be
alert at all times and take nothing for granted.


YOUR SURROUNDINGS
-----------------
The 3D environment is presented in glorious texture mapped and light
sourced style instantly allowing you to get a real feel for your
surroundings.

The levels in Genetic Species are broken down into further platforms and
each platform is connected by lift terminals which you can access
freely. This design is very useful for leaving entire sections quickly
in the case of level destruction or in situations where enemy numbers
are outrageously out of balance.

FURNITURE & PROPS
-----------------
Throughout the levels you will come across many interactive Furnishings
such as Doors and Cupboards which can be opened and closed, although
some need to be unlocked first by means of 'switches or key cards'.
                                                                             

Computer Terminals can be found at various stages in the levels which
allows control over the In-Game configurations. 

There are also hidden BioShifters which are only visible to you and have
been planted by the C.F.A. Activate them (by walking over them) and they
will record your current position. This is really useful if you find
yourself `dead` as you will now be allowed to restart from the last
recorded position.

As well as secret passages and many other architectural oddities there
will be various items and objects ranging from exploding barrels, to
energy vortex's, some should be left well alone where others like the
Vortex's can be entered to allow re-topping of energy levels. Most other
items can either be operated, picked up or destroyed but act wisely as
many items can help your missions immensely.

CHARACTERS
----------
There are many interesting and frightening enemies within Genetic
Species ranging from Engineers to Face huggers, each enemy is unique and
                                                                             
has his or her own abilities, weaknesses and weapons, each posing a
different threat. 

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
-----------------------
The characters in Genetic Species are highly intelligent, for example if
you creep around quietly you can sometimes go unnoticed, but when
creating a disturbance either by firing a `non silenced weapon` or
setting off an explosion, then nearby characters (depending on their
hearing levels) are bound to investigate.

Many hours have been spent to develop the AI structures which define the
personality and behaviour of the creatures in different situations so
the following text is for the most intriguing and inquisitive players.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  IN DEPTH
-----------
When initialising a level all enemies are set to `Prowl` mode as
default. In this mode the enemies wander around the level area freely,
searching for intruders. If the player makes any kind of noise, like
firing a
                                                                             
weapon within hearing range, the enemy will notice and while calculating
the easiest route to the origin of the noise, move closer to
investigate.

Generally, doors are not a problem to enemies, as long as they can be
opened and/or unlocked by the current enemy type.

When the player appears in the enemy's line of view, the enemy will
decide what to do considering levels of aggression, health, damage
taken, amount of friends and the distance to the player. Unless the
enemy is mortally
wounded or just a plain coward, he will go into Attack mode where his
only purpose is to get within range of the intruder and kill him. Even
if the player escapes out of sight and doesn't make any noise, the enemy
will continue to follow in the same direction as the player until he
reaches a dead end.

Occasionally the enemy might decide to retreat, panicking and running
away in a random direction from the last known player position. Only
when running into a dead end will he stop to calm down, returning to
prowl mode. 
                                                                             

It might be a good idea to terminate fleeing enemies as they tend to
gossip about your location to other enemy comrades.

BIOSHIFTER SHIFTER CONTROL
--------------------
Being a mobile BioShifter, you have the ability to travel in any
direction, Forwards, Backwards, Sideways and Rotating, you can also
walk, run, look behind you, operate equipment and terminals, open doors,
pickup objects and fire weapons.

PORTABLE PROBE DEVICE (P.P.D.)
------------------------------
The BioShifter has an in-built Portable Probe Device (P.P.D.) which can
be used for two distinct purposes.
 
The first function is to enable you to see what the future holds. The
minute you have launched the probe you will then see 'what it sees'
through the use of an in-built micro camera (The Third Eye).  You can
steer the P.P.D. as it journeys forwards by using the arrow keys to
guide it around corners and down corridors (this is very useful if you
                                                                             
are running low on stamina and want to know what is up ahead). The probe
will only last for around 5 seconds before transmission is terminated or
will cease to function prematurely if it hits a wall or door. Please
note that while you are controlling the P.P.D. your un-defended host
body is vulnerable to enemy attacks.
 
P.P.D. USED FOR ENTITY TAKE OVER
---------------------------------
The second function of the P.P.D. is the most important and an integral
element for success in your missions.
 
If you have previously Stunned a character (See Stunning) then you can
guide the probe straight into that stunned 'Character'. If successful
then your Bio programs will initiate a Cerebral Cortex intrusion through
the Entities Identification implant and your life force will absorb into
that 'Character' allowing you to 'control' and to become that
'Character' for the duration of your life.

The sequence is fast and violent but once successful you should be able
to catch a glimpse of your former hosts body falling to the floor as
your perspective changes.
                                                                             

Taking over other characters is vital to some missions, for example you
might have to become an Engineer to operate a particular piece of
machinery or perhaps a Scientist to gain access to secured Scientific
labs or even 
a Face Hugger to allow fast 'close to floor' escape from a scary
situation.

PICKING UP OBJECTS & WEAPONS
----------------------------
You have the ability to hold up to 3 items (objects or weapons) which
can be accessed during play by pressing the appropriate function keys
F1, F2 or F3.

Your default weapon always resides in the F1 position.

Whenever you run over an item (that can be picked up) it will
automatically fill one of your empty slots, if all slots are filled and
you wish to exchange one of your current items for a newly found item,
then simply stand over the newly found item and press either F2 or F3 to
make the exchange.
                                                                             

You can also get information on your active object or weapon by pressing
and holding down the help key on the keyboard.


WEAPONS
-------
The weapon arsenal in Genetic Species is one of the most brutal any
Amiga game has ever seen, ranging from Electric drills, Grenade
launchers to Rocket Launchers, you will never be helpless when faced
against incredible odds. When you take over certain characters you
automatically have access to their weapon but many weapons are also
littered around the locations.

Bare in mind that the ability to use certain weapons is only allowed by
certain characters so be careful to choose wisely when taking over

----------
The blood of a Weapon! You'll soon learn that no matter how good a
weapon is, it is useless without ammunition. Ammunition can be collected
throughout the levels but conserve your need for wasting it as there's
nothing worse than being caught in a corridor with 6 fully armed Droids
approaching with only one bullet left! Best use it on yourself! :)

Some weapons (like the Fire Axe) have unlimited Ammunition.

STUNNING CHARACTERS
-------------------
There are special Stun weapons available, these give off sharp
concentrated electric energy bursts or stun smoke and when used properly
will stun almost all living entities. 

Sometimes the stunned Entities appearance turns a frosty blue colour as
their cells temporarily solidify but in all successful stuns the
character remains motionless, although the stunned state is only
temporary it should give you enough time to launch the P.P.D. for take-
over or at least run away.
                                                              
                                                                             
Some smaller weapons can also stun characters but are not so reliable.

PORTABLE MAP
------------
To help you keep track of your virtual location you are also equipped
with a portable map device, this can be activated or deactivated by a
press of a button and also scaled to fill all your display or part of
your display. 

There is also the ability to set the luminance controls so it can be
dimmed into your view to allow continuous play whilst map reading.
However the maps should only be used as a rough guide to your location
as the data may be somewhat outdated and not reveal all secret
locations.

HINTS AND TIPS
--------------
You never know what can happen in Genetic Species, some puzzles are
devious and not everything should be destroyed or blown away, look out
for secret passage ways and rooms and always make sure you are the
correct character for the task ahead. Good Luck!
                                                                             

DEFAULT KEYBOARD CONTROLS
-------------------------
Arrow Left - Rotate Left
Arrow Right - Rotate Right
Arrow Up - Walk Forwards
Arrow Down - Walk Backwards

< - Side Step Left
> - Side Step Right
Side Stepping can also be achieved by holding down the Right Amiga Key
whilst pressing the Left and Right Arrow Keys.

Phase 5 Licensee

Langen/Oberursel, Germany, March 9th, 1998 - AMIGA International, Inc. and
phase 5 digital products today announced that they have signed a license
agreement for the AMIGA OS 3.1 which will allow phase 5 to use AMIGA OS 3.1
in future products.

"We are glad to see that with phase 5 digital products another important
developer and manufacturer in the AMIGA market shows his commitment towards
the AMIGA OS 3.1", says Petro Tyschtschenko of AMIGA International, Inc.
"As phase 5 has led the development of PowerPC products for the AMIGA, this
is an important agreement which will give a  momentum to the future
development of AMIGA and AMIGA-compatible systems, an expectation which is
also supported by the cooperation of the different licensees of our AMIGA
technology", he adds.

The license agreement will allow phase 5 digital products to use AMIGA OS
3.1 in future products and thus expand the PowerUP product line by
stand-alone systems; as a logical step, the company has immediately
announced the development of such an independent computer system. "We are
very glad that we have been able to negotiate an agreement which allows us
to spend significant efforts into this new project, and we appreciate the
support of AMIGA International, Inc. and especially Petro Tyschtschenko
for our project", said Wolf Dietrich, General Manager of phase 5 digital
products."This partnership shows the committment to the AMIGA and is an
important signal for the future of the system.

PHASE 5 DIGITAL PRODUCTS ANNOUNCES DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRE\BOX,
A POWERPC-BASED COMPUTER SYSTEM WITH AMIGA OS 3.1

Beside the finalization of upcoming products such as the CyberVisionPPC and
the BVisionPPC graphics cards, phase 5 digital products has started a new
development project for a stand-alone, PowerPC-based computer system,
called the pre\box, which will use the licensed AMIGA OS 3.1 and a further
advanced version of the PowerUP System Software to provide Amiga
compatibility on the AMIGA OS/Workbench 3.1 level under CyberGraphX V3.

"The license agreement that we have signed with Amiga International allows
us to start the development project of this new machine, which had been in
conceptual design for several months now. It is an important step for
revitalizing the Amiga market, encouraging developers and rebuilding a
market which is strong enough to maintain" says Wolf Dietrich, General
Manager of phase 5. In a separate announcement Dietrich states that the
A\BOX, the long-term technology project of phase 5 digital products, is
postponed but not cancelled. "The A\BOX project will be continued with
revised targets and specifications and with extended resources, based on
the succesful introduction of the new product lines". Dietrich points out
that the key for the survival of the Amiga and the Amiga market is the
availability of new outstanding stand-alone hardware products as soon as
possible, a goal which shall be reached with the pre\box design. "We need
an expanding market in the very near future, or the battle may be lost for
the Amiga computer system" he adds.

TAKING THE NEXT STEP TOWARDS POWERPC MULTIPROCESSING, THE PRE\BOX WILL TAKE
OFF TO NEW PERFORMANCE DIMENSIONS

The new pre\box machines will be targeting the medium and upper price
regions for PCs or Personal Workstations, but are designed to provide
stunning performance. All systems will come as multi-processing systems
with at least four PowerPC CPUs installed, which will allow them to provide
an extremely high computing power at an outstanding price/performance
relation."Multi-processing has been one of the most important goals, if not
THE most important design goal for phase 5 digital products in the past 18
months" explains Wolf Dietrich. "It is here where alternative technology
can offer advantages and superiority over the mainstream products in the PC
market. While our current PowerUP product line, which consists of upgrade
cards for existing machines, helps the user to update his system and secure
the investments made in existing hardware and software, it is a challenge
to built new stand-alone hardware products which can price-wise compete
with the mainstream PCs - especially under the impression that PC systems
are blown out at dumping prices regularly, and that a PC system you buy
today maybe outdated and nearly worthless in less than a
year."Consequently, the company does not plan to build single-CPU systems
which would have to compete at a similar performance level with Intel-based
systems, but wants to fully utilize the opportunities which have been given
with the move to the PowerPC. "Developers who jump on the PowerUP bandwagon
today can make their products ready for multiprocessing quite easily.
Therefore it will be possible to take two giant steps - from a single-CPU
68k system to a Multi-CPU PowerPC system - within only one year, an
impressive progress for the Amiga community which many have not thought
possible" Dietrich adds.

The pre\box system is designed on a ATX formfactor motherboard and
incorporates a fast SDRAM-based memory subsystem with initially up to 100
MHz memory speed. Depending on the actual bus speed of the PowerPC
processors which are used, the processor bus also runs at up to 100 MHz.The
four PowerPC processors, which are located on a separate CPU card, will be
equipped with inline or backside caches, depending on which type of
processor is actually used. As the PowerUP System Software features a
software-controlled cache coherency, the pre\box can even be equipped with
CPUs which do not offer hardware support for multiprocessing, such as the
PPC603e or the PPC750 (G3).

The pre\box system also has an integrated 3D graphics subsystem,which is
connected via a 66 MHz PCI 2.1 bus with a peak performance of 264 MB/s and
comes with eight MB of graphics memory. With this gfx subsystem, a powerful
standard is provided as the minimum base configuration on which software
designers can rely. But more than that: On the same 66 MHz PCI bus there is
a special slot for a Voodoo2-based 3D accelerator card which is directly
coupled to the built-in gfx chip. "We plan to provide, either on our own or
in cooperation with other vendors, a Voodoo2-based solution as a powerful
upgrade option" comments Wolf Dietrich. "We will not forget the demands of
the serious gamers." The stunning display features of the pre\box systems
will be accomplished by a powerful CD quality, stereo sound system with
extensive sound synthesis features.

Also as standard, there will be an Ultra-Wide SCSI-II controller and a 100
Mbit ethernet controller integrated, which will allow usage of todays
powerful UW-SCSI devices and provide fast network connectivity - a feature
which will also support the distributed multiprocessing concepts of phase 5
digital products.

For the use of inexpensive hardware expansions, a PCI bus with three
standard PCI slots is integrated. This PCI bus runs at 66 MHz, but will
also accept 33 MHz PCI boards. With the PCI bus integrated, development of
new stunning hardware products for the pre\box systems is quite easy; more
than that, developers can use standard PCI products and adopt them for the
pre\box systems by simply writing software support for them.

Yet not decided is, if there will be a socket for an optional 68k CPU left
on the board. "In this next-generation product, the consequent option for
using 68k software will be emulation. We are continuously encouraging Amiga
developers to support our new MP software technologies and guidelines which
we introduced with our PowerUP System Software, and those who follow these
recommendations will be able to provide applications that utilize the vast
power of our upcoming pre\box system right away. This is where efforts
should be spend now" says Wolf Dietrich.

Beside these main features, the pre\box will offer all standard
functionality which is expected from a computer system today, such as fast
serial and parallel interfaces, an USB bus, and an EIDE interface for use
of e.g. inexpensive CD-ROM drives or additional cheap harddrives.

The pre\box release is scheduled for the early fourth quarter 1998. The
pricing of the pre\box system is already determined based on the current
pricings for PowerPC processors. Currently it is planned to offer the
following versions of the pre\box with the following suggested retail
prices:

 * pre\box 604/800 with four PPC604e-200  MHz CPUs
  suggested retail price:
  DM 3.995,- / US$ 1995.00/ UK£ 1495.00

 * pre\box 604/1000 with four PPC604r-250 MHz CPUs
  suggested retail price:
  DM 4.995,- / US$ 2495.00/ UK£ 1895.00

 * pre\box 604/1200 with four PPC604r-300 MHz CPUs
  suggested retail price:
  DM 6.995,- / US$ 3395.00/ UK£ 2595.00

 * pre\box 750/1200 with four PPC750-300 MHz CPUs,
  each with 1 MByte Backside Cache
  suggested retail price:
  DM 8.995,- / US$ 4495.00/ UK£ 3395.00

(German and UK prices include VAT, US prices excl. local taxes, all prices
are based on the current currency exchange rates. Specifications and prices
are subject to change without prior notice).

These prices are valid for pre\box systems in an ATX minitower, including
mouse and keyboard, as well as AMIGA OS 3.1 and the PowerUP System
Software, excluding memory, harddrive and CD-ROM. For an entry-level
configuration of memory, harddrive and CD-ROM (32MB, 4GB, 24speed) an
additional DM 750,- (US$ 375.00 or UK 275.00) must be considered. "Of
course, we may see changing prices and different configurations/speed
grades with changing prices of the PowerPC CPUs and availability of new
and/or faster PowerPC processors" adds Wolf Dietrich.

In order to support and encourage customers of PowerUP boards for existing
Amigas, phase 5 digital products will offer substantial discounts on the
purchase of pre\box systems to owners of PowerUP boards. "We want to
provide security for the investments of the users today. Obviously, Amiga
users and developers need to see a fast growing base of PowerPC systems in
these days, in order to support the progress of developments. We want to
encourage the users to invest in PowerPC technology now" comments Wolf
Dietrich. Owners of PowerUP boards who later take advantage of the
discounts on purchases of a pre\box system will not have to return their
PowerUP boards to receive this discount, but can continue to use their
PowerUP-Amiga as a stand-alone system or even use it's performance from the
pre\box via a link system which will be provided with the pre\box, and with
which the networked multiprocessing feature of the PowerUP System Software
can be utilized.

With this new product roadmap and variety of powerful and stunning products
to come, phase 5 digital products underscores it's position as the leading
innovator in PowerPC hardware and system software development in the Amiga
market. "We want to further support the Amiga market with these efforts"
states Wolf Dietrich. "Part of our efforts will also be to support the
developers, and to encourage them to develop for PowerUP with our best
endeavours. We will do whatever is possible for us to make existing
developers stay with the Amiga, and will also try to win back Amiga
developers who have left the platform or put developments on hold. Recent
releases of PowerUP compatible software products, which had been realized
within just a few weeks by their developers, show how easy and efficiently
existing Amiga software products can be ported to support the new processor
and performance generation. To convince software developers, we also need
to make them aware of the market potential and the outlook to the future
that we offer. All users can support these efforts, too, by contacting
their favourite Software vendors and requesting PowerUP versions of their
software."«

 The Aminet`s Game/ drawer wasn`t that active when I looked at the 
beginning of this month. Although it was mostly filled with Game Patches I 
only downloaded 6 games. One of which needed 10mb RAM to run!!!! That one 
I did not review! Core! How many `POWER AMIGA' owners are there out there? 
I`ve only got a standard A1200 with 2mb Chip RAM, maybe I need to upgrade!

 This month this section is not so bustling, I have reviewed 5 games, all 
of which are brilliant, trust me to pick out all the best! The only one I 
did not like that much was 3D Space Battle, I gave it 77%, but thats still 
pretty good. I am also disapointed, I have got NO screenshots! Where are 
they people?? Give them to me NOW!!

 Are P.D games getting better, is this the Amiga owners plead to get Amiga 
games back in ALL the shops?? I wish it could be that simple! Also, look in
the Tips `n' Cheats for the solution to Dream Web. Until next month where 
i`ll be putting WBsteriods and Croins Head 2 Head...

@{fg shine} Legends of Triten@{fg text}

 Legends of Triten is not realy the kind of game i would play, but it is
quite a good piece of coding. It is an action game and if you've ever played
ZELDA it is very similar, you play a man who has to kill these little black
rabbit type things as he travels on his journey. The thing i don't
understand though is that the version i have got has lots and lots of FMV's
but it onley uses 1 of them at the start i think this is because i havn't
got far enough to see them all, i get to the temple and some guy in a black
cape tries to kill me with his septor, you can't get out or kill the guy so
i don't know what to do. If you play it and you get passed the man in the
temple then email me at mightyone@reaperman.demon.co.uk and tell me how you
did it. 
 The graphics in the game are good and the characters are well animated 
all of the characters are Manga or Anime (japanese cartoon). But the 
background can be quite blocky at times so that is a bit of a let down. All 
in all i think it is a good game and worth getting from the Aminet (that is 
where it is available by the way)

@{fg shine} BomberGug@{fg text}

 BomberGug is a new version of bomberman or Dyna Blaster as it was
known on the Amiga. I havn't seen one of these types of games on the
Amiga since Dyna Blaster so I jumped at the chance of downloading a 
new one!!!

 Loading the game is a bit wierd because the intro screen loads then
flicks back to WB then goes to the title screen, you click fire to
play, it flicks back to WB and then after about 20 seconds flicks onto
the game. This isn't a problem just a funny way of loading a game!

 When the game is up you will see it is exactly like the orginal,
except the graphics of course. The graphics are no where near as good
as the orginal and could do with a little improving before they 
release the full game (it's only a demo) The music is excellent and
the gameplay matches all other versions of the game I have played.

 The idea of bomber man is to kill each other, its a two player game
and you each start in the corner of the playing area, before you can
reach each other you have to blast through blocks, some blocks will
reveal extra bombs which you can drop or extra firepower which means
when the bombs go off they'll blow more blocks up.

 Overall, it doesn't offer anything new to the Bomberman series and
if you've already got Dyna Blaster you won't want this but if you don't
have either of these games it worth checking out.

@{fg shine} Age of Rock@{fg text}

 We have all heard of Tetris, the classic game, well, there seems to be 
loads of clones about on the Amiga, but when the author changes it around a
bit, puts some guns in there, and has the option for up to 3 players, thats
when Tetris gets that much better!!! That is Age Of Rock.

 With Age Of Rock you do not control the rocks as you do it Tetris, you 
control the gun at the bottom of the screen, the idea is to make rectangles
out of the rocks which fall into the well from the top. You better what out
though, because some of the rocks that fall down are really more than one 
rock.

 When you press fire a rock comes out of your gun, and when it hits a rock 
it forms another square. If it misses it goes straight out of the well. If 
any of the squares happen to touch the bottom of the well its Game Over!

 When you progress onto the `later levels' the rock graphics change into 
all sorts of things, they are also different colours and you have to press 
up to change the colour of your squares or else they will go straight 
through. This is really tedious, and really gets on my nerves when the 
rocks are nearly at the bottom of the screen and I have to keep pressing 
up!

 Another feature in Age Of Rock is the option for up to 3 players to play 
together or against each other, when ever one you choose they are much more
fun that the one player, and if you are playing together, at least you have
somebody to blame when Game Over appears!!

 This game will keep you ocupied for ages, with the amount of levels 
available to play, the multi-player options. Get this NOW!!

@{fg shine} Croins@{fg text}

 The editor wanted me to review this one, I had no say in the matter, the 
ed is a classics fan [Ed- oi, no i'm not!!!], and if you look in Issue 10, 
you`ll see another classic title, WBsteriods, well, this is almost the 
same. This is Croins! Another Asteriods clone!!!!

 When you first load this you can see this is not your average classic 
Asteriods game with rubbish graphics! This is a step away from the 
classic, the graphics are much better, you have great music and you even 
get a little pointer telling you which way you can fire!!

 Playing the game is simply enough, you can disable the Hyper-Space 
option which you can operate by pressing down on the joystick, this is 
handy, because when I press up to move about the screen I have a habbit of 
pressing down to slow down, but this doesn`t work and I go into 
hyper-space! Damm!!

 Another good feature in the game is when you press up to move, if you hold
down up and start to move faster and faster, then the stars in the 
background start to move, giving you the real speedy feeling!

 The only thing I don`t like about this game is when you fire, a red ball 
comes out a fires at the asteriods, this is really uneffective, the firing 
in WBsteriods was much better. Don`t get me wrong, this is a great game, 
very playable and will last you till the year 2000!!!

@{fg shine} 3D Space Battle@{fg text}

 3D Space Battle, as the name sergests is a 3D space battle for two 
players, the idea is to destroy your opponent using one of three weapons 
you choose using the OPTIONS!

 Due to a major disk problem of no fault of the program I couldn`t test 
this out fully, but the time I did have playing with it was very confusing 
to say the least. One player uses the arrow keys and various keys on the 
keyboard, and the other player uses the numric pad, I tried them both and 
found it very hard to control my craft. Using the numric pad I kept 
pressing 7 to fire instead or 9 and my weapon was unloaded!!

 In the time I had to play this I couldn`t even find my opponent, let alone
kill it, but I used the weapons and they fired straight in front of me, the
graphics were cool and the sfx even better!

 I would not play this game all the time, I can`t seem to `get into it'. If
you like the seak and destroy kind of game I would get this, but its 
nothing special.

 Perhaps, if I had a little more time I could have mastered the controls 
and challenged my friends to a go! Don`t get me wrong, this is a good 
game, the graphics are nice and the way you move around is smooth and 
effective.

@{fg shine} NEDSUW 2: Ula Tor@{fg text}

 "Not another boring text-based R.P.G", I hear you all cry out, well, your 
right,its not! This is one of those really good ones, no pictures just 
straight forward text and a brilliant adventure!

 Altough text-based adventures aren`t great in the graphics aspect, it is 
amazing how good some of these game can be, this one is the 2nd by the 
author, he has made a whole series of NEDSUW games, and they are most 
proberly as good as each other.

 When you start the game you are presented with the title screen asking you
if you want instructions, there is not much point to that as the 
instructions and included in a text file complete with the archive! When 
you get into the game you are at the edge of a wood, you can`t see it, but 
just imagine! You can go north, south, east or west, the options available 
in all good adventures. The real crule bit now, if you go on way you go to 
a tree, the other way, into a castle, but if follow one of the other two 
paths you end up lost in the wood. Now, if you press HELP a little guy 
comes out from nowhere and advises you to get a map! This guy is quite 
helpfull some of the time, he is also funny as well.

 You better be careful when you are wondering about as there are quite a 
lot of places where you can die, in the process of completing the game you 
will die quite a lot!

 The adventure is quite big in all, you can explore a variety of different 
rooms, and interact with loads of different characters. The complete 
solution is included so if you get stuck you can have a quick look at that.

 Overall this is a really brilliant game, it won`t last that long, most of 
the puzzles are quite puzzling, which slows you down a bit, but when you 
have done it you have done it, THE END!

 Look out! The cowboys are in town. Yes! You`ve guessed it, this is a 
wild-west kind of a game! Its for one or two players, the idea, simple, 
seak and destroy your opponent!

 This games gameplay is brilliant, you play one of the cowboys and you must
kill the other cowboy, which is ever another human player or the computer! 
You have only 20 bullets in your ammo displayed to the side, every now and 
again around the desert you might find some bannana looking objects, these 
are actually extra ammo, pick up as many as you can, you`ll nedd to when 
you run out!

 The graphics in this game are not that good, the programmer is defenatly 
not an artist, I couldn`t do much better, but the graphics don`t let the 
game down, the gameplay is there, and the quality all these massive 3D 
games on 5-CD`s lack. A yellow background, a few rocks and trees, and of 
cource the cowboys! Simple, but effective.

 I really love this game, I love the part where on of you gets killed and 
you hear `I Win!' Its great! Download it for the gameplay, not the 
graphics!

cracked wall.
4- The wall is now destroyed.  Destroy the other cracked wall and take

2- Now open the 3 doors and collect the Fireblade from the chest and get
ready to use it.
3- Make your way through the maze destroying all the creatures and take
the right exit.

switch swaps between 2 different mazes.  Your aim is to get to the exit
on the right. There area couple of ways to get there.
2- Press the first switch at the top.
3- Go right and press the switch near the flame torch.

3- Destroy all the orcs.  The exit will not open until Kilmando is dead.

pressure pads.  Once you're on top of the second pressure pad, walk
right and step on the pad there.  Step on the pressure pad above that
and the one on the right.
2- Walk down through the passage and all the pits should now be closed.                                                                             
3- There is a hand print on the wall, but it won't open until you've
destroyed the 4 mirrors.
4- Open the door and destroy the homing domes.
5- Talk to Karlos, then take the right exit.

combination switches yet.  Take the left transporter and go through the
top exit.

column you can move is the one without a shadow.  Push the column 1
down, 4 right, 4 down and then left to the now open wall.
2- Push the column into the hole in the ground so you can walk across

to deactivate the force field.
5- Now you can go through the force field gate to the exit at the top.

1- This next section is a series of random mazes.  You have to find 3
special keys. The maze will go on forever until the keys are found.
2- A key can be found on every 3rd maze, so keep walking up taking the
top exit until you get to the 3rd maze where you will find the first
key.

arena.

boulder through the door.  It will then keep rolling until it reaches
the pit.

exit.

2- Take the right exit into the next arena.

1- Go right along the bottom and collect all the pickups.
2- Go back up through the arch and collect the bomb on the top left of
the arena.

@{fg shine} Games reviews and what there score means@{fg text}

 Games are reviewed mostly on playability and how long they will last
you, although some big games with fancy graphics might be expected to
get good reviews it is not always the case. A small 10k game might
get a better overall score than a 1Mb game. It is not that the 1Mb
game isn't any good it's just that the playablility might be non
exsistant and there is no point in downloading a huge file if it
will last a couple of minutes and you will only run it to show off
to friends.

@{fg shine} SWOSfff V2.3@{fg text}

 As you may have noticed over the last year or so there have been a few
Sensible World of Soccer data editors being released and here is a new
one, this is about the third I have seen. The idea of this program is to
edit the data in your SWOS data draws, you can load in any team in the
world and change practically anything from there price to the various
skills they have. 

 A good feature about this SWOS data editor is it has an automatic
pack option, so if you've got Propack in your C: directory you can
pack the files in the editor insted of having to do them manually
like some other editors I have tried. Another good feature of SWOSfff
is that you can edit your current management games and this to my 
knolage is the first editor that allows you to do this. I have found
it anoying on SWOS that if you buy a player worth £2 million for 
£5 million the price doesn't go up to the value that you bought the
player for like it would in real life. Now all you have to do is load
up the editor and change it to the right amount, you can also change
everyone of there skills from heading to shooting.

 The interface is nicely laided out, it is made in amos but if your
not worried about multitasking this isn't a problem. The sections
are spread out well and are clearly marked and easy to understand
for begginers.

 Overall a great package, although it is not a WB application and can't
multitask properly it has some very useful features that make it the
best editor I have seen to date.

@{fg shine} Format V1.71@{fg text}

 Its been along time since Commodore programed the format function and
now it's becoming just a little outdated in the cosmetic style. So heres
a new format replacement that uses MUI.

 There isn't really alot to say about it, it does all the things that the
normal format does but it looks alot better and is easier to use as it
uses MUI. Of course you have to have MUI but if you have this is definatly
worth a download, take a look at the screenshot and see for yourself.

@{fg shine} WatchWatcher V1.3@{fg text}

 Watchwatcher is a very simple, but very vital program that all of us
need. There isn't much to say about it except it checks your clock to
see if it's altered to stupid dates, sometimes if your HD crashes
or programs muck up your clock you can go on without knowning your 
clock is set to something stupid like 12/12/2001 00:01 when it is
really 16/03/98 22:00 (The time of writing this :) ) If this happends
then watchwatcher will notify you. It's a program all of us need,
so i'll just leave you to the program description by the author :

"Have you ever encountered programs that overwrites your system clock?
It's mostly old games, demos and sometimes strange system hangups also
causes the date to be set to an incorrect value. This results in a clock
set to often insane values, sometimes it's 1989 (travelling back in time?)
and sometimes the clock says that the date is 2001 (amazing having an
computer that can travel into the future!!!)
All this makes me mad, so I wrote this little program to help me overcome
these problems."

 Overall this a vital program that we all can't do without!!!

@node "ur4" "DCTelnet"

@{fg shine} DCTelnet V1.4@{fg text}

 DCTelnet is a telnet client for the Amiga. It is allows you to connect
up to online services when online to the internet, you can connect to
various things encluding unix systems to run shell accounts and BBSes
on telnet, this can save the cost of using a dial up for BBSes as you
can just go on while downloading some files off the aminet or waiting
for a web page to load in.

 You type in the IP address of the _server_ you want to connect to and
it'll instanly take you there. The IP address of someone is usually the
bit after the @ in there email address if they have static account but
if you have a dynamic account which means you ip changes everytime
you connect to your internet provider it will be different and you will
have to ask the BBS owner what there IP is at that time.

 It has all the features you would expect it to have like upload/download,
ansi colours, return codes. etc... DCTelnet V1.4 is probably the best
telnet software available on the amiga at this time. It has many features
which make it better than others available and is one of the only telnet
clients I have seen that supports full ansi colours. Although telnet can
be slow, if your going to want to use telnet I definatly recommend you
use DCTelnet V1.4.

@{fg shine} Utils reviews and what there score means@{fg text}

 Utils are not marked on how good they are compared to other utils,
they are marked by usefulness and what purpose they serve. As there
are so many different utils that do so many different things it is
hard to review something like MUI and then when reviewing a program
like a WB clock say it wasn't up to the standard of MUI. This is why
it is not possible to have a Top Ten list for utils.

      the time went on i thought, what the hell, there might be someone
      else interested so i decided to release it. 

      i know some of you find it lame to release game lists, i don't, i 
      think it's a bit interesting to see what's going on and stuff. 
      it's not like it's a group release or whatever...

      feel free to drop me a mail about it and i will update the list.

@node "fe3" "Problems with Amiga clones"

@{fg shine} Problems with Amiga clones@{fg text}

 No doubt most of you will have heard of the many NEW amigas comming,
or that have already been released, we've got the BoXeR, the A/BOX,
the other one from Power Computing and the many others that i've
either forgotten or there would be to many to list. No, i'm not joking
it seems that there are so many new amiga clones comming out using the
Amiga hardware, you may think that this is a good thing, but I for one
don't!

 My reasons for disliking the amount of Amiga clones that are comming
out is because, if a third of the Amiga market buy the BoXeR, then
another third buy the A/Box and the last third buy the one from Power
everyone is going round with different computers, this will split
the Amiga community and make the userbase even smaller. If these
computers were or are all compatible then fine, but still is there much 
point if a new official amiga is planned? We also have pOS comming out 
but if there is going to be Workbench 4 is there much reason for that
either?

 Aswell as this the new amiga clones comming out just seem to have
an 68030 processor, a big harddrive, CD-rom and a few other bits,
if the future of the Amiga is PPC why don't they invest in making these
clones PPC only with the 68000 series for backwards compatibility.
It seems pointless buying one of these 'Amiga clones' if it is not
offering anything new over the already existing hardware. All the so 
called clones offer is your existing hardware stuffed in a tower case and
not much else.

 Ok, i'm not saying don't buy any of these clones but why are these
companys producing them if a new Amiga is planned? It seems pointless
to me!

@node "fe5" "Interview"

@{fg shine} Interview with Austex@{fg text}

 We recived an interview with Austex from Vulcan a few weeks ago so
here it is. It's a pretty good read!

Q: Who are the members of your team and how did you come to form Austex?

Paul: Austex Software has only two members, Stephen Smith and Paul
                                                                             
Goulding. We have both been Amiga owners since 1987 and formed our own
demo group in 1989, with two other members, called Aushax.  
We coded a few demos (about four) and then decided to do a compilation
disk with a number of demos, some utilities and a freeware game. This
compilation disk was completed in 1990 and was titled "Genesis". The
game was called Nebula and was later given some pretty good re-views in
the Amiga Magazines.  As we completed the genesis collection, we decided
to leave the demo coding scene and commence a commercial project with 
just Stephen and myself.  
As such, one of the demos on the disk was titled "End of Aushax". It was
the death of Aushax and the birth of Austex Software.  So, it was early
1991 when we first began planning the game we now call Uropa2.  We had a
talented graphics artist for Uropa2, Bruce Abel, but he isn't actually a
member of Austex Software.

Q: Uropa2 is a very complex game containing a multitude of genres, did                                                                             
it evolve as you progressed or did you work to a set design?

Paul: A set design!! I wish. The game we planned and the game we
released only have one thing in common, they were both 3D isometric,
apart from that, it has completely changed.

Stephen: It was originally going to be called "Ulterior Colony" and
based on a murder investigation aboard a space freighter name
Vindicator. In the beginning of 1991, we had written down plans for the
game and needed a graphic artist. We eventually approached a local guy
by the name of Bruce Abel who agreed to do the graphics
for us. He started doing some, but was not too keen on doing Isometric
stuff. We wanted colonists drawn in Iso3D to roam around the freighter,
but what we ended up with were robotic looking creatures. 

Now, Bruce was starting to add his game input which started making it
difficult to adhere to the original plans. As the design started
changing, we ended up with gameplay that was boring, repetitive and
difficult to code for. At that time, around 1994, the solution was to
modify the game to incorporate features from the original Uropa 1, which
we completed a number of years before. This made a tremendous difference                                                                             
to the whole project and allowed us to finish the game. My only regret
is that the graphics could have been more modern. The surface section
should have had textures, real-time light sourcing and more control for
the hovars such as angled flying, height etc.. The base section would
look better in hi-res mode, with larger than screen rooms and levels.

Q: What was the inspiration behind Uropa2?

Paul: Well, that's difficult, I suppose the original Uropa which we both
coded on the BBC and Commodore 64 during 85 & 86 was an inspiration.
The inspiration for the original Uropa was Elite on the 64 and BBC.  I
still think Elite was more ground breaking at that time then any of the
Doom/Quake clones are today.  But Uropa2 is 
nothing like Elite, so I suppose there have been a number of games that
have inspired parts of Uropa2, but nothing that really stands out has
having a significant influence.  Has that answer confused everyone?.

Stephen: Yes! Originally with Uropa1, I wanted to write a game where you
could travel about a planet via some sort of vehicle or ship and then go                                                                             
underground and explore various cities etc.  Elite was great, but I
wished that you could go down and visit the planets. Frontier sort of
fixed that, but you couldn't go down and wander around inside buildings.
Uropa2 allows you to fly about the moons surface and then visit a base
and wander around inside. However, total freedom to go anywhere on the
surface and have puzzles to solve became a coding nightmare, so the
solution was to make it mission based.

Q: Uropa2 is huge! how long did it take you to develop it?

Paul: Oh, don't bring this up, it has taken too long.  As I mentioned
earlier, we started planning the game in early 1991.  We commenced
actual coding of the game in late 1991.  So if my mathematics is
correct, it's taken us about six years to complete the game.  It was
originally planned to be ready sometime in 1994,  but we kept 
changing it so much, and then it required more features to be brought
back up to date.  This dragged it on a bit, plus in early 1996 we became
very disappointed in the Amiga scene and gave up on it for about six                                                                             
months. Then after further thought, we decided the only chance for the
Amiga to survive was for software developers to  keep supporting it. 
So, we finished it.

Stephen: Also, the shareware release was a bit of a flop, so Vulcan came
to rescue us. I suppose a lot of people would be asking, "why the hell
did it take six years to write Uropa2?". I've asked that question
myself, quite a lot. One of the major reasons for taking so long is that
we both have other jobs and Uropa2 was a part-time programming project. 

Q: What is your favourite element of the finished game?

Paul: It's not a "Doom/Quake" clone or a "Red alert" clone.  Now, I
really like Red alert, but that genre of game is very common at the
moment and Uropa2 is very different to either one.  We also put in a
hell of a lot of attention to finer detail, there are a lot of aspects
to the game that most people won't see unless they play
around and try doing things in the game that arent necessary to                                                                             
complete objectives. Little things like, burn a few colonists and see
what happens, another Centurion droid will transport into the main
transporter room and start hunting you down.

Stephen: I like the duality of the game with the base and surface
sections. I think that it breaks up the game from just being one style.

Q: What other Amiga projects have you been involved in?

Stephen: I worked on a number of projects involving the Amiga at the
University I worked for. These included a VHF radar system, of which I
designed and programmed the A/D card, firmware and radar software. 

Q: What is the Amiga scene like down under?
                                                                             
Paul: A bit sad really, there are still dedicated Amiga shops in about
four or five of the major metropolitan cities, but out in the regional
cities like Townsville there are none.  I guess there are still a number
of enthusiasts around and we still talk to them on IRC,  but it needs a
major injection of enthusiasm from Gateway 2000.  

Q: Has it been difficult developing for the Amiga during these turbulent
times?

Paul: In the early days it was very exciting, this gave us the needed
push, but once Commodore went crash in 1994, it did become difficult.
We became very annoyed with a number of the people that we thought were
responsible for the Amigas downfall.  You will be able to guess who by
playing the game, they get a few
disguised mentions.  The surprising part is the renewed interest in the
Amiga over the last six 
months, companies like Vulcan, Phase 5, and others are pushing it, this
is good to see.

Q: What would you like to see happen to the Amiga?

Stephen: The Amiga obviously needs an overhaul, in both the OS and
hardware. The OS is all that the Amiga has going for it at the moment
though. When the Amiga came out, it's custom chipset astounded everyone.
The push nowadays is to go with the flow and use "off the shelf" parts.
However, an interesting trend at the
moment is that some companies are just designers and leave the actual
chip making to other known companies. I can't see why this couldn't be
done with the Amiga, design a new chipset and get some large
semiconductor manufacturer to produce them. This has happened with
Chromatic Research and their MPact chips.

Paul: Become a new, modern, powerful and wonderful computer again
(nostalgia kicks in).  I still remember the days when we could look at
other computer owners, especially PC's, and really pity them.  The Amiga
was better in every feature back in the late 80's. There are still some
features about the Amiga that are better than the 
only other two (Macs & PC's).

Q: What is the best part about being Amiga developers?

Paul: Not having to code on a PC.  Lets face it, Windows is the most
bloated piece of software I have ever used.  

Stephen: I like the Amiga, and I like coding for it. The fact that it
has survived through two bankruptcies is testament to it's original
concept. I have never coded on the PC and never will. 

Q: What advice would you give to other people who want to develop Amiga
games?

Paul: I have 3 tips.;
                                                                             
1. Don't code in 100% assembly language.
2. Don't code in 100% assembly language.
3. Don't code in 100% assembly language.

Seriously though, when we coded the demos, we were quite happy to use
assembly language and hit the hardware.  However, games are an
application that should obey all the operating system rules.  Such a
large application is too difficult and time consuming to code in
assembly.  The next project we do will probably be 
an 80/20 mix, 80% will be C, or C++, or a similar high level language
and the remaining 20% will be assembly.

Make sure you find some dedicated beta testers that are serious about
testing and not just trying to get hold of a game for free.  We had a
few good testers and they were excellent while others basically told us
nothing and just wanted another free copy as they became available (may
their chooks turn into Emu's and kick their dunny doors down).  Look
after your good ones and get rid of the useless ones.

Stephen: My advice would be to never program a game part-time (nowadays
anyway). Also, make sure you have a team of people organised so that                                                                             
each person knows exactly what they're supposed to do. 

Paul: Also, if your writing a game part-time, it will take you take you
at least two to three years to complete.  You need to realise that
computers are advancing rapidly and the base computer at the time of
release will probably be the mid range computer of today.  

Q: What are your plans for the future?

Paul: Play other peoples games for about six months, and then plan and
commence another project.  How does Uropa3D sound??

Stephen: The idea for Uropa3D has been around for quite some time. It
would be a Quake2 type game but with a Uropa2 theme to it, although it
would be more mission based. I have some plans for some hardware and
software that requires a lot of work, which I'm looking forward to.

Q: Do all Australians drink xxxx beer and call women Sheilas?

Paul: Well, I drink Sub-zeros and like to say "please don't hurt me
mistress".

Stephen: Calling women "sheilas" doesn't happen much anymore, except
perhaps, after consuming prodigious amounts of alcohol...

@{b}Hot Topic: Will you still support vulcan after there statement?@{ub}

From : aristides castiglioni <arisc@geocities.com>

hi guys!!! 
I'm an amiga user from mexico, i have just started to read your mag. and 
I think is great, congratulations for the great job that you have done.
Also I'm writting for al this vulcan thing, I really want to express my 
personnal opinion about all this mather.
after reading all that text from vulcan anybody could think that everything
is wrong with the amiga, and that they made the right decision, however. I
think that we should look at all the games of vulcan and ask this 
simple question:

do they have created a single game  which you
can say: "Wow! That is really a great game! It is well worth forking out 
my hard earned cash for something like this which will definately take full
advantage of my system."????? don't think so, it's not really bad to develope
for the p.c. after all it's true that the p.c. market is huge (and completly
attacked by pirates so it's not as safe as many guys think) but what i really
disliked was the way they talked about the amiga, saying that the only way 
to save her was with a huge 500+mhz monster with an 28X cd rom (something 
completly stupid) otherwise it was doomed, it doesn't make sense I mean they
where the ones who said that the amiga was great for it's flexibility right??? 
then why they are saying now that you need a mega monster at 29 pounds or 
else it's over??? I don't really think vulcan is the kind of company that 
should be complaining, i mean what kind of games they have created?? you know 
i did bought 3 of their games, and i don't think they were so amazing, the 
first titles where created with amos!!!! if I sold 3 copies of a game created 
with amos at 18.99 pounds I'll consider myself extreamly lucky!!!!! let's take 
a look a their titles:

valhalla 1 (I bought this one) it's a funny game, but it's soooo hard!!!! i
still don't know why a key appears for heating a piece of meat, let's face it 
it's not the kind of game that you want to buy. It looks like a licenseware 
title.
       
hillsea lido( I bought it too)  what about this one?? it's a theme park
clone!!! but it's not half good as theme park!!!! once again it looks more 
like licenseware than anything else.

tiny troops ( the last one i bought) it's nice and funny, but it has a
extrange look, it looks more like a pd game than a commercial one, anyway 
it's far better than the other titles. and what about jetpilot??? burn out 
for god !!!!!! that's one of the worst nice gfx crap games examples that 
i have ever seen!!!! I think that the only games i thought were great were 
final odyssey and genetic species (and they were programmed by other groups 
not vulcan) i don't really see why they are complaining about their financial 
problems, It's amazing that they have survived all this years with those 
games!!!! if they would have develope those games for the p.c. market I'm 
sure they would have died 3 years ago, if clickboom complained of something 
similar i wouldn't dare to say anything about it, I mean look at their 
games!!!! myst, capital punishment, quake. but vulcan!!!! and they want to 
make titles for playstation!!!! if they think that valhalla can be sold for 
the playstation i'll be a monkey head!!!! now, here is an important point, 
if they start making amazing games for the playstation then what we could 
think about vulcan???  what we need are games that really give playability 
and that takes advantages of our systems, I'm not asking for huge doom clones 
what I'm asking is for a title that really worths the money it costs, 
nothing else. And i believe that's the way we all amiga fans think. 

thank you very much for your atention.

aristides castiglioni.

Ed:

Thanks for your letter Aristides and i'm glad you enjoy our mag. I
agree with you on some points about there first games not being so good
but any company that starts out does not really end up making there
first games the best. I don't actually think they are going to release
Valhalla onto the playstation, what they are actually doing is expanding
there company to other platforms so it is 'safe' enough for them to
stay in business. They are not totally abandoning the Amiga just keeping
a float so they do not go bust or anything.

                               AIO LAYOUT CHANGE?
@{FG SHINE}____________________________________________________________________________@{FG TEXT}
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  AIO has been running for 11 months using the Amigaguide style layout
and the big question now is should we change? I am thinking of changing
the style to that of 'DiskMag Creator Gold' with a special aio executable
with a more coded feel to it. It is up to you, the readers... I would
like everyone who is reading this issue of AIO or any issue of AIO
to reply as it effects you. Two versions of AIO is not a choice!

Email me with one of the following statements :-

 "YES CHANGE NOW!"

OR

 "NO, KEEP AMIGAGUIDE" 

or anything along those lines as long as it's clear which one you want,
email :

@{b}COOL@DCANDY.DEMON.CO.UK@{UB}

or visit the NEW aio web page and mailto: me
