@{fg shine} Welcome@{fg text}

  Welcome back for yet another month of fun filled fun stuff!? One of
 the main changes this month is that the lines are 72 across or smaller
 this is due to a few complaints about words going off the screen and
 starting there own line. I havn't changed the menu size across so could
 you let me know if there is trouble with them. If anyone still has
 trouble with that then please do contact me and i'll do my best to sort
 it out. Another feature that may interest you is we have some screen
 shots of some of the games and utils. This issue we only put in 3 but
 were planning on putting in as many as possible, some games just won't
 capture but the ones that do we'll put them in. This months screenshots
 are of 6k PacMan, NSA-Patch and Autodiz. We've also got all the usual
 reviews of everything you want to download and everything you MUST 
 avoid. Well until next month, be happy!

 Exciting news and hopefully a juicy interview or two :) Well looks
 like another issue to look forwards to, so push away those Autumn

@{fg shine} 6k Pacman !?@{fg text}

  Another PacMan game it seems, we had one last month and now one this
 month. This one amazed me by only being 6k in size which is the
 smallest pacman game I have ever seen. As usual you guide the
 little yellow blob with a triangle mouth called pacman around the
 maze eating little yellow dots, it's not that simple as there are
 4 nasty ghosts which are out to get you. When you get in trouble
 there are power pills which you can eat which will make the ghosts
 scared and they will go blue and run away from you, if you catch
 up with them you can eat them which increases your score, the
 ghosts then go back to the square box in the middle of the
 screen and regenerate.
  Being such a small game I was supprised by the amount of features
 it inclueds which 'big brother' versions of pacman don't have in
 them.
  Overall this is just another pacman game but it does inclued some
 features that I have never seen before which make the game more
 interesting. If your limited for space or just want something to
 pass the time away then this game is definalty for you.

@{fg shine} Scissors, Paper, Stone@{fg text}

  SPS as most of you may have guessed is the old game of shaking your
 hand and comming out with either Scissors, Paper or Stone, this game
 is also known as Stone, Paper, Scissors in some countrys. The idea
 is to shake your hand behind your back and choose Stone, Paper or
 Scissors. Stone wins over Scissors, loses against Paper and draws with
 itself. Paper wins over Stone, loses to Scissors and draws with itself.
 Scissors wins over Paper, loses to Stone and draws with itself. The
 computer version is different because you don't get to pick what you
 want so your just given whatever the computer picks. I also couldn't
 read the menu because the font was in black and the background was in
 black so it was very hard to know what i'd done once i'd selected
 something from the menu.
  Overall this game (if you can call it that) has nice graphics but
 thats about it, it is friendly being in a WB window but there is
 nothing that makes you want to keep playing.

@node "gr3" "Shoot"

@{fg shine} Shoot@{fg text}

  Shoot is an overhead shooting game. The idea is to get to the
 building with the letters HQ on before you get shot. You are
 armed with a gun (which isn't very good) and you have to escape
 without getting shot. There are other buildings around you
 and every so often some men will come out and start shooting
 at you, you can take about 3 hits before dieing. It isn't hard
 to dodge the other peoples bullits but it is best to shoot some
 of the men that are after you. The levels are very big, I
 couldn't even manage to find the HQ on level one even though
 I searched everywhere. For people who can program in C this
 may also be useful as it comes complete with the game source
 code, so you can fiddle with bits to make it easier, or harder.
 The graphics aren't amazing and the sound isn't exactly good
 either but they do the job, even though the graphics and sound
 are poor the gameplay is great and you just can't stop playing
 once you've got into the game.
  Overall this is a good game but the graphics and sound let it
 down a bit, the gameplay and lastability are amazing, if you
 can get into this game then it is very addictive.

@node "gr4" "Jupiter Runner"

@{fg shine} Jupiter Runner@{fg text}

  Jupiter Runner is a maze game in which you are a ball searching for
 another ball in a top-down scrolling environment with a limited amount
 of time. Now for a major BAD POINT: It refused to run on my hard drive.
 Actually, I don't know if this is to do with my hard drive (as it is
 pretty buggered anyway) but it was a pain. So, I have to format a disk,
 give it a bootblock and call it `Infinty' of all things.
  OK, load it and a nice GUI comes up asking me if I want to play, edit
 a level or quit, so I chose play. After a title page that you can't get
 past immediately and a couple of pointless screens, it's time for the
 game... Which is actually quite fun... Until you have exhausted all the
 levels, which are sometimes quite badly designed, but at least you can
 make your own in the Level Editor (which is good if you can be bothered
 to learn how to use it as I did) but the problem is that you can't just
 load the game and have a level made up from random algorithms,
 determining the layout of the level, etc. etc.
  OK, I know I'm asking too much, but it's just a bit boring after about
 ten minutes, and the graphics are about as interesting as a chartered
 accountants company-issued blazer. It's just not really a very good
 idea unless you have just downloaded it and want a quick brain twist.
 It's not terrible, but just not terribly good either.

@node "gr5" "Dogfight"

@{fg shine} Dogfight@{fg text}

  No, not the same game that recently appeared on the CU Amiga coverdisk,
 this one is by an entirely different author, but the game is pretty
 similar.
  You and a friend and up to 4 other players can participate in a 
 Dogfight in which you have to make each other daisy chains.... Sorry,
 kill each other. Even though there have been many variations on the old
 Biplanes game, this is one of the best I have seen, though not quite as
 polished as the one on the CU Amiga Coverdisk.
  The plane flying (especially if you have been playing the CU game) is 
 a little awkward as there are less turning points, so it seems slightly
 jagged. It is annoying too if you are about to take off and you blow up
 (because another player is on the same runway) , and also that you
 can't drop bombs, but these are things that can be implemented in future
 versions.
  There are some nice samples to go with the game and a good option
 screen, allowing auto-take off on/off (something that should be in the
 other game) and a couple others to suit your preferences.
  The game takes place on one smallish screen with minimalistic back-
 grounds and simple (but perfectly sized) planes. There is one cloud
 for you to fly in that moves across the screen slowly, allowing unseen
 attacks. But enough of the graphics, where this game excels is with the
 four player option allowing you to involve your mates (but this is  bit 
 tight for space on the keyboard).
  Overall this is a good multi-player game, but hopefully in a new 
 version there is a one player option and.

           The quality of games this month wasn't that good, I was 
 impressed with 6k Pacman but it was such a small game it just
 didn't get into the Top Ten, it's getting harder and harder to get
 into the top ten these days but Dogfight managed to do it. As usual
 we see places 1 and 2 unchanged and have been unchanged since issue
 two!

@{fg shine} Games reviews and what there score means@{fg text}

  Games are reviewed mostly on playability and how long they will last
 you, although some big games with fancy graphics might be expected to
 get good reviews it is not always the case. A small 10k game might
 get a better overall score than a 1Mb game. It is not that the 1Mb
 game isn't any good it's just that the playablility might be non
 exsistant and there is no point in downloading a huge file if it
 will last a couple of minutes and you will only run it to show off
 to friends.

 90%+    -  AIO GOLD (amazing)

 70-89%  -  Nice but some let downs

 50-69%  -  Not to good but it'll do

 30-49%  -  Hasn't really been thought out to well

@{fg shine} AutoDiz V1.0@{fg text}

  AutoDiz is a little program which will extract the File_ID.DIZ from an
 archive and display it in a workbench window. The usage of Autodiz is
 very simple, either double click on the program and then type in the
 path and name of the archive or type in Autodiz and the name of the
 archive in the cli. It could also be set up as a button in a file
 manager like Dopus or Ro. This is only the first version but already
 it is very good, the window the File_ID.DIZ is shown in is very nice
 and even has a scroll bar for long File_ID.DIZs. At the moment it can
 support DMS, Lha, Lzx & Txt which are really the main archives, if
 you don't use them then maybe contact the author or use a good archiver.
 Overall this program is very quick and simple, it has a nice interface
 and does exacly what it says, a very good download if you ask me.

@{fg shine} DiskImage V2.0@{fg text}

  Diskimage is a small shell utility that takes a whole disk structure,
 and converts it into a single file ie. like DMS but without any
 compression. Well what's the point of that, you may ask. Well the
 resulting file can be compressed with ANY archiver, for example LHA or
 LZX, and this results in a far better compression ratio than DMS. The
 program can read from any disk drive ( DF0: to DF3: ), and write the
 resulting file anywhere you like, apart from the source disk. I tested 
 it with several disks, and found no problems, and after crunching there
 was a really good saving. LZX seemed to give the best results, but
 other specialist data, like samples for example, benefited from XPK
 compression. The programs simplicity though, is also its downfall, as
 it means that 2 seperate processes are needed to end up with a
 compressed file, but it does have the advantage that the user can use
 his or her fave cruncher! This also means that the correct suffix
 ( ie. .lha or .lzx ) does have to be used, otherwise how would people
 decrunch the file? The author IS promising future updates which will
 include a crunch option, and hopefully this will considerably enhance
 the product.
  So then, a good idea that could be a great idea with a little more
 work!

@{fg shine} Med2XM@{fg text}

  Med2XM is a simple shell based utility to convert Octamed and/or
 Octamed Soundstudio modules to mainly PC based XM nodule format.
 It's a very simple utility that just requires the filename of the mod 
 to be converted, and the filename to be converted and output. It's very
 quick 'n' easy, and if you need to convert mods from one format to the
 other, this is easily the quickest way! Life's not that easy though,
 and there are a few limitations. For example, synthetic and/or hybrid
 instruments aren't converted, nor is panning information. Whilst a bit
 of a bind, these can easily be edited on the PC using Fasttracker II or
 Impulse Tracker, but without the editing, the modules tend to sound a
 little 'flat'. Also, whilst testing this utility out, a few bugs
 appeared, which resulted in several mods being slightly corrupt,
 although again, this was easily fixed.
  Overall then, a quick and simple way of converting mods, which with a
 bit of updating, could be excellent!

@node "ur4" "RO V1.26"

@{fg shine} RO V1.26@{fg text}

  Everyone who uses their Amiga's seriously must have at least one file
 manager in their collection, for example, Directory Opus in all it's
 different incarnations. Whilst Workbench is great at some aspects of
 file management, there are sometimes quicker and easier methods. So
 along comes RO to try and make your life easier. RO takes the old
 'source and destination' approach to life, a bit like the old Directory
 Opus V4. This makes life easy, and at a glance you can see what's going
 on. Unlike most other file managers though, RO uses MUI, which means
 that a font sensitive, resizeable GUI is used, and lucky power users can
 retarget everything onto a GFX card if necessary. If you don't know
 about MUI ( do you live on earth? ), then suffice to say, you haven't
 experienced nice Amiga GUI's. Life is made easy for the user, and the
 programmer by MUI and loads of applications have jumped at the chance to
 make AmigaDOS an easier place to navigate through. Unfortunately, MUI
 can be a memory hogging set of routines, and I would say that an A1200
 would be the bare minimum that would run RO nicely! RO requires version
 3.6+ of MUI and that alone needs about 3 meg of hard drive space, so the
 system requirements are fairly high to start with, but heh!, hard drives
 are so cheap these days that I wouldn't imagine any serious users would
 be unable to spare a bit of space to try this out. With my large amounts
 of hard drive space ( 4.4 gigs! ), I was looking forward to using RO.
 There are several really nice functions available, like all the normal
 buttons and sliders, but unfortunately a few oversights. For example,
 there is no 'parent' button in the default config. This is a real pain,
 and at the moment, I find myself going back to my regular file manager
 just for this function. On the plus side however, it's very easy to find
 the required devices, as these have a page to themselves and this is
 worth it's weight in gold!
  Overall I liked RO, but unfortunately, I've spent many hours messing
 with the config of my favourite file manager. I'm sure that after a
 while, RO could do ALL the things I take for granted with my current
 utility, but I'd have to spend some time to get it there! RO is a
 shareware product, and so there is a fee to register, which will remove
 the nag requester and also let you save your prefs out. The shareware
 fee is currently 30 DM or 20 US$, which compared to the commercial
 offerings is good value. Unfortunately there are several uncrippled
 products to rival RO. I suggest though, that you take a look at this
 utility and make your own mind up.

  In Issue 2 of AIO we reviewed an old version of NSA-Patch, well it
 seems that a new version of this amazing program has been released so
 we couldn't pass up the chance to review the new version as it was
 so good last time.
  For you that didn't catch issue 2 NSA-Patch is used to speed up any
 excutable program by replacing old/slow math commands with new uptodate
 faster ones. I've tested this program out on loads of things on my HD
 and it hasn't damaged a thing. This new version will make things now go
 upto 6 times faster than they are meant to. Not everything will work
 as the routines are so fast so some programs won't change but the ones
 it does change are definatly worth running the program on.
  Overall this program is just so good, I didn't have any trouble with
 it and for all that it deserves an AIO gold.

@{fg shine} MyFormat V1.20@{fg text}
 
  Myformat is a new replacement command for the standard Amiga format
 command. It sits in the sys:system directory and is a complete
 replacement, thus meaning the Workbench "format disk" menu item will
 use myformat instead of the format command, if needed. Its advantages
 are that it has a nice GUI, it will allow you to change format type ie.
 FFS/OFS, directory caching etc. from the GUI, and it shows the approx.
 size the disk will have, once formatted. Also, for hard drive users,
 there is a facility to mark the "bad blocks" on the hard drive, which
 saves lots of heartache in the future. Other options include verify
 on/off, autostart, verify etc. Being only 16k long, it can just be
 forgotten once installed, which is it's main advantage. Think of it
 bringing the format command into the 90's!
  Overall, a small and simple, but nice format replacement. The main
 problem though is it's hardly groundbreaking.

  Utils are not marked on how good they are compared to other utils,
 they are marked by usefulness and what purpose they serve. As there
 are so many different utils that do so many different things it is
 hard to review something like MUI and then when reviewing a program
 like a WB clock say it wasn't up to the standard of MUI. This is why
 it is not possible to have a Top Ten list for utils.

 FTAO : Digitiser@Teletext

 Sir/Madam,

 I write to complain bitterly about the violent attack on Amiga owners
 recently in Digitiser.

 I have been an Amiga owner for many years, and I am deeply insulted by
 the malicious and untrue assertions made in that publication.

 On page 171, Stuart Campbell writes :

 "The survey revealed via AF and CU Amiga, the perhaps not at all
 surprising fact that almost 68% of all Amiga owners have never had a
 girlfriend. Ever."

 After pointing out that Amiga means "Girlfriend" in Spanish, he then
 goes on to say :

 "One can only imagine that the original management of Commodore were
 playing a funny practical joke on all the people who would buy their
 computer. So little change there, then."

 This is outrageous. Even if the survey results are not, as I suspect,
 "cooked" to make some kind of frivolous point, I take great exception
 to the suggestion that I have been "ripped-off" by buying my Amiga.
 On the contrary. Having used all manner of systems, from UNIX/VAX
 workstations to Sinclair ZX80's and everything in between, I can say
 with some certainty ( based on many years experience ) that no other
 computer system even comes close to the ease and power of the Amiga.

 And yes, I have had PLENTY of girlfriends, and none of them were made
 in a factory !

 On page 175, an unknown author writes in "GameSpotting" :

 GAMER TYPE 5 : AMIGA OWNER

 "He buys shareware because that's practically all there is to play on
 his Amiga, he writes his own programs, though they're rarely anything
 more interesting than a Spreadsheet, and he's possibly the most tedious,
 anally retentive individual on earth."

 "He so wants you to believe that the Amiga is a viable gaming platform."

 "A cliche, yes, but unfortunately, this archetypal computer nerd really
 does exist. We know this for definite."

 An Amiga owner's only friends are members of his coding club, and
 there's nothing he enjoys more than a 24 hour coding marathon."

 "Locked away in his bedroom for days on end, his pale complexion, poor
 eyesight and unkempt appearance are clues to the average Amiga owner."

 "He thinks multi-tasking is somehow a substitute for a catalogue of
 cutting-edge games. Did we mention he lacks a sense of irony ? Typical
 quote : 'Yes, but the PC can't multitask.'"

 To tackle these points one at a time :

 (1) ... I don't have any shareware games. All my games are commercial,
         and there are PLENTY of them I can assure you. Not to mention
         games on the horizon which will make use of the PowerPC
         architecture and it's associated hardware.

 (2) ... Yes I write my own programs because, unlike PC owners, I have
         the intelligence to do so. That is, after all the whole POINT
         of buying a computer. There are much cheaper ways of pursuing
         the childish activity of playing games.

 (3) ... If the author takes a look at Aminet now and then, he will see
         that Spreadsheets account for a microscopic fraction of the
         sowftware in the archive.

 (4) ... Tedious ? News to me ! Also news to the dozens of party goers
         who invariable come round my house every other night.

 (5) ... Anally Retentive ? No I am not the kind of person who becomes
         incensed if everything is not in it's place / as it should be.
         If anything, I would describe my life as 'utter chaos' at the
         moment.

 (6) ... The Amiga is, has been, and will continue to be a considerably
         MORE VIABLE gaming platform than the PC. The PC is, after all,
         fundamentally based on a prehistoric hardware/software
         architecture originally designed for "anal-retentives" to run
         their spreadsheets on.

 (7) ... I am neither a Cliche, nor a Nerd. I am a 29 year old offshore
         worker who has been known to physically dismember people for
         saying less insulting things to me than the authors in Digitiser

 (8) ... I am not in a coding club as such, but if I were, I would be
         proud to count its members among my friends. At least they are
         the type of people who actually USE their computers once they
         buy them, unlike the majority of PC owners that I know - who
         simply buy a PC for the prestige; don't have a clue what to
         do with it; let it sit in the box for a month before unpacking
         it; unpack it then spend the best part of a year trying to get
         it to work properly; give up and eventually just let it sit in
         the spare room as a 'showpiece' statement that says ... 'look
         I'm clever enough to spend two grand on something useless.'

 (9) ... There's only two things I do in my bedroom, and neither of them
         has anything to do with the computer. Isn't it typical of a
         PC owner to associate his PC with the bedroom. Symptomatic of
         all those hours on www.pornbyus.com or www.xtc.com.
         My complexion is not pale nor am I unkempt, in fact I spend a
         small fortune on clothes. You must be confusing me with PC
         owners who, having blown all their money on something that looks
         like an air conditioning unit ( and serves as much use ) they
         have no money left for 'luxuries' like clothes. And you have
         the audacity to call Amiga users 'nerds'.

 (10) .. The Amiga multi-tasks properly. The PC doesn't. Period. There
         isn't really much more to say. As for us believing that the
         Amiga's ability to pre-emtively multitask easily is a
         substitute for 'cutting-edge' games, I've never heard such
         rubbish. The Amiga invented the concept of 'cutting-edge games',
         and now the best the PC can do is come up with some raytraced
         animations ( which were probably done on SGI's not PC's ) and
         slap them together and call it a game. Crap. At least Amiga
         games are fun, and will in the near future provide the same
         level of mindless '3D-ness' that every technophobic, first-time
         -buying, lame PC owner seems to want these days.

 (11) .. I do have a sense of irony, otherwise I wouldn't be able to
         appreciate the fact that even though the Amiga has always been
         fundamentally superior to the PC it has been largely ignored by
         the large corporations due to dubious backhander operations -
         ( mainly involving Intel and Microsoft ) - and the subsequent
         ( and equally dubious ) marketing decisions by those same
         corporations. This resulted in the Amiga being left at the
         bottom end of the market and eventually slipping away on ....
         I've lost count .... is it 3 occasions now ? only to rise like
         a Phoenix on each occasion.

 I think the comments made on Digitiser p175 on Sunday the 10th of August
 1997 were libelous, inflammatory, and deeply insulting, and I intend
 taking further action with the ITC.

 The following is a list of names, ( with optional comments ), collected
 from various Amiga enthusiast around the world, who have all read this
 letter, and feel as strongly as I do.

@{fg shine} New versions head-to-head@{fg text}

  Since issue 3 new versions of both gameboy emulators have been
 released. We've taken both new versions and put them to the test 
 again to see which one has pulled off the stunts and come on top.

  @{b}WzonkaladV0.80@{ub} - Wzonkalad has been greatly improved
 since the last release we tested especially in speed it is now
 over double the speed it was last time. Although the speed is
 still not as fast as I would of liked it to be at least it is now
 a playable speed. Another major feature is the option for sound
 although you have to register to get the sound. Wzonkalad has the
 feature of saving the ROM so you don't have to start again every
 time you die or lose a life. For running games it is very reliable
 most of them actually work including some big ones like Mario2,
 Earth Worm Jim and Zelda. There were only a few games like James
 Pond and Donkey Kong Land that failed to run but over all it was
 very good. Wzonkalad V0.80 defiantly gets the thumbs up for new
 features and speed improvements.

  @{b}AmiGameBoy0.85ß@{ub} - AmiGameBoy is still very fast which
 gives it a lot of points, it's no good having something that looks
 good if it is unplayable. Although this is a new version I couldn't
 find many new features but i'm sure there in there somewhere. This
 is the last free version as from the next version (0.9) it will be
 time limited. AmiGameBoy works with most games but big cartridge
 files seem to disagree totally as Donkey Kong Land, Zelda and Mario2
 failed to work. AmiGameBoy does come with sound for free so you
 don't have to register for it like with Wzonkalad. The layout is
 actually better and more friendly than Wzonkalad but this is down
 to the actual person who is using it and not everyones choice.

  @{b}Overall@{ub} - I actually like AmiGameBoy better for the
 friendlyness and speed of it but by the next version of Wzonkalad it
 will be so hard to judge as Wzonkalad is so much better now. Wzonkalad
 has the good feature of save game and more games seem to work with
 it but my preference still stays with AmiGameBoy for the speed.

@{fg shine} More views from Australia@{fg text}

  As can be clearly seen, there's been a dearth of news in the Amiga 
 World at the moment. The same can be said Down Under, although you 
 may already have heard reports that An Australian Amiga Gathering MK2
 (AAG MK2) is just around the corner. Details are scant at the moment,
 but more up to date news regarding who will be present this time around
 can be found at:  www.unicorn.com.au/aag.html. All that is known at the
 moment is that it will be held in Melbourne this time around at Albert
 Park on the 11th of October 1997.  Unlike the last show however, this
 will be a one day event only. 

  It's hard to say whether this lack of news is good or not. On the one 
 hand, it means that nobody goes overboard on the rumour-mill, purely 
 because there is a lack of any information to speculate on.  The other
 side of the coin however, is that people are more likely to be 
 disillusioned.  The whole Amiga scene is one of sitting down and 
 waiting. Even Phase5 are late shipping their PowerPC boards.  So we're 
 waiting for those too.

  Admittedly there have been a few licencing deals worked out by Amiga 
 International, but such licences concern current, and to be honest, 
 outdated technology. AGA is now old hat, and users are really looking 
 to the next generation of machines, an issue which has yet to be 
 addressed adequately unfortunately.  We have however, been blessed with 
 a wonderful Operating System.  It is this combination of the flexible 
 AmigaOS and that of shareware coders (I salute you all, and for those 
 who don't register, please do) which has kept our hopes alive.  It is 
 thanks to them that we have not fallen further behind.  Internet 
 software being a case in point.  

  Thus old hardware does not become useless hardware.  I still stand by 
 the fact that we can do pretty much anything that PC's can do, if a 
 little slower.  It will be interesting to see whether Phase5 manage to 
 bring out their PowerPC accelerators in September, seeing as they'd had 
 a projected product shipment date last month, and perhaps even the month 
 before!  Still, if Phase5's history is anything to go by, they'll 
 deliver the goods, if a little later than planned.  And therein lies our
 hope, that Amiga International and Gateway2000 have something concrete
 up their sleeves. That they have a solid plan which is slowly taking 
 shape, but requiring time to put all the pieces together.
  
  So we're still waiting, despite all the euphoria that surrounded the 
 buyout. As the saying goes however, "No news is good news." And you have
 to admit, there's really been no bad news either!  :)

 From  :  Craig Munro (craigm@choice.southern.co.nz)

 Hello.

 Just a quick question regarding the Utility NSA-Patch reviewed in 
 issue 2 of AIO.  Where on Aminet is it located?  I've tried doing a
 search for "NSA Patch", etc. but nothing returns with the file I want.

 If you want or can, would you be able to e-mail it to me?

 Thanks for your help,


 Thanks for your letters, you will be pleased to know that the new 
 version has been uploaded to the Aminet but last time it was deleted
 for no reason. Anymore problems getting hold of it contact Niki 
 Murkett via email at - nsa_design@geocities.com
