 Hello and welcome to another issue of AIO, issue 16 is a great issue
bursting with all the usual reviews, news and articles you've come to
expect from us. Some of the highlights this issue are an interview with
the programmer of The Shadow of Time, a new point and click adventure
soon to be released by Epic Marketing, well the start of 1999 anyway.
Domination diary part 2, the second part to a new space stratagy game
we featured a few issues ago. An article on MPEGs, the amiga and loads
of quality reviews and juicy news storys.

 The best thing about this month was the opening of the JUST-AMiGA 
mailing list started by me for AIO readers and ALL amiga users to come
together and talk about absolutely anything amiga related. Details of
how to join can be found in the @{"news" link "news" } area of the mag.

 This month we see the AIO email address change and the address of the
web page change slightly, firstly the new AIO email address is :
@{b}amiga@thefree.net@{ub} - don't worry if you have just posted to the old
address as that is now re-directed to my new address, this new address
insures a quicker response. The web page address is practically the same
but has changed slightly to allow the page to offer more options namely
counter, online reading of the latest issue, online registration plus
the usual download all issues etc. You can now find us at :
@{B}www.amiga1.demon.co.uk/aio/index.htm@{ub} - The counter so far is over 200 
visitors and the counter has only been open about 2 weeks, so i'm quite 
pleased, make sure you visit soon!

 Well thats it for this month, I hope you will join me on the JUST-AMiGA
mailing list and if you have any comments, reviews, news, letter, adverts
or anything else please do not hessitate to contact us.

 The PC c&c style game titled just 'Z' will now be coming to the Amiga

but after a while they decided they wouldn't beable to make the Amiga
version good enough for release so clickBOOM are now finishing the
project. The bitmap brothers had the success of Speedball 1 and 2,
Chaos Engine and Gods on the Amiga with Chaos Engine 2 being there
last release.

PRESS RELEASE

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 20th 1998

The Amiga RC5 Team effort has entered its second year of existence and
we can proudly look back on the accomplishments of the first. In many
ways the Amiga is experiencing a rebirth, and the first candle is lit
again.

Over the course of the years as mainstream computing has evolved from
diversity in the eighties to Wintel dominance in the nineties, the
general public is more inclined to see only the 'advances' Wintel made,
where alternative platforms like the Amiga seemingly underwent no change
or completely dwindled from the public eye. But the Amiga did change and
adapt, if not commercially, then by its definition of what Amiga is. At
first it was the technologically advanced synergy of hard- and software,
then the OS, to what we now regard as Amiga: the community, the spirit,
a lifestyle even. And into the future, the promise of a once again far
advanced OS and return of an open platform, being defined as we speak.

The Amiga RC5 Team effort quickly grew from a handful of participants to
what seems a major force on the frontiers of distributed computing, a
convergence between what some might regard as old and new technologies.

We continue to prove to the world that the Amiga is in some ways more
alive by the day and that enthousiasm weighs up against other factors,
while we soon hope to prove it in other ways than this effort has as
well.

In this last year we competed in four RSA Labs/Distributed Net
challenges, coming out ranking in the top 10 out of thousands of teams
in three of these, beating other illustrious participants such as IBM,
Hewlett Packard, Siemens Nixdorf, NetScape, Oracle and a host of others,
too many to mention, except maybe for the Win32/Windows team :)

With over 1200 members (and over 2200 computers) of which over half
consist of Amigas in the current RC5-64 challenge we have come as close
to the top as a number three daily ranking, while still growing steadily
as more people join and more PowerPC equipped Amigas fill our ranks.

Once again we call to arms, join the effort now and propel the Amiga
back into the limelight to pave the way for its comeback, possibly
winning part of the US $10,000 award for finding the right key in the
RC5-64 challenge or one of the upcoming DES II challenges. For full
details on what RC5/DES, RSA Labs and Distributed Net are and how we fit
into all this, see the Amiga RC5 Team effort homepage listed below.

We must thank all participants for this past year's effort, all
companies and magazines who supported us and continue to do so, and of
course the developers contributing amongst which foremostly Stefan
'Blast' Smietanowski and Christopher A. Wichura who brought us the
various Amiga clients.

The Amiga RC5 Team effort is also providing a mailinglist as a forum for
the discussion on above topics and the effort in general.

For additional info on how to participate and more in depth explanation,

Amiga RC5 Team effort coordinator

 It has now been confirmed that there will be a UK World Of Amiga show in
1999! Work is well underway on the 1999 show, although the date and venue
has yet to be confirmed. There is already a great deal of excitement for
the show which will play a major part in the rejuvenation of the Amiga
during 1999. As Peter Brameld, Organiser of the World Of Amiga show
stated, "We MUST take the Amiga into the Millenium".

@{fg shine} WolfPAC@{fg text}

 WolfPAC instantly suggests to me that this is going to be a Wolfenstein
pacman game, for those of you who are two young to remember wolfenstein
it was the Doom game before Doom, which was also written by ID soft. So
you think, great pacman in the 3D style but then you play the game and
find out if you don't have a 060 then the game is snail slow.

 I was quite looking forwards to playing this as it adds a twist to
the current pacman clones floating about but as my 030/50Mhz and 8mb
of ram won't cope with it I was pretty stuck and couldn't get to grips
with it. The graphics are okish but for these graphics you would
expect a bit more speed, I have got doom running faster on my config
in full screen than I did this in smallest, I think it has been badly
programmed as the graphics aren't that outstanding that the game needs to
be dog slow.

 The game looks quite playable and I am only putting it down as its
really unplayable to most people, a good thing is you do get a PPC
version aswell to play with. If you have a PPC or 060 and would like
to review this get in touch with me and maybe you can say this game
is any good.

@node "gr2" "Slither"

@{fg shine} Slither - snake game@{fg text}

 Slither is yet another conversion of the orginal game titled Snake,
there have been plenty of these made already and here is yet another
one to tickle our tastebuds as a certain computer game tv program
presenter would say (prizes for the first to guess who it is :) )

 The idea of slither, as if you didn't already know is to eat the
blobs to get bigger and so to proceed to the next level. With slither
it is slightly different and you for some strange reason have to eat
coins, I mean when was the last time you heard of a snake that could
eat coins?!? Anyway thats the idea and thats what you've got to do
although i'm sure if a snake really eat coins it'd choke and die ;)

 Maybe it is just me being slightly bored of snake conversions after
playing at least 1000+ in my lifetime but slither isn't a very good
version of Snake. The background is a nice digitised picture of a
snake but this really distracts you from the game and can sometimes
put you off, come on if you had a snake looking at you all day wouldn't
you be a bit put off?... well maybe not but i was! The music is good
but thats about it, the snake is poorly drawn and is just a green
shape with a wiggly line down the middle and two black eyes. The game
is to hard to play and you can never seem to eat the coins. Overall
this has got 57 levels and its only a demo but after about the first
I gave in.

 Overall i'd say miss this one out, if your a snake addict get hold
of it but other than that don't waste your money.

@{fg shine} The Lost Island@{fg text}

 Boy, haven't the Engine 9 Design team been busy recently, two games
and a util all in one issue! Well enough of that and on with the
review. The idea of TLI is that you have to escape from the maze/island
to proceed to the next maze/island, as the story goes you have been
trapped on various islands by Mr Psycho who has given you a time limit
to get off them before you die. The view is sort of an isomentric
view but not exactly, you move your player about which is quite well
drawn trying to find the purple square to escape, you can only move
on the grey and brown squares with the green being grass or something
and there is also water and some red stuff.

 For each level you have a timer which goes down while you rush around
franticly trying to excape from your doom. I didn't seem to be to
successful as I couldn't even manage to get off the first level and 
became dissolutioned and disorientated after a while when every place
I went looked the same, grey blocks everywhere, was i going mad? Well
obviously not and after a while i made the man dance to the music
by moving left and right.... hmm maybe the game made me a little mad.

 Overall a great little game, if you can't find the exit you'll probably
go mad like me and become extremely annoyed but if you do you'll be
a happy chappy. Get it, its good!

@node "gr4" "Snake game by NC.Gamez"

@{fg shine} Snake game by NC.Gamez@{fg text}

 The second snake game reviewed this month is SnakeFW from NC.gamez
The idea of snake is to eat the dots, in this game they are numbers
starting from 1 going up to 9 and then it's onto the next level. Eat
a number and your score jumps up but then it starts declining in 1's
until your score is empty, so the idea is eat more before your score
hits zero.

 Your points are past on to the next level but will still go down until
you have none left so it is up to you to eat the next number as quick
as you can to get the highest score. The more levels you pass the harder
they get with walls and other things placed on your way, I only managed
to get to level 3 without dieing.

 This game is quite addictive considering its only a basic snake game,
its simple but it will keep you entertained, the graphics may not be
much but they do the job and the excellent sound will keep you going for
hours.

@{fg shine} Simple Pacman V1.1@{fg text}

 We all love pacman, I love pacman, you love pacman, everyone loves
pacman. Its just a game you can't get enough of. Its a simple idea
and one that has been run over many times so I won't go into much
detail, basically you are a circle with a mouth and you have to eat
all the dots without getting caught by the ghoasts. There are powerpills
to collect which make the ghoasts scared and allow you to eat them
for a certain lenght of time before they change back.

 Simple Pacman is a great workbench version of this retro game. You
have two windows, one is the main playing area and the other is the
hiscores. You can close the hiscore window if you choose to. The window
can be resized to any size you wish, it is very flexible and will be
redrawn almost instantly.

 This is a great addictive game to play while doing something that
requires the workbench to be active like copying disks or something
else of that nature. A nice game that is well worth a look!

@{fg shine} FULL solution to Archer@{fg text}

 Something a bit different this month being a solution to a PD game
which is also reviewed this month. This solution can also be found
on the aminet game/hint arcsol.txt but is to be used only in AIO.

 Start off in the screen 'Statue of your hero', you will see a statue
the same as yourself, all in green but bigger, on top of your statue
there is an enemy, go to the tree on your right and climb to the height
of the enemy and shoot, make sure you hit him first, as soon as he
is dead his arrow will disappear so don't worry about dodging that. Get
out of the tree and head left, once you are in the second screen climb
up the ladder which will be just infront of you and shoot the enemy
at the top of the brown thing. Then press the left Amiga key and you
will be transported to the black object on top of a brown square thing,
this is meant to be a bolder (so the author says ;) ) shoot it and
the two enemys will die, the 'magic' bolder that doesn't move, roles
on them apparently ;) although I think it was more that the author
couldn't program the bolder to move (hello author!!) Then go into the
next screen going left, you will see an enemy accross the gap and
a ladder going down, go down the ladder and keep going left until you
are in the next screen, then drop down and stay still. As soon as
an arrow has fired past go left slightly until you drop a little
bit and then shoot, you will kill the enemy and his arrow won't
harm you! This is probably the hardest part of the game so make sure
you get it right. Once he is dead proceed left and drop down, once
you have dropped go right (it doesn't matter about the red stuff
it doesn't kill you) and go down a ladder, then keep going right 
through two empty screens, the screen with the steps is the screen
before the enemy... go through and shoot stright away. Then goto
the wizard and he will transport you to the castle. At the castle
doors press down or the cursor down key. Inside the castle go left
and up the ladder, shoot the enemy and go right to the top then
pull right comming off the ladder, get close to the enemy and
shoot him, then turn around and shoot him again, and then go left
and shoot him again, keep going left and shooting him until he
gets to the left edge of the screen, shoot him once more and he
will die, the game is now complete and your castle is turned back
into a castle from straw. Thats all folks!!!

@{fg shine} Games reviews and what there score means@{fg text}

 Games are reviewed mostly on playability and how long they will last
you, although some big games with fancy graphics might be expected to
get good reviews it is not always the case. A small 10k game might
get a better overall score than a 1Mb game. It is not that the 1Mb
game isn't any good it's just that the playablility might be non
exsistant and there is no point in downloading a huge file if it
will last a couple of minutes and you will only run it to show off
to friends.

 90%+    -  AIO GOLD (amazing)

 70-89%  -  Nice but some let downs

 50-69%  -  Not to good but it'll do

 30-49%  -  Hasn't really been thought out to well

@{fg shine} File id extractor Deluxe@{fg text}

 Ah what a GODSEND this thing is, I cannot imagine what life would 
be like without it.

 File id ex is basically a program that will let you create a text file
containing all the file id's from whatever dir/file you selected.

 Now if your like me you'll have a download dir as full as a very full
thing! And (like me) you NEVER clean it out..... SO what the hell do you
do when you know a file you want is in there but ya just cant find it..?

Create a nice dir list (just like u see on a bbs).

 The program itself is simple enough to use, Just scan [YOUR DIR] then
create the file list. It will then trawl thru the files for any file id's
and save em to a text file.

 Once done it will ask if you wanna clear the filelist and also tell 
you if it couldn't find any diz's. 

 You can sort the files by Name or Date and also include seperators 
to make the resulting file list's easier to read and wildcards are 
included.

 File id extractor supports lha/lzx/zip/txt files and in my 
oppinion it's a MUST have for lazy/untidy (u know who u r) people ;)
Its Nice/Useful/user friendly, What MORE d'YA want!

 Thing about music modules is that it just ain't practical to open up  
octamed to play med/tracker tunes and then digibooster to listen 
to some more of ya music colly ;( and thats where hippoplayer 
comes in.

 Now there are some other mod players about like deli-tracker which
is a VERY good mod player but  i found it to be cumbersome and 
memory intensive. 

 HiPPO player features a small but perfectly formed frontend which
i have sitting in the corner of my workbench permanently.
 One of hippo's finest features is the hipposcope, it can be changed
into all manner of weird scopes n bars, Even a four channel mini
tracker screen so you can see the mod play before your eye's.

 The buttons are of the usual kind ... play,stop,fwd,eject etc etc 
there are also a good little prefs menu letting you change all manner
of things such as random play , hippos display ,playing, and all the 
startup options. Support for PS3M and ahi is there too.

 I find the best use to be for anyone who spends more than 5 mins at a time
on there 'puter sYSOPS , nET nUTS , lAMERS and even gAMERS , just select 
all ya favorite mods using {add} and save themout to a program ( playlist
to you and me ;) using ya rMB on {prg} and let the aural feast commence!
and if ya get bored with the current mod just rmb on the play button to
randomly select a tune. And it plays med, tracker, xm, and digibooster
mods and probably a few different formats i cant lay my hands on at the mo.

final comment :- u wanna play mods on ya workbench.? gET HIPPOPLAYER.

@{fg shine} EPlayer@{fg text}

 Eplayer... basicly is a mod or med player. Well that means it'll
play any mod and Protracker, Noisetracker and Soundtracker accourding
to the documents, don't shoot me if some don't work but it all
went nicely for me. The interface is very nice although an iconify
button is missing, you can hide it but it would have been nice to
see an iconify button, maybe in the next version ay lads?!

 Play, stop, pause, hide and copy, yes they are all there, but whats
this copy you are asking? it copys your mod to another destination,
don't even ask me why this is included because I can't really tell
you but it maybe helpful...to...erm....a madman!?!? Yes it does
have a timer aswell, would it be a music player without one?

 The feature i most enjoyed which is a rare feature in most music
players is if you have an lha or lzx archive and you can't be bothered
unarc'ing them the music player will do it for you and then automatically
play the music it finds inside, cool or what eh??? There is even a
little volume bar which can higher or lower the volume duh!

 At 40k this music player is a steal, it has some great little features 
especially the auto dearch feature. Maybe in future versions we could
see an iconify button, MUI support and even a couple more music filetypes
like XM etc.

@node "ur4" "MiniCD"

@{fg shine} Mini CD Player V1.2@{fg text}

 Another music player this month following the earlier two but this one 
is for Audio CD's and not modules like the previous reviews.  Being able 
to play Audio CD's while using your Amiga is something that everyone 
should beable to do and it should be accessable to everyone, with a CD-Rom 
that is.

 There are already a few good Audio Cd players around at the moment but 
they all give fancy options, are big and clog up space on the screen 
which can become annoying and irritating. MiniCD V1.2 solves this problem 
by having the smallest CD interface todate, it sits right in your top right 
hand corner just before the multitask wb button, yes you did hear correctly, 
it sits on the very top most white bar. There is no border round it, just a 
few tiny buttons to be clicked on. Play, stop, pause, eject and a timer 
and track number gauge. When you eject a CD the buttons will disappear 
until you re-insert a new one. Considering the buttons are so tiny the 
main program is quite big for a CD player at 57k. When you think that 
PlayCD is only a mere 17k and has a great interface with the MUI CD player 
just a little bigger than MiniCD at 62k. So saying that MiniCD is small 
in screen space it is big in executable size.

 Overall if your looking for something that can tuck away under the rug/mat 
so to speak this maybe what you've been searching for, I found it a bit to 
small rather like I was going to break it if i pressed to hard!

@{fg shine} Virus Z Pre III V1.44@{fg text}

 VirusZ is a long running virus checker for the Amiga and has now become
one of the best available for the Amiga today along with Virus Checker.
Although there are not as many viruses being made on the Amiga now due
to the smaller userbase its always best to be protected, you never know
when an old virus could pop up or another new one is written. 

 It is always good to see the release of a new virus killer as you know
your computer can't be harmed by any new viruses namely the new ones
being the Happy New Year viruses that spring up each year causing havok
to alot of people, luckly VirusZ has been keeping tabs on the yearly
virus and will now kill the versions from 96 to 98 and probably 99 when
the year comes.

 The new features are as follows :

Changes/Additions since 1.43:
	- Added XVS version string to about request just like in VZ III.
	  Debugging is easier that way, idea by Jan Andersen.
	- Changed status to FREEWARE for the near future.

 A nice thing to see is the status FREEWARE on VirusZ, its good to know
that the programmers of the Amiga are offering something free and i'm
glad its a top notch virus checker like this one.

 A program no one can do without, everyone should get hold of this right
this instant, remember to download it from the official web page stated
below to be sure of real versions.

@{fg shine} Utils reviews and what there score means@{fg text}

 Utils are not marked on how good they are compared to other utils,
they are marked by usefulness and what purpose they serve. As there
are so many different utils that do so many different things it is
hard to review something like MUI and then when reviewing a program
like a WB clock say it wasn't up to the standard of MUI. This is why
it is not possible to have a Top Ten list for utils.

 90%+    -  AIO GOLD (amazing)

 70-89%  -  Great but lacking some features

 50-69%  -  Not to good but it'll do

 30-49%  -  Hasn't really been thought out to well

 0-29%   -  POOR! AVOID!

@node "fe1" "New Amiga"

@{fg shine} Points about new Amigas@{fg text}

 Since May 1998 I have been reading many letters to the CuAmiga and
Amiga Format and heard countless amounts of people moaning that
Amiga Inc are making the new Amiga solely based upon PC hardware
even though Amiga Inc did not say this. It seems to me most people
heard that the bridge system would be based on PC hardware and then
completely ignored what was announced after that.

 Lets get it straight that it is only the bridge system that will be
using PC hardware and the main reason for this is so the new Amiga
will be released with an existing software base giving people more
incentive to buy the new Amigas. If they released a new Amiga onto
the public without and software for it it would fail instantly,
look at the way the Sega Saturn went and the way the N64 is going
with hardly any software support but the Sony Playstation with 300+
games is doing great business and sales are booming. How can software
companies produce high quality software on our existing Amigas to be
used with a high powered Amiga? that would be stupid and the quality
of the software would only beable to match that of an 060 'Classic'
Amiga as that is the highest standard they will be able to go upto.
You have to get it into your head that the PC at current has the
better hardware in the fact that it is the most powerful and can
handle things quicker. So give software houses a fast PC as a bridge
system and they can make better utilities and games up to the standard
of the best PC system so when the new Amiga comes out they can then
push up the standards again with the PC beating technology and the users
will be happy with there current software base and then again in a few
months be suprised when they see the top standard of the new Amigas.

 I hope I have made this more clear to alot of users who seemed to think
that Amiga Inc where taking a PC and slapping Amiga on the front and
then selling it. The bridge system won't be that readily available
to most of the public so it won't effect us anyway really, it will
just allow better software for the new Amigas.

@node "fe2" "Dis/Advantages of MPeg"

@{fg shine} Disadvantages and Advantages of MPeg@{fg text}

 MPeg has recently hit the amiga in a big way, up until a few years ago
things that where just not possible are now possible thanks to a few
dedicated programmers and Amiga believers.

 There are two different types of mpeg that you can use on the amiga,
the first is video mpeg and the second is music mpegs. Firstly we
will take a look at video mpeg. Video mpeg is many pictures compacted
together in a way so it is small enough to show short clips of film.
Although i say small a 300 picture piece lasting for about 20 seconds
can take up well over a meg of space... with todays big HD sizes you
may think that a meg isn't that much space but when you think of the
length the actual film is going to be it all adds up and would be quite
big in total. Mpeg video isn't all that good either on the fastest pc
with mmx or an Amiga, the best I have seen a PC do with a top of the
range technology is only good quality but it a tiny postage stamp window 
and if the PC with its 300mhz technology can only do that then the 
'classic' range of Amigas has no chance. The basic Amiga you will need is 
at least and A1200 030 with about 8meg, you could maybe get away with 
6meg but i'm unsure about that, anything less and it isn't even worth 
entertaining the idea. If you have an 030 Amiga watching mpeg clips can 
be fun to see with the novelty of short film on your amiga, I don't see 
any real purpose for mpeg video as the amount of film you actually get 
to see is very short and takes up masses of space. The quality on the 
Amiga is less than pleasing also, the picture update is jerky, the window 
is small and the actual picture quality is rubbish. I would recommend 
missing mpeg videos out, they can be a fun experience at first until 
the novelty wears off and you find there isn't much use.

 Next we come to mpeg music and this is a totally different ball game,
the basic set up would be about an A1200, 030, 8meg, if you have an
020 the songs won't play correctly and they will practically be useless.
If you have an 030 then your in for a real treat. Although mpeg music
files are usually around 3meg for one song the rewards they bring normally
out-weigh the size factor. For playing mpeg music you will have to download
mpega which can be found on the aminet and various other places. Mpeg
music saves you buying a song or lets you hear it before you buy it,
there is the big question to whether the piece of music is copyrighted
so always be sure you know what your letting yourself in for.

 Overall Mpeg music is really worth looking into but movie clips are
so bad quality you may as well give them a miss. If you have any comments
or further questions about mpeg music or video send your question into 
the usual addresses.

.---------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|                           Production Begins For                           |
|                               SoloTrek III                                |
`---------------------------------------------------------------------------'

After   extensive   research   and  planning,  SoloTrek  III  is  finally  in
development. The release date is tentatively scheduled for December 1998.

SoloTrek  featured an 8X8 galaxy with six levels of play.  You had no options
of alliance, you were the Federation.  The graphics were minimal,  but it was
still difficult to beat level six.

SoloTrek II  featured a 16X16 galaxy.  You could choose one of five alliances
and six difficulty levels. There were good graphics and sounds. Level six was
still almost impossible to beat, especially without a save option.

SoloTrek III features a 20X20 main galaxy, with a 10X10 secondary galaxy.  The
graphic interface has been improved and graphic display has been enhanced with
digitized pics of  everything possible.  You're back to being the  Federation,
but there's more than enough to keep you busy as it is.

The biggest addition  to the game is the module approach.  The galaxy, hailing
messages, events, planets and missions are all based on external script files.
This means that new games can be developed to run on the SoloTrek III engine.

The Galaxy
20X20 with a 10X10 linked section

The Hailing Messages
No more yes or no messages.  Each hailing message appears only  once in a game
session  and  each  message  can have up to  four  different  responses.  Each
response means different results.

Events
Events can now have much  more dire  results for  your ship.  As with  Hailing
Messages, Events only happen once per game session.

Planets
Along  with the  standard random  Class M  planets, specific  planets dot  the
galaxies. They can be  either fixed,  like Earth  at sector  001, or  randomly
placed.

Missions
No longer simple exploration and  combat for  you, Captain.  There are several
missions to be completed as well.  Some are  as simple  as finding  a Dominion
Outpost and destroying it. Some are more complex, asking you to find items and
take them to specific locations.

Starbases
Like the planets, Starbases can  be  randomly  placed,  or  fixed.  Just  like
SoloTrek II, not all Starbases will be friendly to you.

Save Game
Praise Emperor Kayless! Finally, you don't have to take on the whole galaxy in
one sitting.

Hidden Items
Q, lovable Q, still shows up to pester you.  The Borg are not going to give up
any time soon either. Three new `arcade games' have been added to show up from
time to time and annoy you.

Your Ship
You start out with a Runabout  (Level 6)  and must work your way up  to bigger
and better  ships.  Get your  `Federation Factor'  high enough  and you'll  be
promoted and given a new command. Or, you bloodthirsty types can take on enemy
ships to plunder them for latinum to buy new ships.

Timeline
Used to taking  your time?  Not  any more, Space  Jockey!  There's a  timeline
running;  if you don't get the situation under control,  it will get you under
its control.

Modules
The first module, included with SoloTrek III, will be `The Dominion War'.  The
timeline is running and  the Dominion  is playing  for keeps.  Grab your mouse
and get the galaxy back  under control.  You  can even  make it  to the  Gamma
Quadrant.

                                  SoloTrek III
                                 December 1998

@node "fe4" "ShadowElks interview"

@{fg shine} ShadowElks interview@{fg text}

 A great game currently in developent is The Shadow of Time which is
losely base around monkey islands. We grabbed a quick interview with
the programmer to tell all the juicy gossip.

CS = Chris Seward (AIO Editor)
HS = Henrik Smiding (TSoT Programmer)

CS : Firstly can you tell us a little about the ShadowElks team,
who you are and what you do.
 
HS : The team consists of:
Henrik Smiding - System 3 programmer. When not at his computer, he is
currently studying computer science at Lund university in Sweden, or
spending time with his wonderful girlfriend :)

Mikael Pettersén - Main graphics artist. When not spending time with his
girlfriend, or attending some sporadic lessons at Lund university, he is
making some great graphics and music for the game :)

Johan Forsberg - Additional graphics. When not absent or otherwise vanished
from the face of the earth, he also makes som great graphics for our
production. :)

 
CS : When did you start using the Amiga and why was it you did pick
the Amiga over another computer? The Amiga is obviously the best
computer but why did you stay on it as the chances of a get-rich
quick game are slim?

HS : We didn't start this game in the effort to make a huge load of cash.
We love working on the Amiga and want to help restoring it to it's prevoius
position, as the leading media- and gamemachine.
The software market for other computers is controlled by big
corporations while the Amiga is supported by its users. Therefor you can
say that the Amiga is kind of a computer liberty-symbol. The computer
that refuses to die.
Unfortunately the Amiga market today is somewhat unstable and is up to
todays Amiga owners to save it.
You don't have to make games to help the Amiga, just by paying for a couple
you are helping it more than we are by making it.

 
CS : When did you start work on The Shadow of Time and what was your
inspiration for it?

HS : On an late 1990 summermorning I was visiting my new-found friend at
his home. He's a big fan of adventuregames, and showed me an adventuregame
called 'MonkeyIsland'. I was quite impressed, and we began discussing and
comparing the different systems around.

After this I went home and began coding on an adventure system. In short of
any decent name, I called it AGS, short for 'Adventure Game System'. This
was soon dropped to just 'System' along with the rest of it, and after a
while 'System II' was started.

I made the unfortunate choice of programming it in AMOS, Although it's a
great language (I still use it to make the game editor), it's just to
limited and buggy to make anything serious with. :(
Even so, I continued on 'System II', to make it perfect. But I started
noticing a growing disapprovement from my graphic artist on my choice of
programming language. I got less and less graphics, and eventually I had to
terminate the 'System II' project.

After this I made a 'Walker' clone in AMOS. Once again I found the limits of
AMOS disturbing, and due to speed problems, it was scrapped at the end of
'93. Then, at the start of 1994, I started learning assembler language, and
began coding on various routines to make life easier. At approximately the
same time I started planning the structure of what was to become the 'System
III' code.
After making the most basic routines, I (once again) noticed that I wasn't
getting any graphics, so I started on a 'Dune II' clone instead. This was
the first project in which I drew all the graphics myself. For this reason,
and the fact that the game was to complicated, it was scraped. :)

After this, I felt it was time to re-open the 'System III' project, and
We've worked on it for almost three years now.


CS : Do you currently have a publisher for TSOT? if so who is publishing
it and when can we expect it to be released?

HS : Yes, we are signing with Epic Marketing as we speak, and the game will
hopefully be ready at the first quarter of 1999.


CS : Are there any set release prices for TSOT?
 
HS : No, not yet.

 
CS : What do you think of the annoucement made by Amiga Inc?

HS : The one about OS5.0 and stuff?
It's sad that it won't be backward compatible, but that's normal when you
get a new CPU and I don't think it will be long before all the great
applications are ported to the new Amiga computer.

 
CS : What are your dreams for the Amiga in the future? and what spec
machines would you like to see be used?
 
HS : Have you ever seen the computers in Star Trek? :)...Naa.. just
kidding. Well, obviously the Amiga needs much more CPU-power, like from two
or four PowerPCs, and something equaly fast as a sound and graphics engine
to keep up with other computers on the market today.
 
CS : Why Shadow Elks ;)?
 
HS : We couldn't come up with a name we both agreed on. Mikael wanted
something with the word 'elk' in it to show our swedish background and
Henrik wanted something else which we can't recall right now. Then suddenly
we had to came up with a name quickly as a swedish computer magazine was to
write a small piece about us, so we combined our suggestions and came up
with the somewhat weird 'Shadow Elks'. :)

 
CS : Any comments for anyone who is thinking of making an adventure
game in the style of TSOT?

HS : Make sure you plan the specs so they will still be adequate in
two-three years when the game is finished, and get ready for some very hard
work and long hours. :)
Huge animations seems fun when you are writing the script, but not as fun
when you realize how long time it will take to animate them .
When you write the script try to think of all possibilites so you don't
end up with problem in the end of the game which can't be solved cause
you forgot to pick up a stupid coin in the begining.
If you want music in the game, make sure you have lots of tunes,
otherwise they will really get on your nerves after some hours of
play.
Much planning, a tad planning and some additional planning.
And most important, have fun doing it! :)

CS : Thankyou for your time!

 You might not have heard much for a while but Domination is still going

 a special offer for AIO readers. We'll probably approach one of those new
 software development companies that have appeared such as Vulcan Software.

 This is part two of the diary and it's pretty large to keep up with all the

 you can still download issue #12, or any other issue from the official AIO

 @{B}@{u}JUNE@{UB}@{uu}
 Due to my exams, Domination might suffer a bit in terms of the amount of
 time I am able to devote to it. This will change next month though, when
 they are all over


 @{b}@{u}Oooops!@{ub}@{uu}
 I made a silly mistake after finishing the first part of the diary. I
 accidentally overwrote my latest version of Dom. It was just before I was
 going to make a backup as well. I lost quite a large chunk and I had quite
 a bit of catching up to do.


 @{b}@{u}What Exactly Did You Lose Then?@{ub}@{uu}
 I lost a load of coding for the Military Catalogue Menu. Here is a copy of
 the menu structure in the game so you can see where it lies:


       +->Data Menu
       |
       +->Trades Menu
       |
       +->Government Menu
       |                   +-->Military Database Menu
       +->Help Menu        |
       |                   |   +-----------------------+
       +->Military Menu>---+-->|Military Catalogue Menu|
  Base |                   |   +-----------------------+
  Bar--+->Mining Menu      |
       |                   |
       +->Research Menu    |
       |                   |
       +->Fleet Menu<------+
       |
       +->Finance Menu
       |
       +->Option Menu

 I haven't done much for the Military Menu yet. All the program does for it
 at the moment is draw it and set up the buttons (make them clickable) so
 you can access the Military Catalogue Menu, Military Database Menu and take
 a shortcut to the Fleet Menu.


 @{b}@{u}Military Catalogue Menu - What's that then?@{ub}@{uu}
 The Military Catalogue Menu enables you to construct ships, space
 stations, and anything else that I care to add. I have started coding it
 to let you construct ships and I had nearly finished it when I made the
 mistake. I will take you through all the steps in creating this menu.    


 @{b}@{u}Creating the Military Catalogue Menu - A Step by Step Guide@{ub}@{uu}
 These are the steps that I take in creating the menu:

 1. Load up DPaintIV AGA.
    As Dom does not use AGA, I have to disable it before making any
    graphics for it because the palette in DPaint is automatically set to
    8-bit (0 to 255) for the RGB settings.                                     

 2. Draw the menu.
    It's also a good idea to save a version of the picture that is labelled
    for reference purposes. Click @{" here " system "Screenshots:showiff >nil: Screenshots:dom1.iff"} to see the menu design and
    @{" here " system "Screenshots:showiff >nil: Screenshots:dom2.iff"} to see the menu with some example data on it.

    I will just spend some time to explain the menu in detail. The ship
    list on the left consists of 16 ships that you can equip however you
    want. This list of ships can be scrolled using the scroll bar on the
    right hand side of the list and each ship has its own little 9x9 icon
    to symbolise it. After you construct a ship you can select how many to
    build using the quantity buttons below the ship list. When you done,
    you simply click on the buy button and construction begins. The large
    box to the right of the ship list contains a large "green print" of the
    selected ship. The dotted green boxes on this picture are bays. You can
    put one item in a bay and you have different bays for different types of
    items. The different types of bays are:

    Weapons, Shields, Sensory (or spy) equipment, Star Drives, Colonisation
    Equipment (Terraformers ect.) and Accessories (for things like
    transporters, cloaking devices, ect).

    Also displayed in this box is the cost for the ship (without any items
    equipped), the maximum capacity of the vessel, and its maximum velocity.

    You might recognise the ship in my picture as one from K240. I assure
    you that this is only temporary and I will eventually draw my own
    ships when I get enough time.

    To the right of this display is the place where you select the items
    that you want to equip. This is achieved with a tab system to select
    the type of item that you wish to select. When the tab is changed, all
    the items of that type that you have are displayed in the box below
    the tab buttons. To equip your ship, you simply drag and drop the item
    onto your ship. You are most likely thinking, "won't the ship get
    rather cluttered with all those bays and items". Yes it would but when
    you click on, say, the tab to display the shields, the only bays that
    are displayed on the ship display are those for shields. This avoids
    cluttering.

    The number of bays that the selected ship has available for different
    types of equipment is shown near the bottom of the menu. Below that is
    a two line description of the ship.

    After the menu has been designed you can proceed to the next step:

 3. Code the drawing.
    This is the tedious part. You have to make the program actually "draw"
    the menu. You could load in the menu from disk of store it with the
    program but this is a waste of memory and disk space when you could
    spend an hour making the program draw it. To do this you need to use
    AMOS Pro's drawing commands and have DPaint open in order to keep
    flicking over to get coordinates, colours, ect. You can check to see if
    you have made any mistakes by running the program, saving the display
    and loading it into DPaint's spare screen. Then simply flick between
    what the display is supposed to look like and the display that the
    program produced to see where you made mistakes by using the "j" key to
    just to the other screen and back.

 4. Code the mouse zones.
    These are areas on the menu that interact with the mouse. They are
    defined with a simple command for each zone:

    @{b}Set Zone @{ub}number,x1,y1 @{b}To@{ub} x2,y2

    You can use these zones to make buttons, sliders, or whatever you want.
    To get the coordinates just use DPaint.

 5. Code the interface.
    This is the biggest part. It is also the part of my coding that I lost.
    As I write this diary, I will do the coding for Domination as I go.

 It is best not to do part 3 until you have the whole menu up and running
 smoothly. To begin with it is best to just make the program load in an IFF
 picture and place the mouse zones on that. I'm speaking from experience
 when I say this. Many a time I have made an ultra fast, compact drawing
 procedure for a menu only to find that I want to make changes to its
 design.

 I have recently made some changes to the military catalogue menu. The
 information for the selected item used to be text based. Mark and I have
 changed it into a more graphical display. Click @{" here " system "Screenshots:showiff >nil: Screenshots:dom3.iff"} to see what I mean.
 I think it looks a lot better now and it's easier to look at and get
 information from. It's lucky I haven't made the program draw the menu yet
 or I wouldn't have been able to change it as easily.

 The military catalogue menu is coming along quite nicely. I have coded
 the drag and drop routines and they work beautifully. I showed the working
 product to Mark and he was very impressed seeing as I created the code from
 scratch and It was not based on any other code. You can even cancel the
 dragging by clicking the right mouse button. What happens to the object
 depends on where it is dragged from.

  +------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
  | Place object is dragged from | Effect of clicking right mouse button |
  +------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
  |    Object display box        |        Disappears from pointer        |
  |                              |                                       |
  |        Ship bay box          |       Reappears in ship bay box       |
  +------------------------------+---------------------------------------+

 I have completely finished the button routines. The buttons work just like
 intuition buttons with cancelling and the like. I have nearly finished
 coding the slider bars. The vertical slider bar procedure is completely
 finished although I am still tweaking at it. The horizontal slider bar is
 nearly finished and that's what I'm working on right now. The tabs work
 wonderfully and I've not had any trouble with them. There is still a lot of
 work left to do on this menu but once it's done I hope it will be bug free
 and fluid.


 @{b}@{u}JULY@{ub}@{uu}
 What a month! The Amiga1 team has really gone for it. It is the most we
 have ever done in one go. My exams have finished and I am free to work on
 the game as much as I want. There is so much work still to do but if we can
 keep up the pace we would be doing very well. Mark has had more time to
 help me this month and ship building is complete at last and we have just
 started the ship control routines which let you give commands to your
 ships. Once we have finished that we will design the fleet menu so you can
 put ships into fleets. Once you can setup fleets we need to let you give
 the fleets commands. First a bit of game design...


 @{b}@{u}Colonisation@{ub}@{uu}

 Some ships can be equipped with colony equipment (i.e. terraformers). These
 ships can then be sent to systems that have planets you wish to inhabit.
 The idea of being able to expand your civilisation was originally going to
 be the idea behind the game but it is no longer the central focus. Now we
 have decided that there will be set scenarios like in Sim City. This means
 that we can make expansions for the game as time goes on. No longer will
 you complete a game and let that be the end of it. Just install the
 expansion scenario(s) and play a different mission or 20! This is our plan
 and at this point in time it looks very possible.

 Ships with colony equipment can set up both military bases and
 colonies. The type of equipment equipped determines the types of planet
 that can be inhabited. A simple citybuilder could construct a colony on an
 Earth-like planet but not on a gas giant. By citybuilder I do not mean that
 the ship builds the colony, it means that the ship has a special chip
 embedded in its core system that allows it to coordinate the building of
 the city by communicating with the community that was transported to the
 planet.

 
 @{b}@{u}Races@{ub}@{uu}

 We have though a little about the some of the races you might encounter in
 Domination. This topic has not been pursued to a great extent as we are
 concentrating mostly on the game's mechanics at the moment. Only when the
 user interface is complete and bugtested can we really begin to spill our
 imagination (and we can't wait!!). All of us at Amiga1 are into Star Trek
 and Mark and I have recently been watching the borg episodes of Star Trek -
 Voyager. This has made me want to incorporate a race that assimilates
 technology from other races. Due to the amount of technology that it has
 already assimilated when you first encounter the race means that it will be
 a fearful adversary. Some races are friendly and you may be able to trade
 with some of them and possibly end up with new equipment to embed into
 future ship designs (that was not a hint! ;)


 @{b}@{u}Cheat Modes@{ub}@{uu}

 We have thought of a couple of cheat modes. The first lets you have all
 the equipment for your ships that you could possibly gain in the game (this
 should be a very difficult cheat either to work out or activate because
 getting enhanced equipment in the game is a difficult task at the best of
 times). The other reflects our interest in science fiction. The cheat gives
 you new ships like the Enterprise (Star Trek), Star Bug (Red Dwarf),
 Saratoga (Space Above and Beyond) etc. This is a very unlikely cheat mode
 due to breaches of copyright (I would have to look into this). Ok, now back
 to the making of the game.


 @{b}@{u}Base Tabs@{ub}@{uu}

 The tabs on the base bar have not all been drawn yet. Some have been
 planned to display certain features but at this moment in time only four
 out of the eight have been drawn and only three of those four have been
 fully coded. I have not before stated what the tabs are, so you can see
 in this @{" picture " system "Screenshots:showiff >nil: Screenshots:dom4.iff"}.


 @{b}@{u}Recent Development@{ub}@{uu}
 A lot has been done to Domination recently. I hope I havn't missed
 anything.

 .> Added a nice "ACCESSING" picture to the beginning of the game to show
    when it is loading.

 .> Made the map screen scroll. There are three speeds of scrolling. The 
    fastest is achieved by using the directional buttons on the basebar. The
    medium speed is achieved by moving the pointer to the edge of map
    screen. If you want slow, precise scrolling you simply hold down the
    right mouse button when moving the map.

 .> Slightly redesigned the fleet tab on the base bar. See @{" BaseTab " system "Screenshots:showiff >nil: Screenshots:dom5.iff"}
    picture for details.

 .> Added a useful procedure that I found on a CU Amiga CD. When you press
    the help key, a white bar appears at the bottom of the screen giving you
    information about the mouse pointer position, current mouse zone and
    colour under the pointer. I have expanded the procedure to allow me to
    view the hardware coordinates of the mouse pointer and snapshot screens
    to view in DPaint. The procedure (before my modifications) is included
    in this archive called "ScreenInfo.AMOS" and is by Steve Bennett.

 .> Slightly redesigned the base bar to make it look a little better. We
    have made the letter display larger by changing its bulky buttons for a
    pretty slider bar. This also gave us space to add an extra speed button.

    Speed button summary:   (Real Time = Game Time)
    +--------+------------------+
    | Button |   Clock Speed    |
    +--------+------------------+
    |    1   |     Paused       |
    |    2   |  1 sec = 1 hour  |
    |    3   | 1 sec = 12 hours |
    |    4   |  1 sec = 1 day   |  <- New button
    +--------+------------------+

    We also changed the money display. The display was very small before due
    to the options button to the right of it. We got rid of the help button
    and put the options button in its place. I think we might now use the
    help button on the keyboard to display a help bar (like the programmer's
    help bar mentioned earlier) to show what a button does or what a window
    displays when the mouse pointer is moved over it.

    The money display would before display 1000 credits as 1K (K being
    1000). Now that we have the space it now displays the real value (1000).
    This means it is more accurate because the number before was rounded to
    the nearest denomination.

 .> Redesigned military menu (tab1). Tab 1 is the only tab on the military
    menu that is finished. That is the ship building. We have slightly
    redesigned the look and "feel" of this menu and it looks a bit better.
    @{" New Military Tab " system "Screenshots:showiff >nil: Screenshots:dom6.iff"}

 .> Designed and programmed the ship building system. The ships are
    constructed in orders. A new order is set up every time you click on
    the buy button on the military catalogue. If you build a large order of
    ships at the same time, they will be constructed slightly faster (batch
    production rather than job production - sorry, I took GCSE Business
    Studies :). When an order is complete you are informed via the message
    bar.

 .> Coded the 8th tab on the base bar (unassigned ship command). This allows
    you to send commands to ships that have not been assigned to fleets.
    They cannot do everything that fleets can do though.

    +-------------+--------+------------+
    |   Command   | Fleets | Sole Ships |
    +-------------+--------+------------+
    | Goto System |   Yes  |     Yes    |
    | Colonise    |   Yes  |     Yes    |
    | Spy         |   Yes  |     Yes    |
    | Geo. Survey |   Yes  |     Yes    |
    | Attack      |   Yes  |     No     |
    | Defend      |   Yes  |     No     |
    | Patrol      |   Yes  |     No     |
    | Rendezvous  |   Yes  |     No     |
    +-------------+--------+------------+

 .> Designed the different classes of planets and their systems. There are
    10 different planet classes but this may increase if we come up with any
    more. Mark drew the graphics for them in DPaint. They are quite good.
    @{" Planets and their classes " system "Screenshots:showiff >nil: Screenshots:dom7.iff"}
    You are welcome to see if you can do better. If I like yours more then I
    will use then instead (please use the same palette).

 .> Completed base tab 7. When you click the select destination button on
    tab 8, tab 7 flicks to the front and the message "Select target..."
    appears. You can then either click on a system or on a planet. When you
    have selected a destination for you ship(s), tab 8 flicks bach into view
    with the selected destination in the target box. If it was a planet then
    the image next to the destination box will be green. If it was another
    system then the image will be yellow. The four buttons above the
    destination box only work if they are appropriate to the selected
    destination (I might grey them out if they're not). You can't colonise a
    star for example.

 .> Made a little blitz proggie. The AMOS bob editor kept screwing up banks
    that contained objects with different number of colours so I had to find
    another editor and see if that would work. The one I found works fine. I
    can't tell you what it is because I can't afford to register it at the
    moment. Once I have registered it I will let you know what it's called
    and where to get it from.

    The editor is compiled and cannot be called from the editor so I have to
    call it from workbench. I made a little blitz program that makes a
    single button in a window that when I click loads up the editor. It
    makes it a lot easier when I keep going back to the editor.

 .> Code reduction. Mark went over the coding for the communications window.
    He reduced it from about 60 lines to 4! It's a lot smoother!

 .> Begun work on the intro sequence. It looks quite good so far. When it is
    finished it will house the main menu for Domination.


 @{b}@{u}The Options Menu@{ub}@{uu}

 We have decided that we are going to leave the options menu until last.
 One option that I know needs to go in there is one that lets you disable
 the scrolling of the map when you move the mouse pointer to the bottom
 of the visible screen (i.e. bottom of the base bar). At the moment you can
 scroll the map screen down by positioning the pointer at either the top of
 the base bar or the bottom. The top has a slight delay to allow you to move
 over the scroll area when moving from the basebar to the map. The bottom
 scroll area might be annoying for some players (it annoys me sometimes).


 @{b}@{u}Space?@{ub}@{uu}

 We are trying to make the best use of space in the user interface (excuse
 the pun :). This is why we are using tabs so much. It stops the display
 getting cluttered and allows us to get a lot more information into the same
 area. The tabs on the base bar means that we can get eight tines the amount
 of information into just the left hand corner of it.

 We noticed that the military catalogue was rather compact but we noticed
 that the part that shows you the number of each bay type the selected ship
 has is a little wasteful. We could move the icons closer together and make
 them left justified. This would allow use to use the area to the right of
 them for something else. There is nothing that we can put in there yet so
 we won't alter our drawing until there is.


 @{b}@{u}Getting Arround@{ub}@{uu}

 Here's a bit of game plot:

 All ships in Domination use a military technology called quantum
 tunnelling. This is achieved by opening small wormholes in the fabric of
 space just large enough for the ship to enter. These small wormholes only
 travel a short distance in comparison to the size of the galaxy but in
 for of interstellar travel in the local quadrant they prove invaluable
 allowing travel of 20 light years in under a week.

 Ships in transit cannot be sent new commands until they reach a system
 containing a military outpost. If you send a ship to a system without a
 military outpost, you have no way of communicating with it. When the
 ship's supplies begin to run low, it will return. The reason is that
 your race has not yet been able to successfully transmit signals through
 the wormholes. All attempts so far have failed. Until this problem is
 fixed - you cannot communicate with your ships once they have left the
 system. (This is not because we cannot program it. It is just to make the
 game more interesting. You may be able to research into the technology
 later in the game).


 @{b}@{u}The Research Menu@{ub}@{uu}

 The research menu is accessable from the base bar and enables you to
 expand your existing technology and invent new ones. You begin with the
 best equipment in the military available to you. There are many other
 accessories that can be equipped to a space vessel but you only buy from
 the military due to security breaches. The maximum number of items per
 equipment type is currently eight but I am thinking of increasing this.


 @{b}@{u}Ship Construction@{ub}@{uu}

 When you construct a ship, where does it begin? This is something we had to
 think about. We came to the decision that you can select, via a tab in the
 military menu, which military outpost (be it on a planet or a space
 station) your ships are constructed at.


 @{b}@{u}Ship Plee@{ub}@{uu}

 We need some ships drawn for the military catalogue menu. If you want to
 have a go then draw one in the box provided in the picture below and send
 it to Chris (Brown) at the address shown below. If I like it then I will
 put it in the game. In total I need 16 ships. You don't have to draw 16 if
 you don't want to. If 16 people send in a ship each and I like them all,
 there will be enough. Feel free to draw as many as you like as they would
 all be appreciated (Chris Seward might even show them in AIO if I ask him
 nicely!).

 @{" Ship Construction " system "Screenshots:showiff >nil: Screenshots:dom8.iff"}  The file is named "Dom8.Iff" and is in the
                       screenshots directory of the AIO archive.

 N.B. Everything that can't be seen from the outside of the ship should be
      drawn in the darker green.


 @{b}@{u}What's to do next?@{ub}@{uu}

 The next thing to do is the system display on the 7th tab on the basebar so
 we can select planets and start coding the colonisation routines. I think
 this will be quite enjoyable compared to coding the ship building. However,
 we might do the fleet menu next, allowing you to put your unassigned ships
 into fleets. This would make the next step to be able to command the
 fleets. The colonising routines and the fleet command routines are linked
 due to the fact that there must be a military outpost in the system
 (achieved by colonising).


 @{B}@{u}THE END@{ub}@{uu}
 @{i}You are now up to date with all the developments of this month.@{ui}
 We are working very hard at the moment and the diary this relects this.
 In about three weeks Mark will be on holiday so he can help increase the
 pace even more but in the meantime I have to put in most of the work
 myself (as usual :).


 @{b}@{u}August (up to the 15th)@{ub}@{uu}
 This month has been has been my personal favourite as far as Domination
 goes. We have introduced random seeds, completed the introduction
 sequence, started the main menu, and many other things.


 @{b}@{u}Mok up@{ub}@{uu}
 @{" Here " system "Screenshots:showiff >nil: Screenshots:dom9.iff"} is a picture of the Domination screen as it looks at the present
 time.


 @{b}@{u}Made up your mind yet?@{ub}@{uu}
 We have come to a decision about whether or not to let the player control
 ships within systems. We have decided that there is no need. The
 interplanetary drives that are fitted to your ships as standard are
 efficient enough to give any ship in a system access to every planet
 within it. It's enough hassle moving individual ships between systems
 unless they are in a fleet.

 This decission means that the button on base tab 1 is no longer needed. I
 have disabled it but before I remove it from the display I need something
 to do in its place and we have no ideas at the moment.


 @{b}@{u}Recent Developments@{ub}@{uu}
 Here they are in a list form to make it easier:

 .> We have done the system display tab and it fully works. It is the
    second fully completed tab.

 .> The fleet short-cut on the military menu is not used. I will wait to
    see if I can think of anything to replace it. If not I will remove it
    and make the military strength bar longer.

 .> We have designed the fleet control menu. It has quite a lot of buttons
    on it and will hopefully have drag 'n dropping of ships. The only part
    of the interface that has been coded so far is the listview of the ships
    at your system (only available if a military outpost is in the system).
    Fleets can only be made if there is a military outpost in the system.
    @{" Fleet Control Menu " system "Screenshots:showiff >nil: Screenshots:dom10.iff"}

 .> Made system flags. These can be used for various things. So far we have
    used the to set whether of not a system has been explored. To explore a
    system you simply send a ship or fleet there. If a system has not been
    explored, the message is displayed on the system display tab on the base
    bar.

    +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

 .> We have done the ship movement routines. You can now send a ship to
    another system! When it gets there, you can see the system. I think we
    need to make it so that you have to wait for your ship to return first.

 .> We have now completed the intro sequence and made a main menu for Dom.
    Here it is:

                           +=----------------=+
              =============+    START GAME    +=============

                              EXIT FROM D.I.N.


    I'm not going to tell you in what way the bar animates. You'll have to
    wait and see!

 .> Made random seed system. This is my favourite development this month.
    I games like worms you can enter a string and get a level depending on
    the string. This is called a random seed. To explain how it works I
    need to explain computer generated numbers.

    Did you know that random numbers generated by a computer are not
    actually random? In fact they follow a set pattern. Games like worms
    make use of this be telling the computer where in the sequence to start
    the pattern. this starting position is determined by the string that you
    type in (which is converted into numbers). This is why you get the same
    level every time you use the same string.

    In AMOS this is achieved using the @{b}randomize@{ub} command. The number
    following the command is where in the sequence to start the random
    numbers. Those out there that have any version of amos can try the
    following:

         @{b}Randomize@{ub} 1 : @{b}Print Rnd@{ub}(-10)

    Every time you run the program you will get the same answer. I don't
    know why you need the minus (-) sign in from of the 10. If you don't
    use it then AMOS ignores the randomize, strange.

    Domination now allows you to enter a sector I.D.. This is a number and
    is simply used after the Randomize command. This means that all future
    Rnd commands, as long as they contain a '-', will be the same if you
    use the same sector I.D.. This means that the sector will be the same,
    the system names will be the same and the types of number of planets
    within each system will be the same. This ends when it comes to random
    events, they are random.

 .> I have gone through some of the coding removing old stuff that's no
    longer needed. You'ld be surprised how much you can delete. I've been
    careful not to delete anything important though.

 .> Mark suggested reducing the height of the menu title bars. I did, and
    they look a lot better. Take a look at a menu with the new bar:
    @{" Military Catalogue Menu " system "Screenshots:showiff >nil: Screenshots:dom11.iff"}


 @{b}@{u}The next step@{ub}@{uu}
 The next step is the fleet control menu. That will be a lot of work. I'll
 be back next month with how it went.

@{fg shine} How to advertise in AIO@{fg text}

 Advertising in AIO couldn't be simpler, send in your full page advert
and we will print it for 3 issues after receiving it. You can advertise
anything, from the latest game you made to your web page or even a
company you run. Company adverts are welcome!

Hi,

Yes I will miss CUAmiga. I used to read it on occassion, and liked their 
cover CDs.

@{b}Reply:@{ub}

Hello Shaun, thanks for your comments on the Cu Amiga hot topic, i also
liked their CDs as they had some interesting programs and some programs
that you wouldn't find anywhere else. It'll be a change without CuAmiga.

 Unfortunately the AIO email has changed again, don't worry the old email
address will still work and it will be forwarded to my new address, you
can use which ever you like but the new one is better. The reason is the 
old one was web based mail but this new one is a @{b}*@{ub}real@{b}*@{ub} pop3 account 
use it at :-

                             @{b}amiga@thefree.net@{ub}

 The AIO web address has also changed slighty, its much better now with
a counter, online registration form, email submit, download all issues
from issue 1-16 (todate) and also the latest issue online each month
so if you don't want to download it you can read it online. The new page
is :-
