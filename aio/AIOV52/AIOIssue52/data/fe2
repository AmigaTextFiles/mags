There are several ways to solve one's need for an ever exact time.
Herein I'll give the two most obvious ways.

First, download a program.  Something like FACTS should do the trick.
It connects to the right server, gets the time, and corrects your
system clock accordingly.  Documentation and usage is straight forward.
I've also seen an Arexx script or two, but FACTS is the best all around.

The other option is to do it yourself direct from the source.  The
government being the source of publically accessible atomic clocks, just
go to {link http://tycho.usno.navy.mil}http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/{end}.  The time is given as an updating GIF
which both the current versions of Voyager and AWeb don't seem able to
support.  But, if you which to include such a GIF in your own web page,
or otherwise find out how to synchronize your computer to the exactly
correct time, then instructions can be found at:
