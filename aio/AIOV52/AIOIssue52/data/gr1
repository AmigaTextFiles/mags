BabeAnoid is a game based on the old classic Breakout or Arkanoid which means
you use a bat at the bottom of the screen to bounce a ball around to screen to
break bricks laid out at the top of the screen. Once all bricks have been
destroyed or hit, then that level is complete.
{pp}
BabeAnoid is a Babe driven game (babes are shown on the menu screen by the way!)
and you visit each room on a map when you start the game. This is the confusing part,
so you need to move the selection square to a 'room' to start a new level and you can
select any on screen so you don't have to play to same old levels all the time.
{pp}
You can use the keyboard or mouse to control your bat (other keys access other
features of the game), although you will have to read the help screen to see which
keys they are!
{pp}
I also forgot to mention, that music is played though out the game and at the menus
and it is rather good so you won't need to head straight to the music off button.
The sound effects are excellent and used widely from the ball bouncing, and bricks
exploding and other events that are happening on screen.
{pp}
Plenty of colour and textures are used on screen including the use of colour text
for the titles and neat little animations are widely used so you will not get bored
of it. The game have very good use of detail for everything, including the little
lemming you get to see now and again. Screen flashes and nudge effects are used as well.
{pp}
The game is easy to play and will work best on expanded systems with faster processors
to do all the work in the game. It is even playable on UAE for those that use it!
The game is quite difficult but not too much to be impossible to complete or too easy
to complete quickly. Some skill is required for each level.
{pp}
Overall, an excellent game. Well worth looking in to.
