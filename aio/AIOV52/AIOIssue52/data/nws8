Virtual Programming, a relatively new company on the Amiga scene has
bought out Blittersoft, a long established company, which provided users 
with Amiga hardware and software. 
{pp}
Virtual Programming is a UK company based in Bournemouth with a great deal 
of mystery surrounding their arrival to the Amiga scene. They first rose 
to prominence a few months ago when they advertised in Amiga Active 
seeking talented individuals to work on entertainment and application 
software for the Amiga DE. Since then they have been linked with 
Clearwater Interactive when it was revealed that both companies were 
working together on a number of Elate games. This latest development, the 
takeover of Blittersoft has revealed perhaps some startling details about 
the company as it has been suggested that Mark Hinton, Publisher of Amiga
Active is a Director in Virtual Programming.

Virtual Programming have emphasized that they intend to support both the
Classic Amiga and the new Amiga markets, although they are also working on
intent and Macintosh products. One of the most significant developments to
emerge since the takeover is that Virtual Programming's partners include
the Tao Group, Amiga Inc's senior partner and the MathEngine Group. The
latter partnership is the most interesting for in Issues 19 and 24 of
Amiga Active it was revealed that the MathEngine Group are working on
advanced development tools. One of their development toolkits is known as
the Zenon API, which helps developers working on PDA and other handheld
devices. It would seem that Virtual Programming Ltd are set to use their
Zenon API, which indicates that Virtual Programming are working on PDA
titles.

The takeover of Blittersoft should not be a cause for concern to
customers, as Virtual Programming will support all existing Blittersoft
customers. Further development of the former Blittersoft product range
will continue. Customers will also be reassured by the news that Paul 
Lesurf former Managing Director of Blittersoft has become a Director in
Virtual Programming.

In related news, Virtual Programming has been appointed as exclusive UK
distributors for AmigaOS XL. This product allows users to run Amiga-68k
applications on a pc using two emulator systems - AMIthlon and AmigaXL.
Applications are said to perform 10-20 times as fast as on a traditional
68060 system. Pre-orders are now being taken with AmigaOS XL expected to
be ready by October. According to some of the information released by
Virtual Programming, they will be offering suitable computer systems for
this forthcoming product.
