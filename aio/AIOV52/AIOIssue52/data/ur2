Eventually there will come a time when you need to compress things.
If such a time should manifest itself XPKatana is a great thing to
use. XPK archiving is not quite like using the lha/lzx/zip type of
archivers. The main purpose of XPK is to archive executables and
other general files.

This can also be done with tons of different frontends and scripts on
the Aminet, but none I have tested have really felt comfortable to
use. XPKatana on the other hand is definately one of the top choices
I'd go for when using XPK as archiving method, it's a complete
program designed so that no external programs are needed. All that's
really needed is fileid.library (as well as the XPK package
installed, of course).

So, what good is the XPK-archiving system for a layman such as
myself? Nothing, really. It's mostly intended for programmers wanting
to incorporate compressing routines in their software, but if boredom
suddenly should strike, you can play around with it sometime to see
what it's like.
