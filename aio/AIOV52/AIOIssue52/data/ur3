Now, this isn't part of the "real" Powerpacker, but what I imagine is
a re-working of the original. The original was written by a gentleman
named Nicola François (who is also the author of Reqtools among other
things). However, this one works about the same as the original.
"Powerpacking" is an ingenius way of archiving (executables, in the
original Powerpacker, which I naturally couldn't find at the moment)
texts, guides and so on. The files get considerably smaller when
archiving them and, especially with faster processors there's little
or no difference in running with- or without a powerpacked file.

Especially in the early days powerpacking was used to save space on
disks, nowadays I don't think it's too common, but you still once and
awhile come across files that has been powerpacked, which is fun, but
mostly out of nostalgia than anything else (PPview really suck). If
you want to use it, I'm sure this program will suit your needs, it's
only CLI based, but the switches are few, so that shouldn't be any
problem.
