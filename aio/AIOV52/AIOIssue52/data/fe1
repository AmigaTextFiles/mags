{italic}http://members.aol.com/SBr2798428/origins.htm{noitalic}{p}
Couldn't go by this month without a site like this one.  The name says

holiday.

{bold}Halloween{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://geocities.com/EnchantedForest/8112/hallow/index.html{noitalic}{p}
An old fashioned spook story, this one interactive.  At each stage of
the story you can click on a link corresponding to a decision of which
way to go in it.  God way to keep the kids busy, not to mention
yourself.

And what better way to celebrate the season then a good murder mystery!
 Enter a clearinghouse of all things muder mystery related, a central
depot for anything an enthusiast might like.  But be careful lest you
become a statistic.{p}
To start with you'd be surprised to find out there are conventions
devoted to this sort of thing.  Criminal writing, films, the whole
thing.  Events from all over the world.  Along in that same vein are
mystery oriented web sites, from books to pulp fiction.{p}
The clubs listed are also global, though the bulk of links seem to
indicate the British have more of a penchant for murder mysteries then
the rest of us.  Still, there's enough to go around.  MOsstof the
muder-weekend sites seem also for those in the UK, ut informaton
aplenty to host your own at-home murder mystery.  If that isn't enough
then check out where you can get some good mystery books.{p}
Just be careful about reading them on All Hallow's Eve.
