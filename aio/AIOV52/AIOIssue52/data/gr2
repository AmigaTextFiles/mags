WHAT IS PAYBACK?
{pp}
I love my Amiga.
{pp}
But saying that I mainly use it to play games would be a lie.
{pp}
indeed the Amiga market has been, over the past few years, painfully
and slowly shrinking down leaving only a handful of brave developers
who risks their capitals to give us some hours of fun.
{pp}
In truth some of the games published are not even worthy of a review
in a class B newsletter, but some others are little pearls that
really deserve to be purchased by every Amiga owner.
{pp}
Payback is one of those.
{pp}
As a game lover I own two of the major game consoles available on the
market. Over the years I have learned to appreciate playability over
excellent graphics and realistic sounds. Indeed, one of the game I
have quite enjoyed  was a Playstation game called Grand Theft Auto
(GTA). The game was nothing special in terms of graphics and sounds,
but was so addictive that several times I forgot about my life
commitments in order to finish the missions.
{pp}
Payback, has been "unfairly" defined by some people a good GTA clone.
{pp}
That alone would be a good enough reason to purchase the game, but I
believe the above statement doesn't do justice to the work of Apex
Design. In truth, the game has many similarities with the original
Playstation idea but that is where it all ends. Apex Design, with
James Daniels as captain, have taken the GTA concept further and
created an original Amiga experience.

LETS START!
{pp}
The game comes on a cd in a simple cd case containing a little manual
with instructions on how to install and play it.
{pp}
According to the developers an Amiga with 68020 + 16MB of ram is the
minimum requirement to play the game on AGA or GFX.
{pp}
In reality, they recommend a 68040 with extra fast ram and graphic
card to have an enjoyable experience. The only downside is that the
68k version of the game has to be played at resolutions not higher
than 320x256 to have a smooth experience.
{pp}
For the purpose of this review I have used an Amiga with dual
processor (PPC/68060), 128MB and Bvision graphic card and I have
tested both 68k and PPC version of the game.
{pp}
The 68k version was played at low resolution while the PPC at
640x480.
{pp}
Both versions used for this review ARE revision 5, the lates
available.
{pp}
The installation process is done simply by using the standard
installer.
{pp}
The game took 50MB of my hard drive and that included both 68K and
PPC version, which is available as a free upgrade from the Apex
Design web site.
{pp}
Once installed, after choosing the screen resolution using the
program setup, I was taken straight to a small rendered intro which,
although nicely done, could be easily skipped.
{pp}
The main menu includes the possibility to load, save a game and
change the options to suit your needs. One of the first thing I had
to do was to set up the cd device so the music could be streamed from
the cd.
{pp}
In truth, it is possible to play the game without the cd in the drive
but you will miss the rather nice songs by cynic guru, dispatch and
jed. They might not be the new generation Garbage or Robin Williams,
but the songs are professionaly done and I truly enjoyed listening to
them. Very strange considering I am not an in-game music aficionados.
{pp}
It is also possible to stick your own cd in the drive and listen to
your kind of music.
{pp}
I tried playing the game listening to the Godfather music and it was
a chilling experience.
{pp}
A quick glance at the control system and I was ready to start. The
game can be played using a range of different controllers starting
from the keyboard, CD32 joystick or a Playstation joypad (provided
you have a psxport adaptor available through Blittersoft separately).
{pp}
Unfortunately my machine did not recognized my CD32 joystick.
{pp}
Indeed the original lowlevel.library (needed to recognize the
controller) has a bug which causes some machines with fast cpu to be
incompatible with the joypad.
{pp}
A quick look at Aminet and the problem was solved.
{pp}
If you have the same problem just download SetJoyPort
(aminet/game/patch) and run it before running Payback.
{pp}
If you own a Playstation joypad I would strongly advise you to buy
the psxport adaptor which can be also used to play Wipeout. It really
improves the playability.
{pp}
Once I decided what name to give to the main character I was taken
straight into the first level with the camera zooming into the map of
the first city.
{pp}
In fact, the game is set into 3 different cities: Freedom  City with
its beautiful daytime parks and surroundings, the windy and cold Los
Francos City with the snowy and slippery roads, and Corona City with
its rainy weather and dodgy night life.
{pp}
Each city has 2 different levels and each level has several missions
to be completed before it is possible to move on to the next city.
Just jump in the game, read the instructions (i.e. acquire 1,500,000
points or more) and get on with your life.
{pp}
And what a life!! The life of a gangster.
{pp}
As soon  as i saw myself in the game I had only one purpose in mind:
to become the "godfather" of the city. Easy task? Not really!
{pp}
The first thing you will notice in Payback is its beautiful graphics.
If you are not familiar with GTA Payback is played from a top down
view with the camera zooming in and out following your movements.
{pp}
The graphics are very cartoony (colorful and bright) and every object
in the game is  in pure 3D. Yes, while GTA was a 2D game that faked a
3D view Payback has opted for a full 3D game. That means that cars,
lamps and even people have an extra dimension.
{pp}
The city are not very big, but they are all well designed with
several  parks, bridges and buildings to visit. In fact, in some
missions it is required for you to find a building, enter it and kill
the "bad" guy.
{pp}
Another strength ofthe game must be the sounds effects: very good
indeed. From the police sirens, to the horn of your car, the crash
sounds, the squeeky voice of your boss all is there to add extra
depth to the already good gameplay.
{pp}
There are several task to complete in each level and that will keep
you occupied for a while.
{pp}
Indeed, if you thought that 3 cities with 6 level in total was not
enough thinlk again. It will take ages for you to discover the game
in full.
{pp}
This is a game that must be played several times to discover all the
goodies that James has hidden for us.
{pp}
A public telephone rings (why they have not given you a mobile is a
mystery), follow the arrow to find it and listen to the instructions
of your boss and you are ready to begin.
{pp}
Kill a rival boss, steal a car, follow a traitor are only some of the
tasks available for you to complete.
{pp}
The first couple of missions are there to  test your skills and
introduce you to the gameplay. Later on you will be assigned almost
"impossible" missions that requires all your strengths and experience
to get through.
{pp}
You will earn points by stealing cars and killing people but you will
never gain enough to finish the level. It is best to complete the
main missions so you can enjoy the variety of the tasks and earn
enough points to complete the level.
{pp}
You start the game with 5 lives and you will lose them if you get
killed or "nicked" by the police. In both cases you will lose all
your weapons and have a clean start. Just like in real life.
{pp}
There are different vehicles available in the game. They do not
resemble the real cars but they all handle in a different way which
is a bonus. Try to steal a truck and see how difficult it is to drive
it in small roads. It really feels heavy!
{pp}
Some of the cars are painfully slow that you will be bother to death.
But look hard and you will find the fast ones. They are a joy to
drive and you will get a thrill speeding in the streets during the
rush hour without caring about traffic lights and crazy people
crossing the road when they shouldn't.
{pp}
But be careful! Like in real life the cars in Payback are not
indestructible and after some crashes they become visually damaged
and too slow to be driven.
{pp}
Above all, a damaged car could be very dangerous because it could
explode at any time causing your death.
{pp}
Just leave it somewhere and steal another one to continue your
missions. It is dead easy. Go near a car you want to steal, press the
return key on your keyboard and see your character pulling the driver
out of the car.
{pp}
If he complaints too much don't think twice in running him over, the
only thing you might regret is the red blood stain you have left on
the tarmac.
{pp}
There are also several bonus vehicles available to add variety to the
gameplay. Tanks, helicopters and boats are only some of those hidden
somewhere in the cities.
{pp}
Just remember: do something different if you want to find them.
{pp}
There are different ways to complete the levels: point can be
accumulated by being dishonest (stealing, killing, etc.), completing
missions or earning bonuses for being particurarly violent and nasty.
{pp}
On the first level for instance, the second time I played it I
managed to find the tank and completed the main mission (earning
1,500,000 points) by just going around killing and shooting
everything in sight.
{pp}
The "wanted" level of your character is shown on the top of the
screen by a number of gold stars. One of two stars and you will only
have the odd bill chasing you. Earn five or six and the entire police
force will be after your head with road blocks set every where in the
city.
{pp}
Your health is represented by a number of red hearts. Every time you
get hit by a car, shot or are involved in a crash you can lose one.
Lose them all and you have to start all over again.
{pp}
There are different bonuses and weapons available in the cities. They
are present in the form of brown boxes which can be destroyed to get
the goodies.
{pp}
Just open your eyes and  start your own collection of  pistols,
rifles, grenades, bazookas and flame throwers.
{pp}
There are also hint tokens scattered throughout the levels which will
give you basic hints and tips on how to play the game.
{pp}
Some of those bonuses are on top of buildings meaning you will need
to find a platform or a ramp to reach them.
{pp}
Once you finish the level and complete the main objective it is
possible to save it on your hard drive. Necessary if you want to
finish the game this century.

IS IT REALLY THAT GOOD?
{pp}
Well, I have really enjoyed playing this game and I still do.
{pp}
I have played GTA on the Playstation and I can honestly say Payback
is way more satisfying and original. There are so many things to do
and you will never get bored of it. Even when you have completed the
game you will go back to improve your previous score or to have some
more fun.
{pp}
The missions in the game are well balanced and they are never
repetitive.
{pp}
They will gradually increase in difficulty and it is only when you
reach the second city that the police gets very tough.
{pp}
Indeed, you never feal doing the same thing twice.
{pp}
Compared to GTA the cars in Payback look rather blocky but that is
down to the true 3D nature of the graphics.
{pp}
The AI is not 100% flaw free. The police seem to have a licence to
kill every innocent person in the street. Indeed, they drive their
cars as badly as I do, and I am supposed to be the bad guy.
{pp}
On a 68k machine the game has to be played at 320x240 to be fully
appreciated.
{pp}
Any resolution higher than that will seriously affect the
playability.
{pp}
But install a PPC card in your Amiga and enjoy the fun at higher
resolutions and full speed.
{pp}
The PPC 3D has many improvements over the 68k like gourad shading and
rotating view. The latter will rotate and angle the camera according
to speed you will be moving. It is very cool to watch but I had to
switch it off after few minutes because I felt very confused.
{pp}
There are many other nice effects like the lens flares, the realistic
lamps, and the motion blur which can be enjoyed only by people who
are "into" motion sickness.
{pp}
I also love the humour present in the game. Steal a tourist bus,
drive it carelessly and hear the passengers screaming out of fear.
Put the rear gear and hear the warning sound. Steal a police car and
drive it with your sirens on.
{pp}
I love the attention to details that James and his team have put into
the game, especially the weather effects which make the game even
more realistic.
{pp}
As a bonus there is a map editor which will give you the opportunity
to build your own cities and swap them with other Amiga gamers.
{pp}
And that is not all. There is also a multiplayer mode with
multiplayer maps where up to four people can join in for some fun,
and a rampage mode where it is possible to drive around the cities
without the hassle of completing any mission. Just pure arcade fun.
{pp}
If there is any thing I could ask for in this game is the network
support.
 pp}
I would love to join online other Amiga gamers to share the
experience of driving around Freedom city.
{pp}
To conclude, Payback is really a fantastic game. James has really
understood what is the maine thing that makes a great game:
playability.
{pp}
Buy it now! It will give you numerous hours of fun and you will never
regret any minute spent playing it.
{pp}
A true diamond.
{pp}
Come on James, give us a mission disk. Please!!!!!
