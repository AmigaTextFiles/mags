This is not the first time I've used this program, but I had to stop
using it for some reason which I can't remember, it made the WB crash
far too often than I wanted to, and then recently I saw a new version
uploaded and I instantly felt I had to give it another try. Then as
now there are tons of features that has to be explored, and it sure
is a good idea to give the manual a thorough read-through.

Visual Prefs is a tool designed to allow you to change the appearance
of the standard Amiga GUI, thus making it a total necessity for
anyone who doesn't have a severe eyesight handicap.

With Visual Prefs the shamefully ugly Gadtools GUI transforms like
magic before your eyes from being a constant and relentless reminder
that we are all at mercy of the Haage & Partner GUI mafia, into
something that in comparison seems like a trip to paradise.

But being the hack that Visual Prefs really is, there might turn out
that some programs just refuse to work with it, but unless the
program you want to run is something that your very life depends on,
you can always pretend that it never existed, at least that's what
I'd do if I come across any. However, the chances for that seem to be
very small since these days most programs are written in a correct
manner. One program in particular you have to be careful with when
using Visual Prefs is MCP, but the "Notes & Hints" section in the
manual give you good advice in preventing nasty crashes to happen if
you run both programs.

Using the program is really very simple, as you have a preview window
showing all your changes to the windows and stuff, you get an instant
insight in what you really are doing and if it suits your needs, all
it takes is to have a keen eye so you can spot all the (sometimes)
small changes you make. And by reading the manual and playing around
with the prefs the possibilities of changing the GUI seem almost
endless.
