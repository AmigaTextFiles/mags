Show of hands, how many people are still waiting for any of the
poromised Amiga products?  Yes I realize they're a couple weeks behind
their promised schedule. but we need {italic}something{noitalic}.  The
world needs something.  And we need it soon, along with plenty of
advertising and mass marketing.

Microsoft is pushing it's latest version of Win-Bloat, and they will
make it successful only by dirth of their power, and there will be
plenty of people to buy it.  But, not if there's an alternative, and
only if that alternative comes in a timely fashion.  Amiga has been
trying, and we've been patient, but the world moves on.

Let's just hope it doesn't move on without us.
