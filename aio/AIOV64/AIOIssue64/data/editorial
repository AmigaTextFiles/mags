I don't care who's fighting whome over which copyrights and all
what-not in the Amiga world, I just want everyone to get it together. 
The Community is small enough, the real opposition a behemoth, and the
world in general ignorant of what a computer {italic}should{noitalic}
do.  I got PC friends that wonder why I complain about PC and MAc
program packages that take up a gigabyte to install when harddrives
are so big, and then I spend ten minutes trying to tell them that huge
capacity is no excuse for sloppiness and bloatware; that a computer
with so much more capacity and power should have such resources
available for what really needs it, to have apps run that much more
quickly instead of just the same effective speed but now with nicer
looking pictures.

The point is, we got something the world needs though it knows it not,
the game is rigged against us, and yet there is still some in-fighting
going on in our little Community.  Get it together.  If you're an Amiga
developer then by all means work {bold}with{nobold} the company that is
Amiga and stop doing things in ways that you know full well will
result in litigation, bad feelings, and division.  No one out in the
real world is going to take a supposed revolutionary product such us
the forthcoming DE seriously if the Community supporting it can't
stand behind the same thing as one.. Look at the MAC community; love
it or hate it, they all still stand behind Jobs like a nice bunch of
fanatics.  I'm not saying not to express your differing opinions or
{italic}constructive{noitalic} criticisms, just remember there's a big
difference between that and just plain quarreling.

The image we project may be the difference we make.
