Magic Mewnu has one setting which affects in a major way the way it displays the
popup menu; blocking versus non-blocking.  Blocking is better visually
but has the disadvantaghe of being an admitted hack; it can result in
a screen lockup if used in conjunctiomn with a screens menu that pops
up in the upper right of the screen, such as the kind in MCP
(especially prone to lockup when triggered on the Workbench Screen in
particular).
However, while the Non-blocking mode is more system friendly it's not
without it's disadvantages.  In this mode the menu popping up acts
more like an actual window popping up.  THis can trigger some programs
that watch for such events, such as sound daemons and an exploding
windows util like Caboom.  If you have both of these two then every
menu click will not only bring up the menu but trigger off your
sound daemon and make the menu appear in the exploding windows
style... including for any submenus scrolled through.

It's a choise, based on your system configuration, needs, and
tolerances.
