We still need a new Tech Editor.  If you feel you have a good
enough background in computer stuff (with amiga specialization, of
course), and can field the occassional tech questions as well as put
out some sort of computer oriented technology article a month (on
hardware, software, programming, whatever), then please send us an
email to:{p}
general@aioworld.com{p}
So don't delay; we really miss having those tech articles.
