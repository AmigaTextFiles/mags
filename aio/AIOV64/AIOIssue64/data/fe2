October and {bold}my{nobold} favorite holiday, so would I dare to hunt
up a theme site or three?  Of course I would!  No use letting a good
scare go to waste.  With that in mind...

{bold}Dark Shadows Dot Com{nobold}{p}
{italic}http://darkshadows.com/{noitalic}{p}
In the late 60s and early 70s there was a gothic soap opera
(actually, I think it was the {bold}only{nobold} one) here in the USA
vcalled Dark Shadows.  In case you didn't grow up with it, or see it
on cable someplace, this site is a complete (and I mean *COMPLETE*)
rchive of everything about that show, including a list of plots and
cast of every single one of the 1225 episodes made.  Enough to keep
any Dark Shadows fanatic busy for quite some time to come.

Amazing how many graveyards the city of Chicago has and how many old
stones dot around them.  Want to see them?  Then check out this site
for all manner of elaborate grave-stones that have been put there over
the many past years.

What's Halloween without it's theme song.  Bobby Picket gave voice to
the classic song "The Monster Mash" and here's a site devoted to it and
him.

{bold}Skellenger Pages{nobold}{p}

With a name so close to that of a skeleton the man was born for
Halloween, a fact amply demonstrated by the design of this web site.
So, just what {bold}is{nobold} this site about?  Well, after scanning
several of the links I can now say that... um, er...  Well, let's just
take it a bit at a time.{p}
The {bold}very{nobold} many links to other sections of this site lead to
quite the variety of distractions.  Take the artwork for instance; some
links lead to pictures drawn in a sort of Halloween-tarot card style.
Interesting downloads and worth paging through.  Other links lead to
photos of past Halloweens and his own little pupmkin patch.  There's
also theme poems and scribblings, story exherpts of Ray Bradbury, and
even a list of the Top Ten Reasons to Love Halloween.  Just bundles of
stuff.{p}
Of course, the links aren't arranged in any particular order nor are
they categorized into artwork, songs, writing, or what-not, so you'll
just have to go through all the links on your own to find out what's
what.  Of course, such discovery would be half the fun...
