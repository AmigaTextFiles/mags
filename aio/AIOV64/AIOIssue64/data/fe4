This is just a quick coverage of some of the many FTP options
available for the Amiga.  In keeping with standard Amiga use, all are
ones able to properly parse an Aminet RECENT file.  All programs are
to be found on Aminet unless noted.
{pp}
AmFTP is the old out-dated Vaporware choise, and if you still use a copy you'll
have long since found out it's one major failing post-2000; the year
date is not Y2k tolerant, so since everything looks to it like it came
out in the early 1900s, then it will neverflag a RECENT file as recent
even if it came out that day.  Upgrade.
{pp}
Aminet AWMP is another one that uses the awmp pipe.  It parses RECENT
files by day into each of the last seven days and can be configured
for several different sites.  It'a specifically engineered
for Aminet use, however, and has no apparent function for general FTP
use such as User Name and Passwords.
{pp}
HTTPLister is an Arexx script that uses DOpus' FTP functions to access
Aminet. It uses the RECENT files and lists everything out in a
standard DOpus lister but while it uses the Recent file it does
nothing to sort them by day number.  It does support a list search
and multiple Aminet sites.
{pp}
mFTP is the successor to AmFTP from Vaporware and puts the RECENT
files into a nice lister that can be sorted by date if desired. For
non-Aminet sites it has full normal FTP functionality and really has
no problems, including the date problem of AmFTP being fixed.  It's
Shareware and if you want to ditch the annoyance window and have more
then 30 minutes at a time then you have to pay money.
{pp}
AMiGate is a little toolbar of a program specific to Aminet and sorts
the RECENT entries by which directories they're to be found in. 
SimnpleFTP is another MUI app that supports RECENT as well as normal
FTP, making it generally serviceable but again this one is Shareware. 
{pp}
And finally, Go Fetch is yet another MUI FTP proggy with Aminet
support but also requires a fee.  It's difficult however to tell if some
of it's quirks are do to it's shareware limitations or some program bugs (like
deleating ,profiles immediately after use). As such, I can't really
recommend this one at all.
{pp}
Plenty of options out there, you just have to decide what you need,
how much you want to pay, and if you're just going to limit yourself
to Aminet or not.  You have the information, the decision is now
yours.
