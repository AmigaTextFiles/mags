@{fg shine} Welcome@{fg text}

 Welcome back to another month of fun filled AIO, it's also the first
issue to kick off 1998 and I hope you all had a very happy new year!
You'll have probably noticed by now that the main menu has changed
slightly and next month there'll be a bit more of a change, but i'm
not saying anything on that subject so you'll have to wait and see,
nothing changed in a major way so don't worry to much ;)

 We recived The Final Odyssey from vulcan and it's one hell of a game
make sure you buy it after checking out the review in the games section.
We also have a packed utils section and articles section with another
outstanding interview, this time with Weird Science.

 Last month we made an error with the competition details, if you've
already entered it ok though, the only mistake was it is not the 10
first people to email it's going to be picked randomly 'out of a hat'
so now is your chance to win Aga Experience 3, just check out the
article section.

 The comercial amiga games market seems to be picking up very nicly
and when I phoned up to order my copy of the egarly awaited Myst
I found it was sold out almost everywhere so unfortunally we couldn't
bring you a review of Myst this month but next issue we'll definatly
have it in for review.

 Well thats enough of me, get on with reading the mag!!! See you all
again next month!

@{fg shine} ClickBOOM news (Quake)@{fg text}

Hello and happy new year from clickBOOM!

This edition of clickBOOM news is a bit longer, as there are 
quite a few interesting things happening. 

We will cover the following:

QUAKE:
1.  Announcement
2.  Pricing and preordering
3.  Quake TNT pack
4.  An offer you can't refuse
5.  Help us translate Quake into many languages
6.  Quake in Germany
                                                                             

QUAKE:

1.  ANNOUNCEMENT
----------------
On January 5, 1998 PXL computers and clickBOOM revolutionize 
the Amiga games market yet one more time - Quake Amiga is announced. 

Original Quake was written for PC by id software.

"Quake is the biggest, baddest bloodiest and most atmospheric 3D
action game ever conceived" - PC Gamer

"The most important PC game ever" - PC Zone

"Quake looks like no other game and perfectly displays id's trademark
fusion of nightmarish art and advanced technology" - Wired

"The new, radically different graphics engine delivers mesmerizing 3D
effects" - Time
                                                                             

Quake contains the most advanced 3D engine in the world. Moreover,
players can connect to any one of several hundred Internet servers
from around the world and join fast and furious battles against other
users.  Not only does Quake give the unbelievable amount of gameplay
with its built-in options, it also features the most flexible core
ever seen in a video game. This allows Quake users to create Quake
"add-ons" (also known as "packs"). Quake add-ons can range from simple
new levels and weapons to Quake movies and demos, to "total
conversions" that change the way Quake is being played. 

Total conversions allow Quake players to take control of James Bond in
the MGM's official Tomorrow Never Dies; embark on a dangerous snake
expedition in Sony's Anaconda; drive popular race cars in QuakeRally;
control fighter bombers, tanks, helicopters, hovercrafts and other
military vehicles in AirQuake; and much, much more.

All of the above options and more are now available on the Amiga.
Quake is the first game to allow Amiga users to join the Internet
gaming community. Connect to any Quake site and play against any
                                                                             
combination of Amiga, PC or Mac users! Plus, Quake Amiga will use ANY
Quake add-on, from freeware to commercial ones! And for those who like
one-on-one deathmatches, connect to any Amiga, PC or Mac (modem, cable
or network) and gib! 

No sacrifices - your copy of Quake is identical in options and 
expandability to PC or Mac.

Naturally, in order to make it more Amiga-like, Quake also contains
full locale support, Amiga-style menus, AREXX, option to play it in a
window on any public screen, and much more.   The complete list and
explanation of each option is impressive, and can be accessed from
clickBOOM web site ( http://clickboom.com ).

Various tournaments, competitions, and clans will be organized in the
near future for Amiga Quakers by clickBOOM and various Amiga
magazines. ANY Amiga player will be able to join as long as he is a
REGISTERED user of Quake. A registered user is a person who buys Amiga
Quake, fills out the registration card, and mails it back to
clickBOOM.

                                                                             
At the moment Quake has entered its final beta testing stage. 
After it is fully tested by clickBOOM it will be sent to Id software
for their approval, and then to CD duplication and packaging. If all
goes according to plan, Quake should be ready on Feb. 1.

Minimum Amiga required to play Quake is 68020 with FPU, 8Mb of RAM,
CD-ROM and 30Mb hard drive.

Recommended configuration is 68060 , 16Mb RAM , Internet connection.

For more information about Quake please visit http://clickboom.com .

2.  PRICING AND PREORDERING
---------------------------
                                                                             
Suggested retail prices for Quake are:
seventy Canadian Dollars ($70CDN)
ninety German Marks (90DEM) 
thirty British Pounds (30GBP)
forty seven American Dollars ($47US)

You can preorder Quake directly from clickBOOM for $60CDN before Feb.
1st.  You will save $10CDN, get an additional free Quake poster, and
ensure delivery to your home.

Ordering is available online or via fax. You can use Visa, 
Mastercard, money order, or bank wire transfer.




3.  QUAKE TNT PACK
------------------
PXL computers and clickBOOM are also working on a brand new 
Amiga-oriented CD called "Quake TNT pack". It is a 600Mb compilation
of the latest Quake related files - total conversions, partial
                                                                             
conversions, movies, demos, levels, and more. This CD is a must for
every serious Quake player.

Registered Quake users will receive 50% off the regular price.

Quake TNT pack should be available in February. At the moment exact
contents are not yet finalized, so visit http://clickboom.com for more
info soon. 




4.  AN OFFER YOU CAN'T REFUSE
-----------------------------
Piracy on the Amiga is like a cancer. It's a serious issue 
threatening to kill the gaming industry. It is obviously impossible to
track down on each and every instance of piracy, so PXL / clickBOOM
opted for another option.  We are giving the following incentive to
users to buy Quake instead of pirating it.

* Enter Quake tournaments, clans and competitions. These will be
                                                                             
   organized  by clickBOOM and various Amiga magazines and companies
   around the globe.  If you are not a registered user you will NOT be
   able to participate.
* Play Quake over Internet on Amiga servers. If you are not a 
   registered user you will NOT be allowed to join Amiga-oriented
   servers. 
* Each copy of Quake will have a unique serial number, and only by
   presenting this number can you receive customer support from 
   clickBOOM. 
* Do you want to see more conversions on the Amiga? Every 
   registration card   found in Quake and Myst packaging contains the
   following question:  "Name 1 game from another platform you think
   we should convert to the Amiga".  Possibility of doing another hit
   conversion and decision on which one it   will be, will largely be
   influenced by the answers we receive from   these cards. 
* Around 50% discount on Quake TNT pack (exact prices yet to be
   determined). 
* Direct, free access to various Quake upgrades which we have planned 
   for the near future.
* Priority for various promotions (such as translation, see below)
   and discounts.
                                                                             

Registering your copy of Quake is a simple process. Once you buy the
game fill out the registration card found inside its packaging, and
mail it back to PXL / clickBOOM.




5. HELP US TRANSLATE QUAKE INTO MANY LANGUAGES
----------------------------------------------
Quake Amiga has full locale support, so help us translate it into as
many languages as possible, and have your name in Quake credits! All
languages (except for English, built in already) are welcome!

On Jan. 17 we will draw three lucky Amiga users per language.
As always registered users (in this case users who preordered Quake
from clickBOOM) will have priority.  Only if there is not enough
registered users for a particular language a lucky non-Quake owner
will be added to the list.

To apply for the Quake translation please visit our web site located
                                                                             
at: http://clickboom.com and fill out the appropriate form we have
made available.



6. QUAKE IN GERMANY
-------------------
Due to its extremely violent contents PC and Mac Quake are "indexed"
in Germany, and so will be the Amiga version. This means that Quake
should not be publicly displayed and promoted, nor should it be sold
to persons under the age of 18. 

This will also make it difficult for mail order companies to sell it.
At the moment we do not have a solution to this problem other than
ordering online from PXL / clickBOOM.


Best regards,
clickBOOM

of running the excellent game Doom on the amiga it has finally happend. 
The way this happend was someone found out that ID software had released 
the source code to Doom on there FTP site so he quickly downloaded this
source code and compiled it using the amiga C compiler, although most of 
the commands where the same some where different. After a few days hard 
work Doom was finally ported to the Amiga. You will need the file 
adoom.lha or similar from the aminet and you will also need to download 
the doom .WAD file which can be taken from the PC or downloaded anywhere
as this file is free.
 It is an EXACT port of doom and nothing has changed. It will run on Any 
amiga with 8mb, it's probably best to have an 020 minimum and maybe 
better to have an A1200. I have tested Doom on an Amiga 1200/020/8mb and 
it ran smoothly in the 3 smallest screens. Upgrade a bit to an A1200/030,
50Mhz/8mb and you can run doom in full screen smoothly.

to plan we should hopefully have Genetic Species in for review.
Another game that we will DEFINATLY be reviewing is the excellent
'The Strangers' game that we just recived today, the day issue 9

@{fg shine} Lambda Preview@{fg text}

 Lambda is a new basic shell of a game that hopefully the author
will complete. It is based around those Tiefighter games you
see on many other platforms like Playstaton and PC but we have
yet to have a good conversion of one of these games on our lovely
Amiga.

 At the moment you cannot do very much but the small demo that
you can play around with gives you an idea that if the author
could finish this game it would boost the Amiga comunity. While
flying around you see other ships which have been 3d rendered
and have a nice shiney touch to them. There are also various
asteriods floating around the screen and the stars and sun
give off good effects when you fly past them.

 If you have downloaded this game or even if you havn't please
fill in this form that AIO has decided to run and email it to
the author as alot of people would like to see this finished.

----*CUT*----
Dear Author,
    I am returning the form that was recently featured in an
issue of Amiga Info Online which can be downloaded from the
Aminet in Docs/Mags under the name AIOV9.lha
 I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOUR LAMBDA GAME FINISHED SO PLEASE 
COMPLETE THIS GAME AS IT IS EXCELLENT!

@node "gr2" "The Final Odyssey"

@{fg shine} Vulcan's The Final Odyssey@{fg text}

 The Final Odyssey is the 3rd in the Mega series of Vulcans
CD games, first was Strangers, second was Uropa 2 reviewed
two issues ago and now this. There are two different versions
of the final odyssey, one for 68000 and one for 68020 which
is faster and more detailed, the intro is also better. You
can either load stright into the game or load via the intro,
as it seems with all Vulcans cd games so far you get a 3D
rendered intro. The intro tells the story of your mission and
gives a bit of background information on whats going on, in
my opinion the intro is not as good as the Uropa one but
it is still very nice and worth a look for first time playing.

 The first thing that strikes you once the game is loaded is 
the graphics and how well animated they are, the screen scrolls 
nice and smooth and the graphics are very carefully detailed 
and have alot of colour in them. The background sound fx and
music are also very nice and you can tell the time and effort
that has been put into them has been enourmous.

 The idea of the game is to get through the 5 massive worlds
to end up reaching the 5 girls that you are supposed to rescue
and then kill the Minotaur. Along the way you find various
objects like money, food, extra energy, extra lives and extra
weapons to collect. There are also puzzles that need to be 
solved before you can proceed, it is best to save the game
before you continue to try at a puzzle because sometimes if
you mess the puzzle up there is no way to re-try at it
without starting again. Aswell as puzzles there will be
pads/switches on the floor that will open and active other
parts in the level like open doors or remove force fields,
some of the more smaller floor pads that are not as easy to spot
can trigger enemys from the floor to shoot at you, others
can spring big boulders which come rolling towards you, luckly
there are usually little dips in the wall which you can dodge
into to save getting hit. After wondering around the first
level you will be quite pleased about acheiving all the puzzles
that have been thrown at you, but it is when you start getting
into that game that you are puzzled on what to do next, so you
just keep on trudging around hoping to find something that
you have missed, then it will occour to you that you have missed
something, forgottend to pick something up or just not done something
right and then you will be off again exploring further depts of
the game.

 The levels are very big in total so the game is like all Vulcans
games, going to last you a long time and for the price of £29.99
is will be a very good investment. The 3D isometric angle also
works very well and gives the game a bit of a twist that hasn't
been seen in Amiga games that many times before. The Final
Odyssey will also apeal to anyone who hasn't seen a good game since
early amiga days as this will take you right back with good
old gameplay but with more up-to-date graphics and sounds.

 The game supports the following languages :- English, German,
Italian, Spanish, Norwegian, Finnish & Danish. It also doesn't
require that much computer power for such a nice polished game.
The basic requirements are :- Any Amiga, Hard Drive, 68000cpu,
2mb Memory (1mb Chip, 1mb Any), 2 x CD-Rom. The game will
utilise any other power that you throw at it, so the better
the computer, the better that game is going to be.

 The only problems I occured where that there seemed to be a few
bugs that are one offs and sometimes happen but do not always.
They do not course major havok with the gameplay but very rarely
they can leave puzzles unfinishable which is alright if you
have just saved close by, but if you havn't you'll have to do
everything over again to get back to that part of the game.

 Overall another nice game by Vulcan, the graphics are very
detailed and you can obviously see the amount of work that
Vulcan and Peter Spinaze has put in. A top notch game that
is well worth buying, it will last you ages and although
it is not going to amaze your PC owning chumbs with its push
the amiga to the limit hardware requirements it will definatly
keep you playing for ages and with hours of excitment.

@{fg shine} ThinkCool@{fg text}

 ThinkCool is another game of guess the number between 0 and
100, which has been done a gazillion times before and some
of you may know that I have myself wrote a version of this
game but AHEM we won't go into that any more...

 The parameters on ThinkCool cannot be changed so you can
only guess between 0 and 100. TC is run on a shell window
and is very basic. It is a nice game to play while your
bored or waiting for something to copy but otherwise don't
bother. One of the main problems is the author expects
you to get answers like 60.5 so if you type 60 and it says
higher then you type 61 and it says lower you've got to
start guessing between 60.1 and 60.9 which makes the game
bloody imposible sometime and the fact that you only have
10 trys before the game quits makes it a bit anoying.

 The game is nice to play in the background, it is small and
doesn't take up hardly any memory. On the other hand if
your impatiant or want thousands of options avoid this like
the plague!

@{fg shine} Supertron '97@{fg text}

 Tron has always been one of my favourite games, and tron the film is
also one of my favourite films, so when someone writes a new tron game
I jump at the chance to download it. Although the name suggests that
SuperTron '97 is a year old it was actually finished in '98 which
seems a bit strange... but anyway.

 Supertron is a nice looking tron game with up to four players either
all computer, all human or a mixture, say one human and three computers.
Playing against the computer players is nothing like playing two player
as with the computer controlled aponents you can tell they are to
unreal the way they move. The excitment starts when you play two player
with loads of obsticals and exits. You can choice how many obsticals
you want and also how many exits up to four.

 There isn't alot to say, nice menu and around screen graphics but
tron is tron really and with no real new ideas added into this version
it is not worth bothering over if you already have a version you
are satisfied with. Overall a nice polished game, but onces you've
seen one tron you've seen them all.

@{fg shine} Games reviews and what there score means@{fg text}

 Games are reviewed mostly on playability and how long they will last
you, although some big games with fancy graphics might be expected to
get good reviews it is not always the case. A small 10k game might
get a better overall score than a 1Mb game. It is not that the 1Mb
game isn't any good it's just that the playablility might be non
exsistant and there is no point in downloading a huge file if it
will last a couple of minutes and you will only run it to show off
to friends.

 90%+    -  AIO GOLD (amazing)

 70-89%  -  Nice but some let downs

 50-69%  -  Not to good but it'll do

@{fg shine} Fast Virus Killer V1.14@{fg text}

 Last month A.I.O reviewed Fast Virus Killer V1.12 and a repeat of last 
month the author D Jones, is again, back with a new version to kill and 
rid your HD and disks of those things computer boffins call viruses.
[ED- OI who are you calling computer boffins ;)]

 Well, whats new? Here is what the author says:

- My ZIB removal code was breaking most files, as it wasn't repairing all
  the branches to the virus code, only the last one in the file.
  Sorry for any damaged files.
- Fixed BioMechanic6 Recognition, sorry to anyone who deleted any files
  due to this mistake, but I had only one executable to work from :-(
- All file check routines overhauled to handle large code hunks.

 A bug fix, yes, thats what this version is, but, again the Virus Checker 
reaches a high standard, its fast, it knows alot of virii, bootblock and 
file, even more than what I can list here, but its funny that there 
are some bootblock virus' because you can only check files for virii.

 Luckly there was no Happy New Year `98 virus, will it be in the next 
version of is there not going to be one this year?? Maybe the next version 
Mr. Jones?

 I don`t think there are as many virus' supported as the VirusZ program, 
also available from the aminet, but hey, VirusZ is not small and fast, but 
at least VirusZ can check other things than files.

[V1.16 has been released now, due to the rapid updating of FVK we will
not be featuring it for a while until a major update is released]

if you have still got an A500 your a bit behind mate!

 There are some documents included, but they are not in English, so I can`t
read them, uggghhh! Oh well, you don`t really need Docs in an Icon Package,
do you?

 And here follows a message to the author: Although this is just Volume 1, 
how about a few more icons, and documents in English?

@{fg shine} CleverWIN@{fg text}

 The AmigaOS knows two methods of refreshing the contents of a window.
The first one (simple refresh) is slow but only requires a small amount of 
memory, whereas the second one (smart refresh) is much faster, but 
requires a larger amount of memory. 

 CleverWIN is small patch which forces all programs to open their windows
in smartrefresh mode. Unfortunatly, there are some programs which do not 
work correctly when smartrefresh is used, for this purpose CleverWIN
allows you exclude certain tasks and pubscreens from getting patched. This 
is especially useful for the shell which only feature cut'n'paste in 
simplerefresh mode.

 So, thats what it is, but is it any good? Well, I did not notice any speed
changes, but then maybe my system is already slow enough! (A1200 2mb RAM)

 Its a nice idea and you can specify many different tooltypes all explained
in the docs. The program is also easy to install, just click on its icon or
copy it to  your WBStartup drawer, to remove it, just click on the icon 
again, easy??

@{fg shine} Fast Assign Plus V3.05@{fg text}

 Fast Assign Plus, renamed from a previous version called Fast Assign, is 
a short assembly program which assign's most WB assigns in one command. 

 The Source is also included so you can add your own assigns which makes 
this program a good buy, it will replace the following commands:

        makedir ram:T
        makedir ram:env
        Assign >NIL: ENV: ram:ENV
        Assign >NIL: T: RAM:T

        Assign >NIL: LOCALE: SYS:Locale
        Assign >NIL: HELP: dh0:Help DEFER

 This is a good program for all you disk compilers or software writers out 
there, this is going in my Workbench S:Startup-Sequence, so it must be 
good! Its quite fast as well.

 The only down side is that you get a message come up in the AmigaDOS CLI 
when you use it, and if you are loading Workbench you get an annoying 
little message telling you to close the CLI!

@{fg shine} MUI Requester V0.9b@{fg text}

 MRQ is a MUI-based system patch that tries to do everything the well-known
requester improver "ARQ" by Martin J. Laubach does - and a lot more.

 Here are just a few of the features:-

- Configurable like every MUI program (fonts, frames, group layout, ...)

- Complete keyboard control just like ARQ - the leftmost button reacts on
  "Return", rightmost on "Esc", and all buttons can be operated via the
  function keys (F1-F10 from left to right).

- Can decorate the left- and rightmost button with a green checkmark and a
  red X for "OK" and "Cancel" respectively

- Every image can be combined with an ARexx command, both command and port
  are configurable so you can send messages to any program when a 
  particular requester pops up, even start programs or shellscripts  
  through ARexx's system interface.

 As I don`t have M.U.I on my system I could not try it out, but what I 
found in the archive, a load of quality images, all about the size of a 
standard WB icon, these images, I assume are for the buttons on the MRQ 
requesters, but they are good, this package is well worth downloading just 
for the images!

 Looking through the documentation it looks like it is quite difficult to 
install, not for the beginner, it is a shame that there is no installer to 
go with the massive Amiga Guide docs.

 ADSGE or in proper words Amiga Doom Save Game Editor does
exactly what the name suggests. Now that Doom has been released
on the Amiga you can probably expect to see a few utils which
will do something or other to doom.

 This is the very first util i have seen to do anything to doom
so far. It lets you select the amount of Bullets, Shells,
Rockets, Cells & Health. It also allows you to have all the
three colour keys and every single weapon available. The main
good thing about ADSGE is that you can alter the maximum amount
of bullets or rockets or whatever to be 999 insted of the usual
set 200.

 Thats all there is really to it but this is an excellent util
and well worth a download. Now you wouldn't get that on the
PC would you! Nice work Mr.Tickle!!!

@node "ur7" "Passcode"

@{fg shine} Passcode V1.0@{fg text}

 Passcode is one of those password protection programs for your
HD or any disk you want but this is quite good and it unlike any 
other program i have seen so far. It is only a small program but
that is why it makes this one better, it is around 35k so won't
use up much space on small HDs or disks with a small space limit.

 The idea of passcode is once you've run it you can enter your
'Username' then your 'Password' and click on go, the screen will
now be blacked and a little requestor at the top of the screen
will ask you for your 'Username' and 'Password' you can click
anywhere on the screen but it will tell you that you haven't
entered the correct information so there is no way to brake out
of this program or quit it without resetting or entering the
correct 'Username' and 'Password' Once you have entered your
username and password the program will shut down and let you continue
with whatever you are doing. Passcode V1.0 is VERY useful as if
your writting and important document or sorting out an important
interview or competition for AIO ;) You can go and answer the
door or make a cup of tea without having to switch the computer off
or worry about anyone seeing what your doing while your not
there.

 Overall this is a great program and i can't wait to see later
version which will hopefully enclude things like time and date
logs of when a password was wrong and what the FAKE user tryed
to brake in with, also someway to store a password so you could
use this from bootup. If the author was VERY adventures he could
even add things like if one user enters there password and
user name they can only get into there own partition on the HD and
if say there brother enters there own username and password he
could only get into his own partition so thus locking out the otherones
partition to keep it safe.

 Utils are not marked on how good they are compared to other utils,
they are marked by usefulness and what purpose they serve. As there
are so many different utils that do so many different things it is
hard to review something like MUI and then when reviewing a program
like a WB clock say it wasn't up to the standard of MUI. This is why
it is not possible to have a Top Ten list for utils.

@node "fe1" "Interview"

@{fg shine} Weird Science Interview@{fg text}

 This month were back with another outstanding interview, this time
with Weird Science, well enough of this dribble on with reading the
interview!!!

CS : How long has Weird Science been running and how did it
     first start up?

Weird Science was established about 5 years ago to produce Amiga CD-ROMS.
Our first CD-ROM was Multimedia Toolkit CD.

CS : Do you solely sell Amiga products or do you also support
     other platforms?

We have a limited PC range, mostly default as a lot of the Amiga titles are
also PC compatible.  Lightrom 5 for instance.

CS : What would Weird Science like to see in a new Amiga?

060 Processor with upgrade path to PPC.
Zorro 3 slots with ISA and PCI active slots.
This means that the PCI and ISA should be able to talk to the Amiga opening
the doors for PC add-on cards, like sound and video cards.
4 x 72 pin Simm Slots.
Scan doubler built in so that all Amiga modes work on standard SVGA
monitors.

CS : What does Weird Science think of the Amiga buyout by
     Gateway2000?

We are pleased that the Amiga has found such a powerful ally in the computer
world.  We would hope that they use their influence to persuade companies to
support the Amiga further, similar to Epson supplying drivers.  We would
need a lot of other companies to supply drivers for their equipment or at
least to supply help.

CS : Could you tell us a little bit about the Vulcan distributation?

The deal is quite simply in that we are better geared up for both Worldwide
distribution and Retail of Amiga products and Vulcan are best suited to
publishing top Amiga games so it is an obvious partnership.  We will be
offering the entire Vulcan range and Vulcan are free to devote more time to
development.

CS : Are you planning to release your own games like other companys
     have started doing?

We are working with other companies on distribution of their games.  We are
for instance now the world wide distributors of OnEscapee and Foundation
with a lot more to follow.  We feel that this is the way forward for us at
the present time.  We would only publish a top game.

CS : Can we count on your support for the Amiga?

About 90% of our business is Amiga and we are keen to see the Amiga grow
again.  We have great confidence in the Amiga and thus will continue to
support the platform with new releases during 1998.

CS : Can you tell us about any of your new products you have planned?

We have several new products for 1998, unfortunately the only one I can
freely discuss is Assassins 4 CD.  The prvious 3 Assassins CDs all scored
95% in Amiga Format with Amiga Format Gold awards along with CU Amiga Super
Star awards and CD of the month for Assassins 3.  Number 4 will even better
still.

CS : Do you have any special offers for the New year?

We are continuing our free CDs with orders over 25.00 and we are extending
this to a free game with orders over 25.00 of games.

CS : What do you think needs to be done for the Amiga to survive?

More power, better graphics and more titles.  Most of this is available now
but people do not upgrade so developers are reticent to develop high spec
games.  Then people buy a PC, doesn't figure.

CS : Thanks for your time!

@{fg shine} Tatung CM14UHR Monitor Review@{fg text}

PRODUCT NAME

  Using your Amiga with a Tatung CM14UHR

BRIEF DESCRIPTION

  A 14" Ultra VGA Colour Monitor.
 
LIST PRICE

  R 1024.00              ( £7.52 = R1.00 )

MACHINE USED FOR TESTING

  Amiga A1200 (PAL)
  2M chip ram
  Connor 210M ide hard drive
  Commodore 23->15pin VGA Adaptor
  
INSTALLATION

  Just plug the 15pin Cable in the VGA adaptor and steal a PC power 
cable to plug the monitor directly into a power socket.
  Add VGAonly and a suitable screenmode driver (DoublePAL, Multiscan etc.)
to your Startup-sequence. Then configure the new mode in the Screenmode 
Prefs to your desired Resolution.
  All that is needed now is to resize the Picture with the Horizontal & 
Vertical adjuster knobs to fill the Blank spaces.
  And voila! a new Crisp High Resolution Non-Flickering Workbench.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS

  The monitor was of a good quality and very sturdy. After Installation
I was impressed with my Workbench : Crisp 640 x 512 No-Flicker .
 At last the Magic Workbench Icons looked good. DTP has a new meaning and
in DeluxePaint IV I could see each pixel even in 640 x 512.

REVIEW

  I was in 7th Heaven the first couple of hours while I was busy 
reconfiguring all my Workbench Apps. Personal Paint didn't like my new 
Monitor and opened in 15khz (PAL) everytime. As I had a small B&W TV still 
attached it wasn't anything but a hassle to change the Screenmode to DblPAL.
  I later solved the problem by downloading "PPrefs" from AMINET. This
ScreenPromotion Utility is better than Commodore's and is very easy to use.
 All my Apps worked except:
   - Image FX ver.1.5
   - OctaMED 5 : The Channel BARS disappeared!

A intersting note on DblPAL is that it halves your already small AGA band-
width because it uses a very stupid scandoubling routine. Therefore your
graphics performance under DblPAL is going to suffer.

  Then came a major shock when I tried to access the Startup Menu on 
rebooting. It was ALSO in 15khz!! Well, once again AMINET proved useful and 
I downloaded "AAStarter" which solved that little problem.

  Offcourse this NO-15khz can be directly transated into NO-Games even with
a ScreenPromoter because most games hit the hardware directly. So I had to
resort to my B&W TV for playing games.

  After a few weeks I decide to read the manual and saw that my Monitor
have a horizontal Sync Rate of 30khz -> 50khz and a vertical Scan Rate of 
50hz-100hz. I then used MonED ( On the AMINET ) to optimise my Screenmode 
Driver. It worked ( It's an Amiga, what do you expect. )

  Overall I like my new Monitor and I will never switch back to a TV again.
Pity about the OS-illegal games. ( I will always have the B&W TV )

Interesting note: Grand Prix's Menus work but the game doesn't ? 

DOCUMENTATION

  A Standard Monitor manual with Specifications, TroubleShooting,
    Pin Connections and Timing Charts.

LIKES

  High Resolution Applications and Workbench. No more sore eyes!

DISLIKES

  No 15khz Support therefore : NO GAMES !

SUGGESTIONS

  Tatung will probably not make the monitor 15khz compatible as it is aimed
at the  PC- Market. A VGA Adaptor with the necessary hardware to ScanDouble
15khz to 31khz can't be too diffucult.  
 ( Check AMINET: hard/hack/scandoubler.lha )

[ Do anyone know if a Software memory patch can do scandoubling on Hardware
  System level ? ]

CONCLUSIONS

  A Cheap and essential upgrade for all serious Amiga users. Ban the TV!

@node "fe3" "PulsarNET"

@{fg shine} NEW amiga IRC network@{fg text}

  WHAT IS PULSARNET? 

   PulsarNet is an IRC network much like IRCnet, EFnet, Undernet, etc. It is 
   composed of IRC Servers around the world for the purpose of connecting 
   people in a relay based network for chatting, sending files, or whatever
   you like.


  OK, SO WHY PULSARNET?

   You may be asking yourself, why do we need PulsarNet when there already
   are lot of other irc-nets. Well, there are many reasons that we could
   list to show why PulsarNet is the best choice, but here are a few things
   which we are better on than other nets:

	§  LESS LAG!
	§  LESS NETSPLITS!
	§  No channel takeovers!¹
	§  No one else can use YOUR nick!²
	§  Most server administrators are friendly! :)
	§  Longer Nicknames
   ¹ Channel takeovers are as good as not possible because we run ChanServ.

   ² By registering your nick at the NickServ, so no one can use your nick
     while you aren't connected to PulsarNet.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  HOW DO I REGISTER MY NICK?
  
   You have first to be connected to PulsarNet, and you have to choose a
   nick you want to use and a password and there after you have to write
   following two lines:

                        /msg nickserv addnick [your nick] [password]
                        /msg nickserv auth [your nick] [password]

   Now you have registered your nickname, for more help just type:

                        /msg nickserv showcommands

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  HOW DO I REGISTER MY OWN CHANNEL?

   Just join the channel you want to register, e.g. "/join #f1" and then
   type the following line:
   
                        /msg chanserv register
                        
   You can add users who will be automatically oped and lot more too, to
   get more information about the other commands to use, just type this:
   
                        /msg chanserv showcommands
                        
   If you happen to be moving a larger channel from another irc-net, then we
   can offer you webspace for the channels homepage. 

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  IS IT ALLOWED TO RUN BOTS AT PULSARNET?

   Yes most servers allows people to run 1 bot, but before you let your bot to 
   connect, do always ask the channels owner if it's ok for him/her that you
   bring your bot to that channel.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  CAN I CONNECT MY OWN SERVER TO PULSARNET?
  
   We are always happy to get a new server to our net, and even more happy
   if you already have users. There are a few rules which must be satisfied
   
   	§ The servers internet connection should be at least 128kb/s
   	§ The server shall be run 24h

   Do always try to take contact with lEATHERFACE if you want to join us.
   
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  WHAT DO I DO IF I GET PROBLEMS?
  
   Join the #opers channel, here you will find all the administrators and
   co-administrators for the servers. We will always try to help you as much
   as possible.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The number of PulsarNet server is growing and we will try to update the 
   serverlist as fast as possible. When you connect to PulsarNet, surf to
   http://www.tpcom.technolink.com to see the latest serverlist. Try to
   remember to connect to the closest server to you, so that you will not
   slow down the net.

@{fg shine} 4x IDE CD-rom Review@{fg text}

 Now that it is common for quite alot of todays amiga owners
to have a Cd-rom i though it was time that i finally bought
one, so i whipped out my christmas money and took advantage
of the BRILLIANT offer from Eyetech. For £99.99 & £10 p&p
you got the 4 way IDE buffer, 4x cd-rom (in case), the power
pack and the required cables to connect the cd-rom and the 
interface, all this is something that would normally cost around
£160 at the cheapest maybe even more. Eyetech where absolutly
excellent by getting the Cd-rom to me on Christmas Eve the
last day of posting so full marks for that. The only problem
is that they forgot to send one of the required cables
which twisted from the HD to the IDE buffer, luckly I had
the same type of cable but not twisty and just about managed
to make the cable reach (something i would NOT recommend)
Anyway onto the actual Cd-rom itself.

 The cd-rom worked fine with no problems, it works pretty
fast for a 4x cd-rom and most amiga CD games that are out
only seem to require a 4x cd-rom anyway. You can do all the
usual things like use Amiga Cds, Play CD³² games and also
listen to music cds with crystal clear sound.

 Overall this is a great package and also a great offer
from Eyetech, one that MUST be taken up!

@node "fe5" "Amigs Future"

@{fg shine} Amigas Future by Utils Ed@{fg text}

Where does the Amiga go from here? What is it's future? who knows?
Well these are the questions on every Amiga loving persons minds at the
moment. These are STILL uncertain times for our beloved machines, but I
believe there IS a chance that the Amiga star can shine brightly again.
Gateway 2000 have been slow to announce the future to us, slow to
decide which CPU to use to power it's heart, but I think this is a wise
move, and can only be regarded as proof that they only have the
machines best interests at heart. The Amiga's OS has always been one of
it's greatest assets, and this needs to make the jump to the new CPU
easily and efficiently. This is why there has been a delay in choosing
which road to go down. Motorola's PowerPC still seems to be the best
choice, as it maintains a close working relationship between Amiga's
and Motorola, but other chips are also very capable of giving huge
MIPS and other such figures. Whichever CPU platform is chosen, then
Gateway will need to port the OS quickly, and also make accelerators
etc. avalable for older A1200's and A4000's quickly, so people can port
software over. For example, no ported version of MUI, would waste the
potential of so many programs, that a new go faster Amiga wouldn't be
worth jack s**t! May'be Gateway should bite the bullet and go down the
PowerPC path, as accelerators already exist with these processors!
 Anyway, whichever path is chosen, I believe that Gateway will make a
decent decision, and make a new quantum leap forward for Amiga's
everywhere. However, they must make PCI and/or AGP slots part of the
equation. If they can include working slots like these into the
motherboard, and get some drivers out quickly for GFX cards like the
S3 ViRGE chipset, Matrox Mystique and a few others, then Amiga's will
be able to hold their own against PC's etc. They will need to keep the
original chipset, so people can still use the excellent TV output, and
genlock facilities it provides, but enable people to have a choice. I
mean an S3 ViRGE GFX card is about 25-30 UK pounds to buy, and whilst
being squarely at the bottom of the PC 3D GFX card market, it is vastly
superior to most (if not ALL) Amiga cards available. Also plugin sound
cards are fairly cheap that use PCI slots, and I'm sure that an Amiga
whizz could bang up a driver fairly quickly!
I'm a die-hard Amiga fanatic, but even I've got hold of a fairly high
spec PC recently, as my Amiga get's left behind in it's wake. I
wouldn't dream of deserting the platform completely, but I'm spending
as much time on my PC, as I do on my Amiga - something I wouldn't dream
I'd be doing this time last year...
So, to those people who doubt the Amiga's future - remember this. Not
many platforms would have survived recent problems to still be around
today, and not many platforms have such a loyal user base. The Amiga
is STILL thriving in the German market, and looks certain to continue
to do so for a few more years to come. So come on Gateway 2000! Let's
get this "new" Amiga out and start the ball rolling again. Let's not
let Bill Gates get ALL the glory!

@{fg shine} A1200 Hardware Frequently Asked Questions@{fg text}

Version 2.1 - Copyright (C) 1997 by Warren Block

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distribution

This document is freeware. It has been copyrighted to assure its
availability to everyone. Fred Fish and the Aminet are explicitly
allowed to include this document in CD-ROM or floppy compilations;
others should ask first. Please do not modify this file without
permission.


Disclaimer

errors, omissions, and outright lies, and is not guaranteed to do

of reach of demo coders.


Introduction

After putting together a much fancier document for the A4000 (the Amiga
4000 Hardware Guide), it was suggested that something similar was needed
for the A1200. Additionally, I kept seeing the same questions asked over
and over in comp.sys.amiga.hardware, and it seemed like a FAQ might help
both those asking and answering the questions. Maybe it'll just change
all the answers to say "Read the FAQ, you moron." Nah. Amiga people are
more polite than that. They'd say "PLEASE read the FAQ, you moron."
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introductory Questions

Q. I have a problem with my A1200. Can I email or call you for help?
A. I'd rather you ask any questions that aren't answered here in a
public forum in one of the comp.sys.amiga.* newsgroups. That way, you
can draw on more experience than just my own (which is admittedly
somewhat limited with the A1200), and the answers can benefit others
with similar problems.

Q. Hey! You left out many details on some of these topics.
A. That was intentional; some of these answers have been simplified,
both to keep this document relatively short, and to avoid confusing the
issues. Please remember that this is an introductory document, and not a
technical reference guide, and is intended merely to answer the most
common questions. So there. Nyah.

Q. Hey, FAQ boy, you screwed up, and some of this information is wrong,
or you just didn't include something that was completely obvious! Can I
send you email with the correct information?
A. Yes, please do. Email me at wblock@rapidnet.com.

Thank you for your interest, and good luck with your A1200!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Power Supply

Q. Is the stock A1200 power supply adequate for an accelerator, extra
RAM, and bigger hard disks?

A. Probably not. The stock supply is only rated at 23 watts. While you
may be able to get the computer to boot with expansion hardware, it may
not operate reliably.


Q. I want to build a "super power supply" for my A1200. What are the
pinouts of the power supply connector?

A. Look on the power supply itself, where the pinouts are usually (but
not always) specified. If they aren't there, check the hard/hack or
hard/misc directories of Aminet.


Q. Can I use an Amiga 500 or Amiga 600 power supply with my A1200?

A. Yes. The connectors and voltages match perfectly.


Q. What about the higher watt rating of the A500 supply? Won't all that
extra power melt and/or blow up my A1200?

A. No. The watt rating of a power supply only describes the absolute
maximum amount of power it can supply. The A1200 will only draw as much
of this as it needs to operate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Floppy Drives

Q. Can I use an IBM high density drive on an A1200?

A. Not easily, simply, or reliably.  There are some hacks that allow
this, but, as of this writing, they all still have problems, and can be
considered experimental. If you're determined to try, there are several
plans in the hard/hack section on Aminet. An easier solution is to
purchase one of the commercially-available high-density drives from an
Amiga dealer.


Q. Can I read and write Amiga diskettes on a PC clone?

A. No. The floppy controller hardware on most clones is incapable of
reading or writing the Amiga disk format. To transfer files on disk
between a PC clone and an A1200, use 3.5-inch double-density floppies
formatted in the 720K MS-DOS format. The A1200 can read and write these
using CrossDOS (included with AmigaDOS 3.0).


Q. Can I use high-density floppies with the A1200's normal disk drive?

A. Not reliably! The high-density disks need a stronger magnetic field
from the disk heads to reliably write to them. A high-density drive does
this automatically, but the A1200's double-density drive can't. Writing
high-density disks with a double-density drive will result in erratic
operation of those disks. They may work fine for hours, days, or weeks,
only to fail when you need them most. Use double-density disks with
Amiga double-density (880K) drives, like the one built into the A1200,
or get an external or internal high-density Amiga drive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hard Drives

Q. Why doesn't my A1200 boot off the hard drive when I first turn it on?

A. Many hard drives don't spin up fast enough to be ready when the A1200
is ready to boot. If you can reset the A1200 after it comes up with the
purple "insert floppy" screen and it will then boot from the hard drive,
this is the case. The easiest solution is to just live with it and reset
the machine when you first turn it on. If this really bothers you, you
could replace the drive with one that spins up faster. Alternatively,
AmigaOS 3.1 (if your A1200 doesn't already have it) has a longer IDE
drive delay.


Q. When I first power-up my A1200, the hard drive works fine, but after
a reset the hard drive is no longer recognized. What's wrong?

A. This is a problem with the way the drive handles the IDE reset
signal. The easy fix is to cut pin 1 on the IDE cable (usually the one
with the stripe), peel back the wires a little, and tape them off,
disconnecting the reset signal. This problem is commonly reported on
Conner hard drives (although I don't feel it's a significant flaw).


Q. How hard is it to install a hard drive inside my A1200?

A. It's not hard. You need a few things: a 2.5-inch IDE hard drive
(commonly used for notebook computers), a short section of special
44-pin ribbon cable to fit the drive (this cable is spaced more tightly
than normal ribbon), and, preferably, the Commodore Install disk. First,
you install the drive, then use the Install disk to partition it and
place the system software on it. That's it. The toughest part is
obtaining the Install disk and the special cable.


Q. Should I low-level format the hard drive?

A. No. On both IDE and SCSI drives, an initial low-level format has been
performed at the factory. You should never need to low-level format them
again. After partitioning, you *do* need to "high-level" format a hard
drive with the AmigaDOS Format command; when used with hard drives, you
can specify the QUICK keyword with the Format command to speed up this
high-level formatting immensely.
(Example: Format drive dh2: name "Sample" quick noicons.)


Q. Can I use a 3.5-inch hard drive inside my A1200?

A. Yes, but be warned. Physically, it can be made to fit; but problems
can arise from the extra power consumption of the 3.5-inch drives,
coupled with the anemic stock power supply of the A1200. Obtaining a
cable to adapt the 44-pin high-density IDE cable to the 40-pin
normal-density IDE connector can be difficult, and finding jumper
documentation for 2.5-inch drives is often impossible. Electronically,
though, they are compatible. See the hard/hack directory of Aminet for
projects.


Q. Can I use an "EIDE" or "Fast ATA" hard drive with the A1200?

A. Yes. These drives are merely refined IDE drives.


Q. Will large-capacity (500M and up) drives work with the A1200?

A. Yes. The 500M capacity "limitation" originates from the PC clones,
and is only a problem with them. For the Amiga, you can safely go up to
a 4G (~4000M) hard drive.


Q. What is MaxTransfer?

A. MaxTransfer is a value (set in HDToolBox) that limits how much data
can be transferred to or from the hard drive at one time.


Q. Why is MaxTransfer needed? Shouldn't the drive move as much data at
one time as possible?

A. Yes, it should, but some hard drives have arbitrary limits on how
much data they can move at one time. On the Amiga, if you have problems
transferring files of 128K or larger to or from the hard drive, this is
a likely cause of the problem.


Q. I have have no idea what the MaxTransfer value should be for my
drive. What value should I use?

A. For unknown drives, the maximum "safe" value is 0x0001FE00. Other
(older) drives may require 0x0000FFFF or even 0x0000FE00. The sure test
is to copy files larger than the MaxTransfer value to and from the
drive, checking for corruption afterwards. Pictures work well for this,
as corruption is easy to detect.


Q. Will this low MaxTransfer value slow down disk transfers?

A. Very little or not at all. Most disk transfers are smaller than 128K,
and so this setting will not affect them. But don't take my word for it;
use DiskSpeed and test it yourself.


Q. What is Mask?

A. Mask is a value (set in HDToolBox) that determines what area of
memory can be used to buffer data transfers to or from the hard drive.
Unless you have a good reason to change it, leave it at the default
setting in HDToolBox.


Q. What 2.5-inch IDE hard drives are known to work with the A1200?

A. Most do, although you may have to adjust the MaxTransfer value (see
above). I personally dislike the Seagate drives included with many
A1200s (which seem to be of low quality), but they work fine for many
people. My own Toshiba worked fine, although, like many drives, it had
the slow spin-up problem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

CD-ROM Drives

Q. What SCSI CD-ROM drives work with the A1200?

A. First you need a SCSI interface, like the SCSI interface built into
certain accelerators, or a PCMCIA SCSI card like the Squirrel. Some SCSI
controllers have been reported to have trouble with certain drives, but
in general, the Toshiba, Sony, and NEC drives have been reported to work
well with the Amiga. Personally, I can verify that the NEC 3Xe works
fine with the Dataflyer SCSI+ interface.


Q. Can an EIDE CD-ROM drive be used with the built-in IDE of the A1200?

A. Yes, provided the drive is a true EIDE drive. Most non-SCSI CD-ROM
drives are not IDE, but a "sort-of" IDE. Newer drives are EIDE, and
these can be made to work on the A1200. It requires an ATAPI driver (a
demo version of one is available on Aminet) and the 44-to-40-pin adapter
cable. My opinion: SCSI gives you much more for your money, because you
can use the SCSI bus for other things in addition to CD-ROM drives. Some
accelerator boards have SCSI ports, offering an all-in-one solution.


Q. What software do I need to access a CD-ROM drive?

A. Frank Munkert's excellent AmiCDROM filesystem, or the one that comes
with AmigaDOS 3.1. AmiCDROM works extremely well on both ISO 9660 and
HFS (Macintosh) CD-ROM discs, and it's free. Look for it on Aminet:
disk/cdrom/AmiCDROM-1.15.lha.

Q. I need more information on CD-ROM disks, drives, and interfaces,
especially as they relate to the Amiga. Where can I look?

A. There is an excellent overview of the subject by Joachim E. Deu en on
Aminet. Look at the file docs/help/CDROM20.lha.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Processors

Q. What is the 68EC020 processor that comes inside the A1200?

A. It is an inexpensive version of the 68020, in a Plastic Leaded Chip
Carrier (PLCC) package. The only electronic difference between this
processor and the 68020 is that the EC version only brings out signals
for 24-bit addressing. Internally, it is fully 32-bit.


Q. What's the difference between the 68EC030 and 68030 processors that
come with accelerator boards?

A. The two are physically the same, with the difference being that a
68030 has a functional Memory Management Unit built into it, which the
EC ("Embedded Controller") version lacks. The MMU is useful for
programmers (for debugging purposes), allows running Unix systems like
NetBSD, and also can be used to remap Kickstart code, allowing the
system to run faster (in some cases--this depends on the individual
system, accelerator board, and memory).


Q. Are there any 68040 or 68060 accelerators for the A1200?

A. Yes, there are several. A 68060 is desirable, since it'll generate
much less heat inside the A1200 case. Other features to look for are
SCSI interfaces and more than one SIMM socket.


Q. Can I replace the 68EC020 that comes with the A1200 with a full
68020?

A. Not directly, no. The 68EC020 is soldered onto the A1200 motherboard,
and even if it weren't, the 68020 differs physically from it. The best
way to perform this upgrade is with one of the many inexpensive
accelerator boards.


Q. Can I replace a 68EC030 with a 68030 with an MMU?

A. Yes, as long as they're physically the same. Some 68030s are Pin Grid
Array (PGA) packages, and some are Plastic Leaded Chip Carrier (PLCC).
With the PGA type, you can carefully and gently pry the old chip out of
the socket and then replace it with the new one. Some PLCC chips may be
soldered down, some may be in sockets. If it's in a socket, yes, you can
replace it, but you should get the proper removal tool to avoid breaking
the socket.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Memory

Q. What do I need to expand the memory of my A1200?

A. You'll need either a RAM board or an accelerator board, either of
which will fit into the trap-door expansion port on the bottom of the
A1200, and will have sockets for memory expansion. Some expansion boards
made by GVP use custom SIMM modules, which are hard to find and much
more expensive than standard 72-pin SIMMs.


Q. My accelerator or RAM board has one or more 72-pin sockets for memory
SIMMs. Can I use 72-pin SIMMs meant for PC clones?

A. Yes. Read on for more details.


Q. Some 72-pin SIMMs are 36-bit and some are 32-bit. Is this related to
"parity," and which do I need to use with the A1200?

A. PC clones use extra "parity" bits for double-checking memory. On the
A1200, these extra bits will simply be ignored, causing no problems. The
extra four bits on the 36-bit wide SIMMs are these parity bits. Most
current systems don't use parity, so 32-bit SIMMs are adequate. Summing
up: 36- or 32-bit wide SIMMs--which is just another way of saying "with
or without parity bits"--will work for accelerators or RAM expansion
boards with 72-pin SIMM sockets.


Q. I've seen SIMMs with speed ratings of 60, 70, and 80 ns. What does
this mean, and which do I need?

A. These numbers rate the speed at which the SIMM can be reliably
operated. A 60 ns SIMM is the fastest currently available at reasonable
prices. To keep a processor running at its fastest rate, the memory
needs to be able to keep up with it; the speed of your processor
determines the minimum memory speed needed. For an A1200 with just a RAM
expansion board, 80 ns SIMMs are fast enough. With an accelerator, it
depends on how fast the processor is going, so you'll need to check the
manual. (Note: many boards let you use slower SIMMs with them by
enabling a "wait state," which forces the processor to slow down to the
SIMM's speed, and allows you to use cheaper, slower SIMMs. For instance,
an accelator may say that it requires 70 ns SIMMs to run at "zero wait
states," but will operate with an 80 ns SIMM (slower) if you set a
jumper to enable a wait state.)


Q. If I get faster SIMMs than I need, will it make the computer run
faster?

A. No. The processor determines how fast the memory needs to be, and
will not run any faster even if the memory is capable of it. For
instance, if your accelerator needs a 70 ns SIMM, and you use a 60 ns
SIMM, it will not run any faster than it would with a 70 ns SIMM. (It
may be a good idea to buy faster RAM than you need, though, since you
could then use it with a faster processor in the future.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monitors

Q. I have a VGA or SVGA monitor from a PC clone. Can I use it with the
A1200?

A. Maybe. The "double" video modes of the A1200's AGA chipset provide
video frequencies of 23 kHz and up, and will work with many VGA
monitors. However, true PC clone-type VGA operates at a frequency of
31.5 kHz, and some monitors won't operate at frequencies much lower than
that. The "VGAOnly" monitor driver may be used to raise the A1200 output
frequencies, making them high enough to be recognized by some monitors.
You should certainly try any VGA monitor before you buy it, though, just
to be sure. (Note: many games and some system software operate only at
15.75 kHz. For instance, the configuration screen you get by holding
down the mouse buttons during a reset only displays at 15.75 kHz, and
will not be visible with a VGA-type monitor. However, there is some
software that addresses this; look at the Aminet file
gfx/aga/AAStarter12.lha.)


Q. What specifications does a multisync monitor need to work with the
A1200?

A. Ideally, you need it to have a sync range from 15 kHz to 31.5 kHz or
higher. Digital presets are very helpful because they allow you to set
screen size and centering for all the different screen modes.


Q. Where can I get an adapter to go from the A1200's DB23 video port to
the goofy high-density HDD15 standard VGA connector that looks like a
DB9?

A. The adaptor that comes with an A4000 can be used, or see Connecting
VGA Monitors from the A4000 Hardware Guide. Alternatively, you could
have Redmond Cable build one for you (call them at 206-882-2009).


Q. Can I use a CGA monitor with an A1200?

A. Yes, but it won't work particularly well. CGA is digital RGB, so it
can only generate 16 predefined colors. If it's the only monitor you
have, you can probably live with it, but I would personally recommend
even a composite video monitor instead (the old 1702 would work well for
this).


Q. What Commodore monitor should I buy for use with the A1200?

A. My opinion: Don't buy any Commodore monitor. There are several
monitors like the Microvitec 1438 and 1440 that are marketed
specifically use with the Amiga (these are also resold under the Amiga
Technologies label), and there are general-purpose VGA-type monitors
that also work well. In most cases, these monitors are less expensive,
better made, and more reliable than those that were sold by Commodore
(which were OEMed from monitor manufacturers anyway). If you're looking
for something inexpensive that will work with all the frequencies and
output modes of the A1200, see if you can locate a used Mitsubishi
DiamonScan (AUM 1381A) or NEC 3D. These monitors are quite cheap now,
and will handle all the RGB output of the A1200 (the Mitsubishi also has
a composite video input). If you're buying something new, I strongly
advise a monitor with digital presets, which makes screen adjustments
much easier and eliminates the need to fiddle with knobs every time you
change screen modes (the Microvitec 1440 mentioned above is reported to
have digital presets).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Questions

Q. I don't like to shut off the A1200 to connect and disconnect
joysticks, modems, video and sound samplers, and printers. Can I damage
the A1200 by changing these connections with the power on?

A. Yes. Remember that the A1200 design uses chips that are almost all
surface-mount, soldered directly to the circuit board. This makes it
very reliable, but when you expose it to dangerous behavior (changing
connections with power applied), you risk damaging chips that are very
difficult to replace and extremely difficult to obtain. Before you
switch cables, make sure that power is off to the entire system,
including the peripheral you are connecting or disconnecting.


Q. Is there a way to get a battery-backed clock into the A1200 without
buying an expensive expansion board?

A. Yes. There is a header on the A1200 motherboard specifically for
adding one of these inexpensive clock boards, which usually cost less
than $30 US. However, a RAM expansion board with a clock like the DKB
1202 is usually only about double that, and gives you the ability to add
32-bit expansion memory later, which will approximately double the
operating speed of the A1200.


Q. Can I modify the A1200 to have a remote keyboard?

A. Yes, if you're really motivated. There is a file on doing this in the
hard/hack section of Aminet. It is non-trivial.


Q. Can I remount my A1200 in a PC tower case?

A. Yes, although it'll be a lot of work, and no warranties. See the
hard/hack section of Aminet.


Q. Can the A1200 be upgraded to AmigaOS 3.1?

A. Yes. The operating system ROMs are socketed, and several places are
now selling versions of 3.1 that are specifically made for the A1200. In
fact, the new A1200s being sold by Amiga Technologies come with 3.1.


Q. Is there an adapter box that lets me use Zorro boards on the A1200?

A. There are supposed to be several, although details are scarce, mainly
because these hings are quite expensive and therefore rare. Don't count
on being able to use any given card with them; the A1200 was not
designed for this type of expansion and bus noise and other problems are
bound to make using some boards problematic.


Q. Can I use a Video Toaster with the A1200?

A. Normally, no. Some expansion boxes claim to add a video slot,
although whether this will work with the Toaster is unclear at best.
There are video digitizers and genlocks available specifically for the
A1200, though.


Q. Is there a Mac emulator for the A1200?

A. There are two at present: ShapeShifter and Fusion. ShapeShifter is a
shareware package that can be downloaded from the misc/emu directory of
Aminet, while Fusion is a commercial software package.

Either emulator will require a legal Mac ROM, although which versions
they support or require may vary with the release version. You'll also
need the Macintosh operating system. Version 7.5 can be purchased from
Macintosh dealers, or you can download an earlier release from Apple's
web site.


Q. Is there an internal jumper on the A1200 to set it to default to PAL
or NTSC video?

A. No, but if you're really motivated, you can rig this up. My thanks to
Tetsuo Oda and Byron Montgomerie, who provided the information that
connecting pin 41 of the Alice custom chip to ground causes the A1200 to
default to NTSC, while pulling this pin high (disconnecting it from the
motherboard and connecting it to +5V through a 4.7k resistor) will make
the default power-up state PAL. I would point out that making a
modification like this on a surface-mount chip is difficult at best, and
you may end up needing an expensive motherboard replacement, or, at
worst, a dead A1200 that needs an expensive replacement motherboard
available. In most cases, using the boot menu (obtained by pressing both
mouse buttons on power-up or reset) to switch to PAL is sufficient.
However, with some games, the hardware patch will be necessary to insure
proper timing (changing to PAL via the boot menu might make a 50 Hz game
run at 60 Hz timing, or vice versa).

@{fg shine} The ONLY known surveying package for the Amiga@{fg text}

         General Description of Program CoGo for the Amiga

  CoGo is a mnemonic name of problem-oriented computer systems that
  enable the user to solve geometric problems related to surveying and
  civil engineering. This coordinate geometry, or CoGo, can be used to
  solve problems related to highway design, to surveying, to subdivision
  layouts and to construction. CoGo may be applied to other problems,
  similar in nature to those described above.

  CoGo is based on a rectilinear coordinate system where points are
  located as being so many units North and East of a fixed point with the
  coordinates of 0.0' N, 0.0' E. Units are either metric or feet. Those
  points may be used to define locations of control points of rights-of-
  way, highway alignment, or other points of known reference. A
  supplementary system for vertical profiles is also available. Output is
  to the monitor, printer, or plotter, while input is from keyboard or
  file.

  NOTE: In the DEMO Version the printer and plotter output are disabled.

@{fg shine} Letters Corner@{fg text}

@{b}From@{ub} : Deaf Base hahaha! what a joke he is! pah!

Hey there m8..

        Well firstly, I really hope you put this letter in your next issue
of AIO (and no doubt you will, as to be honest, 2 of the letters in AIO 8
have been pulled straight off the scene and made to subtley look like they
were sent to you ;)

There is only one reason I'm taking the time out to write this down, and
thats because by the time I'm finished, I may possibly have stopped
laughing :)

I'm writing about your -fantastic- review of the infamous Ascii Brick
Simulator v1.3, or to give it it's proper name, "aSCII bRICK sIMULATOR pRO
tURBO eDITION v1.3". When Cryton told me you had included a review of this
in your 'zine, I thought you were having a joke. But obviously you seem to
have missed the complete point of ABS 1.3. Which is pretty amazing,
considering it's an Ascii Brick Maker? (Didn't a part of you just go, "Eh
wot?" :)

Now, I can understand that if you just launched the program and quit
immediately, you may indeed think that ABS was a serious program for
serious users. But, being a reviewer, I would have expected you to play
around with it, and indeed read the documentation to enable you to give a
fair and impartial review, just like Amiga Format. Ha. :)

But obviously not. Let me read your review once more. You came out with the
gem:

"Anyway ABS V.13 draws bricks in ascii. It can do all kinds of sizes of
 bricks, which is nice".

It is nice, very nice indeed, until you suddenly realise that who in the
world would -want- to draw a brick, let alone in ascii! You then went on to
suggest some ideas, and say

"This would make the program much better and make it of some use"

Well, er, see my point above. The development team is currently working
round the clock to implement the save option, but we're experiencing some
problems with writing the difficult and complex format to disk ;).

I think what amazed me the most is that you seemed to have no CLUE that it
was in fact a p***take! And well, even if you were blind, illiterate and
stupid, I think the "Credits" section would have given it away:

Ed-*DEAF BASE GOES ONTO WAFFLE NEARLY THE WHOLE OF HIS DOCUMENTATION*

What more can I say? AIO editors, go out, get a life, and occasionally,
just occasionally, think before putting ascii to .guide :)

Expect ABS 1.4 to be out soon, with MUI and PPC support, and no doubt AIO
will carry a review of that too ;)

-dEF bASE!-

@{b}ED:@{ub}

 Right your first point is totally incorrect, If you want to ask
the people in question whether those articles where given to me
you will be supprised to find that the actually where so first
of all get your facts right before you go and make stupid remarks 
that you have no way of backing up. 
 If you didn't intend Ascii brick sim to be a proper program
why bother uploading it? Doesn't this seem a bit pointless and
waste peoples time downloading it, hmm yes i think so! If you read
the article you will notice that it says if you took my ideas on
board it would make Ascii Brick Sim "of some use" so in other
words it has no use so far, or are you not clever enough to
realise this and have to have it spelt out to you? As for go out
and get a life, that is your silly little immature comment which
is not wanted round here! Goodnight, goodbye and goodrid!

MUI and PPC support, hmm could you handle more that 5k coding? ;)
nope i don't think so actually!
