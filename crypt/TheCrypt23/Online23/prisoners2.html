          corrugated iron was hidden by plasterboard an&nbsp; altar&nbsp; constructed&nbsp; and 
          a&nbsp; huge&nbsp; mural&nbsp; of the Madonna and Child&nbsp; painted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ornate iron work created 
          a sanctuary screen. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font  color=aqua>The &nbsp;
          interior&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; chapel&nbsp;was&nbsp; painted&nbsp; to resemble&nbsp;&nbsp; brickwork&nbsp; and&nbsp; then&nbsp;  
          outside&nbsp;&nbsp;  an impressive&nbsp; facade&nbsp; with&nbsp; a belfry was built to disguise 
          the Nissen hut.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font  color=aqua>The 
          most impressive part of the chapel interior is the&nbsp; beautiful&nbsp; altarpiece, 
          painted&nbsp; by&nbsp; Chiocchetti, depicting the Madonna and Child surrounded&nbsp;by 
          cherubs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around&nbsp; her&nbsp; is a scroll&nbsp; which&nbsp; reads "Regina pacis ora pro 
          nobis" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Queen of Peace pray for us). </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color=aqua>Jesus 
          holds in his hand an olive branch, while the cherub on&nbsp; the&nbsp; bottom right 
          is sheathing a sword, both symbols of peace. The cherub on the left 
          holds a shield bearing the heraldic badge of Moena, Chiocchetti's 
          home town. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font  color=aqua>The 
          main&nbsp;  picture is based on&nbsp; the painting &&nbsp;Madonna of the Olives
          by Nicolo Barabina (1832-1891)&nbsp;. This&nbsp; picture&nbsp; was on a Christmas card 
          that Chiocchetti received from his mother, which he always carried in 
          his wallet.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font  color=aqua>The 
          front facade of the chapel is made of concrete, concealing its humble 
          origins.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color=aqua>With 
          the help of Sergeant Pennisi who came across from the other camp, we 
          planned the front, said Signor Chiocchetti.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bruttapasta 
          worked&nbsp; on it&nbsp; and&nbsp; we&nbsp;erected an&nbsp; impressive<BR> facade&nbsp; to&nbsp; hide the&nbsp; ugly&nbsp; outline 
          of the hut. It even had gothic pinnacles cast in clay and finished in 
          cement. The head of Christ was the work of Pennisi. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font  color=aqua>My 
          commandant wanted to take a photograph of the outside at once, but there 
          was a gap in the facade. There was no bell. I didn't&nbsp; lose heart 
          but cut one out of cardboard and fixed it in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later we&nbsp; found a 
          real&nbsp; bell&nbsp; from&nbsp; a ship and the outside was completed with a&nbsp; new cement 
          roof.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font  color=aqua>When 
          the Italians left Orkney, Chiocchetti remained behind to finish the 
          chapel. The last thing to be completed was the stoop for the holy water. 
          Once it was finished he left Orkney to&nbsp; rejoin his&nbsp; comrades,&nbsp; leaving 
          behind&nbsp; him a small piece of Italy on a barren Orkney island. He spent 
          his last&nbsp; ten&nbsp; months of&nbsp; captivity&nbsp;at Kew before returning home to his 
          family in February 1946, six years and eight months after leaving them.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color=aqua>Before 
          he left, a special service was held with a recording of the bells and 
          choir of St Peter's, Rome, playing from the belfry.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color=aqua>The 
          war ended and the camp was dismantled. The chapel might have fallen 
          into ruins and been lost forever, but for the concern of a small group 
          of dedicated Orcadians.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font  color=aqua>In 
          1958, a chapel preservation committee was formed. A series of repairs 
          was carried out, financed by the contributions of visitors.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color=aqua>Signor 
          Chiocchetti was traced living in the village of Moena and, in 1960, 
          with the help of the BBC&nbsp; who&nbsp; had&nbsp; broadcast programmes about the chapel 
          in Italy, he returned to Orkney and helped to restore some of the paintwork 
          which his genius had created back in the 1940s.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font  color=aqua>On 
          Sunday,&nbsp;&nbsp; April 10,&nbsp;&nbsp;1960,&nbsp; a service of rededication in the&nbsp; chapel&nbsp; was 
          attended by 200 Orcadians of all denominations. Signor Chiocchetti was 
          the first to receive Holy Communion.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font  color=aqua>When 
          he returned to Italy the following week, he left a moving message to 
          Orcadians.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font  color=aqua>He

         &nbsp;&nbsp;I take&nbsp; with&nbsp; me&nbsp; to&nbsp; Italy&nbsp; the remembrance of your kindness and wonderful 
          hospitality.&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall remember always, and my children shall learn from 
          me to love you.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font  color=aqua>In 
          the mid-1990s, the first significant restoration in 30 years was carried 
          out to ensure the Italian Chapel remains open for decades to come.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font  color=aqua>Under 
          the&nbsp; supervision of local artist&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr&nbsp; Gary Gibson, work was undertaken 
          which should now last well into the 21st century.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font  color=aqua>The 
          minimum of paintwork was carried out to keep&nbsp; it&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp;original&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp; possible 
          but&nbsp;&nbsp; the depredations of time meant that many of the original nails and 
          plane areas had to be treated. Panelling  mainly around the windows 
           had been spoiled by water so they were strengthened by additional 
          wood struts.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color=aqua>It 
          was&nbsp; discovered&nbsp; that the&nbsp; main&nbsp; iron&nbsp; structures and&nbsp; wooden&nbsp; strapping were 
          sound and although modern materials were used during the repair work, 
          care was taken to ensure that the nearest equivalents to the original 
          fabrics were used.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font  color=aqua>Domenico 
          Chiocchetti died in Moena on May 7, 1999. His wife and family returned 
          to the little chapel that was so dear to him for a memorial service 
          on June 9, 1999, conducted by Bishop Mario Conti. His daughter Letizia 
          remembered what the chapel meant to her father;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font  color=aqua>We 
          grew up with this little story. When we grew up we realised it must 
          have been very important for him. Even though he was a prisoner he left 
          a piece of his heart in Orkney.</font></p>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">"As part of a visiting group from the Italian town of Moena,
Angela and Letizia Chiocchetti made a return pilgrimage last
week to the Italian Chapel of Lamb Holm, created by their
father Domenico, during his time in Orkney as a prisoner of
war.</P><p></P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">They were visiting Orkney as part of a group of singers,
instrumentalists,&nbsp;&nbsp; family&nbsp;&nbsp;members,&nbsp;&nbsp; councillors and
representatives of the Roman Catholic church.  There was a
service in the Italian Chapel, during which the visitors
from Moena played and sang, and in the evening they gave a
performance in St. Magnus Cathedral.  Signor Chiocchetti's
widow is now 83, and was not able to make the journey to
Orkney."</P></font>
