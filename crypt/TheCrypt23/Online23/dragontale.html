<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once  upon a time,  there were no rivers and lakes on earth,   but
only  the  Eastern  Sea,  in which lived four dragons:   the  Long
Dragon, the Yellow Dragon, the Black Dragon and the Pearl Dragon.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One  day  the four dragons flew from the sea into the  sky.   They
soared and dived, playing at hide-and-seek in the clouds.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Come over here quickly!" the Pearl Dragon cried out suddenly.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"What's up?" asked the other three,  looking down in the direction
where the Pearl Dragon pointed.  On the earth they saw many people
putting  out fruits and cakes,  and burning incense sticks.   They
were praying!  A white-haired woman, kneeling on the ground with a
thin boy on her back, murmured:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Please  send rain quickly,  God of Heaven,  to give our  children
rice to eat.."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For  there  had been no rain for a long time.  The crops withered,
the  grass  turned yellow and fields cracked under  the  scorching
sun.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"How poor the people are!" said the Yellow Dragon.  "And they will
die if it doesn't rain soon."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Long Dragon nodded.  Then he suggested,  "Let's go and beg the
Jade Emperor for rain."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So saying,  he leapt into the clouds.  The others followed closely
and flew towards the Heavenly Palace.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Being in charge of all the affairs in heaven,  on earth and in the
sea,   the Jade Emperor was very powerful.  He was not pleased  to
see  the  dragons rushing in.  "Why do you come  here  instead  of
staying in the sea and behaving yourselves?"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Long Dragon stepped forward and said,  "The crops on earth are
withering and dying,  Your Majesty.  I beg you to send  rain  down
quickly!"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"All  right.   You  go  back  first,  I'll  send  some  rain  down
tomorrow." The Jade Emperor pretended to agree while listening  to
the songs of the fairies.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Thanks, Your Majesty!" The four dragons went happily back.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But ten days passed, and not a drop of rain came down.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  people  suffered more,  some eating bark,  some grass  roots,
some  forced to eat white clay when they ran out of bark and grass
roots.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seeing all this,  the four dragons felt very sorry,  for they knew
the  Jade Emperor only cared about pleasure,  and never  took  the
people  to  heart.  They could only rely on themselves to  relieve
the people of their miseries. But how to do it?</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/dragonrt.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="50" ALT="Drg.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Seeing the vast sea, the Long Dragon said that he had an idea.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"What is it? Out with it, quickly!" the other three demanded.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Look,  is there not plenty of water in the sea where we live?  We
should  scoop it up and spray it towards the sky.  The water  will
be  like  rain  drops and come down to save the people  and  their
crops."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Good idea!" The others clapped their hands.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"But,"  said the Long Dragon after thinking a bit,   "we  will  be
blamed if the Jade Emperor learns of this."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"I  will  do anything to save the people," the Yellow Dragon  said
resolutely.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Let's begin.  We will never regret it." The Black Dragon and  the
Pearl Dragon were not to be outdone.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They flew to the sea,  scooped up water in their mouths,  and then
flew back into the sky,  where they sprayed the water out over the
earth.  The four dragons flew back and forth,  making the sky dark
all  around.  Before long the sea water became rain  pouring  down
from the sky.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"It's raining! It's raining!"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"The crops will be saved!"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  people  cried and leaped with joy.  On the ground  the  wheat
stalks raised their heads and the sorghum stalks straightened up.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  god  of the sea discovered these events and reported  to  the
Jade Emperor.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"How dare the four dragons bring rain without my permission!" 
  The Jade Emperor was enraged, and ordered the heavenly generals and their troops 
  to arrest the four dragons. Being far outnumbered, the four dragons could not 
  defend themselves, and they were soon arrested and brought back to the heavenly 
  palace.</P>

<P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Go  and  get  four mountains to lay upon them so  that  they  can
never escape!" The Jade Emperor ordered the Mountain God.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Mountain God used his magic power to make four mountains  fly
there,   whistling in the wind from afar,  and pressed  them  down
upon the four dragons.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Imprisoned  as  they  were,  they never regretted  their  actions.
Determined  to  do  good  for  the people  forever,   they  turned
themselves into four rivers,  which flowed past high mountains and
deep  valleys,  crossing the land from the west to  the  east  and
finally  emptying into the sea.  And so China's four great  rivers
were  formed -- the Heilongjian (Black Dragon)  in the far  north,
the  Huanghe  (Yellow  River)  in central China,   the  Changjiang
(Yangtze,  or Long River)  farther south, and the Zhujiang (Pearl)
in the very far south.</P>
