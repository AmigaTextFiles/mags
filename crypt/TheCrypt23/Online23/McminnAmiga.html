currently  studying  for   a   PhD   in   evolutionary  artificial
intelligence,   at  The  Robert   Gordon   University,   Aberdeen,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  first got into computers back when the Acorn Electron came out,
and have been trying to resist technology since then.  I bought  a
second  hand Spectrum in 1990 and then an Amiga 500+ in  1992  and
then  a second hand A1200 in 1994.  More recently I got  a  PC  in
1996  (for  Uni stuff)  but now I have a lovely,  lovely,   lovely
68060 in my A1200 (Tower).  I've been into programming since I got
the  Electron and have always had ambitions to code  the  greatest
game of all time (G-GOAT,  hey that would be a good game :), but I
don't  have the patience.  I'm more into programming utilities  on
the Amiga,  stuff for uni on the PC and mostly anything (Motorola)
microcontroller  based.  I'm experienced in Blitz2  (Amiga  only),
C/C++  and  Assembly (68k and 68xx only).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over  the  last couple of weeks (12th Feb 2002 to  26th  Feb)   my
Amiga has been dead.  So I took the opportunity to revamp the case
to  make  it a bit more "luggable" <font color=white>:) <font color=aqua> (luggable meaning portable,
but still heavy enough to be a hassle).  Some pics of the case are
shown  above,   so  you can click on them to get  a  bigger  view.
Thankfully I managed to finish the case and get the Amiga  working
in time for the Alt-WoA 2002 show,  where it was on display on the
Scalos stand.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  case  was bought from Argos and is actually a filing  cabinet
type thing for storing folders and paper.  It cost around £10  and
I  think  it  is for A4 sized paper (might have been  foolscap?  I
just  grabbed  it  off  the shelf though<font color=white>  :)<font color=aqua>.   Other  parts  were
aluminium  bars,  rods and L-shaped brackets bought from  B&Q  and
assorted  screws,  washers,  nuts,  etc.  Maplins was  also  quite
useful  -  I  got the power switch and a set of needle files  from
there (and the needle files were damned handy when my dodgy  hole-
drilling skills were a bit more off-centre than normal <font color=white>:)<font color=aqua>.</font></font></font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua><font color=white><font color=aqua>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  motherboard  (bought  for £20 from Amibench),   Mediator  and
Blizzard1260  (SIMM held in using a couple  of  ty-wraps<font color=white>  :) <font color=aqua>  are
mounted in a metal frame.  The ports at the back stick through and
are  secured to one aluminium bar,  and the motherboard  holes  at
the  front  are mounted on a L-shaped bar.  A couple of  other  L-
shaped  bars form sliding runners under the motherboard.  The  PCI
cards in the Mediator are supported by some more bars sticking  up
from port edge support.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  motherboard then fits onto the inside of the case by  sliding
the runners underneath a couple of aluminium bars.  It is held  in
place  using  a  simple  spring-based quick release  latch.   Also
attached  to  the  case is the HDD bracket (again  with  a  spring
locking latch).  The HDD slides into the bracket just beside where
the case lid is held open with another bar.  On the bottom of  the
case  there are four heavy duty rubber cabinet feet (mmmm,   table
surface friendly - nice <font color=white>;)<font color=aqua>.  The final case items are two  handles
suitable for attaching a shoulder strap - these were made  out  of
two U-shaped rods,  normally used for securing pipes and things to
walls.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  PSU is held in using "Fixit Blocks" (or at least that is what
is  says on the bag ;).  Basically,  two self tapping screws  (per
block)  go through the case and into the plastic blocks.  A nut is
then  hammered into the block at the side where it meets the tower
case  and  a rod is put through it.  There are four such block/rod
combinations,  and then bars were placed between  them  to  secure
the  PSU against the case and between the blocks.  There is a  red
neon rocker switch on the top of the case to turn it on and off.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  you can see,  there is no CD drive or floppy in there -  those
will  be the next additions,  and it will fill up the rest of  all
that nasty empty space<font color=white> ;)</font></P><font color=white>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The A4000 keyboard is connected to the motherboard using the well-
known keyboard hack.  However,  at the recent Alt-WoA 2002 show  I
purchased an EZKEY-XS Mk2 keyboard adaptor from Eyetech,  but have
still  got  to  fit  it  - here's hoping it works  even  with  the
keyboard  hack  in  the  way  or  I'll  need  to  go  buy  another
motherboard<font color=white> ;)</font></P><font color=white>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  VGA  monitor  is  used thanks to the scandoubler/flickerfixer
and  Voodoo3.   Previously,   I used  a  fiddled  DBLNTSC  monitor
preferences and a VGA monitor adapter.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also,  the boot delay hack has been used so that I don't  need  to
manually  reset my Amiga after turning it on,  although  this  has
not been required since I got the 13Gb drive and EIDE adapter.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Zip drive works great and is connected via the ppazip adapter.
Some  of my WB screenshots are shown.  As mentioned above,  I  use
Scalos as a WorkBench replacement.  Other stuff I used in  the  WB
screenshots  are  the recent additions of VisualPrefs  (using  the
RMTronics  gadget set and some of my own settings)  and Birdie2000
(the  active  borders  are the 001.jpg from  that  archive  passed
through  a  red filter,  and the inactive borders are a  grayscale
version  of the same file).  The main backdrop is from  The  Scumm
Bar  (a  Monkey  Island tribute site).  Window backdrops  are  the
TissueDark and MarbleDark from the standard MUI distribution.  The
third grab shows the Scalos "About" window.  The final grab  shows
some  progs running (Prayer2 - MP3 player,  Frogger -  MPG  player
and Multiview showing a flying saucer pic).</P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  reason this Amiga came about was due to the number  of  spare
parts  I had lying around.  The motherboard used to be in my  main
Amiga,  but after it blew up (literally,  sparks and everything  -
could  have something to do with 5V and 0V coming into contact<font color=white>  :)
<font color=aqua>I  got the other motherboard.  However,  I managed to fix it:  the
only thing wrong was that the 5V line at the PSU connector on  the
motherboard had burst, so a little solder later...</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However,  I've since swapped that 1D4 for a 1A because  no  floppy
drives in existance seemed to work on it (must've killed a CIA  or
something). They do now appear to work OK with the 1A.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Due to the trashed metal shield,  the mouse port was inaccessable.
So  thats why there is a joystick/mouse switcher connected to  the
mouse  port (internally!).  All the other bits in this  Amiga  are
leftovers from various upgrades to the main Amiga.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  also  run  WinUAE  (with  a variety of configurations)   on  my
Duron750/128Mb/Voodoo3 when I don't have access to  my  Amigas  or
have to get a fix of that nostalgia gaming <font color=white>:)</font></P><font color=white>
