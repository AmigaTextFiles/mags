<font color=yellow><CENTER>Right, another piece of hardware has been added to my P.C.</CENTER>

<CENTER><I>This addition takes the form of a TV Tuner card. A  PCLine one to be exact.
Yup, its a PC World special offer coming in under the thirty pounds mark. </i></CENTER></font>

<blockquote>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I've always fancied a TV card, and the fact that it is one of the easiest ways 
to access my camcorder (<font color=silver>no, its not a digital camcorder<font color=aqua>) was the major point 
in getting it .</font></font></P></font></blockquote><font color=aqua><blockquote>
<font color=silver>
<p>The PCLine turns out to be a ModularTech board manufactured as a Galaxy Television 
PCTV Tuner card. Info can be found at http://www.modulartech.com/galaxy/ </p></font></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font color=aqua>Inside the box shown, you get a board , CD and a little booklet. The booklet 
 explains how to install the card and how to install and use the software provided. 
Please note that the booklet warns that the software will<font color=red> NOT<font color=aqua> work under XP, 
Windows 2000 or Linux. No problems there for me, since my machine is currently 
running Millennium Edition. M.E. is  mentioned in the booklet very sparingly, 
but as you will see, it hasnt caused me any problems.<p></p></font></font></font></blockquote><font color=aqua><font color=red>

<IMG SRC="Images/image002.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="200" ALT="image2.jpg"><blockquote><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color=aqua>The board is a standard pci card. It took a few minutes to install it, most 
of this time being unplugging everything to get the case cover off. The only 
problem that I discovered was that the underside of the card has the heat shield 
metal fastening on it and this leads to the board not being entirely flat . 
Since I found this fouled the modem card on fitting, I simply moved down a slot 
to actually get it into the slot properly. If you only have one spare slot, 
you might need to trim the metal protrusions slightly if the adjacent card has 
any high spots on it.</font></P></blockquote>



<blockquote><font color=aqua><p>After fitting the board. It remained to power back up and install the software. 
The little booklet details all the steps, but you could figure it out without 
 it. It simply consists of inserting the CD and telling Windows (<font color=silver>which has detected 
the card<font color=aqua>), to install the drivers from the CD.</font></font></p></font></blockquote><font color=aqua><font color=silver>

<blockquote><font color=aqua><p>Once the drivers have been installed, the system will ask for a reboot and 
 after this, the Cd will come up with the Welcome screen for Galaxy Television 
and install the software for viewing the channels.</p></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color=yellow><p><I>As a small side note, the booklet details the minimum spec required for the 
card to work. This is a lowly 200mhz and 32mb of ram , coupled with 2.5mb of 
hard drive space for the software. A graphics card and soundcard supported by 
at least DirectX 5 is also required. Offhand, I cant imagine many folk struggling 
to meet those requirements.</I></p></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color=aqua><p>So, how well does it work. The software enables you to take stills from the 
card, or movies. BMP format and avi respectively. The avi is uncompressed, so 
takes up a lot of room!</p></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color=aqua><p>Viewing is done by two programs, the Galaxy Television program and Teletext 
Explorer. There is software installed with the card for a remote control, but 
none come with the card.</p></font></blockquote>



<IMG SRC="Images/image004.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="350" HEIGHT="350" ALT="image4.jpg"><blockquote><font color=aqua>Teletext is very impressive with all pages loading at the same time e.g. if 
you load a page with 20 sub pages, they are all there, it is simply a matter 
of scrolling down the page to get to them. This saves an enormous amount of 
time compared with conventional Teletext. The explorer interface also gives 
you the option of updating your P.C. clock and in the options of electing to 
do it when you start the software.<p></p></font></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<font color=aqua><p>As well as having the fast text buttons on the top, you can also click on the 
page number to go there . clicking on a phone number on the page will also autodial 
it for you. You can add favourites for your pages like in the real explorer 
as well, and there are quite a few options for displaying as well, including 
changing the font.</p></font></blockquote>

 <blockquote><font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All taken from the Sky digital 
signal heading for my television. I took the aerial signal required for the 
card from the RF output from the Sky decoder, as this gives all the channels 
I usually watch and leaves a jack free for the camcorder to plug in.</P></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you can see, the picture is adequate for 
viewing. The picture can be resized and can also give different aspects . These 
are normal, wide and DVD widescreen.   The picture is actually pretty good on 
the monitor even at full screen, although usually I leave it as a small box 
in the corner</P></font></blockquote> 

<blockquote><font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think the card is pretty 
good value for money, but with the likes of the Radeon graphics card to mention 
 just one, it may only be worthwhile if you dont intend updating your graphics 
card. The only real disadvantage is that it doesnt provide a TV out as well 
so that you could output from your computer .But, if like me, you wish to 
get video into your computer, this is one of the cheapest and easiest options. 
And, it has a few other benefits.</P></font></blockquote>
