<center> <h1> Irfanview review </h1> </center>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>How about a nice little freeware viewer that plays animgif’s, mp3’s, avi’s 
  , mpeg’s and allows editing and effects?</p>
<p>Sounds very impressive , doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Well, it is! Step forward Irfanview!!</p>
<p>Irfanview can be downloaded from the authors site at  <a href="http://www.irfanview.com/">http://www.irfanview.com</a></p>

<p>You can see from the grabs (I’ll explain further about that bit), that Irfanview 
  is freeware as long as you are using it for private non commercial use. I would 
  recommend registering simply to keep the author interested however. Ever since 
  I put this program on my drive a few days ago, I have been delighted with it 
  and fully intend to register it! Its only a few pounds and shouldn’t break anyone’s 
  budget.</p>
<p>The grabs………..</p>
<p>All the grabs were done using Irfanview. I simply told it to make a new Irfanview……</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=365 height=269
src="Images/Irfanview006.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"> </p>
<p>then hit printscrn on the keyboard ……… then pasted into the new Irfanview and cropped 
  the resultant Irfanview. Viola , the screengrabs you will see littered through the 
  article. </p>
<p>Simple, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Irfanview is like that, a very powerful program that looks deceptively simple.</p>
<p>Once you download Irfanview , also download all the plugins. The plugins can 
  be got at the same site. The main download is 797k for Irfanview and the plugins 
  file is 2.27mb.</p>
<p>After you install the files (which are both exe’s, so it is a simple matter 
  of double clicking on each), you can start the program.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=554 height=555
src="Images/Irfanview008.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028"> </p>
<p>As you can see, not awe inspiring <span>J</span></p>
<p>However, a quick look through the menus will let you see some of the wonders 
  that await you.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=488 height=469
src="Images/Irfanview009.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029"> </p>
<p>Yes, it will let you batch scan , import from any twain source, print, give 
  you a slideshow, let you see directories as thumbnails…most things actually!</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=515 height=253
src="Images/Irfanview010.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030"> </p>
<p>It makes use of the clipboard as you can see from the grabs…..where did you 
  think it got the data from? </p>
<p> <img border=0 width=497 height=436
src="Images/Irfanview011.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1031"> </p>
<p>Way-Hay, we can resize, modify and do lots of things to the Images from here.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=510 height=351
src="Images/Irfanview012.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1032"> </p>
<p>As you can see from the “start multimedia player, we are not limited to Irfanview 
  files…..</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=502 height=510
src="Images/Irfanview013.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1033"> </p>
<p>More options than you could shake a smelly stick at ………</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=503 height=216
src="Images/Irfanview014.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1034"> </p>
<p>And the final menu…..where to find out how to use all those lovely options 
  for a kick off.</p>
<p>After installing and starting Irfanview , lets have a look at some of the plugins…..</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=522 height=440
src="Images/Irfanview016.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1035"> </p>
<p>As you can see, there’s not a lot missed out. If you do as I did, and scroll 
  further down, this program handles most types of Irfanview files. You can also see 
  it has a range of plugins for the effects. </p>
<p>Lets load a picture.</p>
<p>Here’s one I took of the kids using the small fashion cam reviewed elsewhere 
  in the mag. </p>
<p> <img border=0 width=554 height=555
src="Images/Irfanview018.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1036"> </p>
<p>Lovely , aren’t they and the apple of their Dad’s eye <span>J</span></p>
<p> <img border=0 width=344 height=417
src="Images/Irfanview020.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1037"> </p>
<p>Here’s the properties of the picture.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=495 height=417
src="Images/Irfanview022.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1038"> </p>
<p>If I really wanted , I could alter various properties of the Irfanview. A nice 
  list of options are in the “Irfanview” menu under resize/resample, and a list of 
  different filters for achieving the resize . I always find that the slowest 
  ones do the best job.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=554 height=555
src="Images/Irfanview024.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1039"> </p>
<p>you can change the Irfanview substantially by using some of the effects. Above 
  is the “negative” if you’re so inclined. You can enhance the Irfanview or simply 
  alter it by swapping around the rgb values………</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=494 height=457
src="Images/Irfanview026.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1040"> </p>
<p> <img border=0 width=497 height=486
src="Images/Irfanview027.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1041"> </p>
<p>Gives a very surreal effect, don’t you think?</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=554 height=555
src="Images/Irfanview029.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1042"> </p>
<p> <img border=0 width=554 height=555
src="Images/Irfanview031.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1043"> </p>
<p>You can make the Irfanview into a 3D button, if for instance, you are making a 
  website and want a nice change.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=554 height=555
src="Images/Irfanview033.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1044"> </p>
<p>You could use the multipage option to make the button have two Images and save 
  into a different format ……like gif.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=554 height=555
src="Images/Irfanview035.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1045"> </p>
<p>There are a variety of effects you can use, above check out the blur filter………</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=554 height=555
src="Images/Irfanview037.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1046"> </p>
<p>I tried out the “sharpen” filter on this one. </p>
<p> <img border=0 width=511 height=600
src="Images/Irfanview038.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1047"> </p>
<p>Lots of different options.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=554 height=555
src="Images/Irfanview040.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1048"> </p>
<p>Cropping is simple as well, as is zooming in and out of the picture.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=554 height=555
src="Images/Irfanview042.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1049"> </p>
<p>As I said before you can choose what format to save in, altering from gif to 
  jpeg or bmp is no longer a chore.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=553 height=678
src="Images/Irfanview044.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1050"> </p>
<p>There are a large list of formats available.</p>
<p>I love this program. I’m indebted to those on the Dopus list that happened 
  to mention it and piqued my curiosity. It will have a long future on my drive 
  by the look of it and I find new ways of using it every day. I mentioned earlier 
  that it plays movies and mp3’s etc as well using the multimedia player. It really 
  is a wonderful piece of work. The GUI is simple to navigate and you can usually 
  find exactly what you want to do with it quickly. Most uses are a mouse click 
  away.</p>
<p>Have a go at this and I’m sure it will be the same for you. I’m also pleased 
  by how stable it is………I can’t remember having a crash using it. </p>
<p>Excellent piece of software that deserves a lot of recognition!</p>
