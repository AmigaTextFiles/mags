<FONT COLOR=PURPLE><P ALIGN="LEFT">Surely tae God ye'll no get intae Trouble in yer Ain Hoose.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">That look in Ella Eyes were  enough to tell Boaby that the
Argument was a Waste of Time ..When Ella made up her mind
...Nothing would change it.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Ella had left for her Bingo Session ...Boaby had found his Drill
and was In the Kitchen Wondering where to put it</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Boaby Held the Crusher up on the Wall ... His short arms were at
Full Stretch But Still the Handle was only about Head Height for
Ella.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">"Bugger It"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> ...Said Boaby putting the Machine Down and getting a
Small Blue Stool.</font></P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">AH! ...That's Better<FONT COLOR=AQUA> ...Said Boaby ...And marked the Position of
the Drill Holes of the Wall with his Pencil.</font></P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">30 Minutes Later ...Wee Boaby Soaked in Sweat and covered with a
Fine white Plaster Dust had the Machine firmly fixed on the
Kitchen Wall.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">"Christ Its warm Work"..<FONT COLOR=AQUA> Cursed the Wee man ...Removing his shirt.</font></P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Two cans had Disappeared down Boabys Throat and a Third was half
done before his thirst was satisfied.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">Right!<FONT COLOR=AQUA> ...Said Boaby ...<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>Lets try yea<FONT COLOR=AQUA> ..Boaby placed one of his
Empty Lager cans into the Opening in the Machine.</font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Again Standing on the little Blue Plastic Stool ...Boaby pulled on
the Handle.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The top half of the Lager can Crushed without a Problem ...However
the Can Crusher Handle was now at 90% to the Wall. Boaby found
that He couldn't get enough Pressure on the Handle by Pulling, So
raising himself on to his Tiptoes he Tried to Push the Hanle down.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">For all of 5 minutes Boaby Heaved and Grunted ...First pulling the
Handle then Trying to Push it ..But the Can refused to Crush any
Further.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>ACH BLUDDY THING</B><FONT COLOR=AQUA> ...Said a scunnered Boaby ...<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>Ma Arms are killin
me.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Suddenly Boaby had a brainwave ... If I jump up and use my
Body weight on the Handle ...That might do the Job.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Boaby Jumped off the Little Stool ..His Midriff landing across
the Can Crusher Handle, Legs dangling in the Air ...Boaby then started bouncing up and Down</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>Ooof! ...Ooof! ...Ooof!</CENTER></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Boabys Weight and Bouncing was to much for the Old Tenement Walls
to Bare ... Suddenly a large portion of the Plaster and Brickwork
gave way ...Boaby ...Plunged to the Floor amid a cloud of Dust.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Several Minutes had passed before Boaby had regained his senses.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Boaby found he was lying on the Kitchen floor ..Face down ..His
arms trapped underneath him ...With the Can Crusher and Handle
holding his Midriff like a Vice ..and a large slab of Plaster and
Bricks lay on his Back.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Poor Boaby ...No matter how much he Wriggled and Squirmed he was
Trapped.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Wee Boaby had been on the Kitchen floor for around 15 minutes when
there was a Sudden Knock at the Door.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Boaby heard the Salemans footsteps disappearing into the Distance.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">In Sheer Temper ..Boaby gave his Body am almighty Heave off the
Floor ...Several Bricks moved ...And suddenly Boaby had one arm
free.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Boaby was in a better position now to access his Predicament ...The
Handle of the Machine and somehow become entwined with his Braces.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>AH!</B>... Thought Boaby ...If I Undo my Trousers I might be able to
squirm out from underneath the Rubble.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Boaby undid his Trousers and Braces ..And after a massive effort
managed to slide himself from Under the Rubble.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Boaby looked a sorry state ..Standing in the Dust filled Kitchen
..Wearing only his Cloth Bunnet and Underpants.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">He was staring at the Damage to his Kitchen Wall .. A large area
of Brickwork had dislodged and he could see the Cavity between the
Walls.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Boabys  Interest was taken by the<Font color=white> (Almost) <FONT COLOR=AQUA> Undamaged  back  wall
...Only one brick was Missing ...But There appeared to be a  small
panel  of  wood covering the Hole and the wood was moving  slightly
from side to Side.</font></font></P><Font color=white>

<font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">(<I>Meanwhile Next door</I>)</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Mrs McKay an Elderly Widow of many years was busy doing her
household chores.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Oh! Yes ..She had heard the Noise coming from the People in the
adjoining house to hers ...After all these old houses had very
thin walls ... She knew Boaby & Ella to see them .But she kept
herself very mush to herself ...Anyway there was always strange
noises coming from THAT House.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Mrs McKay Hummed quietly to herself as she Polished her Pride and
Joy ...A Tapestry of the Main Tourist sites in Glasgow. This
tapestry had taken her years to do and hung in a heavy wooden
frame in the Centre of her livingroom Wall. </P></FONT>

<font color=white><CENTER>(The one that was back to back with Boabys Kitchen)</CENTER></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Boaby stood transfixed by this shimmering piece of wood ...He just
couldn't understand why it was there or why it was moving.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Unable to bear the Suspense .. Boaby picked up his Clawhammer and
holding it by the head ...Used the Shaft to reach out and Prodded
the Piece of Wood.</P></FONT>

<font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">(<I>Back Next Door</I>)</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Mrs McKay had just finished polishing her Tapestry ...And had
stood bad to admire her handiwork ...When Suddenly ...</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The Tapestry <B>FLEW</B> off the Wall ...The Frame and Glass Breaking as
it landed in the Fireplace.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">A Horrified Mrs McKay looked up and her tapestry had been replaced
with Two Glowing Eyes.</P></FONT>

the Wall ...Boaby couldn't see anything ...But had a Bad feeling
about the Whole affair.</font></P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Boaby picked up one of the Loose Bricks and jammed it into the
Hole in the Wall ...There he thought ...As good as new.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The Mangled Can Crusher was fit for the bin ..And thats exactly
where Boaby put it ...He started, Frantically cleaning up the
Kitchen ...It was hot Sweaty work ...Suddenly there was a knock at
the Door.</P></FONT>
