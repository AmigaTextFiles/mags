<font color=Yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  recently  as the mid-1800s,  flying snakes of amazing  beauty,
with ornate feather wings,  were believed to inhabit Glamorgan  in
Wales.</P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According  to  one old man who lived at Penllyne in Glamorgan  and
died  early  in the twentieth century,  the woods around  Penllyne
Castle  contained many of these extraordinary  creatures  when  he
was  a  boy.   They were said to be brilliant in  colour,   as  if
spangled with sparkling gemstones,  and, like the peacock's train,
their wings often bore eyes; some also had rainbow-hued crests.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet despite their exquisite appearance, the winged serpents 
  were slaughtered by the local people as if they were merely vermin because they 
  preyed upon the farmer poultry. Indeed, the old mans father and uncle has killed 
  several when he was a youngster. Now, they were apparently extinct. Flying serpents 
  were also reported at Penmark Place, where one elderly woman claimed that there 
  had even been a "king" and "queen" of these winged wonders.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  such  serpents really did exist,  what could they  have  been?
Millions  of  year  ago,  Britain was home of Kuehneosaurus,   and
elongate lizardlike beast,  whose ribs were extended to for a pair
of  membranous  winglike structures that may have  enabled  it  to
glide through the air.  Today,  a similar creature still exist  in
the  humid jungles of Southeast Asia,  and is aptly knows as draco
volans,  or "flying dragon".  It is not native in Europe, however,
and  even  if  some had escaped from captivity into  woodlands  of
Wales, they would not have survived in its climate.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  has  been  suggested  that   brightly  colored  serpents  with
feathered  wings spied in the Vale of Edeyrnion in 1812  may  have
been cock pheasants,  which were unfamiliar there. But this theory
does not explain the serpents' liking for poultry,  and it is  not
likely that a pheasant could be mistaken for a flying snake.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There  might  once  have been proof of their existence,   for  the
Penmark woman stated that her grandfather had killed one of  these
beasts  and  kept its feathered skin until,  after he  died,   his
relatives discarded it.  If they had been eager to do so,  science
may  have  been  unable to unveil the identity of  Wales's  winged
serpents.</P>
