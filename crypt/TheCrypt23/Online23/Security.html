<font color=yellow><CENTER>A question of security has shown itself once more to me,</CENTER>
<CENTER>As plaintively there came a cry,  a call of help to render.</CENTER>
<CENTER>So off I go with all due speed,  and certain cat-like alacrity</CENTER>
<CENTER>To give assistance where I can,  to folk of the other gender.</CENTER>
<CENTER>And find that I've wasted my  time,  but not that I complain,</CENTER>
<CENTER>'Cos if it happens every time,  I'd respond just the same.</CENTER>
<CENTER>For when I make my prescence known,  no police there again,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It really makes you wonder if the world's blooming insane.</CENTER></font>
<P>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>A calming influence I give to honest working folk,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Upset by thieves and drug addicts who think the law's an ass.</CENTER>
<CENTER>While Law protects the criminals,  'tis naught but one great joke,</CENTER>
<CENTER>As they cheerfully go from day to day,  this is so flaming crass !</CENTER>
<CENTER>So when the dust has settled,  and all have said their lot,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And made their homeward departures,  there's nothing to do more,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I think the day has done it's worst,  but find that it has not!</CENTER>
<CENTER>For on my rapid departure,  my son has locked the door !</CENTER></FONT>
<P>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>Not by the normal method,  of locking it by key,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But by internal Chubb locks,  it's secure,  there's no doubt,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I   knock and call to him in vain,  but he does not hear me,</CENTER>
<CENTER>As happens,  he's just fast asleep,  he's well out for the count !</CENTER>
<CENTER>We call his name,  we knock the door,  but there is no reply,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And try in vain by knock and name to raise that flipping youth</CENTER>
<CENTER>Within the house we wish to go,  the minutes passing by.</CENTER>
<CENTER>But all we get is quietness,  Gawd blimey,  heaven,  strewth.</CENTER></FONT>
<P>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>The noise we are creating is enough to wake the dead,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The folk next door are wide awake,  and giving us what for.</CENTER>
<CENTER>From next door neighbour's windows appears a very haggard head,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We swear that when we get inside,  we'll give the lad some more !</CENTER>
<CENTER>We try the phone to tell him,  that we wish to come in,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But gelignite won't raise him, he's still totally unaware,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We pummel on the doors and walls,  and then we just give in. </CENTER>
<CENTER>There is a situation,  and it's happening right here.</CENTER></FONT>
<P>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>And then comes inspiration,  a ladder then is sought,</CENTER>
<CENTER>A workmate and a ladder are dutifully despatched,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And by the means of recovery truck the ladder do be brought.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Then in a quiet conflab, a plan is carefully hatched.</CENTER>
<CENTER>There's just one point of entry,  it's just above your head,</CENTER>
<CENTER>If  you find our wee problem,  please tell him of our joy,</CENTER></FONT>
<P>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>And when one gets inside there,  climb down using the bed,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And jump upon the head of the one that we call "boy".</CENTER></FONT>
<P>
<font color=yellow><font color=yellow><CENTER>A half an hour passes with one man stuck in a window,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Before he disappears inside with a sudden awful rush,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I hope that the way is all clear sailing from here now,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Without a solitary single toy suffering a crush.</CENTER>
<CENTER>The front door hence is opened wide for us to gain an access,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Fags and a drink to celebrate the success of our plan,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Our thanks to him are manyfold, this much we must confess,</CENTER>
<CENTER>To P.C., who's our hero; another recovery man.</CENTER></FONT>
