<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">A Danish man having surgery on his backside broke wind and set his genitals alight.</P>
</FONT>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">A surgeon was removing a mole on his backside with an electric knife when the man broke wind, lighting a spark.</P></FONT>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">His genitals had been washed with surgical spirits and caught fire.</P></FONT>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">He's suing the hospital for pain and suffering and loss of income.</P></FONT>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">He says he had to take extra time off work and can't have sex with his wife. The hospital says it was an unfortunate accident.</P></FONT>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">"When I woke up, my penis and scrotum were burning like hell," the man told Danish Newspaper BT.</P></FONT>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Surgeon Dr Jorn Kristensen said: "No-one considered the possibility the man would break wind during the operation, let alone that it would catch fire. It was an unfortunate accident."</P></FONT>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">The 30-year-old patient said: "I've had to be booked off work for longer than expected and, besides the pain, I can't have sex with my wife."<p></P></FONT>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">The operation which was being carried out at the Kjellerups hospital, was aborted immediately after the accident.</P></FONT>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Reports says it's unlikely the doctor will face disciplinary action.</P></FONT>
