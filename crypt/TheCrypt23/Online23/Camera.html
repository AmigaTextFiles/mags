<IMG SRC="Images/camera002.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="200" ALT="Cam002.jpg"><font color=aqua>When I bought the kids a P.C , one of the many things that came with it, was 
a digital camera.<p></p>

<p>I should hasten to point out that it wasnt a CoolPix or anything quite so 

  upmarket. Nevertheless , it is a digital camera.</p>



<p>This is the camera, a Fashion Cam to be precise.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, this isnt the equipment to buy if you are looking for 

  high quality cameras..in fact all the pictures shown in this  part were taken 

  by my webcam as I couldnt get the right focus or white balance for the box 

  that I have pictured. But more about that later.</p></font></blockquote><font color=aqua>

<p>The box that contained the camera has everything you need to know really. Above, 

  pix of the description of how it can be used and the OSs supporting the camera.. 

  it also supports XP, but  doesnt mention it. I suppose the bit about Win2000 

  is the giveaway there.</p></blockquote>

As you can see from the picture, it comes with a CD of software to handle the 
camera and the necessary drivers for it as well as having a carry case and strap 
for the camera. Surprisingly enough, batteries are included.<p></p>

<p>The quickstart guide details all the  icons on the LCD display of the camera 

  to show how to operate it.</p>

The details. It has a maximum resolution of 640 x 480. It is autofocus, but 

  has a small switch at one side to switch to macro mode for close-ups of 12 

  or less.

There is no screen to preview the pictures but you can either delete all the 

  pictures manually or the last taken from the controls. The controls are three 

  small buttons at the side of the LCD display, which let you cycle through the 

  various options. The unit uses two AA alkaline batteries and , to date, has 

  taken well over 200 pictures (some using the flash mode)  and the batteries 

  are still going strong. The camera has 8mb of internal flash memory which is 

  not upgradeable.<br><br><br><br><br>

<IMG SRC="Images/camera013.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="200" ALT="Cam013.jpg">

The camera can be used as a webcam as well and is capable of taking small movies 

  which are saved in AVI format. The pictures are saved as BMP. It also has a 

  self timer.<p></p>

The camera switches itself off when not in use to conserve batteries after 

  apprx. 60 seconds.<p></p>

<p>I am loath to slate this small camera. It is good in what it does and with 

  8mb of memory is good for apprx. 30 pictures at the maximum res. For kids and 

  adults alike , the camera is a small lightweight companion which will faithfully 

  capture anything you decide to click at. </p>

<p>After saying that, it isnt good..</p>

<p>It lacks any sort of picture preview, so you are stuck with the pictures you 

  have taken until you plug into a P.C. and decide if they are worth keeping. 

  As I said earlier, I failed miserably to take the pictures of the box that you 

  can see throughout the article. The white balance and focus are automatic and 

  the close-up feature is a bit of a joke when you try out these things. The flash 

  works well, but I tend to find reading the LCD display a chore as it is so small. 

  Getting the pictures into the P.C. is simple since it is USB. It also means 

  that there is very little time wasted in transferring. The software provided 

  with the camera is adequate for the job, but I prefer to use PhotoSuite myself, 

  simply hitting acquire and selecting the Fashion Cam as the source. My kids 

  are delighted with the camera and have played with it frequently , snapping 

  anything within range. They took pictures of the local area and used them as 

  backdrops for their desktops, so it cant be that bad a quality</p>

<IMG SRC="Images/camera017.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="200" ALT="Cam017.jpg">Here is our cat , for example, at rest after killing most of the nearby rodent 

  and bird population. Now this was taken by the Fashion Cam. As you can see, 

  the quality is good enough for WebPages and the like , and this is where its 

  strength lies.<p></p>



<p>If you are looking for seriously good photos, this isnt the camera you want. 

  Get something like a 4 mega pixel job. If , on the other hand, you want something 

  that will do webpage pictures.. this could be it. Here are some more examples 

  of how well it takes photos.</p>

<p>So, as you can see, it does produce all sorts of pictures and they are good 

  enough for the Web, but for real quality , you will need a lot better. As for 

  this Fashion Cam, I like it for all those little features and nice touches, 

  like the self timer. It could do with some better features, but I presume they 

  would all push the cost up and this is a camera selling for £70 or less. If 

  you want a small camera ideal for sending pictures by email or on your site, 

  this is worthwhile..just remember the limitations!!</p></font>
