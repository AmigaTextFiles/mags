  and a mind- bending 6 metre wingspan are often reported in Chile as well as 
  other South American countries. The beating of their wings is said to be so 
  loud that it sounds like thunder, which is how the creatures got their name. 
  Witnesses describe the thunderbird as looking like a prehistoric bird and point 
  to book illustrations of pterosaurs, said to have become extinct 65 million 
  years ago! But there are so many wild, jungle-covered parts of South America 
  that almost anything could live there and escape detection.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the ancient, megalithic cities in South America use enormous,
carved  stones  as building blocks.  Their irregular shapes withstand
earthquakes  and  they  weigh up to 200 tonnes!  No mortar is used to
hold  them together, but you can't slide a piece of paper between the
stones.   No-one knows how the ancient builders carved and fitted the
stones  so  perfectly.  A plant juice which turns stone soft could be
the  answer.   A  jar  of  liquid found in an old tomb was spilt on a
rock.   Explorer  Colonel  Fawcett  said, 'It was as if the stone had
melted,  like heated wax.' In 1911, a Peruvian explorer told of a man
whose metal spurs had corroded away during a long jungle walk through
red, fleshy-leafed plants.  Locals said the plants were used to shape
and fit the stones.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stories of a great lost South American city, built by unknown people,
have  kept  explorers  excited for centuries.  It's rooms are said to
have  had permanent lighting created by 'captured stars' or crystals.
Once dismissed by many as being impossible things for an ancient race
to  have  achieved,  we now know it could have been done.  Scientists
have  grown  crystals  of quartz containing phosphorus.  This crystal
absorbs  daylight,  and  then  gives  out it's stored light at night,
rather  like  a  storage  battery.  A light like this could shine for
years.</P>

The first weighed 50 kilos and made an enormous hole in the roof of a
bus  factory  in  Campinas.  The second fell about 60km further north
and  created a big crater in the ground.  The local airport announced
that  no  planes had been in the area when the ice blocks fell!  This

Fawcett  shot  it  dead,  then  measured it.  It was nearly 19 metres

early  1970s,  Brazilian  explorer  Mariano  da  Silva  discovered  a
carnivorous  tree  near the Brazilian boarder with Guyana.  This tree
uses  a vicious trick to catch it's dinner - it puts out a scent that
monkeys  cannot  resist.   They  are lured to the tree and climb it's
trunk.   As  the  monkey  starts  to  climb,  the tree's large leaves
swiftly  wrap around the unsuspecting creature, and completely enfold
it.   A  few  days later, the leaves unfurl and out drop the bones of
the  unlucky  monkey.   By  this  time, every scrap of flesh has been
removed and consumed by the hungry tree.  Although known to the local
people,  scientists  have  yet  to  examine a specimen of this deeply
spooky tree!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Indians of the Amazon have long told tales of a bizarre creature
called  a mapinguary.  It is a giant red-furred creature that is said
to  leave  back-to-front footprints!  But it's most freaky feature is
it's  'extra  mouth'  in  the  middle  of  it's belly!  When it feels
threatened,  it  lets out a truly vile stench from this second mouth,
which,  the  Indians say, is strong enough to suffocate any attacker!
The  mapinguary  is  also  said  to be bullet-proof.  Some scientists
think  this  mystery beast may be related to a mylodontid, an extinct
prehistoric  ground sloth.  Whatever it is, the jungles of the Amazon
are so dense that it may not be the only prehistoric survivor.</P>

spotted  what looks like an ancient city in south-eastern Peru.  It's
pictures  reveal  twelve pyramids, some of which are nearly as big as
the  Great  Pyramid  of Giza, in Egypt.  Various expeditions have set
out  to  find these weird, ancient wonders and several explorers have
died  in the attempt.  Even now, over 20 years later, no-one has been

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Poltergeists  usually focus on one person but, in 1973, in the jungle
near Ponta Pora, on the boarder of Brazil and Paraguay, a poltergeist
homed  in  on  an entire village.  At first, local's beds were raised
into  the  air,  whilst  they  were sleeping, and pushed around by an
unseen force!  Then a 76 year old farm worker and local children were
pelted  by  a  hailstorm  of  tomatoes.   When  a  reporter  came  to
investigate,  his  jeep  mysteriously  moved itself 40 metres uphill,
leaving  no  tracks  in the mud.  Torch batteries and an iron railing
materialised  on the reporter's bed, only seconds after he'd left the
room.   Burn marks began to appear all over a house.  The final straw
came  when  a  farmer's  baby disappeared in it's pram.  The baby was
later  found,  unharmed, beneath a tree on the farm.  Eventually, the
poltergeist moved it's activities elsewhere and village life returned
to normal at last.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1997, a snake the size of two buses was spotted slithering through
the  Amazon.   Villagers reckoned the jet black boa constrictor was a
record-breaking  40m  long  and  4.6m  in diameter.  It trampled down
trees  and  left a ditch wide enough to drive a vehicle through, they
said.   After  making  a  grand appearance, the boa made a big splash
into  the  River Napo, never to be seen again.  Only five people from
the  village  of  Nuevo Tacna actually saw it, but hundreds said they
felt  it  move.  When the news hit the airwaves, reporters joked that
villages  must have mistaken the boa for a large lorry.  According to
locals,  however,  machinery  of that sort is banned from the forest.

mountain!   Machu Picchu is totally invisible from below and, when it
was  built  500  years  ago,  the  only entrance was through a single
doorway.   Once  the inhabitants had climbed up, they never needed to
go  back  down.   The city had houses, jails, temples, a cemetery and
abundant  crops.   There  was  even a solar clock which told them the
time.   Although  a  great  deal  is known about Machu Picchu itself,
no-one  knows  what happened to the inhabitants as few skeletons were

a guardian light, that is shaped like a person with a big round head.</P>

Mount  Ampato.   Incredibly, she was almost perfectly preserved after
500  years.   Her remains revealed some gruesome clues as to her last
hours  alive.   Apparently,  she  ate  a meal of vegetables six hours
before  she  was  clubbed to death.  After that, she would have taken
two  weeks  to freeze from the outside in.  Tests on her clothing and

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Brothers Tim and Dave were fascinated by tales of lost ancient cities
and  carried out extensive research before their trip to Brazil.  One
article  referred  to  the ancient people of Akakor.  and told of how
these  people  were  visited  by  an alien race with flying machines.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reports  of  vast  underground  cities  connected  by secret tunnels,
fascinated  the  two  men,  who  decided  to  explore that particular
region.   Armed  with  survival  equipment, cameras, maps and a whole
load  of  enthusiasm,  they arrived at one of the villages which they
had  read  about. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  Their arrival in the village caused much interest
and  they  were  introduced  to  a  local  man  who  claimed  to be a
descendant  of the ancient race of Akakor.  They spoke at length with
the  man,  and  listened,  entranced,  as  he  related  tales  of his
ancestors. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  They  were  spellbound  when  he  mentioned  the  secret
entrances  to  the  tunnels,  but he warned that these entrances were
booby-trapped  to  stop  unwanted  visitors.   After the meeting, Tim
decided  that  the  exploration would be too dangerous, and suggested
deciding  the  following  day  where they should head next. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The next
morning,  Tim  found  to  his  horror, a note from Dave saying he was
sorry,  but  he  would have to go on, and had found a guide who would
lead  him  to the tunnel entrances.  Tim could only wait anxiously in
the  village for Dave's return.  Tim had almost given up hope of ever
seeing  his  brother  again,  when,  twelve  months later, a stranger
arrived in the village.  So strange was he, with long white hair, and
wild  staring  eyes,  that Tim did not recognise his own brother!  He
never  spoke,  but  continued  on his journey.  Dave remained a total
stranger, but wrote just once, a brief note to say that he had indeed
found  the  secret  tunnels of the ancient Akakor people.  No further
contact  was  ever  made between the two men, and Tim never found out
what  had  caused  the immense change in his brother, or where he had
gone.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  man recently returned from travelling round South America with the
strangest  story  he  had heard on route.  He had stayed in a village
where  the locals told him about how their bravest man and his family
had  died  in  the strangest way.  Julio and his two sons were highly
respected.   Julio  was  always  available to entertain the villagers
with  his  devil-may-care  attitude.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  He was always good for a wager,
taking  on  the  most dangerous tasks.  Luis was growing up just like
his father, strong, brave and totally fearless.  One night, Julio and
some  of  his friends spotted a coral snake - a shy but deadly snake.
Julio's  friends  dared him to kill the snake by just stomping on it.
He  was  always  ready  to  prove  how  brave  he was, and, as usual,
accepted  the  task.   Boldly, he strolled up close to the snake.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  It
saw  him and was not amused.  It reared up ready to attack, but Julio
was  ready  and  bought  his  boot  down  on  it's  head,  killing it
instantly.   Once again, Julio was the hero of the evening and he and
his  friends  laughed and celebrated well into the night.  A few days
later,  unexpectedly,  his  son  found him dead on the bedroom floor.
There  were  no  signs  to indicate how he had died.  His eldest son,
Luis, was expected to follow in his father's footsteps, and as a mark
of  respect,  he  kept  his father's boots.  Keen to don his father's
mantle,  he pulled on the boots, and headed out on his horse into the
desert.   Two  days  later,  the  horse  and Luis returned.  Luis was
slumped  over  the  horse's back.  Villagers helped him down, fearing
that  he was ill.  He was, in fact, dead, and had been for some time.
The  villagers mourned yet another of Julio's family, and, after Luis
had been buried with his father, the boots passed down to the younger
son.  One week later, he also died.  The villager's became worried in
case they too would die in mysterious circumstances, so called in the
local  doctor  to  examine the boy.  The cause was eventually tracked
down  to  the boots!  On examination, a small part of a coral snake's
fang  was found embedded in the sole of one of the boots, which still
contained  enough  venom  to kill all the members of the family.  The
snake had had it's revenge!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David  had  saved  for  months  towards  his  dream  holiday to South
America.   He  wanted  to see the Amazon rainforests while there were
some  left  to  see.   Before he left, he had to visit his doctor for
vaccinations.   Whilst there, the doctor advised him that swimming in
the  Amazon,  no  matter  how  tempting was very unwise.  A few weeks
later,  when  in  Brazil,  he  booked  himself on a tour of the local
rainforest.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">   A  few  days  later,  he  met  up  with  the  guide and
introduced  himself  to  the other members of the group.  Then it was
time  to sample the real taste and experience of the rainforest.</P>

  The
hum  of  insects and noises from unseen animals and birds hung in the
hot  steamy  atmosphere.  After a few days of trekking and much work,
they finally reached the shores of the great Amazon river, where they
stopped  to  rest  and  soak up the atmosphere.  They were to visit a
small  village  nearby  and meet the locals before returning to their
hotel.   Whilst  they waited for their guide who had gone on ahead to
inform  the villagers of their arrival, they lazed about on the banks
of  the  Amazon,  taking photos and chatting among themselves. 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> David
decided the temptation was too great not to take a dip in the Amazon.
What  a  tale  he could tell when he got home.  It was so hot and the
water  looked  cool  and inviting, so he took off his boots and dived
in.   Next  minute,  David was startled by the guide shouting out his
name.   Turning  towards  him,  he  accidentally swallowed some river
water. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  The  guide  was  less  than  happy,  and  raged  against the
stupidity  of  the  man,  and  warned  them all of the dangers of the
Amazon  river,  of  the  creatures who lived in and around the water.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless,  the  rest  of the trip passed uneventfully, and before
long,  David had returned home to show off his photos and his healthy
tan.   Over  the  next few weeks, David's appetite grew.  Although he
ate  and  ate,  he  grew  thinner. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  His  worried parents insisted he
visited  the  doctor,  who was alarmed enough to have him admitted to
hospital immediately.  Eventually, the surgeon decided to operate and
found  a  metre  long,  pale  snake  inside  David's stomach.  Whilst
swimming  in  the  Amazon, he had unknowingly swallowed a tiny, newly
hatched  watersnake,  which was now full grown.  David rarely fancies
swimming  now,  but when he does, he always makes sure that his mouth
is tightly closed!</P>

Carnival,  but  be on your guard against thieves, unlike Tom, who had
the most alarming experience on holiday there.  Many Brazilians spend
all year designing their masks and costumes ready for the event.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  Tom
was delighted and took loads of photos.  There was plenty to see, and
the   costumes  were  fabulous.   He  was  caught  up  in  the  party
atmosphere,  dancing  in  the streets, drinking from the many bottles
passed   around,  partying  all  night  long. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  Finally,  he  rested,
exhausted,  in  the  bar  in  his  cheap  hotel.   A friendly pair of
revellers  started  a conversation, and talk turned round to where he
was  from.  One of them offered to buy him a drink, but Tom felt he'd
probably  had  more than enough alcohol than was really good for him,
so  he  agreed  to  just  an  orange  juice  for politeness sake. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> He
continued  chatting  and drank his drink, and then got up and excused
himself,  explaining he had had a fantastic time, but now he suddenly
felt  very tired, indeed.  The couple kindly offered to help him back
to  his  hotel  room. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  When he awoke, he felt ghastly.  He staggered
into  the shower room, hoping a shower would improve how he felt, and
then  stopped  in  horror.  In the mirror, he could see he now had an
enormous  stitched-up knife wound in his side!  He dressed as quickly
as he could, and took a cab to the nearest hospital where he was told
he  had  probably  been drugged, and, whilst unconscious, someone had
operated  on  him  and stolen one of his kidneys!  A doctor explained
that  selling  body parts was a booming business worldwide, and, once
taken, a body part can't say where it came from!</P>
