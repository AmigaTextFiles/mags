<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Celestial Chinese Dragon is comparable as the symbol of 
  the Chinese race itself. Chinese around the world, proudly proclaim themselves 
  "Lung Tik Chuan Ren" (Descendants of the Dragon). Dragons are referred to as 
  the divine mythical creature that brings with it ultimate abundance, prosperity 
  and good fortune.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the emblem of the Emperor and the Imperial command,  the legend
of  the  Chinese Dragon permeates the ancient Chinese civilization
and  shaped their culture until today.  Its benevolence  signifies
greatness, goodness and blessings.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Chinese  Dragon,  or Lung ,  symbolizes power and excellence
valiancy  and  boldness,  heroism and perseverance,  nobility  and
divinity.  A dragon overcomes obstacles until success is his.   He
is energetic, decisive, optimistic, intelligent and ambitious.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike  the the negative energies associated with Western Dragons,
most Eastern Dragons are beautiful,  friendly,  and wise. They are
the angels of the Orient.  Instead of being hated,  they are loved
and  worshipped.   Temples and shrines have been  built  to  honor
them,  for they control the rain,  rivers,  lakes,  and seas. Many
Chinese cities have pagodas where people used to burn incense  and
pray to dragons.  The Black Dragon Pool Chapel,  near Peking,  was
reserved for the Empress and her court.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Special  worship  services  took place  there  on  the  first  and
fifteenth of every month.  Dragon shrines and altars can still  be
seen  in  many  parts  of the Far East.  They  are  usually  along
seashores  and riverbanks,  because most Eastern Dragons  live  in
water.  The Isle of the Temple,  in Japan's Inland Sea, has become
a  famous  stopover for pilgrims who meditate and pray to dragons.
Both  male  and  female  dragons have mated  with  humans.   Their
descendants  became great rulers.  The Japanese  Emperor  Hirohito
traced  his  ancestry  back 125 generations to  Princess  Fruitful
Jewel,   daughter of a Dragon King of the Sea.Ê Emperors  in  many
Asian countries claimed to have dragon ancestors.  This made  them
so  proud,   that everything they used was decorated with  dragons
and described in terms of the dragon:  dragon-throne, dragon-robe,
dragon-bed,  dragon-boat.  Calling an emperor "dragon-face" was  a
supreme  compliment.   People believed that  rulers  could  change
themselves into dragons.  For hundreds of years, Japanese emperors
sat  concealed  behind  bamboo curtains  whenever  visitors  came.
Anyone who dared to peek was condemned to death.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everything connected with Eastern Dragons is blessed.  The Year of
the Dragon which takes place ever twelve years, is lucky. Present-
day  Oriental  astrologersclaim that children  born  dunng  Dragon
Years enjoy health,  wealth,  and long life.  (1964 and 1976  were
Dragon Years.)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dragons  are  so  wise  that they have  been  royal  advisors.   A
thirteenth-century Cambodian king spent his  nights  in  a  golden
tower,  where he consulted with the real ruler of the land a nine-
headed  dragon.  Eastern Dragons are vain,  even though  they  are
wise.  They are insulted when a ruler doesn't follow their advice,
or  when people don't honor their importance.  Then,  by thrashing
about,  dragons either stop making rain and cause water shortages,
or  they breathe black clouds that bring storms and floods.  Small
dragons do minor mischief,  such as making roofs leak,  or causing
rice  to be sticky.  People set off firecrackers and carry immense
paper  dragons  in special parades.  They also race  dragon-shaped
boats in water all to please and appease their dragons.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Dragon brings upon the essence of life,  in the form  of  its
celestial breath,  known to many as sheng chi.  He yields life and
bestows its power in the form of the seasons,  bringing water from
rain,  warmth from the sunshine,  wind from the seas and soil from
the  earth.   The  Dragon is the ultimate  representation  of  the
forces of Mother Nature. The greatest divine force on Earth.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Chinese  Dragon  is  often  seen  as  the  symbol  of  divine
protection  and  vigilance.  It is regarded as the  Supreme  Being
amongst  all creatures.  It has the ability to live in  the  seas,
fly  up  the  heavens and coiled up in the land  in  the  form  of
mountains.  Being the divine mythical animal,  the Dragon can ward
off  wandering  evil  spirits,  protect the  innocent  and  bestow
safety  to all that hold his emblem.  The Chinese Dragon  is  look
upon as the ultimate symbol of Good Fortune.</P>
