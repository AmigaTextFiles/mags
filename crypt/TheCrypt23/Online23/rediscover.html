</font><blockquote><font color=red>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was on a wet and windy  weekend that the AmigaPower team came face to 
face with the AmigaOne. Alan, Gina et Elsa Redhouse had kindly invited us 
to visit them in Quillan (near Perpignan, in the South of France), a 
delightful little town nestling amid magnificent scenery that required just 
a little more sunshine to make it perfect.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was our chance to talk about the AmigaOne G3-SE, the computer which 
should, if all goes well,  represent the culmination of a very long series 
of events indeed.  To recapitulate: nearly 2 years ago,  Eyetech had orders 
for PPC Amiga accelerator cards totalling over 200 000 Euros. DCE was 
either having difficulty delivering, or were themselves short of components 
(we all know how easy it is to get DCE cards), so Eyetech decided to 
produce their own card in partnership with Escena: the G3-powered Predator 
SE for A1200, which included AGP and PCI buses, and used SDRAM memory. As 
work progressed, it became clear that it would be simpler to go the whole 
hog and produce a motherboard which would, to begin with, connect to an 
Amiga 1200 in order to gain access to the native AGA chipset. So the 
AmigaOne was announced, and was to be made by Escena.
But two years on, Escena still hasn't delivered: neither the AmigaOne, nor 
anything else for the Amiga market.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eyetech's Amiga sales are now suffering. Irritated by the delays, Alan 
Redhouse nevertheless manages to find an interesting solution: an American 
company called MAI is offering PPC motherboards equipped with the chipset 
Articia S chipset, which enables interfacing of a PowerPC chip for AGP, 
PCI, USB, sound, ethernet and everything else a modern computer user 
requires. What we saw last Sunday  was a pre-production board based on the 
TeronCX with ArticiaS and a PPC G3 CX clocked at 500 Mhz . It was equipped 
with SDRAM memory and a PCI ATI Rage graphics card.</P></font>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should be noted that the production version will ship with a CXe at 600 
MHz, and will include an ethernet chipset and an AMR card that will provide 
connectors for speakers, a gameport, and a modem.
The set-up was running TurboLinux, a version of Linux PPC specially 
compiled for the TeronCX. This flavour of Linux boots very fast and seemed 
to have no major deficiencies on first sight, apart from the slowness of 
moving windows around. This was due to  X11 and the fact that the OS 
doesn't activate the G3's second level cache.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The design of the card is very clean, with no excessive heating of the 
various key components (VIA chipset, Articia S and G3), unlike x86 boards. 
We were also able to install the carte in a Naya Design 'Cristo' tower and 
took a few photos so show what the new Amiga looks like in a tower worthy 
of the name.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that, with the AmigaOne G3-SE, Eyetech is on the right 
track as far as hardware is concerned. Even if the specifications are 
already somewhat out-of-date compared to the eternal spiral of the PC 
world, it still gives the various alternative computing communities (Amiga, 
Be, Linux, Atari, etc.) an excellent price/quality ratio. A motherboard 
with built-in ethernet, sound, son, USB and modem costs 600 Euros (ex. 
VAT), which is extremely competitive when compared with Apple's pricing.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One problem still remains: the software. Apart from TurboLinux, there is 
nothing to install on this AmigaOne. The first buyers (who will receive 
their boards at the end of April) have therefore been warned: to begin they 
will only be able to run 68k Amiga applications, and only using UAE for 
Linux. This situation will continue until AmigaOS 4, which Hyperion 
Entertainment have been working on since last November, is released. For 
the moment, the final release date is unknown.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hardware future of the AmigaOne is assured. A more expensive version 
should appear before the end of the year,  with a socketed, instead of 
soldered, CPU, allowing installation of one or two G4 processors. The new 
ArticiaP should give access to AGP x4 instead of the current x2 .</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A few questions still remain, for example the efficiency of the firmware 
(the low-level OS which initialises all the peripherals connected to the 
machine), and the overall performance under AmigaOS 4. The AmigaOne G3-SE 
is practically assured of an honourable career, though there is still the 
threat posed by the reportedly imminent release of the unofficial, but 
fiercely persistent Pegasos, made by bPlan and running under MorphOS.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">In the meantime, we wish Alan the best of luck and hope he enjoys his stay 
in the South of France.</P></font>
