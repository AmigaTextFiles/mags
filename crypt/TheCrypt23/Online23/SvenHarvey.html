  <P align=left>I was born on 6th May 1975 in Birmingham, at the centre of 
  England. This makes me 26 years of age plus I have the bonus of being married 
  to the gorgeous Claire (nee Higgins) and we have three great kids - Sophie, 
  Will and Daniel.</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P align=left>I attended the excellent King Edward VI Five Ways Grammar School 
  from 1986 to 1993 and since the age of 15 I have worked in the realm of home 
  computer and software retailing. I am currently employed as a "Store Games 
  Buyer" for a High Street Chain. My Spare time job is the Amiga Mart Columnist 
  in the Micromart Magazine.</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P align=left>My hobbies include model making (when I get the time) - mainly 
  of Star Trek starships, my fave being the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-E. I do a 
  lot of computing on my Amiga 4000 (I also own an A1000, A500, A2000, CD32 with 
  FMV card, CDTV, 2 A500+ systems (one with an A570 CD drive)- there is also an 
  A1200HD and A600HD in the house).</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT color=silver>

  <P align=justify>I am part of the science fiction and Amiga group, Infinite 
  Frontiers with whom I am an editor, artist, photographer, writer and producer. 
  My main drive with Infinite Frontiers are the production of the two fanzines I 
  work on as Editor, The Cybertronian Times and Amiga Energy (actually as 
  co-editor on AE). I have in the past though worked on the majority of the 
  Infinite Frontiers titles that have appeared since my first involvement with 
  IF in 1994. I am a massive Transformers fan. My other sci-fi and fantasy faves 
  include the recent Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures Of Superman TV series, 
  which in my opinion ended far too prematurely (if only Lois hadn't found out 
  and they hadn't got married...). I love Knight Rider and the follow up Knight 
  Rider 2000 TV movie... I find Team Knight Rider very dry and boring however... 
  I also enjoy Airwolf, Battlestar Galactica all of the Star Treks (but 
  especially Star Trek: The Next Generation).</P></FONT>

    <P align=left>Since the release of the first Amiga, the A1000, in 1985 the 
    Amiga has represented true multimedia and efficient elegant computing, even 
    before the term "multimedia" was coined.</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

    <P align=justify>The legend was reborn in 2000 following the purchase of 
    Amiga from Gateway by two of their own former employees, whom in turn formed 
    Amino Developments. Now the renamed Amino own Amiga, the Amiga OS and are 
    the guardians of its future as Amiga, inc. based in Snoqualmie, Washington 
    State, USA. Fortunately Fleecy Moss, Bill McEwen and the others at Amiga, 
    Inc. are dyed-in-the-wool Amigans and after reading the early press releases 
    its also clear that they have a very weird sense of humor which matches mine 
    and are totally nuts... which will probably help more than anything 
    else!</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

    <P align=justify>Saturday 8th January 2000 saw the start of the first CES in 
    Las Vegas of the new year/century/millennium (delete as applicable!) and 
    also saw the start of a new era for the Amiga as the new Amiga Corporation 
    made their first announcement for the future. Amiga Corp. have partnered 
    with Tao Group, a small software development company who just happen to be 
    financed by Motorola and Sony. Tao also have full Java development status 
    with Sun and produce the Elate OS kernal and a very AmigaObject (RIP) 
    sounding intent object system, which BTW runs on QNX, Linux, most Windoze 
    flavours and OS9000. Apparently Tao started off on Amigas too, which can 
    only help!</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

    Amiga Energy, which is a UK paper-based (rather than web-based or 
    disk-based) Amiga fanzine.</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
