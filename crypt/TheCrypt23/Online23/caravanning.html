  <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=AQUA>When you go trundling off, into the wide blue 
    yonder, (</font><I>or, as is much more likely, another traffic jam</I>!<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) 
    you'll suddenly start thinking; "We've got a corkscrew, but have we got a 
    tin opener?"</font></P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=AQUA>Forgetting something is perfectly normal, even 
    for those of us that go camping more often. Just think how you'll feel if 
    you arrive on site to discover you've left something essential (</font><I>like 
    the caravan</I>!<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) at home!</font></P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>Make a list.  Put on it anything that you'll reasonably need for your time away.</CENTER></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><CENTER>Much of the equipment you'll need can be categorised, and at its most simple, there are 4 main categories;</CENTER></FONT>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">1.<FONT COLOR=Yellow> stuff for the basic running of the caravan.</font></P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT COLOR=AQUA>Here we include such things as gas bottle(</font>s<FONT COLOR=AQUA>), 
    awning, tent pegs and mallet, water and waste containers and associated pipes, 
    corner steady plates, corner steady handle, cassette toilet/toilet tent (<font color=white><I>remember 
    the thistles?</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>), caravan step, EHU (</FONT><I>Electric 
    Hook-Up</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>) lead, and wheel chocks.</font></font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Corner Steadies? These are the tiny little legs that are 
    fitted to the corners of caravans, and the back ends of motorhomes. They resemble 
    screw-jacks that are welded to the chassis, and are wound up and down by a 
    device rather like the starting handle that used to be supplied with cars! 
    Corner steady plates are plates of wood or metal that are put down under the 
    corner steadies to prevent them sinking in soft ground. There are also plates 
    called 'BigFeet' that can be permanently attached to the corner steady.</P>
  </FONT> <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The EHU lead is usually orange in colour, so it can be easily 
    seen, and has a blue circular plug on each end. This is to bring mains power 
    into the 'van.</P>
  </FONT> <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A sub-category may be added to this; a kit to be kept in 
    either car or caravan, consisting of map, torch, spare bulbs and fuses, a 
    few tools, and a first aid kit. It may be that such items are already carried 
    in the car, which is no bad thing. I usually also carry pen and paper, but 
    that's because I have a terrible memory, and if I don't write it down, I'll 
    forget it!</P>
  </FONT> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">2.<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> stuff for the basic running of the occupants.</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This includes crockery, cutlery, kettle, cooking utensils, 
    washing up liquid and bowl (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>I keep wanting to say 'set 
    of sliding doors' and 'Keep thinking luvvly thoughts</I>!'</FONT>), tin opener, 
    kitchen rolls, foodstuffs, cleaning materials, matches or tapers, tea towels, 
    etcetera. Remember though, that the fridge in a caravan is quite small, so 
    what doesn't get eaten in one meal may have to be thrown away, because there's 
    nowhere to keep it!</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Foodstuffs also include salt, pepper, tomato ketchup, brown 
    sauce, pickle, mustard, sugar, tea, coffee, and cocoa, as well as the normal 
    nosh!</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">As far as food itself is concerned, we take enough for the day 
    we're travelling, and the few days on site until the next normal working day. 
    It matters little where you normally shop as supermarkets are so prolific 
    now, you won't be more than about 30 minutes drive away from one!</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">But then, if you're going to be camping in the wilds, you'll 
    need to take extra food anyhow, or stock up just before you leave civilisation.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=WHITE>3.</FONT><FONT COLOR=YELLOW> stuff for the 
    basic comfort of the occupants.</font></P>
  </FONT> <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This list is more personal, and would need to be made up 
    by each individual. Clothes, toiletries, sleeping bags (couple of extra blankets, 
    just in case!) pillows, yadda, yadda, yadda. I have always added a couple 
    of days extra clothes, just in case of disaster. Dry clothes are much nicer 
    than their soggy counterparts!</P>
  </FONT> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">4.<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> stuff for the extra comfort of the occupants.</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This list is the one to watch. This is where you add the 
    deck chairs, patio table, wind break, gas barbeque, bikes, scuba gear and 
    the paragliding kit! Then wonder why the 'van is overweight and handles like 
    a bag of warm manure!</P>
  </FONT> <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Another thing to remember is that some of the things I choose 
    to leave behind, you may regard as essential, and vice versa.</P>
  </FONT> <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">I have seen some people trying to 'get away from it all', but 
    a quick peep into their accomodation only proves that they've taken most of 
    it with them!</P>
  </FONT> <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many modern caravans are fitted with air conditioning, full 
    central heating, and power shower as standard. Then some people MUST take 
    their TV, video, microwave, and CD player! And there's also computers, and 
    mobile internet set ups!</P>
  </FONT> <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Clic members have taken huge gas barbeques, windbreaks, 
    full awnings, chairs, tables, beds and bedding, and food with them, not for 
    themselves, but for others!</P>
  </FONT> <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Easter 2002 saw a Clic gathering at Roundhill, in the New 
    Forest. Allen presides, (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>well, he spends 5 months there 
    in his caravan</i></FONT>!) and bought venison sausages, burgers and half 
    a ton of salad, Gaynor (<I><FONT COLOR=WHITE>from Jersey</FONT></I>) took 
    Jersey cream and Calvados, Sooosssaaannn (she writes it like that!) from Belfast 
    turned up with a vast quantity of genuine Irish sausages, Don and Jane supplied 
    a very large awning, and those that had gazebo's, erected them in such a manner 
    that they could be used as a beer/food tent!</P>
  <BR>
  <BR>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG SRC="Images/BARBECUE.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="240" ALT="barbecue.gif.gif"></P>
  <FONT COLOR=SILVER><I> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">And I couldn't go!</P>
  </I></FONT> <BR>
  <BR>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">I'm not saying that you will have to supply half the campsite 
    with goodies, unless you really want to, but that is what rallying is about. 
    If you just go to a site for a holiday, you can interact with other campers 
    as you wish, but if you're rallying, you'll be almost expected to join in 
    with the 'group' activities!</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Remember that anything that you add will increase the overall 
    weight of the outfit, though! And some items like gas bottles, caravan battery, 
    and awning are going to be quite heavy!</P>
  <BR>
  <BR>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of this last list will depend on what kind of site you've 
    decided to stay at. A club or rally site may have a toilet, but it may not. 
    A basic site will usually give you a toilet/shower block, chemical toilet 
    disposal point, and a small shop. Some sites go beyond that, and offer hot 
    showers 24-7, hard-standings, EHU, cafe, public phone, laundry facilities, 
    Calor Gas supplies, etc.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the better equipped sites may also offer a TV hook-up. 
    mains water hook-up, and water drainage, but these 'super-pitches' are few 
    and far between. Some sites boast a club house or restaurant, but these will 
    be reflected in the price, whether you use it or not! Besides, there'll probably 
    be a decent pub or restaurant within a couple of miles, anyway!</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sites with fewer 'amenities' may well be much quieter 
    than other sites, but having said that, I recently visited a site a few miles 
    away from where I live. It was a quite basic site, there were some EHU points, 
    toilet block and chemical disposals, and a small shop, but it was packed! 
    Towcars were not parked next to the 'vans, as is the norm, they had to be 
    parked 'end on' to the units!</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a play area for the kids which backed onto some 
    pitches, and I would imagine, unless they liked the sounds of screaming kids, 
    the occupants wouldn't have any peace! Still, the little so.... darlings have 
    to sleep, don't they?</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Anyhow, the upshot is if you choose a site with all mod cons, 
    you may not need to take all your goods and chattels.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also sites that get chosen for their locations, 
    for the purposes of fishing, bird-watching, cycling, visiting of relatives, 
    buildings and other crumbly old edifices!</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So, with careful planning, you can take a reasonable amount 
    of 'standard' kit (jim-jams, socks, naughty underwear, etc) as well as the 
    more specialised stuff to suit your chosen hobby. I've never been interested 
    in fishing, but I'm not dumb enough to assume that all the fishing tackle 
    will fit into a couple of carrier bags.</P>

    <I>No offence, but, unless you're Kylie Minogue, I'm not interested in your 
    underwear either!</I><IMG SRC="Images/smile17.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="25" ALT="Smile.gif.gif"> 
  </CENTER>
  </FONT> <BR>
  <BR>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Come to think of it, along with half the population of the Western 
    world, I've probably seen most of Kylie's underwear anyway!</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">But, if you're a keen cyclist (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>and again, 
    I'd expect any such to take more kit than just a bike</I></FONT>) you'll either 
    have a roof-mounted cycle-rack, or a tailgate mounted carrier, but I wouldn't 
    expect to see the cycles in the 'van! Not only would it be difficult to get 
    'em in through the door, they'd take up a fair bit of space, reduce the payload, 
    and they'd possibly damage the interior fittings.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once on site, the bikes can be stored in the awning when 
    not in use. Unless you're trying to throw yourself down a mountain astride 
    one!</P>
