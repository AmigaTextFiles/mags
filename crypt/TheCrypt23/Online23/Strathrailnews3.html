<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  the sound of Willie Nelsons City of New Orleans raises  the
hairs on the back of your neck or thoughts of a

lonesome  whistle blowing in the night send a tingle  down  your
spine you are one of the many thousands who nurture

the desire to get up on the footplate of a steam locomotive,  open
the regulator and head off on the steel road. Forget

computer simulation it is now possible to do enjoy the real thing.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Strathspey  Railway  based  at Aviemore,   Scotlands  Steam
Railway in The Highlands, is offering the

opportunity  of a Footplate Experience where  you  will  be  the
driver of one of its locomotives hauling a real train of

passenger  coaches.  A new leaflet is available from  the  railway
company detailing the event and setting out the

conditions.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LMS  designed 2-6-0 No.  46512 which was recommissioned last  year
following a rebuild at the railways Aviemore

workshops  is  the nominated locomotive.  Participants,   after  a
briefing on safety, railway operation and assisting with

the  locomotive preparation will enjoy one round  trip  as  driver
and another assisting the fireman. A lunch of soup

and sandwiches is also listed as one of the attractions.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Experience events will,  initially,  only be  available  on
selected Saturdays in April and May as the

locomotive and crews are committed to the operation of the  public
service at other times. (During the

period  June to September the Railway operates a daily service  on
the line.)</P>









<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Experience,   which   is   subject  to  certain  conditions
regarding age, health and a minimum number of

participants on the day,  is available at just over £217 including
VAT at the current rate and could be an ideal

surprise  gift  for someone who always wanted  to  be  an  engine
driver.</P>
