  <H2> Time never stands still, and neither does <font color=red>The Crypt </font>. 
  In the past we have always produced an Amiga disk version of our magazine, but as 
  more and more people move on to other platforms that means less and less people 
  could read the disk version. But one version that could be used by everyone, and 
  is more versatile than DMC is the website or HTML version.<br><br>
    It has meant a steep learning curve for us learning to write pages in the 
    new style, but we think it's worth it. And as Ian says in his editorial, we 
    are just wasting precious time making 3 versions of every issue. So from now 
    on <font color=red> The Crypt </font> will be made in a version that everyone 
    can read and enjoy and it also means we can bring you things we couldn't before, 
    like animated pictures and full colour pictures, which I'm sure you'll agree 
    is the best way forward.<br>
    <br>
	Don't forget, if you still want to read the older Amiga disk versions of <font color=red> 
	The Crypt </font> then just <a href="mailto:steve@thecryptmag.com"> E-mail </a> me and I'll send 
	you all the old issues on a CDR.<br><br>
