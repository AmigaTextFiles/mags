<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Egg  Fu Yung,  a deep fried omelette served with a sauce,  is a well
known Chinese American restaurant dish,  but in China omelettes  are
not  deepfried and are never served with a sauce.  Here  are  both
versions  using  the same ingredients,  although  the  listing  is
arranged for the first version.</P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.   Bring the stock to a boil in a saucepan.  Add the soy  sauce,
wine and pepper.  Turn down the heat.  Give the cornflour  mixture
a  stir  and  gradually  pour it into  the  stock  while  stirring
constantly until the sauce thickens.  Add the sesame oil and  stir
once more. Keep the sauce warm.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.  Combine the meat,  vegetables,  eggs,  salt and pepper and mix
well.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.   Heat a wok and add the 2 cups corn oil.  When the oil is very
hot,  about 350_ F.,  ladle in onefourth of the egg mixture.   The
egg  will  float;   as it sets,  ladle in another  fourth  of  the
mixture.   Continue until you have 4 omelettes frying.  Deepfry  the
omelettes  until  the bottoms are lightly browned,  then  turn  them
over  and  brown the other side.  Use 2 spatulas  to  remove  each
omelettefrom the wok,  pressing lightly to squeeze out some of  the
excess  oil.  Place on a serving platter.  Reheat the sauce  until
hot,  stirring once or twice.  Pour the sauce over the omelets and
serve.</P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.  Heat a wok over medium heat until hot.  Add 2 tablespoons 
oil.  Add the meat and vegetables.  Stir fry a few seconds and add
the salt and pepper.  Continue to stir fry for 2 minutes. Turn off
the  heat  and  spread the cooked mixture on  a  platter  to  cool
slightly. Clean out the wok.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.  In a large mixing bowl,  combine the beaten eggs with the meat
and vegetable mixture.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.   Reheat the Wok.  When the oil is very hot,  pour in  the  egg
mixture.  use a spatula to push the mixture back and forth as  the
eggs set.  Flip portions of the egg mixture over so that it browns
slightly  on  the  outside,  and turn offthe heat  while  the  egg
mixture is still soft on the inside. Serve hot.</P>
