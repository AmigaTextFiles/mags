<font color=yellow><CENTER>I don't know how true any of this is, but it made interesting
reading...</CENTER>

<font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.<font color=aqua> In Shakespeare's time, mattresses were secured on bed frames
by ropes when you pulled on the ropes the mattress tightened,
making the bed firmer to sleep on. Hence the phrase "goodnight
& sleep tight."</font></P><font color=aqua>

<font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.<font color=aqua> It was the accepted practice in Babylon 4,000 years ago that
for a month after the wedding, the bride's father would supply
his son-in-law with  all the mead he could drink. Mead is a
honey beer and because their calendar was lunar based; this
period was called the honey month or what was known today as
the honeymoon.</font></P><font color=aqua>

<font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.<font color=aqua> In English pubs, ale is ordered by pints and quarts. So in
old England, when customers got unruly, the bartender would
yell at them mind their own pints and quarts and settle down.
It's where we get the phrase "mind your P's and Q's."</font></P><font color=aqua>

<font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.<font color=aqua> Many years ago in England, pub frequenters had a whistle
baked into the rim or handle of their ceramic cups. When they
needed a refill, they used the whistle to get some service.
"Wet your whistle" is the phrase inspired by this practice.</font></P><font color=aqua>

<font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.<font color=aqua> In ancient England a person could not have sex unless you
had consent of the King (unless you were in the Royal Family).
When anyone wanted to have a baby, they got consent of the
King; the King gave them a placard that they hung on their
door while they were having sex. The placard had F.U.C.K.
(Fornication Under Consent of the King) on it. Now you know
where that came from.</font></P><font color=aqua>

<font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.<font color=aqua>In Scotland, a new game was invented. It was entitled
Gentlemen Only Ladies Forbidden.... and thus the word GOLF
entered into the English language.</font></P><font color=aqua>

sin, and he was most certainly 'against' sin.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A girl, with a wonderful figure, and not nearly enough clothes
to hide much skin, came in late. She strode down the centre
aisle, close to the front and sat down.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was plain to the preacher that he had lost the men in his
audience to this voluptuous sex-object.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He shook a fist at her and said, <font color=silver>"You are the Jezebel the good
book tells us about. </font></P><font color=silver>
