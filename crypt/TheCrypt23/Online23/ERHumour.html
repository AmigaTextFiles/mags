<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A man comes into the ER and yells, "My wife's going 
to have her baby in the cab!" I grabbed my stuff, 
rushed out to the cab, lifted the lady's dress, and 
began to take off her underwear. Suddenly I noticed 
that there were several cabs, and I was definitely 
in the wrong one.</P></font></blockquote>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the beginning of my shift I placed a stethoscope 
on an elderly and slightly deaf female patient's 
anterior chest wall. "Big breaths," I instructed. 
"Yes, they used to be," remorsed the patient.</P></font></blockquote>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One day I had to be the bearer of bad news when I 
told a wife that her husband had died of a massive 
myocardial infarction. Not more than five minutes 
later, I heard her reporting to the rest of the 
family that he had died of a "massive internal fart."</P></font></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was performing a complete physical, including the 
visual acuity test. I placed the patient twenty feet 
from the chart and began, "Cover your right eye with 
your hand." He read the 20/20 line perfectly. "Now 
your left." Again, a flawless read. "Now both," I 
requested. There was silence. He couldn't even read 
the large E on the top line. I turned and discovered
that he had done exactly what I had asked; he was 
standing there with both his eyes covered. I was 
laughing too hard to finish the exam.</P></font></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During a patient's two week follow-up appointment 
with his cardiologist, he informed me that he was 
having trouble with one of his medications. "Which 
one?" I asked. "The patch. The nurse told me to put 
on a new one every six hours and now I'm running out 
of places to put it!"  I had him quickly undress and 
discovered what I really hoped I wouldn't see... Yes, 
the man had over fifty patches on his body! Now the 
instructions include removal of>the old patch before 
applying a new one.</P></font></blockquote>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While acquainting myself with a new elderly patient, 
I asked, "How long have you been bedridden?" After a 
look of complete confusion she answered... "Why, not 
for about twenty years - when my husband was alive."</P></font></blockquote>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was caring for a woman from Kentucky and asked, "So 
how's your breakfast this morning?" "It's very good, 
except for the Kentucky Jelly. I can't seem to get used
to the taste," the patient replied. I then asked to see 
the jelly and the woman produced a foil packet labeled 
"KY Jelly."</P></font></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A nurse was on duty in the Emergency Room, when a young
woman with purple hair styled into a punk rocker Mohawk,
sporting a variety of tattoos, and wearing strange
clothing, entered. It was quickly determined that the 
patient had acute appendicitis, so she was scheduled for
immediate surgery. When she was completely disrobed on
the operating table, the staff noticed that her pubic 
hair had been dyed green, and above it there was a tattoo 
that read, "Keep off the grass." Once the surgery was 
completed, the surgeon wrote a short note on the patient's
dressing, which said "Sorry, we had to mow the lawn."</P></font></blockquote>
