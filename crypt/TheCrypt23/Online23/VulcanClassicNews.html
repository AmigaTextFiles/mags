<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> After the great war, Infinity used this old section of the castle as a prison for those he feared the most. The Shamen had always lived peacefully in the kingdom of Valhalla until Infinity took the crown. He promised them sanctuary but instead he tricked them, and using their own magic against them he turned them to stone. Years have passed, and the five most powerful Shamen are thought to still stand within the ruins, enslaved for eternity to protect the three legendary magic rings of escape. The little prince must outwit the Shamen and gain entrance to the rooms where the magic rings are kept. In each of these rooms there are (thought to be) electrocution devices, armed to maim anyone who tries to steal the magic rings. Only the bravest and most ingenious adventurer will be able to deactivate the traps and ultimately escape this dangerous and foreboding place.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The little prince will find himself in a peaceful resting place, for some of Valhallas most notable royal ancestors. The Chapel is left almost entirely unspoiled by Infinity's evil hand. But don't let the calming atmosphere lull you into a false sense of security, for in this episode you will find more devious puzzles than any you have previously encountered. You must retrieve all four of the official plates that were used centuries before to commemorate the birth of the new kingdom. But the plates are well hidden, and only when you have satisfied the requests of the dead, will you then begin to unravel the mystery, that is The Chapel.</P></font>
