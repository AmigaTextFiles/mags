<P ALIGN="LEFT">When NASA was preparing for the Apollo project, they did 
some astronaut training on a Navajo Indian reservation. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">One day, a Navajo elder and his son were herding sheep and 
came across the space crew. The old man, who spoke only 
Navajo, asked a question which his son translated. "What are 
these guys in the big suits doing?" </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A member of the crew said they were practicing for their 
trip to the moon. The old man got all excited and asked if 
he could send a message to the moon with the astronauts. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Recognizing a promotional opportunity for the spin-doctors, 
the NASA folks found a tape recorder. After the old man 
recorded his message, they asked the son to translate it. 
He refused. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So the NASA reps brought the tape to the reservation where 
the rest of the tribe listened and laughed but refused to 
translate the elder's message to the moon. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, the NASA crew called in an official government 
translator. He reported that the moon message said, "Watch 
out for these guys; they have come to steal your land."</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A country preacher decided to skip services one Sunday and 
head to the hills to do some bear hunting. As he rounded the
 corner on a perilous twist in the trail, he and a bear 
collided, sending him and his rifle tumbling down the 
mountainside. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before he knew it, his rifle went one way and he went the 
other, landing on a rock and breaking both legs. That was 
the good news. The bad news was the ferocious bear charging 
at him from a distance, and he couldn't move. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Oh, Lord," the preacher prayed, "I'm so sorry for skipping 
services today to come out here and hunt. Please forgive me 
and grant me just one wish . . . please make a Christian out 
of that bear that's coming at me. Please, Lord!" </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That very instant, the bear skidded to a halt, fell to its 
knees, clasped its paws together and began to pray aloud 
right at the preacher's feet. "Dear God, bless this food I 
am about to receive . . ."</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The old Cherokee chief sat in his reservation hut, smoking the
ceremonial pipe, eyeing the two US government officials sent to interview
him.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Chief Two Eagles," one official began, "you have observed the white man for
many generations, you have seen his wars, his products, all his progress,
and all his problems."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The chief nodded.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The official continued, "Considering recent events, in your opinion, where
has the white man gone wrong?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The chief stared at the government officials for over a minute, and then
calmly replied. "When white man found the land, Indians were running it. No
taxes. No debt. Plenty buffalo, Plenty beaver. Medicine man was free. The
women did most of the work. Indian men hunted and fished all the time"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The chief smiled, and added quietly, "White man dumb enough to think he
could improve system like that."</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A  guy  travelling through the prairies of the USA  stopped  at  a
small town and went to a bar.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He  stood at the end of the bar,  ordered a drink,  and lit  up  a
cigar.   As  he sipped his drink,  he stood there quietly  blowing
smoke rings.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After  he  blew  nine or ten smoke rings into the air,   an  angry
American Indian stomped up to him and said,  "One more remark like
that, and I'll smash your face in!"</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE>
