<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There  are  nine major types of Chinese dragons These include  the
horned  dragon,  the winged dragon,  the celestial  dragon  (which
supports  and  protects the mansions of the gods),  the  spiritual
dragon  which generates wind and rain for the benefit of mankind),
the  dragon of hidden treasures (which keeps guard over  concealed
wealth),   the  coiling dragon (which lives in  water),   and  the
yellow  dragon  (which once emerged from water and  presented  the
legendary Emperor Fu Shi with the elements of writing)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  last of the nine is the dragon king,  which actually consists
of  four  separate dragons,  each of which rules over one  of  the
four seas, those of the east, south, west, and north.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  most  powerful  generalized type of  Chinese  dragon  is  the
horned  dragon,  or lung,  which can produce rain and  is  totally
deaf.  Additionally, there is a homeless dragon (Ii) that lives in
the  ocean  and  another type (chiao)  that is  scale-covered  and
usually inhabits marshes but also keeps dens in the mountains.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There  are  also  nine  ways   the   Chinese   have  traditionally
represented these dragons,  each one revealing a different  dragon
characteristic.  There are dragons carved on the tops of bells and
gongs,   because  of  the beast's habit  of  calling  loudly  when
attacked.  A second type is carved on the screws of fiddles, since
most dragons are fond of music.  A third is carved on the tops  of
stone  tablets,  because of dragons' love of literature.  A fourth
is found at the bottom of stone monuments,  as dragons can support
heavy  weights.  A fifth is placed on the eaves  of  temples,   as
dragons are ever alert to danger.  A sixth occurs on the beams  of
bridges,  since dragons are fond of water.  A seventh is carved on
Buddha's throne,  as dragons like to rest.  An eighth is placed on
the  hilts  of swords,  since dragons are known to be  capable  of
slaughter.   The ninth is carved on prison gates,   as  these  are
dragons that are fond of quarreling and trouble making.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  colors of Chinese dragons are evidently quite variable,   but
in the case of the chiao type its back is striped with green,  its
sides  are yellow,  and it is crimson underneath.  The nine  major
characteristics  of  a lung type dragon  include  a  head  like  a
camel's,  horns like a deer's,  eyes like a hare's,  ears  like  a
bull's,  a neck like an iguana's,  a belly like a frog's,   scales
like a carp's,  paws like a tiger's, and claws like an eagle's. It
has  a  pair  of  large canine teeth in its upper  jaw  The  long,
tendril-like whiskers extending from either side of its mouth  are
probably  used  for  feeling its way along  the  bottom  of  muddy
ponds.  In color it varies from greenish to golden,  with a series
of  alternating short and long spines extending down the back  and
along the tail,  where they become longer.  One specimen had wings
at  its side,  and walked on top of the water.  Another tossed its
mane back and forth making noises that sounded like a flute.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cow-heads are also common.  A ten-footer, found lying on the banks
of  China's Yangtze River,  was different from most because of its
long,  thick eyebrows.  A Yellow River variety,  seen on shore  in
the  1920s by a Chinese teacher,  was bright blue,  and as big  as
five  cows.  Both dragons crawled into the water  as  soon  as  it
started to rain.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  few  dragons begin life as fish.  Carp,  who successfully  jump
rapids  and  leap  over waterfalls,  change into fish-dragons.   A
popular saying,  "The carp has leaped through the dragon's  gate,"
means  success,   especially for students who  have  passed  their
exams.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Male dragons sometimes mate with other kinds of animals.  A dragon
fathers  an  elephant when he mates with a pig,  and  he  sires  a
racehorse, after mating with a mare.</P>
