A teacher was helping one of her preschoolers put his boots on.  <BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">He asked for help and she could see why.</P>

With  her pulling and him pushing, the boots still didn't want to go on.<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">When the  second boot was on, she had worked up quite a sweat.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">She almost whimpered  when the little boy said, <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"Teacher, they're on the
wrong feet."</font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">She looked, and sure enough they were. It wasn't any easier pulling the
boots off than it was putting them on. She managed to keep her cool as
together they worked to get the boots back on --- this time on the right
feet. He then announced,<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "These aren't my boots."</font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">She bit her tongue rather than get right in his face and scream,<FONT COLOR=LIME> "Why
didn't you say so?"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> like she wanted to.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Once again, she struggled to help him pull the ill-fitting boots off. He
then said,<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "They're my brother's boots. My Mom made me wear them."</font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">She didn't know if she should laugh or cry. She mustered up the grace to
wrestle the boots on his feet again.  She said,<FONT COLOR=LIME> "Now, where are your
 mittens?".</font></P><FONT COLOR=LIME>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">He said,<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "I stuffed them in the toes of my boots...."</font></P>
