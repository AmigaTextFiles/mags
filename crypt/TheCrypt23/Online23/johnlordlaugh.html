<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">A priest was asked to dinner by one of his parishioners.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">When he sat down at the table, he noticed that the dishes were
the dirtiest that he had ever seen in his life.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Were these dishes ever washed?" he asked his hostess,
running his fingers over the grit and grime.</P>

She replied, "Of course they were cleaned Father."<BR>
"They're as clean as soap and water could get them."<BR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He felt a bit apprehensive, but blessed the food anyway and they all
started eating.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The meal was delicious and he paid his compliments in spite the dirty
dishes.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">When dinner was over, the hostess took the dishes outside and yells -
"Here Soap! Here Water!"</P></font></blockquote>

<font color=aqua>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Sunday School teacher of pre-schoolers was concerned that
his students might be a little confused about Jesus because of
the Christmas season emphasis on His birth.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He wanted to make sure they understood that the birth of Jesus
occurred a long time ago, that he grew up, etc.
So he asked his class, "Where is Jesus today?"</P>

Steven raised his hand and said, "He's in heaven."<BR>
Mary was called on and answered, "He's in my heart."<BR>

Little Johnny, waving his hand furiously, blurts out -<BR>
"I know! I know! He's in our bathroom!!!"<BR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole class got very quiet, looked at the teacher, and
waited for a response. The teacher was completely at a loss
for a few very long seconds. He finally gathered his wits and
asked Little Johnny how he knew this.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">And Little Johnny said, "Well...every morning, my father gets up,
bangs on the bathroom door, and yells -</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">'Jesus Christ, are you still in there!?</P></font></blockquote>

eating a worm.</P>

worms!"</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Trying to convince him further, "Now the mother worm is looking all over
for her nice baby-worm."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"No, she isn't," said Johnny.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Why not?" said the mother.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Because I ate her first!"</P></font></blockquote>

"He must have had something in his hand."<BR>

"Dear Lord. Didn't you have anything in your hand?"<P>

"Aye, that I did - Mrs. Riley's right boob." Kelly said.<BR>
"And a beautiful thing it was, but not much use in a fight!"<P></font></blockquote>
