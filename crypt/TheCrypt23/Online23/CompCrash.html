<font color=yellow><CENTER>If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,</CENTER>
<CENTER>and the bus is interrupted at a very last resort,</CENTER>
<CENTER>and the access of the memory makes your floppy disk abort,</CENTER>
<CENTER>then the socket packet pocket has an error to report.</CENTER></font>
<BR>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash,</CENTER>
<CENTER>and the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash,</CENTER>
<CENTER>and your data is corrupted cause the index doesn't hash,</CENTER>
<CENTER>then your situation's hopeless and your system's gonna crash!!</CENTER></font>
<BR>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>If the label on the cable on the table at your house</CENTER>
<CENTER>says the network is connected to the button on your mouse,</CENTER>
<CENTER>but your packets want to tunnel to another protocol,</CENTER>
<CENTER>that's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall,</CENTER></font>
<BR>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>Now your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss,</CENTER>
<CENTER>so your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse;</CENTER>
<CENTER>then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang,</CENTER>
<CENTER>'cuz sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang!</CENTER></font>
<BR>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy in the disk,</CENTER>
<CENTER>and the macro code instructions cause unnecessary risk,</CENTER>
<CENTER>then you'll have to flash the memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your Mom!</CENTER></font>
<BR>
<BR>
<font color=aqua><CENTER>WELL! That certainly clears things up for ME.</CENTER></font>
