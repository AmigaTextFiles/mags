<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">A certain grace and style,  once synonymous with the railways,  has given way to a 
basic "get you to where you're going" ugliness.</P>
 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The picture detailed below indicates much more than just a railway,  and can be 
dated circa the turn of the last century.  The station-master, resplendent in Topper 
and Tails (the uniform of that time) was a most important individual in the 
community,  for it was through him that all manner of station/railway business was 
conducted.  </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Locomotives and rolling stock were immaculately presented,  and railway-men took 
a real pride in their jobs,  as is self evident in this picture.  Isn't it rather sad that 
the present day fails to deliver the same "feeling?"</P>
<P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">And finally,  some late news for A4 fans !   At last,  60009,  "Union Of  South
Africa"
returns to British soil,  great news for Gresley addicts !</P>



<P ALIGN="LEFT">That's all we have time for this time out,  I'm afraid.  Hope you'll all like the new 
format for the Crypt - these pictures get better !</P>
