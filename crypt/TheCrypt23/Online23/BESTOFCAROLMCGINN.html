<BLOCKQUOTE><Font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">There was a midget down in Texas who complained to his buddy  that
his  testicles  ached  almost all the  time.   As  he  was  always
complaining about his problem,  his friend finally suggested  that
he  go  to  the  doctor to see what could be done to  relieve  the
problem.</P></FONT>

<Font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">The  midget  took his advice and went to the doctor and  told  him
what  the problem was.  The doctor told him to drop his pants  and
he would have a look.</P></FONT>

<Font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">The  midget  dropped his pants.  The doctor put him  up  onto  the
examining table and started to examine him. The doc put one finger
under  his left testicle and told the midget to turn his head  and
cough, the usual method to check for hernia.</P></FONT>

<Font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">"Aha!"  mumbled  the doc and putting his finger  under  the  right
testicle, he asked the midget to cough again.</P></FONT>

<Font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">"Ahhha!" said the doctor and reached for his surgical scissors.</P></FONT>

<Font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Snip,  snip,  snip,  snip, snip, snip on the right side then snip,
snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip on the left side.</P></FONT>

<Font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">The  midget was so scared he was afraid to look,  but  noted  with
amazement that the snipping did not hurt.</P></FONT>

<Font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">The  Doctor then told the midget to pull up his pants  to  see  if
they  still  ached.   The midget was absolutely  delighted  as  he
walked  around the doc's office and discovered his testicles  were
no longer aching.</P></FONT>

<Font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">"Gee, Doc, what did you do?" he asked.</P></FONT>

<Font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">The  doc  replied,  "I cut two inches off the tops of your  cowboy
boots."</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Three  guys  die together in an accident and go to  heaven.   When
they get there,  St.  Peter says,  "We only have one rule here  in
heaven...don't step on the ducks."</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">So  they enter heaven,  and sure enough,  there are ducks all over
the place.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">It  is almost impossible not to step on a duck,  and although they
try their best to avoid them,  the first guy accidentally steps on
one. Along comes St. Peter with the ugliest woman he ever saw.</P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">St.   Peter  chains  them together and says "Your  punishment  for
stepping  on  a  duck is to spend eternity chained  to  this  ugly
woman!"</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The  next day,  the second guy steps accidentally on a duck,   and
along comes St.  Peter,  who doesn't miss a thing, and with him is
another  extremely ugly woman.  He chains them together  with  the
same admonishment as for the first guy.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The  third guy has observed all this and not wanting to be chained
for  all  eternity  to an ugly woman,  is VERY  careful  where  he
steps.  He manages to go months without stepping on any ducks, but
one day St.  Peter comes up to him with the most gorgeous woman he
has  ever laid eyes on...a very tall,  tanned,  curvaceous,   sexy
blonde. St. Peter chains them together without saying a word.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The guy remarks,  "I wonder what I did to deserve being chained to
you for all of eternity?"</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">She says, "I don't know about you, but I stepped on a duck."</P></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Mid-life  is when the growth of the hair on our legs  slows  down.
This  gives  us  plenty  of time to care for  our  newly  acquired
moustache.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Mid-life women no longer have upper arms;  we have wingspans.   We
are no longer women in sleeveless shirts;  we are flying squirrels
in drag.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Mid-life  has hit when you stand naked in front of the mirror  and
can see your rear end without turning around.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Mid-life  is when you bounce (a lot),  but you don't bounce  back.
It's more like splat!</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Mid-life  is when you want to grab every firm young  lovely  in  a
tube top and scream,  "Listen,  honey, even the Roman Empire fell,
and those things will too!"</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Mid-life is when you realize that,  if you were a dog,  you  would
need a control top flea collar.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Mid-life is when you go to the doctor and you realize you are  now
so old, you have to pay someone to look at you naked.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">You  know you are getting old when you go for a mammogram and know
it  is the only time someone will ask you to appear topless  in  a
film.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Mid-life  brings the wisdom that life throws you curves  and  that
you're now sitting on your biggest ones.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Mid-life can bring out your angry,  bitter side.  You look at your
latte-swilling,   beeper-wearing know-it-all teenager  and  think,
"For this I have stretch marks?"</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Mid-life is when your memory really starts to go:  the only  thing
you still retain is water.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The good news about mid-life is the glass is still half-full.   Of
course,   the bad news is that it won't be long before your  teeth
are floating in it.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">A good Irish man, John O'Reilly, was with his friends, hitting the
Guinness  and having a contest at who could make the  best  toast.
He hoisted his beer and said,  "Here's to spending the rest of  my
life Between the legs of me wife!"</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">He  went home and told his wife,  Mary,  "I won the prize for  the
best  toast of the night." She said,  "Aye,  what was your toast?"
He said, "Here's to spending the rest of me life sitting in church
beside me wife."</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The  next day she ran into one of his buddies on the street.   The
man  chuckled leeringly and said,  "John won the prize  the  other
night with a toast about you Mary."</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">She said,  "Aye and I was a bit surprised meself!  You know,  he's
only been there twice!</P></FONT>

ears to make him come."</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
