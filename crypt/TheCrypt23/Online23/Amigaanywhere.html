  the various flavors of Microsoft Windows<font color=white>®<font color=aqua>, 
  Linux, Embedded Linux, Symbian OS and VxWorks. The software runs unchanged on 
  almost all of the mainstream microprocessor families. Bill McEwen, Amiga's President 
  and CEO, said, <font color=silver><I>"The Amiga community is renowned world-wide 
  for creating exciting applications. It has a heritage as one of the leaders 
  in the video game industry and film animation. Today, those skills are being 
  used in creating content that can run on almost any digital device and will 
  offer new levels of excitement as we move forward."</i></font></font></font></P>
<font color=silver> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>"In the two years since Tao and Amiga first began working 
  together, our relationship has progressively tightened," said Francis Charig, 
  Chairman of Tao. "Operators are seeking content that consumers will actually 
  pay for, portable content that runs across a broad range of appliances. Amiga 
  is the first company that has actually got content that fulfills this important 
  objective."</i></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amiga<font color=white>®<font color=aqua>Anywhere capable devices 
  have instant access to a rapidly growing world of quality applications, exciting 
  content and valuable services. Many existing devices can become Amiga <font color=white>® 
  <font color=aqua>Anywhere capable while several new devices, such as the Nokia 
  MediaTerminal come with that capability as standard, offering a compelling reason 
  for customer purchase.</font></font></font></font></P>
