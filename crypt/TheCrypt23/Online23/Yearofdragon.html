<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WOOD  DRAGON:<font color=aqua>   The  Wood Dragon is creative,   imaginative,   and
inquisitive.  He is both a thinker and a doer and  is  capable  of
brilliant new concepts.  His every move is guided by sound  logic.
His  drive  and ambition allow him to put many of his  ideas  into
practice,   nevertheless this Dragon is capable of concealing  his
domination and tries not to offend.  He will even compromise if it
is advantages.  Although not as self-centered as other Dragons, he
is still outspoken and fearless when challenged.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FIRE DRAGON: <font color=aqua> The Fire Dragon is the most 
  extroverted and competitive Dragon. He tends to push too hard and expects a 
  lot from everyone. His criticisms are objective and he has the ability to arouse 
  massive popular support. His insatiable ambition can make him short-tempered 
  and intolerant. He is an empire builder who needs to master his less favorable 
  traits and learn how to communicate more humbly with people as individuals.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EARTH DRAGON: <font color=aqua> The Earth Dragon is a quieter, 
  more reflective Dragon, He will be appreciative of other's opinions even if 
  he fails to agree with them. He is reasonable in his approach to problems and 
  his leadership is less dictatorial. He is not given to outbursts of temper, 
  but at the same time demands respect. He knows the value of cooperation and 
  is more diplomatic than the other Dragons. He is ambitious, but his initiatives 
  are less hurried and more carefully thought out.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">METAL DRAGON:<font color=aqua> The Metal Dragon is the most 
  strong-willed Dragon. He is inflexible, unbending, and combative. He gives little 
  regard to the feelings of others. This ruthlessness can result in a rapid rise 
  to a position of authority, but often at the cost of destroying important relationships. 
  It is futile to attempt to convince him that certain things are simply undoable. 
  He will go it alone if he can't gain support. He succeeds because he refuses 
  to accept failure.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WATER DRAGON: <font color=aqua> The Water Dragon is less selfish 
  and opinionated than the other Dragons. He is more inhibited and less power- 
  hungry. He can accept defeat without recriminations. He makes a good negotiator 
  as he knows when, where, and how to apply pressure. He has a tendency to be 
  over-optimistic and needs to learn how to relinquish what is unfeasible so that 
  he can concentrate his energies on the most rewarding endeavors. </font></P>

    <U>THE DRAGON PERSONALITY TRAITS</U> 
  </CENTER>
</H1>
<P> <BR>
<font color=aqua> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Dragon person is self confident and impulsive and consequently 
  does not always listen to the advice of others. He is also a perfectionist and 
  he sets high standards for himself.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although strong and decisive the Dragon is not manipulative 
  or sly. He refuses to deceive or compromise and fails to spot subversive intent.ÊHe 
  enjoys being in command and like an emperor holding court he eliminates obstacles 
  until success is his.</P>
