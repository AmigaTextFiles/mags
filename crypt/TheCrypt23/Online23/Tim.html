<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> I'm an electronics engineer, interested in mostly classical music, science fiction, computers, and video production.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I'm 28 (<font color=white>November 1997<font color=aqua>), I've been working for myself for at least the last ten years, I run my own video production company, as well as providing technical support and maintenence services. And now I'm running a BBS too (<font color=white>just for interests sake<font color=aqua>).</font></font></font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua><font color=white><font color=aqua>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> I use Amiga computers, because I prefer them (<font color=white>I have used all the major computer systems available to home users, and a few others too<font color=aqua>).  If you're interested, you can see a picture of my Amiga in it's new wooden case below.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>



<P ALIGN="LEFT"> I've had a strong involvement in community television since the mid 1980s.  And every now and then support a production that otherwise couldn't be made because funding wasn't available, as well as providing technical assistance and training.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> I've worked voluntarily in schools for over the last twelve years - six years in high schools, and six years in special education (<font color=white>with the disabled<font color=aqua>).</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> I used to get regularly involved in various little community arts productions; though the last one, Space Trash, was quite some time ago.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> If you're reading this page to try and work out if I'm someone that you know; I went to school at Modbury West Primary School, Para Vista High School (<font color=white>now called Valley View Secondary School<font color=aqua>), and Regency Park TAFE; I've always lived in Modbury (a suburb in the city of Tea Tree Gully, North East of Adelaide, South Australia<font color=aqua>), in the same house, and I've still got the same phone number (<font color=white>as well as the new business one<font color=aqua>).</font></font></font></font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua><font color=aqua><font color=white><font color=aqua>

<font color=yellow><CENTER>The Wooden computer</CENTER>
<P>
 <font color=aqua><CENTER>I got a bit sick of all the cables straggled across the desk from all the peripherals to my A1200, but all the options to recase the Amiga were hideously huge and expensive.  So I decided to build the case myself.  And not having the facilities to work with metal, I did it with wood.  I also liked the idea of it looking different.</CENTER>

<CENTER>So now you know why my Amiga's been nicknamed Woody.</CENTER></font></P><font color=aqua>

<CENTER>I'd also like to suggest that IBuM owners do the same thing.  Then, when your computer keels over and dies from the year 2000 bug (that mine isn't affected by), you can hammer the final nail in it's coffin, and bury it.</CENTER><p></P>

<font color=yellow><CENTER>Rusty</CENTER>
<P>
 <font color=aqua><CENTER>After giving my Amiga 1200 the name Woody, I thought I ought to name the other Amiga (my A2000) something.  The next obvious name was Rusty (<font color=white>because it's still in a metal case<font color=aqua>).</font></font></CENTER><font color=white><font color=aqua>
<P>
<CENTER> Rusty has 10 megs of RAM, that's 2 megs of custom chip RAM (<font color=white>used for sound, and graphics<font color=aqua>), and 8 megs of fast RAM (<font color=white>used by the CPU<font color=aqua>); two double density floppy drives; a fifty meg SCSI hard drive; and my spare 14k4 external MODEM.</font></font></font></font></CENTER><font color=white><font color=aqua><font color=white><font color=aqua>
<P>
<CENTER> Although this doesn't sound much now, it must have cost a fortune in it's day (<font color=white>I'm not the original owner<font color=aqua>).</font></font></CENTER><font color=white><font color=aqua>
<P>
 <CENTER>I've used in on the internet for e-mail, Telnet, and ICQ; but I usually just use it for calling BBSs when the other computer is occupied.</CENTER>

<font color=aqua><CENTER>Occasionally I have jobs requiring extra workers, but this work is only sporadic, and often for one day only either. While it's best for people to already be familiar with the job required of them, I will train them in their own time, ahead of the job.</CENTER>
