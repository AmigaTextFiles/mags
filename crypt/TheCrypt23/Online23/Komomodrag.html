<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  largest living lizard,  the Komodo dragon,  live only in  the
vicinity  of the Indonesia,  for example,  on Komodo island,   for
which  they are named,  and on two other tiny island in the Lesser
Sundas  group of Southeast Asia,  the Komodo dragon is the world's
largest living lizard,  occasionally exceeding 10 feet (3  m)   in
length. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  Komodo dragons are carnivorous,  feeding on  animals  as
large  as  small  deer and bush pigs.  Their long,   sharps  claws
enable  them to disembowel large animals,  and their jagged  teeth
aid them in tearing pieces from their prey.  Komodo dragons,  like
other  large monitors,  can be formidable adversaries,   even  for
humans,   if these lizards are actually cornered.  Komodo  dragons
swim  well,   sometimes swimming to small isles a  half  kilometer
from shore to prey on domestic goats.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surprisingly,   this colossal creature remain unknown  to  science
until  as  recently as 1912,  but the natives of the  region  were
well  award of its existence and also its prowess as a man-killer.
Heightening  its  dragonesque  appearance  is  its  bright  yellow
tongue,  flickering out of its mouth in faithful facsimile of  its
mythical, fire-spiting namesakes.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">These  reptiles are endangered and are under strict protection  by
the Indonesian government.</P>
